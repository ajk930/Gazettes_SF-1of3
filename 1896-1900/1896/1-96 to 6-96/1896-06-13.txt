RENEWAL OF THE STRUGGLE OF CONTESTING
DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION.
Meanwhile the McKinley Men Are Shouting
"Finance" and the Adherents of Allison,
Reed and Quay Are Quietly Working
for Their Candidates.
THE UNITED PRESS HEADQUAR
TERS. SOUTHERN HOTEL. ST. LOUIS,
Mo., June 12.â This has been a day of in
ertia in the Republican camp. Even the
arrival of Senator Quay to re-enforce the
presence of ex-Senator Platt failed to gal- j
vanize the anti-McKinley movement back
to any semblance of vigorous life. The
corridors around the room where the
National Committee went through its
monotonous routine of deciding prelim
inary contests were never uncomfortably
thronged at any period of the day. What
the decisions of the committee would be j
appeared to be taken for granted in a
majority of cases. Some eccentric depar- i
tures in the Louisiana contested cases !
from the ordinary course of rulings |
scarcely served to give zest to otherwise
tasteless proceedings.
When the New York contests are
reached to-morrow or Monday interest
may revive. Some of Mr. Platt's inti
mates continue to make veiled threats of
bolting if the New York contests are de
cided on the same principles that are
alleged to have controlled the committee
in other cases, but Mr. Piatt himself has
carefully avoided committing himself to
such a course.
Late this afternoon some very decided
indications were given as to the course
which the McKinley men would probably
take on the financial question.
Hitnerto the Platt men have shouted
"sound money" and the McKinley men
have shouted "tariff," and neither ?ide
has manifested any disposition to adopt
the war cry of the other. Now all this is
changed, and the McKinley men are
shouting finance. A suggested platform
drafted by Mr. Kohlsaat of Chicago was
submitted to Mr. H&nna and other
close friends of Major McKinley
to-day and was taken under con
sideration. The proposed financial
plank, while following in the
lines of the Indiana platform,
goes an important step farther and speci
fically declares for the "gold standard."
At The same time, however, that this J
proposition was submitted the suggestion j
was made that if this platform were I
adopted by the committee on resolutions
it should be with the distinct understand
ing that if it were reported to the conven
tion by the committee on resolutions the
chairman should entertain a motion to
RICHARD TRIGGINGTON THOMPSON OF INDIANA, WHO WILL BE THE
FATHER OF THE CONVENTION.
Mr. Thompson is the only surviving member of the Indiana Legis
lature of 1834, and the only living member of the Congress of 1841.
Beginning with Andrew Jackson, Mr. Thompson has known, more or
less intimately, all our chief magistrates. During his first term in
Congress he met Abraham Lji coin, and the acquaintance grew into a
friendship which endured until the death of the latter. He cast his
first vote for General Harrison in 1840, and nearly fifty years
afterward his loyal support materially aided the grandson in secur
ing the Presidential nomination first and the election afterward.
The San Francisco Call.
strike out the words "gold standard," the
plank to be so framed that this could be
done without interfering with the context
or the sense. Such a motion being enter
tained, the proposition would be subject
to debate, and could be finally settled by
the convention on a test vote. It is under
stood to be Mr. Hanna's judgment that
the words "gold standard" ought not to
appear in the platform.
Ex-Senator Platt to-day issued over his
signature the following statement:
"Governor Morton will be placed in
nomination and cordially supported by
his friends. Speaker Reed and Senator
AUison will also receive the votes of their
supporters, all reports to the contrary
notwithstanding. I am hopeful that the
convention will recognize tne wisdom of
making Governor Morton our Presidential
candidate and declaring unequivocally for
a single gold standard. He is essentially,
the gold standard candidate as his record
demonstrates.
"From a cursory observation duriny my
brief stay here I am sanguine that a ma
jority of the delegates favor the continu
ance of the existing financial system as
interposed by Republican administrations.
The New Yoric delegation will certainly
do all in Us power to put a gold plank in
the platform, for New York is for gold.
"T. C. Platt."
Senators Allison's friends, who have
hitherto remained so silent that the
impression sained ground that he had
been withdrawn from the race, are now
as3Uining an aggressive attitude and as
sert that, lie will be supported by vigor
ous oratory and many votes when the con
vention proceeds to nominations.

ADDICKS IS DENOUNCED.
Stinging Words Characterize the
Struggle of Rival Delegates.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â "1 would not
vote for J. Edward Addick3, if his vote
were needed to make the next President of
the United States."
This declaration, uttered by Senator
Thurston of Nebraska at 10:30 o'clock to
night, as he stood in the center of his
fellow-National Committeemen, with up
lifted arm and clencned tint, was the climax
of one of the most sensational scenes ever
witnessed in a meeting of a similar body
on the eve of a National convention. For
two hours previously the comrrHtee had
been listening to the presentation of the
cases of the rival delegations from the
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, JUNE 13, 1896.
THOMAS C. PLATT, THE GREAT REPUBLICAN LEADER, OF THE
GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK.
Mr. Platt is a veteran in the councils of the party. He is one of the few members of
the famous Grant phalanx that voted for the hero of Appomattox thirty-seven times in the
Convention of 1880 who will sit in the Z i LouI? Convention next week. It is an interesting
fact that Levi P. Morton, whose candidacy for the Presidential Nomination Mr. Platt is now
urging, was also one of the famous "306" in the Convention of 1880.
State of Delaware. That headed by ex-
Senator Anthony Higgins claimed to be
the regular delegation, and was instructed
for McKinley, while the six entered upon
Secretary Stanley's records as contestants
were headed by J. Edward Addicks, and
Senator Quay was given by one of their
number as their preference for the Presi
dential nomination.
Personalities were freely exchanged in
the presentation of the respective cases
between ex-Senator Higgins, State Chair
man Caleb R. Layton and Mr. Addicks
himself, but it was not until the parties in
interest had retired that the storm broke
forth. Then Senator Thurston, first gain
ing the floor, commenced an impassioned
speech. Be reviewed the evidence elicited
in the Dupont controversy before the
United States Senate and declared that it
exposed a state of affairs unprecedented
in the history of any State Republican
party in the country. Addicks, he said,
had been proved a traitor to the cause of
Republicanism. When that party had
forty-four Senators in the Capitol at
Washington and but one more was needed
to give it the majority over the Populistic-
Democratlc element it was Addicks who,
by the aid of a Democratic Governor,
brought about a deadlock and prevented
Delaware from receiving its proper repre
sentation in the Senate of the United
States.
"Talk to me of honor and decency in
politics," said the Senator. "I tell you
here and now that I would not vote for J.
Edward Addicks if his vote was needed to
make the next President of the United
States and if necessity demands I will re
peat that statement upon the floor of the
National Convention."
Two rounds of applause, the first demon
stration of the kind that had marked the
proceedings of the committee, followed the
Nebraska Senator's declaration.
When the rival delegations, headed
respectively by Higgins and Addicks,
were ushered into the committee-room
the excitement on the ' part of the com
mittecmen was intense and they moved
their chairs forward until they formed a
'semicircle about the contestants and the
presiding officer. Without preliminary
ex-Senator Higgins plunged into the case
in behalf of bimsetf and bis associates.
Mr. Addicks sat close beside him and at
times it looked as though the two men
might come into personal collision,
especially as Mr. Higgins denounced Ad
dicKs as the principal of the conspiracy
against law and honor and as a man who
regarded neither.
Mr. Higgins was followed by Washing
ton Hastings, who was equally emphatic.
Turning to Addicks, who sat with a sar
castic smile on his face, he shook his
finger under his nose and ejaculated:
"This man is governed by a base and self
ish ambition. I say it to his face as I
have said it before- His name is Addicks.
Little as he understands the language of a
gentleman, he doubtless understands
what I say."
Addicks made no response.
The principal address on the other side
was made by Caleb R. .Layton, chairman
of the convention which nominated the
Addicks delegation, who entered a pro
test against the washing of the dirty linen
of the Delaware Republicans before the
committee. He also made a bitter attack
upon the motives of ex-Senator Higgins,
wnose political fortunes, he said, had
been made by Addicks.
Then Mr. Addicks made a brief address
in his own behalf. He claimed that he
had been indorsed by the people of Dela
ware and had destroyed the worst ring
that the Republican party had ever
known.
Mr. Higgins replied. He alluded to
Addicks as "that creature," and said that
his speech showed him to be the "moral
idiot" that every one in Delaware Knew
he was.
R. C. Kerens moved that all of the Ad
dicks delegation, with the exception of
Addicks himself, be placed upon the tem
porary roll.
Senator Thurston declared that on the
floor of the convention he would speak and
vote to unseat the entire delegation.
Numerons speeches and motions were
made, all taking the ground that Addicks
was not a Republican, and should not be
recognized as such. Finally Senator
Carey of Wyoming moved that the Hig
gins delegation be plac-d on the temporary
roll. The vote was 10 ayes to 39 noes.
Then the committee, on motion of Mr.
Sutherland, voted, 41 to 9, that it was not
willing to place either delegation on the
temporary roll, and referred the entire
matter to the National Republican Con
vention.
Before the Delaware case was taken up
there was a lone: discussion on a motion by
Delegate Catron of New Mexico to the
effect that six delegates each be placea on
the roll for the Territories of New Mexico,
Arizona, Oklahoma and the Indian Terri
tory. It was finally adopted.
SETTLING THE CONTESTS.
National Committeemen Make
Short Work of the Disputes.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â Every mem
ber of the National Committee was in his
seat or represented by proxy when the
committee reconvened at 10:30 o'clock
this morning.
Just as soon as Chairman Carter had
called his associates to order Committee
man N. B. Scott of West Virginia asked
the committee to give its serious attention
to the fact that while this was the third
day of the session only sixty contests had
so far been passed upon and 108 still
remained upon the order of business. He
moved that irom now on each side in the
contested delegations be allowed but ten
minutes for presentation of its case, and it
was carried.
Secretary Manley announced that the
contest in the Eighth Virginia District
had been withdrawn by letter and the
names of W. B. G. Shumate and H. Y.
Wayle were placed upon the temporary
roll. Both are instructed for McKinley.
Consideration of the Mississippi contests
was resumed, the Sixth being next on the
calendar. Ex-Congressman Lynch ap
peared for the contestees, J. W. Randolph
and Sam D. Young (colored) and General
Thompson of Ohio spoke for the contest
ants, C. A. Simpson and George P. Bowles
(colored). There was no debate in com
mittee and the two last named were
promptly seated, by a unanimous vote.
With equal celerity the contestants in the
Seventh Mississippi district, James M.
Matthews, Sr., and George C. Granberry
(colored) were placed on the role to the
exclusion of J. Meredith Matthews and
Thomas E. Richardson. In each of these
cases both contestees and contestants were
McKinleyites.
Next the committee toot up the case
brought from the First district of Ala
bama and which had been laid over from
Wednesday afternoon. Here the contest
ants were S. M. Murphy and D. H. Pren
tiss, both colored and favoring Reed as
first choice and the contestees, Samuel S.
Booth and John Harmon (colored) both
lor McKinley.
After the statements had been heard
Committeeman Sutherland of New York
moved that in view of the conflicting
statements the affid. 'its ip the case
be submitted to a sub-committee of five.
This was ruled out on the ground that the
committee had previously refused to refer
contests to sub-committees.
Settle of North Carolina then proposed
that both contestees and contestants be
excluded from the temporary roll, but it
was defeated.
The committee then refused to seat the
Reed delegation by a vote of 12 to 31, and
Booth and Harmon were placed upon the
temporary roll.
Senator Gear of lowa declared that this
vote "would have a bad effect upon the
country."
At the afternoon session the contest
from Delaware was called, but it was an
nounced that Mr. Addicks would not ar
rive until 3 p. m. and it was postponed for
two hours. Meanwhile the contest upon
the delegatca-at-large from Louisiana was
ta ken up. .
In this case the representatives of the
regular Republican party of the State,
comprising Wiliiam Pitt Kellogg, Albert
JI. Leonard (white Reedites), and Henry
Demas and J. Madison Vance (colored
MiKinleyite- ), claim to be entitled to be
placed upon the roll. Against them are
the nominees of the National Republican
Sugar-Planters' Convention, A. A. Mc-
Ginnis, E. N. Cornany, Anthony Doherty
and R. H. Hackney, all white McKinley
ites. In addition Leonard's seat is inde
pendently contested by Andrew Hero Jr.
The McGinnis quartet had an advantage
in a certificate from the chairman of the
State committee setting forth that it was
regular, and its proofs were presented and
argued by William Belian of New Orleans.
Without calling upon the other delega
tion to reply, the committee went into ex
ecutive session and promptly seated the
Kellogg delegates by a unanimous vote.
It was suggested, however, by several
members of the committee that this sum
mary proceeding might do injury to the
Republican cause iv Louisiana Dy alienat
ing the sugar-planters' element, and the
respective delegations having been called
back, Chairman Carter made a pacific ad
dress pointing out that the action taken
had been based upon the statement of
Belian himself that the organization he
represented was not regular, and suggest
ing that the Committes on Credentials of
the National Committee was a court of
last resort.
The contestants accepted the suggestion
and announced as they withdrew that the
case would be carried to the convention.
Although the seating of ex-Governor
Kellogg and his associates was regarded as
disposing of all the contests in the six
Louisiana Congressional districts, it was
decided to take them up seriatim and hear
arguments. Iv the First district, ex-
Governor Henry C. Warmoth and Walter
L. Cohen (colored), instructed for McKin
ley, and C. W. Boothby and G. W. Dever
zin (colored), instructed for Reed, were the
rival delegations.
Warmoth and Cohen were seated with
out a rollcall. This was a victory for the
sugar planters or National Republicans
and a practical reversal of the position
taken by the committee on the preceding
contest.
In the Second district the contestees

BE PLACED SQUARELY ON RECORD.
Next in Importance to the Protection of American
Industries Come Questions Relating to the
Coinage of Precious Metals in
Proper Ratios.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., June 12.â Now, that
the matter of the Presidency is about set
tled and that the contest of the Vice-Presi
dency is narrowing down, the question of
protection is coming to the front and is
being discussed in the hotel lobbies to
night. It is conceded that one of the
strongest planka in the platform must "be
that of protection to American industries.
Unlike almost any other is-ue before the.
political parties to-day, the demand for
protection Is universp.. There is not a
State in the Union that does not clamor
for it. While Republicans may be divided
on matters of policy respecting finance
CHAUNCEY IVES FILLEY OF MISSOURI, ONE OF THE
DELEGATES AT LARGE.
Mr. Filley is one of the notable political characters of the country,
and will be sure to attract attention on the floor of the convention.
He belongs to the old guard and has sat in every Republican National
Convention since 1864. In that year he, with other members of the
Missouri delegation, did the queer thing of voting for Grant when
every other delegation recorded itself for Abraham Lincoln. He voted
in four different National conventions for General Grant, and in 1880
cast his ballot for the great commander thirty-seven times. He is the
proud possessor of one of the " 306 " medals, and often wears it upon
his breast.
PRICE CENTS
and other issues, they are a unit in the be
lief and are unanimous in the demand
tliat American labor must be protected from
the cheap slave labor of 'Europe. This cry
for relief comes from Maine to the south
ernmost rim of Florida, from Washington
to the Mexican border, and is echoed from
all the States that lie between.
m this interest has come to St. Louis'
Henry T. Oxnard, founder and proprietor
of the beet-sugar factory in Chino, Cal.
Mr. Oxnard sees great possibilities in store
for sugar-beet culture iv California and
other States whose soil and climate may
be adapted to the produc tion of this vege2
table. He is opposed to counties or sub
sidies and desires for the industry repre
sented by him the same measure of pro
tection that is afforded others. Ex-Gov
ernor Warmouth of Louisiana is'in accord
with the sentiments expressed by Mr. Ox
nard and is lending him his hearty co
operation. Under the present tariff the
duty on sugar is 40 per cent advalorem.
This Mr. Oxnard does not think is high
enough to keep out the competition of the
cheap peon labor of othercountries and he
is in favor of Jevying a specific duty ol 2
cents per pound on sugar, as it was in the
McKinley bill. This would enable Amer
ican sugar-producers to build up the in
dustry without raising the price and would
bring into cultivation in California alone
many thousands of acre: of what would
otherwise be unproductive land.
Mr. Oxnard says that the experiment in
California has proved conclusively that
beet-raising for the purpose of sujjar man
ufacture is profitable to the farmer and
under a proper system of protection wiil
be in time one of the great industries of
California.
Mr. Oxnard and his associates from
Louisiana have prepared the following to
be submitted to the committee on plat
form as a special plank for insertion there
in:
"The practicability of successfully grow
ing sugar-beets throughout the United
States having been clearly demonstrated
within the last tive years, and believing
that uni\ersal introduction of this crop
will be a material aid to our agricultural
classes in times when other staple crops
are depressed, we favor any measure which
can brine about the rapid development of
a National sugar industry, thereby keep
ing at home and distributing among our
own agricultural inhabitants the $12d.000,
-000 which we are annually sending abroad
to foreigners for sugar."
It is not expected that there will be any
opposition to the insertion of this plank in
the platform. Other special planks asking
for protection on wool and lead, which in
dustries have been paralyzed by the Demo
cratic tariff, will be urged, so that it may
become unmistakeably apparent to even
the most unreflecting voter that the Re
publican party is determined at all hazards
to restore to the afflicted laborers, me
chanics and agriculturists of the country
that prosperity which was strangled by
the Wilson bill.
The following is the proposed plank on
the lead matter:
"ThÂ«s Republican party is in favor of the
re-enactment of the tariff schedule of 1890
providing for a duty on lead ores, without
taking notes of the value of the silver
associated with the lead in the ores im
ported."
There is but little doubt that the follow
ing wiil be made a part of the platform :
"Noting that under the tariff act of
March 2, 1867, the wool industry was more
prosperous than during any other period
in the history of the country, and observ
ing that the present free-trade policy of
the Democratic administration has ruined
that industry, the Republican party, not
Jess eager to-day than in the past to up
hold the interests of those engaged in the
raising of wool, hereby stand committed
to the reinstatement of a schedule on wool
as enacted in the tariff law of 1867."
A prominent Morton man said to-night,
speaking of McKinley's expected nomina
tion, "Dead things sometimes get up and
walk."
Nexi in importance 'to protection is the
financial issue. The silver men, headed
by Colonel Isaac Trumbo of Utah, are still
defiant and aggressive. They declare that
as they cannot get free coinage they will
insist on a clean-cut plauk in favor of
gold, so that there may be no mistake as
to the attitude of the Republican party on
the subject.
If a declaration for gold would be better
for the cause of Republicanism in the East
than an attempt to conceal the gold
otandard behind glittering generalities,
they want gold to be put into the platform.
Several conferences have been held con
cerning this matter, and up to the present
writing the leaders of the Republican
party who are for sound money and the
silver men have not been able to agree.
Nor is it likely that there will be any com
promise, for Thomas C. Platt of New York
eaid this morning:
"We are here for a gold standard. The
New York delegation is for a gold standard
and a man that fits it, and we believe that
man to be Morton of New York"
The following financial plank was pre
pared by the McKinley men this morning:
"We are firm and emphatic in our de
mand for honest money. We believe that
our money should not be inferior to the
money of the most enlightened nations of
the earth. We are unalterably opposed to
any scheme that threatens to debase or de
preciate our currency. We favor the use
of silver as currency, but to the extent
only and under such regulations that its
parity with gold can be maintained, and
in consequence are opposed to the free and
unlimited and independent coinage of sil
ver."
A copy of this was handed to Colonel
Trumbo, and he declared that it did not
Fuit him. T. C. Platt of New York has re
fused to agree to the substitution of "sound
money" for gold, the New Yorkers de
manding an outspoken and unequivocal
declaration. So that the hitcn remains.
It is estimated that there are 600 votes in
the convention opposed to a gold planic
Buch as is desired by Morton's backers,
and in favor of sound money or currency
laws that will provide a circulating medium
in gold, ailver and paper which will
always be interchangeable at its face
value.
Colonel Trumbo has prepared the fol
lowing plank on silver:
"The Republican party is in favor of
free and unlimited coinage of gold and
silver at the ratio of sixteen ounces of
silver being equivalent, in all the functions
of money, to one ounce of gold when
coined into dollars of the United States of
America."
The colonel said to the committee this
evening in support of his plank:
â¢'We are to-day confronted with one of
the greatest problems ever presented to a
convention requiring a solution. It is the
money question. After twenty-three years
of anti-silver legislation, ending with the
complete overflow of our system of
ttnance existing up to 1873, and the estab
lishment of the reign of gold, I inquire,
what is tne comparative condition of this
country, a country which had the energy
of 40,000,000 to 70,000,000 human beings?
"You will no doubt attribute to adverse
tariff legislation much of the woe which
besets you to-day, but let us go back to the
time when the Republican tariff schedules
stood unmoved, and if memory serves you
well you will recall the gradual decline of
prices, the yearly growth of depreciation
and the fading of prosperity. There was a
time In the history of the United States
when every child was assured a station in
life commensurate with the energies of in
tellect and body displayed, regardless of
the inheritance which the first rays of
light which greeted the tiny eyes of in
fancy might have found it in possession of.
, 'Things are different now. The strata
of society are being well defined and the
fortunes or misfortunes of birth prevail
'throughout life. I point with pride to the
nredictions of the silver men in their Na
tional utterances. They have read aright
the siirns of the times with that accuracy
which is only attributal to a correct diag
nosis of the ailments of the body politic.
They have forewritten the financial his
tory of the United States with a vision
most prophetic, and those who have the
inclination and who will review the de
bates in Congress for the past twenty years
and take note of what the champions of
bimetallism have said cannot help be as
tonished, if not convinced, by the force
of events following in the waKe of silver
sentiment.
"I realize that as a Western man hail
ing from a silver State I am open to the
charge of being unduly prejuuiced in favor
of 6ilver, but it may be somewhat of a sur
prise to many of you to know that my
greatest interests are in gold mines, where
not an ounce of silver is to be encountered.
Some of the ablest and most radical, advo
cates of silver remonetization are men
who have never seen a silver mine. In this
connection I wish to refer to the oft-re
peated statement that the silver barons
are seeking to obtain 100 cents for a 50
-cent dollar. If you will but reflect for a
moment the absurdity of the statement
will be discernible. If the spirit of the
plank which I have presented was abided
by, supposing the Republican party
1 adopted it, and through that adoption it
j became the basis of a law, the miner would
[ have his silver coined into dollars of 412%
1 grains of pure silver, and lor every 371>Â£
grains of pure silver deposited at the
United States mint he would receive in
exchange an American silver dollar. Now,
here you have your choice: If the dollar
thus obtained passes for 100 cents no man
| with 371}^ errains of uncoined bullion will
j part witu it for less than 100 cents, and a
I 100-cent dollar will be worth 100 cents.
Has any harm been done? If, on the
other hand, the 371>4 grains are only
passable for 50 cents when coined will the
bonanza kings, as they are spoken of,
profit by free coinage? When the silver
men state that the demonetization has re
sulted in the depreciation of farm prod
ucts proportionately to the fall of silver
by virtue of a contraction of the currency
and the advantages enjoyed by silver
standard countries, the reply is made that
improvements in farm machinery is the
true cause and not the act of 1873. If the
farmers were equally as prosperous now as
they were before the effects of demoneti
zation became felt, mechanical im
provements could be held somewhat
blamable for the present distress
among our pastoral population. If a
farmer can to-day make two blades of
grass grow where formerly one grew, and
care for his increased responsibilities by
virtue of the aid machinery affords, is it
fair to presume that that advantage and
that aid has after twenty years of trial left
the farmer a bankrupt and an owner of a
mortgage which has bereft him of the
acreage which is free from debt?"
Relative to the situation in California
the New York Tribune of yesterday, quot
ing Shortridge, says:
"The California delegates are for silver,
but they are primarily and overwhelm
ingly for a protective tariff, as shown by
the indorsement by the convention of Mr.
McKinley for President, who is looked
upon by California as the great champion
of that principle. There will be no bolt on
the part of the California delegation.
They feel too strongly the need of tariff
laws advocated by the Republican party,
and will look only to the Republican party
for help on the silver question."

PLATT DECLARES FOR
GOLD AND MORTON
Cbntintied from First Page.
were A. T. Wimberly and Richard Sim
mons (colored), instructed fur McKinley,
and the contestants, Morris Marks and
Lucien Como (colored), instructed for Reed.
As in the other contests in this State the
disputes were based upon the regularity
or otherwise of the conventions at which
the delegates were elected. Wimberly and
Simmons were seated without debate or
opposition.
Next on the list was the Third Louisiana
district contest, where L. S. Clark and
William J. Belian, National Republicans,
challenged the credentials of Meyer Cahn
and of State Chairman Thomas A. Cage
(colored), all four McKinleyites.
Cahn and Cage- were excluded by a vote
of 19 to 18, but subsequently, on motion of
Hahn of Ohio, both delegations were
seated with a half vote each. The vote
was 27 to 11. This was the first double
delegation to be placed on the roll by the
committee, and Committeeman Botkin of
Montana expressed the fear that the pre
cedent would return to plague the body.
David S. Perris and C. C. Antoine (col
ored), both "regular Republicans" and in
structed for McKinley, were the claimants
in the Fourth district, while Benjamin
O'Neil and William Harper (colored),
both instructed for I^eed, made contest for
the seats. This was an echo of a similar
dispute which arose over the same com
peting delegations in the Minneapolis con
vention four years ago. Harper and
O'Neil, the Reed men, were seated by a
unanimous vote.
No presentation of facts was made in the
Fifth and Sixth districts and the regular
delegates from each locality, L. B. Don
nelly and S. W. Green (colored) and J. B.
Biooks and W. W. Johnson (both colored),
were seated. Ail four are instructed for
McKinley.
Delaware, New York and North Carolina
were passed for the time being, there be
ing no response when they were called by
the sergeant-at-arms.
In the Third Virginia District the con
testant failed to put in an appearance and
the regular delegates, Edmund Waddell
Jr. and C. \V. Harris, both instructed for
McKinley, wore seated.
At this juncture the repular order was
suspended and Wilson of Delaware moved
a reconsideration of the vote by which
Todd and Sapp (McKinleyites) were recog
nized yesterday as delegates from the Fifth
District of Kentucky.
The reconsideration was granted, and
then Committeeman Yerkes of that State
asked that the contestant^, Knoefer and
Reeder (Bradley first choice) be seated
with the regular delegates with a hair vote
each. Powell Ciayton entered a vigorous
objection and the metter was passed for
the present. After waiting for some time,
and the Delaware contestants failing to put
in an appearance, the committee, at 5:30
o'c lock, took a recess.
Tht* next contest heard by the commit
tee was that from Arizona, the one set of
delegates being that headed by Henry J.
Cleveland and the other by William
Christy. The claim of the latter was
stated by Isaac T. Stoddard. The claim
of the Cleveland set was stated by Charles
W. Wright. The Â«or.test was upon the
question of a vote of adjournment by the
convention. The decision of the commit
tee was that both delegations be admitted
with half votes.
At 11:30 o'clock the delayed contest
from the Fifth Alabama district was taken
up. Benjamin W. Walker, the solitary

EXPECTS TO MAKE A DEAL.
Conditions Under Which Platt Will
Run Morton for Second Place.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â The arrival
of Senator Quay was the only interesting
episode of to-day. His headquarters were
soon thronged with a motley crowd of poli
ticians, newspaper men and curious ones
anxious to get a glimpse of the great Penn
sylvania politician. Senator Quay de
clines to make any statement for publica
tion to-night, but to an intimate friend tie
confided his opinion tnat Governor Mor
ton would have the Vice-Presidency if Mr.
Platt would only say the word, but Mr.
Platt will not knuckle to the McKhiley
men. He declares that inasmuch as Mr.
Morton has been indorsed for the Presi
dency by the greatest of all the States his
name shall be presented to the convention
and voted upon for President. It is be
lieved, however, that Mr. Platt expects to
make a deal whereby Governor Morton
will consent to take the Vics-Presidentinl
nomination, provided the platform is for
sound money on the basis of a single gold
standard. Of course Mr. Plati realizes
that any farther opposition to McKinley 's
nomination is hopeless.
He appreciates the iact that the McKin
ley people would rather have Morton
nominated for Vice-President than any
other candidate mentioned. It is believed,
therefore, that his efforts will now be di
rected toward securing as strong a gold
plank as he can in the platform. He
would like to have it much stronger than
the Indiana platform.
The wiseacres say that Platt will soon
have it made known that Morton will con
sent to accept the Vice-Presidential race
on a single gold standard platform. Of
course, the platform will be adopted be
fore the nominations are made, and if the
financial plank is strong enough to suit
Mr. Platt Governor Morton's name will
go before the convention for Vice-Presi
dent. In short, Mr. Piatt is ready to
enter his friend, Governor Morton, m the
Vice- Presidential race provided the fin
ancial plans of the platform declares for
the gold standard, but if the financial
resolutions are no stronger than the In
diana platform declarations Governor
Morton will not be a candidate.
The free silver men will hold a caucus
to-morrow upon the arrival of Senator
Teller of Colorado. The concensus of opin
ion is that the Gnancial plank will be
drawn on the lines of the Indiana plat
form, and, this not being altogether accept
able to Mr. Platt, Governor Morton's name
will not be presented for Vioe-Presi<ie:it,
and the ticket nominated will be McKinley
and Hobart. C. C. Carltoh.
PLATT VISITS HANNA.
Terms, However, Not P/ade With
McKinley's Manager.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â Thomas C.
Platt has been to Mr. Hauna's room and
Messrs. Platt and Hanna have talked
matters over. That much is certain, and
the feverish energy with which Hanna
denies this f&ct detracts nothing from its
tiuth.
Platt's first appearance on the scene last
night, when he threatened that his men
would walK out of the convention if the
Platt delegates are turned down was not
calculated to encourage the dove of peace.
Nor is there an understanding between
the two men at present in spite of their
meeting to-day. Mr. Hanna would make
Platt no promises regarding the treatment
to be accorded to the Platt delegates by
the National Committee or by the conven
tion, nor did Mr. Platt indicate any
enthusiasm toward Mr. Hanna's tentative
suggestion of. Morton's name for the Vice-
Presidency. The truth is that Hanna be
lieves Platt is bluffing as regards the
threatened bolt and therefore he proposes
to stand pat for a time at least.
Mr. Platt has sent fur all the colored
delegates who have been rejected by the
National Committee, and has made them
fair promises of a rehearing for their cases
before the convention. He has thus gath
ered around him a possible following,
which, however, will probably melt away
before the convention meets.
All the hotel corridors bloom with ex
pensive and artistic photographs of the
Pennsylvania Senator, and handsome
Quay badges are on almost every coat
lapel. Mr. Quay has given Platt little
consolation, however, and it. remains to be
seen how much Mr. Platt can accomplish
alone. Platt, despite his defiant attitude,
is by no means irreconcilable, but the price
of his surrender is at present considered too
high by Mr. Hanna. Be?Hes the gold
standard Mr. Platt wants Hanna to notify
the Warner Miller element in New York
that the McKiuley managers regard him
as the legitimate leader of Kew York poli
tics and that all the bitter opposition to
his rule must cease.
Secretly Mr. Hanna is as anxious as
Platt for this very situation, because he
believes the bitter factional fight now rag
ing in the Empire State may jeopardize
the success of the National ticket next
fall. However he will not treat further
with Mr. Platt until that gentleman mani
fests a more amiable frame of mind than
he showed at to-day's brief meeting. Be
sides Hanna will hardly make final terms
with Mr. Platt until the arrival of Mul
holland and the anti-Platt contingent.
John Wise, Horace Porter and Edward
Brookfield, opposition leaders, came in to
night and immediately repaired to the
Hanna headquarters. The New York fight
will come up in tlie National Committee
to-morrow probably and as it progresses
events will develop which will have signi
ficant bearing on the final selection of
either Mr. Morton or Mr. Hobart as Vice-
President. C. C. Carlton.
ON INDIANA'S PATTERN.
The Platform Will Contain a Sound
Money Plank.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12. -The cham
pions of sound money in tne Repuolican
platform gained a notable victory to-day.
A Call correspondent has the best author
ity for saying that Mr. Hanna, on behalf
of the McKinley men, will accept a plank
drawn alter the Indiana platform, but
omitting the iinal words expressing oppo
sition to the free coinage of silver at 16 to
1. The platform will oppose the free coin
age of silver, not only at 16 to 1, but at
any ratio. All day telegr^m^ have been
raining in on Mr. Hanna from bankers
and financiers in the East, demanding
that the platform shall explicitly declare
for a gold standard. To this demand Mr.
Hanna has turned a deaf ear. He insists
that the word "gold" would be obnoxious
to many Republicans. Mr. Hanna con
sented that the final words of the Indiana
platform, -'at the ratio of 16 to 1," should
be stricken out.
Meanwhile it is asserted at thÂ« McKin
ley headquarters that the friends of
McKinley are not drafting any financial
planKs, but will leave the matter entirely
to the Certain it is that the
McKinley forces will strenuously oppose
lighting out the issue on the floor of the
convention. It is their claim, that as they
are sincere in demanding adherence to the
present financial system, the phraseology
of a plank is a mere question of verbiage
and expediency dictates that this detail be
fought out behind the closed doors of the
room of the committee on platform. It
must be remember, d that the constant at
titude of the McKinley men proclaims
that in their estimution entirely too much
prominence is being given the financial
que tion, and that in consequence the
tariff, which is at least of equal import
ance, is being neglected.
It is the wish of the McKinley men that
the tariff and the currency be indissolubly
united. They know that it is impossible
to run both subjects in one and the same
plank, but it is determined that they shall
be at least co-equal. The following state
ment prepared at the headquarters shows
plainly their purpose:
"The closeness with which so many
State conventions have linked protection
and sound money hns suggested the idea
of joining them in like manner in the Na
tional platform. It begins to dawn that
this question is so closely related to that
other great principle sure to be enunciated
in the platform â adequate protection â that
the making of the currency plank need
not, after all, be so difficult.
"Those familiar with the financial his
tory of the country recognize tne fact that
so long as we had adequate protection
and the ample revenue which resulted
there was no difficulty about currency, no
complaint as to its scarcity ana no radical
demand for the extreme addition to it by
unlimited coinage of silver. The fact that
the nomination of Major McKinley means
of itself the certainty of the adoption of a
system of protection and the assurance of
ample revenue will of itself bring about
the conditions in regard to currency which
prevailed when the country liad protec
tion and ample revenue and general pros
perity before. While it is not asbumed
that the mere adoption of a protective
tariff will settle the silver ques
tion, it is telieved that the tariff
plank which will naturally accompany
the nomination of Major McKinley will,
when in operation, bring about such a
condition in the financial affairs of the
Nation as to greatly reduce the demands
for lanre additions to the currency, and
bring back the generally satisfactory con
ditions which existed when a full treasury,
prosperity and ample employment kept at
home and in constant circulation the am
ple supply of currency which this country
has always had. This supply, it may be
remarked incidentally, is greater than that
of almost any country in the world, and
when it is not being drawn away by the
demand* from abroad, which are conse
quent upon a low tariff and insufficient
revenue, it has always proven sufficient to
meet amply the demands of the people."
Tnere is, of course, no Bcheme afoot to
gag the convention or in any way prevent
discussion. It has been suggested to-day
that the adherents of the gold standard
who demand a specific indorsement of
gold by word shall be given an oppor
tunity to test the feeling of tho conven-'
tion, and for that purpose the financial
plank as reported by tne committee Bhall
be worded as they wish. A substitute
drawn on the line already indicated â
namely, the Indiana platform, omitting
the statement of any ratioâ is then to be
offered to the convention, and the dele
gates will thus be given an opportunity to
decide. It is assumed, of course, as a part
of this programme that the majority for
the revised Indiana platform will be so
great that there will be no dancer in D er *
mitting this little comedy. Should there
be any doubt of it no chances will be
taken, and the plank will come from the
committee just as it is to be adopted.
All talk of a bolt on the part of the free
silver element when its financial plank de
manding free silver shall have been re
fused by the convention has died away.
Of all the brave array of Senatorial bolters
who six weeks ago breathed fierce defiance
at every turn only Senator Teller and Sen
ator Dv Bois remain.
Chairman Carter and ail the others an
nounce that they are Republicans first and
free-silver men next. Of all the delegates
from the free-silver Slates none would fol
low Messrs. Teller and Dv Bois. Mr.
Shoup, Senator Dv Boia' colleague, states
that no delegate from Idaho will follow
Dv Bois, and every one of the alternates
to the delegates at large from Colorado
(Senator Teller's State) stands ready and
eager to avail himself of his right to oc
cupy Teller's seat the instant be rises to
leave the hall. C. C. Cablton.
QUAY ON THE SCENE.
Flurry Caused by the Arrival of the
Pennsylvanian.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â The arrival
of Senator Quay of Pennsylvania late this
afternoon stirred into activity the some
what languid political gossip. The Sena
tor was accompanied by his son, Richard
Quay. A number of newspaper men called
at his apartments on the fourth floor of
the Southern Hotel when his presence
there became known. Beyond announc
ing that he was in the Presidential race
and that his name would be presented to
the convention by General Hastings Mr.
Quay declined to be interviewed. He ex
pressed entire ignorance as to what kind
of a platform the convention was likely to
adopt. He also declined to say whether it
was his purpose, as baa been stated by
some of the Pennsylvania delegation, to
transfer the vote of his State from himself
to McKinley when Pennsylvania was
reached on the rollcall, and generally he
manifested to his newspaper callers a
much greater desire to receive than to give
news.
QUAY WILL WITHDRAW.
He Believes McKinley to Be a Sure
Winner.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â An impor
tant conference was held in Senator
Quay's rooms late to-nignt, at which Sen
ator Quay, Mark Hanna, Mr. Hah n % Na
tional committeeman from Ohio, Hobart
of New Jersey. Samuel Fessen
den of Connecticut and W. Andrews
of Pennsylvania were present, and
at which, it is said, it was prac
tically arranged that Mr. Quay should re
tire from the contest for the Presi
dency. He said *the contests which
were now under consideration by
the National Committee were of little
or no consequence, because it was evident
that McKinley already had over 500 un
contested votes, making it evident that
the people demanded his nomination. He
acquiesced in the suggestion that McKin
ley should be nominated by acclamation.
WHAT DUBOIS WILL DO.
An Uncompromising Fight to Be
Made for Silver.
WASHINGTON. D. C, June 12.âSena
tor Dubois of Idaho, who is Senator
Teller's chief lieutenant in the fight for
free silver, will leave to-morrow for St.
Louis, where he will join the Colorado
Senator and the Republican silver men.
"We will make the fight for silver," said
Senator Dubois to-night, "in the commit
tee on resolutions and on the floor of the
convention. If we fail we shall go down
with our colors flying."
"Would a compromise be acceptable to
you?"' was asked.
'â¢The time for compromise is past."
"In theevent of the convention adopt
ing a platform satisfactory to you and the
other silver Republicans what will be your
course?"
"What we will do if the platform does
not declare for silver," responded Mr.
Dubois, "is a matter for the future to de
termine. We will battle for our convic
tions to the bitter end. If the majority is
against us we will act as our best judg
ment dictates."

They will resume their journey to-morrow.
Senator Teller was interviewed for the

"In that event, what will you do?

further than that which is already on rec
ord. When the Republican State Conven
tion of Colorado was in session I tele
graphed home that I did not desire to
go to St. Louis, if but that my party
sent me I would not support a
gold - standard candidate for Presi
dent on a gold - standard platform or
on a platform of doubtful import, or, in
other words, a straddle. Not only did the
convention elect me, but instructed the
other delegates to be governed b/ my ac
tion. I did not like that, because it is
rather embarrassing that other men ehould
be forced to do as I might do."
"Then you will bolt the convention?"
"I did not say anything about that; but
my declaration to the Republicans of Colo
rado is on record, and you can draw what
ever conclusion you please from that."
"Will any of the other silver Senators
from the West refuse to support a gold
standard?"
"Certainly."
"You have no idea that Senator Carter
of Montana, chairman of the National
Committee, will refuse to support the
ticket under such circumstances? 1 '
"Yes, he will, and so will Dubois, Mantle
and Cannon."
SIGNS OF DISRUPTION.
Supporters of H. Clay Evans Are
Not In Harmony.
ST. LOUIS, Ho., June 12.â There are
indications of a disruption in the solid
State support of H. Clay Evans, candidate
for the nomination as Vice - President,
growing out of local friction between the
three sections of Tennessee â east, middle
and west. A meeting of the delegation
will be held to-morrow with a view to set
tling the existing difference. The friction
grows out of the contest fbr a member of
tne National Committee to succeed George
W. Hill, the incumbent. The fight is be
tween the field on one side and the Chat
tanooga candidate, Charles W. Chamber
lain, on the other. Chattanooga now has
the Vice-Presidential candidate, the dele
gate and alternate at large and the chair
man of the State Central Committee. The
friends of four other candidates for Mr.
Hill's place are threatening a bolt from
Evans unless that gentleman and Newell
Saunders, chairman of the State Commit
tee, both of whom, it is claimed, are ac
tively pushing Mr. Chamberlain for Na
tional Committeeman, do not permit the
place to go to some other part of the State.
MISSION OF HASTINGS.
Going: to St. Louis to Present the
Name of Quay.
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 12.â Governor
Hastings and party left here at 9:30 to
night for St. Louis, where the Governor
will present the name of Senator Quay to
the convention as a candidate for the
nomination for the Presidency. The Gov
ernor declared that he was not a candidate
for the Vice-Presidential nomination, but
said that it would not be proper for him
to refuse it before it was offered to him.
He will vote for the gold standard.
NO SUFFRAGE PLANK.
M. H.de Young Not Friendly to the
Women.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â "There will
be no woman suffrage plank in the plat
form," said M. H. de Young of San Fran
cisco to-night. "They have been meeting
in the parlor every day and sent a com
mittee to address our committee, but we
would not see them."
SAYS MCKINLEY IS WISE.
Ex-Governor Flower Admires the
Policy of Silence.
BUFFALO, N. V., June 12.âEx-Gov
ernor Roswell P. Flower arrived in this
city this morning on the steamer North
west and left for Watertown this aiter
noon.
"Wno is your choice for a Democratic
candidate for President?" was asked of
him by a United Prrss reporter.
"No man who would run on a free coin
age of silver platform," was the response.
"You see," continued the ex-Governor,
"Democratic chances this year are not as
glowing as they were four years ago and
candidates are scarce. In fact, there is no
Democratic candidate. It is my opinion
that the Democrats had better wait until
the Republicans finish at St. Louis, and
then when we are all assembled in Chicago
draft a good man, third term being out of
the question, of course."
"What effect will the free-silver agitation
have upon the Democracy?"
"Disastrous," answered Mr. Flower. "It
will hurt the party terribly in the East. I
know Democrais who would rather vote
the Republican ticket than vote for a man
running on a free-silver platform.' 1
"It is said that free silver men will con
trol the Chicago convention."
"If the published estimates are correct
may be they can. Of course my hoi>e and
wish is that they will not. This threaten
ing condition is the only menace *o Dem
ocratic success in New York State this fall.
On State issues the Democrats ought to
carry New York State by 100,000 and they
will, too, providing the questions raised in
the National issues can be kept out."
"What do you think of the attitude of
McKinley in refusing to express himself
on the question of finance?"
"In that respect Mr. McKinley is a very
wise man. What on eaith has he got to
talk for? He is absolutely sure cf tha
nomination. A half dozen more St. Louis
cyclones could not stop it. That being the
case, what has he to gain by talking? He
coulrt only injure himself. He is very
wise in keeping silence and allowing the
Republican platform to talk for him. Of
Course, if he was not sure of the nomina
tion and could gain anything by talking
it would be all right for him to go ahead
and talk."
BEING RE-ENFORCED.
New Yorkers Ready to Fight for
the Platt Delegates.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 12.â 8enator Quay
of Pennsylvania was one of Mr. Platt's
callers this afternoon. The two were
closeted for an hour. When Quay de
parted Platt remarked to a group of news
papermen: "Senator Quay is in the fight
with me to the end." Early 4his evening
Platt received a dispatch which he showed
with much satisfaction to several callers in
his room. It reads as follows:
Albany, X. V., June 12.
T. C. Platt, St. Louis: Five carloads of loyal
New York representatives are on their way to
St. Louis for Morton and sound money.
J. S. Kenyon.
This delegation will arrive to-morrow
afterncon and thus re-enforced the fight
to prevent the unseating of the Platt
men in the New York delegation.
Mr. Platt is quoted as sayinir that
if the National Committee unseats his
delegates he will carry the contest to thÂ«
committee on credentials and if their de
cision be unfavorable it will be continued
on the floor of the convention.
The arrival this evening of Cornelius
Bliss and other New Yorkers gave rise to
the belief that the New York contests,
which had^ been postponed pending their
arrival, would be taken up to-morrow. At
midnight it was still a question whether
they would be reached to-morrow or go
over until Monday.
The Marquette Club of St. Louis to-day
received a reply from Governor Morton of
New York to an inquiry addressed to him
as to whether, in the event of hi 3 election
to the Presidency, he would make any dis
crimination against Roman Catholics.
Governor Morton quotes the explicit
declaration of his letter of acceptance
when nominated for Governor ijs to the
equal rights of all citizens, and adds: "I
still adhere to the views therein expressed
and can only add that if I were charged
with the duty of administering the office
President of the United States I should en
deavor to treat all classes of citizens with
out discrimination as to their religious
belie f.' :

MILHOLLAND HEARD FROM
Loses No Time In Calling Down Mr.
Manley.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 12. -The fol
lowing dispatch, which explains itself,
w is Bent to St. Louis this evening: â 
Joseph H. Manley, Republican National
ittee, St. Louis: One hundred thousand
â 'f New York State, having signed a pe
tition to tne Republican National Committee
ukingfor the nomination of William McKiu
ley for President, a committee of 500 has been
appointed to take this petition to St. Louis by
special train, and a sub-committee of fifty to
present the petition to the convention.
As chairman of the MoKinley State League
organization committee I requested you to
furnish these fifty members of the sub-com
mittee with tickets for admission to the con
vention. The dispatch being a personal one I
was surprised to find that you have given it in
a garbled form to the press, and still more sur
prised that you should characterize it as an im
pertinence. I supposed recent events had dis
pelled the notion at one time entertained by
the members of the Presidential trust that
they could not be approached by the average
citizen through the ordinary channels. Please
pardon this impertinence and give yourself no
trouble about the tickets. They have been
furnished. John F. MilhollÂ£nd,

HEADED FOR ST. LOUIS.
Departure of Delegates From Three
States in Specials.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 12.-The
regular 10 o'clock St. Louis express on
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was dis
patched from the Jersey City depot to
day in two sections, the first going on
schedule time and the second at 10:30
o'clock. The trains carried the Worth
faction from Brooklyn, the Republican
County Committee of this city and the
Platt delegates and a delegation of Repub
lican Aldermen and tneir friends.
Ex-State S nator J. Sloat Fassett occu
pied a chair in the car reserved for the
New York Aldermen, and appeared to be
the star of the aggregation. He was
hailed on all sides as a possible nominee
for Vice-President, altbou h he person
ally favored giving Governor Morton sec
ond place on the ticket if it turns out that
McKinley is the choice of the oonvention.
From the Grand Central station this af
ternoon the Southwestern limited was run
in two sections in order to accommodate
the rush of Republican politicians bound

tains. The cars were decorated with flags
and Danners. One thousand people, who
had gathered on the platform, cheered as
the train started, and there were shouts of
'Stick to your candidate." The enthusi
a-m manifested for Speaker Reed was
great. There are sixty-eight in the party,
includinc Governor Cleaves, ex-Goverr.or

BOIES TO BE NOMINATED.
Evans Says That He Will Be the
Choice or the Democrats.
OTTUMWA, lowa, June 12.â Chairman
S. B. Evans of the lowa Democratic de*le
eation to Chicago was asked this evening
as to his honest opinion regarding the
probable nomination of Horace Boies of
lowa for the Presidency of the United
States. He said: "He will be nominated
without a doubt."
Continuing, he sjud: "So soon as the
nomination of Boies is made there will be
such a movement in his favor headed by
men prominent in great industrial enter
prises that it will startle the machine pol
iticians. It has become imperative in
their opinion to do something to start the
wheels of business and restore industrial
prosperity to the country and to open up
the markets for agricultural products."
NOT AFTER SECOND PLACE.
Speaker Reed Wants the Presi-
dential Nomination or Nothings
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 12.â Aside
from making a call at the White House
to-day to take formal farewell of President
Cleveland upon the close of Congress, and
or at the residence of Representative
Hitt of Illinois, who has been ill for some
time, Speaker Reed remained at the Shore
ham in constant telegraphic communica
tion with friends and managers at St.
Louis. He had no further comments to
make respecting Mr. Manley's celebrated
statement of Wednesday evening.
It was learned tnat Manley's statement
of last night was prepared in response to
Mr. Reed's telegram of inquiry sent yes
terday as to the meaning and cause of his
original statement which caused such a
s< nsation. Friends of the Speaker in St.
Louis wired him that they believed Mr.
Mauley had become panic stricken at the
demonstration made by the partisans of
McKinley at the first meeting of tne Na
tioasl Committee and Mr. Manley's re
gret o*ver this action satisfied them that
"he did not mean it."
The assertion made by Manley and Mur
ray Crane, the latter of Massachusetts, at
.'-t. Louis that the Speaker would notfender
any conditions accept the nomination for
Vice-President was reiterated by his
friends in Washington, so that there need
be no misunderstanding on that point.
The action of the National Committee in
throwing out Reed delegates, especially
from Louisiana, was commented on
with much bitterness by his friends as un
necessary if McKinley had a majority in
the convention, and indefensible in any
view. They were advised that the Texas
anti-McKinley men claiming to be dele
ild probably meet the fate of
1 1Â» - ir Louisiana colleagues.
aker Reed will not go home until
after the convention adjourns, but he may
go to New York on a business trip, which
has been pressing for some days.
FREE SILVER DEMANDED
Governor Evans Says South Caro
lina Is for Tlllman.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 12.â "Bixteen
to one or bust," was the answer Governor
John Gary Evans of Soutn Carolina gave
to-day at the Waldorf Hotel to the ques
tion whether his State would continue to
advocate free silver or not. The Governor
is here on business for his State. In the
course ola conversation with a reporter he
said, in sutostatice: â¢
"South Carolina is for Senator Tillman
for President, and we hope to see him
nominated. He is a strong man, and on
the stump McKinley could not debate with
him at all. The free silver Democrats will
name the ticket in Chicago, and what is
more, it will be elected. All the Southern
and Western States and enough North
western States 'will vote for the free silver
Democratic candidate to elect him. Be
sides the West and South, we shall carry
Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illi
nois. I have calculated that we shall win,
and have fifty-four electoral votes to spare.
It is now a question of the East â the gold
section â against all the rest of the United
States. The Democrats in tbe East and
the Republicans really stand together for
gold, and there is no difference between
them. We do not expect to get the Demo
cratic votes in the East.' 1
In regard to the prosperity of his State
he said that it had increased wonderfully
in factories, and the busy hum of cotton
mills is heard everywhere.

turing industry of importance now has a
representation in this association. Sus

ever, done great injury to the association.
Our business motives and business
methods have impressed themselves on
the business men, and it is now pretty
generally understood that the association
is essentially and wholly a business ai
fair."

ers to Mexico and Robert P. Porter, who
had recently returned from a tour of

soon have his repon ready for publication;
The report of the Mexican committee
wcoJd also soon be ready. A representa
tive has been sent to Denmark to study
the commercial conditions there.
The establishment of oorumercial agen
cies in foreign countries was recom
mended. On July 1 thirty prominent
manufacturers in nearly every department
of trade will- leave in a body for South
America. The association has obtained
concessions from several of the republics
there for permanent warehousing and ex
hibition of American manufactures.
The committee discussed the report of
the president, approved his acts and then

SPAIN CAN NOT SUCCEED.
Sensation Caused in Havana by That
Statement in a Home Paper.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 12.â A Herald
special from Washington says: State De
partment officials are slow to believe the
report that Captain-General Weyler has
any intention of preventing Consul-Gen
eral Lee from visiting American prisoners
in Cuba. Any action by the captain-gen
eral having this in view would call forth a
strong protest to the Spanish Government.
The right of representatives of this Gov
ernment to visit Americans in prison nas
never been questioned, and the adminis
tration would not permit infringement of
it, especially in Cuba.
The frequent capture of Americans and
their imprisonment there especially re
quire the service of Consul officers and the
necessity of the latter talking with their
countrymen.
The authorities say that if any Amer
icans are in confinement in Morro Castle or
any other place held by the Spanish troopÃ
Consul-General Lee has the right to visit
them, and Spain will not be permitted to
controvert it.
A sensation has been caused in Havana
by an editorial in the Diario del Com
mercia, the leading paper of Barcelona.
The subject of the editorial is Senor
Sagasta's statement that the war is an
nually costing Spain 500.000,000 pesetas
and 15,000 soldiers, but that the conflict
may end in two years. The paper says
that the war will never terminate except
with the loss of Cuba, and that both Spain
and Cuba will be ruined.

Hills of Lotting.
LONDON, Eng., June 12.â The fourth
and final sitting of the third congress of
Chambers of Congress of the empire was

adopted by a unanimous vote resolutions
proposed by the Sydney and Melbourne
Chambers of Commerce requesting the
London chamber to arrage a conference
with ship-owners with a view of eliminat
ting certain clauses from the bills of lading,
which are virtually contracts.

new sound signals.
Resolutions proposed by the Newcastle
Chamber were adopted, favoring the aboli
tion of the levying of light dues upon
shipping.
Delegate Arnoldi of Toronto raised a
question of privilege and spoke in support
of Mr. Cockshott's amendment to Sir John
Lubbock's resolution submitted yesterday,
favoring arbitration whenever the awards
were enforceable,. and his criticism of the
United States regarding the action in
Bering Sea and Alabama matters and the
contention that arbitration was useless
unless the awards were enforced.
Mr. Arnoldi quoted the statement made
by the First Lord of the Treasury in the
House of Commons on February 17, 1891,
that a large sum of the Alabama claim
award was still undistributed, but that it
was the poiicy of Great Britain not to ask
for the return of any part of it. Mr. Ar
noldi's remarks were received with cheers.
Mr. Dal}', delegate from the Wiunepeg

merce of the Empire be held in Canada.

Object of the Advance Explained by the
LONDON, Eng., June 12.â 1n the House
of Lordi this afternoon Lord Rosebery
asked if the Premier would explain the
extent and object of the British Egyptian
expedition up the valley of the Nile into
the Soudan.
Lord Salisbury replied that for a long
time the Government had been aware that
sooner or later an expedition into the Sou
dan would be necessary for the purpose of
recovering the territory which Egypt had
lost. Suddenly they were confronted with
the fact tnat the dervishes were menacing
Kassala. The expedition was the decided
upon.
The present objective point of the expedi
tion, he said, is Dongola and its com
mander â General Sir Herbert Kitchener â
has been given a perfectly free hand until
he shall reach and occupy that place. The
occupation of Doncola alone, he added, is
an advantage, and furthermore it is on the
road to Khartoum.

FATAL FIRE IS PITTSBURG.
The Explosion of a Barrel of Oil Causes
Three Deaths.
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 12.â Early this
morning a barrel of oil in the basemeut of
the bakery owned by Kubuegundo Ga
rische on Spring Garden avenue, near Al
leghany street, exploded. Several people
were sleeping in the building and before
they could escape the structure was in
flames. Mrs. Garische, aged 74 years,
leaped from a window and was killed in
stantly. The firemen found Mr. Garische
unconscious. A grandchild was found
dead in a crib and another child will
probably die. Mrs. Garische Jr. and two
other occupants of the house escaped.
No one seems to he abie to explain the
cause of the explosion. Garische was a
quiet sort of a man and apparently had no
enemies who would be likely to take re
venge on him tn so fiendish a manner.
The fire spread very rapidly. The firemen
were heroic in their efforts to save life.
They could have carried out Mrs. Garische
safely if she had waited just a few minutes
longer. She became panic stricken, bow
ever, and jumped from the window. Mr.
Garische was overcome by the smoKe and
at last accounts it is not believed that he
will recover.

ROBBED BY A BIGAMIST.
Rebecca Slack ' Lone* Her Fortune and
Her Husband.
LOS ANGELES, Cal , June 12.â Rebecca
Black, a widow who formerly resided in

DUNHAM IS SAFE
ON MEXICAN SOIL
The Campbells Fugitive
Crosses the Southern
Boundary.
BAFFLES HIS PURSUERS.
He Begs for Food at Mammoth
Tank, on the Colorado
Desert.
IDENTIFIED FROM PICTURES.
Positive Statement of a Man Who
Fed and Clothed a Hunted
Stranger.
MAMMOTH TANK, Cal., June 12.â
Murderer Dunham is now across the Mex
ican border, secure from pursuit. He was
seen in this oasis of the desert over a week
ago and has had plenty of time to make
his way to the boundary and across. The
person who saw Dunham is a Southern
Pacific employe, well known to Southern
California railroad men. He is opposed to
what he considers unpleasant notoriety in
connection with the case and would con
sent to give to The Call a complete
account of his encounter with the Camp
bells butcher only on a pledge that his
name should not be used in connection
with the story. However, he is ready to
give the authorities all the information in
his possession.
"Several days ago," said he, "I received
a Call containing a likenes3 of Dunham.
I recogriized it at once as that of a man
who stopped at Mammoth Tank on the
night of June 3. It is a gift I have
that when I once see a face I never forget
it, as I have proved on two occasions since
coming to California â meeting persons I
had known as boys and recognizing them !
at once, although I had not met them fpr
thirty years. They did not remember me
until 1 brought certain things to their j
recolleciion. This iB why lam so positive j
about this man, if this is a true picture of j
him.
"The stranger came to the side of my
house and asked for something to eat. I
could not see him, as it was a dark night,
and I told him to go around to the front
door, which he did, and stepped inside.
He tried to hide his face, and a more piti
able looking object I never saw. His
clothes were all in tatters and his hat,
which was a dark soft hat, was very
shabby. His coat also was black and his
shoes were well worn. He said that if we
had anything left over from supper he
would like to have something to eat, as he
had not eaten anything in two or three
days, and I noticed he was very weak and
scarcely able to walk. I told him to go
around to the side door and gave him a
box to sit on. I started to get him a sup
per of fried bacon, coffee and crackers.
He wanted to eat the bacon raw, but 1 did
not wish him to. I thought he must have
been awfully hungry. I handed him out
some crackers until I had supper ready for
him.
"He ate a hearty supper of bacon and
eges and drank two large bowls of coffee.
1 gave him some crackers in a paper bag
and n can of corned beef to take with him.
I also gave him a shirt and two pairs of
socks and a light spring overcoatâ as it
was quite cool â and offered him a black
derby I was not using, but it was too
small for him. I never snw a man mqje
profuse in thanks. He almost broke
down.
"I had a good look at him, and my
wife remarked that the man looked
hunted, as if some one was pursuing him.
She said: "He must have been up the
mountains somewhere, as his clothes are
all in tatters.' He was very polite, and
spoke like a man of some education. My
wife said: 'There is something wrong
with that man. He is no ordinary tramp.'
I said to her: 'I think it looks like Dun
ham, who murdered a whole lamily'; and
I went and got a paper and examined the
likeness; but the picture looked too hard
for the man who had just left, and after
talking it over awhile we dismissed the
supposition. I s .V^V'
"I asked him which way he was travel
ing and he said 'Toward Los Angeles.' I
have reason to believe he was going East
and went to Yuma on a freight train a
few hours later. He went in that direc
tion when he left, although he told me he
was going west.
"When I got The Call of June 4 I was
at once positive that I had entertained
Dunham unawares. The picture of the
murderer that it contained did not at all
resemble those published soon after the
murder, but it was an exact likeness of
the man whom my wife and I had fed and
clothed. I am convinced the man was
Dunham. I had been away from home
for a few days and it was only yesterday
that I saw this picture. I happened to
pick up a Call and saw the picture, and it
was such a good likeness that I made up
my mind to at once inform The Call
that it might send a correspondent to get
this information."
Mammoth Tank is on the Colorado
Desert, about fifty miles from the Yuma
reservation and that distance from the :
Mexican line. How Dunham could have I
got this far from Campbells in less than a
week is a difficult problem to solve. The
story here given, if its author was not
mistaken, bears out the theory that Dun
ham was hastening toward the border
while posses were still chasing up and
down Mount Hamilton.

PURSUED BY POSSES.
Adventures of a Bicyclist Who Me- i
sembles Dunham.
WOODLAND, Cal., June 12.â The resi- ;
dents of Knig ,ts Landing were thrown !
into a state of excitement yesterday by a
report that a man on a bicycle, answering
the description of Dunham, the Santa ;
Clara murderer, had crossed the railroad
bridge at an early hour and had proceeded
in the direction of Woodland. Several
persons were positive that the man was i
Dunham, claiming he answered the de- |
scriftion in every way. The Woodland j
officials were notified to be on the alert for !
wheelmen.
The stranger arrived in this city about 8
o'clock and stopped at the Hotel Julian,
where he registered as Frank K. Hastings
of Massachusetts.
A Call correspondent called on Mr.
Hastings and ascertatnel that he was a
solicitor for an Eastern house and was
making a tour of the State on a bicycle.
"How about your answering the de
scription of Dunham?" queried the re
porter.
"I must resemble the murderer to some
extent, for since the tragedy I have been
stopped four or live times, ' he replied.
"Just this morning, while crossing the
bridge at Knights Landing, I heard several
parties remark that I was Dunham, and I
suppose the fact has been communicated
to this city.
"My first experience," continued Mr.
Hastings, "was while on my way from San
Jose to Hollister, a couple of days after
the murder. I passed through Gilroy and
a short while afterward a posse was fol
lowing me. I kept in the lead of them to
Hollister, where I put up at a hotttl. After
changing my clothes I appeared in the
office of the hotel and a party of twelve
men ordered me to throw up my hands. I
did so, but was released in a short while,
after proving my identity. Afterward I
went to San Jose and on several occasions
the officers called me to a halt.
"I do hope they will capture Dunham
soon, as it places a man in a very peculiar
position who has the misfortune to resem
ble the murderer, and it is not comfortable
to have several armed men following yon
all the time."
Fruitless Search at San Miguel.
SaN MIGUEL, Cal., June 12.â The
rumor that Dunham was caught after a
hard fight in the Willows this morning is
without foundation. Matthews, Lyndon
and posse, after being out all night, re
turned this morning and went to San Jose.
Constable Dosh is searchine in this
vicinity. Jailer Charles Gardner and
Pres Rives, a Gilroy constable, arrived
to-day. They, â¢ with Constable Ganoung,
went to see Mrs. Journey on the Flint
ranch. Sho is the woman who was
stopped by a stranger, who begged for
food. They still believe they are on the
right track.
Columbia Rirer Rising.
PORTLAND, Ob., June 12.â The Colum
bia River is spreading over its banks and
is beginning to inundate farming districts
on the lowlands. Telegraph wires are
being swept down, and the Western Union
Company is experiencing some difficulty
in maintaining its service to the coast.
The gauge of river at Portland is 21.2 feet.
There is much snow in the mountains, and
very high water is expected as a result of
the warm weather if it continues a few
days longer;
PROBING THE TAGUS PLOT
Strong Network of Evidence
Woven Around Silas
Lovren.
The Prosecution Coses Its Case in the
Trial of the Train-Robber
Suspect.
VISALIA, Cal., June 12.â The trial of
Silas Lovren is drawing to a close. The
last witness for the prosecution testified
this afternoon and the case went over
until to-morrow. It is not known how
the defense will proceed in its attempt to
prove that the proprietor of the notorious
deadfall was not the arch-conspirator in
the plot to rob the Southern Pacific over
land express at Tagus on the night
of March 18; that he did not plan the
raid which cost the life of Dan McCall â a
brave man, thoueh a menace to society.
Tbe prosecution has made a strong case,
and it will take convincing evidence to
break the chain of guilt it has woven
around the saloonist.
Deputy Sheriff Victor Reed, who, with
Earl Daggett, was wounded in defending
tne train which McCall boarded, was the
first witness called to-day, he simply
identifying the rifle carried by McCall,
and which, the prosecution claims, was
owned by Lovren. Deputy Sheriff D. O.
Harrelson told tlie story of the officers' trip
to Tulare and of finding the body of Mc-
Call. He said :
"On the Sunday before the hold-up I
went out to the Tagus country about the
middle of tbe day. At a point north of
the Mill Creek crossing of the railroad,
between Tagus and Goshen, 1 found a
newspaper. I was expecting to find it.
1 nad instructions that morning to follow
Britt and McCall, who left Visalia about 1
o'clock in tne afternoon. This newspaper
was found near two trees, and this spot
was not far (seventy rods) from where
McCall's dead body was afterward picked
up."
The witness pointed ont the place where
the body of McCall was found, using a
map of that part of the railroad track be
tween Tagus and Goshen. He also showed
the place Wi.ere the marked paper had
been droppe.l by Britt the Sunday before
the attempted robbery. Britt, the be
trayer of the outlaw's plot, had deposited
the paper at the soot selected by McCall
for boarding the train.
The balance of the testimony was in the
nature of identification of McCall's mask,
lantern and weapons and establishing the
connection of Lovren witn the telltale
articles.

GRAND PARLOR'S LABORS END.
Services at tbe Grave of the Lato
Grand Marshal Evelyn
Packard.
NAP A, Cal., June 12.â The Grand Par*
lor of the Native Daughters of the Golden
West completed its labors in this city this
afternoon with the installation of the
grand officers elected Thursday evening.
Before the morning session the Grand.
Parlor went to Tuiocay Cemetery and.
neld a short memorial service at the grave
of Evelyn Packard, the deceased grand
marshal. A choir sang the funeral ode of
the order, and Mrs. Lillian Carlie of La
Estrella Parlor, San Francisco, sang "Flee
as a Bird." The prayer and benediction
were read by Past Grand President C. K.
Wittenmeyer of Ramoan Parlor, Martinez.
A beautiful mantle of flowera was spread
upon the grave, and the parlor then re
turned to town.
The morning session was consumed in
exemplifying the new ritual. The reports
of the various committees were adopted.
The first order in the afternoon was the
installation. Past Grand President Miss
E. A. Spencer of Occident Parlor, Eureka,
installed the officers. Mrs. Lillian Carlie,
in behalf of the Grand Parlor, presented
Miss Bertola with a jeweled pin bearing
the insignia of the order. A resolution
thanking the people of Napa, the local
parlors of Native Sons and Native
Daughters, the asylum physicians and
the press for hospitality and favors ex
tended was adopted. When the Grand
Parlor adjourned it was out of respect to
the memory of Evelyn Packard.
The ball this evening, given by Napa
Parlor of Native Sons in honor of the
Grand Parlor, was the most brilliant social
event ever held in Napa County. The
Maple Hall rink was elaborately decorated
and the adjoining lot was converted into
a miniature forest, lighted by colored elec
tric lamps. Here lemonade and cake were
served between the dances. The grand
march was led dv Frank L. Coombs and
Miss Lillie O. Reichling, the founder of
the order.

JOSEF BLITHER'S
OREGON CAREER
Washington County Records
Prove That He Was
a Bigamist.
KNOWN AS ROBERT FIGI
One of His Wives Secured a
Divorce A'ter Learning of
His Duplicity.
StRVED TIME IN PRISON.
Convicted in Wisconsin of Wedding
More Frequently Than the
Law Allows.
PORTLAND, Or., June 12.â A press dis
patch published several days ago stated
that Josef Blanther, the alleged Austrian
nobleman, who early last month murdered
Mrs. P. Langfeldt in San Francisco and is
now a fugitive from justice, at times went
by the name of Robert Figi. This an
nouncement has enabled local officials to
shed some light upon the early career of
the murderer, and the records of the
Washington County Circuit Court pro
claim him a bigamist as well as a butcher
of women.
Hon. Thomas Tongue on the 30th of
June, 1894, began divorce proceedings at
Hillsboro, in the Circuit Court for Wash
ington County, for Mrs. Bertha Figi
against Robert Figi. Mrs. Figi's maiden
name had been Schoen. She wedded Figi
in Oregon City on the 18th of April of that
year and her complaint was based upon
the fact that the defendant had three or
four wives living, from none of whom be
had been divorced. Mrs. Figi set up in
her complaint that these facts became
known to her subsequent to her marriage.
Strangely enough, in view of these facts,
Figi appeared to defend the suit. He
acknowledged having been married in
Switzerland, but claimed he was divorced
from his European wife. Figi made the
absurd statement, foolishly expecting the
court to accept it as veracious, that his
father appeared in a Swiss court as the
plaintiff in the defendant's divorce case
and obtained a decree.
During the further hearing of the Wash
ington County case it was shown that Figi
had served a term in the Wisconsin peni
tentiary for bigamy. This evidence was
supplied in the form of a deposition by an
uncle of Figi residing in Monroe, Wis.
Mr*. Figi obtained the relief she sought,
but Figi escaped criminal prosecution in
Washington County and then disappeared.
Attorney C. E. Kindt, who discovered
these facts, says that the published de
scription of Blanther tallies identically
with that supplied by the Wisconsin au
thorities, even to his military bearing and
eyeglasses. Figi was an educated man,
and was familiar with several languages;
so also in Blanther. The murderer of Mrs.
Langfeldt is known to have been in the
United States for ten years at least,
which is ample time for him to have ac
complished all the rascalities with which
be is charged. It is certain that Figi and
Blanther are one and the same man.
Theodore H. Liebe of the Oregon Ger
man Bakery says that, up to a year ago,
he had Robert Figi in his employ as clerk
for a period of six months. This man had
a decided military air and was highly edu
cated, and never spoke of his past life.
Liebe regarded him as an exceedingly im
moral and dangerous man. The descrip
tion Liebe gives of his ex-clerk tallies
with that of Blanther.
BLANTHER'S EUROPEAN RECORD.
Whtn a Very Young Man He Received the
Decoration of the Iron
Crown.
LONDON, Eng., June 13.â A Vienna
digpatch to a news agency says:
The newspapers have just obtained the
story of Joseph Blanther, formerly a lieu
tenant in tbe Austrian army, who is sus
pected of having murdered Mrs. Philopene
Langfeldt of San Francisco last month.
Details regarding his military career
show that at the age of 19 he served in the
Austrian army of occupation in Bosnia
and Herzegovina in 1878, and with his
company defended the position of a bat
tery of artillery against a superior force of
insurgents. Of the company and battery,
Blanther and one sergeant escaped injury,
all the others were killed or wounded. For
this he received the, order of the Iron
Crown.
This was the first instance in which ao
young an officer was decorated with this
order.
Later, at a review of the Vienna Garri
son, Blanther was presented to King
Humbert of Italy, and received from the
latter the order of the Italian Crown.
Blanther was compelled to leave the

army in 1886 owing to his heavy debts,
and went to the United States. His
mother has not heard fr.>m him since.
COLUMBIA RIVER COMBINE.
Salmon Canners Will Consolidate Their
Interests as a Result of the
Strike.
PORTLAND, Or., June 12.â A gigantic
salmon combine, to take in every interest
on the Columbia River into one corpora
tion and backed by unlimited capital, will
very probably be the unlooked for result
of the present strike of 3000 fishermen who
want more for fish than the packers are
willing to pay. The prospects are that the
Columbia River Packers' Association,
which was formed in Portland last spring,
is to be followed by a stronger concern â a
single corporation which shall be so firmly
intrenched as to command a vast influence
in the salmon industry and which will dic
tate and not be dictated to. It will be
modeled after the Alaska Packing Com
pany and it will absorb ail the big and lit
tle fishing interests, consolidating them
into one enormous plant.
One of the wealthiest canners on the
Columbia declares that the strike has
hastened this end. The cannery men are
being driven into consolidation for the
protection of their interests, not only from
the fishermen but from the mischievous
State Legislature, and by next autumn it
is be ieved the combine will be orsanized
and the consolidation effected. The com
bine's lobby will be a factor in the State
Leg slature this winter and will endeavor
to influence the law-makers to legislate in
the interests of the fishiiiL' industry.
FISHERMEN ARE OBDURATE.
Refute to Confer With an Arbitration
Committee.
ASTORIA, Wash., June 12.â This was
expected to have been the deciding day of
the fishermen's strike, but again action
was deferred. The Fishermen's Union
still demands 5 cents a pound for the
season's catch.
The Chamber of Commerce committee
submitted a proposition from the cannery
men to pay 4}4 cents. This was rejected,
as was a previous offer of the Scandinavian
cannery to pay 5 cents. The latter rejec
tion was at the request of the fishermen in
the employ of this cannery, as they did
not desire to work unless all went in on
the same basis.
When the Chamber of Commerce com
mittee requested that it be allowed to ap
pear and discuss the situation admission
was refused by an almo-t unanimous vote.
Subsequently the committee from the
Chamber of Commerce issued the follow
ing call for a meeting:
To the Publicâ As a committee appointed by
the Chamber of Commerce we have been labor
ing the last two days to bring about a settle
ment of the existing difficulties between the
fishermen and packers. We received from the
packers a proposition to pay 4^ cents a pound.
The union declined to allow us to appear at
its meeting to present the proposition. We
find there are many men who wish to fish at
this price, and we therefore hereby ask the
businessmen of this cltv to assemble in mats
meeting on Saturday, June 13, at 10 o'clock
a. m. at the Courthouse to discuss the situa
tion.
To-day no trouble has been reported
from any part of the Columbia River.
SONOMA GAYLY GARBED
Bright Colors Donned by the
Town of Bear-Flag
Fame.
New Feature Added to the Pro
gramme for tbe Celebra
tion of To-Day.
SONOMA, Cal., June 12.â Not even
when a circus comes to town does Sonoma
get as cay as she has in this, the week
I preceeding the Bear-flag celebration. It
was believed yesterday that the town was
fully decorated, but the work of twenty
four hours has wrought a great change.
The three arches have been completed,
and altogether the old city presents a gala
appearance.
An addition to to-morrow's programme
has been made. J. F. Finkham, marshal
of the Territorial Pioneer Society, will
read the original proclamation declar
ing California independent. This will fol
low soon after the introductory remarks
of President of the Day H. C. Gesford;
j grand president of the Native Sons of the
Golden West.
Several pioneers are already on the
scene. Among these are Major E. A.
Sherman, who will be grand marshal of
the parade, and Benjamin Dewell, one of {
the three men now living who took part !
in the Bear Flag revolution. He arrived i
here last night from Upper Lake, Lake I
County, having had to stage twenty-eight
miles of the journej-.
The old gentleman has a keen memory,
and speaks entertainingly about the event
of 1846, declaring that Bis party was made j
up not of marauders and cntthroats, i
|as the historian, Bancroft, has said, j
but of peaceable citizens, whose lives j
had been threatened by the Mexican au
tboritles, and who surrounded General j
Vallejo, then retired from active service, |
and took possession of tbe pueblo, Know- i
ing that it contained arms and amrauni
tion.
Dewell is now 75 years of age. He was
one of the three men who made the orig- !
iiial Bear Flag. His wife and her father j
and mother were also in Sonoma at the
time. His father-in-law. William B.
Elliott, discovered the Geysers in this j
county, was the first white man in i
that wild and deep mountain gorge.
The committee had expected to have !
William Potter of Potter Valley attend the
celebration as one of the survivors of the |
flaz-raising. Inquiry for him, however, j
revealed the fact that he had died in Mid
land, Tex., on the 18th day of last April. I
As far as could be learned Mr. Potter's j
body was interred at the place of his
death.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 12. â To
pleasure-seekers of every clime, race or
creed, Santa Cruz bids welcome to her
water fete. The lame, the blind, the un
fortunate who seeing, hear not, will here
find pleasure they had not known before;
for though the ear be palsied there will be
feasts to delight the vision; and for the
sightless sweet strains of matchless music
will make amends for the cruel touch tiiat
robbed them of the li ht of day. Great
will be Santa Cruz's carnival on the sleepy
San Lorenzo. AI! is not quite ready for
the Queen's herald to announce the open
i ing of his sovereign's court, but two more
long days will suffice for the final touches
upon arch and barge.
The arena and the Queen's throne were
lighted again to-night, and the illumina
j tion will be continued, in order that no
j part of the machinery be out of order on
| the opening night of the carnival. The
I scene attracts a large number of spectators
I to the banks of the San Lorenzo.
The work of decoration goes forward
rapidly. By Tuesday the town will be a

mass of carnival colors. Great enthusi
siasm is manifested. Visitors from other
towns are coming in large numbers daily.
These include of course many who intend
to spend the summer here.
Every detail of arrangement is made so
that the big show might be launched on
Monday instead of Wednesday, the day
announced. The fact is that Monday will
really be the opening day of the carnival,
although Monday is not considered in the
programme. On that day the Monadnock
and Philadelphia will arrive, and Admiral
Beardslee will be met aboard the Philadel
phia by Mayor Clark, chairman of the
reception committee, and a number of
prominent citizens. A delegation of citi
zens will visit the warships after the re
ception committee shall have paid its
visit.
The newspaper representatives will on
Tuesday be received at headquarters,
where they will be met by William Ray
mond, formerly city editor of the Surf,
who is secretary of the press committee.
The newspaper men, reporters and artists
are to be given the freedom of the carni
val, and will no*, be restricted in the cour
tesies extended. The association has ex
pressed its gratitude to the press of San
Francisco and the interior for the courte
sies extended to Santa Cruz and the carni
val.
The carnival will open in earnest on
Wednesday, and much is in anticipation
as concerning the special feature for that
day â the battle of Bunker Hill. Chairman
Lamb's arrangements are complete for
that, as well as for the mimic battle be
tween the Monitor and Merrimac, the lat
ter gunboat being now ready for occupancy
by the representatives of the Confederate
forces.
CAUSE OF VICTORIA'S DISASTER.
The Consolidated Railway Company Held
Responsible for the Loss of Many
Lives.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 12.â After care
ful investigation into the circumstances of
tbe recent Point Ellice bridge disaster, the
Coroner's jury to-day returned a verd.ct
holding the Consolidated Railway Com
pany directiy responsible for the loss of
fifiy-tive lives.
Ihe City Council was arraigned as
guilty of contributory negligence, and the |
officials of the corporation were absolved
oi personal responsibility.
It was found that the bridge was safe for
ordinary traffic and the uccident would not
have occurred but for improper over
crowding of the car, which went through
tbe structure; but the bridge was tound
not to have been constructed according to
original specifications.

LOS ANGELES, <al., June 12.â Judge
Smith has granted to Mr:.. M. B. Goldson
a divorce from her husband, W. H. Gold

Mr. Goldson some time ago brought suit
against his wife for divorce. She filed her
suit in Los Angeles, obtained service and
won a decree.
FRESNO STREET AFFRAY.
A San Francisco Solicitor Terribly Beaten
Because of an Alleged Insult to
a Woman.
FRESNO, Cal., June 12.â J. G. Ramer,
who travels for the Bancroft Company of
San Francisco, was beaten in a terrible
manner with a sluneshot in the bands of
Charles Norris of this city this afternoon.
The beating took place on the corner of J
and Mriposa streets, and caused great ex
citement.
Deputy Sheriff Timmins attempted to
arrest Norris and was assaulted by Wil
liam Ball, an actor, who was stranded in
Fresno a few weeks ago when the Rose
Stillman theatrical company disbanded.
Timmins had jerked the slungshot from
Norris' hand when he found himself at
tacked from the rear. He wheeled and
struck Bell with the slungshot and
knocked him down.
A policeman came to his assistance and
Norris and Bell were taken to jail, and
Ramer, covered with blood, was taken
away for surgical treatment.
The reason given for the assault is that
Ramer had insulted a sister of Norris.
She told her brother of the insult, and he
loaded a piece of hosepipe and hunted for
Ramer, whom he probably disfigured for
life.
Fatal Accident at Lodi.
LODI, Cal., June 12.â Lewis Durbin, an

started to run away. Durbin attempted
to grasp the lines but fell beneath the
wheel-, which passed over his head, crush

BID SANTA CRUZ ADIEU
State Dentists Conclude Their
Labors in the City by the
Sea.
President Cool Presides at a Fare
well Banquet Tendered the
Visitors.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 12.-The
twenty-sixth annual convention of the
California State Dental Association ad
journed to meet at San Jose in June or
July, 1898, the exact date to be fixed here
after. There will be no convention of the
State Dental Association in 1897, as the
first annual meeting of the Pacific Coast
Dental Congress will be held next sum
mer.
This morning's session was devoted to
clinics tnat were very interesting and in
structive, from a professional view. The
papers read to-day were passed without
discussion. Dr. P. H. Metcalf of Sacra
mento read a report on "Dental Educa
tion." Dr. L. Van Orden. gave a thirty
minutes' talk on "A Non-Partisan Con
sideration of Amalgam Alloys and Gold as
Filling Materials." He also read a paper
on "Milk of Magnesia." Dr. A. H. Sugget
of Marysville sent a paper on "Treatment
of Pulpless Teeth," which was read by Dr.
Emma T. Reed of San Diego.
The inauguration of the new officers was
attended by the jolly ceremony customary
with the association. Each officer-elect
was conducted around the hall, while the
members sang "'He's a jolly good fellow,"
and was then presented for introduction.
On assuming the chair Dr. Cool, the new
president, said:
"It is with feelings of mingled gratitude
and pride that I speak to-day in acknowl
edging the great honor you have conferred
upon me in electing me president of this
association. This installation comes to
me to-day as a birthday present and it is
the best one I have ever received. The
convention about to close is one of which,
I think, we may all be justly proudâ both
on account of its uersonneland of the re
sults accomplished. It is, indeed, a meas
ure <f the value of this meetin / when such
members of the old guard as Drs. Sicnel,
Lundborg, Hacket, Gilmore and others,
who have jjroivn gray in the service, have
deemed it worth their jvbile to surrender
professional cares at home for a time and
to lend tlie convention the dignity and
benefit which their presence implies.
"We are to ba congratulated upon the
fact that our deliberations have been pre
sided over by a man of such grace and
dignity and sterling ability as has been
shown by Dr. Hays. He has been truly
an ideal president and it me no small
uneasiness when I think that I >hall have
the task of trying to live ud to the high
standard maintained by him. |
"In regard to my administration I have
but little to say and no promises to make.
Promises that never bear the fruition of
penormance are out idle things; there
fore I will endeavor to impress you by
what I shall do in the future, rather than
by what I promise to-day. I thank you a 1
from the bottom of my heart for this great
honor. My constant endeavor will be to
prove worthy of it."
Dr. Hays, in retiring from the chair,
asked that the members accept his sincere
thanks for the honor conferred one year
ago. The mantle of authority had not
borne heaviiy on his shoulders because of
the hearty co-operation of the members,
whicti transformed it into a mantle of
pleasure.
The visiting dentists and friends were
to-night entertained by the local dentists
a a banquet presided over by President
Cool.
CRAIG HANGED IN
FOLSOM PRISON
Displays No Fear as He
Mounts the Gallows
Stairway.
TRIUMPH OF THE LAW.
Seli-Inflicted Wounds Would Soon
Have Cheated ths
Hangman.
SAD PUNCTUEED HIS HEART.
An Infatuated Fern tie Clams the
Body â The Murderer's
Crime.
SACkAMENTO, Cal., June 12â John
Craig, who so nearly cheated the gallows
yesterday by stabbing himself with a
weapon made of a piece of wire, was
hanged at Folsom to-day. He met death
with the greatest coolness and fortitu ie.
He displayed not the slightest symptoms
of fear when, in company with his guards,
he stepped from his ceil door at 10 o'clock,
and he took the three or four steps neces
sary to react the floor of the gallows with
out any assistance. Excepting for a pale
ness, which could well be attributed to the
severity of his self-inflicted wound, be was
apparently unconcerned over tbe realiza
tion that his time had come to die.
As the doomed man stepped upon the
trap he cast a rapid elance over the up
turned faces of those who had gathered to
view a fellow-mortal launched into eter
nity, until it rested upon the person of his
brother-in-law, Joseph Hunter, who had
come to see the last of the murderer of his
father, mother and sister. On seeing
Hunter Craig gave a sudden start, and
then, fixing his eyes upon him, he slowly
and clearly said, in a voice tinged with the
deepest sarcasm:
"Oil, Joe, I love you."
A second later his body shot through
the trap, and the old biblical law, "He
who sheds man's blood, by man shall his
blooa be shed," was fulfilled.
After shooting through the trap, the
body barely quivered, and eleven minutes
later the physicians pronounced Craig
dead. After the body was cut down an
autopsy disclosed the fact that the mur
derer's heart had been slightly punctured
in three places by his wire weapon yester
day, but not to a sufficient depth to insure
instant death, although physicians ex
pressed the opinion that he could not have
lived longer than two days.
Craig's body was afterward conveyed to
the train and brought to an undertaking
establishment in this city. It will be in
terred here to-morrow. It is said that a
female admirer of the dead man, who be
came infatuated with him after his arrest
and who visited him a few days before his
execution, afterward begging for the body,
is paying the funeral expenses. On her
application for admittance to visit the
doomed man the gentleman who accom
panied her was plainly informed by War
den Aull that she would be granted a fif
teen minutes' interview with Craig, if she
in reality had any business to transact,
but tnat no sickly sentimentality would
be allowed. It is Hinted that by her con
nivance Craig obtained the weapon with
which he so nearly ended his life, but lit
tle faith is placed in this rumor.
The crime for which Craig suffered the
extreme penalty of the law was a sangui
nary butchery. Its atrociousness was in
tensified by the fact that those whom he
slew had been bound to him by the ties of
marriage.
On the evening of July 25, 1894, Craig,
who had been but a few months separated
from his wife, the latter having procured
a divorce because of his dissipated habits,
drove to the Hunter ranch near Tropico,
where Mrs. Craig was living in quietude
with her three young children and her
brother, George Hunter. He arrived at 7
o'clock and Mrs. Craig told her brother not
to allow him to enter the house.
The front door was locked and Craig
went to the back door just as Hunter
came out. Without warning Craig raised
his revolver and fired, the ball hitting
Hunter In the right cheek, wounding him
seriously.
Mrs. Craig was close behind her brother
and the now enraged man turned the re
volver on her. The bullet struck her in
the left eye causing instant death. Craig
jumped over the bodies of his victims and
rushed into the house in search of his
children, whom he evidently intended to
kill. The servant girl, however, had man
aged to get them a safe distance from the
house and his search was unsuccessful.
Craig then fled from the house and
jumping into his carriage drove to the
home of his wife's father and mother, Mr.
and Mrs. William Hunter, who resided on
Bnena Vista street in the suburbs of Los
Angeles. When Craig drove up the de
fenseless old couple were sitting on the
porch enjoying the evening air. Craig ap
proached and drew his revolver. His
father-in-law jumped from his chair and
rushed toward the frenzied man, but be
fore he reached him a bullet from Craig's
revolver struck him in the right side and
he fell dead. Mrs. Hunter attempted to
jump over the bannister when a shot
struck her in the left side and she expired
in a second.
After his frightful butchery he attempted
to kill himself, but only inflicted a slight
scalp wound.
The murderer's only defense was that
his victims were working against him and
a gauzy story that William and George
Hunter were conspiring to kill him. He
was tried on but one charge, that of mur
dering his wife, on which he was convicted
and sentenced to death.
WHO STRUCK MR. JOHNSON?
He Charges Tramps With the Deed, but a
Detective Accuses Mrs.
Johnson.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 12.â Word
was received at the police station early
this morning that Charles Johnson, the
night bridge-tender in charge of the rail
road bridge across the Sacramento River,
had been attacked by two tramps, who
clubbeJ him to insensibility and left him
for dead, after robbing him of 15 cents. It
was claimed that on recovering his senses
Johnson crawled home, informed his wife
and fell in a faint.
The wounded man was conveyed to the
railroad hospital and his wounds, consist
inÂ» of sixteen small cuts and abrasions of
the scalp, were dress d. When Johnson
recovered his senses, he stated that arly
in the even ng he observed two tramps
following two women across the bridge
and ordered them to leave. When lie
spoke to them the men ran away. They
returned at 3 o'clock in the morning and
knocked on the door of the electric-motor
house. Johnson opened the door, and the
men instantly assaulted him.
Johnson said that just before his senses

men suggest that he be thrown off tbe
bridge into tbe river, but tbe larger man
objected. He gave a good description of
the men, which tallied with that of two
persons who had been observed in the
vicinity, and Railroad Detective Ahem
found that Newton Tripp. a dairyman,
had seen two men running off the bridge
about the time Johnson claims to have
ordered them away from the women.
An ex-police detective, who has been
working on the case, gives a different ver
sion of tbe affair. He claims to have dis
covered that Johnson and his wife have
had several quarrels and that a divorce was
talked of. He claims that Johnson had
been drinkiug heavily during the evening
and that at about 2 o'clock the wife went
to see that her husband was on duty, and
probably found him asleep. On awaken
ing a rough-and-tumble tight ensued, dur
ing which Johnson's head was cut against
the lever of the electric motor. After
Johnson was overcome he was helped
home by his wife, and after agreeing upon
their story she sent word to the police.
SOME DAMAGE BY FROST.
Condition of Crop* in Various Section*
of the State.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 12.â At the
meeting of the State Horticultural Society
this afternoon G. W. Hinckley of Winters
reported that in his district, the earliest
apricot section of the State, the crops west
of the town were heavy, while to the north
and east they had been entirely destroyed
by frosts. Langford of Lodi reported full
crops of all fruits except grapes in his lo
cality, the grapevines having been injured
by frosts. He spoke at length on the sub
ject of spraying with salt, sulphur and lime
for curl leaf, and gave his experience in the
mixing of the decoction.
Robert Williamson reported that crops
adjacent to Sacramento were only fair,
and stated that, contrary to the usual
order of things, in the lowest spots where
the frost generally strikes, and where wet
weather usually affects the fruit most,
there are now the heaviest crops. He said
that there appeared to be fewer worms in
the apples this year than ever before, the
extended cold spell having killed the
spring brood of codlin moths.

AT SACRAMENTO
Novel Features Arranged
by the Agricultural
Directors.
LAUNCH AN INNOVATION
Purses to Be Paid on Each Eeat
of Tro tin? and Pacing
Events.
PREMIUMS FOR THE IXHIBITS-
New Departments in Which Handsome
Awards Will Be Offered for
Competition.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jnne 12.â The |
State Agricultural directors met to-day to I
rearrange the premium list and adopt a
speed programme for tne coming State
fair. The speed programme, as agreed
upon, provides for eight days trotting and
pacing and nine days running.
The trotting and t>acing purses range in
value from $800 to $1200. For trotters are
provided 2:40, 2:lÂ£, 2:30, 2:35,2:24,2:15,
2:19, 2:17, 2:10 and 2:20 class races; for I
pacers 2:27 and 2:25 class events, and for
three-year-olds 2:22,2:17, 2:20, 2:14 and j
2:10 class contests.
The 2:25. 2:35, 2:30 and 2:20 trots and
the 2:27 and 2:22 paces are arranged on
original conditions that offer an innova- ;
tion in the light-harness brigade.
They are called heat races, and the con- |
ditions provide that the purse is to be
divided into four parts, each heat to be a
race. Winners of first money in the first
three heats connot start for the fourth
heat, but all that are eligible can go the
first three heats, winning such money as
they can. A horse distanced is not en- j
titled to any money, notwithstanding that i
it had previously won part of the purse, i
There will be three moneys in each heat, \
and the way to get the most money is to
drive for each heat. This plan insures a
contest throughout the entire race, and j
prevents the holding of one animal while
another is being driven out.
In the running division there will be ]
closed on August 1 twelve stake?, eight of ;
which are for three-year-olds and upward,
with distances from six furlongs to two
and a fourth miles, and four stakes for j
two-year-olds. There will be five running
races each day. The balance of the pro
gramme will be announced on August 22.
All who have seen the programme pro
nounce it the best ever offered by the !
society. The total purses and stakes j
amount to $35,000.
The exhibition of stock will be held the
last two weeks,- and several additional .
features will be offered for the promotion ,'
of livestock interests. The premium list j
will be under consideration for several i
days yet.
Thus far an additional class has been
formed for small Yorkshire swine and the
premium for a family of hogs has been
changed to one for a lerd. There will be
no separate and distinct premiums for
county exhibits in the agricultural de
partment, but the money heretofore ap- j
portioned for these premiums will be
added to individual premiums.
A new and separate department, to be
known as the department of aairy prod
ucts and machinery, was formed, and will
be placed under the supervision of the
California Dairy Association. The de
partment will include premiums for all
dairy products, as well as for refrigerators
and 'modern dairy appliances. There will
be cash premiums, besides medals, to the
amount of about $500.
It is proposed to have a practical dried
fruit exhibit, where the teaching of cook
ing and uses of dried fruit will he demon
strated.
A committee has been appointed to pro
vide for a rocK-drilling contest, which in
itself will be a great feature and interest
the entire mining community.
The matter of special attractions for the
fair was referred to a committee.

Cincinnati, Forsyth and St.

OMAHA, Nebe. June 12.â Three thou
sand people attended the Western grand
circuit races at the Fair grounds. It was
an ideal day, and the track was in excel
lent shape after the shower of the pre
vious afternoon. It was a great occasion
for favorites, and the bookies were well
pleased with the day's business.
The first race on the card was the special
for three-year-oJds eligible to the 2:30
trotting class. Falmont won easily in
straight heats. The second event was the
2:15 pace. The fight for the fiv>> heats was
between Hastings Boy and Dick Wilkes,

dica, the favorite, won.
As is generally the case, the best event
was last on the card. This was the special
for three-year-old pacers eligible for the
2:25 class. In the first heat four of the
nine starters were distanced. They got off
on the ninth score with Thorndine leading
and Bessie E, who had been acting badly,
a dozen lengths behind. The race was an
exciting one, Thorndine winning the heat
by a length. The second heat was almost
as exciting, Thorndine again taking the
lead, which he held to the finish, with
Edith W crowding him closely and Mary
H a good third. The last heat was tame,
Thorndine being restrained to allow Edith
W to finish first.

SCOTT JACKSON`S CHARACTER
nitnrsiem Who Swore That Jt Wat of the
Heat.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 12.â The de
:ense in the Walling trial rested its case at
;his afternoon's session, and the State be
Â»an its examination of witnesses in re
suttal.
Dr. Edwin Landy, who proved a good
isitness for the defense two or three days
igo, resumed the witness-stand. Em
balming, he said, would probably destroy
;he evidence that a person had died from
aemorrhage. The vertebrae from a hu
man neck were introduced, and the wit
ness pointed out how difficult it would be
ac to sever a neck. The jurymen handled
the ghastly piece of evidence rather gin
gerly. Dr. Landy said in order to cut a
dead off, it would be necessary to twist in
svery direction.
A letter was introduced and read by
Colonel Nelson, from Scott Jackson to
Walling. It was dated Greencastle, Ind.,
December 28, 1893, and referred to Stella,
Cora, "Willies Queen, who Is now in
Danville," and other girls. It was full of
references to the parties given at Green
castle during the holidays, but contained
no reference to Pearl Bryan.
The purpose of the prosecution in pre
senting the letter was to show great inti
macy between Jackson and Walline and
Ln its purpose it succeeded.
The prosecution Deeran in rebuttal by in
troducing Robert Boies, colored, who said
that the Caldwell Guards drilled January
31. Captain George Jackson was there in
military overcoat and cap. Marshal
Brown of Avondale, A. J. Clark of Cin
cinnati and Liveryman Robestock gave
George Jackson a very good character.
Mrs. Hamilton of 731 West Seventh street,
Cincinnati, saw the Caldwell Guards drill
January 31. It was her nephew's birth
day.
The lawyers vied with each other in
seeing who could consume the most time.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
DAGGETT SWEATS
FOR FRANK GOULD
A " Lead-Pipe Cinch " on the
Convention Is Pro- â¢
claimed.
SHOVELING MINT JOBS.
The Opposition Waits for a Can
didate and a Spontaneous
Boom.
ISSUE OF THE CONVENTION.
Buckley Delegates Indorse White for
the Presidency, and Order a
Special Train.
"Daggett has a lead-pipe cinch," say the
politicians of the Mint and the Junta as
they hustle or worm about under ordprs
getting in their work for Gould, the
Junta's cause and the Daggett programme
generally.
There is no doubt in the minds of Dag
gett's henchmen that Gould will be elected
chairman, that the Junta delegation will
be seated and that Daggett will get, direct
and do at Sacramento according to his
heart's desires.
Tliere is no bunch grass growing rankly
on Daggett's heels. He works while it is
day and then works while it is night and
his talking is inversely as his hustling.
He has worked up an iron will and de
clared, "My man Gould shall rule my con
vention."
Daggett works and keeps still, while Mc-
Nab hustles and talksâ talks of the lead
pipe cinch on Gould's election and
the prosrarume that is to fol
low. Datrgett is making sure through
Rainey, Lanigan, McNab, Ed Greaney,
George Maxwell, J. A. Fenton, Nat Seelig
and the other Dagaett-Rainey hustlers
that the Junta delegates are all right and
that no proxies got away. Democrats
from all over the State who come to the
City are looked after, and the machine
forces throughout the State are kept in
close touch with the machine.
Daggett is shoveling out Mint patronage
for the benefit of his fight in even livelier
fashion than he has done at any previous
time. Five more jobs have been given out
within a week. Three are to country poli
ticians and two are City appointments.
They have brought support to Gould.
Day before yesterday a weigher in the
assay department, Captain Ritter of Oak
land, a Republican, who has been in the
Mint for fifteen or eighteen years, received
his discharge. The vacancy is to help
make Gould chairman.
The Mint employes understand that the
recent civil-service order of President
Cleveland is not to go into effect here
until it is officially transmitted; that it is
being held back in Washington that it
ma}' not handicap Daggett's tight for the
administration and himself,- and that it is
still a good, thing to obey Daggett's orders.
It is also expected that during the brief
time between tne adjournment of the State
Convention and the establishment of civil
service protection Daggett will oil up his
guillotine and see that sins of employes
and of their brothers, cousins and political
sponsors are properly punished. During
that same opportune period the $2CKK) ap
pointment of Gould's brother-in-law and
other patronage rewards tnat Gould may
possibly earn will be made finally good.
The opposition to Gould developed no
candidate yesterday. They were still at
sea about both Foote and White, either of
whom will be forced into the race if there
is any possibility of accomplishing it. A
candidate of some name and degree of
power will be hoisted to the view of men
by the early gathering of leaders that will
put heads together at the Golden Eagle
about Sunday night, when the possibili
ties more clearly appear.
Those who do not believe that Daegett
will boss the convention are counting on
a somewhat spontaneous union of the
delegates opposed to Daggett, Gould, the
Federal machine, gold rule of the plat
form and the Chicago delegation and the
surrender of the State machine to theDag
gett-Gould-McNab combination. They
calculate that such a last day candidate
may be rushed into the chair and the slate
smashed.
Nearly every important feature of the
convention depends on the chairmanship.
The settlement of the issue promises to be
attended by surprises for all hands.
Congressman Maguire will not be at the
convention when it opens, if he reaches it
at all. Patton of Los Angeles is a possible
candidate. John T. Coffey will play him
if he gets a chance to. Senator Burke of
Santa Cruz has also been mentioned. Po
litical conventions are uncertain.
Many of the interior delegates are
expected to arrive in the City en route to
Sacramento to-night aud to-morrow.
Daggett is expected to go to Sacramento
to-ni ht to open the commander-in-chief's
headquarters. Quite a number will go up
to-morrow.
Monday will see the huge inpourine at
the capital. San Francisco will yield her
Democrats by hundreds. There will be
only 322 looking for seats in the conven
tion and crowds are expected to go along
to see the fun. The Buckleyites will go in
a special train.
The Iroquois Club will go in a special
embannered car at 4p. m. Monday. They
will wear white straw hats and toma
hawks, take aboard Iroquois clubs at Ue
nicia and Suisun, and install officers of
the new Sacramento club Monday ni^-tit.
They talked much about the trip at the
regular club meeting last night, when W.
P. Stradley had finished his address on
"Gladstone and Ireland."
PLANS OF BUCKLEYITES
White Indorsed for President of the
United Statesâ Arrangements
for a Special Train.
For more than an hour last night, the
Buckley delegates to the State Convention
worried over the matter of transportation
to Sacramento next week, and in the
course of the proceedings the fact was
made evident that neither Buckley nor
any of thÂ« shining lights of that wing of
the local Democracy had any money "to
burn."
A grand-stand play was made by the
adoption of resolutions pledging the dele
gation to vote and work in the interests of
Stephen M. White for President of the
United States. This move, like that of the
nomination of Maguire for Congress, is in
terpreted as an overture for the favor and
influence in the coming convention of the
gentlemen honored.
Superintendent of Streets Ashworth
drew forth tho greatest enthusiasm dis
played during the two-hour Hession when
he offered to contribute $20 of the $40
necessary to pay for the locomotive which
is to haul the special train of the delega
tion to Sacramento. But Andy Clunig,
who was present with an evident grudge
against all office-holders, pounced upon
him and shouted that if he held as fat nn
office as Ashworth he would defray the ,
whole extra expense of $40. At another
stage of the proceedings he made a similar
fling at Recoroer Glynn.
The meeting of the delegation was for
the purpose of perfecting arrangements
for the exodus to Sacramento and for
breaking into the State Convention.
Rollcall showed 110 out of the 161 dele
pates present. While it was in progress
A. J. Clunie called Charles McCarthy
down for responding to the name of De
voto, the latter gentleman being absent.
Mr. McCarthy became indignant and a
warcloud for a second or two hovered on
the horizon. The offender explained by
stating he answered for Devoto as that
gentleman was downstairs.
Congressman Maguire's telegram return
ing thanks for the nomination of toe Fifth
District Convention was read and greeted
with aoplause.
Senator Donovan of the committee on
headquarters at Sacramento reportea that
he had made a conditional arrangement
for a hall on Seventh street, between X
and L, and the committee was given full
power to act. The rent will be $10 per
day until 10 p. m. and $4 per day extra if
the hall is used until midnight.
The committee on badges presented a
sample of the insignia which it had or
dered made. It consists of two silver dol
lars overlapping one another, one snow
ing the obverse and the other ths reverse
of the coin, printed in silver on cardboard.
This is surrounded by loops of pink rib
bon. On the lower fac simile of the coin
is the following legend: "Free Silver; 16
to 1. Democratic State Convention, Sac
ramento, June, '96." They cost 35 cents
each.
On motion of Joseph Rothschild the
various Assembly district delegations
elected chairmen to look after detail mat
ters in Sacramento, and so in part relieve
Dr. Stanton, the chairman of the City
delegation. A recess was declared to al
low of this being done, and the following
chairmen were reported:
Twenty- eighth District, James Ryan;
Twenty-ninth District, P. H. Cahill; Thirtieth
Nicholas Provost, President of the Master Bakers' Protective Association.
District, J. H. Miller; Thirty-first Dislrict, T.
Trace y; Thirty-second District, M. J. Rooney;
Thirty-third District, M. J. Crane; Thirty
fourth District, Herman Joost; Thirty-fifth
District, P. J. Carr; Thirty-sixth Distri't, M.
G. Sears; Thirty-seventh District, James
N'ealon; Thirty-eighth District, M. J. Donovan;
Thirty-ninth District, J. H. Steinbach; Fortieth
District, Charles Hat?gerty: Forty-first Dis
trict, P. F. Dunn: Forty-second District, P. T.
Flynn; Forty-third District, Mat O'Donnell;
Forty-fonrth District, D.Sweeney; Forty-fifth
District, J. C. Castro.
Secretary Humphreys introduced the
following resolution without comment:
Whereas, The Hon. Stephen M. White nas
been prominently mentioned as a candidate
for the Democratic nomination for President
of the United States of America; and, whereas,
he has ever proved loyal to the interests of
the American people, and has ever been the
determined foe of grasping corporations and
monopolies, as was illustrated by his opposi
tion to the funding bill; and, whereas, he is
the living embodiment of the principles ad
vocated by the Democracy of California; there
fore be it
Resolved, That we, the delegates to the State
Convention from the City and County of San
Francisco do hereby pledge ourselves to vote
only for such men for delegates to the Demo
cratic National Convention as will pledge
themselves to vote for and use their best en
deavors to secure the nomination for President
of the United States for the Hon. Stephen M.
White, and we further pledge ourselves to do
all within our power to have the State Conven
tion send to the National Convention dele
gates pledged to the Hon. Stephen M. White,
California's choice for President of the United
States.
J. A. Steinbach opposed the resolution
and asked, '"Dare you and can you afford
to pledge yourself to a man whom we all
know has no chance of election?"
Here there were indignant and deter
mined cries of "We can" and "We dare."
After some further debate the resolution
was unanimously adopted.
Chairman Glynn of the committee on
transportation reported that a special
train could be obtained to Sacramento Dy
guaranteeing 120 fares at S3 30 each and
paying $40 extra for the locomotive.
It was decided to accept this offer and
that the train leave at 2:30 p. m. Monday.
This arrangement included a return pas
sage on any regular train. A rolfcall
showed that 136 delegates would take ad
vantage of the special train.
Tickets will be obtainable at the Buck
ley headquarters Sunday afternoon be
tween 1 and 5 p. m., and there will be a
meeting of the chairmen of the Assembly
district delegations to make final arrange*
ments at 8 p. M. to-morrow.
Charles Edelman of Orange County was
present and addressed the meeting just
before it &djourned. In the course of his
remarks he said the delegates from his
county would go to the State Convention
without bias for or against either of tne
factions from this City, and he promised
they would vote according to the law and
merits of the case. Hia utterance was
heartily applauded.
SHINGLERS HAVE A GRIEVANCE
An Alleged Breach of Agreement With
the Trades Council tha Cause.
The members of the shinglers' union are
sorely perplexed over what it terms a breach
of honor and confidence in the treatment it
has received at the hands of the Trades Coun
cil, which refused admittance to its delegates
when they presented themselves for admission
to that body.
For the greater part of this indignity the
shinglers blame the carpenters, as that uody is
supposed to be in opposition to them as skilled
mechanics.
The following resolution, as adopted at the
meeting of their union last night, speaks their
sentiments:
Be-solved, That shingling is recognised as a dis
tinct and separate trade as any mt-cbanical art
composed in the Buildlne Trades Council, and that
we are entitled to the same recognition as Is ac
corded to the affiliated unions-s ilnglers are ap
prenticed and obliged to learn thfiir trade the same
as any other trade: aud that we were urged to
form a union and that we were organized as such
by the committee of the Building Trad s Council,
with promise of receiving full recognition as an
affiliated union.
All contractors and architects recognized us as
such and Â»i!?neil a petition recommending that we
do the work for whkhwohad formed our union
In preference to carpenters; therefore be it further
Resolved, That we do condemn the action of the
Carpenters 1 District Council in prevailing j
upon tne Building Trades Council to declare us
not entitled to recognition as mechanics or as
a union, thereby attempting to deprive us of the
right to earn an honest living, and for sending
threats to contractors, architects and all labor
unions forbidding them to wortt with or employ us
on penalty of a boycou and strike.
This action we consider as antagonistic to union
ism and to the exercise of liberty and the legiti
mate pursuit of an honorable calling granted to
every citizen.

MASTER BAKERS`
GRAND PICNIC
It Will Be Held at Schuet
zen Park Next
Thursday.
GAMES FOR EVERYBODY.
Bowling for Cash Prizes the
Principal Feature of the
Programme.
PRESIDENT PROST'S THOUGHTS.
Says the Association Consists of Sev
enty Bakeries, With a Common
Object in View.
The retail grocers have had their turn
at the wheel, made things interesting on
the occasion of their twenty-fifth annual
outing, and are quietly satisfied with their
exhibition. Now comes the Master
Bakers' Protective Association and says
the day for it to bring its light fiom be
neath the bushel has arrived. In other
words, they propose to have a picnic
themselves and show the City that the}'
are not behind the times.
The active officers of the Master Bakers'
Protective Association are : President,
Nicholas Prost; secretary, George Rutz,
and cashier, William Ingling. They say
this is going to be one of the kind of pic
nics you talk about but seldom witness.
It is to be held in California Schuetzen
Park, near San Kafael, next Thursday,
June 18. There will be bowling for cash
prizes, eames for young and old, dancing
and various other forms of amusement.
In fact everything has been arranged for
a royally good time, and an excellent en
tertainment is assured to all who attend.
The associacion and music band leaves
Tiburon ferry, at the foot of Market street,
at 9 a.m. Boats will leave at 7:30, 9, 11
and 11:30 a. m., and at 12:35 and 3:30 p. m.
The admittance to the park, including
fare, will be 75 cents. Children under 15
years of age will be charged but 25 cents.
"Trie association," said President Prost,
"is now composed of seventy bakeries, the
proprietors of which are mostly of German
descent. However, a few bakeries other
than those controlled by Germans are at
present represented, and it is our iuten
tion to get as many as we can of all classes
to unite with us.
"Business in our line, as well as in most
others, has been troing down hill for some
time, and the only remedy lies in our join
ing together and working for the common
good.
"One object we have in view is to cause
all loaves to be sold for 5 cents. It doesn't
make any difference how large the loaf is
made, it should not be sold at less than
that price. We are confident that ere long
this condition of affairs will come about."

SATURDAY JUNE 13, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
From St. Louis every rumor is thrilling.
There may yet be a surprise party at the
convention.
The only issue local Democracy cares
for is Daggett or no Daggett.
Things look certain for the first ballot,
but everybody feels uncertain.
Leave orders for Tue Sunday Call and
y hi will have good reading to-morrow.
it would seem somebody should tell Mr.
il anna there is such a thing as overdoing it.
The first ballot at St. Louis will tell the
tale, but what the tale will be is a mystery
story.
On the platform question at St. Louis
there are about afl many planks as there
are men.
Alter all is raid and done there will be
less fun at !st. Louis than at the Santa Cruz
carnival.
Bland looms up as a Presidential can
didate despite the fact there is no bland
feeling in his party.
Tbis is a good time to remember that
accidents are liable to happen in even the
best regulated conventions.
The loveof the convention for McKinley
is undoubtedly true, and perhaps tiiat is
the reason it doesn't run smooth.
Foote would like to sway the Democratic
Convention, but the chances are he will
not be permitted even to agitate it.
This Congress could not do much with
Cleveland in the White House, but it
managed him better than the Democratic
Congress.
It is already evident there will be
nothing at the Democratic State Conven
tion but mighty small politics treated in a
small way.
The money question that will have to be
settled lirst is one of wages and good
prices, and the plain answer to that ques
tion is protection.
The Socialists are reported to have put
up a State ticket in Ohio, but they could
not have put it up very high, for it isn't
visible above the horizon.
Tne greatest issue of the campaign will
be protection, and no loyal supporter of
that American system will abandon it for
any minor issue whatever.
Goldbug Democratic organs in the East
are showing an earnest desire to put the
money question out of sight before the
Chicago convention meets.
If the St. Louis convention declares for
gold, the money Question will go over to
the next campaign, for no one will trust
Democracy with any issue.
While the leaders are selecting the
standard bearer at St. Louis the ranu and
file of the party should be organizing and
getting ready to ratify the choice.
The increase in the Republican County
Committee membership will be timely.
There is much work to be done and the
committee must have members enough to
do it well.
Not one of the prairie States will admit
that any of the cyclones originated with
in its borders ; each claims that every storm
started somewhere else and was blown in
by accident.
It is the voice of the people which has
made protection the cnief issue in the cam
paign, and the same voice warns the gold
bugs not to claim the coming victory as
their triumph.
This time the Democrats of the House
joined in a vote of thanks to Tom lieed,
and the display of the conquest of their
old passions was a triumph for them as
well as for him.
The appropriations of Congress were
clearly based upon an expectation of a re
turn to Republican prosperity under the
next administration, and the people will
see to it that the expectations are realized.
Foraker is said to be the most dramatic
statesman in American public life, and in
nominating McKinley at St. Louis, he will
have a stage, a role and audience that will
give him a splendid chance to show his
talent.
Cleveland is reported to have said that
Tom Reed is the ablest leader in the Re
publican party and best fitted to be Presi
dent, but fortunately for the man from
Maine, the words of Grover have long
since lost their power to hurt anybody.
When Bland was asked if he would ac
ceDt the Democratic nomination on a free
sUver platform, he promptly replied,
"Yes, and would be elected," which only
goes to show how foolish msn become
when they answer more than they are
asked.
In the strain of the contest at St Louis
no Republican should permit himself to
be drawn into a faction fieht. Let us begin
the new era by showing the world that
California Republicans can stand together
for the party and the State ia spite of
.personal difference*
THE FIFTY-FOURTH CONGRESS
The first session of the Fifty-fourth
Congress is a past event and its history is
written. That it did not accomplish all
that was required at its handa will be ad
mitted, but it could not have been other
wise, so far as the lower house i& con
cerned. At the outset the Republican
majority in the House of Representatives
was confronted by a Hostile administra
tion in all the departments, and subse
quently a combi nation between Democrats
and Populists in the Senate placed obstruc
tions in thu way of every measure that
would not pay tribute to ihe combine's
vagaries by adding some economic or
monetary proposition that was wholly
and entirely foreign to the purpose of the
measure. Never was the lower house o!
Congress so handicapped by its co-workers
in the Senate and White House. It was
not to be expected, however, that the
President would give the Representatives
of the people a whit more assistance than
he was obliged to, nevertheless he was
most cordially invited, urged indeed, to
help Congress relieve the distress of the
country which the Yvilson-Gorman tariff
act had inflicted upon it.
But notwithstanding it was uphill work
from the day Congress convened until it
adjourned, a surprisingly large amount of
good was accomplished. It was no fault
of the Republican members tbat no relief
was extended to the treasury. When Con
gress met it did not stop to criticize the
wretched and grossly, incompetent man
agement of the Nation's finances, but
straightway st-t about to devise ways and
means for the treasury's relief so tbat the
Nation's good name and credit might
not be impaired. A proposition
that would afford ample relief was
submitted to the Senate for its con
currence, but it was rejected by
the combination of Democrats and Popu
lists already referred to. Still, had it
reached the President, as was subsequently
ascertained, he would have vetoed it al
most viciously because it was not exactly
the plan he had suggested. So, rather
thau co-operate with a Republican Con
gress to give the treasury the much-needed
present relief and protection against fu
ture assaults upon it by Wall street and
London money sharks, the President hi
cumbered the people witn an additional
debt of $100,000,000.
When the river and harbor billâ a bill
that scarcely did justice "to the commerce
of the country because it did not provide
for a sufficiently large expenditure of
money to meet the demand with proper
liberalityâ reached the President he
promptly returned it with excuses for his
veto that were weak almost to imbecility.
But the Republican party quickly rallied
and passed the measure over his head.
The blunder of the Wilson-Gorman tariff
act allowing alcohol to go uutaxed when
used in the arts and sciences v/as remedied
by wiping it out entirely, thus putting a
stop toglaiing frauds upon the treasury.
Reasonable sums of money were appro
priated for coast defense and for new war
ships and other needs of the navy. The
general expense account of the Govern
ment was provided for as well as it could
be under Democratic free trade, but not a
dollar was appropriated for which there
\vus no: a pressing need. The sympathy
uf the people with the Cubans and their
heroic struggle for independence was ex
pressed in plain and distinct language,
and it is no fault of Congress that the
belligerency of the patriots in Cuba bus
not been recognized by our Government.
The President has interposed excuses and
objections all along, and is still doing so.
Take it altogether, then, it is remark
able that Congress should have done so
much for the country under such adverse
circumstances. Alone the Republican
majority stood battling against a hostile
President on one side and a Democratic-
Populist combine on the other, but the
country is stronger every way lor having
such* a Congress, not only for the good ft
accomplished, but as a reminder to the
people that if they would have the Na
tion's credit maintained and their own
highways of commercial operations kept
free of hindering obstacles and opposing
influences they must rally to their old
defender and protector, the Republican
party.
THE FIRST VOTE.
"Be sure you are right, then go ahead,"
is the best advice that can be given the
young man who will cast his first vote
next November. Association and home
influence have a good deal to do in deter
mining what is right with most young
people and, perhaps, it is best that it
should be so, but the time conies now and
then when the young man should rise
above traditions and inherited opinions
and be a thinker unto himself. Every
young man expects to become a factor in
the world's business life â in a profession
or otherwiseâ and he should know that
next to his integrity the question of how
the best possible conditions for the en
couragement of the enterprise in which he
ventures may be established and main
tained is the leading one. ;
He must not eschew politics in its higher
meaning, for it is the science of govern
ment. He must eschew politics in its
lower meaning, for it leads to individual
and community degradation. But he
must, he is obliged by the terms of his
citizenship, to be a politician to the extent
at least of being a student of the philoso
phy of politics that he may know what is
the best and what is the worst thing the
community could do to strengthen its
social fabric and commercial highways.
Rightly engaging in practical politics is
applying common- business princi
ples upon high ethical lines to the con.
duct of the affairs of the community as a
whole, to the end that the influence of
hurtful factors may be minimized. It is
incumbent upon every man to be that
kind of an active, practical politician.
When the first voter sets about analyzing
the weak and strong spots in existing con
ditions he very naturally comes to some
conclusion as to how the weak and dan
gerous places may best be remedied, and
it is right here that tie is likely to let sen
timent overshadow judgment. But he
need be at no loss for reliable data. Prior
to 1860 the growth of the Nation's wealth
was slow, spasmodic and uncertain. This
was necessarily so because the monetary
system of the country was based upon the
honesty, or rather the dishonesty, of what
were called "wildcat" banks. The circu
lating money medium of the country was
always subject to the wildest fluctuations.
There was no stability anywhere in the
business world, and in the eighty-five pre
ceding years the Nation had accumulated
but little wealth, comparatively speaking.
In the three decades following 1860 the
.Republican party conducted the affairs of
the Nation, and in those thirty years it
increased the wealth of the country nearly
four times over and by its wise adminis
tration of the public affairs of the people
nearly $10,000,000,000 was induced to find
employment in the construction of rail
ways alone. Not only so, but enterprises
for the manufacture of nearly every
known quality and kind of merchantable
goods and wares sprang up in every State.
There was waiting employment for all
who chose to work, and at the end of the
three decades more working people ia the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
United States owned their own homes
than did the same class of people live in
their own houses in any two of the coun
tries of Europe. Therefore the Republi
can party i 3 the capitalist's party, the
manuiacturer's party, the miner's party,
the merchant's party, the mechanic's
party, tho farmer's party, the laborer's
party, the home-seeker's party, the pro
fessional man's party, and by every rule
of logic and by the history of events it
should be the party of every first voter.
THE FRATERNITY OP BARBERS.
The journeymen barbers of San Fran
cisco have rights, and they propose to
maintain them. And not only so, but they
propose to introduce quite a number of
much needed reforms. For this purpose
they aim at effecting a new organization,
and as soon as it is completed, which will be
by a charter from the International Union,
they will make the effort to close all shops
at 8 p. m. on weekdays, and not open at
all on Sundays. This is a right move in a
right direction. There is no sense at all in
keeping barber-shops open in the evening
until all opportunity for recreation and
amusement is lost; besides, barbers who
have families should not be deprived of the
pleasure of spending their evenings at
home any more than any other men.
But there are still other reasons why it
is desirable that the organization should
be. A fee of $1 to ?5 is now charged to pro
cure a journeyman a situation, and very
naturally the one paying $5 has a better
"edge" than those who pay less. This
would seem to be rank discrimination.
The new organization will make a uniform
charge of 25 cents for registering an appli
cation for a job, while efficiency and faith
fulness to duty will be the only security
needed to hold one in his position. The
society will have the additional feature of
a sick fund and an employment bureau.
WHY M'KINLEY?
It seems assured that William McKinley
Will be nominated by the St. Louis conven
tion. It seems to be the will of the majority
of the people of the United States that he
shall lead in the work of building anew
where a Democratic administration has
laid waste. It is not because Mr. McKin
ley is the one and only great statesman in
the Republican party. It is not because
he is necessary to the party and country
as no other man is. It is not because be
has explored deeper into the science of
government than any other Republican
political economist has. It is not because
he has had more experience in conducting
the affairs of the Nation than the Allisons,
the Reeds, the Shermans and the Harri
sons have. It is not because he and only
he possesses the confidence of the indus
trial and the agricultural and commercial
world. His peers are many in the Repub
lican party.
Mr. McKinley is the choice of the people
for just one reason. He represents more
than any one else now living the policy
of protection to American industry. The
whole countryâ political friends and po
litical foes alikeâ has entire confidence in
his integrity, in his strength of character
and in his honesty of purpose. These
qualities are essential in a candidate for
tue highest oilice within the eift of the
peoDle; but what is true of McKinley in
this respect is true of every other one ol
the statesmen who have stood well to the
front in connection with the St. Louis
nomination. Mr. McKinley is the choice
of the people because his nomination is as
a two-edged sword in the vitals of the
Democratic party. As chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee of the lower
house of Congress he bore the banner in
tlie fight which culminated in a great vic
tory for protection to the Nation's indus
tries and commerce.
"When the juggling and tinkering with
the tariff by the Cleveland administration
culminated in the terrible 'panic of 1894,
and the fallacy of the economic principles
of the Wilson-Gorman tariff act were ex
posed, the people made up their minds
that they would not only rebuke Cleve
landism, but they would emphasize their
disapproval of the repeal of the act of
IS9O by demanding its restoration under
the leadership of the very man who com
piled the figures, formulated the bill and
carried it to victory. By common consent
tbe people named the act the "McKinley
tariff Jaw," and in view of the splendid
service it did the country, and in view of
the "!<>nifold disasters which its repeal
caused to be thrust upon the country,
thero is a charming fitness of the events
which are conspiring to send Mr. McKin
ley to overthrow the monstrosity which
superseded the tariff schedule of 1890 and
reinstate his own. If the Democracy is
not dull to obtuseness it will feel the sting
of this rebuke.
It is to do these things that Mr. McKin
ley is selected to lead the party. By send
ing the author of the tariff act of 1890 to
the White House the people emphasize
their demand for "McKinley" protection,
and also emphasize their condemnation of
the party that tore down "McKinleyism"
that the products of the common as well
as the expert labor of the other nations
might be supreme in our markets. Above
all men in the Republican party Major
McKiniey is the most distasteful to the
Democracy. The whole burden, force and
energy of the Cleveland administration
has been centered against "McKinleyism,"
and now that the people propose to send
Mr. McKinley to drive out the Democracy
and plant "McKinleyism" in its stead, the
humiliation of the Democratic party
should be so great that it should make
haste to commit hara-kiri.
THE "SUNDAY CALL."
One of the most striking features of to
morrow's issue of The Call will be the
experience of three San Francisco girls in
Paris, their shopping tour of the world
famous Bon Marche, their experiences
with the stranger in long coat and large
neckwear, who attempts to flirt with the
chaperone on the boulevards. There are
several fine illustrations with this,
sketches from the life made in Paris by
the San Francisco girl who signs herself
"Van Dyke Brown." Both the pictures
and the letter-press are in the height of
their respective arts, and aside from this
are light and graceful.
The San l-rancisco summer girl will be
handsomely and accurately portrayed both
in picture and verse. There is a very
humorous but entirely true story of the
man who ate 10,950 beefsteaks consecu
tively; a sprightly written account of
what is probably the youngest artist in
the world, a remarkably precocious infant
of Folsom street, who draws excellent
pictures on the sidewalks and on the dead
walls, tnough but 4 years of age, and is
the wonder of the neighborhood; and
there are a host of other very attractive
features, nearly all of which are splen
didly illustrated.
BLAND`S NEW BOOM.
Presidential Candidate Bland's Missouri
managers have decided to organize on the
school-district plan in evory State, so that
when the delegates reach Chicago the
whole country will, as with one voice, cry
for "Bland." "How big was Alexander,
pa, that people called, aim great?" would
make a good rallying song for Silver Dick,
j because the untutored mind would get the
J idea that he is too big for any walk that
j did not lead straight to the White House.
Mr. Bland is exceedingly anxious to be in
dorsed by all the State conventions that
are yet to be held, but who will indorse
the conventions? Certainly not the voters
of the United States. Their good common
sense teaches them that it is better for the
country that the people pass by on the
other side of Bland's ultra free-trade
doctrine.
No one will dispute the right of Missouri
free-trade Bourbons getting together a:td
resolving that Bland is the logical candi
date of the Democratic party for Presi
dent, only that the word "logical" is forced
out of its proper place in the construction
of a sentence that is intended to convey a
Democratic idea. However, Bland ia a
representative Democrat. He knows bo
very little about the science of Govern
ment that he is as liable to think that
"economics" means Bomething to eat as
anything else. But how ridiculous it was
for Bland and his friends to meet in St.
Louis and resolve to boom him when the
city was crowded with delegates to the
Republican National Conventionâdele
gates who will nominate a man for Presi
dent for whose presence in the White
House every business in the land is pray
ing.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
John Sebastian of Devil's Lake, North Dakota,
who is extensively engaged in wheat-growing
in that vicinity and throughout the Red River
Valley, is in the City. He says that during
the last few months there has been an enor
mous rush of the members of the queer sect
known as tue Dunjcers to that part of North
Dakota.
The exodus is mainly from Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Indiana, though some come from the
Southern States. Mr. Sebastian says that about
three years ago a committee was sent out from
the old Dunker settlements to find lands for
young Dunkers. They selected six counties
in the Devil's Lake region, and then word was
passed along in the old colonies that a prom
ised land had been found.
That was all the assurance the enthusiastic
Dunkers wantea. They never thought of the
cold nor of cyclones, for they are fairly well
acquainted with them, but considered only the
deep black soil of the Dakota prairies.
"It is the great desire of the Dunkers to own
a big farm," said Mr. Sebastian, "so when they
learned that they could get land for but little
more tuan the Government price there was a
hegira to that section. A Dunker doesn't care
for hard work, coarse clothing and plain food.
"He wants a big barn, plenty of fat stock,
a great farmhouse full of children and to be
comfortable and enjoy the attendance on his
religious services.
"They are honest, God-learing people. How
ever, many of their religious ceremonies seem
odd to the stranger, especially the washing of
feet, which is regularly practiced during the
great love feasts or revivals. The bishops and
elders go about cleansing the feet of the breth
ren, and the sisters wash one another's feet.
The ceremony is concluded by extending the
right hand of fellowship and by exchanging
the kiss of brotherly love. In the church the
sexes are separated, and so this does not mean
that there is indiscriminate kissing among
the men and women. The men are very sedate.
"There is another strange thing about these
ceremonies, and that is that after the washing
of feet a hearty meal is served in the church,
mid then comes the ordinary communion ser
viet\ at which bread and wine are served.
Tht-ir houses of worship are built witn fully
equipped kitchens in the basements and sleep
ing accommodations in the attics, so tbat these
love feasts may last for several days and be at
tended by brethren from a distance.
"l'ou may do anything you please with these
Devil's Lake and Red River Dunkers and they
won't go to law. To their mind a lawyer is a
thing of the Devil'sown inventionâ a disturber
and a stirer up ol strife. Any trouble the
Dunkers have is always settled by the church
dignitaries.
"A Dunker won't bear arms, either, or belong
to a secret society. He is a man of peace, in
dustrious, honest, eschewing gossip and dress
ing in the plainest way. The Dunkers there
part their hair in the middle and let their
beard growâ it is their religion to do so. The
Dunkers wear a slouch hat and the plainest of
clothes for the same reason. The garb of the
Dunker woman is also plain and severe. There
are no milliners among them, for each woman
makes her own hat, and as no feathers or other
ornamentation is allowed this is a simple mat
ter. The wearing of jewelry is strictly forbid
den.
"These Dunkers are very valuable citizens
for North Dakota, and they are receiving a
hearty welcome there. No country can have
too much honesty, and these people are honest
and straightforward beyond any class of set
tlers we have ever had.
"There has been a rush of Dunkers to Devil's
Lake for three years now, and the rush this
year is the biggest we have ever had. They are
coming In by trainloads, bringing their goods
along. Many have arrived in time to put in a
full crop of the different kinds of grain and
other products.
"Though a queer people irom the standpoint
of most persons, they certainly possess great
virtues, and this is why they are being warmly
welcomed in North Dakota."
THE LAST HORSECAR.
'T!s a last, useless horsecarâ
Deserted, alone;
All its old- time companions
To kindlings have gone.
No car of her kindred â
Nor caretteâ is nigh
To re-echo her ramble
And give sigh for sigh.
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one,
To rust and decay.
Since the rest have departed
I will send thee away.
Go thou to the wood-pile;
On its splintery bed
Thy mates are reclining,
All useless and dead.
And monrn not that thou must
Be broken and burned.
But rejoice in the sum of
The lares thou hast earned;
For, at best, every life is
Like a seed that is sown.
To flourish and blossom
And perish, alone. âChicago Record.

RAISED OUT OF
HER OOZY BED
Work Ceased When the
Blairmore's Stern
Swung Clear.
FIRST TRY A SUCCESS.
The Pumps Worked Splendidly
and Raised- the Hull
Nearly a Foot.
CAPTAIN BURNS IS CONFIDENT
Extra Precautions Takenâ A Fur
ther Attempt to Be Made
To-Day.
The feasibility of raising the Blairmore
was demonstrated yesterday. The methods
inaugurated by Captain Burns, who rep
resents Lloyds, and Captain Whitelaw,
the wrecker, were proven to be on the
right lines, and although a supposed mis
hap prevented the completion of the
work, there is no doubt now but what it
will be successfully accomplished in the
end.
The air pump was at worK for two hours
and the water pumps took a continuous
\ stream out of the hold for an hour and a
â  half. The stern of the vessel rose half a
: foot out of the mud and the entire hull
j moved in its oozey bed. At 8:45 A. M.
! everybody was exultant, as it seemed a
| certainty that the work would succeed.
| Suddenly there was a collapse and Captain
Burns at once surmised that a leak had
I occurred in the hull somewhere and that
; work for the day would have to cease.
I Divers were sent down again to repair
': dama es and when they were through
i tiiey reported that everything was air
| tight. The stern will be weighted with
sand, all the pumps overhauled during the
night and another attempt made this
morning.
At 7 a. m. yesterday everything was in
readiness for the test. It was really only
a "test," as Captain Whitelaw called it,
because the hose leading to the air engine
on the wrecker to the hull of the sunken
ship and the pumps had not been tried
I since they were placed in position. The
I air pump worked without a hitch and did
splendid work, out the water pumps got
choked again and again and in consequence
Captain Whitelaw was kept constantly on
| the jump.
On the hull of the Blairmore and
I between the timbers erected to hold the
I leverage tanks were a 12-inch and a 6-inch
I centrifugal pump and also an 8-inch out
side pack plunger. It wa? some time
before the plunger would work, but once
it started the water poured forth in
! volumes. All kinds of garbage was thrown
out and a close watch was kept. One of
the pumps cloeged persistently, and Cap
tain Whitelaw remarked, "There is some
thing solid in the way."
"Do you think it is the body of one of
the d. ad sailors?" was asked, and Captain
I Whitelaw answered while shaking his
j head, "it might be the remains of one of
! the poor fellow. Nothing but something
{ yielding could choke that pump up so ef
; fectively. "
When all the pumps were going the
scene in Mission Bay was a pretty, one.
The steam went up in clouds from the
stern of the Whitelaw, while on the bow,
watching the work of the Catalina, were
Captain Andrews of the Cromdale, Cap
tain Caw of the sunken ship and Captain
j Burns. Plyine between the wreck and the
! wrecker were several boats and on the hull
of the sunken vessel were at least a dozen
men attending the pumps. The exhaust
steam from the latter almost hid the
superstructure from view, while the "blow
off" from the Catalina and Whitehiw's
boilers created a noise that made ordinary
conversation impossible.
The tide had turned and was running in
i when the Blairmore began to lift. "Let
her come," said Captain Burns. "We will
raise her clear of the mud and then let her
| back again. To-morrow morning it will
be easy work to get her where we want
her." The words were hardly out of his
I mouth before the hitch came, and all work
: had to be stopped. Burns took it in a
philosophical manner and remarkea :
"Well, it's nothing more than I expected.
j Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.
! Some of the packing has given way, and
i the water is pouring in as fast as we pump
{it out. When slact water comes we will
| send down the divers and repair damages.
; We know the weak points, and now I
i think we can confidently predict that the
i Blairmore will be In shallow wat^r inside
I of twenty-four hours."
Captain Whitelaw and all his assistants
j have worked hard and faithfully on the
| job, and the hope is generally expressed
that they may be successful. Captain
Whitelaw is equally as Confident as Cap
tain Burns as to the outcome.
MISS CRAVANS BENEFIT.
The Young Actress Plays g 'jrron-Frou"
at the New Auditorium.
A number of Miss Margaret Craven's
friends were present last night at the New
Auditorium to see her play "Frou-Frou."
The performance was a benefit to the j
young actress, and on that account every
one entered into the spirit of the affair
without expecting too much.
As the frivolous Frou-Frou Miss Craven
bore the burden of the play on her own
shoulders. She was gushing, girlish and
inconsequent enough to make an ideal
I Frou-Frou, but she showed a lack of the
feathery touch aud the Gallic chic which
the part requires. In fact. Miss Craven's
forte lies more in modern comedy roles,
with a touch of earnestness and sentiment
in them.
Frou-Frou is an ambitious undertaking
for a young actress to essay, and it speaks
: well for her powers that she acquitted
j herself so well.
As for the rest of the cast, the per- j
formers had not for the most part been
chosen with reerard to their fitness for the
roles. James M. Ward was satisfactory as
the Baron de Catnbri, and Miss Eleanor I
Gallagher, a debutante, made a very pleas- !
ing impression as Pauline, the maid; she
was graceful, natural and unassuming.
Another debutant was Master Enos, an
infant of tender years, who looked scared
at the glare of the footlights, but who
wisely turned his head away from them,
and who quite captured the sympathies of I
the audience by his pretty behavior.

COXEY'S IDEAS
ABOUT FINANCE
He Tells Why the Govern
ment Should Make More
Money.
CAUSE OF THE PANIC.
Not Tariff Repeal, but Toe
Little Circulating Cur
rency.
GROVER THE ONE DEMOCRAT.
The Commonwealer Says Cleveland
Is the Whole Party and He Is
a Conspirator.
Jacob S. Coxey, late leader of the Army
of the Commonweal, gave his views of the
financial question at Metropolitan Temple
j last evening. It took over two hours for
him to complete his address, although he
spoke with remarkable rapidity, appar
! ently never stopping to take breath or col
i lect his thoughts. Jtlis argument was in
| terspersed liberally with anecdotes, which
were new, and were told very cleverly.
E. M. Wardell, chairman of the Populist
State Central Committee, introduced the
! speaker, whom he welcomed on behalf of
| the Populists of the State, in a brief speech
of eulogy. Mr. Coxey said, in part:
It is necessary for the American people to as
semble together to discuss the greatest ques
j tion which has ever been before them, just the
! same as physicians gather in consultation
I when the patient is very low with a dangerous
! disease. We tind the shelves of your mer
i chants overflowing with the necessaries of life,
| aud yet there are thousands in our land suf
fering for the want of these necessaries and
; only one barrier between them, and that is
money. Then is this not a diseased condition
in our country?
In thespring of '93 there was $1 .000,000.000
of actual money in the pockets of the people.
Tlu re was $45,000,000 more of credit money.
Then England p.aced $108,000,000 of securi
ties on the market, turned them into gold and
| commenced to witiidraw it. Then the Eastern
â  newspapers commenced to write editorials to
j the effect that the withdrawal of gold would
J ruin all the banks in the country. This
frightened the people, and they rushed to the
banks and withdrew their accounts. The
! manuiacturer took his paper to the banks, but
j they said they must protect their depositors,
I and they would not discount it.
Then the manufacturer was forced to close
! down his works. That is exactly the way in
| which the panic of '93 was brought about,
and it was simply because of a conspiracy
â  among the gold bugs of Wall street.
The speaker here told of a firm in Mas
; silon which had been compelled to is ue
| notes, or yeilow-ftacks, as he called them,
|of its own. These yellow-backs passed in
the community the same as money for
most purposes. This, he claimed, was
made necessary, because Congress had not
issued sufficient money. He continued:
How did it operate against the mechanic? If
he went to pay the taxes on his home the Col
lector would refuse to take it. He would have
to get a discount, a shave, a restriction of its
actual value simply because Congress had re
fused to do its duty. How does it operate
against the mechanic's family? His wife goes
Into a store to purchase groceries with one of
these $1 yellow backs. The grocer refuses to
do business with her unless she buys a full
dollar's worth of goods because he will not
I give her currency in chanpe for a note upon
j which he must wait for payment.
What was the issue the Eepublicnn party
went before the people on in 1894, aud on
which McKinley would like to go before the
people this year? They-said the panic was '.he
result of the fear of the repeal of the tariff.
Was it because of the fear of the tariff that
Russell & Co. were forced to issue yellow
backs? Certainly not. The tariff had abso
lutely nothing to do with It. When the money
famine was at its height what was the very
first act of the Democratic party? When I say
the Democratic party I refer to Grover Cleve
land, because he is the entire Democratic party
to-day.
He was calling Congress together at the dic
tates of the powers of Wall street to repeal the
only law that was furnishing any relief at allâ
the* purchasing clause of the Sherman bill.
That law was repealed in the interest of the
gold gamblers ot Wall street. Why? Because
I they wanted the Government to be prevented
| from making money. They had their agent,
! Grover Cleveland, for he has ceased to be the
agent of the American people, call Congress
together for this purpose.
How did Cleveland use his immense patron
age in forwarding this purpose ? Take the
! case of BrecKinridge of Arkansas, not Mr.
Breckinridge of Kentucky. Breckinridne voted
for the repeal of the purchasing clause, con
trary to the express mandate of the people of
his State. They recalled him, and what did
Grover do ? He gave him one of the greatest
foreign missions, and last week Breckinridge
in his knickerbockers was helping to put the
I crown on the Czar of Russia. Every one who
has a thimbleful of sense ought to know by
this time that the lenders of the Republican
j party, as well as the Democratic party, are op
posed to the use of silver as money.
My friends, it is you people who elected
those people to office. You believed in them
and they betra\ed you. That was their fault.
If, after they have betrayed you, you elect them
again, and again they betray you, that Is your
fault, and yours only.
John Sherman said in debate on the repeal
of the purchasing clause: "Repeal this law,
and in ten days the skies will clear and every
wheel will be turning." My friends, hns every
wheel been turning in California? It has not,
and John Sherman knew It would not when he
made that statement.
What is it that fixes prices? The demand for
goods. Put the people all in employment and
they are in a position to consume, and up will
go the prices.
The speaker devoted considerable time
to an explanation of the non-interest bear
ing bond bill. He claimed that this bill
furnished the panacea for the present labor
troubles and would allow each community
to own its streetcar lines, its water and
lighting plants and to provide all needed
improvements. He also spoke in favor of
Government ownership of railways.
I was introduced recently to a railroad mag
nate, and the gentleman introducing me said,
"Mr. Coxey advocates the Government owner
ship of railroads." The railroad magnate
swelled out and said, "Why, Mr. Coxey, the
Government cannot runÂ»the railroads.' "Is
that so? I asked. "Then why is it that when
ever the railroads get into trouble the com
panies call on the Government to get in and
run them?"
I want to say a word to my laboring friends.
You may join all the labor organizations in
the world, but as long as there are 4,000,000
men on the outside you will never succeed.
As long as their children are wailing for bread
they will take your places at 50 cents a day, if
need be. The only place that is left for the
people of this country to strike is at the ballot
box.
We demand the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 10 to 1, without any reference to
any other country on earth. But don't let
them persuade you that free coinage of silver
will be a remedy. It will only be a relief. It
would only introduce about $80,000,000.
They say it Is not the Government that makes
money. Suppose you try to make some and
see if it doesn't land you where I was when
they said 1 got on that sacred grass.
Coxey closed his speech with an account
of the famous "petition in boots," gener
ally known as the Coxey Army. He said
lie thought he would take a petition they
couldn't pigeonhole. They jailed it. He
found they had a place for everything that
came down there.
J. M. Reynolds, the well-known sinele
taxer, asked several questions from the
body of the audience, but Mr. Coxey
evaded any direct reply.
Â«
OPEN LETTER TO COXEY.
Pointed Questions Asked by a Be
liever In the Single Tax.
Sir: Owing to the arbitrary ruling of the
chairman at your meeting last night, I did not
get the opportunity to ask one more question
which I would be pleased if you will answer.
And, since the close of a two-hours speech is
not favorable for due deliberation or hardly
fair fair to ihe speaker, I will here repeat the
two questions I did ask, and add the one I was
not allowed to ask, hoping you will, after rest
and deliberation, answer them without eva
sion.
Since the only economic result of public im
provements is to raise the value oi land and
consequently rent, why will not your plan to
pay for such improvements by taxing all the
people, including the large majority who do
not own and as well as those who do, result
only to the benefit of landowners?
And, granting your answer to be true, that
"all the people would share in the general
prosperity to ensue," if the landowners, by
reason of the increase of land values, charge it
all up in rent, who will come out ahead, the
rent-payers or the rent-gatherers â tenants or
landlords?
In the confusion that followed I did not hear
your answer â very few did â but I did hear you
say, "We are going to abolish interest."
The question I desired to ask is: How will
an increase of land values and rents abolish
interest ? James S. Reynolds.

ALMSHOUSE CROWDED.
More Inmates There Now Than the In
stitution Can Comfortably Ac
commodate.
Dr. Conlan, resident physician of the Alms
house, made a visit to the Mayor's office yes-
I terday and appealed to Secretary Taylor
! Rogers to cease sending more indigents to '
| the institution until the present crowded con- !
| dition is relieved.
He stated that while the capacity of the
' place was 887 inmntee there were already 802
| there, and that any more would seriously
craui(> the institution. Mr. Rogers stated to i
[ the physician that under the law the deserving â¢
I poor who had no other place to go must be j
i sent to the Almshouse, and he would be com- |
pelled to go on issuing permits. He advised i
an appeal to the Supervisors for more accom
modations.
A STEPFATHER ACCUSED
Reason Given by Willie Horan for Run
' ning Away From His lios
Angeles Home.
Willie Horan, aged 13, who ran away
from his home in Los Angeles last Friday
and arrived in this City yesterday, tells a
strange tale of cruelty alleged to have
been committed by his stepfather, which
is corroborated by his sister, living on
Franklin street, who brought him up to
Secretary Hoibrook for advice as to wha^
should be done with him.
According to the youthful wanderer
his stepfather, "Rhodie" O'Connor, who
works at odd times as a farmhand on the
ranches contiguous to Los Angeles, has
oftentimes cruelly maltreated him with
out other provocation than the whim of a
violent and morose disposition. The re
sult is that he has been forced, so he and
his sister say, to run away from home.
Hitherto, however, he has remained in
Los Angeles and would take advantage of
the occasion of his stepfather's absence
while working on some ranch to come
home and stay with his mother.
The last time he ran away, it is said, M.
V. Wright, one of toe officers of a Los An
geles humane society, admonished his
stepfather that in case lie beat the boy
again he would be placed under arrest.
The boy seems naturally bright, though
he has evidently had little schooling, mid
expresses h:mself as willing to work. He
"beat" his way hereby riding the brake
beam and his clothing on arrival was in a
sadly dilapidated condition, while his
shoes were almost worn to pieces.
He was placed in the Boys' and Girls'
Aid Society Home, where he will be prop
erly cared for.
Fractured His Ribs.
I G. T. Mackey, a peddler from Stockton, met
| with a serious accident yesterday on Eighth
j and Howard streets. Wnile riding on a flour
wagon he collided with another vehicle and
was thrown to the ground. One of the wagons
ran over his body, fracturing several ribs nnd
cutting his scalp. At the Receiving Hospital
it was found that he also sustained internal in
juries.

ASHWORTH LETS
OUT MANY MEN
Over One Hundred Street
Laborers Are Dis
charged.
SHARP RETRENCHMENT.
Street Department Funds Were
About to Become Ex
hausted.
BRODERICK'S TIMELY WARNING
Heavy Expenditures During the Early
Part of the Year Have Left the
. Superintendent Short.
Superintendent of Streets Thomas AshÂ«
worth has, within the past week, dis
charged more than 100 of his men who
were employed in paving and repairing
the public streets, in a desperate attempt
to keep within the appropriation allowed
him by law and to avoid the unpleasant
experience of having the salary demands
of his men held out by Auditor Brodericfe
because of a lack of funds to pay them.
Soon after Auditor BrodericK sounded
the first note of warning that the funds
over which he keeps watch must not be
overdrawn Superintendent Ashworth be
gan preparations for retrenchment, and
chose to start with his large number of
street laborers. A force of men would
have been laid off on the Ist day of the
month, but there were a number of
streets undergoing the process of paving
that could not well be left half finished in
the face of the protests of property-own
ers, and it was not until the sth inst. that
orders were given to let the men out and
stop the improvements.
As many of the workmen were men of
family the wholesale discharge caused no
little feeling, but under the circumstances
there was noti.ing else for the superin
tendent to do, his lavish expenditures dur
ing the early portion of the year having
so reduced the funds of the Street Depart
ment that to have carried the force on the
payroll for the remainder of the month,
or until the next tax levy is made would
have been to create a heavy overdraft,
something that the Auditor would have
] refused to allow. It is estimated that with
I the $200 to $250 per day saving the depart
i ment will make in this manner and with
! close figuring in other quarters, the super
intendent will be able to show a clean bill
of health when the time for the payment
of his monthly bills arrives.
Ii is probable that Mr. Ashworth will
urge this very shortage in his funds a
I reason why Ins demand for over $1,500,000
for the next fiscal year should be acceded
to by the Board of Supervisors. It is just
about as probable thai, if the members of
the board have taken pains to notice the
labored attempts of many of the cobble
stone artists of the department to prevent
themselves from perspiring while at work
on the streets they will cut that same de
mand down to about what it was for the
year now closing.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors was given some points at its
Thursday meeting that will probably be of
assistance in making up Mr. Ashworth's
appropriation.
Joseph Shearer, president of the Cali
fornia Paying Company, appeared before
the committee and charged the Superin
tendent with showing partiality to cer
tain contractors, with allowing jobs to be
iin'shed after work had been stopped aud
condemned ' by the street expert of the
board, and with permitting specifications
to be violated in many instances.
POLICE COURT ACCOUNTS.
Â£Xpert Dunn of the Grand Jury Telia of
Irregularities in the Clerks' Books.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors listened to more explanations
from the clerks of the Police Courts
yesterday after Expert Dunn of the Grand
Jury had read voluminous reports on the
muddled condition in which he had found
some of their accounts. Clerk Morgen
stern of Judge Conlan's court was the
only one given a clean bill of health.
Their statements were in the most part
received favorably, and the committee de
cided to have its own expert look into the
matter and report before coming to any
conclusion.
Broke Up the Meeting.
For some time past various religious bodies
have been holding open-air meetings on Mason
and Market streets to the great annoyance of a
number of saloon-keepers and their patrons.
On Thursday evening a number of members of
the Mission Gospel brancli were preaching and
singing, when several young fellows from a
saloon near by broke into the assemblage and
caused a stampede. In the melee one of the
preachers was struck in the face, and the
meeting broke up in confusion. Yesterday
warrants were sworn out for the arrest of John
J. Madden, a horseman, and Arthur Gallagher,
a druggist. Madden was charged with battery
and Gallagher with disturbing a religious
meeting.
NEW ROUTE TO
ATLANTIC PORTS
Huntington's Plan to Make
Galveston a Great
Entrepot.
NEW ORLEANS A LOSER.
Steamers to Run Direct to the
Texas Gulf Port From New
York.
EFFECT OF THE NEW PROJECT.
Will Cheapen Transportation and
Make the Southern Pacific More
Powerful Than Ever.
With Galveston a deep-water harbor,
which it soon will be, a radical change in
the transportation of freight between the
Atlantic and Pacific seaboards will be in
augurated by the Southern Pacific Com
pany, as Galveston will be made the
entrepot for all business destined for
Texas and the Pacific Coast from the At
lantic seaboard, and will also be the gate
way for business originating in the Lone
Star State and on the Pacific Coast
destined foi the Eastern border of the
continent.
This statement is made on the authority
of J. C. Stubbs, traffic manager of the
Southern Pacific Company.
At the present time all this traffic moves
by way of New Orleans, being brought to
that port from New York on Huntington's
steamers of the Morgan line and carried
thence over the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The proposed departure of the Southern
Pacific, therefore, means that New Orleans
is to lose considerable of h*r present
volume of commerce and that Galveston
is to spring into great prominence as a sea
port and commercial center.
There is now between nineteen and
twenty feet of water in the harbor of Gal
veston, and when the work ill progress
gives a depth of over twenty-two feet the
Southern Pacific will begin to run its line
of steamers between New York and Gal
veston direct and independently of those
now runnint: into New Orleans. This
will increase the water haul as compared
with that betweeu New York and New
Orleans by about 400 miles and will re
duce the rail haul by 311 miles. While
there may be no actual gain in time the
longer water haul via. Galveston will re
duce somewhat the cost of transportation
and lower rates may therefore possibly be
made.
It has been pointed out by a railroad
man that this route will give the Sunset
route more advantages than it has ever be
fore possessed in fighting tne Panama
rouce or any other transcontinental com
bination of railroads.
No rails of the Southern Pacific enter
Galveston to-day, but when the Morgan
line steamers enter that port it is stated
on good authority the Southern Pacific
will soon be running its trains over its
own rails. The nearest point on the
Southern Pacific Railroad to Galveston
now is Houston, about fifty miles distant,
and what freight is carried into Galveston
is moved over the line of the Gulf, Colo
rado and Santa Fe f m Houston. But
with the largely mci eased traffic that
would naturally follow the introduction of
tne Morgan steamers into Galveston, it
would be a paying proposition for the
Southern Pacific to construct a branch of
its own from Houston to Galveston.

Mountains Next
Month.
CONTINUES TWO WEEKS.

Camp to Continue Two Weeks Under
the Supervision of the
State Grange.
O:i Monday, Juiy 6. the second annual
Farmers' Summer School, beld under the
auspices of the State Grange, will open at
Camp Roache, in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains.
The Farmers' Camp of Instruction and
Summer School of Economics and Hus
bandry was established under the author
ity of the State Grange last year. Its pri
mary object is the benefit of all those in
terested in the problem of rural life and
raising the standard of rural comfort, cul
ture and prosperity.
Unqualified success attended the initial
session of the school and many of the
farms and rural homes of the State are the
living evidences of the benefits derived
from the two weeks' pleasant sojourn in
the Santa Cruz Mountains Jast July. The
local management is in the hands of High
land Grange, Patrons of Husbandry.
The instruction is directed by
the faculties of the College of Ag
riculture in the University of Cali
fornia and of the department of
economics in the LeFan'l Stanford Jr.
University. It will consist mainly this
year of highly entertaining and instructive
lectures followed in every instance by free
discussion and impronlptu discourse by all
present who feel so moved.
The camp ground is now ready for occu
pation and can be used as late as desired.
That is to say, there will be an oppor
tunity for such discussions and lectures on
other subjects before and after the weeks
devoted to the regular course as may be
found desirable. The regular session will
be held two weeks, beginning July 6 and
closing July 19.
The programme arranged by the com
mittee of the State Grange is as follows:

The State Granpe does not permit of the
expression of opinion by vote in any
school conducted in its name. The rea
sons therefore are: First, to prevent the
influence of the State Grange being used to
promote measures of which it might ap
prove; second, to prevent the desire of
victory in discussions from obstiucting the
impartial search for truth.
The committees have been established
and are as follows:
Edward F. Adams, Wrights, Highland
Grange; George W. Worthen, Willow Glen,
San Jose Grange ; C. W. Childs, San Jose, San
Jose Grange; ex-oflicio, W. W. Greer, Sacra
mento, master State Grange; ex-officio, George
Ohleyer, Yuba City, lecturer State Grange.
The local committee (appointed by Highland
Grange) is as follows: Carl H. Allen, Edward
F. Adams, Jerome F. Bassett.
The ladies' auxiliary committee (appointed
l>y Highland Grange, to be in charge of mat
ters relating to the comfort and entertain
ment of attendants) is as follows: Mrs. Carl
H. Adams, Mrs. Milton H. Miller, Mrs. C. J.
MeKinney, Miss JeSfcic Norton, Miss Marion

All has been arranged under the super
vision of the following State Grange com
mittee:

Charming Entertainment Given iast
Night at the Young Women's Chris
tian Association Home.
A charming entertainment was given
last evening at the home of the Young
Women's Christian Association, on O'Far
rell street.
The large parlors were tastefully deco
rated, and one of the parlors was arranged
to serve as a stage, on which red and white
lights were thrown with fine effect. The
evening was opened by an address by the
Rev. Mr. Kennedy of St. John's Presby
terian Church, after which the following
programme was rendered: Music, by the
orchestra; recitation, "A Boy's Conclu
sion," Miss Gladys Caighin; Delsarte pan
tomime, "Waiting and Watching," Miss
Edith Lincoln; solo, "Daddy," Dr. R. W.
Smith; recitation, 'The Night Watch,"
Mrs. J. Caighin; piano duec, Misses Grass
and Sadler; solo, Miss Edith Ingal;
club-swinging, Miss Edith Lincoln; or
chestra; soprano solo, "Afterwards." Mrs.
Marie Woods (encore, "At the Eastern
Gate"); scarf drill and posing, Misses Eva
Hunt, Maud Powell, Minnie Hartly,
Emma Eiler, Ethel Ingall, Miss Moody,
Laura Mason, Juliet Lane and Rebecca
Murawski; orchestra.
The programme was concluded by a
series of beautiful tableaux by the above
young ladies under the direction of Miss
Minnie Hartley, their teacher in Delsarte
and elocution.
The singing of Mrs. Wood was a sur
prise, even to her friends. She was in ex
cellent voice, and her dramatic soprauo
brought out wonderfully the feeling in the
song.
At the end of the entertainment re
freshments were served.
GROEZINGER'S CAUSE LOST
Judge Seawell Decides That He
Has No Ground for
Action.
The County Govern msnt Act's Pro
vision for a Four-Year Term
Does Not Hold.
Judge Seawell yesterday gave judgment
for the defendant in the case of Justice of
the Peace G. C. Groezinger vs. Adolph
Sutro, the Board of Election Commis
sioners and Registrar Hinton.
Groezinger began suit against the de
fendants named, praying that they be
perpetually enjoined and restrained from
appropriating moneys from the funds of
the City and County of San Francisco for
the purpose of procuring and holding an
election in November, 1596, to till tbe
offices of Justices of the Peace : and that
they be restrained from executing the pro
visions of a resolution providing for the
holiinp of such election during the pend
ency of the action, an<! for such other and
further relief as might be found meet and
equitable, and for costs of suit.
The basis of the action was the county
government act of 1893, which provides
that county officials elected in 1894 shall
hold office for four years.
The defense, through its attorney, Gar
ret McEnerney, entered a demurrer
alleging that there was not sufficient
ground for action in the complaint.
Judge Seawel! sustained the demurrer
and gave judgment for the defendants.
CAMPAIGN WORK.
Frank McLaaghlin Looking for Kooins.
The Republican County Committee's
Increase of Membership.
Major Frank McLaughlin, M. &. Hig
gins, Cornelius O'Connor and other mem
bers of the executive committee of the Ke
publican State Committee have been look
ing around during the past few days for
rooms to be used as headquarters during
toe campaign. Desirable apartments c;in
be obtained in the Emporium or the Flood
building. The chairman of the commit
tee, Major McLaughlin, does not fancy the
idea of using his rooms at the Palace Hotel
for political headquarters.
Among local politicians of the Republi
can party the action of the County Com
mittee in resolving to add to that body
one more member from each Assembly
District has caused much comment of a
favorable kind. Nearly all the party
workers acKnowledge that a committee of
eighteen â one from each district â is too
small to do the work required.
Mr. Man waring, chairman of the
County Committee, received many recom
mendations yesterday in behalf of candi
dates for the position of committeemen.
A majority of the recommendations came
from sources outside of the committee.
The chairman said last evening:
"It is probable that the appointments
will not be made before the regular meet
ing in July. Something may arise de
manding action before the expiration of
thirty days, but there will be no haste
made in the Betection. I intend to con
sider thoroughly all the recommendations
presented. Among the men already men
tioned are many capable and well-known
Republicans who would be able to perform
excellent service in their respective dis
tricts."
"the increase of the committee," re
marked Mr. Manwaring, "is regarded
generally as a necessity. In fact I do not
hear of any objection. All recognize that
the districts are large and that much work
should be done.
THE OLD FLAG.
Acting Mayor Taylor Says It Will Be
Raised Over the New City
Hall To- Day.
The following communication is self
explanatory :
Mrs. S. Isabel Hubbard âMy Dear Madam:
Your letter ot June 8, 1896, has been received
by the acting Mayor, Hon. C. L. Taylor. He
has directed me to say to you that, complying
with your patriotic request, proper instructions
have been issued to the various officers to
unfurl the flag on Saturday, June 13, 18!>(!, in
commemoration of its adoption by Congress
119 years ago.
He fully indorses the patriotism that
prompted your letter and the spirit that has
been the grand motive that has called your
society into being.
He believes that our institutions are worthy
of purest love, and that societies like yours are
eloquent evangels carrying the sacred torch of
National love. Very respectfully,
Taylor Rogers, Mayor's Clerk.
YESTERDAY'S FIRE RECORD.
The Department Called Oat to Ext in-
guUk a Number of Blaze*.
The Fire Department was called out to ex
tinguish a blaze in a two-story frame dwelling
house, occupied by J. W. Larios, at 845 Fif
teenth avenue, early yesterday morning. A
number of inquisitive rodents, in an endeavor
to open a box of matches, started the fire,
which damaged the building to the extent of
$25.
As the fire engines were about to return to
their various quarters Captain Comstock of
the Underwriters' Fire Patrol noticed flames
issuing from the roof of J. Lillerd's bakery
corner of San Bruno road and Silver avenue
The department started on a race to the fire
but despite its haste the building and iv con
tents were totally destroyed. The loss on the
building and furniture will not fall short of
$1500.
An alarm was sounded through box 351 yes
terday at 9 :30 p. M. for a fire in a frame dwell
iriE-house, occupied by Charles Raggaso, at
314 Broadway. A lamp exploded and caused
the blaze. The damage done to the house and
its contents amounts to about $20.
The alarm from box 39 at 7:30 r. m. was tor
a blaze from a defective chimney, in Henry-
Moss' saloon, 251 Spear street. The loss was
nominal.

The oldest and best-known Republican
club in San Francisco is the "Howard."
THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF HOWARD REPUBLICAN
CLUB FOR 1896.
Prior to 1880â the date of the birth of this
clvb â there was no such thing known to
the politicians as a Republican club south
of Market street.
The Tenth Ward was absolutely claimed
byHhe Democrats, and this claim remained
undisputed to such an eitent that in the
early political history of San Francisco,
when Supervisors were elected exclusively
by wards, there was no such thing to be
expected as that the Tenth Ward would
return anything but an out-and-out, dyed
in-the-hair Democrat.
This being the condition of affairs in that
fertile valley, there were no inducements
to start Republican clubs or even think of
rallvint; the few lonely residents belonging
to the minority together on the eve of a
campaign, and in the majority of cases at
an election other than a Presidential the
few solitary voters whose political faith
had been pinned to the policy of Abraham I
Lincoln remained at home and permitted I
their neighbors to conduct the election as
good Democrats generally do by rolling in
as large a majority for their candidate as
would insure his election beyond a perad
venture.
With the nomination of James A. Gar
field in 1880 a change came over the polit
ical horizon of the Tenth Ward. At that
time the young Native Sons begun to show
their strength as a political factor in the
ranks of both parties and, unlike their
predecessors, they thought for themselves
and voted as they thought without wait
ine to be told for whom to vote. Among
those young men at that time was one who
had convinced his young associates that
he knew a thing or two about politics him
self. His advice and counsel was sought
to that degree that he soon became a pro
vincial leader in the Tenth Ward. This
young man was none other than Philip J.
Crimmins, who since that period has be
come so well known by the politicians, not
only of this City but of the whole State,
as a young man who has shown his ability
to become a local leader of his party, and,
to-day, while not an actual leader, his ad
vice and counsel have been sought by the
foremost men at the head of the political
party in this City.
From the brain of this same Phil Crim
mins emanated the Howard (Jlub, and to
his judgment and generalship must be at
tributed whatever laurels the club has
won and fastened upon its banner, as bat
tle victories are in reality the individual
victories of the founder of the Howard
Club.
In 1879 Phil Crimmins, B. F. Dougherty,
\>. T. Sesnon, D. J. Crowley, James Cun
ningham, 'lhomas F.Donahue, John E.
Green, Thomas Flynn, Judee J. C. B.
Hebbard, 11. E. Hall, J. P. Rice. Robert
Williams, Fred Freyâ all of whom have
continued their membership right through
with the clubâ and about a dozen other
young men whose residences were in the
Tenth Ward, joined together and formed
the Howard Club, which they had incor
porated, first as a social organization, in
which the daily papers and other litera
ture were subscribed for and the club
roomn made social and conventional to its
members.
This continued until the following year,
when the Republican convention nomina
ted Gartield. Then the social feature,
while continuing, had added politics to its
usefulness, and irom that day to thia the
influence of the Howard Club has been
courted by every Republican nominee
wlio hoped to win out in the race for
municipal office.
The headquarters of the club was located
on the southwest corner of Third and
Howard streets for fourteen years, and
until about two years ago, a Democratic
office-holder, with an eye to business,
leased the corner where the club held forth
and put his brother in as a tenant to sell
Democratic whisky to such patrons as
were able to pay for the same.
This Democratic interference with the
boys of the Howard Club was not their
tirst experience, however, as attempt after
attempt had been made to stuff the club
roll with Democratic names for the pur
pose of prosÂ«lytinc the members and
swinging the club over on the eve of a
campaign contest. This defection, had it
been accomplished, would as a matter of
course tend to weaken the influence of the
Republicans throughout the City. But all
those attempts failed. Crimmin3 and his
first lieutenant, B. J. Dougherty, circum
vented every attack and kept the club
within the Republican fold.
This last deal had the effect, However, of
driving the Howards to more congenial
quarters, and since that time their meet
ings have been held in Pythian Castle on
Market street. But this fenancy will only
be temporary, as the officers of the club
are now looking for suitable quarters into
which they will move and from which
some good active political work for the
campaign of 1896 may be expected.
The first president of the club was James
Cunningham, in 1880. Following in the
order of their names are those who pre
sided over the destiny of the Howard
since that time: Thomas F. Donahue,
Thomas C. Tully, Frank W. Covey, Judae
Frank Gray and the present presiding
officer, Christopher E. Newman, with the
following executive officers, who now have
charge of the welfare of the club: First
vice-president, Fred Frey; second vice
president, E. H. Lutgens; third vice-pres
ident, Thomas Mc.Dermott; recording sec
retary, Thomas Graham; financial secre
tary," D. J. Crowley; treasurer, Fred
EgÃers.
The executive committee, which does
the real work of the club, is composed of
the following members: Chairman, Phil
J. Crimmins; W. J. Blatner, B. J. Dough
erty, George Bryant, T. W. Fiemming,
T. J. Fellows, F.Coryn and John Grief.
The Howard boys'are in it for the pres
ent campaign, and will no doubt Eive a
good account of the club, with its 200 act
ive, energetic young men, all well versed
in the science of politics and campaign
strategy. The Republican standard-bearer,
as well as those who will be nominated for
legislative and municipal honors, may be
assured of the support of the entire club.
The present membership does not exceed
200, but this, small as it may appear when
compared with other Republican clubs
having a thousand or more members en
rolled, does not lessen the power or influ
ence of this club, from the fact that those
200 trained men can and have knocked
four times their number hors de combat
on a political issue. This is in conse
quence of the excellent training and gen
eralship of their leader, who never with
draws his outside sentinel until the last
ballot has been put on the string and the
returns safely locked in the City's vault.
The financial side of the Howards is
always attended to by its own members,
and never in its history has it asked for or
received one dollar from any candidate or
from the State, Central or County Com
mittee to tide over a financial chasm, but
generously pays its own way and with be
coming dignity holds its head high in the
air with loity pride, looking upon its past
history and usefulness to principles of the
party to which it is pledged and which
it has contributed to retain in power and
control of the National, State and City
governments.
INJURED BY A CABLE-CAR.
Charles J. Miller Run Down on Jones
Street Last Night.
Charles J. Miller, who is employed in an
undertaking establishment at 957 Mission
street, was badly injured late last night by a
Jones-street cable-car on Golden Gate avenue.
The accident was witnessed by John M.
Newbert, who was on one of the cars. He said
that Miller was on the southbound car. When
the car reached the north side of the avenue
Miller stepped off the car and did not heed the
approach of the northbound car on the other
track.
In a second the car had knocked him down.
In an instant the gripman had the car at a
standstill, anil Miller was only rolled over
once by the fender, so quickly did the brakes
operate. However, he was held firm by the
fender and one wheel, which was on his right
hand. Newbert and several others raised the
j car and ran it back a short distance, but. as
I they were removing the injured man the car
was started lorward again, being on a down
grade. The next time trie wheels were locked
and Miller was removed.
Tne injured man remained on the sidewalk
forty minutes waiting for the police patrol
wngon to arrive from the North End police
station. The City Hail wagon was away on
another mission. When taken to the hospital
it was found that Miller's left leg was broken
in two places, his right hand was badly cut
and his scalp lacerated in several places. The
shock to his system was also very severe.
Whether or not he sustained internal injuries
I could not be learned unil later.
A DOCTOR'S VICTIM
MrÂ«. Catherine Jakooleff Accuses Dr.
S. P. Hall of Malpractice.
Mrs. Catherine Jakooleff, a seamstress, who
I lives at 229>Â£ Sixth street, was sent to the Re
! ceiving Hospital last evening suffering trom
the effects of malpractice on the part of a
physician. The woman's husband left her a
month ago and went back to his home in lius
| si a. Since then Mrs. Jakooleff has been work
ing for a tailor named Simonoff, who has a
shop on Golden Gate avenue, near Market
street.
Yesterday afternoon the woman did not
work, but called upon friends on Hoard man
I place, off Golden Gate avenue. While there
| she became very ill, and her friends sent for
i Dr. Gruening on Larkin street.
The doctor did not take long to ascertain the
cause of the trouble and he sent at once to the
Receiving Hospital for the ambulance.
Dr. Fitzgibbou did all in his power to alle
i viate the woman's sufferings, and a little later
i he s?nt her to the City and County Hospital.
Before leaving she told Dr. Fitzgibbon that a
week ago she vfstted Dr. S. P. Hall, on McAl
lister street, and she gave. him $20 for a treat
ment which has since caused her much misery.
Dr. Fitzgibbon states that unless peritoniles
sets in the woman will probably recover.

Fair Case Set for Trial
The Fair will case has been set tor August 1,
peremptorily.
CLAIMS HEWLETT
WAS HER FATHER
Mrs. Offutt of Sonoma
County Would Break
the Will.
SCORNS FIVE HUNDRED.
She Begins Suit to Get Her
Share of a $150,000 '
Fortune.
A SECOND FLORENCE BLYTHE.
Known Before Her Marriage as the
Adopted Daughter of L. W.
Walker of Marin County.
laabelle H. Offutt, through her attorney,
Hepburn Wilkins, yesterday petitioned
the Superior Court for a revocation of the
probate of the will of P. B. Hewlett. The
petitioner claims that she is the daughter
of P. B. Hewlett and that at the time he
made his will he was not of sound mind.
Mrs. Offutt is a young woman about 25
or 27 years of age and was before her mar
riage known as Belle Walker, the adopted
daughter of L. W. Walker of Marin
County. Since her iuarriage, however,
she has lived with her husband on their
ranch close to the Sonoma-Marin county
line &nd near the town of Petaluma.
She now, by her own legal declaration,
appears in much the same light as did
Florence Blythe when she contested the
Blytne estate as a daughter of the de
ceased capitalist.
Hepburn Wilkins, the claimant's attor
ney, declared yesterday that the late P. B.
Hewlett had adopted his present client as
his daughter and had always treated her
as such. It is principally on this ground
that the suit will be prosecuted.
The whole estate is valued at about $150,
-000, including certain deeds of nearly
?luo,ooo, made to two of Hewlett's sons.
Mrs. Offutt will attempt to have these
deeds set aside.
The case will not come to trial for at
least two months, owing to the court re
cess, and it may in the meantime be set
tled by compromise, as Mrs. Offutt's at
torney will endeavor to have the matter
decided without the publicity of & court
trial.
P. B. Hewlett, a widower, 76 years of
age, residing at 30 Rincon place, died
January 1, 1896. He left a will dated
August 8, 1892, with codicils added in
1893, naming George K. Porter, Frederick
Hewlett, J. D. Wilson and E. T. Hewlett
as executors. His estate was appraised at
; $52,620.
Mr. Hewlett's family consisted of three
sons,. Edmund P. Hewlett, aged 51 years;
George Hewlett, aged 17, and Palmer
Hewlett, aged 10. He had been twice
married, the minor children being the off
spring of his second wife.
In disposing of his property P. B. Hew
lett bequeathed the real estate at 30 Rincon
place to his eldest son, E. P. Hewlett, and
then went on to say : â¢ ;^ r - <: :';-.i; ," . â 
"Second: I give and bequeath to her that
j was Bell Walker, before her marriage Bell
! Walker is the adopted daughter of L. W.
! Walker of Marin County, California the sum
of $500 for her sole use and benefit forever to
be paid from the first funds available from my
| estate."
Otner legatee? for small sums are Mrs.
Carrie Simon, 40 years ot ace; Mrs. Nettie
Renwick, 19, and Mrs. Carrie Simons.
The remainder of the estate was to be
divided Between the younger children, of
whom George Laworin of Petaluma was
appointed guardian.
In the final paragraph of the will it is
provided that any heir who may contest
the will snail forfeit his legacy.

HER HEART FAILED
Death Was Knocking at Mrs.
Allen's Door.
Relief Came From an Unexpected
Source and She Safely Paused the
Terrible Ordealâ She Tells Her
Kxperience to the Editor
of the Democrat.
From the Democrat, Mt. Vernon, Ind.
When oue of the most highly respected resi
dents of a community is known to be a suf
ferer from any disease, and is suddenly cured,
ft is but natural that the commuuity should
take great interest in the case.
Mrs. M. A. Allen, the wire of Mr. Charles M.
Allen of Mount Vernon, Ind., has long been
known to the Inhabitants of our beautiful
little city to be a sufferer with severe and re
lentless heart trouble, and when It was re
ported around the city that she had been
cured of her trouble the editor of the Demo
crat, who was overjoyed to near of It, took it
upon himself to investigate the case and find
out what Cftused her cure.
Upon calling at the cozy little home of the
Aliens the editor was welcomed in by the cour
teous lady, and, after they were comfortably
seated, the editor explainea his mission and
received from Mrs. Allen the story of her suf
fering and wonderful recovery. Sne was in
the best of spirits, as one would natnrallv be
expected to be after recovering from a long
and severe illness. She stated that her name
had never been in the newspapers before, and
she didn't much like the idea, but in case of
this kind she would relent in order to en
lighten suffering humanity.
She stated that nhe was 55 years of age and
hal suffered from palpitation of the heart and
nervousness for years and thought death was
at hand. She tried many remedies, but could
find no relief. Sleepless nights and nervous
ness at. all times was beginning to tell upon
her. She read of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills in
the Mount Vernon papers and their wonderful j
cures. She did not put much stock in them, '
but finally concluded to try them.
Her own words are: "The first two boxes did j
me so much good that I thought that I would
not have to use them any more. I stopped
using them, but suffered a relapse, however,
and commenced usius them again. Since then
I have never had a bad spell, while before I would
faint, and was unfit for work and home duties.
Now I feel stronger and better than I have for
years. "
She looks upon Dr. Williams' Pink Pills as a
godsend, and says she is free to say that they
are an excellent remedy for heart trouble and
nervousness.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements necessary to give
new life and richness to the blood and restore
shattered nerves. They are also a specific for
troubles peculiar to females, such as suppres
sions, irregularities and all forms of weakness.
They build up the blood and restore the glow
of health to pale and sallow cheeks. In men
they effect a radical cure in all cases arising
from mental worry, overwork or excesses 01
whntever nature. Pink Pills are sold in boxes
(never in loose bulk) at 50 cents a box or six
boxes for $2 50, and may be had of all drug
gists, or direct by mail from Dr. Williams'
Medicine Company. Scheuectady, N. Y.

737^
This Lucky Number Proves to
Be the Mascot of Thou-
sands.
Why It Is Soâ What Has Been Ac-
complished in Connection
With 737*
You may reject all belief in omens.as they
are often founded upon superstition, but
the simple number of 737 may have much
to do in the shaping of your future happi-
ness and final destiny. The secret of this
lucky number is not revealed , to you in
dream books, nor can you glean it from
the stars. You must look for it in another
direction. You can see thousands of men
and women in every grade and condition
of life who pin their faith to this number
and build their hopes upon it. The
affluent banker, the eminent lawyer, the
pious clergyman, the sturdy mechanic,
the sun-burnt farmer, the dashing broker,
the hardy miner, all elbow each other in
their eagerness to reach their Mecca.
737.
The vast throng who continue to daily-
seek this number do so in quest of happi-
ness, with which they have not always
been blessed. Perhaps you, yourself, have
not. Possibly you have been foolish in
your younger days or indiscreet in after
years and now suffer the evil effects of it.
While you may be afflicted with no acute
disease, yet you are conscious of the fact
that something is wrong with you. You feel
that you are nervous and irritable. You
feel that your thoughts and ideas are dull
and often become confused. You feel that
your sleep is bad, unrefresliing and some-
times disturbed by weakening dreams.
You feel that your energy and ambition
are cone. You feel that yon are unfit for
study, business or the proper enjoyment
of either married or single life. You there-
fore meet with repeated failures and from
the depths of your gloom and mortifica-
tion you cry out that fate is against you,
never thinking that
737
Market street, San Francisco, holds the
key to your health, happiness and future
success. There, at this well-known num-
ber, you will find Dr. F. L. Sweany,
who is acknowledged to be the greatest
living authority on the treatment of
all chronic ailments of the human
system. His specialty embraces not
only, every form of nervous, sexual and
private diseases, but he addresses himself
in particular to diseases of the eye, ear, :
head, throat, lungs, heart, stomach, liver,
bladder, kidneys and urinary organs. He
also effects a radical cure in the shortest
possible time of piles, rupture, varicocele,
hydrocele, gleet, gonorrhoea, syphilis and
kindred troubles. Female complaints,
which make miserable the lives of a large
portion of the American women, receive j
careful attention and perfect cures from !
Dr. Sweany. If you " are discouraged, j
down-hearted or pain-tortured by any of
these or similar diseases and desire to get
rid of them and be restored to sound,
health y manhood and womanhood, then
737
Solves the problem. Go to that number
this day. Don't fool away any more time
and money dosing with patent medicines
and other cheap remedies tnat will do you
no permanent good, but put yourself
under the skillful, scientific treatment of j
Dr. Sweanv, whom you know will cure
you. He has brought about brilliant
results in apparently hopeless cases, in
proof of which he has thousands of
genuine testimonials for private exhibi- 1
tion in his office. If you cannot call upon
Dr. Sweany describe to him, fully and j
frankly, your troubles by letter. He will
then understand your condition thor-
oughly and tell you candidly whether or
not he can treat you successfully at your
own home by correspondence and by
medicines sent. In this manner he con-
tinues to cure cases in all parts of the j
country. The doctor's offices are now, as
they have been for many years past and i
always will be in the future, located at 737
Market st., opposite the Examiner office,
San Francisco, Cal. His hours for con- j
sultation and treatment are from 9 to 12
A. M., 2to 5 and 7to 8 p. m. Sundays, 10
to 12 A. M. only. Having received the
benefit of this great physician's treatment
you will never forget the talismanic
number.

W. S. Barnes Moves for
Dismissal of the Siebe
Case.
DUMFOUNDED THE JUDGE
The Assessor Prefers to Have a
Chance to Prove His In
nocence.
MANY AUTHORITIES QUOTED.
The Court Took the Motion Under
Advisement and Will Pass on
It Next Week.
District Attorney Barnes sprung a sen
sation in the Siebe case yesterday. When
Judge Wallace opened court, and before
Attorney A. J. Clunie could present his
prepared order of commitment. Mr. Barnes
knocked out all calculations by announc
ing that he wished to submit a motion to
dismiss the charge of perjury against the
Assessor.
Nearly every one in the courtroom was
completely surprised. Judge Wallace
stared and the attorneys looked most un
easy. A. J. Clunie was the first to regain
his speech.
"I object to the District Attorney mak
ing an argument of any kind in this case,"
said he. "He is not interested here, and I
submit that he has no right to make any
such argument as he proposes."
Judge Wallace, however, decided to
hear what Mr. Barnes had to say, remark
ing that the District Attorney has a right
as chief of the criminal department of the
City and County, to take part in any
criminal case.
Barnes then told how the Siebe perjury
case has occasioned him great anxiety by
clogging the criminal calendar in Depart
ment 6 and interfering with the working
of the Assessor's office. "Then again,"
said he, "the Assessor is a quasi-judicial
officer and as such responsible and cannot
be broueht to trial for an error of judg
ment. It must be shown that he has
acted corruptly hrst."
A large number of authorities were
quoted by Mr. Barnes to show that this is
tue state of the oresent case, and then At
torney Clunie showed that he had not
been taken entirely by surprise by getting
right in and glibly quoting a few" authori
ties that seemed to show the District At
torney to be wrong.
Clunie referred to the perjury charge
against Siebe in Judge Campbell's court,
and Mr. Barnes promptly announced that
he intended to also move its dismissal.
Then Clunie attacked Barnes' argument
on another side.
"There have been no new propositions
of law raised," said he. "All tnis has been
discussed before by Mr. Pillsbury and Mr.
McEnerney, and it has been passed upon
by your Honor. Mr. Barnes has no right
to make this motion unless he claims the
right to dismiss the case."
Attorney Friedenrich, representing
Siebe, said that the Assessor would prefer
that he be given a chance to prove the
value of the railroad property by calling
expert witnesses, but tnat the District
Attorney's motion was agreeable to him.
.1 udge" Wallace finally took the motion
under advisement and will pass upon the
matter on Wednesday next.
TO CONSERVE HEALTH.
Action Taken by the Committee Re-
cently Appointed at a Public
Sleeting.
An important step toward the protec
tion of the health of San Francisco was
taken yesterday by the adoption of the
following resolutions by the recently ap
pointed health committee:

of at least thirty-four thousand eight hundred
($34,800) dollars over and above the amounts

the Health Department for such additional in
spectors and expenses as to the Board of Health
shall seem expedient and necessary for the
better preservation of the public health in this
City; and further
Resolved, That it is the sense of the commit
tee that there should be established in this
City, Immediately, an ambulance system of
four wagons, at a cost not to exceed four thou

THOSE IMPS OF FRENCH VERBS TANTALIZING A GIRL .STUDENT.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
It was ordered that each child taking 1
part in the parade be given a small Ameri
can flag to carry and each band a box of I
firecrackers to be fired along the line of
march.
The Fourth of July Committee has pre
pared the following letter to be forwarded |
to the merchants:
To the Merchants and Businett Men of San
FrancUcoâ Gentlemen : The committee on
decorations of the Fourth ol July celebration,
1896, have under consideration several pians
in connection with the patriotic displays to be
made on that occasion, and it is their desire to
advance the interests of the City generally,
with which your individual interests are so j
i intimately blended.
At the last meeting of the committee the ;
chairman was instructed to issue a circular
address inviting you to attend a meeting to be
held in the Assembly rooms, Mills building,
on Tuesday evening, June lU, at 7:3oo'clock,
to discuss the plans referred to.
One plan proposes an artistic patriotic j
illumination of the central part of the City, to j
be ready and in operation on the evening of !
July 2 and to continue through the night of ]
July 4. This being extensively advertised im- |
mediately will, it is believed, not only en- j
nance the patriotic zeal of our own citizens, |
but will attract from all parts of the State to
this City during the three days of the illumi- 1
nation large crowds of visitors anxious to wit
ness this patriotic display. It is hardly neces
sary to suggest that this large influx of visitors
will result in pecuniary advantages to our
business men very largely in excess of the out
lay incurred.
it has also been decided that in lieu of the
old plan having set pieces of fireworks in re- j
mote and comparatively inaccessible parts of i
the City the executive committee be requested
to provide for setting off bombs, rockets and
illuminating fires on the public squares and
suitable places contiguous to the central, busy j
parts of the City during the illuminations.
On these and kindred topics free discussion j
will be had, in which you are cordially in
vited to participate. As this is of great inter- !
est to you Individually do not fail to attend, j
Respectfully yours, W. 11. IÂ»avis,
Chairman Committee on Decorations.
Adrian R. Smith,
Secretary Fourth of July Committee.
IN FOR THE RATIFICATION.
The Thirty-Fifth District Will Turn Oat i
With a Big Membership.
The Thirty-fifth Assembly District Ke- I
publican Club at a meeting of itsexecu-j
tive committee held on last Thursday j
evening decided to turn out on the night j
upon which the ratification of the St. I
Louis nominee will be held in this City.
For that purpose the following members \
were appointed as a special committee to j
co-operate with tte regular officers of the
club to maice final arrangements for the
parade: J. W. Murphy, E. A. Grant, W.
R. Plumbe, Elgin McNab, P. J. Hyde and
J. F. Battler. Those with I'resident V.
F. Northrop, C. M. Depew, ft. H. Stafford,
C. L. Heldemark and E. H. Herrick have
fulL power to act in the premises. The
members of the club have signified their
intention of getting the drill corps in
readiness for the occasion. This, with a
band of music, will maice the grand parade
a leading feature and bring into notice
able prominence the crack club of the
Thirty-fifth District.
Duron Kelly has been honored with the
insignia of marshal for the occasion.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
IT WAS UNDER
GRADUATES' DAY
Music, Fun and French at
the Girls' High
School.
THOSE DEVILS OF VERBS
Wees of a Sweet Girl Graduate
Over Her French Told
in Song.
THE SCHOOL'S CURRICULUM.
Work of the Departments Personified
ia a Play by the Young
Lady Students.
Yesterday waa undergraduates' day at
the Girls' High School, and the young
misses had their part of the commence
ment-week festivities.
The exercises took place in the after
noon, and the large auditorium of the
building was filled with ninth-grade pupils
and their relatives long before the exer
cises began. A musical programme was
given under the direction of one of the
young ladies.
The choruses were led by Miss Grade
Davis, the possessor of a beautiful soprano
voice, and Roscoe Warren Lucy accom
panied on the piano.
The principal number on the order of
exercises was a representation of the curri
culum of the school by the students; the
idea, a novel one, designed by Mrs. Dean.
The entire performance hangs upon a
story of an undergraduate girl who won
ders what difficulties she will meet as she
enters her senior year and the spirits of
algebra, geometry, history, English, Latin,
Greek, etc., appear and answer her ques- I
tioning.
Another pretty feature of the afternoon
entertainment was a musical farce by the
French class called "Ces Diables de
Verbes," a very demoniacal idea for sweet
girl graduates and especially the timia
"undergrada" to think about.
The story runs that a sad and weary
student student (Miss Grace Davis) opens
her tantalizing French grammar, and the
verbs swarm out like Pandora's plagues,
and circling around her introduce them
selves as "Nous sommes diables,'' a free
translation of which is, "We are some
devils."
Then these Parisian young lady imps,
looking very charming in their cloaks of
Mephisto red, notwithstanding their frank
confession regarding their character, be
gan to entertain their victim by a song, of
which the following is a translation:
I am a. Loner (to praise),
A devil, sharp though petit";
To study me you'll find is meet.
lam Envoyer(to send).
They call me not so very bad,
Yet often I make pupils sad.
I am Cuelllir (to gather).
Never be frightened although you see
In the future 1 change i to c.
I am Dire (to say).
Fe. fie ! Why don't you see the difference
Between my imperfect and present tense?
Avoir (to have) and Ktre (to be) â
Yon'll readily see
How initioriant are we.
Then freely we tell ;
Study us well.
I am Ailer (to go).
I seem bo debonair and gay,
Yet oft 1 turn black hair to gray.
And so they Â«o on until the girl's dusky
tresses threaten to take on another color;
but she overcomes the impish verbsâ in
other words, "buckles in and jrets her les
sons," and as a reward two fairies, who
somehow had become lost among the leaves
of the grammar, fly out and begin to sing:
Oh, maiden fair to see,
We welcome thee
With vio'.ets dim and roses red
And daisicK white
And the tlur
Del Salvador,
We'll crown your head.
'Tis a Just reward
For the chosen few
Who love La France,
Adieu, ad ten, adieu.

case went over till to-day.
'TIS BUT A MEMORY NOW
The Lick Old Ladies' Home
Is a Thing of the
Past.
It Will Be Known Hereafter as the
University Mound Oid Ladies'
Home.
Judge Murphy yesterday granted the
application of the "Lick Old Ladies'
Home," praying that the name of that in
stitution be changed to "The University
Mound Old Ladies' Home."
The petition was presented by the sur
viving executors of the trust of James
Lick, who established the homeâ A. B.
Forbes, Robert McElroy and E. W. New
hall. The reasons given for the desired
change were:
"Firstâ That the name of a person being
connected with or forming part of the
corporate name of an eleemosynary insti
tution militates against and interferes
with and prevents many charitable be
quests coming to the support of the insti
tution, which would otherwise be made
to it if the institution bore a general
name.
"Secondâ That a general name would
promote the interests of the institution
and be in keeping with the intent and pur
pose of the founder."
When James Lick founded the Old
Ladies' Home he created a trust of $100,
-000 to support it. The State of California
also allowed it $100 a month. The Legis
lature's aid was, however, withdrawn and
tne income from the original investment
has been found insufficient to meet the
current expenses. The $100,000 has
dwindled until now only $00,000 remains.
This is invested at 6 per cent, bringing a
monthly return of $300.
There have been in all about eighty-five
inmates cared for in the Lick Home, but
there are at present only thirty.
Judge Murphy, before tie granted the pe
tition, said he did not see why the name of
the man who originally endowed a charit
able institution should not be perpetuated
in the title of that institution. However,

READY TO REORGANIZE.
Editor Barry Takes Up the
Fight in the Star With
Vigor.
HE SCORES JUDGE CATLIN.
A Constitutional Amendment Wanted
to Protect Editors From
Ju J ges.
A concerted and vigorous cftort will be
made to reorganize the Free Tress Defense
Association, which waged a victorious bat
tle five years ago on behalf of free speech.
The association will also lend its endea
vors toward having an amendment to the
constitution of California adopted so that
editors may not be at the mercy of Judges
whom they criticize.
The proposed revival of the Defense As
sociation has been brought about by the
recent action of Judge Catlin of Sacra
mento in committing Charles K. Mc-
Clatchey of the Bee to jail f0r 250 days.with
the alternative of a fine of $500. This grew
out of contempt proceedings. It is now
claimed by interested citizens of this City
that the punishment imposed on Editor
McClatchey was a violation of what is
known as the Barry contempt law.
That law was passed by an almost unani
mous vote by the Legislature of 1891, and
emphatically deprives a Judge of the arbi
trary power to summarily punish a critic
for contempt. It reads as follows:
No speech, statement or publication reflect
ing upon or concerning any court, or any ofli
eer thereof, shall be treated or punished as a
contempt of such court unless made in the
immediiite presence of sucli court while in ses
sion, and in such a manner as to actually in
terfere with its proceedings.
Editor Barry of the Star has championed
the cause, not for McClatchey, but lor the
principle involved, as he himself says. In
this week's Star he says editorially upon
the subject in the course of a long, leading
article:
The constitution provides that "every citi
zen may freely speak, write and pubiish his
sentiments on all subjects, being responsible
for the abuse of that right.
If Editor McClatchey libeled the Judge that
dignitary could, like any other citizen, have
prosecuted liiin for libel, where the accused
and accuser would be upon an equal footing,
and the truth or falsity of the charges be
passed upon by a jury before an impartial
tribunal. * * *
He convicted a man without giving him
privileges that would not be denied to any
common felon. * * *
When a Judge thus claims that he has the
"inherent right" to punish a critic for con
tempt he may not be a judicial scoundrel, but
many people will think Jhat he is.
It "is not only McClatchey the editor, but
also McClatchey the citizen, who has been out
raged, and through him all the people, whose
laws have been delied.
As the individual, Editor McClatchey may be
no more, no less, than any other citizen; but
as the representative of a great principle he
must be defended by all who regard common
justice as worth fighting for.
Regarding the Free Press Defense Asso
ciation he says:
The Free Press Defense Association should
Bt once be reorganized, and prepare to fight
the old battle of live years ago over tigain. As
the Supreme Court may, like Judge Catlin, de
cide that the Barry law is unconstitutional, we
should insist that all legislative candidates
pledge themselves to vote ior a constitutional
amendment which no court, however arro
gant, would dare to override.
Mass-meetings should be held throughout
the State to voice the public indignation
which we know so generally exists, and the
press should echo that indignation in trumpet
tones. For ourselves, we wre in the right to a
finish, mid the fear of Judge-made law and
prison bars shall never deter us from writing
the truth concerning any public servant, par
ticularly a judicial public servant.
"The Free Press Defense Association is
to be organized at once," said Mr. Barry
last night, "and it will he even stronger
and more influential than ever before.
When it was organized five years ago it
had bucli well-known men as Congress
man Masuire, Joseph Leggett, Stewart
Menzies, L. M. Manzer (ex-president of the
Federated Trades and ex-Superintendent of
Streets), W. J. B. Mackay (formerly editor
of the Coast Seamen's Journal), Daniel
Farquharson (the banker), A. Sbarboro,
Charles Mail, Charles A. Sumner, Senator
McUowan and others. The Republican
and Democratic conventions of that year
indorsed the measure. The Call was the
first paper to take up the matter, and the
Bee was the first paper outside of San
Francisco. I can assure you the people
are aroused over this question, and, with
the association in good working order, an
effort will be made to have an
amendment to the constitution adopted
that shali preclude the possibility of the
Supreme Court or any other court riding
over this law."
THE BICYCLE PARADE.
No More Wheel Contests Will Take
Place at Central Park at
Present.
At a meeting of the Cycle Board of Trade
last evening it was decided on the part of that
body to abandon the Central Park bicycle
tract.' Lack of interest or enthusiasm on the
part of the clubs and public led to this deci
sion.
It was determined on the part of the Cycle
Board of Trade to make the great bicycle pa
rade, which is to take place on the evening of
July 2T>, a complete success. The following
prizes will be given:
Beat decorated single bicycle, a suit or uniform;
best decorated tandem, two pairs of bicyce cuff
butioi:s: best club turnout, a pennant; best, club
appearance, a pennant; most unique transparency,
a pair of Morgan it Wright tires; most antiquated
turnout, an appropriate prize.
Dr. Rottanzi and I. Schwartz of tne South
Side Improvement Club were present and
stated aÂ» their club intended soon to celebrate
the bitunninzing of the Folsom-street boule
vard they desired to join the parade festivities
and the celebration together if possible. The
proposition whs received favorably and the
two affairs will probably take place ou the
same evening.
AN INDUSTRIAL THIEF.
An Unemployed Mnjor-General Arrested
for Stealing a Bicycle.
William Martin, also known as Van R.
Carpenter, was arrested on Thursday
night on Sixth street by Sergeant Davis
and Detective Harper, while trying to dis
pose of a bicycle that had evidently been
stolen.
Martin has had a decidedly checkered
career. In 1884 he was sent from Ventura
County to the State Prison for grand lar
ceny and three years later from Contra
Costa County for a similar offense. Since
then he has served several terms for
thieving.
Finally finding that thieving was not a
profitable business Martin started out to
win military honors for himself, and the
first opening that presented itself was in
the Industrial Army ol unemployed that
was camped in Sacramento. Martin with
little effort reached the honors of major
general of the first division to leave Sacra
mento. He was then known under the
name of Carpenter. His military honors
lasted only so long as the "army" con
tinued on the road. When this body dis
banded Martin drifted back into private
life again and spent much of his time en
deavoring to keep out of the clutches of
the law.
CONTINENTAL LEAGUE.
It Will Parade When the President Is
Nominated .
The Continental (Republican) League 19
only a few months old, but it has a big
and growing membership and will mak^
its influence felt in the campaign. Frank
D. Worth is president of the league, Will
E. Fisher and W. T. Kibbler vice-presi
dents, Maurice L. Asher recording secre
tary, W. R. Jost Jr. treasurer and B. L.
Hesseltine financial secretary.
At its session last night 165 new mem
bers were admitted and applications wer*e
received from seventy-six citizens and re
ferred to the membershiD committee.
President Worth stated that the Presi
dential ratification would be held in this
City next Saturday. All preparations for
a grand parade on that occasion have been
made by the league.
Its large and handsome satin Danner
will be carried by four men. Badges, flags
and lanterns will be provided, and all
members are requested to be on hand
when formally notified, and also to bring
their friends with them. The finances of
the league are in a highly prosperous con
dition, its members are active and enthusi
astic, and a bit; and imposing turnout is
confidently anticipated.
After the routine business had been
transacted there were short speeches by
W. E. Fisher, Dr. B. F. Fleming, Amos
Currier and songs and recitations by the
Glee Club and Messrs. Covey, Conley,
Roney and Sharp.
AT SUTRO BATHS.
A Special Disappearing Act Will Be a
Feature To-Day.
To-day and to-morrow afternoon and
evening a very interesting programme
will be given at Sutro Baths. In addition
to the regular racing and diving exhibi
tion by the San Francisco Swimming
Club Rathbun and Rand will do their
great triple-bar novelty. The Leonis ap
pear in a new act on the Roman rings and
Dana Thompson will give a mystifying
disappearing act. He will dive into the
water from a boat fuily clothed and dis
appear under the surface, remain under
the water fully twenty minutes, reappear
ing in an entire change of costume. Both
his disappearance and reappearance will
take place in the middle of the mammoth
tank and in full view of the audience.
There will also be a tight-rope exhibi
tion from the top of the supports of the
Firth Wheel by Professor Seal Williams
at 3 o'clock each afternoon.

The annual race meet of the North Cali- j
fornia Division, League of American j
Wheelmen, will be held this year at Peta
luma on July 4 and 5, under the auspices
of the Petaluma Wheelmen, who are striv
ing hard to make it a big success. The
fact that the division has grown so in
membership and power during the admin
istration of Chief Consul Kerrigan has
tended to give the meet greater importance
than ever before, and it will doubtless be j
attended by nearly all the league mem- j
bers in North California and by hundreds
of wheelmen from this City. Besides the
racing on Saturday, the 4th, there have
been arranged a smoker for the night of
the 3d, a bicycle lantern parade for valu
able prizes on the night of the 4th, and in
fact such a succession of events from Fri
day to Sunday evening that if visitors ex
pect to take in everything they will have j
little or no tiree for rest or sleep. i
Of course the bicycle races to be run Sat- I
urday afternoon will be the big feature ot
the meet. The following progamme of
events and prizes has. been arranged : i

One mile scratch tandem, one team from
each club, amateurâ prize, $20 prize.
Entries close at Petaluma on June 26.
The races will be run on the four-lap track j
of the Petaluma wheelmen, which was |
first opened last year and has since been
improved upon until now it is without
doubt the best quarter-mile track on the
coast. The surface is laid with a peculiar
cement rocK, allowing a smooth finish and
giving it great speed qualities. It has
been especially prepared for the division
meet and altogether the track will be
found fast and absolutely safe at any rate
of speed. Ten men may be started in a
scratch event. Some of the track dimen
sions are: Home stretch, 35 feet wide;
back stretch, 40 feet; turns 25 to 30 feet.
Some new features are to be introduced
at this meet, which will tend to enliven
the contests considerably. The breaking
of a world's record will be rewarded ; if
by a professional, with $100 in gold coin;
if by* an amateur, with a $35 diamond.
Some of the other inducements offered for
speed are :
For the rider ahead at end of first lap in the
final of the half-mile scratch, amateur, $15
prize. i
For the rider ahead at end of first lap in the ]
final of the half-mile scratch, professional,

The general committee on Fourth ot July
parade has provided prizes for clubs and in
dividual riders as follows: ChiD, first, $40

Entry blanks for the races may be se
cured by addressing Thomas Maclay. secre
tary race meet committee Petaluma
Wheelmen, Petaluma, Cal., and to him
all entry blanks should be returned when
filled out.
It is the duty of every league member
in California to lend his support to the
division meet and help to make it a suc
cess, and from the hearty way in which
the big city clubs and the division officers
are taking hold' of the affair, it seems
likeiy to be one of the largest meets and
biggest cycling functions ever held in the
State. The league has grown in popular
ity and importance to such a degree that a
league member now feels that he amounts
to someting besides merely belonging to a
wheeling organization together with fifty
thousand other souls. And the ad
vantages to be gained from a membership
in the league are so many, at a minimum
of expense, $1 per year, that it seems
poor economy for any wheelman not to
join. Applications and fuli data regard
ing the league may be had by addressing
the cycling editor of The Call.

The meeting of the California Cycling
Club last Monday evening was largely at
tended. Captain Mayo read a very well
written report of the Sunday's club run to
San Leandro. Haywards and Lake Chabot.
The mile handicap road race held by the
club at San Leandro last Sunday was won
by Van Dyne, with Birdsall second and
Theisen third. The time of the fastest
heat was 2:23. The club will celebrate its
fourth anniversary with the annual club
dinner, to be held on the evening of June
27. Indications point to a large attend
ance and a pleasant time
Many members of the California Cycling
Club are in training for the five-mile road
race to be held on Sunday, June 21. The
list of entries is already large. A new
course has been selected, starting on the
backstretch of the triangle, near San
Leandro, following the triangle course to
the junction of Haywards road and finish
ing in Haywards. While not official, the
course is fast, aa the roads are good and
the turns safe. A club smoker is one of
the events of the near future planned by
the Californias.
What promises to be one of the prettiest
races of the year'will be that scheduled to
take nlace at Manhattan Beach track July
25, between Walter Sanger, Eddie Bald
and Tom Cooper, three of the fastest men
on the American track. The match was
arranged by Dan Smith, representing the
New York Herald, and the occasion will
be the annual Herald meet for the benefit
of its free-ice fund. Otto Ziegler. Cali
fornia's star, and W. W. Hamilton of
Denver have also been invited to compete.
The prizes will be $300, $150 and $100. The
race will be paced throughout.
The Liberty Cycling Club will have a
run to-morrow under Captain Beattie to
Camp Taylor, taking the 8 a. m. Sausalito
boat and train to San Anselino.

Cnarles Jarman will take Mr. O'Brien's
former office of lieutenant.
Dan E. Whitman, the speedy Los Ange
les rider, is in the City, and will ride at
the league meet at Petaluma on July 4.
He is in good shape and is riding faster
than ever before.
Captain Argenti has arranged a picnic
run of the Camera Club Cyclists for to
morrow to the vicinity of Camp Taylor.
The party will leave on the Ba. m. Sau
salito ferry and take the train as tar as
San Anselmo. Those not desiring to ride
the entire distance from there can proceed
by train to San Geronimo and there await
those who start from San Anselmo, thus
avoiding that bugbear of ;he Camp Taylor
trip, Whites Hill, which is not such a
hard climb after all, once you have reached
the top of it. A picturesque place will be
chosen on the Lagunitas Creek for lunch
ing. The entire distance round trip is but
22 miles from San Anselmo or 12 miles
from San Geronimo, and it is such easy
pleasant riding it is expected a great many
of the ladies of the club will make the
trip.
The Golden Gate Cycling Club will give
a party next Tuesday evening at its new
clnbrooms, Howard and Seventeenth
streets. In about a fortnight the club will
hold a tryout over the San Mateo-San
Carlos course to select a team for the.
twenty-mile Associated Clubs race next
month.
There seems to be some misunderstand
ing among those interested in cycle-racing
here as to the exact whereabouts of
Charley Wells, and the report was current
yesterday that he had returned to this
City. As stated in The Call last Satur
day, Wells was taken ill in Los Angeles
and the circuit-ci;asers went East without
him, but he has since followed on and is
now at Galveston, Tex., and ha 3no idea
of returning to the coast at present.
R. P. Aylward, Ziegler's trainer, writes
me from Galveston that Ziegler would tile
charges with the National racing board
against Tom Cooper and George Grant lor
an alleged foul during the one-mile pro
fessional race at Chester Park, Cincinnati,
May 16. The matter is creating an im
mense amount of talk in Eastern wheeling
circles where it has become known, as
Cooper and Grant would undoubtedly be
suspended if Ziegler's claims of crooked
work on their part were proven, and he
is said to have a strong case. Aylward
says that Ziegler paced the first lap of the
race and then dropped back, waiting for
some oue else to come to the front, but no
one would and he had to keep the pace.
On the last lap he was leading on the pole
and heard Grant yell to Cooper, "Come on,
Tom, I'll pull you through. Then. Zieg
ler alleges, Grant deliberately crowded him
off the track on to the grass and
kept him off for some distance, and
when Ziegler got back on the tracfc he
was fuliy twenty yards behind, with
Grant, Allen and Cooper setting a
hot clip for the tape. Ziegler, however,
kept right after them and managed to
land in third place, with Cooper first, Al
len second and Grant fourth. Zitgier
protested to Referee Croninger, who
promptly disqualified Grant for the next
event. Ziegler and Grant had a heated
discussion at the training quarters after
the race, and Grant later apologized to
Ziegler for his alleged act. From the
grand stand it was plainly visible that
Ziegler was forced off the track, but how it
occurred could not be seen.
It is quite likely that Cooper and Grant
may be indefinitely suspended for this
piece of crooked work. The two have been
working together on some "t>ot-hunting'
trip 3 and twice rode against Ziegler, who
competed, though out of condition, at the
request of the meet promoters, as he is a
great drawing card. Cooper and Grant
have thus far not ridden on the National
circuit, and they would not dare to try
such tricks there. One can imagine them
trying to crowd off Wells or Terrill, Bald,
Sanger or Coulter, all 200-pounders. They
would never know what struck them.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen of this
City and the Reliance Club Wheelmen of
Oakland will have a joint club run to-mor
row to Woodside, San Mateo County, via
Redwood City. Both clubs expect to turn
out in large numbers and the trip should
be a pleasant one.
The defeat of John S. Johnson abroad
by three foreign riders has been the sub
ject of considerable comment. That this
rider, who has proved himself a prize
winner and champion on this side of the
water, should be so unmercifully trounced
by men who would not stand a ghost of a
show against at least four American
riders, is 1 naturally a matter that has
proved irritable to the sensitive natures of
Americans who look upon successful con
quests in Europe as a matter of course.
But it must be understood that racing in
France is much different from the way it
is conducted in this country. Over there
a champion cyclist is the envied of the
I envied. He is feted and treated like a
lord while his star is in the ascendency,
but let him fall and the sympathies of the
people fly to his conqueror. Naturally
an intrepid race, the Frenchmen make
the most of their nerve, particularly in
cycle racing, where there are so many
competitors, and where it is a hard matter
to remain on top very long. The tracks
over there are very small and well banked.
To see the riders skurrying around the
turns or into the stretch is worth going
miles to witness. They do not know what
fear is, and American racing men must be
come accustomed to such competition.
The method of pacemaking in vogue in
France has been cot down to a system,
and French racing men know how to fol
low pace. Under such circumstances it is
not to be wondered at that Johnson has as
yet made but a poor showing. Three more
Americans will soon be competing on the
other side, Wheeler, Murphy and Riser.
Wheeler understands the tactics of the
men he must meet, for he has defeated the
best of them in international champion
ships. Riser and Murphy will soon be
initiated.
There will be three bicycle road races

GUN AND DOG.
Recreation, Olympic and Lincoln
Gun Clubs' Shoot To- Morrow.
On Sunday the Recreation, Olympic and
Lincoln Gun clubs will hold their monthly
inanimate target shooting matches at the
Lincoln grounds, Alameda Point. The
Empire Club has offered splendid induce
ments to sportsmen who will contest in an
open shoot for valuable prizes on Sunday
afternoon at Alameda Point.
The club will hold its monthly contest
in the forenoon.
The dog-fanciers have commenced to
discuss the next field-trial contests, which
will undoubtedly be held near Bakers
field. The entries for the derby will close
with J. H. Kilgariff, the secretary, on
July 1.
'lhe Pacific Kennel Club will hold its
annual meeting and election of officers on
Wednesday evening next. A large attend
ance will undoubtedly be present, as busi
ness of more than ordinary importance
will be transacted.
In all probability the present officials
will be re-elected as they have done ex
cellent service. The club has always kept
in mind that it is the worst of policy to
remove from office men who have proven
themselves good and faithful servants.
The old adage, let well enough alone, will
not be forgotten by tne members who will
cast their ballots on Wednesday evening.
A breeder of some years' experience, but
whose modesty will not permit him to
subscribe his name, shies his castor into
the ring with the following challenge, says
the American Field: "Will some one of
the very many breeders of high-class fox
terriers and cocker spaniels tell me why it
is that the fox terrier is allowed a long leg
to win with, while the cocker spaniel must
be very low in the leg in order to win? I
have been reading Stonehenge in regard to
fox terriers, and I can't see consistency in
the types of a long-legged fox terrier and
a cocker that must crawl. I should think
to reverse the comparison would be a
proper thing, since the former was made
to go under ground and the latter to stay
on top." Here is a grand opportunity for
some authority to solemnly trot out the
time-honored hallucination that it is part
DEERHOUND "DERBY"
of a fox terrier's business to ran with
hounds.
In his report of the Pacific Kennel
Club's recent exhibition of dogs this is
what Judge Mortimer says of Dr. Mc-
Nutt's highly prized deerhound: Derby
was the only entry; a really grand- headed
dog of great size, excellent legs and feet,
good body and very muscular quarters,
but he is very slightly cowhocked and
does not move as well behind as he should
in his slow paces.
As large numbers o! Mongolian
pheasants have been introduced into
many of the near counties to San Fran
cisco within the past year, the following
opinion of a prominent Eastern sportsman
will be of interest to Calif ornians: Presi
dent E. G. Gay of the Maine Game and
Protective Association says that if pure
blooded Mongolian pheasants can be ob
tained they are a valuable acquisition to
the game of a State, but that the crossbred
birds are ferocious and destructive to
other game birds. Mr. Gay greatly pre
fers the capercailzie and black game from
Norway and Sweden if new birds are to be
introduced into his State.
THE BOXERS.
Tom Sharkey Doss Not Believe In
Slogsrlngâ OaKland Bantams.
Now that the National Athletic Club's
warship "Physical Culture" has escaped
the treacherous rocks upon which Captain
Groom had feured it would founder there
is rejoicing among the fistic fraternity who
favor free sailing.
Tom Sharkey is delighted that there will
be no further impediments placed in his
way of a meeting with Champion Jim.
"Why," said Tom, "the idea that this con
test will be of a brutal nature is most
absurd. If any of the members of the
Civic federation, or any other federation
for that matter, had everseen me box they
would have changed their minds very
quickly â that is so far as brutal sport is
concerned.
"Any of the boys will tell you that I have
never hurt anybody in my life, and why?
Because I am scientific and understand
how to hit. I have whipped all of my op
ponents, but my work was cleanly done,
and I think the sporting people of this
City should give me some credit for what I
have accomplished.
"I suppose if I slogged my opponents out
I would be now considered a great fighter.
There is no need of the good people feel
ing any particular anxiety over the com
ing contest. lam scientific, and so is Jim
Corbett, therefore the sporting people can
count upon seeing a clever and interesting
exhibition of fisticuffs at the Pavilion on
the evening of the 24th inst.
"Why, the idea of Tom Sharkey being
called a slogger is preposterous. The fact
of the matter is. half the fellows who pre
tend to Know all about the game don't
know a good and clever boxer when they
see him perform, but they will change
their minds about Tom Sharkey after he
has a settlement with Champion Jim. 1 '
The bantam-weight boxing tournament
for the championship of the coast will
open in the Oakland Athletic Club's gym
nasium on Tuesday evening, the 30th inst.
A sanction has been received from the Pa
cific Athletic Association and extensive
preparations are being made with a view
of making this exhibition a grand success.
In the wrestling Douts the one of spe
cial interest will be a contest between
Harry Gelder, tbe champion feather
weight of the coast, and R. Wixon of the
lightweight cla-s. Amateur boxers from
the clubs of the association are now in
training for the boxing events. The club
rooms are located on the corner of B and
Hollis streets.
J. M. Whelan, a boxer of some note,
who is a pupil of Jimmy Carroll, states
his willingness to meet any 133 or 135
pound boxer of this coast in a finish or
limited round contest.
THE OARSMEN.
Stockton's Great Regatta and the
Crews That Are In Training.
The Stockton Athletic Association is
hard at work making preparations for the
rowing regatta which will be held on the
Fourth of July.
Knowing that rowing regattas on the
bay on the Fourth of July have been rele
gated to oblivion the association is alive
to th â¢ issue and is making a strong bid to
have a Fourth of July regatta a special
feature of the yearly celebrations.
The oarsmen of Stockton intend to sur
prise the local men when they meet on
the channel, and if form cuts any ice the
Stockton boys, from the outrigger skiff
oarsmen down to the barge crew, should
make a hot pace for all competitors, for
they have been looking forward with pleas
ant anticipations to this regatta for months
back.
The great showing the Stocktonian row
ers made at El Campo lately has endowed
them with new energy. They have just
received their new boat from the East, and
are training morning and evening, and ex
pect to win everything in sight on the 4tn.
But while they are training hard up
there, the boys down here are by no means
idle. The South End big crew is hard at
it, for it expects a hot race to keep a long
string of successive victories intact.
If all the other events on the programme
fall below expectations, this race will cer
tainly repay one for the journey to Stock
ton.
Time was when the South Ends and
Pioneers went hand-in-hand for the good
of the sport, b,ut those good old days are
passed, and those who were once friends
are now the bitterest rivals.
The trouble all arose over the regatta
on September 9 at Sacramento, when the
Pioneers claimed to have been unjustly
treated in a decision, ana ever since have
been aching fora chance at the South End
crew in a reeatta that is not managed
by the South End Club.
They are now working like Trojans,
getting into condition. Each man in the
crew is the proud possessor of a pledge to
discontinue smoking. Tne weight of the
crew has been materially increased, as
each man has filled out considerably
since they raced last.
The Stockton crew they know are
worthy foes. Their great desire is to
lower the colors of the South End crew,
and it is cafe to say that from the drop
of the hat the hottest race ever witnessed
on this coast will take place when these
three crews meet to settle the much
mooted question of supremacy.
The Pioneers have a clever little cox
swain now. He is George Fitzsimmons,
one of the little Long Bridge wharf rats,
and what be does not Know about steer
ine a boat isn't worth knowing.
Pop Brennan, the Pioneer's coach, is
training the crew, and its personnel is as
follows: Fred Orr, bow and captain;
George Callopy, forwardwaist; Coney
Ochs, afterwaist; John Clifford, stroke,
and George Fitzsimmons, coxswain.
In addition to this crew, the Pioneers in
tend to send up a red-hot junior crew, and
are P' work trying out three aspiring
crews .0 be the club's representatives.
The following from the Ariel Club will
take part in tbe regatta: William Mc-
Causland and Jim Wilson in the senior
single scull event, Jim Wilson and Bob
Ellis in the outrigger skiff races; and the
following will compose the junior crew:
W. P. Prendergast, stroke; Frank Wilson,
atterwaist; J. Coughlin, forwardwaist; A.
Racouillat, bow; Ed Wilson, coxswain.
The club intends to enlarge its boat
house soon and make it a twoslory struc
ture, with a gymnasium and clubronms
on the top floor ana the boatroom on the
first floor. It will also give a jinks in
about two weeks.
The medals won in the recent El Campo
regatta will be distributed to the winners
at the South End boathouse to-morrow.
The occasion will be celebrated with an
entertainment.
Al Fritz of the South Ends, who is a
delegate from the Ass< ciated Improve
ment Clubs to the Golden Gate Carnival
Committee, intends to lend his efforts in
inducing the committee to set aside a suit
able sum for a regatta during carnival
week.
S. J. Pembroke, one of the most enthu
siastic oarsmen on the coast and instigator
of the big Lake Merntt regatta on Wash
ington's "birthday last, over which the
Oakland people became so elated, intends
to do his utmost for the interests of the
oarsmen in the coming carnival.
On the Oakland CreeK, June 27, the Ala
meda Boating and Swimming Club will
hold a club regatta.
The races will consist of outrigger skiff
events and a barge race.
Dr. Cecil Dennis and Fred Avers will
contest in the senior outrigger event. The
winner will row at Stockton. S. J. Pem
broke will also row for the club at the
Stockton re atta.
The Alaraedas have about eight cracka
jack outrigger skiffmen in training, and
say it will be a disappointment to them,
as it will be to the other clubs, if the ju
nior outrigger skiff race at the Stockton
regatta is eliminated, for a great mpny men
are in training for it.
Rowing has taken the fancy of the
League of the Cross Cadets and large num
bers have already applied for membership
to the South End Club.
Advices state that the Olympic Club
crew will not line up at Stockton in the
junior race, but in all probability the
Olympic senior crew will give an exhibi
tion race in their new shell.
The following officer were elected at the
recent meeting of the Dolphin Club: T. J.
Sullivan, president; J. B. Keenan, vice
president; F. Staib, financial secretary;
Joseph Earl, recording secretary; Peter
Yon Hadelen, sergeant-at-arms; Curly
Mogan, captain ; Fred Woerner, vice-cap
tain.
J. Coughlin will represent the club in
the senior outrigger skiff race at Stockton.
He will be their only representative.
THE ATHLETES.
Members of the Olympic Team Who
Will Soon Go North.
Captain Leonard Gill of the Olympic
Club is now satisfied that he will have the
pleasure of being accompanied in his trip
to Oregon by a very strong team of ath
letes. Gill says that unless the men who
will represent the Multnomah Athletic
Club are of the first class, the greater part
of the prizes will be captured by the
wearers of the flying "O."
It might just as well be stated now that
unless the representatives of the Olympic
Club are in first-class trim they will meet
with sui prises. Robert Edgren will cer
tainly win the hammer throw and Dave
Brown of Stanford should win the mile
race, but other than these events Cap
ain Gill's team will need be in the pink of
condition and qualified to compete against
some first-class athletes. The Multnomaii
Athletic Club people are not given much
to boasting, but judging from information
recently received from the north the
Olympic team will not have a walk over
by any means, even allowing that Cap
tain Gill has a large army of good men to
select from. . . _
W. C. Patterson, the athlete who broke
the coast record in high jumping at the
May field day by clearing s feet U%inc es,
will be one of the team, and in all prob
ability Bert Coffin, who has a record ot
bl\i seconds for a quarter and 2 mm. 3-5
sec. for a half, will go north also. The
team will in elude Captain Gill and nine
members of the Oly mpic Club.
The games, which will be neld in Port
land, Or., in the latter part of this mouth,
will be under the management of the
Multnomah Athletic Club.
The athlete's farewell to the Olympian
games is thus given by the Cleveland
Plain Dealer:
Maid of Athens, fre we part,
Give, ob, give me bHCk my nÂ»art :
But if you to swap are loath,
Theal'll rac3 you, dear, for both!
It is presumed that the farewell of the
Olympic Club athletes to Portland will be
something like this:
Mfid of Portland, erf we part,
Give, oh, cive me b-.ck my heart;
But if :bis will not please pa,
Then fare thee well, sueet Multnomah!
CRICKET CHIRPS
Digests From Foreign Scorebook
and Local Happenings.
The Australians continue doing effective
work against their various English op
ponents. They gained a brilliant victory
over Yorkshire, at Sheffield, by an inning
and 8 runs. Their contest with "An
Eleven of the South," played at East
bourne, and mentioned in last week's
"Chirps," resulted in a draw.
The Middlesex and Yorkshire match,
played at Lords on the 28th ult., followed
its tradition of furnishing remarkable
cricket. Middlesex, after playing a first
inning of 384 runs, was beaten by 10
wickets. About 10,000 people were on the
ground.
Surrey gained a very easy victory over
Gloucestershire. Hay ward of the conquer
ing team made 153, the only century of
the match.
On the same day, at Lords, Somersets
were beaten by Middlesexes by an inning
and 101 runs. About 12,000 spectators
witnessed the match. Feeble batting and
very good bowling apparently accounted
for the triumph of Middlesex.
In the Gloucestershire-Sussex match,
played at Brighton, Champion W. G.
Grace not only carried his bat through the
Gloucestershire inning, but despite the
big scores of tne season, managed to make
the highest by bis perfectly compiled 243
runs and to beat Abel's previous best
of 231.
The Surrey eleven secured their seventh
win of the season at Nottinghamshire by
six wickets and the match between Lan
cashire and Rent, played at Manchester,
requited in a win for Lancashire by tnree
wickets. Hampshire had to submit to de
feat by Derbyshire by seven wickets.
At Oxford the university eleven gained
a brilliant victory over Somerset, winning
by an inning and 107 runs.
Comiug to local matters I hear that
Sharland, lately a cricketer of repute in
Kent, has joined the Pacifies and that
Sollura and Jones, ex- Mill Valley men,
have attached themselves to the Califor
nia team.
To-morrow the Pacifies and Californias
meet at Alameda, and the second elevens
of the Pacifies and Alamedas play at
Golden Gate. Umpibb.

Next Sunday there will be an open stake
at $1 for each dog, and $20 will be added

CIVIC SOCIETY
WON'T INTERFERE.
It Decides That Corbett and
Sharkey May Give an
Exhibition.
COMMITTEE TO ATTEND.
Sharkey Says If He Hits Cor
bett the Champion Will Go
Down Before Him.
HE WILL PUT UP MONEY.
Corbett Working Harder at the Olym
picâSbarkey Walked Eighteen
Miles.
'â¢If I hit Corbett he'll go down just the
same as the rest of them."
Thomas Sharkey said this yesterday af
ternoon. He had just emerged from the
Thomas Sharkey Is Training in the City of Churches. Everywhere He Goes He Is Followed by a
Curious Crowd Anxious to See the Man Who Is to 3leet Corbett. When the Crowd Is So Dense.

Walk the Same Street as the Sailor. Everybody in Oakland Is Wondering Where the Crowd
Comes From. It Is Supposed to Come From the Neighborhoods of Joe Dieves and Ike Bottomley.
shower-bath, and stood with his brawny
arm* locked over the top of his head -while
the rub-down artist, Tim McGrath, pro
ceeded to get in his work with a rough
towel.
"How tall is heâ six feet one or two?"
And then without waiting for a reply to
the question, he continued: "That don't
make any difference if he is taller. If I
hit him he'll fall like the other bia: fellows.
Why, the shortest fight I ever had was
with a big tall fellow. That's Dunn at
Yailejo. It was over in 27 seconds ; he was
asleep then."
'.'What are you going to look out for in
particular in your light with Corbett?"
"Well, in particular 1 am eoing to look
out for Sharkey," was the reply. "I'll look
out for everything. You can't tell what's
going to happen. Of course, I'll look out
for my jaw."
Wnile the sailor lad lay naked on a
couch face downward undergoing a rub
down with alcohol and camphor to
toughen and invigorate the skin, his arms
were bent and his face rested on his
hands. It gave the admiring spectators
an exceptional chance to note the big
shoulders and the ropes of muscle that
extend to the bicepa. The prominence
of the muscles and breadth of the should
rs are something to marvel at. There is
strength enough there to fell an ox with
one blow of the heavy fist that will try to
find a solid landine on the world's cham
pion.
As he lay perfectly quiet Sharkey sud
denly raised his head and called to the
reporters. He had been called a marine
m one of the newspapers and he didn't
like it. "Don't call me a marine," he
said. "Tnat's wrong. I'm no marine.
A marine is a wooden man."
Aboard a naval vessel the rrarines are
the men who do the parading on such
holidays ashore as Decoration day and the
fourth of July. They are sea soldiers
trained for duty in the navy and are not
seamen in any sense of the word
They are usually the butt for the jokes
of the sailors aboard a naval vessel, owing
to their supposed ignorance of all things
marine. Hence the familiar expression,
Go tell that to the marines." This is
why Sharkey does not like to be called a
marine. He is a trained seaman of lone
experience: *
SharKey took an 18-mile walk yesterday
morning -over the hills and faraway/
back of Oakland. He started out with
McGrath about 8 o'clock and got hack
about noon. He said yesterday that he
was getting into ship-shape and was feel
ing as though he would be able to make
the battle of his life with the champion.
Sharkey is eoing to back himself on the
side with his own money in the coming
contest. He said so yesterday. He is re
ported to have a $5000 sack tucked away
in a sayings bank, but when asked if he
was going to put it all up he declined to
say how much he would wager. He was
reticent about discussing the subject, but
it is understood he will take even
money that he is on his feet at the end of
the four rounds. So if anybody is looking
for any of Sharkey's coin they can find
him and Needbam at the Acme Athletic
Club in Oakland every afternoon till the
24th inst.
When asked what colors he would wear
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
in the ring he aaid: "The red, white and
blue, and green trunks."
He took the usual exercise yesterday,
punching the bag, playing handball, skip
ping the rope and tossing the medicine
ball. Thers will not be any sparring till
next week, when Needham intends to
vary the training in several respects.
It is a safe proposition also that if Glad
iator Jim ever lands squarely on Sharkey
with that battering-ram right or that hard
and elusive left of his it will be all
over with the sailor lad right then and
there. The arm that laid Sullivan low
and caused him to wake up some seconds
later with the query, "Did that young
feller lick me?" can do the same thing for
the brawny Sharkey.
It does not require a sledge-hammer
blow in the prize ring to put the best man
out, provided it is landed in the right
place, and there is something of a possibil
ity that Sharkey might touch the spot on
California's pride. When memory turns
backward and locates itself for the mo
ment at Jacksonville, Fia., and on Charley
Mitchell, who stood up before the cham
pion only three rounds, the idea will come
to the front that he is likely to do to the
pride of the American navy the same thing
mat he did to the English champion, who
thought he would be in it for a much
longer time. But what a jury will do is
not more uncertain than what is likely to
happen on a resin floor inside the ropes.
The invincible Dempsey in his prime went
down before a chance blow by La Blanche
the Marine after a Jong list of victories
were hanging to his belt.
Summing the probabilities up in a sen
tence the man who lands first good and
hard in the right spot will win the contest
a week from next Wednesday night.
Sharkey will go into the ring with gritted
teeth and well keyed up to the oppor
tunity, and he says that Corbett must
look sharp. To this the champion laconi
cally replies, "Well, if he 6hya so I guess
it must be so." And then the champion
smiled a broad, easy, good-natured, but a
significant smile, and let it go at that.
Corbett took his usual turns with the
sweat-raising apparatus at the Olympic
I Athletic Club yesterday afternoon, and
j the usual limited number of spectators
looked on with interest. His chief exer
cise was handball. Members of the club
joined in this. Corbett thinks there is no
game as good as handball. At any rate he
has not found an athletic exercise more to
I his liking.
Besides pulling the neck of George Green
I and making him wheeze for wind the
champion also sparred wuh "Young Cor
bett" a moderate number of rounds. He
had plenty of this kind of exercise yester
day, for Billy Delanev also put on the pil
lows with him. Corbett receives blows in
a friendly bout, and some pretty stiff ones
too, that would never touch him if he was
in earnest. But even in his friendly spar
ring matches the wonderful activity of
the big fellow causes people to admire him.
He is beyond compare the shiftiest heavy
weight that ever danced on a resined floor.
Sharkey is said to be quick for one of his
weight and build, but Corbett is much
quicker. When they got tired sparring
Corbett had his neck pulled by the other
fellows in order to strengthen its muscles,
and they also shoved one another around
over the floor by the hands and .shoulders
in the fencing-room. Corbett is slowly
increasing the degree and intensity of his
training.
WON'T STOP THE MILL.
Civic Federation so Decides If It
Keeps Within the Law.
The Civic Federation will not interfere
with the Corbett-Sharkey contestâ that is,
they will make no effort to stop the mill if
it develops into nothing more than a sci
entific exhibition of skill and training,
such as Manager Groom of the National
Athletic Club yesterday assured them it
would be.
With this assurance the federation felt
it sbonld be satisfied for the present, rely
ing on the promoters of the affair as men
of honor to stand by their words. Never
theless they though it proper to warn the
Chief of Police to watch carefully for any
infringement of tho law. It was decided
to send a committee of their own to see
that the nice distinction between r. contest
of skill and a prizefight is maintained.
There was just an even dozen of the
federation's members present at the meet
ing, which was held in the assembly-room
of the Mills building yesterday afternoon.
Tney were: I. J. Truman, president;
James L. Case, secretary; Stewart Men
zies, D. Gilbert Dexter, George T. Gaden,
Rtv. J. Cumming Smith, Rev. Thomas
Filben, A. G. Towne, Wallace Bradford
Charles Wesley Reed, Piev. H. N. Bevier
and C. B. Perkins. The meeting was ex
ecutive.
The comine boxing contest was the
principal matter discussed and the meet
ing was one of the most interesting held
for some time. A number of the mem
bers spoke earnestly in favor of taking
steps to prevent the contest. It was re
ported, however, that the law in regard to
the matter had been submitted to six at
torneys and they could see no possible way
of preventing such an exhibition as was
proposed. The following letter was re
ceived from Manager Groom:
I. J. Truman, Esq., President of Civic Federa
tiunâDear Sin: Permit me, representing the
National Athletic Club, to present a brief
statement to your meeting set for 3 p. m. to
day. Mr. Corbett has consented merely to go
on for four rounds, and he will give to the
public an exhibition of skill and training, not
a slopging match. The entertainment will be
conducted strictly within the pale of the law
under the supervision of the Chief of Police.
The directors of the club are all gentlemen of
standing in the business community, and
would not for a moment countenance a viola
tion of the law. Mayor Sutro and acting Mayor
Taylor can bear us out in the cairn that our
exhibitions are conducted with the utmost
regard for the law. Furthermore, we always
contribute a reasonable sum to charity. From
four of our exhibitions we have given to the
Cuildrens' Hospital $1333 33, and we have
aereed on this occasion to donate the sum of
$'.250 to the Little Sisters' Infant Shelter.
Trusting that you and the entire Federation
will take the view that we merely propose to
give an exhibition, not a prizefight, I am very
respectfully, J. J. Groom,
Manager National Athletic Club.
P. S.â l would be pleased if it meets your ap
probation, that you appoint a committee to
attend our exhibition, and judge for yourself
as to the character oi the same.
J. J. Gkoom, 942 Market street.
After considerable discussion it was
decided that the Federation should
take the directors of the club at
their word, and rely on them Keeping the
contest witnin the law. Rev. Thomas
Filben, who had spoken in favor of pre
venting the contest if possible by law,
then introduced the following resolution:
Whereas, It has come to the notice of tne
Civic Federation that a so-called boxing bout
between professionals is about to be held in
this City; imd whereas, we fear that this exhi
bition is but the entering-wedge for introduc
ing again in this City a reign of slogging
matches under a false guise, such as disgraced
this City a few years ago, demoralizing our
youth and resulting in the permanent injury
of many persons and the death of one,
Sesolved, That we deplore this exhibition be
cause it is likely to nave pernicious effects;
that we call for such amendments to the law as
will prevent exhibitions of this sort between
professionals; that while we believe the acting
Mayor has acted entirely within the bounds ol
thediscretion given him by the law in grant
ing the permit, we request the Chief of Police
to see to it carefully that the law is not vio
lated by these parties, and that our committee
be requested to call on Chief Crowley to that
end; that acommitteeof this federation be ap
pointed to attend the exhibition and Bee to it
â â -o
[ that the promises made in this case be not vi
lated and the law be not overridden.
Resolved, That if a felony is committed in this
instance we pledge the Civic Federation to fol
low up the prosecution of all guilty parties.
The resolution passed unanimously and
C. B. Perkins, Charles Wesley Reed,
George T. Gaden, A. G. Towne and James
L. Case were appointed to attend the exhi
| bition.
On invitation of the Merchants' Associ
ation a committee consistine of I. J. Tru
man and Charles Wesley Reed was ap
pointed to attend the convention to be
held in the interests of the new charter.
A HERO IN OAKLAND.
Sharkey Is Followed by Admiring
Crowds Wherever He May
Choose to Go.
Oaki-axd Office, San Fbancisco Call )
"JOB Broadway, June 12. )
Oakland at present harbors a hero.
Whenever he appears on the street a crowd
follows him and when he enters a barber
shop policemen have to keep clear the
sidewalk.
This hero is a man of muscle and his
condescension in paying Oakland a short
visit lor professional purposes is greatly
appreciated by the sports and small boys.
They have declared him their idol and he
is welcome to the best that they can give
him. It is true that sports and small
boys do not thrive within the territory
governed by the city ordinances, but the
coming of the hero seems to have given
birth to a new clas?. They seem to have
come from nowhere and the average staid
Oaklander passes by on the other side
when he sees them.
Oakland is not nsed to gazing upon men
who wear the fore part of their hats on
their noses; who wear check pants tight
from the knee down, and who say "See?"
and talk about such illegal things as bets
and prize-fights. Neither is it accustomed
to see small boys carrying on all manner
of impromptu prize-fights to the unmiti
gated delight of crowds of other small
boys. But these things are here now, and
they have come with SharKeyâ Thomas
Sha'rkey of the United States navy, who is
now training at the Acme Club.
If there is a big crowd anywhere in
town, Sbarkey is the cause of it; if outside
a saloon, Sharkey is drinking lemonade;
if outside the Acme Club, Sharkey may be
exuected to appear within a couple of
hours after punching the bag and wrest
ling with his trainerâ and two hours are
nothing to the crowd that now "occupies"
the city if a positive view of Mr. Sharkey
be the reward.
The interest in the man who will ex
change blows with Mr. Corbett is not
however confined to sports or small boys.
To the surprise of the residents cf this
city Mr. Sharkey is an object of interest
to women also, and whenever there is a
crowd around the sailor boy part of it is
always composed of natty summer cos
tumes the wearers of which are shaded by
parasols.
Mr. Sharkey is not unmindful of the in
terest he is creating. In fact he rather
enjoys it. A sailor's life is a thankless
existence and an honest son of the briny
is almost as much a stranger to society as
an exile. When attention is shown it is
so unusual that it is invariably pleasant
after the marine bashf ulness has worn off
and Snarkey, although very gentlemanly,
has long ceased to be bashful.
The Acme Club has not been so popular
with its own members for months as it
has been since Mr. Sharkey went there
to put imaginary Corbetts to sleep and
prepare himself for evading the spirit of
the law of California and of morality.
Should Sharkey win, the Acme Club will
be able to get out of debt instanter. The
bags that Sharkey punched; the razors he
was snaved with, the copies of the paper
that he folded with tbe hands that floored
Corbett, tbe sponge his trainer is using,
the planks of the floor on which he trained
and indeed a series of things as long and
having as much connection with the fight
as the rat to the marriage in "The house
that Jack built," all these would be sold
in Oakland on the night of Sharkey's suc
cess at prices that would enable the Acme
to lease tbe Reliance building as an annex
to their own clubrooms.
These statements are not exaggerated.
They make a correct story of life in Oak
land.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
First Sugar Cargo From Tope
lobampo Arrives en the
Coos Bay.
H. S. Scott, a Relative of President
Colnon, to Be Made Assistant
Chief Wharfinger.
The Coos Bay, whicii arrived from
Mexican ports yesterday, will not run on
that route again for some time to come.
Trade has fallen off and Goodall, Perkins
and Co. have come to the conclusion that
there is no necessity for two boats on the
run.
On the way up the Coos Bay stopped at
Topolabampo and brought up 450 tons of
sugar. The Aguila Sugar Refinery is now
in full blast, and this is the first consign
ment it has turned out this year. The
raw sugar is of good quality and compares
favorably with the Hawaiian article. Cap
tain Jansen cf the steamer, reports that
there is a fine harbor there, but that the
place is a barren desert. Water has to be
brought from the ocean ten miles-pway.
Strange to say within ten feet of saltwater
a hole can be dug and pure fresh water
bubbles up.
"Out of all the American families who
went to the much-advertised Topolobampo
only three remain," said Captain Jansen
yesterday. "One is a Mrs. Patrick and her
13-year-old daughter, and they only remain
because they cannot raise enough money
to come back to America. They went from
Vermont, and the husband was a hard
working man. While on a trip inland one
night he fell asleep in bis wagon and some
of the peons cut his throat and stole the
horse and everything in the vehicle. One
of them was arrested and hanged, but that
did not help the widow. Mrs. Patrick and
her daughter are sometimes without food,
and yet they have plenty of furniture and
thincs that would bring good prices in
San Francisco. Her husband was a Mason,
and some of his old comrades should do
something toward releasing her from her
penal servitude.
"When the colonists first settled at
Topolobampo everything went well. A
young graduate from Vassar started the
Topolobampo News, and it paid its way
for a time. Ttien everybody began to leave
the place, and finally the young adven
turess was brought to sore straits. She
could not raise money on her plant, and
finally she married W. Duncan, the man
who edited her paper and set up the type.
They are now keeping the only store in
the vicinity, and make a good living by
selling mescal and cigarettes to the In
dians. Everybody lives on beans and tor
tillas down there, and the Americans in
the interior assured me that they had not
seen butter for ten years. While the Loos
Bay was loading I rode ten miles inland,
and for the entire distance I saw nothing
but rock and sand. Finally I reached a
Mexican ranch, and that was the only
place within thirty miles where fresh
water could be found.
"Tne sugar came down the river from
Aguila in boats, but the peons who loaded
it into the Coos Bay marched the thirty
miles to the landing in six hours. They
had a meal of tortillas on starting and an
other on their arrival. As soon as the
steamer was loaded they had another corn
cake and started on the tramp or run
back. It is hot enough there to roast the
skin off a man, but it did not even make
the Indians sweat. The sugar industry
may revive Topolobampo, but at tbe
present time it is a God-forsaken country."
Billy Moe, the boatman, started for
Santa Cruz in a steamlaunch, with his
Whitehall in tow, a few days ago. His in
tention was to carry passengers to and
from the Philadelphia and Monadnock,
and also act as bumboatman. During tbe
night the launch ran on Pigeon Point and
the Whitehall stove in. Billy is now tramp
ing it back to San Francisco.
Four of the Sharpshooter's crew deserted
Thursday and stole one of the vessel's
boats. They filled the boat up with sand
and sank it under Selby's old smelting
works. It was recovered to-day, but no
sign of the men can be found.
The men from the Philadelphia had an
other drill on Lombard-street wharf yes
terday preparatory to the exhibition drill
in Golden Gate Park to-day.
The schooner Lizzie Vance will get new
masts in at Kureka. and then load lumber
for Sydney, N. S. W.

Lumber dealers are afraid of glutting the
marxet. Although they have all com
bined still they are afraid of some one
member breaking away and starting a rate
war. At the present time there are three
schooners in Mission. Bay awaiting a
chance to discharge, and there are twelve
more on tne way. In consequence the
freight rate has dropped from S3 50 per
1000 feet to $2 75, and the tendency is still
downward.
Edward Short, wharfinger at Mission
street wharf, who has been for the past six
months acting as assistant chief wharfin
fer, is to return to his old post on July 1.
[. 8. Scott, a relative of President Colnon
of the State Board of Harbor Commission
ers, and collector at section 2 of the sea
wall, will probably be appointed to the
vacant position.

SEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 12.â Stocks were
strong to-day and the net changes show moderate
gains. The improvement in pries as a rule was
less than a point, but considering the strength of
sterling exchange and the engagement of over two
millions of gold for export the advance came in
the nature of a surprise to operators who have
been active in depressing values during the week.
London was mainly responsible for the strength
of the market in the first hours, Its purchases
being placed at 10,000 shares. The change of
sentiment on the part of foreigners was due. to ad
vices from this country that the prospects for the
adoption of a sound-money platform by the St.
Louis convention had improved and that the free
silver advocates will not be able to dictate the
financial policy of the Democratic party at the
Chicago convention.
London firms in consequence bought their favor
ites and there was also more inquiry for low-priced
mortgages from Amsterdam and Berlin. The ad
journment of Congress, it must be said, also had a
favorable influence with home operators, who
added to their holdings. The improvement was
most pronounced in the internationals, grangers.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, IliÂ», June 12.â The wheat market
was in a restless, unquiet ate to-day, the flurry
which marked the closing monents of yesterday's
session having left its traces In the form of an
unsettled feeling in the trade. scalpers were the
only traders, the country not displaying any de
sire to act under the existing conditions. An easy
tone at the opening was ascribed to weak Liver
pool cables and to heavy Northwestern receipts,
471 cars, but the price did not remain in the starl
ing position long, a covering movement by shorts
taking place ver> soon after trading began.
Later the course of the market was er.atlc and
seemingly regardless of the news. Receipts at Chi
cago were 10 cars, and 83,730 busrWs were taken
from store. Closing Paris cables were lower, Ant
werp unchanged and Berlin unchanged to % mark
higher. Export clearances were light at 265.037
bushels. July wh at opened from 67Vic to 57c,
advanced to 58% c, closing at 57' a c, a shade j
higher than yesterday, tstimated receipts tor to
morrow, 14 cars.
CORN This market was also irregular and was
so apparently because of the uncertain action of
wheat. Trade was not of suilicient volume to
cause wide fluctuations, however, and the sym
pathy between the markets mere y served to
cause strength or weakness without important
alterations in values. Receipts were 388 cars, and
199,499 bushels were withdrawn from "store.
Liverpool cables were quiet. Export clearances
amounted to 155.811 bushels, seotember corn
opened at 28% c, advanced to -'9Vb c > closing at
28%@29c, a shade higher than yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 415 cars.
OATSâ The tone acd action of oats were with
reference to the other markets. No important j
feature developed, and but little interest centered
in the market. Receipts were 250 cars, and
56,000 bushels were withdrawn from store. Ex
port clearances were only 130 bushels. July oats
closed a shade higher than yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow, 300 cars
FLAXâ Steady. Cash, 80y 2 <a>-034c; July, 81c
asked; September, 82c. Receipts were nine cars.
PROVISIONSâ opening nrm and higher,
out of respect to strength in the hoi.- market, provi
sions settled back because of indifference of the de
mand und the dullness of trade. July pork closed
s@B%c lower. July lard 6c lower ana July ribs a
shade lower.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 12.â R. G. Dun A Co.
will Bay to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the week have been 246 in the United
States against 241 last year, and 27 In Canada
against 24 last year.
Speculative reaction has not in the least changed
the business outlook. The fictitious price made
for wheat and cotton meant no good except for in
dividuals and - the change to prices more nearly in
accord with actual relations of demand and supply
only conform* to conditions which have been well
known for months. .The nttac - on stocks Wednes
day was so plainly artificial that its Influence
passed with the day and neither in foreign rela
tions nor in domestic business was there anything
to Justify alarm.
The Government report as to wheat incicated a
much smaller yield than anybody really expects,
but that has become so much the rule that the re
port had no real influence, and the principal effect
was the serious depreciation I caused by large sales
in anticipation of . the report, which seemed to be
thoroughly known in advance to some specula
tors. The Government estimate as to cotton was
unexpectedly favorable, and has caused a decline
of more than halt a cent In a single week.
Railroad earnings for the first week of June were
4.1 per cent tarter than last year.
It is not the time to look for marked improve- i
ment in Industries, and the best thins that can be
said of them is that none have as yet been seri
ously disturbed by threatened labor difficulties. It
seems yet probable that all such difficulties may
be averted, except, perhaps, the controversy about
the wages of lron-puddlers and tinplate-workers.
The output of pig Iron June 1 was 182.220 torn
weekly, against 189,398 tons May 1, while the
stocks unsold, including those held by the great
steel companies, amounted to . 785,943 tons,
against 769,911 May 1. This goes to show that
while : consumption is fair, it is much below
the actual output of pig iron, and mar
kets are extremely dull, because a great num
ber of orders for finished products are kept back
by uncertainty regarding the maintenance of
prices by the various pools and combinations. The '
billet pool hap been able to make its first large sale,
but with a guarantee of the price | for months to
come, while middlemen are still selling billets at
Pittsburg 50c to $1 per ton lower than the I pool
price and the apprehended weakness In finished
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
products has clearly appeared, nl though the nail
assocla ions by taking in two Pittsburg firms have
been able to hold prices for a time, but steel bars
have been sold at lc against Voc asked in the same
market for Iron barn. Other changes in natations
are not material but in ail the markets the . ten
dency is towardiower prices.
The demand tor boots and shoes seems slightly
better, notwithstanding an advance of 2%c per
pair is demanded on some staple qualities. . .The
textile manufacturers are â  making no improve
ment. The accumulation of co:ton goods contin
ues. Print cloths have declined to the lowest
point ever reached and a general stoppage to re
lieve the market, is expected. Sales of wool in
two weeks of June have been only 5,823,000
pounds against 12,562.000 a year ago and no gain
is expected in the manufacture â  for some time to
come. '

COALâ Harrison's > circular says: During the
week there have been six arrivals from the Coast
mines with 10,066 tons of Coal and no arrival from
England or Australia. ' The imports are growing
gradually lighter, and the reduction of the quan
tity 1 in Jobbers' hands ,is showing itself very dis
tinctly; the amount received this week Is only
equal to about one-third of our actual consumption.
Some characters of foreign are almost entirely sold
out, with little hopes of a replenished stock for
months to come. A Coal famine is an Impossibility,
as British Columbia alone can increase her output
to meet this market; besides Corral Hollow will
shortly be a source of supply for lignite, also Coos
Bay and Washington are rendering a littla aid to
sustain our supply. The | principal sufferers are
those who contracted to furnish to consumers cei
tain bra-ids of Australian which are now unprocur
able; unaer the existing -circumstances the con
sumers must show leniency and permit of subst -
tutlons. The Australian strike is still In force;
meet ngs of the managers and men are occasion
ally called, but the acrimony existing has so far
delayed a compromise. If the miners succeed in
getting what they demand, viz., 12% c # ton ad
vance over former hewing rates, It becomes an as.
suranc? that the colliery proprietors will add this
to their future values when shipments recom

\n Unconscious Humorist
Some people are unconscious humorists.
Judge Cobb of Alabama, who was on the
Circuit bench ior a long time and is a high
class lawyer, had no idea of being liinny
when in the heat of debate he once forgot
the rules made and provided by.Lindley
Murray long enough to exclaim, "Where
was I at?" and thereby unwittingly
afforded the world much amusement â just
why I could never tell, for many persons
with some pretensions to scholarship tacii
tnat superfluous "at" to the end of a query.
Of course, it is not correct, but it is no
worse form than to say "from whence" or
"from thence," expressions which are to
be found in many books of wide circula
tion. Judge Cobb is popular with his fel
low-Representatives, but they would take I
liberties with Julius Csesar inmself. So in j
drawing seats at the beginning of the
Fifty-third Congress, when Judge Cobb's
name was called, several members merrily
yelled, "Where am I at?" "Where am I
at? 1 ' till the great jurist was covered with
blushes and confusion. â Champ Clark in
St. Louis Republic.

SUCCEED KNOWLES
Keen Fight in Progress to
Capture a Fat
Sinecure.
NEPHEWS TO CHOOSE.
Each Has a Candidate and the
Court Must Cast the
Die.
SAID TO FAVOR NUSBAUMER.
Judge Greene Is Placed in an
Awkward Position at This
Time.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) I
908 Broadway, June 12. ) j
Although Captain Knowles is not yet J
buried there is a keen fight in progress as i
to who shall succeed him as trustee of the
half-million dollar trust left by the late
Dr. Merritt for the benefit of his nephews.
According to the terms of the trust,
should the trustee die, the two nephews
shall choose his successor and their choice |
must be ratified by the court. In case of ;
no agreement being reached either of
them may name a man with the consent
of the court. The position of trustee
entails no work, but produces an income
in fees estimated at about $100 a month.
James Merritt has named as his choice
M. T. Dusinbur'y, his father-in-law, and
would like the Judge of the Probate Court
to indorse his choice.
Fred Merritt would like to see either Ed |
Hackett or Thomas Dargie appointed, j
Thomas Dargie is a brother-in-law to Fred |
Mcrritt, and Edward Hackett, it is said, |
Has already done very well out of the Mer- ;
ritt estate in connection with litigation
caused over the interests of Mrs. Garcelon.
It is reported that Hackett has received
over $30,000 in business from the estate,
and James Merritt's friends think he has
enough.
No compromise has yet been effected,
and it is not likely tbat there will be one, ;
as both sides are determined if possible to
have their man recognized.
To-day Fred Merritt, seeing that neither
of bis men would be acceptable, named
Emil Nusbaumer as his choice. As Judge
Greene is in charge of the probate di
vision the case will probably come before
him next Monday, when the choice of a
trustee will be made. It is reported that i
he looks with favor on the appointment of
Mr. Nusbaumer and that he will ratify
Fred's choice.
This story has stirred up the wrath of
the friends of James Merritt, who openly
declare that if Nusbaumer is appointed it
will be suggestive of politics.
The desire shown to be the successor of
Captain Knowles is very widespread and |
there are other candidates than those men
tioned, as the position is regarded as a
sinecure.

C. Maxwell, Fourth Assistant Postmaster-
General, that she would not be removed

There has been quite a controversy re-
I garding the office, and the press" dis

that J. J. O'Rourke had been appointed to

Democratic family, ana they rallied to her

resulted in securing her retention.
BOULEVARD FOR ALAMEDA
Revival of an Abandoned Pro
ject Marks Renewed
Progress.
School Teachers Resent the Imputation
Cast on Themâ The Tidal
Canal.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 12. â Two
prominent attorneys of Oakland have in
formed the City Clerk that their clients
were willing to give deeds to the city for
the land necessary to construct the
Atlantic boulevard on the north side of
peninsula "facing the tidal canal. This
will revive the project mooted some seven
years since by the Aiameda Improvement
Association, of which Colonel J. J. Tobin
was chairman and J. Barber secretary.
Their idea was frustrated because certain
property-holders would not grant a right
of way for this boulevard, 150 feet in
width, from Blandine avenue to Aiameda
Point.
Now these holders have consentea to
allow the work to be done, and the matter
is to be brought up before the City
Trustees.
On top of this comes the statement that
the Pacific Improvement Company is will
ing to erant the land necessary for the
construction of another boulevara 600 feet
farther north of the proposed line of the
Atlantic boulevard, though the title is in
dispute and has not yet been determined.
The line of both roads will be wholly on
the marsh, and in some places will be In
terrupted by sloughs.
School Teachers' Meeting.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 12.â This after
noon the principals and a majority of the
teachers met in the Porter School to dis
cuss the public reflection cast upon them,
as a body, at the Board of Education
meetine, June 2. The statement was, that
the work prescribed by the new course of
study was not carried out as it ought to
be. Hence the results were poor, and this
was ascribed as being the fault of the
teachers.
One of the principals discussing the mat
ter to-day said: "There are some teachers
possibly who do not keep up to their
work, but it is unjust to dub the whole
body as being non-progressive. If there
are any such they snould be removed,
rather than our schools should suffer, or
the impression gain ground that any of us
is kept in our positions through political
or social influence."
A strong protest has been for
warded to the board against the unre
stricted charges of faulty teaching pre
ferred against them. The board is also
asked to ascertain what teachers are not
fairly carrying out tho work allotted to
them and to remove them.
The matter will come up before the
board at its meeting Tuesday evening,
when the teachers will receive their ap
pointments lor the ensuing twelvemonth.
The Tidal Canal.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 12. â A letter
came to hand to-day from Dr. J. T. Mc-
Lean, Health Officer, who has been in
Washington, D. C, for the past four
months, urging Cor.gress to appropriate
money for the completion of the tidal canal.
He informs the City Trustees that he has
been successful in some aegree, and has
also secured copies of the plans and sur
veys of Oakland harbor, as weil as reports
of the work done therein from 1874 to 1895
inclusive.
With the letter came a copy of the com
munication addressed to Briiradier-Gen
eral W. Jf. Craighill, chief of the Engineer
Department, U. S. A., ai:d signed by the
Senators and members of Congress, set
ting forth the necessity of proceeding with
the work. The City Trustees, the Oakland
City Council and the County Supervisors j
are all going to urge on Colonel Suter to
carry <>ut the recommendations made to
Brigadier-General Craighill. The City
Clerk says if his persistency will avail
anything, the canal will soon be an ac
complished fact.

THE SAX FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
HARMONY IS YET
VERY FAR OFF
Work of Both Congressional
Committees Is Set
Aside.
COUNTY COMMITTEE ACTS
Declare That They Alone Have
Power to Issue a Call
for Primaries.
REFER TO STATE COMMITTEE.
More Complications Among the Repub
lican Ranks of Aiameda
County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 12. j
The Republican situation was handled
by the County Central Committee at a
special meeting this afternoon. Under the
terms of a resolution that was unanimously
passed the call for the primaries for the
Third Congressional D strict will not be
issued by either of the Congressional com
mittees but by the County commit
tees of the various counties comprising the
Third District.
This action completely nullifies all the
work that has been done by the two Con
gressional committees toward promoting
harmony and which has occupied several
weeks. Only yesterday the desired point
between the two committees was reached
and it was thought that harmony was as
sured, as all concerned agreed on the call
that it was proposed to issue.
This afternoon at a meeting that lasted
less than thirty minutes an important
step was taken which, if upheld by the
State Central Committee, will totally
undo the work of a month. â¢
The committeemen present were Chair
man Mantalen, J. W. Evans, Phil Walsh,
Al McPherson. J. 11. W. Rily, J. W.
Striker, John Mitchell, E. V. Bunnell, Rod
Church, Frank Armstrong and E. C.
Haines.
As soon as the meeting was called to
order Rod Church stated that it was very
evident to all that the call for primaries
I must be issued, and he forthwith intro
| duced the following resolution, which
embodies the whole history of the fac
tional fi^ht to date:
Whereas, No nomination of a Republican
candidate for Congress from the Third Con
gressional District of the State has been made;
and whereas, no nrovision by any authorized
body for the holding of a convention to nonii
nate â¢ such candidates has been made; And
whereas, the Republican State Committee
which convened on the sth day of May, 18D6,
at Sacramento, passed a resolution by the
terms of which it was provided that Republi
can conventions should be composed of dele
gates elected at primary elections or caucuses,
which said primary elections or caucuses
should be held under the auspices of and con
trolled by the respective county committee of
; the various counties, which said resolution
I was In the words as follows, to wit:
Resolved, That It is the sense of this conven
tion ihat all delegates to the counts, district
and State conventions o f the Republican pai ty
sbould be elected at primaries or caucuses
; regularly called by the County Central com
! mittees of the several counties for the purpose,
and that only such delegates as are selected at
i such primaries or caucuses should be seated in
I the conventions of the party hereafter to be
i held; now, therefore be it
Revolved, That it is the sense of the Repub
: lican County Central Committee of the County
of Aiameda, that a call should be issued by the
Republican State Central Committee of the
! State of California, or the Executive Committee
I thereof, for the district convention for the
j Third Congressional District of said State for
{ the purpose of nominating a Republican can
j didate for Congress from such district, and
such other business as may be lawfully brought
before said convention, to be composed of
delegates to be elected at primary elections
held throughout the district; aud be it further
Resolved, That it is the sense of said Repub
lican Central Committee of the county of
I Aiameda that in accordance with the letter
and the spirit of the resolution adopted by the
j last Republican State Convention, which said
â  resolution is hereinbefore set forth, that said
j primaries, when regularly and legally called
â  by the State Central Committee, or the execu
! tive committee thereof, shall be conducted in
I the several counties of said Third Congres
! sional District by and under the auspices of
the respective county ceutral committees of
the said counties comprising said Third Con
gressional District; and be it further
Resolved, That the chairman of this commit
tee be empowered and instructed forthwith
to appoint a conference committee, composed
of members of this committee, to confer with
the several Republican County Central com
mittees of the several counties in the said
Third Congressional District for the purpose
of obtaining their co-operation in gettiug the
Republican State Central Committee or the
executive committee thereof to call said Third
Congressional Convention and primaries, in
accordance with the spirit of the foregoing
resolution.
Mr. Church stated that the State Cen
tral Committee or the State executive
committee could settle the difficulty, and
he hoped the resolutions would be
adopted.
Alter some discussion tho second clause
in the resolution was eliminated, and it
was passed unanimously as amended.
The resignation of John Mitchell of the
Second Ward was then considered. Mr.
Mitchell said he had no time to attend to
county affairs, and suggested that A. H.
Breed be elected to succeed him. The sug
gestion was unanimously adopted.
In accordance with the resolutions
adopted the chair appointed the following
conference committee: Rod Church,
Frank Armstrong and J. H. S. Riley. The
committee then adjourned.
DANGEROUSLY INJURED
Serious Accident to a Member
of the Students' Survey
ing Party.
Return of the Surveyors After a
Month of Practical Work on
the Russian River.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 12.â The Uni
versity of California surveying party, com
posed of thirty-hve students lrom the col
leges of civil engineering, mining and me
chanics, which left Berkeley May 14 for
the Russian River district, returned to
day. The boys are as ruddy and ai brown
as beech nuts and report a pleasant and
successful trip, save foi an accident whicn
may yet prove fatal to Jeffrey J. Prender
gast of Redlands, a member of the junior
class.
The lad in some unknown way ruptured
an intes-tine several days ago, but he did
not become aware of the exceeding danger
his life was in until he had reached home.
The physician who examined him and
performed an operation stated that had
the case been left twelve hours longer it
would have proved fatal.
The work of the party was in charge ot
Prof-ssor Randall and instructor Hirst of
the department of civii engineering. In
spoaking of their trip Hirst said this after
noon :
',We left Berkeley just four weeks ago
yesterday aud went directly to Markham,
near Cazadero, on the Russian River,
where we set up camp. We had an ideal
place for camping â plenty of wood, water,
fresh air, rugged mountains and deep
swimming pools. Though we did a great
of hard work, we found time for recrea
tion. We made a topographical map of
the country round about, besides doing
some ditch, road and railroad work.
"This is the second summer Bchool ex-
E edition that ha 3 been carried on at the
tate University, and we count it even
more successful than the one last year.
This practical summer-school work" has
become a part of the prescribed work in
the college of civil engineering, and will
be continued regularly hereafter."

night in an uptown office and organized a
uniformed campaign club. It was con

BANKER LITTLE.
Continuation of the Bogna Gold Brick
Trial.
OAKLAND. Cal., June 12.-Little of in
terest was developed to-day in the trial of
Andrew Root, the alleged assayer, who is
charged with conspiracy with "Big Foot"
Gordon in swindling S. G. Little of Dixon
out of $7500 by the "gold brick" scheme.
Little positively identifies Root as "Mor
ton," who was recommended by Gordon
as a reliable assayer and made the borings
lroni the brass bricks which Gordon and
the "Indian" unearthed near Piedmont.
Ju<ige Greene asked the witness a few
questions, in the course of which it was
developed that when Gordon proposed to
go to San Francisco with Little, who was
to eet the $7500. the latter asked to have
the two bricks from which the borings
were made brought into Morton's or
Root's room, and that Gordon proposed to
go to San Franci3co and leave the bricks
with the assayer without any concern as
to their safety. .This is considered as a
strong point indicating a conspiracy that
Root and Gordon were working hand in
band.

MYSTERY OF A CONTEST
Has Not Been Served on Foote
or Laymance and Is Not
Signed.
YET IT WAS MADE PUBLIC.
Aiameda County Democrats Are
Preparing a Sensation for
Sacramento.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 12. j
W. W. Foote was a very surprised man
this morning when he read in The Call
that a notice of contest had been made
public in which it is made to appear that
his seat in the Sacramento convention is
in danger.
â¢'The whole business is a surprise to
me," said Mr. Foote to-night, "1 have
not the slightest objection to being served
with a contest through the columns of a
reputable paper like The Call, but it cer
tainly seems to me that it would be cour
teous to serve Mr. Laymance and myself
personally with the document addressed
to us. Neither Mr. Laymance nor myself
has seen anything of this contest, and we
would not have known of it had we not
read it in to-day's paper.
"It is a parcel of misrepresentations,
and unworthy of a gentleman's notice.
Another very peculiar feature about it is
that it is not signed. Who is the author
of it? Even Daggett ought to know that
an anonymous protest is not possessed of
much weight. 1 presume it is another
move of his. If he thinks that by putting
me in the position of being a contested
delegate I could not accept the
chairmanship of the convention be is
taking trouble for nothing. I have said I
do not want, and would not accept, the
chairmanship. Of course Daggett does not
believe this. He is so used to dissimula
tion that he cannot appreciate the truth,
and doubts everybody but a liar.
"I will repeat now that I will not listen
to any overtures seeking to even place my
name in nomination for the chairmanship
of the convention. Ido not believe any
honest man in California will doubt what
1 say. This remark, of course, does not
apply to Daggett. The mint man is
greatly overrating his strength, and if he
controls the convention i want nothing to
do with it.
"I cannot say just now whether I am in
favor of Gould or not. If Gould is for Dag
eett I am against him. I do not think
Gould is so much for Daggett as Daggett's
crowd are trying to make it appear.
Gould is coming down to-morrow to see
me. I shall say nothing in regard to him
till I have conferred with him. At this
time I am quite neutral as regards sup
porting him for chairman. I am willing
and anxious to hear him speak for himself.
"Daggett is a millstone around the neck
of the Democratic party. He is no good
as a Democrat and his record proves that
he is not to be trusted. He is a traitor to
bis party, and even now would be lost to
the world at Siskiyou if the influence of
the railroad had not gained for him the
superintendency of the Mint. His very,
appointment was arvinsult by the admin
istration to California's Democracy. What
decent man would dream of appointing a
man who had been unanimously read out
of his party at a State Convention?
"Daggett may be a very surprised man
in Sacramento. He is dome a lot of tall
talking, but a little thinkiner would be
more useful to him in the future. There
is a resolution already prepared for the
convention at Sacramento. 1 will not
make it public at this time, but its effect
is to read Daggett out of the party. He
will never know how unpopular he is till
he hears it read. Unless I am greatly
mistaken the Democracy of this State is
not particularly favorable to railroad
traitors.
M. J. Laymance is equally mystified re
garding the protest and its author.
"I know nothing about it," be said to
night, "and think it is a most indecent
met nod for Dagpett's crowd to follow. It
is addressed to W. \V. Foote and myself,
but neither of us has seen it. Daggett is
digging his political grave with commend
able rapidity."
HIS LAST WORD A CURSE
Gustin Louis Kaeding Commits
Suicide by Taking Two
Poisons.
He Welcomed Death and Passed Away
Bitterly Denouncing the C mn
try and People.
With a curse upon his lips Gustin Louis
Kaeding passed lrom this life last evening.
To-day his body will lie in a suicide's
grave in the Potter's field. Kaeding was
a native of Sweden and as his efforts in
this country were evidently all failures he
brought his life to a sudden end by swal
lowing enough poison to kill several men.
He was found in an unconscious condition
in the Oveiland House on Sacramento
street and removed to the Receiving Hos
pital, where he died a few hours later.
ma was not the rash act of a madman,
but the cool, deliberate execution of a
well-planned exit and several letters he
left on the table showed that his mind
had been made up on this point for a
week. He had been in the Overland House
two days. His efforts to secure the poison
were not successful at first, but finally he
got what he wanted and a frightful mix
ture it wasâ port wine, laudanum and
strychnine. That he rejoiced at the pros
pect of death is apparent from this
writing:
Hallelujah, glory to God! Now I have pretty
near two ounces ol laudanum. lam so happy.
Oh, how glad I am that I can die! I know
many languages and have not been able to
get au honest living in this country of scoun
drels. But now I am going to get relief.
Hurrah! nurrah! for the opening day.
UtVTIN KtEDING.
Before taking the fatal draft the man's
thoughts ran back to his old home across
the sta, ana in a pensive spirit he wrote
the following, which was addressed to
King Oscar II of Sweden and Admiral F.
W. yon Otter.

for my qualities that I sb.ou.id be a suicide in

your kind words and sympathy. Xow 1 think
of you as the poison is "working in my veins. I
never have been hapDy since I left the shores
of Sweden. God bless you. ' A monarchy is
better than a republic that is rotten.
Gustin Louis Kaedixg.
From the past his thoughts reverted to
the present. Here his thoughts were bitter
in the extreme, and his language was only
in denunciation of this country and people, j
His lines to the Coroner and public read |
as follows:
So now good-bye, robbers, scoundrels and
cutthroats. I spurn you. I scorn you. You
are a nation of thieves and your ruin is in
evitable. But the people who waik on a vol
cano thin"k everything is all righl till the
crash comes; theii you will go down to damna- !
tion. lam heartily glad of it.
Gums L. Kaedikg, Self-destroyer.
After tdis Kaeding took the poison and j
while waiting for it to operate he again
took up the pen and wrote. In one note
he made a will giving his clothes, revolver
aud watch to Peter Anderson. He also
wrote a letter in his native language to j
John Poison of 860 Howard street. Then
once more his thoughts turned to his con
dition. His last was in this way :
I don't know whether two ounces will kill
me or not, but I sincerely hope it will. Jf I
had any money I would procure more. How
ever, I hope for the best. I took ten grains of
strychnine awhile ago, and oh how happy I ;
feel. I wish every workingman had the sense i
to kill himself, and then tne , who !
are rolling in wealth, would be compelled to
work or starve. I said several days ago I was :
determined upon killing myself. I have kept!
my word. So farewell you' thieves and cut
throats.
I tried to get some poison in a Pleasanton
drugstore, but failed. I was then compelled j
to go to Sun Francisco to get it. I went to at
least a dozen drugstores, but the proprietors
refused io sell me any. J Jinally gave up the
job and made up my mind to shoot myself
with my revolver, though I hated to Jo it on |
account of the excitement that would surely
follow.
But I made up my mind to die. I resolved j
to do it quiety, so that no uproar would follow.
So when you rind me turn my body in all quiet
ness. 1 intended to say a good deal, but it
don't cut any figure, so I will dose with curses j
upon tne whole country and the whole Nation,
and may all kinds of misery befall this coun

fornia. While en this trip he did a great
deal of work that has been of the highest
value to science. His work in the prepa
ration of the work of the expedition won
for him many words of praise.
Mr. Vaslit has been in ill-health for
some time, suffering with a complication
of lung and kidney troubles. It was
thought that he was on the road to re
covery a few weeks ago, as he felt much
better than he bad for some time, but a
few days ago there was a sudden change
for the worse and the end caraa this morn
ing. Mr. Vaslit was 34 years of age. His
death will be a severe blow to a large
number of friends.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
afternoon from Native Sons' Hall. The
remains will be taken to Sonoma for inter
ment in the family burying plat.

THOUGHT HIM PREJUDICED
Why F. W. Harnish Did Not
Want Justice Kerrigan to
Try His Case.
He Filei an Affidavit Charging Bias
Under a Mistaken Im
press on.
A presumed dijjerence in religious belief
between the court and a party to an action
that came up for trial was mad 6 the basis
of an affidavit riled in Justice Kerrigan's
court yesterday, alleging that the affiant
could not get a fair and impartial trial.
The case was that of P. W. Riordan,
Archbisnop of San Francisco, against F.
W. riarnish, in which the Catholic prelate
sought to oust the defendant from a cer
tain house claimed as the property of the
plaintiff. â  .
The complaint alleged that Harnish
entered into possession of the premises on
March 12 last, tne monthly rental then
being $5; that subsequently the rent was
raised to $25 per month, which the defend
ant refused to pay. He also declined to
vacate. Tne Most Reverend Archbishop
Riordan asked possession and back rent.
When the case was called Attorney Har
ris, who, in the absence of Harnish's regu
lar attorney, Laura de Force Gordon, rep
resented the defendant, presented an
affidavit sworn to by the defendant alleg
ing that owing to the prejudice of the
court he could not get a fair and impartial
trial, and asking that the case be trans
ferred to another court.
Attorney Harris argued that the fact of
the affidavit being tiled made it incumbent
on the court to transfer the case, but At
torney Matt Sullivan, who represented the
Archbishop, thought differently ami called
Harnish to tne stand to explain his affi
davit.
The defendant did not seem to be very
clear on the matter, but maJe a rambling
statement to the effect tnat the Arch
bishop, the court and the attorney for the
plaintiff were ail of the same faith and in
a nne, and that he could not get a "fair
deal." He admitted being prejudiced
against the court.
Justice Kerrigan listened with due judi
cial severity while Harnish was making
his explanation and then remsed to enter
tain the affidavit and ordered the case to
trial. Harnish demanded a jury trial, but
wilted when he was tola that he would
have to put up $27 jury fees before the case
was taken up. Then the cause was tried
and judgment given for the plaintiff on a
strung case being made against him.
"The humorous part of it all was," said
Justice Kerrigan after the disgusted Har
nish and his friends had tiled out, "that 1
am not a Catholic. I might have sent the
case to Judge Barry or Judge Carroll, bu;
I don't suppose that would have helped
matters much."

Savings Banks Unable to

of Interest.
TAX LEVY RESPONSIBLE.
Laboring Classes Pay the Larg
est Share of the Heavy
Assessment
ABOUT $250,000 IS INVOLVED
Secretary Robert Tobin of the Hi
bernia Savings Bank Makes a
Plain Statement.
The semi-annual dividend to be paid the
120,000 depositors in the local savings
banks in July next will be nearly a quar
ter of a million dollars less than the
amount received by them during the same
month of 1895.
This enormous falling off is due to the
excessive tax levy of the present year,
the banks being called on to pay nearly
three-quarters of a million more than in
1895. Last July the savings banks paid a
dividend ranging from 4% to 4% P er cent.
January 1, 1896, this was reduced to 4 per
cent, and for the six months just ending a
further reduction of at least one-quarter
of 1 per cent is expected.
This means that the depositors â the
laboring class being most largely affected â
will receive the smallest return on their
hard-earned savings ever paid in the his
tory of local banking.
Ten savings banks in San Francisco
have on deposit about one hundred million
dollars, divided among 123,000 people. On
some the loss will be light, because their
accounts are small, but a large percentage
will be sorely discomforted at the unex
pected cut in their income.
"The enormous tax levy is principally
responsible for this reduction," said Rob
ert J. Tobin, secretary of the Hibernia
Savings and Loan Society, last night.
"Last year we paid to the City and County
of San Francisco $300,000, and for the cur
rent year the assessment reaches the enor
mous sum in round figures of $500,000.
The rate, as is well known to every one,
jumped from $1 60 to $2 25. The poorer
classes are the principal sufferers because
of the obnoxious law which subjects money
to taxation.
â¢'Here we are called on to pay $200,000
more than in 1895. That year we paid a
dividend of 4*4 per cent. It is impossible
at the present time to say what percentage
will be paid in July â possibly 4. and it
may be a great deal less. In any event
the man who earns nis money by the
sweat of his brow is the real sufferer. The
rich are able to evade the law by kiting
their accounts from bank to bank, or
else doing business in another State.
Of course these methods are not
strictly honorable, but it saves taxes)
and that is about all many of the present
generation seem to care for. Even if sav
ings banks were inclined to do wrong
there is no way in which a fraud of the j
kind mentioned could be successfully j
carried out.
"The resuJt is seen, therefore, in the divi
dend about to be declared. The poor man,
the fellow who eaves a few honest dollars
by hard toil and sacrifice, is practically
doubly taxed. The pilferers, however,
have fixed the levy, knowing that these
people would be called on to bear the bur
dens, and they must perforce accept the
situation gracefully.
"We hope to pay a 4 per cent dividend,
though it may be considerably less; uo
man can tell at present just what it will
be, though the outlook is not encourag
ing."
The Hibernia Savings and Loan Society
is the largest institution of its kind in the
City. It has about $31,000,000 on deposit
and nearly 50,000 depositors. What is
true of this institution in tbe matter of
taxes and decreased dividends applies to
every savings bank in San Francisco.
GOLDEN GATE CARNIVAL
Miss Mary Kiely the First Candidate
for Queen.
Although no date has yet been set for the
election of officers of the festivities for
the Carnival of the Golden Gate, already a
candidate for the houor of presiding over
the games and parades of the school-chil
dren has been received at headquarters.
Miss Mary Kiely, a young lady of 18 sum
mers, who has recently graduated from
the public schools and is about to enter
the graduating class of St. Joseph's Con
vent at Tenth and Howard streets, is the
first who has consented to permit her
name to go before the public for a chance
as queen. Miss Kieiy is highly talented
ana has won honors in drawing, painting
and music. She is a tall, stately blonde,
with blue eyes and hair of a light chestnut
color.
W. H. Mills has plans for the illumina
tion of Golden Gate Park. The plans^are
quite elaborate, and the effects that will
be produced at night are said by the elec
trical engineers who have drawn them to
be of a very stiking character.
A number of offers of assistance from
various places of amusement have been
made at headquarters. All seem anxious
to assist financially, and only await the
sanction oi the committee to announce
their programmes and dates. At the meet

FOR THE FOURTH.
An Exceptionally Big Parade Promised.
Marshal Umbsen to Pick the
Goddess of Liberty.
The parade committee of the Fourth of
July committee met yesterday and ar
ranged certain details.
The grand marshal was asked to invite
the officers and men of the Zaragoza to
participate in the parade; also to ask cos
turners to submit ideas for floats.
AH applications for positions in the
parade as. Goddess of Liberty must be sent

It was declared to be the sense of the
committee that all actual industries be

Communications have been addressed
by permission of the Board of Education
to all schools, inviting the children to get
up a float representing some revolutionary
period. For the best float a $50 prize ban
ner and for the second a $25 banner will
be offered. The principals or representa

LOUIS SCHMIDT'S STORY
He Said That He Was Beaten
by Employes of the
Railroad.
The Boy's Troubles Grew Ont of the
Fatal Accident to May Quill
Last February.
Louis Schmidt, a lad 14 years of age,
who figured prominently in the May Quill
inquest case in Berkeley, has again come
to the front and yesterday he swore out
warrants for the arrest of several men
whem he charges with battery. He says
that the assault grew out of the case re
ferred to. On Sunday, February 16,
May Quill, a little girl, was run over by
one of the Southern Pacific Company's
local Berkeley trains and one of the wit
nesses was Louis Schmidt. The boy lives
at 824 Jackson street, Oakland, and is the
support of his haif-b;ind father and a lit
tle sister. He peddles pins and needles
on both sides of the bay.
Whe"n the inquest was held he pave tes
timony favorable to the railroad company,
to the effect that the girl was entirely to
blame. Later on he told an entirely dif
ferent story, which was to the effect that
he had been induced to testify as he did
by the Southern Pacific people, to whom
he was under obligations. At that time
he and his family were the recipients of
special favors, being permitted to ride on
the cars and i oats at reduced rates.
The latter statements of the lad caused
the company to withdraw the privileges
and young Schmidt became identified
with the lawyers for the Quill family, who
have a neavy damage suit in the Superior
Court of Alameda County against the rail
road company. Since then the boy states
that he has been persecuted by the em
ployes of the company.
The lad's last storywas toid yesterday
to Judge Low, to whom he applied for
warrants for the arrest of three men. He
said that he was in a saloon on Market
and Brady streets at 11 o'clock, accom
panied by his father and sister. Suddenly
two or three men entered the premises
and showed him a paper which they
demanded that he sign. When he asked
them what the paper contained one of the
meu answered that it was a statement
which would exonerate the railroad com.
pany from ail blame in the May Quill
damage suit; that it was about the same
as Schmidt had testified to at the inquest
and a denial of the statements that he had
subsequently made.
Upon the boy refusing to sign the paper
he said that the men began to beat him
and his father, and even the barkeeper
took a hand in the matter by closing the
door so as to allow the assailants to pro
ceed without interruption. Finally the
boy and hiÂ» sister and father made their
escape.
The boy said that he does not know the
names of his assailants. Judge Low issued
the warrants asked for.
The warrants were given to Officer
Campbell, who last evening arrested the
saloon-keeper, B. F. Carter. The latter went
to the City Prison, accompanied by a num
ber of friends, who at once gave bail for
his release. Carter positively refused to
discuss the case or reply to the charge
made by young Schmidt.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1896.
SEATTLE'S SOLON
COMES TO TOWN
Colonel James Hamilton
Lewis, an Admira
ble Crichton.
WILL FIX SOME FENCES.
Most Likely He Means to Get
the Democratic Nomination
for Governor.
FAVORS AN HONEST DOLLAR.
Once Worked on the Docks â Can
Paint the Lily, Fight a Duel
or Lead the Dance.
Colonel James Hamilton Lewis, the re
doubtable young Democratic leader of
the State of Washington, is making a
quiet visit to San Francisco. The colonel
has left his law practice at Seattle long
enough to get a change of air, and enjoy a
season of quiescence before the campaign
comes on.
Colonel Lewis, who is the Beau Bruin
mell of the Northwest, is a leading candi
date for Governor of Washington, that is
to say, he is in the hands of his friends.
Apparently he stands a good chance to
get the office, too.
He was voted for for United States Sen
ator at the time of tbe last Senatorial
fight at Olympia. and the t-how-ciown de
veloped that while he did not have votes
enough to prove a winner, he had enough
to indicate be was a very healthy can
didate.
Colonel Lewis is a Virginian who arrived
in Seattle in the hard days before the last
boom. He hung out his shingle, but
clients were few and the money he had
brought with him was soon exhausted. In
his predicament, though one of the
curled darlings of society, he was forced
to toil with his hands.
He sought a job on the Seattle docks
and for a time rolled barrels and trundled
a wheelbarrow. This act, though per
formed for but two hours as his enemies
aver, endeared him to the laboring men.
He was made an honorary member of the
Longshoremen's Union, and his friends
claim for him that he is solider with the
masses than any other man who could be
named.
Colonel Lewis is quite a hand at oratory.
He can paint the lily, and altogether is no
slouch as a spell-binder. Some two years
ago the colonel made a pilgrimage to this
City, and while here got into a verbal alter
cation with the city editor of one of the
morning dailies. The colonel tersely
penned a note to the editor in such a way
that it was understood to mean nothing
else than a challenge to fight a duel. The
challenge created a good deal of interest,
but no blood was spilled.
They say the colonel will fight at the
drop of a hat. He wears a thick bushy
beard of a sanguinary color, still adhering
to the old custom and defying the breezes
that skurry about in the Puget Sound
region. They do call him Dude Lewis,
too.
There appears to be no doubt that
Colonel Lewis has strength. From both
sides of the Cascade Mountains hosts of
his supporters are sure to appear. If he
gets the Democratic nomination it is be
lieved he will give Governor McGraw, if
he is renominated, or whoever beads the
opposition, a lively run for his money.
Colonei Lewis is coy about giving the
public his views at this time. He contents
himself by saying that he is the ardent
friend of the toiler, that he is in favor of
an honest dollar, and is impressed with
the need of Government appropriations
for home improvements. He will prob
ably be here for several days. The colonel
is at the Palace.

GRAND JURY AND
THE TAX LEVY
Alarm Caused by Esti
mates for the Next
Year.
A STARTLING INCREASE
Special Session Called to Con
sider the Serious
Question.
REPORT OF THE IXPERT.
Resistance to a Plundering Levy of
Taxes May B; Made in
Court.
The estimates showing the probable
cost of maintaining the City government
for the next fiscal year have so alarmed
the Grand Jnry that a special meeting lias
been called, to convene next Monday even
ing. What steps shall be taken to resist
the proposed increase of the local tax rate
may be decided upon at the special session.
It is clear to the minds of active members
of the jury that the taxpayer must be pro
tected â that the taxes necessary to raise
the amount of money called for would
paralyze the business of the City by con
fiscating the property of citizens.
The Grand Jury's expert, Horace Dunn,
was recently charged with the duty of ex
amining into the requirements of several
departments to ascertain what reasons
existed for demanding the large increase.
It seems that Thomas Ashworth, Superin
tendent of Streets, wants $400,000 to repair
cobbled streets, and $100,000 more for im
proving water-front thoroughfares. The
Street Department has asked for an in
crease of $900,000 over the liberal allowance
of the present fiscal year.
The School Department, which has
always been lavishly supplied with money
wherewith salaries could be increased,
new places created and teachers paid in
full during ail vacations, is clamoring
again for a larger allowance.
The Park Commissioners are calling for
another large appropriation immediately
following an unprecedented allowance of
$300,000 for the year now drawing to a
close. The Grand Jury hears all along the
line of municipal office-holders a cry in
chorus for more money.
The Grand Jury's attention has been
directed to a promise made by the Super
visors a year ago that the rate for the fiscal
year 1896-97 would be low. As a justifica
tion for the high rate of 1895-96, the Super
visors explained that the City was in debt
for supplies and that a half million dollars
extra to pay off all outside obligations
was an exceptional allowance which would
not be necessary in the future; after pay
ing back bills economy would be enforced,
and the next levy would be low.
To the consternation of the taxpayers
the proposition now comes to impose a
lax equal to war indemnity levied on a
conquered province. It is known to the
jury that the rich will shirk payment if
possible and that the staggering burden
must be borne by the hard and honest

worker, who has saved enough by con
stant toil and sacrifice of personal com
fort to get a little lot ol land and a house
for his family.
At the session of the Grand Jury yester
day, at which Theodore F. Payne was act
ing foreman in the absence of Frank Mas
key, the proposed increase of the tax rate
was vigorously discussed. A volume of
correspondence touching the question was
read. For a long time the jury has been
acquiring information on the subject in
order to make an intelligent presentation
of the facts at the proper time.
Generally speaking, the heads of depart
ments of the municipal government re
sent the idea of Grand Jury or newspaper
interference in the management of their
offices. When a man has been in public
office for a year or two he is apt to fancy
himself a little czar. Endowed with the
authority to order the Board of Super
visors to provide him with all the money
he desires he concerns himself chiefly
about the clerics, who are so numerous
around the hall that they are stumbling
over each other every day.
The Grand Jury has concluded to take
up the subject, whether heads of depart
ments like it or not. The facts as they
appear to the jurors lead to the conviction
that twice as many clerical positions exist
as are needed and that a reduction of
$1,000,000 a year could be made without
detriment to the public service. Still,
while contemplating a reduction and a
smaller tax levy the demand comes from
the spoilsmen to increase municipal ex
penses $1,500,000 a year and tax the people
out of their homes to meet the increased
burdens.
Robbery in the guise of taxation is not a
felony under the statute, so it may not be
deemed best to indict any one for plunder
ing the community, but other steps may
be taken to bring public servants to a sense
of public responsibility.
Merchants and professional men, own
ers of homes and dealers in real estate
have importuned the Grand Jury to do
something toward arresting the extrava
gance in the conduct of City affairs, and
so at the meeting next Monday evening
some plan of action will be formed. As a
last resort resistance to the levy in court
may be made, but it is desired that the
Supervisors having authority and control
of expenditures should takn hold and cut
down the estimates to a reasonable basis.
At the sessions yesterday some commu
nications handed down from the Eldridge
Grand Jury and touching the manage
ment of the Public Pound were consid
ered. The charges were brought by Flem
ing, and for many months he sought to
have the Pound institution ventilated.
One witness (John Partridge) was heard
by the jury yesterday. At one time he
was an officer of the Society for the Pre
vention ol Cruelty to Animals, and was
supposed to know something of the Pub
lic Pound affairs. It was Fleming's idea
that money collected at the Pound had
been misappropriated, but Mr. Partridge
could not give the Grand Jury much light
on this point.
Last week Alfred Isson presented a ca?e
for the consideration of the Grand Jury,
but the communication was yesterday
handed over to the District Attorney for
examination. The Isson case involves the
retention of certain letters now in the
possession of an attorney's clerk. Judge
Sanderson is held by Isson to be responsi
ble for withholding the documents. The
letters were once produced in court and
read to a jury. It is said that while the
letters arÂ« withheld some one who ought
to be punished is shielded.

Manager Filcher of the State Board of

quicksilver ore displays of any Board of

of the Great Eastern Quicksilver Mining

tention of Mr. Filcher to make the display

California is the only State in which quick

THE INSANITY DODGE.
Mrs. White's Attorneys Think
a Clever Plan Is Being
Laid.
HIS SPIRITUALISTIC ANTICS.
Will They Be the Basis for a
Claim of Unscund Men
tality ?
George E. White, the Mendocino cattle
king and recently c'eveloped advanced
spiritualist, is about to assume a new role
â that of a finished lunatic. At least that
is what the attorneys for his divorced
wife, who is trying to get some kind of a
tangible hold on the $100,000 awarded her,
assert.
Two deputy sheriffs and Louis Martin
were looking for the cattle king all day
yesterday to place him under arrest for
contempt of court for having failed to
comply with an order issued by Judge
Hebbard. Ever since his late wifi,
Frankie White, won her decree and hand
some lump alimony of $100,000, Mr. White
has been charged repeatedly with doing
everything in his power and witbin the
knowledge of modern legal necromancy
to avoid the payment thereof, and this
contempt charge arises from the same
cause.
He refused to produce notes and mort
gages amounting to about $4000 and also
to pay into court $500 in cash. When ap
prehended he will serve five days in jail
besides meeting other penalties imposed
by the court. But that is not the story.
Mrs. White's attorneys believe and so
assert that the cattle king is now parading
before the public as a fanatical spiritual
ist for the purpose of establishing a foun
dation on which to base a plea of unsound
mentality as a possible means of avoiding
the payment of the $100,000 alimony and
other consequences of his acts. His wild
statements about materializing spirits of
ancient Oriental magicians, dead several
thousand years and standing eight feet
high, are quoted as an evidence of a clever
concocted scheme to cast a doubt on his
sanity.
Other discrepancies are also pointed out,
which go to show that however much care
may have been used in formulating the
plan, he has overshot the mark. He re
ferred in one statement to the materially
embodied spirit of his first wife, when, so
the attorneys iay, she is alive and at pres
ent making her home in Oakland. They
say the lunatic dodge will prove ridicu
lously inoperative.

Nicholas F. Sargent, a steward, has filed a
petition in insolvency. He owes $2664 40,
and has assets amounting to $750.
