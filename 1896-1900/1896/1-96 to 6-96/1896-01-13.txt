PORT TOWKSEND, Wash., Jan. 12.-
To the long list of harrowing and terrible
accidents which have in the past served to
five the Vancouver shore the name of
being the most dangerous section of the
coast has been added another, the details
of which are appalling in the extreme.
For the past twelve days on tnat terrible
â  almost in sight of several thriving
cities, a party of shipwrecked mariners
have been barely existing, battling with
hunger and cold. Lying there now, frozen
and deserted . are the bodies of four of the
unfortunates, exposed to the terrible cold
which caused their death. These are the
Captain Thompson and three
sailors of the British bark Janet Cowan,
â which, after a voyage half around the
world, was wrecked almost in sight of its
destination.
The vessel sailed from Cape Town on
â¢nber 11, bound for Vancouver to
load a South African cargo of lumber.
SSiie passed the cape on December ?A), but
THE JANET COWAN.

adverse winds drove her to sea. Later I
again the winds snifted and despite the '
determined efforts of the crew to save her
*he struck bow on upon a rocky reef ]
twelve miles to the westward from Carma
nah Point. The vessel immediately swung '
around and soon, broadside to the break- ;
ers, was piled among the. sharp rocks of
the rcer, where she will remain until the
action of the sea breaks her to i>ieces.
As soon as it became apparent that the
vessel was lost the men set about to reach
the shoreâ a difficult task in tl.e icy waters !
and terrible surf that was running.
Finally after several attempts a sailor '
named Chamberlin swam to the beach i
with a rope and later on a breeches buoy i
was arranged, upon which all except the
captain were taken ashore in safety. The
old skipper, 60 years of age, in some way
lost bis bold and had to be drawn through
the raging surf hanging head downward,
suspended by one foot, which had become
entangled in the ropes.
Trie weather was bitter cold and every
man was drenched, some being entirely
nuae. A count of the crew showed that
the second mate and two men were miss- i
ing, but there are none to account for their ;
loss.
The landing was made at the bottom of
a cliff covcre'd with snow, and over the top |
of this was the only means of escape. A
Bailor finally succeeded in scaling it, and
then with a line to help them the others I
ascended. Here they found a telegraph
line, and one party started east while the
other went west in the hopes of reaching !
gome settlÂ«meut. No habitation was
reached and night came upon the stranded
mariners. The parties became separated !
and each man was left to care for himself. i
The westward crowd had not proceeded
far when they came to a river that it was
impossible to ford. They then retraced
their steps, during the trip coming upon
the body of their master and three men
who had succumbed to the extreme cold.
The bodies were found covered with snow,
and in that condition were left.
Arriving back at the vessel they found I
the sef. calm, and in a lifeboat which had
come ashore the survivors returned to the
vessel. They were pillaging the cabin of
the captain, when the mate returned. He
ordered the men to desist, and while at

erupting to enforce the command fell
thoneb a hatch and broke his loir. Then
the others rushed in and completed the
pillage, [laying no heed to the cries from
the injured man.
Provisions sufficient to sustain the party
three months were taken ashore, anJ
after twelve days of suffering in the ter
rible cold and drifting snows the tug Tyee
came into sight and brought some of the
survivors to this port, arriving here this
morning. The iirst mate and ten men, one
of whom had both feet frozen, are now in
j charge of British Vice-Consul Oscar
| Klocker. Five men were on the bluff at
i the time the rescue was made, the rising
storm forcing the vessel to leave them to
their fate.
Of the thirteen survivors now here, two
are in the Marine Hospital. Every one of
the other eleven shows the results of the
terrible exposure he suffered after bein Â»
obliged to desert the stranded Vessel dur
j ing the twelve days the survivors waited
for some one to rescue them.
The Cowan came from Cape Town,
South Africa, for Royal Roads, B. C, and
was 10S days out when she reached Cape
FJartery, on December 29. There was a
terrible stor.n off the cape, and the Cowan
stood off two days before trying to come
in. Then she was driven quickly to the
northward by a strong southwest wind,
and sought shelter in the treacherous
waters of Barcklay Sound to avoid being
driven ashore on some more exposed
point But the sound afforded little shel
ter with the prevailing wind and blinding
snowstorm then raging, and she was
driven almost directly on to the rocks at
high tide. This was at 2 o'clock in the
morning of December HI, and it was a raw,
cold night, with a snowstorm on.
The bark seemed to be breaking, and it
was decided to leave her at once. How to
get to the shore, eighty yards distant, was
a conundrum, but there was a hero equal
to this occasion, as there is in nearly every
such an emergency, and he stepped to the
front. This was seaman Chamberlain, a
brawny London boy, who volunteered to
swim to the shore and carry a line. His
words were greeted with cheers as he
quickly stripped naked, tied the lead lins
around bis neck and went over the side of
the vessel.
It was one of the most bitterly cold
nights any of the sailors had ever experi
enced, and none believed the brave man
would ever survive the trip through the
water, but he lost no time in jumping in
and striking for the shor^, dimly out
lined through the snow and darkness
ahead of him. With almost superhuman
efforts- he toiled on, and was all but suc
cessful, when the line became fast under a
rock behind him, and he was forced to
loosen it from his neck. He reached the
shore safely, and there was then nothing
to do but follow him with a lifeboat. This
was done by a small crew, which thus suc
cessfully carried the line ashore, by which
the others were sarely taken over, all being
; on shore before 6 o'clock.
During the day they found the vessel
still standing on her keel and they boarded
her, carrying off all the provisions and
stores possible, then having enough pro
visions to last fully two months. While
boarding the vessel when after these pro
visions the first mate, Charles Legall, fell
; and wrenched his leg badly, leaving him
helpless, and he was gotten ashore in the
evening of the same day. Second Officer
llowell and two apprentice boys, Steele
and Logan, were drowned while attempt
ing to return to the ship for some valu
ables left behind. All three were natives
of Scotland.
The next mornin g, under the direction
of Captain Thompson, the crew divided
into squads and began to tramp along the
beach and coast in different directions in
search of assistance or of an opportunity
to hail some passing vessel. Two days
spent at this accomplished nothing, ex
cept that it left Captain Thompson and a
colored sailor named Hunt in a bad con
| dition from exposure to the storm and
I cold, when they had returned to the spot
: where Legall had been left. Captain
i Thompson died forty-eight hours after
| coming ashore, and the men say he was
; given a Christian burial. He was a resi
dent of Liverpool, S3 years of age, and had
been on the Cowan three years as master.
Meantime the men had set to work and
constructed a shelter from sails saved from
the ship and prepared to ration out food,
if necessary, to make it last until rescue
came, the chief concern being for injured
men and those suffering most from the ex
j posure. Some of the able-bodied members
I of the crew had by this time discovered
; two huts from ranches a couple of miles
i further back from the coast, and it was
desired to accept the invitation of the in
habitants and make that their headquar
ters, but they found it impossible to move
Legall and Hunt. Then the crew divided,
eleven going and eleven remaining with
the two injured men, the former party
sending for some provisions nearly every
morning.
Yesterday morning it was very cold, and
the others did not come down to the tent
on the beach for supplies as usual. About
8 o'clock in the morning, after being on
chore twelve days, one of the sailors
tepped out of the tent and saw a steamer

MONOPOLY'S ENGINEER MUST HEED THE WARNING.
headed toward them. There was g r eat
excitement among the men, and in the
rush to prepare to greet the rescuer the
tent was in some manner set on lire and
totally destroyed. With it went most of
the provisions.
The steamer proved to be the tug Tyee
of the Puget Sound Tugboat Company's
fleet. By 10 o'clock all of the thirteen sea
men from the Cowan were on board.
After the thirteen from the tent were
safely on board the Tyee an effort was
made to get the others on board. They
were by this time on the beach signaling
with flaes for rescue and a lifeboat was
sent out for them, but the sea was running
too strong to make a landing, and with re
grets it was decided to come into this port
without them. They will be brought here
probably to-morrow on one of the com
pany's tutrs. 1 1 would have been necessary
for the Tyee to have remained till 10
o'clock at night to take the others on
board; hence it was decided to come here
with those on board and leave the others
to be brought another day.
Names of the members of the crew
brought here to-day are: Mate Legal] and
seamen Hunt, colored ; Moran, Irish;
Smyth, German; Olsen, Swede; Kerr,
Scotch; Cox, a native of Cape Town;
Chamberlain, London ; Cumberliss, Greece ;
Cousin, England; Heath, Russian; Ro
sario, Manilla; Carpenter, England; "Wil
son, Scotland.
The Cowan will be a total 10.-s. She is a
four-masted steel bark of 2500 tons, and
was built at Glasgow, Scotland, six years
ago. She was owned by the Shanklands.
She is still standing on her keel, but there
is no hope of saving her, as she is pinned
fast to the rocks. The Cowan was built by
J. E. Rus3ell at a cost of Â£26,000, and i 3
said to be insured for Â£30,000. At the pres
ent time, the crew now says, she is going
to piecesfast.
THOMPSON HAD BEEN DRINKING.
Survivors Attribute the Loss of the Janet
Cowan to Her Master's Stub
bornness.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 12.â
The story has leaked out to-night that
there was a serious disagreement during
the voyage of the British bark Janet
Cowan between Captain Thompson and
Mate Legalle, and if the words of the sur
vivors now here are to be accepted it is al
together probable the accident to the ves
sel should not have happened. Consider
able resentment toward Captain Thompson
was expressed more or less openly among
the crew when they first landed from the
vessel, but after his death it was agreed
that this feeling should be buried with
him. However, the story was given out
to-night by James Cox, a young man who
is the son of well-to-do parents at South
ampton and who came over on the Cowan
as a passenger. His statement that Cap
tain Thompson was drinking hard on the
voyage is corroborated by three members
of the crew.
Cox says, in addition, that the captain
was vindictive and obstinate and repeat
edly did, as nearly as possible, the opposite
of what the mate advised. This, he de
clares, was the cause of the loss of the ship,
for, when they were attempting to enter
the straits with a southwest wind behind
them, Thompson was advised by the mate
to stand in as close as possible to the
American shore, but, instead, he bluntly
told the mate he was master of the vessel
and knew what he was about. Cox says
this impressed him the more, because iie
knew that Mate Legalle had brought the
vessel here before, whereas it was Captair.

LORD SALISBURY
YIELDS A POINT.
Willing to Arbitrate the
Venezuelan Boundary
Dispute.
GREAT BRITAIN'S STAND.
The Decision of a European
Power Would Satisfy
All Interests.
DECLINES CRESPO'S TEEMS.
Findings of President Cleveland's Com
mission Will Be Submitted to
Impartial Judgment.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 12.â The Daily
Nerrs will to-niorro"- say that Lord Salis
bury has refused to agree to arbitration of
the Guiana boundary dispute on the terms
proposed by Venezuela, and has also de
clined to recognize the request of the
United States to trace a boundary; but if
the American commission define what, in
their opinion, the terms should be, and if
a European power will then act as arbi
trator, all interests would be satisfied.
In an editorial to-ruorrow the Standard
will say that the communications it pub
iiahea relative to the attitude to Germany
and the Transvaal and the publication of
the papers on the Venezuelan difficulty
are all authoritative. It adds:
''I'rged by friendly public opinion in the
United States to place before the world as
â  soon as may be the British case as regards
] the case with Venezuela, the Cabinet on
j Saturday decided to respond to this ami
! cable invitation by publishing the material
documents in its possession bearing
thereon. Of far more interest to the Eng
! lish people than the problems to be faced In
South Africa or the relations of this coun
try with any other power are its relations
with the United States, and we gladly take
the opportunity of bearing testimony to
the magnanimous attitude of the Ameri
cans toward us at a moment when a com
munity less generous thought apparently
that a favorable opportunity had arisen
for adopting toward us a tone of insult, if
uot of menace.
"Instead of taking advantage of the aug
mentation of our anxieties and the tem
porary multiplication of our events, the
American people, with a spirit that does
them honor and which is appreciated by
us, have not only abstained from endeav
oring to add to our perplexities, but where
tbey did not actually offer us their sym
pathy, they have maintained an honor
able, courteous reserve. This is conduct
worthy ol them, and it has not unnatur
ally inspired the English Government
with a desire to meet our kinsfolk across
the Atlantic in a friendly spirit.
"Lord Salisbury, as we announced be
fore, has decided not to wait for the meet
ing of Parliament, but will publish as
soon as they can be got ready all the docu
ments in his possession bearing upon the
disputed boundary between British Guiana
and Venezuela.
;< As we have said, the attitude of the
people of the United States during the
past week has materially influenced the
Prime Minister's decision, just as it has
quickened the feeling of friendship enter
tained by Englishmen for those who speak
their tongue and share their literature on
the other side of the ocean. The mainten
ance of friendly relations with the United
States must always be a consideration of
the first importance for Great Britain.
We say this to the American people, with
the absolute candor of deep-seated cor
diality."
The foregoing article is leaded through
out, and is evidently inspired by the Gov
ernment.
XORJHAX'S NEW AX,
Easy Method of Settling the Anglo-
American Ditputc.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 12.â Henry
Norman, the special commissioner of the
London Daily Chronicle, cabling to bis
paper before leaving Washington to-day,
says:
"There is a simpler solution of the
present difficulty and restoration of cordial
relations between P^ngland and America
than any I have yet suggested.
"Why should not Lord Salisbury attach
to the Bering Sea arbitration treaty, which
is about to be returned to the American
Governmet, a clause providing for the
arbitration of all pending questions, and
even of all future ones? Besides Venezuela
and Canada, there are the Alaska bound
ary, the Eastern fisheries and other ques
tions causing discord. If he does this, I
am able to state that the administration
will accept with pleasure the treaty so
altered.
"This is a method of accomplishing
everything with perfect honor and dignity
to both parties.
"Lord Salisbury would be wise to ter
minate the matter before Brazil demands
arbitration of her end of the Schomburg
line, thus adding a new and difficult com
plication."

KOREA'S QUEEN IS ALIVE
She Had Escaped Death When
the Attack Upon Her Castle
Was Made.
A Romance of the Seoul Court Which
Has Just Been Brought to
Publicity.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 12.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Shang
hai says: A romance equaling anything
which Rider Haggard ever wrote comes
irom Seoul, the capital of Korea, relating
to the conspiracy which broke out there
last November. The facts are known to a
few persons only, one being the King, and
all have the strongest motives for conceal
ment.
It will be remembered that on Novem
ber 28 an unsuccessful plot culminated in
an attack on the palace by a number of
Koreans belonging to the Queen's party.
The King and the Japanese, being warned
beforehand, posted extra guards and
foiled the conspirators, the object being to
seize the Ministers, expel the Japanese,
free the King from the latter's influence
and restore the Queen, who was reputed
to be dead, but who was in reality alive.
The Russian secretary of legation was
the leading spirit in the conspiracy and
was deputed to convey the Queen from her
place of hiding to the palace. The failure
of the attempt necessitated the keeping of
the secret of trie Queen being in existence,
which is now for the first time divulged.
When in October the Koreans and Ja
panese broke into the palace, the Queen,
scenting danger, had hastily, without
speaking to her women, retired in an ob
scure outhouse. She saw the bodies of her
ladies in waiting dragged to the pyre pre
pared for them outside, and watched the
completion of the tragedy from her hiding
place.
The Queen was concealed for an hour
and a half, every moment expecting dis
covery. She fled at last through a secret
passage to the old palace, and thence, after
changing her dress, made her escaDe out
side the walls of the city, where siie reached
a place of safety.
When the Japanese and Koreans exam
ined the charred bodies of the women who
had been burned, the Kin^ and some oth
ers shrewdly feigned that they had discov
ered the identity of the Queen in one of
the victims, lest a search should reveal her
whereabouts and lead to her murder. The
Japanese accepted the account ot the
Queen's death as true.
Three Koreans were strangled last week
as the Queen's murderers, while the trial
of Viscount Mura and other Japanese
officials is proceeding at Hiroshima for
the murder of a woman who still lives.
Li Han Spin, the leader of the lust abortive
plot, is in hiding here.
An American friend who came here on
the Russian cruiser Otvajny says that Rus
sia is using the supposed murder of the
Queen as a weapon against the Japanese,
although well knowing its falsity.

ITALY IS REASSURED.
Germany's Quarrel With Great Britain Not
Intended to Affect the Triple
Al/iar.ce.
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 12.â 1n view of
the fact that the future of Germany's rela
tions with England is involved in doubt,
Chancellor Prince yon Hohenlohe has sent
assuring communications to the Govern
ments at Vienna and Rome, pointing out
that any diplomatic action which mieht
be taken by the Berlin Government would
not involve either the triple alliance or
the individual interests of Austria or Italy.
It ia understood that the Chancellor's
communication expressed entirely pacific
intentions on the part of Germany
toward England, and also a belief that "a
good mutual understanding between Ger
many and Great Britain would be restored
at an early aay.
It is known that the Italian Govern
ment, fearing that the agreement with
Lord Salisbury for the co-operation of the
Italian and British squadrons in the event
of certain contingencies in the Mediter
rean nught be disturbed by a rupture be
tween England and Germany, has asked
certain explanations from Germany, and
it ia probable also that Austria has wanted
to know how the Emperor viewed Eng
land's warlike demonstrations.
In these chcumstances Prince Hohen
lohe, having nothing to conceal, could
reply frankly that the whole matter was a
question between Germany and England
alone, and it is not deemed possible that
the Chancellor could have given such
assurances while German diplomacy was
seeking to form a coalition of European
powers against England. The story of the
attempt to form a European coalition
originated in England, and ought now to
be knocked in the head.
Germany has not sought nor does she
seek any active allies in her endeavor to
check English encroachments in the
Transvaal endangering Germans and Ger
man investments there and in Delagoa
Bay. It is not a question that ought to
disturb the peace of Europe or to cause
any European power to intervene, except
those concerned in the recent Hinterland
conventions.
The Government nere has not sug
gested any European conference, but the
envoy of the Transvaal Republic, Dr.
Beerlaerts yon Blokland, while in Berlin,
spoke of such a conference as among pos
sible expedients.
The Boer Envoy has been in Paris con
sulting with the French Government in
regard to the situation In thÂ« Transvaal,
and if tne troubles there become more ag
gravated and England refuses the Boers a
just settlement, the result will be that the
Transvaal Government will make an ap
peal for a conference of the power? to dis
pose of the whole matter, but there is no
reason why Germany or France should
insist upon such a conference.
This is the semi-official view of the situ
ation, but it obviously omits from calcula
tion the results of England's rejecting the
offices of a conference, and also England's j
rejecting and declining to accept the view
taken by the Berlin Government that the
allied powers composing the Dreibund
could not be affected, or that diplomatic
hostilities could and should be limited to
fixed areas.
It is significant, too, to find Prince Bis
marck, who is no friend to English pre
tensions, warning the Berlin Government
through the Hamburger Nachrichten
against making external and internal
peace by the adoption of a policy of ad
venturous intervention. The Nachrichten
describes the task of the German Govern
ment as that of walking at a creat height
upon a tightrope.
The operations on the Bourse during the
past week show that considerable atten
tion has been directed to the excitement
prevailing in England with a view of tak
ing every advantage of it, and the conse
quence has been that orders have been
quietly made to buy on any marked de
i cline in London. The operations of the
week have also disclosed a strong reliance
j in Berlin and Frsnkfort financial circles
upon the maintenance of peace.
Imperial loans, Prussian consols and
some bank stocks have declined, but the
decline is not sufficiently heavy to indi
cate that there is any fear that tte country
is on the eve of v.ar.
The Vossische Zeitnng and the Lokal
Anzeiger are the only Berlin papers which
make any reference in their special London
dispatches to the London Telegraph story
of. an exchange of letters between Queen
Victoria and Emperor William in regard
to Germany's attitude in the Transvaal
disturbances. The story is generally dis- ,
credited.

CAUFORNIANS IN AFRICA.
Many of Them Are Drawing Down Princely
Salaries and Piling Up Big
Fortunes.
Up to a late hour last night Major R. P.
Hammond had received no further news
from Africa about the arrest of his brother
by order of President Kruger. Frederick
Hellmann, a civil engineer well known in
San Francisco and on the Comsiock, went
to South Africa last July. He was men
tioned in the press dispatches recently as
among the prominent Americans in Jo
hannesburg. Last Saturday he cabled the
following message to his father in this
City :
"Well. The rebellion quelled."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 1896
The news of the arrest of Hammond and
others will cause anxiety in many a home
in California. Most of the big mining men
in Africa are from this State.
The iirst place the English capitalists
turned to for miners when they needed
men to open their mines was naturally
California, where mining had been carried
on on a larger scale and with better ap
pliances than in any other part of the
world. Then, too, Hamilton Smith, who
was the mining engineer for the Koth
schilds, did much to bring California into
good repute. It is so now that big syndi
cates in London accept the reports of some
of the leading California engineers, such
as Louis Janin, A. J. Bowie, Ross Browne
and others, as bankers would paper with
the signatures of money kings.
There are under Hammond alone seven
teen California miners as superintendents
of mines, drawing salaries that aggregate
nearly a quarter of a million. Harry
Webb, Harry Dahin, Victor N. Clement
and Ed Garthwaite draw from $10,000 to
$25,000 a year. But then they have oppor
tunities to make money outside of that,
and word comes here every once in awhile
of their big strikes. Besides these, many
others have gone over to fill minor posi
tions, as assayers, foremen, timbermen
and millmen. In all they must be draw
ing in salaries nearly half a million dollars.
Barnato Brothers and the other big com
panies have been steadily drawing for
three years from this State the best min
ing talent.
Hamilton Smith, who was long in
I charge of the N irth Bloomfield, the largest
hydraulic mines in the State, drifted over
j to London about the time of the debris
j troubles and soon became consulting min
| ing engineer for the Rothschiicis. He has
: lately organized a big exploration syndi
i cate there and has made over a million.
| One of the men under him at North
| Bloom field was Perkins, who was about
i ten years ago in Venezuela in charge of
mines for a London company. He went
to Africa just after the boom started, and
has made a fortune outside of his princely
salary.
Gardiner Williams was one of the first
California miners to goto Africa. About
eighteen yerrs ago Baron Grant, who was
then pushing some big schemes that later
turned out fail urea and made him noto
rious, sent out here for a manatrer and
j assistants fora big eravel mining prop
: erty. His representative chose Gardiner
j Williams (offering him $18,000 a year) and
I about half a dozen hydraulic miners ami
; sent them on. At the same time a lot of
; hydraulic irachines was purchased and
forwarded, but when the C'alifornians got
j over Grant lad gone to smash. "Williams,
j however, so^n showed what he could do
I and it was not long before he was in
'â  charge of the De Beers diamond mines,
! the largest in the world, a position he still
'â â  nolds on a princely salary.
The report received yesterday that Henry
j Ashe Tilghman of this City had been ar-
I rested with Hammond and others caused
; much anxiety to the young man's friends
', in this City, as well as to the relatives of
â  his young bride, a daughter of Captain
\V. L. Merry, to whom he was united in
Johannesburg recently, and a number of
I messages were cabled to the Transvaal
: metropolis for further information and
asking whether any assistance could be
' rendered him.
"Etal" Tilghman, as he was generally
called, was well known in San Francisco
I and in Stockton, where he was born. Hir.
father was secretary of the State Board of
! Harbor Commissioners for several years
! previous to his death, and the young man
i was an only son. After his father's death
young Tiighman, who was then an un
usually bright young fellow, was sent to a
, celebrated military academy in Virginia,
j wiience he graduated irith honors. Later,
having shown an aptitude for engineering,
he was sent to Columbia College, and
graduated from the mining engineering
class of that inst ; tution.
Previous to returning to his home in
j California he obtained a position in the
] Mining Bureau at the World's Fair and
I was in charge of certain of the exhibits
there.
Younp Tilghman is a cousin of John IT.
; Hammond, and was invited to go to South
I Africa with ttie well-known engineer, the
â  latter believing that with his talent and
| education he would soon find an opening
in his profession.
After his return from the East Mr.
; Tilghman formed an attachment for Miss
i Alice Tenison Merry, daughter of Captain
Merry, and as his affection was recipro-
c ated an engagement soon followed.
Though both his mother and the family
i of his fiancee looked with favor on the
â . match it was deemed advisable, on ac
| count of the youth of the parties and the
j unsettled condition of Tilghman's busi
! ness prospects, to defer the marriage until
! he had established himself firmly in a po
| sition where he would be able to care for a
wife.
His engagement with Hammond when
he left San Francisco two years ago called
for a salary of $00 a month, but he had not
been long in South Africa before his thor
ough understanding of mining engineer
ing and assaying made him conspicuous
and he was offered a position with 3ar
nato Bros., the Kaffir kings, at a hand
some salary. He accepted and from that
on his advance was rapid. A few months
ago his salary was raised to $1000 per
i month and he decided that it was time he
should be united to Miss Merry.
As he could not well leave bis business
she consented to accompany his mother,
who was going to join her son, and be mar
ried lar from home. Mrs. Tilghman and
Miss Merry were accompanied to New
York by several members of the pros
pective bride's family, who bade them
good-by when they took the steamer for
Liverpool.
Mrs. Tiljrliman and Miss Merry arrived
in .Tohannesb urg in the latter part of No
vember last and the young couple were
married on December 3.
The letter announcing the marriage was
the last word received by the mother of
the bride from her daughter, and every
effort is being made to confirm or disprove
the alarming news of Tilghman's arrest.
The relatives and friends of the newly
married couple are inclined to believe that
there is some mistake in the report of
Tilghman's arrest, or that if he has been
taken into custody it was through some
misunderstanding, and that he will speed
ily be released.
They point to the fact that he was not in
ex- Premier Cecil Rhodes' employ, that he
is but '16 years of age, and that he would
hardly have engaged in plots against the
Government with the bride of a month
and his mother to occupy his care and at
tention.

A FEUD OF ROYALTY
German Society Agog Over
the Quarrel at
Court.
KAISER AGAINST PRINCE
Frederick Leopold Is Smarting
Under the Treatment of
William.
CAUSE OF HIS IMPEISONMENT.
It Is Charged That His Cruelty Caused
the Princess to Attempt
Suicide.
BERLIN, Geemant, Jan. 12. â The
quarrel between the Kaiser and Prince
Frederick Leopold of Prussia, husband of
the Empress' sister, over the Prince's harsh
treatment of his wife after her recent acci
dent in breaking through the ice while
skating near Glenicke Castle, Potsdam, is
still the absorbing topic of discussion in
society.
The Prince's period of nrrest and con
finement in a room in the castle is over,
but the feud between him and tke Empe
ror is not terminated by any means.
Prince Frederick Leopold has not yet re
sumed his military service, and it is now
recalled how the Emperor publicly re
buked him for mistakes be made in the
military maneuvers around Bornstedt.
The origin of the present row between
the two dates back to the time when the
Princess, who was on the eve of accouche
ment, attended a state ball, and danced
throughout the function. The Empress,
the Princess' sister, protested, and got
snubbed for her pain?. Tne Emperor then
told the Princess' lady in waiting that the
Princess ought not to dance and bade her
tell her mistress what he had said. This
resulted in a coolness between the sisters,
the Princess avoiding the Empress when
ever she could.
When the Princess broke through the
ice while skating on Glenicke Lake, and
came near drowning, the Empress called
at Glenicke Castle to inquire as to her con
dition, and the Princess refused to receive
her. The Empress nevertheless remained
at the castle and sent for the Emperor.
The Emperor on receiving the summons
at once rode from the New Palace to Glen
icke Castle, and a furious quarrel ensued
between the Kaiser and the Prince, who
fiercely resented the Emperor's interfer
ence in his private family affairs. During
the period of the Prince's confinement in
the fortress of the castle, which lasted two
weeks, guards with loaded rifles were
piaced before every entrance to the castle
and all lights were ordered extinguished
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Socialistic malice has seized the occa
sion to circulate the very worst rumors
concerniiiL' the quarrel. The Vorwaerts,
the principal Socialist, organ, is the most
conspicuous offender in this respect, and
reproduces the report that the Princess,
when she was rescued from the icy waters
in the lake, had no skates, nor did her
companion, the Baroness Colmar, her lady
in waiting, have any.
The only inference to be drawn from
this fact, the Vorwaerts declare?, is that
the breaking through the ice was not an
accident, but a deli Derate attempt on the
part of the Princess to commit suicide, be
cause of the brutal treatment to which she
was constantly subjected by her husband.
It is understood that Prince Frederick
Leopold will resign from the army and
henceforth live in privacy.

Poultney Bigelow left Berlin on Friday
on his return to New York. His mission,
which was to obtain the readmission of the

nut receive him The Berlin papers say he
spoiled his relations with the Kaiser by
mixing up a commercial enterprise with
the imperial name.
The great court reception which was to
have taken place this week lias been post
poned until January 29, and the court ball,
which was to have occurred on January
22, has been abandoned owing to the death
of Prince Alexander and the consequent
period of court mourning.

telegraphing under date of yesterday, says
that more complete tables of the persons
killed and property destroyed in the prov
inces of Harpoot and DiarbeKir show that
176 towns and villages, containing 8050
Armenian houses, were burned. The Ar

killed. This excludes the uncertain re
ports of killings.
M. Cambon, the French Embassador,
estimates the total number of Armenians
killed in Anatolia at 50,000.
It is stated that the French Government,

FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 12.â A new
feature is added to the Senatorial muddle
to-night by the failure of Speaker Blanford
to promulgate his writ for a special elec
tion to lill the vacancy caused by the
death of Representative Wilson, of Nelson
County, which occurred Friday. It was
stated positively last night that he had
made out his proclamation calling an elec
tion January 21, but the Speaker said to
night he had not had time to examine the
law and did not know when he would have
it held.
â¢ # The Democrats of course express great
indignation, as Mr. Wilson's successor
cannot be named in time to vote for
Senator unless the writ is promulgated to
morrow. As the election of a Senator
hinges on this vote, much interest is being
taken in it. Nelson County has a normal
Democratic majority of over 800, so the
Republicans will make no special effort to
elect his successor.

lOWA?S LEOISZiA-TURE.
Code lierision the Most Important Mat
ter to Come Up,
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 12-â The two
houses of the Legislature meet to-morrow
morning to perfect their organizations,
and will then adjourn till Tuesday, when
Senator Allison will be re-elected. This
evening the leading members of both
houses met and discussed informally the
question of how to handle the code revi
sion. The result was an agreement which
will be formulated into resolutions to
morrow morning for a joint conference of
members of both houses at the capitol to
morrow evening to discuss the matter.
The code revision is the most important
matter that will come before the session,
and there are two plans for handling it.
One is to have each house name a large
committee, to which the entire code shall
be referred, to be distributed among sub
committees for careful consideration; re
ported back to the general committee and
from this to the House. The other is to
have the code referred by titles to the ap
propriate standing committees and let
these make the investigation, reporting
directly back to the House. Each plan
has strong advocates and the discussion
will be an important one.

Four Cities Racing to Secure the Oemo~
crntic Gathering.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 12.âWash
ington is airain tilling up with convention
boomers. Four cities are actively at work â
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati and New
\ork. The contest seems to be between
the latter cities.
The interview with Colonel Dick Bright
in TheCai.l, republished in Washington,
has made the Chicago people very wrathy
toward him. and they may try to defeat
i-ulonel Bright for sergeant-at-arms of the
convention. Mr. Bright is not a candi
date, however, and will make no fight for
it, and will only accept if it is tendered to
him.
Opinion is about evenly divided as to
whether Cincinnati or New York will win.
Many Dptnucratic leaders, including Har
rity, Whitney and Lamont, favor New
York, but the Westerners are strongly
opposed to the metropolis and will vote
for Cincinnati and some of them for St.
Louis.
The only exceptions among the Western
er- who have arrived is Colonel Merritt <.f
I'tah, who will cast a complimentary vote
for San Francisco and then support New
York, and Colonel William It. Morrison of
Illinois who is also understood to favor
New York if Chicago can't win. Secretary
Sheerin is understood to be for Cincinnati.
The committee will meet on Thursday.
SILVER MEN STAND FIRM.
The Free-Coinage Substitute for
the Bond Bill Will Pass
the Senate.
Both Factions Disposed to Bring the
Question to a Vote Without
Delay.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 12.â The de
bate in the Senate this week will be very
much like the debate during the extra ses
sion, when Congress was convened for tie
purpose of repealing the purchasing clau.-Â«
of the Sherman act. The silver substitute
to the House bond bill is now the unfin
ished business, and will be called up any
day at the conclusion of the morning hour.
No one has Â«?iven notice of the intention to
speak during the week, but the subject is
fruitful in debate and a number of speeches
will be delivered.
There appears, however, to be a disposi
tion on the part of both silver and anti
silver men to permit tlie question to come
to a vote without delay, some of the anti
silver people believing it would be the best
thing to let the country know, at the
earliest opportunity, what element it ia
that controls the Senate. It is believe I
the free-coinage substitute will pass by at
least half a dozen votes.
The Finance Committee meets in regu
lar session again Tuesday, and the Repub
lican members, counting on the vote of
Jones of Nevada, confidently expect
at that time to report the tariff "bill as it
came from the House, in accordance with
the sentiment of the Republican caucus
last week.
The House will probably continue to
morrow the consideration of the rule re
garding the counting of a quorum, which
alone remains to be acted upon. That can
be disposed of at one session, it is believed,
but whenever it is out of the way the pen
sion appropriation bill will be called up.
This is the only matter now in sight to en
gage the attention of the House this week,
and tney may occupy the entire time. A
number of members it is understood, are
anxious to make speeches on the pension
question, and, as there is nothing else on
tne docket as yet, their longings are likely
to be satisfied.
Whenever the Senate shall return the
revenue or bond bill with amendment its
consideration will at once supersede all
other business but neither one is expected
to reach the House this week. There may
be a diversion by the presentation of a
reply by the Secretary of State to any one
of the four or five resolutions of inquiry
which the House passed week before last,
but no intimation has been triven, so far as
known, that any of the replies will I*
transmitted by the President t^is week.

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 12. â Lyman
Trumbull of this city, who prior to 1855
was successively Representative in Con
gress and Justice of the State Supreme
â¢. and for the three terms beginning j
that year and ending in 1373 represented
Illinois in the Senate of the United States,
may be the standard-bearer of the Popu- â 
list party in the approaching Presidential
campaign. While no official overtures to |
that end have yet been made to him. it is
understood that his availability will be
canvassed at the meeting of the National
Committee of the party, which is to be
held at St. Louis on Friday next to decide j
on tne time and place for holding the '
National Convention, and that quite a
number of members of the committee,
representing States in which the Popu
lists have material strength, will be favor- !
ably disposed toward Judge Trumbull's j
candidacy. The only other man who is
likely to be talked of is United States
Senator Marion Butler of North Carolina.
One of his Populist associates of that body,
however, (Senator W. V. Allen of Ne
braska), is regarded in the light of a dark I
horse, and may be broueht prominently to
the front should declinations or other cir- !
tend to place Judge Trumbull
or Senator Butler outside the pale of con
it ion. Beyond the three gentlemen
in question, no other name has been
mcd as the nominee of the party
for President.
A National committee man from afar
Western State, who was in this city for a
brief time this morning, said that it was
eminently desirable that at its meeting
next week the National Committee should
look over the field 3nd discuss the outlook
for Presidential timber,
"We don't propose," he said, "to be
again placed in the dilemma that is a part
of the history of the Omaha convention of
1892. As will be remembered, so certain
were our leaders that Judge Gresham would j
accept the nomination, that no other j
name was given consideration, and up to I
the opening of the convention it was re
garded as certain that the committee we
had laboring with him away down in
Indiana, where he had gone to attend the
funeral of a relative, would succeed in ob- j
taining his consent of the presentation of i
his name. It can be stated now, and I '
think for the first time, that the immedi- I
ate members of Judge Gresham's family
were strongly in favor of his placing him- i
self in our hands, and that so far as he
himself was concerned his objections were
more personal than political.
"It will be remembered, moreover, that
on that memorable Fourth of July we con
vened and adjourned, reconvened and
again adjourned, talked and sang to kill
time and did not give up until the final
and authenticated refusal from Judge
Gresham was wired into the convention
hall. Then we were in a quandary. Time
was getting short, somebody had to be
nominated and the choice fell upon Gen
eral Weaver. I have nothing to say
against the old greenback warrior of lowa,
but the fact is new recognized in the party
that he was not the strongest man who
might have been nominated had there
been more time for deliberation, and that
ha<J we not made the mistake of pinning
our faith exclusively upon Judge Gres
hani's acceptance we might have had an
other standard-bearer under whose leader
ship our campaign would have been more
potent of results.
"This time we propose to look ahead
and to know just where we stand without
waiting until the convention is actually
in session. Out my way there is a strong
feeling favorable to Judge Trumbull ou
account of the stand he has taken of later
years against the growth of centralizing
tendencies in a National Government and
the gradual concentration of capital in the
hands of a few to the injury of the
masses. I believe that either Judge
Trumbull or Senator Butler of North
Carolina would be highly acceptable not
only to the Populists but to the silver and
reform elements, and with the name of
one or the other at the masthead we
might kindle a wave of enthusiasm that
would sweep over the country."
The first intimation that his name was
being seriously spoken of in connection
with the first place on the Populist ticket
was conveyed to Judge TrunÂ«bu!l this
evening by a representative of the United
Press. Despite the fact that he has
rounded his 82d year, the venerable ex
stutesman is as bright mentally and as
active physically as the average business
irian of 50, while his .speech is as clear and
ii.s manner as earnest, and vigorous as in
the daj i when on the floor of the United
Senate he enunciated the doctrine
which he afterward wrote as the thirteenth
amendment to the constitution, that
â r slavery nor involuntary servi
ihall exist in the United States."
To t!iC- intimation he quickly returned
; â¢}â â  -Minn that he had long since been
out of politics, and that, moreover, his
advanced age should preclude the pos
of his being called again into har-
To the suggestion, however, that,
physically, at least, be was in better shape
than was Mr. Blame in the campaign of
1884, or Mr. Thurman in the campaign of
c did not interpose a negative, and,
while avoiding any absolute expression of
opinion one way or the other, his manner
left the inference that, were he approached
with the sanction of the National Cnm
roiebt be persuaded to place
â  H in the hands of the convention.
In the course of the conversation. Judge
Trumbull said that the suggestion of his
probably prew out of the fact that a
fter a conference of the reform
elements at 8L Louis, lie was waited upon
by a committee which sought his advice
regarding the leading questions of the day
upon which a union of all reform elements
might be effected. By request, he drew up
a brief platform, containing, so far as he
remembers, but four planks. A search of
his desk, however, failed to bring to light
a duplicate of the document. Its Bpecific
or general terms he could not, on the
moment, remember.
Judge Trumbull's last public appear
ance, outside of his argument last year be
fore the United States Supreme Court on
the appeal of the officers of the American
Railway Union against the sentence for
contempt of court imposed by Judge
Woods, was at a great Populist meeting
held in this city on October 6, 1894, when
he spoke at some length upon the causes
leading to discontent among the masses,
emphasizing the fact that "deliverance
from the oppression of privileged monopo
lies and millionaires could be had only
through the ballot." He dilated upon the
encroachment of Federal courts upon the
constitutional rights of the people, and de
clared himself in favor of the rehabilita
tion of silver. This speech, which in
pamphlet form has obtained a circulation
of several million copies, is regarded as a
textbook among the various elements that
goto make up the Populist organization.

The Xorth Carolinian Lacka ThreÂ« Years
of tlir Constitutional Age.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 12.â Senator
Butler of North Carolina, when seen to
night by a United Press reporter, said that
so far as he was concerned, there was
nothing in the story about his being a
candidate on the Populist Presidential
ticket for second place.
"I will not," said he, "for almost three
3-ears reach the constitutional age that
would permit me to take the office were I
to receive the nomination and be elected.
Besides I am not and would not be a can

our party, and if he permits his name to
be used in the convention he will have a
good following.

LAST CRUISE OF
THE JANET COWAN.
Continued from First Page.
sailing vessels were sighted ahead coming
in and the mate advised the captain to
tack ship to the southward and follow the
schooner just ahead of Him. He says the
captain obstinately refused to do so, but
kept close to the Vancouver shore.
Mate Legalle was aroused at the hospi
tal to-night and asked to corroborate the
above, but would say only that he could
have brought the vessel in safely had he
been in charge. He regretted that the
story about Captain Thompson drinting
had got out, but refused to deny it.
Captain Gove of the tug Tyee, which
brought the sailors here, says the vessel
was surely not well handled, even though
it was in a terrible storm. However, he
says there is some extenuation in ttie fact
that the Cowan was very light. Her ton
nage was over 2500 and she had less than
1100 tons ballast. She was consequently
so light that she would not answer her
helm, otherwise she could have been safely
brought about even after the rocks were
siglited ahead on the night she went
ashore. Gove says her position could net
nave been better selected, and that if she
had struck thirty yards on either side of
her present position it would have been
impossible for the crew to have reached
the shore before the vessel was smashed to
pieces.
Mate Legalle still insists that there are
| eleven men behind, but it seems his con
! dition was such that the others did not
; tell him of the death of the last two, cook
and donkeyman. So there are now eight
remaining behind as follows: T. Dugan,
J. Hanley, J. Marshall, F. Chamberlain,
and C. Campshell, able seamen; R. Her
rie and W. Walker, ordinary seamen, and
J. Taylor, steward. The tug Pioneer has
been sent to their rescue, and will arrive
here with them Tuesday morning.
The survivors here are being cared for
by British Consul Klocker, and the man
agers of the local Seamen's Bethel.
Six of them were seen at the latter place
this evening, and practically corroborated
all that had been said by Cox regarding
the drinking of Captain Thompson and
his disagreement with Mate Legalle. They
said the ship was too light for such a voy
age, and that she was tossed about like a
cork off the Cape. Several sailing vessels
were sighted by them while on shore, and
although every effort was made to hail
them none were successful. They saved a
foghorn from the Cowan and kept it going
almost continually, but without avail.
When the tent caught tire yesterday
morning Mate Legalle urged the others to
leave him to die and look out for them
selves, but they rigged up a stretcher and
got him safely down over the bluff to the
beach, when the tug coming to their res
cue was sighted. The men on shore
hugged each other for joy at sight of her,
and were soon on board.
Cox, the passenger, pives a vivid de
scription of the landing from the vessel on
the night of the disaster. Chamberlain,
the man who had tried to take the lead
line ashore, was given up for lost, and the
boat that was sent out an hour later with
four men capsized in the surf and there
was a wild scramble for life.
They then rigged out a boatswain's chair
line from the mizzenmast to the shore.
It was a pretty steep grade, and as each
man shot down the line he was told to
hold on fast. Cox says that when his turn
came â the third man from the last â he
clenched his teeth and slid down. When
near the shore the huge breakers were con
tinually washing the line and it seemed an
age while passing through them, and it re
quired the muscle of an athlete to hold on
to the line. Cox tells a pathetic story
about Lot;an, the 13-year-old apprentice,
who was very much excited and in piteous
tones begged fora life-preserver. Cox gave
him one. fastened it around his waist and
Loga;> then disappeared aft, never being
seen afterward.
Carpenter Peterson and four intelligent
seamen alleged to-day in the presence of
British Consul Klocker and a Call corre
spondent that the loss of the vessel
was due to the intemperance of the mas
ter, the inexperience of the second mate, j
who was scarcely 20 years old, and the
lack of a ship's full complement of able
seamen. Instead of there being twenty
four seamen, as tbe law requires of a ves
sel of that size, there were only sixteen for |
the two watches.
"It was a terrible experience through
which we passed," said Carpenter Peter
son to a Call correspondent, "and to
night I can almost see and hear the piteous
moans of our abandoned comrades.
"Their cries were lieartrending, and
liad we not thought our own lives in the
greatest danger we would have made extra
efforts to get Peveral ami Selkirk back to
tne ship. Some of us were barefooted
and we were helping and partly carrying

some of the weaker ones. At every step
some of the boys left blood upon the
frozen ground.
"Captain Thompson seemed dazed from
the time he passed through the ragged
surf and reached the shore. That night,
while the steward was caring for him, he
died in a bank of snow and the next day
in going down a trail one of our men fell
over his corpse.
"Further down the road Perval and Sel
kirk lost their reason and were laughing,
crying and chattering like magpies. Face
down over a log, frozen stiff, lay the corpse
of George Kinnear, the cook. The snow
fell continuously for forty-eight hours,
and clad lightly, as we were, it is the
greatest wonder that we did not all perish."
On board ship he said the men gutted
the cabins and broke into the storeroom.
When the first officer fell down in the laz
arette they refused him assistance, and
had it not been for the timely arrival of
the carpenter he thinks they would have
abandoned him to his fate.

tTaa a Seaman of Exceptional Ability and
a Cautious Xariyator.
The Janet Cowan is a four-masted vessel, '
bark rigged on the jigger or aftermost I
mast. She was built by R. Steele at
Greenock in 1866 and was entered at Swan
sea. Her length is 214 feet, beam 35.4 feet,
depth 22.5 feet and has a registered ton
nage of 2498. She belongs to the "burn"
line of vessels, of which are the Otterburn,
Routenburn, and the Celticburn, now on i
her way to this port from Newcastle, New
South Wales.
Captain Thompson, who perished from
exposure after leaving his ship, is a native \
of the Shetland Islands, and was about 45 j
years of age. He had a wife and family in i
England. He entered the employ of the
company that owned the Janet Cowan at
an early age, and passed upward through !
all the grades of an officer until he was ;
promoted to the rank of master.
By those who are intimately acquainted ;
with him he is described as having been i
au exceedingly careful and cautious Scotch !
skipper, and a seaman who had no superi- |
ors in the profession.
"I knew Thompson well," said Alexan- i
der McÃoyle, the druggist at the corner of i
Washington and Sansome streets, "and j
knowing his abilities as a commander, his '
discretion as a navigator, I cannot account \
for the loss of the Janet Cowan. I believe \
that the disaster was the result of a combi
nation of circumstances over which no spa
man, however able, has any control. Cap- I
tain Thompson would never lose a ship if
human skill could save her."
The Janet Cowan was in this port in
1893 ;md sailed for England during October
of that year. Thompson was in command
of her then and had been for a number of
years. Like many who have been lost at
sea he was intending to resign his com
mand and remain at home after this trip,
which has proved to be indeed his final
voyage.

PORTLAND, 0r.., Jan 12.â Shipping
men have grave fears for the safety of the
British bark Lorton, which is now out
over sixty days from Mazatlan, Mexico,

INSURGENT VICTORIES.
Regulars Defeated in Several Desperate
Engagements â Crime of a Spanish
Leader.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba, Jan. 4
; (via Key West, Jan. 11).â On the 26th ult.
the guerrillas of Colonel Tejeda and the
battalion, constituting 1200 men in all, had
a bloody engagement with the rebel leaders,
'' Brigadier Cebreco and Colonel Pancno
Sanches, with 500 men, in Loma de los
Ciegos and in San Prudencio.
The Spanish troops commenced the at
tack with Mich a hurried and continuous
tiring from different directions that the
insureents abandoned the first-mentioned
place and took positions in San Prudencio,
after inflicting some losses to the troops.
Colonel Tejeila, after giving some rest to
the soldier?, again attacked the rebels in
i their new positions. A terrible right en
sued, but when the Spaniards arrived about
j half way up the mountain they began to
j show signs of weakening in consequence
lof the constant and deadly lire of the
rebels.
Colonel Tejeda then ordered an attack
\ with bayonets, and the Insurgents, seeing
: that, suddenly attacked the guerrillas with
machetes. The latter disbanded and in
running disorganized and scattered the
battalion, leaving them alone in the field.
Colonel Tejeda, being unable to rally the
i dispersed guerrillas, had to retire with his
wounded.
In this engagement the Spanish had Dr.
Gomez, four officers and fifteen soldiers
killed, and Commander Ponet, seven offi
cers and forty soldiers wounded. The
! rebels had six killed and tifteen woundf.-d.
The insurgents captured several horses,
three mules laden with ammunition, many
weapons and a large box of medicines.
Another encounter has taken place
lately in La Tontina, between Spanish
Colonel Sandoval and Cuban leaders Ruen
and Dominguez. After a short but hard
fight Dominguez defeated the Spanish
column. The troops had nine killed and
thirty wounded. The rebels captured ten
mules laden with ammunition and medi
cines.
A horrible crime was committed near
Manzanillo on December 24 by Spanish
guerrillas commanded by Colonel Benitz, a
bandit whom Martinez Campos took out
from the prison where he was serving a
term for crime and raised to the rank of
colonel of the Spanish army. Lolo Benitz
is a Cuban by birth. On the evening of
the 24th he went from Manzanillo with sixty
guerrillas with the object of inspecting the
surroundings of the city. In the middle
of the night they arrived at a country seat
called San Francisco, where there were
about twenty-rive persons celebrating
Christmas eve, the maiority of them
women and children. The guerrillas went
to the front of the house, fired a volley at
it and then entered, machetes in hand,
killing an old man, the owner of the place,
two other men, two women and two
children and wounding four men, three
women and four children. Lolo Benitz
took three men with him to Manzanillo as
prisoners, saying that he had dispersed a
party of rebels.
On December 24 a Spanish column 500
strong, under Colonel Ochoa, left Mayari
to carry a convoy of ammunition to a de
tachment of troops stationed at La Juli
ana. On their way they were met by the
rebel leader, Matias Vega, with 900 men.
The insurgents attacked the convoy and
captured forty mules laden with provis
ions and ten with ammunition. The
troops retreated to Mayari, having eight
killed and thirty-seven wounded. The
Cubans also captured eight prisoners.
On December 28 the Spanish columns of
Colonels Kodons and Pablos, with 1100
men, left Tignani by different roads with
the object of meeting in Manacahueca and
continuing together to the Venta dcs Casa
nova to fortify it and to Dlace there a gar
rison. The insurgents under Colonel
Lora and the forces of the brigade of Cam
bute, who had learned of the plan of the
Spaniards, took up positions in Manaca
hueca ahead of the troops.
Rebel commander Abad Reyes with 100
infantry and twenty cavalry began to tire
at Rodons' column, which trusting m
Colonel Pablo's arrival, entered the trap
which the rebels had prepared for them.
They were fired upon from all sides, and
afterwards a terrible charge was made
with machetes, which scattered the troops.
The forces of the Spanish Colonel Pablos
arrived too late to be of service. More than
100 Mansur rifles and twenty mules, laden
with ammunition, were left in the hands
of the rebels. The Spaniards had three
officers and thirty-nine soldiers killed and
five officers and nine soldiers wounded.
Lieutenant-General Pando has issued an
order threatening to court-martial all
owners of sugar estates if they do not
grind the cane on their plantations. Of
course, some planters, fearing that Pando
would carry out his threat, tried to com
ply with the order, but the very day the
order was published in Guanatanamo
newspapers, all the canenelds of those who
were grinding were set on lire and they
had to atop.
Jose Maceo and Rabi have notified the
planters that if they attempt to grind
ag-ain not only the cane will be burned but
their houses and machinery, too. General
Pando has particular interests in Guana
tananio, because his wife, who lived in
that city, has a sugar estate there.
Marshal Martinez Campos sent an order
by cable last night to the authorities here
to send him immediately 1500 men for
Bantanabo. It is said sa many men can
not be spared, as there are numerous rebels
around the city, awaiting a cnance to pay
a visit to Santiago.
The arrest of persons on suspicion con
tinues in all this district. Some are taken
in the middle of the nightand shot ; others
are sent to Africa. A detachment com
posed of a sergeant and twenty-rive soldiers,
who were on duty in the suburbs of the
city, joined the rebels last night with their
arms and ammunition.

A Putative Correspondent of the -Yete York
Journal in Trouble.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 12.â Charles A.
Soloman, who claimed he was a corre
spondent of the Journal of New York, wa3
arrested here to-day on the arrival of the
steamer Seneca, on which he had traveled
from New York. The authorities Lad
been noti tied of his departure, and of the
fact that he was suspected of being in
league with the insurgents. It is sup
posed that compromising letters were
found in his possession. He was lodged
in jail, and the officials refuse to allow
an}- one to have communication with him.
Antonio Maceo, the rebel leader, and his
command are reported to be in the vicinity
of Quivican and San Felipe, moving east.
NEW YORK, N. Y\, Jan. 12.â Charles
A. Salomon, who was arrested in Havana
upon his arrival there, is a young journal
ist well known among newspaper men in
this city. Ever since he became engaged
in newspaper work he has made a specialty
of South American news, and if>, perhaps,
better known at the Consulates of South
American countries in this city than any
other writer. He was a daily caller at the
Cuban Junta and also at the Spanish Con
sulate, showing no favor to either side.
Salomon decided last week to go to Cuba
to look over the places he had written
about, and sailed for Havana on the
Seneca last Wednesday afternoon. It is a
well-known fact that all persons, reporters
especially, who visit the Cuban Junta in
this city are watched regularly by detec
tives, and that their movements are re
ported to the Spanish authorities. The
young man's regularity in going there
after news has no doubt led to his being
suspected as a sympathizer with the Cuban
cause and his arrest.
FAST TRAINS TAKEN OFF
Santa Fe Limited Between Chi
cago and Los Angeles to
Be Abandoned.
Retrenchment the Order of the Day
With the New Management of
the Road.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 12.â Retrenchment
is the order of the day with the new man
agement of the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Company, and the first
step in this direction will be the abandon
ment of the fast limited express train be
tween Chicago and Los Angeles.'
This train was put on about three months
ago as an experiment. The time made
between Chicago and Los Angeles was
only three days, and the equipment of the
train was equal to that of the famous lim
ited trains between Chicago and New York.
It is claimed at the rate the company
has been losing money on its fast limited
express its loss at the end of a year would
have been over $-.200,000.
President Ripley informed the general
managers of the Chicagoand Missouri River
lines at a meeting held Friday afternoon
of ti:e intention of his company to take off
the California limited, and the announce
ment was received with much satisfaction.
The managers of all the Chicaeo and Kan
sas City lines are opposed to running extra
fast trains, especially during the winter,
on account of the increased danger and the
extra expense.

FEARFUL MAELSTROM
Volcanic Opening in the
Bottom of Lake Cha
pala, Mexico.
IN A TERRIBLE VORTEX
Those on Shore Were Powerless
to Aid and Stood
Aghast.
WATCHED THE BOATS GO DOWN.
Between Twenty and Thirty Lives
Were Lost in the Fathomless
and Unknown Depths.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 12.â Particulars
were received to-day of a terrible con
vulsion of nature at Lake Chapala, in the
State of Jalisco, Mexico, which occurred
last Wednesday.
It is an isolated place and has no tele
graphic communication. The lake is
about fifty miles long and ten wide,
and on the morning of the Bth instant
was subjected to some volcanic disturbance
which evidently made an immense cavity
in its bottom, as the waters of the Jake re
ceded several feet and created a whirlpool
in gonig down through the hole, which
sucked down several small vessels and
drowned about twenty people.
The region is peculiarly subject to sub
terranean disturbances, being not far from
the volcanoes of Colima and Jorullo,
which are in eruption almostconstantly.
On the forenoon of the Bth residents in
one of the small settlements near the
western end of the lake were terrified to
see a gigantic whirlpool raging far out on
the water, the cause of which was a com
plete mystery.
The waters swirled and rose in
serpentine movements and from all direc
tions rushed toward a common center,
where a stupendous cavity seemed to
exist.
The weather was clear and calm at the
time and the horritied people on shore
could hear a cavernous rumbling far out
in the lake and beneath their feet in the
bowels of the earth.
The mitrhty action of the waters of the
lake was exactly such as would be pro
duced in miniature by the pouring of
water into a funnel. The whirlpool result
ing from this sinking of the lake's bottom
was of wide extent, and pleasure-boats and
fishing craft were sucked into the awful
aby^s.
The natives on shore could plainly see
the boats, none of wiich were near the
center of the whirlpool at first. But as
the rush of waters continued the irresist
ible force could not be overcome by the
men in the boats, and their herculean
efforts to escape the death that reached
out for them were most appalling to their
friends on the shore.
Now and then some boat would appear
to waver and stand still, but the Niagara
| of waters would swell upon it and hurl it
j quickly into the chasm.
There was not one boat within reach of
' that current that escaped, and the score
of persons in the boais all lost their lives.
The whirlpool continued for nearly
twenty minutes, and when the inhabitants
of the surrounding territory turned their
eyes from the overwhelming sight they
saw that the lake had receded several feet
from its former shore line.
As the lake is about fifty miles in length,
with a width of ten miles, the enormous
amount of water that was swallowed up j
by the earth may be faintly imagined.
After the whirlpool subsided the surface 'â 
of the Jake resumed its placid aspect and
the subterranean rumblings ceased.
The greatest excitement arose among '
people for miles in the vicinity of the west
ern end of the lake, the more ienorantand '
superstitious natives being beside them- !
selves with fear. Years of familiarity with \
volcanic eruptions and terrestrial disturb
ancea did not serve to reassure them dur- !
ing this dreadful experience.
The news was received by Professor Ed
win H. Coffey, who formerly lived near
Lake Chapala. He is well acquainted i
with its surroundings, having explored j
much of its coast line in the year ISSB. At 1
that time he found petroleum and coal in I
quantities that proved the existence of i
vast wealth in that region.
Since the strange occurrence on the lake ]
last Wednesday petroleum has been j
found running in small streams above the
surface on the southern shore.
The Lerma River empties into Lake
Chapala on the western side and flows out ;
in a west-northwesterly direction under !
the name of the Coloton River.

Sheriffs of Tico Counties Want PostctsioH
Â«Â»/â  riicjn.
SANTA KOSA.CaI., Jan. 12.â The Sher
iffs of Sonoma and Marin counties are
having a squabble over Norton and Mo
ralis, the two men jailed in Petaluma Fri
day for robbing various stores in the two
counties during the past few months.
Moralis is a half-breed Chilean and
Indian. Norton is an American.
Sheriff Bam 1. Allen of this county went
to Petaluma Saturday to bring the prison
ers to Santa Kosa on the charge of robbing
the Trenton postottice.
He received a warrant from Justice
Scudderof Petaluma, but Marshal Collins,
the arresting officer, refused to surrender
the men, claiming he made the arrest un
der instructions from Sheriff Harrison of
Marin County. Collins now says "he will
turnthe men over to a United States Mar
shal.
There is a standing reward from the
postal authorities of $300 each for men ar
rested for robbing postoflices, and the
many oflicers involved in the pursuit and
linal capture are all mating efforts to se
cure charge of the valuable prisoners.
Sheriff Johnson of Mendocino County
was i:i town Saturday. He thinks these
same men robbed the "Willits stage some
two weeks ago.
Thus far the men are supposed to have
committed the following robberies:
A store at Tomales Point, Marin County;
the Trenton Postotlice and a store at Free
stone, Sonoma County ; the Willits stage ;
Mendocino County, and a store in Cala
veras County. Their booty in most in
stances has been small, the entire total
probably not exceeding .SIOOO.

PORTLAND, Ob., Jan. 12. -An electric
car of the Easiside Railroad Company,
having left Oregon City at 0:20 this even
ing, was held up by a solitary robber be
tween Milwaukee and Oak Grove.
Tue robber, a slight built fellow, got on
the rear end of the car, and, sticking a big
revolver under the conductor's nose, made
him shell out all his change.
He then entered the car, containing
eight passengers, among whom were two
women, all of whom had to pay tribute to
the lonely highwayman.
lie proved himself to be a novice in the
business, though, as he allowed the pas
sengers to delve into their own pockets to
bring out their money. Had he been a
-r-ional he would have takeii no such
( bancea for fear of being shot.
He also walked the entire length of the
car, turning his back on some of the male
passengers.
The only circumstance saving his life
was that none of his victims carried a
pistol.
lie took no jewelry, and the greater part
of the money on the persons of the passen
gers they saved. a< the robber was very
nervous and seemingly anxious to get
away as hurriedly a* possibte.
At 8 o'clock to-night the coachman of
Arthur EmmonÃ, a prominent lawyer
here, was held up on the White House
road by two thugs.
Then the robbers took possession of the
and buggy he was taking to Pales
tine Hill, where Mr. Emmons live?, and
they (irove the rig into town.

Yesterday.
NOTED GUESTS PRESENT.
Two Excursion Trains and Eoth
Were Filled to Over
flowing.
CONCESSION OF THE RAILWAY CO.
Mountain Band on Hand, Led by Dr.
George Towle, the Lumber
Magnate.
TRLTKEE. Cat,, Jan. 12.â Fully 2000
people witnessed the sights of the ice car
nival to-day.
Excursion train arrived from all direc
tions, each bringing from seventy-five to
;iOO people, ea?er to see the promised at
tractions.
The first excursion arrived at 6:30 this
morning attached to the eastbound over
land train. Among the prominent people
in this party were Sam Miller, gen
eral tourist passenger agent of the
Southern Pacific; Master Mechanic
Fmall of Sacramento; Assistant Division
Superintendent Jones, Passenger Agent
MeCord, J. p. Meehan and wife, ,T. 11.
Scott and wife, J. S. Speer and wife, C. S.

Mrs. S. A. Judson, Pearl Judson, Bert-
Benedict, H. D. Hawkes, G. M. Wilde, 11.
11. Taylor and S. H. Taylor, all of San
Francisco.
There were four Pullman carloads of
them, and they came from San Francisco,
S:m Jose, Stockton, Sacramento, and a
large number were from the southern part
of the State.
At 1 o'clock a second excursion party
arrived, and this special train was com
posed of live local coaches, comfortably
filled with people. By actual count 209
persons were aboard, and not a few were
from Grass Valley, Nevada City, Colfai
and Marysville.
To add to the life of this narty Towle's
band, composed of twenty-live pieces, ac
companied them, and as the train pulled
into the station the band struck up the
National air of "Columbia."
This band is led by George Towle, the
lumber magnate, and is composed of men
in his own employ. To their credit it
muÂ«t be said that their music was superior
to that of most mountain bands. Fifty
people accompanied the band from Towles.
Among those who came on this train
were: George Towle and wife; Al Pmith,
manager of Towle's store, accompanied by
family; 11. C. Kinney and wife, Joseph
Smart, Frank Ketchum.all of Towles: Don
Cottrell, an attorney from Grass Valley;
William Bray. Thomas Rogers, George
Murphy, H. C. Calahan, also of < ira--^ Val
ley : Dr. Hanna, Walter Stokes, .1. B. .Toost
and a number of others from Sacramento.
The Truckee Band was at the station to
meet the trains and it seemed as though
all Truckee turned out to greet the stran
gers.
Many extra sleighs were called into
requisition for the accommodation of the
visitors and the rouds were excellent for
this amusement.
There were at least 200 people among the
crowd to-day who had never seen snow be
fore, and the way they pelted each other
wiih snowballs and reveled in it was good
evidence of their delight.
The time passed much too quickly for
these people. At 3 o'clock the tooting of
horns and jingle of sleigh bell* attracted
the attention of the people to a long line
of sleighs coming down the Boca road.
This proved to be John McDonald, and
almost the whole population of that small
but prosperous place.
They drove into town, their sleighs
gavly decorated in carnival colors and
carrying banners with such inscriptions as :
"No bubbles in our ice," "Our ice is
clean," and other similar ones.
They resembled a Fourth of July parade
as they inarched and countermarched
through town. In all about one hundred
came with this party.
Information leaked out to-day that the
Coupons would not be sold with railroad
excursion tickets hereafter, and that a3 a
consequence the railroau company would
make a much greater reduction in the
rate< of travel to the Carnival.
This will allow people the privilege of
seeing the Carnival without being com
pelled to pay the cost of seeing the entire
list of attractions.
Applications still come to the manage
ment asking them to set apart special
days. The volunteer firemen will prob
ably be granted a day in the near future.
The Native Sons will celebrate on the
25th inhi. and the Knights of Pythias on
Friday, January 17. Fireworks and illumi
nations on the rocking-stone tower is the
chief feature of to-night's entertainment.
SAN QUINTIN MURDERER
Gambles Away His Property and
Then Shoots His
Wife.
He Renders Partial Reparation by
Turning the Gun on
Himself.
SAN PIEGO, Cal., Jan. 12.â Details of a
murder and suicide at Santo Domingo,
Lower California, were received to-day by
the steamer Pacheco, which arrived from
San Quintin.
A courier arrived there Thursday with a
letter from Manuel Maytorel, Justice of
the Peace of Santo Domingo, saying that
the bodies of nis brother Joaquin and the
latters wife, Isabel, had been found side
by side, with a bullet-hole through the
head of each.
In Joaquin's hand was a revolver, ana
all the chickens, dogs and horses on the
place had been shot.
The case was not investigated closely by
the neighbors, but it apoeared to be clearly
a case of murder and tmicide on Joaquin's
part.
He was of a violent temper and ad
dicted to drink. Some days ago he at
tended a fiesta at San Telmo and gambled
away all his property. His wife was with
him, and as she was a pretty girl she at
tracted much attention and made him
frantically jealous.
He was robbed of his watch and money.
An investigation after the finding of the
bodies showed that . l oaquin in his frenzy
bad killed every living thins upon the
place, winding: np his bloody work by
shooting his wife several times and put
ting a bullet through his own brain. The
Judge at San Quintin and a couple of doc
tors went to the place to hold an inquest.
During Wednesday nipht a number of
shots were heard coming from his house,
but no attention was paid to them, as he
frequently shot at coyotes.

Jackson of Ensenada, the young English- I
man who was arrested last March for the
aheged robbery of $3000 from Godbe &
Co.'s Bank, of which he was cashier, has
been released on orders of the Appellate
Court of the City of Mexico.
There was never the slightest proof that
he was guilty, but the Ensenada .ludge !
kept him in jail six months, part of the i
time releasing him, however, on $15,000
bail through the efforts of influential j
friends in the British Foreign Otlice.
In November Jackson was| sentenced to '

HEALDSBURG FISHERMEN
They Are Arrested by Commis
sioner Babcock While
Seining.
Several Arrests Are Expected to Fol
low and There Is Much
Speculation.
HEALDSBURG, Cm... Jan. 12.â Pish
Commissioner Babcock made quite a haul
yesterday when he arrested Al Duncan,
William King, Fred Rice and N. Fore
man, all prominent residents of this place,
for illegal fishing.
The men were seining salmon in Rus
sian Kiver about four miles below tin's
city and had captured about one hundred
fish when the Commissioner swooped
down upon them.
The seine used was of large size, the
rushes being small, however, and many
small tish were taken.
These, however, had been returned to
the stream.
After placing the offenders under arrest
the olhcer returned all the salmon but
three to the stream. These, with the
seine, he brought to town to use as evi
dence against the accused.
It is said that several more arrests will
follow for the same offense, and it is be
lieved in this city that Mr. Babcock has
been patrolling the stream for some days
getting names.
The arrests have caused much talk.
At this season of the year the Russian
River and its tributaries are alive with
salmon, and the majority of people are
pleased to see that their destruction is
being prevented. All the men are out on
bail.

Thi-tl Were Those of a Large Cliinatna-n
Who Had lieen Dead for Tears.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 12.â As four
young men were cutting wood about two
miles from Folsora yesterday they com
menced to cut down a hollow tree about
three feet in diameter.
"When it was about half cut down a hu
man thighbone rolled out of the cavity,
followed shortly afterward by a skull.
They were scared ana ran to Folsom.but
returned with other persons and the bones
were taken tnere and buried.
They proved to be those of a large China
man, a queue about eight inches long re
maining on the skull. As the only hole
in the tree was about twelve feet from the
ground, it is a mystery as to how he got
into the tree. "
The bones were dry and white and had
evidently been in the tree for a great many
years.
Drowned in a JCeservoir.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 12.â Henry
Webber, a well-known youne man of Fol
som, was drowned in a reservoir near
there yesterday.
He was subject to fits and it is supposed
that he was overtaken by one while wading
out to get a duck he had" killed, and. being
unable to help himself, was drowned.
An inquest was held and a verdict of ac
cidental drowning was rendered.
LEAD FLEW LIKE HAIL
Splendid Scores Made by Rifle
men at the Shell Mound
Range.
THE NEW COLUMBIA TARGET.
Pistol and Rifle Shooters Greatly
Pleased With F. 0. Young's
New Production.
From early yesterday morning until as
late as the targets cculd be seen the crack
of rifles kept up a merry din at the Shell
Mound shooting range. The conditions
were remarkably coor for good scores, a
heavy haze hanging over the entire Berke
ley shore, and the wind, beins* from the
north, blew the smoke back into the marks
men's faces.
The Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club was
out in full force. The principal interest
was centered in the new target originated
by Fred 0. Young, which was adopted by
the club. It is strictly an American target
and tboÂ«e who did not have a chance to
during the experimental period were
anxious to see what they could do upon it
with rifle and pistol for it is adapted
equally to both.
The Columbia target is a decided de
parture from all other targets in several
particulars. In the first place the count is
reversed, starting from the unit in the
center, whereas in other ring: targets an
arbitrary number is t>laced in the center
of the bullseye. In order\Jo pet the inch
as the unit of value the half-inch lines
have been adopted.
This makes the diameter of the inner
circle, or center ring, one inch. This gives
two values to the figures, the diameter
value in inches and the distance from the
center in half niche?. On being shown by
the marker a 1, 2, .t or 4 the marksman
knows that his builet has struck within
a 1.2. 3or 4 inch circle. He also knows
the distance of each bullet from the center
in half inches. These circles are carried
as high as 26, the outer circle being 26
inches in diameter, or 18 inches from the
center. Thus tbe total of a string of shot 9
is the approximate string measure in half

bia Target.

inches. The total divided by the number
of shots shows the average size of the cir
i eje in inches. A score of 10 shots, total 4."),
! shows that the marksman has an average
; of a 4.5 inch circle.
i To express Creed more points on the Co
lumbia target the rule is very simple. Be
tween 1 and 8 Columbia Is s Crerdmore.
Between 8 and 'Jt; Columbia is 4 Creed more
I and outside is a 'â > Creedinore, at 200 yards.
j The same size target un be used at shorter
: ranges. At 100 yard'; the 4 Columbia is
I the 5 Creedmore. At 50 yards the 2is the
.">, at 25 yards the 1 is "the 5 Creedmore.
This does away with the necessity of re
ducing targets for shorter ranges* A. 12
--inch black disk or bullseye is used, but its
; use is principally for the convenience of
; the eye, and not an object upon which to
! base computation.
' To ;be thoroughly American, another
innovation was made. When snooting on
the point target and a center, or 25, was
made, the marker waved a red Hag. No
; red flag waves in front of the Columbia
target when a center is announced. It is
the 5-tars and stripes.
It had been decided to offer cash prizes
to the marksmen getting the flag for the
hrst and last center shot in the pistol and
rifle targets. Dr. Rodgers made toe first
! center on the rifle in the morning, and V.
O. loungthe last in the afternoon. On
the pistol target Young made the lirst
center and Charles M. Dai.-s the last.
On the pisiol range the first centers
i were made by F. Dennis of Mount Eden
I and Al Gehret. but they were shoot
; ing practice scores instead of record scores,
â¢ or they would have made something in
; their centers. A iarge number of centers
j or ones were made during the day on all
i the Columbia targets. The new 'targets
i were unanimously declared to be a success,
| and every marksman was satisfied that
ne obtained the full value of every shot.

Central Park.
The baseball matcn at Central Park
yesterday afternoon between the Olympics j

The game was marked by no particularly '
brilliant plays, but Pequigney of the

Five'times he got his base on balls, and
each time he succeeded in scoring a run.
The Pacifies won the game by the score
of 11 to S. They got a start of Gin the hrst
three innings which the Olympics were
unable to overcome, although in the ;

BRAIN_FOODS.
A Delusion and a Snare.
It is strange that so many brain-workers
and thinkersâ people who might be ex-
pected to be not easily imposed uponâ
throw away their money 0:1 so-called
"brain foods" and "brain invigorators''
as if that most intricate and mysterious or-
gan could be "fed" or affected in such a
direct way.
It is preposterous!
The condition of the brainâ its capacity
for workâ depends on the general physical
condition â particularly of the digestion
system, which includes a long chain of or-
gans and functions.
The sedentary habits of brain-workers
debilitate this machinery of nutrition.
xNuture needs assistanceâ v gentle, healthy
stimulant.
Peruvian P>it:ers are far and away above
anything ever offered for this purpose.
Their beneficial effects are simply wonder-
ful, rheir great eriicacy lies in the com-
binationâthe world-famous Peruvian Bark
with other valuable herbs in tine old Cali-
fornia Brandy. Peruvian Bitters are the
greatest of tonics; gently stimulating di-
gestion without creating a morbid appetite
for stimulants; toning up the entire svs-
tera, quickening all vital functions, dfiv-
ine out malarial ooisons, and producing
euch a physical condition that all faculties
are at their best and health is unaffected
by tne ordinary irregularities, exposures
and overwork that even the most careful
cannot avoid.

until the other cocks had sent forth their

of the First Congregational Church weak
ens nis cai;-
There has just come to the surface a
matter which Attorney (Gallagher thinks
may have some bearing on the arrest of
his client. It is an alleged conference be
tween Dr. Brown, Miss Overman and Mrs.
Tunnel!, which took place at the Cosmo
politan Hotel, Saturday, December 2l, just
one week prior to toe arrest of Mrs. David-
About 6:30 o'clock December 20 Miss
Overman called at the C srnopolitan
]lotel and after some parleying engaged a
room for a iady friend, iShe registered the
name of Mrs. Tunnel] and then left, tak
ing the key to the room with her. Just
what hour Mrs. Tunnell came in is not
known, but that she was accompanied by
Miss Overman there seems to be littfe
doubt.
The next morning (Saturday) about 10
o'clock it is claimed that Dr. Brown
called and was in conference with the two
ladies until after 12 o'clock. Of course just
what occurred at that meeting will prob
ably never be known, but Gallagher pro
poses to rind out if possible.
'1 would not like to state under oath,"
aai-i the clerk of the Cosmopolitan Hotel
} t-Mcrday, "that it was Miss Overman who
t-ngaged the room, yet I am morally confi
dent it 'vas she. There was some argu
im-ut over the price, the jronng lady ihially
paying To cents, with the understanding
that or>ly one person was to occupy tin.
room. when Mrs. Tunnell came in Ido
not know, but she was accompanied by the
young lady who engaged the room. 1 pre-
Himc they both occupied it tnat nigh:.
The Met morning a gentleman called, and
lie was closeted with them for two or three
liu'.irs. I have since learned that this" man
is Dr. Brown, who now claims that he is
the ictim of a blackmailer."
The nopolitan house is where Mrs.
B::ilflin. concerning whose identity and
existence there is mnch doubt, lived when
ishe approached Mrs. Davidson. At least
that in the story told by the Jatter, but she
has not been corroborated as yet. The
prisoner is conlident that the conference
took place between Dr. Brown, Miss Over
man and Mrs. TurTnell, and further it was
then and there agreed to place the matter
in the hands of the police.
" As a fact," she adds, "it was given over
to Captain Lees on the following Monday,
culminating in my arrest just one week
fier the conference."
Attorney Gallagher is thoroughly indig
nant at wiiat he considers "unjust" treat
ment at the hands of Judge Campbell, and
â -ay?, tic is confident the Superior Court
will deal more leniently with his client.
"I am confident," he said yesterday,
"that the upper court will allow me to go
into any and every thing that reflects on
JÂ»r. Brown's character, or, in fact, any
thing reflecting on the church in eencral.
There are many scandals connected with
that institution, and 1 propose to have
tbeÂ§ exploited bejore the public. 4l> Â«
well known, Dr. Brown is mixed up in
other disgraceful affairs besides this, and
I am not surprise-l that he should en
deavor to distract public gaze from him
self by throwing mud on others. He is
backed by influential members of the
church, and 1 rather think the searchlight
of truth and justice will fall on them be
fore a preat while."
Dr. Brown occupied the pulpit of the
First Congregational Church again last
night, taking as nis subject "Beethoven. "
DR. BROWN PREACHES.
His Sermon an Apoloery for Appear
ing In the Pulpit and aPleafor
Suspension of Judgment.
Rev. Dr. C. 0. Brown occupied the pul
pit of the First Congregational Church
yesterday and conducted the services as
heretofore. He utilized his sermon as a
combination apology and pleaâ apology
for appearing in the pulpit under the pe
culiar existing circumstances and plea for
a suspension of judgment on him until
such time as he or his congregation might i
think it advisable to hold an investigation
of the charges m.ide by Mrs. M. A. David
son, the alleged blackmailer.
There was a well-filled auditorium, com
prising a large number of strangers, drawn
thither in evident expectation of hearing
Something bearing on the great scandal.
Dr. Brown opened the services by an
nouncing the hymn in a clear, linn voice.
After prayer and another hymn he read
from a memorandum various announce
ments of meetings in the church during
the week and then began his sermon,
â  choosing as his text the ihirty-iirst verse
from the fortieth chapter of Isaiah, as fol
lows :
But they that wait upon the Lord shall re
new their strencth; they shall mount up with
win?s as eagles; they shall run, nnd not be
weary, and they shall walk and not laiut.
All Scripture, he claimed, was based on
the actual experience of mankind. "I
want you to follow me in the philosophy
of the text 1 nave chosen," he said. "We
are to wait upon the Lord in the time of
our trials, not necessarily in idleness. But
sometimes it may mean "just that. When
you come to see you are s-urrounded with
evil, it is noi for you to rebel. You need
not try to build a bridge when, liKe the
Israelites of old, you come to a Red Sea.
ait. There are strange experiences in
all our lives that compare with that Red
Bea. There are more camps of the Egyp
tians than those that were overwhelmed
in the Red Sea.
Sdch trials are for a divine purpose. All
one can do is to wait after one has done
his best. Let him repeat from Scripture :
"They that wait shall renew * their
strength:
He then cited Joseph and the "vile
charges" that were brought against him,
and his subsequent victory and triumph
over his enemies. David, Ahab, Paul and
Daniel were referred to as having had sim
ilar experiences, as having borne their
| troubles with courage, fortitude and pa
j tience, and endeavoring during the period
I they were under a cloud to do good to their
I fellow-men. He continued:
These men had not rebelled against God.
j They continued in patience and silence. They
recognized these things were of divine crea- j
tion, and they waited and renewed their
strength, and In God's time their bonds broke
I and they came fortn triumphant.
Darkness is upon the deep, but the ship has
not gone down. Keep your hand upon the !
helm. We are to wait upon the Aimlghty and
wait with prayers.
At every stage of the journey of life there are
pitfalls and there is many a victory in pa
lience. I quite agree witri Mrs. Browning.who
in one of her great poems says: "1 work will:
| patience, which is always power."
Other great examples of the exercise of
patience and subsequent great victories
wore then cited, his closing words being:
"They that wait upon the Lord shall re
; new their strength."
When the pastor left the pulpit at the
I close of the services many of the congrega
-1 tion came forward to jrreet him, and thus
. tactfully express their confidence in him â
ladies and gentlemen alike. .But in the
J fnces and manners of most could be dis
| covered that excebs of cordiality that indi
| cated the unuttered but oppressive sense
of something to be ignored. Tnia ovet
done geniality was particularly noticeable
in the pastor himself.
One of the male members of the congre
gation was inclined to be too sparing of
the pastor's power of fortitude and failed
to rest his eyes full upon the clergyman's
face. But the quick perception and" adroit
tact of the doctor uid not fail him, despite
the group of ladies and gentlemen who
surrounded him. -'Look me squarely in
the eyes," he distinctly and quite dramat
ically admonished hi 3 diffident friend; j
and the latter did so. ,
An attempt was made to interview the
doctor after his greetings were over, but
he fled into his study, remarking that he
was under orders not to talk for publica
tion. It was desired to ask him if he had
determined to nsk for an investigation,
and if so when it was to take place. Sev
eral of the prominent members of his con
gregation have signified their determina
tion to ask for an investigation should the
pastor not anticipate them, and in justice
to the reverend eentleman it was deemed
proper under the circumstances to give
him the opportunity of announcing to the
i public his proposed course in the matter.
He was found aaain later in the ante
room to the Sunday-school room, but be
fore any question could be put to him he i
dashed into a group of ladies, and, not de
sirine to unnecessarily embarrass the
preacher by asking pointed questions in
the presence of his lady parishioners, the
interviewer discreetly desisted. t
AN INSURANCE SWINDLER.
A Nebraska Correspondent Tells
Something: of Mrs. Davidson's
Eastern Record.
Dr. Brown has received the follow
ing communication, which he has
turned over to Captain Lees. It is
presumed that from this letter Attorney
Lloyd received the "tips" which enabled
the prosecution to bring out much dam
aging evidence againt Mrs. Davidson:
Jll'mphkey, Xebr., Jen. 5, 189 G. â¢
Dr. C. 0. Brown, First Congregational Church,
San Franciscoâ Dear Sib: Tnree days ngo I re
ceived a letter from A. \V. Illhon, In which he
Informed me of your present trouble with a
blackmailer, MrÂ«. Davidson. He wished me to
intorm him at once whether that could be the
same woman to whose wiles I became a victim
in an insurance scheme 6be had In. Albany, N.
V., in 1884 or 1885. I wired him immediately
the following message:
I'ndoubtcdly the same womnn. Picture in Al
bany rosrueV 'ggtlery. Will write.
He wired back an answer, but did not say he
would tnke the message to you, and out of fear
that the information may come too late 1 ad
dress this letter to you in hope it might be of
some value to you. "
This woman's name when she swindled me
out of $28 was Mrs. Mary Sturgis. She had
; been in Albany quite a while beiore I became
licr victim, and had endeared herself to lead-
Ing church people by her work in prayer
meetingx, Sunday-schools and \V. ('. T. U.
work. The iir>-t time I saw her was nt a
womnn'h suffrage society of which I was a
member, and she was introduced as Mrs.
Sturgis. She spoke to us of Christ and repent
aiice, and conducted- by representing herself
as an agent of a woman's insurnnce company
of New York, and wanted us to insure with
her. Some time or other she had little slips
with explanations about insurance, which she
distributed among us. Not long after this she
called on me at my residence, st>3 Clinton
avenue, where wÂ« were in business. She had
a woman with her by the nnme of Mrs. Ayers
(afterward anested lor attempt to poison her
husband). Bhe talked so sensible about her
firm and presented everything so favorably
that I concluded to take out a policy for $3000,
premium $28, which she said included the net
assessment.
A couple of days after I received the policy
which she brought nerself, and after handing
me the. policy/which afterward proved fraudu
lent, she told me she had other serious ques
tions to ask me, and tnat was whether 1 was
insured with our Lord Jesus Christ. I told her
that as I was in business I had made it a prac
tice never lo talk religion with any one and
could not see what that had to do with the
policy she handed me. She was seemingly
very aiuch shocked at my answer and left
shortly after with thiÃ â , same woman who was
with her on her first visit. A few days after I
received a letter with call for remittance of $5,
first assessment. I immediately wrote that t
had paid Mrs. Sturgis $28, including iirst as
bessment.
A ebon time alter tUis sho was arrested on

then and had passed under different names.

members of the Suffrage Society found her pic
ture in the rogue's gallery at Albany nfier
ward. r have no doubt but that this Is the
same criminal in a different role, and I think
there is a large Rang of them. One name, if I
remember right, was Sadden, or somethiug
like that.
I have no doubt she will compell or hypno
tize the young woman to a confession of guilt
to save herself from prison and still further
implicate you. 1 can assure you of my sym
pathy, to have fallen in the clutches of this
terrible woman. I regret that lam not now in

and came to my home in Nebraska. My bon

terrible Mow to your family.
My husband hks also a very distinct remem
brance of this woman's face, as he saw me
talking with her at that time. Miss Mary

COURSING AT OCEAN VIEW.
Dashaway Won the Regular
Stake After a Hard Run
With Magpie.
Grain-Fed Hares That Kept the Dogs
in the Rear Until They Made
Their Escape.
Dashaway â "Old" Dashaway now â
never ran better in the day 3 of his youth
than he did yesterday at Ocean View
Coursing Park, and those who backed him
through the entire stake cleaned up a neat
sum. No amount of training or running
seems to taketne vigor out of his big brin
dle body, and the best of the thirty-two
dogs that chased the elusive hares went
down before him in hollow style.
The crowd that assembled was the
largest that has been on the grounds for
months past, and the quality of the sport
was fully up to expectations. The draw
ing brought many evenly matched hounds
together and unusually heavy betting was
the result.
The grair>-fed hares, some of which have
been in the paddocks since November last,
were stronger than ever, and in some in
stances fairly ran away from the dogs,
darting into the escapes and leaving the
exhausted canines paJitinjr outside. This
was the case in the run between Magpie
and Faster, when the hare, after lead
ing the pair twice across the big field,
gained on them at every leap as they drove
him toward an escape.
As usual a number of long shots won
their courses and kept the short-end play

WILL MAGUIRE SAY SACK?
Mayor Sntro Think* Ho Will Denounce
It in tho Funding Bill.
Mayor Sutro is hopeful that the funding
bill will be defeated in the House.
"Yes," said the Mayor yesterday, "I
have hopes that the funding bill will be
defeated in the House. From the latest
advices I have from Washington it ap
pears that Huntington has half of the
House, but it is not certain that he caii
hold all these. If, when the matter comes
up for debate, a member arises and makes
the announcement that there is a sack be
hind the measure and there is a job in it,
the members who declared themselves in
a way favorable to the measure will hesi
tate before casting their votes.
"From what I know of Congressmen
there are some afraid of being charged
with bribery. Now, I do not wish to ex
press any opinion of our representative?
in Congress, but I will say that I think
Congressman Maguire will talk, ana it is
possible that he may say that there is a
6ack to be used to refund a debt greater
than the capital of the greatest bank in
the worldâ the Bank of Englandâ that
has only $70,000,000.
"Bribery will be resorted to in order to
carry this measure. I say go and could
prove it if necessary. The press should
act as a unit in this matter and wake up
the people to the necessity of lighting the
proposition to impose such an outrageous
measure upon them.
"News of what is being done here is not
transmitted as fully as it. should be, and in
order to keep our friends at Washington
posted as to what is going on, I have to
send them private dispatches. I am in
this fight for the people and will stand by
it until a certain warm place freezes over.
'â¢The Senate? No, there is no hope for
us in the Senate. I feel quite confident
that the measure will pass there. Our only
hope is the House. We are going to have
a rousing convention in spite of the octo
pus that will endeavor to pack the house
in its favor."
NEW TROOP ARMORY.
The Cavalry Organization of the Guard
Intends to Move Downtown.
Troop A, the cavalry organization of the
National Guard, proposes to change its
headquarters from the building on Pacific
avenue to some place suitable for armory
purposes nearer the center of town. The
matter of a change was discussed a few
nights ago and the scheme has met with
general favor. A committee of three men
of the troop is now at work trying to rind
a building in the neighborhood of Union
square which might be converted into an
armory.
For a couple of years the old light bat
tery, which had its headqmrterson Pacin'c
avenue, found it difficult to secure recruits
because its headquarters were too far from
town. When the battery was transformed
into a cavalry troop the same difficulty
presented itself and the troop ha* set
about to remedy the evil. If suitable quar
ters can be found in the downtown dis
trict the new troop will give up the tnn
bark ring and riding classes which are
now features of the mounted brancli of
the service in this City.
The armory now occupied by the troop
was built for Light Battery A about six
years ago. It is now occupied by one of
the Naval Battalion companies, the cav
ujry organization aud a riding academy.
DR. MINTON ON ARMENIA
Christian Europe a^-Silent but
Guilty Partner in the Sul
tan's Crimes.
NO MAN LIVES TO HIMSELF.
It Is Time That Men Should Be Their
Brother's Keepers, Says the Pastor
of Westminster Church.
In Westminster Presbyterian Church
yesterday morning the Rev. H. C. Minton,
D.D., took for his text Galatians vi:10:
"As we have therefore opportunity, let us
do eood unto all men, especially unto
them who are of the household of faith."
He took occasion to speak of the Armenian
question in the course of his sermon. He
said:
Christianity preaches tho gospsl of
practical duty. Matthew Arnold says,
"Conduct is three-fourths of life," but if we
remember that conduct is the language of
character it is nearly four-fourths.
The scope of the text is very broad.
The Christian should be an all-sided
philanthropist. God makes his rain to
fall on the unjust and his sun to shine on
the evil, and we are to be perfect even as
he is perfect. Christ bids us love our ene
mies.
More and more the world is catching
this conception. It is the very genius of
ethical Christianity. As the world grows
smaller by the use of steam and electricity
and all that, the thoughts and sympathies
of men are growing larger. In distance,
as measured by time, there is no city in
the world to-day as far from San Francisco
MISS MAID MORRELL AND J. C. WILSON JR., MEMBERS OF THE CHARITY
COMPANY THAT WILL PLAY "7-20-8" FOR THE RELIANCE CLUB IN
OAKLAND.
\Drava /Â»/ a "Call" artist from photographs.]
ni Now York was fifty yours ago. The
crops of Hindustan affect the markets of
London and Chicago, and a skirmish In
South Africa stirs up all Europe. The
unity of mankind is a most commonplace
fact to-day.
This brings the ethical aspects of life to
the front. Time was when every tribe
counted every other its natural foe. It is
now aeen to be wiser to call it its natural
friend. Society is a joint stock concern.
Every human being is'an integral, though
infinitesimal factor in the life and destiny
of the world.
Modern history only furnishes expanded
areas for the enactment of the parable of
the good samaritan, "This is my neigh
bor." This finds its answer as a thing of
spirit and not of geography.
"No man liveth to himself." Every good
man says to himself, "I owe every other
man my test. In so far as I fall short (if
that best, I rob society and the state and
the world. I owe the right my defense, and
the wrone â my defiance. A ' Roman Em
peror said lie felt uncomfortable as long as
there was a good man in Rome. Every
good man should feel uncomfortable as
long as there is a bad Emperor anywhere.
Christiunity may be more, but it is human
ity, too. Civilization is not Christianity,
but if they are not inseparably allied, then
so much the worse for the one or the other,
or both. That religion is of the devil and
not of God that does not make men more
manly, more loyal to the right, more ten
der to the appeal of the suffering and
more valiant in the championship of rhe
good and the true. Nor does distance nor
creed stop the Christian's ear to the voice
of that appeal. Does a Thebcw massacre
the helpless people of Bunnah? Does a
juggernaut in the name of religion crush
the superstitious Hindoos of India? Does
a Czar oppress or banish the Jews in Rus
sia?
Then a Thebaw and a Czar are criminals
before the world and the bloody-wheeled
chariot is the means of torture and not of
prate. Does the Sultan outrage the Ar
menians of Asia Minor? Then the world
that permits his outrages to continue be
comes a silent but guilty partner in his
crime. Have 60,000 been slain and are
:^50,000 people starving, hiding, hunted
like scared wild beasts in that distressed
district to-tlay? And where is Christian
Europe? Are the ethical obligations of
Christian civilization now to be ignored?
Is it not true that men are their brothers'
keepers? I do not need to disguise from
you. in the house of God to-day, that the
Armenians are Christians. They belong
to one of the most ancient andhonored
communions of Oriental Christendom. It
is their misfortune to dwell on soil over
which the scepter of the Ottoman empire
extends. They have been for ages between
the upper and nether millstone. They
are not perfect. Nobody is. But the un
speakable Turk is no longer endurable.
The sickly despot of Constantinople has
outlived his right to rule. Only a pro
found conviction that God rules, 'and that
he rules rigtit, reconciles the world to the
existence of Turkey to-day, and if the life
and reign of the Sultan are to continue
long as they are, civilization may well in
terpret the fact as the intimation of the
Almighty that the time has come to sweep
the imperial cesspool of intrigue and de
ceit off the map of the modern world.
The sword is the symbol ot Islam. The
faith of Mohammed has fattened on the
blood of the infidel. There is the hatred
that is born of such a religion as that, that
must be counted as a factor in the sicken
ing situation in Turkey today.
Hut apart from that, no question of
d'plc.macy, or finance, or statecraft can
blind the eyes of the world to the fact that
risrht is right, and right only has a right
to be.
But still the cruel work goes on. Mr.
Gladstone in a letter of regret to the mass
moeting in London a fortnight ago said:
"The six great powers, which among them
spend more than Â£100,000,000 sterling
yearly upon what is termed their defense.",
lie prostrate at tue feet of an impotent
Sultan, who, with their cognizance, ap
pears to prosecute massacres at his will
day by day."
is there no respite? Must the Armenians
die crushed under the heel of the Turk?
Shall organized pillage and carnage go on
and the whole world sit off in horror while
a few crowiied Leads tuku their leisure iv
c
playing out their game of diplorn ati
chess?
W. W. Howard, who penetrated Arme
nia, ?aid in the New York World of Sep
tember 15: "The horrors of the present
hour in Armenia have not yet heen toJd,
even in a thousandth part."
Well may Bed t land 'a genius-bard say,
"Man's inhumanity to man makes count
less thousands mourn." Our meeting to
morrow nieht is to give answer in words
the world may understand. We are to do
good to all men. Charity may begin at
home, but if it enda there it is not charity.
We are less worthy to be Christians if our
indignation were less stirred had the Arme
nians been Jews, or Roman Catholics, or
liuddhists, or infidels.
God bless Clara Barton as she goes with
her Red Cross to the sufferers in Armenia.
Let our gilts go with her. After all, our
prayer must be to God for Armenia, for our
faith is in him alone. He rules. Kings and
Queens are but puppets in his hand. His
plans mature slowJy, but they mature. T;!e
Sultan will play his part and then he will
pass off. Only let our prayer be that in the
policies and diplomacies, in the wars and
treaties of the nations, he will prepare and
pave the way for the coining of his King
dom, which is the kingdom of peace and
righteousness, and justice and truth.
LADIES SHOW GRATITUDE.
The Fabiola Association to
Return the Debt of
the Fete.
President Fitzgerald of the Reliance
Club Assured of a Very Suc
cessful Benefit.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 12. j
The social leaders of Oakland have de
cided that two j-'ood turns merit at least
one, and acting on this decision they|are
determined that the Reliance rendition
of "7-20-8" at the Macdonou<*h next week
Bball be :i success. When Oakland's ladies
say anything must be successful, it is per
fectly safe to assume that they know what
they are talking about.
Robert Fitzgerald's energy in presiding
over the Fabiolafete aroused the gratitude
|of the Fabiola Hospital Association and
i they have decided to help President Jritz
i gerald of the Reliance Club in return. The
I ladies, under the auspices of Mrs. John
Yule, their president, are doing all they
I can to guarantee two packed houses.
I On another occasion the Ladies' Relief
I Society was benefited by the Reliance
j Club, whose members presented "Romeo
; and Juliet" for the benefit of the Temescal
I Home. Now the relief society has decided
to boom the Reliance benefit. These two
social elements working' hand in hand
leave all doubt, aside, and the club will
certainly receive a substantial benerit.
The debt that the club is anxious to
j wipe out was due to the heavy expenses of
j the football team. This is the more dis
appointing to the club, as their football
players were never beaten during the en
tire season. The company is said by Mr.
| Cooper of the Columbia Dramatic School
, to be the most polished and talented,
| without exception, that he has ever met in
the amateur field.
The performances will be given Friday
I and Saturday, January 24 and 25.
BEDS FOR POOR MEN.
The Minna-Street Home Removes to
Better Quarterg in the Same Block.
The ladies in charge of the charitable
institution known as the "Men's Home"
I have left their old quarters at 55 Minna
j street and are now located in a more com
i modious house at No. 34 on the same
| street. The change of quarters was made
| necessary within the past few weeks for
the reason that the home had not been
self-supporting. It was taxed to its utmost
capacity, but the number of beds at the
disposal of the managers was not suffi
cient to bring in the necessary income.
At 34 Minna street, near First, the
Home is admirably quartered. A rather
large and neat-looking house has been
rented and the ladies interested in the
work are busy nutting things in shape for
the accommodation of about 100 lodgers.
There are twenty-one rooms in the house,
and while only forty-two bunks are now
in place, there will be twice that number
within, a few weeks. The ladies are work
ing hard to bring _ the institution to the
notice of the charitable public They are
now providing beds and meals for 10
cents a night and very often gratuitously.
Donations of men's clothing and of bed
ing are much desired and if cards are
mailed to the home such articles will be
sent for.
The ladies who constitute the board of
managers are: Mrs. Hale Rix, Mrs.
Waldron Spinney, Mrs. H. S. Robertson,
Mrs. A. O. Eckman, Mrs. S. Lyon, and
Mrs. Wolfe.

PALMER'S CAUSTIC WORDS
American Protective Association
Orator Pays His Respects
to Catholicism.
METROPOLITAN TEMPLE PACKED
Brewer Scores the Y. M. I.â Two
Thousand People Listen to the
Speeches.
Over 2000 persona were present at the
Good Citizen.-hip m eetine Jield in Metro
politan Temple yesterday afternoon under
tbe auspices of the A. P. A. societies.
Before 3 o'clock tbe seating room in the
auditorium was all taken, and those who
found a place to stand in the galleries
counted themselves fortunate.
The large audience was nearly equally
composed of members of both sexes,
thouch the men may have slightly out
numbered.
Several prominent members of the A. P.
A. of both sexes occupied seats on the
siage. H. W. Quitzow acted as chairman.
The formal opening of the meeting was
preceded by a long organ voluntary, ren
dered by Professor E. Werner.
"When the last note had lost itself among
the echoes Chairman Quitzow stepped for
ward, and in a few short sentences for
mally opened the session. Stating the
purposes of the meeting, and referring in
complimentary terms to the speaker of the
day, the Rev. Ray Palmer, lie concluded
by saying that since the last A. P. A. meet
ing the walls of the building had been
purified by the singing of "America," and
that the grand old patriotic anthem would
be sung again.
His reference was a sarcasm on the Y.
M. I. rendition of the patriotic anthem at
a meeting recently held by that organiza
tion in the Temple. Regardless of the ap
plication or other considerations, the re
mark elicited the applause of the audi
ence.
The old song was sung and with great
spirit.
The Rev. Waugh, "Old Father Waugh,"
as he has been known to his many iriends
on the coast for the last forty years, offered
v short and eloquent prayer, after which
Miss Ada Schmied sang with good effect
a song written by Clifford entitled,
"There's a Tramp of Romish Legions."
A few introductory remarks were made
by Mr. W. T. Brewer, during the course of
which he indulged in a sarcastic eulogy cf
Father Yorke and the Y. M. I.
He "had no doubt," he said, "that the
reverend gentleman of Catholic faith re
ferred to would discuss the principal ques
tions at issue in an honest and candid and
unprejudiced way over a beefsteak. Un
fortunately the opportunity for such a dis
cussion uad not been offered." He made
ironical illusion to the patriotic spirit in
fusing the meeting of the Y. M. 1., and
scored those Catholics from which had
eminated certain criticisms of the public
school system, and in this connection re
ferred to the fact that in the schools of
i^anta Barbara are employed, among oth
ers, fourteen teachers from Catholic
parochial school?. Those teachers ac
knowledged that they had never attended
the public schools.
Mr. Brewer said he was not so bigoted
that he would deny the riL'ht of a Catholic
to teach in our schools, but he thought
that under sued circumstances as these,
the Catholic criticism of our school system
is little lc^s than intolerant.
The Colton children, small boys and
girls in patriotic dress, sang a musical A.
P. A. song, the American sentiment of
which, in connection with the anti-Catholic
subtleties, excited an ebullition of applause.
Each rendering of the chorus was accom
panied by tiie waving of the American
ll.iirs held in each youthful hand.
The usual collection was then taken up.
and the remark of Chairman Quitzow tha.t
th^ sinews of war were needed "to carry
on the good work," did not fall on deaf
ears, if one might judge from the merry
jingle of the small coin as it was dropped
into the Japanese wicker-baskets of the
ushers.
The Rev. Kay Palmer was then intro
duced, and the large audience settled itself
comfortably in the 2000 or more seats
preparatory to listening to the address of
the day. In part, he said:
In the Bible we read of the prophet who went
out and viewed the Valley of Dry Bones. And,
lo and behold, while he gazed, a wind blew
upon them and they came together until at
last before the wondering gaze of the prophet
Uioy stood up n mighty army.
Ko? mnny years the Catholic ecclesiatlclsra
of tiiis country has been like a "volley of dry
Ij.uk's,' but now tncy have ronie together anil
stand forth a great army ready to defend the
American flap. [Laughter ]
The greatest compliment paid to the A. P. A.
is found in the numerous meetings and the
prand oratory in which the Catholics are In
dulging all over the country. If we (the
A. P. A.) are wliat they say we "are, it must be
a great waste of time to pay so much attention
to such a low class of people. [Laughter.]
We are not warring ngainst the Catholics on
account t>f their religion; we are not making a
fifÂ»rit against the C'athoiic womenâ the mothers,
Bisters and daughters of the church; many of
the Catholics are Christians, and honest and
earnest Christians. We make the distinction
between the great body of the Catholics and
the church hierarchy. We do not deny the
right of any man to worship Cod as he will,
but desire to combat the interference of the
Catholic hierarchy with the political and civil
affairs of our country. Therefore, our fight
with the Catholics is political and not relig
ious.
He then quoted at some length Black
stone, Gladstone, Macaulay, Henry Clay,
Robert Montapue and others to show that
thinkers in the last tyro centuries have
predicted the aggressiveness of the church
in political and social affairs.
One thing that amuses me more than any
thing else is tho great patriotism that is being
developed by tho Catholic hierarchy. A few
days ngo Cardinal Gibbons addressed a large
concourse of Catholics at the raising of the
American flag over St. Peter's parochial school
in Haltimore, and during that eloquent dis
course he said that "one of the great modern
features of the Catholic church is its love for
education and for country."
At the close of Cardinal* Gibbons' address the
vast audience joined in sineing "America"
and "The Star-spangled Banner." How long
since the Catholics have learned to sing those
grand old patriotic songs? [Applause.] It is
only within the last lew weeks that they have
learned the melody of those songs. Before that
1 doubt if the majority of Catholics would rec
ognize cither of mem.
Now they are beginning to tell us that they
are not in favor of the union of church and
state. How long since have they suffered this
ehnnge of heart? But is it true? By no
means. The latest encyclical of the Pope shows
that the leopard has not changed his spots, and
the present protestation of the American Cath
olics through the V. M. 1. is due to the wide
spreading sentiment against their interference
with our political and civil and educational
affairs.
The church Is losing power in some of the
countries of Europe. The time Is coming when
there will be a disunion in Franco between
church and state, and it is the purpose of the
A. P. A. to dispute every step of the Catholic
hierarchy in its effort to subject America to the
papnl domination under which the countries
of Kit rope have struggled for so many cen
turies. We want to keep this country, its Gov
ernment and its schools for Americans, and
keep them out of the hands of the Y. M. I.
As to the charges which have been made
against the A. r. A.'s intelligence, all we can
sny la that if there is bad grammar, perhaps,
among our speakers, we do not answer argu
ments as some ot the priests do, by calling the
opposite side liars. There are many priests,
no doubt, who are willing and able to discuss
nny theological, political or social question
Honestly and gentlemanly.
But it is remarkable how much the priests
claim for the Catholics of America. According
to these heads of the church, all the great men
of this country have been Catholic*?. They say
George Washington died a Roman Catholic,
but kept it a secret and therefore died a liar in
the church of Rome. [Laughter.] All of our
great statesmen and military men in the last
war were Catholics.
I believe that if the Roman Catholics had
their wills they would make us all Catholics;
if they were in a position of power to do go
they would compel us to become of their faith,
even to the endangering of our school, social
and political systems. They would place the
Pope at the head of the Government and we
would all be his slave subjects.
No true Catholic can be a live patriot believ
ing in the Pope's supremacy. Patriotism does
not consist of outward demonstration. The
American and Catholic may sing the same
songs, and one will be moved by the love of
Rome and the other by the love of home. Pa
triotism consists in action, ar.lmated by a love
of equality.
"The only way the Catholics can improve
their patriotic complexion is by renouncing
the Pope of Home and forswearing forever all
allegiance to any and all foreign princes and
potentate s.
"Some of those Catholics say they love our
country; the Pope says he loves America, and
I believe they and the Pope are honest, ami
that the latter loves it because he would seek
to establish herein tbe future home of the
Catholic hierarchy." [Long Rpplause.j

A OAPTIYE BALLOON.
Some of the Dangers to Which the
Aeronaut Is Exposed.
The principal danger in captive work is
the always present possibility of the wire
rope parting, not because of the obvious
result that the balloon, being set free,
would at once make off at speed, but for
reasons of a very simple technical nature,
albeit none the more pleasant by reason of
their simplicity. It must be understood
that when a captive balloon has been sent
up the required height, the neck of the bal
loon has to be tied up so as to prevent the
wind from exertinc a pressure on the en
velope, and forcing out the gas, which
would result in the balloon very shortly
losing its lifting power and descending. In
free runs the neck must always be wida
open, for otherwise any sudden expansion
of gas might burst the" balloon. Hence, if
a captive breaks away, it is bound to make
an unduly rapid ascent, since it is suddenly
released from the restraint as well as the
weight of the wire rope.
Of course in such an emergency the gas
would at once commence to expand furi
ously, and, unless the neck of the balloon
â were instantly opened and kept open, the
envelope would inevitably burst. In the
shocking accident at the Crystal Palace in
IS'.)2, when poor Dale and his comrades
lost their lives, the balloon was started
with too much lift and commenced to rise
with undue rapidity. Dale, the aeronaut,
realizing the danger, opened the neck and,
in his anxiety to see that it was clear,
looked into it, and it is supposed that hi 3
.head checked the outrush of heated gas,
with the result Jhat the envelope instantly
burst, with terrible results. â Macmillan's

THE MASS-MEETING.
The mass-meeting to be held at Metro- j
| politan Temple this evening on behalf of
j the Armenians conies at an opportune :
I time. The Senate Committee on Foreign i
! Relations had the subject under consid- :
! eration on Saturday and will probably '
| make a report on it during the present
I week. It is said the committee has re- ;
cefcred memorials and petitions from all i
j sections of the Union urging action in the ]
'â  interests of humanity, and it will be well
for the voice of California to be heard with
those of her sister States when the subject j
| comes up for debate and the Senate seeks I
to learn the sentiment of the whole peo
ple.
The recent exhibition of antagonism be
tween the interests of England and Ger
many in South Africa, which for a time 1
threatened to prevent any possible co
operation of European powers in stayinc !
the hand of the Turk and putting an end
to the atrocities which for months past j
have been committed against the Ar- i
menians, has by a sudden turn been '
changed from a seeming evil into what
promises to be a permanent good. Great '
Britain has shown a desire to reach, if not \
an alliance, at least au agreement with j
Russia which will prevent that country
from uniting with Germany in case hostil- j
ities should occur. Any such agreement !
must of course take Turkish affairs into 1
j consideration, and it is opportune there- \
i fore at this time for the voice of the civil- !
! ized world to urge the British Government
j to profit by the occasion to secure for the j
i Armenians those rights and liberties ;
! which are inherent in humanity.
The arrangements that have been made j
for the mass-meeting give assurance that j
the speakers will represent the whole peo- |
pie, without respect to race or creed. In
advocating the cause of humanity it is the
voice of humanity that will speak. The
orators selected to address the meeting ;
are able and eloquent men. They are '
earnest in the work they have undertaken
and will worthily speak the sentiments !
| that all good men feel on this issue. The !
audience should be as truly representative
of our people as are the orators. It should \
be an assembly of those whose influence 1
wakes up the higher life of the people and
infuses public opinion with a true gran- j
deur of sentiment.
There can be no question of the useful
ness of such a meeting or of the urgency
i of a prompt expression of our sympathies
with those whose friends and kindred have
fallen before such a merciless slaughtering :
as that of which all stories from Armenia
i have told. No community of generous
j men and women can afford to be silent
when such outrages affront humanity in
I any portion of the civilized world.
THE PUEBLO KULIEG.
Although the ruling of the Interstate
Commerce Commission on the Puebio case :
was confined to rates betwe^n Puebio and
San Francisco on steel rails anil iron, the
principle involved in the decision is that a
lower rate may not be charged from Chi- '
cago to San Francisco than from Pueblo
to the same point. Obviously the ruling
is not intended to apply to the Atlantic
seaboard, for the reason that there ocean
competition modifies the situation. There
is no reason, however, why the commis- :
sion should nofc. extend its ruling to all
other articles of freight between Chicago :
and San Francisco that might also be sent
to this City from all points west of Chi
cago. Hence the ruling is sufficiently j
revolutionary to alarm the Southern Pa
cific Company and decide it to fight.
It was shown at the hearing of the
Pueblo case and mentioned in the ruling
that it is sometimes to the interest of a
transportation company to haul by a longer
route than it might and at a rate lower
than that charged over an available shorter
route, in order to secure a larger revenue
in the end, and it was incidental^ noted
that the Southern Pacific, acting in such,
fashion, diverts traffic from the Union and
Central Pacific route to the Sunset route
by way of New Orleans. This is taking
cognizance of a practice that has a very
important bearing both on the funding
measure now pending in Congress and the
case of the Southern Pacific Company
against the Railroad Commission of Cali
fornia.
This has been a notorious practice ever
since the Sunset route was opened for
traffic, but iti-sadvancingastep to have the
fact officially noted. It makes the conten-
I tion of the railroad before Judge McKt-nna
!as ridiculous as it is daring. That conten-
I tion is that the reduction in wheat charges
' which the State Rail Toad Commission is
j trying to enforce would cripple the money
j earning capacity of the Central Pacific
j and lessen its ability to discharge its obli
j gations to the Government. While the
i proposed reduction by the Railroad Com-
I mission would affect the Central Pacific
hardly any, the Southern Pacific, by di
verting traffic from the Central Pacific to
the Sunset route, reduces the earning ca
: pacity of its aided line enormously. Yet
an intelligent public is expected gtavely
to listen to such an objection and uncom
plainingly observe the local attorney of
the Government backing the railroad in its
absurd position.
The Pueblo ruling comes at a very op
portune time. If the Southern Pacific re
sists the order it will be Dut on trial, and
I then some interesting things may be
i learned as to how the Central Pacific has
been robbed by its owners, in order that
they might evade payment of the Govern
ment's lien on the road. It is hoped that
l the case will be pushed with all possible
! speed.
A REMEDY EEMAINS.
The unexplained Supreme Court de- I
cision denying the writ of mandate sued i
for by the Valley road against the Trustees
Of the city of Fresno by no means stops i
the progress of this great undertaking.
The directors of the road wanted the Trus- '
tees of Fresno to give a right of way
through the city. The Trustees, uncertain
as to whether the law required them to put
up the desired franchise at auction, went ;
with the directors on an agreed case be
fora the Supreme Court, and that body baa
merely denied the writ asked for compel
ling the Trustees to grant the privilege
without offering it at auction. No reason
is given for the decision and no plan of re- I
lief is suggested.
It will now remain with the Trustees,
not only of Fresno, but of all the other
towns through which the Valley road pro- j
poses to pass, to act intelligently in the in
terest of the public and wholly within the j
law. It has been assumed that the bitter ;
animosity of the Southern Pacific for the
new road will take the form of opposing !
bids for any privilege that may be desired i
by the Valley road, and that in this way
the road may be kept out of the valley.
In case such opposing bids are offered it
will be within the province of the authori- i
ties to determine whether they are offered
in good faith, impose restrictions which I
would makeproceedings in bad faith dan
gerous, and ascertain whether questions of
public right and convenience are involved. !
It would be manifestly absurd and unjust
to recognize a bid for a franchise which \
cannot be desired as part of a plan to run
a railroad through a town.
Bold and overbearing as the Southern
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY" 13, 1896.
Pacific is it realizes that it has as many
enemies at present as it cares to encounter
and we need not expect it to make such a
shameless opposition to the progress of the
new line as is feared. Nor can it be im
agined that there are public officers in the
San Joaquin Valley who could be induced
to lend their power to any such plan should
it be undertaken. The Valley road offers
the first and only hope for that section of
the State, and the people whose homes and
interests are there will not permit it to De
smothered. The decision by the Supreme
Court, therefore, gives no ground for a fear
that the progress of the new road will be
checked.
â¢FIGHTING THE POOLEOOMS.
The directors of the Ingleside racetrack
deserve credit for efforts to aid in the
movement for suppressing the downtown
poolrooms. This is all the more commend
able when it is reflected that those institu
tions are not in conflict with the legiti
mate bookmaking at the track except, per
haps, to the extent of giving the Solid
Eight of the Board of Supervisors an ex
cuse to levy reprisal by moving to sup
press betting at the track if the crusade to
legislate against their downtown proteges
is persisted in.
Mr. Corrigan, one of the Ingleside direc
tors, hit upon the plan of leasing the only
wire running into town that the pool
rooms could use. This virtually put a
stop to the swindling concerns in the City,
but they immediately sought to recover
lost ground by erecting a telegraph line of
their own without permission. They have
bren temporarily balked in that effort, and
' it will be interesting to observe what next
! will happen.
The planting of poles and the stringing
| of a wire was as high-handed a proceeding
I as has ever been witnessed in this City.
[ No permission was sought and none was
granted. The poolroom men who resorted
i to this desperate measure would probably
have had little difficulty in securing per
mission from the Solid Eight, and likely
they felt (secure against punishment for so
| open a violation of the law. We should
I like very much to know why the City ;m
--i thorities did not require the wire and poles
to be taken down.
A natural result of the presence of these
i shameful resorts is seen in the case of the
lad for whom a warrant has been issued
for grand larceny. He was in a good posi
! tion, but the poolrooms ruined him. That
there are hundreds of cases which never
; come to light may be taken for granted.
1 Parents are not likely to prosecute their
j young sons for home thefts with which to
| support the poolrooms.
COAST EXCHANGES.
What can be accomplished by an ener
getic Board of Trade is well illustrated in
the ease of Visalia. The Times of that city,
in a review of the causes which secured so
much prosperity for the community last
year, Bays :
"In the iirst place, we think much of the
good work can be credited to the Visalia
Board of Trade. It was this body that
began the agitation for the Valley Ilail
road about one year ago. At that time it
was not known that the railroad people
could 5e induced to build two linos south
of Fresno and it was a tight between Vi-
Bftlia and Hanford to see which city
could get the road. The Board of Trade
had voluminous statistics collected and
printed showing the resources of the east
side of the valley, and after sending sev
eral committees to the City to confer with
the directors of the Valley road, finally
induced those gentlemen to come to Visa
lia to inspect the country and see for
themselves what they could expect in
the way of freight and passengers if they
adopted the route wliicn we contended
was the best. It was while in Visalia
that Vice-President Watt first suggested
the wisdom of building two lines south
of Fresno, and if Tulare ana Kings coun
ties do all they promised tlie railroad peo
ple they would do, then before the next
wheat crop is ready to move we will have
competition to the Southern Paciric. If
nothing else had been accomplished dur
ing th c past year we would have plenty to
rejoice over."
But that was not all. By sending an ex
hibit to the Atlanta Exposition Tulare
County secured the gold medal for the
best peaches produced in the United States.
Through the efforts of the Board of Trade
the farmers were induced to experiment
with beet-culture, with &o excellent results
that a bect-snuar factory will be built, and
will distribute $500,000 annually among the
people. A great work achieved was the in
corporation of and beginning of work on
the Kaweah Irrigation and Power Com
pany's electric plant, which will mean
manufacturing on a large scale. The erec
tion of a flourinill, and the paving of the
streets were other useful achievements.
That Visalia is determined to throw into
the present year the same energy which
brought so much prosperity in the year
just gone is proved by the efforts which
are now being made to establish a fruit
cannery there. It t-eems somewhat strange
that so necessary and important an enter
prise has not been started betore. The
Visalia Del{a announces that A. D. Cutter
of San Francisco, president of the Cutting
Fruit Packing Company, has made a prop
osition for the establishment of such a
cannery. It contemplates co-operation on
the part of the people, and is now under
consideration.
J. Pentecost, for the past three years
one of the publishers of the Middletown
Independent, has left that paper to accept
the secretaryship of the Alaska Improve
ment Company, and will hereafter live in
San Francisco.
That quicksilver mining in the region
between Mount St. Helena and Clear Lake
is an important industry is seen from this
information published by the Napa Regis
ter: ''Following are the number of Masks
of quicksilver shipped from the various
mines during the month just pagsed, as
reported by the station agent at Calistoga:
Napa Consolidated, 475; -Etna Consoli
dated, 305; Great Western, 255; Mirabel,
â¢235; Sulphur JJanK, G34; total. 1954 Masks,
making an increase of 380 Masks over the
November shipment. The total shipment
for the year just ended amounted to 1,771 ,
-400 pounds, against 1,617,500 pounds for
1894."
A proposition has been made to the San
Jose Board of Trade by \V. S. Boody of
Philadelphia to build a glass works in San
Jose if a tract, of land of about half an acre
with railroad facilities were given the com
pany. He and his associates would put
$6000 to |10,000 in the plant and felt sure
of success. The cheaper products would
be at lirst made and later finer goods
would be turned out. The work 3 would
employ from seventy to one hundred peo
ple, which would be increased to live hun
dred in three years.
This proposition met with such favor
that a committee was appointed to secure
the site needed.
Having disposed of the Lodi Sentinel,
Ruggles & Bueck are to begin the publica

Says the San Jose News: F. TV. Cran
dail, one of the California Dried-fruit
Commissioners, has written to the San
Jose Board of Trade acknowledging the
receipt of a lot of cooking fruit. He says a
gold medal has been promised to "William
"Warren for a box of prunes sent. He is
anxious to attend the Nashville Exposi
tion, where he thinks he can accomplish
much good. His letter concludes: "My
demonstration here has caused the sale of
tons of California dried fruit, and in many
cases to parties who have never used it be
fore. Add to this the thousands from
abroad who sampled it here and who will
take the little books home with them and
will buy ana use it when they want fruit."

The Los Angeles Journal gives full in
formation of the extensive water worts
which are being constructed on the south
side of Antelope Valley, near Palmdale,
by the South Antelope Valley Irrigation
Company, a corporation backed by Los
Angeles and Eastern capital. "The com
pany," says the Journal, "owns a large
body of land in the vicinity of Palmdale as
well as the irrigation system that has fur
nished the South Antelope country with
water during the past ten years. In order
to increase the present supply and provide
for future requirements, the company is
building a large ditch from their head
works on Little Rock Creek to the dry lake
west of Harold station on the Southern
Pacihc Railroad. This lake covers an area
five miles in circumference, and can be
flooded to a depth of fifty feet. Occupy
ing an elevated position overlooking An
telope Valley, it forms a perfect storage
reservoir, and when utilized will be the
means of reclaiming 30,000 acres of Los
Anseles County lands now practically
valueless." The ditch from Little Rock
Creek is eight miles long and will carry
10,000 miners' inches.
The Hen Man is the title of a new paper

The Redding Free Press publishes an
ably written array of the resources and re
cent progress of Shasta Count} 1 . "The
county," says our contemporary, "is enter
ins upon an epoch of development that is
destined to make her one of the foremost
counties in the State. Her mines are
proving to be bullion producers second to
none on the coast, and .their magnitude
and intrinsic worth are bringing in new
capital every day, whose magic touch is
opening up splendid-payiner properties on
every hand and giving an impulse to busi
ness in general unparalleled in the his
tory of the county. Our vast stores of iron
ore and building stone, unlimited in quan
tity and unequaled in quality, only await
cheap transportation facilities to add an
other source of wealth. Our lumber in
terests are already a great source of income
and give employment to a large num
ber of operatives, which makes a market
for large quantities of the productions of
our farmers. The fruit interests of Shasta
County are becoming a very important
factor in our production"!, and are increas
vcry rapidly. We have thousands of acres
of the finest fruit lands on earth that only
await the advent of a comprehensive sys
tem of irrigation to make them pro
ductive. There are several schemes on
foot looking to the inauguration of irriga
tion on an extensive scale. There is an
abundance of water in all parts of the
county that only requires to be applied in
a systematic manner to the lands to irri
gate the whole tillable surface of the
county and make it blossom as a garden,
besides furnishing unlimited electrical
power."
The Bakersfield Californian announces
the practical completion of the new bridge
across Kern River built by tho Power De
velopment Coin pan}*, and says that Man
ager C. X. Beal has come to San Francisco
for the purpose of letting contracts for the
installation of the plant. It will take
about four months to make the necessary
machinery and about two months to put >t
in place. Some time along about the mid
dle of next summer, therefore, we may ex
pect to see this important and greatly de
sired improvement ready for active opera
tion.
The anniversary number of the Los An

The Fresno Republican furnishes inter
esting details of the incorporation of the
Kings River Electric Power Company, al
ready noticed in these columns. The cap
ital stock is $360,000, all of which has been
subscribed, as follows: S. P. Earl of Keed
ley, ?W),000; J. S. Jones of Eeedley, $60,
--000; James Sibley of Dinuba, $(50,000;
Charles G. Wilcox of Yisalia, $y0,000; Wil
liam H. Hammona of Visalia. $ I X>,OOO.
The main purposes of the company are to
izcnerate and sell electrical energy and
operate an electric road. The works will
be established on Kings River at a point
east of fc-anger. A rower of 4000 horses
will be secured, and the neighboring towns
will be furnished with light and power.
Another useful purpose is indicated by
the Sanger Herald, which says that the
company contemplates pumping water to
be used in irrigating lands near the hills
too eievated to be reached by gravity
canals. These lands are as fertile as any
in this valley, and if the cost of lifting
water is not too great there is no reason
why much profit might not be derived
from that source. They are in the thermal
belt, and the new interest which has been
aroused in citrus fruits may lead to the
planting of orange and lemon orchards
near the base of the hills. The water to
irrigate them may be pumped by elec
tricity.
C. B. Whiting announces that hereafter
he, assisted by his two sons, will confduct
the Colusa Herald on lines of his own.
Wonderful strides are being made in the
conversion into electrical energy of the
waier power now going to waste in the
mountains. The Merced Star says: "H.
H. Clark, general manager of the Horse
shoe Bend vineyard, has completed
arrangements for the formation of a com
pany to be known as the Uend Power
Company to generate electric power from
the Merced River at a point about four
miles from Coulterville and the same
distance from the rich mines of Hunter's
Valley. The establishment of such a con
cern selling power at $3 per horse power
per mouth will revolutionize quartz min
ing in the district and inaugurate a
period of profitable, substantial and per
manent industry greater than could be
lookea for from the operations of several
gold mining companies each as large as
the Coulterville corporation." The new

The Matin Jourtial, published at San
Rafael, commends the value and excel
lence of the wagon road which San Quen
tin convicts are constructing from San
Rafael to Tiburon. Our contemporary
says: "A Journal reporter last week
visited the scene of operations near Green
brae. Work at present is confined to cut
ting through two hills, the largest requir
ing a cut of 500 feet long by about thirty
deep, through solid rock. When it is re
membered that the road is to be forty feet
wide, it will be seen what an immense
amount of work is involved in the two
cuts. The rock and dirt removed from the
hills will be used in filling in a marsh, one
and a half miles wide, a few rods south
west of the station. The benefits of a good
road from San Rafael to Tiburon are in
calculable. Passing through romantic
scenery, where there are many fine build
ing sites, it will enhance land values and
enable our merchants to ship their goods
direct from Tiburon, thus adding to the
importance of the county seat. The only
expense of the road to Marin will be the
cost of Mr. Cclwell's supervision, the blast
ing powder and a little drill steel."

UTAH'S STAR,
The most important requirements In the ad
mission of Utah have been fulfilled, and what :
remain are but the usual formalities. The last j
of these will be an official order for the army
and navy declaring the addition of another
star to the Union. This will take effect on
the Fourth of July next, says the New York
World. #
Of course all the new flags that are issued by I
the Government after that date will boar the
full complement of forty-five stars, but many
of the old flags will continue to float in the
breezes with only the present number of stars,
an;l without any people beine: the wiser.
The Government is iar too economical to call
in all of its old flags and have them changed
whenever there is an addition to the sister- â 
THE FORTY â¢ FIFTH STAR ADDED TO OUR FLAG.
hood of States. The old flags are changed ac
cording to the will or leisure of the men in
charge'of them.
The official arrangement of the stars end of
the stripes of Old Glory is an important mat
ter, which is in charge of a special board of
army and navy ollicers. While it has not yet
been officially decided, it is more than pio'r,
able that the "new star will occupy the blank
space which now exists in the I'nion in the
fifth row from the top nearest the flagstaff.
This addition will make the appearance of the
Union even more symmetrical than it is at
present.
There are now six rows of stars in the Union,
the top and bottom rows being each composed
of eight stars and the other four of seven stars
each. Utah's stnr will make eight in the fifth
row and will be the first in the row next the
staff.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
POPULIST FUNDAMENTALS.
ADOPTED BY THE NATION AS THE BASIS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.
To the Editor of The. CaOâ Sib: "3y all, for all" '
is the first axiom in the science of government ;
as I'opulif ts understand the purposes of gov- |
ernment. Their ruler is the legally expressed !
voice of the people. They have no other king, 'â 
emperor or kaiser. "We, the people, do or- â¢
Uain," is the Populist formula. With the
founders of the Nation, Populists hold that the
sole purpose of instituting a government is to
secure the safety and happiness of the people,
nnd that its sole authority is derived from the i
consent of the governed, not from the will of a
king or of a plutocracy. They Mand as Liu
coin stood, for "a government of the people, '.
by the people, for the people."
Populists hold that whatsoever concerns all
Citizens alike in National, State or municipal â 
governmentâ as, for example, the proper edu- j
cation of the people for the safe exercise of the ;
elective franchise, the carrying of the mail, j
the raising of revenues for the support of the i
Government, the erection of suitable buildings '
for public use, the choice of those who are to
govern or to enforce the laws, and the like
public needsâ shall be done by the whole body
of the people under the fundamental law, "By
rll for all." SoPnliÃta liml as a fact tlmt until
within the last thirty years of our National
history this fundamental law was fairly well
observed and recognized in the management
of public affairs, in the enactment of statutory
law and the exercise oi the powers conferred
upon Government by the people. But Popu
lists claim that within recent years a gigantic
power has arisen, known as the corporation,
which overrides the rights of the citizen, aud
that it is the express purpose of the People's
party to restore to the Government the func
tions which have been unwisely and corruptly
bestowed upon corporate associations of men,
who exercise these functions of Government to
the undue enrichment of themselves and the
impoverishment aud oppression of the people
as a whole.
Let us now put to the test the axiom "By oil
for all," The Populist declaration of principles
as set out in their Nationnl platform at Omaha.
They contend for three great issues, namely, a
national money, the Government or people's
ownership of the railroads ana telegraphs" and
the restriction of ownership in land by cor
porations and aliens. The first contention, for
a national money to be issued by the Govern
ment only, and to be a full leeal tender for all j
debts, meets the requirements of the axiom, ,
for it is to be issued by all ior all. on equal j
terms to all citizens, thereby depriving bank- I
Ing corporations of their exclusive privilege of |
obtaining- money from the Government at 1
per cent, to be loaned by them at such rates oi
interest as the exigencies of borrowers may
force them to pay, ranging from 5 to 15 per
cent. This is in accord with the rule, lor it
deals with exact justice by all and grants spe- â 
cml privileges to none.
The second contention, that the Government
shall own and operate the railroads and tele
graphs in the interest of all the people, is like- j
nist? in accord with the rule, for if any profit
is charged above the cost of operation it will i
go into the treasury of the Nation and thereby '
reduce the expenses of the Government; or if i
operated at cost it will Iciivp the millions here- j
tofore collected by the railroad and telegraph j
magnates in the hands of the people, and jus
tice will be meted out to all the inhabitants
alike.
The third contention, that "the land is the
inheritance of the people," and may not be
monopolized and held in large areas from the
use and occupation of the people, accords with
the rule, for if land may of right be monopo
lized, it is only a question" of time, and not of a
dim and distant period, when all the land will
pass into posesssion of a few billionaire corpora
tions, auci '-the inheritance of the people" will
be the perpetual serfdom of a tenant peas
r.ntry, toiling in ignorance and squalor for the
ruth less and soulless corporations which "own"
the land.
It has been the glory of the Republican party
that it opened the public lauds to the poor as
"homesteads"â the free gift of the Government
of 100 acres to each head of a family. That
party must certainly be in sympathy with the
People's party on the land questionâ a ques
tion of the most serious moment to the Nation
if this is to remain "the land of the free and
the home of tiio brave."
I close with the suggestion that the President
and the Congress, the Governors and Legisla
tures, the Mayors and Councilmen, the Judges
and juries, as well as the county roads and city
slreois, the State and City public libraries, the
asylums and the prisons, are only so many
illustrations: of the practical application of the
Populist axiom, "By All for All," which must
soon include streetcar linos, gas and electric
lighting plants, water works, a free public
market, and Mich like things needed for pro
moting the general welfare, the benefit, saietv
and haopiness of the people.

shape of a woman burglar and the police
have Deen vainly trying 9ince Thursday to
find out her identity.
On Thursday afternoon, about 2 o'clock,
an unsuccessful attempt was made to
break into the residence of J. Carroii, 113
Guerrero "street, while the family were
downtown. A lady livine at 120 Guerrero
street, at th^ hour mentioned, saw a younc
man ring the doorbell several times and
then go around to the rear of the house.
She saw another younÂ«; man standing; on
the sidewalk apparently on the lookout,
while a well-dressed young woman stood
on tbe opposite side of the street, about
sixty feet away, evidently also on the look
out.
The lady at 120 became suspicious and
she notified the policeman on the beat.
When he reached the house the young
man in the rear had joined the one in front
and when tbe nthcer asked for an explana
tion they said they were newspapermen
and wanted to interview Mr. Carroll. As
the officer had nothinc tangible against
them be let them go. When they walked
away they were joined by the young
woman.
Aft.T the Carroll family had returned
and their neighbor bad told them what
had occurred an investigation showed that
an attempt bad been made to force open a
window in the rear. The police have a
good ription of the two young men
Â»ii the woman and expect to have them
under arrest EOOQ.

Archbishop Riordan's Title
in the Catholic Hier

HIS BRILLIANT CAREER.
He Won Laurels as a Student

and Prelate.
WORKS FOR GOD AND HUMANITY
An Eloquent Discourse on the Chris
tian Home and Family-
Unity.
Archbishop Riordan is a magnetic per
son. When in action in the pulpit you
readily pronounce Dim a master of the art
of speech and a sage in thought. He is an
MOST REVEREND P. W. RIORDAN, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN FRANCISCO.
etched from life yesterday by a ''Call" adhl.-"
orator of orator?, a preacher of preachers,
! a thinker of thinkers, at once combining
all the essentials of a great man and a
great churchman.
An archbishop is a prince of the Roman
Catholic Chu-ch. Therefore he is usually
addressed as his Grace. This custom of
! addressing a prelate is religiously adhered
i to in old Catholic countries, rich in the
splendor of Catholic tradition, but in the
American church it has come to be re
garded as prouer and dignilied to salute a
dignitary of the hierarchy simply by his
title of Archbishop or Bishop, as the occa
sion may require.
Archbishop Riordan is not the man to
! quarrel with you over mere t.tles. While
he is a man of marked dignity, as becomes
his great office, he soon makfs the inter
viewer or visitor at home by his kind
words and centle assurances. His respon
sibilities are stupendous. He is a hard
worker, a;;d, with an efficient and able
staff nf priests, he struggles along day
after day building churches, temples of
learning and homes for the orphans, the
helpless and the poor. The new seminary
which the Archbishop is now building at
Menlo Park, and which will be opened
very shortly, will be unsurpassed by any
other institution of learning in the West.
Archbishop Riordan passed his youth in
a seminary at Chicago. Then he went to
Rome and entered the American College.
This was in 1859. There he spent a year
in study and another year in Paris. Then
he entered the far-famed University of
Louvain, in Belgium. While abroad the
young student acquired a thorough knowl
edge of French, Italian, German and
Flemish. In all these languages the Arch-
I bishop can converse quite freely. His
j career as a student was brilliant. He was
ordained In the cathedral at Malines, Bel
gium, in 1865. Later he took the degree of
licentiate of theology.
On returning to America in 18C6 the
young priest was made professor of dog
; inatic theology and holy scripture in St.
Mary's Seminary, Chicago. In 1868 he
was appointed recior of St. Mary's Church,
Woodstock, and later of St. Mary's Church,
; .loliet. In 1871 he was appointed to the
I important pastorate ol St. James Church,
> Chicago. H- re he remained until appoint
ed coadjutor to the late Archbishop
Alemany with the right of succession.
The Archbishop's life in San Francisco
has been distinguished by the same bril
! liunt achievement that marked his career
I as a student abroad and a priest at home.
; The new cathedral on Van Ness avenue is
| an exemplification of his energy and Chris
tian zeal His labors have extended out
) into ninny worthy channels. He builds
i hospitals for the sick, homes for the poor
] aixt asylums foi the orphans.
The "Archbishop's sermon yesterday was
from the gospel of the day, LuKe 11:42-62,
| as follows:
And when twelve years old they went up to
Jerusalem, according to the custom of tlie
feast; and having fuliilted tlie days when 'hey
returned, the child Jesus reimiined in Jerusa
lem, and his parents tnewitnot. And think
ing he was in the company they came a day's
journey, and SOUftbt him umong their kinsfolk
and acquaintances. And not finding him
they returned unto Jerusalem, seeking him.
*nd it came to pass thai after three days they
found him in the temple Bitting in the midst of
the doctors hearing them, and asking them
questions. Ana nil I hat heard him were as
tonished Â«t his wisdom Â«nd his axuwera, And
seeing him they wondered. And his mother
haid to him: Son, wiiy hast ihou done so to us?
Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sor
rowing. And he said to them : How is it that
you sought, me? I>id you not know that I must
be about my father's ousiness? An 1 they un
derstood not the word ne spoke unto them.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 1896.
And he -went down with them end came to
Nazareth, ami was subject to them. And his
mother kept all these words in her heart. And
Jesus advanced in wisdom and age and grace
with God and man.
In the course of his discourse, which
was delivered in that musical voice pecu
liar to tne speaker, the Archbishop said:
If you read carefully these singular words of
the Lord you will readily comprehend that he
came on earth to teach divine truth, to build
up the spiritual life, to establish the kingdom
of God in the hearts oi men. After leaving
Jerusalem at the age of 12 years he went with
nil i parents to Nazareth, where he lived a poor
and uneventful life for 18 years. What was
his reason for this? Why did he obscure him- |
self in this little Syrian town? All this was
none lor a great purpose. All the works of
God are done silently. Plants grow quietly by
uÂ»y and night; light pours noiselessly down
to illumine the planet; al! the great works of
nature are done in silence. And so the Lord re
mains in ob-rturity for eighteen years, grow
ing, developing, maturing iv silence, working
quietly in his father's carpenter-shop, living
in peace and love with Mary and Joseph, the
model Christian family.
Society is built on the iamily. Here we have
social union. Here religion must begin. Here
purity and virtue are nursed. In ancient times
the family did not exist as we see it to-day.
We do not find in the old the unity, dignity
and sanctity of the new. More is done for God
by the Christian family than is accomplished
by preaching the gospel. In the family of our
blessed Lord" we have the pattern family. Here
we have Joseph presiding over it and Mary,
the mother, and our Lord subject to it. Here
we see the growth of the child under the
mother. The life of the Lord was a peaceful,
natural development âan uninterrupted
growth from youth to perfect manhood.
How does this life compare with that of the
youth of our time? Our children take their
stand with their elders in tiie drawing-room
ana in the temple of amusement. Their whole
young life is dissipated. Our girls and boys
cense their intellectual growth at 18 years of
age and make their debut in the social world.
This is all wrong. It checks the development
of the religious, intellectual and physical life.
How differently the farmers treat their young
plants. How careful they are the tender root
j should not be disturbed; how careful they are
I that a breath should notldUturb them;"how
i they arc blessed frith the treasures of air and
; sunlight, and thus when the harvest is gath
i ered in the plant is found to be sturdy and
1 strong. On the other hand, had he rooted
1 them up from time to time they would have
I withered and finally died.
And so we have un important lesson on the !
gospel of t i-day, showing the Eternal Bon
going down to an obscure v liage and there
gro ing and developing physically, intellect
ually and morally.
.T t.^oj.li and Mary, though having a com
petence, were obliged to work for a living.
They belonged to the laboring class. Our
hies eel Lord says that c worked in the shop
j of his father, who was v carpenter. What rto
\vi- derive tro a th s lesson? It testifies to the
fm't that God iiitendrd that we should work.
j l.nbor is an emancipated condition of life. It
I belongs to the .substantial condition of human
nature. Our lives are wholesome and pure in
activity; they are foul and loathsome when
inactive. We were brought into the world to
j work. 'In the sweat of thy lace earn thy
bread.' Wort in ancient times was looked
1 upon ns a condition of slavery. One of the
1 great curses of this country was'the slavery in
; the South. It taucht men to believe that work
j was degrading. Guam against rejecting work ; ,'
: it shows a tendency of human nature back to
| paganism. That work is nobie is another
; beautiful lesson in to-day's gospel.
Our Lord came Into the world to save all;
1 to bring all to a knowledge of God. The great
j are few; tne learned are few; the rich are few.
i What is' our highest talent comparer! to the in
j linite wisdom of God? Knowledge is only a
' means to an end. Kiches are perishable.
! There were two classes among the pagans, the
â  rich and the poor. The Lord came to do away
. with all this. So wo never should lose courage
:on account of our condition in life. i 7 ou who
i struggle from day to day should feel encour
! aged for you are building up in your souls the
i kingdom of eiernal life.
Give your children an opportunity to de
-1 yelop both physically, intellectually and spir
: itually. Keep the girl a girl until she becomes
| a woman; tho boy a boy until he becomes a
; man. Train them carefully nnd in silence,
and when their minds are matured and their
'â  souls strong let them take their places among
I the people of the world. Teach them to work.
i for labor belongs to the constituted elements
;of life. It is noble and dignified. This world
iis God's workshop. Wo must work for our
; God. for our country and for religion.
The Archbishop drew a beautiful pic
ture of the home iife of the family of the
j Lord in Nazareth, and exhorted his hear
; ers to pattern after it in their domestic
I relations. The example had been handed
: down the ages and should be followed by
â¢ all true Christians. In conclusion he said :
"The Christian family is the family of
â  the Nation, giving to the nation pure
i women and strong, brave men; where
reverence of law is found; where purity of
| speech is heard; where peace reigns."
The Archbishop scored the divorce laws
â  and declared them an ins'rument with
which deadly blows were dealt against the
; Christian family.
THROWN FROM A CART.
Kunaway Accident on the Ocean Boule- |
yard.
Yesterday afternoon Peter Burns, who !
lives on the Ban Bruno road near the
Golden City House, in company with a
friend, was riding in a two-horse cart
along the great highway opposite the
"Carville" when the animal lie was driv
ing became frightened at a train of the
Park and Ocean line as it was rounding I
the curve. The animal reared, kicked the
dashboard into bits and started off at a
terrific rate.
Burns fell out of the cart, but the other
man caught the reins and succeeded in!
turning the infuriated animal into the ;
brush, but in doing so he, too, was thrown
from the cart.
He escaped uninjured, but Burns sus
tained a severe scalp wound and injuries
to his left shoulder. His wound was tem
porarily dressed by a citizen and he was
placed on the cars and sent to his home.
| The runaway iiorse was caught a short dis
| tance from the scene of the accident.

A POOR CATCH ANTICIPATED.
The Captain of the Schooner Perry in
Trouble With Wharfinger
Dryden.
The foggy weather kept everybody away
from the wdter front yesterday, and in
consequence the tenders that ran between
the cruiser Boston and Folsom and Clay
street wharves did very Jittle business.
The Ethel and Marion from Clay street did
fairly well, but still the men who char
tered her did not pay expenses. At Fol
som-street wharf Henry Peterson, in the
launch Aiuy, did nearly all the business,
while the Millie did not earn enough to
pay her coal biil.
The only vessels that attracted any at
tention, outside of the excursion bouts were
the Edward O'Brien and Kenilworth.
Both are American vessels, and the spick
and span appearance of both attracted the
attention of the people who visited the
waterfront. The O'Brien is at Howard 2
and the Kenilworth at Harrison-street
wharf. Mate Oliver of the O'Brien has not

heard the last of his trouble with the chief I
wharfinger.* He is liable, to a fine of $100
and 300 in the County Jail for refus- j
ing to move his ship when ordered, and as
the Harbor Commissioners intend to make
an example of him the legal battle is likely ,
to be a lively one.
The" Kenilworth was originally a British, j
ship, but during the fire that destroyed
the Port Costa grainsheds she was caught
in the blaze and burnt to the water's edge. j
She was rebuilt, placed under the Ameri- i
can ilag, and ever since has been trading
between San Francisco and European
ports. On this occasion she comes from
New York with a cargo of general mer
chanchise.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Pern goes on Hunters Point drydock this
morning. The stevedores have done very
quick work on her. as she only arrived last
Saturday, and during the intervening time
nearly 200 tons of cargo was discharged.
The men worked on her all Saturday
night, and succeeded in getting the vessel j
cleared.
The ship Rofaa E. Wood will go on the j
Merchants' drydock to-day to have her
fore foot repaired. Some time ago she
went ashore ana her stem was damaged by
the rocks. The hull is not injured to any
material extent, and a couple of days' j
work will make the wood as good as new. !
About the last of the sealers will get j
away this week. The fleet will be a very i
small one, as a gr<?;it many schooners will
remain in Oakland Creek in the hopes
that better times will come around. The !
Rattler made a successful trip last year, !
and she will tempt fortune again this sea- j
son. Captain Nelson will take her out.
On the 20th inst. the Mattie T. Dyer will |
go out n. charge of Captain Moeckler, and !
she will be about the last of the fleet to ;
sail.
All steamer 3 that arrive from foreign !
ports are now inspected by the United i
States quarantine officers. Dr. Bleu of the
United States Marine Hospital goes out to I
all vessels from China, Japan, Australia
and the South Sea Islands on the Govern- ',
ment tug and passes upon all the immi- i
grants. All the Chinese on the Peru were j
examined by both Dr. Chalmers, the State j
Quarantine Officer, and Dr. Bleu, bo it is a !
certainty that there was no contagion on j
that steamer.
Captain Schroeder of the schooner S. E. [
Perry and Wharfinger Dryden at Main- j
\ street wharf will have a passage at arms
to-day. Without permission Schroeder i
docked his vessel at Main street yesterday !
and began unloading a cargo of barrel- !
staves. Dryden stopped him anu said the I
schooner would have to be moved, as the '
revenue cutters Bear, Rush and Perry were j
to dock at tne wharf this morning. j
Schroeder. told the wharfinger in so many I
words that he intended to stay where he i
was, and no Harbor Commissioner nor !
anybody else would make him move. The
controversy will be settled to-day, and if ;
Captain Schroeder does not move his |
schooner tire chances are that he will find |
himself in jail.
The steamer Santa Rosa arrived from
southern ports yesterday. She brought j
"very little cargo and only about sixty cabin
passengers.
The Stockton steamers are to have a â¢
direct entrance from the wiiarves to the
upper deck. New gangways are being !
built and a portion of the sheds at Clay j
and Washington street wharves are being I
taken out in order to make room for them, i
With this improvement the steamers can
discharge and load cargo without any
danger to passengers.
AT THE THEATERS.
Tragedy, Melodrama, Comedy, Opera
and Vaudeville This Evening.
At the California Theater this evening
Louis James will present for the first time
in San Francisco, "Marmion," and he will
appear in the title role. This play was
dramatized especially for Mr. James by
Percy Sage, and is founded on the story of
Lord Marmion, Constance de Beverly and
Lady Jane Clare, immortalized in verse by
Sir Walter Scott.
Miss Marie Wainwright is to appear this
evening at the Baldwin in that sterling
comedy written by Knowles in 1837, ''The
Love Chase," assuming the character of
Constance. The role of Sir William Fond
love, the vain old baronet, who imagines
himself as spry as a youth of twenty, will
be tilled by Barton Hill. It is a good
comedy when well played.
This evening the Frawley Company is to
present that well-known comedy, "The
Senator," of which "NY . H. Crane made such
a success when he first produced it in this
City. The leading members of the Frawley
Company in the principal parts are saia
to have given a representation equal to
that given by Crane and his company.
"My Precious Baby" has proved such a
success at Grover's Alcazar that the man
agement has decided to continue it to
night and every night during the week.
The amusing dialogue, the funny situa
tions and the humor that runs through
the entire comedy are calculated to, and
do, keep the audience in a roar from rise
to fall of curtain.
Sedley Brown's pastoral comedy is to be
offered at the Grand Opera this evening.
It is entitled "A Long Lane," and is a
stage story of modern American life. The
several tableaux will be presented with
Striking effect. A novel scene will be the
one showing sheep-washers at work in a
large tank.
"Ixion, The Man at the Wheel," will
continue on the boards at the Tivoli Opera
house to-night, and for that, for the bal
ance of the week and perhaps longer; the
demand to witness this performance is so
great that the management is at a loss to
know when to take it off. The singing
and the dialogue meet the popular taste.
The vaudeville programme to be pre
sented at the Orpheum Music Hall this
evening is made up of many specialties
that are sure to draw a crowded house.
Among those whose names are on the bill
are William Roberts, reported to be th
c
greatest of American equilibrists, and Gil
more and Leonard, versatile Irish come
dians.
TROUBLED TELEGRAPHERS
Racing Returns Leaked, and Chief
Operator McÃobie Was
Discharged.
No One Put Up the Wire Near the
Ingleside Track and No One
Tore It Down.
"When the secret wire of the downtown
pool-sellers came down Saturday afternoon
there was quite a hubbub in telegraphic
circles. One of the operators of the grape
vine company was a man named Patter
son, a former operator of the Western
Union Company. It is said, though, that
he was not the only employe of that com
pany who was active in the interests of the
pool-sellers.
The story that there has been a leak
from the big building on Pine street has
been given great emphasis by the dis
charge of John McÃobie, who for a long
time has been manager of the operating
room.
Just how inside information at tbe track
got out no one seems to know. But it got
out, and frequently large sums were drawn
down from the poolrooms by men who had
information that was definite as to win
ners. They got it somewhere and it came
by the Western TJnion wires.
From this point stories vary. No one
says directly that Mr. McÃobie gave out
returns. In fact it is not known that Mr.
McÃobie gave out returns. But news of
the races was given out and Mr. McÃobie
was discharged.
Jerry DriscoU, the head of the down
town pool-sellers, said that the matter of
the wire used and pulled down was none
of his affair.
"My business is placing pools on com
mission, not putting up telegraph lines,"
Ihe said. "We buy our service from the
i track from the Postal Company. That's
j all I know. How they get it in is none of
jmy business. I don't know who put up
! the wire that was taken down. It was not
I the pool-sellers."
Mr. Driscoll said he did not know how
'â  he was going to get returns speedily to
day. But he looked cheery while he said
it and went on his way busily.
Mr. Corrigan of the Pacific Coast Jockey
; Club doesn't know how Mr. Driscoll is to
i cet information from the Ingleside track
| either. He said they would not have tele
graph or telephone service, though. He
knew as little about who took down the
wild wire on Saturday afternoon as did
Captain Cullundan.
"I don't see as it matters much, though,"
he added. "Mr. Driscoll pays his people
i don't own the wire. Mr. Storror says the
i Postal people don't own the wire; and so,
| for the life of me, I can't see that there is
i any one who has been injured."

LIFE AT THE PRESIDIO.
The Daily Routine of Instruc
tion Has Been Re
sumed.
LODGE OF PYTHIAN KNIGHTS.
Official Boards Appointed â The Sa
gacity of Pet Animals on the
Reservation.
The soldiers at the Presidio had a season
of respite from active duty in drilling from j
December 20 until January 10. The
vacation ended on the latter date and
daily instruction was then resumed.
The business of the canteen at the Pre
sidio for the six months ended December |
31 last was very good. The receipts were |
not quite up to the mark of the first six |
months of 1895, which is easily accounted '
for by the fact that two troops of cavalry j
were away from the post during the sum- !
mer and autumn guarding United States
reservations in the Sierra. The light ar
tillery batteries were also awpy on practice
marches for some time, hence the number
of men at the garrison was diminished. I
The canteen system is regarded now as an j
established success.
A board of officers has been convened at
the Presidio for the purpose of considering
schemes of instruction for batteries of
heavy artillery. The schemes were sub
mitted by the "commanding officers of the
Presidio, Alcatraz Island and Fort Mason.
The board consists of Captain H. J. Reilly, |
First Lieutenant 0. E. Wood and First I
Lieutenant W. H. Coffin, all of the Fiftn
Artillery.
A board consisting of the following
named officers has been convened for the
purpose of devising a scheme of instruc
tion in detail for light artillery: Captain
Morris, Captain Frank Thorp and Second
Lieutenant G. G. Gatley, all of the Fifth
Artillery.
Lieutenant-Colonel Francis L. Guenther,
Fifth Artillery, has been appointed ar
tillery inspector, Department ot California.
The appointment, made by General For- i
syth, is subject to the approval of the
major-general commanding the army.
It is expected by the friends of ColGnel j
Charles G. Sawtelle, assistant quartermas- j
ter-general, that he will be appointed j
quartermaster-general to succeed General |
11. N. Batchelder, who retires July 127 of I
this year. The only agreeable thought of
General Batchelder's retirement is the
reflection that he will have time to visit
San Francisco. He was stationed at this
post many years, but has not been here
since his promotion to the nead of tha
quartermaster department.
Miss Overton of Los Angeles, dauchter
of Captain Overton, Sixth Cavalry (re
tired), is visiting at the home of Colonel
and Mrs. Kirn ball, on Pacific avenue, near
the Presidio.
Lieutenant Stockle, Tentn Cavalry;
Lieutenant Littebrant, Tenth Cavalry,
and Lieutenant Schoiield, Fourth Cavalry,
son of Lieutenant-General Schorield, are in
San Francisco for examination before the
board for promotion.
Lieutenant U. E. Hunt, Fourteenth In
fantry. Vancouver Barracks, was at the
Presidio last week. He obtained leave of
absence for his wedding trip.
Lieutenant Adams has been appointed
post quartermaster at the Presidio, taking
the place of Captain Sawyer, who was re
cently ordered to Buffalo, N. Y.
A lodge of the Knights of Pythias con
sisting of seventy-live excellent members
has been recruited at the Presidio. It will
be known as Mars Lodge, and will be
organized in due form at Pythian Castle at
7:30 o'clock to-morrow evening.
Soldiers at the Presidio who read in The
Call an account of the sagacity of Colonel
Graham's doj, assert that for canine intel
ligence the commanding officer's dog is
not of high rank. The dog "Smiler," be
longing to Troop X, Fourth Cavalry, is
said to be the most knowing specimen of
the canine tribe on the reservation. At
the first call in the morning "Smiler" is
up at one bound and instantly rushes to
every member of the troop to arouse the
sleepy soldiers. "Smiler" is a large dog
of the shepherd strain.
A cat of Battery H, Fifth Artillery, is
one of the pets of the post. He makes it a
auty to spring on every dog that comes
along, and all dogs, big and little, stand in
dread of the feline guardian of the battery.
The cat doe 3 not snow anger in attacking
dogs. His hair does not go up and neither
does his spine curve as a signal for attack,
but when he sees a dog coming he coolly
leaves his place on the porch at the bar
racks, crouches in the grass and springs on
his canine prey with sudden precision.
The private of Battery A who recently
made a pass at his corporal with a sword
bayonet has been tried by a court-martial,
and his sentence will be made known this
week. Men of the battery who refused to
assist the corporal have had a hearing.
One man wjio cheered the corporal's as
sailant will probably be punished.
THE LOUBAT PRIZES.
Offered to Students and Literary Work
ers of All Countries.
The president of Columbia College of I
the city of New York has just issued a cir
cular-letter which will prove of interest to
students and litorarv workers. A copy re
ceived in this City on Saturday sets forth
that the Loubat prizes are offered for com
petition. One is a prize of not less than
$1000 and the other not less than $400, of
fered to the authors of the best works on
the history, geography, archeology, eth
nology, philology or numismatics of North
America. The competition for these
prizes is open to all persons, whether citi
zens of the United States or any other
country. The prizes are to be awajdea in
1898, and every fifth year thereafter.
For the purpose of the award the sub
jects named are to be divided into two
groups, in which the award is to be made

BOARD OF TRADE EXHIBIT.
William H. Mills Now Comes
to the Front in Its
Defense.
WHAT IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED.
He Believes That It Is a Great Factor
in Advancing the Prosperity of
the State.
To the Editor of the Fan Francisco Callâ Sir: I
be? through your courtesy to i bit> to a question
of privilege. |
The city of Philadelphia maintains a com
mercial museum, iv which i- exhibited all the
objects of iltnre, all articles of manufacture
Hiui all the native or raw material from which
manufa urea forms are made. Philadelphia.
claims to be a commercial emporium. Etspeo
ple are. lently aware of the tact that cities
exist by reason of the commerce generated by
the industrial activity In the territory tribu
tary to them.
Recently tlie manager of the commercial
museum of Philadelphia applied to J. A.
Filcher, who is now In charge of the State
Board of Trade's shibit at Atlanta, for contri
butions to his commercial museum. The mat
ter \v: presented in a communication from
Mr. Richer at the la*t meeting of the board,
and instructions were given to furnish this
Philadelphia niu*eura with everything in the
way of duplicates and to supply it to any ex
ton: that would not impoverish the exhibit at
Atlanta.
Philadelphia was nor onl; willing to pro
mote the growth of California by making an
exhibit of its products without cost to the
State, but has established and maintained a
museum for the exhibition of. all of the articles
â¢which are subject of commercial tctioD.
There is a i andeur of breadiii in th!s concep
tion commensurate /with the claim of the.city
of Philadelphia to be a great emporium of
commerce.
The existence of this great jnuseum of com
merce wrs thr genesis of the suggestion that
such a museum >uld be maintained in Ran
Francisco upon the theory that San Francisco
is the commercial metrÂ»)]>o*;s of all the terri
tory lying '.vest of the Kooky Mountains and
sustains commercial relations with Alaska and
the llawaiifui anÂ«i other Pacific islands.
As already *s*erted, i [ties are the effect of
whu-h the industrial eelivities in the coun- j
tries naturally tributary to them are the cause. â 
The territory' ivxthin the United States nat- i
nraily tributary to San Kranciseo embraces
about .it, i>.i,ihi square : QeÂ». The group of
States and Territories comprises Idaho, Mon
tana, Washington; Oregon, [Jtah, Nevada, Ari
zona and <'aliiornia. Of these California is the
central State. It is by far the richest, both in :
the wealth it how possesses and in it* nat- i
ural resouri It embrai â¢â - within its limits I
fully 60 percent oi all the really arable land I
west of the Rocky Mountains.
It constitutes She natural center of this
group of commonwealths and everything flows
to ii by a force of commercial u::Â«i financial j
gravity. The commercial centers of the coun
try drain the outlying territory tributary to |
them of their mon;y and their best brains.
Stin Francisco is constantly benefited by this
absorbing process. Nearly one-third of the
â wealth of this City to-day \ras generated in the
State of Nevada." The tendency toward the
commercial, financial and social center of any
country is in obedience to a law as Inexorable i
as the law of gravity. Oregon lias contributed
to the wealth amiCie population of California
and especially San Francisco. A recent illus
trative case may be cited, that of S. G. Reed, ;
one of the pioneers of Oregon, one of its largest I
capitalist;, who within the past two years left
the city oi Portland, where he had accumu- ;
lated his vast formne, and took up his resi
dence in Pasadena, His ueath in that city is !
one of the recent misfortunes of the city where '
he resided, the State of California and in fact
the entire coast.
The commerce of San Francisco is not
bounded by the political divisions called [
States. It is not conscious of these divisions at
all. The growth of California is inseparably
interwoven with the growth of all the Pacific
territory.
I beg leave here and now to plead guilty un- \
equivocally to any charge that 1 am in favor of
promoting the growth of Wasbingtou, of Ore
gon, of Nevada, or I'iah. and all other Pacitic
territory. No growth or prosperity can come
to the people of the*c States and Territories
that will not even lually inure to the upbuilding
of California, and especially to the augmenta
tion of the commexre of the City of >au Fran
claco. I have claimed, and "maintain tiiat i
claim to be good, that San Francisco is the
metropolitan center of the Pacific territory. If
this be true, we are ju.-t as much interested in
the growth of one portion of the territory
naturally tributary to our City as another.
in response to a -pir.t of enterprise which is
Inseparable from the character of its people,
the southern pan of the State has witnessed a
innrvelous growth. When i: became evident
that the southern portion of this State was on I
the eve of great advancement, there was much
manifestation of jealous alarm in many locali
ties. The alarm was due to the Rircumscribed
view which those entertaining it had of the
relation of things. Less than fifteen years ago I
Los Angeles was p. city of 7000. It claims |
100.000 to-day. Every part of thÂ« Pacific ter
ritory has been benelited by that growth.
Portland and also Tacoma have been bene
fited. But San Francisco has been the chief
beneficiary.
Our one great need is re-enforcement of our
population, and what is more, a re-enforce
ment of enterprising capital. We received
both in the growth of Southern California. It
â¢would be to the infinite advantage of all por
tion* of the Pacific Coast territory if Los Au
gele* possessed a population of half a million
to-day.
Ix>cal market means a domestic market and
natural support for local manufactures. If we
could doable the population of every city in
Oregon, Washington, I'iah, Nevada and' all
other States and Territories of the Pacific Coast,
San Francisco, as the natural commercial and !
manufacturing center of all this territory, !
would be incalculably the gainer. Our City is
the chief seaport of nearly fÂ»0O0 miles of Pa- ;
cifie scacoast. On the commercial geography !
of the world, therefore, it possesses a relation j
â with the South Sea Islands and with Alaska. j
It is au expresslqn of the most circumscribed I
provincialism on the part of any one claiming
to be a leader of public opinion in San Fran
cisco to manifest jealousy of the growth of any
part of the Pacific Coast territory.
For the sake of perspicuity I repeat: San I
Francisco's claim as the chief metropolitan i
center of Pacific territory in th* United States
and the chief seaport of Pacific Ocean com- I
merce is emphasized and honored by the sug- :
gestion of a unified exhibit of all the objects of i
culture, all the raw material on which indus
try may be expended, and all the articles of
commerce in which merchandi>inc; is inter
ested.
It was not proposed toadmit these States and
Territor es to â¢:â¢ â¢â  exhibition, nor was it a con
spiracy against the growth ol California. Cali
fornia owes a debt of gratitude to all the
Mates end Territories contiguous to it, and in
an especial manner does It owe this debt of
gratitude to ; he Mate of Nevada.
::Hr<-in; center of any territory is
the point at which the surplus capital gen
erated by the commercial aud industrial activ
ities of that territory is reservuired. In a
way capital is rtterroired In the com
mercial capital ot a nation or an empire. Lob
<ion is the reservoir of ail the surplus capital
of the British Empire. Paris performs the
name office for France, r.nd New York for
America, in a smaller way there are subdivi
sions of the territory of nations which have
their subordinate centers. Jhe I'acilic Coast
i* a naturn! geographical expre sion.
It is topographically a subdivision of the ter
ritory of the United States, and its topograph
ical features cive th;s. commercial territory
distinctive boundary line*. It ought not to be
Mary now to sajr that San Francisco is the
metropolis of this natural geographical and
topographical subdivision of our country. That
f;i' t ought to be understood. Beyond this, ita
commercial and industrial significance should
be understood, and still further its obligath.ni
to the territory which supports it ought to be
luily recognized.
Tiiat these things ere not as fully appre
hended as they should be is evidenced by a
series of interviews published in your contem
porary, the Examiner, this morning, l liav
looked in vain for nn expression in these inter
views worthy of a metropolitan city, but have
â  und it. Your contemporary says that
"the State Hoard of Trade was originally in
tended to populate and develop California."
and ineeringly says that now ttiut this state
l- nverpoptilous with prosperous colonists it is
to be devoted to the development of all the
Pacific States and Territories.
â¢ Ide of the gentlemen Interviewed declared
that he did n-.t approve of nifiking the State
Konrd of Trnde an advertising bureau for
Other States and Territories. To quote hil own
language further, he says: "It can hardly bo
- late, as much as we would
like to we neignboring stales an<" Territories
settled, that we thonld interest ourselves in
diverting population to them, and 1 can see
BO justice in establishing here an exhibition 01
the products of other States and Territories to
induce people to go there in preference to
tettling here."
Another declares: "I am at a loss to under
! stand why the public, whose chief interest
I centers in this State, should contribute to a
| project calculated to rob it of its reward of its
efforts to bring people from the East."
An exhibit of the commercial territory trib
utary to San Francisco in this city would em
phasize its nositiou as Its' capital; but would it
10b California if some one naturally predis
posed t.t settle in Oregon should have that dis
position re.enforced by an exhibit brought to
his attention in this city? Would it rob San
Francisco to double the "population of Nevada.
The underlying truth of this matter is that the
growth pf all the Pacific states is introactive.
There can be no prosperity in any part of the
supporting territory of any commercial center
that is not immediately felt and rellected at
the center. Sliall it be said to the people of
j the Pacific States and Territories that San
I Francisco regards their prosperity as a rob
| bery of California? shall we inculcate the doc
trine among these Pacific subdivisions of a
unilied commercial territory that the pros
i perity of one portion can be achieved only by
the impoverishment ot all other sections? It
is not true in any sense that the prosperity of
one portion ot California can exist only t y the
impoverishment of another portion. It is not
true that the incoming of desirable settlers in
one portion of the State is the robbery of an
other portion, -and it is equally, untrue of the
whole Pacific Coast territory. * The incoming
of population to any part of th>; Pacific Coast
territory is a distinctive re-enforcement of the
prosperity of the whi coast. It is auex
ample of the hlg iiest value.
The people of Southern California have done
more to advance the prosperity, of the.whole
State of California tha;i any instrumentality
that has been adopted, or any device which
has been put into practice since the founda
tion of the jState. The unexampled growth of
the southern part of the State, ihe upbuilding
of magnificent cities, the founding of a great
commonwealth upon a small territorial area,
have vindicated tile capacities of our foil and
climate in a manner which is a distinctive
t-erviee to every part of the Pacific Coast.
The spirit of the interviews under considera
tion is a libel upon the City of San Francisco.
This City does not loi 'Â with jealousy upon the
growth ol the outlying States and Territories.
This City's horizon is not bounded by Uie State
lines of California. The leading merchants
and bankers of this City understand full well
the community of relation they sustain to all
parts of the commercial territory of which it is
the great center.
iprocity is the law of all commercial
! transaction. We must give Komethii for
whatever we receive. San Francisco, as the
: commercial metropolis of an outlying terri
tory, has duties and responsibilities which it
cannot afford to ignore. Let it go forth that
the lef\'!:!i;,- men of San Francisco declare that
the grow of some other portion of another
; country is a robbery to this State. Let the
â¢ "Little Pedlington' 1 expression, that we see no
reason w hy ive should help build up othercom
monwcalths, become representative of us, and
we will repudiate our claim to commercial
supremacy among the cities of our geographi
cal subdivis
The question hns boen raised as to the value
of a â  ermanent exhibit of the ducts of Cali
fornia in this City. The special disadvantage
under which California labors is found in the
fact that the intending settler cannoi vi it it,
select a Location and return home t<. bring his
family to the place he may have selected. This
was possible to the Sta.es 'of this Union as the
frontier of civilization rolled westward.
The people of New York and Pennsylvania
could visit Ohio without their families, and
return after selecting a Location. From Ohio
to Indiana, from Indiana to Illinois, from Illi
nois to lowa. and so across the continent. To
day it is practical for people trom the more
densely populated portions of the country to
visit Kansas, Nebraska and ihe Dakotas, and
return for their families; but people of mod
erate means cannot afford to <lo this with re
lation to California. One of the parties inter
viewed by your contemporary says that the
people who have come here have come intend
ing to stay. Desiring to treat these gentlemen
with that courtesy which is due them as gen
tlemen from a gentleman (though 1 have a
right to plead the want of it at their hands),
permit me to say that whoever made this state
ment has proven that he is not familiar with
the truth of the matter. Whoever attempts to
teach should first vindicate his right to do so
by proving that he is in possession of the ne
cessary knowledge.
Now it is not true that the people who come
to California have come intending to stay.
California has been visited by thousands of
people who did not remain after they had
made a thorough examination of its advan
tages and resources. In ISTo, J'-'.ihiu people
came into this State. Before the end of 1574
nearly all of them had returned. The difficulty
which besets the new-comer is in finding "a
location. If he has brought his family with
him, it will exhaust his resources to place
them in a boarding-house and travel over this
btate for the I'urpose of finding a suitable
home. Many of those who do come intending
to stay, rind their means melt away before
they can find a suitable location. 1 am speak
ing by the card in these statements. I have
met these people and have conversed with
them. But the great majority of those who
visit California do not Intend to stay; that in
tention is formed by attractions resented
I here.
The register of the State Board of Trade
shows that thousands of these people have vis
ited the exhibit and have become acquainted
with and attracted to the resources ot the State
by it. To be convinced that this is true it is ]
only necessary to ask, Where could any one go
to-day to be made acquainted with the differ-
I ent portions of the State of <'aliio.'nia by com
ing to San Francisco? True, they might be
told of various localities which they might
visit: but for more than half of the year there
is nothing to be seen. The fruit harvests of i
California do not last the year roui.d. It is :
only during a few months of the year that
â¢what California is capable of doing could be j
exhibited by showing its orchards. But through
the splendid exhibit of the State Board of
; Trade the capacities oi those orchards are pre
sented in an object-lesson which can never be
forgotten.
An exhibition oi the capacities of the whole
Pacific Coast would be invaluable, because the
[ great majority of those who come have not
i come intending to stay. But such an exhibi
| lion is of peculiar value to the state of Califor
nia. When its resources are shown in the form
of an object lesson continually presented, and
when it is shown to hundreds of visitors every
day equally illustrative of the capacities of the
Stale at any time ot the year, the desire is cre
ated in the mind of the beholder to examine
the State with reference to his ultimate settle
ment here.
The exhibition should be greatly enlarged.
It should present all the raw materials suitable
for manufacture â sand for glass, clay for pot
tery, stone for building, iron ores for smelt
ing, with a full round of mineralogical re
sources of this metalliferous region.
The gentlemen who have been interviewed
speak of an exhibit of California products at
the Kast as if it. were new and original. Cali
fornia made an exhibit at the Kast during the
! World's Fair. It cost the State $300,000 to
; make that exhibit. Mr. Ferguson, one of the.
i parties interviewed, a gentleman whose elli
ciency and local patriotism will not be doubted,
was the b jperintendent of that exhibit. He
i was the special representative of the Kern
County Land Company. lie knows that more
i people examined that exhibition of Califor
nia's wonderful resources during the time of
the World's Fair than would see a permanent
exhibit in Chicago in five years.- It would be
interesting to have Mr. Ferguson's testimony
as to the direct effect of that exhibit upon im
migration to California, not of the general ef
fect of inducing the belief that California was
! a wonderful coun try and inciting a feeling in
the minds of people that at some indefinite
time and in some indefinite way they will be
come citizens of this State, but that direct ef
fect which resulted in the establishment of
prosperous colonies traceable directly to the
exhibit made by California a' the World's Fair.
The State Board of Trade by the assistance ol
the Southern Pacitic Company sent out ex
hibitions in a train called "California on
Wheels." They were, leisurely examined by
two millions of people. This wns a more com
prehensive Eastern exhibit than has yet been
made.
The State Board of Trade sent an exhibit to
Columbus, Ohio, which was visited by over
250,000 >'-ople.
My critics do not appear to be aware of the
fact'that during the entire year 18!)4 one of
the finest exhibits ever gotten together, outside
of that 7>resented by the State Hoard of Trade
at Atlanta, was mad^ at Ll2 Dearborn street,
Chicago, where 10,000 people each day passed
its doors. Here was a whole year of exhibit of
the full round of California's capacities made
in Chicago. â 
From ISS3 to 18SG the Southern Pacific Com
pany made an exhibit of the resources of Cali
lornia In London under the direction of Dr.
Kingsbury. The planting of the Lancaster col
olony was one of the unfortunate results of
that exhibit.
The best exhibits California hasattheKast
are the frultstands. In all or nearly all of the
principal cities of the East the fruits of Cali
fornia are exhibited every summer and under
the name of California fruit. Unfortunately
much fruit of an inferior Eastern production
is thus labeled; but at the same lime the fruit
stands of Chicago, i'hiladelphia, St. Louis,
Cincinnati and New York are a constant ex
hibit of the resources of this State. The sug
gestion is by no means new. The State Board
of Trade had under consideration the question
of making an exhibit in the principal gro
ceriei ol 100 cities in the United States. This
project failed for want of means.
Tne groceries were willing to maintain an
exhibit of the products of California and keep
it in good order, but money enough could not
be obtained for the formation of the exhibit.
Those unfamiliar with the facts are perhaps
not aware that the present exhibit of the State
Board of Trade could not be duplicated in one
year for $50,000. By nil means, let us hove an
Eastern exhibit. A dozen of them, if you
please; but such an exhibit will not be pro
moted by misconstruing the motives of those
who have interested themselves in collecting
the exhibits already established ; nor will it be
made by the gentlemen who were interviewed
by your contemporary.
In looking over that list I find that not more
than one is a contributor to the expenses of
the State Board of Trade, and he contributes
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 1896.
the munificent sum of (?2 50 per month. The
gentlemen interviewed expressed the opinion
that but little has been accomplished by the
State Board of Trade. lam not familiar" with
the opportunities they may have had for judg
ing oi this matter, but I am familiar with the
tact thm they have not instituted any inquiry
which would justify them in passing an opin
ion.
The State Hoard of Trade is the concerted ef- '
fort of twenty-eight counties to maintain at
the chief metropolitan center a bureau of in
formation and an exhibit which will attract at
tention to their advantages. It has been a
perfectly nnselfiah, i^airiotic effort. No one
connected with it, except its secretary, has re
ceived salary , and none have derived personal
advantage.
I wish now, in a most emphatic manner, to !
call the attention of the public to the iactthat ;
during its entire existence it has been the vie- I
tim oi the meanest malevolence ever visited
upon an unoffending organization. Chief
among the statements made to discredit its |
efforts is that it is an adjunct of the Southern I
Pacific Company; that it has beea but little J
more than an advertising agency for that com- j
puny, and my personal relation with it has!
been pointed to as conclusive evidence of the i
truth of tins charge.
This statement is wholly devoid of truth, ]
and I take the personal responsibility of say- '
my thht those who make it are aware of its
falsity. There has never been at any time any
lands in which the Central Pacific or the
southern Pacific Railroad Company were in- I
terested advertised through the agency of the
State Hoard ol 'J rade. Not one pamphlet or â 
circular has ever been permitted to be placed
upon its counters or distributed through its j
agency. When it has made an Eastern exhibit j
no circular or pamphlet relating toany interest
of the Southern. Pacific Company hnsbeen dis
tributed through its agency. That the South
ern Pacific Company has been the most liberal
contributor to us support is true, and it Is true
to the infinite credit of that corporation. I* pun '
this one fact has been based nil the petty,:
mean-spirited opposition, which, when we con- |
sider Ii was launched a* an unselfish, patriotic
effort to accomplish some good for this com
monwealth, becomes worse than contemptible.
I rind evidence of this in one of the inter
views which has provoked this statement. I
Oie gentleman iv effect informs tne public |
I that he is opposed to any broadening of the
effort of San Francisco to assert its primacy
among the commercial cities ol this State, and
he says he can understand readily why Mr.
Mills has been in favor of a Pacific Coast ex
hibit. He declares the reason that the South
ern Pacific Company has its railroad line to
Oregon and its steamship line to the ila
waiian Islands.
1 could well afford to treat with silence this
denial of worthy motive underlying anything
I have suggested or done in connection with
the growth of California were it not that it is I
the common lot of all who have attempted to
accomplish something for the State to he in
like manner misrepresented a'ul maligned.
Your contemporary characterizes the state
ments of this detractor as candid. I respect
fully represent that it has mistaken bad breed
ing for candor in this instance. The statement |
possesses the merit of neither truth nor candor. '
The Southern Pacific Company nas no line of i
steamers to the Sandwich Islands, and is not
interested in any such lines. The gentleman
could have made himself master of this fact
by the slightest inquiry. That he stated for a
I fact that the Southern Pacific Company has a
: line of steamers to Honolulu and declares that
j it Is in the service of this line of steamers that
! 1 had made a suggestion is a manifestation of
j willingness to invent a line of steamers for the
( purpose of impeaching my motives and of dis
parngine me in 'he estimation of the public. I
am wholly indifferent as to the person*! appli
cation of this species of malevolence, but I am
not indifferent to its constant misrepresenta
tion n>v.ard every public-spirited citizen of the
State. Many of these have united their efforts
| with the state Board of Trade in times past
only to i\:.6 themselves charged with being
candidates for office or of being in the service
of this or that private interest.
As to any suggestion I may have made con
cerning a commercial exhibit for the Pacific
I Coast having relevancy to the line of railroad
from Shu Francisco to Portland. I may say that
I it i> the duty of every railroad to build up all
the territory which it serves; that such action
would be highly commendable in an officer of
a railroad, and that v is my pride and ambi
tion to l>e just as useful and' faithful to my em-
I ployment as my capacities, however limited,
may permit. But whoever asserts that this or
any other suggestion relating to the good of
tin- eominonwealtii had no other or broader
motive than the benefit of a single line of
transportation takes & liberty with tne truth
v. hied justifies the declaration that he is care- !
less of his reputation for veracity.
Permit me to conclude tins* already too
; lengthy communication with the presentation
' of a matter of the highest and most immediate
importance to the people of California. The
growth of Northern California has been re
tarded by. its system of lanre land holdings.
The beÂ«t lands of the groat valleys of California \
have been unavailable for colonization. Re
cently a combination has been entered into
between the holders of the miM fertile lands of
the Sacramento Valleyâ lauds which in all
j time siuco the settlement of this State have
I been Inaccessible to the newcomer: lands pos
â .: intrinsically live times the value of the
' average plains lands of this State. This com
j bination has been formed in the hope of open
! inÂ«r an extensive region to settlement, present-
I ing the broadest, most striking enterprise in
i this line ever suggested.
Tha' combination hns now been completed
by the signature of the owners of the latm to
doc a menU which commit them for a limited
time :o ft joint effort to open these hir^e and
fertile areas to settlement. What is re
quired Is sufficient capital to launch this en
terpriae. its magnitude and its merit will do
the rest. In this combination of lands, em
bracing nearly seventy-four miles of navigable
waterfront on the Sacramento River, is found
an opportunity for breaking through at once
the one hitherto Insurmountable obstacle to
the settlement of the Sacramento Valley.
Those lands have been combined at rates which
will justify their offering at less than half the
price heretofore offered for colony lands. The
event marks the close of a distinctively histor
ical era of land holding in California.
The next question which confronts this en
terprise is. Where can the capital be foand for
insolidation of these lands into the own
erahipof a single corporation designed solely
to segregate them and secure their settlement?
They are incumbered by mortccees held in San
Francisco of more than $2,000,000. ] have
been informed there is in the vaults of the
banks of sjn KraneNeo to-day over #100,
--ouo.OOO. The question arises can the capital
necessary to make this empire of fertility the
basis of an empire of population be found on
the Pacific Coast. If not, then the effort must
bÂ« made in foreign mouey markets, where nt
the very outset the enterprise must stand dis
credited as having been repudiated at home.
The succpks of this effort will be a crucial test
of the ability of the people of California to
unite upon an enterprise. The questions
which arise and which must be answered I
take the liberty of asking now: Will the mo
tives of the persons who hare promoted this
undertaking be impugned 0 Will its merits be
inquired into by tho-;e who make the law of
public opinion concerning it, so that their as
sertions relating to it will have a solid founda
tion in truth?
Can this undertaking, fraught with so much
promise of good to California, receive encour
agement at the hands of capitalist* at nome
where its real value may be fully and clearly
understood? Will the people of California
make themselves masters of all the facts relat
ing to it, and if they find it worthy of their
support can they be united in an" effort to
carry it to complete success? Will it receive
at the hands of the public journalists of this
State thai judicial fairness which nil public
enterprises, having for their object the good of
the commonwealth, are entitled to receive?
In brief, will agrear undertaking, having for its
object only the re -enforcement of the popula
tion and the capital of California, receive at
the hands of the people of California fair ana
cay.did consideration and treatment?
Los Angeles arise from a city of 5000 to a
city of nearly 100,000 in less than twenty
years, simply by reason of the capacity of her
Citizens to act together in the upbuilding of
their country. The snmo statement is true of
every city and every commonwealth that have
enjoyed any degree of prosperity within the
past century. It is through this "unified effort
alone that prosperity can come to California.
The provincial spirit which objects to an in
strumentality of good to all of the commercial
territory tributary to San Francisco is the one
thing which has constituted the greatest ob
stacle to the growth otthis state. The enter
prise-, the energy, the prosperity and the
growth of any locality is an exterior manifes
tation of the Interior character of the people
residing there, and these attributes, to be effec
tive for the good of any community, must be
unified by a consensus of effort.
We of California can bring to our State p.
now era of prosperity only by offering encour
agement to all who are willing to work, and it
is this encouragement which has been grudg
ingly withheld in all our history.

FOR FEWER PREACHERS.
The Rev. ldwar.U Dnvls Advocates the
Concentration of Congregation*.
The Rev. Edwards Davis of Oakland
preached yesterday forenoon in the pulpit
<>f the West S'de Christian Church on
Bush street, near Devisadero, his subject
being "Awake, arise," and his treatment
of it a prophecy of an awakening in the
religious world, the airival of the time
when church members will take a more
active part in public affairs.
He said that the world was asleep dur
ing the dark ages and that Luther awoke
the people. Then they went to sleep a<zain,
and it devolved upon John Wesley to
awaken them. Prom another sleep they
were aroused by Alexander Campbell.
Now the people are asleep again and
consecrated and sincere ministers of the
gospel must bring about the next refor
mation.
He concluded by saying it would be well
for tne churches in and about the City to
profit by the example of the Mormons,
v;ho concentrated their public worship in
one great temple accommodating 10,000
people. Then, lie added, two ministers
could do what it now requires nearly IKX)
to perform, and the extra ministers could
go into the slums and work.
THE PARK AND VICINITY
Fall of the Klertric Tower-Tlie Bicycle
Roadâ A Cannon-Ball Catcher Meets
With an Accident.
The electric tower in Golden Gate Park
is down, never more to be raised again.
Commissioner Austin did not like the
condition in which it remained alter the
attempt to hurl it to the ground on Satur
day, and after consultation with Superin
tendent McLaren it was decided to make
one more effort to bring it down. Early
yesterday morning a charge of dynamite
was placed under the foundation and it
was tired. The leaning structure was
shaken by the force of the explosion, for a
moment it wavered, then it leaned further
toward the south and then fell with a loud
crash. There was a cloud of dust, and
when that cleared away it was discovered
that all above the first platform wj-.s twist
ed out of shape, that many of the bolts had
been snapped and that the platforms were
iri splinters. The lower portion remained
in fair condition, except the southwestern
leg, which was broken off.
During the afternoon the fallen monster
| was visited by a large number of people,
each carrying away a bit of iron or a
splinter as a memento.
Superintendent McLaren said he was
glad that the structure was down, and
that steps would be taken to remove the
df bris without delay.
The day not being a 1 right one, there
were not as many people in the park as
usual. There were, however, an unusual
number of cyclers on the road. The new
I road being specially constructed for the
| wheelers is being pushed forward rapidly
â¢ much of the filling having been completed.
During the week ending last Saturday
atf>o clock in the afternoon, 7101 person's
visited the museum. Its Litest additions
are three photographs, the gift of E. N.

! dance of the Klamath Indians. Some
1 very fine specimens of cinnabar from Napa
County were also received.

Yesterday afternoon there were no less ,
than 4CXKJ in the Iluight-street grounds to 'â 
witness the special attractions. These con- '
sisted of catching cannon balls fired from j
; a real cannon with real oowder ami exhi
bitions by a strong man. Herr Holtum, j
the ball-catcher, took up a position on a j
i platform eight feet above the ground, but j
had neglected to have a rail put around it. !
As a result of this negligence, when he I
i caught the iirst ball tirnd, he had nothing !
; to brace himself against and the force of i
; the shot forced him off the platform. In
| striking the ground he sprained one rf his
; ankles. Despite tbis accident he returned j
to the platform and had two men hold a I
heavy rail against his back, and in that !
position caught with one hand a second
. ball tired at him.

wonderful exhibition of his "power to lift I

A RABBI TO CHRISTIANS.

Kelicf in <;o<l.
Kabbi Yoorsanger delivered a lecture
yesterday afternoon at the Young Men's j
Christian Association. It was the first of I
a series to be delivered tills winter by lead- !
ing ministers of the City. One of the I
largest audiences ever gathered In the I
auditorium greeted the rabbi, who was j
often interrupted with applause during
his address. He spoke of the influence oi I
a belief in God upon human conduct and j
the formation of character. Speaking 'â 
of the difference between political and i
ethical laws, he said that political laws did j
not seem to concern themselves with the
morality of nations. They seem to be j
mainly interested in what they can steal |
from each other. The influence of politi- I
cal laws was negative. "If there were no j
ethical laws the people would probably i
aU become liars," he said. "Nothing has
such an influence on man as his account
ability, not to political law but to his ;
God."
Speaking of the contentions between
creeds, lie said: "When we get down to
the bottom of any religion we find that
their laws are the same â the laws of good
ness, of morality."
He said that the strength of republican
institutions depended largely upon the
piety of homes. "It is a fact that our
homes are deterioratinp, and that is the
greatest danger to our republic to-day. !
One of the greatest evils in San Francisco
is the noardine-house."

IN MEMORY OF SCANNELL
Impressive Ceremonies at the
Dedication of His Monu
ment.
AT LAUREL EILL CEMETERY.
Henry E. Highton Delivers an Eloquent
Address on the Chiefs
Career.
The beautiful monument in the firemen's
plat at Laurel Hill Cemetery, erected to
mark the resting-place of the remains of
i the late David Scannell, Chief of the San
Francisco Fire Department, was dedicated
I yesterday afternoon with impressive cere
monies.
A large number of people attended the
dedicatory exercises, among them being
many pioneer?. Detachments of firemen
from the various fire companies of the
City, a full representation of exempt
I firemen and a large number of Veterans of
the Mexican War assembled At the ceme- j
tery to pay their respects to the memory [
of the illustrious Chief. The Fire Comm
issioners, Fire Underwriters, members of
the Fire Department, committee of the
Board of Supervisors and many other citi
zens were present.
After they had filed through the narrow
walks of the firemen's resting-place and
gathered round the veiled monument, the i
Masonic quartet sang ''Blessed Are the j
Dead." Chief Engineer Sullivan of the j
Fire Department stepped into the open
space and In a few words began the cere- j
monies.
"We are here to-day," he said, "to dedi
cate a monument erected by members of
the Fire Department and friends to our
late Chief, David ScannelL" With these
words the covering fell from the monu- j
ment. exposing a graceful shaft of granite j
rising for a. considerable height. All men J
present uncovered and the crowd admired
the beautiful monumentâ the solid base '
with its throe steps leading to a stately i
plinth that bore the inscription in bold ,
letters giving the date of Chief Scannell's j
birth and death. For ornament therÂ« were j
emblems of the veteran firemen and ap- i
propriate scrolls, and over all rose the tall,
tapering stiaft of gray granite.
The silence in presence ol this eloquent
token from the firemen was broken by the
impressive strains of "J'eace to the Mem- !
ory or the Dead," from the quartet. And |
when this hymn was finished Chief Sulli- |
van introduced Henry E. Highton. who I
dwelt long and earnestly on the noble i
career of Chief Scannell and paid deserv- j
ing tribute to his record as a soldier, a i
fireman and a citizen.
"More than thirty-six years ago, in the j
house of Leonidaa Haske'il, I stood by the j
bedside of David Brodnriok, then suffering |
from his last wound. Where warn? hearts j
were beating in sympathy and dread was j
ebbing the life of'a great' American. Sud- j
denly the doctor said, 'Mr. Broderick is
dead,' and silently we retired to the lawn
in front and stood in little groups. But j
one of these men was by himself. Prone j
on the grass, shaken by convulsive j
was stretched the formof David Scannell. I
This man, bruve almost to recklessness,
was as tender ns a woman. There is not a
man who fought beside him in Mexico but
loved him, not a fireman who had worked
with him that would not have risked life i
and limb for him. His word of command
was 'Follow!' and it was followed into the i
jaws of death. His entire life was in some j
senses a romance; he ranked among the j
very heroes of romance, but he was not a
creature of impulse."
Mr. Highton briefly reviewed the many
notable events in Chief Scannell's career,
giving full credit where nothing but words
of praise were due for bravery and hero
ism, concluding with the exclamation,
"The man was a born hero."
The singers cave "Shall We Meet Be
yond the River," and General Sheridan, a
veteran, of the Mexican War, delivered an
address on the war record of Chief Scan
nell. The ceremonies came to a close
I with the singing of "Good-night. I'm
Going Home. 1 '
EVOLUTION OF SOCIETY.
Socialism Said to Be the Next Logical
Step in Advance.
There was another packed house at the
meeting of the Socialist Labor party at
Tythian Hall, 900 Market street, last nipht.
After a brief musical and literary pro
gramme Arthur 11. Sanborn delivered an
address on ihe "The Evolution of Society."
He depicted tlite advancement of man.
illustrating the various siaces by different
races now in existence. He showed how
from the stone hammer had been derived
the enormous cannon of to-day. He
showed the steps that lead from the train
ing of an animal as a beast of burden to
the general use of electricity, which is to
be the servant of to-morrow. He then
showed how social conditions had changed
and argued that the next rational and
logical step in advance was socialism.
Questions and a short debate ensued.
Miss Jane A. Roulstone will deliver an
address next Sunday evening at the same
place on "Under What Banner?"
FELL TWO STORIES.
Andrew Woodn, a Plnirber and Poli-
tlcian, Fatally Injured Yesterday.
A Joud crash of breaking glass, followed
by the dull thud of a body striking the
floor, awakened the occupants of the Re
vere lodging-house at 675 Mission street
early yesterday morning. Upon investi
gation Andrew Woods, one of the lodgers,
was found underneath an air shaft, which
runs from the first to the third floors, cov
ered with blood and rapidly dying. The
almost lifeless form of the unfortunate
man was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where it was found that his neck had been
broken. He died in the course of a few
hours. In addition to the fractured ver
tebrae, which was the immediate cause of
death, be had received other injuries
which would have, in all probability,
proven fatal.
It is not known just how Woods met
with the accident. His room is on the
third floor of the house adjoining the nir
shaft under which he was found. This
shaft is guarded by a low railing, and it is
presumed that he stooped down to unlock
his door, and upon raising up fell against
the railing, lost his balance and fell to the
Iloor two stories below. In the descent a
window sash was broken and the glass
crushed to fragments, giving evidencethat
Woods must have turned over and over
while falling, striking the sash with his
feet, which turned him head downward.
Woods was a plumber by trade and was
more or less interested in politics, having
been elected a member of the general com
mittee in the Buckley primaries of the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District the night
before his death. He leaves a mother, two
sisters and a brother.
INFLUENCE OF STRIKES.
They Are to the Social World as Pains
Are to the Body.
Morrison I. Swift delivered before the
American Socialist Society last evening at
Alcazar Hah a lecture on "Strikes as an
Instrument of Civilization." He said that
the attitude of the people toward strikers
is radically wrong. They are, as a general
thing, he explained, callously indifferent
when strikes are peaceful and condemn
them unheard when they grow into vio
lence. "Society," said he, "is, like the
human body, composed of different mem
bers, all dependent the one upon the other.
The lowest class, the workiogmen, cor
respond to the arms; by them all things
are executed.
"A strike plays the part of pain in the
social body and indicates that something
is wrong. It is not right to cut off the
member that is in pain: oftentimes the
whole system needs a remedy which would
do more good than mere local treatment.
And so a strike in society is caused not
always by a fault of the workingman, but
because there exists a great wrong in
other parts of the system."
The Crust of the Earth.
The crust of the earth, according to
Professor John Milne's opinion, is in
a constant state of agitation â earth
movements being experienced at all
times and in all lauds â the greatest
European crust agitation having its seat
in Germany, Japan occupying a similar
position in Asia. In both Germany
and Japan a tide-like movement, too
great to be produced by lunar attrac
tions, has been observed, the ground being
gently lifted every twenty-four nours,
and sometimes twice, and In al! cases the
buildings, trees, etc., stand slightly in
clined, like cornstalks in a gentle
and steady breeze â in short, the earth
is constantly breathing, as it were,
the crust making each respiration by a
gentle rising and falling, similar to that
of the chest in air-breathing animals. A
certain per cent of this earth-crust dis
turbance is believed to bs due to con
ditions similar to those which bring
about eartnquakes, this being regarded
as especially the fact in respect to Japan,
where it has been traced to the continual
opening and closing of the broken strata
in the main range of the mountains.
Nearly every army now has a bicycle
corps. In Germany six men of every r'eei
menture mounted on wheels to act as
scouts.

REFORM IN CITY AFFAIRS
An Interesting Discourse by Dr.
Martyn, a Chicago
Churchman.
COMBINE AGAINST CORRUPTION'
The Parkhurst of the Windy City
Suggests Things to the Local
Pastors.
The Central Methodist Episcopal Church
on Mission street was packed to the side
walk last night when Rev. Carlos Martyn,
the "Parkhurst of Chicago," spoke upon
municipal reform and the methods of ac
complishing it. Dr. Martyn is here on a
short visit. He is interested in the adjust
ment of municipal affairs throughout the
country, and he very strongly indicated
Jast evening that he will stir the loci
churchmen to a concerted and vigorous
movement before he leaves town.
Dr. Martyn is an admirable speaker.
! He has an educational air about him that
at oneo commands respect and attention.
He talks quickly and is always emphatic
and at times eloquent. His terseness of
statement anil his clever paraphrasing and
handling: of old anecdotes rendered the
sermon particularly interesting. As an offi
cer of the National Cnristian Citizenship
League he accomplished wonders for re
form in Chicago, and he lias become one
of the mo^t-talked-of men in the country
in that line of work.
His discourse last night was upon mu
nicipal reform in a general way. He in
troduced the subject with some interest
ing references to the proud privilege of
living in what he called "the best country
the world ever knew." He ttien went on
to explain that the founders of tiie Nation
established it upon the broad basi? of man
hood, and armed every man in self-defense
with the ballot. The people, he declared,
are in supreme control, and they are not
permitted to shirk the responsibility of
righteous citizenship. If there are bad
laws in our codes we are responsible for
them. If there be an organization for evil
we must rise to combat it and organize
among ourselves for that purpose. It is a
fact, he said, that tilings are going wrong.
There is hardly a municipality in the
country that is not governed by gamblers,
grogshops and other evil influences. All
combined to the detriment of proper mu
nicipal management.
As to the matter of ministers concerning
themselves with these things, he ex
piained that ministers were obliged to
meddle in politics to some extent because
politics meddles with them. His idea is
that the term politician properly includes
every man in the country interested in its
well-being, and he held it necessary that
every member of every congregation
should be awake to the national and
municipal issues. Everyone, he said,
shouid be familiar with "questions that
touch the public weal and unless they are
so there can be no proper administration
of affairs.
Dr. Martyn spoke in an amusing way of
the condition of thing 9 in Chicago a couple
of years ago, of the variously corrupt city
departments and of the unÂ»peakaole cor
ruption of the Council, which "not ali the
waters of the lake could cleanse.". He en
tered to some extent into the methoas by
which the Chicago reformers accomplished
their work last spring. Among other
things there was concerted and vigorous
action by the churchmen, and he advised
that the ministers of San Francisco do as
the Chicaeoans did. He earnestly recom
mended to the clergymen of the C'itv that
they get together and begin an active cru
sade against gambling and the liquor
traffic.
THE HEROIC SYMPHONY.
Wagner'i Explanation or Beethoven*
Hero.
A work of art requires no explanation.
But the very title Beethoven gave the
"Heroic Symphony" provokes questions,
and there have been many endeavors to
explain it. Wagner tried less to explain
it 9 meaning than to explain it away.
Chained to his one idea he asserted that
Beethoven's hero was not a military hero,
but a young man of complete spiritual and
physical endowment, who passed from
mere brute delight in life and his strength
through tragic suffering to a high spiritual
satisfaction in love; That is to say, he
asserted that Beethoven's hero was Parsi
fal or Seigfried.
Now this much of Wagner's theory is
true, that Beethoven would not worship
a mere human butcher any more than he
would worship a pork-butcher as a hero.
On the other hand Beethoven's hero was
undoubtedly a military hero, Napoleon
Bonaparte. We know that the symphony
was originally dedicated to Napoleon, that
the dedication was altered when Napoleon
(as Beethoven thought) turned traitor and
became Emperor; we know that when the
news of his death came Beethoven casu
ally remarked that he had already com
posed the music for that event.
Of what parts, then, of Napoleon's career
do the first and last two movements tell?
These are questions which can never be
answered, and, mere curiosity apart, it so
happens that it matters little whether they
are answered or not answered, so long as
they are not answered altogether wrongly
Eor whatever events Beethoven might lit
any moment have in his mind he never
tried to depict them, but only to communi
cate the emotion they aroused. He him
self said as much. It is in the expression
of human enotion he is supreme, and to
feel aright the emotions of the Heroic
bymphony we need only to have our
minds clear of a story which Beethoven
did not and could not have had in his
mind. â Saturday Review.\ SPLENDID EDITION.

BEST ISSUED OX THE COAST.
Yisnlm Delta.
It is safe to say ttat the Christmas edi
of the San Francisco Mobzojtg Call
edited by Charles M. Shortridge, was the
b<?st edition of a paper ever issued on this

tributed articles to the issue, and the sub
jects took a wide range. All were ably
treated and were interesting to the reader.
PRAISED BY A VISALIA EDITOR.
Vlsalla Times.
"Of the big papers, the Christmas Call
easily leads them all. To our mind it is
the most valuable paper for the State ever
issuea in Caiifornia." Another editorial
praises Major Berry's article, and a full
column is given to I. W. Hellman's finan
cial prospects, "that should be read,"
says the Times, "by every grumbler in the
State of California."
UNEQUALED FOR RELIABILITY.
Oceanalde Blade.
The San Francisco Call's fifty-two
page Christmas number was by far the
most reliable paper ever got out in
California in the history of the State. It
was nota compilation of "wash," slammed
together without regard to facts, as too
many of such issues are. It was not only
a credit to California journalism, but also
to that of the whole country.
BOUND TO GET TO THE TOP.
Amador Record.
The San Francisco Call Christmas edi
tion of fifty-two pages was one of the
ablest and most complete newspapers ever
got out in the State. Editor Shortridge
does nothing by halves. When he under

be well done. The Call is bound to get to
the top of the heap. Long life and success
to The Call and Charles Shortridge.
CREDIT TO JOURNALISM.
Crescent City News.
The News is under obligations to News
dealer Frost for a copy of the Xmas
edition of the San Francisco Call. It
contains fifty-two pages, and is replete

It surely is a credit to California journal

OUTRIVALED COMI'ETITIOX.

The Christmas editions of the San Fran

beho'.d. It is tiie opinion of the Gazette
that the letter press of Tin: Call, the sub
ject-matter treated, the valuable and in
teresting information presented, taken all
in all. was the superior publication, and
that it outrivaled competitors in each and
every department of news, literature and
miscellany.
EXCELLENT AND VAM'ABLE.
The Palo Alto.
The San Francisco Call issued a fifty
two page number Christmas morning
which was a most excellent and valuable
production. Every leading industry in
the State was made the subject of a concise
and interesting paper by some well-known
authority upon the subject. From a lit
erary, historical and statistical point of
view, the number was a very creditable
production.
HIT THE VAIL ON THK HEAD.
sun Fraoctoa Volksfreuiid.
The Call has hit the nail on the head
with its Christmas edition. It is remark
able that there should be so much really
readable matter in the W>l columns, when
we take into consideration how much non
sensical matter is generally presented in
the English newspapers. The proprietor
of The i. 'all is a practical newspaperman.
The lending article, "Jesus of Nazareth,"
surpasses all others.

James Boyd of tbis city has a very reas

The article gives the early history of the

glance at the future of the raisin industry
is furnished. The article is well written
and well worth perusal.
ABLY REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA.
Palnla (I'tali) Press.
The greatest Christmas edition of any
newspaper to reach this office was that of
the Ban Francisco Call. It contained fifty
two pages of reading matter, elaborately
illustrated throughout. The resources of
California tvere magnificently depicted
and there were articles upon every con
ceivable subject from the pens of the
brightest writers in the Golden State. It
ably represented Californiaâ the land of
Mower?, fruit and sunshine.
BECOMES DAILY MORE POPULAR.
Woodland Homo Alliance.
The Christmas number of the San Fran
cisco Call is a magnificent production. It
contains lifty-two pages of interesting and
valuable matter, dealing with all the con
ditions and advantages of our State, writ
ten by our most eminent and learned men.
Tin: Call is making rapid strides under
its new management and is becoming
more popular every day with the most .in
telligent readers of the State.
A NOTABLE SPECIMEN.
San Ilafael Journal.
The Christmas Call was a notable speci
med of a great daily. Among several ar
ticles on the schools of the State was one
by Superintendent Furlong, descriptive of
the schools and school wort of this county.
Mr. Furlong shows the rapid advance that
has been made in methods of teaching in
the past few years, which place the pupils
of to-day on a much higher plane of priv
ilege than their elders enjoyed.
ACHIEVEMENT TO BE PROUD OF.
Merced Star.
No other journal on the coast came any
where near the high standard issue of the
San Francisco Call on Christmas day. It
was a history in itself and was an achieve
ment that Mr. Shortridge has reason to be
proud of. Every department received care
ful attention and thesubjectstreated made
very pleasant and interesting reading.
The Gall is easily in the front rank with
the leading journals of the country.
NEVER ONE I.IKi; IT.
Bakersfleld California!!.
One of those papers which are laid away
for reference and preserved for the fund of
valuable information afforded is the
Christmas Call. There has never been an
issue of any California paper like it, and
in every detail it shows that the man at its
head is a thorough newspaper man in
every sense of the word. The Call is
rapidly growing in circulation and bids
fair to become the leading paper on the
coast.
COVERS THE ENTIRE RANGE.
SWma Enterprise,
The "Table of Contents" to The Call's
Christmas edition is ;i grand index to the
teeming riches which should make our
California Christmas a merry one indeed.
It covers the entire range of industries in
progress, in contemplation and the poten
tialities. In its Christmas edition Tin:
Call has again proved its right to the
motto, "The Call speaks for all," and to
be designated a thoroughly up-to-date
journal.
A PLEASURE TO PERUSE IT.
Berkeley Advocate.
The Christmas edition of the San Fran
cisco Call is, in many respects, the best
ever issued on the coast. It is not only
thoroughly representative, but thoroughly
readable. Mr. Shortridge took care to
avoid publishing page after page of dry
statistics which no one cares to wade
through. Instead, his paper is filied with
matter of interest to every one, and so
carefully and entertainingly written up
that it is a pleasure to peruse.
EXCELLENT TO SEND AWAY.
Weuvcrville Journal.
The San Francisco Call's Christmas edi
tion was anotner valuable contribution to
the newspaper literature of the State, and
is a splendid edition to send to one"s
friends. It was filled with interesting and
' useful matter, and the general arrange
ment and make-up of the paper was first
! class. The onward strides that The Call
I has been making under its new manage
ment cannot be better exemplified than
| by its mammoth holiday edition.
TOO MUCH FOR ONE DAY.
Modesto Herald.
The San Francisco Call got out a mas
nificent Christmas number â fifty-two
pages â the greater number of which were
filled with special articles of general im
portance relating to the welfare of the
State. Yet not one-twentieth of this mat
ter was read by one in a hundred of the
Call's readers. There was too much of it.
Had the Call published one of these ar
ticles every day or two in its regular is
sues, they would have been read and ap
preciated.
THE QUALITY ALL RIGHT.
Woodland Democrat.
Nearly all the San Francisco papers is
sued special Christinas editions, but The
Call was by far the largest. It contained
a great many articles of unusual interest,
contributed by the leaders in the profes
sions and in the industrial life of Califor
nia. Our greatest objection to it was its
size; the quality was all right. It is too
much to expect one to read with care and
a full appreciation of its merit a daily
newspaper of lifty-two pages at this par
ticular season of the year.
TIIE EDITION CAPS THK CLIMAX.
Centralia (Wash.) News.
We have seen a good many Christmas
and other holiday editions of great news
papers, but the 52-page Christmas number
of the San Francisco Call is the dandy of
them all. This not so much on account of
its size, but because it is filied with matter
relating to the material welfare of every
section of California upon subjects of in
terest, to every person on the Pacific Coast.
The Call has recently done a (rood many
great things in the newspaper line, but its
Christmas edition caps them all.
READING ENOUGH FOR WEEKS.
Yreka Union.
The Christmas number of the San Fran
cisco Daily Call was an immense affair,
consisting of fifty-two pages, and consti
tuted a full book, numbering in all about
a hundred separate articles, including
news of the day, original stories, poems,
agricultural, horticultural, mining, educa
tional and other matters, and had many
illustrations. The Christmas Call fur
nishes the reader or a family circle enough
interesting reading matter to last for
weeks, and then should be put aside for fu
ture reference or comment.
ONE OF THE VERY BEST.
ColusaSun.
The Christmas Cakl is one of the very
best papers ever issued on this coast. It
has contributions from thirty or forty of
the best-known writers on the coast, each
in his particular line. Claus Spreckels
writes on the Valley Railroad and the
beet industry, Richard Gird on beet sugar,
I. W. Hellman on finance, George C.
Perkins on navigable waterways; in fact,
almost every subject of interest is treated
by the best recognized authority. Luella
Green Harton, a Colnsa eirl, has an article
on Father Junipero in Alta California.
BRIGHT AND FKESH.
Martinez Gazette.
The Christmas edition of The Call was
a mammotn number of tilty-two pages.
The average "blanket sheet" attracts but
little attention, as it is too frequently
filled with boom advertising and stale read
ing matter, but the Christmas Call is
bright ana fresh from the first to the last
page. It contains in addition to the usual
news of the previous day many timely ar
ticles by the ablest writers and" thinkers of
the age. In fact, Charles M. Shortridge has
again stepped to the front in a most suc
cessful scoop of all his contemporaries.
LEADS IN SIZE AND QUALITY.
Heno (Xev.) Gazette.
The big San Francisco dailies have
issued their usual Christmas editions.
' The Call this year takes the lead, both in
; .size and qualit}', with the Examiner sec
| ond, with its school children's number.
; The latter was hardly up to the expecta
} tion, but probably when it is considered
that it was edited and managed by inex
| perienced hands it should be considered a
fair paper. The Chronicle did not publish
: but little more than its usual edition and
I not as much matter as is generally found
! in its Sunday numbers.
OME OF THK BEST NEWSPAPERS.
Yuma (Ariz.) Sentinel.
The Christmas edition of the San Fran
cisco Call contained fifty-two pages, or
364 columns of matter. Every page is
brimful of descriptive reading of the City
and her surrounding cities and country in
general. It is profusely illustrated with
views of the City and pictures of her prom
inent men who have been identified with
the City's interests for many years.
Charles M. Shortridge, the editor and pro
prietor, since he has been at the helm of
The Call, has made it one of the best
newspapers on the Pacific Coast.
A GREAT IMPROVEMENT.
Deeth (Xev.) Tidings.
Charles M. Shortridge of the Pan Fran
cisco Call has proven himseif to be a
thorough newspaper man. By his in
domitable energy he has brought The
Call second to none among the great
newspapers on the Pacific Coast. Prior to
Mr. Shortridge's control of this journal it
was an unprofitable investment, while the
meagerness of its news columns was ap
parent to all. But all this has been
changed under the new management, and
The Call is to-day a great "daily. The
Call's Christmas edition of lifty-two pages
was a credit to modern journalism.
A JOURNALISTIC MARVEL.
Nooksack (Wash.) Kepeater.
The fifty-two page issue of the San Fran
cisco Call as a Christmas offering to the
State pride of California was an intellect
ual, typographical and pictorial marvel.
From ordinary news to polemics it re
flected the genius of her sous and daugh
ters so brilliantly that all her sister States
feel greater pride in California than ever.
The possible in newspaper expansion has
no limits, but to issue fifty-two pages of a
morning newspaper, without an inch of
padding and every article boiled down to
avoid verbosity, is an achievement which
we believe has never bei'ore been equaled.
EDITION OF GREAT MERIT.
Lodi Sentinel.
The Sentinel was unable to comment
upon the special edition of the San Fran
cisco Call on Christmas day for the rea
son that it came to hand too late; but it
would be doing an injustice to that enter
prising journal not to at least mention its
kindness to our immediate vicinity. It
seems useless to attempt to go farther into
its merits than to simply say that it was a
great edition and clear up to date. Only a
careful perusal of its columns can give a
proper conception of its full merits. In
speaking of the Lodi and Stockton Termi
nal road it says somÂ§ very kind things of
our town and our lands.
NO GROUND FOR APOLOGY.
Stockton Independent.
The San Francisco Call apologized on
Tuesday for its intention of inflicting a
fifty-two pace Christmas number on the
public. The Christmas number came, but
those who read it sought in vain for any
ground for apology. Its pages were full (if
valuable matter, agricultural, artistic, his
torical, scientitic, statistical, poetic, liter
ary and miscellaneous. It was largely de
voted to Californiaâ its products and pros
pects, its attractions and advantages, its
men and women and its enterprises and
resources. It is a number to file away for
future reference and to send abroad to
spread the gospel of California.
NO RIVAL IN LOCAL RANKS.
The Nation.
The Christmas number of the San Fran
cisco Call was the finest Christmas news
paper ever issued in California. It wasn't
the seasonable Christmas cake it was after
â it fairly captured the whole bakery. To
day Thk Call has no rival worthy'of the
name in the ranks of the local press.
Eclipse is first and the rest are nowhere.
The way to supreme success in the race of
journalistic rivalry is doubtless hard, but
where the present proprietor of The Call
leads there are no "frozen ridges of the
Alps," as the bard of Avon puts it â long
or short ridges at that â formidable enough
to balk the victor at the winning-post.
A WORLD'S RECORD.
San Luis Obispo Tribune.
The San Francisco Call made a new
world's record for phenomenal editions in
its Christmas number and established a
new and incontrovertible claim to leader
ship among the great metropolitan jour
nals of the country. It was a demonstra
tion that great bulk wa3 not necessarily
destructive of excellence in quality; that
to multiply volume it is not necessary to
use shoddy and refuse filling. We would
say that the edition had reached the
standard of a nigh-class magazine, but
that, alter all, might be a dubious comDli
ment. The Christmas number of The Calli
was read. That is higher praise. Such
editions are usually only "hefted" and
glanced at askance.
OF INTEREST TO ALL.
Santa Rosa Republican.
The Christina? edition of the San Fran
cisco Call is a big thing every way it may
be considered. The paper consists of fifty
two seven-column pages. These pages are
filled with the best thoughts of the best
writer? of California. Most of the varied
and numerous industries and advantages
of the State are treated at considerable
length. Nearly a hundred writers contrib
ute special articles over their own signa
tures. The paper is, indeed, a great jour
nalistic feat, but the editor can scarcely
expect many people to read it through.
There is too much of it for busy people
who have a living to earn. At the same
time every one will find something of spe
cial interest to himself in this great news
paper.
ENDEAVORS TO DO JUSTICE.
Grass Valley Telegraph.
The San Francisco Call of December 25
is a special edition an:l in many respects a
good one. The special articles by" many
of the leading men of this State on the
particular line in which they are interested
is a cood feature. But the article about
Nevada County's schools does not do
justice. We are entitled to more credit
than is gi,ven, and if left to the County
Superintendent to write the article no doubt
would have been more creditable. Nevada
County has always been the banner min
ing county of the State, yet we are hardly
mentioned in an article by the State Min
eralogist. We believe The Call was con
scientious in its endeavors to do justice,
but in its write-ups in some instances
there is considerable lacking.
OF A HIGH ORDER OF MERIT.
FrÂ«ano Expositor.
The Call's Christmas number of fifty
two pages is a paper that reflects unÂ«
bounded credit on "all concerned in its
publication. It has several very valuable
papers from men who can speak with,
authority on subjects which they write
about, and they are men whose views con*
cerninc matters affecting the welfare and
prosperity of the coast are worth attention
from everybody who is capable of exerting
a healthful influence on public opiniop.
And Ihe Call also had abundance of
splendidly entertaining reading for those
who read to while away an idle hour or to
learn what some of the brightest writers in
the State have to say anent the Christmas
holiday. Taking the contents of tha
Christmas number of The Call altogether
they were of a very higu order of merit.
IT WAS A "STCXXER."
Ukiah Herald.
The Christmas edition of the San Fran*
Cisco Call was a 'â¢stunner," loaded witlt
the best selected statistics to be derived
from the history and progress of our won
derful State. Every page from the lirst to
the fifty-second, was filled with matter of
the most importanceâ facts that arÂ«
backed up by preponderance of evidence.
Every article was from the pen of men
who are familiar with the great State of
Cali/ornia, and more especially those from
each county. Every reader in California
should forward this edition of Thb Cai.u
to a friend in the East. It will bring to
us a larger population and one whom we
will welcome as a needed addition. It is
not a boom sheet, but one devoted to the
interests of our glorious State and the kind
that places us before the people as we are.
WORTH A DOLLAR TO SEND EAST.
San Luis Obispo Reasoner.
The San Francisco Call publishes a
fifty-two-page Christmas number. Unlike
many such efforts on the part of the daily
press, it is not altogether an advertising
scheme padded out with trashy reading
matter. The articles are carefully pre
pared by well-known men and women of
the State, who sign their names to their
writings. There are more than a hundred
of these, and the range of subjects is wide,
not only including matters concerning the
industries and advantages of different secÂ«
tions of the Htate, but treating of economi
cal, scientific, literary, artistic and other
subjects. It is a most valuable production
and reflects credit upon the energetic
editor and his loyal corps of workers. The
price is only 5 cents, but it is worth a dol
lar to send to your friends who are inter*
ested in California matters.
MOST POPULAR DAILY.
San Francisco El Comercio.
This great and influential paper of the
dnily press came forth on Christmas morn*
ing with a mammoth edition of fifty-two
pages of varied and interesting matter
and illustrations. In fact, the edition re
ferred to is a veritable encyclopedia, in
which solid articles on gcientiric.iudustriai,
commercial, agricultural and statistical sub
jects as well as on those of art and banks
appear, showing great enterprise on the
part of our esteemed contemporary. Thk
Call undoubtedly has taken the lead
among the great newspapers published in
this City, and has become the most popular
and creditable one west of the Rockies, aa
well as one of the leading among the
many excellent ones published in the
United States. We send greeting to Thi
Call and our compliments and good wishes
to its intelligent and enterprising editor
and proprietor, Charles M. Shortridge.

City Property and Golden Gate Aye
Due Residences Ordered to
Be Sold.
The public arc well aware that the high ,
rate of taxation on property has been the
rate of dividends to de- |
r> in i iie savings banks. That there
should be in the face of this reduced in
come a greater number of accounts
opened than closed in the savings banks j
when the reverse is usually true at this i
time of the year is a matter of great j
surprise.
In the present age of the world the 'â 
banks are the natural custodians of money, ]
and unless circulating medium disappears j
the bank will have the money of a commu
nity, whether it belongs to one person or
another, and let there be ever so much ac- J
tivity in real estate the amount of the
banks' deposits will not be affected. If the
purchaser withdraws the seller will deposit â 
the same amount.
M.mey nominally in a savings bank is ;
really in active circulation, because no j
Dank* actually ke> p> any more money on j
hand than is necessary for safety. Money I
withdrawn iroin a savings bank, unless
ted in a commercial bank, goes out I
of circulation, its i:^e being lost to tne i
community. N\ ither business men nor
ss r.p n bury th< ir monej in the
â  :. r.M'l U'ktiivi iv few deposit with '
.-aft; deposit com] anies, hence it follows
that i >1 be in the ! antes of
one cL ther. It is not a cause for
repret, :i? the mission of banks is to em
ploy the money under their control. Banks
- boarders of money.
em i his way is ii'>n<' by
individuals. The money deposited in a
s;tving> bank is }>ut to a variety of uses
and i. d to real estate. a> some

Ferent natures.
that the accumulation of money
in the - i ca ise of inaction in the
real estate market is not true. A real
e>tate market is created by a demand for
- of business and residences in addi
tion t sting, and there can be no
active market unless business revives and
expands so as to demand extra accommo
dations.
WHAT THI? CITY MUST DO.
Under this caption Thomas Ma tree in j
the last issue of his Real Estate Circular i
says:
Of one thing th:~ City may be sure: It will ]
have to put Its f ler 1 the wheel, I
much more money, and exhibit much more en
terprise than it has hitherto done. Ail honor j
â  to it for the San Jonquin Valley and !
Corral Hollow roÂ«<ls, mit t!:.j>e roads, when j
finished, will almost at or.cc emphasize the
er collateral ent projects.
Why In the name <.>f common sense should
a and Seattle, all
i pass this City propor- ;
Fin â¢â in., terprtee? The loss result- :
iii vacancies and reduced rents of whole- ;
factories and warehouses in this :
< Ity during th*.- past year alone, would, |
U paved, have pm at least half a dozen i
productive enterprises on their feet.
Heal estate generally will not improve in
rents or values until we eern the advance. In
past times, wheu we had no real competition,
railroads let the whole world in to
snatch our trale away; when San Francisco
was the only city on the coast, and before it
became the profit and the spiteful policy of ]
the Southern Pacific to form a!l its coml'ina
tiona tor the injury of this City, one might buy
a lot anywhere with the certainty that, with- I
out effort on the owner's part.it would cer
tainly increase rapid'y in value. Then we
could, and did, Mleep and grow rich. But now
If a city grows it must be sa tikeâ wide awakeâ i
vigilant and be incessant in its efforts at each :
of its doorways to secure r.e* trade and in
crease its commerce. Push, work and willing- â 
ness to spend money must take the place of 'â 
the old sleety way- of u.e past. We have no j
other choice if we are to go ahead.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
One of the most important sales of real
estate ever held in San Francisco, and one
which will without doubt attract the atten
tion of all those seeking fo- solid invest- '
ments, will take place on Thursday, the
2>kl inst.. at the salesroom of Baldwin &
Hammond, 10 Montgomery street. On
that day there will be sold at public auc
tion, by order of the Pacitic Improvement
Company, over $500,000 worth of property,
in subdivisions both large and small.
The property on the southwest corner of
Fifteenth and Valencia streets, 140x295
feet, will be offered, and as it is centrally
located and bound to increase in value, it
cannot but prove a splendid investment.
There is also 150 feet frontage on Valencia
street, corner of Hermann, which is one of
the most valuable business properties in
this City to-day, and also 250 feet on Mis
sion street, near Twelfth, wnich is desir
able for both business and residence sites.
The most valuable property and the peer
of them all is the 280 feet frontage on
Market street, near Twelfth, which as an
investment will prove a veritable bonanza
in a few years, owing to its location.
The property on Twelfth street, near
Market, will also be sold, as well as 1000
feet frontage on adjacent streets, which is
all valuable from the fact that it is coming
business property and is also desirable for
dwellings. Another very choice lot to be
offered is the northwest corner of Seven
teenth and Castro streets, which is excel
lent business property. Also rive residence
lots on Waller street, near Stanyan, each
27:6x85 feet, will be offered.
Nearly all of the above property is yield
ing a ground rental. Some of it is under
lease for short periods at low rents, which
can be increased, as most cf the leases will
soon expire.
The terms are only 25 per cent cash and
the balance in one, two an I three years.
One of the features of Yon Rhein & t'o.'s
auction next Thursday is a portion of Mis
sion block 48, which Em lon ra to the City
and which is sold under order of Mayor
Stttro and the Board of Supervisors. The
lot is one of a number of pieces reclaimed
from what was formerly Mission Creet,
wh icli, since they are now of no benefit to
the <"ity, should "be disposed of so that the
proceeds of sales may ro into the treas
ury. The auctioneers are considering
whether or not to offer the entire piece i:i
one parcel or subdivide it into four or
more iots. There is a large piece at Seven
teenth and Folsom streets which brings in
a rental of $184 monthly ; also flats on Page
street, one block and a'half from Market,
bringing in $'<> per month: a piece at Clay
and Stockton streets, rented to Chinese
at $187 per month; and dwellings in
various locations renting at $16 to $50 a
mo:ith. Among tne vacant pieces is a
tine Richmond corner.
To twenty of the excursionists who ar
rivfd during the last fortnight E. K. Alsip
& Co. have sold land in the Fair<>aks
colony, Sacramento County, in tracts of
two and a half acres to twenty acrrs, and
they all paid deports. Others are daily
coming from the East with a view of pur
chasing, and these agents exrect a large
party in a few days. Those who do not
purchase in this tract are scattering over
the northern portion of the State, and in
many instances have purchased elsewhere.
Central California is having more general
advertisement in the East than at any
period in its history, and the literature
ihat is being distributed is well worth the
perusal of Californians as well as Eastern
men, as it is the choicest of the kind ever
issued, giving facts aud figures bound to
be convincing.
Sales reported by A. M. Speck & Co. are
as follows:
Cottage and lot 22x112 on the east line of
Diamond street, near Twenty-third, $2200;
lot 34x137*6 with two-story house on the
south line of Jackson street, near Leaven
worth, .*4000: two modern fiats, 1024 Shot
well street, lot 25x122:6, $5000; cottage on
Columbia Heights and lot 25x110, $500: two
lots on Clay street, near Spruce, 25x127:6, for
.Â«! 900 each; an improved ranch of 160 acres
north of Livermore, to W. J. Lawrey,
Mrs Frank Mahon and Mrs. Dr. Joseph
\ Fescia, the daug ters of the late Miles D.
Sweeney, have purchased for the sum of
$25,000, through Easton, Eldridge & Co.,
! the Tillmann residence on the north line
! of Washington street, 137:6 feet west of
! Gough, and lot 65x127 :SV+ feet. These
i new owners are contemplating making ex
| tensive improvements in the same to cost
; several thousand dollars.

; Baldwin & Hammond:

i feet west of Twenty-fifth avenue, size 25x100.

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Champion Donnelly and T, I- . Bonnet
Defeat Champion Kilgallon and
R. I.im-llrtll.
Handball players were out in full force
yesterday and the courts were crowded.
The jolly banqueters had all recovered and
there was in consequence an unusually
large attendance at the Occidental court.
The attraction of the day was the game ;
between M. J. KilÂ»allon, the Denver cham- '
pion, and R. Linchan and Amateur Cham
pion P. T. Donnelly and T. P. Bonnet. ;
The riit> was mo-t exciting, and was finally
won by the good judgment and canning
tricks of the popular amateur champion. ,
On Wednesday night KiJgallon and Nea- !
ion will meet Lmehan, the overhand
swiper, and hi? partner, John Feeney.
At the San Francisco court two events \
roused t!if' i*r:>:iH'St excitement. M. I>;1
--icin :iiid (t. Hntchinson played against J.
Condon and \V. Williams, the Bostonian,
and won the final by a narrow majority.
J. Nelson and J. I'rendergast were de
feated by J. Siattery and p. Kelly in a
close finish. The talk at this court was the
! unexpected defeat of Phil Ryan, the genial
! proprietor, by Dan O'Brien in two straight
; games. To the surprise of everybody
! O'Brien played all round Ryan, and won
with the L-reatest ease.
The event of the day at the Union court
was a game between John teeny and Terry
McManos and J. Murray and Tim Jordan, :
; which was won by ihe former team. l>.iv:il
| C. Martin and Ed Turtle played against P. ;

KING PERATA'S VIRTUE
Looks After His Subjects Even
When They Are Behind
the Bars.
BENEFICENCE OF POLITICS.
Some of the Disgraceful Conditions
Now Existing at the City
Hall.
Oakland Officf Sah Francisco Call,)
:. roadway. Jan. lL\ [
lUrchi Ferata. the king of the fish eang
in West Oakland and a leader in politics
at section, has one redeeming feature.
He does not forget his friends, even when
they are removed f-om their field of action
by the law and placed behind prison bars.
There ure now more of the infamous gang
being boarded by the county than at any
previous time. Juries have not been so
cental in the police court of late as
they used to be, and as a result the police
have received some encouragement to
break up the organization. But although
lost to sight the king cherishes their mem
Â« ry and sees that their wants are not
neglected. He makes periodical vi3its to
the City Prison and County Jail and sees
that they are supplied with all that the
rules will permit them to have.
As Barchi has never been Known to have
a regular trade and has frequently been
threatened with arrest for vasranry it is a
surprise to the officials that his exchequer
never seems to bo afflicted with a deficit.
Two weeks atro Barchi was found guilty of
battery by a jury and took an appeal.
Such a proceeding requires a substantial
bond, but bonds are always on hand when
the king or his friends get into trouble,
and Barchi is yet in a position where he
can be of use to his friends. The king evi
dently finds a charm of potent influence in
West Oakland politics.
Each week something develops that
proves the necessity of a city hall com- |
men=urate with the size of the city. A few
weeks ago a man was taken there from the
Receiving Hospital with a cracked skull,
and he died ten minutes after he was
found to be seriously ill. Before that a
twelve-year-old boy pushed away the de
cayed top of his cell and walked out into
freedom. Last night a man applied for a
night's lodging, and this morning he was
almost at the point of death. It was dan
gerous to remove The old man, but the
comfortless patrol wagon had to convey
the sufferer to the Receiving Hospital, as
there is no hospital ward in the prison.
Last week the Mayor and some other offi
cials made an inspection of the city prison,
and it was so noisome that they were glad
to get out without catching a fever.
Periodically the prison officials are taken
sick and have to lie off for a few
weeks to tight pneumonia and malaria.
Not long since it was discovered ,
that a sewer had broken and the leakage i
of months had formed a large cesspool beÂ»
Death the floor. These and many other
lamentable features disgrace the prison.
All the municipal departments upstairs
are no better. The Treasurer has to keep
his money in a bank vault; the room
where the important meetings of the Board
of Works are held will not hold a dozen
chairs; the Cky Engineer was driven out
ot the hall two >ears ago and is located in
a business block on Broadwaf ; the Health
Officp is in a little shanty at" the back of
the City Hall, and under r.o circumstances
could a dozen people attend their meet
ings; the Free Library building, which
contains a valuabfe library, is such an old
rookery that no insurance could
be obtained upon it if it were
not for the fact that it joins
the Fire Department. Tne Auditor's of
iice is about the size of a candy-stand and
for a long while there has been work for
two police courts. For several weeks Judze
"Wood has been trying a case on one side
the bench while the prosecuting attorney
has been securing a jury on the other.
In 1573 the old hall causrht h're and was
only partially rebuilt, as it was considered
then to be inadequate to the needs of the
growing municipality. Eighteen years
have passed by and no improvement has
been made. The old barn is as unstable
as the politics that are manipulated be
neath old Dr. Merritt's clock. If it should
ever takÂ« fire again nothing could save it,
and the unhappy wretches who are in the
cells in the basement prison would stand
a good chance of being roasted alive.
Although the ordinance forbidding the
holding of public meetings on the streets
has been repealed for over a month no ad
vantage has been taken of the restored
freedom. Before its passage the streets
were impassable on certain corners every
ni^ht. but after a few arrests all the
ranters gathered in the city park and re
mained there. They spoiled the park, it is
true, before the ordinance was repealed,
but the habit of eoing to the bandstand
and discussing the calamities of the day
has become so chronic with the regular
habitues that they stili go, although the
bie electric-iient has been cut off. They
meet there yet. and although the glaring
t-treet corners are again available to them
they prefer to talK and orate in the dark
ness. The same crowd that was birterly
opposed to the "curbing of their right of
free speech" now refuse to take advantage
of its restoration. Their position in the
matter is as inexplicable as their argu- !
ments. 8. W. B.
MCRDKKtR HILL TALKS.
He I. lames Himself for Most of the Do

OAKLAND, Cat,., Jan. 12.â Benjamin L.
Hill, who shot his wife last night, was as
rool to-day as when he gave himself up,
five minutes after the murdf-r. He says
that he lias never been in a position to
support his wife and child since they were
married, and that he seemed to bo pursued
by bad luck. The immediate cause of the

ami they show that she was not the faith

Hill Lived at Suisun.
SUI6UN, Cal., Jan. 12.â Quite a gloom
i at SuLsun to-day when the news
of the murder of Mrs. Acnes Hill was re-
Ben Hill, who slew his wife,
iraa well known here. He came to Suisun
', and by reason of being a good base
ball player a position was secured for mm
as bartender. In this capacity he con
ducted himself well, and so much confi
dence wu reposed in his integrity that a
triend backed him up and started him in a
respectable saloon known as the "World's
1 air." Hiil did an excellent business, and
could have made a fortune, but unfortu
n.uely he acquired expensive habits, find
spent t<>o freely for his own good. After
leaving the saloon business Hill remained
around town for some time, and failed to
lind employment. Leaving his wife nere
he wont to Montana and eecured a position
on the railway.
He returned last spring and obtained
work in Oakland, whither his wife also
weat. While here, it is reported, they lived
comfortably together. The relations of
tne unfortunate woman are frantic with
grief, and much sympathy is expressed for

FAIR FOR HEBREW HOME
The Hebrew Benevolent Society Will
Give a Grand Benefit for the
Home and Asylum.
The annual meeting of the Hebrew Be
nevolent Society for the care of the aged
inlirm took place yesterday at the home
on Lombard street. Ths reports of the
different committees were read and gave
much satisfaction.
President Samuel Polack's report states
that notwithstanding the Legislature had
repealed the law granting aid to pub
lic charities for the aged inlirm and not
withstanding a lack of assistance from the
outside the society bus gained in finances
and is able to conduct the orphan asylum
and home on a satisfactorj' basis.
The report further states that more per
sons could be accommodated if the society
had a larger building and that the matter
| was still being deliberated by the mem
bers whether to build a new home or alter
' and enlarge the one already occupied.
The cost for tne past year of maintain
ing the home was $2417 26 or $201 44 per
month. The income was $3004 47, this
being from all sources. The net gain for
i the year was $1542 20 or $21 88 more than
last year, and there was a bank account to
the credit of the society $1420 32 larger.
The mortgage of $42'>O comes due next
November, and tne president suggested
that the board be empowered to take any
legal steps which may be necessary at that
time.
The directors elected are: S. Polack,
president; Mrs. M. Kaskell, secretary;
i .Thomas Cohen, treasurer; Philip Fahian,
j 11. Lewis, tt\ Wise, I. D. Martin and Miss
i A. Levy. The new board of managers are:
Mesdames Mamlock, Plato, King, Lich
tenstein. Davis, C. Levy. M. Correnson, H.
I Berliner, 'Spiegelman and T. Nathan.
A committee of live was appointed to
revise the society's constitution.
The matter was taken up of making ar
rangements for holding a fair for the ben
etit of the society, which will take place in
about two months.
The members of the fair committee ap
pointed are the board of lady manacers,
under the chairmanship of Sirs. H. Ber
liner, assisted by the following gentlemen:
11. Davis, A. If. Plate, N. T. L.yon and
I'avis Harris. The chairman of the gen
tlemen's committee is Mrs. Lichtenstein.
ALAMEDA REPUBLICANS
They Have Decided to Affiliate
With the State Execu
tive Council.
An Alameda Man's Patent of Which
Great Things Are Expected.
Installation Party.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 12.â At the meet
ing of the Alameda RepubJican Club Satur
day night the decision was finally mada to
send representatives to the State Executive
Council, a matter that v.as held in abey
ance for two months. When the matter
iirst came up it was opposed by some of
the members because nothing was known
about the Executive Council, ami while
the matter was put over the secretary was
instructed to write to the chairman of the
State Central Committee for information.
The reply to the letter of inquiry fully in
dorsed the State council, and so the Ala
meda club decided at once to send dele
gates to it. The gentlemen selected as
representatives were Alex Mackie, H. A.
Thompson and J. L. Fields. After the
disposal of this business Judge R. B.
Carpenter addressed the club on Republi
can issues and prospects and was warmly
applauded. Eleven new members were
elected. An amendment to the by-laws
was adopted. The clause requiring the
names of applicants for membership to l)e
referred to the executive committee was
stricken out. The membership is now
about 300.
Installation Party.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 12.â An installa
tion party was eiven Saturday night at
Odd Fellows' Hall, when the newly
elected officers of Fair Oaks Rebekah
Lodge were formally placed in their re
spective positions. After the ceremonies
of installation were over there was a mus
ical ana literary programme. An over

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MOSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1896.
ARE SOCIAL CLUBS EVIL ?
Two Notable Alameda Sermons
on the Subject of So-Called
"Man-Traps."
CHKISTIAN AND METHODIST.
Revs. Bovard and Morgan Take Oppo
site Views on a Topic of Much
Public Interest.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 13. âEl Nido
Club attended the services of the First
Christian Church in a body last night to
listen to a sermon by Minister Morgan on
clubs and churches.
In his preliminary remarks Mr. Morgan
said that while during the past week much
had been said concerning tne moral condi
tion of Alameda, he seriously doubted if
what had been said would materially alter
existing conditions. He then continued:
My private opinion is this: After three
months' personal experience and observation
I would say candidly, if asked, there is no
better place in which to rear a family than
Alameda.
There are opportunities here afforded to be
either wise or foolish, moral or immoral, carnal
or spiritual.
My experience in life so far has been that
the worst place imaginable in which to rear a
boy is in a community where there are no
"man-traps" or pitfalls, and where churches
control the polities of the town.
To illustrate what 1 mean 1 will cite an in
stance I have observed in this Plate. There is
a town in this State where no liquor is allowed
to be sold and where card-playing and theaters
are prohibited by law. What is the moral
status of the young men of that town? Are
they better than ihe young men of Alameda?
Are they all church-goers? By no means.
During the yrar that is past the church that
from the beginning has looked after the moral
and prudential welfare of the community has
been shaken to its very center by a fearful
Bcandal involving many church members.
Time and again have I heard mothersjsay, "Oh,
that I could get my boys away from this fear
ful place?"
Withal it would seem if a young man is a
Christian and has principle he is as safe in
Alameda as he would be on the farm; aye, and
safer, too, if the churches were all Christ in
tended his churches to be.
It seems to me that one great trouble with
the church to-day is we have too many small
editions of Dr. l'arkhurst. Scarcely a hamlet
but can boast a "PRrkhurst." Social reformers
are tho?e who open their mouths rather than
their Bibles, and cry aloud regardless of sense
or reason. It arrested for slander they hide be
hind some technicality and thus escape being
punished. Such men aie sure to bring con
tempt on the ministry.
If more is an institution on the face of the
earth to-day that needs reformation, or rather
a restoration, it is the church. There is room
for hundreds, yea thousands, of such reform
ers as Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Campbell and
Herron in our pulpits. Oh," for men to-day
who will cry aloud and spare not the follies
and sins of the church! The church to-dny is
but a shadow of what it was in the days of 'the
aj'O>tles.
The church is looked on by the world ns the
representative of Christ. But how does it
represent him? Does it feed the hungry, heal
the sick, care for the oppressed and preÂ»cn the
glad tidings to the poor? Do the ministers go
about doing good? These were the proofs
Jesus gave of his divinity. If we can give the
same proofs to the world to-dey Jet us shout
for joy, and I believe the club men will shout
with us. If we cannot do these things let us
not pose as critics even of saloon-keepers until,
in the language of Christ, we have cast out
the beam from our own eye.
Let us face this matter fairly, brethren.
Wnat are the churches doing to provide places
of rest and entertainment for the young men
of our town? Where can a young "man go to
spend a social evening? What lire we uoing
for the Btranger within our gate, and shnil we
who are doing so little criticize the Clubs?
Verily, the children of the club are wiser in
thc-ir gen. ration than the children of light.
We should cast our eyes inward before cast
ing them outward. We are cursed with a
curse. The young men are notin the church,
nor do the common people hear us gladly. We
must return to Jerusalem end sit at the feet of
the Christian if we are to be iishcrs of men.
The churches must throw awsy their conflic- j
tion, creeds and most of their orthodox thi ol
ogy before they will be ablo to do much more
than frighten the fishes away and curse them
for not biting at their artificial flies.
If the Master were in Alameda the common
people would hear him gladly. The publican
and sinner would feel they had a friend, and
the members of El Xido, while they might not
become his disciples, would have a profound
respect for the gentle peasant who went around
doing good. The religion* bigot and the hypo
crite would hate him as of old, nail the holy
hands and feet to the cross and put to silence
the eloquent tongue that told them so plainly
that instead of being children of God they be
longed to their father, the devil.
Park-Street Methodist Church.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 13.â At the Park
street Methodist Church last evening the
subject of Rev. F. D. Bovaru's sermon was
"Charity" ; but there was a prelude, whose
subject was "Man-traps Explained." Tins
was understood to be an elaboration of a
prelude by the same gentleman last Mon
day night on "Man-traps," which caused
considerable stir. The charges and state
ments were sensational in tho extreme.
The announcement of a second prelude
last night on the same subject drew an
enlarged and interested audience. The
prelude was as follows:
The trap is the most cunning of all the de
vices of man. Every irap is constructed on
three invariable principles.
Firstâ Secrecy. It must hide all its dangerous
qualities ; in fact, the better the trap the less it
appoars to be a trap. It must seem to be not
only harmless but helpful. Tho cunning of a
trap is in the perfect seclusion of its real de
sign. "Walk into my parlor Eaid the spider to
the Hy; it's the prettiest little parlor that over
you did spy," represents the genius of the trap
principle.
The second. principle is the alluring power of
the trap. The real design of the trap mutl not
only be hidden, bat the external conditions
must be attractive to the victims. The natural
instincts of the victim are considered. It is
sometimes constructed to appear as a shelter;
it may appeal to hunger, it in all cases seeks to
gratify somewhat the. victim. The more per
fectly it appeals to the particular natural in
stincts and desires of the animal the more per
fect the trap.
The third principle of a trap is power to see,
seize and hold its \ictim. The intelligence of
the victim must be overreached and his
strength must be overcome, and he must find
himself in the trap before he knows there is
any trap. â 
The principles reduced mean this: The de
sign of the trap, the bait of the trap and the
triggers of the trap. Given these principles,
construct a man-trap. Having decided what
kind of men we want to trap, we will select the
location and the general conditions. If we
want to catch tho poor iellow who is already
in the ruins of his character, these old victims
that have the web of habit already about their
feet, we will open a saloon. The minister and
temperance people will assail the trappers, but
the very name of a saloon will keep them
away. This is a bad man-trap, we all know.
It is really more of a mill than a trap. It
grinds up the bones and pulverizes the old
fragments of manhood after society has cast
them out. - . : -^.-
We must not mistake a mill for a trap. The
principles are essentially different. Society is
ihe real trapping ground. Society must be "de
ceived. The name of the trap must be some
thing that society will receive as tolerable.
The rules of the trap must be such that society
will accept. Now observe both the name and
the rules are intended to deceive society. The
transactions are under lock and key. The one
side of the code which is turned toward so
ciety reads, "No gambling," but behind the
lock and key it means little else but petty gam
bling, playing for cigars, drinks and tickets en
titling the winners to liquor, and it often
means the last cent the poor victim possesses.
It i.s not only gambling but fastens a ialaehooil
on society by changing the truth into a lie,
which is the very grandmother of all lies, tho
priina materia of all deception. This is not
only taught within the walls of the trap but
on the Ktreets and in the newspapers that pre
tend to defend these traps. When any at
tempt is made to expose these traps then the
rules are held up in the face oi society with
the moral side up. Thix not only strangles the
morals of the victim by teaching and implant
ing a falsehood in his moral tissue, but at
tempts to put out the light of his sun at mid
day. These rules against gambling are merely
to hide the design of their traps.
Now, what has been said of the rule about
gambling is true of drunkenness. The under
lying principle of this rule is that men can
drink and not get drunk, but both reason and
experience forbid society to accept that prin
ciple. There is a natural capacity in the hu
man system for alcohol. This is cioarlv steu
in the case of savages who crave it from the
first taste. If it be said that this natural ca
pacity forms a reasonable ground for the use of
alcohol, the answer is, man has a natural ca
pacity for sensuality anfi ail kinds of physical
Immoralities, but no intelligent man would
think of advocating their indulgence to any
extent except as he himself was a depraved
moral vagabond.
The absolutely certain mechanical effect of
alcoho.' is paralysis. It attacks the liner tissues
first, because they are more sensitive. The
moral nature is affected first. The young man,
bashful and timid, even awkward, is informed
by these trappers that a little stimulant will
help him over It. lie drinks and is am axed at
himself. His tongue is loose and his self-con
straint gone. What lias happened I.'1 .' Simply
this: He has lost the line self-introspection
which made him bashful and was indicative of
a fine moral nature.
He has suffered a stroke of moral paralysis,
and the animal in him has come forward one
step. All this taik which he thought so fine
made the cheeks of his sober friend burn with
slmme by listening to his garrulous nonsense.
This principle of drinking without getting
drunk is a deception. A rule against drunk
enness which allows continued drinking is the
very genius of the tra;>.
Mow, we have seen how cunningly the trap
per has hidden the trap behind a society name
and behind society rules, which, behind a loci:
and key, have an interpretation essentially
different from that given uuon the streets.
We will now explain how men are led into
these traps. His majesty, the great man-tiap
per, puts into the heart of some tcenial man,
himself in the trap, to select a" victim. A
young nmn, a cleric or young attorney or
young dentist or physician just coming into
the city, may be selected. He is invited by the
trapper to visit the trap. On the way the
moral (?) of the trap is explained, both inside
and outside. The victim is shown the elegant
surroundings and iinaily led to the bar, which
is blushingly explained as a legal sideboard
under the beneficent laws of the State.
if the young man refuses liquor lie is asked if
lie will have a lemonade. If he declines he 1s
asked if he will have a cigar. If he declines
again he is asted to play a game of whist or
billiards. If he declines all the trapper is
foiled for the time. Then a low grade of enter
tainment is provided. Invitations are sent
out. The man in the moon turns his face from
the sight. All this comes under the strict rules
of the trap. The three great rules of the man
trap are : Xo gambling, no drunkenness, no re
ligion. The first two are intended to deceive
society: the third is to be strictly observed in
the trap. There are pood reasons" for this last
wholesome rule. It keeps out the troublesome
questions of conscience that at times bother
the members of the trap. Men of the world
want to see things as they are. and conscience
is a thing that the man of one world cannot
have.
QUAKERS HOLD A REVIVAL
Rev. J. H. Douglas and Evange
list Mrs. Lida Romick Ad
vancing the Cause.
Preliminaries of the Carnot Debate.
University to Reopenâ The Bond
Question to Be Discussed.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 12.â The re
vival meetings of the Quaker church
which are now in progress at Ashley Hall,
Souih Berkeley, are attracting more than
ordinary attention, it being the first series
of revivals ever held in Berkeley. From a
society of twenty-tv.-o organized several
months ago the church in Berkeley has
grown so rapidly that now they have a
membership ol over sixty.
Mrs. A. W. Nayior is the regular pastor
of the church, it being one of the doctrines
of the Quaker society that women have a
like franchise with the men in all matters
appertaining to the work of their de
nomination. The present evangelistic
services are being hold under the direction
of Key. J. 11. Douglas, State superinten
dent of the work of the Quaker church,
mill Mrs. Lida Romick. an evangelist from
Ohio.
A large audience attended the service
this morning to hear Mrs. Romink speak.
Her theme was "Christian Holiness,"
taken from Hebrews xii: 1-4.
She dwelt at some length on the afflic
tions which come to mankind in the daily
walks of life, and with what hardship
these are borne. "I have made up my
mind," >a;d she, "that affliction is good
for us, because it make? us to seek out
Christianity and the holiness that comes
with it.
"Some professing Christians seem to try
to get along with as little religion as pos
sible, and still maintain their claim" on
heaven. Some people seem to think that
they will be juSt as well off if they repent
at the eleventh hour as if they had taken
Christianity from their childhood. This
is a delusion.
"Poverty, however abject it may be, will
never close the doors of heaven against
the holy and righteous. It means some
thing to be a Christian in this world of sin
and ridicule and contumely. God knows
how to keep those of his children who
have sought out holiness from worldly at
tachments on the one hand and from
coldness and fanaticism on the other."
It is a peculiarity of the ministers of the
Quaker church not to announce the sub
jects of their addresses before the time for
delivery, but to wait until the spirit moves
them to speak. No manuscripts fire al
lowed in the pulpit. All addresses are ex
tempore. They claim that the foundation
of their church is perfcctlv orthodox.
The Quakers do not believe in war under
any circumstances, nor do they ever take
an oath. The basis of their church is
practically the same as that of the Meth
odist. The theory of foreordination is to
them nothing but folly. Children are born
into the church ; that is, they have a birth
right membership. Their covornment ia
purely democratic. The officers of the
church are ministers, elders and overseers.
The duties of elders correspond to those of
other churches, while it is the duty of the
overseers to look after the oeneral conduct
of the members. Should there be trouble
in the church it is hrst referred to the body
of the overseers. But few church ordi
nances are practiced by them.
Evangelists Douglas and Mrs. Romick
will continue their work at Berkeley dur
ing the coming week.
Clans at St. >larlt's Conflrmed.
BERKELEY, Cai.., Jan. 12.â Bishop
Nichols continued a class of eight at St.
Mark's Episcopal Church this evening.
This makes nineteen who have been con
firmed in the parish since the rectorship
of Rev. George E. Swan, which began three
months ago. Prior to the confirmation
ordinances were administered, and Bishop
Nichols delivered an address appropriate
to the Epiphany season. Special music
was rendered by the choir, which consisted
of an anthem by Mrs. Jame3 Lewis, en
titled "Angela Ever Bright and Fair,"
Handel; offertory, Violin solo, "Schubsrt's
Serenade." by J. S. Fife.
Rev. Mr. Swan is organizing a vested
choir of twenty boys and ten men, which
will make their appearance for the hrst
time on the second Sunday in February.
Thcj have been training twice weekly for
the past two months. This will be' the
first vested choir ever had in Berkeley.
Thechancelwill be much enlarged and a
new choirroom built for their accommo
dation.
Cnrnot Medal Preliminaries.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 12.â The pre
liminaries of the University of California
students for places on the Carnot medal
debating team will take place next
Wednesday evening in Stiles' Hall. Fif
teen contestants have thus far tiled their
names with Professor C. M. Gayley, who
has the affairs of the debate in hand. The
subject for the preliminary contest is,
"Whether the Present Total Separation of
the Legislative and Executive in France is
Conducive to the Stability of the Repub
lic."
Professor Gayley stated to-day that the
interest in debating manifested by the stu
dents this college year is vastly greater
than at any other time since ho has been
connected with the university. He be
lieves that the success of Berkeley in last
year's inter-coilegiate debate has had
niuch to do with augmenting the interest
in debating among the University of Cali
fornia students.

e!ow, but Still 'lie trend, however meandering,
is toward the golden of perfection.â Rev.
\v. T. Veale, Presbyterian, Jacksonville, Fla.
BAD LITERATLT.K.
Kxciting and impure literature floods the I
land, which the younger people read and are
fascinated. The voluptuous Ufa is made the
Ideal, religion is scoffed at and vice enthroned.
The sensational papers â¢>.' the day make so
much of tne salacious details of an" unsavory
cuse and the sin ia so often made light of, even
made the occasion of efforts at liuinor.-Rev.
li. L. Miller, Episcopalian, Scrantou, i'a.
CHARITY.
It may he charity ior Rockefeller and Car
negie to erect living monuments i.i the shape
of universities and libraries, but it is not the
highest type, for their wealth is acquired by
doubtful metiindK. It is unchristian ior
moneyed men to seize large pieces of property
and profit by the Industry of others, without
outlay themselves. No man has a right to get
a monopoly upon anything.â Rev. 1. \v. Wil
liams, Latter Day Saint, Council Bluffs, lowa.
ABUXOCBACT.
Real aristocracy never shows itself. It never
makes tlie poor leol uncomfortable in its pres
ence, but the haughty manner and sneering
Iges "t shoddy aristocracy, and snow
t ; la t in society the scum goes to tlie top as
surely as the dregs sink to th>> bottom.â Key.
Dr. < hase, Methodist, Oswego, N. Y.
THKATFHS.
A great fault of the church of to-day lies in
the lact that it has held aloof from the theater,
from that great power for ennobling mankind.
I believe in the theater, and I think it is one of
the greatest powers in the world to-day for
bringing great truths home to the hearts of
men. The fault of its degradation is not in
itself, but in the hearts of men.â Rev. A. M. Mc-
Donald, Congregational Jacksonville, Fla.
ASSOCIATION'S.
Better have but one good companion than a
dozen evil associates. Associates often are the
cause of the downfall of a once pure young
man or women. Often the parents are godly,
but outside influences for the time crowd back,
all the early instructions in piety, and the
young fall. The preventive is better than the
cure, and a wise selection of associates will
prevent many sore regrets in after life. â Rev.
L. M. Zimmerman) Lutheran, Baltimore, Md.
AN AGE OF FADS.
This is an age of fads and follies, of meta
physical riddles and problematical ideals. The
psychological tendency of the human mind has
revived all the metaphysical notions of the
past, and they nave been animated with higher
life and must be met and mastered from a sci
entific standpoint.â Francisi K. Mason,
Brooklyn, N. Y.
DANCING.
We do not believe that the dance as indulged
In in these days possesses any element of holi
ness whatever. We believe tne dance is some
thing ihe church cannot control, and with
children who are allowed to dance it will be
come such a passion that they will fol.'ow it
from the private dance to places of question
able resort.â K. D. Carpenter, Rome, >'. Y.
VIRTUE.
Christ would have us exalt the value of
virtue. The woman is better in a calico dress
that has not bartered her virtue than the one
in silks and dazzling diamonds that has paid
the price of virtue to win them. The woman
that has fallen into sin has as much right to
be reinstated as man. â Rev. R. \V. Jameson,
Congregationalist, Sioux City, lowa.
rOVEUTY TO WEALTH.
The advance corps of wealth and business
ability that is moving through this century is
recruited and strengthened and made up from
men from the ranks of poverty. Stewart, the
"Humboldt of meichants," and Henry Clews,
tne "Shatespeare of bankers." are world-re
nowned geniuses who forged their reputations
and successes on the anvil of self-reliance and
energy.â Rev. C. A. Oakes, Reformed, Kinga
ton, X. Y.
IDEAL CHRISTIANITY.
Christianity is not a poor man's religion nor
a rich man's religion. It does not teach that
Lazarus was taken to heaven because he was
poor, but because he was pious, and that David
was sent to hell not because he was evil, but
because he was mean, Chnstiauity teaches
liberty, paternity, equality and that all of us
are brethren.â Rev. 1\ S. Henson. Baptist, Chi
cago, 111.
CHURCH GROWTH.
The growth of the church is not keeping pace
with the growth of the cities. In fifty of our
large cities statistics of six large denomina
tions show a 'ailing off of about 37 per cent. â
Rev. W. A. Stanton, Baptist, Pittsburg, Pa.
FOBSIGNKBg.
The danger to our Government lies in the
great cities which contain- from GO to 90 per
cent of foreigu-born population. A great dan
ger lies in placing the ballot in the hands of
these foreigners.â Rev. E. B. Patterson, Meth
odist, Jamestown, N. Y.
SIN.
Sin separates from God and goodness. Sin
perverts. Sin impoverishes. It strips its vic
tim. It has no mercy. Sin is a hard master.
The world offers pleasure, but not peace of
mind. Sin ever has a downward progress. â
Rev. James S. Chadwick, Methodist, Brooklyn,
N.-Y.
THE BREAD AND BUTTER PROBLEM.
Of all the woes of mankind famine is the
worst, and death by hunger dwarfs every
other form of dissolution. Hence the bread
and butter problem is at the root of ail our
political and social economies and specula
tions.âRev. A. J. Caniield, Universalist, Chi
cago, 111.
THE HOJIE.
Home should be a beautiful place, not a den
or nest like the habitation of beasts; not a hut
or wigwam like the abode of a savage; not an
establishment for ministering to vanity. Home
is just what woman makes it.â Rev. Charles
Scadding, Toledo, Ohio.
( HKIPTIANITY.
Christianity was not a result of the accident
of sin. It was God's eternal purpose that this
should be a Christian world. There is only
one right way to live for God and for man, and
tliat is the Christian way. â Key. George \V.
Brooks, Universalist. Dorchester, Mass.
EVOLUTION.
If evolution is true, then the Bible is not
true, and God did not make man in his own
ima^e; he did not create him holy, an'i hence
man never fell, and Jesus Christ of no use
because he died to save men from sin. â Rev.
A. S. Gum.ba.rt, Boston, Mass.
AMUSEMENTS.
Too many Christian people look upon amuse
ments narrowly if not fanatically, and would
apply to them the most heroic treatment.
Amusements are important, and religious men
sometimes tolerate them with a wry lace, but
iv no broad sweet way. They do not see ho.w
indispensable they are. The maker of a toy,
the writer of a play, the furnisher of a pure
amusement, are public benefactors. Amuse
ment, subordinate to the high and noble ends
of life, is more than a mental diversion; it
fortifies virtue.â Rev. Dr. Peabody, Rome, N. Y.
JUSTICE.
I hold to one law for all classes in society,
one law for both men and women. Any senti
ment which brands an unchaste woman and
elevates an unchaste man to high oflice, is a
vicious sentiment. Any sentiments which
brands as a criminal the man who sells liquor
and receives the man wno drinks it into the
best society, is. a vicious sentiment. Let justice
be done to all, though the heavens fall. The
whole business of dealing with moral ques
tions needs to be revolutionized.â Rev. B. i\
Eaton, Universalist. Worcester, Mass.
CATHOLICISM.
What right have we in America to be dis
turbed over this imported Irish question?
What right has our peaceful land to have the
tramp upon its bosom of armed men, ostensi
bly to free Ireland? We are told there are
three regiments now organixed and drilling
for tiiat purpose. Do noi be deceived. It will
be Cardinal Satolli or his successor who will
direct the movement 01 these troops, not in
Ireland, but in the United States. It might be
well to organize a few Protestant regiments in
the United States to iree Spain. God knows
6he needs freeing from something that has
held her down for 400 years. â Bishop Usher,
Reformed, Episcopalian, I'eoria, 111.

WHOM THE PRIEST BLAMES.
Rev. Charles W. Wendte Writes of
the Catholic Church and Civil
Government.
The Rev. Father Yorke, chancellor of
the Archdiocese of Ban Francisco, ad
dresses the following card to the public:
To the People of San Francitro: By an act iin
pxeoedented in journalism lam arraigned be
fore you by John I*. Young of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle as an instigator of riot an.l
violence. Through four columns of "editorial"
I am described as promoting a controversy
which is arousing ill feeling in" the community
and provoking collisions between citizens
who ought to live in peace and harmony. The
accusation is so grave that 1 cannot afford to
pace it over in silence. I owe it to my fellow
citizens and to myself to Meet the charge. In
one way and in one way only can the charge
be met". I must set forth without malice and
without fear the facts in the case. Let them
who are responsible bear the blame.
The present controversy is the outcome of an
as tation which now for five years lias been
carried on against the Catholic church. Vari
tcret societies of (livers origins ami of
divers appellations have spread through the
country â all for the purpose of antagonizing
Catholics. To the outside world these societies
â  own under the generic title of the A. P.
A. Their main if not their 6ole object is to
drive the members of the Catholic church from
business, irom social and from political life.
This organization has existed in San Fran
cisco some three years. In the spring of 1804
- considered advisable by its managers to
stir it into new life in anticipation of tiie ap
proaching elections. Accordingly a man who
nad been cast out of the Catholic church for
incorrigible drunkenness was hired to visit
this City. Accompanied by a female like unto
himself he came upon us.
The walls of the town were covered by postt
ers, every line of which was an insult againss
ali that Catholics hold dear. The sidewalk
were littered with pamphlets crammed with
unspeakable insinuations against Catholic
mother;, Catholic daughters and Catholic
wives.

for him to Lit up his voice. But John P.

words I know 1 am making a grave charge,

man in San Francisco, is responsible for the

shoulders, and not on mine, let the responsi

The first campaign oi the A. P. A. against
Cathol ed from the March of 1804
the â¢â¢lections. That campaign was
marked by two periods â tiie period of pulpit
agitation " and the period oi political work.
Tne pulpit agitation extended from March
until August, li Â«as opened by J. Q. a.
Henry, then pastor ot the First Baptist Church.
was taken up by C. 0. Brown of tiie First Con
gregational Church, and was carried on by
it, Dili* . Foster, rase and others.
The newspaper which did more than any
Other to advertise '.his campaign was the
Chronicle. For five months every Monday
morning its columns were filled with the false
accusations and with the obscene slanders
which characterize the utterances of the ora
tors of the A. P. A. I have made a careful
measurement of the space devoted by John P.
Young during this period to reproducing the
pu'pit attacks on Catholic^, and I find that it
amounts to nearly ten colums of solid print. 1
h6ve confined my measurement to the Mon
day edition. If I had time to search the other
editions carefully this large total would be
very much increased.
During all this time, when the town re
sounded to denunciations oi Catholic priests,
Catholic nuns, Catholiecitizens John P. Young
steadfastly refused to allow a Catholic to speak
in defense of his creed or of his people. When
in the month of April the Rev. C. O. Brown
was printing his manuscript in the Chronicle,
and thus spreading all over the coast the most
serious charges against the loyalty and patriot
ism of Catholics, I called on Mr. John P
Young with a letter. I considered it a hard
ship that week alterweek these charges should
go unrefuted. I knew that they were utterly
unfounded and I set forth the reasons for my
belief in writing. I offered it to Mr. John P.
Young and he absolutely and peremptorily re
fused to publish it.
At that time I did not take any further
means to secure publication for my letter. I
was averse to appearing in a public contro
versy. Only a conscientious conviction of
duty urged me to write at all. When I had
satisfied my conscience by making an honest
attempt to contradict falsehood and misrepre
sentation, and when that attempt was fru>
trated, I conceived that I had done all that
duty demanded and I took no further steps.
stili the crusade against Rome went on. On
August 13 the Chronicle published a sermon
by lir. Brown, which took up nearly a column.
In that sermon occurred statements about
priests and nuns which Protestant historians
have branded as "filthy and disgusting
calumnies."
Dr. Brown described the "mona<:terie.B as
scenes of bacchanalian revel"." and declared
that "what had happened in the nunneries is
without the pale of description before an audi
ence like this." This was more than I could
f taud. A second time I wrote r refutation of
Zanders, and a second time the refuta
tion was re! us -d insertion by Mr. John P
Young.
When in the month of August of this year
the A. P. A. began its campaign for 18!>tJ* the
Par. Francist-o Chronicle proceeded again to
advertise its doings. During the month of
August it published the speeches at the Metro
politan Temple to the extent of 67 inches in
imall print. In September it published {>:?>;.

In November it published :>:{ inches and in De-

tery to come before you, the public ( ,i San
Francisco, and declare ,' "the chronicle has
thus far honestly striven to do its duty to the
fominunity from which it derives its support
by placing as many obstacle* In the way of' a

Highest of all in Leavening Power. â Latest U. S. Gov't Report
ABSOLUTELY PURE
But if it be honest and manly and right to
treat both sides viilh equal justice, either to
give nil the arguments or to give none, either
to open the columns to Catholic >md the a. p.
A., or to close them against both, then John J.
Young is neither honest nor nianlv nor just.
Jiotli limes that I called on John P. Young
to offer >ny refutation of the A. P. A. calumnies
area me that if Catholics would biro a
ball and disprove these charges from the plat
form lie would treat us as well us lie was treat
ing our adversaries. When, therefore, the new
campaign against Catholicism opened in tiie
August of 1895 jind the Chronicle was adver
tising it to the extent of two columns every
Monday morning 1 made no more calls on Mr.
Young. 1 determined to see what his word
w as worth.
Accordingly a hall was hired which, on two
occasions, mils filled to the doors. John P.
Young stood by his promise by giving a report
of the proceedings to the extent of a lew
Inches. Hence it was that when, in November,
I wrote a letter questioning the authenticity
of certain quotations read at the Metropolitan
Temple, 1 did not t, r >> in person to Bee Mr.
Young. I instructed my messenger to carry
the documents to tne other papers, and if they
also refused I authorized him to insert it at
regular advertising rates. The document was
refused, of course, by Mr. Young, but was pub
lished by the Examiner, and the result has
been that the public has learned that there are
iwo sides to the question and that Catholics
can Rive a reason for the faith that is m them.
This is a full account of the facts as I know
them which have led up to the present condi
tion of affairs. For them the editor of the
Chronicle, John I*. Young, is responsible.
Surely I am not bound to stand dumb when
t hear everything that is near and dear to me
Insulted. Barely ] am not compelled by any
law, human or divine, to refrain from defend
ing my character when niy character is at
tacked". Have Catholics in this community
nny rights ns agHin>t the Chronicle and John
P. Young? Must we allow column after column
of slander to be launched auainst us because
that journal or its editor professes to imagine
that an aiibwer will stir up strife
They are to blame who rirst gave publicity to
the charges, not they whose good name could
be kept clear only by refuting them. If from
this controversy there shnll arise anything to
injure this City or to tarnish its fame the re
sponsibility lies at the threshold of John P.
Young.
But I can safely say that the Chronicle's ap
prehensions of riots and burnings are as base
tess as its charges airain>t me. In the days of
the Knownothiugs two cities were threatened
with mob violence â Philadelphia and New
York, 1., Philadelphia not a voice was raised
against Knownothingism and the saintly
Bishop Kenrich publicly urged his flock to say
nothing mid remain within doors.
The burning churches, the looted convents,
the Catholics shot down in their own homes,
tell the result of this policy. In New York
John Hughes combatted the conspirators with
tongue Mud pen. When the Knownotbings
liad elected their Mayor mid had called their
great mass-meeting, the usual preliminary to
a riot, John Hughes straightway issued his
manifesto. "The laws of New York expect each
citizen to defend his property and his rights."
In two hours the call for the mass-meeting
"as revoked. New York was delivered from
the disgrace of mob rule. Every conspirator is
a coward, and cowards are careful to attack
only tiie defenseless and weak.
There is uo danger that the present contro
versy will pass beyond words. It will continue
and end as similiar controversies have con
tinued and have ended in the past. It will do
about as much good as other controversies I
and about as much harm. But if the evil
shall outweitrh the advantage, and if the
contention shall tarnish the fame of our City,
the blame isnot mine. The blame lies with
those who advertised the slanders in the
beginning and who then refused us an opper
tunity to speak in our own behalf. The biame
lies with those who were too cowardly to
ignore the conspiracy altogether, too unjust
to give both sides equal rights. The blame
lies before God and man on the shoulders of
the Chronicle editor, John P. Yonng.

THE APOSTOLIC CHUfiCH.
Father Wyman Eeviews Point 3 Pertinent to
the Controversy.
The Rev. Father Wyman, superior of the
Paulist Fathers, a scholar and preacher of
recognized ability, delivered a sermon at
St. Mary's Church last evening that is
j pertinent to the great religious contro
versy now bein^r carried on in The Call.
His subject was the "Aposteiate of St.
John, tne Evangelist." Father Wj-man
said :
St. John was rightly called the beloved dis
ciple of the Savior. He was one chosen to wit
ness the manifestation of Christ's irlory in his
transfiguration on Mount Tabor. He was the
favored apostle at the last supper, and was
worthy on this occasion to recline on our
Savior's bosom. At the crucifixion he was the
only one of the twelve who remained faithful
to Christ, standing at the foot of the cross. To
aim Christ committed his blessed mother as
he was leaving this earth. Every true man
loves his mother above every one else, and the
fact that Christ when dying recommended his
mother to th^ care of St. John i-; enough to
show mat John was his beloved disciple.
When the apostles early on the resurrection
morn heard the good tidings that the Savior
had risen, St. John eagerly ran with St. Peter
to the sepulcher, and sucn was his love and
ardor for the Lord that he outran Peter and
arrived first at the tomb. Peter, however, en
tered the sepulcher alone. John In his humility
giving place to the Prince of the Apostles.
In the work of propagating Christianity St.
John took a most important part. He lived to
a greater age than any or the other api
He founded the seven great churches of Asia,
and during his lifetime ruled over them, in
structing them in the doctrine and discipline
of Christ.
At the request of the Bishops under him he
wrote the first of his epistles in the New Testa
ment, and in which he teaches the necessity
of adhering to the doctrine which he had first
received from Christ, as at this time there
were tho^e who disputed the divinity of the
son of God.
He wrote at the request of the Bishops of the
churches which he had founded the celebrated
fourth Gospel of the New Testament. Unlike
the other evangelists, he begins by declaring
the divinity of Christ. He also speaks of the
vocation of the Apostles, and calls special at
tention to the fÃct thai Christ changed the
name of Simon, the son of Jonas, to Cephas,
which means Peter, because, no doubt, Peter
was to be the foundation of that visible church
In which was to be preserved for all time the
doctrine of Christ's divinity and the full and
complete message which the Savior had deliv
ered to the world.
St. John is the connecting link between the
apostles of Christ and the hierarchy Of the
church. He lived to see ihe authority of St.
Peter's second successor, St. Clement", exer
cised and obeyed by the church at Corinth.
By some of the most learned among Protest
ant historians of the early church the origin
of Episcopacy is traced to St. John. Among
these I may mention Professor Harnack of
Germany, who, although a rationalist, has
done srreat service to Christian science by
bringing the controversy respecting the origin
of the Catholic system of dogma and discipline
within limits which almost border upon the
apostolic age.
He has shown at what an early period Catho
licism universally prevailed and he says that
the Catholic system of dogma and discipline is
implied in the acceptance of the creed and the
Bible as authoritative rules of faith. In short,
the controversy as to whether or not Catholi
city represents apostolic Christianity is re
duced to the question as to whether* or not
Christ was the son of God, made man, and re
deemed the world by his death upon the cross.
This question is sufficiently and easily deter
mined by a careful study of the teaching of St.
John the evangelist.
THE LIBERAL VIEW.
Dr. J. L. York Gives His Ideas of the
Great Controversy.
Dr. J. L. York lectured at Scottish
Hall, 105 Larkin street, last night. He
said:
I am glad that the San Francisco Call, the
l>e-t paper in our City, has opened it columns
wide to the content now raging between the
two branches of the Christian church that the
may know the facts. Pour in the
lightâ all lies hate the lightâ and nothing but
tile light of history and modern science can
burn uj> the chaff of religions superstition hih!
pretensions and false claims of Christianity.
My reading and investigation has long hro
convinced me that the church of Home is the
cnurch of history and thoroughly based upon
tlie New Testament script urea, and when she
fnils to substantiate her claims as the custo
dian of scripture and traditions of Christianity
her system of dogmatic theology is dead, and
along with it must co the diluted forms of
Christianity, which Protestantism, from Lu
theri&m to I'nitarianism, has built up in the
Dame <>> Christianity.
As a Protestant Christian and believer in the
Now Testament, no one can successfully deny
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 13, ISOG.
and refute the claims of Romanism. And if. I
believed that Christianity was the only true,
religion 1 would get into the old mother
church as fast as my legs could carry me.
If the New Testament is true the Apostle
Peter was the transmitted head of the church,
and, consequently, tne Popes of Rome are in
direct succession'to Peter, else the church of
God must have died on Peter's hands, with no
power to perpetuate itself. To a Protestant
Christian believer in the Immaculate Concep
tion, trinity of God, heaven, hell and the
devil, and the Bible as tne will of God, how
can any such person or church deny or refute
the claims of the Catholic church to spiritual
power? The Protestant and Roman churches
must live or die together, so far as their creed
and theology are concerned.
To Protestant Christians this is an open
question. But to Liberals and Freethinkers it
is no longer a question of debate. We take our
place on the side of reason, science and com
mon sense and deny as untenable the false
Claims of Christianity.
As Liberals and Freethinkers we have no in
fallible bible or Pope, and simply deny the
whole system as of pagan origin.
From our standpoint the greatconflict raging
between Father Y'orke and the Protestant
Church has a deeper and wider signiiicance
than some people attach to it, and really in
volves the question of the truth or falsity of
Christianity.
If Christianity is true why should any sane
man be a member of the A. P. A. and struggle
to keep the church out of politics and
schools? If God has a book what right has
any man to keep that book out of the schools
of our country? Don't we want God's truth
everywhere to a dying world? What's the
matter with us? If" Christianity is true and :
God is the author of it why should not his i
church take his religion into politics. Govern- !
ment and schools? And thus the science of poli- '
tics and Government would become thesci
ence of God and his church.
This is the logic of Christianity. And what
objection can any honest, sincere Christian
have to placing the name of God, Christ and
the Bible in the constitution of our country, a
Christian country?
Why t^hould we shut out God, his word and
his priests, from the control of state and
schools I .' And next week there will >>c pre
sented to both houses of our Congress an
amendment to our organic law recognizing
God and the Bible. And thus for twenty-seven I
years God has been knocking at the door of j
Congress at the hand of his church and can't
get in. These sincere Christians desire the
glory of God, and to this end they want relig
ious Legislatures, Sunday laws* and thumb- :
screws for the unbeliever.
And while we commend their sincere and j
honest zeal and loyalty to their conviction we
deprecate their judgment and logic in the in
terest of religious superstition and quackery,
which has no foundation in truth. The whole
question Involved in the conflict between Ro
manism and Protestantism is the trutli or
falsity of its claims.
if it be from God and the truth let it control
both state and school, but if it be of men let it \
be kept out from all human concern, and the
only consistent reason why we .should oppose
the infusion of the church "into the stale is that
it cannot in the light of this day sustain its
nu nstrous claims upon the. intellect of the
world.
As liberals and freethinkers we war against
the system and not aga;i:.-t the good name of
men and women on account of their religious
belief. To my mind nothing but freethought
and enlightenment of the mind can heal the !
malady.
As unbelievers in all forms of supernatural
religion we place the Protestant on the same
common ground with the Catholic mother, j
and till other religions, and that both of them, i
while entitled to protection in their religious I
belief, ure dangerous as a ruling power and
cannot be trusted with the liberties of thr , e< i
pie, simply because they are not true to nature
and not adapted to human government.
THE CHURCH AND STATE.
Bey. Charles W, Wendte Writes About Civil
Government.
The Rev. Charles W. Wendte writes on
the ''Doctrine of Civil Government and its
Relation to the Spiritual Power as held by
the Catholic Church." The following syn
opsis of his let'.er is taken from the Ex
aminer:
What is the Roman Catholic doctrine?
Briefly stated, it is the supremacy of the
church and the subordination of the Stale to
it. This is called the system of theocracy. The
classical example for it is the system of the
Papacy and the canon law of "the Roman
Catholic Church. Since the time of Gregory
VII the Catholic church has taught that there
can be no .sovereign political authority, nor
any independence lor the individual, beyond
the limiu. fixed by the ecclesiastical power*
The State has indeed a qualified independ
ence within its sphere, but what that sphere
is is determined l>y the church .which thus be
comes the ultimate authority in all questions
of civil and political import. To quote the
langurge of an American Roman Catholic,
Hishop Gilmour: '"The State is for the body,
the church is for the soul. But the soul is
superior to the body; Jience the church is
above the State." This reasoning is supported
by appeals to the Scriptures, to tradition and
to other sources of religious authority. The
church having thus the divine right to rule, it
fellows that its head, the Pope, is the sovereign
of the world, and all civil governments must
submit to his dictation.
The code of Gratian, as compiled about 1150,
and ever since accepted by all the Popes as
j.art of the canon law, to which everybody
oyv-es obedience, declares that the Pope "alone
Rives power and efficacy in the first instance
to every law" (Geficken I, 24). Thomas Aqui
nas, the greatest among the doctors of the
church, teaches that "the power of all tem
poral princes derives its strength and efficacy
solely from the spiritual power of the Popes. 1 '
So says the Catholic church historian I>oellin
ger in his "Fable?, etc.", p. 153. So Bellar- |
mine, another eminent papal authority, de
clares that the Roman Pontiff "lias supreme
power id dispose of the temporal matters of all
Christians," and as a necessary consequence
of this power "he can change kingdoms, tak
ing them from one ruler to bestow on another,"
transferring the obligationsof allegiance with
out consulting the people. Pope Innocent 111
claimed (see Janus, p. 133) in one of his ecclesi
astical epistles that "Christ has committed
the whole world to the government of the
Popes."
[Dr. Wendte quotes many like authorities
to tiie same effect. â Ed.]
True, in common practice, the church has
often modified her demands. .She has been
compelled, by the logic of necessity, to recog
nize and treat with civil Governments as
equals. It is characteristic of the Roman
clergy always to avail themselves of their
immediate opportunity, no matter how it may
contradict the logic of their principles.
In the many earthly dilemmas in which the
Catholic church has found herself, she has,
from motives of self-preservation, held her
extreme theories somewhat in abeyance, and
accepted the situation. But the doctrine of
Papal supremacy was not surrendered thereby.
It was only suspended and kept in reserve, to
be again advanced at a more favorable oppor
tunity. Thus the present Pope I-eo XI II in
his encyclical of June 20, 1888, declares:
"Although in the extraordinary condition of
these times the church usually acquiesces in
certain modern liberties, not because she pre
fers them in themselves, but because she
judges it expedient to permit them, in better
times the would use her own liberty." We can
readily imagine what this meansâ that if the
Catholic hierarchy ever obtained control of
our National life, they would, in accordance
with their well-known and freely-expressed
principles, put an end to free speech, a free
press, free schools, a free church and a free
Government. Are we not warranted in believ
ing this.'
Recent Popes nave denounced by name these
essential institutions of our nation, calling
them "the liberty of perdition," "impious,
absurd and erroneous doctrines," "detestable
sentiments pregnant with the most deplorable
evils, of all others most to be dreaded in a
state." Indeed Pope Leo XIII, in the encycli
cal already quoted from, emphatically "con
demns the supposed right of a man to choose
his own religion and calls it a "degradation of
liberty," and Pope Pius IX, in his allocution
to a consistory of cardinals, September, 1851,
said: "We have taken this principle for basis,
that the Catholic leligion with all its rights
ought to be exclusively dominant in such sort
that every other worship shall be banished
and Interdicted.'"
It would be easy to heap up similar declara
tions <>t purpose from the minor clergy and
Catholic press. Thus the eminent theologian.
lÂ»r. Brownson, in his "Catholic Review," af
firmed that "Protestantism of every form has
not and never can have any rignt where Cath
olicity is triumphant."
Some years ago Bishop Gilmour of Cleveland
laid down in a pastoral letter to his diocese
the Catholic philosophy of government in the
following words: "Nationalities must be made
subordinate to religion. We must learn that
we are Catholics first and citizens next.
Catholicism teaches that God is above man,
the church is above the state." This is cer
tainly explicit and emphatic enough. So Car
diuul Newman, in his famous controversy
witn Mr. Gladstone, maintained that the Brit
ish Ministers should have gone to Rome to
ascertain the civil duties of a British Cath
olic subject, and that "no pledge from Catho
lics was of any value to which Rome was not a
party."
To be sure, the church strenuously denies
that the State has any right to interfere with
her property arrangements, no matter how
they affect the welfare of the community. This
is what the Roman Catholic church says to-day
to the American state, as she heaps up millions
on millions of property, usually exempt from
taxation, held absolutely by oiie person, the
Bishop, and by him only as the representative
oi a foreign ruler; thus forming a continuous
and dangerous monopoly in our midst. The
American state may sooner or later have to in
terfere to regulate this great and growing evil,
as the governments of Europe have had to reg
ulate It, but the moment she attempts to do
so the cry of the church will be: "Hands off;
you are transcending your sphere. " The ques
tion then arises, Who is to determine what is
the respective sphere of the church and the
state? "The church," answer our Catholic
friends. But then, on this supposition the
church might accomplish anyend.no matter
how worldly or injurious to the community, by
â¢simply declaring it to be a spiritual necessity,
and the state would be compelled to submit.
Thus the Second National Council of the
Roman Catholic church at Baltimore, in 1806,
declared that "in prescribing anything con
trary to the divine law (i. c. as interpreted by
the hierarchy) the civil power transcends Its
authority, and has no claim on the obedience
01 tiie citizen."
Now our American principle of seU-govern
ment teaches us to the contrary and tells us j
â¦hat the church must not only* be separated I
from the state, but also in all temporal con- I
cerns must be subordinated to it.
Based upon the idea of the sovereign power !
of the people, the state, as the expression of
that sovereignty, is the highest competent
authority in American life. It follows, then,
that the state car.not allow another power
alongside of it vested with superior or even
equal right, and absolutely independent of its
authority. The state is the supreme power in
the land, and whatever disobeys its laws and so
opposes the public interest and will must give
way. To be sure, the state allows its citizens a
large measure of individual liberty. It grants i
certain indenniteprivileses to the family and to !
other associations of men for specific purposes; j
but only so far as these do not oppose the pub-
He will and welfare. So the church also en
joys a certain independence in administering 1
her temporal affairs, but whenever she over
steps the limits of her freedom and acts against
tli.- general good, or does anything to abridge :
the civil rights of the members of her own
communion, then the state has a right to in
terfere and maue her superior authority felt.
On the other hand, in the sphere of purely
speculative and spiritual interests the church
Is sovereign and absolutely free. Here the i
state confesses its limitations and leaves the i

This, then, is the true American doctrineâ in

of the church, in temporal affairs the subordi

HUNTING THE FORGER.
Wylie O. I.ytle, Dean's "Whilom Office
Boy, Returns From a Trip to
Sacramento.
Wylie G. Lytle, the boy employed as
office boy by Forger Dean, the man who so i
cleverly beat the Nevada Bank out of |
$20,000, returned to hi 3 residence, 100 Fell
street, last night and dissolved the mys
tery as to his whereabouts. He had been
to Sacramento with an ambitious private
detective, who had an idea that the forger
was in the capital city, and who paid
young Lytle $3 to accompany him, in or
der that the man might be identified and
the reward claimed without delay. Dean
was not there.
W. \V. Lytle, the boy's father, who has
a cigar-store on Market street, near Van
Ness avenue, resented a story by a "Mrs.
Davies" of 100 Fell street, who claimed to
be young Lytle's foster-mother, and who
charged the father with neglecting his
boy. Lytle cays the woman's name is
really Telfer. He says also that she has
only known his boy live weeks, and he
claims further that she is influencing the
boy to evil. He declared further last night
that be intended to apply to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
to see if he could not pet the lad, who is
only 18 years of age, from Mrs. Telfer's
control.
Young Lytle, on hearing of his father's
intention, at once consulted Captain Lees.
He said the chief of the detectives told
him he was old enough to look out for
himself. The boy admitted some of the
things his father said, but declared that
Mrs. Telfer was innocent of an}' wrong
doing and tbat he was staying with her
of his own free will.
A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
Misg Carrie Cunninglium, a ICepnrter,
Bally Injured by 11 Fall.
Miss Carrie Cunningham, a reporter on I
the Examiner, met with a serious accident
last evening that will keep her confined to
her home for several weeks. She had
been directed to go to the House of Cor
rection and interview Mrs. Mary A. David
son of the Brown scandal notoriety. After
leaving the electric cars on Mission street
Miss Cunningham walked to and along the
railroad track toward tlie lane leading to
the prison.
In the darkness she failed to notice a
culvert or cattle guard, into which she fell
with great force. For a time she was un
conscious from the shock. Upon recover
ing she cried for help, which soon came to
her aid. A little Inter Sergeant J. B.
Martin took charge of the young lady and
removed her to a drugstore on Twenty
ninth and Mission streets, where she was
attended by Drs. Grozingor and Clinton.
The physicians found that Miss Cunning
ham s injuries were numerous and severe.
Her breastbone was broken and her jaw
dislocated. Besides these the lady's chin
was cut, the wound beinir four inches in
length. Her lip was also cut through.
Miss Cunningham was removed to her
home at 733 Bush street. Aside from the
injuries, the shock to the young lady's
nervous system was very severe.
Population of Great Cities.
The French statistician, M. Bertillon,
has compiled some interesting facts re
garding the copulation of Paris and
other great capitals. Only 30 per cent
of its present population was born in
Pans, and this percentage has remained
practically the same for the last thirty
years. The native population in St.
Petersburg is 32 per cent; 41 in
Berlin, 45 in Vienna, and, contrary
to the general opinion, 6j in Lon
don â the highest of all lar^e
cities. Of all Eurooean capitals, Paris has
the greatest number of foreigners, more
than 181,000, exclusive of 47,000 naturalized
foreigners. Among these are 26,863 Ger
mans, while in Berlin there are only 397
French. London has only 95,000 foreign
ers; St. Petersburg, 23,000' ; Vienna, 35,000
and Berlin, 18,000.' â 
In Paris the number of foreigners in
creased between 1833 and 1891 from 47,000
to 181,000. In point of numbers there are
more Belgians (4o,000) in Paris than peo
ple of any other foreign nationality ; then
come the Germans, 26,863; Swiss, 26,000;
Italians, 21,000; English, 13,000; Luxem
bourgians, 13,000; Russians, 9000.

LOOT OF ARMY CLOTHING.
Alarming Wholesale Thefts
Discovered at the
Presidio.
ACCUSED ACCOMPLICE FLEES'
.
John Hogan, a Saloon-Keeper, Said to
Have Bought $20,000 Worth of
Soldiers' Clothes.
The army authorities at the Presidio
have discovered an alarming systematic
looting of the quartermaster's department
and succeeded in tracing it to certain
keepers of wayside saloons outside the
reservation eates. One of the men impli
cated has disappeared, it is authoritatively
stated, with a goodly fortune, amassed in
the course of some years through his traffic
with soldiers who stole or purchased
clothing at the post to .sell outside for beer
money.
Out where the steamcars of the Union-
street Cable Company's extension run
through dreary sand-dunes and beside
waste marshlands there stands a row of
saloons. The spot is lonely in the extreme
â not a dwelling, save a few small cot
taces. being near. Close by is Harbor
View Park and the poorly patronized Sea
side Gardens, but no evident source of sup
port for the row of drinking-places. And
yet the proprietors of these same lonesome
saloons between the sand and sea marshes
make a Rood living.
The way from the Presidio post houses
is devious and not at all one that would be
readily followed by men, for it either lies
partly along the marsh and partly over a
long trestle, or through long stretches of
yielding s:md. Then, too, there are several
more inviting saloons nearer the gates, and
so is it agreed that the soldiers could not
support these saloons. The business from
elsewhere would not half keep one of the
places open.
After some Presidio officers began to re
alize that more clothes were taken by the
men than allowed in the rules, or indeed
than the soldiers could wear, those facts
caused suspicion to be directed toward the
row of saloons. A council of war, so to
speak, was held and orders were given from
proper quarters to watch the saloons and
soldiers frequentine them.
It was not long before the truth came to
light, Â«nd then little t>y little the scheme
through which the Government had been
defrauded out of vast sums of money un
folded itself, and as it grew and grew its
dimensions and character astounded the
officers interested. For years this swindle
had been carried on day after day on a
perfect system that evinced forethought
and direction by men of considerable busi
ness ability, and while anything like an
exact estimate of the total amount thus
taken surreptitiously from Uncle Sam
could not be made, approximate figures
range from $30,000 to $50,000.
The wearing apparel of soldiers was
made the meduim of this fraud. Clothing
is furnished the army on large contracts
by the year by some of the most extensive
linns in America who can afford to sell in
immense quantities at prices said to be
even lower than those of ordinary jobbers
or wholesale merchants to retailers here in
San Francisco.
The Government supplies the soldiers
with a standard outfit each year, which
usually is more than can oe worn out by
one man in that period. The list includes,
besides uniform and overcoat, suits ot
woolen underclothing, stockings, shoes,
etc., all of irood material if not of the tir.est
duality. Besides this allowance, the sol
diers are given the privilege of buying
extra clothing from, the quartermaster's
stores at all times out of their own money
and at cost prices, which, it must be re
membered, are lower than prevailing
wholesale figures.
At the l'residio this regulation was
taken advantage of with great success, as
recent developments proved.
It was found that soldiers had first of all
got rid of clothes allowed them, keeping
only enough to barely satisfy their own
needs for ihe year. These" garments â
shirts, woolen underwear, shoes and
stockingsâ disappeared from the post and
passed through neighboring saloons to
civilians around town. And then the sol
diers fell back upon the reserve supplies
persistently.
They bought shoes, stockings and
woolens every month, and even overcoats
were purchased with astonishing fre
quency. At last the oilicers in charge
made an investigation and discovered that
the clothing was nowhere to be seen.
The men, so it is stated, had sold the
clothes to the lonely saloons for what
would appear to be comparatively trifling
prices. Underclothing sold for 25 or 50
cents a piece and at a profit at that.
The investigation resulted in a warrant
being sworn out for the arrest of John
Hogan, proprietor of the Beer Garden
saloon at Harbor View, charging him
with receiving stolen goods. Hogan was
examined by the Federal Courts Commis
sioner and his bonds were fixed at $2000.
Since then he disappeared, after present
ing his saloon to Tim Walsh.
It was stated that Hogan used to fill
cases with Government clothing and cart
them downtown, where the articles were
sold Dy him at a handsome profit. In this
way it is said he received fully $20,000
worth of stolen goods and cleared at least
$10,000.
Walsh stated last night that Hogan had
gone away about six weeks ago and he
couid not* tell wnither. A neighbor who
knew Hogan intimately said: "Hogan
used to do a big business in soldiers' cloth
ing."
"The other saloon men were in the same
swindle."
"But they did not do so much of it as
Hogan," was the reply.
Hogan's friends claimed he had gone to
the "old country," but would say no more
about him.
