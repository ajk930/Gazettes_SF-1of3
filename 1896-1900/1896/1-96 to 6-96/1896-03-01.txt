SUNK DURING
A DENSE FOG
Ailsa of the Atlas Line
Run Down by La
Bourgogne.
WARNINGS NOT HEEDED.
Ringing of Bells Failed to Check
the Course of the Larger
Vessel.
COWARDICE OF THE SAILORS.
They Deserted the Passengers, Who
Were Rescued From the Rigging
by a Tug.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 20. â The
steamship Ailsa of the Atlas line was sunk
about 2:30 o'clock this afternoon by the
steamship La Bourgogne of the General
Trans-Atlantique line bound for Havre.
The Ailsa had sailed from New York en
route to Kingston.
Owing to the dense fog the Ailsa came
to anchor just at the south mouth of the
Narrows. The strong tide that was run
ning at the time swung the vessels head
so that at the time of the collision she was
pointing toward New York. According to
the statements of several of the crew the
vessel had been at anchor but a few min
utes when a huge steamer hove in sight
and although, according to the Ailsa's
crew, a continuous ringing of her bells had
been kept up since she came to anchor,
the vessel came on and struck the Ailsa
full on the port bow, tearing out a large
portion of her side.
Immediatelyjafter striking the Ailsa the
colliding vessel, which was learned to be
the steamer La Bourgojrne, backed out,
and, after disengaging herself, proceeded
on her way without makms the slightest
offer to render assistance to the Ailsa.
Captain J. W. Morris of the Ailsa was
on the bridge at the time the collision
occurred, and he immediately gave orders
to weigh anchor. This was instantly done,
and the vessel was- headed for the Fort
Hamilton shore. Before she had gone
far, however, she filled and sank. Tne
captain, passengers and part of the crew
took to the rigging, from which they were
rescued by the tug Harold, which hap
pened to be in the vicinity at the time.
The Harold, to make the rescue, steamed
between the masts and directly over the
decK of the sunken steamer. The Harold
also picked up later a part of the crew
from a small boat belonging to the Ail?a.
According to the crew only a few min
utes elapsed from the time the vessel was
struck until she went down. As far as can
be learned La Bourgogne suffered little or
no injury from the compact. The crew
and passengers of the sunken steamer
were brought to the city by the tug and
landed at the Bhip news office of The
United Press.
In interviews with the passengers of the
ill-fated vessel it was learned that the crew
of the Ailsa behaved in a most cowardly
manner. It is asserted that when La
Bourgogne struck the Ailsa the crew, in
stead of trying to assist, seemed to be in
spired with only the desire to save them
selves. They seized the only available
boat, which they quickly lowered, and
jumping into it pushed off, leaving the
passengers to their fate.
There were fourteen cabin passengers on
the Ailsa, among them, several women.
The latter were verging on hysterics when
seen at the pier. Some of them looked as
though they had been subjected to some
hard usage.
The officers of the ill-fated vessel deny
that the crew abused the passengers, or
were guilty of any cowardice. Captain
Morris of the Ailsa refused to make any
Etatement with regard to how the accident
occurred.
J. W'eatherspoon, the chief engineer,
Bpoke freely about the accioent. He de
clared that La Bourgogne was to blame
and said that the Ailsa"s bell was rung
continuously while she lay at anchor.
He was rather indignant at the manner in
which the French steamer behaved. He
denied in toto the passengers' statements
that the crew had seized the only avail
able boat and abandoned the passengers to
their fate. He asserts that the passengers
refused to iro into the small boat and-
Fought refuge in the rigging; that upon
the refusal of the passengers to enter the
boat the captain ordered the crew to pull
for the shore, and that the vessel filled
and went down so rapidly that neither the
passengers nor crew were able to save any
of their effects.
The Ailsa now lies sunk to her lower
yards and is on a hard bottom off Fort
Hamilton. The crew numbered thirty
seven men, including Captain Morris. It
was composed of Spaniards. Cubans and
Italians. The Ailsa is a British screw
steamer, 290 feet in length, beam 34:2 feet,
depth 23:9, tonnage tS3i, built at Glasgow
and owned by the Atlas Steamship Com
pany. She had a general cargo.
It has been learned that La Bourgogne
proceeded but a short distance after the
collision and came to anchor. It is not
known whether she sustained any injury.
She has forty-five cabin passengers on
board.
Everybody on the Ailsa, passengers and
crew, were saved, though Mrs. Pierce was
slightly bruised. Mr. Cummings ana
three other passengers were in the smok
ing-room when the crash came. Rushing
to the bow he instantly saw how serious
the danger was, and shouted, "Bring up
the women first."
This was done and they were sent into
the rigging, and some of them when the
vessel had sunk were ui> to their knees in
water. It is said that onj of the crew
brandished a revolver in his endeavors to
get into the lifeboat.
Mr. Cummingn jumped into the water
and was ultimately picked up by one
of the Ailsa's boats, which contained
seven of the crew.
The tug Harold, which came to the
The San Francisco Call.
rescue, was at first afraid to approach the
wreck, but at length rescued all hands.
Not a ladder, life-preserver or other ap
pliance was used. The tug literally came
aboard the Ailsa and the unfortunates
were picked off the rigging.
Mrs. Miller, one of the passengers, fell
overboard in the excitement, but was gal
lantly rescued by her husband.
It AX liOWy THE CLYDE.
The Old Dominion Steamer Guyandotte
JtaniK the Vesgel.
NEW YORK, X. V., Feb. 2fÂ«.â At sp. m.
the Old Dominion steamship Guyandotte,
headed for Norfolk, Ya., ran down the
steamship George W. Clyde of the Clyde
line, which was coming in from "Wilming
ton. The collision occurred off Bay
R idge. The Guyandotte cut a big hole in
the port side of the Clyde just amidships.
It was immediately apparent that she
would sink in a few minutes as the water
was pouring in the hold at a great rate.
Fortunately three tugs were near by,
and they quickly attached lines to the di>
ablea vessel and all steamed for the shore
at full speed. "When they approached the
shallow water near the beach they let go
their lines, and the Clyde, with the mo
mentum she had obtained, ran on the
beach stem foremost. As she was loaded
with freight and there were only mem
bers of the crew aboard, no persons were
taken off.
CaptaiD Olesen of the tug Scandinavian
said that the fog was so thick that little
could be seen of the accident. None of
the officers of the Clyde or Guyandotte
came ashore, and no account of the acci
dent could be obtained from the parties on
board.
SMOTIIEIiEI* HY COAL GAS.
Three of a Family of Eight Dead, and
the Others Hying.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 29.â Three of a
family of eight, dead and the others dying
is the frightful result of the escape of coal
gas yesterday morning in the residence of
Fred Stuenkel. a farmer living a few miles
southwest of Chicago Heights, near Crete,
Will County. Physicians attending the
family say the mother and four of the
children will die. The father, the oldest
daughter, Rosamond, aged 13, and his
four-year-old child, are already dead.
Those who are pronounced dying are:
Kate Stuenkel, aged 43, the mother:
Hulda Stuenkel, aged 10; Arthur Stuen
kel, aged 8; Reneta Stuenkel, aged 5
months, and William Stuenkel, aged 19.
MANY LEAVE THE RANKS
Resignations From the Salvation
Army Come From Various
States.
Ballington Booth and Wife Will Con
duct an Independent Evangeli
cal Movement.
NEW YORK, X. V., Feb. 29.â 1t was ac
knowledged to-day at Salvation Army
headquarters that many resignations are
expected from the West, particularly Cali
fornia, where ex-Comtaander and Mrs.
Booth are especially popular. They made
a tour of the West a few months ago, and
were received everywhere with great
demonstrations of regard. Their personal
hold upon the army in that section of the
country is strong.
The Salvation Army corps at Sea Cliff,
L. L, commanded by Captain Mills, is
in open revolt. Captain Mills has resigned
and the soldiers are to follow suit. The
corps is a small one, but its action is sig
nificant as indicating the feeling of the
rank and file regarding the deposition of
their former commander.
Frank Harris, secretary of the Auxiliary
League of Orange, X. J., sent his resigna
tion on to Staff Officer Marshall to-day.
He wrote that he would never contribute
another cent to the Salvation Army. His
letter did not brighten the outlook for the
army, for similar decisions have been
announced by other members of the
Auxiliary League.
Balhngton Booth to-night made the fol
lowing statement concerning the future
plans of himself and Mrs. Booth: "Mrs.
Booth and myself have received hundreds
of telegrams and ietters from responsible
men and women asking me to assume tlie
leadership of an independent evangelical
movement. They offer us ail the money
necessary for expenses and leave to us the
plan of operation, the scope of organiza
tion and methods of work.
"We shall not start an independent Sal
vation Army, but will devote our lives to
evangelical work in America.
I am not prepared to give any idea of our
plans, but they will be on grand lines, in
concurrence and in sympathy with Ameri
can principles and in sympathy with the
sentiment of the citizens of this great re
public.
"The work will be thoroughly organized,
will be effective and enduring. There will
be no army officers, no uniforms, but a
band of earnest, enthusiastic and faithful
workers for Christ. It will cover the en
tire country. Time will be necessary to
perfect the details.
"From an intimate friend of the ex-com
mander it was Ifarned that there will be
choruses and bands of music at all the
great meetings to be held by the Booths.
The first meeting will probably be held in
Carnegie Hall.

STATE DEPARTMENT TACTICS.
Gathering Information to Show That
Insurgents Are Not as Strong
as Represented.
WASHINGTON', D. C, Feb. 29.âSen
ator Lindsay of Kentucky, one of the ad
ministration spokesmen on the Cuban
question, had an interview with Secretary
Olney to-day concerning the Cuban reso
lutions now pending in Congress. Those
who have visited the White House and the
State Department say that there Is manifest
anxiety on the part of the officials as to
the outcome, but they express hope that
the affair will not lead to hostilities.
Leading administration men express the
belief that' when the "demagogues" in
Congress have made their speeches inter
est in the matter will subside. State De
partment officials declare that the insur
gents are not nearly so strong as they have
been represented to be in the press and in
Congress, hence the reluctance of the ad
ministration to recognize them as bellig
erents or to acknowledge their independ
ence.
Consular officers in Cuba have reported
this to the State Department, and there
fore the administration is reluctant to ally
itseif with a losing cause. State Depart
ment officials declare that Congress has
been misled, and that the insurgents can
not hold out much longer. It is hinted
that President Cleveland intends to call
before him influential members of Con
gress and tell them that the time is not
yet ripe for recognition of the Cubans as
belligerents.
Administration people are curious to
know what form Congressional action will
take. A concurrent resolution will not re
quire action of the executive, and, it is
said, will he no more binding upon him
than would similar action on the part of
one of the State legislative bodies.
The resolution as it passed tbc Senate
merely expressed the sentiments of that
body with regard to the situation in Cuba,
but was in nowise mandatory in its terms.
It is hela, therefore, that it does not in
crease the President's responsibilities in
the matter, inasmuch as the execution of
its suggestions is left practically to. his
discretion just at present. The adoption
of the joint resolution requiring the action
of the executive either in approval or dis
approval would, however, put a decidedly
different and more serious aspect ou the
question.
While it is stated in official circles that
the President would deprecate the neces
sity for action on his part one way or the
other just at this time, he would undoubt
edly approve a bill recognizing the bellig
erency and even independence of Cuba,
more In deference to almost universal de
mand for such action rather than because
he really believed it the best thing to be
done under existing conditions.
The feeling that to veto tha message
would only serve to postpone recognition
of the insurgents would probably induce
executive approval.
Assuming that the executive acts at
once upon the resolution so far as to grant
belligerent rights to Cubans, the best au
thorities in Congress on international law,
say the only advantace the Cubans will
derive from it is that they may then have
ships of war (if they can get them) with
out being regarded and treated as pirates;
and they may issue bonds and borrow
money, as any nation may, if they can
lind any one willing to take the risk of ac
cepting such a contingent security as they
are able to offer. The right to ship arms
and men to Cuba will not be affected by
their recognition as belligerents, but on
the other hand our vessels will at once be
come subject to ssarch.
If the President goes to the full extent
of the suggestion of the resolution, and
besides granting belligerent rights, takes
steps to secure tbe independence of Cuba,
it becomes a graver matter. That, it is be
lieved, would amount practically to our
Government granting assistance to Cuba
and might lead to hostilities between this
country and Spain. For the President to
adopt the full recommendation of the
resolutions would, it is believed, result
inevitably in the liberty of Cuba, but if
the resolutions retain their present con
current form the President will not be
compelled to act on them if he does not
want to, or he may delay action for some
time and then take the steps suggested.
The question is so delicate and doubtful
that most every Representative and Sena
tor questioned on the subject declines to
be quoted. Representative Money of Mis
sissippi, a member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee and authority on international
law, said to-day :
"The adoption of the resolutions by
Congress will benefit the insurgents to this
extent â as an indication of the sentiment
of the Government of the United States
and temper of the people, and may abso
lutely prevent Spain from borrowing the
money necessary to prosecute the war.
The insurgents themselves may be able to
float a loan on the strength of the moral
effect of the resolutions and equip a navy.
"The adoption of the resolutions will cer
tainly give great encouragement to the in-
surge nts and stimulate them to further ef
forts. As to the binding power of concur
rent resolutions upon the executive, there
is none in fact. They do not bind him to
do anything."
The members of the Cuban revolution
ary party now in Washington were nat
urally very much pleased with the course
taken by the Senate yesterday afternoon.
GonzalodeQuesada, secretary of the Cuban
Legation here, conversed witli The Call
correspondent.
"Of course," he said, "we are very much
gratified at the result of the vote on the
Cuban resolutions in the Senate. We
regard it as a concrete expression of the
opinion cherished on the subject of Cuba
by a vast majority of the American people.
We are confident that the action of the
House of Representatives will be no. less
emphatic.''
The general impression among influen
tial friends cf Cuba here not directly con
nected with the movement in an official
sense, is that Spain will place reliance in
the President and depend upon him to
forestall the effect of any legislation Con
gress may enact. They appear to be
amused at assertions that the Spanish
Government will withdraw its Minister
here in case the House follows the exam
ple of the Senate, declaring that Senor de
Lome is the only person who stands In
the way of unlimited transportation of
men and munitions of war to the insur
gents in Cuba.
It is understood that a friend of the
Spanish Legation also expressed the
opinion last night that President Cleve
land would take no definite steps toward
carrying out the requests of Congress con
tained in anything like a concurrent reso
lution. The gentleman is said to have
pointed out thai the action of this Govern
ment in detaining the Bermuda when the
courts had declared in several cases that
there was nothing illegal in the shipment
of supplies to revolutionists was indicative
of what might be expected of the adminis
tration in its further treatment of the sub
ject. The representatives of the Spanish
Government in this city declined to-day
to say anything at all about the action of
the Senate yesterday and its possible
effect upon the relations existing between
this country and Spain.
MUST THE I'KE-SIDEZT ACT?
Legal Complications Connected With the
Cuban RfÂ»olution.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 29.â The
phraseology of the Cuban resolutions
adopted by the Senate yesterday, "Re
solved by the Senate (the House of Rep
resentatives concurring)," revives the
question which was discussed in the House
when the Armenian "concurrent" resolu
tion wafc adopted as to whether the Presi
dent is not obliged, under the Federal
constitution, to either approve or disap
prove all such "concurrent" resolutions in
the manner followed in the case of "joint"
resolutions.
It has been customary for : Congress to
adopt concurrent resolutions without
sending them to the President for action.
It has been contended that concurrent
resolutions relate only to expressions of
opinion by Congress to which the execu
tive is not committed, to ; the correction of
errors in bills that have not become laws,
to Questions of adjournment and recess, to
requests for information . from , the execu
tive and? to f minor matters which cjan be
arranged without executive action. , : Âi, ,;
The Armenian resqiutiO".p adopted by
Congress January 2 7 last, l^questing thÂ«
President "to represent ) to Great Britain
and all , the other European -powers con
cerned in the Berlin treaty of ;, 1878 . the
earnest desire of the Coneress of. the
United States that "decisive measures
â¢should be taken to stay the hand of fanat
icism and lawless violence in Turkey, .'
present a case in point. These resolutions
were termed "concurrent" under the con
struction that they did not require execu
tive approval or disapproval and thus left
it optional. with the President whether he
should present them to the Governments
concerned or ignore them. The President
has ignored them. \- They remain on the
executive desk unacted ,upon. If they had
been termed "joint" resolutions it would
have been incumbent upon the President
to sign them or allow them to become law
without his signature under the ten days'
constitutional 'limitation, or to return
them to the house in which they origin
ated with a veto message.
The basis for the contention that all
resolutions of Congress, except those re
lating to an adjournment, must be pre
sented to the President for action is found
in paragraph 3, section 7, article 1, of the
constitution, which reads as follows:
"Every order, resolution or vote to which
concurrence of the Senate and House of
Representatives may be necessary (except
on a question of adjournment) shall be
presented to the President of the United
Sta.tes and before the same shall take effect
shall be approved by him or being disap
proved by him shall be repassed by two
thirds of the Senate and Houseof Repre
sentatives, according to the rule and limi
tations prescribed in the case of a bill."
Concurrent resolutions have never been
published in the Revised Statutes of the
United States until recently. Under the
public printing act of January 10, 1805, it
is required that they shall be inserted in
these editions and the last volume of the
Revised Statutes contains all concurrent
resolutions of the Fifty-third Congress in
an appendix, separated from the bills and
joint resolutions which have become laws.
They have never been considerer! as laws
(not having received Presidential ap
proval), and the constitutional provision
quoted has not been construed to affect
them i-n any way.

HARD AND FUST
IN THE CHANNEL
Misfortune Again Overtakes
an American Line
Steamer.
THE NEW YORK AGROUND
While Entering in a Dense Fog
the Big Ocean Greyhound
Sticks in the Mud.
ONCE RELEASED FROM DANGER.
Eut the Second Time the Vessel
Strikes All Efforts Fail to
Release Her.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 29.âMisfor
tune again overtook the American line
Steamship Company to-day for the sec
ond time within a month. One of their
vessels, the New York, the first of the trans-
Atlantic transports to fly the Stars and
Stripes, grounded within this harbor'dur
ine a dense fog. The steamer lies easy
midway between Sandy Hook and Staten
Island, in the main channel. Although
she is hard aground, her nose being buried
some six or seven feet in the mud, and is
exposed to any violent gales liable to blow
up, the owners are not apprehensive and
her position is considered not to be a
dangerous one. Another point in her fa
vor is that she went on at comparatively
low tide.
The New York sailed from Southampton
for this port Saturday, February 22, car
rying a good number of passengers. She
had a hard voyage, but managed to reach
Sandy Hook without any startling inci
dent. It was nearly 3 o'clock this morn
ing when the great ocean greyhound
rounded Sandy Hook and pointed her
nose for the ship channel. It was then
very foggy, so much so in fact that none
of the big lights for the safe guidance of
vessels into this port round about the
Hook were discernible from the New
York's deck. The vessel was feeling her
way carefully in. Several hours before
Pilot Dick Bagley had been taken aboard
and he was guiding the steamer's course.
Slowly the vessel pushed on through the
thick vapor. The lookout was vainly try
ing to peer through the heavy mass, while
sc uadings were being taken continually.
The compass was being eagerly watched
and shortly before 4 o'clock showed the
vessel's position to be about right.
Soon after 4 o'clock the men on watch
were startled by a violent shaking of the
boat. There was a sudden quivering, a
louil grinding, which told to the experi
enced seafaring men only too well what
had happened.
"My God, we are aground !" despairingly
shouted the pilot.
"Reverse the engines quick; reverse
them; we are hard asnore," was the com
mand excitedly given through the tube to
the engineer. Quick as a flash the engines
were reversed and for several minutes the
vessel stood to its bed. Harder and harder
were the engines driven and after half a
dozen minutes more the big liner began to
move and was once more in deep water
just south of the middle buoy.
"Thank God," said the pilot, and he
breathed a heavy sigh of relief.
"That was a close call," said he to the
lookout. "That's as close to it as I ever
was."
The steamer then proceeded slowly,
groping her way, intending to anchor a
mile or two further in the upper bay.
Captain Grant was on the bridge and extra
lookouts were distributed about the deck.
The big foghorn incessantly rent the air
with its notes of warning. Those on deck
were discussing their iuofcy escape a few
minutes after, when the vessel, auiverina;
from stem to siern, suddenly stopped.
Again that grinding noise and splashing
of water, with a perceptible listing of the
ship. Fora moment the captain and pilot
gazed on each other, speechless.
â¢'That's the earth again, sure," were the
words that broke the silence, coming trom
the pilot's lips. Once more were the en
gines reversed and every effort put forth
to drive the ship back into the channel,
but it was of no avail. She was hard
aground sure enough. There was much
suppressed excitement, but discipline pre
vailed. Captain Grant was calm and gave
his orders with great precision. Hasty ex
amination showed everything all right be
low. A drop of the lead line showed about
four fathoms of water under the steamer
and that she was buried in a mud bank.
The shaking of the big boat was not vio
lent, not even sufficient to awaken the
passengers, who slept on serenely, uncon
scious of their predicament.
When morning dawned the disheartened
officers still found a dense fog prevailing.
Looking down from the stern of the ship
they saw boldly sticking out of the water
two blades of the propeller. They then
realized that they were far upon the bank.
At 7 o'clocK the passengers began to as
semble on deck for a promenade prepara
tory to breakfast. They noted nothing
wrong, but thought the ship was anchored
owing to the fog. It was not until after
breakfast had been served that the ne\v3 of
the grounding of the boat was made
known to them. It was not pleasant news
to the 210 cabin passengers aboard, who
were anxious to set to the city, and all
queries as to the probability of their being
landed to-day were answered with a
'â¢Can't say." However, they took tne situa
tion good-naturedly and made themselves
a3 comfortable as possible.
â¢The steamer kept up a continual blowing
for assistance, which was answered by a
passing tug about 7:30 thia morning.
Word of the grounding of the vessel was
brought by the tug to the office of the Mer
ritt Wrecking Company in this city, and
that concern immediately sont down to
the New York's assistance three tugs, the
Stephen Merritt, D. S. Arnott and J. D.
Dones. The tugs made no effort to pull
the vessel off during the morning or after
noon, but confined themselves to keeping
her from going further up on the mud
bank.
Later in the afternoon the steamboats
John D. Moore and George Starr, with a
lighter, arrived from New York, and the
work of taking off the mails was begun
about 4 o'clock. This was the work of
several hours, and after it was finished the
cabin passengers were crowded aboard the
two steamboats and transferred to New
York.
When the United Press tug came along
side tne New York a3 she lay stranded the
passengers were gathered along the port
rail. They seemed in good spirits arid
joked about their misfortune.
"What kind of a voyage did you have?"
was asked the passengers.
"Very tough, stormy all the way over,"
was the reply of one.
"Is there any alarm aboard over the
grounding?"
'â¢Not a bit."
"Was Captain Grant on deck when the
steamer first went ashore?"
"Can't tell you. All the officers are
4umb."
They requested that Captain Grant come
to the rail, but he sent back word that he
had nothing to say at present. One of the
passengers hanaed the following state
ment to the United Press reporter:
"We went on the bank at 4 a. m. after
being already in trouble once before a lit
tle earlier. Since then we have been vis
ited by tugs and looked at and pulled by
a rope over the side as you see. We have
been in the fog all the time and in the dark
as to an^ prospects."
At <J r. m. there was a strong southeast
wind blowing, accompanied by a heavy
rain. The boat was listing some to, star
board and swaying considerably with the
big rollers which were sweeping over the
waters.
Captain Merritt was personally in charge
of operations. He said he thought the
New York's position safe enough, but he
could not say when she would likely be
got off. Au effort will be made in this
direction at every high tide until she is
floated. Her position he thought was not
as bad as that of the St. Paul when she
grounded off Long Branch a few weeks
ago. She was on a hard, sandy bed while
the New YorÂ£ is on a soft, muddy bed.
Vice-President Wright of the Interna
tional Navigation Company came down on
a tug, but he would make no statement as
to Captain Grant's excuse for the ground
ing of the New York. Mr. Wright said he
was not at all apprehensive about the New
York's safety and expected to see her
floated in a day or two. He said that the
place in which the vessel lay is not dan
gerous as the banks are composed entirely
of mud and are sloping.
Two hundred and thirty- five persons
landed from the George Starr and 270
steerage passengers were left on board the
New York.
L. Richensenberg, a journalist connected
with the New Brad Lande3 Zeitung of
Mannheim Germany, said that the high
est praise was due to Captain Grant of the
New York for the admirable way in which
he had managed affairs at the time of the
announcement of the grounding.
The New York went ashor. in the lower
bay Octobei 10, 1389, while she was the
City of New York and flying the British
flag. It was three days before she was got
off. The New York ran into the
steamship Delano near Nantucket, Mass.,
on June 20, 1894. The Delano's bow was
badly stove, but she did not founder. The
New York was only slightly injured.
When the tide was highest to-night the
tugs started to haul, while the steamer
used her own propellers and worked her
windlass, to which were attached the
cables of the anchors. The attempt was
unsuccessful and nothing further could be
done until high tide to-morrow morning.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Feb. 20.â The

BIG COMBINE IN TROUBLE
Receiver Appointed for the West
ern Union Cold Storage
Company.
Gigantic Enterprises That Succumbed
to the General Business
Depression.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 29.-In the Su
perior Court to-day Judge Payne ap
pointed Floyd Jenisoa receiver for the
Western Union Cold Storage Company.
The Produce Cold Storage Exchange,
the Western Refrigerating Company and
the Western Union Cold Storage Company
are the names of the corporations involved
in the court proceedings.
In addition to appointing a receiver
Judge Payne issued an injunction restrain
ing the Produce Cold Storage Exchange
and the Western Refrigerating Company,
capitalized at ssoo,ooo, from forfeiting their
leases to the property on which their
plants are located. It is said that enough
business could not be transacted to sup
port the gigantic enterprises. The bill for
the receivership was presented by the
American Trust and Savings Bank on be
half of the first-mortgage bondholders.
The Produce Cold Storage Exchange was
organized in 1892 with $1,000,000 capital
stock to acquire the Chicago Cold Storage
Exchange and absorb other concerns, thus
forming a cold storage trust. The leases
of all the acquired properties were trans
ferred in 1894 to the Western Union Cold
Storage Company, the combine capital in
volved being over $2,500,000,

Again the Value of the Cathode Hay Was
Dentontt rated.
BALTIMORE, Ma, Feb. 29.â An inter
sting as well as astonishing proof of what
the cathode rays can do was offered last
evening by an experiment of Dr. William
Lee Howard of this city. Miss Madge
Ellis, the vaudeville singer with the Reilly
& Woods Company, has been suffering foV
a long time with pains in her left foot.
Yesterday she consulted Dr. Howard, who
is somewhat of an experimenter in the
subject of X-rays.
Dr. Howard applied four tests, and
finally located a needle in her ankle. The
steel had been broken off in her knee in
childhood, and was. when found, located
just buck of the external malleolus. By
an operation it was removed, this consti
tuting one of the most remarkable tests
yet made with the cathode rays. The ex
periment is considered by local scientists
as most wonderful, as such a small object
as a needle was discovered.

BALTIMORE, Mn., Feb. 29.-The Balti
more and Ohio Railroad Company is in
the hand of receivers. Judges Goff and
Morris of the United States Circuit Court
this evening named John K. Cowen and
Oscar G. Murray to take charge of the af
fairs of the corporation, which is one of
the oldest in American railroad history.
Mr. Cowen has been president of the
road since early in January, when he suc
ceeded Charles F. Mayer. For years Mr.
Cowen had been chief counsel for the road.
Mr. Murray steps from the position of first
vice-president, to which he was elected
only a few weeks ago, into the joint re
ceivership with Mr. Cowen.
Mr. Murray has for some years past oc
cupied the position of third vice-president
of the Big Four system, and represented
ihe latter corporation and the Chesapeake
and Ohio in the Joint Traffic Association.
From early morning Baltimore and Ohio
stock broke far below all previous records
on the rumor that a receiver would be ap
pointed. A statement sent out by the
United Press from Baltimore Thursday
night, in which most positive information
was given to the effect that a receiver
would be appointed within forty-eight
hours, was pointed to as indicating a
reasonable assurance that some action in
that direction would be taken before the
day closed.
A number of stockbrokers and financial
institutions having an interest in Balti
more and Ohio property dispatched mes
sengers to the United States court at fre
quent intervals during the day, and â were
apparently relieved when they learned
that no application had been made up to
the hour that the clerk closed the office to
the public.
Mr. Cowen denied himself to all visitors
excepting directors of the company, who
came to his office in answer to a call. No
one would give the slightest information
as to the object of tne meeting, but it soon
became known that there was trouble In
the air.
The New York and foreign representa
tives of the company were well represented,
four of the directors arriving early in the
morning. The presence in the city of
Judge Nathan Goff of ihe United States
Circuit Court, which fact became known
shortly after the noon hour, was also con
sidered significant as portending some im
portant action in that direction. The
street was rilled with rumors until the Ion?
conference and board meeting in the
Baltimore and Ohio building came to an
end, after 6 o'clock this evening.
When the directors riled out of Presi
dent Cowen's private office and some of
them wended their way to the United
States Circuit Court in the postoffice
building, there seemed to be no doubt
that the until recently highly valued Bal
timore and Ohio property, with which the
name of Garrett had for so many years
been linked, was about to pass into the
hands of receivers.
Judges Goff and Morris were locÃed in
their offices, and none but the Baltimore
and Ohio officials and attorneys were al
lowed to enter the sacred portals. It re
quired but a few minutes to transact the
business in judge Goff s private quarters;
and at 7 o'clock the announcement was
unofficially made that President Cowen
and Vice-President Murray had been ap
pointed receivers of the company.
At 11 o clock to-night Mr. Cowen
emerged from the president's office and
gave to the press the following official
statement, which had been in the course
of preparation for some hours:
"A committee composed of the New
York directors of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad Company has been for some lime
engaged on a plan for funding the floating
debt of the company and to provide addi
tional capital. Until this morning there
was the strongest belief upon the part of
.the company and the members of the syn

dicate who have been aiding the company
that the plan proposed would be adopted
in time to meet the company's require
ments.
"After full consultation, however, it was
found to be inexpedient to carry out all
thedetailsof the plan without the aid of
the court, and for that reason it became
necessary for the railroad company and
the Mercantile Trust Company of New
York, representing the syndicate which
has been aiding the compsny, to begin a
friendly suit for the appointment of re
ceivers* who should hold the prpperty and
operate it pending the consummation of a
plan for its reorganization.
"With that in view, the Mercantile
Trust Company applied to the United
States Circuit Court for the District of
Maryland, and upon its application two
receivers have been appointed, viz. : John
K. Cowen and Oscar G. Murray.
"Prior to the commencement of the suit,
however, the whole matter was laid before
the board of directors of the company,
and they unanimously parsed a resolution
authorizing the company's officers to con
fess judgment in favor of tlie Mercantile
Trust Company for the amount of the
debt due to that company held by it on
benalf of the syndicate and consenting to
tne appointment of receivers for the prop
erty. The board at the same time passed
a resolution requesting the New York
members of the board, who have been
preparing a plan for the rehabilitation of
the company without the foreclosure of
any of the company's mortgages, to organ
ize themselves as a committee, with power
to add to their Dumber, or to associate
with them a committee in London for the
protection of the interests of all the secur
ity and share holders, wiih a view to the
immediate reorganization of the company
and its affairs.
"These gentlemen will continue in this
effort and they expect to have apy>oitued
in London another committee of security
or shareholders to operate with them in
the presentation of a plan which will have
for its object the extinguishment of the
entire floating debt of the company and
the furnishing of new eapitai and the
placing of the company's finances upon a
firm and stable basis.
"The board of directors and the officers
of the company gnatly regret the neces
sity of asking the intervention of the court,
but the demands upon the company were
bo pressing it was impossible to deal with
the subject of readjustment without grant
ing the delay which arises from a receiver
ship and the administration of the prop
erty under the orders of a judicial tri
bunal.
"The persistent rumors spread through
the public press to the effect that the re
port of the noted expert, Stephen Little,
did not confirm the report of the com
pany's accounting oflicers made to the
syndicate under date of February 1, 1896,
are entirely without foundation. On the
contrary, Mr. Little's examination folly
confirms the report of the company's ac
counting officers made February 1, 1896,
of the company's floating indebtedness,
income, etc. There is no basis whatever
for such rumors heretofore passing
through the public prints."
Mr. Cowen states that in regard to the
relief department of the company every
obligation of thet-ompany to its employes
will be under the order of the court ful
tilled to the letter. This department, un
der the court's order, is continued pre
cisely as it was under the company.
The history of the Baltimore and Ohio
i 3 the history of railroad euterprise in this
country. It is the oldest chartered rail
road in America and the oldest passenger
railroad in the world. Ground was broken
for the enterprise on July 4, 1823, by the
only then surviving signer of the
Declaration of Independence, Charles
Carroli of Carrollton. No one supposed
that it would be anything but a horse rail
road. Nevertheless it was the original
intention to extend its ODerations to the
Ohio River, and the name by which* it is
known to-day is the name ty which it was
christened.
On the 22d of May, 1830, the road was
opened for business from Baltimore to
Ellicotts Mills, thirteen miles. The first
American passenger-car then used was
about twelve feet leng. One horse was at
tached, and he was good for eight miles an
hour, carrying twenty-nve passengers.
The first American locomotive ever con
structed was tried upon this road, being
the handiwork of Peter Cooper. It then
dre^r the first passenger-car ever pro
pelled by steam upnn any railroad in the
world (August 28, 1830), Mr. Cooper acting
as engineer. It is also recorded that on
this occasion Mr. Cooper severely jammed
his thumb, which may be set down as the
first railroad casualty in history.
The road was opened to Washington
August 25, 1835; to Cumberland, Novem
ber 5, 1842; to the Ohio River at Wheeling,
W. Va., January 1, 1853; to Cincinnati and
St. Lonis, June 4, 1857, and to Chicago,
November 23, 1873.
The announcement that receivers had
been appointed for this time-honored in
stitution spread with lightning-like ra
pidity, and was the chief topic of dis-
cussion on the straets, at the hotels and
clubs to-night.
v At midnight the Baltimore and Ohio
building, usually shrouded in darkness
with the sinking of the sun, was bril
liantly lighted, and Receivers Cowen and
Murray were the center of a large group of
interested persons engaged in discussing
the outlook for the property. In the
group were several old friends of the Gar
rett family, who were only half successful
in concealing their misery over the col
lapse of the road, in which the Garretts
had been and are very largely interested,
and which but a few years ago boasted of
an undivided surplus of millions in its
treasury.

BLACKBURN RETAINS HIS VOTE
Complications in the Prolonged Contest
Increased by the Springing of
the Silver Pledge.
FRANKFURT, Ky., Feb. 29. -The sen
sation of the day in the Legislature was
the withdrawal of Dr. Hunter. It came
in the form of a letter from the Republi
can nominee addressed to the Republican
members, and withdrawing from the con
test. The letter was read by Representa
tive Lyons of Newport.
In his letter of withdrawal Dr. Hunter
deprecated the unfortunate complication
with which he and his party ftad been
hampered during the long contest, but re
turned his grateful acknowledgments to
those. who had stood by him with so ninch
loyalty.
The withdrawal took even the majority
of the Republicans by surprise, and it is
evidently the result of yesterday's unfor
tunate development on the money ques
tion. "\
The Republicans were somewhat dazed
and did not unite on any candidate. C. F.
Burnam, John W. Lewis, Judge Holt,
Auditor Stone, Senators Bennett and
Deboe and a dozen other Republicans
were complimented with votes. The vote
as announced gave Blackburn 61, and the
rest were divided among the Republican
and Democratic favorite sons. A motion
for another ballot was defeated.
OPPOSED TO FREE SILT
Mâ > â  n f of the Sound-Money Democrats
of Missouri.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 29.â About 300
prominent Democrats, representing -the
sound-money faction of the party
throughout Missouri, met here to-day for
a conference on the course to be pursued
in the coming campaign. Ex-Attorney-
General Daniel H. Mclntyre of Caliph,
Mo., was elected chairman and Dr. 0. L.
Jewett of Shelby was appointed secretary.
Ex-Governor Francis was one of the
speakers.
A report was adopted denouncing the
attempt of the free silver advocates to
commit the Democratic party in this and
other States to the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, re
gardless of the commercial value of the
two metals and regardless of the action of
other commercial nations of the world.
The report also says:
'The free coinage of silver at a ratio
above its market value is but another
phase of that paternalism and favor to tne
few at the expense of the many against
which the Democratic party has .Iways
struggled. To fix by law a value upon sil
ver which it does not command in the
open market is to do for the silver barons
of tie Rocky Mountains what has so long,
under the special guise of protection to
home industries, been done for the iron
barons of the Alleghenys."

Cortes on the same day as the arrival of
grave news. He says Spain must proceed
with great prudence and also with great
energy, because the action of the United
States Senate was the beginning of serious
complications. He added: "I greatly fear
that the remainder of the American repub
lics will follow the example of the United
States. God grant the coming elections

In Valencia to-day a 'body of students
paraded the streets carrying banners and
subsequently held a meeting at which
resolutions were passed protesting against
the action of the United States Congress.
After the meeting the students made a
demonstration in front of the United
States consulate shouting, "Death to
Uncle Sam!" "Viva Spain!" "Viva the
Spanish army!" and "Viva Spanish
Cuba!"
In an interview Prime Minister Canovas
del Castillo said he doubted that President
Cleveland would approve a recognition of
the Cuban insurgents as belligerents, but
if he should be compelled to indorse the
action of Congress it would not provoke
an international conflict nor interrupt the
friendly relations existing between Spain
and the United States. The recognition
of the rebels as belligerents would bind
the United States to a greater neutrality.
Tne Corresponciencia says that the recog
nition of the Cuban rebels by the Ameri
can Government is an event of graver
import to Spain than any which has oc
curred for years.
El Liberal denounces the recoenition of
the belligerent rights of the rebels as un
just and opposed to law.
Spain, says El Liberal, will resist, even
to the drenching of tbe soil with Spanish
blood, any determined attempt to affront
by foreign intervention those who have
never yet submitted to it.

opinion that the recognition of the belli
gerent rights of Cuba involves great dan
ger. This paper also thinks Prime Minis
ter Canovas del Castillo is over patient in
the face of Yankee pride.
"Spain," says the Imparcial, "must pre
pare for an emergency. We are not so
weak as to render our hostility a matter of
indifference to a trading people having no
warlike qualities. It must also be taken
into account that Spain is not isolated in
Europe."

ILEEIAG TO HAVANA.
Americana in Cuba Endangered by the
Senate's Action.
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 29.â Since the at
titude of Congress on the belligerency
question has become plain the feeling
against Americans here has greatly in
creased.
The seizure of the Bermuda allayed the
feeling for a few days, but it is now more
intense than ever. The Spanish "blame
the United States for all the present
troubles.
The local press is bitter. The fact that
the insurgents discriminate in favor of the
property of Americans adds to the hostile
sentiment.
Already there is talk by extremist Span
iards of making a demonstration against
the United States. The volunteers are
most rabid.
The Captain-General assured the Con
sul-General some weeks ago that regulars
would be held in readiness to protect
Americans against the Spanish volunteers
should the emergency arise.
The absence of an American warship is
greatly deplored.
The only foreign cablegram published in
Diario, a leading paper, this morning is
the conviction of the officers of the Horsa.
There is nothing from Washington or
Madrid. Through private dispatches only
the fact leaked out that the Senate had
acted.
As the situation is realized the feeling
grows. It is impossible to predict the rest.
Americans are fleeing from all parts of the
island to Havana.

BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 29.â Another Bos

Spaniards in Cuba and the Stars and
Stripes have again been disregarded.
In a letter dated Mayajiuez, Porto Rico,
from Captain I. W. Bowden of the bark
Clothilde, he says that his vessel was
boarded at fonce by Spanish officers, who
declared that she had on board a large
consignment of contraband goods, muni
tions of war, etc.
Notwithstanding the captain's objection
two soldiers were stationed on board all
the time she was in port and when she
sailed for Mayaguez two officers remained
on board and the trip was made under the
escort of a Spanish gunboat.
The entire coast line between these two
ports was patrolled by soldiers. Then,
when they failed to find a single indication
of contrabands, the officers demanded $20
for expenses, which, to save delay, Captain
Bowden paid.
It is understood that this case, together
with that of the Navarino, will be re
ported to Congress.

PASSED OVER THE

The Arizona School
Lands Bill.
BENEFITS OF LEASING.
The Cattle Barons Are Supposed
to Have Influenced the
Executive.
LIKE THE OKLAHOMA MEASURE
Much Benefit Would Accrue to the
Territory From the Operation
of Such a Law.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 29.-After
an hour's debate to-day the House passed
over the President's veto the bill author
izing the leasing o* school lands in Ari
zona by a vote of 200 to 38. The negative
vote was cqnfine'i to Democratic members.
The Senate amendments to the army ap
propriation bill were disagreed to, and
the hill was sent to conference.
Consideration of the legislative, execu
tive and judicial appropriation bills under
the five-minute rule was completed, save
the paragraphs covering compensation
lor United States District Attorneys and
Marshals. A few unimportant amend
ments were made to the bill. The para
graphs remaining will be further consid
ered Monday, when the new salary Jaw for
those offices prepared by the Committee
on Judiciary will be offered as an amend
ment to the bill, under an order agreed to
to-day, relieving it from the operation of
the rule which prohibits the addition of
new legislation to appropriation bills.
The army appropriation bill, with the
Senate amendments, was laid before the
House and the amendments were dis
agreed to and a conference with the Senate
asked.
Lacey (R.) of lowa, chairman of the
Committee on Public Lands, called up
the President's veto of the bill authorizing
the leasing; of school lands in Arizona,
which bill the Speaker said the House
must, under the constitution, now recon
sider. Lacey stated that the bill was iden
tical with the Oklahoma bill passed
in 1894. Under the operation of the law
the Territory of Oklahoma received in 1895
the sum of $88,628, while in the previous
year, from leases made by the Secretary of
the Interior, the Territory received but
$46,594. The bill, Lacev said, was not an
experiment; it had worked well in- the
case of Oklahoma, and there was no reason
to assume that the officers of Arizona
would be or were less careful of the in
terests of the Territory than the officers of
Oklahoma had been.
Certainly, he said, they were better
qualified to act witn intelligence than tne
Secretary of the Interior, 1800 miles away.
Tfie cattle barons did not like the Okla
homa measure, and it could be easily ap
prehended that the same class of people
in Arizona would object. Whether or not
they had induced the President to veto
the bill lie did not know, but it was evi
dent that the veto had been prepared with
out, full knowledge of the facts.
The passage of the bill over the Presi
dent's veto was advocated by Underwood
(D.) of Alabama, a member of the com
mittee.
After brief remarks by Turner (D.) of
Georgia ana McÃae (D.) of Arkansas, the
latter ex-chairman of the Committee on
Public Lands, who urged the passage of
the bill notwithstanding the veto, Mur
phy, Delegate from Arizona, addressed
the House in favor of the passage of the
bill.
The President had evidently been im
posed upon by some one in vetoing the
bill, for Murphy said he had seen the ap
proval of the measure by the Secretary of
the Interior.
The question being, "Shall the bill
pass, the President's objections to the con
trary notwithstanding?" it was agreed
toâ ayes 200, noes 38. The announcement
was received with a few handclaps.

In accordance with the notice" civen yes
terday, Henderson (It.) of lowa reported
from the Committee on Rules an order
making in orderâ and not subject to a
point of order under the rules as an
amendment to the legislative, executive
and judicial bill â the bill reported by the
Committee on the Judiciary, providing
for the compensation of United States
marshals and district attorneys by salaries
instead of fees.
He explained the object of the order to
get the proposed legislation into the ap
propriation bill for the reason that it pro
vided the money to pay these officers, and
further to effect, by getting the provi
sions of the new bill in the appropriation
measure, a reduction of $216,000 in the ex
penses attached to these offices.
The order was adopted without division.
The House, in committee of the whole,
then resumed consideration of the legisla
tive, executive and judicial appropriation
bill for the year ending June 30, 1897.
But few amendments cf any kind were
proposed to the. bill and fewer still
adopted.
Stewart (R.) of New Jersey moved that
the appropriation of $8000 for the payment
of the salary of the Secretary of the In
terior be accompanied by the stipulation
that no part of it should be available foj
that purpose until the "Secretary had
made oath that he had faithfully exe
cuted the laws of the United- States. It
was rejected, h6wever, on a point of order
byMcCall.
The allowance for incidental expenses
to the government of Oklahoma was in
creased from $500 to |1000; the number of
mine inspectors in the Territories was re
duced from three to two and the appro
priation for their expenses from $5000 to
to $3500; the appropriation for expenses of
the Surveyor- General of Colorado was in
creased $500 and that for Utah $1500; the
provision in the law for the present year
was extended over the year 1896-7; that
fees received by clerks of the Circuit Court
of Appeals, in excess of their salaries, shall
be devoted to the purchase of law libraries
for said courts; the salary of Assistant
Controller of the Treasury was reduced
from $6000 to $4000, an-A section 3621, Re
vised Statutes, was amended t?o as to re
quire officers receiving moneys for the
United States to deposit them within
thirty days instead of "within a reason
able time."
The committee having finished consid
eration of all the bill, save the paragraphs
relating to the compensation of attorneys
and marshals of United States Courts,
rose, and at 5:05 the House adjourned
until Monday.
STOPS OCEAS JtACIJVO.
Change of Time Tables by Two Steamship
Companies.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 29. -With a
view to make it impossible hereafter for
the great vessels of their respective lines
to indulge in ocean races the American
and White Star lines steamship companies
will change theii time tables April 1, so
that their vessels will leave New York sev
eral hours apart. Under the new agree
ment the American line will leave at 10
a. m. and the White Star ships will get
away at noor, two hours later, so that the
American line boats will be outside the
Hook when the White Star boats start.
The agents do not admit that there is or
has ever been any racing between the two
lines, but they say under the present ar
rangements the ships sometimes hang to
gether for several days after leaving port;,
dome ihe best they can, but still keeping
well together. This fact has frequently
given rise to the impression that the ships
were racing.
WAS WORN BY LINCOLN
Lively Squabble Over the Pos
session of a Battered
White Stovepipe.
After Much Opposition the Relic Was
Taken From a Museum by
the Constable.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 29.-A white
stovepipe, somewhat worn and soiled, but
valuable as having once been worn by
President Lincoln, was the subject of con
tention in a replevin suit this morning.
Gath's "entailed hat" never aroused
more combativeness in disposition of man
than does this relic of the martyred Presi
dent, for not only was it the subject of a
suit, but it came near leading to violent ac
tion on the part of its possessor, less Osborn
H. Oldroyd, who maintains a Lincoln relic
collection on Tenth street, where the vic
tim of Booth breathed his last. It is not
certain whether this particular hat was
worn by the President the night that he
was assassinated, or whether it was one of
his old head coverings.
Tue hat in question was once the prop
erty of Dr. Phineaa D. Gurney, to whom
it was given by Mrs. Lincoln. In some
way it came into the possession of the
Government for use at one of its expo
sitions. It was for a long time on exhi
bition in the Patent Office, and then fell
into the possession of Oldroyd.
He was therefore astonished and pained
when United States Constable Sauker
entered the museum this morning, and,
armed with a writ from Justice Ctiurch,
proceeded to take possession of the sancti
fied stovepipe. The constable had one
end of the hat in his hand and Mr. Old
royd had the other. They pulled until it
was apparent that further pulling would
leave only pieces.
The constable explained, Mr. Oldroyd
remonstrated and threatened, but finally
succumbed and let Mr. Saulter have the
hat. Saulter explained that James 0.
Adams ana Emma A. Adams, executors
of the estate of Dr. Gurley, claimed to be
entitled to possession of the hat, and had
filed suit against Mr. Oldroyd for its re
covery. They assert that Dr. Guriey did
not give it to the Government, but loaned
it witn the understanding that when the
Government had finished with the relic it
should be returned to Dr. Gurley.
A TRIP OVER THE SANTA FE
Officials See Where the Operat
ing Expenses Can Be Much
Reduced.
The Cut-Rate Scheme of a California
Publisher Repudiated by Chicago
Lines.
CHICAGO, 111, Feb. 29.â President Rip.
ley, Vice- Presidents Robinson and Morton
and other officials of the Santa Fe Rail
road system who accompanied them on
their extensive tour of inspection, investi
gation and retrenchment, returned to Chi
cago to-day. The party was absent more
than a. month, and every part of the big
system was closely inspected in operation.
The result of the trip will be a large saving
in th 6 operating expenses, but the econo
mies will be effected without making any
wholesale discharges in shops, offices or
stations. The number of employes whose
services have been or will be dispensed
with is much smaller than was generally
supposed from published reports.
At a special meeting of Chicago lines en
gaged in California traffic held to-day, all
repudiated any connection with the
scheme of an agricultural paper to get set
tlers on California land owned by the pub
lisher by advertising a cut rate.
All the roads agreed to have no dealings
with the publisher, so that his cut rate
cannot hold good.
The called special meeting of the ad
visory committee of the V\ estern Immi
grant Clearing-house, "which was set for
Monday next, was held to-day because
certain members who will attend the con
ference with the Canadian Pacific at Mon
treal next Wednesday could not do so and
meet here Monday. It was merely de
cided at to-day's meeting that as many
members of the board as possible should
attend the Montreal conference, and then
proceed to New York to have a conference
there with Traffic Manager Hawley of the
Southern Pacitie at the end of the week on
the question for which the advisory board
meeting was called â that of the proposed
membership of the Southern Pacific in the
Western Immigrant Clearing-house.

The Expulsion of Dunraven Approved
by Members of All New York's
Yacht Clubs.
A
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 29.-Amonp
those who have spoken of Carlisle as a
Presidential possibility is Congressman
"U. S. Hall of Missouri, who was at Repub
lican headquarters in the Fifth-avenue
Hotel the other day with Congressman B.
B. Odell of this State. Hall, who unlike
most of the Missouri delegation in Con
gress, is a sound-money man, and at the
same time a Democrat, aaid in speaking
of the Secretary:
"The Democrats have a lot of good Presi
dential timber. I think Secretary Carlisle
would make a good President. He is a
strong man, and 1 should like to see him
nominated. He has established himself
asasafe man, and has the confidence of
the world. We have other strong candi
dates, such as Whitney and Morrison,
but Secretary Carlisle would be a welcome
nominee."
Ex-Senator Thomas C. Platt did not
keep to his bed yesterday, but was stump
ing about his apartments in the Fifth
avenue Hotel on his crutches. His right
leg is still useless as the result of the fall
he had on Wednesday evening.
The Republican politicians from all over
the State continued to call on Tlatt. Pos
sibly the two most important visitors were
Uncle George Washington Aldridge, State
Superintendent of Public WorKs, and
Colonel Ashley Cole, Governor Morton's
private secretary. The time is at hand
when Mr. Aldridge must Degin to turn the
spigot 01 canal patronage. There is $9,
--000,000 worth of this patronage, and Al
dridge proposes to use it in the interest of
Governor Morton as a Presidential candi
date.
Charles S. Wilbur, who was private sec
retary to Warner Miller when he was Sen
ator, is now on a tour of the Southern
States in the interest of Governor Morton.
It has been said all along that ex-Governor
McKinley has haa the advantage in the
Southern States because of the shrewd
methods of Hon. Mark Hanna of Cleve
land. Governor Morton's friends believe
that before Wilbur returns to New York
some of the best-laid plans of the Hon.
Mark will be overturned.
Among members of the New York and
other yacht clubs yesterday but one dis
sentingopinion was heard in regard to the
action upon the conduct of the owner of
the Valkyrie.
Chester C. Munro, who was the only
member of the yacht club who voted
against adopting the resolution expelling
Lord Dunraven from honorary member
ship, was asked yesterday why he had so
voted. He replied that he thought it un
wise and unjust to expel the Earl at this
particular time.
"I think," continued Mr. Munro, "the
club should have treated him generously,
rather than justly. It would have been
plenty of time to expel him after his res
ignation had been asked for, and provid
ing he would not consent to withdraw."
Lewis Cass Ledyard's speech introducing
his resolution for expulsion was the sub
ject of much favorable comment among
yachtsmen.
Manager Frank L. Perley has gone to
Chicago to wind up the affairs of Mme.

before next fall, but her physicians are
confident that she will then be able to re
sume her professional woru.
The announcement of the formation of a
big theatrical combination by Al Hayraan,
Charles Frohman, Nixon & Zimmerman,
Rich & Harris and Ivlaw & Erlanger has
raised a tempest â a tempest in a teapot,
may be, as one manager last night charac
terized it. In any event the managers of
prominent theaters in Washington, Pitts
burg and St. Louis feel that their interests
are menaced, and are preparing to take
precautionary measures.
"Who is to gain by the formation of
these combinations?" was asked of a prom
inent manager last night.
"The producing manager and the star,"
he replied. "The results of his business
must necessarily be competition for at
tractions, and as a result the rival houses
will try to outbid each other in terms."
Of course by having this chain of thea
ters in his control, Hayman is enabled to
book an attraction for an entire season,
and so save the manager a lot of trouble.
Haymau is at pre3ent in the West, but
Charles Frohman said yesterday that to
call the arrangement that had been made
a combination was a misnomer. "All we
want to do," he said, "is to centralize the
bookings and so save ourselves and other
managers a great deal of trouble. We
wish to injure no one.'-'
Most of tne managers in this city say
that they have no interest in the matter,
one way or the other.
For five long years the musical world
has been wondering why it was that Joseffy
had persistently refused all inducements
to appear in public. It wondered more
than ever j r esterday afternoon when the
distinguished virtuoso returned from his
self-imposed e^ile and played, as probably
no other living pianist can play it, the sec
ond concerto by Brahma. It is no exag
geration to say that he has returned to us
a greater artist than when he left us.
From a purely technical point of view he
is still beyond compare. The audience
applauded Joseffy after every movement,
and after the sprite-like hnale it recalled
him something like a dozen times.
Beethoven's "Eroica" symphohy was ex
cellently played, however, but Liszt's
"Tasso" seemed to give the listeners even
greater pleasure.

WlLij tIGUT OUT THE CASE.
Xo Prospects of a Settlement Between (ftÂ«
Jiraytons.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 29. â The
Drayton divorce case is beginning to come
into prominence again. Instead of a recon
ciliation there is every prospect the case
will be brought to trial and a bitter con
test will result. Efforts at reconciliation
were made, but were unsuccessful, and
Lawyer Richard V. Lindabury, Mrs. Dray
ton's counsel, says that his client is going
to push her tight in the courts for a vindi-
cation, and that the case will probably
come up for trial some time next month.
There will be no settlement of the matter,
he says, except a judicial one. The char
acter of his client has been attacked in
court by her husband, and she cannot
settle the case without proving the allega
tions against her untrue.
The nature of the defense to Mr. Dray
ton^ suit will be a denial of all the alle
gations made as to clandestine meetings of
Mrs. Drayton and Hallet Alsop Barrowe.
\V ltnesses will be produced to show that
lJrayton was by no means a model hus
band, and tnat his intemperance was the
cause of much domestic trouble. It is
claimed that he was extremely jealous of
his wife and that the chanres he made
against her were without foundation.
TWO NEGROES LYNCHED.

Suspended From a

They Had Committed Crimes That
Are Not Tolerated in the
South.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Feb. 29,-Last
Sunday night two negroes enters the
country store of J. W. Gourgea near Con
vent, La., bound the proprietor and seizing
his wife dragged her into the back yard.
It i 9 believed she was assaulted by the
neeroes, but she refused to talk on the
subject.
The negroes were arrested Tuesday and
brought over to Convent and confined !a
jail.
Friday night about midnight a crowd of
about 100 men took them from the jail
and hanged them on a beam, where they
remained until this afternoon. The lynch
ing meets the unqualified indorsement of
the community.

STATUARY HALL
The Marquette Statue In
formally Unveiled at
the Capitol.
PROTEST OF THE A. P. A.
The Government Urged by Reso
lution to Return the Gift
to Its Donors.
NO FEELING IN THE MATTER.
The Opposition Is Said to Be Based
on Inappropriateness and
Bad Precedent.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 29.-An
informal unveiling of the Marquette
statue, which the State of Wisconsin pur
poses presenting to the Government, oc
curred in Statuary Hall at the Capitol
this afternoon.
The covering was removed in order that
J. W. Losey of La Crosse, the chairman of
the committee appointed by the Governor
to inspect the several models presented
and select the one that should be executed,
might personally admire the work and
satisfy himself as to the correctness with
â¢which it was done.
Senators Vilas and Mitchell, of Wiscon
sin, as well as a number of the Wisconsin
Representatives, were present, as was
also Mr. Trentanove, the artist who mod
eled the statue.
A great deal of uncertainty exists re
tarding the date or. which the Marquette
statue will be presented to the Govern
ment. Mr. Trentanove believes the pre
sentation will occur on Friday next, but
the Wisconsin people say the presentation
may not take place for several weeks. :
In view of the opposition which the
American Protective Association is under
stood to be making to the acceptance of
the statue by Congress, it is regarded by
some of the gentlemen interested as a good
plan to postpone the ceremonies for a fort
night or more until the present excitement
connected with the affair shall have disap
peared.
This afternoon Representative Linton of
Michigan introduced in the House the
joint resolution regarding the statue of
father Marquette which has been ex
pected for several days. The document
reads as fellows:
Wherea?, For the first time in the history of
the United States there has been placed in the
Capitol a statue of a man in the garb of a
churchman, said statue being that ot a Jesuit
priest name'! Marquette, who died in or about
the year lt>7s, and who is referred to
in \ne joint resolution, as a reason
for accepting the statue, as "the faithful
n;is?i"iiary" ; and wheieas, the Revised Stat
utes of the United States /'section 1814) pro
vide "only for not exceeding two statues in
number of marble or bronze from each State of
deceased persons who have been citizens there
of and illustrious for their distinguished civic
or military services, and when so furnished
the same shall be placed iv the old chamber of
the House of Representatives, now known as
Statuary Hall, in the Capitol of the United
States"; and whereas, the said Marquette
never was a citizen of any State, nor of the
United States, nor performed any civic or mili
tary duty therefor; and whereas^J the statue
representing hies is of the ecclesiastical char
acter alone, being fashioned in church habili
ment? and paraphernalia, and otherwise en
tirelv # inappropriate for the position occupied
in Sia'tuary Hall, thereby being contrary to the
intent of the joint resolution which provided
for its acceptance; therefore be it
Rcnolved, That the placing of said statue ii>
the Capitol is not only without authority, but
in direct violation of the law; and be it further
Eexolved, That said statue be removed from
the Capitol and returned to its donors.
Mr. Linton said, in explanation of his
joint resolution, that ever since publica
tion has been made of the fact that it had
been received at the Capitol members had
Deen receiving memorials and petitions in
relation to it, asking that Congress refuse
to receive it. "The joint resolution," Mr.
Linton said, "seta forth the reasons why
we think the statue ought not to be placed
in the Capitol. There is nothing to say, of
course, against Father Marquette. and
there is no feeling in the matter that re
lates to him. The opposition to the statue
in its present place is based entirely on its
being inappropriate thereto and does not
come within the terms of the law."
THE DELAGOA BAY PLOT
By Clever Intrigue the Boers
and Germans Steal a March
on John Bull.
Cecil Rhodes Completely Outwitted
and His Reputation for Shrewd
ness Shattered.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 29.â Certain fa
vored Conservative journalists nave ob
tained from the Foreign Office a story of
what they call the Delagoa Bay plot, which
throws the clearest side light upon the
Boer and German intrigue to secure a foot
hold at Delagoa Bay, the capital of the
Portuguese possessions in East Af-rica,
which would afFord the best inlet and out
let to the trade of the Transvaal.
There is no doubt of the truth of the
story, which is to the effect (hat just prior
to the raid of Dr. Jameson into the Trans
vaal a Mr. Milne, a Portuguese concession
aire, who held a frontage on the foreshore
of Delagoa Bay for a distance of seven
miles, offered to sell the concession to
Great Britain for Â£20.000.
T'.c Government, through Sir Hercules
Rob;..son, Governor of the Cape Colony
and British High Commissioner in Africa,
declined to deal with Milne, as it was ex
pected that it would do, as nothing w^d
then known in England of the Transvaal
row. . , .
Thereupon President Kroger, who for a
long time has been making efforts to se
cure a port for the Transvaal, supplied
Hoeraan <t Eiffe, a German firm, with
money to purchase the concession, thus
giving to German subjects, who are en
titled to German protection, territorial
rights on Delagoa Bay. The concession
wii: soon be actively operated. Seeman <fc
Eiffe control the trade route, outside of
the railway, to the Transvaal and the main
routes to Swaziland.
Dr. W. J. Leyds, the Transvaal Secretary
of State, before coming to Europe visited
Delagoa Bay and arranged an important
part of the Boer-German coup against
British possession of that place.
As Great Britain would rather go to war
than submit her rights to pre-empt Dela
goa Bay to the decision of a European con
gress, the foreshore affair at first sight
does not look to be of critical import, as
that matter does not seem worth fighting
over, but as soon as the award of the Swiss
arbitrators is made in the matter of the
Delagoa Bay Railway, which is expected
to result in the granting of Â£500,000 com
pensation to the American bondholders,
Portugal will put the railway up at auc
tion.
The Boer-German syndicate will then
undoubtedly buy it and the Transvaal will
then have secured its long-sought-for out
let to the sea and will be able to carry on
a foreign trade "without having recourse to
the British railways to the south.
The Anglo- Portuguese convention only
prevents Portugal from selling the province
and harbor of Delagoa Bay without giving
Great Britain a cnance to acquire them,
but the Anglo-Portuguese convention can
be practically annulled by the German
holders passing on their concessions to
their Government.
How Cecil Rhodes, who once offered to
buy the whole Dclagoa Bay district for
Â£2,000,000, got tricked over tbis concession
is unexplained. His reputation as a far
seeing politician has been recently utterly
shaken.

to-night the Challenger will be ground to i
pieces. The tugs Vigilant and Moun- !
taineer, the only available craft, have been !
trying, but in vain, to pull the vessel off |
the beach. It is possible they may be able I
to do so in the morning.if the wind subsides i
and the work of destruction has not al- j
ready beeen completed. Wires' are down i

The Challenger arrived from San Fran- ;
Cisco this morning and dropped anchor at j
10 . o'clock just below Lighthouse Point.
There was a wind blowing at the time, and :
the gale increased until the cables broke. ,
Despite every effort the schooner was
driven onto the shore, and she now stands ;
well out of the water. The Challenger was '
to have begun to-morrow taking on a load
of lumber from the Simpson mills at Bal- ,
lard for Central America.
STORMS ON THE COAST.
Rough Weather Causes a Post
ponement of San Diego's
Carnival.
The Picturesque Ice Palace at Truckee
Doomed â Rain Welcomed by
Farmers.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 20.â A chilling
southwester blew this afternoon and even- j
ing and stirred up the usua-lly placid bay 1
so that it was unsafe for small boats to
venture out. The water fete, in which 200
craft, all brilliantly lighted and moving in
a procession in and out among tb/e war
ships, were to participate, the illumina
tions and fireworks and bonfires all were
postponed, and several thousand people
who had faced the keen wind turned re
luctantly away. Next Saturday night was
the time fixed for the pageant and the
committee in charge wiil go ahead with
renewed vigor to make the affair more
brilliant even than it woukl have been to
night.
On Friday night the Italian cruiser Cris
toforo Colombo will arrive here "and most
of the larger craft to take part in the
parade will greet the cruiser outside and
escort it into the harbor, past the flagship
Philadelphia, which will fire a royal
salute.
Spokane's Cold Visitant.
SPOKANE.Wash., Feb. 29.â The weather
turned very cold to-night and snow is fall
ing. The wind is blowing a gale from the
east. Reports from all sections of Eastern
Washington indicate the same condition.
Plowing had commenced in some parts,
but ice several inches thick will freeze
to-night.
TRUCK EE'S ICE PALACE DO OMB
Shorn of It* Cryatnl Covering by Rain
mid Tfartn Weather.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Feb. 29.â The heaviest
snowstorm of the season prevailed here
for the past twenty-four hours. The storm
is said to be general throughout the moun
tains as far west as Towles, it having com
menced with a light rain. At least a foot
of snow has failen here, while between
Summit and Cisco the fall will, it is said,
aggregate 19 inches. The sky is clear to
nu-lit, though more snow is expected.
The ice palace presents a forlorn appear
ance. The warm rays of the sun have of
late piayed havoc with what was once an
interesting and entertaining spectacle.
Tiie south side of the palace is shorn of
its crystal covering, while on the north
side the ice hangs only in strips. Un
doubtedly the ice palace will not prove the
Mecca of sightseers again during the
ent season, but the promoters are not dis
couraged and are already planning for
next winter. Mr. Whitney, proprietor of
the Whitney House, and one of the heav
iest stockholders in the ice palace, said to
day :
"Next year will surely play us even. We
have fared Dadiy thus far, but we have no
complaint to inaKe. The elements have,
unfortunately, been asjainst us, but we
have profited by experience."
A report is current that during the com
ing summer the palace will be transformed
into a roller-skating rink and dancing pa
vilion combined.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
ARE WATCHED
BY WILLIAM
English Statesmen Fail to
Please the Kaiser
in Their Talk.
GOSCHEN'S BAD BREAK.
That Speech at Leeds Causes a
Consultation With the
Ministers.
GERMANY'S ANGER INCREASED.
Ovations to the Raiders of the Trans
vaal Not Considered Just
the Propsr Thing.
BERLIN, Germany. Feb. 29.â The Em
peror made a special visit to the Chancel
[ lerie to-day .to consult with Prince Hohen
lohe upon the subject of the speech re
cently delivered at Leeds by the Right
[ Hon. George J. Goscben, First Lord of the
British Admiralty, in which he made al
lusions to the Kaiser which were calcu
lated to exasperate his Majesty. Accord
| ing to the semi-official newspapers and
; semi-official opinion otherwise expressed
! Mr. Goschen purposely went out of his
way to make unjust insinuations against
; the Emperor, and it is stated upon the
most reliable authority that the Kaiser has
1 strong hopes that sound sense will soon
\ prevail in England and that the people
! and statesmen of that country will not
? allow themselves to be landed into an un
tenable position.
Nothing can be learned from an official
source as to the founaation for the report
that a more friendly feeling between Ger
many and England has been brought
about and the truth of the suggestions is
generally doubted. Indeed nobody who
keeps himself informed upon political
questions gives the idea any credence.
Baron Yon Hamraerstein-Loxten, Min
ister of Agriculture, and Dr. Miquel,
Minister of Finance, were the guests of
the Emperor Wednesday evening, upon
which occasion his Majesty was in ex
cellent health and spirits and in an ex
ceptionally good conversational mood.
The Kaiser talked upon all subjects of
current politics and dwelt especially upon
the recent agrarian meeting held at the
Circus Busch. The Kaiser deplored the
attitude assumed by the more extreme
agrarians who by their conduct and intem
perance of speech, he said, had inflicted
great damage upon their own cause.
Virulent language, he said, was not con
vincing argument, and no self-respecting
Government would allow itself to be
bullied upon any line of pure party
action. The Ministers who were the
Emperor's guests concurred in his
Majesty's views, and the Kaiser added
that the executive head ol the Govern
ment would not be deterred by agrarians
or socialists or any other, faction or party
in his pursuit of desirable reforms for the
whole country.
Although the demonstrations which
were made in London upon the occasion
of the arrival and subsequent arraignment
in court of Dr. Jameson were not unexpected
here â indeed, they were 'fully expected â
they have, nevertheless, made the worst
possible impression upon the general pub
lic and in official circles, especially in
view of the fact that not only a mob of the
riffraff of the London populace, but
recognized leaders of society joined in the
popular laudation of the man who is re
garded in Germany, and whom Germans
believe ought everywhere be treated, as a
freebooter and an outlaw. The authori
ties of the German Foreign Office are un
able to see why Cecil Rhodes is allowed to
go free, without trial and even without ac
cusation, returning to South Africa, as
they believe, to prepare the way for fresh
trouble in the Transvaal.
The German press is again being treated
in a very odd fashion by the authorities of
the Reichstag. The twenty-fifth anni
j versary of the first assembling of that body
! in 1871 will be celebrated by a grand ban
quet in the hall of the Reichstag on March
21. The members of the press were not in
vited to the banquet, but the conauctors
of the newspapers were told that they
might find room in some gallery from
which they could look on. The Yolks
Zeitung in resenting this slight publishes
a stinging article in â¢which it calls upon
the whole German press to ignore the
banquet in their columns, and practically
to go en a strike unless the representatives
of the press are received in an honorable
manner.
The Vossische Zeitung, in an article com
menting upon the charge made by the
English newspapers that Germany iad in
spired the Sultan to demand that England
should evacuate Egypt, makes a categori
cal denial of the charges, and traces their
origin to plans formulated by the Salis
bury Government, which seeks to nourish
British hatred of Germans.
Mrs. Burmester Peterson of Baltimore
gave her first piano concert at Krolls'
Theatei this evening in the presence of a
large and distinguished audience. Princess
Frederick-Leopold, sister to the Empress,
warmly congratulated the artist upon her
technique, and her numerous friends
almost overwhelmed her with floral offer
ings as well as oral congratulations.
Hon. Edwin Uhl, the newly appointed
Embassador of the United States Govern
ment to Germany, is expected to arrive
here March 13.
Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow, military
attache to the United States Embassy in
London, who returned a few days ago from
Kiel, at the invitation of the Emperor, is
receiving every facility at the disposal of
the military authorities in the pursuit of
his mission to inspect the Baltic-North Sea
canal, and is also the recipient of the
exceptional courtesy and honor of being
permitted to inspect the artillery drills,
the military school, and. in fact, all of the
details of the German army.
Herr Singer, one of the leaders of the
Socialist party in the Reichstag, has pur
chased the business of the Verwaerts, the
principal socialist organ, and has ap
pointed Herr Richard Fischer, also a
member of the Reichstag, as the respon
sible editor and manager of the paper.
At the grand court reception held at
the palace a short time ago Mrs. Jackson,
wife of J. B. Jackson, First Secretary and
Charge d'Affaires of thÂ« United States
Embassy, presented Miss Rutter to her
Majesty, the Empress. The presentation
was made through the Countess yon
Brockdorff , Grand Mistress of the Court of !
the Empress. Miss Rutter, whose grace i
and beauty attracted much attention, was |
the only American lady presented to her
Majesty upon the occasion.
FR riT-GJiO HEUH MEET.
Plant for Market Extension Are Con
.â â  sidered. ; ..
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 29.â A largely
attended meeting of representative fruit
growers was held in this city to-day, those
present including T. H. B. Chamblin of
Riverside, D. T. Fowier of Fresno and W.
P. Stabler of Yuba City. A committee, of
which D. T. Fowier was the chairman,
made a report, recommending that an in
corporation, to be known as the California
Fruit Bureau for Market Extension, be es
tablished. The capital stock was to be
$120,000, in 4000 shares. The proposed in
corporation was stated to be for advertis
ing purposes, to extend the market for
California fruit in the East and not to
make any sales, in order that dealers
might not be opposed to the scheme.
This proposition to form an incorpora
tion for advertising purposes was not fav
ored by tbe meeting. The majority were
of the opinion that the work should be
done under the auspices of the exchanges
and unions and other existing organiza
tions.
A resolution calling upon the fruit
unions of Santa Clara County to formulate
a plan to promote market entension was
passed unanimously. A resolution was
also passed unanimously favoring the es
tablishment of a free ivholsale fruit mar
ket in San Francisco.
SANTA ROSA NOMINEES
Democrats and Republicans
Name Candidates for
City Offices.
Mayor Woodward Again the Choice
of His Partyâ Dr. Jesse Is
His Opponent.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 29.â 80 th the
Democratic and Republican conventions
for nominating city officers were held here
to-night, this being the last night on
which the certificates of nomination could
he tiled. Candidates for lucrative offices
were as thick as mudhens on a salt marsh,
there being throe tickets in the field and
many "bolters" running independently.
The Democrats were the first to gei to
business, and, after adopting a platform
favoring free water and a new sewer sys
tem, nominated Dr. J. W. Jesse for Mayor
by acclamation amid the wild cheering of
the unterrified. Dr. Jesse accepted the
nomination and thanked the convention.
The selection of Councilmen being next
in order three gentlemen were named and
unanimously nominated. One of these
having declined the thankless honor sev
eral others in the audience were placed in
nomination, and each in turn declined.
At last the name of W. I). Reynolds, the
Populist nominee, was suggested and
accepted.
The ticket named is as follows: Mayor,
Dr. J, W.Jesse; Marshal, Henry Wilson;
Attorney, Ross Campbell; Treasurer,
Charles 'Dunbar ; Assessor, John B. Davis;
Street Commissioner. John McMinn;
Clerk, 0. L. Mobiey; Recorder, M. K. Mc-
Corkle; Councilmenâ M. J. Bower, J. M.
Carter and W. IÂ». Reynolds."
The Republicans adopted a strong plat
form, advocating free water, city owner
ship uf lights and scientific sewer system.
Tlip name of Mayor E. P. Woodward was
then presented. From the ovation Mr.
Woodward rrceivd it wa* apparent that
no other name wouJd So considered and
he was accordingly declared to be the
choice of the convention for a third term.
In a characteristic speech the Mayor
thanked his enthusiastic supporters and
the other nominations were proceeded
with.
W. J. Steadnaan was named for Marshal,
and the wild applause from all parts of the
house was a sufficient guarantee of no op
position. For most of the remaining
offices strong tights were made, and it was
not until a late hour that the following
ticket was namd : Mayor. E. F. WTood
ward; Clerk, Tuonias (Joodfellow; Attor
ney, O. O. Weber; Marshal, W. J. Stead
man ; Street Commissioner, John Carltou ;
Assessor, K. L. Johnson; Treasurer, H.

brated here last nisht. About four hun
dred persons assembled at tlie I. O. 0. F.

SAN CLEMENTE INVASION
Chinese and Opium Reported to
Have Been Landed on
the Island.
United States Officials Start on 'the
Hermosa to Run the Smug
glers Down.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 29.--Col
lector Gaffey, Deputy Harknesa and Major
Harry Pattern left this morning on the
steamer Hermosa for San Clemen.te Island
on a hunt for smugglers. Collector Gaffey
heard some days ago that an attempt
would be made to iand a number of
smuggled Chinese and opium on the island
from an Asiatic steamer. It was reported
that a San Francisco yacht was hovering
about the island waiting for a chance to
take the coolies ashore. It was said that
the yacht had a large crew on board, and
some reports had it that a Maxim gun was
seen glittering back of the rail.
Gaffey 's force consisted of eight men, all
well armed, tor, as a matter of fact, the
trip is not at all a joke. The success of
the smugglers in landing their Chinese
means a protit of upward of $100,000, as
there are supposed to be about 100 coolies
as -well as a large amount of opium. Mr.
Oaffey was informed that the San Fran
cisco men were a determined lot.and he was
warned to take no chances with them if
they offered the least resistancs.
Toe expedition will, on arriving in Cat
alina, be transferred to Hancock Ban
ning's yacht La Paloma, and will sail at
once for San Clemente.
WITH APPLAUSE
AND FLOWERS
How Bob Fitzsimmons Was
Received by the
Sports.
MAHER ALSO ON HAND,
And Boxed Three Lively Rounds
With the Man Who Put
Him to Sleep.
"PUT HIM OUT, PETER," SHOUTED
The Present Champion Would Neither
Make a Speech Nor Accept a
Challenge.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 29.â A big
crowd of sporting men gathered in Madi
son-sauare Garden to-night despite the
inclemency of the weather. "Bob" Fitz
simmons, the famous middle and heavy
weight champion, was the magnet that
drew upward of 4000 spectators around the
roped arena. They not only had the op
portunity of seeing the hero of the latest
tistic battle pitted against a couple of good
heavy-weights, but he also sparred three
friendly rounds with the man he bested
in Mexico a few days ago. The authori
ties had an unusually large force of police
under Inspector Brooks on hand to prevent
anything like lighting,
Fitzsiminons, accompanied by his "wife
and party, arrived in the garden about 8
o'clock and the champion received a salvo
of applause. Brady, Corbett's manager,
repeatedly waved a roll of bills which he
said contained $10,000 and tried to shout a
challenge to Fitzsimmons, but the cheer
ing drowned his voice.
Fitzsimmons raised his hat in acknowl
edgment of his reception. A hoarse voice
from the gallery cried out: "Corbett
won't do a thing to you." Fitzsimmons
appeared angry.
Peter Maher came in before 9 o'clock.
Tim Hurst had charge of the stage, and
Harry Cornish of the New Manhattan
Athletic Club held the watch. Harry
Petersen and Denny Marshall started the
fun with a four-round set-to. Then two
colored champions from Moinetta Lane,
Louis Brodie and R. Billop, pounded each
other to their hearts' content, and were
followed by Matt Matthews and Dick
Behrens, who exchanged very few love
taps.
Paddy McGuggin of Newark and Johnny
Banks of New York, colored, rehearsed
their little "act." Then Joe Harmon and
Marty Delaney went four rounds, and gave
way to Billy Lee and Harry "Force, who
gave a lively exhibition.
Paddy Purtell, the Kansas City welter
weight, tapped Tommy West almost at
will.
Ernest Roeber, the champion wrestler,
and William Marx followed in a Grscco-
Roman wrestling bout, which was won by
the former.
A very fast and scientific bout between
Jack Everbart and Billy Yernon, the
"Haverstraw brickmaker," followed.
The boxers then made way for "Lanky
Bob' 1 in a bag-punchintr exhibition. Mar
tin Julian was in the ring with him. There
was a storm of applause and cries of
"Speech." American B auty roses were
showered upon Fitzsimmons while he was
giving bis exhibition. Fitzsimmons
punched and the crowd roared. Finally
with one terrific swing the burly Cornish
mah sent the sphere flying away into
tbe middle of the crowd.
Fitzsitnmons put on the gloves and
started a three-round bout with Paddy
Brennan. Fitzsimmons' powerful right
rained taps with lightning celerity on I
Paddy's body and the unerring left was
busy on his head. But the champion was
very tolerant and his taps were love-taps
indeed.
The appetite ol the spectators was
whetted to a degree when the announcer
stated that Fitzsimmons would wind up
with Maher. The Irishman has evidently
not lost his hold on the hearts of the
crowd, for he was cneered to the echo as
he stepped into the ring. Before Peter got
on the gloves Fitzsimmons stepped across
the ring and shook nands with his late foe.
Maher's eyes were still swollen and in
flamed. Peter blinked when he faced
Fitzsimmons, and the latter jabbed him
on the mouth. Right and left the cham
pion shot out and caug:it Peter on both
sides of the head. The Irishman closed,
delivering a left lightly on the body and
after some sparring the one-minute round
closed.
The second round was lively and both
did some fast work. Maher's supportors
in the audience were loud in their exhor
tations to Maher to "Knock him out,
Peter," was frequently heard.
Tlie third round was quite as friendly as
the others, but the love-taps were by no
means gentle. They clinched frequently,
and once Fitzsimmons sent a straight left
on Maher's chin and the Irishman's head
went back. Just as the bell sounded they
were clinched and showed no sigua of
breaking.
It was stated that Brady, on behalf of
Corbett, and Quinn. on behalf of Maher,
challenged Fitzsimmons after the exhibi
tion was over. Martin Julian refused to
athrru or deny the statements. Both Fitz
simmon3 and Julian declined to make a
speech, although there were loud and fre
quent calls therefor from the spectators.
THE MARSEILLES REGATTA.
A Fierce Gale Caused the Event to Jte-
suit in a Failure.
MARSEILLES. France, Feb. 29.â The
Marseilles regatta opened to-day. The
sky was clear, but a very strong wind
caused the big race for the prize given by
the President of the republic to result in
a failure, the Britannia having her inain
haiyard block carried away before the start.
The Satanita grazed the starting buoy,
but kept on and went after the Ailsa,
which had got the lead, overhauling and
beating her in a round of eight miles
by three minutes; also beating the 20-rater
Samphire by ten minutes.
All of the boats abandoned the race at
the end of the first round, the wind bav
in?: increased so that it was impossible to
sail with full mainsails.
Forterrillt! Welcome* Main.
PORTERVILLE, Cal., Feb. 29.â A
gentle rain began failing thia evening, and
the prospects are encouraging for a con
tinuance during the night. Grain has
been suffering for the want of rain, and
stock and sheep men report a scarcity of
feed in the mountains.

WAR IN A LOS
ANGELES COURT
Assistant District Attorney
Williams Cited for
Contempt.
JUDGE SMITH'S WRATH.
Objects to Strictures Passed
Upon Him by the Prose
cuting Lawyer.
MUST APPEAR FOR TRIAL.
The Offender Disbarred From Prac
ticing Until the Proceedings
Have Terminated.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 29.â Judge
B. N. Smith of Department 1 of the Supe
rior Court locked horns with a vensrcance
this morning with Assistant District At
torney W. T. Williams, and the latter is
disbarred from practicing in his court
vending the determination of contempt
proceedings "which have been set by the
Judge for Monday morning. The trouble
arose over remarks made by Mr. Williams
on Thursday afternoon in the courtroom
after the court had adjourned and Judge
Smith had retired to his chambers.
After Judge Smith had left the court
room, Mr. Williams, who was very much
wrought up over the instructions in a cer
tain case, indulged in violent language
about the Judge's instructions, and wanted
to know why the Judge had not decided
the matter like a man before leaving the
bench and retiring to his chambers. He
indulged in some conjectures involving
the Judge's ancestry.
Before proceeding with the business of
the day this morning Judge Smith ad
dressed Mr. Williams, wh > was present to
try a burglary case, and told him that he
had been informed of the violent language
Williams hud used, and that he consid
ered it contempt. Mr. Williams wanted
to know who had told the court about it,
but this the Judge declined to state, say ?
ing merely that he had the language in
writing and it would be made a part of
his remarks, to be taken down by the
court stenographer. He did not desire to
make a personal matter of such an occur
rence, but he considered the language an
insult to the court, and an attorney guilty
of using it should not practice' before him
until he purged himself of the contempt.
Judge Smith cited Mr. Williams to ap
pear before the court on Monday and
answer to a charge of contempt.

The Government Begins Action Against
the Southern Pacific.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 29.â A suit was
riled here at (j o'clock this evening by
United Slates Attorney-General Harmon
and United States District Attorney Jones
on behalf of the United States Govern
ment against the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company, the Central Pacific Rail
road Company, the Metropolitan Trust
Company of New York City, mortgagees
of the Southern Pacific Company; the Pa
cific Wood, Lumber and Flume Company
of Nevada, the Pacific Improvement Com
pany of California and some sixty indi
viduals. The suit involves nearly tne en
tire town of Wadsworth, the west end of
the Pyramid Lake Reservation in Washoe
County and the railroad property and
buildings in Wadsworth, with a total value
of $.100,000. The sixty individuals made
defendants in the case are persons who
have leased or purchased lands from the
Southern Pacific.
The complaint alieges that the railroad
company has for years past illegally occu
pied the lands. It took possession under
an act of Congress passed in I*2 and
amended in 1564, by which the company
was granted alternate sections along the
road. Section oof the complaint aiieges
that at the time the railroad took posses
sion the grant to the corporation was null
and void, from the fact that the lands in
dispute were already occupied and in pos
session of William O'Neil, Alexander
O Neil, Isaac R. Lebo and Oleric Werner
and the Pyramid Lake reservation. Sec
tion 6 of the complaint alleges that the
patents to the Southern Pacific Company
are null and void and out of the power of
the Land Department to issue, the lands
being reserved from the effects of the land
grants of 1862. The complaint asks the
court to Eet aside the grants.
The case is the most important of its
kind ever brought in the State of Nevada*
and involves interests in New York, Cali
fornia, Nevada and Kentucky. The Metro
politan Trust Company of New York holds
a ereat deal of the Jand, as mortgagees, in
security for sums of money advanced the
Southern Pacific and Central Pacific com
panies, and the individual defendants
have occupied the property in the town of
W T adsworth for twenty years or more.
The papers were filed by the United
States District Attorney at. C o'clock, just
in time to save the rights of the Govern
ment, as at midnight the right to sue
would have lapsed under the statute of

Beet-Sugar Culture to Be Added to the In-
dustries That Will Support the
Town.
SUISUN, Cal., Feb. 29.â The people of
Buisun and vicinity are awakening to the
natural advantages tying at their door,
and have begun to move to develop these
resources. Last week an election was held
to decide the question of bonding the
town for $42,000 for a new and adequate
water supply. Out of 151 votes cast there
were only 6 opposed. The result of the
election has caused general good feeling
in the town, and to-day an organization
was perfected to carry out the experiment
of planting sugar beets in the country
lying contiguous to Suisun. The meeting
was an enthusiastic one, and was attended
by many farmers and business men.
The organization us to be knuwu as the
Suisun Sugar-beet ana Improvement As
sociation, with the following ollicers:
President, A. A. Dickie; vice-president,
William Pierce; secretary, Meyer Dinkel
spiel, treasurer, Samuei Stewart. Fifty of
the most prominent people in this section
enrolled themselves as members, and this
number will be increased fivefold. Many
farmers have already secured the seed for
experimental purposes, and others have
applied. The seed is being furnished by
the proprietors of the Solano Republican,
who have done much to effect the organ
ization and stimulate the movement.
PORTLAND'S SENSATION.
Charges of Immorality Against a Promi-
nent Man Arrested for Alleged
Embezzlement.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 29.â Constable
O'Connor this morning returned from
Newburg, whither he went last evening,
bringing with him H. N. Bryant, the
general agent here of the Mutual Reserve
Fund Insurance Company, arrested at
Newburg yesterday on a warrant issued
from Justice Geisler's court. Bryant is
accused of the embezzlement of $100 from
J. D. Patterson, a solicitor working under
the directions of the accused.
Bryant claims that this move on the
part of Patterson is to supersede him, if
possible, as the local manager of the com
pany's office. He professes his ability to
.clear himself at his preliminary examin
ation Monday morning. Since his arrest,
though, there are many rumors afloat of
big having engaged in dishonorable work
before Patterson fell a victim to his wiles.
Bryant's wife recently deserted him be
cause of this fact. It* is expected that the
defendant's private life while here will be
fully exposed at iiis examination. Among
the papers found in his waste basket was a
letter from Lena Brandt, a morp me fiend,
who threatened to expose him if he failed
to send her $25 by a messenger.
Pattor^op, who is a church member,
says that he would not have prosecuted
Bryant had iie not written him a scurrilous
letter, accusing him of all manner of crime,
including iutimaoy with a married woman.
This letter also will be introduced in the
testimony.

to livurder his wife,. Catherine de Poister.
He. was released from jail only yesteruay
naorning, having served six months in lieu
of a:.52000 bond to keep the peace.
De Poisier's troubles began about eight
months ago when his wife learned of some
of his exploits with other womeu. She at
once began a suit for divorce. This en
raged De Poister and he threatened to kill
her. He was arrested, and as he could not
furnish a bond was sent to jail. His wife
subsequently secured a divorce and wa3
awarded the custody of the two children.
When released yesterday afternoon De
Foister went to Santa Clara to see his wi.e
and children. The couple spent the even
ing together and had about patched up a
peace.
Sirs, de Poister conducts a restaurant,
and when De Poister came in for breakfast
this morning and saw his former wife
talking to George Schultz ; a harness
maker, whose place of business adjoins
the restaurant, he seized a Cleaver and
chased Mrs. de Poister and Schultz out of
the restaurant. He was arrested a few
minutes later on complaint of his wife and
charged with assault to murder, was
arraigned and his examination set for
Marca 5. Bail was fixed at $500.
De Poister claims he made no attempt
to injure his wife, but says that Schultz
drew a revolver on him. He claims
Schultz and Mrs. de Poister are conspiring
to keep him in jail.
SOUTHER* PACIFIC SUED.
Attempt to Recover the Value of Property
Lost in the Baden Wrrck.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 29.â Marshall
Bond, a Santa Clara capitalist, to-day
commenced a suit against the Southern
Paciric Railroad Company to recover s4ls '65
alleged to be the value of personal prop
erty lost in the wreck at Baden on Janu
ary :!Â»j. The property was contained in
two valises which he had checked from
Jan Francisco to Santa Clara. The rail
road company tendered Mr. Bond $100 in
reparation of the loss of his property, as
serting that its liability was limited to
that amount, as set forth "in a stipulation
printed on the back of tickets.
The suit will be watched with interest,
as the question of whether the railroa4
company has a right to fix a limit to its
responsibility and the acceptance of a
check and ticket binds a person to the
provision has not been passed upon in
this State.

BESTS IN THE OLD GRAVEYARD
The Hallowed Spot Opened to the
Public for the First Time in
Twelve Years.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 29.â
A solemn hush prevailed throughout the
old Franciscan Mission Church this morn
ing, as the last rites were conducted in
Bernard Ilcnry ticrhart Hrusemeyer, Murderer of Patlier â  npiror i ci-JinauU
[From a photograph taken for ''The Call" by N u-ton.]
honor of the murdered Father Superior,
Ferdinand Bergmeyer. Dim lights were
burning and faintly illuminated the pic
turesque interior, with its faded frescoed
ceiling and the old picture;? on the walls,
while the blue smoke of burning
incense hovered over the large con
course of people assembled to do
honor to the dead. High pontifical mass
was celebrated by Bishop Montgomery,
assisted by Father Adam, Vicar-General of
the Los Angeles diocese; Rev. Father
Meyer, president of St. Vincent's College,
Los Angeles, and Father Ferrer of this
city. On either side of the altar were
twenty-five members of the Franciscan
order, whose sad faces and coarse brown
cassock.? formed a somber background for
the rich robes of the celebrants. The
music was supplied by choirboys fmm the
Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, who stood
in the loft above the entrance.
The congregation was made up of con
trasting elements. Humble and modest
native Californians, who for years have
worshiped in the old church; many lead
ing Protestants from the town, together
with tourists and strangers, all united in
common sorrow and veneration for the
noble life brought to *o tragical an end.
The English address wa9 delivered by
Father Meyerâ an eloquent and feeling
tribute to the aged priest, and the closing
remarks moved every heart.
"The Master whom this dead priest
served bo faithfully he tried to imi
tate by his own humble, innocent
and faithful life," said the speaker.
"In some respects we may liken
him to his Master. Christ himself was
betrayed. So, likewise, the precious life
of our friend was taken by one who had
every reason to look to him as his best
friend, one who owed to him almost every
thing except life. Chri3t on the cross
prayed, 'Forgive them, for they knew not
what they do.' This sacred man, in his
agony, with a beautiful, humbJe spirit,
said to his murderer: â¢Friend, why hast
thou done this to me? Have I deserved
this treatment from thy hands?' "
An earnest and able address in Spanish
was delivered by Father Adam, after
which the concluding ceremonies were
held at the new tomb in the little grave
yard attached to the mission, where the
body of the Father Superior was deposited.
This was the first interment occurring
here for twelve years, the burial ground
having been closed to the public for that
period. Kuses bloom freely here; a few
trees wave their boughs in the breeze;
Amonj: many old stones a little tablet in
one shaded corner is pointed out to visit
ors as the grave of Ramona's foster
mother. *
Prominent among those who witnessed
tne ceremony was the dignified figure of
Edward Everett Hale, a man who stands
ai the head of American writers, and who
has wielded a wider influence, possibly,
than any other writer of this century. Mr.
Hale, with wife and daughter, ia spending
the season in Santa Barbara, making his
home in the beautiful Hazard residence,
overlooking and adjoining the Mission.
He is pale and worn, but, to those who
noted, his presence, bis reverent demeanor,
his grave and sympathetic countenance,
his faithful attention to the ceremonies,
were among the chief honors paid to the
good and holy man who has gone to his
long rcai, sent by an assassin's merciless
hand.

PETALUMA BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Cleverly Trapped While Attempting to
Gain Entrance to a Store.
PETALUMA, Cal., Feb. 29.â John and
Joe Bryan, who figured conspicuously in
the murder case of blind Nancy Meagher
some time ago and who have long been
suspected of the various thefts of chickens
in this vicinity, were cleverly surrounded
and captured at 11 o'clock last night
while cutting the iron bars which pro
tected the skylight of Hale Bros.' dry
goods store on Main street. A tailor, JU
Engelke, who sleeps in an adjoining build
ing, being aroused by their operations,
gave the aiarm, and the building was
quickly surrounded. Police Officer~Bier
kle and two others ascended to the roof
and Bierkle leveled his pistol at the Bry
ans with the command "Throw up your
bands," which was'instantly obeyed.
The bolt-cutter the burglars were using
was one stolen with other tools a few
nights ago from Hope's blacksmith shop.
On the way to the city prison one of the
burglars was detected throwing away a
skeleton key. They are both young fel
lows, but have grown bold because of the
inability of the officials to conlirm their
guilt in other depredations.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 29.â Fire in
the Hallett & Pirtle block, at the south
west corner of Broadway and Fourth
streets, this morning caused damage to
the amount of about $11,000. The origin
of the fire is not known. The building is
a three-story structure, and the occupants
of the second and third doors had a lively
time in the blinding smoke trying to save
their persor.al effects. The H."C. Fiske Jr.
Company, general agents for the Davis
sewing machine and Dayton bicycle, claim
daniages to their goods to the amount of
$*500. The heaviest loser is C. A. Judd,
who said he carried a stock of $7000. which
*as insured for $3500. It is believed the
losses of the others in the building will
amount to about $2500.
STANFORD'S FIELD DAY.

Several Coast Records Broken by
the Athletesâ Belmont Loses
at Baseball.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
29.â The freshmen baseball team left early
this morning for Belmont, where it met
and defeated the Belmont School team. A
number of buses were chartered for the
use of those who wished to see the game,
and quite a few students went up to "root"
for the fruahmen. The game was a good
one, though but seven innings were played,
some of the Stanford players having to re
turn to the campus in time for the after
noon game. The score was 7t06 in Stan
ford's favor. In batting honors were about
evenly divided, but the individual playing
of the Stanford freshmen was superior to
that of their opponents.
This afternoon the first field-day contests
of the season, between the classes of '98
and '99, took place. An immense crowd
of enthusiastic students turned out to wit

DISCOVERY OF A
STOCKTON MAN
Sunbeams as a Substitute
for the Roentgen
Rays.
HIS PROCESS SIMPLE.
Successfully Photographs a Coin
Inclosed in a Leather
Pocket-book.
HE IS ONLY AN AMATEUR.
Chemicals Slightly Different From
Those Ordinarily Used Enter
Into His Plan.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 29.â F. E. Man
chester, a well-known clubman and ama
teur photographer of this city, to-day ex
hibited to his friends a very fine, untoned
photograph of a 25-cent piece inside an
ordinary morocco purse. Mr. Manchester
expects in a few days to announce the dis
covery of a method whereby this kind of
photography can be done without any rays
other than the sunlight and by a much sim
pler process than that discovered by Roent
gen. Chemicals slightly different from
tnose used in ordinary photography enter
into his plan, and he now claims for it an as
sured success. He says that in a few days
he will make known the exact methods by
which the pictures can be taken. Of the
general principles of his work Mr. Man
chester to-day said:
"I have been reading about the cathode
rays ana I imagined that these same rays
of light were in the sunlight as well as in
electric light. I tried the experiment yes
terday at the Stockton Athletic Club,
photographing a purse with a coin in it
by the aid of sunlight alone. I gave two
iiours exposure and it resulted in giving
the outline of the purse with the coin in
the center. This was done by the aid of
reflectors. The purse was placed between
the lens and the plate, making, properly
speaking, a shadowgraph. I used 26 X
Seed's plate.
"I had been tryine on this thing for
about a week with varying results. My
latest specimen will, as you see, compare
very favorably with any specimens yet ex
hibted by those producing them by the
new method."
APPOINT Kit BY BUDD.
Sargent and Cobtt Smiied at Agricultural
Association Itirectors.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 29.â Governor
Budd to-day announced the appointment
of Koss C. Sargent and Frank D. Cobb on
the board of directors of the San Joaquin
Valley Agricultural Association. Both are
MR. EUGENE MCCARTHY.
Within twenty miles of Bakersfield,
on the Southern Pacific railroad, is a
ittle way station named Poso. It is the
home of the gentleman whose portrait
appears above. Mr. Eugene McCarthy
is a carpenter in the employ of the Kern
Land Company in Kern County. I can-
not give you a minute description of Mr.
McCarthy, still the few tracings will
convey to your mind what a whole-
souled, downright good-hearted fellow
he is. Rugged, even picturesque in
speech, with a fund of native humor, he
presents to you the correct idea of the
true son of toil.
Mac is believed in Poso. You can see
that if you just walk a little behind him
and watch the fellows who speak to him
as he passes by. There is that peculiar
glitter in their eyes that tells you that
Mac is the proper sort of fellow to go to
when one is. in trouble; that he never
forgets a friend and is quite likely to for*
give an enemy.
I was charmed with Mr. McCarthy's
conversation. He spoke so feelingly, it
was really a pleasure to talk to this
honest workaday fellow. He had his
views too. He knew the needs of the
people. He realized their necessities,
and he was for ameliorating them. What
interested me most was his own personal*
prominent men of this county. Sargent is
thn wealthiest landholder here. Sargent
takes L. U. Shippee's place and Cobb that
made vacant by N. S. Harrold. The ap
pointments give general satisfaction.
FIGQ RAXCH SOLD.
Valuable Land Disposed of to Sat

STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 29.â H. R. Mc-
Noble, as commissioner, to-day sold the
well-known Figg ranch, consisting of 400
acres of the finest land in this county, at
public auction to satisfy a judgment for
|14,413 11, obtained by J. C. Ing under
foreclosure proceedings instituted by him.
The land was bid in by J. C. Ing Jr. for
$13,000, but it is understood that it will be
resold by him to H. Barnhart. The land
was purchased by the late E. P. Figg for
$30,000.
THE SAN DIEGO FLEET
Departure of the Monterey on
a Cruise to Puget
Sound.
Rear-Admiral Beardslee Praises the
Work of the Naval
Reserve.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 29.â "The Phil
adelphia will remain in the harbor until
about March 15 and will then go outside
and remain five or six days for target
practice," said Rear-Admiral Beardsley
to-day. "Then we shall leave this part of
the coast for good, so far as the present
cruise is concerned, and will return north
ward. Our departure, however, is contin
gent upon circumstances, but I think it
will not be before the 15th. The Monterey
left this morning and will proceed direct
to Puget Sound. The new Government
drydock at Port Orchard has lately been
finished and it is the desire of the Navy
Department to test the dock. The Mon
terey has been selected to make the test."
"Have you observed the naval reserves?
What is your opinion of them ?' ' was asked.
"They have been on the ship several
times during our stay in the harbor, and
I have admired their aptitude in handling
euns and in various forms of practice. Of
course they could not expect to equal the
men who make it a business, but they do
very well. I shall take pleasure in recom
mending them to the department.
"The formation of the organization
known as the Naval Reserves indicates the
military spirit that is inherent in the
people," addfd tne admiral. "Take the
National Guard for instance. They take
up .uns and perfect themselves in the
manual of arms naturally. But it
is much more difficult to become
proficient in naval tactics. I could
take any bright young man and make a
soldier out of him in forty-eight hours, but
a good sailor on a man-of-war is not so
easily turued out. Even if he should
readily acquire proficiency on board ship,
the doctor might have to get through witn
him before he could become a sailor.
"I think the idea of educating a body of
reserves for the navy is a good one. There
is encouragement in the work for reserves
themselves, for every young man cannot
by reason of circumstances become adept
in naval tactics, while any of them can be
come versed in the calling of a soldier.
In times of emergency these reserves re
ceive a training that may tit them to be
come officers in the navy."
There are computed to be over 300.000
commercial travelers in the United States.
ity. He told me that he had just recov-
ered from a serious sickness, and told
me that this was entirely due to the
native sarsaparilla now so well known
on the Pacific Coast. Said he:
"I have every reason to be glad and
every desire to praise the great home
remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla,
because this vegetable preparation has
completely cured me of a stomach and
kidney disorder, and I take great pleas-
ure in recomnjending the remedy. Be-
fore I began using Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla my appetite was poor, 1 was
nervous and easily exhausted, I had all
the symptoms of a kidney affliction,
such as bloating, harsh and dry skin,
scanty urine, back pains, coated tongue
and impaired memory.
"It is not well to dwell on these things.
I would not say a word but that I feel
that I must show my gratitude to Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. We people that
live off from doctors sometimes have to
take ourselves in our own hands, and
that is just what I did. I used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla religiously. I
kept away from the starchy foods, ate
dry toast and used little sugar. With
the assistance of Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla I became as strong and rugged as
you now see me, and it is only a little
ROMANCE OF
WALLA WALLA.
Flight of a Young Man
Who Feared Marital
Vicissitudes.
ANGRY WEDDING GUESTS
Relatives and Friends Await in
Vain the Coming of the
Bridegroom.
HE HAD FLED FEOM THE CITY.
Threatened With Physical Punishment
for Humiliating a Pretty
Girl.
WALLA WALLA, Wash., Feb. 29.-Fred
Paul, a member of a prominent family
here, was to have been married to a beauti
ful girl yesterday, but when the time for
the marriage ceremony arrived, he was
missing. He has not since been seen.
Some time ago Paul wooed and won a
fair maiden of Walla Walla, a young lady
of nineteen summers, who graduated with
high honors last year from the high school.
The wedding was set for New Years, but
the young man made no preparations for
the event, plausible excuses were invented
and the marriage was postponed.
Finally the young couple agreed upon
February 28 as the date when they should
become man and wife. The young lady
made every preparation for the eventful
day. Two o'clock, the hour when they
should have clasped handsjbefore the altar
arrived but no bridegroom. The guests
became impatient, the bride anxious and
the parents set out to tind the necessary
adjunct for the continuance of the pro
ceedings.
Inquiry was made.of the young man's
parents, and there they rr-et with open
eyed astonishment. J. H. Paul, the
father, had not learned of his son's in
tended marriage, and said that Fred had
left on Monday evening for Dry CreeK to
visit his sister for a few days. An investi
gation followed and it was discovered that
the young man had taken all bis clothes,
but instead of going to Dry Creek haa left
for parts unknown. The news was re
ported to the expectant assemblage and
the waiting guests dispersed, while the
poor girl was overcome with disappoint
ment and humiliation.
No cause is assigned for the young man's
sudden disappearance. His friends are
much disappointed. He was considered a
bright, promising youth, always upright
in business dealings, and that he should
prove dishonorable in a love affair con
founds them. The young woman has
some very earnest and robust male rela
tives nere who, should they come across
Paul, will not fail to physically emphasize
their displeasure at his unmanly and
cowardly conduct.
while ago that I was just the reverse.
Any one wishing to know more about
this vegetable preparation may write to
me, and I shall only be too glad to tell
them what the remedy has done for
me." \
After leaving Mr. McCarthy I spoke to
one of the section-hands about the rail-
road, and he told me that everybody
around there was glad to see Mac look-
ing so well. Said he: "It is remark-
able. Quite a mild sensation has been
created around these parts by Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Everybody ia
speaking of it, every one is recommend-
ing it, and there is no doubt but that
many people will take it this spring."
After leaving this good fellow I felt in
a contemplative mood, and I could not
help but think what a good thing it
would be if some means could be had of
getting the San Francisco druggists to
sell Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla when
people asked for it. I know too well
from experience that many sales are loÂ°t
because the druggists stab the remedy
They will resort to all kinds and a U
methods. Why they should be against
the native remedy I don't know. It i 3 a
good idea to publish the letter as written.

The rooms of the Union League Club in
the Palace Hotel glowed last night with
unwonted brilliancy. The northeast
breeze that made overcoats a stern neces-

sity on the outside was forgotten in the '
warmth of true Republican hospitality on
the occasion of the reception extended by
t'velub to the visiting delegares to tbe
Republican State Central Committee meet
in tr in Pioneer Hall in the afternoon.
From 9 o'clock until long after midnight
the visitors came and went, exchanging
congratulations on the magnificent pros
pects for a Republican President for
In fact, congratulations were so plentiful
that some were left for President Cleve
land for the masterly manner in which he
Las swamped tLe Democratic party be
tween duck-hunts.
The officers of the club honored the oc
. by appearing in eveninc dress, and
they were not idle for a singie moment in
the pleasurable duty of entertaining the
guests. President George Stone seemed
to have several doubles in each room, or,
in other words, he seemed to be every
where at one and the same time.
Wc-ii-known Republican faces were
prominent among the throng. Towering
in stature among the rest was Harbor
Commissioner Dun T. Cole of Sierra,
who^e head and countenance are str.k
ingiy sugg fe stive of those of Abraham
Lincoln. Near him were observed the
clean-shaven classic features of Frank D.
Ryan, Sacramento's District Attorney.
As bronzed as a granger from the rich
semi-tropical valley of the San Joaquin
was Senator Flint of San Benito, he being
in strikins contrast with his vis-a-vis,
General John F. Sheehan, whose visage.
adorned with jet black mustache and im
perial, is of the Louis Napoieon order of
physiognomy.
Among the tall men was Deputy Su
preme Court Clerk McGraney uf Sacra
mento, and in physique he was an excel
lent foil for Commodore Cornelius O'Con
nor. Supreme Court Justice MeFarlanu",
S. M. Shortrhiae, Judge Dibble and Judge
<'arf enter, who hai's from the whole of
Southern California, were prominentiy in
evidence. Wendell Easton, who nerei
misses a Republican gathering; General
Backus, Charles If. Sbortrulge, C. H. Reed
of San Luis Obispo, A. Hochtieimer of
Glenn, Guy C. Earl or Alameda and others
of oe Old. Guard were in the front rank of
the knights hospitallers of the Republican
fort.
They ;at in groups of twos and threes
and fcurs chatting of politics and pros
pects, md out of the confused murmur of
many /oices in many keys, and through
the Ji;-ht blue cloud- of tobacco smoke that
veiled' the talkers, arose the form of Wil
liam McKinley of Ohio. His name was
mentioned frequently as one of the avail
able candidates for tne Presidency, but the
general opinion appeared to be tnat it was
too early in the season to predict the prob
able winner of the laurels of the nomin
ation. . A .
President Stone interrupted the general
conversation at 10 o'clock by inviting the
rs to the banquet-room, in which a
collation with punches and other refresh
ments was spread. The acceptance of the
invitation converted the banquet hall into
a conversation-room.
The charm of tbe entertainment wa9 the
absence of all stiffness or formality. The
visitor was made to feel at borne, and
nothing in the way of entertainment that
would tend 10 make his position irksome
was expected of him. The greatest har
mony prevailed during the evening, and
the occasion will long be remembered as
one of true Republican hospitality, unal
loyed with even tbe slightest trace of
seltiohness.
FIRE AT STOCKTON.
Business Places Flooded in an Attempt to
Subdue a Blaze â Great Dam
age Done.
STOCKTON, Cal.. Feb. 29.â The guests
of the Yoseinite Hotel were driven from
their rooms this morning by a tire which
broke out in the Hook building, which ad
joins the hotel on the east. Th* fire was
found to be in the lodseroom located in
the third story. For a time the liremen
were unable to get at the blaze and the
smoke which poured from the windows
gave the fire a threatening appearance.
The iiremen in their efforts to subdue
the flames flooded the Arcade, the Hook
and a portion of the Yosemite Hotel build
ings on Main street. The damage done by
the fire was very light, but a dozen busi
ness places located on the ground floors of
the buildings were Hooded and toe loss
cannot be less than $55,000. The places of
business are closed pending the adjust
ment of the losses. The cause of tire is
unknown.

FfiESXO'S GREAT RABBIT DRIVE.
Expected Victory Turned to Partial De
feat by a Jilunder.
FRESNO, 'Cal., Feb. 20.â "Somebody
blundered on the right- wing" has often
been written in explanation of greater
losses than that which was sustained by
the great army of rabbit drivers fifteen
miles west of this city to-day. The column
of rushers was the largest that ever par
ticipated in a drive in the San Joaquin
.Valley. Tiie hunters were tnere â hun
dreds of themâ and the rabbits were there
âthousands of them â but the mounted
Â«,: "cer in charge failed to do his duty, and
when victory seemed assured it suddenly
turned to defeat.
somebody else blundered in failing to
bare an irrigating ditch on the line of
march drained before the drive came off.
This ditch was encountered just before the
fence lines were reached. If the unskilled
and undisciplined mass of humanity arhich
wa- the base to the great triangular field
bad been in line this ditch would have
paralleled it throughout most of its extent,
which meant about six miles. Instead of
a line with all abreast it was a straggling
and disconnected rabble, apparently ira
bued with the idea that every fellow was
for himself and his bison-hoofed majesty
take the hindermost.
it ..appened that there was a large num
ber of speedy sprinters near the center of
the line. These readied the ditch first.
Owing to the lagging of the right win;:
the wriggling, swarming mass of rabbits
was to the right of the center, huddled on
the bank of the ditch, which had a water
surface of from ten to twenty feet. The
center of the mob made a sharp turn to
therigxt of the ditch, and rushed upon
the lir.e quadrupeds with the supposed
purpose of forcing them into the ditch.
The rabbits suddenly, and as if by one
impulse, faced their foes, seen! ing to
observe the great gap in the right wing,
where ti.ere were only a fewmen_and boys
with dubs. In an instant thousands of
the pest- rushed for the broken line.
The air was rent with the deafening
yells of a thousand throats, raised in the
hope of calling attention to the blunder,
but it was too late, for tbe larger portion
of the army of rabbits had saved itself by
this grani coup. Several hundred â pos
sibly thousands â crossed the ditch, and
many of these were clubbed to death and
left on the tield.
Only a fe;v hundred, where there should
have been thousands, were finally forced
into the corral and slaughtered.
The army of drivers was large and un
wieldy,every conceivable conveyance being
in the line; the aide 3 were few and far oe
tween, and of generalship there was none.
Yet despite these drawbacks hundreds of
the long-earod pests were killed. No seri
ous accident occurred to mar the pleasure
of the day. A few carts and buggy wheels
were smashed and innumerable shins
were barked by clubs in the hands of reck
less boy?. Soon after the line was formed,
about 10:30 a. ji m rain began to fall; there
was a light shower in the afternoon, and
to-night it is rainine in earnest.
The , native dogs of Australia, of Egypt,
and of the Persiau desert never bark.

Time, 1:15.
! ting. Fortnna, Arnette and Fred Gardner
looked out of their class, and long odds
were offered against them.
There was not much to the race the first
part of it but Lovdal. the favorite, and Ar
! nette. When ott half the distance had
I been covered Lovdal and Donathon's mare
! had enough, and Installator began draw
; ing away, followed by Fortuna. Swinging
I into thestreich the 12 to 1 outsider began
I forging ahead, and easily outfooting the
i prohibitive choice to the wire won easily
I by two lengths in 1:5.3 flat. Fred Gardner
was a poor third. The winner was beaten
out by B^aw Scot in a mile dash run
i on Thursday, and his win was a startling
j surprise. The value of the stake to the
I first horse was $1500*
The cold weather kept many indoors,
I which showed its effect at the track, the
; attendance being considerably less than
the usual Saturday crowd. A light fall of
rain left the track dead, and in most of the
events slow time was the rule. Favorites
i and outsiders broke even, three of each
j getting their noses past the wire in front.
A six-furlong run, with seventeen very
ordinary selling-platers going to the front,
was the* first event on the card. Norman
die, with Chora up, ruled a 2% to 1 favor
ite, and taking the lead from University in
the stretch won easily by a length. The
latter horse was nipped out for the place
the last jump by Polaski.
Ten members of the kindergarten class
started in the half-mile two-year-old dash.
The gray youngster Grey hurst was again
a hot favorite, going to the post 3 to 5.
The GO to 1 chance Lindendale led up to
w.tbin 103 yards of the wire, where Jones
got the favorite up and in a drive won by
a short head. Rienzi finished a strong
third.
Those who backed Cicero to win the
steeplechase scorned students of the "dope
book" and dug their hands deeper down
in their trousers-pockets after the race,
while the many that had backed The Lark,
who had first call in the betting, smiled a
sickly grin. The followers of J0 C tried
to look wise, but it was a forced effort.
The result of the race hit the crowd hard,
for the winner did not carry much outside
coin. Arctic led the way over the first
four jumps, when ThP Lark temporarily
showed in the lead. Cicero headed him,
taking the sixth jump, and in a drive to
the wire won by two lengths. Mestor was
a poor third.
It was thought the leap-year special at
five and a half furlongs would be a great
sprinting affair, but it proved another
Cakewalk for the 'Kansas City Hindoo,"
George Miller, first choice in the betting.
He ran Theima to a standstill, and, taking
the lead in the stretch, won very handily
by a length.
The second choice, Derfargilla, barely
beat Thelma out for the place in a drive.
The wind blew Â«o hard as to seriously
retard the progress of tne 3 to 5 choice,
Levena C, in the concluding six-furlong
mazourK2, and Loth she and Mr. Garner
finished just behind the money. In a hard
drive the 100 to I shot, Catch Em, was
beaten out a nose by the 20 to 1 chance,
Seaside. Four lengths away, Meadow
Lark, at 10 to 1, was third* ana it is
claimed that figures and midnight oil will
beat the game.
Track and Paddock Items.
Tod Sloane was slow to get Vinctor away
from the post.
John Bfenock, the well-known Western
tnrfman and owner of the great jumper,
fct. Brandon, was warmly greeted" by his
many friends at the track yesterday. Mr.
Brenock has been ?pendine several days
in the southern port. on of the State.
Harry Griffin appears to be growing
heavy sreadiiv. He could not ride under
110 pounds yesterday.
Little Pete took a peep at the moon
through a telescope and had a good bet
down on Fortuna.
The judges did not like Chevalier's ride
on liienzi an i oncstionÂ«d him about it.
He claimed his mount was cut off, which
in a manner vr;.s substantiated by Patrol
Judge Havey. T. Murphy was also quizzed
by the officials in regard to his handling
! of The Lark.
King Street is reported to have shown
some fast triais. but he did not cut much
figure in yesterday's race.

Mr. Sankey was born in Edinburgh, Pa.,
in 1840, of English ancestry. His father
was a man of affairs and a member of tne
Legislature of Pennsylvania. He was a
leader and exhorter in the Methodist Epis
copal church.
The gift of song manifested itself early
in life in Ira D. Sankey, and while still
very young be began "singing the gospel."
as he calls his. appointed work. When but
16 years of age he" was received into full
niember^'jip in the Jefferson-street Metho
dist Episcopal Church of Newcastle, Pa.,
where his parents were then living. He
afterward became active in tne Young
Men's Christian Association of that town.
Mr. Sankey met Mr. Moody at an inter
national convention of the Young Men's
Christian Association belaat Indianapolis,
Ind., in Ij7l. Mr. Moody "discovered"
the modest genius, and after much persua
sion led him to consent to join his Chris
tian efforts with his.
Together they held meetings in the chief |
cities' of this country and England with j
remarkable success, and continued these
labors until recently.
Perhaps none, of 'the "Gospel Hymns"
with which Mr. Sankey has thrilled^ so
many audiences is more famous than
"The Ninety and Nine." He found the
poem in a newspaper. The melody to
which he adapted it came to him as an
inspiration; and he sang it to a great audi
ence witnout having written the music.

NEW TO-DAT.
The big, hearty, healthy man is a contin-
ual irritation to his dyspeptic friend. Ont
man in a hundred is perfectly healthy.
The other 99 have some digestive trouble,
and perhaps more than 50 per cent, of
these could trace their trouble to that most
prevalent evil â constipation. It's a simple
thing of itself, but like many simple thing9,
it may grow and become complicated.
Constipation is the root of nine-tenths of
the sickness of men, and of a large propor-
tion of the sickness of women. It can be
cured. It can be cured easily, naturally
and quickly. There is no reason save that
of carelessness why it should cause the
trouble that it does. Nature is continually
working as hard as she can to throw off im-
purities, and to force out poisonous refuse
matter. Nature is not a dray-horse and
should net be overworked. Nature is sys-
tematic. Some little thing may interfere
with the system, and cause serious derange-
ment. The removal of this little impedi.
ment sets the wheels wonting again with-
out any trouble.
This is exactly what Dr. Pierce's PleasaaS
Pellets do. They assist nature in a gent l^
healthful, efficient way." There is nothing
violent about their action, and yet it is 3 jst
as certain as if it were twice as violent
The use of the "Pellets" doesn't derange
the system in any way, and once it is in
order, you can stop taking teem. There
are unscrupulous druggists, who will tell
you that something else is "just as good."
They are mistaken âor worse. Whethef
they are ignorant or untruthful matters
little to you if you do not get the "Pel-
lets." Insist on getting what you Â«fk tot, ,

WHY
â¢â¢ W W H fl W
' ; * t t â  JBL JMI JL
IS DOCTOR SWEANY acknowledged as San Francisco's
LEADING AND MOST SUCCESSFUL SPECIALIST?
BECAUSE
His reputation has been established by effecting CURES of
CHRONIC DISEASES IN MEN AND WOMEN where other
physicians of acknowledged ability had failed. Diseases
which had reached a stage before which the most skilled and
experienced physicians stood powerless have yielded to his
treatment, and praise and gratitude are received from RICH
and POOR.
W%r Â«nf Q CTftP and consider aright this unparal-
ntLMaJEn vl IUI leled and overwhelming testimony.
It means that a cure is effected of every case that is under-
taken.
FACTS ARE STUBBOBM THINGS,
CHRONIC AND WASTING DISEASES
Of the Throat, Lungs, Heart, Stomach, Bowels, Kidneys and
GENITO-URINARY ORGANS have been Doctor Sweany's study
for life. There are cases of this character which, through neg-
lect or improper treatment, are beyond medical aid, but there
are many more given up as hopeless simply because incompe-
tent physicians have failed to effect a cure. This especially
applies to diseases of the BLOOD and the GENITO-URINARY
ORGANS, and Doctor Sweany yearly saves thousands from be-
coming mental and sexual wrecks.
YOUNG, MIDDLE-AGED AND OLD MEN,
If you are suffering from the effects of early indiscretions, ex-
cesses, emissions and unnatural losses, which rob the blood
of its richness and the body of its animating influences, which
enfeeble the constitution and finally result in Impotency,
Paralysis, Softening of the Brain and Insanity; if you are tor-
mented with morbid fear and your days are passed with dis-
tressing thoughts of your disease, if you are unfit for the every
day duties of life, if you have any or all of those symptoms you
are suffering from SEMINAL WEAKNESS, NERVOUS DEBIL-
ITY and their kind red causes.
THE FIRST THING TO DO
In order to get cured is to cast aside ail false modesty and
place yourself under the treatment of this noted specialist.
His experience in the treatment of such diseases has been
world-wide. He has cured thousands of others and CAN
CURE YOU.
GONORRHOEA, GLEET, STRICTURE, and that terrible and.
loathsome disease, SYPHILIS, thoroughly and forever cured.
THE POOR, who call at his offices on Friday afternoonsÂ»
are welcome to the doctor's valuable services free of charge.
WRITE
Your troubles if living away from the city. Thousands are
cured at home by means of correspondence and medicines
sent them. Doctor Sweany's patients will get all the advan-
tages of experience and travel in Europe with diligent study in i
her best Medical Institutions. Letters are answered in ENG-
LISH, GERMAN, FRENCH, ITALIAN, SWEDISH, NORWEGIAN
and DANISH.
NAMES of patients or their diseases are not published or
exposed., but there are thousands of testimonials on file in
Doctor Sweany's private office. They are voluntarily given as
true, deep arid sincere expressions of gratitude from our mer-
chants, manufacturers, mechanics, farmers, lawyers, laborers
and literary people, who have been cured by him and made
happy. It is a part of judgment and sense to seek Doctor
Sweany first, instead of squandering away time and money
upon the uncertainties of patent medicine and picayune spe-
cialists. 7

MISS OVERMAN
TALKS AGAIN.
She Explains Certain De
tails of the Tunneii
Letters,
TOOK PEN AND PAPER.
The Much- Wanted Witness Knew
Nothing Unfavorable to Her
Character.
MSS. DAVIDSON WIIL APPEAE.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper Warmly Attacks
Dr. Brownâ Deacon Morse Before
the Committee.
The Brown scandal developed no very '
new sensations yesterday, though the
prosecution declares with much earnest
ness thai they have, several new and im
portant witnesses, who are expected to
give new and damaging evidence next
week. - â 
Mrs. Cooper says a 7 ady has come to her
with very important testimony, though ;
she declines to go into detail now, fearing
ifcat justice will be defeated in the end.
Tnis witness will appear before the com
mittee on charges at its next session and, :
tell what Bbc knows. The lady claims to
be able to prove all that she might say.'
Miss Overman has apparently entirely
recovered from the nervous attack brougat
oa by the foar hours* strain before the j
council. â¢ Yesterday, in company with Dr. ,'
Brown, she visited Captain -Lees and held
a long consultation â¢ .th him. The subject.
matter was presumably concerning her
story, wherein she" acknowledged that at
one time she contemplated blackmail and
did actually steal and forge the Tanne.ll,l
letters. The chief of detectives, she said,
assured her of his protecting arm should
the occasion present itself calling for the
exercise of cis power.
"This has been a terrible thing for me ;
to do. said Miss Overman last night, "but '
it was eitner no down myself or have an
innocent an suffer wr>.:. . :' -..y. I pre
ferred to sacrifice my pride and character,
if need be. for the take of truth and jus
tice. There are many more things I would
li&e to have told, but" I suppose they will
ell come out in cross-examination."
"Alter securing the original letters from
Mrs. TunnelPs room and rilling the en
velopes with forged documents, why did
you put them back into your friend's room
at ail?" was asked by the reporter.
â Because/ answered Miss Overman. "I j
did not want them to be found | in my pos- :
tesiion. It \ronld be an easy matter to go.
and pet tftem if I ever needed them, If"
the Chronicle had demanded proof of the
story offered them it would 'have been
more convincing to have produced letters
written to and in the possession of some ;
one else. I could have; got them at any *
time."
"Can you explain," the reporter then
asked, "bow it came that the paper used !
for letters written to Mrs. Cooper and J
others while in Tacoma is identical with i
the paper used m the Tunnell letters?"
â¢'That is a very simple matter." said the j
yoccg lady. "When I left Tacoma, I 1
placed in my trunk two or three pads of !
paper â the kind I had always used. And |
when " â¢ j
"The ink . hag been analyze".."' inter- i
rapted the reporter, "and found to be the j
same :n all the letters." .
'"Yes. 1 know. It so hapcened that when '
I came away. I put a bottle of ins in my
trunk also. This was a very natural thing
to do under the circumstances, and I doa't
suppose there will be any question raised
about it. . Of course, all these little details
tad points will be brought out in the
cross-examination, and 1 shall be able to
answer them all satisfactorily to the coun
cil and the public
"There is MrÂ». Eaton's testimony con
cerning what Mrs. Tuanell said to her
that Monday morning, and 1 know that
my friend said nothing of the kind.
They simply misunderstood her or else j
placed a wrong construction on what she
did say. Mrs. Tunneil knew absolutely
nothinc wrong except that I was in love
with Dr. Brown. I told her that she
would be called upon probably to testify
to this fact in court. She is old and
feeble and felt as I did that it would be
a hardship that she could hot bear at her
time of life. The oniy way to avoid this
was for her to leave. There is no excuse â 
for dragging Mrs. Tcnneii into this un
fortunate affair, and if I could I do not .
know that I would bring her back.
"I have received several letters from
her, but can honestly say I do not know j
her present whereabouts."
While Miss Overman has recovered from
the physical exhaustion incident to her
examination before the council her face
has taken on lines not apparent when she
last appeared in public. Her eyes look
heavy and weary as though from tears and
the mouth looks pinched and drawn. Al
together, Miss Overman Las quite a de
jected air and seems to feel keenly the
fearful position in ' which . she has volun
tarily placed herself. However, the young
lady declares with much earnestness that
she" will stand' the tire of the cross-exam

ordeal. She appreciate! the fact that this
will be the crucial test of hex strength.
physically and mentally, and bas nerved
perself to face it because, as she declares,
it is her duty.
Dr. Brown declared last night that he
had discovered how the 0 â  â¢: an-] _nn.eii
letters came to light.
"A letter has just reached me." said the
paster, "which makes many things clear.
At the proper time, which 1 believe will be
next Tuesday, iwill introduce evidence to
show, first, that the letters were offered to
me, and, second, tr.at they were hawked
about generally until disposed ot fora good

but my informant says that he received
$1500. I will show by the man who stole
them that they came from Mrs, Tunnel. *

went to an attorney and endeavored to
secure his aid in disposing of them.
"This man was employed. at the World's
Co-operative Society, and is consequently
a member of the gang wiio have said so
much aoout me. 1 will prove by compe
tent witnesses how this man came to my
door, and while I did not kick him out I
curtly declined to purchase at any price
the famous letters." IP^SIJ 'â¢-"
Mrs. Cooper is inclined to treat with con
tempt tee statement made by Miss Over
man concerning the Tunnel! letters.' At
the same time sLe scores Dr. Brown for
permitting the young lady to sacrifice her
; self to save him.
"I am not inclined," said Mrs. Cooper
last nieht, â¢' to criticize in any way Miss
â  Overman's explanation of these letters.
In a general way 1 may say that it is most
preposterous, and to t'faiuk for a moment
; that she would expect so intelligent a
body of men to believe it is absurd.
'As for Dr. Brown, 1 his attitude in this
matter is thoroughly in keeping with the
man. For him to put up Miss Overman as
a bulwark, behind , which to hide his in

faroy. is detestable. It is no more than was
I to be expected, however, but he will rind
i in the end that he has made a mistake
I that the public will not submit to. New i
! evidence â ':':..- infamy is pouring m every !
I day and the council is not half throueh j
I with its work. I have submitted to them

I showing Dr. Brown to be a thoroughly
bad man. The writers of these letters i
I will not appear before the council in pub
lic, bat have signified their willingness to

I They give, as a reason for this, that they
do not care to be mixed up with so dis
graceful an affair. These letters show that
Dr. Brown visited many places on Market
street at various times of the day, remain
ing from one to three hours
"Dr. Brown's attack on Mrs. Stocfcton
will avail him little. She might have been
a bad woman, but of that I know nothing. \
She needs a protecting arm now. an I in
tend to do all I can for her. There are
many peculiar phases connected with Mrs.
Stockton's stay in the churcn of which no i
notice has yet been taken, ror instance why
j didfMrs. Brown object to Mrs. Stockton's be
coming a member of the choir two months
after that lady had joined the church,
when some months later, I think it was in
May, she demanded that Mrs. French ac
cept her as a participant in the Turkish
tea?"
Deacon I. H. Morse returned from Bos
ton last night, where he has been for some j
weeks past looking up the record of Mary
A. Davidson. He finds that she has a
â  brother connected with the Fire Depart
ment of Boston who, when asked if he had
a lister by the name of Davidson, replied
"Yes. she is a very devil." Mr. Morse has
certified copies of her Eastern record,
; wbicn he will submit to the council at its
next session.
There was an interesting little tilt
between Dr. Brown and Miss Hattie Cooper
at the close of Friday's session of the
: council.
â¢â¢We only made one mistake to-day, Dr.
Brown," said Miss Cooper.
"Yes, and what was that?" inquired the
reverend gentleman.
"That we did not have an officer here to
arrest Miss Overman on a charge of con
spiracy the moment she stepped from the
witness-stand."
At Wednesday's session of the council
Judge Advocate Woodbams said Mrs.
Davidson bad been forbidden by her attor
ney, George A. Knight, to appear as a
witness. It appears now, however, that
this statement was made without the
authority of the alleged blackmailer. She
declares that no one has requested her
presence before the council, though she
voluntarily came on one or two occasions;
hoping to be called. She is perfectly
wiiiine to appear at any time provided she
receives three Hours'" notice. Rev. Mr. |
Rader has the matter in hand, and will i
see to it that Mrs. Davidson gives her state- i
ment before the case is finally closed.
Mrs. Stockton does not feel as kindly
toward Dr. Brown as she did before his
vigorous attack on her character on Fri
day night. "Dr. Brown," she said,
"should take off the Grand Army button
he displays so proudly. He should fight
Ike a soldier and not stab a person in the
back, particularly if that person happens
to be a woman. I do not see why he is
permitted to make these charges against
me, but if it was right he certainly abused
the chance shamefully, I declare most
emphatically that not one of the charges
he made against me are true. If I had
dreamed that he. dared do such a thing I
should certainly have been there. â
"I wonder if Dr. Brown remembers the
peculiar manner in which he baptized- me.
After I had joined the church be asked
me if I had been baptized. \ 1 told ; him -I j
bad not. He then asked me to come up to
the study after the morning service and he
would perform the ceremony.; I went up,
and while we were talking very pleasantly
Deacon Yasconcellos opened the door and
came â  in. He . was surprised , and embar
rassed and got no further man the thres- j
; hold.. The reverend gentleman; was equal :
to the occasion. 'Well, I am glad you
came up,' be said, ' for 1 was about to fiend
for you.' He then told the deacon that he
i was going to baptize me, and asked him to
be a witness. Of course I was gnttOf sur- ' i
prised, for I had always entertained the I
idea that peorie were baptized ia public." 'â 
MRS. DAVIDSON TO APPEAR.
She Expresses Herself Freely Re
gard! Miss Overman's Testi
mony Before the Council.
Mrs. Davidson is perfectly willing to
testily before the council. Yesterday after
noon she had a long conference with the
Rev. Mr. Rader, a member of the council,
during which she assured him of her
readiness to appear before that body at
three hoars' notice.
"You see."' she remarked quite cheer
â  fully to her reverend interlocutor, "I can
j not put on my bonnet and go at a
' moment's notice. Nor can I remain an
; indefinite length of time waiting to testify.
A deal cf red tape has to be employed in
â â  order to get me out jof my present lodg
ings. Hence you may easily perceive that
I must be summoned by the council for a
certain prearranged hour, and with at
least three hours of anticipation in order
to be able to attend at all. And besides a
Sheriff's officer must accompany me and
remain with dm ail the while. The state
ment that I have refused or am unwilling
to testify before the council is untrue,
though, candidly speaking, I can see no
reason for so doing."
"B_t, Mrs. Davidson," remarked - Mr.
Rader, "what we desire is to get at the
truth, and you may be able to aid us very
materially.''
."Of course I will go if called.that is if I
am allowed," resumed Mrs. Davidson.
"Mr. Knight has never advised me to re
fuse to testify, and sometimes it seems as
though 1 o__ht to go. But then, you
know what Dr. Brown is. ' What would
; become of me if I appeared before him at
the council and said, | Thou art the man ?
He is a dangerous man when his blood
is up." "
"Perhaps things may not be quite so
threatening as you seem to fear, - ' said Mr.
Rader. - *
- '"In any case." was Mrs. Davidson's an
swer, "I wish it distinctly understood that
I am willing to appear before the council
if peed be." ; .
'.'Then we may expect yon?" asced Mr.
Rader.
"Yes," answered the aged prisoner.
"And now, may the aged prisoner. will
"And now. may I ask. wnat lines will
your testimony follow?" was Mr. Rader's
next query.
; "I must" consult Mr.: Knight before I can
positively state," answered Mrs. Davidson.
: "but it seems to me that it would be use,
less and painful to dig up all the filth in
the case again. Mv idea would be to get
at the substantial facts in Miss Overman's
' testimony and prove them false by direct
; evidence "to the contrary.; This would cast
discredit upon her entire testimony and
clearly show its unreliable character."
"Can you count upon any corroborative
testimony .* asked the council man.
"As : to* that, ,r answered Mrs. Davidson,
'.'the confessions i made to me by both the
guilty parties were very private, and with
out witness. Miss - Overman acknowl
edged to me on ' the ? 10th of September,"
1895, and Dr. Brown on the 21st of Novem
ber of the same year, that their relations
had been criminal. Dr. Brown with many
tears assured me that he had been*-break
ing tbe seventh commandment again and
again ? for a long I term 'i. of ' years. '? I would
have kept these things secret were it not
that they have already become public. If
I am permitted I will go and give in my
testimony; whenever the council may so
request." :..'â â â â [â  X-., v. -'.'.''â ;
'-'â : To the question as to her opinion of Miss
Overman's testimony before the council,
Mrs. Davidson gave answer in .no uncer
tain sound. ""-..-.- -â ;-â : ; -:" ; fy. â 
"Her statement is a tissue of lies," said
the old ; woman; in evident indignation.
"She speaks of a plot wherein she and I
conspired to blackmail Dr. Brown, but I
never knew anything about such a pIoL
Miss Overman tried to sell the Chronicle a
story in which the wrongs done her a
distinguished man were to form the plot.
'â  On her return from I the Chronicle office 1
____S__Â»SSSÂ»3r "â  â â -.;â â â  -?. - ;â¢ â =! .--.^. _ -: -.--=-â *"-ââ â¢: - :__HSS&_>
asked her whether she had sold her story.
She answered thai the Chronicle people!
had said they would see about it. Teen I
asked her if she had given them her name, \
to which she answered in the negative.
" â¢ Did you give them the man's 'name?'
I then asked.
"Oh, no, 1 she answered; 'I am not
quite so big a fool as that. If the Chroni
cle folks knew his name they would get
after him for money and fill their own
pocket?, leaving me without a cent.'
"I then reminded her of a remark which I
I had heard Dr. Brown make, to the effect '<
that the Chronicle building was known
among business men as the 'tower of â 
silence.' Mattie then told me she had
seen Mrs. Tunnel!. Some time before Dr.
Brown had told me that Mrs. Tunneli once
saved Mattie when in the very act of de
stroying herself, and that Mattie had been
very fond of her ever since. I asked Mat
tie why she had wished to com suicide,
but she refused to answer.
"The next day, I think it was. Mrs.
Tunnell and Miss Overman came, to my
store. Mattie seemed exhausted. .'The
mean thins!' she exclaimed; 'all he is
eoing to give me is $35 a month, and
hundreds would not begin to atone for all
the suffering that man has caused me. It
took Mrs. Tunnell to get even that
wretched amount out of him. And now
he expects me to co to Heald's Business
College.' Both Mattie and Mis. Tunneii
seemed indignant at the distinguished
man's parsimony. I said nothing. ; :v ; ; "
"On the following morning Dr. Brown
called and gave me $35 for Miss Overman.
He said the amount was small, considering
that she would attend Heald's Business
College, and asked me to let her have a
room with me. Then, m an instant, I
knew who the 'distinguished man' was.
I was shocked beyond all expression, and
could find nothing to say. The next day
Mrs. Tunnel! came to inquire whether
Mattie had received her money. She also |
remarked that the amount was' ridiculously
small, considering the mental and physical
suffering which Mattie had been obliged
to endure by reason of Dr. Brown's rela
tions with her.
"Then I told Miss Overman what had i
passed. When I spoke of Dr. Brown's re
quest that I accommodate her with, a
room, she flew into a terrible passion. 'I \
am in no need of a room,' she cried, in.
great indignation. 'If I wished, I could
pack up my things and go to Dr. Brown's
house, and they would not dare to deny
me admittance. I have a better right '
there than Mrs. Brown herself, and if she
should attempt to bully me or intertere
with me in any way whatever, I could say j
one word that would make her shut up her I
mouth and keep it shut for the res; of her
days.'
'"'I nest told her how Mr?. Baddin had
informed me of the visit of Dr. Brown and
Mattie to the lodging-house at the inter
section of Sixth and Bryant streets. Mat
tie broke down altogether and then told
me the dreadful story of her wron -doing.
It was a terrible ta!e and I was quite pros
trated by the mere hearing of it. I know
it is said there is no Mis. Baddin, or that I
am she but ' this is . false. Mrs. â¢ Baddin
came lo me in November, asking for work.
We met several times. When she told me
of Dr. ; Brown and Mattie gome to the
Sixth-street V lodging-house she said she
would 'threaten' the pastor and in case he
would not pay her for ; silence ! she I would
publish' the story to the world.; That was
on Tuesday, November 19. The next even
ing she came and wished ime > to trc with
her to see Dr. Brown, but it being prayer
meeting night: I prevailed upon her to
postpone the visit. ,Â°
"The next day, Thursday, I sent for Dr.
Brown. When I saw him' I told him all I
had heard. ";.. He felt to weeping most bit
terly ,*and amid his sobs kept saying, 'It's
all true, it's all true.' 2We talked for
severaljhours, and I reproached him -with
having pretended , to ! confide ; his tempta
tions in me ; when ; all ; the while vhe was
guilty of the most dreadful crimes. -'Not
crimes,' he said , : 'only sins of. weakness.
I was sorely^ tempted. ;/ My ; home life has !
been sown with bitter ; trials, and many : a I
time I have been tempted to J give up mv J
church and co ? with Mattie, but v I have 'â¢â 
committed Ano : crime.' Tl> looked him. i
' straight in the face and asked : 'Dr. Brown, \
Co you mean to say that child-murder is 1
: not* a crime?' He made no answer. I
then told him of Mrs. Baddin s threats.
He did not wish her to see bias, and .-::: s
; the matter to me.
*'I advised him to make a full confes
sion of his sins before the deacons, resign
bis pastorate and commence life over
again in some other part of the country.
He left me, protesting that the interview
had given him more peace of mind and
conscience than he had enjoyed for many
year?.
; "Mis. Baddin came on Friday, the next
â¢day. 1 told her Dr. Brown did not wish
to "see her, and I went to his oSce alone.
He wept when he saw me, and cried ost
that he had wronged his soul by a grievous
sin, and that there was no mercy for him.
. We prayed together for a while, and then
he said: 'Now, let us reason together, as
the Bible recommends. A confession of
-â :.â¢â  sin would wreck my family, scandal
â  ize the church, and kill "my old father. I
am reconsecrated to God and will bepin a
new life here in my pastorate. I have
sworn to change my ways, and swear it
again, so help me. God. It is necessary
now to be politic I will pay this woman
off, and no one will be any the wiser. I
can let her have $503 down, and $35 a
month if she will keep quiet. I am pay
ing Mattie $35 a month now, and that's on
j the same linÂ«Â».'
"He then asked me to write a receipt for
$500 at his dictation, giving me a paper
with the church letter-heaa on it, which
he tore off. I asked why I should write
the receipt. He said he did not want his
name or writing to appear in the transac
tion and wished the receipt only as a
memorandum for his own use. When I
finished writing he took the receipt and
sealed it in an envelope on which he wrote
his j name and address, saying that he
would put it among his papers in the Safe
Deposit. At half-past 11 o'clock the fol
lowing morning Dr. Brown gave me $500.
which I turned over to Mrs. Baddin. On
Sunday, the next day, he said to me, 'I
feel, at last, relieved and happy. This sad
affair rests with God and yon and me. I
leave you to manage Mrs. Baddin. 1 " v
"Since that time"l have no knowledge of
the whereabouts of Mrs. Baddin or of Mrs. ;
Tunneil. I never knew Mrs. Tunnell well j
enough to know her address. I know Â» she i
went to Tacoma in March, 1595, and re- j
turned in May, bringing me a letter from
Miss Overman, with a water-color painting
of Santa Catalina Islands, which Mattie
Lad painted forme. Poor Mattie's absence
in Tacoma was directly due to the physical
results of her intimacy ~ with Dr. Brown
and her health suffered severe! v. 8.-.
Brown is no ordinary man. He is* an ac
complished hypocrite, a veritable wolf in
sheep's clothing.
'.'â¢After paying me the money for Mrs.
Baddin, while he was trying to railroad ]
me over to San Quentin, he introduced me i
to several persons as 'a , mother in Israeli' J
And now he has got ; his victim to sacrifice 1
herself yet more .= oy lyinji and perjuring
herself in his behalf. Any child could see
through the desperate tries.*
''Dr. Brown is a drowning man clutching
jÂ»t a straw. I ought to pity him, and I do
pity him; but his conduct throughout this
affair, proves him to be I the greatest liar
: that ever lived. I have learned to 1 know
him through and through, and 1 know the
truth is not in him. . I would not believe !
him under oath." â

A DANGEROUS OPERATION.
George Ebe's Stomach Will Be
Searched for a Half-
Dollar.
Hereafter the Cathode Ray Process
Will Be Employed Upon Patients
at the Gernan Hospital.
An extraordinary and Terr dangerous
! operation will be performed upon a patient
j at the German Hospital to-Â»ofrow morn
ing by Dr. John F. Morse. This .5 â -..-.
ing less than cutting an incision through
the abdominal cavity to the stomach and
probing around for a silver half dollar that
â¢was swallowed tj the patient ten days aro.
George Ebe's ailment is a most singular
one. His home is near Stockton. Last
Friday, while seated at a table and king
' with his brother about money matters,
| Ebe playfully tossed =, half dollar in his
I month and closed his lips upon it. In
' stantly and most involuntarily the coin
was swallowed. In vain ail ordinary
methods of dislodging the coin were tried.
Then Ebe came down to San : Francisco for
treatment. He went to Dr. Morse, and
the Islter advised him to go the German
Hospital. Ebe is a strong, robust young
man, and will submit himself to the op
eration bravely.
Thursday it occurred to the surgeons
that if the exact whereabouts of the coin
could be located that knowledge would
simplify matters considerably and maka
the operation much less dangerous. With
this end in v:ew yonn? }":â ; was placeA
under the operation of the X ray as ap
plied or Professor Roentgen. The ap
paratus was set up with great care and
was operated by Professor Wenxeii, who
made the experiments in Berkeley. The
experiment was very thorough, bet never
theless it proved unsuccessful. After Jci.Â£
exposure of the plate, as long as the patient
; could stand, upon development it revealed
no marts whatever.
- This has been rather disappointing to
Dr. Morse and his patient, as the danger
ous operation will now have to be per
formed without the aid of this ' occult
science. However, fcotn are in pood spirits
and the best results are hoped for. A creat
deal depend* upon whether the coin is
located at the fin* incision: Aside from
the pains in the abdomen caused by this
foreign substance Ebe is in good health
and strong and hopeful.
The lack of success attendice one of the
first applications of the Roentgen process
in this City has not discounted the scien
tific men most interested. Dr. Leuschner
the house surgeon of the German HoÂ«pit*i*
said yesterday thii he thought the cath
ode ray process would become a permanent
institution at the hospital. â¢
"We hardly expected any. results from
the expenmenr upon the patient EbÂ« "
said he. "because, the subsUuce to be
penetrated by th[ rays was entirely too

San FMMSCISCO. Feo. 29, 1896.1 j
To the Honorable Beard of Police Commit
tionrrsâGfntlemen: I respectfutiy tender my
resignation as Chief of Police of the City and
County of San Francisco.
I iuciose Herewith application to be retired
ender provisions of seeiion 3of the pension
My object in sending in my resignation at
this'time is to take a much needed rest after &
service of more than twenty-three years as
Chief of Police of this City and County.
Thanking you kindly for many favors ex
tended to me, and hoping our friendly rela
tions will continue in the future as in the past,
I am, gentlemen, very respectfully.
P. Ceowley, Chief of Police.
The news quickly spread, and caused
the greatest consternation in the depart
ment. It was not at first credited, but
when it was known to be a fact there was
a -universal feeling of regret that the noble
oM man, broken down by grief at the loss
of his son, should have found it necessary
tq take such a step.
The Chief was seen in his office yester
day afternoon. His face wore traces of
the suffering he has undergone since the
death of his son, and while talking about
that and his resignation his voice often
faltered, and the unbidden tears came into
nis eye?.
â¢*ies, M he said, "it is true that I have
sent in my resignation. lam glad and yet
am sal ; glad to get a much needed rest
and be away from all this worry and re
sponsibility, and sad to sever my connec
tion with the Police Department, which
has been in effect the spirit of my life. I
am getting old now. lam 65 years of age
; next month and cannot expect to live
many years longer, so I think I wili spend
i the remaining years of my life in peace
and quietness with my family.
'â This is no new thing with me. Four
\ years ago I signified my intention of re
sLning, but was prevailed upon not to do
; so. If I had carried out my intention then
my son mig t have been spared to me.
"I have seen Mr. Tobin and Mr. Alvord.
'1 hey did not want me to send in my fesig
-1 nation, but I insisted. They asked me at
least not to retire till April "l, but I want
; to get away as soon as possible and have
, asked that my resignation take effect on
i March 10, and that is the arrangement as
present.
â¢*I leave the department a poor man, but
I will have my pension. lam too old to
go into any business, but my pension will
1 keep me from want.
'I have striven to do my duty honestly
: and feariesÂ«!y, and I defy any rr.ar. to say
: that I have been guilty of any dishonor
; able act during my term of office. The
; newspapers have always treated me fairly
: and kindly. The department has often
' been attacked, but I never was personally
' attacked except once, and that was about
twenty years ago by an evening paper, and
', I was able to prove to the editor that he
\ was wrong.
"I have, of course, my enemies, but I
think they simply consist of men who
1 have been discharged from the department,
: and the department was well rid of them.
"The trouble with me has been that I
' have been too sensitive. When the de-
I partment or any member was attacked I
worried over it as much as if I had been
personally attacked ami that has told
i upon me. lam physically and mentaliy
stronz yet, but I felt the effects of the coa
â  stant Worry and must have a rest.
"I have always tried to be a friend to the
i men under me and have taken a personal
1 interest in each and everyone of them.
| Only one man betrayed my confidence
and'as toon as I was satisfied that he h d
done so 1 took prompt action and ha<l him
disnrssed from the department, "ies, I
mean Cierk Hall. He was a black sheep."
"Suppose the Commissioners should re
fuse to entertain your resignation and offer
you a vacation for two or three months,
what would you do?"
"They cannot compel me, replied the
Chief, ''to remain against ray will. I have
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
made up my mind finally to retire and
they will accept my resignation."
ftTfae Police Commissioners are ready
enough to express : their re_ret over the
resignation of : Chief Crowley, and say
tnere .is nothing left for them to do but to
accept it, but they are ' reticent in regard
to the naming of a "successor. Several per
sons have been mentioned in connection
with the place, but there is just a pos. _-
bility that the commission may go outside
of .the police force entirely for its selection.
Still it is all a matter of speculation j and
no action will be taken for some little
time, as the Commissioners say that they
will give the matter careiul consideration j
before making the appointment. Chief j
Crowley will be prevailed on to remain in j
office until his successor is appointed.
"In the resignation of Chief Crowley,'' j
said Commissioner Tobin last night, "the
department has lost a man it will be hard
to replace ana the City has lost a servant j
whose place it will be.' difficult to fill. Ij
have known the Chief since boyhood. He I
has always been found faithful in what- j
ever capacity he was placed. As head of j
the Police Department his success is a ;
matter of public record. He is a: man of !
ereat executive ability. Above all he has
been honestâ a quality that, especially in i
a Chief of Police, far outweighs all others. !
"Crowley was Chief of Police before the j
present commission came into office. Then
tie retired and went into the brokerage
business. When the commission was
created, nearly eighteen years ago, the de- j
partment was more or less steeped in i
politics. The late Major Hammond, Mr.
Alvord and myself were appointed on .the j
board, and on looking about for a suitable j
person to take the head of the department j
we unanimously decided on Crowley. We j
selected him for his worth. He then had
a history as Chief of Police.
"Chief Crowley had the faculty of select
ing capable men as assistants. He has
filled his office most creditably, and who
ever takes his place will have no sinecure."
"Has the commission discussed the
question of a successor?" was asked.
'â "Well, we have thought of several men,
but no action has been taken in that direc
tion, and it is yet early to discuss the situ
ation. When the selection is made, how
ever, thtÂ» people will feel satisfied that an
honest, capable man hasbeenc hosen. There
is no more responsible office in this State
than that of Chief of Police of this great
City. He has to deal directly with the
vices of the town, gambling in ail its
phases, enforce the law and preserve
order.
"Chief Crowley's retirement," said the
Commissioner, with much feeling, "is a
source of great personal regret to me, as
for eighteen years we came together con
stantly in our official relations, and though
be is a" stanch Republican ana I a Demo
crat we never crossed swords. I entertain
for him only the warmest affection."
Commissioner Alvord also speaks in
I praise of Chief Crowley's splendid public '
I service, and Commissioner Gunst has only i
words of commendation for the veteran
, officer.
Among the possibilities as Chief Crow
j ley's successor is Captain Lees, the vet- * ;
i eran Chief of Detectives. He is considered 'l
I among the rather limited available timber
' in the department, and his long and faith-
I ful service would probably go a long way
; in gaining for bim this most responsible
; office, should he consent to assume it,
: which is a question.
Captain opillane and Captain Witinan.
are also among those prominently men
' tioned as tbe successor of Chief Crowley.
The statement was made by one of Chief
Crowley's friends last night that he would
soon become a director in the Hibernia
Bank at the request of Judge Tobin.
! There is now a vacancy on the board and
j there fs a probability that the Chief may
| be elected to fill it on bis retirement from
; office.

THE CHIEF'S RECORD.
Something: About the Head of the
Department, Who Has Grown
Gray in the Service.
Chief Crowley was born in Albany, N.
| V., on March 17, 1831, and two years later
; his father removed to New York after his
, mother's ueatb. When a boy he was em
! ployed in a printer's shop, and at 19 he
came to this City on :he steamer Carolina,
lon May 6, 1850. He went to the mines for
a year or two and returned to the Crty and
engaged, in the boating business for a
short time. In 1853 be tried his luck at
[ mining again, but returned the fbllow
j ing year and again started in the boating
i business.
In 1*34 he was elected to the office of
town constable, which he held by election
till 1-560, when he was elected Chief of
, Police. He was elected to the position till
1573, when be retired and went into tue
stock brokerage business. By an act of
Legislature in 1878 the Board of Police
: Commissioners received the power to ap
! point the Chief of Police, and he was re
: iuctantly prevailed upon to accept the
I office. He has held it ever since, being
I appointed every two years, nis last ap
pointment being on December 1.
The Chief proved himself on many occa
tions a brave and feareless man, and one
; who by his personal magnetism inspired
others to deeds of bravery. The first mat-
I ter of any great importance that he
; handled as Chief was the quelling of the
| Potrero riots against the Chinese in 18801
: Then followed the exposure and breaking
up of the powerful whisky ring. In IS7O
I by his presence of mind and bravery he
quelled a riot and saved Quinn, the raur
; derer of Maggie Ryan, from being lynched.
; But the greatest mob that ne ever handled
; successfully was the one that attempted to
! take Alec Ooldenson, the slayer of Mamie
â  Kelly, white on his way to the jail on
Broadway.
The Chief has always enjoyed the fullest
confidence and respect of the law-ab ding
citizens. They knew him as an efficient
i otlicer and an honest and upright man,
{ who had often been tempted but had
never accepted tne cold of the tempter.
\ They admired Mm for his fearlessness and
for his splendid executive aoilty. He
never sougnt notoriety, out was always
modest and retiring, and many received
] credit for things that were planned and
executed by his sagacious mind. His
I reputation is not local ,. but , National, and
! among the chiefs of police departments in
every city on this broad continent he is
respected and recognized as possibly the
ablest ChiÂ«f of them a;l.
j Chief Crowley has shown that be pos
j sesses in an eminent degree the noblest at
! tributes of a manly ruan. Honest and up
| right in the performance of his duty;
i brave to a fault and regardless! of personal
I danger; generous and open-handed with
j his money to assist the poor and needy,
' and kind and forbeanne, yet strict when
â¢ occasion demanded 10 those under aim
i these are qualities that have endeared him
to all those who have had the good for
j tune to come in contact with him, and will
i make his place hard to till,
He has made the Felice Department a
life study and has brought it to such a
! state of efficiency that it is a source of
j pride to the citizens and or envy to the de
i partments of other cities. He will be
j identified with it as longas he lives in
j spite of himself. His retirement will be
keenly felc by all, but especially by the
; men under him. Â«.. .
Captain Lees spoke feelingly last night
jof the Chief's retirement. '\\ c have been
i together," he said, "for over twenty-three
I years now, and he has been a warm friend
:to me. I shall feel his retirement possibly
: more than any one. A more upright or
honest man never lived, and that com
bined vrith intellectuality and sagacity
I made him an ideal thief. Yes, he ia de
i termined to retire. That is settled.

Peter Crumbaugh, the Big Grain
Farmer, on the Tehama
Wheat Crop.
THE FINEST EVER KNOWN.
Remarkable Growth of the Wild Oats
and Other Products Owing to
the Steady Rains.
Peter Crumbaugh, the big grain farmer
of the Bald Hills, Tehama county, is at
the Russ Honse. Mr. Crumbaugh has re
sided in Tehama for thirty-six years. He
has a large area of timber and grass iand
in the Sacramento Valley asidt; from his
Bald Hill property, which alone consists
of about 4000 acres.
Everybody in the part of the
State knows Mr. Crumbaugh. He does
business oh a large scale, and he has the
reputation of being pretty careful, voo, in
his undertakings. Mr. Crnrabaugh says
that all over Tehama County there prom
ises to be a heavy yield of wheat, oats and
barley this year.
The grain is over four inches high now,
and as green, thick and healthy looking as
could be desired. It is maeh. finer north
of Sacramento than it is down this way.
"The Bald Hills, where my grain ranch

is located, are about fourteen miles south
west of Red Bluff. Just now, where not
sown in grain, the hills are covered with
wild oats. The cats are perfectly green,
too, ar.'l the whole country looks as though
covered with beautiful, luxuriant grass.
"There has been so much rain up our
way that everything is in fine shape. I
hear there will be more rain needed here.
It isn't so there. There has been plenty of
rain.
"The Bald Hills look like a great grain
field. The wild oats never die out. The
oats are not indigenous to that soil. They
were not there tilt about 1868, during the
Yreka excitement. Tne teams that went
along with freight earned hay in which
there was some wild oats. It sprinkled
along a ud the seeds took root. The oats
spread over the country and rooted out
the natural wild grass, which was red-top
and bunchgrass. The wild oat is very
hardy, usetul and is there to stay.
"The whole of Tehama County is quite
prosperous. It is getting more so steadily.
A year or so will put it in tine condition."
Mr. Crumbaugh is in the City on a busi
ness trip. He will probably leave for
home to-night.
A MAJOR'S CELEBRATION.
I An Old Soldier Spent the Day in
Visiting All the Army
Posts.
He Was Seventy-Six Years Old Yes
terday and Claims to Be a
Major-General.
_
"Major-General Charles TF, Emmell,
j February 29, 1820," was the inscription on
| a card presented at the gangplank of the
i steamer General McDowell yesterday
morning. The transport was about to
j start for the army posts and the major
i general was on a visit of inspection.
It was his seventy-sixth birthday and
! he came specially from Yountville to see
i what his comrades in arms were doing.
' The old man was born in a leap year, and, j
; as counting by his birthdays, he is only j
19 years old, he determined to show the |
rising generation that there is still life and j
I energy in the old soldier. He appeared in j
fj.ll uniform, wearing the sword and all
the insignia of a major-general. The only
I departure from the regulation outfit was a
soft hat, which was generally worn by
! oiticers during tne Mexican War.
During a conversation "Major-General"
: Emme-ll said he was 76 yearsoid yesterday
*nd that he had served his country
throughout the Civil and Mexican wars.
; Whether he is really what he represents
I himself to be or not still all the officers of
! the army posts humored him in view of
the fact that he bad fought and bled for
his country.
The McDowell arrived at Ansel Island
just a few moments before rollcall and
I when Colonel Shafter was informed of the i
i circumstances of the ca?e he awaited the j
! arrival of the old man and treated him as
an honored guest. At Alcatraz an attempt
! was made to' stop his lanaing as he had no
* pass, but the commandant overruled the
| officer of the day and the old soldier SDent
j nearly two hours in the island fortress as i
i the guest of the soldiers. When the Me- I
Dowell returned to the City at 6:45 p. jc.
he was still as active as ever and told the
men on the steamer that he had throughly
enjoyed his birthday and would return to
YountviUp on Monday much the better
j for his outing. _
Cashier Ward Promoted.
E. C. Ward of the Oregon Railway and Nayl
gation Company has been promoted to be the
agent of the company at the Spear-street
wharf and will enter on his new duties at once.
For tlxe last year lie has been acting as cashier
of the company In this City and proved him
self so efficient that when \\ . H. Mann resigned
as dock agent ha was promote'! to that posi
tion. The ticket and freieht office of the com
pany was removed yesterday from 19 Mont
gomery street to 630 Market street, opposite
the Palaco Hotel.
WILL OPEN THE SCHOOL.
The Board or Health Finds That the
Longfellow Nuisance Hai
Keen Abated.
After being closed for a week the Long
fellow School, over which the boards of
Health and Education wrangled and neariy
came to legal difficulties, will open to
morrow and remain in session until the
lone summer vacation.
When the two boards met on Wednes
day last to consider the matter it was de
cided that in case the School Directors
would make temporary repairs that would
place the school in good sanitary condition
the institution could open.
Dr. Lovelace visited the school yester
day, and finding that the repairs men
tioned had removed the nuisance com
plained of by the Health Department,
notified the Board of Education that no
farther objection would be made to the
opening of the school.
HASKELL'S CASE DISMISSED.
Judge Bahrs Says There Was Nothing
to Base a Charge Upon.
Judge Bahrs has dismissed the charge of
embezzlement against B. G. Haskell. He
inÂ°tructed the jury which tried Haskell to
acquit him, but the jury thought differ
ently and refused to agree. Judge Bahrs
dismissed the case himself.
Haskell was accused by C. H. Younar of
embezzling $750 of the $1000 he received as
a compromise of one of Young's cases. He
says his fee was to have been jSOO, and he
had repeatedly offered to pay Young this
amount, but Young refused to accept it.
He intends, he says, to bring sui: against
Young for damages which he has sus
tained by reason of Young's proceedings
against him.

The young woman in question, Mrs.

with her husband about a week, but last
evening she made her debut before un

artist. The shop wliere she and her hus

cidedly popu'ar yesterday evening. Not
only was the interior of the snop filled
with customers, but every few minutes St.
C!aire was compelled to cnase the crowd
of spectators from the window.
Mrs. St. Claire first learned the barber's
trade about two years ago. She and her
husband were then residents of Reddine.
They were newiy wed, and with a laudable
desire to aid her husband she derermined
to learn his trade. She succeeded remark
ably well, and in a few months she was
well versed in the craft. Since then the
couple have been wandering about the
country, spending only a few months in
anyone place. They were last in Wash
ington.
Mrs. St. Claire is in one respect a model
barber âshe does not talk. Not even when
she cut a gash in a mans face that would
have thrown a masculine barber into tor
renta of apology did she even as much as
say "Excuse me." She simpJy smiled
sweetly at the spectators, and rubbing
away the blood went on shaving. St. Claire
is apparently delighted with the situation.
PARK FOR THE ATHLETES
The Presidio and Ferries Rail
road Company Will Con
struct One.
BAY STKEET TO BE CLOSED.
The Grounds Are Bounded by Brod
erick, Baker, North Point and
Francisco Streets.
George W. Newhall, president of the
Presidio and Ferries Railroad Company,
has a project on hand at the present time
which, if carried through, will add another
to the pleasure grounds of this City.
''The idea of the company' of which I
am president," said Mr. Newhall last
evening, "is to lay out a large athletic
park somewhere on the line of the Union
street Railroad. We have secured from
the Fair estate, through a lease, two
blocks bounded by Baker, Broderick,
North Point and Francisco streets. The
two lots are divided by an unused portion
of Bay street, and we have petitioned the
Board of Supervisors to close tne street in
order that tne plans we have already de
cided upon for the grounds will not have
to be changed.
"Pissis & Moore, the architects, are at
the present time engaged in drafting plans
for a grand stand and other necessary
buildings. We have provided for the erec
tion of an angle bicycie track, which we
will endeavor to make the finest on the
coast. A baseball diamond and a football
gridiron will also be laid out. and, taking
it all in all, we feel confident that the
grounds, when completed, will be a center
of attraction.
"An advantage embodied in the location
of the grounds over those now used by the
Olympic Club is that they are only twenty
minuies' ride from ihe heart of the City.
They are accessible by three lines of cars.
'From the Olympic Club and places in
that vicinity the Hyde-street cars, which
transfer to the Union-street line, may be
used. The Fiilmore-street cars, to which
a number of the main lines transfer, pass
within a few blocks, and the Union-street
cars, which terminate at the ferries, com
bine to make the 'location of the grounds a
very desirable one.
"We will go to work on the grounds im
mediately after the Supervisors order Bay
street closed, which they will without
doubt do in the near future, and we can
safely say that the grounds will be ready
for use within a very few months."

a son, James Thomas Cullen, in the em

though getting good wages, has driven her
fronf his door and refuses to give her any

THE REPUBLICAN
CAMPAIGN OPENS
Brief and Important Meet
ing of the State Central
Committee.
A NEW PRIMARY PLAN.
Congressional Committees Will
This Year Have the Control
of Primaries.
CONVENTION AT SACRAMENTO.
An Unexpectedly Large Number of
Members Were on Hand From
All Over the State.
The Republican State Central Committee
met at 2 p. m. yesterday in l'ioneer Hall, and
in the course of a session lasting little more
than an hour disposed of its business by
adopting a call for a State convention
which embodies a new plan fur primary
elections.
The utmost harmony was exhibited in
the proceedings of the hour. No business
not relating to the organization of the j
meeting and the call for the convention I
was brought up. But one resolution was
offered and the discussion was brief.
Tlie convention adopted a call for a
State convention and for preceding
primaries as reported by the executive
committee, and in accordance with that
call the primary elections throughout the
State for delegates to the State Convention
to meet in Sacramento on May 5 will this
year be under the control and manage
ment of the respective Congressional com
mittees.
The call will be this year issued to the
congressional committees instead of to
county committees, as has always been
the case heretofore, and it will rest with
the Congressional committees to directly
supervise elecuons themselves or to issue
calls to county committees, which may
then in turn proceed as usual.
This innovation is the result of the word
ing of the call issued by the National Re
publican Central Committee this year.
This call apportions delegates by districts
and provides for district nominating con
ventions. As the .State Convention this
year will ha.ye only Presidential Electors
and Congressmen to nominate, this plan
is more easily carried out than it would be
in a year when State officers are to be
chosen.
Tae unexpected bringing forward of
Congressional district committees in this
manner was followed by some uncer
tainty as to the status of existing com
mittees, the creation of new ones where
necessary and the ways in which the plan
will be put into practical operation.
The work of reviving or creating Con
gressional district committees was begun
at once on adjournment by the State com
xnitteemen representing the respective dis
trict? according to the plan adopted.
Besides this feature of the proceedings
the only other important ones were tbe
adoption of the Estee vote as a basis of
representation and the selection of Sacra
mento as the place for holding the conven
tion. There had been considerable discus
sion throughout the State as to whether
the Harrison or Estee vote should be used
as the basis for the apportionment of dele
gates, but the adoption of the Estee vote
seemed to satisfy everybody.
Sacramento had a walkover in getting
the convention. The boomers for the
capital city anticipated active rivalry
from San Jose and Santa Cruz and pos
sibly Stockton, and a large delegation of
workers were on hand ear!}-, most of them
appearing Friday evening.
Amonir them were: H. A. McCraney,
Frank Rhodes, David Lubin, Senator E.
C. Hart. Frank D. Ryan, Charles Curry,
W. H. Govan, L. H. Brown and "Walter
Thorpe. They soon found that San Jose
had a rose carnival, a railroad and some
other enterprises on its hands, and was not
very ambitious to arid a State convention.
They heard early that Santa Cruz would
be in the field, but Santa Cruz failed to
appear with a bid, as did Stockton, so the
boomers easily got early promises of sup
port from a majority of the delegates, and
thus when the question came up in the
meeting Sacramento got it gracefully and
quickly.
The attendance was unexpectedly large
for a year which brought no hustling in
the line of State politics. The members
came from all parts of the State in the
interest of National Republican politics,
and in both the attendance and in the
spirit of the members present there was an
exhibition of supreme conlidence in the
success of the party this year. The dele
gates present included a large number of
the oldest and best known figures in Re
publican politics in California.
P. B. Cornwall, chairman, presided and
Assistant Secretary Jacob Steppacher was
on hand, with Frank McQuade as an as
sistant.
When Chairman Cornwall called the
meeting to order with a few words stating
the object of the meeting the rollcall fol
lowed, showing the presence of 75 of the
122 members.
On motion of H. P. Sonntag a committee
of five on proxies was appointed by the
chair as follows: H. P. Sonntag, A. W.
Kinney, Dan P. Cole, J. C. Daly and A. li.
Lemmon.
After a Lrief recess, during which all
proxies were received and passed on by
the committee, the committee reported
that all proxies submitted were approved.
Thirty-three proxies were tendered and
then tije roll was called again, showing
the presence of 108 votes, 'ihe following

The rest of the proceedings concerned
entirely the call for a State convention
and a primary election for the selection of
Us member?, as reported by the executive
committee, and they were quickly ended.
Vpon the completion of the call of the
revised roll. Chairman Cornwall announced
thai the report of the executive committee
would be read. He stated that the execu
tive committee had held a meeting that
day and that the report, containing a call
for a State convention and fixing the man
ner of electing delegates, had been adopted
unanimously. He requested Judge J. C.
Da.y to read the report, which he pro
ceeded to do, prefacing the reading with a
brief statement in which he said that the
plan for the primary election adopted was
in accordance with the call for the National
Convention issued by the National Com
mittee.
He read the rail issued by the National
Central Committee, and then the report of
the executive committee, which was as
follows:
In accordance with the direction of the Re
| publican National Committee, that delegate
: representatives of the Republican party of the
t several States assemble in National convention
I at the city of St. Louis, in the State of Missouri,

j of the United States, and for such other busi
! ness as may be brought before said conventien,
: and in accordance with the instructions given
: by Faid National Committee at the city of
Washington, December 21, 1695, directing that
the Congressional district delegates shall be
chosen at conventions called by the Congres
sional committee of each such district in the
same manner as the nomination of a repre-
I tentative in Congress as made in such district,
' provided that in any Congressional district
| where there is no Republican Congressional
; committee the Republican State Committee

trict a committee for the purpose of calling the

Therefore, it is resolved by the Republican
State Central Committee of California, repre
senting the Republican party of said Slate,
that the Congressional committees of the sev
eral Congressional districts of the State of Cali
fornia ere hereby instructed and directed to
cnli Congressional conventions of their re
spective Congressional districts to be held as
hereinafter provided, at which two delegates
shall be chosen to represent each ot such dis
tricts in the National Republican Conven
tion, to be held as aforesaid, and for the se
lection of two alternate delegates to act iv case
of the absence of the delegates first chosen.
The selection of the delegates to the Con
gressional conventions shall be under tne di
rection of the Congressional committee of each
district, and all primaries neld for the election
of delegates shall be under the exclusive man
agement and control of the Congressional com
mittee, provided that the basis of representa
tion of said Congressional conventions shall be
as follows:
One delegate for each Assembly district
within the Congressional district; one dele
gate for each 200 votes cast for the Hon. M. M.
JEstee, the Republican candidate for Governor
in 1894, and one delegate for each fraction of
100 votes or over.
It is further directed that the delegates
chosen to the National Convention shall meet
in State Convention at the city of on
Tuesday, the sth day of May, 189Â«, at 2 o'clock
P. M., to select four delegates-at-large to the
National Republican Convention above men
tioned aud four alternate delegates to act in
case the delegates selected be absent, and for
the transaction of such other and further busi
ness as maybe brought before the said State
Convention.
It is further directed that the test for voters
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
Nt primary elections shall be: "I believe in
Republican principles and indorse the Repub
lican policy, nud intern! to support the nomi
nees of the Republican party."
It is further directed that contests must be
filed with the secretary of the Congressional
committee in writinp, with a full statement of
the ground of conte&t, live days preceding the
meeting of the State Convention. All matters
relating to such contests before the Congres
sional committee, with said committee's deter
mination therein, must be transmitted to the
secretary of the State Central Committee be
fore noon of the 12th day of May, 189 U.
11. P. Sonntag at once moved the adop
tion of the report, but before the motion
was put S. M. Shortridge asked for in
formation as to the scope or the meaning
of that portion of the committee's report
which relates to the holdinc of Congres
sional district conventions and the man
ner of selecting delegates to such conven
tions.
"Do I understand that the committees
now existing in the several Congressional
districts," he said, "shall have full power
and control over the selection of delegates?
That -is to say, taking the northern dis
trict of the State, is all power to be taken
from the several counties and from the
several county committees? Do they have
aucht to do, or is the whole matter in the
hands of the existing Congressional com
mittee?"
Judge Daly replied that the direction of
the National Committee of the Republican
party of the United States was that the
Congressional district delegates shall be
chosen at conventions called by the Con
gressional committee of each such dis
trict.
"That puts it absolutely in the hands of
the Congressional committee of the dis
trict," added Judge Daly. "They are en
tirely independent of this State Central
Committee, and may act without it. They
have that power delegated to them by the
National Committee of the United State*.
It provides further that if mere ba any
Congressional district in which there te
no committee ojgularly organized and
empowered to act the State Comra.t cc
shall provide a committee for it by select
ing residents of that district to form a
district committee. Now, then, the call
puts it in the language of the National
Committee. It puts the power to call the
primary election for the selection of dele
gates to the Congressional Convention in
tlie hands of the Congressional Committee
alone. They have absolute control of the
whole question so far as it relates to ttie
selection of two Republican delegates to
the National Convention, and it provides
further that the State shall be entitled to
four delegates at large, and that these
must be selected by the Republican State
Convention. The call provides also that
the Congressional conventions shall also
meet in the State Convention and select
four delegates at large."
Guy C. Karl of Alameda asked what
Congressional districts had Congressional
committees.
â¢'I don't know, sir," said Judge Daly. "I
suppose such committees were created in
all the districts during the last campaign.
However, that is a matter I have nothing
to do with and I do not propose to go into
the details of the situation."
The motion to adopt the report was put
I and carried unanimously.
Then Sacramento was selected in short
| order as the place of holding the State
I Convention, Judge Cooney made the mo
tion to insert the name of that city in the
blank in the reDort put and adopted and
I Ayres of Santa CJara seconded the motion,
I observing: "Santa Clara votes for Sacra
mento on the understanding that San Jose
j gets the convention two years hence."
Frank D. Ryan of Sacramento said that
I the delegates would be well treated and
! that the expenses of the convention would
I be paid and received applause.
\V. A. Kinney of Los Angeles also sec
| onded the motion and then by a unan-
I imous vote Sacramento won the conven
i tion.
The only thing remaining to be done
was to make provision for carrying out the
primary plan embodied in the call adopted
and S. A. Sheldon of Los Angeles arose
with a type-written resolution providing
that the chairman of the executive com
mittee should appoint a committee of five
to create congressional committees such as
contemplated in the call in districts where
euch committees do not exist. He ob
served that there were probably no such
committees in any of the Congressional
districts.
Sheldon's resolution was not fully
grasped by many of the delegates and a
second reading was called for. George A.
Knight read the resolution again. The
resolution was as follows:
Whereas. The National Republican Commit
tee, in its call of December 14, 1895, requires
that in any Congressional district where there
is no Republican Congressional committee the
Republican State Committee shall appoint
from the residents of such district a committee
for the purpose of calling the district conven
tion to elect delegates; whereas, there may be
in this State Congressional districts without
Congressional committees; now, therefore, in
pursuance of the instructions of the National
Committee, providing for such cases, be it
Resolved, That this State Central Committee
select a committee of five persons to ascertain
at once if there be any Congressional district
in this State where tnere is no Republican
Congressional committee, and if any such
there be, to proceed at once in the name of,
and for this State Central Committee to ap
point a committee of seven persons from the
residents of such district to act as a Cougres
sional committee thereof, and in whom shall
be vested all of the powers and authority given
to regularly organized committees of such dis
tricts.
licsolved, That the following named gentle*
men, members of this committee, be appointed
to act on the committee herein proviacd for,
viz.: J. c. Daly. A. Hay ward, P. B. Cornwall,
T. J. Field and General N. P. Chipman.
W. G. Wells of Contra Costa arose with
an amendment which finally was accepted
though it was found later to be clothed
with uncertainty as to just what it was and
how it would practically work. His amend
ment, expressed orally, was that the mem
bers of the State committee from the sev
eral Congressional districts should select
the Congressional committees for the dis
tricts which they represent.
Sheldon asked that the amendment be
stated again, which was done.
8. F. Ayer of Santa Clara, who is one of
the Supervisors of his county, and who
was one of the best-known members of the
committee, rose and made a brief but
strong plea in behalf of home rule.
"Wells is right," he said. "We don't
want people living out of our districts ap
pointing our committees. The people of
each district snould have the selection of
any committees that are to rule their af
fairs, and should have something to say
about their own elections. I favor Mr.
Wells' amendment."
Sheldon accepted the amendment and
then Sheldon's resolution as thus amended
was accepted with one dissenting vote.
Taylor of Los Angeles suggested that
the State Central Committee should de
fine what constitutes a Congressional com
mittee "now in existence." Some such
committees were appointed, he said, but
there might be a dispute as to whether or
not they are now in existence.
No action or discussion on this point fol
lowed, howevei, and after an announce
ment of the reception at the Union League
Club in the evening the committee quickly
adjourned.
THE COMMITTEES.
Representatives of Congressional
Districts Act Amid Some Un
cartalnty.
Immediately after adjournment the
delegates from several Congressional dis
tricts held short conferences in corners,
and some of them took action regarding
the Congressional committees of their dis
tricts. In other districts action was post
poned.
Discussions at once arose as to the pur
port of the resolution as amended by
Wells, and even the wording of his amend
ment, which had not been written out,
was disputed. Nearly everybody was at
once at sea. The personnel of the various
Congressional committees was largely un
known, and even their existence had been
largely forgotten.
The Congressional committees had not
exercised very extensive functions, as Uiey
were each concerned with the campaign of
but one man who generally managed his
campaign to suit himself, and they had
never cut much of a figure in campaign
affairs. They had never been formally ad
journed or otherwise disposed of and no
body had expected that their resurrection
would ever be thought of. They had be
come latent as it were.
The call adopted by the convention
placed aupreme power and important
functions in the Congressional commit
Hence there arose at once an uncertainty
as to whether or not those original com
mittees of the last campaign were to be
the committees to take charge of the com
ing primary or whether the members of the
State Central Committee from the various
districts should or could appoint new
ones. It was said that in certain districts
those committees were not properly cre
ated, had passed out of existence for cer
tain reasons and so on.
Another point of some dispute and un
certainty was involved in the question as
to whether or not Wells' amendment as
accepted without having been written out
contemplated the creation of new com
mittees, the recognition of old ones or
something else.
However, action was taken by the repre
sentatives of most of the districts yester
day.
The First District organized by electing
A. B. Lemraon chairman and W. A.
Mackinder secretary. The matter of select
ing delegates to the Congressional conven
tion was left to the several county com
mittees, they to call the county conven
tions or to appoint at their pleasure. The
following are the members of the Con
gressional Committee:
D.el Norteâ J. L. Childs.
Humboldtâ J. C. bull and F. W. Luther.
Lassenâ Fred Hi me.
Marinâ W. N. Anderson.

Tehamaâ G. G. Kimball.
Trinityâ P. M. Paulsen.
Sierraâ Daniel T. Cole.
These are also members of the State Cen
tral Committee from their respective coun
ties.
The mcml ;rjhip of the Second District
Congressional committee was largely un
known to the committesmen from that
district present yesterday. Kidder of
Nevada is chairman and George P. Koyster
of Sacramento is secretary. The district
comprises thirteen counties and the mem
bers are widely scattered. It was left to
the chairman and secretary to call the
committee together.
The committee in the Second District as
created at Sacramento by the Second Con
gressional District Convention at the time
of the meeting of the State Convention is
as follows:

The Third Congressional District Con
vention met and ignored the committee
appointed by Congressman Hilborn, on
the ground that they were simply an au
diting committee. The following mem
bers of the State Central Committee were
elected a Congressional committee in their
stead :
Lakeâ J. L. Read.
Glenn â A. Hocheimer.
Colusaâ E. W. Jones.
Yolo-W. R. Pond.
Solanoâ J. L. Martin.
Contra Costaâ William S. Wells.
Alamedaâ Guy C. Karl, C. S. Long, E.
K. Taylor, L. Ingiis, W. W. Morrison and
George Morrow.
It was alleged that no Congressional
committee existed in the Fourth District,
and the delegates from that district held a
meeting in the evening at the Baldwin
Hotel lor the purpose of appointing a Con
gressional committee.
An executive meeting of the members of
the State Central Committee for the
Fourth Congressional District was held at
the Baldwin Hotel last night for the pur
pose of naming the Congressional com
mittee from the Fourth District. Only Su
pervisor Hughes from the Forty-second
District was absent, ali the rest being pres
ent in person or by proxies.
Those present were: W. S. Russell,
Twenty-eighth District; G. Melsing,
Twenty-ninth District; I. S. Cohen, Thir
tieth District ; William Siuarieke, Thirty
rirst District; T. C. Duff, Thirty-second
District; C. P. Curry, representing H. C.
Sorners, Thirty-third District; J. T. Tyr
rell, Thirty-ninth District; J. H. Mahoney,
Forty-third District; A. Ruef, Forty
fourth District, and John Martin, Forty
fifth District.
The meeting wasted no time in organiz
ing. A. Ruet was made chairman and
Frank Worth secretary. Then the follow
ing Congressional committee was named
in accordance with the resolution adopted
at the afternoon session of the conven
tion :
General W. H. Dimond, N. J. Williams,
Jacob Levi Jr., Dr. A. P. Kearney, A.
Barnhard, William T. Howe and James S.
Spears.
The naming of this committee precipi
tated the debate of the evening. County
Clerk Curry pointed out that in two in
stances there were two men from the same
district in this committee, while the water
front and south of Market street had no
representation. He assured the commit
tee that lie had nothing to say against any
of the gentlemen proposed, as tney were
all good Republicans and above reproach
in every way. But he thought that a lit
tle more time should be taken in the selec
tion in order that the representation
should be more equitable.
Senator Mahoney thought that there
was no use in delaying. He was satisfied
with the list as it was, he said, and he
found a majority to agree with him. The
meeting then adjourned.
The Fifth District delegation will meet
at the Hotel Vendome in San Jose next
Tuesday. P. B. Cornwall is chairman and
G. C. Ross of San Mateo is secretary.
J. R. Willoughby of Ventura and C. H.
Reed of San Luis Obispo were the only
known members of the Sixth. The other
members are from Sp.nta Cruz, Monterey,
Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.
The Seventh District Congressional com
mittee was appointed at the last State Con
vention. Thompson of San Diego and
Elliot of Kern are chairman and secretary
respectively.
PEACE AT MILL VALLEY.
Scenic Railway Graders Are to
Be Supplied With Better
Food.
New Orders to the Commissary Re
store Quiet in the Laborers'
Camps.
MTLL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 29.â A great
change has come over the cuisine depart
ment of the Mill Valley and Mount
Tamalpais Scenic Railroad. The presi
dent of the California Construction Com
pany having the work of grading in
charge was here yesterday and inspected
the eating-houses, with the result that the
cooks were ordered to serve better meals
and purchase better food. It is now said
that the commissary is to blame for the
wretched fare furnished the laborers.
The president told this personage that
the company bore a good reputation as to
the treatment of its employes, and he did
not intend to have it criticized now. He
said there were plenty of other commis
saries who could fill his position if he did
not do better.
A Call correspondent visited the camp
of the laborers on Mount Tamalpais to
day. In this place, which is known as the
Upper Camp, are housed every, night
about 95 or 100 men. Half of the rough
building erected is occupied as the sleep
ing apartment of the men, while the
other half is used as the kitchen and
dining-rooms. The partition between the
sleeping apartment and the eating depart
ment runs up only half way and the air
circulates freely between the two. The
bunks of the men are situated in a row,
lining either side of an alieyway four feet
wide. Two nien sleep-in a bunk and there
is an upper and lower bunk. Some of the
men sleep on mattresses, others on loose
straw and the rest on the hard boards.
The company furnishes the place in which
to sleep, but the men must supply their
own bedding. At this camp there are two
cooks and a helper, who do all the work
for ninety-live men.
The flooring in the sleeping department
and in the dining-rooms is mother earth.
When surprise was expressed at these
things the visitor was assured that the ac
commodations were as good as laborers
were expected to enjoy.
Since the food has improved the men
are better satisfied and the work on the
road is going ahead in an encouraging
manner. The construction company hopes
to have all the grading done within three
months, and a force of 175 men is at work.
There are four campsâ one at Mill Valley,
another at Blythedale, one at the head of
Blythedale Canyon and Upper Camp.
President J. B. Stetson of the North
Pacific Coast Railroad was here to-day
consulting with the mountain-road people
as to where the electric line would ter
minate. The North Pacific Coast Railroad
will run a spur track to the power-house
of the mountain road, which will be situ
ated on the Cushing property, between
Blythedale and Mill Valley.

The Well Known Bark Richard
111 at Last Arrives in
Port.
WHERE IS THE XANTHIPPE?
News of Disasters During Recent
Storms Are Only Just Begin*
ning to Arrive.
After Having been almost given up for
lost the bark Richard ill arrived in port
last night twenty-seven days from Comox,
B. C. She was in charge of Captain Con
nor, who has once more proved his title to
the reputation he bears for skill in hand
ling a vessel. The Richard 111, which was
loaded with coal, encountered some heavy
weather en route. One fatality marred
the successful issun of her voyage. On the
11th ult. Alfred Helgersen, a seaman, a
native of Norway, fell overboard and was
drowned. Helgersen was 23 years of age.
The Xanthippe, now out forty-seven days
from San Jose de Guatemala for Puget
Sound, is also long overdue. She was in
ballast and was probably caught in the
same gale as the Richard 111 and Two
Brothers, Fears are also entertained for
her safety.
Captain R. N. Pippy of the trg Governor
Irwin has been removed and t antain Wil
liam PikÂ« put in his place. Pippy has
been twenty years in the employ of the
Harbor Commissioners, and there seems
to be a mystery connected with his remov
al. President Colnon is out of town, Com
missioner Cole is fully occupied with the
Republican State Central Committee and
Colonel Chadbourne knows nothing about
the change. The matter will come up at
the next meeting of the board.
For some time past the Salvation Army
headquarters on Oregon street have been
systematically robbed. The thief could
not be caught, but a man named Jerry
Sullivan was suspected. Yesterday he
was caught leaving the barracks with a
pair of blankets and lie was at once turned
over to the Harbor police. Sullivan has
been fed and clothed by the army for over
ajmonth, so it is likely to go hard with him.
Eusrene Mohns of the well-known house
of Mohns & Kaltenbach was arrested yes
terday on a charge of obtaining money by
false pretences and was booked at the
Harbor police statiop. The linn leases
the building, 27-29-31 Market street and
sublet the portion No. 27 to W. Woolsey
for a bookstore. Since then the building
next door has been pulled down and a new
one is being erected. The sidewaik is con
sequently blocked and Woolsey's occupa
tion is gone. He asserts that Mohns de
ceived him in the matter, hence the ar
rest. Mohns, however, is a map of stand
ing in the community and it is likely to
go hard with Woolsey unless he can sub
stantiate his charges.
The trouble on the Doric has been
amicably adjusted. The white sailors re
ceived an extra month's pay and their
passage money to Liverpool and left the
steamer yesterday. The vessel was then
turned over to the Occidental and Oriental
Company and the Chinese were put in
charge of the h'reroom and forecastle. The
Doric will be moved to tne. Mail dock and
te-morrow will begin loading for Yoko
hama and Hongkong.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Umatilla, which sailed yesterday, took
over fifty miners for the Yukon mines
with her. A couple of men anxious to
reach the gold fields stowed themselves
away, but were discovered before the
steamer reached Fort Point. A boat was
lowered, and they were put in it and set
ashore. She steamer then proceeded on
her way, and the two men had to walk
back to San Francisco.
About eighteen months ago Captain
Gray of the barkentine Retriever fell over
board and was drowned. A few weeks
ago a raftie for his watch and chain and
ci.amis was started, and yesterday the draw
ing came off. Dan Shanahan. stevedore
for Wt J. Adam?, was the lucky man,
and he at once presented the prize to the
dead captain's 18-year-old son. It was a
graceful act on tlie part of Shanahan, and
he now stands "aces high" with all the
shipping men on the front.
The big Hidalgo will be brought over
from Oakland Creek to-morrow to fit out
for a cruise to the Arctic. Captain
Charles Gifford will take the vessel out, as
Captain Len Williams has got tired of
the frozen North, and has gone Into the
Black Diamond paint business.
To Fight Noe Heirs.
The Mission Defense Association was organ
ized at Twentieth and Guerrero streets last
night. Its purpose is to defend the property
owners against the Noe heirs. Fifty members
were enrolled. John H. Grady was elected
president, John Bolger vice-president, F. \V.
Fuller treasurer and E. P. Van Dusen secretary.

Willis Polk's Views on the
Stevenson Monument
Rejection.
SEVERAL NEW DESIGNS
An Effort Will Be Made to Sat
isfy the Supervisors' Ar
tistic Tastes.
MAY BE GIVEN TO BOSTON.
The Fountain Will Be Sent East if It
Is Not Placed in Portsmouth
Square.
"To be honest, to be kindâ to earn a
little and to spend a little lessâ to re
nounce â¢when that shall be necessary
and not be embittered â to help a few
friends, bat these without capitulation
above all, on the same grim condition,
to keep friends with himselfâ here is a
task for all that a man has of fortitude
and delicacy."â The Stevenson quota
tion as it ia to be chiseled on the dead
author's monument.
There is a wide, deep gulf of ill feeling
Some of the desigiis for a monument to be erected at Portsmouth Square in Honor of Robert Louis Stevenson, unless the Supervisors object.
[Sketched for the "CaU" by Willis Polk.]
between the San Francisco Board of Su
pervisors, on the one side, and Willis
Polk. Bruce Porter and Douglas Tilden.on
the other.
Tha artists say that the Supervisors
don't know anything about art; the Su
pervisors say the same thing about the
artists.
Mr. Polk and his associates want >
erect a monument in Portsmouth squi *
in honor of Robert Louis Stevenson, but
the Supervisors have refused to grant per
mission. The design for the monument
â was submitted to the official board, and
the official board declared that it looked
." : like a plan for a tombstone.
"Let the tombstone stand on the grave
of art in San Francisco!" moans Willis
Poik
' ''But it shall not stand in Portsmouth
square," responds the Supervisors.
Bruce Porter and Mr. Polk inaugurated
the movement for a Stevenson monument.
Others went into tne- project with enthus
iasm end' subscriptions for the money
needed have been obtained in San Fran
cis<*Â», the East and elsewhereâ though
principally in. the East and elsewhere.
Much attention has been given to the
movement in the Eastern States and Eng
land, the London Telecrapb urging in a
half-column editorial that contributions
should be sent from London to San Fran-
Inere has been no proposition to erect a
.son monument anywhere else in
.ntry, and the only other one pro
jected is to be at Samoa.
The monument offered to San Fran
c;;co is to be about twenty feet high
and the probable cost is estimated at
AU-.it twenty designs Lave been
spared, and the work of the artiste has
. done without charge.
Wtoen .1 plan was decided upon the de-
Bign was submitted to the Supervisors and
rejected. Consequently the projectors
are indignant, and they say that if the de
sired site in Portsmouth square cannot be
.obtained the monument wil: be given to
Boston, from which city most of the con
tributions have come.
"The Supervisors rejecting the design
because it was not artistic! Just think of
it: ' said Willis Polk yesterday. "Weii. it
Â»aa only a preliminary design, anyway.
and was given to the Supervisors on ac
count of a misunderstanding, so the offi
cial objection falls to the ground.
'We will submit a finished design, how
ever, anil ask to have it submitted to a
jury of Â£i r tist?, if the art feature is to de
termine the matter. Bnt I am told that
there is politics behind the whole matter,
and that- the Supervisors will object to any
monument or fountain being placed in
Portsmouth s.-juare. We hope to learn
more about that.
"1 am in correspondence with Bertram
Grosvenor Goodhue, an eminent Boston
architect, who is an old* chum of mine,
and who v;as my fellow-student ten years
ago. He will contribute his ideas, and
there are several of us here who are study
ing cut the monument plans. We have
about twenty design* now. If the Super
visors had accep.ert the rough design that
was submitted to them from Mr. Porter's
drawing, changes would have been made,
anyway, as we were not at all satisfied
with it.
'In that design the plain marble shaft
represents the quiet, simple lite of Steven
son and the ship represents his love of
stories of adventure and the sea."
Douglas Tiiden has suggested two col
umns, with jÂ»n Italian area of wrought
iron on top, the whole forming a well.
The proposed height of the columns is
about twelve feet.
So much interest has been shown by
Boston people in regard to the memorial
tbat Mr. Polk wants to send the monu
ment to the Eastern city if it cannot be
placed in the desired location. Ports
mouth Square is chosen as the sue be
cause Stevenson li7ed for a time in tnat
locality, at 7 Montgomery avenue, and be
cause h* studied some of his characters
there.
Bruce Porter declares that the San Fran
cisco news usually sent to the outside
world is of a sensational character and
that this is the first time that the name of
the City has appeared in the Eastern and^
English paper? as identified with an art
work of this kind. His arguments are pre
sented in the following paper read before
the Century Club:
The idea for a memorial monument to Robert
Louis stevenson grew out of a genuine enthu
siasm for the man ar.<J the artist, and its justi-
Lcation lies in tna fact of his association with
n. That association was brief but in
â¢ : he acknowledged and recorded our
â  =o>ieness and the dramatic interest of
our cosmopolitan life for the painter and the
and to distinguish us so has marked
â¢ - :;-,ewhatai>art from the common-
I is world.
He made, in failing health and at great risk,
the long journey here, that he might gain the
comradeship that brought him new strength
and courage for the remainder of his life.
He !:a.- given us a share in his life and works,
and this fountain is to record that; it is in no
wise an effort to establish a local claim on his
fame.
It will be the first of the memorials erected to
him. It has^een widely noticed and approved
in the Eastern and British press, and, I cannot
doubt, contributes something to our reputa
tion as a Cityâ something more permanent and
of greater value than ocr running record of
crime and sensationalism is able to contribute.
I would urge your interest in the memorial
on this account, and because an enthusiasm
for a scheme that gives no direct returnâ nÂ«
cash profit â is really what we need more than
all else besides in San Francisco. It i 3 that sort
of enthusiasm that begets a pure patriotism.
||It has been asked why Stevenson (soexclu
s-ively the artist, so distinguished in an art for
which the public has little care) should be
chosen as the one to be remembered so popu
lariy. You remember Mark Twain's project
for a momument to Adam. He urged It, I
think, with the plea that Adam stood for
humanityâ the old Adam in us all. I would
make the plea that Stevenson (more than any
man practicing an art for the delight of it)
stands for the humanities. Aud for this reason
(and because he w&Â« a prince in Bohtmift) the
iiuiniain is to go where ihe cup of water is
most wanted. Xos in the park, where people
go comfortably for their pieasare â it is to be
placed in the heart of the town, where life is
in its reaiity and where most men have the
ty.?t<T in mouth and neart, that needs a re
minder of man's generosity to eradicate.
This memorial that we are : going to set up,
can add nothing to his chances fur immortal
ity. To estimate Mich â¢ chances for a man bo
dear to us is fond folly. : â .â '
i believe, though, that he will be everlast
ingly . putting , fresh heart into . some lonely
youth ; that he will forever be stirring ia the
hearts of men the out-of-doors sensations and
desires, even though his name be remembered
by a few. . .
If this fountain â â¢âºin keep us for a little time
in mind of a character so inspiring, of an art

SAVED BY SKILL.
Bemarkable Cure of an Apparently
Hopeless Case by I>r. Morse at
the German Hospital.
The rescue of a human being from the
clutches of death is one of taose noble acts
which call forth praise from the most j
stoical of men. Even the fire laddies, J
enured as they are to peril and hardship, \
know how to appreciate the care and skill \
which can save a fellow-man from falling
a victim to the grim destroyer. On the
18th of last November Michael Sheehan, a
fireman, received what were thought to be j
fatal injnries at a fire on Market street,
near Sixteenth. He had fallen upon a ;
post which penetrated through his back to
a depth of live inches. Ihe wound was a
frightful one, and it was believed that the
man's spine was broken, or at all events
so severely injured that death must soon :
terminate his excruciating torments.
At 4 o'clock in the morning, soon after
the accident, Sheehan was taken to tne
German Hospital and placed in the hands \
of Dr. Morse, who, it was hoped, might
mitigate In some decree the suffering? of ;
the poor fellow's last hours. The doctor :
makes no pretensions to miraculous
powers, but at the same time his treat- i
meat of Sheehan's frightful injuries

and delighted the young man's host of
friends. In a few days Sheehan, who is a 1

POULTRYMEN'S UNION.
Lack of Business Cause* It to Succumb
to the Demands of Creditors.
The Poultrymen's Union, an incor
porated concern doing business on Front
street, near California, has been compelled
by the stress of numerous creditors to
close its doors. The corporation, composed
mainly of Alameda poultrymen, com
menced business August 2, 1893, since
which time it nas been doing a commis
sion Business on a small scale. Two days
ago the doors of the establishment were
closed, and yesterday a meeting of the
crediiors was held to discuss the terms of
a prospective settlement.
Charged AVitti Manslaughter.
James Hewith, the engineer in charge of the

JUDGE MORROWS TALK
Six Years in the National Capital
as a California Repre
sentative.
THE EFFICIENCY OF CONGRESS.
Firm Faith in Legislative Management
Under the American Form
of Government.
Judge W. "W. Morrow of the United
State 9 District- Court lectured before the
Mecnanica' Institute last evening at the li
brary building on Post street. His subject
was. "Six Years With Statesmen," the
lecture including reminiscences of Judge
Morrow's experience as a Congressman
from this State. Many splendid stereopti
con illustrations of the National capital
were presented; the pictures of all tne
great public buildings and of some of the
great celebrities who were in the House
and Senate while Congressman Morrow
was at Washington.
The lecture was highly instructive and
entertaining. Judge Morrow was to have
discussed more at length on the efficiency
of Congress as a legislative body, but it
was necessary to follow the story of the
views presented, and there was not suffi
cient time to more than touch upon the
question that has caused so much debate.
People in the audience expressed the
hope that the lecturer would be urged to
deliver another lecture and speak only on
the theoretical question of the efficiency
of the various legislative bodies in the
great nations of the worid.
The lecture hall at the Institute build
ing was thronged last night and the seat.
ing capacity was not large enough for the
audience.
Tn- history of the location of the Ameri
can capital was told, the circumstance be
ing pointed out that Washington is one of
the few preat capitals that are not also
trade centers. The only commerce that
Washington has is in bringing ice up tne
river to cool the Senators' lemonade in
summer-
Washington is governed entirely by Con
gress. it~has no local governing bodies,
and the people don't vote. But there is
no better municipal government, and taiea
there are very low.
Judge Morrow spoke jf the criticisms of
Congress, many writers having declared
that the Government cannot have efficient
legislation. It is held thaieach branch of
the Government being a check to the
other the system cannot long exist.
Comparing this Government with that
of England, Judire Morrow said that the
English Government may be able to
chance front quicker, but here the power
is better distributed among the people.
There are times when the Government
ou^ht to be able to act promptly. It took
five years to get the act passed relating to
car-couplinsrs, the measure having been
indorsed by the people, recommended by
the President and not opposed by the rail
road. The act adopted in 1893 will not go
into effect until 1898, making a delay of
ten years.
Buc, said the speaker, there are classes
of legislation that can be acted on very
quickly. Anything that is regarded as
necessary to "maintain the diirnity of the
nation meets with no delay. The measure
relating to the freedom oi Cuba is an
illustration.
"I think, altogether," said Judge Mor
row, "that our form of government is as
efficient and thorough as any other form,
and I would be glad to defend my belief
at greater length than time will here
permit."
The lecture was concluded with a tribute
to the honesty, ability and patriotism of
the great majority of the Congressmen
and a glowing picture of what may be ex
pected from the remarkable development
that ii now going on.
The Thistle Club Smoker.
Last Thursday evening the members of the
San Francisco Scottish Thistle Club held their
regular monthly meeting at their rooms, 32
O'Farrell street, at the conclusion of which the
regularly monthly 6motcr was inaugurated
and continued until long past midnight. The
affair was managed by the literary committee,
consisting of Georeo Â»'. Peterson (chairman),
George Watson, William Bushby. J. Gillise and

Brown, James Xiven, Mr. Fintfley, George Wat
son, William Fairgrieve, J. D. Coulie, William
Bushby, G. W. Paterson. Mr. Simpson, P. Keith

Niven. There were eight volumes in all

and 2), â¢â¢Lays of the Heather." "Song* of the

SACRAMENTO SPORTING.
Practicing: for Trap Shooting Contest*.
Capital City Wheelmen Road Race.
According to the following le ter which
was received yesterday from Sacra
mento the sportsmen of that city are not
behind in the way of enjoyment. It is to
be regretted, however, that the English
snipe is still being killed by some Ken
who ao not favor game protection. The
letter reads:
Sacrame.vto. Cal., Feb. 27, 1896.
The end of the open season has by no means
dampened the ardor of the deciples of sport in
this vicinity and many are still going aheld in
search of the erratic flying snipe, the robin
and the wild goose. Snipe-shooting baa been
especially good in this locality during the past
month and a number of iarge bags have been
made by local shots. Wild geese are making
their appearance in the vicinity of Swingle's
station in vast numbers and daily excursions
are in order for a tramp through the tule
basin after this wary bird. It is stated that
Dr. E. C. Deuel made a trip to the vicinity of
Union House Tuesday and made a bag of
twenty-eight snipe in two hours' shooting.
The opening shoot of the Sacramento Blue
Rock Club was held last week at the Kimble
& Cpsori grounds. Ed Nicholas carried off the
honors with a score of 22, and demonstrated
by his clever work that he intends to make
the cracks hustle during the coming season.
The club intends to practice hard for the
coming tournament, which will be held at j
Stockton under thy auspices of the Inanimate
Target Association, this being the club in Sac- i
ramento at the present time which is con
nected with the association. The old Spoonbill
Club will, nowever, shortly hold an election of
officers and make application for admission to
the association.
The Capital City Wheelmen will have a
fifteen-mile road race, to take place on the Bth
of the coming month. This will be for mem
bers only. The boys are training hard at Agri
cultural Park track in hopes of a record.
The rage for bicycling is on the increase in
this city and dealers report tneir saies as even
greater then up to the saaae time in 1595; in
ract, they at times find it difficult to supply the
demand. Stewart Upson of the firm of Kimble
Â«fcl"pson.who has just returned from a busi
ness trip through the adjoining counties, states
that the demand ior sporting goods is on the
increase and that In his opinion more interest
will be taken in sporting circles this year
than ever before known on the coast. W. S.
Howe and M. >'. Winans went a half-mile racÂ«
on their wheel yesterday for a wine supper,
Howe winning by 100 yard*. Last Sunday in
the wilds of Yolo County there was a congre
gation of gentlemen ehiekeri fanciers who met:
to witness a f-ijv bouts between birds of their
choice. The contests were sharp and spirited- .

A Unique Method, of Making Guests .
: - AmuÂ«e Themselves. :â¢ '..- :
The most enjoyable outgrowth of the",
poster fad is the poster party. In issuing â 
the invitations the hostess requests each,
woman to come in the costume of the
figure on the poster of a certain newspaper .-.
or magazine that she names, being careful y'C
to have no two alike. The men she re-
quests to represent well-known newspaper .
men.
The women's costumes can be made of
as rich or as ordinary material as one may
wish, although the least expensive and at â <
the same time . most effective and artistic ;â¢};
ones are made of cheesecloth, which hangs
in graceful folds and makes the Grecian and : . ;
Egyptian figures easy to copy. ' During a
recent poster party each woman in turn
was called on to pose in correct representa-
tion of the poster figure she portrayed, ;
-and guesses were made and written upon
cards as to what newspaper or magazine -
she represented. 7 ; ;
The men were called upon to quote say-
ings of the men they represented, or to ..
name the principles advocated by the pub- ; : ;
lications whose representatives they were
made up to resemble. . Guesses were made :
then as in the cases of the women, and
prizes were awarded. ' The prizes are
usually subscriptions to magazines or
newspapers. .Of course the hostess took no
part in the guessine, but was in the con- ":
fidence of all who took part.
At each place at the ; supper table of a
poster party is placed a favor. For the
women the favors were huge bunches of :
violets, tied with ribbons to match the ;
costumes, v On the ribbons are painted im-
portant parts of the headings oft e title :
pages of newspapers or magazines. The
men get Jarge white chrysanthemums, to
which - are attached broad satin ribbuns
illustrated similarly. ' . 1
â¢ , Instead of the usual miscellaneous con-
versation and exchange r of v threadbare V
platitudes at the table, each takes his turn .
at relating something amusing from the \
last edition of the magazine or the latest
issue of the Sunday newspapers he stands -
for. ::;:â -':â ; â  : -^:.^ Â...,..,_. .^

cess of ) the evening at the party already =
mentioned : was , of bright red" cheese- / :

bands of , black velvet ribbon. The Egyp- â â -'
tian headdress was of yellow and red satin, ...
with one large rhinestone rosette on each
side 'in "'â  front. When called upon to pose
the young woman stood against a dark ;
blue portiere, and in her hands held a ;â¢
huge polished brass globe. One wit re- '
marked: <

Sun, and know it's so." "
In view of the number of posters dis-
played this year- by the press, there need
be no dearth of new and artistic models ;

FANCY DOGS POISONED
Much Malicious Work Now Be
ing Carried Out in West
Oakland.
MRS. ADAMS TO STAND TRIAL.
Her Young Husband Secures First
Blood in the Suit to Annul His
Marriage.
Oakland Orrn c San Francisco Call,)
90s Broad wav, Feb. 20. \
The residents of West Oakland are
worked up over the work of some mis
creants who hsve been going about uuder
cover of darkness poisoning their pet
animals. At tirst it was not thought the
animals were intentionally poisoned, but
as one after another in the same vicinity
began to have their pets removed it be
came evident that there was an object in
view.
Puring the last few days the culprits
have become bolder than ever, and, in
spite of the vigilance of the officers, pro
ceeded with their miserable work. So far
no clew has been found of the perpetrators,
but should they be caught in the act there
is little doubt but what they wouLd receive
rather rough handling by angry residents.
The purpose of the gang in the whole-
Blaoghteroi these faithful protectors
of the homes of their owners is being
manifested. Mrs. Joseph O'Dontiell of
1-'J2 Cypress street, whose dog was among
the first to be killed, had her chicken
:.ous> robbed of several line pullets last
night Frederick Grotheer of 1328 Kirk
hani street reported to the officers that a
few nights alter his dog had been poisoned
he found a man in nis back yard and two
others standing outside. They made their
escape before he could raise an alarm and
capture them.
From these instances it is feared that
the gang is ODening the way for a series of
burglaries. Among the sufferers besides
those mentioned above are the following:
â Robert Walsh, a valuable thoroughbred
pointer: Joseph Court, a tine Scotch ter
rier; Abram F. Gouid. a pet thoroughbred
ehepherd; William ' Spieth, a tine large
buildoir; Mrs. Hunnings, a pet skye-ter
rier; Mrs. Harris Owens, a young New
foundland pup; J.Moldetti, a fine bulldog
pup; A. Bartulda, a shepherd dog.

of itself wa3 sufficient to be a cause, the
peculiar condition of the young and weak
ened mind together would be enough to
warrant a hearing. He said, however,
that he believed there were portions of the
complaint which should be struck out, and
at the request of the attorneys he would
near more on that point on Tuesday.

More Victims Found.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 29. â Since the
gold-brick swindlers have been secured a
number of their efforts to catch the un
wary have been brought to light. Captain
Wilson returned from San Jose with the
two '"gold bricks"' for which L. A. Hofstra
of that city paid $4000. While there he
learned that one Bernheim, a grocer, es
caped by the refusal of the bank to let. him
a raw so much money without notice. At
the time he was very wrathy, but now is
congratulating himself.
Chief Floyd has received information
that there is a Stockton man who was
buncoed out of about $18,000 on the gold*;
brick swindle, and he is trying to locate
him, so as to get another charge against
the operators, if possible. The man is so
chagrined, it is said, over the fact that he
â \v-as such an easy victim that he does not |
Want to let himself be known. :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAUCH 1, 1898.
COMING CLOSE TOGETHER
Signs That the Water Company
War Is Nearing the
End.
NO MORE CUTTING OF RATES.
The New Company's Attorney Drops
a Significant Hint Before the
Council.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
MS Broadway, Feb. 29. f
It is regarded as a certainty that the war
between the two water companies in this
city is upproachmg the end. Last night J.
W. T. Watkinson, representing the Contra
Costa Company, and ex-Mayor W. R.
Davi3 strolled into the cummitteÂ°-room of
the Council together to argue against a re
duction on the rate for hyd rants. It was
the first time that there has been the
slightest indication of any feeling in com
mon between the two powerful corpora
tions, and the large lobby regarded it as
very significant. For over a year either
company has eagerly cut the other's rate
until water has been supplied for nearly
nothing.
Another fact that is considered as show
ing a tendency toward coalition is the re
moval of the bogie man from the office of
the Contra Costa Company. The "bogie
man" was considered the master stratagem
of the recent war. It was a roan who sat
ail day in the Contra Costa oitice and so
licited all the custom for the Dingee con
cern. It was a bold stroke, and the Contra
Costa people naturally objected to his pres
ence. The man then showed proof that
he owned one share in the company, and
was, therefore, entitled to inspect the
books and promenade in the office. His
i right was not disputed, and for many weeks
he s.it on a chair in a corner of the office,
and when customers paid their bills they
would be asked to take ihe water of the
rival concern.
The stockholder who was so manifestly
disloyal to his new interest? has gone, And
there is no longer any solicitor for the
Dingee Company in the office of its rival.
At last night's meeting Mr. Davis
sounded what appears to be the keynote of
a new order of things. He said: "There
is no immediate danger of the consolida
tion of these two companies, but where
competition is unprofitable the natural
thing for capital to do is to combine.
Now, the city don't want to do anything
that will force such a result. It would not
be wise."
The price of water charged by the
Contra Costa Company is now just about
one-third of what it was before the present
Council fixed the rates, and the competi
tion in the new company caused a still
further reduction. If the sworn statements
of the water company in years past are
true, then the big rate it received three
j years ago was justly due it to insure a
! reasonable dividend, and at the present
! time it must be losing heavily. If this be
the case, then the time referred to by Mr,
Davis last oight nas already come, and
"the natural thing for capital to do is to
combine."
Next Monday night the committee will
! recommend to the Council a reduction in
the rate allowed hydrants, and there will
be a lively time in t;.e Council chamber.
HAYS AND HIS AX.
Blind Employes Removed From the
Industrial Home.
OAKLAND, Cal., Teb. 29.â Superintend-
ent Hays of the Home for the Adult
Blind has removed the blind teacher of the
broom-making department, Daniel Weider,
arvi his blind assistant, W. A. Ploughman.
These men were simply told their services
were not wanted at the home any longer.
They were among the oldest inmates of
the place, as well as two of thejmost intelli
gent. They were promoted to the posi
tions they occupied by the board recently
removed because of their particular fitness
and as a reward for the interest they mani
fested in the welfare of the home and in
the discharge of their duties. Tney were
not only discharged from their office, But
Jrom the home.
The third man removed is Mr. Dice, who
uas been the superintendent's secretary.
He was one of the few remaining old-time
employes, and about the only person fa
miliar with the intricacies of "the home
system of accounts. Yesterday he was no
tified that his services would not be re
quired after to-night, but at the same time
he was requested to spend a week instruct
ing his successor in thedutiesof the office.
Mr. Dice has lived in the main building
and had a piano and other furniture there,
and Hays could not but allow him some
days' time to remove, and so made rip ob
jection, ihe successor to Secretary Dice
is a Mr. Flood.
The officers or employes removed were
appointed not by the superintendent but
by the board.
A meeting of the board has been called
for Tuesday evening at S o'clock.
STUDENTS CROWN LABOR
Berkeley Boys Celebrate Their
Introduction to Manual
Work.
One More Day Will Be Given Them
in Which to Finish Their
Taskâ News Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 29.â The stu
dents at the State University will have
one mare day in which to complete their
work of improving the campus. This an
nouncement was made to-night by Presi
dent Kellogg at the wish and request of
.the students themselves. Isext Monday
will be set aside a3 the time for the com
pletion of the work.
This evening the university campus pos
sesses the appearance of having under
gone an almost instantaneous and com
plete transformation, so much hÂ»ve the 500
student laborers done within the past two
and a half days toward building new
walks, leveling rugged hillocks, fill
ing gaping holes and laying out the
grounds in the vicinity of North Hall ac
cording to the principles of civil engineer
ing and good taste.
â¢ What was a portion of the agricultural
garden a few days ago is how an imposing
sixteen-foot walk, which leads the visitor
or the college student directly from the
local train to a place near the football
grounds, where it joins the old footpath
that has been for so long a time the only
well built approach to the main building
from the western section of the reserva
tion. This new walk, over the securing of
the right of way of which there was so
much trouble, is not yet wholly com
pleted, however, being in need of several
more loads of rock and gravel in the region
of the historic Lovers' lane and beneath
the sturdy live oaks. Farther up toward
the buildings on the southern side of the
broad approach the bank, which was form
erly . two or three feet in perpendicular
height for 100 yards or more, has been
given a gentle* slope by the picks and
shovels of the collegians.
The largest and perhaps tbe most diffi
cult piece of work undertaken is that
of leveling the earth immediately sur
rounding North Hall. The basement
of the building was about three feet below
the level of the ground the entire distance
around it, but the earth has been ex
cavated on the north, west and south
sides so that the lower floor is now only
about one foot below the surface. This
piece of work is the farthest from com
plete of any undertaken, and it is to finish
this that the boys wish another day from
their recitations.
The ground was found to be exceedingly
hard all the way down, and in some places
solidification was so nearly complete that
only a pick and the muscle of a brawny
athlete could move it from Us
granite bed. The unexpected hardness of
this section has done more to prevent the
entire completion of the work by to-night
than anything else.
Not quite as many turned out to-day for
work as was the case on the two previous
days, on account of its being Saturday,
but those who were on hand worked with
zeal and energy. There was less of the
romping and rollicking spirit of the colle
trian's displayed to-day than heretofore, but
still there was enough to add^ life to the
work and make it pass off easily. Mason,
the Berkeley candy man, drove up this
afternoon with thirty- -.'Jlona of lemonade
for the boys, and within three minutes
there was a string of 303 men waiting for
their turn at the tank. Fantastic costumes
and unheard-of-before makeups were as
much in evidence to-day as at any time
previous, but some of them bore marks of
violence administered by playful youths
rather than holes worn through incessant
toil.
A rousing celebration over the achieve
ments of the lasr three days was held to
night. The Presidio band was engaged for
the occasion and discoursed music from the
portico pt tbe library building, which was
brilliantly illuminated.
Town Trustees.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 29.â A special
meeting of the Town Trustees was held
last night for the purpose of finally pass
ing the ordinance fixing water rates for
the town from July 1- The ordinance
was passed without amendment.
Warrants were ordered drawn on tbe
town treasury for the salary list for Feb
ruary, amounting to $894 36. J. "W. Rich
ards, president of the board, refused to
accept his salary, expressing the opinion
that the president should serve without
recompense, as do the other members
of the board. Mr. Richards' sal
ary baa been ?00 per month. His
stand was opposed by other members of
the board, who declared that tbe extra
amount of time which the president must
devote to town interests made it right that
he should receive a salary. A warrant for
$50 was therefore drawn in favor of Mr.
Richards,
Trustee Martin was granted sixty days'
leave of absence. He will make a business
trip to the East.
Professor William Carey Jones an
nounced the death of Reuben Rickarfl,
former president of the board, and the
Trustees adjourned out of respect to the
memory of the deceased. Trustees Jones,
Gage and Hoff were appointed a commit
tee to prepare resolutions of esteem for
the ex-president.
'Woman Suffrage Campaign.
BERKELEY, Cal, Feb. 20. -The Citi
zens' Suffrage League of Berkeley is mak
ing active preparations for the opening of
the coming political campaign in favor
of woman suffrage.
Rev". Anna H. Shaw is expected to speak
in Berkeley under the auspices of the
league on March 10. It will probably be
her tirst appearance in California during
the 18:*> campaign. The ladies of the local
league are endeavoring to complete ar
rangements, to make admission to the lec
ture free to all. Efforts are being made
to raise by subscription a sufficient sum
of money to pay the expenses of the even
ing. Half of the required sum has already
been pledged. The matter is in the hands
of Mrs. George. Haight, president of the
Citizen Suffrage League, and Mrs. William
Keith, the secretary.
Change of Factors.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 29.â Tt is an
nounced that Rev. J. D. Foster, who for
some years has been Congregational min
ister in charge of the work at Lorin, will
leave that Held about April 1. His suc
cessor to the pastorship has not yet been
selected, but it is generally understood
that the committee in charge will offer it
to Rev. Mr. Sargent of Santa Rosa. Mr.
Sargent has preached a number of times
for the church, and seems to be at present
the only candidate in the field for the po
sition of regular pastor.

Strange Accidents to Birds.
An Irish naturalist once observed a
dumlin acting in a very curious maoiner
on the seashore. The bird would anght,
then fly a short distance and then alight
again, violently shaking its head. A
round lump appeared fastened to its beak.
It turned out that the bird had innocently
attempted to investigate a cockle which it
had found open. The shell had closed on
its bill.
A poor little chaffin was found dead
near Epsom with its lower mandible so
firmly imbedded in the shell of a beech
nut that it had been unable to extricate it
and had died of starvation.
A hen pheasant was observed by a
sportsman to be flying around and around
in a wild manner. On being shot it was
discovered to have a large oak leaf im
paled upon its beak in such a way as to
totally obscure its vision.
Herons sometimes choke themselves by
attempting to swallow large trout. An
eider-duck has been killed by attempting
to swallow a toad. A kingfisher was once
found which could not fly on account of
having a young pike stuck in its throat.
Some hunters removed the fish, and the
bird flew away unhurt.
Birds that employ hair in the building
of their nests come to grief in strange
ways. A gentleman who possessed several
colts one day noticed a small bird en
tangled in the tail of one of the colts. It
had evidently been on a search for hair,
and had become ensnared. Cases of birds
getting their feet tangled in wool or string
are well known, and death usually ensues
if human help is not forthcoming.
In the spring of the year the dead leaves
of pampas grass dry, fall â  to the ground
and curl up like shavings from a carpen
ter's bench. A correspondent of an Eng
lish paper mentions finding a robin which
had accidentally gotten one of these pieces
curled so tightly around its neck that it
could not feed, and so starved to death.
In Great Britain the yearly loss of
wages through ill heath is about eleven
millions sterling, and it is estimated that
40 per c* nt of those who start in business
fail. March is considered the slackest
mouth for business.
DINNER BEFORE TALKING
A Good Plan That Is Building
Up the Ministerial
Association.
PASTORS ENJOY THE FEAST.
After It, They Take More Pleasure
in Reading Papers and
Criticizing.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,Â£
908 Broadway, Feb. 29. )
The Oakland Ministerial Association has
taken on a new lease of life. It has been
discovered that the prospect of eating to
gether has the effect of bringing out more
members, and so the experiment Las now
been made the rule.
This evening the usual dinner was en
joyed at the Galindo Hotel, and after the
repast the usual papers were read. It is
worthy of note that the prohibition prin
ciples of the president, Dr. R. F. Coyle,
are rigidly respected at the ministerial
feasts.
The association had a feeble existence
for many years. Sometimes the meetings
would be largely attended, and at other
time 3 there would be so few that the next
meeting would be sÂ«Â»t several months
ahead. For about a year past strong efforts
have teen put forth to reinvigorate the
association, and with marked success.
Dr. CoyJe was elected president and the
meetings were held in the First Presby
terian Church. Two or three months ago
it was decided to take a new departure.
One of the mem be rs suggested that eat
ing was a great aid to thinking ana quoted
the lact that the Guild of Arts and Crafts
had decided that a good dinner was the
best basis for an intellectual discussion.
The ministers decided to adopt the dinner
plan, and the last three monthly meetings
have been well attended. At present the
Galindo Hotel is the meeting place.
Clergymen attending pay for their own
dinner. The secretary, Rev. Philip Graif,
notified all of the approaching feast, and
that fur a very moderade charge a good
course dinner will be served.
At the conclusion- of the repast the min
isters adjourn to another room, where
the opener of the evening reads a paper
and the rest take turns in criticism. The
plan works well and the prospects of long
life and prosperity for the Ministerial As
sociation are now excellent. The scope of
the organization is wide enough to admit
of all Protestant clergymen. Nearly all
the ministers of this city are members of
the various San Francisco ministerial asso
ciations, and this in some measure ex
plaina the difficulty against which the
local body has had to contend.
Rev. D. Ellis read a paper this evening
on "The Clerical Statesman." It provoked
an interesting discussion, and gome of the
speaker's views were broadly criticized.

BRIDEGROOM BRETZ BACK
The Benedict Returns From His
Lonely Wedding Trip to
Stockton.
A RECONCILIATION EFFECTED.
Father-in-Law Itsell Witt Give Them
His Blessing and Install Them
in His Home.
The mild sensation which followed the
hasty double wedding of the Itsell sisters
and the subsequent trip to Stockton and
vicinity of Bridegroom Bretz is subsiding.
Yesterday morning Mr. Bretz returned to
this City to meet his tearful bride axjd her
irate papa. A reconciliation was effected,
and the young couple will hereafter live
together under the roof of the bride's pa
rents.
Mr. Bretz during yesterday kept him
self in strict seclusion, so far as the press
was concerned, but during the afternoon a
council of the young people was held to
â¢which a Call reporter was admitted.
Bridegroom Peterson and his bride, Mrs.
Bretz and a lady friend constituted the
council, which, far from being^'as merry
aÂ« a marriage bell.' threatened at times to
become as solemn as a funeral.
"I cannot see why the public takes such
an interest in ivy marriage," remarked
Mrs. Bretz with some petulance. Other
people marry and are happy and grow fat,
while I am setting to be a veritable
shadow. I have known where Mr. Bretz
â¢was all the time ana knew beforehand that
he was going. Iv fact, we all expected to
keep the marriage secret for some time
yet, and even Judge Groezinger swore by
his risht hand to say nothing about it.
But it's all his fault that it got out. It'a a
pretty set of men we have now on the
bench in San Francisco."
.Mrs. Bretz did appear a trifle weary,
though still a very substantial "shadow,"
and her features bore testimony that this
time the course of true love has not run
6mooth.
Other members of the council explained
that Mr. Itsell's displeasure at tbe mar
riage of his younger daughter was based
upon his conviction that she was still too
young to wed, and did not include any
personal objection to young Bretz. Since
the wedding, however, lie had become
reconciled to the match, and the young
people would be <;iven a home together be
neath his roof.
Mr. Peterson stated that he had seen
Mr. Bretz yesterday morning, and that he
was still in this City, but that he would
not submit to be interviewed.
NOT AT HOME.
When Seen Last Night the Missing
Clerk's Father Said He Thought
His Bey Would Not Return.
Oakiaxd Office Pan Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 29. f
Clifford Bretz, the head clerk of the
Street Department, did not return home
to-day, and no one has any reliable infor
mation regarding his whereabout?. It is
now thought that the report of his having
been at Stockton on Thursday was incor
rect. He has not communicated with any
one since he left his bride of a few hours
at the door of her parents' house.
The Board of Works will meet on Mon
NEW TO-DAY.

day, and it will appoint a new clerk to the
Street Department in the place of young
Bretz. The place is wortli $125 a month,
and there is a small army of applicants for
the office.
Mr. Bretz, the father of the missing boy,
says he does not thintc young Bretz has
any desire to return to his position.
'â¢I think Clifford has gone for good,"
said his father to-night. "The affair is
more mysterious than ever, and I am at a
total loss to account for it. It is so unlike
him that I do not think he has any idea of
returning. He was always steady and at
tentive to his work, and he has been upset
and after doing a foolish act he has re-,
pented and gone away.
"His quarrel with the young lady to
whom he was engaged evidently made
him desperate, and probably he did not
realize what he was doing until after he
had married Miss Itsell. Then he cleared
out, and is probably out of the country.
I cannot think he is'anywhere near here,
or some of us would have heard from him.
He evidently does not care anything about
his job, or he would have written to
Superintendent Miller."
Meanwhile wo-rk in the Street Depart
ment is piled up several feet high, and Mr.
Miller has notified the Board of Works
that he must have some immediate help.
A CORRECTION.
The Sate of Mr. and Mr*. Peck's Mar
riage Wrongly Printed in Yes
terday's Issue.
The Call desires to correct a misstate
ment that inadvertently appeared in one
of its column articles yesterday morning
regarding the date of the wedding of Mr.
and Mrs. Eddie Peck of Oakland. They
were married in San Jose September 10,
1894, before a Justice of the Peace, with
the consent of their respective parents,
and their matrimonial venture has turned
out a happy one.
SAN FRANCISCO HONORED.
, Faderewski Flare* a Local Composition
tn His Repertoire.
Professor G. Sauvlet, the local pian
â  ist and composer, has recently written his
j third "Gavotte de Concert," and dedicated
I it to Paderewski. On the afternoon-of the
19th inst. Sauvlet was entertained by the
great pianist at the Palace Hotel, at which
time he took occasion to play the composi
tion, which was pronounced a work of
merit.
Paderewski at once assured Mr. Sauvlet
that he would add the gavotte to his
repertoire, and would surely have given
the composer the honor of hearing his
work played here in public but for the fact
that his" entire programme was com
pleted.
Mr. Sauvlet is one of Paderewski's i
warmest admirers, and speaks of his great
abilities in words of the highest praise.
Among the celebrities he has heard in
their palmy days are included Listz, Ru
binstein, Hans yon Bulow, Bauer and
Pachmann, but he maintains that none
of these possessed even to a moderate de
gree the gifts of genius found in this later
day marvel.
Plenty of Fun at the Cliff Soon. TUT
Colonel T. P. Robinson, whom Mayor Sutro
has engaged to loolf-after the amusements at
the terminus of the Cliff-house road, has been
deluged with letters recently regarding at
tractions. Although the colonel has not en
tered into any kind of a partnership with the
Mayor and has only been employed by him as
an agent, he enters into his new duties with
all the enthusiasm and acumen which have
always made him successful in the euterprises
he has touched. He is confident that the new
attractions will be ready by the 14th inst.
; A Schooner Libeled.
August Wilson yesterday libeied the Ameri
can schooner Agnes for $27,705 for supplies
furnished. The case will be heard before Judge
Morrow in the United States District Court.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
SHORT OF PROVISIONS.
The Schooner John N. Ingalls
Arrived From San Marcos
Island.
CAPTAIN OTT'S PREDICAMENT.
When He Boarded the Vessel There
Was Nothing Aboard but Flour
and Water,
Captain Thomas of the schooner John N.
Ingalls and Captain "Pete" Ott of the pilot
boat America had an experience a couple
Captain "Pete" Ott of the Pilot-Boat America Boarding the Schooner John N. Ingails off the Farallones.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.}
of days ago that they do not want to re- I
peat. With Captain Wilson it was a ques
tion of days, but with the pilot it was only i
a question of hours. Still the latter did j
not enjoy the experiment. The schooner ;
was out of provisions, and ail that was left j
aboard was some flour and brackish water, j
Flapjacks fried in a pan without grease j
was the staple food, and when Captain Ott :
was informed of the existing state of af- !
fairs, he made a vain attempt to recall the
boat that put him aboard.
For thirty-six hours Captain Ott, the
piiot and Captain Thomas, master of the
schooner, lived on flapjacks cooked without
the assistance of lard, and when the vessel
finally reached an anchorage and "Pete"
was safely ashore, he swore by all the
saints in the calendar that he would never
board another Mexican schooner as long as
he remained a pilot.
The John N. Ingails arrived from San
Marcos Island Jast Thursday after an un
usually long passage of thirty-seven days.
The provisions for the round trip were
taken aboard there, and as Captain Thomas
did not anticipate a long wait nor pro
tracted gales the provisions gave out before
the Golden Gate was sighfed. When off
the Farallones all that was left on board
was a couple of sacks of flour and a few
gallons of brackisn water that had been
taken aboard at San Marcos Island.
When the pilot-boat America sighted the
John N. Ingalls it was almost a calm.
Captain Ott wanted to get ashore, however,
so Captain Frank Murphy, who was in
command, agreed to put him aboard. A
boat was lowered and the anxious master
was put aboard the schooner.
Now, if there is a pilot on the bay of San
Francisco that knows the winds and cur
rents better than "Pete" Ott he had better
get up and declare himself. It was this
knowledge that served the pilot in good
stead. As soon as he learned that there
were only flour and water aboard he began
figuring on the nearest way home. He
worked with that schooner as he never
worked when he was fourth mate on a
China clipper, and he finally caught a
streak of wind that carried the schooner
through the Golden Gate. It was a splen-
I did piece of seamansnip; but, then, the
incentive was. great. Once asnore, Cap
: tains Ott and Thomas partook of the finest
' porterhouse steak in the market.
In speaking about the trip Captain
Tnomas said: "It was a succession of
I winds and calms, and when off the Golden
; Gate the calms seemed worse than ever.
I It was a godsend to sight the America, and
! when Captain Ott came aboard he was
I right welcome. I'm afraid he was disap
pointed with our larder, but then we did
the best we could."
Captain Frank Murptiy, who persuaded
Captain Ott to board the Ingails, is still
chuckling over the matter. He swears
that there was not enough lard aboard in
which to fry flapjacks and that "Pete"
i fasted for thirty -six hours. Captain Ott
says nothing, but looks gloomy when the
John N. Ingails is mentioned.
A racehorse galloping at full speed clears
from twenty to twenty-four feet for every
bound.
FEASTED CITY OFFICIALS
Chinese Desire to Show Their
Appreciation of American
Ways.
BIRDS' NESTS AND CHAMPAGNE.
The Tinn Yee Quong Sow Benevolent
Association Act as Hosts at the
Hang Fer Low Restaurant.
The Tinn Yee Quone Sow Benevolent
Association of the Low Quong Chung Chew
entertained a number of the officials of the
City last night with a banquet of the most
approved Chinese type at the Hang Fer
Low restaurant, 713 Dupont street. Birds'
nests, pickled eggs, rice brandy, Chinese
quail, pear brandy and champagne fol
lowed close one upon another to an ac
companiment of Mongolian music. The
feast consisted of twelve courses, which
were served by a half dozen handsome
young waiters attired in glorious oriental
costumes.
The Tinn Yee Quong Sow Benevolent
Association was organized only a short
time ago. Its object was mutual protec
tion and the gradual enlightenment of its
members as to the ways of the Caucasians.
The banquet of last night was a means
toward that end.
The chief City officials were invited to
I attend, and many were there.
Paderewski, th<i great pianist, had ex
pressed his intention of being present.
During the last week an engagement was
made to play at San Jose. This debarred
j him from participating in the feast, which
was a source of great regret to the Chinese
hosts.
The guests were greeted at the restau
rant by the officers and directors of the
Tinn Yee Quong Sow, pressed in resplen
dent silken robes reaching to their ankles.
Upon their Mongolian great coats rested
immense gold badges w'th ribbons of red,
gold and blue. This bit of modernism was
a striking illustration of the desire of the
Chinese of this society to appear Ameri
canized.
The menu was most carefully served.
During the dinner skilled musicians per
formed and attendants passed about the
table continually replenishing the cups
with rice brandy or pear wine.
For the first course came birdsnest soup.
This was followed with pickled eggs in
slices, with ginger root. Mushrooms with
Chinese asparagus made the next course.
After a course of chicken livers with
sugared vinegar sauce came more birds
nest, with chicken and mushrooms. Pre
served lemons and plums were next
served, and then came some sharks' fins
with cnicken. After a service of preserved
chestnuts had been made roast Chinese
quail were brought on the table. After
these came chicken and ham brochette,
duck and seed sprout saute, chin mi soup,
French mushrooms served with coop
sticks, fish brain soup, rice, chicken, fish
and egg and sweetmeats and fruits. With
this came an accompaniment of rice
brandy, pear wine, claret and champagne.
With the champagne came many inter
esting speeches. Chew Haw, the president
of the organization, a tall, benevolent
looking man, with a face like De Wolf
Hopper's, welcomed the guests in choicest
Chinese, and then shook hands all around,
his remarks were interpreted by Tim Cox,
the secretary of the order, who, in a few
well-chosen remarics, thanked the visitors
for their interest.
J. Taylor Rogers, Mayor Sutro's secre
tary, said the banquet and the sentiments
revealed by it were a revelation to him.
"We have always considered the Chinese
exclusive and not desirous of adopting our
ways," he said. "Our experience of to
night shows that they are anxious to be
come better acquainted. The Chinese are
decreasing numerically, and many of those
who remain seem anxious to get more in
touch with American ideas and American
progress. In that light the banquet of
to-night, it seems to me, is probably pro
phetic of new features in the social and
political lifeof the Chinese."
Supervisor Hughes addressed the Chi
nese as his constituents, explaining that
he was in his own district. He taanked
them for their courtesy, and declared
they had given him less trouble than the
inhabitants of any other part of his dis
trict, and never demanded repairs in the
sewers and streets.
"I did not poll many votes in this pre
cinct," he added, when M. M. Foote, the
attorney tor the Low Quong Chung Chew,
interrupted with:
"But you will next election, Supervisor,
for our society alone polls over 600 votes."
Speeches followed by M. M. Foote,
Judge Seawell .Justice Barry, Justice Groe
zinger, Oscar Rouleau and others. Then
the full Chinese band, with its gongs and
cymbals, was introduced, and a musical
feast was served up with the cigars.
Among the Caucasians present were:
Judge J. M. Seawell, Judge G. C. Groe
zmger. Supervisors Dunker, Hughes, Wag
ner, Benjamin and Morgenstern, Prose
cuting Attorney William M. Madden, J.
Taylor Rogers (for Mayor Sutro), Prose

YOUNG HOBART TO WED
His Engagement to Miss Wil
liams of San Rafael Is
Announced.
The Bride Elect Is One of This Sea
son's Debutantes and a Popu
lar Belle.
The engagement of Walter Scott Hobart
and Miss Hannah Williams was an
nounced on Friday evening at a dinner
given in honor of the happy young couple I
at the Hobart residence on A T an Ness ;
avenue.
For some time past gossip has linked the
names of the young couple, but so care
fully was their secret guarded that the an
nouncement was a complete surprise to
the company assembled to do them honor. !
Walter Hobart is so well known in this I
City that the engagement is sure to cre
ate a widespread interest. He is the I
possessor of a large fortune inherited from
his father and spends the greater part of ;
his time in the management of the im- j
mense estate left him.
He is extremely popular in social circles |
and enjoys the reputation of being one of i
the foremost horsemen in this country.
Miss Williams is the daughter of Major j
Williams of San Rafael and a niece of j
Brigadier-General Forsyth, who is in com- |
mand of the Department of California. [
She has been passing the winter with Gen- \
eral Forsyth at the Richelieu, and has
been one of the most popular belles of the
past season.
Her debut was made last season, and no
entertainment has been counted a success
without her presence.
Miss Williams is attractive in appearance
and has a charm of manner that has!
endeared her to a large circle of friends.
Tne engagement of Mr. Hobart and Miss
Williams will probably not be a long one.
Tneir wedding will likely be celebrated
late in the spring.
CHUTES TO-DAY.
Some Extraordinary Attractions to Be
Provided at the Popular Haight-
Street Kesort.
If the wind does not blow at too great a
rate this afternoon, the most novel and
thrilling balloon ascension ever given in
this City will be made at the chutes.
Essie Viola, the daring young Australian
aeronaut, and Emil Markeberg will both
go up, suspended to the same balloon by
two parachutes, one above the other, and
when at an altitude of about 1000 feet the
man will cut loose, allowing the girl to
reach a great altitude by herself. A new
balloon, the largest yet used at the chutes,
has been secured for the occasion, and it
will be necessary to pack it with not air in
order to carry the combined weisht, 250
pounds.
"Shooting the chutes" and "tripping the
trolley" are, if possible, increasing in pop
ularity, and in, order to accommodate the
crowds it is found necessary to open at 10
o'clock Sunday morniugs.

DROWNED IN MISSION BAY.
ClauÂ» Homelson, a Ship Carpenter,
Meets With a Fatal Accident.
Claiis Homelson, a ship carpenter, 37
years of age, was drowned in Mission Bay
yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock. The
body was rescued by Robert Gibson, a
boatman, who notified the Coroner, and
the remains were taken to the Morgue.
Homelson and a j'oung boy, whose name
cannot be ascertained, were taking a trip
around the bay in a sailboat. When on
the end of Long bridge, at the foot of Third
street, the boom swung around with terri
fic force and ntruck the unfortunate car
penter in the head, knocking him over
board and presumably rendering him un
conscious, as he made but slight Strug
gle before goint; under.
The boy who was in the boat was un
able to render the drowning man any as
sistance. Homelsou leaves a father and
mother, who reside at Long bridge.
Youthful Criminals.
The question of where certain youthful
criminals shall be confined has caused the
various county Judges considerable truu
ble at various times, because all are of the
opinion thatthe incorrigible variety should
be kept apart from those who might be re
formed. The nuestion is at last settled.
The Attorney-General has given an opin
ion to the superintendent of the Preston
School of Industry that only "juvenile
offenders" can be received at that institu
tion. "Incorrigible juveniles," he says,
"must be sent to "Whittier only, at which
place juvenile offenders may also be re
ceived." â â â  ;

SWEER STAKES
SHE asked for a lamp, though it
was st:ll daylight. "Ah, my
lady,' thought I, "you will have
your supper sent up to you, and
you Hill goto bed." Good heav
ens! what a ride it had been. Forty miles
that day, over the San Jacinto Mountains, j
and here we were stooping, as usual, to j
please her at thÂ« most out-of-tne-wav place
imaginable. Nothing pleased her leÃer.d- i
hunting self so much as calling a halt at
some country hotel, and there charming
everybody out of their senses and cajoling i
stories out of them. She was endurance
personified, s>o I. faithful esquire that I
was, fairiy chuckled when I heard her ask j
for a lamp. But bless my stars, if she !
were not down in half an hour, her bait
a curl in us most fetching manner, and
by the extra curls I knew tne reason of
the lamp. There .was a bit of fluff or ;
gauze, or whatever the stuff was, and a
dainty rosebud for decoration. By that,
her uncle and 1 knew she scented game.
It was perfectly wonderful how she would
appear alter i-he toughest ride, as if she i
had a millinery store at her command
marvelous, when you eor.sider she kept j
everything in a handbag nine by four.
Her uncle whispered to me: "It's the old i
hotel-keeper this time. A dead set on
him. And by the Lord Harry and that |
rosebud she will land him as Hat as a pan- j
case. Just listen to the artful conversa
tion. Just listen to her now. 'Snch a
lovely view' (mimicking her purring, sing
ing tones). 'Such a comfortable porch.'
(Of course.) 'No BUCh sunsets id t he
world.' (She's right about that, i 'Indian
legends.' (She has captured two to-day
en route.) 'Mountain ahaking like jelly.'
(Oh, yes, you are getting there, no doubt.) â¢
'Olives' â 'Fowls' â 'Hunting' â 'Horses.' I
(Jack, my boy, she's got him. She's set- !
tling herself on that rawhide chair and she
has him in the corner. Give me a cigar, j
We will go outside.)" We all sat outside i
â¢watching the glowing amber and the '
glamour of the dusky blue creeping up the
hilj* behind, preparatory to that marvel of
marvels â a California sunset.
The old fellow, with a chin whisker cut
like a jolly Dncie Sam, he saw through
her ladyship, as we did, but with the
chivalry of an old Californian was at her
service for the proper yarn at the proper
time. Sometimes it was her method to
bait a better with a very good story of her
own. She could tell a eood one or two in
somuch that her ancle, who worshiped
her, and I, who worshiped her, too, would
prick up our ears when she would begin.
''That reminds me â "
"Tuat reminds me,'' said she, adjusting
her lace-bordered handkerchief, with its
middle tucked in her bosom and the four
corners spread out like the petals of a j
tinker, li thnt reminds me of a most singu
lar circumstance that uncle and I <jime
across ia-t year. The stage coach passed ,
"What does it mean ?" I asked the stage-driver, for I was sitting up' beside him.
t hrough a veritable deserted village. The
was -weird in the extreme. The
were oil both aides of the street,
and the street itself a narrow gorge be
tween two stoeu hills. There was the fur
lmnre still to be seen through the case
ments. The wild creeping plants had
woven fantastically everything togetherâ
chair to .bedstead, bedstead to window,
t!irou<:h the d^ors â house to house.
" 'What does it mean?' I asked thedtage
driver^ for 1 was sitting up beside him.
(Tne old hotel-keeper gave us the ghost of
a wink.)
" 'It is Beetown, 1 said he.
("Eh?" ejaculated the hotel-keeper sud
denly, as if struck with the name.)
" 'Beetown!' So I said to the driver, ' Well,
where are the bees then?' And as he was
just lovely though one-eyed, this is what
he told me of Beetown.
(The old man's face was as imperturba
ble as a mask as she narrated.)
"About here there used to be considera
i hie mining' done, and of course a tidy bit
of gambling as is usual, but here cards
' was 'nuthen to the boss' they owned.
! Leastwise the animal belonged to Pete
i Wilson, but as everybody had something
' on the 'hoss' one time or another it got to
be owned Dy the town like. Wily, in fact,
I the toy n had another name. Cockeye
Gulch, but it got to be called Beetown
â  af*.er this racehoss, Busy Bee.
"Finest piece of flesh you wish to see;
; 'cleanest hocks you could ever margine.'
'Went like the wind, though he warn't
i straight pedigree, neither.' Well, he won
every race around-for far and near. Noth
! ing could touch him. Nothing wa9 talked
-of in Beetown but that hoss. 'Even tne
children laid their odds in marbles on
him.' (Tne eyelids of the hotel-keeper
quivered, but otherwise he gave no sign;
but my lady had seen the quiver
and inimitably mimicked the twang of the
stage-driver.)
â¢â¢One. day there came to Beetown an un
dersized iittle devil that induced 'em to
let him bring a boss that could match
Busy Bee. You see, the hull town had got
to think Busy Bee warn't born to be
beaten. A mine or two had closed down
lately and there were lots spoiling for ex
citement. As soon as Busy Bee was entered
against that stranger, why Beetown tilled up
like magic. Sportscame from far and near.
The place was in a fever. It got awful! And
wus and wusser as the race drew near.
And on the morning of that race you bet
you couldn't have bought a yard of white
or blue calico in Beetown â for a ransom.
Blue and white was Busy Bee's colors,
and every sheet and tablecloth in town
was cut up for decorations. More roses at
a dollar apiece was round that boss's stall
than would have done for a fashionable
corpse. Finally, just before the race, the
betting got so high that the women acted
lihe crazy creatures; they got wuss nor
the men. They yelled like hyenas, and
suddenly, as if they were all thinking of
it at once, they began to pile their jewelry
into a hat.
"They tore their earrings out of their
ears, the rings off their tinkers, their breast
pins and everything of such like, piling all
heaping high into that old felt hatâ then
staked that too.
"Well, Busy Bee lost! But it was no
other than the great Caraotacus he was
running agin. They had no right to
smuggle in a boss Jlike that Caractacus,
first race or not, considering his pedigree.
It was a dirty trick."
"You bet!" fervently ejaculated the
hotel-keeper, with his eyes closed still.
"Wuli, the mines fell all to pieces, place
was bankrupt, everybody picked up stakes
and left at once. To stay was starvation,
and it was cheaper to leave the furniture
where it was than park it with them.
And that is why Beetown is as it is
to-day. Now, Mr. Hotel-keeper, what do
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAUCH 1, 1896.
you say to that story?" said my lady
triumphantly.
"Say?" said the splendid old fellow ris
ing with the dignity of a chairman, "say?
I say as every word is as true as Gospel. I
was the man as held the hat of jewelry for
the last sweepstakes."
Solemnly he shook hands with her, as if
performing a rite. She Rubbled up to him,
sniffing stories galore on the morrow.
Then he produced some rare stuff to cele
brate her atory with. After she had taken
hers upstairs to please the host with a
semblance of tasting it he told us that
Pete Wilson shot Busy Bee that very day
and himself too. And "that one-eyed gun
ner, the stage-driver, to think he was
alive yet. Why, he lost his eye," but
really we never dare tell her ladyship how
the driver lost his eye. We dare not risk
the narrationâ she might know itâ and
I told you it was rare stuff.

DE. SAMUEL JOHNSON.
HÂ« Wag Very Susceptible to
Flattery.
Johnson, although he prided himself on
his good breeding, was often overbearing,
would sometimes break out with un
governable fury, astonishing, as it has
been observed, "the well-regulated minds
of respectable ladies and gentlemen."
That he should have found solace in
female society is not surprising, but -that
women should have been so fond of his
may be thought curious, for he
never spared them, and frequently
expressed something like contempt
for their intellectual capacity. He
declared that they were the slaves of
fashion, and made other comments by no
means polite to the sex. But Johnson did
not always mean what he said, and when
it pleased him no man could pay a compli
ment more gracefully. Nothing can be
more happy than his saying to Mrs. Sid
dons when for the moment he had no
chair to offer her: "Madam, you who so
often occasion a want of seats to other
people will more easily excuse the want of
one yourself," or his compliment, though
we may suspect its truthfulness, to Mrs.
Sheridan on her "Memoirs of Miss Sydney
Biddulph." "I know not. madam, that
you have a right, upon moral principles, to
make your readers suffer so much."
Dearly did he like a little tlattery in re
turn, and when in his old age he heard the
opinion of a countess that to be praised by
Dr. Johnson "would make one a fool all
his life," he said: "1 am too old to be
made a fool, but if you say I am made a
fool I shall not deny it. I am much pleased
with a compliment, especially from a
pretty woman." It was one of Johnson's
peculiarities that while dressing like a
sloven, he considered himself an infallible
judge of whin ladies ought to wear. "No
milliner of Bond street," says Mr. Craik,
"could he more critical to detect the
displacement of a ribbon, the want of
modishness iv a cap, or inharmoni
ous coloring in a dress." He lectured
Mrs. Thrale on the subject, and he
lectured her friends, and induced one of
them, who was dressed for church, not
only to change her hat and gown, but also
to thank him for his reproof. "It seems,"
says Fanny Barney, "that he always
speaks his mind concerning the dress of
ladies, and all ladies who are here obeying
injunctions implicitly, and alter whatever
he disapproves." This was written at
Streatham, but Mrs. Thrale's guests were
not always able to satisfy the fastidious
doctor. One young lady, whose cap John
son called vile, failed to win his approval
when she had cnanged it. Fanny's own
cap was pronounced very handsome, be
her mother had to change her gown be
cause it did not meet with his approval,
and was then told that she Bhould not
wear a black hat and cloak in summer.â

BUDD AS AN INVENTOR
The Governor Finds Relaxation
â¢in His Mechanical
Laboratory.
HE CONTRIVED A NEW ENGINE.
The Chief Executive of California
Has Made Valuable Improve
ments in a Launch.
The Governor of California is also an
ardent inventor. When weary with the
burdens of state he seeks relaxation and
rest in the mechanical laboratory at his
residence in Stockton. If he catches the
night train from Sacramento or San Fran
cisco, early in the. morning, if you know
the secret of his retreat, you may rind him
iff his shirt-sleeves and overalls, with ham-

mer or saw or file in hand, at his work
beach in the tankhouse back vi his home
on Channel street.
His latest invention is an improved gas
oline engine for his private launch, the
Hazel. Governor Bndd is an enthusiastic
duck hunter, and when the press of other
duties permits he 3tea!s away to the tule
land in the Hazel, with one or two other
crack duck shot 9. But the Governor, be
ing an enthusiast and prodigal of energy
in all undertakings, is also nervous at
times. He did not like the everlasting
thump, thump, thump, and psist, psist,
psist of that gasoline engine â the one that
formerly propelled Dr. Cross's launch be
fore it was burned. The thump and the
psist abo disturbed the even humor of
the canvasbacks and teals and often made
them fly away to other marshes beyond
the reach of bullets from the Hazel
hunters. This caused extra trouble, the
launching of skiffs and long pulls through
the narrow, winding sloughs that pene
trate beyond the high tules. It also
awakened the Governor's inventive facul
ties. Since the day he sailed toy boats in
the washtub James H. Bndd has evinced a
genius for mechanical work, and all
through his busy career he has never
entirely permitted his palms to become
unfamiliar with mechanical tools. At his
residence on Channel street he has a very
complete workshop or laboratory on the
lower floor of the tankhouse. So when he
began thinking about the unpleasant
noises made by the Hazel's engine it was
a natural sequence for his ever-active
brain to 3et to work to seek a remedy for
the defect. And when the voyaere was
over the engine wa3 taken out and carted
up to the tankhouse.
Since then all the hours and half hours
that Governor Budd has been able to steal
from the cares of state and the pressure of
office-seeking politicians have been spent
in removing the thump an.d the psist from
that gaÃoline engine.
He has not been unaided in his mechan
ical work. Dennis Malone and Nick But
ler, fellow-members of the Stockton Ath
letic Association, of which the Governor's
brother is president, by the way, have
shared his labors. Both Butler and Malone
are crack duck shots, and know also a
whole lot about practical mechanical work.
Governor Budd has done most of the
theorizing and as much of the actual ham
mer and file labor as time would permit,
while his two willing and capable assist
ants have put in some heavy licks with the
tools, and have, in a measure, acted as a
balance-wheel to Budd's higher flights of
inventive genius. In other words, they
told him this or that idea was feasible or
impracticable, as the case might be.
And the end of it all has been that the
objectionable noises have been removed
from the gasoline engine. Ana not this
alone, but its speed has been materially
increased. Both Malone and Butler de
clare that the improvements are out and
out inventions of Btidd. and the Govern
or's friendsâ or rather the very few of them
Y> ho know of the existence of that work
shop in the tankhonseâ are urging him to
have his improvements patented before
therr technique is made public.
But the Governor declares he is much
too busy to go into that end of the enter
prise. It is merely a matter of mental re
laxation for him, and the pleasures de
rived from stealing upon the ducks of tule
land unawares and sailing in a svyift
moving noiseless craft repay him amply
for the energy and gray matter exhausted
in the work.
At present the Hazel is on the ways in
Governor Budd's private boathouse on
McLeods Lake, opposite the Stockton
Athletic Association's boathouse. The
new engine is about ready to be placed in
her, and within a few weeks this will be
done and then the Governor and a picked
i crew will be off for a cruiae. Teat* (hat
have been made in the workshop show
that a speed of twenty-two knots per hour
can be maintained almost noiselessly.
This is not the first invention that has
wasted the gray matter of the man who is
now Governor of California, and yet the
Governor has never boasted of his mechan
ical genius. He has rather, in truth, hid
his light under a bushel in this respect,
and only those who are very intimate with
him have any knowledge of this phase of his
life. For years Governor Eudd has spent
a large part of hi? leisure time in his work
shop. He is blessed â or cursed, as one
may view it â witn a brain that rinds rest
in activity, relaxation in diversity of
employment. This latest and perhaps
greatest and most useful invention of his,
however, grows out of the fact that Budd
is also an enthusiast in another line of en
deavor â that of practical out-door athletics.
He is a member of the Stockton Athletic
Association, one of the best and most
complete organizations of. its kind on the
coast. As member of this association the
Governor takes an active interest in al
most all field sports. He knows football
so expertly that he is prized as a referee.
He wields a good hand at the bat on the
diamond, and is a cood base-runner when
in practice. Boating is his strong
hold, however, and when opportunity
affords he pulls a strong oar in
one or the other of the association's crew?.
Thef association baa three barges, one the
"Jim Bndd," a 3!>-foot shell, one the "Van
R. Paterson" and the other the "Oriel."
But since Budd assumed the robes and
cares 6f the Gubernatorial chair he has
had no time for training. Yet his love for
aquatic sports has been undimin
ished, as witness .his long seclu
sion . in the Pollywog after his
illness, and his semi-frequent voyages
to tule land in his private launch. And
now that the progress of the launch has
been rendered practically noiseless and its
speed greatly increased by reason of the
Ciovernor's invention another long voyage
may be anticipated. Soon the Governor
of California may be fleeing from the
troubles of state to the joys of duck-shoot
ing.
HOUSE OF ABALONE SHELLS.
It Is Near Cypress Point and Uelongs
to a Chinese Fisherman.
Odd habitations are to be found all over
California. Sometimes there is a good rea
son for this being odd, but often it is the
result of some crank idea. On the beach
near Cypress Point, in Monterey County,
there is one that cannot come under the
first head, and hardly under the last.
The residence belongs to a Chinese fish
erman, and is part natural and part the
work of his own hands. The natural por-
tion of the house is a small cave in one of
the many rocks that stick up all over the
beach. The other part is a sort of wooden
shert that has been built in front of thi3
opening. The lumber used is of the rough
est kind, but the esthetic Chinaman over
came this objection by covering the- whole
outside with abalone shells, the hollow
sitle being turned out.
The Chinaman evidently did that? many
years ago, when the shells were plentiful
and had scarcely any market va!ue. Every
shell used has been destroyed, as one or
more nails have been driven through them
according to their size. Some of the shells
are macniticent in color and enormous in
size. There Is one at least fifteen inches
in diameter, and a duplicate ifi good con
dition could not be bought in San Fran
cisco for any price. Most of the larger
shells, if they were not punctured with
nailholes, would readily sell for from $3 to
$5 apiece. But that size cannot be had in
the market now, and would be difficult to
find on the rocks of any part of the coast.
The general effect of the house, when
the sun strikes it at the proper angle, is
dazzling. The polished, pearly surfaces
sparkle with astounding brilliancy and
flash with all the colors of the rainbow. It
is a pleasing and surprising sight, and the
only pity is that so many beautiful shells
were destroyed to produce it.
C. P. HUNTINGTON
Writes About His School Days and Gives Some
Advice to Young Men,
THE story of C. P. Huntington r s
boyhood days, published in The
Sunday Call of February 2, has
been read by the famous railroad
millionaire and evidently with
deep personal interest. Some of the
assertions made by Mr. Huntington's
schoolmates are controverted by the mag
nate, particularly Erastus Baldwin's claim
to boyhood supremacy in wrestling. If
this point can be established in favor of
the man who rose so far out of Poverty
Hollow, Mr. Huntington will be known in
history as the man who never was thrown.
With the railroad* battles raging at
Washington ana in Kentucky, Mr. Hunt
mgton has taken time to write out his
version of the wrestling contest and to
give additional reminiscences in substan
tiation of what he says. Building upon
the story of his youthful experience he
has voluntarily contnbuted the wisdom
of his years for the benefit of young men
who are now struggling in their metaphor
ical Poverty Hollow. His letter, addressed
to an old friend in this City, is as follows:
I suppose you have seen published in
one of the San Francisco papers lately (I
haven't it before me here) an article or
letter signed by a Mr. Xunan which pur
ports to be an authentic account of my
early life. It amused me a good deal, be
cause a good deal of it was true, but some
of it was not and that part I don't like to
see published. To be sure no part of it
charges me with any dishonest acts;
but some poor boy whose career is yet be
fore him and who has got to fight his way
upward might thinKon reading this article
that there is something dishonorable and
undignified in honest labor.
I have always believed, as boy and
as man, that any honest work was honor
able, and when I was a boy I always took
the work that lay nearest to me and did it
with all my might and took pride in doing
it so well and so much quicker and better
than any bodj' else could do it that it
would be noticed and thus be the best pos
sible argument that my next job should
be a higher one. I have always found
this policy the best in life and may say
that I have been reasonably successful in
what I have done during the last sixty
year 3of my business life. I have taken
no step backward and no honest man has
ever said of me that I gave less than full
weight and measure or that my word was
not as good as any man's bond.
I do want to put Mr. Neman right in
one or two statements of his narrative.
Where, for instance, he remarks that one
of the boys at school threw me in wreÂ«t
line. That's a mistake, for no one in the
"Hollow" ever threw me or ever could,
and in a rough-and-tumble scrimmage I
could "wipe up the floor" with half the
boys in the school taken together. The
writer of the article also says, on the au
thority of some one in the poorhouse who
says he was a schoolmate of mine, that I
was not a good boy in school. I think I
was a pretty good boy, although I did
have a tussle a couple of times with the
teachers, and I laugh over it to this day
when I think of it. I believe the writer's
poorhouse friend is right in saying that
this teacher's name was Peck. The pen
alty in our school Jprbad spelling, as fixed
by Peck, was one blow of a heavy ferule
on the palm of the hand for every word
misspelled. I was never in those days,
and I am not to-day, much of a speller,
although I believe I worked harder in that
direction than those who were fortunate
enough to find it an easy tapk; but I
objected to the punishment, for it
did not seem to me a fair
thing to do, so one day I agreed
with four other boys that when the spell
ing lesson came up we would all miss
every time. We did so, and as the good
spellers "went up"â as it was called â the
bad spellers, of course, "went down" to the
foot of the class.. We live boys had ar
ranged between us that the first boy called
out for punishment should refuse to put
out his hand and open the fight right
there. It happened that the first boy
called in this connection was not the right
boy for the business; but the next was,
and that was myself. I commenced busi
ness without any delay, and only one of
the four came in to help me; but we two
went for that teacher and we whipped
him.
There was another teacher whose name,
if I recollect right, was Ely â if I ever meet
the poorhouse friend of the writer (who,
by the way, I see says he would vote
against the funding bill if he could), I will
ask him so as to be sureâ but we will call
him Ely. The first day this teacher came
to school he brought with him a bundle of
whips, which he stood up behind his desk.
When he returned from dinnerâ we had
dinner at noon iv those days, the uncanny
looking things were not there â or rather, I
should say, they were cut up into small
pieces. He asked one and another of the
boys who had done it, and they all
answered that they did not know; al
though, of course, they knew TttjT well.
When he asked me if I Knew I said
yes, but when he asked me who it was I
refused to tell him. He said he would put
me out of school if I did not tell; but I
didn't and we sailed in, and there was fun
for the boys for a few minutes, but I was
able to cather him up and take him out
without harming him much. Now, there
may have been something Wrong about
these two schoolboy squabbles, but some
how I do not remenib-r them as being so,
and few recollections of my life have given
me so much innocent satisfaction, or so
often caused a smile, as the remembrance
of my tussle with Mr. Ely.
Now, a few serious words to the boys
with stout hearts and strong arms, and
nothing in their pockets, who have got the
sober work of making a living before them.
Take that work which is nearest to you
until you can do better and work with a
will, doing it as well as you possibly can,
and so steadiiy that -one might almost
think the Fates were doing it, yet turning
your thoughts away from your mere man
ual labor to watch out for something
higher and better. Do this and you will
surely succeed. Be always true to your
self; work with an honesty of purpose, and
spend no money for the things you do not
need. I never in my life used tobacco, and
until I was nearly 50 years of age I did not
know the taste of wine or distilled liquorsâ
notwithstanding what was told to Mr.
>*unan by his poorhouse friend. It is in
teresting and instructive to fierure out how
much money a boy commencing at 15
years of age could have by the time he is
three score and ten years, if he should
save 25 cents a day, and compound it semi
annually at 5 per cent interest. Too many
young men who go out to work watcli the
clock to be sure they don't reach their
work one minute before the appointed
time, or leave it one minute after the regu
lation hour for closing has struck. It is a
great mistake, for the hard times are sure
to come" when those who employ labor
must part with some of it in the interest
of a necessary retrenchment; and then it
will be found that those who loitered on
their way to work and hurried on the way
from it will be the first to be dispensed
with; while those who showed their inter
est in their work by not watching the clock
lest they should give a moment more of
their time than they had agreed to give â
those who staved behind to clean up their
desks and to finish their work rather than
their dayâ will be retained. Those who
work well for others work well for them
selves. Those who do not frequently find
their reward in the poorhouse. How often
have I observed that the manufacturer
who made the best article he possibly
could for a certain price grew steadily
richer; while he who made the poorest
article he could sell for the same price
grew poorer until bankruptcy resulted.
To be successful in the best sense of the
vrord one must work with an honesty of
purpose, giving full weight and measure
and doing all things well to the whole
extent of his ability. The desire to get
rich in a hurry mars the happiness of
many men, for wealth is of slow growth ;
but it comes at last to him who does not
waste his moments but works with all his
might and lives on less than he makes.
Riches thus acquired bring comfort and
happiness. Do not forget, though, that
there is "a withholding that leadeth to
poverty," not only in money but in hap
piness; for the poor we have always with
us, and to them we must always be ready
to give our portion. I do not refer to
those jackals in human shape who howl
along our track with the outcries of the
improvident, who think the world owes
them a living; who want to gather whera
others have sown, who want to pick up
something without laying anything down,
and make those who save divide with
those who will not; for to give to these is
almost a sin, because giving to them makes
the world worse instead of better.
Hoping you are quite well, and with kind
regards as always, sincerely yours,
NAVIGATING THE OLOUDS.
Latest Steering Balloon Plan Invented
by Count Zeppplin.
Count Zeppelin, a cavalry officer, who be
came famous at the beginning of the war
of 1870, has for five years been occupied
with the subject of aerial navigation. On
Thursday evening, at Stuttgart (says the
Berlin correspondent of the Daily News),
he gave a lecture showing the result of his
work before a distinguished audience, the
King of Wurtemberg bein* among those
present. Count Zeppelin referred to the
steerable balloon shown in 1888 by the
French Captain Meudon, whose experi
ments tie confessed bad been a great deal
of use to him. Count Zeppelin has in
vented a means of treating tho pores of
the silk-stuff used in the making of the
balloon so that it will hold the gas for
months. His car is very hrmly attached
to the balloon, with the propeller in front
and steering gear behind.
The motor ia of aluminum with a six to
ten per cent copper alloy. The balloon
can rise to a height of about 1200 yards,
carry a weight of nearly two tons, and, if
necessary, remain seven and a half daya
in the air. The expansion of the gas by
warmth is met by conducting what may
be called the overflow into a reserved
space, so that the balloon cannot burst,
and yet lose no gas. Accent and descent
are effected without throwing out ballast
or loss of gas. The advantages of Count
Zeppelin's balloon have been fully ac
knowledged by the Prussian military au
thorities. They reckon the maximum
speed attainable to be live meters per sec
ond (say eleven miles an hour), but the in
ventor claims at least twelve meters per
second. .â¢â¢".'
The Count is convinced that his balloon,
if practically carried out, will be able to
travel for weeks at a speed of about sixty
miLes per day, bearing a fairly heavy
weight, and would be of the greatest im
portance in times both of peace and war.
The Standard correspondent adds that
the Count does not consider it worth
while to construct a small model, as it
would cost nearly as much as a full-sized
balloon, namely, 250,000 to 300.000 marks.
At Aldershot, by the way, they are more
cautious about communicating similar de
taMs of ballooning inventions.âWestmin

STREER SPORTS IN SAN FRANCISCO
AN FRANCISCO has been called

â youngsters in a manner tnat would excite
the envy, could they see them, of those
f favored boys who live - level .round.
Just now, while Eastern children are still
enjoying their winter coasting, sliding and
skating, the boys of San Francisco are in
the midst of the kite-flying season. : . i
This is a diversion that, to the extent to !

It is not that boys in all cities do not fly
kites, but the kite season is a peculiarly >

There are several reasons for this. The
steady, pleasant winds thai blow at this
season; the unusual advantages offered by
our blessed green hills and the example
! set by the many Chinese and Japanese in
our midst, with whom the pastime is i
almost national, are somei of these. It has
sometime?, indeed, been a matter of sur-

The snow and ice bring many joys to
Eastern children that our youngsters by
the Golden Gate can know nothing of.
Coasting, however, is not one of these. I
have dared many a perilous descent in my
childhood days, but never anything half so
thrilling as a plunge I saw four boys take
recently down the grade from Jones to
Taylor streets on Broadway. Their
coaster was of a sort the most primitive, a
lone board on what had. evidently once
Jeenthe rollers^ fi^oLA^. The
sor of sweep attached to the board an
which apparently served .as brake a/id
rudder. Down they swept, like a small
whirlwind, with a yell and a whirring of

the heart of a tenderfoot. Seeing them
one might have thought they were rushing
headlong to destruction, but the watchful
angel that seems to guard the destinies of
boys was, as usual, close at hand, and the
daring quartet, made the descent safely,
and miming quietly around the corner
into Taylor street just as I had closed my
eye? to avoid- seeing them dashed to
atoms.
The boys who live about Telegraph and
Russian hills have a. perilous fashion of
coasting on rough sleds down the sides of
the cliffs, a descent sufficiently allied to
danger to render it royal sport for a boy.
In the rainy season, when the ground is
wet, slippery and treacherous, coasting
over snowdrifts is not half so exciting. It
is really a very pretty and nerve-tingling
sight to see the little fellows scramble up.

and dash down again, a whole line of
them, in single file, in their rudely built
sleds. Were the sight not close at hand
we might well.deem it worth traveling far
to witness as a picturesque exhibition of
reckless daring. â¢ ' â¢
It is only among the North Beach hills
that this sort of thing is popular. The
boys of that locality arc of a more reckless
nature, even in their play, than are their
fellows south of Market street, for; in
stance. This may be : because they are of
different nationality or .because of the
greater freedom of life on the high hills
that overlook the water. "Whatever may
be the reason, it is certain that one sees no
such life-and - limb - endangering sport
among the dwellers on the south side. The
boys about Rincon Hill have a pretty way

of coasting on roller-skates, and it is an in
teresting sight to see a string of them,
hand in hand, come swinging down the
steep grades of Harrison and Bryant
streets. I spent a pleasant half hour or
more not long ago watching a sturdy lad
of perhaps 15 treating half a dozen little
chaps to rides on his feet. He was
mounted on roller-skates himself, and
upon his downward trips he would take a
small boy on each foot. Clinging tightly
to their friend's legs, the small chaps
wriggled and screamed with delight as the
queer trio buzzed along down the hill. If
appearances go for anything each mem
ber of the queer coasting party was about
as uncomfortable as human beings could
well be, but it would have been hard to
tell which was the most supremely happy.
Hop-scotch seems to be a favorite diver
sion among both boys and girls south of
Market street, while on the north side
"duck-on-a-rock" holds h'rst place in juv
enile esteem. Here again topocraphy
plays an important part in determining
preference. There are stones to be had in
plenty along the rocky cliffs and streets,
and the cliffs themselves make jolly .back
grounds against which to set up a "'duck."
I watcned a group of boys playing this
game on Powell street, at the foot of the
high bluff up which Vailejo street clambers
and goes wanderiug heavenward. Quaint,
forifccrn-lookint; little fellows they were,
making a pretty pictnre bending back and
forth in their muscle-developing sport,
and I caught pnraÂ«es from half a dozen
different languages in their talk. French,
Italian, German, Irish, Mexican, Spanish
and one negro lad were among the group
playing this Yankee game in this most
interesting of cities. It is hard to forecast
what is to be the outcome of all this mix
ing of races, but certainly if we are wise it
should be something good and of ultimate
value.
The cable lines afford some odd amuse
ments to the boys. A single roller-skate
and a long bent wire were the equipment
with which I some time ago saw a daring
little scamp have a perfectly glorious timn
on Union street. The wire was bent in
some way, so that when thrust tbroueh

; upon one foot, the other swinging free, the
' amateur gripman wassailing into paradise
I on an even keel, when a stony-hearted
policeman saw and summarily ended his
enjoyment.
Before the trolley superseded the cable
I on the Mountain View road in Oakland
the boys living along that line had a con
-1 trivance on a similar principle, but on a
more elaborate scale, that for a long time
was a source of endless joy to them and
unbounded terror to passing horses. Their
i contrivance consisted of a rude platform
on four very small truck wheels. Some
, mechanical genius among them had rigged
up a very practicable sort of grip, and for
a time it is probable that this primitive
car made more trips in a day and carried
more passengers than did the combined
rollinc stock of the road's lawful owners.
A favorite game among the newsboy c,
and which during this winter has taken a
most amazing hold upon the small girls in
some of the lower districts of the City, is
"shooting craps." I have seen a painfully
large number of groups of girls this win
ter engaged in this pastime, sitting on the
sidewalks at the foot of flights of steps or
against convenient area-rails. The sight
is a curious if not particularly attractive
one. The object of the game seems to be
the increase of the collection of buttons
which each girl makes. on a long string.
I have wondered a good deal as to how the
game sprang into such wide popularity
among them. The circumstance is cer
tainly one to be noted with regret.
It is something of a pity that among
our many missions and movements and
philanthropies we should not have one
with its object the teaching of pleasant
and wholesome games and amusements to
the children whose sole playground is the
street. There is a wide Held in San Fran
cisco for such a mission. In certain quar
ters our streets swarm with children of all
nationalities and from every sort of
unfortunate environment. They follow
the natural instinct of childhood to
play and they play ugly things,
rough things, and stray into ways
that lead to harm, because they do not
Know better. If practical philanthropy
could devise some means by which this
little folk could be instructed in pretty
and wholesome games.it would certainly
have a marked and beneficial effect upon
their after lives and remove from our
streets the spectacle of restrained and
apathetic or mischievous, troublesome and
ugly child life that is so much more com
mon than are the picturesque phases of
play in our City streets.
To some this suggestion may appear
fantastic and impractical, but it is made
in all seriousness, and I see no reason why
such a good work might not become as
feasible as our fruit and tiower missions,
boys' clubs and college settlements have
proven.
Why could not our next woman's con
gress, which is designed to bring about the
immediate betterment of the whole race,
devote a little time to a discussion of how
to help the children in this regard? It
could be done, perhaps, even without the
aid of the baliot. Adeline Xnapp.
FARGO'S DIVORCE INDUSTRY.
It Pays the Town About a Quarter of
a .Million Dollars Annually.
North Dakota has gained considerable
notoriety throughout the East for the ease
with which divorces are secured within
its borders. Fargo has more fame in this
direction than any other town for various
reasons. It is most easily reached and i
affords the pleasure-loving contingent
greater opportunities than any city in the !
State except Grand Forks. Its hotels are !
new and up to date and there are nunier- i
ous private boardin<r-houses that cater es- :
pecially to those who are here to end their '
marital troubles.
The modus operandi is simple. In nine '
cases out of ten the defendant in the suit i
is as willing that a decree should be se- ;
cured as the plaintiff, and aids in every :
possible way by accepting service and em
ploying a local letial light to look after his
interests. In such Cases the decree is often
secured within ten days after me ninety- â¢
day probation has expired. In fact it has
sometimes occurred that the divorce was
granted within ninety-one days after the
applicant arrived in Fargo. In these cases,
of course, personal service was secured,
and there was no contest in the way
of alimony. In cases of desertion",
or in others, where the residence
of the defendant is tinknown, six
weeks additional is required for the publi
cation of summons. The attorney's fee
varies from $50 to any higher amount with
the trouble necessary to secure the decree
and the ability" of the plaintiff to pay.
The colony includes people in ail walks of
life. Even laboring men come here and
work while establishing their residence.
These are the exception, however. The
seekers after single blessedness are, as a
rule, well supplied with funds and able to
pay liberally for what they get. Some dis
tinguished people have been temporary
residents of the State and are men and
women in all walks of life, and titled
foreigners are not an exception.
The divorce business has frequently
been referred to as a North Dakota in
dustry, ana ia really to be regarded as
such. A canvass of the hotels and private
boarding-houses shows that there are to
day about 150 members in the local divorce
colony. This means from $3000 to $5000 a
month for the hotel men of the city. It
also means from $5000 to $10,000 for the
local attorneys. In addition to these ex
penditures the stores receive directly,
perhaps. $2000 a month in the way of
divorce trade. The sentiment of the
citizens is entirely in favor of the "in
dustry." The matter is looked at purely
from a business standpoint and is advo
cated on all sides.
Another noticeable feature is the haste
with which some of the plaintiffs again
ruÃh headlong into matrimony after hay
ing been granted a divorce. One case is
on record where a trip was -made directly
from the Judge's, chambers to the
license-room and return and the second
marriage performed by the kindly, court
in fifteen minutes after the decree had
been granted and befcre the ink used in
signinc the divorce papers had time to
dry. Indeed the majority marry again
within six months after being divorced.
All kinds of schemes are worked to avoid
publicity. Members of the colony often

THE GIRL WHO HAS BECOME A WRITER
BY "W. O. MOR,R,O"W r .
Dear Miss Scribblehard : ReceitÂ»t of yonr
letter and of marked copies of newspapers
containing articles written by you is
acknowledged. Your numerous questions
and expressions of hope and aspirations
set me a difficult and somewhat unpleasant
task. I would rather you had appealed to
one who makes the training of the young
a business.
A reading of your contributions dis
closes many things that are familiar to
the older worker with the pcn â and the
head. Ability to write well is the final
test of mental discipline. However bright
a beginner may be, provided he is not one
of those geniuses who know things with
out having to learn them, lack of expe
rience in the writing craft must inevitably
appear in his work. For that reason alone
an editor who has a wise head and a kind
heart will sternly repress that consuming
and altogether pitiful ambition of tyros to
sign their work. Possibly there lives here
and there a knave of an editor who real
izes that by tickling a fledgling's vanity by
permitting tbe signature he can secure
passable work for little or no cash pay
ment. There are indubitably cases in
which the editor, both wise and kind, per
mits the signature with a knowledge of the
fact that the indulgence will encourage a
very sensitive, fine-grained and ambitious
beginner to put forth extraordinary ef
forts and thus advance all the more
rapidly in the art.
Even in such cases the editor must suf
fer a pang to reflect that in the time to
come, when the 1 beginner has developed
into an able and sure craftsman, a glance
through the old scrapbook will bring
many a flaming blush to the cheek of its
compiler. Writers, particularly those who
are original and imaginative, are unhap
pily a sensitive crowd, and this fact stays
the tongues of those whose criticism
would be valuable. Unhappily, also, it is
those dull, floundering blunderers devoid
of critical ability who are the freest with
their criticism, and its very stupidity and
obtrusive ignorance merely offend with
out improving.
The qualities which make a signature
valuable are various, but as they are not
j to be looked for in the work of a beginner
it is hardly necessary to discuss them here.
It is curious, however, to note the differ
| ence between young women and young
i me:i in this regard. As a rule the boy is a
I great deal more mode3t than the girl. In
1 the beginning he is dismayed by a sugges
i tion that he sign his work. He seems to
realize that outside the little group of per
! sons with whom he works there lies a vast
: world of shrewd, sharp, able intellects
ready to scoff at mistakes and treat imma
turity and ignorance with contempt. Hh
desires to try his legs at walking before he
'â¢ essays a race with expert runners. Mucn
J of his timidity is pure bashfulness, an
awkward quality that seems foreign to the
composition of the average girl. As his
. experience ripens and his range of vision
; expands he realizes more and more the
| stupendous magnitude of the task which
\ he has assailed and the hopelessness of
.proving able 10 lift his head above trie
I waves that tower about him. Thus he too
easily falls contentedly into the position
'â¢ of a newspaper hack, and grinds out his
i life in a dreary round of detail.
Not so the ambitious young woman.
Nothing appalls her. Not being bashful
she may also not be modest. But as self
assurance is a necessary element of suc
cess it is exceedingly valuable where it is
not self-destructive. The one safe rule in
writing is to sign nothing whatever, ex
cept, possibly, stories, unless it be on the
earnest suggestion of a competent critic;
and the best of all is the editor. He will
make such a request if he deems it right.
That is a very different matter from
wheedling him into consent. He is the
quickest of all critics to discover a new or
original quaiity in a beginner's work.
Comparing your letter with your pub
lished work I observe a number of curious
differences and easily discern in the ar
ticles the veiled hand of both the editor
and the copy-reader. I notice that the
editor, for a number of conceivable rea
sons and from one or more possible mo
tives, has left ruirious errors of form, taste
and information in your work. He has
permitted your mixed metaphors to co
limping without splints, your infinitives
to remain with their parts divorced, your
squinting clauses to look two wav 3at
once without shame, your "onlys" to keep
improper company, and in general has
let your lack of a study of the English
language, particularly that branch of it
which concerns construction, to be merci
lessly proclaimed.
In the absence of an intelligent effort on
the part of your schoolteachers to saturate
you with an understanding of what
"style" means^your editor has apparently
| left it to Providence and time to cure you
of the use of commonplaces and of hack
neyed phrases and quotations. He has
j permitted you to indulgfi the use of
French words, possibly trusting that as
you prow older you will learn that this
practice invites the scorn of the judicious.
He has let you try the hopeless task ol
j transforming the English into an epigram
t matical language by the employment in
I some of your articles of a choppy, frisky
; and jerky style that is exceedingly un
! pleasant. lam not blaming the unhappy
editor for these things. If he is deserving
of punishment there is a special world set
apart for that function, and I have no
jurisdiction there.
The copy-reader has been much kinder
to you, though you seem utterly deaf to
the hints that he has been giving you
these last months. His diligent pencil
has read you a sharp lesson in every
article that you sent me, and yet your let
ter shows that you have been blind and
deaf to his instruction. It is true that
copy-readers have duties additional to the
correction of errors in punctuation, spell
ing, capitalization and the like, but it is
true also that the greater part of their
hard labor is devoted to those matters.
That such revision should be needed is a
reproach mare to the schools of this coun
try tiian to the newspapers. It is the
duty of schools, not of editors, to teach
children the art of reading and writing,
for you must bear in mina the fact that
no one can read intelligently and not
write accurately. The expectation of copv
readers to find none but defective manu
scripts is so firmly anchored in experience,
and they have become to believe so
strongly id the infallibility of their own
system of details, tnat they are unwilling
to pass even a finished product without
stamping their individual ideas upon it.
This is said with due allowance for the
fact that every newspaper has its own
rules with reference to the minor details
of composition and that in the necessary
haste of newspaper writing inadvertent
errors will appear. The point here made
is that the writer can be instructed by the
copy-reader's revisions, and he who is
either too dull or too indifferent to accept
the benefit will never become a finished
writer.
1 am grieved to see you insisting on
calline yourself a "newspaper woman" and
a "newspaper writer" and casting slurs
upon those who "Dorapously proclaim
themselves- journalists." That is not
modesty on your part. lam aware that
even some sensible writers ridicule the use
of the word "journalist" as being pompous
and pedantic. They are sorely in error. A
journalist is a person who publishes, edits
or writes for a journal, and a journal is a
newspaper. It is an honest and intelligent
word, and its employment is a recognition
of the dignity of the profession.
Your expressed hope that your "news
paper work" will be a "stepping-stone to
higher achievements in literature" betrays
a grievous but common error into which
young writers for the transient press com
monly fall. If there is a relation between
journalism and literature it is too weak to
be of use in this letter. "Literature" is a
vague and indefinite term, and the only
sensible relation that journalism bears to
it is that of form. So far as substance is
concerned, each produces its own mental
habit and these are not mutually inspiring.
Without troubling about the numerous
exceptions of journalists who produce ex
cellent literary work, it is sufficient to say
that as a rule the person who is eminent
in one of these professions is not in the
other.
Moreover, the question of adaptability
must not be ignored. The "newspaper in
stinct" is a thing of itself. It is true that
many journalists cherish the belief that
their wide observation and their acquired
ease in writing and thinking fit them for
the production of a wonderful novel,
which, had they only time to write it,
would make them famous and rich. It
should be evident that if it were in them
to write such a novel nothing under the
sun could restrain them. It should be
equally evident that they have uncon
sciously fallen so profoundly under the
spell of journalism as to De slaves to its al
lurements. That undoubtedly explains
why they are successful as journalists. It
often happens that a writer abandons jour
nalism for literature, but rarely after he
has proved conspicuously successful as a
journalist.
This brings us back to the matter of
signing what is published. The indi
vidual in literature, as in all other kinds
of pure art, is a necessary part of his
product. It is not so in journalism, because
a newspaper, instead of being the product
of an individual, is that of a number of per
sons working in harmony and dominated
by a guiding hand. It is this combination
of intelligences that makes it valuable and
strong. The true journalist is but one of
the wheels in a mighty machine. There
fore, ii is contrary to the spirit of journal
ism to give it that personal quality which
a sienature represents.
It is common and right, however, to
leaven the practice of anonymity with
signed articles produced by writers who
have special qualities more valuable in in
dividual dress than as a combined and
level product. But it is evident that the
individual product roust have a distinctive
and strongly personal quality, and that by
reason of that fact the signature is valua
ble to the reader as well as the publisher.
Hence it requires a prodigious hardihood
on the part of the young writer to assume
that his work possesses such a value.
I believe that as you grow older and ac
quire more experience you will become a
successful journalist; but I insist that if
you are aiming to make journalism but a
"stepping-stone to higher achievements in
literature' the sooner you drop journal
ism and take up literature the better
litterateur you may hope to become.
The pressure brought to bear upon
newspaper editors by girls who are
ambitious to become writers is beyond
comprehension. For every untried male
applicant for a position there are probably
ten female. Perhaps it is because the op
portunities open to girls are much more
restricted, but this does not alter two im
portant facts: First, that comparatively
few women are in journalism, and second,
that the work is exceedingly laborious and
wearing.
IN A GEEEK OAIE.
The Fare Was Atrocious, but the
Charges Were Kegal.
Neither was Mahmoud with me when I
went to the Greek Fair, within a mile of
the Sweet Waters, the beautiful fountain
and the more beautiful houris whose eyes !
shone large an(J luminous through their
thin veils. This day the air was delicious,
the sky like a delf plate, with puffs of
white clouds in hieh relief. For hours I
watched the merry-go-rounds and the jug
glers on their mats, untii I grew hungry
enough for even a Greek cafeâ and it is a
brave and reckless appetite that dares an
Oriental kitchen.
This cafe was under a tree, with a few
pine boards for a table, the galley being
within handing distance, with a charcoal j
fire blazing. The abominations of stew !
and fry and toastings were intolerable;
but I succeeded in getting a box
of sardines and half a pint of native
wine, a loaf of bread, and some raw
tomatoes and salt, with* a bit of onion,
which I gathered up and spread out on the
pine boards. When the combination of
chef, head waiter and proprietor, all cov
ered by one fez, presentert bis bill, it
amounted to a sum that would have sup
ported an Oriental and bis family for a
month.
There are occasions when your individ
ual pantomime is more effective than the
closest translation of your spoken words.
Mine to mine host ended in an abrupt
turning on my heel, with hands tightly
clenched. When the crowd began to take
sides with the Greek and matters assumed
an ugly look, I threw upon the ground a
silver coin equal to one-fourth of the
charge. This turned the tide. The by
standers considered the sura too appall
ingly large even for a Greek fair!â F. Hop-

Ex-President Harrison and Speaker Tom
Eeea both ride bicycles. Nothing odd
about that. It takes no jot or tittle away
from whatever fame is theirs. But just
mount George Washington on a wheel and
we become almost offended at the carica
ture. It is all right if we show him on the
back of a mettled charger, but the form of
the Father of His Country, attired in that
glorious old Continental uniform, doesn't
look natural on a bicycle. Yet Washing
ton believed in plenty of outdoor exercise,
and, were he in the land of the living to
day, he would doubtless be seen, after
office hours, working his little bike with
that characteristic nerve and energy which \
our relatives over the ocean were taught ;
to respect. ' ; \ . â¢
Napoleon Bonaparte would have been
charmed with the bicycle had it existed in
his day. It would have been necessary for
him to get a wheel made to order to suit
the requirements of his short legs. On an
old-faahioned ordinary, however, the Coi-
Bican, upon whose genius the world still
gazes with awe, would have made a ridicu
lously funny sight. . ; ;
. Wellington was better proportioned for
a rider of the bike, and; had it been his lot
to discover that Xapoleon had become an
expert on the pneumatic wheel the Iron
Duke would never have rested content un

the- rival, whose star he was destined to
pulldown. â¢ â¢ - V : " ."
Julius Caesar had a proper build for a

be last in the rear of the procession.
Women of the present time are reviving
th.c ruffles and big sleeves of Queen Eliza
beth's period. It is only fair to give Eliz
abeth a chance to even up a little, even if
this evening-up process only go so far as a
pictorial ride on a bicycle. Elizabeth had
a superabundance of nerve and not all the
criticisms of all the writers in England
would have had a deterrent effect on her
if she had once taken the notion to wear
bloomers.
Marie Antoinette would have been hor
rified at the very thought of bloomers and
she would never had ridden a bike in her
days of spendor unless the bike bad Deen

reach. But there are many queenly women
in the year of our Lord 1896 who ride the
wheel, and some of them wear bloomers,
too.
Shakespeare would have experienced
more pleasure than almost anybody else
if he could have worked the treadles of a
modern "safety." -He would have framed
lyrics to the winged wheel and sonnets to
bloomers. These verses, from one of the
Shakespearean sonnets, might serve a pur
pose as a reference to the "bicycle face" of
a girl with the rose of health that defies
description :
And their gross painting might oe better naed,
Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
I never saw that you did painting: need.
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both j our poets can in praise llevlse.
Had the bicycle furor reached Britain
when the Bard of Avon was engaged in
building up the languaee, he might have
found it convenient to substitute "bike"
for "horse" in such places, for instance, as
this chorus in Henry V:
Now all the youth of Knglana are on fire:
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse.
The cast in America to-day is that pas
ture and horse are both being sold to buy
the pneumatic wheel. The average horse
is hardly worth his feed, and the animal
whose ancestors pranced under plumed
knights of yore is now bsing .done up in
sausages and other tempting dishes for the
foreign palate.
If that mountain of flesh and slave of
"sack," Jack Falstaff, had struggled vio
lently witii a wheel instead of scurrying
about with his ragamuffin band, as re
corded in Henry IV, he could still have
availed himself of this same speech:
. Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this
lastttctlon? I)o I not bate? Do I not dwindle?
Why, my slcin hangs about me Jike an old lady's
loose gown: I am withered like an old Apple-
John.
One might imagine that Macbeth had
just mounted a wheel for his first attempt
when he exclaims:
I am settled and bend np each corporal agent
For this terrible feat.
And this abbreviated conversation be
tween Lady Macbeth and her "worthy
Thane" contains strong suggestions of an
ultimate triumph over a tandem:
Macbethâ lf we should fail-
Lady M.-We fail !
But screw your courage to the sticking point
And we'll not fail !
â¢'Come, wilt thou see me ride?"- cries

A PICTURESQUE WRECK.
How the Ship Goaford Looks on the
Hands of Point Conception.
On the 18th of November, 1893, fire was
discovered in the hold of the British ship
Gosford while she was at sea on her second
Wreck of the British Ship Gosford on the Beach Near Point Conception at Low Tide.
[Sketched from Hie deck of the steamer Santa Rosa.]
voyage. She was on her way from Liver
pool to San Francisco loaded with coal,
and had been 13(5 days out at the time.
Captain Markham, her master, consulted
with the crew and decided to make an at
tempt to beach his ship. Four days later
the Gosford was seen close to shore two
miles below Point Conception Lighthouse.
Captain Alexander of the steamer Santa
Rosa saw her from the deck of his vessel
while passing down the coast, and after
stopping and finding he could be of no as
sistance proceeded on his way to Santa
Barbara, whence he telegraphed the
news to San Francisco. Several tugs at
once went to the scene, among them '..he
Fearless and Monarch, and made every
effort to save the vessel. They worked for
two days pumping water into her hold,
but in spite of their efforts the deck burned
throueh and she had to be abandoned.
The crew dad no difficulty in making land
in boats, as the weather was tine and the
sea almost as smooth as glass.
For several days the tire burned fiercely
until it had consumed everything combus
tible about the vessel, and then died out.
The wrecking steamer Whitelaw saved
little from what was considered a good
iron ship, and she was left on the beach to
become a picturesque wreck.
It was thought at the time that the Gos
fonl would soon go to pieces, but in spite
of the effects of twenty-seven months'
buffeting of the elements she is still stand
ing to-day apparently as good as when she
was lelt to her fate. When the Gosford
struck she went broadside on the shore
with her nose pointed east, and all the
storms that have raged since then have
failed to budue her.
The Gosford is certainly a tribute to the
ability of her builders, for every mast is
still in an upright position. Her hull
structure has been strong enough to keep
them from falling; over. The wreck can
be plainly seen from passing steamers and
at low tide, when the sea is smooth, her
bulwarks show several feet above water.
The deck nouses have, of course, been
burned away, but the empty space has
been riiled with such pieces of rigging as
fell from aloft. A tangle of wire ropes
bangs over the bows and from the masts.
Only a few yards are still in place and they
are loose and swing from side to side,
creaKing mournfully with every gust of
wind.
That portion of the coast where ihe
wreck of the Gosford lies. is dreary and
barren. A bluff of dry yellow sand rises
abruptly from the shore only a few hun
dred feet away and forms a background
that throws the four rusted masts and
swinging spars into strong relief.
Investigations by the people at Point
Conception lighthouse show that the bot
tom is gone out of the ship and that the
sides are rusting away rapidly. The water
rushes in and out of holes in the hull even
when the sea is smooth, and when it is
rough it sweeps from stem to stern, and
the lower masts are almost concealed from
view. t
The wreck of the Gosford may stand in
its present position for a lone time to
come, but the chances are that the first
heavy gale will break the rusted deck
beams apart and the masts will fall ove?
and disappear.
ADVOCATING THE CHARTER
The Merchants' Association Tak
ing the Initiatory Steps to
Boom It Along.
A Call to the Framers of the New
Law to Be Issued by Secre
tary Freud.
The friends and advocates of the pro
posed new charter for the future govern
ment of Snn Francisco are not eoing to re
main dormant between now and the day
of election in their advocacy of the neces
sity of voters supporting the proposed law
at the general election next November.
The first move to this end was made
in the office of the Merchants' Asso
ciation through Secretary J. Richard
Freud, who has. prepared the following
notices, which will be sent through the
mail to-morrow to the Board of Freehold
ers who prepared the charterâ George T.
Marys, Irving if. Scott. M. H. Hecht,
William F. Gibson, I. J. Truman, J. J.
O'Brien, Jerome A. Anderson, Colin M.
Boyd, Louis Sldss Jr., Henry Js. Clement,
GustaveH. Umbsen apd Joseph Brittan:
The quarterly meeting of the Merchants' As
sociation will be held at Beethoven Hall, 336
Post street, near Powell, on Thursday evening,
March 12, at 8 o'clock. Special subjects for
the meeting: Firstâ "Past, Present and Future
Work of the Association." Secondâ "Street
Sweeping, Surinkling and Paving." Thirdâ
"Proposed New Charter for San Francisco."
The above important subjects, closely con
nected with the prosperity of this City, will be
presented to the meeting.
The members of the Board of Freeholders'
who framed the new charter have been invited
to spt- ak briefly upon the charter. A synopsis
of the new charter, prepared undor the au
spices of this association, will be given to each
person attending the meeting.
You are earnestly requested to be present,
.and a cordial invitation is' also extended to
your families and friends. Respectfully
yours, Merchants' Association.
F. W. Dohrmann, President.
J. Richard Freud, Secretary.
Dear Sir: The next quarterly meeting of the
Merchants' Association will be held ou Thurs
day evening, March 12, at Beethoven Hall.
The boani of directors has unanimously de
cided that the proposed new charter for San
Francisco be the special subject for considera
tion and that each member of the Board of
Freeholders be invited to attend the meeting
and take part in its deliberations. You are
therefore cordially invited to be present on
that occasion and the secretary of this associa
tion will soon personally call upon you to
ascertain your pleasure in also making* a few
remarks upon the new charter. Respectfully
yours, F. W. Dohkmann, President.
J. Richard Freud, Secretary.
The synopsis above mentioned will be
Tfepared by Mr. Freud and forwarded to
each of the above-named gentlemen, who
will be expected to give their views in ex
plaining the benefits sought to be accom
plished by its adoption.
In addition to the individual members
invited to speak, the chairmen of the
more important committees which had the
sectional subjects to consider during the
session of the freeholders will give their
views very fully on the matters embraced
under their respective headings. For in
stance, on finance and revenue Colin M.
Boyd will explain. On civil service J. J.

give his views on the department of pub

and all will endeavor to show that out of
a revenue of $6,700,000 which has been ap
propriated from the taxpayers for the
fiscal year of 1895-96 a better showing
could be made if a better system of its dis
tribution obtained. This will be the prin
cipal aim of the meeting â to show that by
the new charter a decidedly better system
can be had.
In this movement by the Merchants' As
sociation the Civic Federation and kindred
societies are united and will have repre
sentatives present at the meeting to assist
and encourage the boom.

handsome furnishings, with the exception
of several valuable massive bronzes and
the rare pain flags which adorn the walls,
and converted into a handsome ballroom.

A PHENOMENAL SWIMMER.
The Coast Record Nearly Attained by a
Lad of Sixteen.
The Alumni Swimmers gave their second
annual tournament last Friday evening,
in which several fine records were made..
The first race was a 50-yard dash, which
was won by P. G. Earl, with T. Seymour a
good second. Time, :38%.
The second race was a quarter of a mile.
M. L. Mlee captuied the first prize, with
A. Anderson a good second. The first
prize was an unset diamond and the second
a Fiik bathing suit.
The third event, which was the most in
teresting, was captured by Louis Hass
hagen. It was lifty yards, and was won in
:35>Â£, which is within a few seconds of the
coast record, held by Dan Renear of the
California Swimming Club.
This young phenomenon was born in
San Francisco sixteen years ago. His first
race was at the Pied mo*n ton February 20 of
last year, when he was beaten by P. Ameo
in a 75-yard spurt. Since then, however,
he has not been beaten and has rapidly
improved. In March of the same year he
was awarded the silver medal for being the
champion of his club. In May he won two
races in succession, in which the judges
allowed him but one first prize, as a rule
provided that nobody can carry off more
than one first prize. Young Hasshagen Is
5% feet in height and weighs 117 pounds.
What is remarkable about this young
wonder is that he uses the sailor's stroke,
which is uncommon to the raciug class of
swimmers.
BAB ON FACIAL BEAUTY.
A Woman Should Walk Little
and Sleep Much and
. Often.
MUST ALSO WEAR NIGHTCAPS.
Evolution of the Women's Suppers.
Substitution of Brandy and Soda
for Champagne.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24, 1896.â A1l
the new books, that is, excepting the an
alytical novels or those that bear tLe
stamp of the Beardsley school, are falling
back on that oJd, i* somewhat trite, say
ing, "a thing of beauty is a joy forever."
There must be a demand for beauty, or
rather a demand for the means tending
toward beauty. In one bookshop I dis
covered many books, wise ones, that told
how to care for tne complexion; many
others that explained how angles could
become curves, how dull eyes could be
made bright, and how inferior brains
could be developed into brains far beyond
the average. Then there are innumerable
pamphlets of the olden day, in which the
seeker after the beautiful, as depicted in
her own person, is advised to get up early
and breathe the first air of the new-born
day if she wishes to be "sweet of face,
sweet of breath and sweet of skin." This
may answer for August, but any would-be
beauty who attempted it in March would
be apt to get the cniiblains, a red nose and
a violent cold of the order that shows it
self in its demand for ten handkerchiefs a
day. Hence, it would seem as if the
pamphlet of yesterday or the day before
is not alwayssuited to general use.
Two are before me at present; one is
paper bound, brown of color, has "f's for
s's," and is altogether homely looking.
The other is quite new; bound in a spring
like tint in cloth, with a disagreeable look
ing young woman for a frontispiece. It
tells, notwithstanding its modern binding,
much tnat is true, but it doesn't tell all
that the pamphlet of the olden days seta
forth as necessary to the increase of
beauty. The old-timer says that if a
woman wishes to be beautiful she should
have dainty food beautifully served, that
she should be unacquainted with grease or
vinegar, and that she should learn the
value of a rich dish that is at the
same time not a heavy dish. This
wisdom boiled down means that one
should live well and take care of
one's digestion. Then it goes on to say
that she who aims at beauty should sleep
well and often; that, put into plain Eng
lish, signifies that the mind should be free
from care. She is not advised to walk
much, which, to all intents and purposes,
is equivalent to saying that something
masculine should love her well enough to
[ earn for her a fine coach and pair, in
which to take her walks abroad. For she
is to have fresh air without exertion. To
keep her hair beautiful '.low don't raise
your hands up in horror- she must braid
It smoothly before going to bed and over
it she must put a nightcap. You may not
fancy this, but it is well known that most
of the women of to-day who have beautiful
hair wore nightcaps made of fine mull
when they were tiny children.
Let us sve what the book of to-day says.
Not yery much in the way of helping the
plain woma'i to become a beautiful
woman. A good bit is said about the sort
of clothes tl.at should be worn, and this is
sensible: "No properly understood hat or
bonnet can afford to be anything but sim
ple and single-minded in the impression it
produces. Over-abundance is the abomin-.
ation of desolation; and confusion of ideas
has been the death-warrant of many a
blameless bonnet. For, consider: The od
jeet of its existence is to surmount, to
crown and frame a human countenance.
And if that face be beautiful already,
what possible collection of beads, straw,
fur, moss, plover's eggs, pink roses and
plumage is likely to draw closer attention
to the lovely and delicate lines beneath?
And if the face be irregular in shape,
faded or muddy in color, unfortunate in
length or size or breadth, what concatena
tion of the animal, mineral and vegetable
kingdom is calculated to lead away the
critical eye to some happier point in the
wearer'sanatomy?" If this only teach
one woman how to buy the right sort of
hat! But no, until the end of the world
the small woman will overtop herself with
a cartwheel hat such as Nell Gwynne wore,
laden down with plumes, heavy with flow
ers and tricked out with ribbon bows,
while the large, stately matron will crown
herself with two rosettes of lace connected
by a band of pink velvet, in the center of
which is a small forget-me-not in rhine
stones. As if one could forget that bonnet
on that woman! The dotlet on the eye is
large beside it. If I- were learned I should
say, "0 Tern pore! 0 Mores!" but, as I am
not, I simply say, "Goodness, gracious!"
and wonder when the right bonnet and
the right woman will meet, and what the
result will be.
. To return to the book of to-daj\ It
makes another truthful statement. It
says: "English women are, as a race,
smitten with a strange passion for tying
on things." That this is true nobody who
has ever seen the English woman abroad
can doubt. She buys a piece of ribbon at
the bargain counter and manages to pin it
at her waist; she possesses a bit of lace,
and it appears at her throat. Flowers and
ribbons and lace meander at their own
sweet will over her bonnet, and ane is
never satisfied to leave her gown as it
was when it came from the hands of an
artist. She puts some tags of finery on it
and thinks she has improved it. The
English idea of dressing can be damned
wltn faint praise by reminding you of one
thing: It was the English milliner who
first put trimming on a sailor hat. The
hat that of ail others should be either
E pluribus unura or in puris naturalibus,
which is it? The stiff, somewhat coquet
tish straw hat which demanded nothing
but the straight band about the crown,
had flowers and buckles, lace frills and stiff
feathers tied on it by the English milliner
and lost its individuality, and became a
hat without a reason for existence, which
is, I can assure you, much worse than a
man without a country.
It may also be added, on my own hook,
that in addition to her fancy for tying
things on herself, the English woman has
tfie greatest yearning for hanging tilings
on herself. She jingles with a chatelaine,
she is doubtfully decorated with a neck
lace sufficiently long to permit its locket,
hear.-shaped, to rest upon her heaving
bosom, and then she wears bangle brace
lets, chain bracelets, watch bracelets and
every other sort of bracelet that can be
got at a reasonable price at what she
calls the shops. Her brooch is sufficiently
large to announce it as a thing of use,
even if it isn't one of beauty, and yet, and
yet, here's wh?re this nice" little house of
cards tumbles over, the English woman
looks the handsomest and dresses the best
for a ball or for a dinner of any woman in
the world.
Of its own free will that book turned
over a page as if to exploit this bit of
wisdom: "The wife does not exist in order
to contribute to man's happiness, yet she
continues to exist, because she does con
tribute to it, and over her dressing table
should be written, 'Beautiful women can
do as they please, but a plain woman must
please to do a great deal.' " I suppose
that is true, and yet who would want to
marry the Venus de Milo, and have her
posing about the house all day? By the
by, that reminds me that we thought of
sending our fox terrier to the dog show
as the canine Apollo, but ever since he
jias heard it he has been so glad about
it that he has eaten too much, and hia
shape is moje that of an apollinaris bottle,
or of an elderly Hercules, than the gentle-
I man whose figure was supposed to be only
1 equaled by that of William Muidoou. i
But, after all, and this is my last quota
tion, the book of to-day gives hope. "It
says: "In the merciful scheme of nature
there are no plain women; there are
women who dress badly, women who are
dull natured, women who take too much
medicine, women who take too little food.
But giveu fresh air, exercise and the same
contented mind which followsâ and,
above all, given large enough looking
glasses, there can be no excuse for women
not looking well and being attractive."
Speaking of women invariably suggests
man, by some queer law of opposites, or
whatever you choose to call it. but any
how it does. For a long time the young
woman who appears on Broadway about
1:45 Saturday afternoon, with a box of
sweets, her opera glasses and dressed in
her very Dest suit of clothes has not been
altogether happy. She has not really had
a matinee young man. There was no
doubt in her mind that John Drew was
getting old; that is, old to girls who are
19, and then at his best nobody ever ac
cused John Drew of Being a beauty. Of
course, there were many worshipers at
the shrine of Kelcey, but the news started
and quickly got about that he was marble
hearted; that the matinee girl might
love him to the extent of violets,
even to scarfpins, but that he would
not long to Know l.er; in fact,
would prefer to buy his own violets
and his own scarfpins. Mr. Bellew had a
great following, but the matinee girl who
adored him is now a wife and a mother,
and has forgotten whether his first name
is pronounced In one syllable or whether
he is ignominiously called "Curley." But
now, the one so eagerly longed for. so
earnestly hoped for, so often dreamed of.
has come. He is far and away ahead of
the others because he is manly looking;
his voice in sweet but deep, and the M. Y.
VV. says that it has such a lovely effect on
her that she dreams of "Lost Chorda" and
organs and angels every Saturday night.
He is handsome. Even elderly women,
who cannot be called M. Y. W.'sdo not
hesitate to say that, and some gushing
ones are quite willing to become mothers
to him. This greatness (that involved in
being the joy of the M. Y. W.) has been
thrust upon the gentleman in question. I
do not know him, but I do know the M.
Y. W.s and from their behavior I am
sure that the man for whom they
have been looking so long, the modern
King Arthur, Launcelot and Prisoner of
Zenda, all rolled into one, is here. He is
Mr. James Hackett, who last year was the
delightful Australian eallant that led
Napoleon's wife into all sorts of trouble,
but who this year is playing the "Prisoner
of Zenda." and as a girl who was eating
gumdrops said, "Playing it so my heart
goes thump, thump, thump, and I am
afraid the strings of my stays are going to
break." That is one of the signs of win
nine the M. Y. W. Jesting aside, Mr.
Hackett is a young, handsome actor,
charming to" look at, pleasant to listen to,
and who, I hope, will be wise enough to
grow into his proper place, i c., become
the leading man of the Lyceum Stock
Company. That is a great thing now
adays for an actor. Everybody from the
learned pig up to Sarati Bernhaidt and
Mr. Brodie stars; hence tbeie is nothing
individual in it. But to be one who ftoes
to form a perfect riclure, one who in a
grouping of good artists has his niohe and
tits it perfectlyâ ah, that is something!
Speaking of the theater, a good many
women this winter have kicked in their
pretty way, and as only a woman can who
wears a No. 1 slipper with a high heel,
against the expense of suppers.
A few years ago one could ask one's
friends to drop in after the theater, offer
them something hot from the dialing dish,
something cold from the sideboard, any
thing to arink that happened to be hand\\
and the supper didn't cost much and
everybody had a good time. Then trie
nouveaux riche took possession of London
and New York, and counting everything
by dollars, announced that there could be
no hospital'tv without champagne. Try
to nave eight people to supper and give
them enough good champagne to satisfy
them and see how much lighter your
pursÂ« is the next morning. Foolish
women, imitating those with more money
and even less brains than themselves, fur
nished good champagne in small quanti

It Is Located in a Japanese Town at Last.
I.N two Very prominent instances, here, j
in the land of the . west, a watch fac- }
tory has proven a d-.smal and com- |
., plete;. failure as a speculation for j
.:â :) -town-booming purposes. It was sub
stantially one and the same watch' fac
tory, but it Dad a wandering career
of misfortune while its chief advocate
was coaxing stock subscriptions out
of townsite companies in order to float
an enterprise in which he demonstrated
his abiding faith by backing it (on terms
of his own dictation) with his experiences
; as a. builder of time-pieces.
Perhaps there was never in the world,
â¢.-outside of California, a watch factory
â which, after being built at vast expense,
provided , with costly high-grade ma
chinery, and manned by a big corps of
- skilled operatives, started out to make
\ watches for the million and shut down
forever before one .of its watches had
reached. the market.
in the days of the boom and of free
flowing capital in Southern California the
watch-factory agent ushered in his mag
nificent scheme. He succeeded in retting
into the newspapers, and the result was
the creation of a sort of a demand for the
watch factory, Money was plentiful,
people confiding, speculation the general
order,' and the watcn-factory idea was
.taken up as a pretty good method of
â whooping up the sale of lots in a new
locality. .....
Nobody peered very deeply into the
actual possibilities of the factory. No
.body figured on- the doubtful results of
competition with the old-established fac
tories of the East, with their stored-up
capital, and all standing ready to outbid
in the open market a new-born enterprise
that challenged them to a tilt for trade.
The boom was at its height in San Diego
. along in the year 1388, when P. H. Wheel
er, an expert watchmaker from the Elgin
(Illinois) factory, appeared and unfolded
The Osaka Watch Company's Building at Osaka, Japanâ Japanese at Work.
[From a photograph made at Osaka.]
his plans to some of the energetic citizens.
He convinced a number of San Diego capi
ta! ists that a watch factory was the very
identical thing they had all along needed
to give permanency to their prosperity,
and to be a further allurement for lot
investments. It was concluded Wheeler
had a great head; that an outlying town
should be made a manufacturing center,
with the watch factory as a starter; that
the .land around the town should be
bought by the acre and retailed in lots,
and that there was no question as to the
certainty of the realization of "a big
thing."
Otay, at the southern extremity of San
Diego" Bay, was selected as a favorable
site. The Otay Watch Company was
formed, and W r heeler was sent East with
carte blanche to purchase the required
machinery. He bought the very best and
shipped it to San Diego. Now the com-

pany borrowed money on its lands, and
borrowed more on its improvements, it ,
luilta three-story brick structure for the
factory and a number of cottages for,
laborers. The company's credit was num
ber one, and the company wasn t back-,
ward about using its credit. j
At length the watch factory was fin ished ;
the plant was in place; every department |
had its complement of workmen and j
operation* were in full progressâ when the
boom burst, the tide of immigration was!
turned another way and the credit system
fell with, a crash. ,
The financiers who had loaned lunas
to the factory project were themselves
now pressed "for money, and of course j
tbey wished the watch company. Ihe ;
company, with all its reputation to make, ,
had no" sooner got ready to introduce
its wares on an uncertain market than the
death of the boom put a quietus on the
Otay factory.
Experts have declared that the watch
nii/7cm*Â»Ai were of superior quality, but
the world knew nothing of that and the
bulk of the company's stock remained un
sold. Financiers would advance no more
money; laborers struck for their wages;
F. A. "Kimball, the San Diego capitalist,
foreclosed a mortgage on the company's
works and then levied on the watches and
watch-movements, and the Otay company
was completely tied up and absolutely
helpless.
Mr. Wheeler is what the busy world
calls a rustler. He didn't linger about the
brick tomb of his Otay hopes and "weep
his sad bosom empty.- He gathered him
self together, oiled his wits anew, and pro
ceeded to a fresh field.
In 1889, San Jose was endeavoring to
work up enthusiasm in the real estate
market, and a number of speculators of the
Garden City were employing brass bands
'â â  to attract attention to New Chicago, which
: was to wrest from Alviso her supremacy
!as a mart of commerce. Here was Mr.
Wheeler's opportunity again.
"Gentlemen," he may have said, "the
; way to build New Chicago and sell off the
j acreage in town lots is to start it as a man
ufacturing place, where labor will be sup
ported by solid industries. You can't be
gin better than by putting up a watch
; factory. A watch factory at New Chicago
1 will advertise the site all over the land and
j across the seasâ advertise it in a substan
! tial wav, and it will attract other indus
j tries, which, in turn, will bring in more
i people, till the fame of Milpitas shall be
overshadowed by the glory of the young
giant city that shall be known to future
generations as the offspring of the business
| genius of San Jose."
Many good citizens of the Garden City
rushed to embrace the fair scheme of the
clever maker of timepieces. Wheeler's
picture of the outlook was so glowing as to
make any opposition ashamed that it ever
I had the iierve to exist. He showed how
: the valuable watch-movements at Otay
, could be purchased for a songâ incredibly
cheap; and how the machinery, practically
new, could be obtained. at a 'way-down,
second-hand figure.
Did the San Joseans jump at the chance?
That, is the supposition. They organized
the San Jose Watch Company, and se
cured the services of Attorney John E.
Richards to unravel the legal entangle
ments of the Otay factory and negotiate
for the plant. The barrister went to San
Diego and brought harmony out of chaos
insofar as the plant was concerned. He
found grass growing in the streets of Otay ;
the cottages deserted ; the factory showing
the dust and rust of disuse, with tools,
jewels and springs lying around in a state
of reckless neglect. In a week the attor
ney bad matters straightened out to such
a degree that he was able to ship all the
1
I materials for watches and watch-making
: to San Jose, leaving the San Diegans to
'' settle amonj: themselves the dispute over
| the lands appertaining to the Otay Water
Company.
Mr. K ~im ball's interest in the Otay plant
! was protected by a mortgage on the New
j Chicago factory. Then Mr. Wheeler path
! ered his scattered forces again, and the
j company was assured that the factory was
; fully equipped and ready to begin making
' money.
After the first week of operations at the
new factory, the members of the company
got down to serious figuring. They dis
! covered that tht- waiches being made could
never be sold for an amount equal to the
[ actual cost. Mr. Wheeler couldn't remedy
| the situation. As a result, the Han Jose
Watch Company at New Chicago had
turned out very few watches, and had put
; very few movements together when the
members of the company quit advancing
funds. Mr. Kirn ball took the factory and
New Chicago lots, equal in area to a small
farm, and Mr. Wheeler sailed for Japan.
; He interested some wealthy Europeans
j and Japanese in his enterprise; returned,
! bought '.he Ot<y and New Chicago mate
rials and machinery, and shipped it to
Osaka in the land of the Mikado.

serve as relics of the vain efforts to create
booms in real estate by building watch

! If the land schemes which resulted in
directly in the manufacture of that little
watch had proved as successful as that
| timepiece everybody who may regret the
! fact that he was interested in the original
1 California watch factory might be in clover
I to-day. As it is, the outcome of those
[ meteoric scheme?, as far as they relate to
' this State, is enough to have stamped a
i look of pain on the face of the California
made watch.
And how about the Japanese watch fac
tory which uses the machinery that once
formed quite a basis of hope for a New
Chicago?
The transplanted factory is operated by
; the Osaka Watcli Company. The directors
are Japanese, and I*. H. Wheeler turns
'â¢ right side up with eire as general superin
j tendent. The company is making 25
watches, 60 clocks and 25 watchcases per
day, and is the only factory in the world,
moreover, that makes watches, watch
i cases and clocks complete under one roof.
Mr. Wheeler claims that Americans
have nothing to fear from Japanese com
petition in this industry. On the other
I liand, it is said, the departure will stimu
late the demand for American watches,
j the Osaka watch being on the American
! plan*
The lowest-priced watch made at. Osaka
is sold for 14 yen (silver dollars), and ac
cording to -Mr. Wheeler the company is
] "not making very much at that price."
j The newspaper report that the Japanese
were making watches for 50 cents apiece
is scorned as an absurdity. Mr. Wheeler
declares that ''the cost is nearer $5." It
i cost nearer three times the latter figure to
j make watches at New Chicago.
The Osaka factory is said to be a success.
The Japanese pick up tne trade rapidly.
j Theirwages average about eighteen silver

P. 11. Wheeler travels about the interior
j of Japan in a rickshaw drawn by Japanese
coolies. He is a bigger man at Osaka then
ever he could have been at Otay or New
Chicago.
Yet it is to be hoped that providence and
protection will defend this land againÂ«t

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
I. I
IN the village of White Oaks, in one of
the great Pacific States, lived and
practiced two members of the legal
fraternity, through courtesy generally
classed as lawyers, and known re
spectiveiy as Jerry Fellows and Barney
Kraiken. Had either of them resided
elsewhere the ether would easily have
taken rank as the greatest liar in the vil
lage; but as between the two the question
of precedence and superiority in the art of
fabrication remained one not readily deter- j
mined.
The differences between them in the
particulars noted were more those of
method and practical detail than of re
sult. "Whatever the modus operandi of
avoiding mere vulgar fact, and of giving
the fullest expression to "the thing that is
not," none ever doubted that either of
them possessed great ability in that direc
tion. Fellows, it may be said, was not
especially gifted with the qualities which
make a plausible and convincing ro
mancer; but he was industrious, pains
taEing and persistent. What his
creations lacked in quality he made
up for in quantity ; and the fact
that his narrations were sometimes crude
and clumsy in a large degree, lacking not
only consistency, but quite often other
necessary elements of probability, de
tracted nothing from his tame except so !
far as it prevented his being generally
recognized as an artist in Ins profession.
As will be seen, however, when the exi
gencies of the occasion demanded, he met i
every requirement of a practical nature so I
thoroughly and well as to leave nothing |
further to "be desired, except, perhaps, for
getfulness of his reputation for veracity.
Kraiken's talent was of a much higher
order. Being less industrious than his ;
competitor, he was unable to turn out so
larpe an amount of the raw material; but j
the exquisite linisti on one of his produc
tions made it worth, to the lover of the
artistic in mendacity, at least a dozen of j
tlie ordinary "misfits" of his rival. Nor !
did this Qnihti impair the force or strength |
I of his inventions. In the matter of pictur
esque originality and lofty disregard of j
tbe verities, lie could have made Munchau- :
sen, had they been contemporaries, re
double his efforts or lose iiis laurels. In
| deed, in his mouth, as in that of Fellows, j
! truth would have been much stranger than
fiction, though mainly, perhaps, on ac- I
! count of its unusual environment. But lie
I was little given to such experiments for :
'. the sake of comparison or oiherwi.se. For â 
! him all truth Jay at tlie bottom of the well,
{ and that fact and the consequent dilli- j
culty of reaching it may bare uirnished j
him some reason for preferring to use the ;
substitute therefor which his intellect
seemed spontaneously to generate.
.So, between tlie two "professionals," at '>
j the time our story opens, honors were !
j about even, some contending that Fellows
was unequaled in oral liciion, others that
: Kraiken only was worthy to compare or
j rank with himself; but, in general, each
; individual espoused tlie claims of which- ;
i ever one he had last heard detailing tbe
' marvelous or incredible.
TI.
The magistrate who "dispensed with jus- :
tice'' in the village was the soul of surly :
! honesty and possessed much common- '
! sense. The Gordian knots of law and fact
that were brought to him for disentangle
ment he often cut in a way that justifies 'â 
j our estimate of his judgment, albeit he set j
HIS HONOR READS HIS DECISION.
legal form and precedent at naught. A
grim sort of humor, too, was sometimes
manifest in his rulings, and more than
one litigant, seeking judgment for his
pound of flesh, had departed from Judge
Grawler's court a wiser and madder if not
a better man, and, somehow, painfully
impressed with the idea that, if their re
spective positions were reversed, he would
have a joke of the lirst magnitude on the
opposing party to the suit.
Corollary to the Judge's love of justice
was his utter hatred of all that savored of
wrong. And he was thoroughly con
sistent â perhaps too much so â in that he
hated the wrongdoer as savagely as the
wrong itself, and held himself the natural
enemy of every willful violator of the law,
moral or civil, whatever his voca
tion or degree. By reason of this
radical bias he sometimes became an
advocate where he should have been only
a judge; naturally inclining to defend
<vhat he believed to be right, and to thwart
arm discomfit its every assailant. Espe
cially did he dislike, and delight in oppos
ing, "that class of attorneys who seemingly
believe that Jegal ability consists in cap
tious quibbling, the suppression or per
version of all damaging facts and
the misrepresentation of testimony.
Woe to the pettifogger who at
tempted an outrage upon justice in the
court where Judge Grawler presided ! And
won to the client, also, unless his cause
strongly appealed to the worthy magis
trate's sense of right ! If ever justice failed
in securing full recognition of her demands
in that foruru it was in some case where
the demand was made in behalf of one
represented by such an attorney or who

JUDGE
was himself known to his Honor to be
aggressively dishonest. If such a litigant
did not get the worst of it, it was because
his case was so clearly a meritorious one
that his unclean practices ami agencies
and his bad character combined could not
be considered a full offset thereto.
Fellows and Kraiken were the only at
torneys in White Oaks and were often be
fore the Justice as opposing counsel in
some trivial matter. Their professional
attainment?, as already described, were
well known to him, of course, and he so
heartily despised them both that he made
but little effort to conceal his dislike.
After a time it began to be noted by
shrewd observers that whoever appeared
before Judije Grawier with either Kraiken
or Fellows as his attorney was in danger
of Josing his case, unless the opposite side
was represented by the other. Indeed,
the Justice had nearly admitted as much.
"I always like," said he, "to have both
them durned pettifoggers in a case or nary
one. One uv cm is sich a good offset to
the other that my prejudices don't have
any chance to interfere when they're both
there and on different sides."
111.
Bilberry, the dairyman, by his attorney,
Kraiken, "commenced an action before It is
Honor against old Jack Tappan to obtain
judgment for milk (described in the com
plaint as "goods, wares and merchandise,
to wit, milk"), which was alleged to have
been theretofore "by plaintiff sold and de
livered to said dei*nUant, at his (said de
fondant's) special instance and re
quest, and for which the said de
fendant promised, undertook and agreed
to pay the said plaintiff the full sum of
forty-six dollars ($46) gold coin of the
United States therefor whenever thereto
requested by said plaintiff." The com
plaint also contained the usual allegation
of demand of payment and refusal to pay,
and averred .''that the said sum has not
been paid, nor any part thereof, "out the
whole and every part and parcel thereof,
to wit, the full and undiminishei sum of
forty-six dollars, is now due. owine and un
paid from said defendant to the said
plaintiff, as hereinbefore alleged, set forth
and stated"; and conclude.! with a prayer
for judgment against defendant ''for forty
six collars and for plaintiff's costs of suit
in that behalf, by plaintiff paid, laid out
and expended; and for such other and
further relief as to plaintiff in equity and
good conscience may appertain and
beion;:."
Tappan was a thoroughly unscrupulous
and disreputable old rogue, who never
willingly paid a debt, so he carried his
c.ise to Fellows. That worthy at once be
gan a defense. 'Van't you prove that you
paid him?" he asked.
Tappan didn't know âhe "mought."
"Billy Benson drove the milk-wagon all
that t<me, an' now he's gone back to
'Stralia."
"Can 't you prove that you paid him?"
cunningly suggested 11 r.. Fellows.
Tappan started. Hi* face brightened.
"Byjux! that's jist what I did, ""he said,
with alacrity. "I paid Billy an' tuck his
'â  receipt fur it, jjst before he went away, an'
<â  I lost that receipt with a passel uv other
papers jist a few days ago.''
"Well, you can swear you paid him, and
he isn't here to dispute it. Everybody
knows that Bilberry allowed Benson to
! collect bills for milk; and that'll knock
j him clear out. He can't beat that," said
: the honest lawyer.
So the answer of the defendant was duly
filed in court, alleging payment of all "out
i the last month's bill and offering to allow
! judgment for that in the sum of .f'-' and for
j costs to the date of tiling the answer.
At the trial the plaintiff testified that he
had furnished milk to the defendant for
twenty-three months at $2 per month and
that the defendant had never paid any
thing on the account.
FellowÃ lideeted nervously and sucked
an unhghted cigar during the direct exam
ination, and, curiously enough, he made
but few objections to the questions asked,
or to the testimony elicited. He be
gan the cross -examination in a se
ductively insinuating manner and
with n.val whine. It soon tran
spired that Mr. Bilberry knew no
fact in the case of his own knowledge,
except that Tappan was charged on plain
tiff's books for milk and had ignored sev
eral bills recently presented to him with
request of payment. All these he (Bil
berry) had learned from Billy Benson.
When asked whether he knew, as a fact,
that Tappan had not paid Benson, Bilberry
replied: "No, I can't swear that he didn't,
but Benson told me â " Here, on vigor
ous objection from Fellows, the proposed
statements of Benson were excluded as
hearsay. Next, on notion, all the testi
mony of Bilberry, being based on state
ments of Benson, was excluded for like
reason. Here the dairyman's case seemed
to end. He had admitted that he never
spoke personally to Tappan about the
inilu, but had left it all to Benson, his
driver; and Benson's statements were not
in evidence.
But Mr. Kraiken was equal to the emer
gency. He said the defendant had in his
answer admitted that he had received the
milk and could not now deny it. On the
question of payment he (Kraiken) would
be sworn. He accordingly took the stand
and testified that after the action had been"
commenced he had talked with the de
fendant anent the matter; that Tappan
admitted he owed the bi'l and said he
would have paid it "If Bilberry hadn't
been so durned quick a sum' of him" ; and
that this conversation took place nearly a
month after Billy Benson left for Aus
tralia.
Kraiken appeared so well pleased with
the shape Ins own testimony gave to the
case that he proceeded to enlarge upon the
admissions of the defendant, the time,
place and attendant circumstances until
he left the matter (assuming his state
ments to be true) without a "loop or hinge
on which to hnng a doubt."
Fellows cross-examined him at some
length, but Kraiken adhered to his orig
inal statement, and kept multiplying
"facts" to the detriment of the defendant
at such a rate that his opponent was glad
to stop.
Plantiff rested his case.
Tappan, being sworn, testified that he
paid Benson for-all the milk except that
used during the last month. He said he
had never talked with Kraiken on the sub
ject and therefore denied having made the
statement concerning which Krai Ken had
just testified. The taking of the receipt
trom Benson and its subsequent loss were
detailed with great particularity. A te
dious cross-examination by Kraiken left
his story and denials intact.
And now Mr. Fellows asked to De sworn.
He much regretted, he said, that it was
necessary, but the conduct of counsel for
plaintiff had rendered it so. He (Mr.
Fellows) would not see justice outraged
and an honest man defrauded in such
manner and compelled to pay a bill twice
when he could prevent it. In the name of
justice, in the sacred name of truth, he de
sired â
''If you want to testify be sworn," said
his Honor, gruffly.
FelLows stopped his high - voiced
harangui! and took the witness-box. He
said: "Just before Billy Benson left
for Australia he told me that he
had collected $14 from Mr. Tappan for
milk, and I've seen since that time a re
ceipt for that amount in the defendant's
possession. I'm perfectly familiar with
Benson's handwriting, and I know that he
wrote that receipt, and no one else did.
And Mr. Kraiken told me long
alter the time he claims to have
talked with the defendant about the
bill that he had never spoken to him
about the matter at all; but he believed
that when it came to the scratch he would
paj it, notwithstanding the denial in the

While Fellows was on the stand he
looked defiantly at Kraiken, who returned
the stare witli interest. The latter, with a
sneer, declined to cross-examine, but
promptly look the stand and in rebuttal
warmly denied having had any such con
versation with Fellows; and thereat the
two champions of right and justice waxed
warm in dispute, made against each other
direct accusations of unprofessional con
duct, and oblique references to perjury,
until the rasping voice of the magistrate
warned them to desist.

Ifeither of the advocates fe!t any em
barrassment at the thought of arguing the
cause he was soon relieved. Judge Grawler
bluntly announced that he did not want
to hear any argument as both attorneys
had been witnesses, and that he would
render his decision at 10 o'clock the next
morning.
IV.
At the appointed hour the courtroom
was thronged with a irood-natured crowd
of White Oakers, eagerly curious to know
what the honest old Justice would do with
the problem. Both attorneys were pres
ent. Judge Grawier seated himself with
more than his usual dignity. His frown
was truly magisterial, and the air of reso
lute purpose manifest in his compressed
lips was regarded by those who knew him
well as. a presage of "ill to some one, that
being his usual judicial "form" when sen
tencing some luckless offender to "the
tanks."
With eyes fixed upon his desk he began
in cold, even tones and with studied delib
eration: "The court is now ready to give
jedgment in this rase. I've studied over
the matter considerable, an' Ibis is the
way I linger it out: Mr. Bilberry don't
count as a witness because he can't swear
tnat the defendant didn't pay Billy Ben
son. That jist leaves Mr. Bilberry out uv
the case altogether."
Here Tappan grinned in anticipation,
and Fellows cast a malicious glance
at Kraiken. The Justice proceeded:
"Kraiken swears that he talked with
Tappan after Benson had gone, an'
Tappan admitted he owed the bill, an'
saiii he would a paid it if Bilberry hadn't
been so quick to sue 'im. But the defend
ant swears he paid Benson for all but
the last month, an' got a receipt which he
has sense lost; an' that he never talked
with Kraiken about the business at all.
j An 1 Fellows corroborates 'im in most
j partic'lers. He says Benson told
I 'im that he'd collected the money
| from Tappan; an' he also swears that he
j saw the receipt in Benson's handwriting;
an' that just before the trial Kraiken told
'ira he never talked with Tappan about it.
Kraiken denies this and says he never
spoke to Fellows concerning the case out
side the courtroom, an' that's the whole
evidence before the court.
"There wuz more evidence fur the de
fense than fur the plaintiff; an' leavin'
Mr. Bilberry outâ as we mustâ there wuz
only one witness fur the plaintiff an' two
fur'the defense, with the burden uv proof
on the plaintiff." (Fellows again smiles
at Kraiken and winks at, the crowd out
side the railing.) "But (a long pause)
"from circumstances uv the case,
a good deal uv that testimony
must 'a' been perjery; an' I
consider (another pause) that when it
comes to that kind uv work two good
live an' interested witnesses '11 do more
ny it than one. no matter how willin' an'
interested he may be. Therefore I give
the plaintiff jedgment fur forty-six dollars
an' costs uv suit, affixed at six dollars an'
riftv cents. Court's adjourned."
Amid the laughter and gibes of the
crowd, the attorneys seized their hats and
hurried away. Tappan also disappeared.
The assemblage slowly dispersed in small
groups, the merriment of all increasing as
the grounds of the decision were consid
ered and discussed. For days it was the
chief topic of conversation in the village,
and though Judge Grawler's process of
reasoning was deemed peculiar, none
seemed to doubt the correctness of his
conclusions. The attorneys themselves ap
peared anxious to forget the incident â
Kraiken no less so than Fellows. Both
refuseu to be interviewed on the subject,
though they were exceedingly free to
express their respective opinions concern
ing tue learned occupant of the woolsack,
which opinions must be omitted here
for several reasons, but chiefly because
they belong to that clasÃ of matter the
publication of which is prohibited by
statute. No appeal was taken, and
Tappan soon after paid the amount of
judgment and costs, in full, and thus, in
effect, alarmed the justice of the de
cision. Gra.xvii.le P. Hurst.

As "Whitney declares himself one of the

As "Whitney says he does not know what
iÂ« meant in politics by a "movement' it
may be as well to explain to him that in
the Democratic camp, it means something
that don 't go.
Never before, at this season of a Presi
dential election year, have politics been so
quiet as now.; but the very quietness seems
ominous of a stormy time when the big
conventions meet.
The man who predicted the nomination
of Gartield has now risen up to predict
that of Cullom ; but there are people who
do hot believe that any modern prophet
can make, tne turn twice. .
From the quietness with which the Sal

iiruity in its government it is evident that
ii there are any cranks in office the higher
authorities know how to turn them off
promptly at critical periods.
On one day the organ of the Southern
Pacific declares the people's road is a
scheme of rapacious hypocrites; on the
next it declares itself. an advocate and
booineroi the road, and or, the third day
everybody asks why these things are thus.

â . Â«
As the Senators after denouncing the
Spaniards as inhuman butchers, blood
thirsty monsters and cruel demons graveJv
proceeded to pass a resolution asking
Spain to accept the "friendly officeÃ" of
the United States in mediating for the
independence of Cuba, it is evident the
Fj.irit of American humor can be infused
into the stateliest formulas of diplomacy.
CUBAK IITDEFENDESCE.
A more dignified or reasonable resolu
tion than that passed by the Senate with
reference to Cuba could not have been
drawn. It declares the existence of a state
of war on the island, proclaims the strict
neutrality of the United States, places the
belligerent rights both of Spain and Cuba
on a common footing and offers the friendly
mediation of the Trnted States for the
recognition of Cnba's independence. It is
true that curing the debate some exceed
ingly severe attacks were made on the bar
barity of Spanish methods in treating the
insurrectionists, but they were not, like
the resolution, the formal expression of
the combined sentiment of the body; the
resolution stands for that, and it is the
only thing of which Spain could take
cognizance.
It is more than likely that the House
will concur in the resolution. The effect
of this would be an instruction to the
President to offer his friendly offices to
Spain a? a mediator with a view to secure
independence for Cuba: recognition of the
rent rights of Cuba would also come
within the province of the President by
formal proclamation. The difficulties now
IE themselves are the possible refusal
of the President to adopt the suggestion
of Congress, the possible refusal of Spain
to accept his mediation should he offer it
and the question of a war between E
and the United States as the result of such
a refusal. There is a further but more re
mote possibility that Spain may regard
the resolutions passed by Congress as pro
vocative of war and will at once force the
issue. That is a contingency not ...
to be considered.
It happens, curiously enough, that this
country has no settled procedure in cases
of this kind â there is doubt as to whether
the legislative or the administrative
branch of the Government, or both con
currently, should act. Nor is it clear that
Congre&s would have the power to coerce
the President if he disagreed with its
views. This iruch is clear: the over
whelming sentiment of the people of the
United States is in sympathy with the
letter and spirit of the Senate resolution,
and if Cleveland should decide to ignore
that sentiment he would find bimst
far more embarrassing position than that
which he is said to have encountered on
the score of bis fear that serious interna
tional complications may ensue.
There can be no doubt that recognition
of Cuban belligerency would result in a
victory for the Cubans, as it would open
the United States to their transport ships
and purchasing agents; would render
many thousands of Americans free to em
brace the Cuban cause ai,d take up arms
for the independence of the island, and in
less than three months would result in
the equipping of the insurgents' armies in
a manner that would mean the destruc
tion of Spanish domination. It is alto
gether unlikely that Spain would dpsire
either to fight the United States, with the
sure prospect of losing the island during
the struggle, or carry on a hopeless war
lo subjugate the Cubans.
THE VALUE OP TEEES.
J. "W, Freeman of "Woodland has pub
| lished an earnest appeal to the people of
| California to give more heed to the piant
: ing of trees. He rerfers to the intelligent
j attention which the Legislature of lilisois
I has given to the subject, and laments the
! fact that we have no Arbor day in this
State, where a judicious abnndance of
suitable trees would be more valuable
â¢ than in any other State in the Union. He
mentions an instructive circumstance in
his own experience. Upon buying a place
he planted an avenue of walnuts a niiie
j and a half in length, from the seed. Six
years afterward, when he was snowing a
prospective purchaser over the property,
the trees had attained such growth as to
\ attract the purchaser and effect the trans
| fer, for they represented a value of several
] thousand dollars.
We all remember the movement led by
| Joaquin Miller a number of year? ago,
| when he was trying so earnestly to rouse a
| tree-planting sentiment in this State,
| which needs trees so badly. The people of
I San Francisco became deeply interested.
I; The movement bore fruit in a great picnic
;on Goat Island. Thousands of trees were
â  planted that day, and the desolate island
was soon to become an arboreal paradise.
But the ensuing summer brought a tire
that swept the island clean, and all the
â  hopes of the year went up in smoke. That
'. wa? the end of the tree-planting movement.
I' Mr. Freeman quotes an intelligent
; American traveler, who said that Ameri
â¢ cans might well emulate Europeans in the
\ following matters: "The love of the
people, both rich and poor, for the beauti
ful in nature; the love of beautiful trees
and flowers, both in public and private, as
| exhibited by the humble cottager and
j among the villages; railroad stations in
England, France and Germany, showing
the neatness and good taste displayed with
climbing vines, trees and plants, and the
i erandeur of their boulevards and parks."
He might well have added that this same
affection of Europeans extends to their
crops, particularly their vines and fruit
trees, and that it is a purely esthetic re
gard, the natural result of which is the
finest possible methods of husbandry.
Tree-planting in California might well
be a matter of individual enterprise, gov
erned by the simple consideration of com
mercial benefits. It is much less expensive
to. maintain country roads which are
shaded in summer by deciduous trees and
much pleasanter to travel them. A ju
dicious investment in trees for ornamental
purposes, or, preferably, for purposes in
which ornament and utility are combined,
adds a value which increases with time
and which gives a larger return than any
other. The barren aspect of the California
plains is necessarily unpleasant to a
stranger accustomed to the abundant
verdure of the Eastern States. The land
owner who does not recognize the com
mercial value of trees can hardly expect to
; secure. the best results from the ordinary
: pursuits of agriculture.
INSTABILITY. OP LABOE.
Should the announcement made by Pro
j fessor H. A. [Rowland of Johns Hopkins
University of a wonderful invention in
I telegraphy develop the claims made by
! him for it a very large number of tele-
I graphers will be thrown out of employ -
i ment. He is said to have devised a means
for transmitting six different messages
over the same wire in both directions and
for sending 300 words a minute for each
message, making a total of 1800 words a
minute over the same wire. .
Even though the maximum be greatly
reduced, it is evident that the ser
vices of many telegraphers can be dis
pensed with, and that these will have to
seek other employment. They will be in
the position of the hundreds of thousands
of printers who have been thrown out of
employment by the invention of the lino
type. To these may be added the thou
sands of operatives in other employments
who have bad to seek other work because
of improvements in machinery. A great
cause of dissatisfaction and suffering among
workers has its beginning in "source. >;
It is not an answer to the difficulty* to

say that improved machinery cheapens a
product and mates it easier for all to live,
or that those thrown out of employment
find other work in time. It is m the re
adjustment that the wrench is felt. There
is work enough in the world for every booy,
and that must be so to the end of time. The
great question is how to secure employ
ment that has a reasonable prospect of be
ing permanent. Without such an assur
ance there must always be uneasiness and
often severe hardship, and it is there that
the evil lies.
Every improvement in machinery for
taking the place of band-labor is a solemn
notice to mankind to return to the natural
and rational way of earning a livelihoodâ
the cultivation of the soil. Whatever ma
chinery may accomplish in that industry,
the time can never come when it will be
able to prevent a man from drawing his
subsistence from the ground. Agriculture
is the most stabie of all employments, for
its central idea is the home. It will never
be possible to invent machinery to take
the place of human intelligence in the nur
turing of croris. When tir.a.ly the race is
aroused to these facts all attention will be
turnea to the places offering the best nat
ural inducements for the pursuit, and those
localities in which the largest return of
effort and the greatest pleasure in its exer
cise are offered will receive the masses of
the population. First in the rank of such
places in this country stands California,
BAEOMETEES AND CEIMES.
Kobert Q. Grant, forecast officer at Pitts
burg, has been setting forth a theory to the
effect that crimes and sudden deaths bear
a close relation to a low atmospheric pres
s-are. He bases his theory on the criminal
and sudden death record for ten weeks,
and certainly presents a very curious series
of coincidences. But as the period covered
by his observations is exceedingly short
it cannot be taken to have ar.y value.
The possible physiological effects of low
atmospheric pressure are easily imagina
ble. Thus, persons who ascend from a low
elevation to a high pass from a high at
mospheric pressure to a low. In such
cases very marked physiological effects are
noticeable. The removal of the pressure
to which the tissues are accustomed often
produce? gr- at bodily distiess, including
partial deafness and a ringing in the ears,
and cften hemorrhage from those external
parts whic:: are but poorly protected by a
skin covering, as the interior of the nose.
It has frequently happened that travelers
on the railroad crossing the high pass be
tween Salt Lake and Denver, where the
elevation is abont 11,000 feet, have suffered
greatly, some fainting, others becoming
hysterical and still others developing a
mild form of temporary mania. Instances
of distress are exceedingly rare, however,
in comparison with the number of persons
subjected to this change of altitude.
Moreover the change in barometric
pressure necessary to produce marked
physiological effects in the case of change
in elevation is very much greater than
that produced by changes in atmospheric
conditions in a given locality. Therefore
if Mr. Grant's theory has any substantial
foundation we should expect that a change
from a low to a very high elevation would
produce much more clearly defined effects
and hence that they would be observable
in a much larger proportion of persons.
That is to say. crimes and sadden deaths
should be comparatively numerous among
those wbo go from a low elevation to a
high.
Assuming that a reduction of the at
mospheric pressure does develop a crim
inal tendency, it is evident that the effect
of the reduced pressure cannot be deemed
| limited to that form of nervous aberration,
i for doubtless Mr. Grant will not claim that
! moral depravity under such circumstances
i? anything more than a reflex of physical
disturbances. To take any other ground
would be to assume an occult relation be
tween atmospheric pressure and crime,
and surely he would not think of doing
that. Hence if crime is more prevalent
under a low pressure disease also must be,
particularly disorders of a nervous char
acter. Unless his statistics prove these
facts they are worthless.
VICTOEIA'S EEIGK.
An anonymous writer in the Edinburgh
Review for January has presented such a
weil-written, clear-cut view of the reign of
Queen Victoria that no apology need be
offered for drawing liberally upon the
stock of thought and erudition which he
nas furnished. So complete is his article,
so carefully prepared, -that it might be
transferred bodily to the Encyclopedia
Britannica and pass the criticism of the
compilers and reviewers of that celebrated
publication.
Let us stop and think a moment. In
the course of the ensuing summer Queen
Victoria will complete the fifty -ninth year
of her reign, and in the course of the fol
lowing autumn she will have reigned for a
iontrer period than any monarch who ever
occupied the throne of the United King
dom. A reien covering nearly two gener
ations is sufficiently remarkable in itself,
but the great feature of interest is the de
velopment which has accompanied this
long period of sovereignty, and wheh has
wrought material changes in the worid
which may well challenge a corresponding
period in any known century. The world
as it was sixty years ago, to use round
numbers, and as it is now are very differ
ent y>ropositjons, and in the very fore
front of progress and advancement has
been Great Britain.
There will be no attempt in this article
to repeat all tiie figures and statistics
which have been massed by the author of
the Edinburgh Preview article, but some of
the salient points will be selected as illus
trative of the Btudy and research put into
the article upon which this one is admit
tedly based. For example, when the
Queen came to the throne there were some
2fi, 000, 000 persons living in the United
Kingdom, nearly 18,000,000 of whom were
in Great Britain and 8,000,000 of whom
were in Ireland. In the present year there
are probably 39,500,000 persons in tbe
United Kingdom, but of these 35,000,000
will be in Great Britain and 4,500,000 in
Ireland. Little wonder, then, that an
Irish party continues to exist and that it
professes, in season and out of season,
that the interests of Ireland have been
subordinated to those of England, Scot
land and Wales.
But tlvc striKinc feature of British devel
opment during the reign of Victoria, and
the one which will interest the American
people most, since we are and intend to
continue to be the commercial rival of
Great Britain, ib her expansion outward.
I Miring the reign of the present Queen,
England has increased her East Indian
territory by 275,000 square miles, has occu
pied Aden, has created Hongkong, has se
cured control of an additional 200,000
square miles in South Africa, and extended
a sphere of influence almost immeasur
able; has occupied Cyprus, and has suc
ceeded to the administration of the affairs
of Etrypt, with an influence brought to
bear on Turkey which even Itussia has
been unable to overcome. Such is a hast}'
and incomplete summary of the extension
ol the power and authority of the British
Empire within the reign of Queen Victoria,
and, from the recent Transvaal incident, |
one may say with confidence that the end
is not yet.
As to material and mechanical progress
the story reads as though it might have
been taken from the ''Arabian Sights."
When her Majesty ascended the throne
there was only one railway in the king
dom. The railway? now have a mileage of
more than 20.000 miles, and their capital
exceeds Â£1,000,000,000. They carry more
than 900,000,000 passengers a year, without
reckoning commuters, and the average
fare does not exceed 1 penny per mile.
This progress in land locomotion has been
met and possibly surpassed by the advance
on the sea. In IS4O the whole commercial
navy of the nation consisted of about 23,
--000 vessels, the steam fleet then compris
ing only 770 vessels, wi.h a capacity of 87,
--000 tons. At the end of IS!H the tannage
of the steam vessels was nearly 6,000,006
tons, whije the fonnr.ge of the sailing
vessels was only 3,000,000. Steam power
has so greatly superseded sail power that
a comparison is hardly possible, and, as a
direct consequence, the building of wooden
ships has fallen nearly into abeyance, aB
any one can see in our own harbor who
will look at the British ships that come
here.
And now a few words as to the Ameri
can side of the case. The writer of the
article in question, and we quote him lit
erally, mates an unwilling argument in
iavor of the principle of protection to
home industries. He says: "The unfor
tunate Briiish farmer has found it impos
sible to comjiete with distant countr.es,
the rents of agricultu .1 land have every
where fallen and land in some places has
actually Deen thrown out of cultivation."
The disciples of Richard Cob ien and John
Bright are reaping as they sowed. They
could not see, for their selfishness blinded
them, that the cheap loaf implied the
cheap man, aud that the one fatal error
for a nation to mare is to cheapen the
wages of labor, and thereby bring about a
degradation of manhood which a century
will not avail to cure.
This may suffice for a synopsis of an ex
tremely well written and interesting
article, though manifestly partisan and
even prejudiced. The v.nier is obviously
an adherent of the Manchester school,
which puts cheapness in the first rank,
and asserts that if ;be work:ngman can
purchase the necessities of Ine at v low
hgure it is a matter of indifference what
the rate of wages may be or what oppor
tunity be given him to improve his condi
tion in life. In this country a majority of
the American people think they know
better, and because they think so the
election of 1896 it already practically
decided.
AMERICAN.
Recently, while reviewing me study of geog
raphy, I made a most humiliating discovery,
to wit., the map of America and the man of the
United States are not identical. While Amer
ica begins well up in the Arctic ice fields and
does not stop until it sends an inquisitive
wedge into the edge of the Antarctic seas the
United States is much smaller. In truth, save
for Alaska, it would scarcely be more than a
waistcoat on North America alone, British Co
lumbia being the coat and Mexico and Central
America the trousers. Aside from this there is
South America, with Brazil, like a shawl or big
mantilla, clasped with diamonds across its
shoulders, among its other belongings; Chile,
a long scarf fluttering along its side, once diffi
cult to keep in place, and Guiana, a shoulder
knot in ribbon of three colors, one loop prone
to untying and extending too far.
Far be it from me to make light of the land
that bore me. I am aware that. ours is the
greatest country in the. world, containing wise
and most chivalrous men and beautiful and
encaging women; also wonders, natural and ar
tificial, all due to the fact that you and I, citi
zens of the United States, were born here. It is
therefore positively mortifying to know that
had we first Been the light 01 Patagonia we
would have a similar right to call ourselves
American, and to believe Patagonia, as doubt
less it is, the only country of the kind ever im
ported.
I once read of an outlaw whose father â so
stated the paper containing the newsâ was a
Mexican, his mother an American lady. It is
consoling to thus be assured of his mother's
sex, though that is beside the question. Was
not his lather also an American? If born in
Mexico he was quite as I much entitled to the
name as if he were a Californian or a Virgin
ian. Even the English speak of Canadians
and Americans as being of a different race, but
in Canada they would say, and correctly, too,
"She was born in the States." '
An exceedingly handsome young man from
Bogota was ouce introduced to me as a Span
iard. Had he been a woman he might have
been called a sparkling brunette, for his eyes,
teeth and hair all glistened in a dazzling man
ner. When termed a Spaniard his eyes bright
ened a degree or two more and he said: . â -.
"Pardon, I am a South American."
His statement was absolutely correct, and
although 801-iew.hat peneral, was as particular
as he could make it without a chapter or two of
explanation. South America usually resem
bles nothing so much as a kaleidoscope, and
the name of his country had recently been
changed ; but whatever else he may have been,
he certainly was a South American. : .
We are not modest enough to call ourselves
North Americans, and. we rarely use the name
except by general consent as a prefix to the
word Indian. It is small wonder that until
quite recently, as related in jest and story,
English women were supposed to consider ail
Americans as Indians pure and simple. I re
member to have read when a child au expres
sion used, I believe, by Fanny Fern: "Poor
little African." She referred to a small negro
who had been born in the United States, and
who in consequence was not an African, but
in a general sense of the word an American;
The use of the word African, as applied the
negro, is especially misleading, for, although
many negroes are Africans, all Africans are
not negroes, â 
Nearly everything belonging to the United
States is designated by this general and indefi
nite term. Even our flag is called the Ameri
can flag. We might, with equal consistency,
speak of the German standard as the European
flag ; the ragged, Chinese triangle as the
Asiatic nag; or the red-and-white patchwork
quilt of Morocco, with the shears that may
have cut the pieces flung wide open across its
center, the African ting." Even some encyclo
pedias give, among the flags of all nationsâ
great, medium ami smallâ our stars and stripes
with the words, "The American Flag," in bold
letters, and beneath, in characters so small as to
be almost illegible, and these apologized for, in
parenthesis ("UnitedStates"). Why do they not
reverse this? 1 observe, however, that when,
they treat of America, they include the whole
Western Continent, in both map and text, and
they do not mention any one flag its belonging
to this whole continent. It may be that the
term "Flag of the United States" is less eupho
nious and leas brief than "The American
Flan;," but it is at least correct, and is life so !
short we have not time to speai the truth?
There are a few sensible exceptions to this i
generally absurd rule, and hen' we touch the
law. Tnough law. may have little to do with
justice, it endeavors to be exact. We hear of
American citizens, but when a foreigner at
tempts to become one he finds himself a cit
izen of the United States. The expression
"President ot America" would invite ridicule,
and the "American constitution" would neces
sarily be as miscellaneous as an omnibus bill.
And, strange to say, it is not good form to
speak of Washington as the "capital of |
America." vi-v^&iigSgsgSSSf^tetidPtiqHF
When our country and our gTeat-grandsires
were in their babyhood, and America, save for
its handful of colonies, a vague term repre
senting an' unknown quantity, it was proper
to call these colonies by this general name.
But now that our Notion and our men have
passed the age of petticoats and pinafores, let
us not, with the consummate egotism of a
parvenu, monopolize the woid America, but,
sharing it with other Americans, call our
country by its nameâ States. â¢

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
John Conghlm, one of the cattle kings of
Oregon, whose home is at Paisley, Lake County,
in that State, but whose cattle roam over the
three corners of Oregon, California and Nevada
is at the Lick.
Mr. GosgkÃn has been for over a dozen years
in the business. He has a great many beeves
and stock cattle, as well es cows, and is one of
the best posted men v, ho have range interests,
He says there are too n:ary cettle at present,
else the price of beef vould be higher.
â¢It was worth 5 cents last fall," said he, "and
is very little higher now. Usually the price of
beef increases in winter, and it ought to, for it
costs about $2 50 a head each month for hay,
and the cattle flon't take on any fiesh to
amount to anything, eitherâ just about enough
to pay for the care.
"The people of the Pacific Const don't con
sume as much beef as they did five years ago.
John Coughlin, the Cattle King of Oregon, Now at the Lick House.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
No, not even with the increase of population.
The addition of population is little children.
They don't eat anything.
â¢ It is big mining carcps and logging outfits
th at consume beef. It is safe to gay that 1000
loggers or miners will eat more beef thai; 6600
persons in a town or city. They eat almoFt
nothing but beef, generally Epeaking, and
they've got to have it to sustain them in their
hard physical toil.
"It is singultr to me that more attention is
not paid to cattle. There is more money in
vested in the business on the Pacific Coast
than in any other industry. There are enor
mous herds or bands in many places in the
various States and Terr i tories. and, in fact, out
ride of the cities, almost everybody has tome
cattle.
"Our beef is much better and cheaper than
the beef of the East is, as a rule. The same
qua;;iy of beef here is at least 2 cents higher
in Cincinnati, Buffalo, Boston, New York and
other cities.
"There hasn't been any money in cattle in
California, or elsewhere- on the coast, for some
time. Lots of men who once owned big herds,
and men represented rich, have pot out of the
business â been hammered down and knocked
out. There wasn't margin enough.
"This has been a great year for stock on the
range. There is less snow on the west side of
the Rocky Mountains, probably, than has ever
been known. Whether it is dry next summer
depends somewhat on whether we get rain."
TO WORK IS HIS DELIGHT.
"Colonel" Dbqctske, the Strongest Mak on
the Water Front.
" Colonel " Puqtiesne is the strongest man on
the waier front and has held that title for over
twenty-five years. He is over 70 years old
now, but there is not a man in the prime of
life about the wharves who can do as much
work as he can. Furthermore, the colonel is
proud of his ability and says he like? to work.
Where the "colonei " got his title is a mys
tery, but just after the war he drifted into San
Francisco. He said that he came from the
wilds of Missouri and was willing to do any
thing to make a living, from fighting to
"'tending store." There was a demand for
[Sketched from lijc by a "Call" artist.]
laborers at the time, and the colonel was soon
at work loading and unloading BhipÃ. He
would carry twice as much as any of his fel
low-workmen and do it in less time, so he was
soon known as the "strong" man. He was
sober and steady and never out of employment,
bo that he soon saved enough to go into the
draying business and ha 6 been at it ever since.
Colonel Duanesne made more at the busi
ness than others, because, as he did most of
the work himself, he did not have to employ
much help. Stories are told of some of his
feats of Btrength that seem incredible. On one
occasion he had to put a 15-horsepower
tubular boiler on his truck. Such a Job gen
erally takes about four men, but the colonel
did it by himself. He easily lifted one end of
the boiler and Blipped a few btocks under
neath. Then he put a rope around it that he
made Fast to the blocks in the front of his
vngon, and by a few pood pulls the boiler
rolled up the planks just to the place he
wanted It.
To lift 400 pounds is considered a great feat
of strength, but the colonel can do that, and
also carry it some distance. He on^e loaded
his truck with ten mahogany logs taat weighed
nearly 300 pounds each and lipJ to be carried
about 100 feet. When he hac. finished a by
stander said: "That was c mighty big job for
you, colonel."
"Not so very big," the colonal said. "You see,
I like to do a neat bit of work once in a while."
Colonel Duquesne has a strong face, that
greatly resembles Joseph Jefferson's. His fig
ure is bo well proportioned that he does not
look as large as he really is. He is always good
naturcd and happy in his work, and ever
ready to give assistance to a needy friend.
Since he has been in San Francisco he has ac
cumulated a fortune of over $75,000 and owm
a nice house in the Mission. He has never
speculated, and says with pride that he has
made everything by hiÂ« own toil.

THE PARSON'S PROXY.
"The Parson's Proxy" is a tale of life in
a rough backwoods settlement of the South,
where a gang of counterfeiters take mur- i
derous means to drive from the locality |
certain people of character and influence j
whose endeavor to improve the region is a i
warning to the lawless element of their ap
proaching rout. A new and zealous
preacher arrives in the neighborhood, and
finds many an obstacle in the path of his
missionary labors. The leader of the
counterfeiters engineers a quarrel, in which |
he incites a drunken blacksmith to strike I
the parson down. The par?on is nearly!
slain as the result of the dastard plot. The !
blacksmith, in his sober senses, appreci
ates the gravity of his deed, learns that hebaa
been used fora tool, then visits the stricken
man and offers whatever service he can do
to make amends. As the parson cannot
attend "meeting" the blacksmith declares
that he will act as the parson's proxy and (
try and reform his fellow-men. The black- !
Bmitfe becomes a n-ew man entirely, and I
his sincerity is unquestioned. The "leader!
of the counterfeiters, it is learned, has de-
Bigns on several lives, that of the parson I
among the rest. The "proxy" induces the
pastor to visit in the North for awhile in
order to recuperate. At length the pa- tor
returns, hires a saddle-hor9e at the station
and starts homeward. He is met by his
"proxy," who walks, although in a thought- j

; PORTRAIT OF A XEW WOMAN.
"A Clever Wife" is the title of a novel
fresh from the pen of W. Fett Ridge. It
is entertainingly written and has a pecu
liar interest at this period when the
"emancipation of woman" is one of the
common topics of treneral society. The
author takes for his hero a young artist
who is desirous of making a name for him
self. Before acquiring fame or fortune,
however, he meets and falls in love with a
woman who longs to be known in the lit
erary world. Shfl is a strong advocate of
woman's rights and has become convinced
that nineteen married women out of
twenty are no better than slaves. The
artist marries the literary woman and
alter a honeymoon of two weeks the wife
informs her nusband that she is eager to
resume her life work in London, and de
clares her intention of going back to her
"bachelor" quarters, the husband return- i
1 ing to his old lodgings as well, in order
that neither might be hampered in any
way. Thus they separate against the hus
band's will. The wife writes a book and i
makes a hit. Bhft has attained the success
she sought and still she feels a void in her
life. Tne husband has some objection to
being introduced about as '"Miss Cicely
Westerham's husband" and he quits Lon
don for Paris, where he becomes noted in
the realm of art and where his pictures
come into demand. The wife writes an
other book and the artis'. reads in the re
views that it has fallen flut. He knew
how the proud woman's nature would suf
fer from such a blow and longed to be near
to comfort the disappointed. About the
same time his eyes light upon a blue-pen
ciled paragraph that gives intimations of
a scandal in which the name of his wife is
associated with that of a man about town.
The artist starts for London without de
lay, to discover that the dreadful rumor
was started by a spiteful enemy whom i.is
young wife had refused to admit into her
society. Like the majority of stones, "A
Clever Wife" ends happily. The new
woman admits her folly in s"eeking fame
for fame's sake, instead" of the happiness
of a home and the love of a husband, into
whose s;rms she retreats at last to remai'i
shielded alike from the flattery and scorn
of a critical public. [Published by Har

CIVILIZATION AXD DECAY.
Brooks Adams has challenged the
opinion of the world in his new and strik
ingly original volume, entitled, "The Law
of Civilization and Decay." The Critic
terms Mr. Adams' originality not that of
genius but of baneful idiosyncrasy, and
declares that "he looks through spectacles
whose lenses convey a strongly distorted
picture to his brain." According to the i
same authority the book has a dangerous
fascination for the untaught mind, which
might cast aside the writings of scholors,
who have developed their theories from
actual facts, and whose work i 3 conse
quently not so symmetrically clear-cut,
but more in conformity with the com
plexity of social evolution. Following is
a condensation of the theory which Mr.
Adams elaborates:
"Animal life is one of the outlets through
which solar energy is dissipated. â¢ â¢ â¢
Thought is one of themaniiestatlonsof human
energy, and among The earlier and simpler
phases of thought, two stand conspicuousâ
fear and greed." In the earlier stages of
society fear is the prevailing motive, 'â¢'in the
primitive and scattered communities the im
agination is vivid and the mental tyj>es pro
duced are the religious, military, artistic." In
this stage man expresses himself through
architecture. But, "as consolidation n-!
--vances, tear yields to greed, and the economic
organism tends to supersede the emotional
and martial." The economic instinct ex
presses itself In coinage, not in architecture.
'Whenever a race is so richly endowed with
the energetic material that it does not expend
all its energy in the daily struggle for
life the surplus may be stored in the
shape of wealth. â¢ â¢ â¢ When surplus
energy has accumulated in such bulk as
to preponderate over productive energy, it be
comes the controlling social force. * * â¢
Thenceforward capital is autocratic. â¢ â¢ â¢
In this last stage of consolidation the eco
nomic and perhaps the scientific intellect is
propagated while the imagination lades and
the emotional, the martial and the artistic
types of manhood decay. â¢ â¢ â¦ As the social
movement of a race is acceWated more of its
energetic material is consumed, and ultimately
societies appear to attain a velocity at which
they are unable to make good the waste.
â¢ â¢ â¢ When a highly centralized society dis
integrates under the pressure of economic
competition it is because the energy of the
race has been exhausted. Consequently the
survivors of such a race lack the power neces
sary for renewed concentration and must prob
ably remain inert until supplied with fresh en
ergetic material by tae infusion of barbarian
blood."
MR. TTBAWtEY'S APOTHEOSIS.
"The Apotheosis of ifr. Tyrawley" is a
novel by E. Livingstone Prescott, which
shows how a little of love's sunshine
thrown upon a career that has grown ac
customed to shadow alone, sometimes
works a noble redemption. Tyrawley's
young association was with a rapid set.
He eschewed honest toil or endeavor, ana
threw good years away solely on "cards,
billiards and their concomitants." Like

Bonaparte may be said to have known
something of all languages and dialects;
of very many his knowlÂ«dge was truly
profound. The more difficult the language,
the more eager he was to master it â and
almost always successfully. He possessed
books in the monosyllabic languages of
China and Thibet; the â¢ asgltitinative
languages in his library, divided into
twelve section?, range from Finno-Tataric
to Basque and the various groups of
aboriginal America; while of the inflec
tional, primarily divided into three sec
tions â Semitic, Hamitic and Aryanâ his
selection is. for all practical purposes,
complete. The library is rich in books of
the greatest rarity; many, indeed, are
entirely unknown even to recent biog
raphers. .
THE X JEWEL.
Romances of love and adventure, inter
mixed with historic incidents and written
| in a style sufficiently quaint to suggest
bygone centuries without interfering with
easy reading, have become common, and
yet so great seems to be the popular de
mand for them that the supply is continu
ally increasing. Under these circum
stances it is pleasant to be able to add
that among the contributors to the supply
are a number of new writers who show
considerable talent and manifest a genuine I
ambition to do something of more note
than to make a novel for a season only.
If among these new aspirants for fame
there am none who come near enough to
the work of Stevenson to be counted as
rivals, or even as successors to that great
master of English romance in our own
day, there are nevertheless quite a number
whose stories have "thrills" in them and
are well worth the reading. Among these
may now be included the Hon. Frederick
Moncrieff, whose romance, "The X Jewel,"
in spite of a few grave defects and some
weaknesses of invention and narrative, has
no inconsiderable strength and interest.
There are passages in it, moreover, of such
excellence as to give promise of much
greater things to come from the same au
thor.
The story narrates the adventures of a
young soldier of fortune in Scotland dur
ing the troubled times of the youth of
James VI. Ttie plot involves the loss of
an extraordinary jewel presented to the
young King by Philip of Spain. Although
the existence of the jewel had been kept
carefully concealed by James, a report of
it circulates through the kingdom, and it
is believed the jewel was given to the
King to bind him to the church of Home
and to Spain. When the jewel is missed,
therefore, the King is in great distress lest
it should fall into the hands of an enemy
who would U3e it to raise the fanatical
Protestant spirit of the time against him.
The quest of such a jewel in those stormy
days affords a good theme on which to
string a multitude of adventures, and in
the early part of the story the author man
ages these with no little skill of construction
and vigor of narrative. .' Toward the close,
however, the story weakens, â  and finally
comes to an abrupt and forced conclusion.
The romance is J not worked out and the
mystery not explained. The unsatisfac
tory ending mars the effect of the work as
a whole, and what might have been a good
romance is reduced pretty nearly to the
level of a second-rate mystery story, beine
redeemed, however, by several 'well
worked-up situations and spirited inci
dents. [New York: Harper & Bros. For

AUTHENTICITY OF THE NEW TES
TAMENT.
A volume of especial importance to the
religious world is ."The Critical Handbook
of the Greek New Testament, 1 by Edward
C. Mitchell, : D.D., president: of Leland
University, New Orleans. A new and en
larged edition, illustrated by diagrams,
tables and a map, has been published by
Harper & Brothers. The first edition was
printed some teen years atro. The plan
of the book embraces a view of the pres
ent field of controversy on the subject of
the authenticity of the New Testament
Scriptures as regarded from a geographical
and historical standpoint, in the presenta
tion of which a leading object has been to
familiarize the mind with the periods and
the persons most frequently referred to in
the after-work of textual criticism. In the
resume of textual criticism the author
says he has taken care to combine brevity
with the greatest possible^accuracy of
statement. In the new edition the only
change in the general plan has been the
addition of a table of American manu
scripts and a glossary of abbreviations and
I unfamiliar words. "The discoveries of the
last fifteen years," says Dr. Mitchell,
"have more than doubled the known man
uscripts, and much clearer light has been
thrown upon the history and contents of
many of them." The work is dedicated to
those ministers who have been the au
thor's pupils and to all others who like
wise desire to know "the certainty con
cerning the words wherein they have been
instructed." [New York: Harper . &

THREE GRINGOKS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA.
Richard Harding Davis has been so
favorably introduced to the reading public
by his previous works, that his latest book,
"Three Gringoes in Venezuela and Central
America," just issued by Harpers, will
doubtless be greedily absorbed. In this
work he has given the results of a study
(on horseback most of the time) of the
peoples and customs of the American
tropics. His descriptions of the indolent
life of the Honduranians shows that life
to be as near an approach to the condition
of primitive men as one can rind in this
hemisphere. One of the conclusions that
he reaches is that "the Central American
citizen is no more fit for a republican form
of government thun he is for an Arctic ex
pedition, and what he needs is to have a
Crotectorate established over him either
j the United States or another power, it
does not matter which so long as it leaves
the Nicaragua cai.al in our hands."
"Away from the coasts, where there is
fever," Mr. Harding says, "Central
America is a wonderful country, rich and
beautiful, and burdened with plenty, but
its people make it a nuisance and an
affront to other nations, and its parcel of
independent little States with the pomp of
power and none of its dignity are and will
continue to be a constant danger to the
peace which should exist between two
great powers."
The illustrations are a veritable pano
rama of views of Central America from
Belize in British Honduras to Panama,
through Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica, and of La Guayra and Caracas, in
tne much-discussed republic of Venezuela.

A SINGULAR LIFE.
This story, by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps,
deals with the experience of a young
clergyman who, regarded as unsound by
the ecclsiastical council called to install
him in a church, takes up with a humble
life of service in the seaport town to which
he had been called, but in the abandoned
quarter of the town. Here he sets up the
Church of the Love of Christ, for his own
life is an attempt at actually realizing tho
spirit of Christ, and struggles single
handed with the vice, especially the in
temperance, in the midst of which lie
lives. There is no repulsive scene-paint
ing, but the characters of liquor-dealers,
fishermen and plain people are sharply
drawn. The golden thread of romance
which runs through the story is the love
which springs up between the hero and
the daughter of the old professor of divin
ity, a picturesque and brilliant girl. The
heroic struggles of this single-hearted
man in the spirit of absolute devotion and
self-forgetfulness, the stormy experiences
through which he passed and the crown
ing success which toe heavens granted
â all this, told as only Miss Phelps could
tell it, makes. "A Singular Life" a story
of thrilling interest and ol profound sug
gestion. [Boston: Houghton, Mifflin &

noke by Powhatan Bouldiu, consiiting of
new recollections together with unpub
lished letters of Randolph's which present
this strange and interesting character in a
graphic light. Anotner article of popular
character is a sketch of the elder Dumas by
Mrs. Emily Crawford, the Paris corre
spondent,^ which a vivid picture is drawn
of that robust novelist. Entertaining also
is the fiction of the number, includ
ing the fifth part of Mrs. Humphry Ward's
new novel, "Sir George Tressaoy 1 '; the
fourth and concluding part of Hopkinson
Smith's "Tom Grogan, 1 ' and short stories
by Chester Bailey Feruald and Mrs. Bur
ton Harrison. On the more serious and
important side comes, first of all, "Tne
Lin of Napoleon," by Professor Sloane, in
which Napoleon is shown as the "Foun
dation of Honor and Power," establishing
a new feudalism and having visions of
WOTld empire. Another article of a sort
which one is accustomed to look for in the
Century is an account of "Stamping Out
the London Slums," written by Edward
Marshall, secretary of the New York Tene
ment-house Commission, which will be in
the nature of a revelation to Americans,
besides giving suggestions as to the treat
ment of similar problems in our cities.
Another article of importance is William
E. Smythe's "Ways and Means in Arid
America," in which the accomplishments
of irrigation are set forth, with illustra
tions by Mrs. Foote. Harry Fenn and
Orson Lowell. A piece of liigh-ciass litera
ture by Professor Woodrow Wilson of
Princeton is "On an Author's Choice of
Company," while a short essay by Dr.
Allan McLane Hamilton has the novel
title, "The Perils of Small Talk."
In Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly the
"Lee of Virginia" series is continued, with
a picturesque and superbly illustrated
paper devoted t> Major-General Henry
Lee of Revolutionary fame, the "Light
Horse Harry" of his soldier contempora
ries, anil the father of General Robert E.
Lee. Other illustrated articles in the
March Frank Leslie's are: "The New
South," by the Hon. Jc4in Y. Foster; "In
Old Virginia," by Kate Mason Rowland;
"A Winter in Lombardy," by Lena I. Pep
per; "Woman's Work and Ministrations,"
by Alvan S. South worth; "The Memory
of Robert Burns," by Margaret E. Leicester
Addis; "Society Plays Golf," by Diana
Crosaways. and "A Winter Vagary," by
William Potts of "Underledge." Among
the contributors of fiction and poetry are
Anna Katharine Green, Cleveland Moffett,

In Harper's Magazine the special fea
tures for the current month are: "On
Snowshoes to tbe Barren Ground," by
Caspar W. Whitney; "Arcadian Bee
Ranching," by Ninetta Eames; "Colonel
Washington, " by Woodrow Wilson ; "The
German Struggle for Liberty," by Poult
ney Bigelow; "The Nerves of a Warship,"

number includes installments of William
Black's "Briseis" and the "Personal Recol
lections of Joan of Arc"; Owen Wister
contributes a humorous taJe ot Wyoming
life, called "Where Fancy Was Bred";
Julian Ralph is the author of a story of
Chinese life, "The 'Boss' of Ling-Foo,"

Dudley Warner, in the "Editor's Study,"
pictures "A Dream Republic," and dis
cusses "The Strong Story," and the "Edit
or's Drawer" contains a variety of humor
ous anecdotes, verses and pictures.
Tbe leading article in this month's Fo
rum is contributed by the eminent French
novelist and critic, Tb. Bentzon (Mme.
Blanc). Mrae. Blanc contrasts "Family
Life in America" with family life in
FRANK L. STANTON, GEORGIA'S POET LAUREATE.
[From a recent photograph.]
France, frankly criticizing certain phases
of American home life. Mme. Blanc de
clares, however, that with certain reserva
tions which she mentions in her article
she shall be delighted to see French so
ciety become more and more American
ized, and that in her opinion the type of
the American family is very likely the one
that will at last prevail â a profoundly in
teresting article. The Forum also con
tains a striking paper by Joseph Nimmo
Jr. entitled "The Nicaragua Canal an Im
practicable Scheme." Mr. Nimmo con
tends in his article that from a commercial
point of view the Nicaragua canal is im
practicable, and he declares the scheme to
be one of the flimsiest chimeras that has
ever gained human credence.
In McClure's Magazine is brought to
light a speech of 1837 by Abraham Lin
coln, which the biographers until now,
seemingly, have known nothing of, though
it contains passages still of the highest in
terest. For example, of politicians Lin
coln says: "A set of men who have inter
ests aside from the interest of the people,
and who, to say the most of them, are
taken as a mass, at least one long step
removed from honest men. I say this
with the greater freedom because, beingfa
politician myself, none can regard it as
personal." There are also an amusingly
judicious love proposal of Lincoln's and
some lively reminiscences of him as the
leader in a successful maneuver to estab
lish the State capital at Springfield and as
a young lawyer in that smart new town.
The pictures are numerous and include
four portraits of Lincoln. Among the
contributors to McClure's this month are
Colonel John Hay, Rudynrd Kipling, Rob
ert Ban 1 , Cleve and Moffett, Wilt H. Law
and Elizabeth Stuart Plielps. There are
poems by the late Eugene Field and the
late Robert Louis Stevenson.
Californians will be pleased to read the
verses concerning this State by Garrett
Newkirk in the March number of St.
Nicholas. In making an imaginary tour
of all tne States of the Union the poet cnes:
Hurrah ! We've readied the "Golden Gate,"
California's ioy and pride;
Where all the ships of all the world
At once, may saiely rule.
Ilere Pan Frnrtrisco on her hills
Sits i roudly by the sea.
While ships from China and Japan
Cast anchor at her <juay.
This is a land of fruits and flovven,
A land of Rolden grain;
Where winters oftOD are as kind
As summers areiu Maine.
The warm Pacific waters lave
A thousand miIPS of shore,
And California every year
Still prospers more and more.

article, "Carnations," by J. H. Connelly,
which is illustrated from nature by Harry
Fenn, while William Walton contributes
an appreciative sketch of Miss Mary Cas
satt, illustrated by reproductions of some
of her paintings and pastels. The regular
departments. "The Point of View," "The
Field of Art" and "About the World," are
as interesting as ever.

The
Theatres
THE penitential season of Lent has
not caused tne patronage to lan
guish at the local theaters. At
the Baldwin Frederick Warde
has ranted in the most approved
and old-fashioned melodrainntic style, and
the more he has awoke the slumbering
echoes the more his admirers have ap
plauded. The Carlton Opera Company
has been reaping the reward of merit in
the shape of attendance and applause, and
Moroscos gorgeous scenic effects have pro
duced the same happy result. At the
other local theaters no wail of lamenta
tion has been heard from the box-oihees,
and as .for' the Paderewski and Sousa con
certs the size of the audiences was only
limited by the fact that there were noteven
holes and corners left in which to stow
away more people.
In plays adapted from the French, where
the word "Madame" has been retained in
the English version, it seems to have be-
FERRIS lIARTMAN AS KIP VAN WINKLE.
come the accepted thing to pronounce the
word with a strong accent on the final
syllable. In "The Mountebank" this ten
dency is pushed to an extreme by some
members of the Warde company. The
actors eviaently labor under the delusion
that it is quite French, whereas in fact the
"Macf(iÂ»r is not only a provincialism but
is painfully suggestive of swearing.
Duse is again the sensation of the hour
in New York, and one cannot help regret
ting that she is not for the San Francisco
market. The worst of it is that the great
tragedienne is failing in health and may
never revisit America. She is sick, too,
with the glamor and artificiality of stage
life and longs to retire in the very zenith
of her fame. The loss will be ours if we
have not the enterprise to secure a visit
from the great fin de siecle actress. Those
who have never heard Duse no not know
what they are missing, but the people who
have felt her spell regret that she is not
comine where her genius would be sure to
be appreciated.
"Did Shakespeare ever go to Elsinore?"
EUGENE CANFIELD IN "A RAILROAD TICKET" COMPANY.
This is the latest conundrum among stu
dents of Shakespenrina. Dr. Jon Stef
ansson started the ciuestion in an article
that appeared in an English magazine,
and before the Eliza%t-han Society in Lon
don the other day Dr. Jon held forth at
considerable length and with a powerful
accent to show that Shakespeare visited
Denmark. To prove his case the doctor
put in a series of dates booked in and
around Ebir.ore by several companies of
English players, especially by the com
pany headed by Will Kempe. Kempe was
quite the Ferris Hartman of the period for
"gagging," and it was (according to Stef
ansson) against Kempe that the bard di
rected his remarKs against clowns speak
ing more than is set down for them.
Dr. Jon Stefansson believes that young
Shakespeare played small parts on
Kempe's Danish tours. He does not ap
pear to be able to adauce much evidence
in support of his theory, but the idea is
more interesting than many of the whims
put forward by would-be Shakespearian
authorities.
Baldwin Theater.
The production of "King Lear" by
Frederick Warde and his company is an
nounced for to-morrow evening at the
Baldwin Theater. It is eleven years since
this tragedy has been revived 6y an Amer
ican actor, and its presentation will no
doubt arouse considerable interest.
Warde has been meeting with consider
able success in his Shakespearean revivals.
He has never believed, as Borne managers
have asserted, that to produce Shake
speare meant loss at the box-office; on the
contrary, he has attributed a certain lack
of patronage from which some revivals
have suffered to lack of attention in meet
ing modern stage requirements.
In "King Lear" it is stated that Fred
erick Warde will surround his production
with efficient and careful staging.
"King Lear" will be given on Monday,
Thursday and Friday evenings and at the
matinee Saturday; "Damon and Pythias"
on Tuesday, and "Julius Caesar" Wednes
day and Saturday evenings.
"A Milk-White Flag," one of the latest
TflE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
Hoyt productions, will be given at the
Baldwin Theater Monday week.
Paderevrski'a Farewell.
The great Paderewski-Marsick concert
will take place at the Baldwin Theater to
night. It will "be positively the pianist's
last appearance, as he will cross the bay to
his private car immediately on the con
clusion of the performance.
The following programme will be ren
dered : .

California Theater.
With the exception of the Marsick con
cert on Friday night,, the California
Theater will be closed this week. The
next attraction is Milton Royle, who will
present his latest' success, entitled
"Mexico." This attraction will be fol
lowed in rapid succession by Peter Daley
in "The Night Clerk," Roland Reed, Prim
rose & West's minstrels and Robert Man
tell.
California Theater Concert.
Arrangements have been completed for
the appearance of Marsick at the Califor
nia. Tneater on Friday night, March 6, for
one recital. He has arranged' a brilliant
programme, and as his appearance to
night at the Baldwin Theater with Pader
ewski will familiarize the San Francisco
public with Marsick's violin virtuosity,
his concert on Friday night will no doubt
arouse considerable public interest.
Columbia Theater. -
"A Railroad Ticket" will begin a week's
engagement at the Columbia Theater to
morrow night. The play is a satire on the
railroad ticket brokerage business, and is
also intended to ridicule the modern haste
to grow rich.
The role of Chips, the ambitions office
boy, will be played by Eugene Canfield,
who is well known in connection with his
successes in Hoy t's comedies. Charles E.
Grapewin will appear as Robert Ticket. J.
H. F. Clasher, the Rain King, who has
nothing but real estate, will fall to the
hands of J. H. Bradbury, a comedian
known from his previous appearance here
in support of Nellie McHenry. Harry
Porter, an actor formerly in the support of
Frank Daniels, will appear in the dual
roles of Tammany Hall and Lithograph
Bill. The comedy role of the Collector
will be assumed by Frank Gardiner. The
feminine contingent will include Mattie
Lockette as Bessie. Shorthand, the type
writer; Beatrice Norman as Mrs. J. H. F.
Clasher, Hattie Waters as Isabelle Inger
soll, and a bevy of beauties in the minor
roles. The specialty portion of the enter
tainment will, it is said, include a number
of novel features.
At the Columbia To-Day.
A grand benefit will be tendered the
Theatrical Mechanics' Association this
afternoon at the California Theater. A
long bill of attractions is promised, the
names comprised presenting a brilliant
array of talent. Doors will be open at 1
o'clock, the performance to begin promptly
at 2 o'clock.
Grand Opera-House.
Manager Morosco will this week again
take advantage of his big stage and its
equipments to produce a melodrama, the
essential feature of which is the spectacu
lar. The play to be produced is by Louis
Eagan, and it bears the sensational title,
"A Midnight Flood."
While the story of Eagan's play is said
to be deficient in any startling originality
there is plenty of human interest running
through it, with a judicious intermingling
of comedy and pathos. The main feature,
however, is undoubtedly the title scene.
It will be an exact reproduction of a pic
ture taken at Johnstown the morning
after the bursting of the dam on the
memorable night in 1889.
Essie Tittell and Darrell Vinton will
reappear in the leading roles and the com
pany will be supported by Gilbert and
Goldie, who have been especially engaged
for their latest specialties.
Grover's Alcazar.
- The Carlton Opera Company will pre
sent Auber's romantic opera "Fra Dia
volo" at Grover's Alcazar to-morrow, Tues
day and Wednesday evenings. For the
rest of the week, including the Saturday
and Sunday matinees, "The Bohemian
Girl" will be performed. W. T. Carlton,
Miss Rena Atkinson and the rest of the
star cast will be seen at every performance.
Tivoli Opera-House.
Robert Planquette's opera, "Rip ."Van
Winkle," will be sung at the Tivoli Opera
house to-morrow night. The plot of the
opera adheres closely to Washington Ir.
ving's story and is one of considerable in
terest. The action is supposed to take
place in the villace of Sleepy Hollow be
fore and after the Revolutionary War.
Ferris Hartman will play his role of the
pood-hearted vagabond ; Carrie Roma will
reappear after an absence of two years as
his wife retch sn; Pearl Landers will be
the Meenie of the first i part and Annabel
Schnabel the Meenie of the last act. John
J. Raffael will sing Detrick, W. H. West
Peter Stein and Kate March i Katrina.
Little Gertie : Carlisle will be the , Little
Hans and Martin Pache his grownup coun
terpart. Thomas C. Leary will character
ize Nick Fedder, the landlord of the Royal
George 111 Inn, and the son ; Jan the pro
prietor of the Washington Arms. . Special
care will be taken with the staging, espe
! cially in the incantation scene in tne sec
ond act.
Balfe's opera, "The Rose of Castile,"
will follow, after which "Said Pasha,"
Richard Stahl's opera, will be given. To
morrow evening the : musical directorship
of the Tivoli will be assumed by Carl Mar
tens, late of the Tavary Opera Company,
under whose baton a season of grand opera
will shortly be sung. :
â  At the Orpheum.
Eight new people are . promised by the
Orpheum management to appear to-mor
row evening. Wills and Collins, travesty
sketch artists, will present the original
skit on "Pygmalion and Galatea," while

The Pantzers, the Wiltons, the Rossleys
and the Brothers Diaiita are retained.
Carroll Johnson and Billy Carter, who
have been favorites during their stay, wilt
leave for Los Angeles this afternoon after
the matinee.
New Auditorium.
The University of California Glee and
Mandolin clubs will give a concert at the
Auditorium on Eddy street to-morrow
evening. The Glee Club is already well
known, but this will be the first appear
ance of the Mandolin Club, which was
organized at the university last au tnmn.
The clubs will be assisted by Mrs. Olive
Reed Batchelder, contralto, and Charles
E. Parcells, violinist. Souvenir pro
grammes have been prepared, designed
by Mr. Quinan of the Josh. The concert
is under the patronage of a number of
prominent ladies and gentlemen.
Annie Eva Fa}', a â¢disciple of Mme.
Blavatsky, will appear at the Auditorium
on Tuesday night. The lady, who has
been studying the occult sciences for
twenty years, is said to have penetrated
far into the mysteries of India. Her en
tertainment is a pleasant mixture of the
tricks of fakirs and the science of the
learned mahatmas. She professes to have
complete control over her astral body,
even to the extent of making it visible to
the corporal eyes of the audience.
Pearl Noble Testimonial.
Miss Pearl Noble, the well-known cor
netist, is to be tendered a testimonial con
cert, on Tuesday evening, at the Linder
man Opera-house, Alameda. The enter
tainment is under the patronage of the
Woman's Exchange of Alameda and the
local churches, for most of whom Miss
Noble has done considerable musical work
in the paÂ«t.
A number of well-known performers will
give their services on the occasion. The
ladies' string quartet, consisting of Miss
Gruenhagen, Miss Mubel Crabtree, Miss
May Barrinston and Miss Anne Barring- j
ton, will play. Among the other execu
tants will be Arthur F. Johanimen, Samuel
Adelstein, Leo Cooper. Gertrnde Judd, E.
D. Crandall, Miss Lillian Featherstone
and the Misses Pearl and Maud Noble.
Macdonough Theater.
A. M. Palmer's "Trilby" Company will
appear at the Macdonough Theater, Oak
land, next Wednesday afternoon and even
ing. The organization is en route to Aus
tralia, and the haste to get through to
fulfill engagements accounts for the fact
that Oakland is to have an attraction not
enjoyed by San Francisco.
The personnel of the company is the
same, with few exceptions, as last season.
Nellie McHenry will open in "The
GILBERT AND GOLDIE AT MOKOSCO'S 1.H.1M) OPfcKA HOLSfc.
Cycle Girl" at the Macdonough on the 6th
inst.
Dramatic Brevities.
Miss Affie Warner will appear in the
production of "A Milk White Flag" at the
Baldwin.
James O'Neill's version of "The Lyons
Mail" will be produced by him during his
coming engagement at the Baldwin.
Seymour Hicks recently delivered an ad
dress on "Burlesque" before the Play
goers' Club. In it he gave Beerbohm Tree
some very sharp raps.
"Trilby" is really to be done in Paris,
"Trilby" in French! What becomes of
the English jargon of the student quarter,
what of Zou-Zou's English?
Washington went wild over Dnse and it
looks as if this American tour was going
to be something like the triumphal pro
gresses which foreign actors used to make
here twenty years ago.
M. Claretie of the Comedie Francaise
has followed the custom of the English

Opera in New York.
New York is complaining bitterly that
Boston has interfered in a rude, impolitic
manner with its opera plans for next sea-
son. The cause of the trouble is that
Melba's Boston admirers have offered to
give her an especial opera company, $2000
a night and a percentage if she will sing
exclusively for" them. Speaking of this
sentimental offer, the Press remarks:
Armed with this document the diva
now demands $-'000 a night from Abbey &
Grau.
That is bad but worse remains
behind. The moment Calve beard about
the rival soprano's proposition she jumped
into her carriage, drove to the Metropoli
tan, entered Abbey <fc Grau's office and
said: "Bon jour, M. Abbayy." "Bon
jour, Madame," said he. "You want me
again, come back?" said she. "I had
hopes in that way," said he. 'Tres bien,"
said she. "I come back. But for more of
the moneys." "Pardon me," said he, "1
did not quite understand." "I come
back," she repeated, slowly, "but more
moneys next year." "Why, Madam,"
said he, "you are receiving a very large
salary now." "It is the mere nothings,"
said sne. "Voila! Observe the publeeK,
the house I bringâ ten, twenty, fifty thou
sand dollaire. It is nothings."
"But, Mme. Calve,' 1 said he, "it is dou
ble what you receive in Europe. "Mon
Dieu!" saidshe, "what of that! I am re
move, torn from my chateau, from the
beautiful Paris. I come in the ocean
three, five thousand miles. I have the
maldemer, the sea sick. Voila! I am
dead. I come where they do not Know the
language civilized. I have the climate, the
weather, the coldâ one day hot, one day
theâ what you call itâ blizzare. 1 have
the bill of the doctaire. Alon Dieu! it is
nothings. Behold, I come back in the
ocean, the sea sickâ but I must have the
moneysâ must have the 12,000 franca
night." "Whew!" said he, "$2400 a per
formance." 'Why not?" said she. "Mnie.
Melba demand 12,000 francs. Voila! can
shft be the Carmenâ the ten, fifty thousand
dollaire house? Is Calve to be put below
Melba? Impossible. Bon jour, Monsieur."
"Bon jour, Madame," said heâ and there
the matter rests.
Now, all this nonsense was brought
about by Boston. We say nonsense ad
visedly. No impresario in the world could
afford to pay $2400 a night for Meiba. Of
course, the capitalists of the Hub, who are
enamored of her charms, may come to
these terms, but their proposition is senti
mental, not business. Our managers dou
ble the prices of Europe. They can afford
to do no more. If Melba and Caive insist
on these exorbitant salaries the end of the
matter wid be that we shall have to do
without Melba and Calve.
ISSUED FAULTY STAMPS
A Defective Plate Has Caused
the Government Much
Trouble.
How a Postoffice Clerk Outwitted a
Philatetist Who Wished to
Purchase.
Through the blunder of a Government
engraver the United States has been
flooded with hundreds of thousands of
defective postage stamps of the new 2-cent
issue, the Postotlice Department has been
compelled to destroy a plate that cost it
$40,000, and stamp collectors and dealers
who were fortunate enough to learn of the
matter before it came to the eyes and ear s>
of the authorities have reaped a rich har
vest. Stamps tliat were worth '1 cents as
their face value before the mistake was
discovered are now held at ten times that
amount, and the price will enhance as they
Brow older and are scattered through the
thousands of collections in the country,
thus becoming one of the rarities in which
the philatelic enthusiast delights.
For many years the Government let out
the contract for printing stamps to the
American Bank Note Company, and this
corporation was responsible for the abso
lute accuracy of the precious bits of paper
that pay the way of the correspondence of
the country. Recently, however, the Fed
eral authorities decided to do the work,
and a vast engraving and printing plant,
with an army of employes, was estab
lished at Washington. One of the men in
the engravers' department is responsible
for all the trouble, which involves the call
ing in of hundreds of thousands'of stamps.
A few months ago it became known to
the Stamp Bureau that the 2 cent stamps
then beinjj issued were being counterfeited
to a large extent and it was decided to
make a new issue containing secret marks
that would render identification of the
spurious stamps easy. Orders were given
for new plates that would remedy the mat
ter and the most expert engravers in the
department were put at work on them. In
addition to the water mark the stamps
show a faint line of perforations on the
gummed side that is not apparent to the
layman, but to the philatelist is very
plain.
Each plate is intended to print 400 per
fect stamps and each plate is numbered,
the number showing on the margin of tne
printed sheet, so that in case of a mistake,
such as the one in question, the depart
ment can tell just which stamps to recall.
The new issue had hardly made its ap
pearance and had not yet reached th.is
coast when philatelists discovered that two
rows of stamps on the lefthand side of
plate 170 were defective. The first row was
entirely correct, but rows two and three,
extending from the top of the sheet to the
bottom and containing an -aggregate of
forty stamps, were faulty.
In each of the upper corners of the cor
rectly executed stamps appears a double
triangle, one within the other. The space
within the inside triangle is closely filled
with line horizontal lines, as is the body of
tne stamp, while the narrow space between
the heavy lines of the triangles shows
clearly white.
In the first defective row the inside tri
angle is missing and the fine red lines are
unbroken, while in the second imperfect
row the two triangles are present, but the
white space that should be between does
not appear, the fine red lines running en
tirely across. These imperfections would
not be apparent to an inexperienced eye,
but to the expert are glaring defects, and
to the Government they are practically
unpardonable, and the engraver who made
the blunders will probably soon be looking
for another position, if he is not already
doing so.
Stamp-dealers obtained possession of
thousands of specimens before the defects
were made known to the Government, and
the collectors of this City made a desper
ate effort to do so, but the information of
the imperfections reached here ahead of
the stamps, and very few went into circu
lation.
One collector struck the trail of a quan
tity that had reached a sub-office in the
southern part of the City, and attempted
to buy them, but the clerk was posted, and
quietly informed the philatelist that he
could have them if he was willine to pay a
handsome premium. As such transac
tions are clearly prohibited by the regula
tions of the Postoince Department, the
young man was running considerable risk
of losing his position, but there is honor,
sometimes, even among philatelists, and
he was not reported, tlte collector taking
the matter as rather a good joke that he
should have been outwitted.
The stamps that have not already passed
into the possession of collectors and deal
ers have already been recalled by the de
partment.
Killed Himself by Morphine.
Hugh Kennedy, bricklayer, 33 years of ac<\
was taken to the Receiving Hospital at 3:25
o clock yesterday morning suffering from mor
phine poiseninp. Ho died at noon yesterday
and the body was removed to the Morgue.
Kennedy had been rooming at 511 Pine street.
He had been despondent on account of being
out of work. That was his reason for taking
the dose of morphine.
THE RAILROAD TO BLAME
Mission Street Line Ãesponsible
for the Death of Mrs.
Witbeck.
THE C AE HAD NO FBNDBBU
Verdict of the Coroner's Jury After
Hearing the Testimony of
Eye Witnesses, :
The Coroner's jury yesterday held the
street railroad responsible for the death of ,?
Mrs. Witbeck. who was run ove? by an
electric car a few days ago and died from
the effects of her injuries. The deceased
was 73 years of age.
An effort was made to prove that Mys.
Witbeck was bard of hearing. Dr. Dozier
said be had to speak a little louder than
usual to her, but he stated that her eye
sight was as good as could be expected of
a woman of 73 years.
C. W. Witbecc testified thai his .mother
was in the habit of going out to hi 3 bouse
at the Mission every Sunday lor the last
seven years, and that he had nevex noticed
her hearing to be Impaired in the least.
She always went back and forth unat
tended.
J. M. James, a police officer, saw the
lady leave the corner of the street and
walk in front of the car. The motorman
rang his gong and continued to ring ie
until the car struck her and she was
knocked down. She did not appear to
hear the bell. Witness did not notice any
effort on the part of the motorman to stob
the car.
C. W. Witbeck said he never had any
trouble in making his mother hear him
when he spoke to her.
Kmelie A. Wanz testified that she wit
nessed the accident and thought that the
motorman had done all in his power to
stop the car.
David Morrison testified that he saw the
lady cross the street and saw the car knock
her down.
William Barnum, who way motorman of
the car going in the opposite direction,
saw the deceased step on the track about
ten feet in front of the car that struck her.
He testified that the only guard on the car
was the board in front ofthe wheels, which
were back under the car.
H. L. Howard, the motorman on the
Missioii'Street car that struck Mrs. Wit
beck, said that the woman was about four
teen feet in front of the car when, be first
saw her. He ranc the bell and made an
effort to stop the car in time to prevent thia
accident. He said the car was without a
fender. - : ..
CONVICTED BUT FREE.
Kern Kenny Can Laugh at Sentences
and Prison "Walls.
Kern Kenny is a lucky man. He is con*
victed of obtaining money under false
pretenses and has been sentenced to eight
years in prison, but he is at large and thera
seems to be no immediate prospect of his
incarceration.
When Kenny was convicted his attorney
pave notice of appeal and filed a bill of
exceptions. This bill has to be settled,
but it is gone and no one knows anything
arxmt it. In the meantime a writ. of prob
able cause r'as been granted, and ior nearly
two years Kenny has been out on bail, and
he is as far from the -'penitentiary as he
ever was. He has complied with all the
preliminary formalities of an appeal, so
the appeal cannot be dismissed on a mo
tion by the people. The only way which
appears at all feasible is tr> have the writ
of probable cause revoked.
HABERLIN WAS CLUBBED.
Bernard and Bridget Kennedy Wanted
for the Assault.
Patrick Haberlin swore out a warrant in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday for
the arrest of Bernard and Bridget Ken
nedy, husband and wife, on the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
The parties live on Seventh avenue, be
tween M and X streets, South San Fran
cisco. On November 28 several boys were
amusing themselves by throwing stones
and Haberlin interfered. Kennedy got
hold of him. and kept his arms pinioned
while his wife Bridget belabored him with
a club. Haberlin has been confined to his
bed ever since, and yesterday he was able
to get out and swear out the warrant.

POINT BONITA
LIGHT HOUSE.
POINT BONITA is a sharp pro
jection of the North Head of the
Golden Gate. It is a rugged and
barren cliff that rises abruptly
from a whirlpool of waves ever
dashing over hundreds of jagged and haif
submergt-d rocks. It has always been
recognized as a dangerous place for ves
sels, and waa one of the first points on the
Captain Brown. Who Has Been Light-
Keeper for Nearly a Quarter of a
Century.
: [From a photograph.] â 
Pacific Coast that the United States Gov
ernment equipped as a lighthouse. That
v.as in 1894, and since then improvements
have been made as. the station grew in im
] ortance with increasing traffic.
It is a littie more than qve miles in a
â traight line from the center of San Fran-
DOING DUTY AS LIFE-SAVERS.
Cisco to Point iionita lighthouse, and yet
the people living there are almost out of
the world. Sausalito is the . post office ad
dress of the lighthouse, and from there a
good road over the bills about tive miles
must be traveled fo reach it. But it is
â worth the effort, for there is not a more in
teresting li-hthouse to be found anywhere.
The engineers who put up the first liuht
house in 1854 were evidently men not ac
quainted with the atmospheric conditions
of the Pacilic Coast, for they built it on
the highest point of the cliff they could
fina. where the first clouds of fog wouid
obscure it. Their work is stili standing in
the shape of a massive stone tower sixty
feet higA, tiie top of which is 3b4 feet
above high tide. It i* a graceful
structure, but of no use now except as a
landmark. It is very valuable for this..
as it can be seen on a clear day twenty
miles at sea. For many years after the
:ht was established it was a question
whether ie would be lighted or not. me
keepers paid little attention td their busi
ness, and oiten times, it is said, the lamp
was lifted by some rancher while they
were absent. . . ,
But after -the excitement of the war had
subsided the Government was more strict
in regard to such matters. Appropria
tions were made for improving the light
house service, and practical men were em
ployed to investigate and report on what
was needed. As Point Bonita required a
large sum of money to put it in first-class
condition, no changes, except minor ones,
re made until 1877, but the work then
dene wae properly finished and is still
standing in perfect condition.
Before the changes were made the sta
tion had only two buildingsâ the light
house and a building for the keepers. Now
there are six, painted a pure white and
kept in the most perfect order. The most
important building is the lighthouse
proper. It is constructed on a pro
jection of rock 120 feet above high
tide. It can be seen from any direction
except the northeast. The building
itself is just high enough to make the lamp
I>4 feet above sea level. The lampistlie
regulation Funk pattern and was made in
1880. It has three circular wicks, burns
mineral oil and is supposed to produce 164
candle power. The lantern is the same as
was used on the old lighthouse. The
lenses were made in France in 1552 and in
crease the candle power of the lamp to
5500.
Point Bonita ligiit is the only second
class light on the coast. It is what is
known as a '"fixed white" and on clear
nights is visible to a vessel as soon as it
gets over the horizon. Any craft entering
the harbor is in the middle of live lights.
Faiallon, out at sea, flashes once a min
ute : Point Reyes to the north flashes every
rive seconds; Pigeon Point, to the s-outh,
flashes every ten secon ls; Fort Point is a
steady white light with four red flashes,
while Alcatraz can be faintly seen far in
land.
The improvements at Point Eonita in
cluded a steam fop-horn station, all ma
chinery being built in duplicate to guard
again-t a breakdown. Steam is Kept in the
boilers all the time, so that everything is
in readiness for a fog, which is liable
to come up at any moment. The horns
are blown by small steam engines. On
the eastern side of the point there is an
incline tramway that leads down to a
wharf where all suppiies are landed. The
water at the base of the rock, is deep
enough for a large schooner to land in
Stfety. The tramcar is operated by a
steei cable that is run by a steam engine,
and can haul up over a ton of coal at a
load.
When the light was moved from the
hither to the lowerposition a most difficult
task confronted the engineers in shape of
a cliff nearly 100 feet high that lay be
tween two points. There was no room on
the lower rock for tne keepers' houses so it
was necessary to leave them where they
were and make communication easy be
tween and the new lighthouse. A steel
bridge was first built around the outside
of the cliff overhanging the ocean, but it
proved so daneer.ius it had to be aban
doned. The difficulty was overcome by
cutting a tunnel t'nrnnsh th f c ff "o that
it is now easy and safe for th:* iigi tkeepers
to go between toe :.- ation and their homes
at all Lours.
For the last twenty-four years Point Bo
nita lighthousa has been in charge of Cap
tain J. B. Brown. He was on duty when
the chancre was made from the old to the
new quarters and sat .up at nights to keep
Old Lighthouse Built in 1854.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
the large oil lamp alight while the lanterns
were being changed. Captain Brown
never missed a night in the lighthouse un
til a few months ago, when he was sick
with an attack of la grippe. In addition
to his duties as lightkeeper, Captain
tfrown has done considerable work as a
ine-saver. Wrecks of vessels have strewn
the coast in all directions as far as one can
see wnen standing in the lighthouse.
It was over there the Costa Rica went
ashore, said the captain, pointing to the
left, "and right down there the tue Rescue
went aground. Over there the ship Eliza
beth went to pieces; there is where the
schooner PetsanK; on that rock over there
the iSew York struck, and near the same
place the Whitelaw went down."
During the twenty-four years the captain
estimates that he ahd his" men have saved
over eighty people that would have per
ished Diit for their timely assistance. They
have taken several hundred off vessels
that simply "grounded" when the seawas
smooth. On one stormy night a man was
heard crying for help at the base of the
chft beneath the old lighthouse. Captain
Brown could not see him. but he climbed
down 300 feet on a rope and found the
man, almost dead, in a deep pool, some
what sheltered from the breakers. Both
were hauled to the top with difficulty.
The greatest number of men have been
saved from fishing vessels that got into
the "bit of nasty water" just beneath the
cliff. The lighthouse has a good compart
ment boat that will ;stand pretty rough
water, and the men are ready at all times
to lend aid to those in danger.
The residences of the keepers are large
comfortable buildings, standing in shel
tered positions on the eastern slope of the
cliff. Mrs. Brovn, the captain's wife, has
been to great pains and succeeded in grow
ing an extensive garden of flowers and
yegatables that form a bright spot of color
in the barren surroundings.
The lightUouse tract of land consists of
forty-eight acres adjoining the Lime Point
government reservation. That portion of
it north of tne lighthouse is very good soil,
and several springs of pure water flow from
tbe hillsides. It affords pasturage for sev
eral horses and cows belonging to the
lighthouse, Dut the ground is not of such a
character as to be cultivated with profit.
On account of Us isolated position few
people visit Point Bonita lighthouse. Some
days there will be fifteen or twenty visitors,
and at other times the keepers will not see
a straimer for weeks.
RATES STILL UNSETTLED
The Railroad Tariff to Follow
That via the Isthmus
Route.
Another Victory for the Panama
Railroad Companyâ More Fric
tion in Prospect.
Although the Paciric Mail Steamship
Company has been forced to comply with
the demand of the Panama Railroad Com
pany to reduce the rates from 60 cents per
100 pounds to 40 cents on east-bound busi
ness, all possibility of serious trouble be
tween the two corporations named has not
been removed.
The new rates on the Panama route go
into effect on the Bth inst. They make
such a difference between the all-rail or
overland route ihat it is very unlikely the
transcontinental roads will stand idly
by and allow business to leave their roads
to take advantage of the much cheaper
rates via the isthmus.
When the new Panama rale goes into ef
fect it will mean a difference of $7 per ton
to ail who snip through freisht eastward.
The railroad rate is 75 cents per 100 pounds
and the steamship rate will be $8. The ex
isting differential is but $3 per ton.
But in his demand for a 40-cent rate
President Simmons of the Panama Com
pany went further than to ask merely for
such a reduction. He insisted that in case
of any reduction by the transcontinental
railroads, a proportionate reduction should
be made by the Isthmus combination.
The Southern Pacific Company, control
ling the only overland roads out|of this
City, naturally have the greatest influence
in rate-making for eastbound business,
and it will have to take the initiative in
any reductions that may be contemplated.
It was learned from one of the officials
connected with the freight department of
the Southern Pacific Company that a re
duction would undoubtedly be made to
meet the cut of the Panama-Pacific Mail
combination, but just when it would be
made he could not tell. General Manager
Stubbs is expected home from the East on
Wednesday, and it is thought that the
matter will then be formally taken up.
Had the 60-cent rate via Panama re
mained in force it was the intention of the
Southern Pacific Company in conjunction
with the other transcontinental lines to
raise rates on other commodities than
those on which an advance was made
shortly after the signing of the latest
Panama-Pacific Mail contract. But this
step of the Panama people has upset all
such calculations.
The Panama people say they are deter
mined to gst their full share of through
freight, and shall insist on such a differ
ential, as experience will snow, as will
give them the business, and that they pro
pose to disregard altogether the interests
of the Southern Pacific Company or any
of the transcontinental lines.
They even go so far as to intimate that
if C. P. Huntington's stalking horse, the
Pacific Mail Company, fails to live fairly
and squarely up to the letter and spirit of
the new contract the agreement will be
abrogated and the Panama Kailroad Com
pany will again play a lone hand on both
the Atlantic and Paciric coasts.
POETS AND AUTHORS.
They Are to Gather in Force at Mil
waukee Next April.
An impending event of contemporary
interest Is the round-up of poets and
authors on March 10 at Milwaukee, under
the auspices of the Milwaukee Ethical So
ciety. Milwaukee has lons been almost as
famous for its poets as (or its beer. Ella
Wheeler, formerly the poetess of passion,
now Mrs. Wilcox, came from there, and
others almost equally famous developed
and remained there and are the 7. basis
through their deliverances of -what has
become widely known as the Milwaukee
School of Poetry, says Harper's Weekly.
If a convention of poets is a good thine
there is no better or worthier place to hoid
it than Milwaukee. - :.
It seems, however, to be fairly question
able whether there is true profit in getting
poets together. As Ion â â < as they are apart
they can use their own volition about
reading or hearing one another's verse,
but brought face to face and grouped in
bunches they cannot very well dodge.
What makes the i prospect more doubtful
is that the poems which are most likely, to
be read are unpublished ones, unsold, and
possibly unsalable, which threaten to
perish. with their beauties unrevealed. All
too '* many of .tneiu are : likely to be long
poems, for of course the marketableness of
every poem is in inverse proportion to its
length. : The' sort of convention which
would seem most likely to give poets com
fort and satisfaction should bs one where
only a limited number of poets would be

A REPLY FROM STANLEY.
Dr. C. B. Hutchins Called the
Explorer to Ac
count.
RECENT ARTICLE REVIEWED.
A Grand Army Comrade Who Would
Take a Whack at John
Bull.
To the January number of the Nineteenth
Century, Henry M. Stanley contributed an
article/entitled "The Issue Between Great
Britain and America." Mr. Stanley had
just returned from a three months' tour on
this continent. He had traveled from Mon
treal to Vancouver, to San Francisco,
New Orleans, and thence to New York.
Everywhere he talked with Americans and
found a universal desire for a brush with
England. In his contribution to the maga
zine he ascribed the cause of American
hostility to the Canadian Pacific Railway
and matrimonial alliances between rich
American girls and titled Englishmen.
The article was read in San Francisco by
Dr. C. B. Hutchins. The doctor, who is a
veteran of the late war and a comrade of
George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., was
fully convinced that Mr. Stanley knew
better than to ascribe the American feel
ing to such trivial causes, and while not
being personally acquainted with the dis
tinguished African explorer, wrote him a
refreshing letter. In this letter he re
minded the member of Parliament that the
conduct of ''blamed Tool" American girls
had nothing to do with the case.
As far as the Canadian Pacific Railroad
was concerned the doctor told Stanley that
the militia could take it if we ever should
need it. Then in a straightforward man
ner Stanley was told how Americans for a
century had yielded to British aggressions
in boundary disputes and how in our
struggle for National existence England
nad sent ships-of-war and masses of armed
men to Canada to menace us. Reference
was made to the acts of Great Britain in
building ana sending out ships with Eng
lish guns, English ammunition and Eng
lish gunners to drive our commerce from
the ocean. The doctor closed by saying
that he was 70 years of age and had served
in the war to preserve the Union, but not
withstanding his age ho would gladly
"shou.der his musket again to take a
whack at John Bull."
Dr. Hutchins aid not write expecting a
reply, but sent the letter to "free his
mind. :> To his surprise, the Hon. Mr.
Stanley replied in a six-page letter, which
was received day beloie yesterday. Stan
ley admitted that he had found the feeling
against England in the United States
wide, deep and tierce, and that when he
| returned to England he tola the people
there that a storm was brewing in the
West which would throw in the shade the
troubles in Egypt and Armenia. Every
one wanted to know what it was all about,
and he told them thai American hostility
to England was deep and widespread. The
English received the news with profound
surprise. They were absolutely uncon
scious that any differences with the United
States existed.
Mr. Stanley claimed that John Bull had
not wronged Uncle Sam since L 862, and
I that was thirty-four years ago. He knew
I that America was growing strong and
powerful, and was preparing to light Eng
land, lie believed the conriict would come
as the American press and public senti
ment would force it. He deplored the idea
of * war between the two fqremost nations
of the world, and did not like the spectacle
of the Russian and Teuton looking on
as spectators.
Stanley held that if our commerce was
driven from the ocean it would have been
I restored had not the greater weaith of in
! terior development claimed the attention
of the country. He contrasted that enor
mous and substantial development of our
interior with England's tifet on tne sea to
show that America had been the gniner.
Stanley assured the doctor' that John
Bull was a just man, and did not want to
quarrel witn Uncle bam, and that there
would be no trouble unless it was forced
on England.

MARCH, march, march !
//\AI ' How rapidly the months are
I W \\ marching past us !
jÂ£ V ]\ January, February and now
. Marchâ the third month of the
year. He came to us this morning and we
had to say farewell to February, who was so
joyous and full of sunshine, ana bid wel
come our new guest..
Don't be afraid of him, children, al
though so gruff and blustering. See, his
arms are rilled with sweet violets which
he scatters all over the bosom of our love
ly State. And now a little history about
the dear old fellow who blows away the
storms of winter to make earth and sky
all ready for the joys of spring.
Until the year 1564 in France, 1599 in
Scotland and 1752 in England, March was
the first month of the year, and was called
"Martins" by the Romans in honor of
. "Mars," who was their god of war,
The Anglo-Saxons called March "ITJyd
Mqnath." meaning loud or stormy weather.
Who in this world of ours their eyes
In March Bret open shall be wise,
1-1 days of peril, firm an.i brave.
And wear a bloodstone to their grave.
. The bloodstone is very hard and finely
fibrous, beins really a formation of "ore of
iron"; it varies in color from a steel-gray
to a blood-red. :|fig|jH(
In ancient times it was used very ex
tensively, many of the Egyptian and
Babylonian intaglios being made of it.
It'is now used as the setting of signet
rings, but principally as a polish for other
stones and metals.
: A variety of quartz of a ereenish hue,
flecked with spots of red jasper, is
sometimes called bloodstone.
: . The name heliotrope is applied to this
. latter variety also, because it is used as a
mirror with which to reflect the sun's rays
between distant points.
The flower which must reign supreme in '
March .is the sweet violet, its sentiment
being "ciodesty."

"I think we might as well give up the
tinging and let the band perform all the
music," said Lucy Arc: who appeared
to be .very greatly disappointed.
"But Phcebe says the programmes are
all printed and that Mr., Lane's ode is
upon it," replied Kitty Owens. "If we
don't sing it will spoil the whole affair."
"But we can't sing without Conrad and
Olga," persisted Lucy. â¢ â¢
"We can go through the form, Lucy,"
urged Kitty..
"W hat's all this row about, Lucy?" de
manded Philip Blanker, who came with
his sister to where the girls were seated.
They had heard the disagreeable . news a
moment before.
"We can't sing to-morrow, Phil," replied
Lucy. . â¢
"Can't sing!" exclaimed the teller's son,
with a savage frown on his face. "What's
the reason we can't?" â¢ '. "â¢ '
Philip's bn.mp of self-esteem wa3 quite
as fully developed as that of his father,
"If you say that again there will be a fight!" growled Phil.
and he considered himself the most impor
tant fellow in the first class of the high
Bchool, though he certainly was far from
bein-g the best scholar. He had a lordly
â¢way with him and was iniDatient of con
trol or contradiction.
"Conrad and Olga are not going to the
celebration,'' replied Lucy.
"What's the reason they are not?"
asked Philip angrily. "Is tliis a con
spiracy to spoil the celebration ?"
"You know the reason as well as the
rest of us, Phil. lam sorry they can't go,
but I 'can hardly blame them for it,"
Answered the amiable Lucy.
"You wouyd.QQt want to go, Pljil Black- 1
er, if your father was shut up in the
county jail." interposed Ben Barron, a big
hearted feliow with big fists, and perhaps
both of them caused him to be respected,
for he would not stand by and see a weak
boy or girl imposed upon.
"My father is not in the county jail,"
protested Philip violently.
"I did not say he was, though perhaps
he ought to be," replied Ben very im
properly, but Philip was a bully and his
father was one of the most unpopular men
in the town on account of his haughty and
overbearing manner.
â¢'lf you say that again there will be a
fight!" growled Phil, with his lists doubled
up for business, though nobody who knew
him believed he would use them.
"It is not necessary to say it again, and
I shall not do so. It looks just now as if
your father would be the next cashier of
the bank, Phil, but it is not worth while
to put on any airs yet," said Ben quietly.
"What is the trouble here?" inquired
Mr. Lane, the principal, as he came upon
the spot and heard exciting words as he
approached.
"Nothing," replied Phil, turning away.
"Conrad and Olga Biunfield will not at
tend the celebration." said Lucy.
"Will not attend !" exclaimed the prin
cipal. "You cannot do tiie singing with
out them; but I can see the reason, and I
am very sorry for them."
"We are all very sorry for them except
Phil and Phoebe," added Lucy.
"1 will see Conrad and Olga, and per
haps they can be induced to change their
minds." added Mr. Lane, as he saw the
son aad daughter of the cashier seated by
themselves, away from the others.
He sat down in front of them and took
the right hand of each. He expressed his
sympathy in the teuderest and most af
fectionate terms and both of them burst
into tears. He begged them not to de
spair and hoped ami believed their father
would come out of the ordeal without the
smell of lire upon him.
Then he spoke of the celebration, of the
preparations that had been made for it
and the disappointment of ttie class and
the peoole if the music was not given as
printed on the programme. They had a
duet in the ode and it was not possible to
have it without them. He prevailed in
the end and the principal announced that
the music would all be sung, to the great
joy of the scholars.

Washington's birthday proved to be
another delightful aboriginal summer
day in February, at least in the morning,
though iUlid not last quite all day. The
scholars of the high school dined at home
and were on the lawn in readiness to take
the barces that were to convey them to
"Fairyland," as Mr. Blanker had pre
sumptuously named his place, at
o'clock in the afternoon. The lake was
very pretty, with a small forest on the
farther side of it, but there was little else to
remind one of tha stories read in child
hood.
"Is everything ready out at \'our house
for the great time, Phil?" asked Lucy
Archer, as a considerable group gathered
around the teller's son.
â¢'Everything is ready, but when my
father got home rather late yesterday
afternoon he found thai the flagstaff a man
had promised to set up had not been
done," replied Phil. "He had to work till
near midnight to set it up himself. Mother,
fhoebe and I had to help him stand it up
in the hole dug for it about 10 o'clock in the
evening. Then he sent us all to bed in
order to be ready for it to-uay and rilled
up the hole himself."
"You had a hard time of it," added
Lucy. "I should think Mr. Blanker coujd
have found men enough to do the work."
"A man was engaged to do it yesterday
afternoon, but he did not come as he had
promised," added Phil. "But here are the
barges. The fare is half a dollar out and
back."
The scholars formed a merry party and
the girls began to sing as soon as they
were seated and kept it up till they ar
rived at "Fairyland." They were more
inclined to row in the two boats on the
lake than to do anything else. By 3
o'clock, the hour appointed for the exer
ises, tnerc was quite ajarjje collection of
cpeople gathered on the premises. General
Gainbridge came in his carriage precisely
at the time and was received with the most
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH J, 1896.
distinguished consideration by the teller
and cheered by the crowd in general.
Tiie scholars had taken their places at
the foot of tbe flagstaff on a platform pro
vided for them. Another was erected for
the magnates of the town and all were
seated. The band played the National
airs as an overture, and slid off them into
"America," whereupon the singers rose
and sang the hymn.
One of the clergymen of the place then
invoked the divine blessing and the gen
eral was properly announced as the orator
of the occasion in a fulsome speech by the
teller of the bank. Tbe oration was "very
long and very dry, and the patience of the
young men and maidens of the High
School was sorely tried by the infliction.
It was 4:15 o : clock when it was finished,
and a volley of sighs went up from the
singers' seats when the end came. Noth
ing could hurry the general in his dis
course, not even the fearfully black and
threatening clouds that were piling them
selves up in the west, and he could omit
no portion of his account of his ancestry,
from whom the name of the town was de
rived.
As he finished sharp flashes of lightning
blinded the eyes of the audience and deaf
ening" peals of thunder nearly stunned
them. Mr. Blanker hastened the proceed
ings, and the flag was run up by his own
hands, with a salvo of artillery. At
the same time Phil hoisted half-way up
the staff something like the topsail "of a
ship, on which appeared the name of the
lake in large letters, "Lake Washington,
named in honor of tiie Father of his Coun
try." The band played "The Star-spangled
Banner" and the choir sang it.
Mr. Blanker then rose on the platform,
and omitting the speech he had intended
to make, announced the ode, written for
the occasion by Percival Lane, the hon
ored principal o! the high In spite
of the tempest that was gathering it was
sung with brilliant effect by the scholars,
and rhe voices of both Conrad and Olga
could be easily distinguished in the genera 1
harmony, and the solo was applauded as
though no storm blackened the sky.
WHO ARE YOU?
Suddenly the wind began to howl, and
a violent squall came down upon the
scene. Most of the people fled to the
house and barn, for great drops of rain be
gan to pelt them. The flagstaff bent like
a willow rod. The inscription was carried
into the lake, and then the pole itself went
by the board. It had been mortised into
a Mniber cross, which was rooted out of
the ground, as a tree displays its roots in
a hurricane.
Those near it saw a box thrown up in
the upheaval. Conrad ran to the hole in
spite of the drenching rain. It was a box
of gold from the bank vault.
Mr. Blanker, who had retired from the
rostrum to the piazza of the house, saw
the flagstaff go down and the box thrown
up from the Dowels of the earth like a de
mon from the Infernal regions to confront
him. He fainted dead away and was
borne to his chamber. The rain was soon
over, and a gi eat crowd gathered around
the ragged hole. Among them was Gen
eral Gainbridge.
"That is the box stolen from the vault
of the bank!" exclaimed the president.
"The teller was tbe robber, and not the
cashier !''
"That is why Mr. Blanker had toset the
flagstaff himself," said Ben Barron, as
j Pi.il and Phoebe ran into the house, as
, thoroughly overwhelmed as Conrad and
Olga had been.
The girls hugged ana kissed Olga, and
1 he boys grasped the hands of Conrad, and
their congratulations were as hearty as
they were sincere. The general's carriaee
was taken to the hole. Two strong men
placed the box in it, and it was driven to
the bank where it was deposited in the
vault. The general was a just man if he
was haugtity and severe, and his carriage
proceeded at once to the County Jail. Mr.
Binntield was promptly released, the gen
eral declaring that his innocence had been
made apparent to a multitude of people
by the direct interposition of Providene .
The general's carriage conveyed the cashier
to his nome, and a scene such as need not
be described followed. T:ie flag had been
raised, and so had the box of treasure.â

And no clover-iieirt could lie tee,
For the snow all around bad covered the ground,
And the wind with his fur made free.

With a roar of saucy idee.

THE MTTLE GAMECOCK.
An Amusing Story of an English Artist's
Pet Rooster.
We allÂ»remernber the story of the Athe
nian artist who painted cherries so natu
rally that even the birds were deceived and
came to peck at them. A modern inci
dent illustrates" in a somewhat similar
manner the power of pictorial art to de
ceive, and at the same time seems to show
a good deal of reasoning intelligence in at
least one member of the feathered tribe.
Scott Leighton, the Boston artist, tells the
story of a pet gamecock that he kept in his
studio. Having at one time to paint the
portrait of a large-sized gan.ecock for a
patron he noticed that the pet suffered a
great deal from the domineering spirit of
the larger bird, and get so that he could
never sue him without flying into a rage.
After the picture was completed and the
feathered model had been removed, the
canvas remained in the studio standing on
the floor.
One day the little gamecock was picking
his way about the studio when be sud
denly caught sight of the counterfeit pre
sentment of his former ene,my. With a
scream of rage he gave one leap and flying
at the picture struck his spurs into it
j again and again. The next time he was
given an opportunity he repeated the at
tack, and it became the almost daily
amusement ot the artist and his friends to
witness these impromptu cock-fights be
tween a live bird and a dummy.
At last one day the little fellow, resting
a moment after an unusually spirited at
i tack, happened to cock his bead on one
j side so as to get a look behind the picture.
I For an instant he was dumfounded. He
looked in front and saw his old enemy as
large as life, another glance behind and he
i was more than ever puzzled. He thea de
liberately walked behind and around the
picture several times, carefully surveying
it, and finally with a spiteful flirt and with
an air of disgust that would have done
credit to a human being marched away
and hid himself.
Never after that day could he be per
suaded to attack the picture or indeed to
pay the slightest attention to it. He had
detected the sham and would have no
more of it. â Our Animal Friends.
DONALD SERIES-NO. XVIII.
FOR TINY BOYS.
All tne wee folks who have been inter
ested in the "Donald Series" know that
Donald is 7 years old.
I am going to teil you a story to-day of
something he did a long time ago ; long be
fore you knew him, when he had a large
garden in which to play.
Something else liked, to play in that
garden, too, something all brown and
green and geld in soft spots and shades;
something with large eyes; something
that said "Kee-junk," in deep, croaky
voices.
Yes, toads. Great big fellows they were,
too, and Donald just loved to get down on
all fours and catch those toads, looking
like a giant toad as he hopped around with
his golden curls, blue coat and brown
overalls.
I'm sure they thought he was their big
brotiier because they did not. seem at ail
afraid of him.
AfteÂ»- he caught them he would put
them into a can, but as last as he put them
in, just the very moment he turned his
back, out they would hop again, thinking
it great sport to play such a game oi hide
and seek.
But, ah me, one day Donald did some
thing to make at least one toad feel a little
bit afraid of him.
His mamma called him into dinner that
day just as lie had captured a beauty. The
little boy thought he would like to keep,
him for a pet, so without meaning to be
cruel, I am sure, he took a string from his
pocket (you know boys always do have
string in their pockets) and lied it around
one of Mr. Kee-Junk's hind legs. He then
tied the other end to the handle of the
screen door.
Now, this screen door opened out on a
vine-covered porch where the family often
gathered.
After Donald had safoly secured the
poor toad, he washed his hands and face
and went into dinner.
Before the me;tl was over, visitors came,
and as they were friends uf whom the
little boy was very fond, their presence
drove all thoughts 'of the prisoner out of
his mind.
Late in the evening mamma invited her
callers to view the beautiful moonlight
from the porch. When she opened the
door, something gave a jump, and as she
felt the cold body of the toad against her
hand, as it swung with the motion of the
door, she cave a frightened little scream,
bin soon discovered and released the poor
toad, who hopped away with a croak of
mingled disgust and delight.
Before Donald went to bed, mamma told
him how much the tiuht string must have
hurt the toad's le_' and iiow uncomfortable
it must have feit to hang with head down
for such a long time, and how useful toads
are in a garden because they feast on the
fat snails that eat su many choice plants.
Donald felt very sorry, and after that
was a true friend to the toads; but I can
tell you, dears, there was one big fellow
that always got out of the little boy's way
as fast as he could.
MAEGIE VISITS PAIRYLAND.
FOR I.ITTI.E GIRLS.
"So, ho, my little lady, you are tired of
washing dishes, tending baby and going
errands, and wish that you might run
away to Fairyland, where everything is
lovely, and there is no work, but always
play?"
Margie from her seat on a gra96y knoll
startled, looked wonueringly about her to
see whence came the funny little piping
voice.
There, right in front of her perched on
a swaying larkspui was the querest tiny
man ! He was dressed in brown knee
breeches, had golden slippers on his feet,
and wore on his head an odd pointed bine
cap covered with small silver bells, which
tinkled sweetly as he balanced himself on
one wee foot.
"So you wish to co to Fairyland," he
laughingly said, while Margie rubbed her
eyes in astonishment. She could scarcely
realize that her wish was about to come
true, and that a reaily truly fairy stood
before her.
Prince Silver Bells waved his wand as he
spoke and Margie felt herself lifted md
wnfted very swiftly through the air.
She closed her eyes to keep from getting
dizzy and when she opened them she
found herself in a very beautiful place,
more beautiful than she hail ever dreamed
of.
"I bring you a mortal dissatisfied with
her lot In life, your highness" Prince
Silver Bells said as he saluted his dainty
but majestic queen, presenting the trem
bling but delighted Margie.
The queen, with her courtiers and ladies,
looked upon the blue-eyed, golden-haired
child well pleased.
"I charge you, Snap Dragon, and you,
sweet Wild Rose, with the taslc of dipping
Goldilocks In our charmed fountnin that
she may in sooth be born into our kingdom

and become one of us forever," commanded
the queen.
As Margie, or Goldilocks, as she was
now called, was led by the maids of honor
through exquisite halls and fragrant gar
dens her heart leaped for joy. But when
they reached the magic fountain she real
ized that bhe could nevei more be her
mamma's own Margie if she bathed, in
that fountain, so she began to struggle
and cried out: "Oh, please, please let me
go; please do take me home."
"Margie, Margie, dear; you are dream
ins, child; wake up."
Very sweet indeed sounded her mother's
voice as she rubbed her eyes and looked
about.
"Oh, how glad I am that it was only a
dream ! 1 will never, never complain
again, mamma." And Margie clasped her
mother tightly around the neck, as if she
were still not quite sure of its being only
a dream. C. P. W.
An Interesting Weigh Custom on the
Ist of March.
The Welsh have been in the habit from
time immemorial of wearing a leek in the
cap on the Ist of March. This custom is
said to have originated in the circumstance
of some Welsh troops, followers of the
Black Prince, wearing leeks at the battle
of Crecy, in order to distinguish them
selves from their enemies. In a very old
history a certain Welshman, Sir David, is
made to say to his men on the eve of battle :
For my colors or ensign do I wear upon my
bayonet, you see, a green leek set in gold,
which shall, If we win the victory, hereafter be
tin honor to Wales, and on this day, beini? the
Ist of March, be it forever worn by Welshmen
in remembr >nee thereof.
On the national holiday a gilt leek is
still carried in processions, and a silver
one is presented to the head master at
Eton by the Welsh boy of highest rank in
the school. â St. Nicholas Magazine.
A Smell for a Bite.
Bob had been to the barber-shop to have
his hair cut. Bob's hair was almost white,
and when ii was short there were grounds
for suspicion that nature had not furnished
anything oh the top of his head but a bald
spot.
When Bob took off his hat the aroma of
the barber's long-necked bottles filled the
air. All the other boys crowded around
and sniffed.
"Here, Bob, let me smell your hair,"
said one.
At that all the boys wanted to smell
Bob's hair. Boh objected and put on his
hat. Jimmy Bank, who was eating an
apple, stepped up.
"I'll give you a bite of my apple for a
smell," he said.
"I'il take you," said Bob.
So the apple went into Bob's mouth and
the smell into Jimmy's nose. Both seemed
satisfied.
And during the forenoon Bob received
four peanuts, a buckle, two bites more of
apple, a broken top and a horseshoe nail
for smells. He would have done a larger
business than that only the boys soon
smeiled all the odor away. â Chicago

A New Kind of Fabric.
A new kind of fabric lias been devisedâ
an ornamental india-rubber waterproof
material of little more weight than the or
dinary single-texture waterproof fabric,
and applicable in almost all casea now
treated by spreading or coating water
proof woven fabric. " This improvement
consists in covering the surface with a coat
or coats of sheilac. Woven stuff is se
lected of the sort desired and produced in
the pattern preferred, and the back coated
with one or more coatings of india-rubber
substance in an ordinary spreading ma
chine and in the ordinary way; a film or
coat of shellac dissolved iv ammqniacal
solution is next applied, in any design re
quired, so as to leave a portion of the sur
face uncovered; next, the shellac-coated
fabric, after vulcanization, is ornamented
by printing upon it in a suitable medium
and in such colors as may be appropriate
the pattern or design. To protect the
printed surface the printed fabric is cov
ered once or twice with a transparent so
lution of india rubber before vulcaniza-
tion or after; it is then ready to receive a
coat of arrowroot or other suitable sub
stance for producing a shot or other lumi
nous effect.
Development of Human Flight.
Otto Lilienthal contributes to the Aero
nautical Annual for 1896 an exhaustive and
very interesting article on ''Practical Ex
periments for the Development of Human
Flight." Human flignt, he maintains, is
proceeding toward perfection by gradual
development. The laws of atmospheric
resistance, upon which all flying depends,
and regarding which, until very recent
yÂ«ars, the greatest uncertainty has ex
isted, have now bsen defined to such an
Lilicnthal's Air-Sailer.
extent that the different phases of flight
can be treated mathematically. Besides
this the physical processes of the natural
flight of the creatures have become
the subject of minute investigation, and
have in most cases been satisfactorily ex
plained. The nature of the wind, also, and
its influence on flying bodies, have been
carefully studied, thus enabling us to un
derstand several peculiarities of the bird's
flight hitherto unexplainable, so that one
can apply the results thus obtained in per
fecting human flight. Only by actual Hy
ing experiments can a practical insight
into tne practice of flying be obtained. The
accompanying illustration shows Lilien
thal's idea of a flying niacnine, and is an
exact picture of the construction of the ap
paratus.
It is a double apparatus. The upper
surface is separated from the lower by a
distance equal to three-quarters of the
breadth of the lower surface, and it has no
disturbing influence whatever, but creates
only a vertically acting lilting force. With
such an apparatus one always cuts the air
quickly, so that both surfaces are met by
the air current, and therefore both act as
lifters. The whole management of such
an apparatus is just the same as that of a
single sailing surface. Steerine is brought
about by simply changing the center of
gravity, shifting the position of the body.
Wnile Maxim builds machines of several
tons' weight, and depends upon screw pro
pulsion, Lilienthal's apparatus is just
heavy enough to hold the operator, and is
propelled by flaps.
Flight of Louis XVI.
Carlyle probably died without any con
sciousness of his gravest mistakes, his
account of the kind's flight to Varennes.
It was not till March, 1880, that Oscar
Browning, who in the previous an turn n
had been over the ground, showed in a
paper read before the Royal Historical
Society that t!ie account, while "a very
vivid picture of the affair as it occurred, in
its broad outlines consistent with the
truth," was "in almost every detail inex
act," "almost ever/ statement false or

exaggerated." Carlyle's cardinal blunder
was that he took the distance from Paris
to Varennes to be only sixty-seven
miles, whereas it is 160. I should
imagine that he confused Varennes-en-Ar
gonne with Varennes-Jaulgonne, a village
not lying far off the route, now sixty-six
miles by rail. From this blunder flowed
a whole catalogue of errors, for which I
mus^ refer the reader to the Historical So
ciety s transactions. Mr. Browning's pa-
P er is evidently not so well known as it
should be, inasmuch as the Marquis of Ri
pon, at the London meeting for the pur
chase of the Chelsea house, cited the flight
to Varennes as an example of Carlyle's
historical gifts. Suffice it to Pay, that the
pace of the royal carriage in Oaflyle's nar- j
rative became three miles per hour instead |
of six and a half, and that the carriage it
j self became a huge lumbering vehicle,
whereas it was a well-constructed post
chaise, going at an ordinary pace on an
occasion, however, when the pace should !
have been unusual.
Mr. Browning is thorough almost mer
ciless in his exposure of errors. He could
not, indeed, be expected to pass over Car
i lyle's description of Drouet as in his ni^ht
j gown, instead of dressing gown, as ludi
crous a mistake as that with which Oar
lyle twitted a translator of "Faust," who
made the fainting Margaret ask her neieh
bor at church for her dram bottle in lieu
of her smelling-bottle. But ho might have
been a little less severe on the town of
v arennes being styled a paltry little vil
lage; on Drouet being described as still in
the prime of life, when he was only 28; on
couchee for coucher; on Pont-de-Somme
ville for Pont Sommevesleâ both forms
seem to have been used ; and on the pres
ence of sunshine. This last correc'.ion is
| rather strained.â Westminster Review.

A lUrd Shepherd.
The natives of Venezuela and adjoining
countries on tho north side of the river
Amazon often avail themselves of the
services of a native crane to care for their
poultry, and also, in the place of collies or
shepherd dogs, used by North Americans
and Europeans to guard and herd their
I domestic animals. This remarkable bird,
which tbe Indians call yak-a-mik and or
nithologists Psophia crepitans, is found in
a wild state in the great forests that lie
between the northern coasts of South
I America and the Amazon River, particu
j iarly in Venezuela and British Guiana.
I The birds never Jeave the forests unless
I shot or captured. They travel about
| in flocks of from one to two hundred,
; in search of the berries, fruit 3 and insects
| upon which they subsist.
Their usual gait is a slow and stately
' march, but they enliven themselves from
| time to time by leaping up into the air,
i executing eccentric and fantastic waltzes
i and striking the most absurd and prepos
terous attitudes, if pursued they en
! cieavor to save themselves by running, for
their flight is po weak, according to Sdoom
burgh, that when they attempt to fly over
I a body of water of any considerable width
they are often obliged to drop upon it and
i sa\e themselves by swimming. When
! alarmed they utter the peculiar cry which
! has obtained for them their name of
trumpeters. The sound is something like
that produced by a person endeavoring to
shout the syllables "tow, tow, tow; tow,
tow," with his mouth shut, or tbe doleful
noise made by children on New Year's
with iheir trumpets. The yakamiks
usually deposit their eggs in a slight hol
i low in the ground, often at the foot of a
I tree.
Tho yakamiks are very readily tamed,
and prove valuable servants to the In
dians, who domesticate them, as they are
very courageous, and will protect animals j
intrusted to their care at every risk to '
themselves. Even dogs are obliged to
yield to their authority. They may t>e i

I domestic fowls, and every morning will !
i drive the ducks and poultry to their'feed
â  ing places, and, carefuily collecting any
i stragglers, brine them safely home at
â  night. A yakamik soon learns to know
â  and to obey the voice of its master, follows
| him when permitted wherever he goes,
! and appears delighted at receiving his
I casesses. It repines at his absence and
, welcomes hid return, and is extremely
I jealous of any rival. Should any dog or

after it has driven away all who might
aspire to-a favorable notice from the fam
ily. It appreciates favors in the same pro
portion as it is jealous of sharing them
with others, and manifests joy and affec
tion by the most extravagant capers and
gesticulations. When the animals of
which he has charge are shut up for the
night, the yakaraik roosts upon some shed
or tree near at hand, to be ready to take its
place as keeper as soon as they are let out
in the morning. One quality which makes
it valuable is its sense of location, which is
<perfect; however far it may wander with
the docks or herds it guards, it never fails
to find its way home at night, driving be

A Pocket Electric Lamp,
A German inventor, Herr Bohwinkle,
has devised a form of electric incandescent
lamp, with accompanying battery, com
pact enough to be carried about in the
pocket. We translate a description of the
device from d*r Stein der Weisen (Vienna,
' Jan aary 1), and reproduce the accompany
ing pictures:
"Such a lamp as shown in Fig. 1, Figg. 2
and 3 represent tne corresponding light
| tubes of two different dimensions. These
i last, like that represented in Fig. 1, consist
iof two principal parts; that seen at the
lower half, which in Fig. 1 i 3 made as a flat
flask, but in Fijr?. - and 3 as tubes closed at
' the bottom, and that at, the upper half, the
; battery, which by moans of a screw is
â  fastened airtight to the other part.
"The battery, whioh is called a 'revolver'
battery, on account of its likeness to the
1 chambers of a revolver, consists of thiee
platinum zinc elements * * * capable
: of giving a current of six volts and four to
five amperes. Fastened to the poles are

Curiosities About Coins.
Herodotus says that Croesus was the
first ruler to order gold coins made.
In the year 450 B. C, round copper coins
were first made. Each weighed twelve
ounces.
The most valuable United States cents
are those of 1793, 1799, 1804, 1809, 1811,
ISI3, 1823 and 1827.
The rarest and most valuable United
.States coin of what is called the "regular
mint series" is the silver dollar of 1804.
A silver half-dime of the year 1802 is
worth $:>O, if in good condition, and from
$10 to $2o if in only fair shane.
The only valuable nickel 5-cent piece is
that of the year 1877, which the collectors
purchase at $1 each.
The little silver 3-cent piece was first
coined in 1851. It was discontinued in
1873. One of the first date is worth a dime,
one of the last $1.
The face on the silver dollar is that of a
young lady residing in Philadelphia. Her
name is Anna W. Williams, and she is a
teacher of kindergarten philosophy.
The very oldest coin in the British Mu
seum is an iEgian piece of the year 700 B.
C. It is not dated, of course, dating being
a modern innovation, extending back only
500 years.
An Archaeological Discovery.
An interesting archaeological discovery
has, says a Brussels correspondent, just
been made at Bruges. Some workmen
who were constructing a sewer in the
neigh borhood of the "Church of Notre
Dame unearthed a subterranean chamber,
the walls of which were decorated with
paintings of sacred subjects, dating from
the latter end of the fifteenth century, all
of which were in a state of perfect pres
ervation.
Some Notable Uwnrfu.
According to Pliny, Tullia, a niece of
Augustus, had a maid in her employ "who
was. scant two feet and a hand's breadth
in height." Count Borowlaski, a Polish
gentleman, born in the first half of the
last century, was only twenty-five inches
high on his twenty-eighth birthday. He
lived to be 98 years old, dying in England
in 1837. Bebe, the favorite dwarf of the
court of King Stanislaus of Poland, was
thirty-three inches'high. Jeffery, or Geoffry
Hudson, England's most famous dwarf,
was eighteen inches in height.
Scientific Notes.
The London Chronicle is of the opinion
that although much has been written
about argon, no one has seen his way to
suggest a use for it now that it has been
discovered. An ingenious susgestion in
this direction has been made by W. It.
Quinan in the "Journal" of the American
Chemical Society. The suggestion is that
in argon we have an ideal thermometrical
substance for the measurement of high
temperatures. An objection which can be
raised to the use of the ordinary gases in
air thermometers for high temperature
measurements is, that being diatomic they
may at these temperatures become dissoci
ated, whereas argon, on the other hand,
being monatomic, or presumably so, is in
capable of dissociation at a high tempera
ture. By the use of ergon in this manner,
it is possible we may be able to detect and
measure at high temperatures the dissoci
ation of permanent pases, and thus attack |
a problem at present beyond our reach.
The weaK spot about this suggestion of
course is that it is not yet certain that ar
gon is a monatomic gas. If, however, this
point should be absolutely proved, it is
probable that some valuable and interest
ing work may be accomplished somewhat
on t lie lines indicated.
In a recent communication to a German
medical paper Messrs. Iteute and Enoch
give the results of a series of experiments
on the air of schoolrooms, for the purpose
of ascertaining the average number of
germs present, and whether any of them
were pathogenic. The windows were
closed an hour before the samples of air
were taken, and measured quantities were
then passed through gelatine. The maxi
mum number of eerms amounted to over
3,000,000 per cubic meter, and minimum to
1500 per cubic meter, the average being
about 268,000 per cubic meter of air. The
experiments were conducted froai Sep
tember to Match and the results were very
j variable. The authors describe eighteen
different species of bacteria, but of these
they found only one to be pathogenic to
mice, rabbits, or the guinea-pig.
Some interesting work bearing on the
origin of our atmosphere has recently been
published by Mr. T. L. Phipson. Assum- ;
ing that the chief constituent of the prinii- ;
tive atmosphere was nitrogen gas, the
author believes that the oxygen now pres
ent has been added chiefly by the aid of
vegetable life. Experiments which have
been made upon plants show that they can
exist without free oxygen. Thus convol- j
vulus arvensis, growing, for three months
in an â¢atmosphere of damp nitrogen, in
which a certain amount of carbonic acid
gas w.is present, eventually converted tin's
highly nitrogenous atmosphere into air, |
such as we know it now. Continuing the
experiment further, the amount of oxygen
was still more increased. An important
i point discovered was that inferior plants,
! such us protococcus and conferva, gave oat
about fifty times as much oxygen, weight
for weight, as those of more recent geo
logical periods.
Any theory which, with any degree of
probability, will account for those mys.- '
terious tails attached to comets, stretching
in some cases for many hundred thousand
miles across the heavens, is sure to excite
interest. Professor Fessenden has sug
j gested in a recent number of the Astro*
! pnysical Journal a possible explanation,
w.,ich, although somewhat hypothetical,
1 is yet a possible explanation of many or
the observed facts. It has been shown by
j several investigators that when ultra-violet
i light is allowed to fall upon an unelectrlied
; body the surface of the body disintegrates,
i the particles which fly off being charged
j negatively, while the body itself becomes
i positively charged. Starting with thi3 ob
â â  served lact, Professor Fessenden suggests
! that negatively charged particles are emit
tea from that side of a comet which is
turned toward the sun, whilst the nucleus
i of the comet becomes positively charged.
I Erom evidence derived from the solar
i spectrum, J. J.Thomson has shown the
â  probability that the chromosphere of the
I sun is negatively electrified, which is one
i of the forces, acting with others, tending
! to repel and drive the comet particles
| away from the sun.

Potash deposits are commonly found
associated with deposits of rock salt. Of
the latter vast beds exist in New York,

It has hitherto been the custom of the
children attending the public schools of
Austria and Hungary to kiss the hands of
the teacher on anival and departure. This
has now been forbidden by an order from
the Imperial Board of Education, which
bayes its action on the fact that sanitary
investigation has shown that kissing is
unhealthy, and should not be practiced
when absolutely unnecessary.
The practice of twining creeping plants
over masonry is increasing. Beyond the
fact that the growths retain dampness,
which is injurious to framework, there is
another dancer. An ivy plant with a
three-inch stem once raised a wall pier
from its setting and pushed it out bodily,
while another one grew between two ver
tical stones and split into pieces three
stones above it.
One of the most curious of the many na
tural barometers consists of a half-pint
glass half full ot water, a piece of muslin
and a leech. The leech must be put in the
water and the muslin tied over the top of
the glass that the creature cannot get out
neuin. When fine weather is to be the or
der of the day the leech will remain at the
bottom of the water, coiled up in spiral
shape, perfectly motionless. If rain ia to
be expected it will creep to the top of the
glass and remain there until there is a
likelihood of more settled weather. If
there is to be a storm of wind it squirms
about in the .water with violence. For
some days before thunder it occasionally
moves its body in a convulsive fashion. In
frosty weather it behaves in the same man
ner as in fine weather, and it foretells snow
in the same manner.
Sir Kobert Ball, Astronomer Royal of
Ireland, in his recent lecture to children on
"The Wonders of Astronomy," made some
astounding and interesting statements, a
gnat many of which are new to old as
well as the young. Among other things he
said that there are stars so remote that they
would not have yet received a telegraphic
message announcing the birth of Christ

ber of revolutions can be perfectly
controlled by means of a lever at the base
of the tower. When the engine is work
ing in a fair wind the vanes are inclined to

degrees. If the wind is very high, or it is
desired to work at reduced speed, the vanes
can be set at an ansjle of 32, 20, 10 or even
5 degrees to the wind. But whatever the
angle there is no danger of a sudden in
crease of wind velocity carrying away the
whole structureâ a catastrophe not un
known with some wind motors. Indeed
the machinery would not even travel at a
dangerous pace, for any abnormal pressure
of wind automatically opens the sails, and
when they are completely open, whether
by the pressure of "the wind or by the
movement of the lever the wheel ceases to
revolve.
The engines will do the work with as
little as four or five mile wind, but there
is practically no necessity to work out the
table to this point, because the returns
specially compiled demonstrate that there
is always sufficient wind per month at the
pressure tabulated.
The engine is made in various sizes.
The energy costs nothing and the original
outlay, with wear and tear, spread over a
few years, amounts to so little that the
wind-engine is an inexpensive motor. For
water supply and drainage the wind-en
gine has long ago achieved distinction, it
is now coming to the front for electrical
purposes. '

came proverbial. When the Moors over
ran Spain in the ninth century, they were
already masters of many of the arts, and
especially were they adepts in the working
of metal. Their swords were highly
valued for their delicate temper, and their
special decoration, which we still call
damascenine, was also justly prized. It
was from these conquerors that the Span
iards learned much of their skill in forging
and tempering steel.
And that the completeness of the no
blest weapon men ever made should not
be marred by the Jack of any element,
natural or artificial, the fairy godmother,
nature, contributed one more gift. On
the oanks of the Tagus there is an abun
dance of fine sand. In the process of
forging the metal is taken white-hot from
the furnace, and is subjected to a cooling
process. It was to the peculiar properties
of this white Tagus sand, in which the
cooling blade was buried, that the Toledo
blades owe their unequaled hardness and
great flexibility.â St. Nicholas.

THE
LATEST FASHION GOSSIPN FOR WOMEN AND MEN.
MANY of the belles, buds and
beaux are wondering if some
body will remember mi-carene
and give a dance or some un
â  usually pleasant party. As yet.
no such an event has been announced, but
we live in h^pes.
Some pretty iunches and dinners have
been given this week, and not a few card
parties on a small scale. I believe that
Paderewski and his friend will receive an
ovation to-day. Sousa's arrival is being
impatiently awaited, and Miss Carrie Duke
hiis several friends in this City who are
eagerly awaitinu her. She is a bright and
bonny Southern girl. Two Easter brides
I ka'ovr are busily preparing the most
fascinating of trousseaux, but as yet they
are not on view. The 11. -H. wedding is
an event of the past, but the bride and
groom are expected to arrive here soon,
and we may be sure that their numerous
friends and relatives will give them a
â warm welcome liome.
I have been reading about furs, velvets
and skating costumes until I am quite
fatigued, for in this climate at this time of
the year we are more interested in lighter
fabrics, which are subjects of especial in
terest to those who are going southward
ere long. The fete at Santa Barbara will
be on quite a magnificent sea k\ and those
who go will never forget the oeauty and
variety of California's flowers. All tour
ists and visitors should avail themselves
oi the opportunity which will soon be of
fered them.
The illustration of the beaded waist
given to-day was successfully carried out
in a pale-preen poplin on which is a de
sign in leaded embroidery extending over
the shoulders. The work is done in stiaded
green and bronze beads. The other bodice
is of rose-pink satin and chiffon with
choux of yellowish lace overhangine tabs
of seuuin-emb'oidered trimming. A plain
fckirt of seven gores completes a good
gown. I lately noted another waist of
ro<e-colored velvet and accordion-pleated
Bilk elbow sleeves, which were almost as
effective as chiffon ones and have the ad
vantage of being far more durable and less
expensive than 'that dearly-beloved fabric.
The decolletage was tinisued with a be
coming ruche and outlined with a beaded
cord add pink roses.
The softest and finest of muslins are
also to supplant chiffon in many cases.
They will invariably be accordion-pleated.
The new gray gown for early sprint: will
do good service all summer. As you ob
serve, the jacket is a new shape. The skirt
is simply plain and full and there is just
sufficient spring on the hips in the basque
of the jacket to crive the necessary fullness,
whieii is becoming, to the waist. It is
double-breasted and the novelty lies in the
collar and lapels, they are faced with vel
vet, 'which encircles the neck in marked
contrast to a darker velvet vest. It is
singularly becoming to tne slope of, the
shoulders and is a thoroughly practical
shape; the sleeves are cut large from the
shoulders to the elbow, whence they fit
the arm closely to -the wrist. This design
eminated from Kedfern.
The rich pniley geranium color, which
has many names, is lovely either in moire
poplin (a beautiful material and one rap
idly increasing in favor) or in velvet or
satin, especially when intermixed with
white satin lace ani sable.
Basques are increasing in length for
both evening and morning wear. A fetch
ing cloth gown for a young bride is in
white miroir poplin, trfnimed with pearl
embroidery and wreathed with roses.
Velvet of a tomato tint is said to be be
coming and will be worn by those whose
complexions can stand it. Low bodices
off the shoulders continue to be the fash
ion.- : 'â 
A skirt called the "Pliante" has recently
been invented, which is said to keep the
organ or godet pleats of our skirts in their
proper fold, thus preserving their graceful
lines ;and preventing them from falling
toward toward our heels. As I have not
yet seen the Pliante I must quote the de
scription: "The fittings are adjusted in
Borne cases to a fkirt of black silk made
With aores.and trimmed around tne bottom
With a full rulHe, which stands out, owing
to a row of fetherbone, which is pliable
and cannot break. In the back breadths
there is an arrangement of thin steel rib
bons,-which are adjusted by elastic straps
to which buckles are attached. As a rr.ls
there are three ribbons in the upper and
three in the lower part of the petticoat.
The lower ones are longer, of course, and
when they are strapped, together form
natural godets which never lose their
shape. There is very little weight to this
arrangement, and the ribbons can be re
moved or adjusted with ease.'* The at
tachments for this skirt are to be bad sep
arately and can be put in any skirt. It is
said to be an economical arrangement
which wili give an air of stylo to any well
cat skirt, and if all that is said about it is
true no summer outfit will be complete
without one or two such skirts.
The most artistic gowns at present are
being modeled after the fashions of the
Louis XV period, so we shall see many
long-pointed waists, narrow sleeves, witii
lace at the elbows and wrist. The slight
tendency to the paners is noticed. The
blouse has been superseded by the bodice
and is worn with a skirt, made plainly of
satin. It may be either biack or colored,
and is more a la Louis X\J than Louis
XV. Striped and flowered silk is used
effectively, as we all know. The revers
are large and open over a chemisette of
pleated lace or tulle. The back is cut like
a shot jacket, the front being completed at
the waist with a fold of veivet of a corre
sponding shade, the same as that em
ployed at the throat. The collar is in
variably of the modified Medici shape,
flaring out from the back of the neck. The
inside of the collar must be covered with
line lace, and this falls on either side of the
revers upon the chemisette in jabots.
Before continuing about our frocks, a
few wo;ds about hats and bonnets,
although to be sure but few of us will in
vest ii> new ones for several weeks, and
one of our first purchases will be a sailor
hat, and we may rest assured that some
especially pretty changes will be seen in
this sensible and useful style.
Paul Virot is sending out numberless
models. One of his latest is a three
cornered hat, the brim turning upwaid,
with but little trimming excepting a hand
some bird with dark blue metallic plum
age and outspread wings; he appears tc
have alighted on one siae.
Tulle "will be used extensively, and a
ruche of it surrounds a pretty toque,which
has a low pointed crown and rosettes oi
the same tulle on either side, trimmed en
tirely with ivy and turquoise, a Frenchy
combination of Vlrot's.
Hats promise to remain large; a model
black chip has a low flat crown, liberally
trimmed with sequins. A large aigrette is
in front. One of the styles that undoubt
edly will be received with favor is the
"Capeline." It has a flat crown and flat
brim, which extends all around, but the
trimmings give the necessary height.
Chine ribbons are being liberally used as
' bows and loops. One particularly good hat
of a brown tone is said to positively have
dozens of loops of chine ribbon; these
form a simply enormous bow, which
comes between the waved brim and the
hair. Satin cord like rouleaux are new,
and "are introduced on tulle and as ruch?s
or fringes to toques, mingling often with
rich red and rosettes of tulle and steel
embroidery. 1 ' Some of the bonnets show
a tendency to return to the close-fitting
Empire style. Jet fringes are looped over
the face from the edge of the brim of such
bonnets, and tulle strings are tied under
the chin. Tulle string, edged with
butter lace, it will be seen, as well as
those of chine ribbon for strings, are to
return. An authority on millinery says :
The most beautiful loliage, often shot and
most curiously colored, appears at the
back of bonnets and as aigrettes both to
hats and bonnets, while many of the
feather and osprey aigrettes start from
diamond ornaments. Straws pleated with
distinct points, not at all smooth, but
wide, in all coiors, form the foundation
for many hats and bonnets, and a hat
made in a dark-red shade of this class had
bows of the fashionable moire ribbon,
with Poppies of two tone:-, made in silk,
a huge sort of butterfly bow at the back
under the brim.
As golf is to be the game this year, we
shail short;}' hear discussed links, holes,
tees, hazards, approach shots, cleek shots,
a woll-loafted mashee, a brassie and iron
and a perfect drive, so, girls, at once
begin to study the game, for ore long I
expect that the links and holes at the
Presidio will be in a good condition, and
as this fascinating game increases in popu
larity re may expect to hear of links at
Burlingame and Berkeley. As far as golf
costumes are concerned they are varied,
but at this time of the year brown linen or'
mohair skirts wili give gocd satisfaction.
The skirt ruust not extend further than
the shoetons, and tan leggings are much
worn. A stylish woman worelast autumn
a golfing costume consisting of a dark-blue
skirt, white shirt, black shoes, tan leggings,
a dark blue necktie tied in a bow and a
white sailor hat with a ribbon matching:
her tie. Her belt was of wliite kid. Nor
folk jackets are much worn also, but are
too warm for comfort in this climate.
One is very chic, made of bright red cloth,
with black collar and cuffs and gili but
tons ana buckle. A swell cape is com
posed of brown cloth lined with a bright
cloth. Skirts of covert cloth can be worn.
The heh- are always of kid or leather. A
knitted jersey goes well with a covert
cloth skirt, a red and black one being ef
fective.
Not only is golf a very healthful game,
but it is also said to greatly improve the
figure, which is a strong recommendation
for most women.
The bicycle will continue in vogue and
women who wish to be appropriately
turned out will dress simply and quietly

in tweeds, cloths or serges made in a
severely plain and business-like manner.
Narrow skirts reaching only to Ibo ankle
are the best, and the "coat bodices," which
are cut long enough to touch the saddle,
are ti.e best. Some are worn with shirt
waists and some with waistcoats, and
others with a combination of shirt and
wuistcoast. Stiff collars and ties are cor
rect. Neat felt hats or Taru o'Shauters
cover many pretty heads, and well-litting
shoes and gaiters should complete such cos
tumes; however, the garments donned by
some women who disfigure a wheel are
fearfully and wonderfully contrived. Even
the niost attractive of women are
at their worst when wheeling, and unsuit
able clotning makes many positively ridic
ulous and repulsive. In the park I have
seen costumes that I could not understand
any sane woman wearing. . Why, some
were â well, why go into details; most of
you have seen the marvelously costumed
women that frequently assemble in our
beautiful park, and have made your own
criticisms. Hut, in concluding this sub
ject, let me repeat that hats with Mowers,
silk waists adorned with lace, etc., are
quite as much out of place on a bicycle as
on horseback.
During the coming season we will see a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH I, 1896.
GRAY GOWN FOR EARLY SPRING WEAR.
great deal more attention paid to harmony
â  of color between the machine dnd the rid
er's outfit. Shades of gray will be popular,
1 as they show neither mud nor dust, as all
the darker colors do. White and cream
; white is very smart.
The lovely fabrics now being displayed
in our stores are tempting enough to make
i us all do wildly extravagant things, so let
me advise you to pause and relied, for we
I certainly (unless wealthy and extrava-
I gant) must carefully consider first, what
can Lie done with last summer's gowns,
and secondly, to what uses can we put
I our dainty, pretty evening frocks, which
have done such good and faithful service
all winter. Last June's finery can, with a
' few alterations, do duty again, and our
\ favorite ball and dinner costumes will re
turn lrom the cleaner's and dyer's all
ready for t!ie addition of frills," flounces
and fichues of lace, mull, net or chif
fon. A great belle, who reigned not
long ago at the White Sulphur
Springs, in Virginia, confessed to a friend
that her allowance would barely pay for
two summer gowns from Donavan or Con
nelly, but by careful management she
could every season t\ke two dozen gowns
with her to the springs, one dozen being
made-overs. Of course this bright maiden
was herseif a clever designer and a needle
woman of ability and so was able to guide
and direct into proper channels the abili
tiespf an expert little dressmaker. I know
two sisters in Oakland wno are invariably
well >jowned ; indeed their dresses have an
indescribable cachet, which has made
several of their friends sufficiently
bold to inquire what dressmak r they
patronized. The reply is invariably
the same: "Oh, we have a French
woman come and sew by the day, but
we could not really recommend her, she
makes such awful mistakes." Then they
change the subject, and leave us mystified,
for we are dying to secure that woman
mistakes and all, as the results are so ex
cellent, for we feel as ttiougn we could
achieve wonders could we but capture her.
The trouble is that just as soon as a dress
maker is competent she starts for herself,
so we cannot overaopreciate the clever
needle-woman who will sew by the day ;
but I am far from discouraging home
dressmaking, as I have seen too many de
iiehtful gowns to do anything of the sort,
fÂ«>r skillful lingers and a quick apprecia
tion of beautiful outlines and combinations
will produce results that cannot be rivaled.
Socially for many of us there is a lull,
and ;i3 much of our pleasure may depend
on a proper supply of frocks we cannot too
soon betrin investigating our wardrobes,
for in California our season of bright,
warm days is a long one. Every year our
girls are dressing with more taste, al
though, to be sure, even the most admired
and best gowned of our belles cannot be
said to prepare as elaborate or as exten
sive outfits for the summer as their
Eastern sisters, who, for example, wore
last summer at Newport gowns of the
richest faille, simply but exquisitely made,
for afternoon toilets. I hear that many
are weary of serge yachting dresses and
intend to have alpaca instead. I can only
say they will probably regret the change
of fabric. Such costumes have a blouse
coat with a collar of the best white taffeta
fancifully cut. These are belted with gold
ribbon.
Some will continue to wear white duck,
which is to be had this year in the finest
of qualities, which compare favorably
with Irish linen. Be sure to have the
duck shrunk at home before making it up.
White leather belts will be seen with
such dresses, and they are to be made
with a belted coat, which must droop over
the belt all around. All the seams are
strapped, but the collar and revers are
simply stitched.
With white seme, alpaca and duck
powns are to be worn separate waists of
Japanese silk of natural colors and de
signs. They are made up very full in ac
cordion pleating, with a stock and cuffs of
white satin ribbons. Persian crepes will
be used for the same purpose in soit light
shades. A touch of gold will be one of
the novelties of the season, for we are to
have gold belts, gold insertions, gold lace,
and all the silver buckles are being
washed with gold.
Bishop sleeves will be cross barred with
insertion in all cases where it appears ou
the waist.
Summer skirt 9 will not measure over six
yards and will flare about the feet. Many
are not to measure over five.
The blouse coat will be the thing this
season. It is a loose affair with but few
seams, usually only those under the
arms, unless a large bust compels darts in
front. It extends to about four inches
below the belt and is drawn in shape by
the belt. The front is ornamented by
shawl reveres and the collar turns down
widely. The sleeves may be either gigot
or bishop.
The tichu is to be a favored accompani
ment of not only evening, but day gowns
as well, and the corselet will be in vo^ue.
For evening wear, infinitesimally dotted
muslins, fine nets, Russian nels and em
broidered mousselines de soie will be in
great demand. Black Russian net is used
effectively on a black evening toilet, as it
forms beautiful transparent sleeves. It is
also used with white silk.
Embroideries of tne richest description
are to be used. Emeralds, being popular,
are seen in combination with jet and gold
thread as an insertion on Paris gowns
from celebrated houses.
A sweet-faced belle is having a delight
fully pretty gown made at home. The
skirt is of a pretty torquoise blue French
silk crepon, which looks like accordion
pleating. It is made over a plain taffeta
silk of the same shade. The waist is lined
with the silk, completely covered in front
with white silk, which in turn is covered
with fluffy white chiffon, layers upon
layers, which produces a cloudy effect.
The back and sleeves are of the crepon.
Around the waist is a narrow white satin
ribbon, which terminates in a small chow
in front. Extending down the middle of
A CHIC EVENING BODICE.
the white front is a single row of two-inch
wide gold insertion. A dear bit of a
chapeau of a darker but perfectly har
monious shade of blue has a quilling of
chiffon around it and a great white
aigrette at one side. .
I am really sorry to announce the fact,
but our balloon sleeves are to go and the
moderately close style will be shortly
correct, so wait for the latest news from
Paris before having your sleeves cut.
A3l full-dress skirts are finished with
double and triple ruchings of satin, three
or four rows being laced one above the
other, shading or mixing the colors to suit
the gown material. They made a dainty
and effective finish and" keep the shirts
well out.
It seems almost an impossibility that
this season the gowns are to be" more
ethereal and charming than those of last
year, yet I predict that they are to be
more beautiful than ever. What delight
ful surprises Paris has in store for us can
only be vaguely imagined, and as yon may
observe I have only been advocating the
making of simple frocks during the'next
six weeks, for not until. Lent is over shall
we see the gowns which will, of course, be
too sweet for anything, and the most be
witching of hats and bonnets will figure in
our happiest dreams.
So strong is the hold of the fancy bodice
that although it has been laughed to
scorn by many of the best dressmakers
and declared to be entirely out of style
still it flourishes, but those who desire to
be in style will no longer indulge in
startling contrasts, for tne skirt and
waist show a tendency to "tone in."
A white and maize striped bodice lately
worn was noticeable on account of its
sleeves, which were apparently long,
square ruffles, very full, falling from the
shoulders to the elbows.
Vogue gives an account of a club well
worth our consideration, so I will quote:
''A novel form of club, and one that prom
ises to be in much favor during the com
ing Lenten season, is the so-called Lunch
eon Club. Eight or ten women agree to
read certain works of modern fiction, and
further agree to discuss them at a series of
luncheons given by the members of the
club on any day of the week chosen for the
meetings. It is a good way of making
one's self thoroughly acquainted with
some good books, and, provided the
works are fitly chosen, they make pleasant
topics of discussion. The luncheons are
limited in length, and the introduction of
topics foreign to the novel under discus
sion is strictly forbidden."
At the reception given by President and
Mrs. Cleveland to the officers of the army
and navy Mrs. Cleveland id reported by
till who saw her to have been "radiantly
beautiful." Her gown was of white flow
ered silk, combined with pink velvet. Her
diamonds were excellent, but beat of all
was her bright, happy smile, which never
fided, even after being grasped by the
hand by over a thousand guests, which, to
say the least, must be a wearisome per
formance; and to most she made some
happy remark, and to all questions replied
with much tact.
The east room must have been a beauti
ful sight, the decorations being stars and
anchors, wrought in flowers and lights,
the anchors being in red blossoms and the
stars were produced bf electric lights â
red, white and blue onesâ and some one
who was present writes: Beyond this
room the nitrht was turned into summer,
not on a limited scale, but, so great is the
space and so profuse the abundance, that
if one lingered he would forget that there
was ever winter, hyacinths nodding their
prrfumed greeting, almost as thickly
strewn as spears of grass; orchids, far
thicker than pitcher plants in summer;
lilies and roses of the most delicious fra
grance, as well as innumerable blossoms
of less bounteous delicacy; vines fit to
earland fairies' dresses, foliage plants in
thickets of charmine arrangement in form
and shading, and, towering above all, the
majestic grace of the palm trees.
All around the exclamation was freely
tossed about, "Was ever anything more
beautiful, and did you ever the White
House as fascinating as it is to-night?"

TOR MEN.
Many of our bicycle riders look very
smart in their knickerbockers, long Scotch
stockings, Norfolk jackets and peaked
caps.
For evening wear our ties must be of
fine hue, one and a half inches wide.
The butterfly tie is a style long passed.
The style in evening dress is slowly but
surely changing, for many pleated and
ruffled shirts have been worn this winter
in NÂ«w York, and what is more they have
been considered smart, and white silk
waistcoats have been worn in even larger
numbers.

pinks and blues in voiriie, but there are
also exhibited the most vivid and startling
greens and yellows. Very few men can
wear, even should they wish, a trrass or
pea-green shirt, and fewer yet of us can
stand yellow. The satin finish, however

LOVE AND SPRING.
Love's clear eves shone with pride;
He laid his bow aside,
Flung wide the arrows from their sheath.
As joyously he spied beneath
Trie dancing bough on which he swung
Bright pearls upon the violets hung
That blossomed sweet
Beneath his feet.
Spring from her bough above
Looked laughing down on Lots,
And chid him for a wanton boy,
Because of such au idle toy.
He laid aside those piercing darts
Wherewith to vanquish human heart!,
To deck his curls
With gleaming pearls.
"Nay! Know ye not. O Spring,
This Is no childish thing.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 29. - An unsettled
feeling appeared in the wheat market this morn
ing, the bulls ever waiting, and looking for some
thing new to help along the advance, and the bears
show reluctance in attempting anything savoring
of aggressiveness. Holders exDressed some disap
pointment at the small volume of exports from
both coasts for the week, 2,206,000 bushels, and a;
an easy Liverpool market. Northwestern receipts
were also a source of discouragement, 490 cars
arriving against 489 last Saturday and 302 a year
ago. Shortly after the opening, which was lower !
on the matters just mentioned, a report of ten loads j
taken for export caused prices to spring back to j
t!;.' Dosition held at the close yesterday, but, on I
denial of the statement the strength abated and !
prices again receded. Chicago receipts were 93 j
cars and 87,611 bushels were withdrawn from |
store. New York's failure to clear any wheat was !
net a reassuring bull argument- Total Atlantic
seaboard clearances of wheat and Hour aggregated
â _ IS..V-2 bushels. Closing Continental cables were
irregular. May wheat opened from 675/sC to i
67 V' s c, advanced to 673/ie. closing at <j7y 2 .-.,-.
Vs'fi'Vic under yesterday. Estimated receipts for |
Monday 66 cars."
CORNâ Began to-day with a fractional loss,
larger receipts than expected, .358 cars, and the
weakness of wheat, counting against Drices. The
subsequent rally in wheat permuted of a recovery
in earn, but later another slight decline took place.
Withdrawals irom store were 185,803 bushels.
Liverpool cables were quiet and steady.
Export clearances were 289,024- bushels.
May corn opened at 305 @303ic, sold at 30.v 8 c
and' 30=Â«/4C, closing at 305.'8@30Â»- 4 c, a shade under
yesterday. Estimated receipts ior Monday 280 j
cars.
OAT?â The half-holiday session afforded an ex- I
cuse for inaction In oats. The normal condition of (
thÂ« market being dull today's inactivity attracted :
no unusual attention. Receipts were 341 cars, j
; There were no withdrawals from store. May oats ;
â  closed unchanged from yesterday. Estimated re- j
1 ceipts for Monday 250 cars.
i FLAXâ Was steady: cash, 90c; May, 90 1 Â»c
bid. Receipts were 1 8 cars.
PROVISIONSâ a light run of hogs caused a ;
fairly active market, prices ruling fairly steady.
May pork closed 10c higher than yesterday, May
lard and May ribs each 5@7y 3 c Higher.

! COFFEEâ C. E. Blckford's circular says: "We
have to note a further drop of s /4 c in the price of
good unwashed Salvador, due to the steady pres
sure by importers to sell on a dull and unwilling
market. While a shrinkage had been .generally
anticipated, the rapidly of the decline was wholly
unexpected and has unsettled all classes of Coffee
for the time being. Dealers, becoming discouraged
at finding each transaction productive of an imme
diate loss, are buying most sparingly. Very little
has been done in other descriptions, which, of
course, are easier all around in sympathy with Sal
vador. The overland movement has also been
small. To-day's stock is 286 bags Costa Rica, 30
Nicaragua, 2610 Salvador, 7831 Guatemala and
353 Mexicanâ in all 11.009 bags. The steamer
Colon is due March 2 with 6550 bags." We quo;e:

MANY DOCTORS
TO BE ARRESTED
The Health Department Will
Enforce Birth Reg
istration.
GATHERING EVIDENCE.
The Very Poor Showing Made
Against the Recorded
Death Rate.
LAWS GOVERNING THE MATTER
Physicians Will Fight the Measure to
the Bitter End in the
Courts.
"Within a short time, possibly within a
week-. 'a number of prominent physicians
of this City who have been under surveil
lance for some time past, will be arrested
on warrants sworn out by the Health De
partment, charging them with violation
of section 5024 of the Political Code and"
of order 2341 of the Board of Supervisors.
TJueselaws refer to the registration of
births.by physicians and midwives, a mat
ter-that has "been a thorn in the side of the
present Board of Health ever since the
members bepan to realize that the show
ing of their reportsâ that more people die
in San Francisco every month than are
bornâ is giving Fan Francisco an undesir
able reputation as being a good place to
stay away from. The laws regulating the
registration of births are as follows:
BECTIOX 3024, POLITICAL CODE OF CALIFORNIA.
Section 302-1. Physicians and midwives must
on or before the fourth day ol each month
make a return to the Health Officer of ail j
liirths. deaths and the number of stillborn j
children occurring in their practioe during the |
preceding month. In the absence ot such at
tendants the parent must make such report
â¢within thirty days after the birth of 6uch child.
Such returns must be made in accordance with
rules adopted and upon blanks furnished by
the Board of Health.
Order 2341, Board of Supervisorsâ Sec. 1.
Physicians and midwives must on" or before the
fourth day of each month make a return to the i
Health Oflicer of all births occurring in theii
practice during t?ie preceding montn. In the
absence of such attendants the parent must
make such report within thirty days after the j
birth of the child. Such returns must be made
in accordance witn the rules adopted and upon
bianks furnished by the Board oi Health.
Bee. SL Any person violating any of the pro- j
visions o-f this order shall be deemed guilty of
ft misdemeanor, and be punished by a tine not I
exceeding $100 or by imprisonment not ex
ceeding ninety days, or by both such fine and j
imprisonment.
Of course, as a matter of fact the birth j
rate of Sari Francisco is greater than the (
death rate and would appear so if the |
physicians- of the City lived up to the
Jaws quoted, but they do not, and out of. j
all the large cities in the Union San Fran- !
cisco appears to be the only one where the
death rate is the greater.
The Board of Health has beer, making
desperate efforts to induce physicians to
live up to the law. Notices have been sent
them to conform to the regulations and
special inducements have even been of- ;
fered to bring the registrations in, but I
without effect.
Now the board has determined on dras- I
tic measures, and evidence is already on j
hand sufficient to convict half a dozen of
the medicos who have neglected their
duties. Some days ago Deputy Health
Officer Jones, under the orders of Health
Officer Lovelace, began a quiet hunt for
evidence, and thus far has had no diffi
culty in linding it.
Out of the daily papers he cuts the
birth notices inserted by proud and fond
lathers, and calls on the family in which
the ne?y-comer has arrived. Usually no
difficulty is encountered in ascertaining
the name of the physician in attendance,
and a record is made of the fact.
Unless the physicians who have the
black marks against their names live up
to the law and report within the time re
quired by the statute the names of all in
lants at whose births they have officiated
warrants will be issued against them, and
they will be compelled to stand trial in
the Police courts. The Health Depart
ment positively declines to make public
the names of the physicians who will be
arrested until the warrants are issued.
An interesting little legal fight between
the Board of Health and the members of
the medical profession who are arrested
is likely to occur, as the physicians have
determined to resist the order. They claim
that the board has no right to compel
them to register births as they receive no
compensation for so doing. "They claim
that it is the duty of the parents of the
child to go through the necessary form.
The board, on the other hand, "is as fully
determined that tne Jaw must be obeyed,
and will have its attorney, Dennis Spencer,
on hand to see that the case is given every
attention.
The death and birth rates, made up in
the Health Office yesterday, make it ap
pear as usual that the former exceeded the
latter. Tabulated they are as follows:
Female. Hale. Total.
Deaths....... 178 305 483
Births 191 alB 409
Excess of deaths over births 74
It is this state of affairs that the Health
Department desires to remedy.
CHARGED WITH MURDER
Nicholas Claussen Is Found Guily
by the Coroner's
Jury.
He Shot His Wife Down in Cold Blood.
Says He Did It for
Fun.
:. â¢ â
The Coroner's jury in the case of Nich
olas Claussen, who shot and killed his
â wile at 12 Everett street on February 25,
held the husband for his crime. The ver
dict of the jury was to the effect that the
deceased came to her death through a gun
shot wound inflicted by Nicholas Claussen.
Officer John Moriarity testified that he
arrested Claussen after the shooting, and
being asked why be had shot his wife the
prisoner answered, "For fun." Later
Claussen said that his wife had abused
him. The woman died in the patrol
wagon on the way to the Receiving Hos
pital.
Mrs. Ellen Foley, landlady of the house
where the tragedy occurred, stated that on
one occasion Claussen and bis wife had a
dispute over the possession of their chil
dren and that the former struck the
â¢woman and tore off her veil. Thirty min
utes alter this incident Claussen returned
and fired the fatal shots.
Clausren will now be held and tried on a
charge of murder.

PHYSICAL CULTURE FOR WOMEN.
What Is Being Accomplished in Our Local Gymnasiums.
THE progressive spirit of San Fran
cisco women is shown in their in
terest in physical culture. Physi
cal culture, the dilettante call it.
"Body building/ say the in
structors who bear the brawn and bloom
of Old World vijror. "Harmonious devel
opment" is the adaptation made by those
who like the flow of liquid polysyllable.
But whether it be minimized by being
styled "recreation," or dignified by the
ambitious title of "athletics," San Fran
cisco women are fuliy alive to the fact that
it supplies a need, and with characteristic
earnestness are setting to work to fill it.
The "blue" days of the sex have well
nigh passed. "With the dawn of an era of
physical perfection the gloom of that con
dition the poet describes in the dreary
line, "Men must work and women must
weep," is disappearing.
The healthy, hearty, bright-eyed women
who swing Indian clubs manipulate chest
extenders, climb ladders hand-over-hand
and take brerfthing exercises daily have
neither time nor inclination for heatry
eyed retrospective and introspective
moods. They laugh and the world laughs
with them in the joyousness of their new
found strength.
Perhaps the strongest as well as the
oldest organization of women for the pur
suit of athletics in this City is the
ladies' class of the Olympic Club, it was
formed when William Greer Harrison was
president of the club, and his daughter,
Miss Mary Harrison, was the first of its
presiding officers. She was- succeeded by
Miss Fannie Crocker, who was followed
by Mrs. W. A. Swinnerton. Mrs. W. A.
Davis, the fourth president of the class
and the incumbent, is a prominent
member of the Sorosis. The personnel
includes: Mrs. George L. Smith, Mrs. Mc-
Donald, Mrs. M. H. de Youncr, Mrs. F. W.
Eaton, Mrs. C. A. Low. Mrs. H. S.
Thompson, Mrs. J. B. Gill, Mrs. Miner,
Miss Bessie Fonda, Miss Daisy Byrne, the
Misses Cassell, Miss Farquharson,
THE CLUB EXERCISE AT THE Y. M. C. A. GYMNASIUM.
[From a photograph by Thors.]
I^HE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1896.
Mrs. C. H. Crowell, Mrs. John Critcher
and tne Misses Denison. Of these Mrs.
\V. A. Davis. Mrs. C. H. Crowell, Mrs.
John Critcher, Miss Bessie Fonda and
the Misses Demson constitute the ad
visory committee. Mrs. T. C. Eager is the
secretary.
The interest in the departments of ex
ercise are pretty equally divided between
the swimrning-tanli and the gymnasium.
Fencing, under Professor Tronchet's in
struction, has a goodly number of de
votees. The Misses Cassell are among the
adepts of the foil. Mrs. J. B. Gill and
Mrs. Miner are enthusiastic swimmers
and Miss Daisy Byrne cne of the most
graceful of the ciass. Miss Fonda and
Miss Farquharson are equally skillful as
fencers and swimmers. There is much en
tnusiasm on the part of the members, as
well as a great deal of good-natured ri
valry.
The membership list includes nearly 100
names that figure prominently in local
society and art annals.
The costumes of the ladies differ accord
ing to individual taste, some being very
â natty, and all adapted to the needs of the
occasion and the wearer.
The handsome clubhouse at 524 Post
street has luxurious appointments for the
accommodation of its fair members, the
gymnastic apparatus being especially
noteworthy.
The Ladies' Club in physical culture and
swimming, which meets at the Young
Men's Christian Association on Wednes
day and Saturday mornings from 9 to 12
o'clock, numbers nearly 100 students of
the theory and art of physical develop
ment. The gymnasium and pool are their
"very own on the days mentioned, and
an hour and a half of exercise, vigorous
or light, according to the needs of the
pupil, precedes a swim, from which the
dames and damsels emerge as fresh and
glowing and almost as fair as Aphrodite
rising from the sea.
Professor John Schenck, physical di
rector of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation, believes that normal development
of the body is a sovereign promoter of
grace.
"My work is body-building," he says.
"It is a simple expression, yet its forctf
grows upon me." Building the body,
strengthening the weak places, drawing
away from a congested organ its super
fluity of nutriment and supplying the defi
ciency to some atrophied member, teach
ing the lungs to do their task thoroughly,
not in the indolent manner of the past,
making the flabby heart' strong and firm
once more â such is Professor Schenck's
mission, and well does he fulfill it.
Professor Schenck is a small, muscular
man with the direct, forceful manner that
characterizes moat instructors in athletics.
"I believe in keeping young," he said.
"The years make no difference if we re
main strong. Women could remain youth
ful for an incredible time if they would do
away with nervousness, weak lungs and
sick headaches. There is no reason why
a woman should be exhausted by climbing
stairs or by a short walk.
"But, yes! There is a reason. They
have no freedom. Women should be free,
I say, free. There is no reason why my
daughter should not turn a handspring or
a somersault if she chooses. I want to see
corsets give way and bloomers gain
ground. Woman should wear bloomers at
all times, on the street and elsewhere. If
she wants to conform to the passing styles
she may wear a skirt over them. Tho
trouble with women is they have little or
no muscular development and are feeding
upon their nervous forces. They are
almost to a man, or to a woman, I mean,
very backward in upper chest dovelop

merit. Human beings should respire in
the long, deep, regular way that cows and
horses do."'
A class of young women was doing some
skillful fencing at the Columbia Scnool of
Dramatic Art yesterday morning under
the direction of Professor Tronchet.
"Lungo! :> shouted the director, and the
fair fencers made what appeared to be
perilous passes at each other. *
"Guard!" and they. warded off a threat
ening blow. But always, whether the
movements were swift or slow, they were
grace itself. Authorities agree that no
art, not even dancing, is so calculated to
develop grace, ease and repose of manner.
It is said to be likewise a valuable aid in
training the mental faculties in requiring
concentration. The young women enjoyed
the drill. A glance at their smiling faces
was proof conclusive of this.
The misses' ana women's classes of the
turn verein have reached a large member
ship. Every Tuesday and Thursday the
misses' class meets there for instruction
and on Wednesday evening the women
enjoy the pleasures of the drill. Robert
Barth, the turn verein instructor, is the
supervisor of physical culture in the public
schools* The gymnasium has a full equip
ment of swinging poles, ladders, cross and
horizontal bars and all the apparatus need
ful to aid nature in her task of develop
ment. A slender maiden climbed one of
the slanting ladders hand over hand and
swinging the body from side to side with
the agility and grace of a squirrel, while
Mr. Barth explained his theory of physical
training.
"I do not aim to make athletes of girls
and women," he said. "A healthy body
and graceful carriage are the objects to be
attained, and to those ends I labor.
Dumbbell and wand exercises, marching
and dancing are the chief aids in the
work."
What is known as the Woman's Club for
Physical Culture, in charge of Mrs. George
S. Miehling, is very popular at the Mis
sion. The club is increasing in member
ship and interest, owing not only to Mrs.
Miehling's ability and conscientiousness
as an instructor, but to the advantages of
her excellently equipped gymnasium.
Among the apparatus shown to visitors
is a pair of tiny dumbbells, weighing less
than a quarter of a pound, which are the
property of Master Georgie Miehling, a
gymnast of eighteen months.
Attention is given to physical culture in
all the departments of the public schools.
At the Horace Mann bchool George S.
Miehling, instructor in wrestling at the
Olympic Club, gives military and gymnas
tic drills, and in a competitive drill at that
school last summer the girls bore off the
laurels. The private schools are, a3 a rule,
well equipped for such pursuits, and many
homes in the City boast their gymnasium.
Paris has at the prosent time about 130
females registered as medical students.
THEIR FIFTIETH CONCERT
The Carr-Beel Organization Cele
brates Its Musical
Jubilee.
Enthusiastic Subscribers Organize a
Reception After the Per
formance. " ;
Quite a. festive event was made 61 the
jubilee Carr-Beel concert, which . took
place yesterday afternoon in Golden Gate
Hall. â¢ â¢ . â¢ . _ ;
For" five years the artists of the Carr-
Beel organization have been . giving con
certs of a high standard of excellence, and
yesterday their many friends showed that â¢;
they were not unappreciative of the work
done. â. Â . ;â¢. â 
There was a bie audience, which ex
erted itself vigorously in the f matter of
making applause. Mrs. Carmichael Carr
was literally overwhelmed with flowers,
and at the conclusion of the concert about
half the listeners adjourned en masse to
the parlors and the foyer, where a pleasant
informal reception was held, : under the
auspices of Mrs. David Bixler, Mrs. Oliver.
Perry Evans and Mrs. Charles "Webb
Howard. 'â¢â¢â¢.. ;-.â¢'.' .. = ,'.
Perhaps it would be more correct to say â¢
that the artists received their friends in
the parlors, and those visitors .who had; to*'
await their turn to get in, on account of ;
the crush, held an overflow reception in \.
the foyer. â¢ â¢ â â¢ '.' ..-. â  â¢;â¢_
Artistic programmes of the fiftieth Sat
urday Popular Concert had been" designed
by Bruce Porter and the contents, of the
programme were as satisfactory as. its ex- !.
ternal â  appearance. - The Signiund .': Beel
String Quartet played the opening num
ber, a quartet in F, op. 96, by Dvorak. As
usual the performance . was delightfully
finished and artistic, but the satisfaction
with which * the ; audience J listened to â¢ the
muÂ«ic was chastened by regret, for. Louis .
Heine, the 'cellist, was playing for the last
time, during this season at least, with the
Sigrnund Beel Quartet. .' .â¢
â  :Â» The other concerted number was a septet
for piano, strings and trumpet by Saint-
Saens. The whole work was very effective, s
the intermezzo and the gavotte and finale ;
especially so. and the execution left noth
ing to be desired. Mrs. Carr, the pianist,
especially,; distinguished herself and Mr.
j Keller's trumpet was, almost as sweet in
its . tone .as a - good human voice. The
other players in the septet were: Sigmund
Beel, first :- violin; John Josephs,, second
violin; rÃernatJaulus, viola; Louis Heine,
cello, and F.Spiller.' contra basso. ' .
ftigmund Beel played Tartini's exacting
violin? solo, 'II Trillo del Diavolo," in a
masterly manner. Its execution was al
most jocose in its ease, and his intonation
was of- that perfect order which ;; leaves: no"
shadow of anxiety in the listeners'. minds.
In response to a very determined 1 encore
Mr. Beel play the sextet from "Lucia,"
arranged as a violin solo. . ':â ' '.' â¢ ' p ;*,;
" Charles J. Dyer, : the vocalist of the con
cert, proved to be a pleasant, accom
plished singer oi German lieder. j He gave
a: cluster of Schumann songs in , the
language of the .Fatherland. â¢.
Recognized a Friend.
When a party of Italian visitors were on
board the Colombo by special invitation on
Friday Prince Louis Savoy recognized one of
the party, V. Ursumando, a local musician, as
having been the music teacher of his two
brothers, the Duke of Aosta and Prince Victor
in Turin. The young officer at once recalled
himself to the musician's memory, and lead
ing the way to his cabin, showed itie latest por
traits of his visitor's ex-pupils, at the same
time recalling many phases of his childhood
with which Mr. Lrsumando was acquainted
and demanded an account of how theTurinese
musician had left home and come to practice
music in America.
