VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 11.
REED OUT OF THE RACE
McKinley's Nomination on
First Ballot Conceded
by Manley.
BDT MAINE'S FAVORITE SON WILL NEVER ACCEPT
THE SECOND PLACE.
California's Contested Seats Will Be Decided
by the Republican National Committee
To-Dayâ A "Sound Money"
Platform â Hobart for
Vice-President.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., June 10.â The friends
of Speaker Reed have given up the fight.
When the National Committee tooK a re
cess at 6 o'clock this evening Hon. Joseph
Manley of Maine dictated the following to
the representative of the United Press, and
revised it prior to transmission:
"In my judgment the convention will
nominate Governor McKinley on the first
ballot for tne Presidency. It is useless to
deny that this will be the result.
"The action of the National Committee
in its overwhelming vote on the Alabama
case settles conclusively how the respective
States which the members of the commit
tee represent will vote in the convention.
"Mr. Reed's name will be presented to
the convention and he will be voted for,
and 1 am authorized to say that under no
circumstances can he, or will he, accept
tne nomination for Vice-President if it
should be tendered to him.
"The great majority of the New England
delegates will be loyal to Mr. Reed, but
it is evident that the convention is for
McKinley and will nominate him."
ALL OVER BUT SHOUTING.
'â¦ Honorable Mention" the Fate of
Ali but McKinley.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June JO.â The very
bphous businos? of selecting a candidate
for tne highest office within the gift of
seventy millions of people is practically
concluded. What follows will be the
mere official recording of the votes and
the shouting, and the distinguished men
who entered as competitors against the
Ohio man of destiny will be forced to ac
cept the small satisfaction of "honor*
able mention," on the first ballot. All this
is so apparent that no one risks even a
doubt of it. Friends of the minority can
didates are whistling through the grave
yard of impending defeat, and hoping
that "something may happen."
Somethi ng has happened, but not to the
liking of the minority. It has transpired
that the McKinley contested delegates will
be seated in the convention and will assist
in the temporary organization. First
possession will mean a title in fee to these
seats after the credentials committee has
reported and the permanent organization
is effected.
The atmosphere about the various head
quarters that was so strongly impregnated
bas undergone a change. It is not diffi
cult to analyze this transmutation of met
als. Whereas the early arrivals were from
the Western States and Territories, where
every tone is silver, the arrivals to-day
were from the Atlantic seaboard ami the
New England States, where gold is a sa
cred dogma of faith. There was lots of
silver and more of gold in the exchanges
of opinions to-day. Primarily and finally
all are Republicans, and while the dele
gates from these sections wide'.y differ on
finances it is believed from developments
to-day that the earlier threats to bolt com
ing from botn sides were biank cartridges
fired to test the purpose of the opposition.
This easing off in the talk of bohinjr has
smoothed the way to a better understand
ing and the platform-makers' work is
made eaÃier. The California, Utah, Ne
vada and other Western deienations have
not entirely abandoned the fight and are
preparing a sil7er resolution to be pre
sented to the committee on platform.
Colonel Isaac Trumbo of Salt Lake has
the resolution in charge and will advocate
its adoption by the committee.
The magnificent Auditorium in which

acoustic proderties of the Auditorium and j
they were pronounced "perfect. The hall
seats 14,125 persons and the chairs are so
arranged as to give every occupant an un
obstructed view of the chairman's desk.
Many of the politicians who form the
advance guard of the convention were
present at the ceremonies to-night. The
question of hotel accommodations for the
colored delegates reached a crisis this
afternoon ami a speedy solution was de
manded by those committeemen having
the matter in charge. Manager Henry C.
Lewis of the Southern Hotel was appealed
to and after a hasty consultation with a
number of hotel proprietors the following
statement was given out:
"To the National Republican Committee:
In regard to the accommodations for the
colored delegate? to the Republican Con
vention to be furnished by the hotels of St.
Louis and promised by the Business Men's
League of St. Louis while in Washington
last December, I am authorized to say that
the Southern Hotel, the St. Nicholas Hotel,
the Lindell Hotel and the Laclede Hotel
will live up to that promise m spirit and
letter and will make no distinction what
ever, but will grant to all delegates to the
.Republican Convention equal rights and
privileges. Respectfully,
"W. R. Allen,
"President Southern Hotel Company."
The friends of Major McKinley are in
overwhelming control of the National
Committee. This was demonstrated at its
meeting to-day, first in the adoption by a
practically unanimous vote of Powell
Clayton's resolution to hear the contests
in committee of the whole instead of re
ferring them to sub-committees appointed
in accordance with precedent by the Na
tional chairman, and again in the vote on
the numerous contests from Alabama.
With >ut a single exceptionâ and this in a
case where by a different vote the commit
tee would have been compelled to reverse
a decision rendered a half hour before â all
the contestants of McKinley proclivities
were seated.
The first test vote stood 38 to 7 and after
this the friends of Reed, Morton and Alli
son made but a show of fight for the con
testing delegates that favored their respec
tive principals.
When the committee took a recess at 6
o'clock Mr. Manley, in a statement to the
United Press, practically abandoned the
field, so far as concerned Mr. Reed, to the
Ohio candidate. The supporters of the fav
orite sons of New York and lowa, while un
willing to go upon record in terms as em
phatic as those of the man from Maine,
admitted that the showing made in tne
National Committee was unexpected and
practically settled the nomination for the
head of tne ticket.
Intense interest was manifested in the
proceedings of the committee to-day,
which for the first time in its history ad
mitted representatives of the press as
sociations to its deliberations. The cor
ridors outside the clubroom of the
Southern Hotel, as well as the adjoining
parlors, were thronged with delegates and
political visitors from abroad. When the
vote on seating the McKinley delegates-at
large from Alabama was brought out
1 there was considerable enthusiasm and a
rush for the other hotels. W T ithin a few
minutes the news had been spread over
the center of the town.
The first session of the National Com
mittee lasted less than an hour. Chair
man Carter called the members to order
at 12:15 o'clock in the clubroom of the
Southern Hotel. Secretary Manley called
the roll, and Indian Territory alone failed
to respond. Senator Gear was proxy for
James S. Clarkson of lowa, from whom a
telegram was received saying he had been
taken ill at Philadelphia while en route
and might not be able to get here at any
! stage of the proceedings. A committee
having been appointed to prepare resolu
tions of respect to the memory of ex-
National Committeeman W. J. Campbell
of Illinois, who passed away since the last
meeting of the body, the list of contests
was read.
At this stage Colonel R. C. Kerens of
this city submitted a resolution providing
for the presence at the secret meetings of
the committee of representatives of each
of the two press associations. This was
an infringement on the established prece
dent of the body, but Delegate Isaac
Trumbo of Salt Lake supported it in a
few vigorous remarks, and it went through
unanimously.
A motion to take up the question of
Territorial representation was ruled out
by the chair on the ground that the Terri
tories must be reached in proper order, and
it was then decided to take up the con
tests, beginning with Alabama, this after
noon, and a recess was taken until 2 p. m.
When the committee reassembled at 2
o'clock the Alabama contests were taken
up without delay. David D. Shelby pre
sented the case of the regular delegates
at-large, David D. Shelby, C. W. Buckley,
John W. Jones and W. H. Pattiford, repre
senting the Vaughan wing of the party,
while the interests of the contestants, ex-
Governor William A. Smith, J. F. Mc-
Duffie, A. J. Warner (colored) and W. H.
Nivon, were looked after by ex-Chairman
Mosely and the venerable ex-Governor
himself. The entire issue turned upon the
right of the executive committee to make
up a temporary roll for the State Conven
tion and the regular delegates scored a
point by producing a telegram sent by
National Chairman Carter, on the night
before the convention, in response to an
inquiry, in which he said it was the cus
tom of the National Committee to make
up the roll, and that the chairman and
secretaries of State and National commit
tees were only the servants of those elect
ing or appointing them.
Heated speeches were made on both
sides and as soon as the contestants had
withdrawn Powell Clayton moved that
the Buckley delegation be placed on the
temporary roll. Senator Gear oi lowa
proposed as a substitute that the Smith or
Mosely delegation be seated, while W. A.
Sutherland wanted the entire matter re
ferred to a sub-committee of three to re
port on Thursday morning.
A suggestion from Senator Shoup of
Idaho that each delegate be given a half
vote in the interest of harmony was met
by so many cries of "No," and "That's
not the way to eet harmony," that it was
not pressed. Sutherland's substitute was
voted down with a shout and then the roll
was called on the main question. Thirty
four delegates voted to seat the Buckley
itcs and six the other way. By some over
sight the secretary failed to call the State
of Maine, but the majority was so over
whelming that Mr. Manley did not call at
tention to the omission, although he said
afterward that he would have voted for
the contestants. The exact complexion of
the committee, therefore, the representa
tives of North Dakota, New Moxico, Okla
homa and Al&ska being absent, was 38 to 7.
Next in order was the contest in the
fourth Congressional District, where Con
gressman W. F. Aldrich and H. F. Curry
claimed precedence of the regular dele
gates, Thomas G. Dunn and William A.
Stevens. The latter, a bright colored man,
spoke for himself and his colleague, an ex-
Federal soldier and a member of Han
cock's staff, and despite a plausi hie state
ment from Representative Aldrich the
colored man made out so good a case that
the vote ts sustain the regular delegation
was unanimous.
There was applause when it was an
nounced that the Sixth District contest
had been abandoned.
The Fifth District was passed until
Thursday.
In the Seventh District Charles D. Alex
ander and John S. Curtis, the regular

DECLINES TO TAKE SECOND PLACE.
delegates, told a story of attempted riot
and threatened bloodshed at the district
convention, while the contestants, Frank
M. Morgan and John I. Guzzell, sought to
put another face on the matter.
When the room had been cleared Com
mitteeman Payne of Milwaukee expressed
the opinion that the time had come to
frown upon such convention methods as
those that had been narrated, and sug
gested that both regulars and contestants
be excluded from ihe regular roll. Com
mitteeman Hahn, however, moved to seat
Alexander and Curtis, and there were but
four voices in the negative.
The Eighth District contest was with
drawn and the names of the regular dele
gales â W. W. Simmons and H. V. Cashin
â placed upon the roll.
In the Ninth District A. D. Wimbs (col
ored) and W. C. Hamlin, a Grand Army
veteran, both adherents of the Moseley
wing, contested the seats of J. W. Hughes
and W. L. Sauuders. State Chairman
Vaughau made the argument for the lat
ter, while Moseley argued that what was
"sauce for the goose was sauce for the
gander," and that the committee could
not decid.e against the contestants in this
case without admitting that, the facts
being the same, it was wrong in the Sev
enth District contests. The committee
agreed with him, and Powell Clayton's
motion to seat the colored man and the
ex-Northern volunteer was carried with a
shout.
At 6:15 the committee took a recess until
Bp. M. Subsequently it was announced
that the Fifth District case would be
settled by arbitration. Of the regulars
and contestants one favors Allison, one
McKinley and two Reed.
When the committee reconvened at 8:15
o'clock the contest on delegates-at-large
from Florida and those in the Third and
Fourth districts of California were made
the special order for Thursday morning.
Georgia was next in order, and Chairman
Carter remarked, soto voce, as he sur
rendered the chair to M. H. de Young,
that at the present rate of progress the
committee would still be in session when
the convention assembled on Tuesday.
Only two seats of the four delegates-at
large from this State proved to be con
tested. R. R. Wright (colored), who at
the outset announced himself the original
McKinley champion of his State, opened
for the two contestants, himself and J. G.
Hetherington, an adherent of Senator
Allison, who were chosen at a second
State Convention, held after the first one
had adjourned.
W. H. Smythe replied in behalf of the
delegates attacked, J. U. Deveaux and H.
A. Rucker, and showed from the sworn
minutes that the two last named were se

lected by acclamation, the opposition mak
ing no protest until after the convention
had adjourned. This and other proof was
sufficient for the committee and by a un
animous vote Deveaux and Ruoker were
seaced. The other delegates-at-large are
A. G. Buck and H. L. Johnson.
In the First District of Georgia R. W.
"White and S. O. Cherry both (colored)
contested the seats of M. J. Boyle and S.
B. Morse (colored), who were chosen at
the regular convention. All four are Mc-
Kinleyites, the two latter having been
given instructions. Both sides were ac
corded a full hearing. I. W. Lyons of the
Tenth District, a colored delegate, aroused
interest by an earnest speech in behalf of
Boyle, who is an Irishman. Boyle and
Morse were seated, with five dissensions.
The Ninth Georgia District contest was
passed until to-morrow, and that in the
Eleventh District was taken up. In this
case the seats of S. M. Scarlett and Wil
liam Jones, both colored and instructed
for McKinley, were claimed by W T . H.
Matthews and D. Outlaw, also colored,
who were instructed for Reed by a conven
tion consisting of seven bolters.
Another exhaustive presentation of affi
davits and personal experiences of persons
present at the district convention was in
order and in the result Jones and Scarlett
were seated without about a half dozen
votes in the negative.
At 10:35 the first of the Kentucky con
tests was called, but several committee
men entered a protest against a midnight
session on the ground that they had been
on the road for from two to four nights
and needed rest, and an adjournment was
therefore taken until 10 a. m.
Each member of the National Commit
tee, as well as the leading delegates on the
ground, was furnished this afternoon with
a suggested monetary plank for the plat
form drawn up by Richard C. Kerens. It
reads as follows:
"We believe that our money should not
be inferior to the money of the most en
lightened nations of tne earth, and are
unalterably opposed to every scheme that
threatens to debase or depreciate our pres
ent monetary standard. We favor the
reasonable use of silver as currency, but
such use should be to the extent only and
under such well-defined regulation that
its parity with gold as currency can be
easily and efficiently maintained. As con
sistent bimetallists, we are opposed to the
independent free coinage of silver at a
ratio of 16 to las a measure fraught with
certain disaster to all commercial inter
ests, destructive to the interest of the
wage-earner and in the absence of inter
national agreement, sure to lead to silver
monometallism."
Mark Hanna is already taking a hand in

the financial tight and has set on foot a
strong movement for a compromise. This
afternoon he sent for a number of the
Southern delegates who are known to he
friendly to McKinley, and urged them not
to push their demands for a gold plank.
He fears a bis defection in the West, and
the whole power of the Ohio organization
will be used from this time on to prevent
the absolute overriding of the free coinage
Westerners.
The incoming crowds on the late trains
last night and those of the early morning
were so numerous as to take by surprise
the hotel people and the local committee
of arrangements, who, izoing by the re
ports from different parts of the country,
had been led to believe that it would be
late in the week before the visitors would
be very much in evidence.
Before the breakfast hour was over this
morning, however, four pages of freshly
written autographs had been added to the
convention register at the Southern.
About t:ie same number were recorded at
the Planters' and the Lindell. In the ro
tundas were the same ever changing
crowds, the same discussions, whispering
confabs, button-holemg and other incidents
I that are the invariable accompaniments of
a rally of political chieftains.
There were a score or more of old friends
and acquaintances at the Union station to
welcome the "head center" of Major Mc-
Kinley's campaign, Mark A. hanna, when
the Bee Line train from Cleveland pulled
in at 7:30.
With Him were General W. McKinley
i Osborne of Boston, the major's cousin;
1 Myron T. Herrick and Colonel Sylvester
Everett, delegates from Cleveland: W.;M.
Hahn of Mansfield and Oscar R. Meyer of
Portland, Or. Before he had time to
register at the Southern Hotel Mr. Hanna
was the center of a group of other dis
tinguished Republicans, among whom
were SamuelFessenden of Connecticut; M.
J. Dowling, president of the Minnesota
State League ; Henry _C. Payne of Mil
waukee, ex-Governor Fifer and Cantain
Tanner, the latter the eubernatorial nomi
nee in Illinois. There were greetings and
handshakes, and then, after a hurried,
I breakfast, Mr. Hanna betook himself to
j the private room of the McKinley head
quarters, on the parlor floor, and conferred
with Judge Thompson.
Then a messenger was sent in quest oi
J. N. Huston of Indianapolis, who, it is
undei stood, is authorized to speak for
Charles W. Fail banks of the same city,
regarding the presentation of the latter's
; name to the National Committe as a can
' didate for the temporary chairmanship of
I the committee. Mr. Huston, however,
was not to be found for the moment, and
Mr. Hanna turned to the task of greeting2
the crowd that besieged his apartment.
Prominent amonp; the callers were Gen
eral Garrett D. Hobart, delegate at large
from New Jersey, who is regarded as a
Vice-Presidential possibility; 6. H. Man
chester, secretary of tlie New York City Re
publican Committee, and Delegate R. B.
Renfro of Texas.
A signed statement, given to the
United Press last night by National Com
mitteeman M. H. de Young of San Fran
cisco, in which he declared that, while the
California delegates were instructed for
the free coinage of silver, they would not
bolt the convention in the event of the
gold standard element being supreme, was
one of the leading topics of discussion this
morning.
The stand taKen by the Californian was
indorsed by Senator Shoup of Idaho, who
gave it out flat-footed that, while his dele
gation was a free-silver one, pure and sim
ple, and would tight for a white-metal
plank in the platform, it would submit
with good grace to the will of the majority
and accept with the best possible grace
the decision of the convention. It was no
ticeable that the delegates on the ground
from Mississippi and Louisiana, who at
home are supposed to be ardent frec-sil
verites, are talking "sound money and
McKinley."
Delegate, Renfro of the Texas "Lily
Whites" was also loudly proclaiming that
the seated delegates from his State, no
matter who they might be, would be found
voting for the Ohio man and a clean-cut
declaration for sound money.
Among the late arrivals to-night were:
William H. Griffith, National committee
man from Arizona; General J. C. Wilson
of Delaware (the man wno captured Jeff
Davis); Hon. Anthony Higgins of Dela
ware; S.M.Barnes, National committee
man of Olahoma; Abner McKinley of
New York City, brother of Major McKin
ley; Hon. Charles M. Dawes, Evanston,
Illinois.
Following are expressions of opinion on
candidates and platform declarations
gathered about the hotels:
National Committeeman Hahn of Ohio:
"You can set it down as a positive fact
that McKinley will be nominated on the
first ballot, combination or no combina
tion. Nothing can stop it. The people
want McKinley and they are going to
have him."
Ex-Secretary of War Rcdfieid Proctor of
Vermont: "1 do not want to be Vice-
President of the United States. My name
shall never be presented for that office be-
Jore the Republican National Convention.
Republicanism of my State is five to one
for McKinley. He will surely win on the
first ballot."
James Francis Burke, assistant secre
tary of the National Committee : "Quay's
name will be presented and will receive
sixty votes on the first ballot. Further
than that I don't know what his course
will be. The Vice-Presidency will go to
Reed if he will have it. If not, I presume
some Western man who is sound on the
money question will be the nominee. I
do not think there will be any bolt by the
silver wing of the party, and prospects are
bright for an overwhelming victory."
National Committeeman David Martin
of Pennsylvania: "I think the platform
will be an out and out sound-money one.
1 don't think there is any doubt about that.
We don't concede that there will be any
bolts, and I hardly think there will be.
At any rate I do not think we have any
thing to fear. Threatened bolts are not
worrying us inth c least."
National Committeeman G. A. Hobart. of
New Jersey: "I am for McKinley. My
first choice for second place is Thomas B.
Reed, and if he will not accept, then I am
heartily in favor of some young Republi
can for the place. As for myself, lam be
ing mentioned for the place; and while I
am too modest to speak about my own
affairs, still my name will be presented to
the convention. I, as well as the New
Jersey delegation, am for sound money.
We have so declared. There will be no
bolt on the part of the Western States on
account of the money plank, which will be
for sound currency."
DELEGATES GETTING IN.
Scenes in the Lobbies of St. Louis
Hotels.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 10.â The tall and
ratner distinguished form of a coal black
man, his head topped with a shining silk
hat, towers above the straw hats, slouched
sombreros and derbys in the spacious lob
bies of the Southern Hotel. His short
hair and closely cropped side whiskers are
ns white as fcnow, and form a striking con
trast to lii 3 jet black skin. There are more
lhan 200 pounds of him. He is six feet
three inches in heicht, and he attracts
sdded attention because of the showy Al
lison badire which he displays on his vest
in the shape of a miniature reproduction
of the stars and stripes and a photograph
of the head of Senator Allison.
This colored man is Perry Carson of
Washington, D. C, the acknowledged
leader of the colored delegates, about a
score of whom have already arrived.
Although 61 years of age, he is as vigorous*
and active as a man of 40. When one con
verses with him for a while, he easily
understands the reason why Mr. Carson
stands in politics, on this occasion at least,
as the leader of his race. He has a deep,
manly voice, and is urbane and courteous.
His experience in politics dates back for
more than thirty-five years. He is proud
of telling how he attended, as a spectator,
the convention that nominated Abraham
Lincoln. He says, unlike the conventions
of the present day, full of bustle and
activity, it was rather tame and quiet. It
Beerned as though the actors in that
memorable drama were unconscious of the
deep significance of that nomination. Mr.
Carson is proud also of the fact that he
was born in Baltimore, Md., and that his
father's mother was a full blooded Black
hawk Indian of tnat State. He is also vain
of the fact that he never attended school,
but picked up his education by a kind of
inspiration, as he calls it.
Mr. Carson has held many offices of
trust and responsibility, having served as
messenger for the Governor before the
territorial form of government was abol
ished. He afterward held the office of
superintendent of fireplugs for several
years and was the deputy Marshal who
escorted Murderer Guiteau from jail to the
Courthouse in the prison van when an
overzealous United States soldier shot at
tbe prisoner. When the bullet tore
through the van Guiteau completely lost
las wits and turned a somersault in the
vehicle, almost breaking his neck.
Mr. Carson claims the honor of having
organized the Republican party of the
District of Columbia, so far as the colored
voters were concerned.
"I never bolted my party," he said, "and
I have a record that no other representa
tive negro has in this country. When I
was elected a delegate to Minneapolis it
was thought I was going to stand by Har
rison; but before I left Washington I said
I would support Blame if he would be a
candidate, and I did so. I am for Wil
liam B. Allison because he has been a fair
man to my race. He is all right on the
currency question. The colored men here
are for Allison and Reed and Morton and
Quay, and some are for McKinley. You
tee, they are mixed up."
Not many of the delegates rw now here,
only some of those interested in the con
tests before the National Committee hav
ing arrived it _is not expected that the
lobby of the Southern will buzz with poli
tics until next Sunday, when nearly all of
the delegates are expected to be in attend
ance. Enough have arrived, however, to
show that sometniner is going on, and
many picturesque grouus may be observed.
Stiff-rimmed straw hats are in the ma
jority. Here and there a broad-brimmed
black hat covering a head of long hair de
notes a delegate from the wild and wooly
West. There are a few stylish black and
tan derbys, which, however, will be ex
, changed in a day or two for the straw hat
of commerce, costing all the way from 48
cents for plebeian straw up to $25 for the
aristocratic Panama.
The tornado seems to have broken the
spell of hot, sultry weather, which usually
prevails in St. Louis all summer, and the
week thus far has been cool and cloudy,
with a warm shower every morning and
breezes at night. During the day one feels
as though he were in the conservatory in
Golden Gate Park with the heating appa
ratus on in full force. Walking-sticks are
not fashionable here, for each St. Louisan
and the stranger within the gates carries
an umbrella in one hand and a fan in the
other.
The half-dozen gentlemen from Cali
fornia, including Colonel Isaac Trumbo,
who is half a Californian, appear during
the evening resplendent in silk hats, and
give the wondering natives and the tender
feet from the South and East a fitting idea
of the gallantry and grace which distin
guish the gentlemen from the Golden
State.
Mrs. Clara Foltz, formerly of San Fran
cisco and now a leading lady of the New
York bar, Is here as a looker-on. She ex
pects that experience may come handy
when woman suffrage in California and
New York will have become an accom
plished fact. The St. Louis Chronicle
Colonel Swords, Sergeant-at-Arms of the Republican National Committee, at
His Desk.
publishes her portrait to-day under the
heading, "Portia Neither Fairer nor Clev
erer than This Woman."
Mrs. Foltz sees no reason why there
should not spring from the ranks of
women lawyers a Webster, a Lincoln or a
Choate. Tne Chronicle says:
Mrs. Foltz is a political enthusiast. She
is a rabid free silverite and a strong anti-
McKinleyite. She favors General Ben
jamin F. Tracey for President. Though a
Republican, she favors the Mills tariff to
McKinley's, and stumped the State of
California last campaign in its advocacy.
Her brother. Samuel M. Shortridge, she
predicts, will be the next United States
Senator from California and her friend
Colonel Trumbo the next United States
Senator from Utah. Mrs. Foltz is dean
for life of the Portia Law Club of San
Francisco.
Judge Thomas D. Riordan of San Fran
cisco, alternate and successor to W. W.
Montague, is here with Colonel Samuel M.
Shortridge, and is much interested in the
meeting of the National Committee, which
began at noon to-day. After the disposi
tion of the cases from Alabama and
Arkansas the hearing of the contests in
the cases of the regularly elected and in
dorsed delegates from the Third and
Fourth Congressional districts was set for
to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
In dealing with Alabama and Arkansas
the committee has shown a disposition to
exte id to the State conventions the cour
tesy of recognizing as delegates to the Na
tional Convention the gentlemen indorsed
by the State conventions as the regular
delegates. In the case of California this
rule will work well for the friends of Mr.
McKinley, for the regular deiegates are
pledged to vote for McKinley as long as
there is any reasonable prospect of his
nomination.
Everything is McKinley on the first
ballot, hence the politicians and the dele
gates will have little to talk of except the
Vice-Presidency, which seems to be oscil
lating between Reed and Hobart. In case
a nomination is had on one ballotâ and it
looks that way now â the convention will
be able to complete its work in two days.
The silver men are hot to-night and are
determined to make a vigorous fight on
the floor of the convention for an out-and
out expression on the money issue. They
want it straight silver or straight gold, and
threaten to bolt if it is gold.
St. Louis is enteprising and is making
money out of her recent misfortune.
Hundreds of wrecked buildings have been
photographed and from these photographs
souvenir books of half-tone engravings
have been made and are being offered for

by both systems, and now the cars display

cara and come back by the electric-cars.
The route is lined with roofless dwellings,
the departing roof taking with it, in al
most every instance, half or the whole of

McKINLEY AND HOBART.
It Is Prophesied That They Will Be
Nominated.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 10.â For Presi
dent â William McKinley of Ohio: for
Vice-Presidentâ Garrett A. Hobart of
New Jersey; platformâ "Sound Money."
The "knowing ones" â and there are
many of them in the Southern Hotel
lobbyâ predict that this will be the ticket
nominated by the Republican party in the
National Convention. A stanch sup
porter of McKinley, as well as his inti
mate friend and political confidant, said to
The Call correspondent to-night: "Every
one of Major McKinley's supporters is
certain that he will be nominated hands
down, on the first ballot, and those who
have opposed' him reluctantly confess as
much. He will certainly be selected on an
anti-sixteen to one, in other words,
"Sound Money" platform. Therefore the
interesting question is now, who will be
nominated as his running mate? My
guess is that it will be Garrett A. Hobart
of New Jersey, whose nomination would
be quite as acceptable to McKinley's sup
porters."
Ordinarily the opinion of one individual
politician is not weighty at a gathering
where wis6 predictions are as plenty as
blackberrys. The desires of these political
prognosticators often warp their better
judgment and again they resort to willful
misrepresentations to accomplish their
ends. Not so, however, with The Call's
informant. He is a man whose strong
character and sterling worth has made
him a close friend of the great Ohioan. If
the name of this gentleman should be
mentioned, coupled with his prediction
that Hobart of New Jersey would not only
be acceptable to the friends of Major Mc-
Kinley, but that he would be nominated
for Vice - President, the announcement
would be regarded as semi-authoritative,
at least, and thi3 obviously might incite
the displeasure of other ambitious Vice-
Presidential candidates, so the name of
Tue Call's informant is withheld.
It is the inalienable right of every indi
vidual to hazard a guess, and in the enjoy
ment of thut blessed privilege The Call's
correspondent predicts that McKinley and
Hobart will be the ticket nominated next
week. There are many names mentioned
for the Vice-Presidential nomination, viz. :
Thomas B. Reed of Maine, Governor Levi
P. Morton, Warner Miller, General Horace
Porter, ex-Secretary of the Navy Benjamin
F. Tracy, General McAlpin, ail of New
York State; Governor Hastings of Penn
sylvania.
Mr. Manley of Maine stated to The Call
correspondent explicitly and positively to
day that Reed would not accept second
place. The name of M. H. de Young of
California has been mentioned in tiiis con
nection, but he is not ambitious, for he
stated so very plainly to the interviewer.
Iv brief, while Mr. de Young disavowed
his Vice-Presidential ambition, he w&s
willing to emulate the example of the
good old Roman patriot, Cincinnatus.
Mr. de Young said:
"Really, now young man, I have not
given the matter serious consideration.
Everybody knows, that at the Minneapolis
convention in 1892, my friends begged me
to take the Vice-Presidential nomination,
but I persisted in my refusal to accept such
an empty honor."
Thus we see history repeating itself.
Marc Antony said of the great Cseaar:
"You ail did see how on the lupercal, I
thrice did offer him a kingly crown, which
thrice did he refuse. Was this ambition?"
And so Mr. de Young will pass into history
as an unambitious but noble Roman, who
did not desire the Vice-Presiderfcy, but
would accept the empty honor if called by
his party. But here is Mr. de Young's
identical language after relating how he
declined the honor in 1892:
"If the coming convention, in its wis
dom, should offer me the nomination, 1
could not be hasty or positive in my
declination. I leave for Paris in a few
weeks, where my children are being
educated; but in these days of fast land
and sea travel the trip there and back will
not consume much time, and I expect to
be here for the campaign."
The political sharps, having decided
that McKinley will undoubtedly be nomi
nated for the Presidency, with a strong
probability that Mr. Hobart will be his
running mate, speculation turns upon the
platform. The Call correspondent-, to
day talked with Republicans of promi
nence from all sections of the country,
and there seems to be but one opinion.
The platform will declare against the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
The general opinion is that it will be
drawn on the lines of the Indiana plat
form, which declared against 16 to 1 free
coinage, but whose "sound money"
declaration was moderately worded. The
platform, therefore, will be for sound
money, but the resolutions committee, it
is believed, will soften the phrases, en
deavoring not to give offense to the free
silver people.
Senator Proctor of Vermont, who seve
ral months a;?o was counted among Mr.
Reed's New England supporters, but who
has recently joined the McKinley forces
and who may be made permanent chair
man of the convention, said to The Call
correspondent to-night, in reply to
questions :
"Yes, of course; I have heard my name
mentioned as permanent chairman of the
convention. I do not know whether the
reports that Republican leaders want me
to accept in that capacity have any real
foundation or not, but I think not. They
might select a better man than myself for
chairman. However, if they so decide, I
will obey. "For," said be, "I am a soldier."
"What will the platform be, Senator?"
"Briefly it will declare ?or protection and
sound money," ne replied.
Perry S. Heath, who, next to Marcus
Hanna, Congressman Grosvenor or A. C.
Thompson of Ohio, is Major McKinley's
closest political confident, said to-night:
"An interesting and peculiar condition
exists in several of the States respecting
the issues which will be foremost in the
approaching campaign. It does not now
seem at all likely that there will be any
thiog like a bolt'of the silver States on ac
count of the adoption of a sound-money
plank in the platform. It was expected
by many a few weeks ago, that the most
rabid free-silver States would walk out of
the convention, but there is much reason
ing and counciling upon every hand and
the probability is that the fight for silver
will be confined within the lines of the
party without any bolts.
"Prominent Republican leaders from all
of the silver States excepting Nevada have
visited our headquarters during the past
two or three days and expressed the
opinion that the McKinley electoral ticket
would be elected in their States upon a
sound-money platform, while free-silver
Legislatures and Congressmen would be
elected at the same time by Republicans.
They argue that McKinley's well known
and pronounced and popular position
upon the tariff will insure his election in
most if not all of the silver States, even
though he does stand upon the soundest
kind of a sound-money platform, because
the protectionists are willing to take Mc-
Kinley on account of his protection prin
ciples, thus securing the protection object
through the executive branch of the Gov
ernment and silver legislation sentiment
through the legislative branch. When one
looks into this proposition it does not ap
pear as inconsistent as at first blush.
Every candidate has had some quality
which recommended him most promi
nently to the franchise o! the people.
"There is no doubt that the greatest
strength of McKinley lies in the fact that
he more perfectly than any of the aspir
ants represents the protection side of the
Republican decalogue. Republicans are
universally protectionists, and even if the
personification of protection is opposed to
their ideas on a single phase of the money
question, they will accept him and sup
port him and attempt to secure the enact
ment of their desires on the financial
question through other directions. The
Republicans who some time ago argued
in favor of the idea that protection and
free silver should go side by side are now
saying that they are willing to take pro
tection in one hand and seek free silver
with the other. There is no doubt that
even in the silver States the tariff will be
the leading issue, as the country has suf
fered from the deficiency in the Treasury
Department at Washington from a lack of
revenue sufficient to meet the necessary
and pauper labor abroad. Of
course it is expected that the most ardent
free-silver States will make free silver an
issue of great prominence, and in some
States silver will take precedence over the
tariff, but the localities which will make
silver the only issue are few and remote.
"East of the Missouri the tariff and its
bearing upon labor questions will be the
great issue. It looks now as though the
Republicans in t c silver States would be
able to adjust the issues before them in
such a way as to insure success tor the
National ticket without coming in conflict
with the paramount local issues."
Perry Heath is an old-time Washington
correspondent. He was for several years
representative of the Columbus Dispatch,
Indianapolis Journal and other papers.
While acting as the Journal correspond
ent he established and maintained friendly
relations with Senator Benjamin Harrison,
who, when he became President, reposed
great confidence in his newspaper friend
and imparted to him many political and
official secrets. Mr. Heath several years
ago became financially interested In the
Cincinnati Commercial Gazette and was
its business and editorial manager. His
paper was regarded as McKinley's State
organ, and it is understood that Mr.
Heath relinquish his active work on the
paper in order to enter into the political
canvass in Major McKinley's interest. Of
cor-^e Mr. Heath is certain that Mr. Mc-
Kinley will be nominated on the first
ballot.
"Who, in your opinion, will be named
for second place?" he was asked to-day.
Mr. Heath skillfully parried this blunt
interrogatory, but after naming over sev
eral of the most prominent Republicans
who have been mentioned in that connec
tion, said that Mr. Hobart of New Jersey
would make a strong candidate who would
command the confidence of the business
men of the country, as Mr. Hobart is es
sentially a business man. Besides, he lives
in one of the pivotal States.
"Would Mr. Hobart's nomination be
acceptable to the McKinley managers and
supporters?" he was asked.
'Quite so," said Mr. Heath.
"I notice that John M. Thurston of
Nebraska is wearing a McKinley and
Hobart lapel button," suggested The
Call correspondent.
"Yes," said Mr. Heath, "and it is one of
the first issues."
"This, coupled with the fact that Thur
ston is a strong McKinley man, might
naturally be regarded as significant?"
"Yes, perhaps so," answered Mr. Me
Kinley'a friend, with a look more expres
sive than words which he did not utter.
There is no doubt that the free-silver
men fully realize the platform will be for
"sound money." They only hope now
that the declarations will not be emphat
ically expressed in favor of a single gold
standard; but whatever may be the plat
form all good Republicans will abide by it.
This is the sentiment of all with the ex
ception of a few far Western delegates.
One of the National committeemen said
to-night that he talked with most of the
Western delegates now in the city with a
view of ascertaining their attitude in the
West if a "sound-money" plank was
adopted.
"Only one State will walk out," said he,
"and this will be Colorado. Some of
the Idahoans may bolt, but Sena
tor Shoup will support the Republican
ticket."
This expression of a National Cornmit
tceman is given, because it fairly reflects
the sentiment of a vast majority of the
prominent Republican politicians who are
on the ground. There are one or two radi
cal silver men, however, who declare they
will never accept the "sound-money"
platform. Colonel Trumbo of Utah de
clares that the time has come when the
battle between gold and silver must be
"fought to a finish." Thomas D. Riordan
of San Francisco is another one of the
radicals who threatens to bolt if the plat
form is antagonistic to silver.
At a late hour to-night, Mr. Manley of
Maine concedes that his candidate, Reed,
is doomed to defeat, and that the nominee
will be McKinley. He says it is very evi
dent from the vote on the Alabama and
Arkansas contests to-day, that the McKin
ley men are in full control of the National
Committee. There are about fifty cases to
be heard by the committee, involving tbe
seats of 168 delegates, and four or five days
will be occupied in hearing them. It is
probable that the contest cases will not
be finished before Saturday night.
The general impression to-night is that
Fairbanks of Indiana will be made tempora
ry chairman, though the objection is being
urged cgalnst him that his selection would
be construed as interference in the In
diana factional fight. Fairbanks is a
strong McKinley man, being a candidate
for the Senate against W. R. McKeen, a
warm friend of General Harrison. The
friends of Mr. McKeen claim that Fair
banks' election wotild give him an advan
tage over McKeen. Nevertheless, Fair
banks will be selected for the temporary
chairmanship with a strong probability
that Senator Proctor will be made perma
nent chairman.

GOVERNOR BRADLEY'S VIEWS.
He Denies That He Straddled the
Money Question.
FRANKFORT, Ky., June 10.â For near
ly a week Governor Bradley has been
threatening to give out a statement in re
ply to a recent dispatch sent out from
Washington, to the effect that he was
originally in favor of a compromising
policy on the financial question, but was
induced by Governor McKinley to make
the race for Governor of Kentucky last fail
on a gold standard platform, and further
that Bradley has since negotiated with
McKinley and other Presidential candi
dates. Articles have also been sent from
here stating that Governor Bradley has
letters in his possession, written to him
by various Republican leaders, which
letters he intended to make public
After laboring several days the Gover
nor to-night gave out the following state
ment, which was carefully written and
more carefully revised: "I cannot permi
the Washington dispatch to the Chicago
Record to pass unchallenged. In response
I deny that I ever was the representative
of Mr. Hanna in any way, nor is it true
that my actions were ever controlled or
governed in the slightest degree by what
is politically called in that dispatch the
Platt-Clarkson crowd. There was never j
any combination between those gentle
men and myself or any of my friends. 1
have not attempted to make terms with
McKinley or any of his managers. I have
not offered to trade any votes or any vote
for Vice-president, nor will I be a candi
date for Vice- President, nor would I accept
a Cabinet position.
"I did write to McKinley, and at the
same time I wrote to a number of leading
Republicans throughout the cou ltry con
cerning the Kentucky campaign. The in
sinuation that I wrote favoring a straddle
on the currency question or that McKin
ley advised me not to pursue such a course
or said that the silver agitation was the
result of hard times, just as tbe greenback
craze was the result of the panic of '73, is
totally false. 1 did not write to him that
a majority of the people in Kentucky were
in favor of free coinage or that both parties
were rapidly drifting that way, My ex
pressed opinion was that the Minneapolis
platform was too general and that the
party must make a clear and distinct selec
tion.
"My views are too well known to require
explanation in Kentucky. Weeks before
the convention assembled at Louisville the
Sunday Critic announced my declaration
that I would not uccept the nomination on
a free-siiver platform and I gave tbe
Courier-Journal an interview almost as
explicit. I have time and time again de
clared in favor of the gold standard, with
every dollar made of equal value, and
against the free and unlimited coinage of
silver. My canvass was made on a plat
form embodying these ideas aud I adhere
to that platform now. I believe that
sound currency will be the leading issue
of the coming campaign. The honor of
the Republic and the welfare of the people
demand its correct solution. It is far
above personal success or individual ad
vancement, and in this hour of supreme
trial the Republican convention should
declare unhesitatingly in favor of the
single gold stand, rd.
"There is no tine for quibbling or eva
sion. We may lose some Western States.
This loss will be more than compensated
by the gain in the old slave border States,
but if I thought such declaration would
cause the Republican nominee to be de
feated I would none the less favor it.
"Success at the expense of the National
welfare would be neither creditable nor
profitable. In justice to McKinley I will
add the statement in to-day's Courier
Journal that he wrote me recommending
the adoption of a plank with a strong free
silver tinge is not true, neither did he or
any one of the gentlemen addressed sug
gest anything of the kind."
FAIRBANKS FOR CHAIRMAN.
Secretary Thompson Does Not Think
Me Is Selected.
TERRE HAUTE, Ink, June 10.â The
result of an interview to-day with ex-
Secretary of the Navy Thompson, who is
one of the delegates-at-large to the St.
Louis convention, was the expression of
his surprise at a statement that Mark
Hanna last night said that C. W. Fair
banks, one of the Indiana delegates-at
large, had been selected for temporary
chairman of the St. Louis convention.
He said: "I do not believe that Mr.
McKinley has authorized this selecton to
be made, or any other. I do not believe
he would interfere in the Senatorial con
test iD this State so as to take the part of
one of the contestantsâ there being sev
eral â against all the others. This prefer
ence for Mr. Fairbanks would place
him precisely in that position, inasmuch
as he is an avowed candidate for Senator.
I repeat, I do not believe McKinley would
be a party to any such bargaining before
or after the convention. It is said that
Mr. Fairbanks has been selected because
he secured instructions oy the Republican
State Convention to the delegates-at-large
to vote for McKinley. This is new to me
as well as surprising, for it attaches the
credit to. one man which belongs to the
Republican party of the State."

EXECUTION OF A
FEMALE MONSTER
The Notorious Mrs. Dyer
Hanged in Newgate
Prison.
A SLAYER OF INNOCENTS
Weighted With Bricks She Threw
Scores of Babies Into
the Thames.
APPALLING BECORD OF CRIME.
Twice Attempts Suicide and Is Led to
tbe Scaffold in a Dszsd
Condition.
LONDON, Eng., June 10.â Mrs. Annie
Dyer, the Reading baby-farmer who pre
sumably murdered scores of infants in
trusted to her, was hanced in Newgate
prison at 9 o'clock this morning. Since
she was sentenced to death Mrs. Dyer had
twice attempted to commit suicide. The
woman was completely dazed when
she was led to the scaffold and had to be
supported by the warden who bad her in
charge.
Her crime was one that horrified all
England when discovered. On Monday,
March 30, a parcel was found in the river
near Reading, and when opened the body
of a little girl baby was discovered. Tbe
population of Reading consists largely of
women working in the straw-hat works,
and infanticide is not uncommon.
An address on the parcel led to the ar
rest of Mrs. Dyer; and the police were able
to prove that she borrowed some string
and took out with her a paper parcel on
that day. The string around the parcel
was identical with the string ahe bor
rowed. On Wednesday, April 8, a man
who was dragging the river brought up a
parcel of linen rags. When the parcel
reached the surface of the water a brick
dropped out, and also the head of a child,
which floated upon the surface of the
river. On examination of the parcel it
was found that some tape had been tied
tightly round the neck of the deceased
child.
On Friday, the 10th, a third body was
recovered near the footbridge at the Clap
pers. It proved to be that of a child, and
was wrapped up in a cloth and tied round
with a strinp. There was a large brick in
the parcel. The body was that of a child
of about nine months old. It is sup
posed that the little baby was suffocated
by having something placed in its mouth.
It is impossible to say how long the body
had been in the water.
On the same afternoon another parcel
was brought up from the center of the
footbridge. Iv this were found the bodies
of two infants, accompanied by such other
paraphernalia as warranted a strong sus
picion that the murderer of the children
previously found was also the destroyer of
the lives of these.
The first body found could not have been
in the water many hours, for the river at
the spot where It had been thrown in was
shallow and muddy; indeed, there was
scarcely enough water to cover the parcel
and the top was plainly visible and quite
dry. On the Inside of the wrapper was
found the address, "45 Kensington road,
Reading." Had the parcel been immersed
in the water for a long time the ink would
have become obliterated. This child had
been dead probably ten days, and it is be
lieved that it had been kept in Mrs. Dyer's
house all the while. When inquiries were
made by the police on the day of the dis
covery of the body it was found she had
gone away.
Mrs. Dyer had been indicted for the
murder of Doris, the two-months-old child
of Miss Eveliti Marmon of Cheltenham.
It was the strangled body of her baby
which the police found in the Thames
that gave the clew to the identity of its
murdress. The body had been wrapped
in brown paper and this bore the address
of the Dyer woman.
Only nine days after she surrendered
Doris to Mrs. Dyer, Miss Marmon was
taken by the police to Heading, and
there in the Morgue saw and identified
the body as that of her child, whom she
had given to Mrs. Dyer to b a . adopted
and "brought up in a good home." Mi.ss
Marmon testified that she saw in a Bris
tol paper an advertisement of Mrs. Dyer
for a baby for adoption and that she
answered it.
The second time the woman attempted
suicide she tied a shoestring around her
neck, but was found before she had
strangled herself.
The funeral of the babies attracted
enormous crowds. Henley, famous for
its annual regatta and the palatial home
of William Waldorf Astor, is not far from
the scene of the crimes.

Mr. Davis presented the Hon. M. Elbert
Carey of Ridgefield as temporary chair
man of tbe convention.
All resolutions were ordered passed to
the committee on resolutions without de
bate, and the temporary organization was
made permanent. The delegates at large
and district were then elected by the con
vention. Delegates at large are : Miles I.
Preston, Lynde Harrison. Thomas M.
Waller and James Aldis. The resolutions
were read by Colonel N. G. Osborne of
New Haven, and adopted.
The platform declares that the Demo
crats of Connecticut believe that as a
necessary consequence the honest pay
ment ot public debts and the preservation
of the public faith and credit require that
the gold standard of money, as a measure
of value, shall be maintained.
While the most liberal use of silver con
sistent with the enforcement of a gold
standard is favored, unalterable opposi
tion to free silver is declared, free coin
age being a device for the debasement of
the currency and the compulsory purchase
of silver by the Government. President
Cleveland's administration was indorsed.
The delegates favor Russell for Presi
dent.

ADJOURNS TO â¢ MORROW.
Long Debate Before the Sundry
Civil Appropriation Bill
Passed.
HOUSE AND SENATE AT OUTS.
Democrats Question the Financial
Methods of the Republican
Majority.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 10.â Busi
ness of the first session of the Fifty-fourth
Congress was practically concluded to-day
by the agreement of the two bodies upon
the sundry civil and District of Columb:a
appropriation bills â the only remaining
matters of difference between the two
houses when they met this morning.
To accomplish this the House voted to
concur with the Senate in its amendments
to the sundry civil appropriations bill
of $900,000 for certain public buildings.
This vote â 100 ayes to 88 noes â demon
strated what had been feared would not
be found, a quorum of members still in
the city. The provision in the District
bill cutting off appropriations to religious
and charitable institutions was amended so
as to make the new policy effective after
June 30, 1897. Previous to reaching a con
clusion the House passed many measures
under suspension of the rules.
The concurrent resolution for the final
adjournment of Congress at 4 p. m. to
morrow was received from the Senate and
agreed to.
Although there were less than fifty mem
bers present, several measures were dis
posed of without objection, among them
the following:
A resolution offered by C. W. Stone (R.)
of Pennsylvania, that the Secretary of the
Treasury be required to communicate to
the House at the commencement of the
next session such information as he may
have or may be able to obtain in the
meantime as to the comparative merits
and advantages of pure nickel, nickel al
loy, aluminum combined or alloyed with
metals, and of copper bronze as material
for our minor coins, and, for the purpose of
mailing such information as full and com
plete as. possible, the Secretary of the
Treasury is authorized to hare struck
such experimental minor coins of the
metals mentioned, pure and in combina
tion with other metals, as he may deem
necessary and proper. He is requested to
communicate to the House the results and
conclusions derived from such experi
mental coinage.
Shafroth (R.) of Colorado moved to sus
pend the rules and pass a bill providing
for the punishment of persons who set
fire to timber on the public domain.
On the motion of Mondell (R.) of Wyo
ming, the Senate concurrent resolution
was agreed to, directing the Secretary of
the Interior to resume the work of issuing
patents to the Union Pacific Railroad
Companj, for lands sold by it to bona-fide
purchasers, according to the lists supplied
by the company. This work was suspend
ed a year ago, and about two and a half
millionlacres of land and 15.000 purchasers
are affected.
A resolution reported from the Commit
tee on Printing, by Richardson (I).) of
Tennessee, providing for the printing of
5000 copies of the bankruptcy bill, was
passed.
Grout (R.) of Vermont called up the
conference report on the District of Colum
bia appropriation bill, made yesterday
afternoon, and the House voted to further
insist on its disagreement to the Senate
amendments still in dispute.
Under the suspension of the rules, the
following were passed :
Joint resolution extending the scope of the
good roads investigation being conducted by
the Agricultural Department. Senate joint
resolution extending the benefits conferred by
sections 1426 and 1573, Revised Statutes, re
garding service and re-enlistment to alien
listed in the navy. House bill amending the
law regulating the landing of submarine for
eign telegraph cables, so as to require Congres
sional assent in the future. Heretofore the
permission of the State Department only has
been necessary. House bill setting apart as a
Siate park, under the direction of the Secre
tary of the Interior, about 70,000 acres
of land on Mount Tacoma, Wash. House bill
opening national cemeteries to burial of army
nurses honorably discharged. House bill in
creasing from $2000 to $10,000 the limit of
claims of postmasters for loss by fire, burglary
and other unavoidable causes, which the
Postoffice Department may settle without re
ferring to Congress. House bill to protect the
public forest reserve from depredations. Sen
ate bill appropriating $200,000 to aid and en
courage the trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898.
House joint resolution extending for a year
the time within which settlers on and pur
chasers of lands on ceded Indian reservations
may prove their claims and settle with the
Government. House bill amending the ship
ping laws so as to still further provide for the
comfort and well-being of sailors.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois presented the
conference report on the urgent deficiency
bill, showing the Senate had receded from
its amendment giving a month's salary to
Congressional employes on the roll De
c moer 2. 1895, and since discharged. The
report was adopted.
Walker (R.) of Massachusetts, chairman
of the Committee on Banking and Cur
rency, stated that early in next December
the committee would report a bill dealing
with the whole subject of the Govern
ment's financial policy and the banking
and currency interests of the country.
Cannon reported a total disagreement of
the public building amendments to the
sundry civil appropriation bill and moved
that the House further insist on its dis
agreement.
In a brief statement of the situation
Cannon expressed his belief that the bill
would not fail and that for himself, indi
vidually, he would vote to further insist
upon disagreeing to these amendments.
If the House was not of that opinion and
voted to recede, that would pass the bill
with all these amendments.
W ilson briefly urged the adoption of his
motion to concur with the Senate. The
House in five cases upon this very bill
nad waived the parliamentary principle
contended for by Cannon and it could not
now insist upon its observance. He
charged a discrimination against the West
ern States in the matter of public build
ines for them, the providing of which
upon a State's entry into the Union had
been the invariable policy of the Govern- ,
m Kiu'e (R ) of Kansas supporting Can
non's motion, said it was about time for
the House to let "that Senate" know that
it would no longer be driven and drummed
about at the pleasure of that body.
Owens (D.) of Kentucky said it seemed J
to be the feeling of everybody in the Senate ;
from the pages up that all that was neces- j
B ary for the Senate when it made an [ :
amendment to a bill was to stand firm
and the House at the earliest moment
wo^lld lie down to be stepped on. "Let's
fool 'em once and give 'em to know that
we have a policy of our own and propose
to enforce it." [Applause.]
Wilson's motion to recede and concur in
the Senate amendments was lost on a
divisionâ Bl to 88â but by a vote by tellers
it was reversedâ ayes 90, noes 74. The
ayes and noes were then taken â ayes 100,
noes 88. This action passed the bill, and
the announcement was greeted with ap
plause.
Speaker Reed announced the appoint
ment of the following committees to sit
during the recess:
To investigate the charges against the
Leavenworth Soldiers' Homeâ Grout (R.)
of Vermont, C. W. Stone (R.) of Penn
sylvania. Warner (R.) of Illinois, Sayers
(D.) of Texas and Lay ton (D.) of Ohio.
To investigate and report upon the best
means of putting underground telephone,
telegraph and electric-light wires in the
District of Columbiaâ Babcock (R.) of
Wisconsin, Odell (R.) of New York and
Richardson (D.) of Tennessee.
Senate amendments were agreed to the
bill to punish the transporters of alcohol
or other liquors under a false name or
brand.
The final agreement of the conferees on
the Distiict of Columbia appropriation
bill was pre-ented and agreed to. As to
the charities provision, it was agreed that
after June 30, 1897, no money should be
paid to any religious society or institution,
or to one under sectarian or religious con
trol.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois toot occasion to
briefly review the legislation of the session.
The Republicans, having power only in
the House, proposed a revenue measure
that would obviate the necessity of bor
rowing money, but in another body ii has
slept the sleep of death.
So the best that could be done was to
provide for the expenditures of the Gov
ernment, taking care in the appropriation
bills to enter upon no new field not de
manding attention. The result had been,
he asserted, that there was no scandals of
legislation and the House would appeal to
the country for its vindication. In the
next Congress, with restored Republican
supremacy in the executive and legisla
tive departments of the Government, the
Republican party would re-enact the Re
publican protective principle into the legis
lation of the country, providing sufficient
revenue for the Government and at the
same time labor for the toiling millions
and those who want to toil. [Great ap
plause.]
Boutelle (R.) of Maineâ Mr. Speaker, if
it is in order, I move that when we ad
journ it be to meet at the polls. [Laugh
ter.]
Sayers (D.) of Texas, ex-chairman
of the Committee on Appropriations, re
plying to Cannon, charged the majority
with extravagance, despite what had been
said. In the presence of diminishing
revenues and a depleted treasury, Congress
had appropriated $520,000,000 at this session
of Congress, and he prophesied that those
at the next session would swell the total
for the Fifty-fourth Congress to over
$1,100,000,000, besides mortgaging the
future for $100,000,000. To offset";that the
Republican party proposed to increase the
taxes upon tne people. "The tides of
November have not yet come, and if
you (addressing the Republican members)
are honest with your party at St. Louis,
we'll try conclusions with you at the polls
and determine there whether or not the
people approve extravagance in public
expenditures and the policy of increased
taxes." [Applause.]
Dockery (D.) of Missouri followed with a
vigorous arraignment of the Republican
majority for its departure from the policy
of retrenchment and economy announced
by Speaker Reed at the beginning of the
session.
Dingley (R.) of Maine closedjtbe debate,
which extended quite unexpectedly for
nearly two hours, with an earnest defense
of the Republican policy of protection as
evidenced by the history of the country
under its operation, and he prophesied a
return of prosperity under a renewal of
that principle in its legislation. He as
serted, amid Republican applause, that
there would be no return of prosperity nor
increase of confidence until sufficient rey
enue was provided for the expenses of the
Government.
It was decided to print 10,000 copies of
the report of the Committee on Ways and
Means regarding Japanese competition,
and 10.000 copies of the testimony taKen at
the Nicaragua canal hearings by the Com
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce.
The Senate amendment to the resolution
providing for final adjournment, fixing
the hour for 4 o'clock to-morrow, was
agreed to.
President Cleveland's message vetoing
the bill to lease the iTort Omaha military
reservation to the State of Nebraska for
State military purposes was read and
referred to the Committee on Military Af
fairs.
The House then took a recess until 9:30
o'clock, when it was called to order, a
dozen members on the floor. A recess was
taken until 10:30 o'clock, when the enroll
ment of several bills was reported and
Speaker Reed siirned tnem at' 10:50. The
sundry civil appropriation bill was signed,
when, it being found that the District of
Columbia bill would not be ready to-night,
on motion by Dingley (R.) of Maine, about
twenty members being present, the House
adjourned until 11 o clock to-morrow.
This brought to an epd the legislative day
of Saturday, June 6, which extended over
a period of 108 hours.

THE SENATE'S SESSION.
A Bill Curtailing Judicial I'otrrr in
Contetnpt-of- Court Cases.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 10.â In the
Senate to-day Hill (D.) of New York
moved to proceed with the consideration
of the bill as to contempts of court (arising
out of the Debs case). An appeal was
made to him by Mitchell (R.) of Oregon
not to press the motion, but to permit the
consideration of the House joint resolu
tion looting to the reorganization of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company. Hill
listened to Mitchell's appeal, but per
sisted, nevertheless, in his motion. The
contempt-of-court bill was then taken up
and Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas addressed the
Senate upon it, expressing his satisfaction
with the bill.
The amendment offered by Cannon (R.)
of Utah, making a jury trial obligatory
and not discretionary with the judge, was
agreed to, and the bill as amended was
passed. It divides contempts of court
into two classes â direct and indirect.
Contempts committed during the sitting
of the court or of a iudge in chambers are
direct contempts, all others are indirect.
A direct contempt may be punished sum
marily. In the case of indirect contempt
a reasonable opportunity is to be given the
accused to purge himself of such contempt
and to have a trial by jury. A judgment
of conviction for indirect contempt may
be reviewed upon direct appeal or by writ
of error from the Supreme Court, and be
affirmed, reversed or modified.
At 6 o'clock a message was received from
the House announcing agreement on the
sundry civil bill, the. House receding from
its disagreement to the Senate amend
ments for the erection of various public
buildings.
The Senate then at 11 o'clock adjourned
until to-morrow at 11 o'clock..

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 1896.
SENATOR WHITE
FOR PRESIDENT
Los Angeles Will Try to
Start Him in the
Big Race.
PREPARING A WELCOME
His Friends Doubt That He
Will Accept the Convention
Chairmanship.
MAT STILL SOME TEMPESTS.
The Delegation Is Against Gould and
Likes Footeâ Congressional
Politics.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 10.âPrepa
rations are going forward auspiciously for
the home reception to Senator Stephen M.
White which will take place next Friday
afternoon and evening, provided the distin
guished gentleman arrives on schedule
time.
The general reception committee of
twenty has been holding meetings daily
with the view of making the reception
work complete in every detail. A full
complement of sab-committees has been
appointed, and all are working harmoni
ously. This will be a non-partisan demon
stration, and will be hearty, genuine and
full of earnest zeal.
Great political significance attaches to
Senator White's return at this time. The
reception itself has no political signifi
cance. It is a spontaneous tribute to a
United States Senator who has stood with
the great body of Los Angeles business
men in the great harbor contest.
But this return will be on the eve of the
County Convention of White's party,
wherein all manner of strife and divisions
seem imminent. The Senator, with his
usual pacific hand, is expected to pour the
sweet oil of peace unon these warring fac
tion and to fuse them into one harmoni
ous unity.
He will get Los Angeles County's in
dorsement for chairman of the State con
vention, if he will taKe it. but leading
Democrats of both factions believe he will
oppose such a move. His friend, Patton,
will be chairman of the county conven
tion.
This convention will adopt unanimously
a strong resolution instructing its dele
gates to Sacramento to instruct in turn
the State delegates to the National Con
vention to use all honorable means to se
cure the nomination of Senator White for
the Presidency.
A consensus of opinion among leading
Democrats of the "purist" faction on the
question of the chairmanship of the State
convention is that some neutral man other
than Frank Gould of Stockton should be
selected for that position, which suggests
Senator White, but, as before stated, a
majority of them think he will decline
this honor, sine* he expects to be one of
the delegates-at-large to the National Con
vention.
It is now thought that a resolution will
pass in the County Convention instructing
the delegates to the State Convention to
stand for the admission of both sets of
delegates from San Francisco. "Billy"
Foote has many friends among both fac
tions for delegate at large to the National
Convention.
There will be no resolution in favor of
Foote, but it is believed that the thirty
nine delegates will be solidly for him. A
pronounced silver and San Pedro resolu
tion will go throush with a whoop.
Owing to the harbor fight, which en
gendered so much hostility among certain
elements here, the Congressional contest
promises to be one of the warmest ever
known to Southern California.
An interesting feature of this fight is
that tne Populists have so far made no
nomination for Congressman, which means
that they will indorse an acceptable nomi
nee of the Democrats. George S. Patton,
who is of strong silver tendencies, would
be very acceptable to the Populists. So
too, would H. C. Dillon, attorney of the
Salt Lake Railroad, which will' seek to
reach tidewater at San Pedro.
Not only the Populists, but labor organi
zations throughout this district are favor
able to San tedro. The foregoing indi
cates what Mr. McLachlan will have to
contend with in the coming canvass.
CALIFORNIA WINES WIN THE DAY.
They Will Be Admitted Free of Duty to
Hawaii if Under 18 Per Cent
Alcohol.
HONOLULU, June 3, lÃ96.â Minister Da
mon's wine bill has passed both houses of
the Legislature. It admits duty free all
California wines under 18 per cent alcohol.
This begins next new year and continues
five years.
P. C. Jones has presented to the Govern
ment a proposition from Rithet <fe Co. of
Victoria, B. C, to place in London $4,000,
-000 of Hawaiian bonds with 4 per cent in
terest, at a discount of 5 per cent and 2 per
cent commission. In consequence the Sen
ate has promptly taken from the table Min
ister Damon's supposedly defunct bill for
refunding the Hawaiian debt at 15 per cent
discount, and has recommended it to the
Executive for the necessary changes. It
now seems clear that the whole Hawaiian
debt will be refunded at much less sacri
fice than Damon had planned for, which
had defeated his bill. The proposed loan
for puulic improvements of $800,000 at 5
per tent interest, bonds to be sold in
Honolulu, will naturally go to London at
4 per cent also. As the ninety regular
days of the session were nearly expired,
President Dole has used his prerogative
and extended the session ten days longer.
P. O. Jones has thus indicated his
sagacity in opposing the sale of bonds at
15 per cent discount, as well as his disin
terestedness in that opposition, it I aving
been claimed that he was biased by an in
clination as a lender of money to keep up
rates of interest in Honolulu.
The wife of General A. S. Hartwell died
this morning.
COAL-MINERS ABOUT TO STRIKE.
They Will Bitterly Oppose the Co-Operative
Plan of Running the
Works.
DENVER, Colo., June 10.âMass-meet
ings of union coal-miners have been held
in several towns in the lignite field north
of Denver to-day, and resolutions calling
for a general strike of all miners there have
been adopted. The miners in several
places have been on a strike for sorre time,
in an effort to force the operators to live
up to the old agreement relative to wages
and to secure the reinstatement of severul
leaders who left work to attend a miners'
picnic, when positively ordered by their
employers not to do so. By endeavoring
to import colored labor from Kansas and
by adopting a co-operative plan of operat
ing the coal mines the owners hope to out
wit the strikers, and this general striKe
ordered to-day is for the purpose of check
ing such action. The union is now sup
plying the strikers with provisions, and
they declare they will tight against the
importation of colored help.
STUDENTS IN A RIOT.
Harvard Men Clash With Police and
Several on Both Sides Are
Badly Bruised.
BOSTON, Mass., June 10.â A riot took
place in Harvard Square to-night, and as
a result several Harvard students have
severe bruises and several of the Cam
bridge policemen are nursing wounds.
It all happened as a result of the
students exuberance over the victory of
the Harvard baseball club at Princeton.
Three students were locked up, and one
was so badly cut about the head that a
physician was summoned to the police
station.
Twelve stitches were taken in the
wound. He is Arthur T. Pilling, a sopho
more. The other two students are
Goldthwait H. Darr, a junior, and Clay
Briggs, special student.
Patrolmen Corcoran, Murray, McElroy,
and Dy nan were roughly handled, and the
coat of the first-named was stripped from
his back. The others were struck in the
faces with fists and sticks. This all oc
curred after the officers had attempted to
arrest Briggs on the charge of discharging
firearms on the street.

Demonstration of New
Methods.
FILL HOLLOW MOLARS.

Sacrifice Themselves to
Science.
PROGRESS OF A CENTURY.
Modern Methods Compared to the
Primitive Ways of Years
Agone
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 10.â Dr. Rus
sell H. Cool of Oakland tonight stepped
out of the scientific routine that is of great
importance to the dentists in the State
Convention here and presented an illus
trated lecture which was of interest to the
non-professional members of the audience.
The lecture lacked nothing in interest
to the dentists themselves, though shorn
of the technical language that usually
clothes the essays and papers. Dr. Cool
was assisted by Dr. C. L. Goddard. The
subject of the lecture was, "Popular Dis
semination of Dental Knowledge,'' in
which was shown the duty a dentist owed
to his patrons ana the advantage of pos
sessing sound teeth.
He spoke upon their care as being a
part of the training that children should
receive. Thestereopticon views presented
were amusing and instructive.
The opening of the day's session found
four of the dentists at their chairs with
patients ready to demonstrate some special
feature of practical dentistry.
The visitors present took a great interest
in the clinics. Dr. Alfred Cane of San
Francisco placed a large gold filling in a
central incisor, using his newly invented
"rotative phy^er." This instrument gives
no shock to the tooth and is noiseless.
The filling was solid and sightly.
Dr. A. F. Merriman Jr. of Oakland
placed a similar filling, but much larger.
in the mate to the tooth filled by Dr. Cane,
but instead of using a single plugging in
strument the doctor used at least a half
dozen varieties, including hand, automatic
and engine mallets, to demonstrate the
range of possibilities in gold tilling. This
tilling was likewise very creditable.
Dr. F. C. Pague performed "immediate
root filling" in the nerve canal of a right
upper lateral incisor, using salal and
paraffine by capillary attraction and gutta
percha cones. Dr. J. E. Cummings of San
Francisco commenced a clinic in making a
porcelain jacket crown for an upper in
cisor, and will complete this and other
porcelain work at later sessions.
With the afternoon session there were
presented as applicants for membership:
P. K. Hilliarri, Sitn Jose; C. L. Bliss,
Santa Cruz; C. J. Pearce, Watsonville.
The trustees reported favorably upon the
following applications received yesterday
and the apphcats were elpcted to member
ship: T. W. Drullard, F. E. Sawyer, L.
L. White, vV. P. English, Emma T. Read,
Clyde S. Payne, George W. Rodolph, F. D.
As"h worth, W. 'H. Halsey and M. O.
Wyatt.
The clinics of the morning session were
discussed by the convention and became
so interesting that the discussion en
croached upon the time allowed for the
reading of papers. Dr. Merrinian brought
his patient into the convention that his
fellow dentists might see the result of his
demonstration of the restoration of a filling
in a central incisor by the use of various
mallets.
Drs. Metcalf, KT.owies, Lewis and Mrs.
Dr. Read discussed the clinics and ex
pressed pleasure at the result.
The balance of the afternoon was occu
pied with the reading of papers and mat
ters of routine business. "A Retrospect of
Half a Century" was read by Dr. J. L.
Asay of San joVe and attracted many fav
orable comments from the delegates.
The older men were reminded of the
primitive ways of the early dentists, and
the younger men appreciated the refer
enceto the improvements and and ad
vancement made by the present-day dent
ists, to whom, the paper stated, was due
to a large extent the present success of
dental science.
Dr. De Crow of San Jose, in discussing
the paper, reviewed some of his own expe
riences, similar to those referred to by Dr.
Asay in bis paper, which led Dr. Lewis to
declare in a jocular way that Dr. De Crow
had reached the age of 109 years and still
retained an unjarred memory of some
wonderfully ancient events in dental
science.
A motion by Dr. C. L. Goddard of San
Francisco that hereafter each alternate
convention of the State Dental Associa
tion be held outside of San Francisco was
referred to the committee on resolutions.
This is the first time the convention has
ever been held outside of San Francisco
and the visit to Santa Cruz seems to have
had the effect of creating a desire with
most of the dentists to combine a summer
outing with their annual business.
CRETAN INDEPENDENCE.

ATHENS, Gbeece, June 10.â It is

THE FRESNO MYSTERY.
Spies Sent to Russiantown to
Search for the Slayer of
the Shahamarians.
Armenians Accused of Starting Fires
Which Destroyed the Homes of
Two Colonists.
FRESNO, Cal., June ID.â The Sheriff's
force, District Attorney Snow and the
local Constabulary are still seeking the
assassin of the Shahamarian family. They
are all looking for the murderer is Rus
siantown.
Although the prediction that the mur
derer would be arrested to-day was not ful
filled, yet some important evidence was
discovered.
The silence of the Russians in regard to
the murder must be broken, and this is
very difficult to do. Spies will be sent
among them to learn what they know.
A Call correspondent, working in con
junction with Deputy Constable Crutcher,
a.-certained to-day the names of some of
the Russians who had made threats
against Benjamin Shahamarian, declaring
that he, who had visited women and little
girls, ought to be shot or hanged.
This is important, as heretofore it has
been impossible to learn who made such
statements. It supplies a clew to work
upon.
As the Armenians are now charging the
Russians with the triple murder, the
Russians are charging the Armenians witli
drowning a little Russian boy in the river
several months ago.
The boy's body was fauna upon the
bank of the stream.
Last night two homes in Russiantown
were burned. The Russians now allege
that the fires were the work of Armenians.

DRIVEN INSANE
Diabolical Contrivance to
Shatter Mrs. Copsey's
Reason.
SERVANTS IN A PLOT.
Fomented Hallucinations That
Would Place Her in an
Asylum.
STRANGE TALES OF WITNESSES
Supposititious Telephone Messages
Telling of Her Husband's
Inconstancy.
STOCKTON, Cal., June 10.-An inter
esting case is on trial before Judge Smith of
Department 2of the Superior Court. Some
time ago Mrs. Copsey, wife of one of the
wealthy men of this county, was adjudged
insane and her estate was placed in charge
of a man named Davis as her gruardian.
She had peculiar hallucinations, at that
time,, and believed she heard messages
through the walls of her home wiich told
her of the improper conduct of her aged
husband with other women. She had, be
fore that, suffered a stroke of paralysis
which affected her brain, and she waa
taken before the courts here and. adjudged
incompetent to manage her own affairs.
Since then she has recovered somewhat
from her stroke of paralysis and she now
believes she is perfectly able to manage
her own affairs. Her guardian is vigor
ously contesting her action to oust him
from his position.
It was shown to-day that every effort
was made by Mrs. Copsey's nurses and
others to foment Mrs. Copsey's hallucina
tions when her mind showed signs of
weakening. A fake telephone waa placed
in her room, and the nurse would pretend
to telephone to a leading grocer in the
city, where Copsey was in the habit of
trading. She would pretend to receive re
plies to the effect that the invalid's hus
band was drunk and that he was consort
ing with Chinese and with negresses. Mrs.
Copsey's counsel to-day endeavored to
show that all these and other acts were in
tended to assist in unbalancing her mind.
It was shown this afternoon that Mrs.
| Copsey had made a will in which she left
| the bulk of her fortune to her guardian,
| who is fighting the present contest on her
! part to be declared competent, and that
she left very little to her husband. It was
1 also brought out by the testimony that
some of the ranchhands on the Copsey
place were made to masquerade as women
\ for the purpose of mystifying the woman
j whose mind was supposed to be failing.
One of these ranchhands, who is known
as Dutch Harry, gave \testimony to this
effect to-day.
Robert North rup, one of the witnesses
for Mrs. Copsey, gave some damaging tes
timony against the nurse who made use of
the supposititious telephone. He after
ward admitted on cross-examination that
he had served a term in San Quentin for
stage-robbery, having pleaded .guilty to
the charge. The case will be continued
I to-morrow.
Coming to San Sraneiseo.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 10.â Mr. and
Mrs. Wm. Crocker's private car, the Sacra
mento, is being stocked with all that is to
be had in the market for a trans-continen
tal trip from New York to San Francisco.
Prince and Princess Poniatowski have re
turned from a trip to Europe, and the.
preparations are made for them. The
party leaves some time to-day, arriving in,
San Francisco Sunday night.

Platform.
RENO, Nev., June 10.â The mass con
vention of the "straight-out" wing of the
Democratic party in Nevada was called to
order by Joseph R. Ryan, chairman of the
State Central Committee. The attend
ance was quite large. Dr. A. Gibson of
Reno was chosen temporary chairman.
Committees on permanent organization,
platform and resolutions were selected,
and a recess taken.
Dr. Gibson sent a communication to the
committee of permanent organization
declining the permanent chairmanship
and S. S. Sears was given that position.
When the convention reassembled re
ports of committees were received and
adopted. The platform indorsed Cleve
land's administration with exception
of his financial policy; commends
his course on the tariff and the
Monroe doctrine; declares for the
free and unlimited coinage of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting for
the co-operation or permission of any
foreign power or potentate; advocates
home rule for Nevada; denounces the
American Protective Association; favors
the calling of a constitutional convention ;
favors the election of United StateÃ Sena
tors by direct vote of the people; and in
structs delegates to use all honorable
means to secure a platform favorable to
silver at the established ratio and the
nomination of candidates favorable to free
coinage.
The following delegates to Chicago were
elected: Theodore Winters of Waehoe,
Major J. H. Dennis of Reno, l). L. Wer
theimer of Pioche, Dr. A. Gibson of Reno,
P. C. Webber of Ely, Allen Fisher of
Wells. Alternatesâ F. Lemmon, S. M.
Henley, A. E. Boucher. J. H. Crum. C. H.
E. Hard in, Harry McDuffie. Presidential
electorsâ J. R. Ryan, R. M. Clarke and
George Russell. Alternatesâ J. F. Angell,
W. G. Thompson and Matt Rheim.
Nothing was said in the convention
about any compromise with the Keating
faction. There was a slight sprinkling of
the opposition element, but when it en
deavored to rnaka its presence felt it was
summarily sat down upon by the "straight
outs." With the exception of a slight
squabble over the permanent chairman
ship the gathering was harmonious. The
nomination of a State ticket was passed
and the matter left in the hands of the
State Central Committee.
General R. W. Clake, who was defeated
for delegate to the National Convention
and afterward elected as a Presidential
elector, sent a communication to the State
Central Committee to-night declining to
allow his name to be used on the ticket.
There are two sets of delegates to the
National Convention from Nevada and
there promises to be a hot fight as to which
will be seated.
DEMOCRATS OF TERAMS
Resolutions Indorsing Governor Sudd's
Administration Are Opposed.
RED BLUFF, Cal., June 10.â The
Democratic County Convention to-day
elected as delegates to the State and Con
gressional District conventions John J.
Wells, W. L. Bransford, H. P. Andrews,
M. G. Gill, W. H. Marshall.
The platform declares emphatically for
free silver, regardless of the action of other
nations, and instructs the delegates to
vote only for free silver delegates to the
National Convention. It indorses the ad
ministration of President Cleveland, ex
cept as to his financial policy, with which
it heartily disagrees; condemns any re
ligious test as a qualification for office; de
nounces the funding bill and commends
the efforts of Senator White and Repre
sentative Maguire to prevent its passage;
approves the course of Railroad Commis
sioners La Rue and Stanton ; favors strict
immigration laws; denounces the incon
sistency of the Republicans in resolving
against the funding bill and nominating
Colonel Fred Crocker for Presidential elec
tor, and the election of Grove L. Johnson
as delecate to the National Convention;
presents the name of A. M. McCov for del
egate to the National Convention and in
structs the delegates against giving proxies
to persons outside of the delegation*.
No mention is made of Governor Budd's
administration. Resolutions indorsing it
were suggested, but met with so much op
position that they were not offered in the
convention. One delegate ventured to say
a word agunst the free silver resolution,
but was deliberately and emphatically
squelched.
ALASKA GOLD STRIKE.
Immense I.edge of Quartz in, the Nesque
shinsky District.
SEATTLE, Cal., June 10.â The steam
ship Al-Ki, which arrived in port at 3
o'clock this morning from Juneau, brought
information of the discovery in thcNesque
shinsky Bay district by Captain Cowden
and MrH. \V. F. Turner of bitka of a solid
ledge of quartz 6'oo feet wide and over 3000
feet long. No assay has been made, or if
there has, it nas been kept a secret. T.
Haley, an extensive mine-owner of Alaska,
in discussing the discovery, said that in
comparison with this vein, when it was
fully traced, the great Treadwell ledge
would have the appearance of being but a
mere stringer; that the indications were
that it would supply a 500-stamp mill for
fifty years.
SONOMA'S PREPARATIONS.
Success of the Hear Flag Celebration Is

SONOMA, Cal., June 10.â Preparations

listening to several patriotic addresses
every one will be ready to feast at the
barbecue, which begins at 1 p. m.
YREKA MURDER CASES.
Members of a Posse Arraigned for the
Killing of an Escaped
Criminal.
YREKA, Cai,., June 10.â John Hughes
and Joel M. Davis, separately charged
with murder for the killing of Frank W.
House at Etna, Siskiyou County, on May
28, 1896, had their preliminary examina
tions before E. W. Howell, Justice of the
Peace of Yreka Township, to-day. Hughes
was held to answer to the charge and
Davis was released.
Hughes and Davis were members of a
Sheriff's posse, organized by L. A. Mox
ley, Deputy Sheriff at Etna, for the pur
pose 01 capturing House, who escaped
from Moxiey while being held on a war
rant based on a complaint charging House
with a criminal attack upon his step
daughter. After his escape House got into
a thicket of brush near Etna. Hughes
came upon House and he jumped and ran.
Hughes called to him to stop, but House
continued running. Hujthes claimed he
fired to one side of him to intimidate him.
About five shots were fired at House.
Hughes, Davis and Johnny Baker admit
firing one shot each, but with no intention
of hitting House. House received two
bullets in the back, both of which passed
through his body. He died the same
evening. House, before his death, ad
mitted that the charge against him was
true.
QUIET ON THE COLUMBIA.
Militia Held Back Pending a Change in
the Situation.
PORTLAND, Ob., June 10.â No further
reports of riots among the Columbia River
fishermen were received up to this after
noon. Upon the assurances that until
"conditions warrant it" the militia will
not act, it is presumed that there is no
immediate prospect of the Oregon National
Guard being ordered to embarK. Gover
nor Lord this evening said to a Call cor
respondent that he would send no troops
to the scene of the fishermen's trouble
until the civil authorities assured him that
they were unable to cope with the situa
tion. He would not under other condi
tions enforce martial law.
VISALIA PLOTTERS' PLANS
Lovren and His Train-Robbers
Intended to Make Use of
Dynamite.
The Saioonist Was to Have Received
$5000 as His Share of the
Loot.
VISALIA, Cal., June 10.â It is not likely
that the trial of Silas Lovren for complicity
in the attempted train hold-up at Tagus
in March will be concluded this week.
General Kittrell for the defense believes
the testimony will not be all in at the end
of another week. The principal witnesses
to-day were E. J. Purcell of Los Angeles
and Obie Britt, the man who revealed the
plot to rob the train. Purcell was in the
Lovren saloon on March 7 and overheard j
a conversation between Ardell, Lovren's I
partner, and a man whom he did not i
know. The men were in the back yard of
the saloon, and he heard Ardell say:
"He'll know his voice."
"Suppose he doesn't open the door when
he's called," remarked the other man.
"Dynamite the thing. Blow her up.
Don't waste any time on it," was Ardell's
answer.
The other person was standing behind
Ardeil so the witness could not see him.
0. J. Meade, a special officer, said he
was informed of the intended hold-up on
the ISth of March, ana had received orders
to proceed on the northbound train, the
one that was to have been held up. He
arrested John Haynes the following morn
ing.
Obie Britt again told of the plans of the
plotters, which he had revealed to the offi- !
cers. Said he:
"One plan was for either McCall, Haynes
or myself to go to Tulare and get on the !
tender and rob the train between that
point and Tagus. Another plan was to I
take up a rail, and another was to burn a
bridge. McCall and myself drove over to |
Goshen on the afternoon of the Sunday |
before the robbery. "We turned south
alone the Southern Pacific and went to the
spot McCall had picked out as the dace to
rob the train. I dropped a marked paper
at the place so that the Sheriff's office |
would know the point where the hold-up !
would occur. We went out in the after
noon because McCail had to meet Ardell
at 12 o'clock. McCall told me that he had
been there that morning for the purpose
of becoming familiar with the country.
McCall said that Frank Davenport, Charles
Ardell and Silas Lovren would help us out
of the country if the officers suspected us.
He believed we would get about $30,000.
Lovren's and Ardell's share would be $10,
-000. McCall's intentions were to take
Haynes' portion and then kill Haynes."

NAPA, Cal., June 10.â The Grand
Parlor of Native Daughters reassembled in
Odd Fellows' Hall this morning. Grand
President Bertola was in the chair. After
the preliminary work was disposed
of, it was deckled, on the recom
mendation of the grand president,
that the past prand president, assisted by
members of the Grand Parlor, prepare a
programme for each Thursday afternoon
of the annual session, which shall pertain
to subjects of interest to subordinate par
lors, such as entertainment, how to re
plenish a treasury and how to increase the
membership.
Past Grand President Clara K. Witten
meyer was empowered to procure suitable
floral decorations for the grave of the de
ceased grand marshal, Evelyn Packard of
Eshcol Parlor, Napa, who was elected
grand marshal in 1889, but who, owing to
illness, could not fulfill the duties of her
office at the session in Santa Rosa the fol
lowing year.
The memory of the sunny disposition of
Mns Packard is green in the minds of the
members of the Grand Parlor, and it was
decided that at the close of the session the
Grand Parlor adjourn out of respect to her
memory.
An invitation to attend the celebration
of the fiftieth anniversary of the formal
raising of the American flag at Monterey
on July 7 was received. On the invitation
card were the following words:
Come in your golden tresses,
Come with filial caresses,
Come in your tioest dresses,
Come while time pressei

employes of that institution. Tue asylum
chapel was artistically decorated in their
honor.
The gallery and walls and proscenium
were clothed in red and yellow banners

WARRING WOMAN AT PORTLAND.
Attack Upon Catholicism Creates Dis
cord in ill* Congress. .
PORTLAND, Or., June 10. â Quite a
breeze was raised in the Oiegon Women's
Congress to-day. Mrs. General Thorpe ad
dressed the convention on "Woman in A.
P. A. Work." Her talk was received in
much the same way as would the hurling
of a bombshell into the hall. The speak
er's sentiments did not accord with the
feelings of some of her hearers, and while
portions of her remarks were approved, a
wholesale denunciation of Catholicism and
Catholics stirred up a row among the lair
listeners. In a portion of her paper Mrs.
ThorDe stated that Archbishop Ireland had
declared war against the public schools.
This statement was resented, and for a
time the president had difficulty in
smoothing matters over.
Rev. Mr. Elliott replied to some of the
statements in his remarks on "Women
Philanthropies."
The attendance at the congress has
steadily increased. .Susan B. Anthony
predicts that one result of this convention
will be the admission of Oregon women to
suffrage by the next election.
EUREKA MUST PAY.
Lawyers' Fees Resulting From the Anti-
Chinese Riots.
EUREKA, Cal., June 10.â In the suit of
S. M. Buck vs. the city of Eureka a jury
to-day allowed the plaintiff $4700 aa attor
ney fees for defendine the city in the Chi
nese litigation. The Chinese cases were
brought against the city to recover dam
ages for property destroyed in the riots in
1885, when the Mongolians were driven
out of the city and eventually from the
county. In the first suit Buck was given
$4250. The Supreme Court reversed the
decision, on the grounds that Buck was
City Attorney at the time. Suit was then
brought for services rendered after the ex
piration of his term.
George A. Knight has a similar suit on
the calendar which he will now push. He
was hired by Buck while City Attorney as
associate counsel.
THE CAP AY VALLEY CRIME
Toung McMillan the Cold- Blooded Mur
derer of A". S. Maxwell.
WOODLAND. Cal., June 10.â District
Attorney Hopkins returned from Capay
this evening, after investigating the mur
der of aged R. L. Maxwell. To-morrow
he will send warrants to the valley for the
arrest of a lad named McMillan, who
claimed to have shot Maxwell accident
ally.
From the facts learned, the District At
torney is of the opinion that young Mc-
Millan went to the old wood-chopper's
cabin to steal a rifle. Maxwell unex
pectedly came to the cabin and discovered
the boy, who then opened fire, blowing
out the old; man's brains. Young Mc-
Millan bears a bad reputation in the com
munity in which he resides, having been
detected in many mischievous acts.
Owing to his extreme youth District At
torney Hopkins will probably send him
to a reform school, instead of a peniten
tiary.

Santa Rosa Accident.
SANTA ROSA, Cal.. June 10.â A horri
rible accident that occured here this even
ing will probably cost James Kelly his life.
Kelly was driving a mowing machine, to
which was attached a pair of spirited
horses. The team got beyond his control
and dashed madly across a large field.
The unfortunate driver, in attempting to
regain control of the horses, was thrown
from his insecure seat â¢in front of the
rapidly moving blades of the mowing ma
chine. Both of bis wrists were broken and
he was injured internally by the heels of
the hcrses. His scalp was laid open by the
sharp blades of the machine.
SAN JOSE'S GAY WIDOW
Mrs. Parker's Record as " Mrs.
Brown " While in the
East.
Claimed to Be a Woman of Wealth
and Captured a Rich Young
Husband.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 10.â There was
an increased attendance at the trial of the
Parker will case to-day, and the beginning
of the taking of testimony for the re
spondents increased the interest.
During the argument for a non-suit the
contestant had a foretaste of the exposure
of her reputed career that was in store,
and in the afternoon she did not remain
in the courtroom long after the reading of
the deposit-ion of Jane Pomeroy was begun.
Juuge Reynolds rendered his decision
upon the motion for a non-suit. He said
there was sotae testimony that seemed to
have a tendency to prove some of the
allegations in the petition, and for this
reason the court had no rieht to take the
case from the jury.
The testimony for the respondents was
opened with the reading of the deposition
of Mary Jane Pomeroy of Hartford, Conn.,
known in the evidence as Jane Pomeroy.
During this reading Attorney Coonan,
for the contestant, said he understood
that Jane Pomeroy was in the State, and
it was urged that she should be present
herself and give her testimony.
"Mrs. Pomeroy is now in San Fran
cisco," responded Burchard. "but she is
there at the siue of her dead husband, who
passed away vesterclay."
The deposition was then allowed with
out further question. It faid :
"In 1870 Edward's father set him up in
business in the hat and furnishing line in
Hartford.
"He did not pay his board or lodcing
at our house. We intended to give him a
portion of our property. I first knew of
Edward's intention to marry Emma
Huugh two weeks before the marriage.
Edward came to us and said he wanted
to get married to a rich widow frcm Cali
fornia.
"We told him he had better be careful
and investigate as to her, but he said he
had to marry her right away, as she
wanted to return to California. He seemed
to think from something she said that if
he did not marry her immediately she
would return to California and he would
lose her.
"The woman did not, he said, tell him
how much she was worth, but that she
had real estate and stocks and bonds. He
said she was the widow of George L.
Brown. He died at the Orcideutal Hotel
and was buried at Lone Mountain, beside
the Broderick monument.
"After their marriage we received them
as members of our family in our house
hold. We had heard thro.igh some one
that Edward's wife was not wnat s c pre
tended to be, that she had lived m one
place and another, and I aske.i her one
day for on explanation.
"This was shortly after she came to us.
She said her first husband, Brown, had.
been very kind to her. He hud taken her
on drives, and every morning he threw all
the money she wanted into her lap. She
said he died suddenly one day at the hotel,
hue told about a diamond breastpin that
showed in a picture of her first husband
that sue exhibited.
"Edward's wile soon began to make de
mands for money for dresses, etc. I then
knew that her claim of being wealthy was
fal*e, and I wrote a letter to Edward's
lather in regent to the mat er.
"In the letter to my brother I advised
him to investigate as to whether or not
Kuch a man as G. L. Brown had died in
San Francisco and as to whether or not
his widow had any property on Powell
street, as she claimed. I also sent to my
brother the picture that Emma Parker
ha l said was a pho ograph of her first
husband, Mr. Brown.
The writer said the picture sent on pur
porting to be that of Brown was found to
be that of a man named Tillinghast, who
was at that time alJve and well. He was a
wealthy Enclishman and was well known
in San Francisco' as a clubman.
The opinion was expressed that Edward
had been caught in a trap, and that his
wife had littered falsehoods in all the
statements she had made. She never
owned any property on Powell street.
The man Mitchell had also been seen, and
he said he did not know of any husband
that she had ever had.
"This letter was read to Edward Parker.
There was then loud talk between Edward
and his wife.
Objections were then made to the read
ing of testimony about the conversation
between Edward Parker and his wife, on
the ground that such communications
were privileged, and pending the argu
ment upon this point the case was con
tinued until to-morrow morning at 10
o clock.

CHINESE SACK A MISSION
White Teachers Defend Their
Lives With Phio's at
Kiangyin.
A Mob Incited io Att ick by the
Deception o' a Mongolian
Doct r
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 10.â Oriental
advices received today report that a
Chinese quack doctor, frustraud in a
bunko game by an American missionary
at Kiangyin, attempted revenge by an
nouncing that Amr>rican missionaries had
killed children and buried t em in a back
yard of the mission chapel.
A magistrate who was sent for de
mandi-d of the quack that he unearth the
children. The fakir dug furiously in the
back yard and actua Iv found a dead in
fantâ oni he had previously buried there
himself.
A big mob of Chinese had collected and
when they saw the dead baby they be
came frantic wit rage and attempted to
pass the chapel door. They were held at
bay by revolvers in the hands of the
American missionaries. The magistrate
asked for quiet and said to the mission
aries
"How Jong have you had that thing
here? You all see that it is a child. What
have you to say for yourselves?"
The missionarieÂ« answered that they
knew nothing about it. The package con
taining the infant was then sent out
through the crowd, which numbered
several hundred. When they saw and
comprehended what it meant â so coifiim
atory proof of all their reports and be
liefsâa yell of rage went up. Every man
was carrying a club, knife or reaping hook,
and all were yelling: "Kill the bar
barians."
The officials could not control the crowd.
The missionaries determined to escape to
a nearby fort. Driving the crowd back
into the front yard at the point of pistols,
they made a dash through a rear gate.
They then made a long circuit, but were
pursued for more than a mile. Finally
they reached the fort, very much ex
hausted, but not otherwise injured.
Fortunately there were no white women
or children in Kiangyin at the time. The
mission property was looted, everything
liein^ carried off and tne buildings dis
mantled.
Betore the Empress of Japan left, Honan
solilirs had been called out and every
effort was bpjng made to quietthe people.
The missionaries, assistants and servants
had been imprisoned. They have put
their case into the hands of the United
States Consul at Chinkiang.
WOULD LEAVE COOKS INLET.
Miners Disgusted With Conditions in
the Aor'fccrn Country.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 10.â Hon. A.
K. Delaney, United Stat s JuÂ«ige for the
Di>trict of Alaska who arrived in Seattle
this morning on the steamship Al-Ki, says
all sections of that country are overrun
and overdone with fortune-seekers. This
appears to he especially the case through
the Cooks Inlet locality, from which ad
v rse reports as to the condition of affairs
continue to be received In this city. Police
man Grant is in receipt of a letter from F.
J. McGrade, Six- mile Creek, in which the
writer says in part:
"Snow and ice cover everything, and
very little work can be done this summer.
Many miners are disgusted and would
start home now if walking was good."'
Having announced that eggs were sell
ing for 60 cents per dozen, other food ar
ticles being proportionately high, Mc-
Grade concludes: "The steamer General
Canby, in which we came, is a dangerous
vessel, and several times during the pas
sage up we expected to go to the bottom."
The General Canby is an old hulk that
was repaired and fitted out in this city by
the famous Excelsior party of Boston and
Oakland capitalists. \
WOODLAND JAIL TRAGEDY
Convict Steumrt Attempts to Hang Him
self in Bis Cell.
WOODLAND, Cal., June 10.-Charles
Stewart, alias "Boots," who was convicted
of robbing Postmaster Morrin of Rumsey
several months apo, attempted suicide by
strangulation in his cell at the County
Jail this morning. Stewart is languishing
in jail waiting the result of an appeal of
his case to the Supreme Court, and long
confinement has resulted in despondency.
When Jailer la Brie went to Stewart's
cell to-day with xhe prisoner's dinner, he
heard a fall inside. On opening the cell
door he found Stewart lying on the floor
nnconscious, with blood gushing from
both ears. He was soon resuscitaed, and
is now out of danger. He had torn his
blankets into strips, tied the ends to
gether, and in this way made a noose
with which he attempted to hang him
self, but the strips broke under his weight.
DAIRYMEN AT FERNDALE.
Producers of Butter and Cheese
Preparing for the State
Convention.
Scientific Methods to Be Discussed
by Noted Agricultural
Chemists.
FERNDALE, Cal., June 10.â Extensive
preparations are being made by the re
siding dairymen of this county to enter
tain th*ir brother members of the State
Dairy Association, which convenes here
on June 15 and 16 and at Arcata on June
18 and 19. T.e Pacific Coast Steamship
Company has given reduced rates, and "a
goodly number of members throughout
the State will attend, including such noted
agricultural cherai-ts as Professor Jaffa
and Regent Wood worth of the university.
Science is making rapid progress in its
application to dairying. The object o!
this meeting is to further the butter in
dustry, which now ranks as the second in
dustry on this coast. California produces
over 32,000.000 pounds per year, and, ac
cording to late statistics, there are 340,000
cows in the State.and yet butter is imported
from the East. There is no apparent
reason for this. By the improved methods
local dairymen are able to produce as fine
a quality of butter as that sent from any
part of the United States.
Among the subjects suggested for dis
cussion at the convention will be the im
proving of the quality of cheese; the
establishing of a dairy school for men and
women; the necessity for stringent dairy
laws; encouragement for the establishing
of condense i milk factories; the creation
of a sentiment favorable to home dairy
products; the best methods of cultivating
markets and of marketing, includng the
packing of butter for warm climates; the
importance of pood roads in relation to
dairying ; the method of exhibiting at the
Home Products Exposition, which will be
held at the Mechanics' Pavilion, San Fran
cisco, opening on September 1. under the
auspices of the Mechanics' Institute and
the Manufacturers and Producers' Asso
ciation of California.

NEAR SAN MIGUEL
Searchers for Dunham Find
The Trail of Another
Outlaw.
PURSUIT OF TWO MEN.
Efforts Are Now Being Made to
Capture the Alameda
Escape.
SEEN AT SEVERAL POINTS.
Officers Fear That They Have Been
Tracking the Wrong Man
From the First
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., June 10.â A
search in this vicinity for Murderer Dun
ham, the destroyer of the McGlincy fam
ily at Campbells, has resolved itself into a
pursuit of the escaped Outlaw Crowley. It
was Crowley, and not Dunham, who
stopped a woman on a road near San
Miguel yesterday and begged for food, and
later dined at the home of a rancher.
When Sheriff Ballou was apprised of the
presence of a stranger in the hills near
San Miguel he gave the matter consider
able thought in a short space of time, and
concluded that the description of the man
met on the road near San Miguel might fit
some one else other than Dunham. He
took a photograph of Dunham and one of
Philip Crowley and started for San Mi
guel. He at once visited the woman who
had been halted by the stranger and
8- owed to her the two photographs. She
recognized Crowley's photograph as that
of the man who had begged for something
to eat from her. She positively identified
the picture of Crowley.
This puts more excitement into the
chase of Dunham, for Crowley, who is
badly wanted, and who is known to be a
very desperate man, is now sharing the at
tention of the pursuers. It is supposed
that Crowley, after having a brush with
Sheriff Borgwardt and posse near the
Aqua Caliente ranch a short time ago,
came northward toward San Miguel, and
is now probably heading for the Los
Burros mines, better known as "Cruik
shank" mines. Officers Kelshaw and
Sanders of Paso Robles started out to
b for Crowley last night.
Meanwhile the search for Dunham is
progressing. Sheriff Matthews and posse
left Sau Miguel two days ago with fresh
horsese and headed for Hog Canyon, a
few miles northeast of San Miguel. They
will work their way thence over to the
(iarisa Plains and across the Tulare
Plains to the San Joaquin Valley. All
mountain passes are guarded and there is
hardly a rancher in the San Miguel,
Chulame or Hog Canyon country who is
not oi) the lookout for Dunham. If Dun
ham is anywfier-3 in that section he will
prehended, as Matthews and his men
are leaving no stone unturned and are fol
lowing what they consider a good trail.
T::e country in places is very rough until
the plains are reached. There the land is
comparatively level.
One contingency which is alarming the
ra is that they may have been pursu
ing Crowley from the start, instead of
Dunham, and that while on the outlaw's
trail the Campbells butcher may have es
caped over the borders of the State.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia, which got in from Honolulu yester
day, had a very rough experience during
the last night of her run. It began to blow
about 11 p. m. iast Tuesday, and by mid
night it was blowing a gale. The waves
broke continuously over the vessel and
one burst in the forward skylight. Water
poured into the staterooms and the din
ing-room and steerage were flooded. Cap
tain Houdlette and Chief Officer Lawless
were drenched again and again by the
spray, and everybody aboard had an un
comfortable night. The storm was all the
more a surprise, as the entire trip up to
that time had been a most delightful one.

The steamer Kahului, which left here
some months apo, has not been in very
good luck in the Southern seas. She went
ipperton Island for guano, but se
cured only 200 tons. On the way back
one of tho saiiors htole a watch and as
saulted the first officer. He was placed
in irons and turned over to the authorities
at Honolulu. The Kahului will load
t for San Francisco.
Thomas Bailey, the oldest foreman
stevedore, on the waterfront, wasdis
missed by the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company. The reason stated was
retrenchment. For nine years Bailey
served on the HoJliday line and for the
la-: twenty years he was practically in the
employ of Goodall, Perkins & Co.
All kinds of rumors about the steamer
Zealandia have been floating around the
front for weeks. The latest was that she
was to |Z'> io Santa Cruz during the July
festivities. When coal was put into her
bunkers yesterday this idea was strength
ened. Everybody is wrong, however, and
the Zealandia is going to Martinez to
lie up.
The coal put in her was what the Pacific
Mail Company owed the ship. There was
so much coal in her bunkers when she was
turned over to them and just Ijo tons less
when they returned her. They repaid the
coal yesterday, and the steamer will be
towed to her anchorage tomorrow.
The steamer Peru sailed for Japan and
China yeterday. She had an unusually
hsavy cargo, but very few passengers. T.
W. Leydecker, the well-known pigeon
fancier, sent one of his birds out with the
steamer. It is to be released at 7 o'clock
this morning, or when the vessel has been
fourteen hours at sea. Leydecker expects
the bird to make the return trip in a few
hours.
The Hawaiian bark Santiago, which
arrived from Hilo yesterday, was also
caught in Tuesday night's gale. When it
was at its height L. Brehm, a native of
Denmark, aged 34, was washed overboard
and drowned. It was impossible to lower
a boat, owing to the heavy cross sea.
The bark Orion, which is laid up at Sau
salito, was on fire yesterday morning.
The watchman discovered a fire in the
storeroom, and before it was put out dam
age of $250 was done. The cause of the fire
is unknown.
PAINT AND OIL ON FIRE.
A Dangeroui) Blaze Last Night in tbe
Bancroft Building.
At 9 o'clock last evening there was an
ugly fire in tbe Bancroft building on Mar
ket street, and an alarm was sounded from
box 48. It started on the fourth floor in
Smith & Young's paint, oil and glass de
partment, it is supposed from spontaneous
combustion. The discovery was made by
the students in R. Vander Naillen's School
of EiiKineering on the fihh floor.
When the occupants noticed the smoke
arising from the lower floor there was a
stampede to escape and the wife of the
professor fainted during the excitement
and had to be carried from the building.
The damage to Smith & Young's stock
was $1000, fully covered by insurance.
Ellinger's fringe factory on the fifth floor
suffered about $250 damage by the smoke.
Three firemen attached to chemical en
gine No. 1 nearly lost their lives. Gabriel
Woods, William Rice and William Mitch
ell were operating the chemical hose on
the fifth floor. The dense smoke almost
suffocated the three before they were
rescued. Woods was restored after being
removed to the Receiving Hospital. The
other two regained consciousness after
being taken out into the fresh air. The
building was not badly damaged.
DANGER IN THE GLOOM
It Lurks in the Impending Dark
ness Due to Lack of
Funds.
Taxpayers Are Indignant at the High
Tax and No Service â Police
Preparing.
Two dollars and twenty-five cents per
centum for taxes in the City of San Fran
cisco and no money in the treasury to pay
for street lights.
It has been in every mouth for the past
few days. No matter where one goes about
town he hears it, and the more this
anomaly in municipal financiering is dis
cussed the greater is the indignation of
thinking taxpayers and citizens generally.
Two dollars and twenty-five cents taxes
and no money for lights.
It is freely admitted by every man in
town who has given the matter any
thought that somebody in control of City
affairs is to blame, or more liKely several
City officials are responsible for,this alarm
ing condition of affairs.
\Vhen taxes were less than half what
they are this year San Francisco was not
driven into vexatious and dangerous dark
ness, as she is now threatened. To recon
cile the present with past conditions in the
municipal manipulation of San Francisco,
in face of this street-light affair, has puz
zled many a citizen. Indeed, it is only
now that householders are waking to the
fact and the real condition confronting
them.
The order has gone forth from the Board
of Supervisors that the City shall be in
darkness for more than two weeks. There
was no more coin in sight for appropria
tions, not even for current and absolutely
essential and necessary expenses of the
City.
And now taxpayers are wondering how
they may pilot themselves over the dan
gerous sidewalks and crossings after sun
down. Visions of the-festive burglar glory
ing in his new sense of security, the
murderous footpad at every other turn
and corner and crime i am pant under cover
of the blackness of these dark nights have
arisen in many homes.
The police say that it is their experience
that highway robbery and crime have al
ways assumed terrifying proportions in
such dark spells as the one at hand in San
Francisco. Acting upon this knowledge
they are already making preparations for
protecting life and property.
They are shadowing characters known
to them, and may find it expedient to take
off some day watches and concentrate
their efforts by doubling patrols all night,
more particularly in the Western Addi
tion.
People are wondering also how the fire
boxes, indicated by red lamps, can be
found in case of fire* after dark. Tiie fire
men, too, regard the impending gloom
with misgivings, for they will have many
rough experiences in their work.
P. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chants' Association, said:
I don't see that anything can be done now to
secure light. Indignation meetings and mass
me'-'tings would be of no use. It would be like
locking the stable door after the horse is
stolen. The only way 1 see for guarding
against a repetition is to secure the new
charter. Not that the charter or anything else
would prevent squandering the contents of the
treasury, but if we can get a new charter we
lire? likely to secure a better class of office
holders. Under the present system it is a
scramble for the spoils of office by every new
batch of officials elected. It is a grab for
everything in sight while the opportunity
lasts. No one will acknowledge being re
sponsible as it is now, but under the new
charier we can fix the responsibility where it
belongs.
Tiiis feature will induce the better Class of
i the community to see that none but first-class
i men, who will take a pride in the City's wel
' fare instead of scrambling for spoils, are
i elected to office. This period of darkness that
1 we have been promised will be a splendid ob
ject-lesson to the people of San Fruncisco. It
will cause them to desire reform in the man
agement of public affairsâ just such reform as
is promised under the proposed new charter.
For the present there is nothin? to be done in
this matter, except for those who are obliged
to be out late to carry lanterns.
J. Richard Freud, secretary of the Mer
chants' Association, agreed with the presi
dent of the organization and said:
The darkness that will soon fall upon the
City will make many friemis for the mer
chants. I hope that the people will remember,
when they g<> to the polls to vote on that ques
tion, their experience while groping along
dark streets. If the water and other neces
saries were shut off with the lights for tne
same cause four days before the election, I am
pure that not over a dozen people would vote
against the new charter.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 1896.
DAGGETT IS THE
CONVENTION ISSUE
So the Chief Democratic
Battle Is Over Frank
Gould.
MINT FORCES ARE BUSY.
Gould's Brother-in-Law Has Just
Been Given a Fat Mint
Job for Life.
FOOTE'S BOOM IS RISING.
The End of the Week Will See
White, Foote or Another Party
Hero in the Race.
So remarkable is the change that in two
weeks has come over the prospect of the
Democratic State Convention which is
billed at Sacramento for next Tuesday
that John Daggett has become the chief
convention issue instead of the National
financial policy of the party and the wis
dom with which the affairs of this great
Republic have been administered for four
years.
Will John Daggett get there ? Answer
this and you may tell in advance the story
of the convention.
"Will Gould be chairman?" is the same
question. Answer it and tell thereby the
probable future of the San Francisco
Democracy, name the bosses who will run
Democratic State politics for two years,
reveal the money plank in the platform
that is to be reported to the convention
and call a long roll of politicians, telling
which ones will rise and which descend.
The other prominent issue before tbe
convention is the local contest between
the Junta and the Buckleyites, and this is
bound up with and dependent on the joint
issue of Daggett's boss-ship and Gould's
chairmanship.
So it is about the chairmanship that the
hustling, the bitter words and the inter
ested speculation mainly collects. It is
to and away from Gould that delegates
from the Brown Bear mine to the Salton
Sea are being pulled and hauled. The
struggles of the Buckleyites and their
friends have become more direct efforts to
beat Gould than to pledge delegates to
their own cause.
Those whose hands are against John
Daggett are turning their guns on Frank
Gould.
The indications that Gould will be de
feated appeared stronger yesterday.
Gould's prospects look strong, because he
is tbe only candidate in the field so far,
his opponents say, and they say that his
boom won't seem to stick up so high if
Foote or White are put up against him.
It is the almost universal judgment in
the party that either White or Foote will
be given the chairmanship with a whoop
if they will, even at the last moment .con
sent to let their names go before the con
vention.
W. W. Foote's boom, being worked by
his friends without his consent, grew in
volume yesterday, but without revealing
anything furt er'that was definite regard
ing the probability of his consenting to
openly go into the held.
Hisfriends declare that he will be forced
to take it, and there is no doubt of the re
"THE CALL" RACING CHART.

suit in many minds if he goes into the
race. Tremendous pressure is being
brought to bear on him. He still declares
that he is not a candidate, but it is under
stood among his friends that he will likely
succumb to the pressure if he fully make?
up his mind that Gould's chairmanship
means the ascendancy of Dagtett. This
appears to them so plain a proposition
that his answer is given in advance.
The anti-Daggett forces want to unite on
either Foote or White. A majority will
go to either, according to which becomes
easiest to get to the front in the interest of
party harmony. Senator White is ex
pected to arrive in Lob Angeles to-morrow
night. Upon his arrival the possibilities
of his candidacy will be better known. A
press dispatch from Los Angeles, to be
Found in another column, indicates that
there are no definite ideas among the Los
Angeles Democrats as to the possibilities
of his candidacy. The Los Angeles dele
gation of thirty-nine would be solid for
either White or Foote for chairman, be
yond any doubt.
That the strongest possible candidate
will be run against Gould now appears to
be an absolute certainty. The candidate
may not appear until Saturday or Mon
day, but those opposed to Gould say that
any sterling and popular Democrat having
the confidence of the party and in line with
the popular sentiments of the party would
beat Gould in a walk.
McNab and Daggett's workers are de
claring that Gould's election has been
made absolutely sure. But they are
reckoning on getting in the 161 Junta
votes for the temporary organization.
This part of the McNab-Daggett-Gould
programme may possibly be carried out,
but it is extremely improbable. From
outside of the City 141 votes were claimed
to be pledged to Gould. Six more would
give Gould a majority of one with the
solid Junta delegation, and these they ex
pect to easily secure.
But the votes promised to Gould are
those of politicians, largely, and tied to
him by cold patronage forces, weak or
strong. Heartiness, admiration, esteem,
personal friendship and loyalty do not
give soul to the Gould campaign, and his
support lacks the swing and enthusiasm
that would put fire and momentum into a
boom for such men as Foote and White.
This is part of the philosophy of those
who predict Gould's defeat.
Daggett and McNab are working with
exciting but quiet industry. Daggett's
Mint lieutenants were hustling yesterday
early and late, scouring the City for Junta
delegates, searching for every possible
proxy that might be laid hold of, and
otherwise obeying orders.
Ed Lanigan has become the active out
side boss ot the practical work among the
"push." Rainey must needs keep in the
background, and since Lanigan formed
his partnership with Rainey the Mint em
ployes have been told to take orders from
Lanigan, whose doings are in turn super
intended by Dageett and Ilaiuey.
Daggett and McNab are trying to save
Gould from the curse of being Daggett's
candidate and to shield him from exposi
tions of the political intimacy between
them. Yesterday another of the many
evidences of this political combination
was rushed out by Gould's opponents.
It transpired that less than three weeks
ago Daggett gave Gould one of the fattest
patronage plums in the Mint. For a long
time Harry T. Hastings, brother-in-law of
Gould, has* been a watchman at the Mint
at $2 50 a day, being one of the appoint
ments given to Gould some time ago.
On May 25 Hastings was promoted to
the position of registrar of deposits in
the Superintendent:* department at $2000
a year. Hastings will have the job for
life, as the position goes into the classified
service under Cleveland's recent civiPser
vice order. Thomas E. Collins, who was
removed, was a friend of Chief Clerk
Barnett, who was recently discharged, and
he was given Hastings' old job at $2 50 a
day.
With some of the largest delegations in
the State, including Los Angeles, a ma
jority of Alameda, Santa Clara, Solano,
Monterey and others solidly against
Gould, with the Knowledge or beliet that
Gould is expected to do his share for the
Daggett combination by recognizing the
Junta and appointing committees on or
der of business, platform and credentials
and a State executive committee, in Dag
gett's interest, and with the flood of oppo
sition to this capture of the State ma
c:iine, the anti-Gould forces are betting
good money that a high-grade chairman
will rule that convention.
BURGLARS LOOT
A MISSION HOME
In Broad Daylight Two
Thieves Do Effective
Work.
COSTLY JEWELS TAKEN.
Mrs. Herman Nolt's House on
Twenty-First Street Is
Ransacked.
ROBBERS ARE WEIL REPAID.
They Enter Genteelly While Neighbors
Look On, and Take Everything
Portable.
The fin de siecle burglar who enters
residences in thickly settled neighbor
hoods in broad daylight, thoroughly and
systematically loots the houses and suc
cessfully makes off with his well-selected
booty, has again given evidence of his
prowess. The dwelling of Mr. and Mrs.
Herman Nolt, at 3520 Twenty-first street,
is the scene of his latest operations, and in
many respects this depredation is one of
tne most atrocious yet reported.
Mrs. Nolt, who is an artist, started out
ye.-terday afternoon, as is her custom each
Wednesday, on a professional visit. As
she passed the corner of Dolores and
Twenty-first streets she noticed a man
watching intently in the direction of her
residence, but she paid little attention to
his appearance. A few moments later two
men approached the residence and in
quired of two little boys who were playing
near if that was where Mrs. Nolt lived.
One of the lads pointed to the house
and gave the information that she was
not at home. He then ran into his
mother's bouse and informed Miss Gould,
who has a room at Mrs. Nolt's house, but
was calling on her neighbor, of the men's
inquiry. Miss Gould looted out of tbe
window and observed two men gazing at
the house. They were respectably dressed
and she paid little attention 10 them, so
little that she declares herself utterly un
able to describe them, save in most gen
eral terms. That is the only clew to the
marauders.
When Mrs. Nolt returned about 5 o'clock
the first thirie that greeted her eyes was
the writing-desk in the front room in a
state of disorder. As she had been using
it just before soing out she saw at once
that it had been tampered with. An ex
amination showed that it hal been com
pletely ransacked and a number of valu
able articles of jewelry taken. Hurrying
to her own room she found things In the
greatest confusion imaginable. Bureau
drawers had been pulledftut and emptied,
the bed had been overtuified and nook and
cranny gave evidence of having been
searched. From here the most valuable
articles were taken, including jewelry and
articles of clothing.
Miss Gould's room was also given most
thorough inspection. A fine watch and
chain and a magnificent Ceylon ring, set
with a cinnamon sapphire, were among
her losses. She also lost a locket which
was treasured as a parting gift from her
mother, long since dead.
In the dining-room the burglars had
evidently brought their operations to a
sudden end. From this room only three
souvenir spoons were taken, though there
was much valuable plate which nothing
but an interruption could account for the
burglars not taking.
The missing articles most prized by Mrs.
Nolt are a beautiful gold bracelet, set with
turquoise, and a diamond pin belonging to
her husband. The former was a family
heirloom besides being of considerable in
trinsic value. The pin she had given to
her husband just before their marriage.
Besides these she lost a plain gold brace
let, seven cold pins, a complete set of silver
jewelry and the three silver souvenir spoons
mentioned. Two new pairs of trousers, a
vest and a revolver belonging to Mr. Nolt
were taken.
Nothing was destroyed about the house
and neither windows nor doors were in
jured, showing that the thieves must
have entered by means of a latchkey.
They were evidently experts and knew
their grounds.
RACING SEASON CLOSED
A Great Crowd Attends the Last
Day's Sport at Ingle
side Track.
THE TALENT WEEE IN FORM.
Thornhill Defeats Rey Del Bandidos
in the Long-Distance EventâStub
fcornly Contested Finishes.
The racing season was brought to a close
at Ingleside track yesterday. Over 5000
people were in attendance and a perfect
carnival of sport was witnessed. The
grand stand was filled with ladies and the
betting ring with an eager, expectant
throng of speculators. The betting was of
the fiercest order, the books being assailed
with a hurricane of coin. Jobbery was not
tolerated, contrary to the usual custom of
"getaway day. " The judges were on the
keen alert for anything that bordered on the
unsavory and the result was a grand day
of sport. Three favorites, three second
choices and one outsider winning purses
speaks volumes for the quality of the
racing.
And as the long period of racing draws
to an end a word in favor of the new rac
ing organization, the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club, would not, to use racetrack vernacu
lar, "be out of line." The club has lived
up to every promise made horsemen at the
opening of its meeting. It has given rich
purses without the impoverishine entrance
fee. Its aim has been to furnish good,
clean sport without showing partiality to
none. The officials have heard tha woes
of the humblest as well as the richpst of
the horsemen racing on its track, and all
hafe been treated with equal courtesy.
Launched on tho top wave of success all
wish the new association continued
prosperity.
It was first thought that the day's
pleasure was to be marred by a bad acci
dent in tbe hurdle race, but happily the
unfortunate riders escaped with injuries
that will shelve them for only a short
period. The race in particular was at
one and three-eighths miles with five
hurdles to clear. Silverado, with Owens
up, was a 2 to 1 favorite, but ran unplaced.
Huntsman, vicing with Bellringer at 3 to
1 for second choice honors, won cleverly
at the finish from Hanford, a long-priced
outsider. At the first obstacle North and
Bellringer took bad headers, but their
respective riders, Maynard and T.
Murphy, lucsily escaped with nothing
more serious than broken collar-bones.
The two and a quarter mile handicap
ended in a very pretty contest, but the
record remains unbroken. Rev Del
Bandidos at 3 to 5 had the pul.l in the
ring, but his stable companion, Thorn
hill, the second choice, outcained him in
the stretch and in a drive was first by half
a length in 4:00J-i.
In the mile handicap Olive disappointed
her friends sadly. Starting a4to 5 favor
ite she wound up third, weakly ridden by
Piggott. In a hard drive Coady got the 8
to 1 shot Instigator home a nose before
Articus, who was cut off at least three
times and made a great run from last the
fraction. The time, I:42'^, was a good
performance.
The seven furlong handicap resulted in
an equally good contest. Yankee Doodle
was a heavily played even money favorite,
but after at one stage of the game showing
in front, was obliged to be content with
third place. In a hard drive the 8 to 5
second choice, Reinart, splendidly ridden
by the "barrier champion," Shields,
gained the verdict by a head in 1 :28.
The Cambridge stable came in for an
other dose of bidding-up in the first race
on the card, a one mile and a sixteenth
selling affair, with a field or seven starting.
Red Glen was a prohibitive choice at 2 to
5 and won cleverly at the finish from Jack
Richelieu, alsto 1 shot. When put up to
be sold Tom Boyle, owner of Jack Riche
lieu, bid the winner up to $700 over his
entered selling price of $300.
After a change of jockeys Lady Heloise,
backed from 4 to 1 oft the boards, captured
the half-mile dash for two-year-olds, after
leading most of the way, in 50 seconds flat.
The Plunger, backed down from 20 to 4 to
1, was a good second.
The last event at six furlongs was a bit
of a snap for the El Primero stable's Sum
mer time, a4to 5 favorite. Passing Road
warmer and Peixotto entering the stretch
she passed the stand a hanuy winner over
Heartsease.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Cairns, the steeplechase rider, is eligible
to ride on tracks not racing under the
rules o fthe Western Turf Congress.
The stewards reinstated W. Carroll,
owner of Paros, who was suspended for
an intent at crookedness in connection
with his ride on the mare Miss Gentry
some days ago.
Owner "Mike" Donovan's fast filly De
cision, by imp. Wagner, dam Fleta, died
at the Bay District track yesterday from a
complication of diseases.
The judges removed Hazlett from the
mount on Wawona in the opening race,
and put Picgott up in his stead. The odds
took a tumble and he finished third.
Just before post time the judges replaced
Espinosa on Lady Heloise with Shields.
Before the shift the filly was a 4 to 1
chance, but when the field started for the
post her odds were nearly rubbed off the
boards, one or two books laying 2 to 1.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
Backsliders Among the Painters Likely
to Cause Troubleâ Shinglers
Supported.
From all indications there will be lively
times in the Painters' Union before long.
It seems that there are a number of mem
bers of the organization who are not living
up to union rules, and this has caused
great dissatisfaction on the part of law
abiding members.
This matter was brought up at the meet
ing last evening and it was decided to call
the offenders to time. Not desiring to
take snap judgment, it was decided to call
a special meeting of the union for next
Saturday evening to take action in the
premises.
At a meeting of the Metal-workers'
Union the committee appointed to looir
after the City Hall roof matter made its
report of the meetinp with the Commis
sioners. The delegates to the Building

About this time people who prophesy

There will be no bolt from St. Louis big
enough to close the door to victory.
Carlisle's explanation was long, but it
wa? not broad enough to cover the subject.
California will be solid at the St. Louis
convention, and solid for it* work after

In its last analysis the St. Louis plat

Vining's transfer nuisance has gone to

The nearest road to municipal economy
is that of straight politics and Republican

This week and next the St. Louis hotel

The greatest of money issues are wages

The great West desires free silver, but

The Sutro administration has maue

A community of this size that will per

It would be better for the Supervisors to

the candidates to the maintenance of the
single gold standard. These reports must
of course be discounted to some extent.
Conventions rarely act m accord with
street rumors. It seems assured that
McKinley wilJ be nominated, but it is by
no means so csrt&in that the platform will
Ueeiare f^r an extreme stand on the money
issue.
The men who lead the Republican party
ami who will formulate its platform at St.
Louis are not doctrinaires. They are sa
gacious statesmen and practical politi
cians, capable of seeing both sides of a
question and abla to deal with it in a
statesmanlike manner. These men are not
likely to draw a platform in accordar.ee
with the demands of doctrinaires or ex
tremists. They will consider the senti
ment of the party as a whule on the sub
ject of finance and will aim to give a true
expression of it in the platform.
This view of the probabilities i? strength
ened by the declarations of the various
Kepublican State conventions. Some have
declared outright for free silver coinage,
and others for the single gold standard.
Most of them, however, took a conservative
course, and while they did not "straddle
the issue," made the platform broad
enough for all Republicans who are not so
excited on one side or the other of this
issue as to be willing to sacrifice every
thing else for it, even to the extent ol
running the rhk of another four years of
Democratic misrule.
Giving to the reports of the day the full
est credence possible to be given to pre
dictions of future events, it seems more
than likely the convention will content
itself with declaring against the imme
diate and independent free coinage of sil
ver by this country at the ratio of 16 to 1.
That would not be a straddle nor a dodge,
but it â¢would satisfy the conservative sold
men without alienating those bimetalhsts
who would be driven off by a decla ration
for the gold standard absolutely.
The Republican party in this campaign
has no need to dodge. The popular senti
ment in favor of a return to protection
and a restoration to power of a narty that
knows how to govern is sufficient to in
sure Republican victory under almost any
circumstances. Nevertheless there is no
reason why the National Convention
should take extreme on the money
question, ana we do not believe it will.
McKinley's nomination is assured, and in
the feeling of harmony which now prevails
we have every reason to believe the silver
wing of the party will be included and the
platform will be broad enough for all to
stand on.
DARENESS WILL PREVAIL.
The City will have to get along without
street lighting during the last half of the
month. There does not appear to be any
help for it, unless the citiz2ns will go down
in their pocket-books and pay the bill.
The appropriation for lighting the streets
will be exhausted in a few days, and the
money that is set aside for the year com- j
mencing on the first day of July is not
available for tuis month's bills.
Naturally there is great indignation
among the people, but it is just possible
that tliey have been remiss in their duty
at tho polls en election days. It certainly
is true that theie is something radically
wrong somewhere when a great and rich
City like San Francisco has to sit in dark
ness for half a month because there is
no money in the treasury to pay gas and
eiectric-light bills.
There are those who rather rejoice at
the prospect of a half month of darkness,
for they think that a heroic remedy is
needed to cure the indifference which
prevails concerning the conduct of
the public affairs of the people, but
while that may be true, the fact
remains that fifteen nights of dark
ness may mean fifteen nights of
lawlessness such as no community should
think of without trembling. No doubt
way< and means could be provided to tide
the City over until the new fund is avail
able, but what is everybody's business is
nobody's business, as it would seem.
THE GOOD OF A FALSE RUMOR
2S"o doubt the rumor That the President
was about to recognize the belligerency
of the Cuban republic, which was circu
lated in Wall street yesterday, was manu
factured on the Stock Exchange for specu
lative purposes. At all events, the whole
list suffered a decline in prices and the
bears made a good haul of profits. Of
course the rumor traveled fast and grew
as it traveled, and when it reached San
Francisco it stated as positive fact that
the President had actually issued such a
proclamation.
The rumor had no foundation in fact,
but it served to show how deeply inter
ested our people are in the weiiara of the
Cubans. One could hear expressions of
approval of the President's action on
every hand, and the only criticism was
that the matter had been delayeu so Jong.
One could not help observing that the
merits of the cause of the Cubans was not
discussed at all. It was Weyler'a bru
tality and the seeming approval of his
fiendish work by the Madrid Government
that made those who heard the rumor
rejoice that this Government had at last
given the insurgents official notice. It
waa the possibility of an opportunity for
the United States to give Spain a sound
thrashing that pleased the people.
It is no doubt tbe fact that no nation
was ever held in greater contempt than
Spain is by the people of North and South
America, and were the Cubans without an
excuse for rebelling against the mother
country, the metnods employed by "\Vey
ler and other generals of the Spanish
army would create a sympathy for them
which would take most substantial form
were opportunity offered. This Wall-street
rumor might be studied by Spain as a
straw showing which way the current of
puolic sentiment is flowing in this coun
try.
DODGES THE QUESTION.
Secretary Carlisle's reply to the inquiry
of the Senate concerning, the circumstances
connected with the sale of Government
bonds in the years 1894-95-% fails to give
the satisfaction that was hoped for. In
stead of a clear and unvarnished state
ment of ihe facts the Secretary submits
an argument in justification of the several
sales, with an apparent effort to lead
away from the real thing that the Senate
wanted to know about. There is no doubt
at all that the figures Mr. Carlisle sub
mits are correct in every particular, but
the Senate and the country were well in
formed on those points before. What was
wanted, and what Mr. Carlisle fails to give
with clearness, was an analysis of the cir-
comstances which, in his mind, made it
necessary for the Government to sell
bonds in tiie first instance, and why, sec
ondly, the transactions were r.ot more
favorable to the Treasury Department.
â  , la referring to the failure oi Coii^resa to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 1806.
I give the treasury the relief that it was
i alleged to be in need of Mr. Carlisle prac
tically adniiis that there were serious ap
prehensions existing of the ability of the
j (iovernment to maintain its credit; but he
! is misleading when he intimates thai, it
was the people that was apprehensive. It
; was the administration and not the pub
;He that was "rattled." This is made
cear in tbe haste of the Secretary to
I close a secret deal with the Belmont
| Morgan-Rothschild .syndicate to take the
j entire issue, $02,000,000, at the absurdly
j low price oi when the same char-
I acter of United States bond was selling in
the investment markets of this country and
â  Europe at $119. Admitting that the trea
j sury was in distress, and that it was nee
i essary to procure gold by the sale of bonds,
; the fact still remains that the administra
t'on was unnecessarily alarmed, and that
had it been equal to the emergency the syn
j dicate could have taken no such advan
j tage. It is not charged by any one that
! Mr. Carlisle or any other officer of the
j Government tried to or did secure personal
I gain by the transaction.
The real meaning of Mr. Carlisle's dodg
' i::g the kind of an explanation that was
j asked for it is that the more he should try
j to justify the deal with the syndicate the
j more he would expose the incapacity of
the Cleveland administration. To give
i the true reason why bonds that were sell
i ing in the open market for $119 should be
! given to a syndicate for a fraction over
i $104 would have been to confess that the
Government had fallen into glaringly in
competent hands. No corner grocer would
show so little business sense, and now
that the administration itself realizes its
utter inability to cope with complex or
! threatening danger, it seeks to avoid ex
posure by subterfuge, as in Carlisle's re
piy to the Senate's inquiries concerning
the several bond issues.
THERE WILL BE NO BOLT.
The advance guard from several States
has reached St. Louis, and as is always the
case there are those who assume the role
uf the party's oracle. There is no man
now at St. Louis nor will there be at any
time before or durine the convention who
is authorized to set the bounds of the
party's going and coming. That is for the
convention to do, and when a man an
nounces that his State will bolt if his
advice is not taken, or when another talks
of a bolt if this is done and that is not
done, the country will understand that
they are not representative Republicans.
The delegates froln every State are in
structed to work for the accomplishment
of certain aims, but no delegation is
authorized to talk of bolting, much less to
bolt. For the most part, however, this
talk about bolting are tales got up by
Democrats to create discord in the local
organizations of the party, and Repub
licans are in no way responsible for
them. This the members of the party
everywhere should understand. There
will be plenty of bard work before
the meeting of the convention and
strong and logical arguments wiJl be made
in the convention by the California and by
every other delegation for or against pro
posed declarations of principles. It is by
this way that the needs, the sentiments
and the wishes of the several States are
made known to the party as a whole, and
wjjen all interests have been presented the
convention will adjust its platform so
that every community shall have all its
wants up to where more would be trespass
upon the rights of others.
To talk of bolting, then, is to talK as the
disloyal taik. But, as we have said, pretty
much all the talk of "bolting the party" is
manufactured by a Democratic junta now
In St. Louis for the express purpose of
sowing seeds of discord. It is a Demo
cratic trick that has grown gray in the
service of that party, and no Republican
should worry about a "bolt," for there will
be none. Meanwhile let the organization
of league clubs go right along with in
creasing enthusiasm, so that the only
"bolt" that the country will witness will
be the bolting of the Democratic party for
a hiding-place.
WHEN SHE SMILES
I.lke dew on the blushing June roses,
And as soft as the dawn of the day,

You can guess that a, hat or a dreai is

And as soft as the dawn of the day -
Is her look as my loved one proposes
That she simply will have her own way.

THE VALLEY ROAD
Santa Clara >ews.
This line, to which Californians look as their
hope of redemption from overcharges lor
freight and transportation, is completed from
Stockton to Merced, a distance of seventy
miles. More rapid progress would have been
made had it not been for trouble in securing
right-of-way. These details have been nearly
all settled, except one case in Madera County
and another in Fresno County, so more rapid
progress is looked for when the cases now on
from Merced County are settled. They are
being tried under condemnation proceedings,
which were opened in court yesterday, June 8.
Negotiations are in progress between the
Valley road and the California Navigation pud
Improvement Company with a view toward
making a traflic arrangement whereby the
Valley road would virtually have a through
line from San Francisco to Merced as soon as
the road between Stockton and Merced is regu
larly opened for business.
The steamship company named now handles
all the construction material of the competing
railroad and has boats lying idle which could
be made available immediately. There will
be ample facilities provided, not only for all
the freight business that maybe offered, but
passengers will also find special inducements
to use this route to Merced and Intermediate
points.
It is expected that when the railroad is com
pleted and operated to Bakersneld additional
boats will be required. These will have to be
built and they will be fast and commodious.
It is expected three boats a day each way
will be required as soon as the Valley and Cor
ral Hollow railroads are in operation. The lat
ter road has not maae a contract yet. but it
may conclude to handle i;s coal in its own
barges.
The Valley road has thousands of well wish
ers in this valley who want to see it completed
as quickly as possible to Mojave. When this is
done there will be a competing line to Eastern
cities, which will do more to break the mono
poly under which California has struggled for
years than all other causes combined.
JUST THE MAN FOR STEWART.
Washington Times.
Some one tells this story of Senator Stewart
of Nevada: The colored butler in the house of
a widely known Representative asked the
daughter of the house, a bright young lady,
what all the talk about silver was. She ex
plained to him as well as ehe could, but evi
dently not to the butler's satisfaction, for he
went away insisting that he was a silver man
and the silver question meant that any one
who wanted it could get sixteen silver dollars
for one gold dollar If the measure ever passed.
Now it happens that this young lady is very
well acquainted with Senator Stewart's daugh
ter, and that young lady happened to call the
day after the butler had sought in vain for in
formation. During the course of the conver
sation the young hostess told her guest oi the
butler's inquiring turn of mind. At this Miss
Stewart broke in impulsively with: "Oh, why
didn't you send him over to see papa? He
wants some one to talk silver with so much."
A GEORGIA PLATFORM.
A Georgia man is going to run for any office
he can get on the i following: platform: "I
never was in the war; never hollered at the
surrender, and never killed anybody that let
me alone, and tno only thing I know about the
.financial question is t&is; Xaeedmoaey, .;..
THE ST. LOUIS PLATFORM.
Views of Leading Republican-
Journals as to the Financial
Plank to Be Adopted.
Faint-Hearted Men to the Hear.
Omaha Bee.
it is simultaneously announced from Wash
ington and St. Louis that the platform upon
which William McKlnley expects to present
himself for the suffrage of the people will be
a compromise, or, in other words, a straddle on
the money question. We do not believe that
any man or set of men has any right to com
mit either William McKlnley or the Republi
can party in advance of the National Conven
tion to a straddle or juggle on the silver ques
tion. Mr. McKinley spoke for himself when
he declared at the Marquette Club banquet at
Chicago that he would stand squarely on the
platform that should be framed at St. Louis.
His own views on the question were clearly ex
pressed by him four year* ago in his speech
made at Lincoln in this State, when, in reply
to the question, Â«'What about silver?" he in
terrupted his speech to respond:
I'll tell, you, my friend, what I think about
silver, and its what the Republican party thinks
about U. I believe, and the Republican party
thinks, that every dollar, bo it gold, silver or
paper, should be the equal of the other. The
farmer and the laborer more than anybody els'
want mi honest dollar. When the farmer sells a
bushel of wheat he must use a full bushel, and
when he gets his pay he demands a lull dollar
worth 100 cents.
The fanner who wanted a full dollar worth
100 cents in IS'J'J wants the same kind of a
dollar in lS9t>. He will not be satished with
any two-faced expression on this subject.
Neither will the farmer who clamors for 16 to
1 free coinage regardless of the action of other
nations. It is arrant nonsense to expect to
draw votes from the free coinage ranks by
promises of international agreement, either at
the old ratio or at some new ratio.
The free silverite whatever his politics may
have been will atand out for 10 to 1 regardless
of other nations or nothing. On the other
hand, all voters who believe in honesty and
full value money demand an explicit, une
quivocal declaration against free and unlim
ited silver coinage and the menace of a silver
standard. While not a single vote can be
gained by a straddle, hundreds of thousands
of votes will be assured for McKinley and the
Republican ticket by a fearless and uncompro
mising stand for sound money.
It must be borne in mind that a very large
percentage of the independent vote, the vote
that has turned the balance in debatable
States in previous elections, will be gained or
lost ou the money plank. This is especially
true of the German, Scandinavian and Slavic
popuiatiou.who are almost to a man ior sound
money and against free silvercoinage. â¢ â¢ *
Mr. cirosvenor asks: Where will these votes
go to since it is foreordained that both Demo
crats and Populists will indorse the silver de
lusion? Suppose tney take to the woods.
That would mean a loss of hundreds of thou
sands of votes in States where every vote is
needed. This, however, is a cowardly view.
The Republican party boasts that it has never
faltered before a great issue. Why should it do
so in the year 1890 and protract the agony
born of uncertainty as to the future policy of
the American Government, â¢ * â¢
The assertion that the battle must be foueht
on the protective tariff alone is absurd.
General Pope, when he had his headquarters
in the saddle, once decided fo light a decisive
battle at Warrenton, Va., but Lee and Stone
wall Jackson turned his flant and forced him
to light at Mauassas. In the impending cam
paign McKinley will stand for protection and
the fighting will be forced on the lines of free
coinage whether the Republican generals
choose that battle-ground or not.
If the faint-hearted men who are trying to
dodge the main issue oi the impending cam
paign by subterluge and compromise would
retire to"the rear and let the lighting men oc
cupy the front ranks the battle of 1890 will
register the most signal victory the Republi
can party has ever won.
There Will Ue No Cowardice.
New York Tribune.
It is practically settled that the sound-money
men will have entire control in the Republi
can convention, and the silver men in the
Democratic convention. That certainly is by
some expected to have much to do with the
shaping of the Republican platform. They
reason that in such circumstances the Repub
licans will have nothing to fear in any Eastern
States, and will therefore be inclined to treat
as kindly as possible the opinions of Western
brethren, whose struggle lor protective princi
ples is embarrassed by the popular desire for
free silver coinage. In support of this view it
is urged that sound-money Democrats have al
ready begun to 6how that they will stick to
their party anl fight for it, even if it puts up a
silver man on a silver platform, and that the
Republicans will be obliged to meet such dis
honest ignoring of the question with some
measure of evasion or prudence.
These calculations leave out of sight a ques
tion ot principle and a practical contingency
which may prove extremely important. It is
not possible for the Republicans to pass in
silence the question of silver coinage, and no
obligation can be higher than to state with
honesty the principles by which they will be
governed. The entire history of the party has
been distinguished by manly candor in stating
its beliefs and unflinching fidelity in carrying
out its pledges. Kor forty years its opponents
have labored in vain to entangle the Republi
can party in a tricky statement or a disregard
of promises and the votes in States where
people are free to vote stand as proof that no
charge of that nature has ever had weight
with- public opinion. There will not be this
year a beginning of Republican bad faith or
cowardice-. The party has clearly denned and
.strong convictions on the money question, ana
caunot help stating them.
The Money Flank Must Be an Honest
One.
Chicago Tlmea-Herald.
The money plank adopted by the Republi
cans ot Maine reads :
We are opposed to the free and unlimited coin
age of silver, except by international agreement,
and uulil such agreement can be obtained we be
lieve that tbe present gold, standard should be
maintained.
That is a very good platform. It would be
more terse if it read: "We believe that the
present gold standard should be maintained,
and we are opposed to the free and unlimited
coinage of silver."
Every reference to an international agree
ment is shifty and futile. It deceives nobody,
because every one knows, first, that there is
not the slightest possibility of an international
agreement at any ratio, and, secondly, that if
such an agreement were formally entered into
no Government could be bound to abide by it
a day longer than its own industrial or com
mercial interests would appear to warrant.
The money plank at St. Louis should not be
incumbered with redundant words or irreve
vant allusions. Wnat the people want is an
honest, plain, unequivocal affirmation of the
single principle of the present gold standard
and an absolute negation of the free coinage of
silver at any ratio.
The Maine platform is good, but it would be
better without reduudancy and irrelevancy.
The St. Louis plank must be the best that can
be contrived for the understanding of the plain
ueople. It must be plain, like them. It must
be without subtlety, as they are. It must be
straightforward, asthe people are. It mu.-t be
honest; the people are honest.
No redundancy at bt. Louis 1 No ambiguity 1
No subtlety!
Mr. McKlnley's Attitude.
Washington Post.
As we have heretofore had occasion to re
mark Mr. McKinley's refusal to be "drawn"
on the financial question has our unqualified
approval. He is under no sort of obligation to
express himself at the demand of enemies who
hope to extract from the utterance something
that may be used to his injury ana discredit.
His friendsâ and they seem to constitute about
three-fourths of the Republican partyâ are en
tirely satisfied. They have asked no questions
and seem more than willing to take Mr. Mc-
Kinley as he stands. For him to enter upon
an unprofitable controversy under these cir
cumstances would be mere folly.
The best answer to all this affectation of
solicitude is to remind the inquisitors that the
St. Louis platform will declare the. party 's
position as regards the matter of finance, and
that Mclvinley can be saiely trusted, as an
honorable man, to keep faith with the spirit
and the letter of that declaration. If the Re
publican party as a whole is sincerely wedded
to the gold standard, the delegates, gorng
fresh from the people, will make that senti
ment known, ana Mr. McKinley, theit- chosen
representative and standard-bearer, cannot do
less than observe a loyal and sincere com
pliance with their wishes. We shall see what
the St. Louis platform says. We shall see
whether it is so emphatic and so explicit for
the single gold standard as certain gentlemen
now prophesy. But we fully believe that the
National platform will differ little, if any,
from the State platform adopted in Ohio some
weeks ago by a convention controlled by Mc-
Kinley'a friends in his interests. It is fair to
assume that the financial plank in that
structure had Mr. McKinley's entire approval,
if, indeed, it were not the work of his own
handsâ and here it is: "
â¢We contend for honest moneyâ for a currency of
sold, silver and paper with which to measure our
exchanges, that shall be as sound as the Govern
ment and as untarnished as Its honor, and to that
end we favor bimetallism and demand the use of
both gold and silver as standard money, either in
accordance with a ratio to be fixed by an Inter
national agreement- Â»if that can be obtained) or
under such restrictions and such provisions to -be
determined by legislation as will secure the main
tenance of the parities of values el (be (wo metals,
so that the purchasing and debt-paying power ot
the dollar, whether silver, gold or paper, shall be
at all limes equal.
This is quite as definite and stalwart as the
average Republican platform â quite as much
so, we fancy, as any ihe St. Louis convention is
likeiy to put forth." It, no doubt, expresses Mr.
McKinley's personal attitude and purpose, and
may safely be accepted in that character. We
see State after State instructing for him in the
light of this utterance, and its almost unmis
takable meaning. AVhy, then, need Mr. Mc-
Kinley trouble himself'to elaborate a proposi
tion already clear enough?

A CHILD'S PRETTY APRON.
Here is an apron which combines pictur
esqueness with utility, ft is developed charm
ingly in any of the dainty white stuffs, such
as nainsook, dimity, lawn and cambric. An
inexpensive decoration consists of a very nar
row Valenciennes insertion let in at the top of
the hem on sleeves and revers. Another trim
ming which is dainty and not costly is a
narrow frill of Valenciennes lace of the Italian
mesh, set on tbe edges. Narrow edges of em
broidery set on flat recommend themselves on
the score of easy laundering.
Aprons of pretty light colors are a possi
bility, for the colored nainsooks wash admir
ably. It may be had in many colors, pink,
couleur de rose, blue and pale green.
Gingham in checks and stripes makes very
serviceable aprons, and need not of necessity
be In colors which do not please a child's eye.
Stripes of pink and white on blue and white
wash quite as well as the dull grays and
browns. A pretty contrast Is obtained by
using a plain color for the revers. Or mace
the apron of plain pink, with sleeves and
revers of striped pink and white.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS
One of the great successes of the present
musical season in London has been made by
the Columbians, a quartet consisting of four
American girls, who sing plantation songs to
the accompaniment of a banjo and guitar
which two of them play. London is so over
run with accomplished musicians from all
parts of the civilized world that the furor
created by these girls with their simple songs
is all the more remarkable. Their names are
Miss Rita Lorton, Miss Belle BrewstÂ«r, Miss
Winnifred Nightingale and Miss Nona Wil
liams, and all come of good American families.
Less than two years ago they went to Europe
to study music, and after the work of the day
used to amuse themselves during the winter
evenings by playing the banjo and guitar and
singing plantation and college songs. "In
this," says the Musical Courier, "they were al
ways encouraged, because all, both musicians
and others, were simply carried away by the
beauty of their ensemble singing and
also by the unusual harmoniesâ the spon
taneous outcome of their own musical intu
itions. As they made friends in the great me
tropolis their singing began to be heralded, 1
and suddenly to their utter amusement, they
found themselves the center of much admira
tion." The Columbians have toured with
Patti in England and are greatly in demand
both for drawing-room performances in society
and for concerts.
Vogl, the celebrated tenor of the Munich
opera, who is counted among the oldest and
most solid pillars ot Wagnerian art, has just
undergone a great misfortune, not as an artist,
but as an agriculturist. In the environs of
Munich, near the Lake of Starnberg, Vogl pos
sesses a large estate, where he devotes a large
portion of his time superintending every kind
of culture, even pisciculture. A large pond
has been constructed for the fish, and recently
the chief embankment of this artificial lake
was washed away by the rains, and the water
swept away to the lake, carrying away Vogl's
fish and causing enormous damage along its
track. It is stated that the loss to neighboring
estates amounts to 100,000 francs, and it has
been decreed that the unfortunate singer must
reimburse this sum. Vogl would have done
better to stick to his singing, for the exploita
tion of his larynx would never have cost him
60 dear as this.
The Municipal Council of the city oi Ham
burg has proposed to the citizens to grant a
subvention of 20,000 marks in order that the
city may, for a year, maintain a first-class or
chestra. The citizens agreed, on condition
that there should be at least five concerts de
voted exclusively to classical music, at which
the price of admission was to be fixed at a sum
equivalent to 12 cents. Nothing could have
been more just, for as the mass of the people
will contribute to the support of these con
certs it is only right that they should profit by
them; that is true democracy, and now there
is scarcely a person in Hamburg so poor that
he cannot hear the symphonies of Beethoven
interpreted by an orchestra oi the highest or
der.
"The King of Lahore," in a frock coat and a
white tie! To any one -JTho knows the opera
the idea is amusing, but at Kief tbe other day
the work had been announced, and when the
audience had assembled it was found that the
costumer had played the theater false and
}here were consequently none of the custom
ary gorgeous costumes for his majesty or the
rest of the troupe to don. After a hasty con
sultation it was resolved to give the work as an
oratorio, and the papers state that the effect
produced by the music was not less attractive
than it is when "The King of Lahore" is acted
and costumed.
The Parisian public has accorded the warm
est reception to Clarence Eddy, the American
organist, who has been giving some concerts
at the Trocadero. A large number of French
organists, among them Theodore Dubois, the
new director of the Paris Conservatory, were
present at the opening concert and led the
applause. The papers state that Eddy, with
out doubt, can be clashed among the greatest
organists of the day, and this is a great con
fession for the Parisian press to make regard
ing a foreigner.
An admirer of Richard Wagner has offered
to the Municipal Council of Berlin the sum of
5000 marks as the first subscription toward a
monument in honor of the Bayreuth master.
It remains to be seen if the council will fur
nish the rest or invite the citizens to subscribe.
In awaiting the response of the council the
shades of Richard Wagner can only boast of a
commemorative plaque, placed on the house
at Leipsic which replaces the house where he
was born. That is certainly very little.
The tenor Van Dyck has quarreled with
Mme. Cosima Wagner, and unless an unex
pected reconciliation takes place he will sing
no more at Bayreuth. Next year he will begin
his ninth season at the Imperial Opera-house
of Vienna. At the expiration of his tenth
year of service, if he is not re-engaged, he will
be entitled to a pension of (5000 florins ($3000),
paid from the private purse of the Emperor.
A German composer, Auguste Bungert, has
just finished a lyric triology entitled
"Ulysses," the subject of which closely follows
the Odyssey. The first of the three works is
entitled "Penelope," and this will receive its
initial performance next October at the Royal
Opera-house of Dresden. The celebrated bary
tone Scheidemantel has been intrusted with
the role of Ulysses.
Music is to play an important part in the
Geneva exposition, one of the most noteworthy
attractions being a series of symphony con
serts, under the direction of a young and dis
tinguished artist, Gustav Doret. A very
eclectic series of programmes has been ar
ranged, including symphonies by the classical
as well as by the modern masters.
The Royal Opera of Berlin is preparing to
mount an unpublished opera by the English
composer, Henry Waller, entitled "Fra Fran
cesco." It is said that the Emperor William
ha 3 ordered that the first performance shall be
a private one for himself alone. This looks
like following in the footsteps of the late la
mented King Louis of Bavaria.
A new liturgical mass, with organ and
string quartet accompianment by the young
composer, Giuseppe Massa, has been performed
with great success at the church of San Carlo,
Modena. Indeed, the work produced a pro
found impression on the hearers. The
"Kyrie" and the "Agnus Dei" are cited as be
ing especially remarkable.
A great musical combine is announced from
Italy. Ricordi and Sonzogno, the two great
music publishers and impresarios, wno have
been rivals for so long, have pooled their in
terests. Both houseÃ possess great power in
the musical world, and combined they will
practically own the Italian opera-houses.
Anton Dvorak has not been idle since his re
turn to Europe. It is announced that he has
just finished not only two new quartets for
strings, but also three grand symphonic
poems, of which the titles are : "The Sorcerer
of the South," "The Man of the Waters" and
"The Golden Wheel."

A Large Display Will Be Made at the

One of the finest exhibits of game and

exhibited at the coming Home Products
Exposiiion, which is to be held in the fall
at the Mechanics' Pavilion. L. R. Mead
and 5. H. Tacy of the Manufacturers' and

conversation with Deputy Fish Com
missioner BabcocK upon the subject of
making a fine piscatorial display, and Mr.
Babcock at once called the matter to the
attention ot Commissioner Emeric. Yes
terday Mr. Tacy received the following
from Mr. Emeric:
In confirmation o! the conversation had by
you and L. R. Mead this day with Mr. Babcock
in regard to an aquarium exhibit of fresh
water fish at the Home Products Exposition,
permit me to say that the Fish Commissioners
will collect, arrange and maintain in the
nquana belonging to the Mechanics'JlnÃtitute
a display of all the fresh- water food fish of the
State, and erect aud operate a small fish hatch
ery. â¢ * * In tne proposed exhibit the
tx/ard will undertake to show all of the trout,
both native and acclimatized, Including the
Dolly Vardeu and the famous and beautiful
â¢i trout of Mount Whitney, a trout un
known to any other region of the world Also
salmon, big and little mouthed black bass,
peckerel, yel!ow perch, green sunfish, etc.
An aquarium collection such as we have out
lined, with its hatchery adjunct, should make
an attractive nucleus, around wnich coulo be
grouped an interesting and instructive ex
hibit pertaining to our commercitil fisheries.
The productions of the California fisheries are
valued at upward of $3,000,000 per year, and
it is certainly essential that this industry be
appropriately represented.
Mr. Tacy says that the Mechanics' In
stitute people are well pleased with the
proposition, and it is likely that the
Bquaria will be increased in number and
capacity. In connection therewith there
will be "fish canning and packing and a
number of men engaged in making fish
ing tackle for commercial and sporting
purposes.

iatic turn of mind, created quite a riot on
Kearny street yesterday afternoon. The
riot grew out of a conflict between a pas
senger and the gripman and conductor of
the car upon which the former was riding.
A large and angry crowd, angry at the in
dignities the passenger was forced to suf
fer before their eyes, followed the car and
added greatly to the excitement.
Henry Behnke, a man short of stature
but of solid mold, who resides st 601 Do
lores street, rode down Market street
shortly after 2 o'clock on a Castro-street
car. He took a transfer from the conductor
entitling him to a ride south on Third
street. Instead of going south, however,
he took car 1173, bound *north along
Kearny street.
"When the conductor approached he pro
duced his transfer, but was told by the
pugilistic faretaker that it was worthless
on lhat particular line. A second fare
was demanded, but Behnfce refused to pay i
it. Therefore Conductor Robert Henry ]
ordered the car stopped, and attempted to i
eject the non-acquiescing passenger.
iiehnte grasped the iron stanchion, but
was throttled by the conductor while the
motorman beat his hands and forced him
to let go his hold. A number of vicious i
blows were administered by the conductor '
upon tne man's face and body and he was
thrown prostrate on the pavement, and all
of this transpired before the policeman,
who made a tardy appearance, arrived on j
the scene of trouble. "If he had any defi
nite idea of his duty and any willingness
whatever to perform it the conducor and
motorrnan would have been promptly
marched to the station-house and placed
behind the bars.
If the passenger assaulted had resented
the treatment and blows that he received
and killed one of them a hundred people
could have truthfully testified that he was
acting in self-defense and that the killing
was justifiable.
After throwing Behnke to the pavement
the conductor and gripman released their
hold and again started on their journey.
Behnke arose quickly and boarded the
rear end of the car as it passed him.
It was again stopped, and he was again
dragged off by the two employes of the
railway company. He was quickly assisted
to his feet by ihe crowd, which by this
time had gathered to the number of 700 or
800, and again took his place on the rear
side step. The car could not start, as
some one had pulled the trolley-wheel off j
the wire. In the meantime Officer Ingils !
put in an appearance, and, after a short j
conversation with the employes, caught i
the man by the arm and attempted to pull
him from the carstep. Behnke held with
all his strength to the stanchion.
The conductor then came to the police- !
man's assistance and forced Behuke's
hands loose. The trolley was not in place
and before the car could be started the
man again got on amid the cheers of the
crowd, who spared no breath to denounc
ing the policeman. A dozen men, mer
chants and others from the vicinity,
entered a vigorous protest against the
policeman's action, with the result that he
stood entirely inactive. It was then that '
the final and most outrageous part of the !
scene was enacted. The passenger stood i
on the steps clasping the stanchion with
both hands.
The two-hundredth motorman went to
work on liis hands, while the conductor
climoed on his back and grabbing him
around the throat with both hands, throt
tled and tiirew him" again flat on his back
on the asphalt, and right at the feet of the
silent and motionless representative of tfie
law. Having him down, the conductor
proceeded at once to vent his anger in the
way of vicious blows in the face and over
the body of the prostrate and exhausted
man. A strong arm, however, soon seized
him and compelled him to desist. It was
not the policeman's, however, but that of
a bystander, whose sense of justice and
humanity was too strong to permit further
cruelty.
He pulled the conductor off and held on
to him as he attempted to climb back on

the car, and called to the policeman to ar
rest the conductor and motorman.
This for a short time the officer refused
to do, but finally, noting the angry dem
onstrations of the crowd, concluded that it
was the only thing to do, and the ruffianly
conductor was led away to jail. After
some further delay the trolley wire was
readjusted, and the car, in charge of the
motorman, passed on.
The unfortunate victim of Vining's vil
lains, who still lay gasping from his in
juries in the street, was assisted to his feet
and led away by the gentleman .who had
interposed to save him from the con
ductor's brutality.
Mr. Lacey, an attorney, and Dr.
Lord went with him to the California
street police station to enter a charge
against the conductor, but that had
already been done.
Mr. Charles McCarthy, a plumber, who
resides near Broadway and Jones stree t,
assisted in placing the conductor under
arrest and preferred a charge of assault
and battery aeainst him.
Officer In^els stated, when asked why he
did not arrest the conductor when called
upon, that he did not see the man do any
thing but pull the man off the car; that
he saw no blows struck.
Other persons who witnessed the whole
affair insist, however, that Henry beat the
man with his fists after he had pulled him
from the car and as he lay in the street.
Many also insist that the motorman struck
him with his iron crank.
Mrs. Julia Key of 2220 Webster street
was on the car immediately behind, and
saw the best part of the trouble. She says
that the motorman struck Mr. Behnke with
his crank, and that the conductor beat him
as he lay on the ground. Officer Ingels
also states that it was as much as he could
do to keep the crowd from tramping on
the assaulted man as he lay in the street.
After somewhat recovering* from the
effects of the abuse to which he had been
subjected Behnke swore out a warrant for
the arrest of the motorman, Patrick Ma
honey. Mahoney was arrested late last
evening and detained at the Seventeenth-
street Police station on a charge of bat
tery. Subsequently both the conductor
and his ally, the motorman, were released
on giving bail for their appearance in the
sum of $500 in each case.
BOYS UNAWED BY LAW
They Continue to Traffic in
Transfers on the Public
Streets.
No Attempt Made to Interfere With
the Persistent Tormentors
of Vining.
Neither short-limit transfers nor the im
plied terrors of the new Dimond ordinance
has served to suppress the apparently in
corrigible newsboy.
The new law was in full force yesterday.
It makes it a misdemeanor to sell, give
away or in any way traffic in transfers
outsid 3of street-cars. It was read to the
police force before they went on duty, but
in view of the fact that transfers were
passed out to purchasers of newspapers as
freely as before, and in some cases right
under the nose and eyes of a policeman,
the guardians of the peace had apparently
forgotten all about its existence and the
act which it made a misdemeanor.
Early in the day the juvenile tormentors
of Mr. Vining were exceedingly cautious
in asking for and giving the transfers,
but toward evening they plied the pro
scribed traffic pretty much as of yore.
Inquiry among them elicited the infor
mation that their revenues had not suf
fered, and that'no attempt had been made
to interfere with them either by police
officers or by employes of the Market-street
Company. j
It was also learned that instead of ad
hering to the five-minute limit, transfers
were punched so as to give passengers be
tween ten and fifteen minutes to make
their connections.

HOISTING HER UP
INCH BY INCH.
Successful Attempt to Raise
the Blairmore Made
at Daybreak.
IT ALL WORKED WELL.
When Six Feet Had Been Gained
Operations Ceased for
the Day.
PORT BULWARKS OUT OF WATER
Another Attempt to Get the Hull Into
Shallow Water Will Be
Made To-Day.
After months of patient toil the efforts
to raise the sunken British ship Blairmore
are being crowned with success. Yesterday
morning she was six feet nearer the perpen-
dicular than the night before, and this
morning, if the hopes of the men at work
on her are realized, she will be in shallow
â¢water and on an even keel. The decks
will then be above water and the hatches
will be removed.
Then will begin the gruesome task of
searching tor the dead bodies that were
entombed in the hold of ihe ship. Coffins
will be in readiness and the remains will
be at once sent to the Morgue.
At 3:30 a. m. yesterday everybody on
the wrecker Whitelaw and schooner Cata
lina were hard at work. On the wrecker
the compressed air machine was got ready
and on the schooner steam was got up in
the donkey boiler. The tanks resting on I
the superstructure erected over the hull of
the sunken ship were examined, and then
Captain Burns, who represents Lloyds, j
and Captain Whitelaw of the wrecker
made a personal inspection of everything
to make sure that no hitch would occur.
Precisely at 5 a. m. the work of filling the
tanks began. It was quite a while, how
ever, before the weight of water had any
perceptible effect upon the sunken hull,
and both the captains began to get nerv
ous. Failure meant much to them, as
all their carefully laid plans would have
been for naught and a new start would
have had to be made.
'Tnc first move of the ship was almost
imperceptible, but nevertheless it w;ts
there. At 5:30 A. M. Captain Burns ex
claimed exultantly: "She is coming!"
and sure enough she was. Slowly, inch
by mcii, the tanks of water overcame the
suction of the mud and ooze and by 6 a. m.
the port bulwarks of the ship, including
the port lighthouse and the port anchor
were above water. It was not the inten
tion to get the vessel on an even keel yes
terday, so work was stopped and several
of the tanks were emptied. The others
that are full will prevent the hull from
sinking back into its original position.
Early this morning everything will be in
readiness for the final effort and Captains
Burns and Whitelaw are confident of suc
cess.
Inshore near the Union Iron Works
very heavy moorings have been laid, and
from these to the Whitelaw a long steel
cable has been laid. One end of the cable
will be fixed to the Blairmore and the |
other .will pas through the Whitelaw |
hawsepipe and thence to the winch. A j
tug will stand by in readiness, and when j
the signal is given she will pull on the j
sunken ship. The tanks will then be rilled I
and Then the Blairmore has raised on to
her bilge she will be rushed into shallow
water. Then she will be p"ut on an even
keel without any trouble.
In talking about the matter yesterday
morning, Captain Burns said: "Our ex
periment has turned out to be a success,
and I think we will now have no trouble
in raising the Blairmore. The hull is air
tight, and when the compressed air is
pumped into her I think she will come
up. Had it not been for the fire-hose used
around the hull by the divers, I don't
think we would ever have got the vessel
up. The force of water sent down throueh
the hose had cleared away over 250 tons of
mud and Blush and thus in a great meas
ure released the hull. Everything is now
in perfect working order, and our next
attempt will tell the tale."
The Roof Will Be Artificial Stone.
The City Hall Commissioners, after hearing
M. C. Hinkiu and Martin Hughes of the Metal
Roofers' Association, who contended that the
permanent roof of the hall should be oon-
Btructed of metal, and Jacob Stahle, who was
as sure that a slate roof was the only one tiiat
would give satisfaction, decided yesterday to
leave the matter in the hands of Architect
Shea, who is known to favor an artificial stone
covering. Mr. Shea is now preparing plans
and specifications for an artificial stone roof.
VETERAN FIREMEN MEET.
They Hold a Memorable Sension In
Their Headquarters.
A meeting of the Veteran Volunteer
Firemen's Association was held at its hall
last evening. Several new members were
j elected. A handsomely framed portrait of
the queen of the late Healdsburg fiesta,
Miss Alice Haigh, was received as a pres
ent from herself by the firemen with great
applause, and the queen was unanimously
elected an honorary member of the asso
ciation.
0. H. Keys, one of the members, pre
sented the association with a handsomely
engraved solid silver trumpet. Secretary
Scollay read a budget of invitations from
the surrounding towns to parade with
them on July 4, but on being put to a vote
it was decided to roll the old engine with
the San Francisco parade.
C. SCHEURER SUICIDES.
The Popular Tailor Take* His Life
Vi hile Despondent.
Christian Scheurer, a tailor, committed
suicide yesterday morning shortly after 11
o'clock by shooting himself in the head
with a 38-caliber revolver. The shooting
was done in a room in the rear of his store,
at 147 Fourth street.
Mr. Bcheurer was a Mason and a mem
ber of several German societies and be
longed to the Veterans of the National
Guard.
No cause whatever is assigned for the
act except that he was accustomed to
periodical spells of despondency. He pos
sessed a host of friends, all of whom pro
nounced him to be a congenial compan
ion, a good father and a faithful friend.
He had been a resident of this City for
twenty-five or thirty years and he leaves a
daughter and a son.

HACKMEN GAIN
PARTIAL VICTORY
They Want, However, All
They Demand or
Nothing.
THE STRIKE IS STILL ON
They Believe That Things Will
Be Settled Before This
Afternoon.
HAVE A STRONG COMBINATION
Three Undertaking Firms and the En
tire Riding Public Ride With
Them.
The hackmen's strike is still on. The
Pacific Carriage Company has already
made certain concessions, but not enough
to satisfy the men, who have insisted on
their old schedule of wages. Since Monday
evening at 5 o'clock when O. S. Carvill an
nounced that the wages of the men had
been reduced from $1 50 to $1 25 per day,
the strike has been in full swing, but it
has been a courteous swing withal â a
strike that is remarkable for the passive
resolution on the part of the men and a
determination not to give in until they
accomplished what they believed they
deserved.
Tuesday night H. P. Suhr, representing
the three undertaking establishments, in
terviewed the proprietors of the Pacific
Carriage Company. The exact words that
were passed in that interview are not
known, but within a few minutes after Mr.
Suhr left the company's office the men
were informed by Mr. Carvill that the
original rate of wages would be paid.
That is $1 50 per day. When this was' an
nounced the boys sent up three cheers for
the undertakers and the riding public in
general. They believed at this time that
they had scored a complete victory.
Yesterday the fact leaked out that while
the Pacific Carriage Company manage
ment had agreed to maintain the old wage
rate they did so with the intention of not
employing the three men who had taken
an active lead in the strike. These men
are William Shrewsbury, Charles E.
Edsbere and George H. Allen.
In the meantime several of the men,
believing the strike off, had gone bank to
the company and agreed to drive hacks
during the day and last night. When the
news, however, reached the ears of the
men regarding the condition of debarring
the three leaders, the strike was imme
diately declared on again and all that had
originally struck determined to stand with
the three men and not go back until they
were reinstalled in their former positions.
Yesterday afternoon the three undertak
ing firmsâ H. F. Suhr & Co., H. C. Porter
<fe Co. and McGinn Bros. â were interviewed
by the strikers, and all signified their in
tention of remaining solid with them.
This is the present situation: The Pa
cific Carriage Comi>any on one siie, the
twenty strikers on the other backed by a
strong petition signed by forty-one names
of prominent citizens heretofore patrons
of the company, and backed also by the
undertaking establishments. The bone of
contention is no longer the reduction of
wages, but the debarment of three men.
The petition reads as follows:
2V> the Pacific Carriage Company: We, the
undersigned, patrons ot the Pacific Carriage
> uinpaiir, do hereby agree to refrain from
patronizing saiil company's coupes and car
riages, also from ringing-iu the i?an Francisco
District Telegraph Company's boxes for the
said company's coupes and carriages, provided
the contemplated reduction In wages takes
place. Knowing it is impossible to secure re
liable drivers for less wages, having had deal
ings with said company for a number ot years
and always received courteous and satisfactory
treatment from said company's drivers we pre
sent this petition to show our appreciation for
said services. Hoping this petition may be
deemed satisfactory, we remain, yours respect
fully.
Hereto are appended forty-one names.
Mr. Carvill said yesterday: "Owing to
the dullness of the times we were forced
to either cut down the wages of the men
or to discharge a few and send out a
smaller number of carriages. Rather than
have some of the men idle we chose the
former plan of cutting down all the men
25 cents per day. The earnings of each
hack now are not sufficient to keep the
hacKS in repair and feed the horses, to say
nothing of paying the men. There *are
four men whom we will not reinstate on
any condition whatever; we have had
enough of them. We wanted to favor the
men and would have after the times picked
up a little gone back to the original sched
ule of wages. This is no striKe. We have
simply discharged a lew men."
Charles E. Edsberg, as spokesman for the
men, said: "Had the firm come to the
men and offered them a square deal, say
ing that business was dull and that "it
would be necessary for the men to take
one day off a weet, or to reduce the num
ber of coupes, there would have been no
strike whatever, and the men would have
gone along with their business, but we
fee! that we have been treated shabbily in
the matter, because two years ago there
was a reduction made of 15 cents a day
on the men's wages, and this has never
been raised, although we wera promised
it would be."
Three men have gone back to the com
pany, but the remainder stand steadfast
with those who have been tabooed by the
company. The hackmen are confident
that they will be given a complete victory
before this afternoon; in fact, they cannot
see how their combination can be beaten.
Xiantlc Parlor Election.
Niantic Parlor Xo. 105, N. S. G. W., elected

HIGH JINKS AT
THE HIGH SCHOOL
Some Youthful " New "
Women Make Clever
Orations.
BOYS SEVERELY SCORED.
The Girls Give Many Reasons
Against Their Admis
sion.
REEL DANCED BY THE FACULTY
Novel Entertainment Which Brought
Considerable Talent to the
Front.
The graduating class of '96 held high
revel in the Girls' High School yesterday
afternoon. The Board of Education had
forbidden elaborate graduating exercises,
but the girls, metaphorically speaking,
snapped their fingers at the board and
showed unmistakably that it would take
more than a few mere men to put a veto
on their enjoyment.
The entertainment had been named a
high jinks, and if frolic and noise and
originality constitute a jinks the girls
held one yesterday.
The faculty had been bidden to be pres
ent, bat for once the girls were the pre
ceptors and the teachers waited inquir
ingly to learn what was to happen next.
The graduating class of '9ti consists of
between eighty and ninety girl 3, but there
were 150 present, for every one who had
ever attended the class durinjr its three
years' course had been invited, and even
the girls who had moved away into the
interior towns responded to the call.
By 1 o'clock every one was in the build
incc, the doors were locked and the jinks
were given over to the care of four little
mothers, who ably fulfilled the duties
usually discharged" by sires. They were
Janette Newman. Lillian Nathan, Edith
Carpenter and Estella Shirek. By com
mand of these young ladies every one
ussemblei in t ; e chemistry-room, where,
ranged tier upon tier, the* girls prepared
themselves to make all the noise that 150
pairs of strong youn : hands and lungs
aided by whistles and rattles could niase.
The tyrant man had been carefully ex
cluded, the only exception to this rule be
ing in favor of Principal Elisha Brooks,
who had to sit by and hear his sex alluded
to with a flippancy, not to say derision,
which would have been palling if, as the
professor afterward gracefully expressed j
it. he had "been a boy."
The exercises opened with a grand de- !
bate. "Shall Boys Be Admitted to the
Hign School?' and before it was over the
ears of every boy in town must have been
tingling. Mamie Voorsanger and the
members of the faculty present acted as!
arbitrators, and the noise with which this
announcement was greeted would have
put a university football match to shame.
Adrienne Cerf opened the debate, when '
quiet had been restored, by pointing out the !
idvantages which would follow the admis- I
lof uoys. "They think they rule the |
l, but they would soon be taught that {
o not. They could poiish the black
and clean up the tubes in the
try class, and how much better it
be if the girls had something on j
i lavish their superfluous reflne
>lary Mooney took issue with the
:ig orator on all the above points, j
nted out that girls who clamor for
iiasium should turn their muscle to
nt by cleaning their own tubes and
boards. For her part she would scorn j
a boy's help. Besides any one who j
acquainted with the nature of boys \
t be aware that they never I
t anvthinc clean, not excepting |
,'ir own faces. It was not until
c end of her oration that this young lady
aye a peep behind her mask of a "new"
*oman by saying: "Don't let them in, for
the more they see of us the less they will
think of us. Distance always lends en
chantment."
Miss Katherine Gorham made a clever
speeci), pleading that it was the girls'
duty to admit the boys out of a sen.se of
pity. Miss Amy Cookson scorned the idea
of boys being admitted on any grounds !
and said that as for letting tnem in to
scrub blackboards, she believed that God
helped those who help themselves. Miss
Letitia Rountree pleaded for the boys.
"We should feel basbfulness at the
thought that there is a man in our midst,
but lihink that crisis would soon pass.
My opponent said that God helps tnose
who l:elp themselves, but she forgot to
quote 'Bear ye one another's burdens.'
The boys would learn t;iat it is not well
for man to be alone, and this would help
them in after life."
Myrtle Hodson shuddered at the idea of
sharing the school with rough, half-grown
boys, and she prayed that in her day at
least it might never happen. Mamie
Voorsanger said: "What a great disad
vantage, what an awful calamity, the ad
mission of boys would be. We have three
male preceptors already. Could boys do
more tl an they have done? We do not
leel the need of more boys." Miss Voor
saneer asked pathetically if boys should
be allowed to play in their garden and
trample down their flowers, and she con
cluded with: "Shall we, tlje rising Shaws
and Anthonys of San Francisco, allow
boys to trample on our rights?"
Miss Abenheim took a strone stand in
favor of the ruling sex. S?he said admis
sion to the high school would bring out
the boys' chivalry, and she ventured to
predict they would build the girls a gym
nasium. "As tor me 1 give my hand and
my heart to this cause. Girls, will you
join me?" The oratory had all been ac
companied by the most enthusiastic
demonstrations from the house, but the
young orators who spoke extempore and
with remarkable ease and fluency, h;td
not been at all embarrassed by the noise.
Ar. the conclusion of the debate a verdict
was clamored for, and Principal Brooks,
after expressing thankfulness that he was
not a boy, decided that any boy who
dared to enter the school should be
drowned in the fishpond. Mrs. Pray,
speaking for the lady teachers, pro
nounced the debate a tie.
After the oratorical duel the girls under
took a pilgrimage of the school in a pay
proces.-ion, sinking a parody on "March
ing Through Georgia. They visited the
various classrooms, in each of which one
of the following young ladies made a
brief address: Georgie Hawkins, Tilda
Richards, Chnstobel Sobey, EL. el Hants.
Irene Lowe and Helen Louter, who made
ihe address in the studio, wlicre the girls
pelted Professor Goldstein, who was dis
covered there, with flowers.
After the pilgrimage a halt was called
for refreshments, which consisted of ice
cream, cake, lenioimde and candy. The
frirls then declared that a Virginia* reel by
i he faculty was the next item on the pro
gramme, and they all assembled on the
platform of the big hall and applauded
while tbe following teachers good-natur
edly complied with their wishes:
Professor E. Brooks, Miss Nellie Owens, Mrs.
Mary Mayborn, Miss Mary l'rag. Miss Louise
Nmjut Howard, Miss Frances Hodgitiiison,
Miss Katharine Wilson and Miss Mary T.
Bragg.
The reel over, the girls took a solemn
pledge to meet again and have jinks next
year. "Auld Lang Syne" was sung, and
the afternoon ended in dancing.

graduating class:

PROFITS OF STREET WORK.
J. W. Smith Suing His Partners for an
Accounting.
A Buit for dissolution of partnership and
an accounting was yesterday brought
against George M. Perine and R. C. Mat
tingly by J. W. Smith. The firm was
formed April 25, 1895, for the purpose of
doing street-contracting work.
Ttiey secured a contract with the City
for work to be done on Mission street, for
which they have already received $50,000,
and have $18,000 worth of work yet on
hand. Smith says that the defendants
were each to furnish one-half the money
needed to fulfill their contract and that
they have overcharged the account no less
than $20,000 for the purpose of defrauding
him. As Mattingly keeps the books and
Periue manages the business, Smith wants
to know where he comes in.
'1 he Superintendent of Streets asses?ed
the Mission-street property-owners $69,
-236 71 for the work done under Perine,
Smith & Mattingly's contract, but Smith
says ttiat the actual cost ot it was less than
$45,000. As he claims to have received bui
$140 from the firm since its inception
Smith asKs that his partners be restrained
from making any further collections until
an accounting can be had.
THE PEOPLE`S BANK CASES
They Will Be Tried Before
Judge Seawell on
June 18.
Fred S. Stratton Suggests That All
the Stockholders of the Concern
Be Sued.
The suit of the California Safe Deposit
and Trust Company against the defunct
People's Home Savings Bank was called in
Judge Seawell's court yesterday, but was
laid over until the ISth.
John F. Sheehan, the manager, and sev
eral of the directors of the bank were
present and wanted the trial to go on.
General Sheehan. in particular, seemed
vexed at the delay, and said that he waÃ
very anxious for an early trial, because it
had been charged that the defense was de
laying matters. "The fact is," said he,
t "that in almost every instunce, including
: the present one, the continuance has been
l granted at the request of plaintiff's attor
i neys.
"It has been charged that the five cases
| against the stocknclders have been delayed
because we do not want the bank's money
collected. On the contrary, everything
has been done Dy us to bring matters to a
speedy termination."
Sbeehan produced a letter from Frei
8. Stratton, the bank's representative,
which stated that in addition to the five
suits against the original subscribers to
stock there are two classes of stockholders
whose defenses are not involved in those
suits. One class is those who by assien
! raent and purchase hare succeeded to
| ownership of certain shares of stock and
i the other is composed of those who, in
| anticipation of the calling in of the unpaid
i subscriptions and in anticipation of the in
solvency of the bank, made assignment to
irresponsible persons, from whom it would
be impossible to collect judgments.
Suils ought, therefore, to be brought
against all the stockholders of every class,
Mr. Stratton suggests. He also says that
test cases might with advantage be made,
provided the stipulation iB made that the
other defendants abide by the decisions in
the test cases^
A CROWDED CALENDAR
Justice Field on the Cases in
the United States Supreme
Court.
He Refuses to Discuss Politics or Na
tional Financesâ The Big Irri
gation Cases.
Justice Stephen J. Field of the United j '
States Supreme Court had many callers at
his rooms at the Palace yesterday. The
Justice and his family occupy suit 190 on
the first floor, New Montgomery-street <
side.
Among the callers were Judges Me- :
Renna and Morrow of the United States j
Circuit and District Courts. The veteran j
attorney, John Garber, also called and paid j i
his respects, as did many others.
In an interview the Justice said that the
only business that had called him to Cali
fornia was the improvement of his ailing
knee. He will stay here a few days, so he
said, and then go to Paso Robles. '
As to the decisions in the big irrigation !
cases which were some time since tried, !
Judge Field said he did not know when j '
they would be rendered. They had been j '
argued and submitted, and that was all | '
that could now be stated. '
He said that the calendar of the United '
Btates Supreme Court was very crowded,
and that while the law passed some years (
ago creating various United States courts | '
of appeals had given some relief, it was '
nevertheless a fact that the calendar was
still heavily loaded. 1
Judge .bield refused to discuss the finan- '
cial situation, money as a political factor, '
or politics in any way. He said that j 1
while he had not come to attend court, it 1
was possible, if necessary, that he would
appear on the bench here in an isolated i
case or two. ]
. The distinguished Judge does not look 1
ac all strong. â  *

Good Government.
NAMES OF THE OFFICERS.
It Will Be of Material Assistance to
the Party in the Coming
Campaign.
The members of tbe Thirty-ninth
Assembly Republican Club takes addi
tional pride in their organization fiom the
Principal Officers of the Thirty-Ninth Assembly Kepublican Club.
[Drawn from photographs.]
fart that it is the banner Republican dis
trict of the City.
While other Assembly Districts have to
battle for a victory the Thirty-ninth can
elect its Assemblymen with from 600 to 800
of a majority on every occasion. And
besides this handsome percentage to their
credit they also are credited with having
the most popular as also the most influen
tial business men in the City,
Situate in that fashionable district of
San Francisco bounded by Van Ness
avenue on the west, Jones on the East,
Sacramento on the north and Market on
the south, it may be inferred that the
claims of the members of this club are not
over-estimated in the strength and in
fluence as a Republican organization.
The fact that club members have kept
ud a continuous existence in and out of
political season tends to gain for it a
recognized standing from the party man
agers that is never disputed or Bet aside
when representation is asked for within
tbe bounds and limits of party lines.
The Republican County Committee has
had the good fortune of having constantly
had able and conscientious representatives
from this district. Such men as Maurice
L. Asher, Frank D. Worth and A. A.
Louderback need no credentials of re
spectability and good executive judgment
when called upon in consultation with I
their fellow Republican citizens to lay
down lines upon which the success of a
campaign depends. Such are the men
who have b.en entrusted from time to
time with the destinies of the district in
the County Committee for a number of
years.
The present County Committeeman of
this district, A. A. Louderback, has no su
perior in the City in political sagacity
and executive ability in party delibera
tions and general campaign work, and his j
judgment and counsel are at all times so- !
licited when the real issues are at stake.
The Thirty-ninth Assembly District Re
publican Club has kept up a continuous
existence during the past twelve years.
For the preceding two years John J. Sulli
van had been its president and prior to
that time Amos Currier ruled over its de
liberations.
Tne enrolling book shows a membership
of over 1000 energetic and loyal Republi
cans. With a well-filled treasury the club
is in splendid condition to enter the com
ing race for political honors. Its present
officers are all well-known, representative
men in the district. They were elected to
office at the annual election, which was |
held in the month of January. They are:
President, John Gilson; first vice-president,
Charles 11. Jackson; secretary, William J. Iler
rin; treasurer, Thomas Morion, and rinancial
secretary, Dave Reynold*.
Under the constitution of the club, each
precinct is entitled to one vice-president.
These vice-presidents constitute the exec
utive committee. In compliance with this
provision, the following vice-presidents
were elected and hold office:
Charles EL Jackson, Harvey Burdell, Ben
jamin Duncan, William T. Kibbler, David
Forester, John J. Sullivan, Gus Hartman, T. I
H. McCarthy, Maurice L. Asher, H. W. Mathews,
Ueorge B. Mackrett, Oscar Tolle, Benjamin H.
Patrick, Frank D.Worth, Sol Miller, H. W. Hut
ton and C. W. Brown.
The club meets on the first Tuesday of
every month, at Saratoga Hall, on Geary
street, between Hyde and Larkin. But as
soon as the campaign opens weekly meet
ings will be held and Republicanism will
not be asleep in the banner district of San
Francisco.
To Honor the Flag.
In view of the fact that next Sunday will be
the one hundred and nineteenth anniversary
of the adoption by Congress of the stars and
stripes as the National flag it was resolved at
the last meeting of the Sequoia Chapter of the
Daughters of tbe American Revolution to re
quest that in celebration of this important
event in the history of the country that tho
flag be raised on all public buildings of this
City on Saturday. Also that the residents of
this City be requested to display the National
colors.
A NAVAL DRILL.
MÂ«n From the Philadelphia Will Give
an Exhibition at Golden
Gate Park.
Tbe men from the United States cruiser
Philadelphia and two companies of the
Naval Battalion are to give an exhibition
drill in Golden Gate Park next Saturday
that will be worth going miles to see. It
will begin at 3p. M. and will last for over
an hour.
The men from the cruiser will land at
the Clay-street wharf and march to Mar
ket street. Six open cars will be waiting
for them, and by 2:10 p. m. they will be
under way. The band will be in the first
car and the procession is sure to create a
good deal of excitement along the line.
The battalion will be commanded by Lieu
tenant-Commander R. R. Ingersoll, Cap
tain Dickens, United States Marine Corps,
Lieutenants Winter-halter and Holcomb
and Ensigns Coontz and Hayward, while
tne Naval Reserve will be under command
of Lieutenant-Commander L. H. Turner.
The first exercises will consist of bat
talion drill in columns of company, sec
tions and company squares and marching
battalion front; second, street-riot drill
for the battalion ; third, evolutions in bat
talion squares; fourtn, battalion bayonet
exhibition; fifth, physical drill with arms
to music.
This last movement was inaugurated in
the Philadelphia by Lieutenant-Com
mander Ingersoll, and has only been seen
once or twice on the Pacific Coast and
never before in San Francisco. It is par
ticularly graceful and, as the men are
magnificently drilled, it is sure to be the
success of the day. All the men will be
dressed in white and there will be 240 all
told in the cruiser's battalion.

STATE DEVELOPMENT.
The General Committee Will Soon Send
Out Its Topographical Maps.
The executive committee of the State
Development Committee held its regular
monthly meeting yesterday, and Chair
man Bunker reviewed the progress during
the last month and outlined the projects
for the immediate future. He stated that
the committee had collected and compiled,
at considerable trouble and expense, lists
comprising 100,000 names of Eastern bank
ers, lawyers, real estate dealers, merch
ants, teachers, farmers and others to
whom to mail topographical maps as soon
as off the pre^s. The Alameda County
committee has already sent in an order
for the first installment of the 100,000
maps wanted by that county, and the
presses are now at work on them, each
map having to undergo five impressions
to bring.out the six colors.
To facilitate folding, wrapping and
mailing, it waa decided to have them
struck off in lots of 10,000, wrappers for
which are ready and now being addressed.
Letters have been re ceived irom several
Eastern newspapers, one â the Clinton
(Wis.) Herald â asking for maps to offer
as premiums for new subscribers, and
another â the Sauk Rapids (Minn.) Sen
tinel â requesting enough maps to inclose
with an entire edition.
The secretary's report showed that funds
are coming in satisfactorily. It was also
reported that local development associa
tions, to co-operate with the general com
mittee, have been permanently organized
in Hayward, Alameda county, and New
castle, Placer county, and preliminary
steps for such organization taken in Selma,
Gridley, Bakersfield, Santa Cruz, Ventura
and other places. The committee has re
ceived a letter from B. B. Collier of Nash
ville, Term., manager of the Nashville Ex
position, in which he says:
As you, no doubt, know, we are going to
nave a centennial celebration here, beginning
the Ist of May, 1897, and running six month.-.
If you will make a display of California prod
ucts, I will look after the same for you without
cost.
The committee will lay the matter be
fore its com mitt eemen in the various
counties, asking them to prepare suitable
exhibits, and suggesting that they be dis
played not only during the centennial, but
left there in competent hands as a perma
nent feature to interest the people of the
South.
The proposition of making a special
feature of the maps of San Francisco was
also discussed. The suggestion of having
a large map of the city on the reverse side
was favorably received. If the demand
will warrant it the committee will print
300,000 maps for San Francisco county.

REFUSED TO HEAR
MORE TESTIMONY
Mrs. Dr. Connolly Declared
Sane by Judge Heb
bard.
THE CASE LOOKED QUEER
His Honor Intimates That the
Charge Was Known to
Be False.
HAD HER HUSBAND ARRESTED.
The Woman Declares That the Doctor
Is Trying to Get Her Out of
the Way.
Judge Hebbard of tbe Superior Court
put a peremptory stop to an insanity trial
in his court yesterday with an order and
air that indicated that he was not satisfied
that the charge was brought in good faith.
Mrs. Kate Connolly, the wife of Dr.
Thomas Connolly, a physician residing at
Fourth and Bryant streets, was charged
by her husband with being violently in
sane and dangerous to be at large.
Dr. Connolly was recently arrested on
his wife's complaint on a charge of battery.
The courtroom was crowded with wit-
nesses for both sides, the husband being
the principal one against the wife, the lat
ter being supported by her mother and nu
merous friends.
The strongest accusation Dr. Connolly ap
peared to be able to bring against his wife
was that she used violent language at
times, drank beer occasionally and was
careless about leaving matches and kero
sene about the house. The only other
witness on the husband's side who was ex
amined was C. M. Johnson, who testified
that he had formerly lodged in the home
of the Connollys and that at one time
when the doctor was sick she had paid lit
tle attention to him. He had seen Mrs.
Connolly drink beer, but could not say
that he had ever seen her intoxicated.
Mrs. Connolly's defense opened by the
calling of her mother, Mrs. O'Connell, who
caused much amusement by a heated
tirade against her daughter's husband,
which even the Judge's admonitions were
unable to stop. She described Dr. Con
nolly as a most cruel man, and seemed
much disgusted when Judge Hebbaid
ordered her to leave the witness-stand
without describing the particular cruelties
to which she referred.
Tne defendant was the most collected
and self-possessed of any of those connected
with the case, and answered the questions
propounded to her in a perfectly rational
manner. She stated that she had been
married to Dr. Connolly lor eight years,
and was the mother of seven children,
four being alive, and the oldest 4lÂ£ years.
Her husband beat and bruised her shame
fully, she said, and a short time previous
to the birth of her last child had thrown
her to the floor and kicked her in the ribs.
She had been compelled to flee to her
mother for safety.
Her answers were given in a low, clear
voice, quite different than that usually
used by maniacs.
'â¢That's enough. I don't want to hear
any more testimony," said Judge Heb
bard, when she had finished her tale of
woe. "This woman is perfectly sane and
it seems strange that she should have
been brought here on such a charge. It
appears to me that there is something here
that needs investigation. Madam, you
may go home."
He turned as though to address the hus
band, but that worthy was already on his
way out of the courtroom and Judge Heb
bard's withering glance fell on his back.
Mrs. Connolly aaid after her trial that
she was being persecuted by her husband
because she had had him arrested on Sat
urday last on a charge of battery for turn
ing the garden-hose on her and otherwise
making her life miserable.
"He popes to get me out of the way,"
she said, "bufc he will not succeed now
that Judge Hebbard has given me my lib
erty and i shall prosecute the case against
him in the Police Court to the last limit."
THIN BLUE POLICE LINE
More Officers Are Needed for
the Unlighted Suburban
Blocks.
Street Lamps Wanted Along the
Line of the Sutro Electric
Railway.
Richmond District and Presidio Heights
are asking for more police protection.
George R. Sanderson, president of the Pre
sidio Heights Improvement Club, stated
yesterday that so thin is the force in his
locality that one officer must circle around
thirty blocks.
"Our two officers|are walkers," said Mr.
Sanderson yesterday, "but when the po
liceman is fifteen blocks away what pro
tection have you?
"We also want a new schoolhouse, as
there are now a large number of children
around the Heights and the nearest
pchools are too far away. Improvement?
Our improvement club has nothing to do
with the federated clubs and does not be
lieve that a federation of clubs will do the
work. Each club can best labor for its
own locality."
Attorney Charles Hubbs of the Rich
mond District Property-owners' Associa-
j tion stated yesterday that the people of
his locality had asked for tbe establish
ment of a police station in the district.
"Some time ago we were told," said he,
I "that if we would provide a suitable
j building a sufficient number of officers
! would be detailed to man the new station
â¢ just as soon as it could be done. It is not
true that we are opposed to an increase of
the force or that the present force is in
efficient. This growing City needs ma
I provements all along the line, and no club
I has been more progressive than the Ricn-
I mond Property-owners' Association. It
has worked alone tor the benefit of the
locality. It brought about the anti-ceme
tery ordinance, which makes it a misde
meanor to sell any more buiial lots within
the City limits.
"Tbe association does not intend to join
the federated clubs, as it can work for the
district best by appealing directly to the
governing boards. Understand, we have
no criticism for the federated clubs; we
simply feel that we can work better as we
are. The Point Lobos Improvement Club
is a part of the federated clubs.
"There is another thing* that should be
attended to, and that is the placing of
electric street lights along Clement street.
West of Twelfth avenue that thorough
fare is dark as a pocket at night. The
motormen of the Sutro road, which rushes
along Clement street, are unable in tbe
darkness to see the would-be passengers
standing by the tracks."
Rev. Mr. Clapham, recently from Los
Gatos, has been appointed to St. James
Episcopal Mission on Clement street, be
tween Fifth and Sixth avenues. He will
preach his first sermon next Sunday.
In The Call of Monday it was intimated
that George F. Fletcher of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club had expressed himself
as being indenendent of the federated
clubs, when It should have been Charles
Hubbs of the other Richmond district
improvement association.

â  1 With 737-
You may reject all belief in omens.as they
are often "founded upon superstition, but
the simple number of 737 may have much
to do in the shaping of your future happi-
ness ami final destiny. The secret of this
lucky number is not revealed to you in
dreumbooks, nor can you glean it from
the stars. You must look for it in another
direction. You can see thousands of men
and women in every grade and condition
] of life who pin their faith to this number
I and build their hopes upon it. The
| affluent banker, the eminent lawyer, the
pious clergyman, the sturdy mechanic,
I the sun-burnt farmer, the dashing broker,
the hardy miner, all elbow each other in
their eagerness to reach their Mecca.
! 737.
The vast throng who continue to daily
I seek this number do so in quest of happi-
! ness, with which they have not always
; been blessed. Perhaps you. yourself, have
1 not. Possibly you have been foolish in
I your younger days or indiscreet in after
years and now suffer the evil effects of it.
While you may be afflicted with no acute
disease, yet you are conscious of the fact
that something is wrong with you. You feel
that you are nervous and irritable. You
; feel that your thoughts and ideas are dull
and often become confused. You feel that
your sleep is bad, unrefreshing and some-
j times disturbed by weakening dreams.
i You feel that your energy and ambition
are gone. You feel that you are unfit for
i study, business or the proper enjoyment
! of either married or single life. You there-
fore meet with repeated failures and from
the depths of your gloom and mortifica-
tion you cry out that fate is against you,
never thinking that

GREAT LEADERS CHEERED.
California Republicans Will Stand by
the Platform of the Conven
tion.
Republican delegates from California to
the St. Louis National Convention re
ceived a happy send-off by the Union
League last night. The good wishes of
the club were expressed by a banquet
spread in the conservatory of the Palace
Hotel. Tbe tables were arranged in the
form of an elongated horseshoe. At one
end of the room a banner bearing tbe de
vice, â¢â¢California-St. Louis, 1896," was ex
hibited. The lettering of tbe motto was
wrought in blended gold and silver. At
ihe other end of the room the National
flag was displayed.
The guests and members of the club took
their places shortly after 7 o'clock. Atthe
head of the table sat General S. W. Backus, i
On one side sat George A. Knight and
on the other Jacob Neff. Near the nead of '
tie table were Judg^ McFarland, Frank J
McLaughlin, Charies M Shortridge, Her- j
vey Lindley, Paris KLourn, P. B. Corn- j
wall. E. C. Voorheis, Tnomas Flint, George |
Stone, M. K. Higgins and Frank D. Ryan. I
General Backus, in calling the guests to <
attention, announced that as the presi- J
dent of the club was a guesi, another
member had been called on to preside, and j <
that one was himself. It was thought i
best, said the general, that some recogni- I t
tion should be given to the delegation !
from California to the National Conven- j
tion. He closed by calling on George A.
Knight, delegate-at-large, to respond.
Mr. Knight said he hardly knew what
to say, being the only delegate-at-large
present. Talking to you as friends in a
quiet way, I can say that we have some
dangers to avoid. The delegates that go
from here must be in touch with the coun
try east of the Missouri River, where most
of the people live. We cannot go there
and say that we won't play unless Califor
nia is recognized. Personally lam an ad
vocate of the free and unlimited coinage i
of American silver. If the convention j
dissents from my position I shall not go I
off and form a party by myself. [Cheers.] i
Mr. Knight said there was no question j
about the nomination of William McKin
ley. He will be nominated. [Cheers.]
Speaking of California and the party in ;
this State Mr. Knight said men of wealth,
of character and clean purposes had given i
their service to the party and if mistakes
had been made they were mistakes of tbe j
head and not of the Heart. The party was
in excellent form and the delegates were
going to St. Louis animated by a desire to
to do the best possible for the advance- j
raent of the Republican party of the
Nation.
Judge Carpenter, responding to a senti
ment that Kentucky would go Republican
this year, said he did expect the Solid
South to be broken this year. He was not
going to St. Louis, as it was too great a j
distance to travel to attend a ratification j
meeting. McKinley would be nominated, !
but a platform must be made.
Judge Carpenter then spoke of the grave !
responsibility that devolved UDon the con- j
vention. I think when you get to St. Louis ]
and look over the situation you will agree :
on the money prescribed by the constitu- I
tion. gold and silver. [Cneers.l
The American Protective Association
was incidentally mentioned by the j
speaker, who recounted the patriotism, j
courage and character of such Americans j
as Lincoln, Chase and Grant, and said j
their example should guide Republicans. .
He spoke of idle factories, prostrated in- I
dustries, and said such a condition of
affairs could not have been brought about
by a Republican administration. Make
protection to American labor the keystone
of the arch, and then prosperity will fol
low.
To the delegates I say good luck and
God-speed. Now let them give us McKin
ley and protection, and we will win.
The chairman, referring to illustrious
Presidents of t.ie Republican party, called
upon Henry C. Dibble to respond.
Mr. Dibble said he had been observing
the attitude of the Democratic party. He
spoke of th^ Democratic party as one of
resistence. The party was in no sense
constructive, yet it did absurdly talk of !
constructing a financial system for this j
country. He reviewed the work of the j
Republican Presidents and remarked that
the convention at St. Louis would name
the next President. The candidate would
be like the little fighting Monitorâ a
double-enoerâ Bill McKinley and McKin
ley bill.
General Backus called on Frank L.
Coombs of Napa, ex-United States Min
ister to Japan. Mr. Coombs observed that
the Republican party was the party of th
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 1896.
whole Nation, and he trusted that tMe
platform-makers of St. Louis would recog- ,
nize that fact. There is one proposition
On which the American people are in i
earnest, and that is the proposition that i
with McKinley on a platiorm of protec
tion Republicans can win this battle. Let |
us therefore devote ourselves to that j
principle of government which gives us j
strength and prosperity.
Chairman Backus said the South was
coming to the fr i nt, and from the south
ern part of the State comes Henry Hervey.
Mr. Lindley said he had the honor of |
being selected chairman of the Republican j
delegation to St. Louis, aid one of the :
conditions of his selection was that lie
should not talk. He paid a tribute to the
talking qualities of George A. Knieht,
Samuel Shortridge, Frank Shorb and Dan
Cole and created some merriment. In \
closing Mr. Lindley said Republicans
conld be assured that they would get in ;
this campaign McKinley and protection i
and victory.
Tirey L. Ford, from Northern Califor- I
nia, said that from the limited observa- j
lion that he had the opportunity of mak
ing while East, there was a possibility
that California would not set just what she j
expects at St. Louis; but with one voice
California will find the Eastern States
shouting for protection. "One thing im
presses itself on my mind. Thorough or
ganization will frequently win against
larger numbers inefficiently organized.
We' must be careful; we must organize |
and be vigilant." He referred to the mas
ter campaign managed by Quay in 1888,
when Harrison was elected. In San Fan
cisco Republicans should not sleep. Or- \
ganization should be perfect. At the head j
of tbe State organization we have the j
magnetic leader, Frank McLaughlin. |
[Cheers.J
The guests cheered for McLaughlin, and
called on him spontaneously to speak.
He responded briefly, promising to work
vigilantly for the success of the party.
Charles M .Shortri'lge was next intro
duced by General Backus. Mr. Short
ridge presented the regrets of John D.
Spreckels, who could not attend. The
speaker paid, his compliments to Judge I
Carpenter as'one of the grandest of Re
publican orators. Referring to his own
Republicanism he said he was born in
lowa, and recently while there saw that
grand old statesman, Allison [Cheers.],
who had served the party so honorably
and nobly for forty yearÃ. "1 nnnly
thought that if I had the choice 1 would
name Allison for President. Now I am a
Republican in season and out seasonâ in
defeat and success. [Cheers.] I remember
when our great leader, Blame, was de
feated. Mr. Shortridge referred eloquently
to the organizing genius of many great
Republican leaders, and mentioned Matt j
Quay of Pennsylvania as the high priest of
organization.
"I recognize that the decision of the |
American people is for McKinley and I am
a Republican ready to join in the great Mc-
Kinley ratification meeting at St. Louis. I
like to get with Republicans and speak of
victory. I am glad to hear that distin
guished statesmen are recopnized here
this evening. Hereto-night we have the
able and ready old-time Republican, Jacob
Neff."
Mr. Shortriiige paid a line tribute to the
executive ability of Frank McLaughlin,
and made such a rincing and captivating
address throughout thit he was cheered
and toasted as the orator of the Republi
can press of California. The audience
arose and gave him a rousing ovation.
General Backus observed humorously
that the great men of California were
either colonels or orators, and Mr. Short
ridge was not a colonel.
Frank D. Ryan of Sacramento eulogized
the Republican party, tracing the history
of its achievement:;, its services to human
ity and freedom. He touched the tinnn
ciul question by saying that the Republi
can party had demonstrated its capacity
to deal with that problem. The enforce
ment of the principle of protection would
do much to solve the money question.
J. C. Lynch, candidate for Lieutenant-
Governor, spoke next, and promised to do
his share of the work ahead. He was con
fident of Republican success under the
banner of McKiniev and protection.
Jacob Neff of Placer was the next
speaker. The audience drank his health,
and Mr. Neff made a brief speech. His
heart had been touched by the fire of
oratory. He was not insensible to tbe
obligation devolving upon him as a dele
gate to the St. Louis Convention. He
held Cleveland and tue Democratic party
responsible for the idle factories, the un
employed men and tbe stagnation in this
country to-day. He said: "Let us go to
Ht. Louis with this slogan: McKinley,
Protection and Victory !"

Grant and not U. S. Grant Jr. is the pro
posed candidate for Vice-President, and
says that the people in this region of the
State are astray on the proposition. The
Grant boom was initiated by Colonel Otis
of Los Angeles, and the correspondence on
the subject refers to Colonel Fred Grant of
New York.
tor many years George A. Knight has
been reearded as one of Mr. De Young's
greatest admirers and strongest political
supporters. The orator who has roused
many conventions to enthusiasm is known
as one of the most independent and out
spoken of public men in this State.
Frank McGowan of Humboldt County,
an able Republican, who has long served the
State in the Senate, and looked ahead for
Congressional honors, is now ready to be
sent to Congress, provided the voters
in his district are ready, but the am
bition on the part of McGowan uoes not
seem to meet De Young's approval. It
happens that McGowan and Knight have
been life-long friends, and the latter is not
at all pleased with the far-away and lofty
attitude of De Young in this affair.
RATIFY THE NOMINATION
Enthusiastic Meeting of the Re
publican Executive
Council.
They Will Act in Conjunction With
the County Committee and Show
Their Strength.
The Republican Executive Council held
an enthusiastic meeting in Judge Dainger
field's courtroom last night at which the
presidents of the district clubs were in
vited to be present. Fifteen out of the
eighteen responded, besides T. B. Morton,
president of the African- American League,
and Mrs. Addie L. Ballou, president of the
Woman's State Central Republican Club.
In the absence of Judge M. Cooney,
president of the club, H. C. Firebaugh oc
cupied the chair.
The meeting was called to receive a re
port from Judge Cooney, T. B. Morton
and John A. Whiteside, the committee
appointed to confer with the County Com
mittee and State Central Committee as to
holding a ratification meeting after the
nomination of President by the St. Louis
convention.
T. FÂ». Morton reported that the commit
> tee had waited upon the County and State
Central committees, and the president of
the former had sent a communication to
Assistant Secretary S. M. Williams, giving
the result of their action.
Major Whiteside read the communica
tion, which stated that, the County Com
mittee had met yesterday afternoon and
decided to noUl a ratification meeting, but
had not yet made any arrangements. The
council would, however, be notified in
time.
T. B. Morton raised a storm by stating
that all the ratification meetings through
out the State were to be held under the
auspices of the County committees on the
evening after the nomination at St. Louis.
James E. Field, 1. E. .Tarrett, E. J. Mar
tin, George Elder, Mrs. Ballou and others
protested vigorously against the County
Committee taking the power out of the
hands of the Republican Executive
Council, which was a State organization
and not merely a county one. They urged
that the council should hold a ratification
meeting irrespective of the County Com
mittee, which they considered had cast an
undeserved snub upon them. They must
not go on losing ground, but must make
an effort to prove their strength.
George Elder moved that a committee of
three be appointed to arrange for a suit
able hall to hold a ratification meeting
under the auspices of the Executive
Council.
Chairman Firebangh appealed for har
mony and urged in accoraance with true
Republican principles that they unite with
the County Committee.
Finally George Elder withdrew his mo
tion and moved that the communication
be received and placed on file, which was
adopted.
T. B. Morton moved that the council
ratify the nomination on the night follow
ing, and James E. Field moved as an
amendment that the council hold a ratifi
cation meeting in conjunction with the
County Committee.
Oscar Tolle suggested that a committee
of five be appointed to wait upon the
County Committee to make arrangements
for the ratification meeting.
After some discussion L. B. Leavitt
moved as an amendment to the amend
ment that the committee of three be con
tinued and that the council hold a ratifica
tion meeting in conjunction with the
County Committee.
The amendment to the amendment, the
amendment and the motion were carried
unanimously and a motion of George Elder
that the secretary be instructed to notify
each president of the clubs that tfie ratifica
tion meeting was to be held the night after
the nomination and asking them to call the
club together; also that each member wear
a ribbon with "Executive council" on it.
James E. Field was appointed grand
marshal. The appointment of marshals
was left to the clubs and the meeting ad
journed till Monday night in the same
place.

SHARKEY GETS
DOWN TO WORK
Says He Will Make This
the Fight of His Life
Against Corbett.
WILL NOT RUN AWAY.
Members of the Civic Federation
Say They Will Try to
Stop the Mill.
DILLE AND TRUMAN TALK.
Manager Grcom of the Nationals Says
It Is an Exhibition Within
the Pale of the Law.
Tom Sharkey made a dive for the hand
ball before it got out of bounds in the
Acme Athletic Club gymnasium in Oak
land while training yesterday afternoon.
He lunged too hard, missed the ball and
collided with a red-headed youth who sat
on a rail in the front row of spectators.
The youth went over backward with
Sharkey on top and struck his red heaa on
an iron plate screwed on the floor. The
voune man saw red stars. The iron plate
raised a bump on the back of his head not
any bigger than the monse that Sharkey
says he'll try to raise under one of Jim
Corbett's eyes in their approaching four
round battle.
The sailor lad paused a little while dur
ing the training and, while Tim McGrath,
one of the trainers who is assistant to
Needham, wiped tte perspiration from his
face and brawny shoulders and chest,
talked a little abput the right:
"No, 1 haven't outlined my plan of battle
yet," he said. "It is too early. lam just
getting down to work and there is plenty
of time to think about that. But you can
say that Corbett will know I've been before
him; he'll be aware that I am in the rinÂ«:,
all right enough. I'll not run awayâ don't
you ever think that."-
This is the most that Sharkey has said
about the coming contest to date, except
to his trainers and most intimate friends.
He is a silent fellow and talks very little
as a rule, even to Needham. There is a
vast difference between a trained talker
and a trained fighter. Sharkey is the lat
ter aad not one particle the former. He
smiles once in a whiie, and talks even less.
He seems to be looking on the serious side
of the panorama of the prize-ring most of
the time.
From the way they started in yesterday
it is evident that Needham is going to give
bharkey plenty of training. Needham
said:
"Tom is going to make the fierht of his
life with Corbett. I intend to get him into
fine condition, and the rest remains chiefly
with him then. Sharkey is improving
right along since his first fi^ht with
Choynski. Anybody who saw him then
and will loofc at him now can see the
change for the better. He has improved
a great deal, and I think ie will keep on
improving. He gets around better, and is_
not a bit aiow for orfe of his weight."
Little Tim McGrath, the chief rubdown
artist for Sharkey, said yesterday: "Tom
is such a quiet fellow that you can't tell
very well what he thinks about his chances
with Corbett. He can stand a lot of
punishment though. It is a good oppor
lunity for him to stand up before Corbett,
and lie knows it. He has everything to
gain and nothing to lose. One thing I can
tell you: that is that Tom is not going
to stand up aa stiff as an Indian cigar
stand and be slugged. He's a hitter, he is."
He thinks if he can get in one or two hard
body blows on Corbett that he'll stand a
fine chance of winning out in style."
So much for the talk of the fighters and
trainers.
Sharkey's worsing-day begins early in
the morning. Yesterday was the first dhy
devoted to getting into condition. He will
take a long walk every morning. Yester
day the pedestrian excursion extended to
and around Lake Merritt and to Pied
mont and return. Needham eoes along.
When they get tired of keeping up a
steady walk they start into a trot or a run
to rest themselves.
When Sharkey was 10 years of age he
ran away from his home in Ireland. In
the same year he became helper to a
blacksmith". Stripped for work in the
Acme gymnasium yesterday he looked a
boss blacksmith in strength. His muscu
lar development is so marked that Her
cules might have been proportionately
proud of it. He nas an India ink picture
of a full-rigged ship on his broad chest,
with a few blue stars showing in the fir
nianent of musle around it.- His exercise
consists of punching the bag, handball,
skipping the rope, winding up a wrist
machine and tossing a large, heavy,
leather-covered ball which might be a foot
ball if it was much smaller and ninety
nine times lighter.
Sharkey and Needham punched ten or
twelve rounds on tbe bag. After a short
rest the sailor lad went at it again alone.
He banged it against the woQcien canopy
with such lapidity that.the force of con
tact sounded like tbe explosions oi a Gat
ling gun or the bombardment of the earlj
morning of the glorious Fourth by cannon
crackers touched off in a bunch. The ball
flew back and forth swifter than sight.
Each bound was met by the brawny-fists
of the sailor lad and each blow increased
the rapidity of the bombardment and the
velocity of the flying sphere. Suddenly,
with a terrific blow square in the face, the
rope from which it was pendent snapped
and the big ball went sailing down the
hall. That ended the bag-punching ex
ercise for the day.
There is quite a contrast between Need
ham and SharKey as they play handball.
The trainer is nimble and spry on his
pius and moves more quickly and with
more gracefulness than Sharkey. Though
it appears to '.ake the sailor lad longer to
tret to the ball, somehow he gets to the
swiftest bounds of the ball. Yesterday he
made but few misses, the most disastrous
one being when he went headlong into
the red-headed youth. Sharkey worked
just as hard at handball as he did at slug
ging the sphere.
Tne big sailor boy skips the rope as
lightly as a fairy. He appears to enjoy it
as much as a schoolgirl. Somebody men
tioned something about "Ail right till
broad daylight a-skipping the tra-la-loo,"
and then the sailor lad laughed. He threw
his face as though he sniffed salt water
afar off, and the rope went whirling on.
That big, heavy leather cannon-ball was
thrown to him next, and he tossed it
around line Â£he man in the circus. He
kept it up in the air apparently as long as
he wished by banging it with his fists each
time it came down within striking dis
tance. Then Sharkey ar.d Needham tossed
it back and forth, standing about thirty
feet apart. One time Sharkey put too
much muscle behind it, ami the ball flew
far out of its previous orbit over Need
ham's head, and tbe crowd scattered.
There was no sparring in the exercise
yesterday. The reason was that one of
Needham's hands is sore. If the hand is
not all right by to-day and there is no
worthy substitute around, there will be no
sparring till the hand has recovered. The
bath and rubdown conclude the exercise.
Sharkey has been put on regular diet.
He eats chops and eggs for breakfast, roast
beef and vegetables for dinner at noon,

in Schuetzen Park Yesterday.
and for supper he partakes of steak. He
drinks tea or milk, but no coffee or butter
is allowed him. He can have a little fruit
if h* wants it.
Sharkey has had a long career as a
sailor. He is only 24 years old. He has
been second mate of several sailing craft
and his last position aboard ship was as
bosun aboard the cruiser Philadelphia.
Once when before the mast on the ship
Aristides the ship was out of her couse,
and when the storm blew over all hands
found themselves almost within hailing
distance of the polar bears of the south
pole. They were in 64 degrees south lati
tude In the South Atlantic. During that
experience the saiior lad who is going to
face the world's champion pugilist on the
24th inst. had his feet, ears and hands
nipped by the southern frost before they
got back into tbe gulf stream and a softer
atmosphere.
Corbett is training down to harder work
gradually in the gymnasium of the
Olympic Athletic Ciub. He punches the
bag, twists the wrist machine, plays his
favorite handball with great agiiity, and
spars with "Young Corbett" (George
Green) and Billy Delaney. The champion
emerges from his exercise feeling mori
springy each day. But he refuses to get
down to very hard training.
TRUMAN AND DILLE OBJECT
Say the Contest Will Be Stopped
If It Is Against the
Law.
The Civic Federation will take a hand
in the coming fight between Corbett and
Sharkey. It will not be in the purchase
of tickets to witness the contest, but on
the contrary, to invoke the strong arm of
the law to stop it.
These are the calculations in the minds
of some of the officers as expressed by I.
J. Truman, the president of that body,
and George T. Gaden, the acting secretary.
A call will be issued for a meeting of
the members of the Civic Federation for
some evening this week, at which the
question will be fully discussed as to the
proper course to be pursued to have the
authorities step in and prevent the ex
hibition if it can be done.
Iv an interview with Mr. Truman last
night by a Call representative that gentle
man expressed himself as follows:
''Yes; the Civic Federation will meet
some eveningn g this week and consult upon
the prope r course to take to stop this in
decent sloggingâ mind I say 'slogeing,'
advisedly, because it will be nothing else.
"Do you mean to tell me that people are
willing to pay $2 50 to witness an exhibi
tion of what they call 'science?' I
do not think so. This exhibition is to be,
pure and simple, brutal slogging for a
money cansideration, and as such we will,
if we can, put a stop to the so-called
scientific exhibition.
"I am more than astonished at Acting
! Mayor Taylor," he said, "in signing the
j permit. I certainly expected better from
! him. He has made a good, conscientious
S Supervisor, and now when the power was
! given him to show his disapproval of this
! extiibition he does not do it.
"Even assuming that it is to be a match
of science," Mr. Truman continued, "do
you think that the youth of this City are
helped by seeing such an exhibition?
Have we not enough real exhibitions in
the blood-letting line every day in the
year without giving our boys new points
as to the best method of blackening a
nighbor's eyes and punching noses?
"The State Legislature has prohibited
this very thing. Well, we will see about
it belore we get through," he continued.
The same sentiments are entertained by
George T. Gaden and Stewart Menzies.
Rev. Dr. Elbert R. Dille, pastor of the
Central Metbodist Church, says he does
not intend to appeal to Governor Budd or
ask that the State militia be called out to
stop the boxers, but he does say that it
appears to nim to be an infraction of the
law and that they will stop it if it is un
lawful. He was seen last evening after the
j weekly prayer meeting in his church was
over. He said:
"It seems to me that tne fight of Corbett
and Sharkey is not only against the ordi
nance but a" violation of the State law, as
it is a brutal contest. My attention was
first called to it to-day. I never have
heard of Sharkey before, but when I see a
newspaper with a picture of Corbett in it I
always tnrow it down. We, but I speak
individually only, for I have not seen Mr.
; Truman, expect to put a stop to this
> fight if it is a violation of law, and whether
it is or whether it is not it ought to be
stopped anyway."
"Many prominent citizens are seen at
sparring contests," said The Call repre
sentative.
"So much the worse; so much the
worse," repeated Rev. Dr. Dille. "It low
ers the moral standard."
Manager Groom of the National Ath
letic Club, before whicn the contest will
take place, said last evening:
"This is not a finish fight and not con
trary to law. It is an exhibition. Corbett
is here now for the last time, or at least
for a number of years, and the people want
to see him. The contest will be entirely
within the pale of the law. It is no prize
fight. The police will see that we keep
within the law.
"Though toe tickets for this event," he
said, "will not be on sale till next Monday,
we already have applications for seats
from bankers, attorneys, leading mer
chants and other prominent people. These
I gentlemen would not support a violation
| of the law.
"If Dr. Dille has never attended one of
| these exhibitions I would like to have him
| come and see what they are like. I would
like to have him and a committee of the
Civic Federation attend, and we will give
them the best box in the house," con
cluded Manager Groom.

GROCERS ENJOY
A GRAND OUTING
Schuetzen Park a Scene of
Merriment and Fes
tivity.
FAT LADIES MADE A HIT.
H. H. Becker's Score of 64 Heads

Shooting.
MERSHON, THE IRREPRESSIBLE.
Retail Grocers' Association Elated
Over the Large Attendance at
Their Outing.
It was a great day for the Retail Gro
cers' Association yesterday. It was the
occasion of their twenty-fifth annual out
ing at Schuetzen Park, and so gleefully
was the day celebrated that many of tne
members averred with varying degrees of
solemnity that George Washington's
birthday wasn't in it.
The ferry-boats took three loads oj peo
ple over in the morning and two in the
afternoon. And the boats were crowded,
too, with just the jolliest lot of people that
ever gathered together.
Talk about the cosmopolitan character
of San Francisco! The skeptic should just
have cast his eagle eye over that assem
blage at Schuetzen Park about the time of
the arrival of the second boat in the after
noon.
There were large men and small men,
distinguished-looking men and common
appearing ones, men with beards and
others minus these wind protectors,
humorous men and a few crochety ones,
swells, dressed after the mode laid down
for the season by the London tailors, and
others that didn't care anything about
their wearing apparel so long as they had
their fill of fun.
And then, there were the women. " The
list would seem incomplete and prejudiced
without a mention of the ladies. The
haughty belle from Nob Hill reclined on
the cool grass under the same shade trees
as the maiden from "Paradise Alley."
Baby buggies, decked out with gay ribbons,
were present in abundance.
For the day was warm, intensely warm,
and shade trees were in demand, as well
as those different drinKs commonly sup
posed to conduce to man's happiness
when old Sol takes a notion to quit wrest
ling round with the spots on his surface
and devotes the whole of his time to tbe
promulgation of heat waves in the direc
tion of our poor, little earth.
The fat ladies' race was a feature of the
day that might well be called a "picnic"
itself. There were a good many entries,
and at the crack oi the pistol away they
went, amid the howls of the sightseers,
mopping their fevered brows while on the
jump. Mrs. Weiners came in first, mop
ping her brow wirh one hand and trying
to detain a wandering hairpin with the
other. She was closely followed by Mrs.
Reynolds second, and Mrs. Boitano third.
The fat men's race was just as funny.
With hats off, handkerchiefs bound
around their heads, and faces screwd up at
at an angle of 30 degrees to form a groove
to keep the perspiration out of their eyes,
they stood fretfully in position and impa
tiently waited for the starter to fire his re
volver.
Just as he was about to do this there
came a disturbance. J. R. T. Mershon,
the genial drummer whom everybody
seemed to know, arrived on the scene and
promptly insisted that there was no use in
talking, he was going to get into that race.
Of course, being he, they waited for him
to shed his hat, coat and waistcoat and
get on the line. He did this with re
markable alacrity.
As the pistol cracked off they went, big
"Fattie" Roesler in the lead. He kept it,
too, and distinguished himself by going
over the line with a great hop, skip and
jump. He afterward said lie intended to
keep his prize, one case of Sauterne, to
cool himself off with when he ran again.
Messrs. Glynn and Smith were second
and third respectively. Mershon came in
last, vainly clinging to the coattails of the
man ahead of nim. His method of not
getting last evoked uproarious applause.
In the race of boys from 9 to 12 years of
age Kennedy came in first, Haups second,
Aiurphy third, Leffmann fourth, Schu
macher fifth and Carroll sixth. Their
prizes varied all the way from a hammock
to a pair of suspenders.
In the boys' race from 12 to 15 years
Weston won, Parker second, Maher third
and Kelly fourth. Among the prizes re
ceived were such articles as a football,
pocket-knile and harmonica.
One of the prettiest scenes witnessed
during the day was the race of little girls
from 9 to 12 years of age. Their young,
lithe limbs went skipping over the ground
like a rubber ball. Little Miss Talfor won
the first prize, a fancy cake, and the Misses
O'Neil, Smith and McDonald the others.
In tne girls' race only misses from 12 to
15 years oil contested. They came over
the line in the following order: Miss
Moore, Miss Cummins, Miss Madden, Miss
Sullivan and Miss Thode.
Then there was the young ladies' race.
None of them wore bloomers, but the way
they got over the ground was a terror to
dress-reformers. Miss Coad came out first,
Miss Hanna second, Miss Herring thirvl,
Miss Hauser fourth and Miss Bearwald
fifth.
The young men's race was won by Rob
inson. Cummings was second and Bur
gess third.
The retail grocers' olerss also had a con
test of their own. Burke won and the
other i>rize-winners came over the line in
the following order: Sullivan, Lonergan
and Bender.
The porters' race was won by Robinson,
Toomy getting in second and Sullivan
third.'
Believing that it was not fair to let mar
riage bar ladies from racing on the grounds
given by certain bachelor members of the
associationâ that in chasing their hus
bands with culinary articles tney got more
practice man was allowable, thus becom
ing professionals and leaving the amateur
class â they were permitted to compete.
Mrs. Burns proved the fleetest, Mrs. Erick
sen came in second, and Mrs. Conroy and
Mrs. Bostrom third and fourth respec
tively.
This ended tbe racing. But the great
event of the day yet remained, namely
the tue-of-war. A married men's team
pulled against a single men's team. The
captain of the former was Walter Hewitt,
of the latter, Harry Roesler.
The former team consisted of the cap
tain, Lindauer (anchorman); Moran,
Kennedy, Stohlman. Monaco, McVicker,
Maxwell, Kerr and Thompson. The lat
ter of the captain, Henneberg (anchor
mani; Glynn Luhm, Asher, Hons, Heuer,
Gottschalk, Tuite and Calderwood.
During the preparations for the event
the contestants passed tne time in hold
ing their heads so the perspiration would
not dampen the spot they intended to use
in bracing their feet, and in vigorously
joshing one another.
"Hey, there! what a sorry looking lot
of Benedicts!" veiled one of the single
men's team. "Get on to their willowy
anchorman," was the answer.
Though they struggle'! hard the single
men's team were steedily jerked across
the line amid hearty applause ana good
uatured taunts.
"Which result plainly demonstrates,"
declared the irrepressible Mershon, "that
marriage is a tremendous drawback."
During all the time these games were in
progress the non-sporting element was in
the large dance hall, l.ghtly tripping in
time to the music of Ritzau's band. Danc
ing was kept up nearly till the time the
last train departed.
Shortly after the dancing for the after
noon began a banquet was given to the
press representatives in the dining hall,
which was presided over by President
John C. Nobmann.
The prizes for target shooting for mem
bers, with the scores, were awarded as fol
lows:
H. Tientjen, 62, first prize; William
King, 59, second; Charles Nobmann, 58,
third; Fred Myer, 57, fourth; J. H.
Haarjes. 56, fifth; George Wilkins and
John Schloen, 54 each, sixth; J. Larkey,
52, seventh; J. J. Moran, 51, eighth. A
number of others also received prizes, but
their scores were much smaller.
In the target-shooting for wholesalers
the following is the list of the principal
prize-winners with scores:
C. E. Whitney and J. A. Folger. 56 each,
first prize; Larrot & Co. and Cleveland
Bachdols, 48 each, second prize.
The drummers shot as follows: H. H.
Becker, 64, first prize, the highest score
made during the day; Charles E. Torres,
55, second; J. F. Faul, 54, third; S. T.
Blake, 52, fourth; L. Otzen 51, fifth.
The first prize in the target contest by
the press representatives was won by A.
H. Powers, with a score of 53. The second
and the third were won by James K. Tay
lor and F. L. Perkins, respectively. The
two latter refuse to publish their scores
purely through modesty.
N. F. Fields, the official scorer, who was
for sixteen years connected with the Police
Department of this City, wishes it under
stood that if the ammunition had rot
given out before he got to shoot no one
else would have stood even a drowning
man's chance.
The prizes in bowline were awarded to
the following persons in the order named :
W. Glinderman, J. Heitman, W. Schwarke,
Mr. Prehner, G. Glinderman and G. Han
erken. W. Schwarke also received the
prize for the most nines, and J. Heitman
the prize for the most poodles, a box of
Napa soda, at which he bemoaned his sad
fate in not being a Good Templar.
On the trip home, as the train passed
through the tunnels, several youthful
malefactors made a great smacking with
their lrps and emitted distressful cries of
"Oh, George, don't," and "I'll tell ma,"
whereat the young ladies were found to be
blushing painfully on coming into the
light, "and cast highly indignant glances
at the offenders.
Taken all in all, the outing was a grand
success, Ã¼bout 3000 people being present,
and the Retail Grocers' Association is
highly elated in consequence.

DOUBLES THE DEMAND.

Names to Its Patronage

DOES NOT CARE FOR EXPENSE.
An Unexampled Exhibition of Nerve
to Cap the Climax of Its
Prodigality.
In the general loot of the treasury that
distinguishes the present administration
in the City and County the Health De
partment has made itself conspicuous.
Already it has overdrawn its appropriation
for expenses, for jails and prisons and for
quarantine $1116, with three weeks to run
in the fiscal year.
There was appropriated for the expenses
of the Healtti Department proper this year
$29,900. This was almost $9000 more than
was appropriated for the same purpose for
the fiscal year of 1895-96. And yet with
this increase that amount is now overrun
$653 60â all the money gone and three
weeks of the year yet to run.
With tbe same ratio of expenditure
maintained for this month that has ob
tained before, and as a large part of the
monthly expenditure is for salaries, it will
necessarily be so this lund will be short
some $3000.
The appropriation for quarantine is
overdrawn $427 49 and by the application
of the same rule it will be $1000 over the
limit at the end of the month, which is
the end of the fiscal year. The jaiis and
prisons, now overdrawn $36, will be de
ficient to the sum of $150. With the funds
in these three appropriations increased to
begin with by about $9000 over the
amounts allowed in 1893-9 4 the expendi
tures will have still exceeded the sum al
lowed by over $4000.
There is in the smallpox fund, also in
charge of the Health Department, $1839 65
still remaining. This is the only fund
directly chargeable to the Health Depart
ment that is not overdrawn. They have,
however, expended $2560 35 of that fund.
The appropriation was $4400, which was a
considerable increase over that of 1893-94.
The ? alary list for the Health Office for the
year 1893-94 was $20,941 67. The salary list
alone for the same office for 189f>-96 was, or
will be, $29,400. It is as follows, the fig
ures beinÂ« per month:
Health Officer, $250; Secretary Board of
Healtn, $175; Assistant Secretary Board of
Health, $100; Messenger, $75; City Physician,
$150; Bacteriologist, $150; Medical Attend
ant, $100; Police Surgeon, $100; Milk In
spector, $100; Superintendent City Ceme
teries, $75; six Health Inspectors, $600; Chief
Market Inspector, $100; three Assistant Mar
ket Inspectors, at $75, $225; Plumbing In
spector, $125; Assistant Plumbing Inspector,
$100; Janitor, $30. Total for a month, $2450.
This sum repeated for twelve months
amounts to $29,400.
In view of these figures the estimate of
the requirements of the Health Office for
the incoming fiscal year is more than
merely interesting.
All the expenses of the Health Office, in
cluding salaries, for the year 1893-94
amounted to $25,107 97. The salary list
alone according to the demands of the
present hoard foots up $55,200.
The expenses of the office, apart from
salaries, for the years 1893-94 was $4166 30.
I The demands for next year for expenses
other than salaries amount to $77u0,
rnnking a total of $62,900 as against $25,
-107 97 of a year ago, and the $33,000 of this
year, counting the entire expenditure.
This big sum is exclusive too, of the $1800
j which is called for a permanent establish
ment of chemical and bacteriological
laboratories. Following is the requisition
in detail as filed:
Health Officer, $250; secretary, $175 ; first
assistant, $100; miik inspector, $200; baote- |
rioiogist, $150; veterinary surgeon, $150;
chemist and analyst, $150; public vaccinator, |
$100; clerk of vital statistics, $75; messenerer, j
typewriter, $60; assistant chemist, $75:
eight assistant milk and fuod inspectors
for open public food inspection sta
tions, $75 each, $600; three assistant
food and goods inspectors, $75 each, $225; !
chief market inspector, $100; 3 assistant mar- \
ket inspectors, $225; 2 disinterment inspec
tors (at $100), $200; 1 chief plumbing inspec
tor, $125; 1 assistant plumbing inspector,
$100; 6 health inspector;-, $600; 3 additional
sanitary Inspectors, $300; 3 sewer inspectors, ;
$225; 2 bakery inspectors, $150; 2 laundry
and bath inspectors, $150; janitor, $40. Total, j
$55,200.

It will be seen that this begins by in
creasing the salary of the milk inspector
$100â making it $200. Then it adds to the
salary list a veterinary surgeon at $150 a
month â formerly serving quite willingly
without pay. It adds a" chemist and
analyst at $150 a month. It add a public
vaccinator at $100 â the duties having been j
heretofore performed by the messenger of
the board. It adds a "clerk of vital statis
tics" at $75â the duties formerly performed
excellently well by the secretary of the
board. It adds a type-writer at $60. It
adds an assistant chemist at $75.
It adds eight assistant food-inspectors
at $75 each or $600 a month. It adds three
assistant "food and goods inspectors" at
$75 each or $225 a month. It adds two
"disinterment inspectors" at $100 each,
$200 a month. It adds an assistant plumb
ing inspector at $100. It adds three ad
ditional sanitary inspectors at $100, or $300
a month. It adds two bakery inspectors
at $75 each or $150. It adds two laundry
and bath inspectors at $75 or $150 a month.
It increases the salary of the janitor from
$30 to $40 a month.
This is what the street Arab would call
a "cuckoo." It adds no less than twenty
eight men to the salary list of the Health
Board, the trouble with which at the pres
ent moment is that it is much too long.
The salaries to be paid to these new em
ployes would foot up $29,340. This pro
posed addition to the present expensive !
tigure is just $8398 33 more than the entire I
salary list of the office for the year 1893-94.
But the Health Officer is not content
with this. He has submitted a requisi
tion for the Receiving Hospital that nearly
doubles the entire expense of that institu
tion last year. The "salary list for the
Receiving hospital last year amounted to
$64::0. The appropriation for the hospital
this year was $10,000. and it will be used \
up. The estimate for next year submitted !
by the .Health Officer, in addition to a
requisition of Police Surgeon Weil for
$1385, is as follows:

WILL YOU BE
STRONG WHEN
YOU ARE OLD ?
As you would protect youi
house against the wearing of
the storm so that it will be pre-
served and suitable to shelter
you when you grow old, so you
ought to guard your physical
body against the ' inroads of
disease, so that it will be healthy
and well preserved when you
are an old man.
When you are young and the
forces of nature active you can
often smother these light pains
and weaknesses that trouble
you, but in doing so you have
to call up your reserve vitality.
That is a nail in your coffin, for
it wastes your reserve force,
which should be saved till you
grow old. It is this reserve
force which keeps up the health
in old men when they are
healthy.
Every man wastes this force
more or less. Sometimes he
wastes all of it, and instead of
finding his weakness when he is
old it comes on him while he is
still a young man.
His life from that time is
miserable devoid of the power
of manhood, ruined nerve
power, and finally lost memory
and mental imbecility he be-
comes a wreck.
This is a pitiable state of
human waste. Thousands of
young men have sown the seeds
for it by excesses and other
causes, but it can all be cured if
good judgment is used in time.
As the power lost is of the
nerves â nerve forceâ it can be
replaced by Electricity, the life
of the nerves.
"I could dance with joy when
I consider that I have been
saved from the necessity of liv-
ing the rest of my life in that
miserable state," says J. A. J.
Morse, Los Gatos, Cal., after
using Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt one month.
Have you not noticed how
many people speak well of Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt? "I
have heard a great many people
recommend your Belt," says a
recent letter.
It is the modern cure. It is
the only cure for weak men, for
medicine has long ago proven
its worthlessness. Dr. Sanden's
Belt gives new life, drugs sim-
ply benumb the crying nerves.
If you want life get Dr. San-
den's Belt at once. It will not
fail you. The little book,
"Three Classes of Men," is worth
$100 to any weak man. It will
be sent free by mail, sealed
closely, upon application.

THREE MASTERS
Detective Wood Goes Tues
day's Testimony One
Better. "
DECEPTION JUSTIFIABLE
Provided It Be by a Detective
Who Is Searching for
Truth.
CEITTENDEN SCORES WITNESS.
Whereupon Judge Slack Cautions Him
to Ba More Careful in His
Language.
The Ashley-Baldwin trial yesterday was
devoted to the cross-examination of De
tective Wood. Much of the time was
taken up with repetitions of Tuesday's
testimony and reading from the tran
script. In regard to Wood's employment
contemporaneously by several parties hos
tile to one another the interesting fact
was brought out that at one time he wa3
representing Colonel Pope, E. J. Baldwin
and Lillian Ashley and making each be
lieve he was doing the best he could for
him or her.
Deception and double-dealing seemed to
constitute the detective's art, to judge
from Wood's experience. He promised
Miss Ashley to prosecute her claim
against Baldwin. Under this pretense he
requested her to swear that she had never
been intimate with Colonel Pope, in order
to establish the innocence of character
necessary to be shown by a plaintiff in an
action for seduction. His intention, how
ever, was to secure Colonel Pope. Then
he wanted in the affidavit a statement
that Baldwin had ruined her. This was
to be used by Colonel Pope as evidence
against Miss Ashley's character in case
she should sue him for damages. The
only one of the three that he remained
absolutely true to was the amorous bicycle
manufacturer.
Attorney Cnttenden continued his cross
examination of Detective Wood yesterday
morning. He resumed his questions
about Wood's employment by Baldwin
and dis compensation for tne services he
should render. Wood brought with him
two assistants, Daniel J. O'Keefe, whom
he pays $3 a day and expenses, and
Emanuel Baines, who receives $1000 a
year. They are not doing active detective
work for Baldwin, but are waiting to give
testimony in the trial.
In regard to the employment of Wood,
the contract he had with Baldwin was
produced. By the terms of this con-tract
Wood was to bring with him to California
two witnesses to testify in the suit. They
were to pre Dare for the trial and secure
evidence and to bring all letters and testi
mony they were in possession of with
them. It was specified that Wood and
his men should 'not be tept away from
Boston more than sixty uays, and that
they were to have a week's notice before
being required to start. In the event of it
being unnecessary to come to San Fran
cisco the contract was to be null and
without force.
Baldwin had employed Wood while he
was still ostensibly acting for Mi.-s Ashley.
He admitted that he acted with the inten
tion of misleading her i;i order to ascer
tain the trutn, as he said. He had advised
her that to secure large damages from
Baldwin in an action for seduction she
must declare that she wa3 "as pure a girl
when she met Baldwin as when she was
born." Accordingly, Wood represented
to her that she must make affidavit that
ehe had never had intimate relations with
Colonel Pope, in whose employ, by the
way, Wood still was.
Thi3 much was in the interest of Pope.
Then he went as Miss Ashley's representa
tive to Baldwin to effect a settlement. He
saw Baldwin at Saratoga, but did not men
tion this to Miss Ashley when he wrote
her to send him written authority to nego
tiate a settlement with Baldwin. He also
inquired of her the lowest sum she would
take, and promised her "to endeavor to
get as much more than the amount named
as possible."
All this witnes-5 admitted he had done
to deceive and mislead the plaintiff. He
didn't remember whether he had sincerely
intended to settle her claim against Bald
win; come to think of it he believed he
had written the letter asking for authority
merely to put her off until he couid make
further investigations about her in his
"search for truth." All the evidence he
got in the Baldwin matter he intended to
make use of in case she attempted to make
trouble for Pope.
Before the noon adjournment Judge
SJack cautioned Attorney Crittenden tbat
he must be more careful in the way he
spoke about Witness Wood. Crittenden
cad asked him if he had not deliberately
written falsehoods in order to entrap Miss
Ashley, and was beginning to indirectly
score the detective quite roundly. This
was the second reproof his Honor adminis
tered to the attorney for the plaintiff, hav
ing censurea him for his tardiness in com
ing into the court nearly half an hour late
in the morning.
The afternoon session was delayed
again by Mr. Crittendeu's failure to "ap
pear at the appointed time. The cross
examination of Wood was resumed. Wood
admitted that when he went to see Bald
win he gave him to understand that he
had come from Miss Ashley with author
ity to settle her claim and told Baldwin
the amount he received.
Although he had no nope of makine a
settlement with Baldwin, he represented
to Miss Ashley that he had good pros
pects of settling.
"Then," said Mr. Crittenden, "you were
guilty of a deliberate attempt to cause her
to make an affidavit that would compro
mise and injure herself, without disclos
ing to her your purpose, and by using
language calculated to deceive her?"
Witness answered that to part of the
question he would answer yes and part of
it no.
"Did you believe you were acting
squarely toward her?" pursued, Mr. Crit
tenden. â
The witness declared he did so believe.
"Is it, then, customary in your business
to pretend to represent a party and, while
so pretending, to get from them damaging
and compromising evidence against that
party?"
The Court, however, ruled that the wit
ness did not need to answer the question.
"The uppermost thought in my mind,"
declared the witness, "was to get an affi
davit from her of what I have always and
do now believe, that Colonel Pope had not
beeD intimate with her. And I wanted
that affidavit in order to give Colonel
Pope an assurance that he would be no
further troubled by Miss Ashley, who had
harassed him, demanded money of him
and threatened to expose him."
In his endeavors to get affidavits and
other documents from Miss Ashley Wood
wrote her tbat he believed her statements
were true. Yesterday he declared he had
had his doubts when he wrote it.
"Then," said Mr. Crittenden, "you
wrote another falsehood to her?"
Judge Black again warned the attorney
in regard to the manner in which he spoke
cf the witness.
"if I am compelled to speak of this
matter again," said his Honor, "I shall
speak in a very different manner."
In his letter to Miss Ashley Wood
had declared his belief that Baldwin
would make a better settlement on the
spur of the moment than if he waited to
consult counsel. Yesterday Wood admit
ted that he had not so believed. He had
employed the strong wording in order to
get her to send him the desired affidavit.
He admitted that he bad studiously con
cealed from Mips Ashley the fa?t that he
had seen Mr. Baldwin. However, he had
received no money from Miss Ashley. If
he had received money he would have re
garded such action on his part as double
dealing and he would not have acted as he
did.
'â¢Then this whole letter you wrote Miss
Ashley," asked I>ir. Crittenden, "was a
tissue of untruths, written for the purpose
of deception, in order to get an unfair ad
vantage over Miss Ashley?"
Ouce more the court ruled that the wit
ness need not answer.
Detective Wood had no definite arrange
ment as to what compensation he would
receive from Miss Ashley in case she got
$75,000 out of Baldwin. Wood declared he
hardly thought of thatâ his main purpose
was to look out for Colonel Pope's witness.
However, he had not refused the offer
made by Miss Ashley to pay him liberally.
Mr. Crittenden cross-examined the wit
ness further on the testimony he bad
given in nis direct examination, but failed
to shake it in any essential particulars.
The witness is evidently thoroughly con
versant with all the matters he testified
about, for where he had to repeat accounts
given previously, the testimony on both
occasions was almost identical, even in the
language and expressions used.
Nearly everybody in the courtroom was
getting tired. The clerk was fast asleep,
with his head on the desK and bis Honor
had yawned wearily several times. Ac
cordingly the trial was adjourned until
this morning at 11 o'clock, when some in
teresting testimony is promised by those
who ought to Â£noÂ»v.
TO PAY PEOPLE'S BANK
Every Stockholder Who Still
Owes on Shares Will
Be Sued.
The Bank's New Attorney so Advises
and the Directors Adopt the
Suggestion.
The Board of Directors of the People's
Home Savings Bank will sue every stock
holder and director who has not paid in
the full amount of his shares, and the suits
will be pushed with vigor.
Such was the course decided upon at a
meeting yesterday, when the attorney for
the board had presented suggestions in re
gard to the many delinquents. There are
about 170 stockholders, and on many of the
shares there is still due the bank $66 66% a
share.
General John F. Sheehan, manager of
the affairs of the bank, asserts that recent
newspaper articles suggesting that the
present management has been responsible
for delays in the trial of test cases ema
nated from the opposition and were not
according to the facts. He mentioned, for
example, the Booth and Barnett case, set
last week, postponed to yesterday morn
ing at tne request of the defendants, and
again postponed yesterday until the 18th,
on the reauest of the defendants.
The attorney, who succeeded Mr. Flour
noy in the prosecution of the five test
cases, in his letter of suggestions on which
the board acted, says:
I desire to call your attention to the fact
that there are at least three classes of cases
which involve questions of fact and law.
The five cases now pending are actions
â¢wherein the defendants are sued Tjpon their
origiual subscriptions. Of course there will
be individual cases where stockholders will
claim certain equities and defenses growing
out of representations and acts urged to be
prejudicial to them committed by various
boards of directors. As to tnese nothing
need be noticed further.
It is, however, the fact that in addition to
the original subscribers who are now or nere
after to be sued there are two otner additional
classes whose defenses are Dot involved here.
First, those who have by assignment or pur
chase succeeded to the ownership of certain
shares of stock, and as to whom ttie question
of liability for tne unpaid subscription is to be
determined; and secondly, those cases In
which stockholders have, in anticipation of a
calling in of the unpaid subscriptions, and in
anticipation of the insolvency Of the bank,
made assignment to irresponsible persons as
against whom any judgment must remain un
satisfied.
1 would suggest in any event that suits
be brought which will determine the rights of
the board in both of these latter classes.
I desire, however, speaking generally, to call
your attention to the fact that in my opinion
any case, whether test or otherwise, will not
result in enforcing collection from others than
the mere individuals sued.
In the five cases now pending if judgment
â were rendered in all of them it could not, in
my opinion, secure payments from the other
delinquents. This must certainly be so in any
event until the Supreme Court hus passed upon
all of the questions involved. This could not
in all probability be done until the questions
as to the statute ot limitations would be
brought into ihe cases by reason of the delay.
I think that suits ought to be begun again-- 1
all of the stockholders and an earnest effort
made to collect these assets on hehaif of the
creditors of the bank. It might then be ad
visable, after such suits were brought, to se
lect a number as test cases, and thereupon to
stipulate that the judgments rendered in such
cases should be conclusive as to all questions
involved in the others.
This, it would seem to me, ought to be the
course to be pursued, but merely beginning
and carrying on five cases in the expectation,
without any agreement therefor, that other
delinquent stockholders will pay up without
suit is, in the light of experience in past
events, not to be expected.
A- to all the other litigations of the bank
you have been informed from time to time by
me. and no effort is being spared to obtain ad
judication in all matters. Very truly yours,
F. S. Stratton.

HELD TO ANSWER

Story cf the As

CORROBORATIVE FACTS.
The Prosecution Welds Together
Every Link of the
Chain.
NO DEFENSE IS OFFERED.
The Girl Unfolds a Startling Story
of Lewis' Boast to Her of His
Other Victims.
The preliminary examination of Wesley
T. Lewis, charged with criminal assault
upon Florence Heady, was concluded be
fore Jud^e Conlan yesterday and the
Judge held him to answer before the Su
perior Court in $20,000 bonds.
The girl told her story in a straightfor
ward manner, and during its recital the
defendant kept his eyes fixed upon the
floor. She told of her becoming acquainted
with Lewis at the Simpson Memorial
Church through both being members of
the Epworth League.
She detailed how Lewis called at the
Lincoln Evening School with the story of
Mrs. Goodall's illness and getting her ex
cused by Mrs. Deal, her teacher. Then she
detailed the incidents of the drive to the
Ocean Beach and the assault upon her.
After the assault he tried to console her
by telling her she was the seventh girl
who had been so treated by him. Two
were, like herself, pupils in the Lincoln
Evening School, and two were members
of the Simpson Memorial Church, one oi
whom he had assaulted in the belfry of
the church.
Attorney Wilson' for the defendant pro
tested against these statements of Lewis'
conversation, and after some argument the
Judge sustained the objection.
The witness went on to describe the
drive back to Ingleside and Lewis' second
attempt to assault her. She jumped from
the buggy and ran screaming toward an
other buggy occupied by George Thomp
son of the Olympic stables and a lady.
Thompson took tier into his buggy and
they drove on to see if they could tind
Lewis. He had fled and left the horse and
buggy standing by the side of the road.
Then Mr. Thompson drove her home.
Tne only question the defendant's attor
ney asked tne witness was: "It was a
pleasant moonlight night, wasn't it?'' and
she replied in the affirmative.
George Thompson testified to the girl
running to him for assistance. He made
a hurried search for Lewis, but failed to
find any trace of him. He took the rig
to the Ingleside stables and left it with in
structions to take an accurate description
of any man who should call for it. It
was about midnight when the girl ran to
him for assistance.
Thomas T. Taylor gave important testi
mony. He said" he was formerly a mem
ber of Simpson Memorial Church and
now lives at Fifteenth avenue and M
street. A few minutes after midnight he
was disturbed by the loud barking of his
dog. He got out of bed and on going out
side found Lewis standing at the gate.
Witness asked him into the house and in
the light he observed that his face was
flushed and he appeared to be very much
excited.
Lewis told witness that he had been
sandbagged and robbed, and he asked if
there was any way he could get back to
the City. Witness offered to drive him
into the City, and accordingly hitched up
his horse and drove him to the corner of
Golden Gate avenue and Market street.
As they parted Lewis told witness that he
worked for Simpson & Co. on Steuart
street, near Market, and asked him to go
to the scene ot the alleged robbery, and if
he found any letters or papers to take
them to Simpson & Co.'s office. The fol
lowing day witness called at the office, but
found that Lewis had not been there
within two years. Lewis was dressed in a
brown sack suit and wore a soft Fedora
hat.
After Dr. Daniel Kruger, 719 Larkin
street, and Policeman J. S. Adams gave
testimony tho prosecution closed the
case.
The defense waived the right to produce
testimony, and the Jud^e held the de
fendant to answer before the Superior
Court, raising his bonds from $10,000 to
$20,0C0.
THE MONEY OF HAWAII.
Minister of Finance Damon Says There
Is Plenty for All Pur
poses,
S. M. Damon, Minister of Finance in
Hawaii, arrived here on yesterday's
steamer. He accompanied Mrs. Damon,
who is going on to Yaie to attend the
graduation of her son. Minister Damon
will return to the islands in a few days.
He says the finances of the new republic
are in excellent condition.
"The loan that has been suggested and
that has passed the preliminary stages, for
$800,000," he eaid, "for public works of
various kinds, hus had $350,000 subscribed
to it already.
"Besides this, we have on hand from
various issues, or from what is known as
the loan fund, $115,000 more, so tnat now
we practically have $465,000 for public
works.
"We shall therefore have all that is
necessery for fifteen months for building
new roads to the coffee plantations, im
proving the harbors, erecting new school
housea and extending the water works.
The drain of $175,000 Jasl year, because of
the insurrection, took that much right out
of our direct receipts, but we paid it all
I without borrowing.
"Attorney-General W. O. Smith is in
China Btudying the cholera and black
plague. We recently appointed a medical
inspector in Yokohama, and General
Smith and Dr. Wood of the Board of
Health will appoint one in Hongkong and
onein Arnoy. This is done in order that
passengers for Hawaii may have medical
inspection. It is the intention of the
Government to protect the islands in every
possible way from disease."
POOLROOMS KNOCKED OUT.
Judge Wallace Sustains the Police
Court Decision.
Judge Wallace yesterday knocked out
the commission poolroom men. He af
firmed tbe decision of the Police Court in
tho case of James Bowlan, a clerk em
ployed by Goldtree & Co., who wa3 con
victed of misdemeanor for violating the
poolroom order.
The defense claimed that the money re
ceived was telegraphed to San Jose to be
placed, but Judge Wallace holds tin., to be
no defense, and although he wrote no
opinion the judgment of the lower court
was affirmed.

NEW YORK, N. V.., June 10.â Trading at the

Insurgents in t Ã¼ba, prices broke rapidly. The re
port proved 10 be unfounded. The engagement of
a small amount of go.'d for export to Europe was
used against the market.

case of the South westerns, grangers. Louisville and
Nashville, the Internationals, Pacific Mall and
Tennessee Coal and lion. The decline In prices
ranged from % to 3*4 per cent, Missouri Pacific
leading. In the late trading a steadier tone pre
vailed, the rumor that the President, nad sent a
message to Congress on Cuban matters havinc
been denied. Prices Immediately recovered i/ 8 @

The improvement, however, was not general, and

CHICAGO MAJIK.KTS.
CHICAGO, 111, June 10.â Preparatory to the
receipt of the Government to-day there was a gen
eral evening up in the wheat market and as the
lon* Interest was greater than the short the
process cost the price considerable a: the start, but
later when the offerings were about exhausted a
rally occurred, There was, however, no stability
ID the tone and no inclination to attempt a bull
movement. It was surmised that the Government
would be more conservative in Its figures on the
crop than have been the state bureaus ana that
theory was without doubt the main weakening in
fluence.
Liverpool cables were weak and %d lower. Re
ceipts in the Northwest were 354 cars against 373
cars last Wednesday ana 161 a year ago. Chicago
had 11 cars and inspected out llu,'c>Bs busueis.
Toward tr.e close the New York stock market
having become weak, wheat declined farther In
sympathy. Closing Paris and Berlin cables were
lower, and Antwerp unchanged. Expon clearances
were fair at 340.1.51 bushels.. July wheat opened
from 581,4 to 5734 c, sold between 58% a "d 57c,
closing ai 673/gc. %@ilc lower than yesterday.
Estimated receipts fur to-murrow, 18 cars.
CORNâ Nothing calculated 10 help corn prices
was heard, but, on the contrary, the information
was almost entirely of the kind that is welcome to
bears. Receipts were 161 cars over the estimate,
376 cars arriving. Liverpool cables were lower.
The principal reason for weakness, however, was
the heavy tone of the wheat market. Withdrawals
from store were 174,142 bushels. Export clear
ances amounted to 2-20,654 bushels. Active spec
ulative trading had gone from the July in:o the
September option. September corn opened at
28 %c, sold between 291/s and 28% c, closing at
28?/ B e, a shade under yesterday, .estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow, 500 cars.
OATSâ Were quiet aud presented much the
same appearance as corn. Buyers and holders
tin i no encouragement in the outlook and agree in
the opinion that an accident is the only hone they
have. Receipts were 188 cars and -28,617 bushels
were withdrawn from store, hxport clearances
amounted to 256,452 bushels. July oats closed
unchanged from yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 215 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 80@80%c; July,
81c asked; September, 81%@82c. Receipts were
14 cars.
PRO VlSlONSâ Averaged -weak. A heavy run
of hogs at the yards worked demoralization in the
market at that place. In the natural order of
things, product opened in an unsettled and weak
condition. Then: were buying orders in pork,
however, the execution of which helped the price
of that commodity, but lard and ribs were per
mitted to sink. Later, the demand showed some
activity, and Driers improved slightly, but
eventually earlier conditions again controlled the
market. July pot closed 5c higher, July lard
6@7y2C lower, July ribs 5c lower.
iiUTTERâ The butter market was active, but
lower. Supplies were liberal and the quality very
good. At the d-'lcine in price a steady
feeling developed. Creameriesâ Extras, 14y 2

THE STOCK MARKET
A Bad Break in Comstock Mining
Shares- ...;'"'
Yesterday was the liveliest day In mining stocks
for some years, and the market broke all to pieces
The opening was very strong at a general improve
ment over Tuesday's prices, dvi a decline set in
and becamp a rout on the noon Informal session,
at which time Chollar sold down to $2 70, a drop
of $1 05, under sales of 17,865 shares. Hale &
Norcross broke from $2 80 to $1 75, 6600 shares.
Fotos! from $1 85 to $1 30, 8060 shares, and so on.
the whole line going down.
The market was quie:er on the afternoon call,
and very unsettled, some stocks being nrmer and
others weaker.
Several theories are current In regard to the
break. One is that the outlook on the Brunswick
lode is getting poorer and another is that there
are internal dissensions among the Hale & Nor
cross managers and stockholders.
After the boar.l there was a slight reaction and
prices were somewhat better, but trade was dull
and the close was uninteresting.
The Cholinr assessment of 25 cents will be delin
quent In office July 14.
The HoÂ« mil Oold and Silver Mining Company
of El Dorado County has levied an assessment of
5 cents psr share, delinquent July 13.
The annual meeting 01 the Bodie Consolidated
will be held on Monday next, and Mr. West
heimer, who has already won the control of the
Bulwer Consolidated and Summit mines, expects
to get control of the Bodie Consolidated as well.
It is understood that the present managers of the
Bodie Consolidated are not making much of a
fight.

SIMPLY "CRUEL"
His Wife Is Granted an
Expurgated Decree
of Divorce.
QUIET, SPEEDY TRIAL.
Everything Was Arranged Be
fore the Judge Called
the Case.
IVERYBODY LÂ£T DOWN EASY.
The Doctor Gives Hous?, Alimony and
Children for Other Conces-'
sions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 10. f
The Crowiey divorce case is ended. Be
hind closed doors this morning the doctor
and his wife told their tales of marital
woe to Judge Frick, and when the doors
opened each was free to make a third at- |
tempt at proving that marriage is not a
chronic failure.
Mrs. Alma A. Crowiey was awarded the
homestead on Alice street till she shall re
marry, in which event the house goes to
the two minor children, of which she is
the custodian. The doctor is also to allow
her $125 per month and to pay her taxes,
insurance, and to keep her home in repair.
Dr. Crowiey profits in so far as his repu
tation is concerned, because the more
serious allegation of the complaint is de
clared to oe not proven and unfounded,
it is, hqwever, of record that he cruelly
hurt his wife's feelings, and on this ground
alone was the divorce granted.
When the case was called W. W. Foote
was allied with R. M. Fitzgerald in the in
terests of Dr. Crowiey. Judging by their
suavity and their evident desire to arrive j
at a speedy and mutually agreeable con- j
elusion, i t might be supposed that they i
were lifelong friends. Certainly there was j
notning to indicate that three days ago
the two men rent the Democracy of Ala- j
meda County in twain in the fiercest an â¢'.
most personal political fight ever seen in j
this hotbed of political strife.
The case was set for 10 o'clock, but up to
11:30 the plaintiff had not arrived, nor]
were there any witnesses about. This |
gave rise to the surmise that an attempt
was being made to settle without a trial.
After considerable whispered consultations
between counsel there was a conference
with the Judire, in which both sides at
tended, in his chambers. It wa3 reported
then that no testimony would be intro
duced on the charge of adultery, limiting
the case to cruelty.
When the Judge finally took the bench
he asked that all be excluded from the
room but attorneys and a stenographer,
and the court so ordered.
Counsel for the petitioner then intro
duced evidence to substantiate the charge
of cruelty.
Mrs. Crowiey testified to repeated acts of
cruelty of her husband, and was substan
tiatedby Charles Nuratti, a Japanese boy,
and Margaret Borland, both servants in
the family.
Tbe next question which arose was as to
the disposition of the homestead on Alice
street. Mrs. Crowley's counsel wanted the
home to be deeded to her, but the other
side objected, and finally W. R. Davis,
who appeared for Mrs. Crowlev, agreed
that she should U3e it tiil she remary, and
then it would no to the children.
After the evidence regarding cruelty no
attempt was made to substantiate any
other charge, whereupon Dr. Crowiey
offered to disprove the serious charges in
volving Mrs. A. G. Ainsworth, but the
matter was not gone into.
The decree will be worded so as to set forth
that the allegation regarding Mrs. Ains
wortb was unfounded. The disposition
of the case occupied but a few moments of
the court's time, and when the doors
opened another Oakland sensation had
gone into history.
VALUE OF AN EXPOSITION.
Merchants' Exchange in Doubt
Regarding the Advisability
of Indorsement.
Lait Year's Profits Piaced With a
Corporation Instead of With
a Charity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 10. f
During a meetine of the directors of the
Merchants' Exchange last evening, Fred
Sinclair, a local produce man, charged the
directors of last years' exposition with
misappropriating $1700. He claimed the
original intention i ad been to have tbe
proceeds go to a charitable institution,
and on that showing everybody united
and made it a great success. But wnen
there bad been a profit the management
incorporated and took the money as be
longine to the corporation.
George L. Fish, another member, said
there were some men in the Exposition
Association that he had no use for and at
the same time there were some very good
men in it who were not looking for per
sonal gain. As to the proceeds of the last
exposition being pledged to charities, he
knew nothing of it. He had been invited
to become one of the managers, but had
declined. In all fairness, he said, there
seemed to be a tendency in Oakland to cry
down any enterprise in which they were
not personally interested.
George W. Arper said that the exposition
was going to be a concern which would
help the city and county, instead of promo
ting individuals, and he believed it should
be encouraged. He thought, however,
that the scope of the exposition was too
narrow. He di â ! not believe the display
should be limited to the products of Ala
meda County. Such a course was a nar
row, contracted and unbusiness-like propo
sition. *
John A. Britton, one of the directors of
the Merchants' Exchange, who was absent
from the meeting, in commenting on the
mater to-day, said: "Our company (the
Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Company),
indorses the exposition directors in the
heartiest manner possible. We were with
them last year, and we will do all in our
power this year to make the exposition a
success.
Personally I have no sympathy with the
spirit sDown at last night's meeting, and
if it is to prevail I stiall ask President
Witcher to select another director to take
my Dlace. I lavor everything to advance
the city and cannot allow myself to be
placed "in any other position.
John T. Bell, one of the incorporators of
the exposition said: "Last year when the
project of an exposition of the products
and manufactures of this county was in
augurated certain members of the Mer
chants' Exchange board of directors did
all within their limited power to defeat
the enterprise. They failed, fortunately.
The exposition was successful beyond the
anticipation of its board of managers and
this city and county received in conse
quence an advertisement throughout the
East which it would have cost many
thousands of dollars to buy. When it
was thought best to quit with one exhibit
there was talk of giving the net proceeds
to charily, but there was such opposition
that it was abandoned and the original
idea to give annual exhibits was con
tinued."
The matter will be finally decided by the
Merchants' Exchange at a meeting to be
held in two weeks' time.

DOINGS IN ALAMEDA.
The J. A. Leonard Company
Wants to Find a Lead-
Pipe Thief.
The Board of Health Approves of a
Hospital in the CityâFra
ternal News.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jane 10.â The Joseph
A. Leonard Company and its plumbing
contractor, C. F. Fischer, are mourning
the loss of about half a ton of lead pipe.
The company is just finishing a row of
eight cottages on Clement avenue, near
Willow street, and the plumbing work was
nearly completed. Last night the thieves
made their way into the houses by win
dows and the use of skeleton keys and
stripped them of the piping.
The police are of the opinion that the
pilferers came from Oakland and rowed
across the estuary in a boat.
A Receiving Hogpital.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 10.â Some two
months ago two experienced nurses pro
posed opening a hospital on San Jose
avenue. The project was opposed and
those interested had an ordinance affect
ing the question introduced at the meet
ing of the City Trustees, who referred it to
the Board of Health.
The-e gentlemen approve entirely of the
hospital and have returned the ordinance
to tt.e City Fathers, as it did not meet
their approval.
The leading physicians say that a neces
sity exists for a hospital in this city, both
a3 a receiving hospital and one where
serions cases can be adequately treated.
Horiea Sink on the Track.
ALAMEDA, Oal.. June 10.â Contractor
Jansen, who is engaged in preparing the
new speed track for the Alameda Driving
Association, had an experience to-day
with his team that he is not likely soon to
forgot.
The land in question is barely above sea
level and high tides occasionally cover
half the area to be run on.
His team of six horses were scooping i
away the stuff this morning when one of
them almost disappeared into the mud be
low. It took the rest of the team and
quick work and strong ropes to haul the
horse out.
Horsemen are now wondering how solid
the ground is.

Brownson, president of McMinnville College, Oregon, stating that he would accept the

Second only in importance, so far as
Alameda County is concerned, to the
Superintendent Littlefield of the Corral Hollow Mines.
completion of the Central Pacific Rail
road in 1869 is the completion of the road
from Stockton to Corral Hollow, which
will be celebrated tomorrow in the can
yon near to the hollow.
The last rail will be laid to-morrow with
two golden spikes. There will be no grand
demonstration, but a simple formality in
the presence of a few members of the com
pany and a number of prominent people
from Stockton, Oakland, San Francisco
and Livermore. It is expected that the
guests of the company will be taken to
the mines behind one of the monster com
pound engines that have been constructed
specially for the new road. The laying of
the last rail will be celebrated with a grand
banquet.
"At the mines the machinery recently
shipped is to be put into position and
made ready for operation, and here the
great coal-bunkers are to be hurried to
completion for the reception of the out
put of the mines. The stet>l bridge across
the San Joaquin was completed a week
ago to-day. It is an immense structure,
the draw being 220 feet in length and
weighing nearly 250 tons. The temporary
trestle that has been in use ever since the
road was started will be taken out at once
so that river navigation can be resumed.
Although the directors are non-com
mittal on the matter it is believed that the
work on the big tunnel through the hills
w.ll be commenced before the year is out,
and that but a short time will elapse be
fore the road is extended to tidewater at
Oakland as well as Stockton.
In addition to the large coal mines, that
are said to contain enough coal to supply
the State for fifty years at the present rate
of consumption, there are also beds of clay
and reefs of limestone of proved excellence
and purity. These are largely used in the
manufacture of cement, and it is claimed
by experts that the materials found in
Corral Hollow will produce a cement that
is equal to the best imported and can be
manufactured for 80 cents a barrel. Promi
nent cement men are now negotiating
with the company for the sole rights to
manufacture cement and lime, and the
erection of large works for that purpose
will proceed shortly. There is also situ
ated upon the company's land a bed of
clay suitable for the manufacture of fire
brick and other refractory articles. A sand
for glass-making purposes is also found
there.
Speaking of the future of Corral Hollow
R. \V. Ellis, proprietor of the Livermore
Hearld, says: "With these tremendous
natural resources we would soon become
the richest State in the Union if we did
our own manufacturing and thus stooped
the tremendous drain of gold necessary to
pay for the manufactured articles we
import. The development of Corral Hol
low will alter this state of aftairs because
the coal can be mined at a price that will
enable the manufacturer to compete and
exist here. The great cry has been cheap
fuel. Old fogies and pessimists have
always declared that California would
never be among the manufacturing States
on account of lack of cheap fuel. This
restriction is now removed and manufact
ures will spring into existence, thousands
of skilled operatives will find employment
here and every artery of trade will share
the benefits of cheap fuel ana increased
population.
"A careful review of all the facts proves
conclusively that no single enterprise ever
inaugurated will have such a deep and
changing effect in the prosperity of the
State as the delivery of cheap coal at tide
water."
Will Be There Too.
LIVERMORE, Cal., June 10.â A dele
gation of prominent citizens of this place
will drive over the hills and be witnesses
of the final goiden-spike act of the Corral
Hollow Railroad to-morrow. They will
mingle their congratulations with the rest
of the people who will be there that the
road is co m pie ted.
Among those who will go are J. J. Mc-
Kown, G. W. Langan, H. H. Pitcher,
George Beck, N. D. Dutcher, F. R. Fassett,
Dr. J. W. Robertson, W. R. Ellis and A.

RETURNED HOME
TO MEET DEATH.
Captain J. N. Knowles Suc
cumbs to a Stroke of
Apoplexy.
ROMANTIC EARLY LIFE
For Many Years Was Com
mander of Famous Boston
Clippers.
ONCE LOST IN THE SOUTH SEAS
H3 Was the Trustee of the Merritt
Trust, and Complications May
Arise.
Oaklattd OrncE San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, June 10. j
Captain Joshua M. Knowles expired
suddenly at his home on Jackson street
this afternoon. Death was totally unex
pected, althougn Captain Knowles was
suffering from a severe cold. A stroke of
apoplexy, which came on about 1 o'clock^
rendered the captain unconscious, and
one hour later he died.
On Saturday last Captain Knowles
started for a trip to Alaska. Hardly had
the voyage commenced when the captain
was seized with a severe cold, which so
alarmed him that he ordered the steamer
Jannie, in which he was a large owner, to
return to port. The Jannie arrived last
night, and Captain Knowles came directly
to his home.
Captain Knowles has lived In Oakland for
many years, where he has been known as
a capitalist. He whs a stockholder and
director in the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, but his business has all been tran
sacted in San Francisco, and personally
he was very little known this side of the
bay in a commercial way.
The deceased was formerly a sea cap
tain ana was well known in shipping cir
cles. The last ship he commanded was
the well-known Glory of the Seas, which
is still afloat, and was the hundredth
vessel built by the Boston firm of Donald
McKay.
While on a voyage the deceased was
wrecked many years ago on an island in
the Soutn Seas. Owing to a defective
chart his ship K-as lost. Leaving a portion
of bis crew on the island he took tbe long
boat and went to Pitcairn Island, where he
buried $7000 worth of treasure. As there
was then very little communication with
tbe island Captain Knowles again set sail
and made Samoa. When he reached Ban
Francisco he had been given up as dead
and a partial administration of his estate
bad taken place.
The captain first came to this coast as a
consignee of several Boston ships and he
afterward became their agent. Still later
he was interested in a whaling company.
He settled in Oakland twenty years ago
and has lived in the old family home of
the Merritts, which he purchased from
tbe est'ite.
Mr. Knowles' wife and six children sur
vive him. They are: Mrs. Harry Gordon,
Mrs. H. H. Adams, and Hattio, Mattie,
Ruth, Alice and Thomas Knowles. Mrs.
Knowies and several of the children were
at tne bedside of the captain when he
died.
Captain Knowles was one of the trustees
of the Merritt estate, and Attorney Fred
Stratton said this afternoon that the suc
cessorship would depend upon the terms
of the trust deed. If the deed specified
that in the event of death of a trustee
some other person shall succeed to the
office then such a person must take the
vacant position. In the absence of such a
provision the Superior Court has tho
power to appoint tha successor. The
trust provided that $5m),000 in property
was to be held for the nephews, and from
this they were to receive their income.
The great defect of tho trust was that no
power was given to the trustees to sell in
the event of the property not proving re
munerative.
Captain Knowles was born in Massa
chusetts and was 66 yearn of age.
DROWNED IN THE CREEK.
Sirs. George McKenney Rescues Two

BOYS AGAINST GIRLS
Co-Eds Will Tell Why Cuba
Should Belong to Uncle
Sam.
Attention of Municipal Authorities
Called to a Brutal Assault on
Chinese.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 10.â One of the
features of the graduation exercises of the
Berkeley High School next Thursday
evening will be a debate between the girls'
and boys' debating societies of the school.
The girls have organized an Ecclesia of
debaters. The boys call their society of
forensics the Forum. In lieu of the usual
reading of theses the graduates decided to
have a debate and the girls' society will
try conclusions with the boys over the
question of the admission of Cuba into the
United States. The young ladies will con
ten d that if Cuba achieves her inde
pendence and is willing to come into the
Union she should be admitted, while the
boys will show why Spain's irrepressible
American dependency would be an unde
sirable addition to the domain of Uncle
Sam.
The debate will open with a "challenge"
by Miss Ella M. Bunnell, president of the
Ecclesia, which will be answered by the
prpsident of the Forum, J. L. Kennedy.
The debaters for the Ecclesia will be
Miss Margaret E. Doherty, Miss Elrna M.
Mansfield and Miss Mary T. Gallagher.
Carlton H. Parker, Erie C. Parks and
George O. Brehm will talk for the Forum.
Each debater will be allowed ten minutes,
five minutes being given to the affirmative
for a closing speech.
P. R. Boone, president of the Board of
Education of Berkeley, will preside. The
judges chosen to decide the contest be
tween the boys and girls are Colonel
Charles R. Green leaf, Rev. George B.
Hatch and Attorney W. H. Waste.
Brutalityfto Chinese.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 10.â The Rev.
George E. Swan, rector of St. Mark's
Church, has called public attention to an
outrage perpetrated upon three Chinese
last Saturday night. It appears that sev
eral roughs" attacked the celestials and
they had a hard struggle for liberty, only
escaping amid a shower of stones. There
was no apparent cause for the disgraceful
assault except malicious mischief.
"The outrage should receive the prompt
attention of our town authorities or, these
failing in their duty, of some of our citi
zens, said the Rev. Mr. Swan.
"The feelings of common humanity
should prompt us to resent this injury to
unoffending men, but if this motive is ob
scured then the preservation of the peace
and safety of our community and its good
name should move us to prompt action.
"If this outrage is to be allowed to
escape punishment others, and perhaps ol
a different character, may soon follow, for
nothing grows more quickly than wrong
and evil. The fact that such a public out
rage can occur unpunished at the seat of
California's culture and learning will not
commend us to the rest of California or to
the country at large."
Marshal Lloyd and his deputies are
working upon the ca*;e, but there is no
clew to the perpetrators of the outrage and
little chance of a capture.
Annual Report of Professor Hilgard.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 10.â The an
nual report for 1896 of the agricultural de
partment of the university has been pub
lished by the State Printer and is ready
for distribution.
It is a large book of nearly 500 pages,
liberally illustrated and containing elab
orate reports of the work done by the
different branches of tbe department, to
gether with many tables.
Much of the volume is devoted to ac
counts of investigation of diseases of fruits,
etc., and of the examination of different
soils.
In a letter of transmlttal to President
Kellogg Professor Hilgard calls attention
to the increased attendance of graduate
students in the lecture and laboratory
courses of his department, and expresses
the opinion that the overcrowding of the
professions of law, medicine and literature
will result in greater inclination on the
part of young men to engage in agricul
ture. "Agriculture requires qaite as much
brain work and intelligence as do the
other professions," says the Professor.
"Contrary to the poiicy defined and pur
sued by many United States and European
stations, 1 hold that it is the first duty of
our stations to minister to the pressing
needs of farmers on questions on which
their own experience and often existing
literature furnish them littie or no infor
mation.
"Scientific investigation of such ques
tions will almost invariably lead to the de
velopment of new facts and â¢principles,
which is one of the main objects for which
the stations were established,"
Enterprising Student Editors.
BERKELEY, Cal.. June 10.â The edi
tors of Olla Podrida, a paper published by

Spain has a novelty in the way of a sub
merged railway. It runs through the surf
off Oreton, near Bilbao, 650 feet out into
the ocean. The mines of Oreton are ex

bor there, and great difficulty has hitherto
been experienced in getting the ore to the
ships. Now that the submerged railway
has been built it is a simple matter.

WELCHED AND
FLED THE TOWN
Pool-Seller o'Donnell Winds
Up the Season With
a Coup.
MANY VICTIMS MOURN.
He Is Reported to Have Fleeced
His Patrons to the Tune
of $1500.
BIG ODDS CAUGHT GUDGEONS.
Not a Sign Left by Which to Tract
the Predatory Enemy of
Society.
Whenever fool men join issue with
downtown pool-sellers it requires no mind
reader or prophet to foretell the result.
The fool-man parts with his gold and the
pool-man takes it and departs. Some
times the operation is one long-drawn out,
but occasionally the parting and depart
ing is short and sharp and the fool-man
gets quicker "play for his money" than
even the average poolroom fiend desires.
Another instance of the latter character
has given Pauper alley habitues a bad turn.
Charles o'Donnell, who ran the pool
rooms at 27 and 29 Leidesdorff street under
the firm name of o'Donnell & Co. until 1
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, has, to use a
bull, "turned up missing." But no fears
of suicide or foul play aie entertained by
his friends and his more nubierous vic
tims, for with him also disappeared about
$1500 intrusted to him by his misguided
patrons who labored under the hallucina
tion that they might be able to beat the
"lead-pipe cinch"> combination under
which poolrooms are operated.
o'Donnell opened for business about
seven months ago, and as a bait for
'"suckers" gave a shade better odds than
his rivals. By this means he cultivated a
good business eventually, thoueh the
more cautious held off, as they were sus
picious of the liberal inducements offered
at this establishment.
It has been O'Donnell's custom, as it
has been that of the other poolrooms, to
open his doors at 8:30 a. m., remain open
until 1 p. m., then close until sp. m., and
Ai\\t up shop for the day at 6 p. m. or a lit
tle after. This was done to give color to
the fiction that the money bet by the
"fiends" was taken out to the racetrack
and there placed between the hours of 1
and 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
In accordance wich this programme
o'Donnell opened up on Tuesday morning
and the first step in the contemplated
slaughter of the innocents was manifest in
the odds offered, being even more liberal
than usual. As a consequence the busi
ness showed an increase over other days.
At 1 o'clock o'Donnell closed his place and
since then has not been seen by any of bis
former associates or patrons, despite the
fact that many of the latter have shown a
remarkable solicitude over his wherea
bouts and have made a persistent search
for him.
Five o'clock, punctual as time always is,
came around, and so did holders of tickets
of the o'Donnell brand. They hung about,
a little testy at first over the delay in open
ing the doors.
Then they became uneasy, and when
6 o'clock tolled alarm and anger were gen
eral among the impatient crowd. Gradu
ally t:ey dispersed, many still hopeful
that O'Donnell's absence was caused by
unavoidable circumstances, but most of
the o'Donnell ticket-holders were willing
to sell out at liberal discounts.
Yesterday morning quite a number of
the more sanguine were on guard at
O'Donnell's usual opening hour, but their
waiting resolved itself into a weary vigil,
yet o'Donnell came not.
Among those who got caught was a
rival pool-selier, who had taken his over
flow business to o'Donnell. He took the
situation philosophically, and was offering
$357 worth of O'Donnell's tickets for $30,
but found no taker.
Opinions vary as to the inspiration of
O Donnells sudden desire for seclusion
and obscurity. Some say that he was
forced to welch on Monday, and seeing
ruin before him, planned "and executed
the coup of Tuesday. Others say that the
scheme of robbery was nothing less than
a cold-blooded premeditated plan to fleece
the wary and unwary who are gullible
enough to play the races through the pool
rooms and that he cleverly chose the close
of the season for a grand clean-up.
GOLDEN GATE CARNIVAL
The Question of Finance Receives Con
sideration-Looking Forward to
the Fun.
The finance committee of the carnival
of the Golden Gate will be increased dur
ing the coming week by the addition of
some forty or fifty active workers, who
will proceed at once to canvase the City.
A special committee, consisting of Chair
man Soule, Secretary Doolan and J. H.
Mangels, will shortly visit the principal
;orporations and business houses with a
new of ascertaining now much each one
is willing to contribute toward the carni
eal fund. General Warfield and his corps
Df workers will proceed to district the City.
The City Guard band of San Diego is the
first musical organization to make appli
:ation for a position in the carnival
parades. During the recent tour of the
Hotel Men's Association the band went
through the southern part of the State
tnd also took part in the Cabriilo celebra
tion in San Diego and ail the fiestas in

CARRIER PIGEONS.
A Home Contest From Ashland, Or., to
California.
At 5 o'clock yesterday morning eight
carrier pigeons were set free at Ashland,
Or. Six of them were due at Alameda
and two at Vallejo at 3 p. m. yesterday.
They did not arrive at their destina
tions, and it is presumed that they have
been detained by high winds. The dis
tance between the points mentioned is 318
miles to Alameda and 293 miles to
Vallejo.
There will be a race on the 19th inst. for
medals given py the Santa Cruz Water

will leave Santa Cruz on the date men

accidents, make their destinations m two

SANITATION OF SCHOOLS
A Spirited Debate Over the Sys
tems in Three New
Buildings.
No More Raffles or Lotteries Will Be
Allowed at School Enter*
tainments.
The sanitary systems of three schoolsâ
the Bernal Heights, Harrison and Colum
bia â were the occasion of a spirited de
bate at the meeting oi the Board of Edu
cation last evening.
The plans and specifications for the
buildings called for the Morgan system,
but after the contracts had been drawn up
the agents of the Peck-Williamson system
offered to put in the closets for about $1000
less than tne Morgan system. An effort
was made to have the previous action of
the board rescinded, but the resolution to
that effect w as defeated.
The board adopted the following recom
mendations of the City Board of Ex
aminers:
That A. E. Kellogg be recommended to the
State Board for Hiph School grade of life
diploma, Miss Rose McGeough and Miss Frala
for grammar grade or life diploma, ami Miss
Marie Ruef and Miss Anna T. Croughwill
and Miss Josephine L. Miller for grammar
grade of State educational diploma; that Miss
Paulina Dworzazak, Miss firace Mitchell, Miss
Mona Brown, Miss Laura Brown and Thomas
N. Badger be granted grammar grade certifi
cates; that the grammar grade certifi
cate of Miss Helen B. Fairweather
and Miss Rose McGeough be renewed;
that primary-grade certificates for the follow
ing be renewed: Mrs. Mary L. Belding, Miss J.
A. Bigley, Miss Addie G. Cherry, Miss Ellen
Donovan, Miss Nellie E. Ewing, Miss M. E.
Flynn, Miss A. E. Franks, Miss J. E. Gerichten,
Miss Margaret O'Brien, Miss A. E. Ryan, Miss
A. E. Owen, Mrs. B. M. Peake, Miss L. T. Ryan,
Miss Maccord, Miss S. D. Burk; that Frank D.
Stringham be granted a grammar-grade certi
ficate, and that the graduates of the Normal
;-chool clags of 1891 be granted grammar
grade certificates.
Director Murdock presented a resolution
that was submit ted to the committee of
the whole, suspending for one year the
giving of all medals in the public schools.
This was done at the instance of teachers
and principals, who believe that the pres
ent system of awards is more injurious
than beneficial to the scholars.
The board ordered the Cooper Primary
School closed for the remainder of the
term in order to give the contractor, who
is making repairs, a clance to begin work.
The Harrison Primary School will be
closed on Wednesday next for the same
reason.
The following recommendation of the
Committee on Rules was adopted and or
dered incorporated in the rules of the
board :
That when permission is given by either the 1
board or the Committee on Rules for the hold- j
ing of any fair or other entertainment by any j
school it shall be with the express reservation |
that no raffle, lottery or like game of chance
Shall be held thereat or in connection there
with.
A resolution was adopted fixing the sal
ary of substitute teachers of night schools
at $20 a month, with $1 50 extra for each
night while actually engaged.
Under a suspension of the rules Mrs. M.
Seley was appointed to the third vacancy
in the evening substitute class.
Miss K. M. Ball was elected a special,
teacher of drawing.

shops of the town, started the Co-operative
Printing Company, all agreeing to lend
their best efforts to its success and share
in the profits of the venture.
All went well for a while, and the con
cern seemed to prosper, but somehow the
workers at the type-cases got very little
money out of it, and the list of bills re
ceivable daily grew longer. Finally the
printers concluded that they were playing
a losing game, and, after a receiver* had
been appointed, began suit for various
amounts, which they considered they were
entitled to. Eventually judgments
amounting to $4)0 were obtained.
H. H. Bancroft owed the co-operative
company $240, while the latter concern
was indebted to the concern of which
Bancroft is the head in a large sum for
materials furnished.
After the co-operative concern closed up
Bancroft is alleged by the printers to have
paid the amount due their company into
bis own concern, as an offset for their debt
to the Bancroft Company. This, they
claim, was illegal, as their claims for labor
take legal precedence over all other debts.
Attorney Monteith took out the judg
ments obtained yesterday, and within a
day or two will apply to the Justice Court
for an order of examination, and bring
Bancroft into court and show the nature
of the transaction.
The Robert* Kstate.
The will of Stephen N. Roberts has been
filed for probate and William Irwiu and Robert
McKay appointed administrators. The estate
is worth about $25,000, most of which is left
to relatives In New Hampshire.
Divorced for Neglect.
Marguerite LeUtner was yesterday granted
a divorce from John Leistner by Judge Heb
bard. Willful neglect was the ground.

Sammi Nuptials Last
Evening.
NOON WEDDING AT ST. LUKE'S.
Only Relatives Witness the Marriage
of Miss Alice Bonner and
Authur Pawson.
Army circles and society at large are
deeply interested in the engagement of
Lieutenant Coffin, the most popular man
of the Fifth Artillery, and Mrs. Minnie
Wood, widow of the late Captain Wood.
The engagement was announced yester-
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Sammi (Formerly Miss E. May Cogswell).
day, ana the lieutenant was kept busy all
day answering the many congratulations
which were fairly showered upon him.
Mrs. Wood is at present at the home of
her father, the Rev. Mr. Mansfield, at his
place near San Jose.
The bride to be is a petite brunette,
beautiful and accomplished, and deeply
admired by a large circle of society, as
well as army friends. Sne is musically in
clined. She sings beautifully and plays
equally well. She is also given to outdoor
sports, and excels especially in riding,
driving and rowing.
A more popular man than Lieutenant
Coffin it would indeed be difficult to find.
A brave soldier and jolly companion, no
function is considered complete without
him. The lieutenant has alway.s led the
army cotillons and has several times offi
ciated in the same capacity for the Friday
Night Cotillon Club. As an usher and
best man he has been especially in de
mand at swell weddings, and has officiated
in either capacity more than fifty times.
Lieutenant Coffin leaves to - morrow
morning for Canby, where he will be sta
tioned for the next two years. He will,
however, return to this City the latter part of
July, when his wedding to Mrs. Wood will be
celebrated at the home of her father, near San
Jose.
The wedding of Miss Helen Marvin Nicker
son, niece of Mrs. A. H. Lee, and Willard John
Parker, superintendent of the Occidental Rail
road at Guatemala, was solemnized last even
ing at the residence of the bride's aunt, 1415
Geary street. It was a pink and white wed
ding. Fragrant pink and white blossoms were
used with artistic effect in the adornment of

bay-window of the drawing-room, and here
the happy young couple stood while the Rev.
A. J. Wells performed the marriage ceremony.
The bride wan attended by Miss Helen Hurd,
a little miss of five summers, who officiated as
maid of honor, and T. L. Ely acted as Dest man.
The bride, a handsome brunette, was attired
in an elegant gown of cream-white crepe,
trimmed with chiffon and orange blossoms,
A feature of the wedding was the entire ab
sence of the regular customs observable at
bridal ceremonies.
At the conclusion of the ceremony which
made the happy young couple man and wife,
the fair young bride offered all present a tiny
goblet of sherry with which to pledge her
health. The sherry was poured irom a cut
glass decanter that has done similar Rervice
for the past 200 years.

THE SAMOAN CAME BACK
One Drainpipe Carries Away
and the New Deckhouses
Sprunk Aleak.
Prospect of Cargo Sprouting in the
Hold and Mildew in the Skip
per's Bunk.
The American barkentinc Samoan does
not appear to carry a protective cherub
sitting up aloft in the role of a marine
mascot, or at least the the small chap does
some deep sleeping on watch.
Last year the vessel, sailing under the
British colors, a bark rig and the name of
Sharpshooter, swung into a bit of a pale
on the Mexican coast that blew her flag,
rig and name clean out of her.
She was repaired, and last Tuesday she
returned to sea bound for Maryborough
with a cargo of wheat. Last night she
came back to port aleak.
When about twenty-five miles off the
Farralon Islands, durine a high sea and
heavy northwest gale, the pantry drain
pipe burst. It is not a large tube, but
when the barkentine rolled to that side
con siderable water went into the hull.
Added to this, the new deckhouse began
to leak when the water went aboard.
Captain Kustel tried to plug up the
drain-pipe and calk the deck, but could
not keep the water out.
It trickled into his cargo and dripped
into his bunk, and the prospect of reach
ing his destination with the wheat indus
trously sprouting in the told and the mil
dew crowing in his blankets was not allur
ing to the mariner. So he "wore-ship"
and returned to port, getting to anchorage
off Powell-street wharf last night about 6
o'clock.
Captain Kustel thinks that the leaking
places can be repaired in a couple of days,
when the vessel will proceed on her voyage.
A Royal House-
F. L. Turpin, one of our most popular
hotel men, having conducted tlie Capitol
House for the past eighteen years, is now
having very extensive improvements made
on the Royal House, 126 Ellis street, a
five-story modern brick building, a few
doors below the Y. M. C. A. building.
An electric elevator has just been com
pleted which runs from the office on second
floor, thus supplying a long-felt want.
The elevator is of tne very latest design,
tlie cage being made of grillwork, with
beveled mirrors on each side. It appears
to be one of the handsomest elevators.
A fact which will please the many
friends and acquaintances of Mr. Turpin,
whose accommodations were always taxed
to their lull capacity, is a six-story addi
tion to the Royal House.
The new building, which is now in the
course of construction, will cover a lot
40x60 feet, adjoining and connecting at
each floor with the Royal. All the rooms
will contain the latest improvements.
The entire buildine being lighted with
electricity and fitted with electric call
beils.etc, the Royal will be one of the best
appointed of modern rooming-houses. â¦
NUGGETS AND
VEINS OF GOLD
Thousands of Square Miles
Said to Be Teeming
With Them.
IN THE MOJAVE DESERT
Steady Influx of Prospectors
Into the New and Rich
Diggings. ,
LACK OF WATER A DRAWBACK.
Mountains Said to Be Literally
Streaked With the Auriferous
Quartz.
Gold in nuegets and gold in veins in
such profusion and obtainable over so
large an area as has never before been
known in all the rich and remarkable finds
of California and Australia is the sub
stance of reports from that section of Kern
County which lies a little north of due
east from Mojave, and about forty miles
distant from that city.
In this desert and hilly region placer
and quartz diggings are now being worked,
said George F. Weeks of the Bakersheld
Californian in Â«n interview in this City,
that for richness and extent exceeds any
thing previously recorded in the mining
history of the world.
Tne development of this region is said to
have only begun, yet it is known that the
auriferous deposits extend for at least
twenty-five miles, east and west, while its
latitudinal boundaries have not yet been
defined.
At the present time there is said to be a
steady influx of prospectors, including in
many cases entire families. Mojave's ho
tel accommodations are entirely inade
quate, notwithstanding that from three to
four stages leave there daily, full of pil
grims for the latest gold-hunter's Mecca.
From fifty to one hundred people depart
daily from there, and this human current
has been maintained for some time.
It has long been known that this region
i* a promising field for the prospector and
for mining operations on a large scale,
but the lack of water has heretofore been
an effective deterrent. This obstacle to
comfortable living as well as to profitable
mining has now been to a great extent
overcome. It is true that the nearest
point from the mineral belt at which
water is obtainable is twelve miles, but as
its use for placer mining is unnecessary in
view of the fact that "dry washing" is
very successfully carried on in this region,
it has been found practicable to haul the
necessary supply on carts in barrels.
Delivered at the mines water costs $2 a
barrel. Teams can haul half a dozen bar
rels at a time and can make two trips a
day. Eventually, however, it is expected
to utilize the water from the more distant
mountains, and it is proposed to bore
welis. For the latter purpose a well-bor
ing plant is now on the ground, capable of
drilling to a depth of 1700 feet. There is
the fullest confidence that water will be
struck long before that distance is reached.
Both at Mojave and in the mining sec
tion women and children as well as men
sleep out of doors without discomfort, be
ing forced to this course by inadequate
hotel accommodations and the lack of
tents in the camps.
One miner who had been to the diggings
but a short time was seen in Bakersfield
last week by Mr. Weeks with a buckskin
purse four inches long filled with cold
dust and nuggets, one of the latter being
worth $80.
The mining camp is in a section of
rather low hills, and the valleys between
are where the placer mines are being
worked. The valley tracts are apparently
the washings from the neighboring hills,
and the hills are said to be literally seamed
with the precious yellow metal. In some
cases veins can be traced from a hilltop to
where the valley and hill seem to join.
Here the vein disappears only to reappear
on the farther edge of the valley, where it
can be easily followed up the slope of the
next hill.
In these valleys the gravel and soil is so
devoid of moisture that it makes dry
washing not only practicable but exceed
ingly efficacious and profitable. The pro
cess consists of running the gold-bearing
gravel and soil over an apron lined with
quicksilver, the latter retaining the free
gold in amalgamation.
Rich quartz veins are said to be in sight
everywhere, though at the present time,
owing to tne lack of water, but three or
four mills of small capacity are in opera
tion.
In some portions of the camp the claim
monuments are so thick that from a dis
tance they appear like stakes in a vineyard.
In this connection the Bakersfield Cali
fornian in its next issue will publish the
following in its editorial columns:
Kern County is at present the scene of the
commencement of a mineral development,
which there is the best reason for believing
will result ere long in giving this region as
wide a fame as any mining locality in the
country and the building up of mining camps
of large proportions. Already mines are pro
ducing good results in the Aqua Caliente,
Randsburg, Goler and other "new" districts,
while in the older ones, such as Hnvilah, Keys
ville, Greenhorn, Kernviile, etc., development
of the most promising character is under way.
Every day almost notes the discovery of new
and rich mineral deposits of the most promis
ing charucter.
The amount of mineral-bearing territory in
this county is immense, covering as it does the
entire eastern half and extending overseverai
thousands of square miles.
The deposits thot have so far been worked
have been proved to be permanent and >f large
size, and the number is constantly being
adaed to.
But little attention has been paid outside
the county to these rich mines. The owntrs
have not sought newspaper notoriety, and as a
consequence mines ana mining camps that,
had they been exploited through the columns
of the press, would have caused an excitement
second to none, are scarcely known outside a
very limited circle.
That California, in common with the other
mineral-producing States of the West, is on the
eve of a big mining boom, cannot be doubted.
Every indicatiou points to that fact. It will
not be a wildcat boom, either, but one founded
upon the most solid basisâ that of permanent
and well-paying mines.
The Williams Cases Consolidated.
Judge Morrow decided yesterday that the
four indictments against Dick Williams, the
customs Inspector, should be consolidated.
An order to that effect was accordingly made.
The court held that as the charges were prac
tically the same the Government would be
saved a great expeuso by the consolidation.
Williams' attorney contended that such action
would be an injustice to his client, for the rea
son that the jury might take into considera
tion the old adage of smoke and fire. Judge
Morrow thought differently, however, and the
opinion as recorded was rendered.
Chosen Friends' Picnic.
The Order of Chosen Friends will give a pic

ceeds of this picnic will bÂ« devoted to mem
bers of the order who were injured iv the late
disaster at St. Louis. The order has 2800 mem
bers In St. Louis, and as many became home
less and houseless, while a good many are in
jured, it is expected that over 1000 people will
attend the picnic.
