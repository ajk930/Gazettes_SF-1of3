Advance of Macdonald's Column To

Defeat Denied.
PARIS, France, March 20.â 1t is ru
mored this evening that the reserve squad
ron at Toulon, Brest, I'Orient and Cher
bourg have been ordered to hold them
selves in readiness to be placed on a war
footine. It is also rumored that France,
under the coaching of Russia, will con
vene an international conference to settle
the question of the powers of the Egyptian
debt commission and the evacuation of
Egypt. It has been founa impossible to
confirm either rumor, but it was semi-otii
cially announced this evening that the
active squadron at Toulon had received
orders for one of the cruisers to keep
steam up.
There liss been no change in the politi
cal situation here since yesterday. The
Temps, commenting upon the resignation
of the Foreign Office portfolio by M.
Berthelot, says that if the recent foreign
policy was not a success, the change has
been insisted by Prime Minister Bourgeois,
who is an able parliamentarian but an in
experienced diplomat. Therefore, M.
Bourgeois in the Foreign Office will possi
bly be more dangerous than was M.
Berthelot. France must know who leads
ami wlit re she is led.
En the Chamber of Deputies M. Bruent
and Da Lafosse, and in the Senate M.
Bardeaux, have notified Prime Minister
Bourgeois that they will to-morrow inter
pellate the Government on the situation in
Egypt
M. Poinraire, ex-Minister of Finance,
will also to-morrow question the Govern
ment in the Chamber of Deputies on the
resignation of M. Berthelot and on the for
eign and general policy of the Govern
ment. The debates will be important and
the defeat of the Government is possible.
The Figaro publishes an interview with
M. Berthelot, in which the ex-Foreign
Minister defends his actions while in tne
Cabinet, especially in respect of Siam and
Madagascar. M. Berthciot claims he held
the French flag as it should be held.
BERTHLOT MADE A SCAPEGOAT.
Jiourgeois Charged With the Authorship
of the Egyptian Xote.
LONDON, EMS., March 29.â The Graphic
will to-morrow say it regrets the resigna
tion of M. Berthelot. It adds that he sin
cerely sought the friendship of Great
Britain, and that the French tactics re
garding Egypt probably originated with
his colleagues in the Cabinet.
The Standard's Paris correspondent tele
graphs that M. Berthelot was made a
scapegoat, though it is believed that 1L
Bourgeois was the a athor of the Egyptian
note, which had its origin in his diplo
matic defeat. The Standard will to-mor
row publish a dispatch from Vienna say
ing that Russia's disapproval â¢of the
French Cabinet's handiingof the Egyptian
matter was the principal cause of M.
Berthelot's resignation.
The Times to-morrow, commenting on
the situation in France, will say there is
no difficulty in seeing that misconceptions
of Egyptian affairs are being extensively
used in Paris as weapons in purely domes
tic struggles.
DERVISHES FIRED UPON.

CAIRO, Egypt, March 29.â General

staff, arrived at Wady-Halfa to-day. The
second column of the expedition, under
Major Macdonald, is approaching A kasheh.
Sixty Dervishes reconnoitered the column,
but were fired upon by the artillery,
whereupon they rapidly retreated.
The report of the defeat of the Egyptian
advance guard by Dervishes near Aka
gheh turns out to be untrue.

Lives.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 29.â At a meet
ing of the leaders of the Autonomist party,
held here to-day, it was decided to take no
part in the approaching election of mem
bers of the Chamber of Deputies, but to

Colonel Molina reports the capture of a
rebel camp at Guasinial, near Corral Falso,
Province of Mat&nzas. The troops at
tacked the camp with machetes. The
rebels fled, leaving behind them forty-tive
dead. Many of their wounded were car

of Ballington Booth Held in
New York City.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 29.â Major
Pattie Watkins, who had been ill for some
days and who said she was threatened
with pneumonia, presided at a meeting of
the American Volunteers, over whom Bal
lington Booth has assumed command, at
the Cooper Union Institute this evening.
Miss Watkins was clad in her new uni
form, which is of cadet blue material.
The gathering was very large.
A meeting of the followers of Ballington
Booth was also held to-night at the West
Fifteenth-street Tabernacle. The hall was
crowded with the followers of Ballington
Booth, and the greatest enthusiasm was
displayed when his name was mentioned.
J. W. Merrill, who was formerly staff
captain of the Salvation Army, presided at
the meeting. Evangelist P. M. Meinsin<:er
of Brooklyn made an address, saying that
Ballington Booth had a divine work to
perform and that he should be supported.
The name of Ballington Booth's new pa
per has not yet been determined upon.
Major J. M. Allen, who came over on the
steamer St. Louis with Mrs. Booth-Tucker,
presided over the meeting at the Salvation
Army headquarters in Fourteenth street.
Mrs. Tucker was said to be quite ill. It
was reported that if she is able she will ac
cept the invitation of Ballington Booth to
meet him at his home in Mountclair, N.
J., on next Tuesday. A meeting of the
staff officers will beheld at Philadelphia
soon, at which either Mrs. Bootu-Tucker
or her si3ter, Commissioner Eva Booth,
will be present.
PROSPECTIVE LYNCHING.
The Perpetrator of a Terrible Crime Is
Strongly Guarded.
CROWN POINT, Ixd., March 29.â 1t is
very probable that the Crown Point jail
yard will be the scene of a lynching party
before morning. Albert Knauss, a farm
hand working for Nicholas Haan, a pros
perous and wealthy farmer living live
miles south of this place, attacked Mrs.
Haan while her husband was away from
home. He then kicked the woman into an
insensible condition, and it is extremely
doubtful that she will recover. Knauss
was apprehended and jailed yesterday.
Sheriff Hays has placed the jail under a
heavy guard.

Consul-General to Mexico and once Gov
ernor of Missouri.
SUCCUMBED TO FRIGHT.
Four Patients in a Burning Paris
ian Hospital Are Scared
to Death.
Sappers Mistake Drugs for Schnapps.
Four Dead, Others Suffering
Intensely.
PARIS, France, March 29.â The Gothic
Church of St. Sauveur, on the boulevard
de Marechal Vaillant, at Lille, was de
stroyed bp tire this morning. The flames
spread to the hospital adjoining the
church, and there was great excitement
when it was seen that the hospital would
be burned. The scenes among the pa
tients were terrible. Those who were con
valescent were hurriedly directed to leave
the building, and the hospital attendants
and others devoted themselves to remov
ing tt.o.se who were nut able to help them
selves.
The cries of the sick were heartrend
ing. Four of the patients, who were
extremely weak, succumbed to fright and
died before they could be taken out. Many
of the sick were received in the convent of
the Little Sisters of the Poor, which is
situated but a short distance from the
scene of the lire.
Ten sappers, who had been ordered to
save the medicines in the hospital, came
across what they thought was a quantity
of schnapps, i'liey each took a drink, and
were almost instantly seized with symp
toms of poisoning.
Physicians at once attended them, but
despite all efforts four of the sappers died
and the others are still suffering agonizing
pain.
It was not until. 7 o'clock this evening
that the fire was mastered. It was caused
by the neglect of some plumbers who had
been employed in the lower part of the
church, and who had either left a burning
brazier or dropped a piece of ignited char
coal.

Social Berlin Is Exercised
Over the Killing of

THE DUEL AT POTSDAM.
Triumph of a Lieutenant Who
Had Wrecked the Law
yer's Home.
SHOTS EXCHANGED FOTJR TIMES
The Surviving Principal Has Surren
dered and Will Be Placed
on Trial.
BERLIN, Germany, March 29.â The
story associated with the duel fought last
Thursday between Lieutenant yon Ketteis
hodt, an officer attached to the imt>erial
yacht Hohenzollern, and Herr Zenker, a
prominent Berlin lawyer and anti-Semite
leader, in which the latter was killed, is
of absorbing interest in social circles,
where the affair is being discussed in
detail. Lieutenant yon Kettelshodt ob
taiDed permission to remain in Germany
when the Hohenzollern started for Genoa,
and it was known among his friends that
his remaining behind was for the purpose
of fighting the duel. Herr Zenker was a
lawyer of large practice and very wealthy.
He married a charming woman, by whom
he had two children.
In the summer of 1894 Frau Zenker met
Lieutenant yon Kettelshodt at Laboe, a
seaside resort near Kiel, and their ensuing
unconcealed friendship aroused Herr Zen
ker's jealousy to so great an extent that
his wife left him is August last and went
to Detmold, taking her two children with
her. Herr Zenker then set to work to find
proofs of her undue intimacy with Lieu
tenant yon Kettelshodt. As Zenker was a
lieutenant in the Landwehr he was en
titled to demand a duel.
The challenge was accepted by yon Ket
telshodt, who, according to his right, chose
the weapons and the terms of their use.
The challenged officer named pistols, Doth
principals to fire until one should be dis
abled.
Several naval officers accompanied yon
Kettelstiodt from Kiel to Potsdam, near
which place the duel was fought. Herr
Zenker wore the uniform of a lieutenant
in the Landwehr, and his brother, a
physician, watched the fight. Shots were
exchanged four times, yon Kettelshodt's
fourth shot piercing Zenker's heart. Yon
Kettleshodt immediately surrendered him
self to a superior officer and will stand
trial.
The episode has greatly touched public
feeling, there being, even in army and
navy circles, a fceline of sorrow at Zenk
er's iate, and the affair will undoubtedly
lead to a widespread agitation against
dueling, too strong for the devotees of the
code to withstand.

Three Persons Killed and Two Injured
by a Rolling Stone.
HINTON, W. Va., March 29.â Three
people were instantly kiiled and two others
seriously injured at Echo, a mining town

ovens and railroad tracks, and finally
crashing through a small frame dwelling
house, with the above result. The killed
are: Jim Tillman, Frank Tillman and
Lucy Law. The names of the injured
could not be learned. Henry Law, an oc
cupant of the house, rushed out and
flagged an eastbound express train, which
was just due, and would have probably
been derailed by the ruined condition of
the track.

TERRIFIC WINDSSORM.
Two Women Kille<l and Several Injured
at Cl*rrlÂ«ud, Ohio.
CLbVP:LAND, Ohio, March 29.â A ter
rific windstorm, lasting only two minutes,
sprung up about 2 o'clock Sunday morn
ing and created considerable havoc during
its brief existence.
A tew days ago lire broke out in the six
story Kirnball block, on Cedar avenue,
leaving the walls in a totteriny condition.
The storm blew the walla down upon the
dwelling of H. A. Vaughn, 745 Cedar ave
nue, and crushed in the roof, instantly
killing Mrs. Sarah Bradford and Miss
Emma Dietrich, who were in bed asleep.
Mrs. Bradford was asleep in an upstairs
room over the kitchen, on the side next to
the falling wall. The debris crushed upon
her and carried the woman a:id bed down
through the heavy timbers of the floor to
the kitchen below. Five other people
sleeping in the house were injured.
To-night at 8 o'clock the people in the
vicinity of the Kimball block ruins were
thrown into a panic by the fail of another
section of the fire-blackened walls. After
a hurried but complete investigation it
was ascertained that no other buildincrs
had been damaged nor further personal
injuries sustained. At this hour the front
wall, six stories high, is standing without
any support whatever, and a brisk and in
creasing wind is coming straight against
it from the lake. Should it fall outward
the damage to other buildings will be
great; but people have been warned, and
there should be no one hurt by its fall.

MUTILATION fOF THE DEAI>.
Their Faces Covered With Grass,
Which Is Then Ignitedâ '
Sent to the Police.
CAPETOWN, South Africa, March 29.â
A late dispatch from Buluwayo, the prin
cipal town of Matabeleland, said that it
was feared an attack would be made on
that place to-nijrht by the native rebels. A
riisp atch received to-day from Buluwayo,
said that thus far twenty whites have
been killed by the natives.
Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of
Cape Colony and High Commissioner in
South Africa, has cabled Colonial Secre
tary Chamberlain in London that Captain
Nicholson telegraphs from Buluwayo that
he has 350 rifles and plenty of ammuni
tion. Captain Nicholson believes tnat the
revolt will not spread.
Tne only detachments of the native
police who are known to have certainly
deserted are thirty, who shot Commis
sioner Bently. Another thirty were very
restless and were disarmed, after which
they deserted.
Several of the white settlers, who were
missing and who were supposed to have
been massacred by the natives, have ar
rived at Buluwayo.
Governor Robinson has furnished b
mounted escort to convey 500 rifles be
longing to the British South African Com
pany from Mafeking, on the Transvaal
border, to Buluwayo.
Among the victims of the Matabeles was
a family consisting of husband and wife,
three grown daughters and three sons.
Commissary Bently and other persons
massacred were horribly mutilated. After
death their faces were covered with dried
grass, which was then set on fire, render
ing the features of the victims unrecog
nizable.

BITTER TO WARD GLAND.
Excitement Reneterd at Berlin Became
of the irannvanl Situation.
BERLIN, Germany, March 29. â The
changed situation in the Transvaal has
reawakened the excitement against Eng
land. On all sides the preparations which
the Boers are making to resist England's
encroachments are approved. The con
sensus of opinion in the German press is
that the denial made by Mr. Cha,niberlain
that England had purchased Delagoa Bay
was too vague to suffice, and it is pointed
out In support of this view ihat Mr. Cham
berlain had denied that there had been
negotiations between Great Britain and
Portugal looking to sucn purchase. The
National Zeitung says:
''England cannot suppose that the friend- ,
liness of the German empire toward the
Dongola expedition implies a pledge that
she will remain passive in South Africa."
The Hamburg Correspondenz officially
declares that Germany will adhere to the
declarations made in the Reichstag by
Freiherr Marschall yon Bieberstein.Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, that Germany will
not permit German interests to be en
croached upon.
The Taegliche Rundschau asks: "Has
Germany built up an empire through
blood and iron only to look on while a for
eign nation is setting the German nation
at naught?"
The Weltpolitik says: "The people are
standing before the choice whether to be
the hammer or the anvil. They cry out
that they must be the hammer."
The Vossische Zeitung urges the Gov
ernment to propose that the powers neu
tralize Delagoa Bay and keep the Trans
vaal independent.
An Anti-Boer Propaganda,
LONDON, Exg., March 29.â 1n its issue
to-morrow the Chronicle will denounce
the demand that is growing in certain
English newspapers in favor of sending a
powerful expedition to South Africa. The
Chronicle ascribes the demand to an anti-
Boer propaganda that is being pushed by a
ring of capitalists.
THE CATHODE RAY CHEATED.
Needle Extracted From the Breast of a
Convict Who Swallowed It Forty-
Two Years Ago.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 29.â A simple
operation performed in the hospital of the
State Prison this afternoon ends a most
interesting surgical and pathological his
tory. Prison Hospital Surgeon Tharp re
moved from the body of James Morris, a
Federal prisoner, serving a term for coun
terfeiting, a needle which was swallowed
by the patient when he was a boy 11 years
old. As he is now 53 years of age the
needle has been in the body forty-two
years.
In that time it has traveled undoubtedly
through nearly every part of the body be
low the waist. He has made several ap
plications to have the needle removed
since he has been in the prison, but it
could not be located with sufficient ac
uracy. Not long ago it was in his right
knee and he claimed he could feel the
point of it. He suffered great pain from
it all the time. To-day he felt the point of
the needle projecting from his breast just
below the heart. It was an easy matter to
remove it. It was the intention of the
prison physicians to use the cathode ray
in searching for the needle if it had not
been found so soon.

ARMENIA'S PLEA FOR AID
The United States Evangelical
Alliance Recites the Woes
of the People.
Intervention Not Asked For, But ihe
Exsrcise of Moral Pow^r by
the Nations.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 29. â The
Evangelical Alliance for the United States
has issued an appeal to the people of this
country in behalf of the sufferers by the
recent Turkish massacres in Armenia.
The document also contains an appeal
from the missionaries. It states:
"An appeal of the most solemn and
impressive character has just been re
ceived, signed by the entire force of the
American missionaries at Harpoot, in the
Turkish empire, imploring sympathy and
moral influence in behalf of the persecuted
Armenian Christians in that empire. The
Aliianee would b2 untrue to its constitu
tion and its history if it did not give earn
est heed to this memorial. It has taken
immediate measures to secure favorable
action from the Sultan of Turkey by the
Government of the United States and by
the various branches of the Alliance
throughout the world.
"In addition to these efforts, the Alliance
herewith spreads before the people of this
country the document received from the
Christian missionaries at Harpoot.
"Does the Christian world know that
this has been and is a clearly defined re
ligious crusade? It is part of the Moslem
creed that men of all other creeds are in
ferior, and the Christian races in this
country have always been treated as such;
and now that the Armenians have sought
for some equality of rights, for greater free
dom from oppression and injustice and for
the protection of person and property, the
Turks have sought to crush them.
"We do not ask for intervention but for
the exercise of such a moral power by the
nations as shall free the poor Christians
from this intolerable yoke. We are con
fident, that if thn representatives of the
Christian governments in Constantinople
were to unite against any further attempt
to renounce the faith which their fathers
have held in the midst of persecution and
oppression from the days of the apostles
to the present time with a persistence al
most as marvelous as that of the Jews,
such a protest would be effectual."

PORTLAND, Or., March 29. â Mrg.
Hiram Smith and family of Coburg are
the innocent victims of an unknown per
son's hatred and live in daily fear of
death. Repeated attempts have been
made to poison the woman and her chil
dren, and of late the would-be poisoner
has grown bold in his attempts. It is be
lieved he is crazy or has a mania for mur
der.
This person visited the Smith home last
Thursday and left some kind of powder on
the top of the jars of milk. Mrs. Smith
does not know what the powder was, but
believes it was the kind of poison used to
destroy rats and squirrels. On this visit
the poisoner left two notes of threatening
character. On the afternoon of the next
day he again visited the premises and put
another kind of powder on the cream in
the pantry. This substance was of a whit
ish color, looked like soda and tasted like
concentrated lye. On this yisit another
notice was left, as follows:
The ones we want to kill is Hiram Smith,
L. Smith, Mary Smith, Clara Smith. I am
coming again. This is done by one you will
never know. God is building the lire for you
now, d you.
On the days that this note and the poison
were left, Mrs. Smith and her two little
girls were alone at the farm, the young
men â Leet and Hiragiâ being absent on
business. Judging from the tone of the
note it appears that the unknown desired,
to take ttie lives of the four orphan chil
dren who live with Mrs. Smith.
Yesterday (he family persecutor again
gained admittance to the premises unseen
by any one and scattered poison ab.mt the
well and in waterins-troughs and in the
grain bin. Thwarted thus far in his efforts
to take the lives of the family, the myste
rious individual now seems determined to
poison the stock on the ranch.
The family lives in constant terror, not
knowing what minute its property may
be destroyed or the lives of its members
taken by. the unseen enemy. The case
has been placed in the hands of officers.
Mrs. Smith is the widow of the late
Hiram Smith, a man who was quite
wealthy and prominent in social and
political life. He owned large tracts of
land below Coburg and at one time was a
candidate for Congress. He has been
dead for a number of years. Mrs. Smith
ia now 78 years old, and lives on a farm
about four miles below Coburg. She has
no children of her own, but adopted four
children who were orphaned by the death
of another adopted son. The first attempt
to poison Mrs. Smith was made about tea
years ago. _______^^_____

more wholesome,
more beautiful, more completely pleasing
than a womanly woman ? Such a woman
is even tempered, intelligent, strong and
healthy. Health really tells the whole
story. Health means strong nerves and
strong bod)', and they go far toward
bringing good looks and amiability.
A woman worn and wearied by the
dragging weaknesses peculiar to her sex,
cannot be expected to find zest in any
duty or amusement. Life is all one dead
monotonous gloom to her. On her face
is written the story of weakness and pain.
The wholesomeness of health is lacking.
The cheeks lack fullness, the eyes laclc
sparkle, the hair lacks luster.
Doctors have learned to locate nine-
tenths of womanly sickness in the organs
that ought above all others to be strong
and healthy.
Sensitive women shudder at the
thought of consulting a physician on
such matters. A natural feeling of mod-
esty makes them dread the examination,
and subsequent stereotyped treatment by
"local applications" on which most
doctors insist.
Much more often than not, this is un-
necessary. It should not be submitted
to except as a last resort.

Genoa and Naples Give the Imperial
Party an Enthusiastic
Greeting.
BERLIN, Germany, March 29.â The im
perial rarty in its visit to Italy Ifl accom
panied by a large ami distinguished suite.
Among tho>e attached to the Emperor are
General yon Flessen, Colonel Engelbrecht
and three aids-decamp; Admiral yon
Senden-Bibran, chief of the Emperor's
marine staff; Count yon Eulenourg, grand
marshal of the court; Baron yon Kiderlen-
Waechter, German Minister to Denmark
and a close contidanp of the Kaiser, and
Dr. Luitpol-i. Among the attendants
of the Empress are two chamberlains and
two ladies of honor, and the young Princes
are accompanied by three tutors.
Court Pastor Drysander is also with the
party for the purpose of officiating at the
religious duties of holy week and Court
Painter Bohrdt will make sketches of the
coasts of Italy and Sicily, which will after
ward be produced in pictures commenio
:u'ive of the trip.
Leaving Naples on March 31, on board
the imperial yacht Hohenzollern, the Em
peror and Empress, with their suites, will
sail for Palermo. They will sojourn five
days in Sicily and sail thence to Venice,
where a meeting wiil take place between
the Kaiser and King Humbert, the com
munications between Prince Hoheniohe,
the German Chancellor and the Marquis
di Ruaini, Italian Minister, in regard to
the presence of the German Emperor in
Italy, having resulted in the two nion
archs deciding upon having a conference
alone. Queen Margherita will accom
pany King Humbert and will receive the
Empress. During the three days of the
stay of the imperial party in Venice the
King and Queen of Roumania will join
the imperial and royal party. After the
interview between the Kaiser and King
Humbert the Emperor will start for
Vienna, where he wiil be joined by Prince
Hoheniohe.
The official pres? has received instruc
tions to rumiir.ize the importance of these
conferences and to state that Prince Ho
heniohe in going to Austria for the pur
pose of attending the marriage of his
niece, and that his meeting with the Em
peror here is a mere coincidence, the im
perial visit to Austra and the marriage of
the Chancellor's niece being synchronous
events. It is impossible, however, to di
vest the Kaiser's trip of the important
fact that his Ma jesty will meet successively
three monarchs who are his alliesâmeet
ings which certainly have some signifi
cance. It is believed here that the
conferences do not relate to a renewal of
the Dreibund, that being already secured,
but rather to the Kaiser's policy toward
Russia, whose successful diplomacy in
Bulgaria ana dominance of Turkey have
created feelings of great anxiety at the
Austrian and Roumanian courts, to the
Kiny of Roumania especially, that mon
arch being somewhat uneasy as to the
prudence of his entente with the Drei
bund, in view of Russia's attitude.
The enthusiastic reception given to the
Emperor in Italy is largely due to his own
tact. Previous to his arriving in Genoa
his Majesty ordered the band of marines
on board the Hohonzollern, which was
awaiting him at Genoa, to give a concert
for the benefit of the Italian soldiers who
were wounded at the battle of Adowa, in
Abyssinia, the entertainment realizing a
large sum. The Kaiser also directed
Prince Henry of Prussia to visit the
wounded who were being treated in the
hospital in Naples the day before he him
self arrived there, and another concert
will be given by the Marine band in
Naples, where the Emperor's popularity
has readied a phenomenal intensity of en
thusiasm.
SOCIALIST CELEBRATION.
Seventieth Anniversary of Liebknecht' a
ISirth Observed.
BERLIN, Germany, March 29.â The
seventieth birthday of Herr William Lieb
knecht, the Socialist leader, was celebrated
to-day with unusual ceremony, the cele
bration being participated in by all of the
Socialist deputies in the Reichstag, theSo
cial^t members of the Berlin municipality
and the officials of the Socialist party.
A grand banquet was held, at which 150
covers were laid, and the chair in which
Herr Liebknecht sat was garlanded with
roses. The Socialist group in the Reich
stag presented tneir venerable leader with
a bronze votive medal inscribed, "To their
senior, Wiihelm Liebknecht, on his seven
tieth birthday, from the Socialist Demo
crats in the German Reichstag." Herr
Singer toasted Herr Liebknecht as "a sol
dier in the struggle for the liberation of
humanity," and compared their dignified
celebration of his natal day with the war
jubilee and drunkenness of the German
bourgeoisie.
The Vonvaerts urges the Socialists and
the working people generally to celebrate
May day prudently and calmly, and only
to cease work on that day where it is pos
sible to do so without a danger of collision
with the authorities and the employers.
The lone of the article is a vast advance in
moderation as compared with the old cry
of a universal strike demonstration.

DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES
Oliver Pike Killed Because He
Knew of Murders in
an Asylum.
Similar Fate of His Companionâ They
Were Clubbed to Death Three
Years Ago.
CHICAGO, 111., March 29.â According
to the story of William Doriot, who ar
rived in Chicago to-day, Oliver Pike, the
young man who was found in a trunk iv
Austin Thursday night, was beaten in the
head three years ago by men who thought
he knew of murders said to have been .
committed in an asylum at Steilacoom, a
village but a few miles distant from Se
attle.
He came west from Fulton, 0., at the so
licitation of a schoolboy companion, Sha
dle, who was then superintendent of the
asylum at Steilacoom. Pike worked at the
asylum for many a year, when of a sudden
he packed his gripsack and went to work
for a laundry.
During this time the young man, who
was an eye-witness to many outrages at
the institution, wrote letters to his mother,
who lives at Fulton, Ohio, in which he tola
in detail the unnatural scenes he had be
held at the asylum.
It is more "than three years ago that
young Pike ceased to write letters to
Ohio. When his silence elicited inquiries
from the old homestead his school com-
panion wrote to the missing boy's mother
that he feared that Oliver had been killed,
because of his knowledge of the crimes at
the asylum.
Young Pike died in February, 1393. In
March of the same year his companion
vanished mysteriously. He, too, knew of
the gruesome work at the asylum.
When a description of the dead man
found in the trunk by the two Germans at
Austin was printed in the Cincinnati
papers, Doriot, who is quite old and who
had marveled at the silence of his nephew,
was convinced that the cadaver was that
of Oliver Pike.
FATAL FIRE IN NEW YORK
Three Persons Suffocated and
One Leaps to Her Death
From a Window.
A Fireman Knocked From a Ladder
While Attempting the Rescue
of Two Women.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 29.â four
persons were killed and two injured early
this morning in a fire at 374 Hudson
street.
The buildiDg is a three-story brick house
used for dwelling and Btore purposes.
The upper two floors sheltered four fam
ilies. The dense smoke deterred some
of the tenants from descending the stair
ways. Miss Margaret Ryan, sixty years
old, with a companion, Miss Kate Hig
gins, ran to a window. A fireman in as
cending a ladder to rescue the woman was
knocked off by a burst of flame shooting
from a second-story window and was
badly injured, l'he women then became
hysterical. Miss Ryan leaping from the
window.
She fell on the sidewalk, breaking her
back, and died on the way to a hospital in
an ambulance. Her companion fell out of
the window and broke her leg.
The nremen could not rescue everyone
in the building, owing to the immense
quantities of smoke. After the fire had
been extinguished three bodies were found
of people who had been suffocated. They
were Mary McMahon, 22 years old;
Thomas Mallory, 23 years old, a fireman
on the steamer St. Louis, and Archibald
Grogan, 35 year? old. Their bodies were

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1896.
BUTCHERY IN AN
OHIO VILLAGE
The Most Atrocious Crime
in the History of the
State.
DONE AFTER MIDNIGHT.
An Aged Couple, Two Daughters
and a Hired Man Are
the Victims.
CLTJBBED AND KNIFED IN BED.
Awful Story of a Girl Who Escaped'
The Community Franticâ Trailing
With Bloodhounds.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 29.â At 1
o'clock this morning the most fiendish
deed that has ever claimed entrance to the
criminal history of Ohio wag perpetrated
near Tallmadge, a village five miles north
of Akron.
Alvin Stone, aged 69, and his wife, aged
C>2, while asleep at their home, were bru
tally murdered by a fiend, who literally
beat their heads to pieces, after which'
numerous knife- thrusts were made into
the bodies of the dead; Two daughtersâ
Hattie, aged 29, Emma, aged 27, and the
family man-servant, A. F. Stilson, were
also attacked. All three of these are
fatally injured and lie unconscious and
bleeding at the home, awaiting death.
They had been beaten about the head with
a blunt instrument, which of itself must
have been large and of great weight.
Alvin Stone and his wife were members
of the wealthiest and most prominent
families in Northeastern Ohio. The object
of the murderous assault on the family
was not robbery, as numerous articles of
value, including the two gold watches of
the aged couple, which were on the bed
room dresser, were not taken. The crime
is shrouded in mystery and the whole
county is agitated. The only suspicion
as yet rests on one John Smith, who is
employed at Edward Parker's blacksmith
shop, near the Stone homestead, on the
Kent road. Smith was discharged by
Alvin Stone two weeks ago. The former
was a chores man about the place. The
two men had very angry words, and Smith
departed in great anger. He is now under
police surveillance.
One member of the family alone escaped
injury â Flora, the youngest daughter,
aged 16. She is laboring under intense
nervous excitement, but was able, between
tears and hysterical sobs, to tell what she
knew of the affair. The old folks, she said,
occupied a chamber on the lower floor.
Hattie and Flora slept upstairs, Emma
across the hall, and the hired man at the
rear of the hallway on the same floor. At
about 1 o'clock this morning Flora says
she heard an agonizing scream from
Emma. She jumped from bed and open
ing the door started to cross the hall.
Hattie followed her. Flora, turning be
fore she entered Emma's room, the door
of which was open, saw a masked man
strike Hattie over the head with what
looked like a crowbar. Hattie with a
groan fell senseless to the floor, while
Flora in terror ran back to her room and
hid under the bedclothes. â 
Hattie, who is a woman of remarkable
vitality, despite her frightful injury, arose,
and, going into Psora's room, asked her
to throw something over her head. Flora
was too frightened to move. Hattie left
her room, and, entering that of her sister,
noticed the window was open and that a
ladder reached up to it from the ground.
She wrapped a quilt around her and went
down the ladder, running to Charles Sack
ett's farm, a quarter of a mile away,
where she told her story and collapsed.
Two of the Sacketts hurried to the Stone
house, while another summoned a physi
cian. When they arrived the house was
pitch dark. The side door was open. En
tering the room occupied by the old folks,
they were confronted by the horribly
mutilated bodies of the father and mother.
Emma was found unconscious on the
floor of her bedroom. She bad been
struck a fearful blow over the forehead,
and still lies as one dead. The hired man
was found in his room in the same condi
tion. He had also been struck over the
forehead. Flora was found under the bed
clothes in speechless fright.
In a few minutes the whole neighbor
hood for miles around was aroused and
hundreds assembled about the Stone
homestead. The rage of those who for so
many years had lived with and loved the
amiable, honest Stone family knew no
bounds. The Akion police department
was' notified and Detective Dunn, Marshal
Mason, Sheriff Griffin and First Deputy
Hart hurried to the scene. They arrived
at 9 o'clock. They found what appeared
to be tracks of a man leaving the siaedoor,
which was found open, and ending at the
road. The rain which had steadily poured
all night had, however, obliterated the
tracks along the road. Bloodhounds were
were put into service, but they could do
nothing owing to the rain.
The impression seems to be that Smith
is not the right man and committees are
organizing this evening to scour the coun
try in every direction. From all the in
dications of those who are starting to hunt
down the murderer it is idle to attempt a
forecast of what will happen if he is cap
tured. There is but one fate in store for
him if he falls into the hands of the citi
zens who are looking for him, aided by
bloodhounds.
This evening a strong clew leads toward
Ravenna, where a strange horse and bug
gy was left by an unknown man who
acted very suspiciously.
GROWING EXCITEMENT.
Young Smith* Innocence Is Established.
An Important Clew.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 29.-In Ak
ron, Kent. Cuyaho^ra Falls, Tallmadge
and the surrounding territory, the excite
ment over the atrocious murders at the
latter place grows apace.
Young Frank Smith, who was held in
surveillance by the police, was released at
Tallmadge to-night. This deepens the mys
tery. Smith was subjected to a time-hon
ored and awesome ordeal. Accompanied
by the police and townsfoiks he was
brought to the Stone homestead and con
fronted with the appalling sight of the
mutilated dead.
The young man did not qnail. Tears
came to his eyes and he asked in a voice
of pathos that touched all the beholders
of the scene: "Could you people who have
known me for years think me guilty of
the blood of these good old people?"
His employers and others testified that
he was in bed at the time of the murders.
It was the consensus of opinion among
the police and villagers that Smith was
guiltless and he was set at liberty.
The United Press reporters in making in
vestigations among the neighbors to-night
unearthed a clew which may eventually
throw light upon the crime.
It was ascertained that some three years
ago Aivin Stone was mainly instrumental
in bringing to justice a horsethief, who
had plied his nefarious vocation in Tall
madge. The thief was sentenced to three
years in the penitentiary. It is said by
the neighbors that he threatened that
When released he would nevsr rest until
his vengeance on the Stone family was
satisfied. His name is Anton Strong.
Descriptions of the suspect have been sent
out broadcast. The Cleveland department
has been notified to loot for him. Ly.ich
ing is uppermost in everybody's mind.
NOT TO BE RECALLED.
False Sews Telegraphed From Const an
tinople to London.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.â The
Turkish legation to-day received the fol
lowing telegram from the Turkish Minister
of Foreign Affairs:
The news telegraphed to the London Times
about the Turki-m legation of Washington be
ine false you may contradict it.
.The above undoubtedly refers to the dis
patch from Constantinople to the effect
that Mavroyeni Bey, the Turkish Minister
to this country, and his secretary were to
be recalled.
WORK BEFORE CONGRESS
Matters for the Consideration of
Both Branches During
This Week.
Believed the House Will Agree to the
Senate Resolutions on the
Cuban Question.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2!).â lt is
expected that consideration of the sundry
civil appropriation bill will be the first
business of the House this week. The
radical changes made by the bill will
doubtless cause much discussion, and sev
eral days may be spent over it. The re
duction of the appropriation for continu
ing contracts on river and harbor work
and public buildings in course of construc
tion to a basis of eight months' operations,
on the theory that the remainder of the
year can be provided for at the next ses
sion of Congress, will be attacked by the J
Democratic members of the Committee on !
Appropriations. Other provisions not so
radical will also be the subject of criti
cism, but no serious addition to the total i
carried in the bill is anticipated.
When the sundry civil bill has been
gotten out of the way, Hitt will call up
the conference report on the Cuban ques
tion, which recommends that the House
aeree to the Senate resolutions.
The coming week in the Senate will be
devoted to the consideration of appropria
tion bills and routine businees. The bill
to approve the compromise between the
United States and the State of Arkansas,
which has been the unfinished business
for two weeks but which has not been
passed, will be considered to-morrow.
There appears to be little hope of ita pas
sage, and there likewise appears to be a
disposition to devote to-morrow only to its
consideration.
The postoffice bill will be laid before the
full committee to-morrow and an effort
made to report to the Senate during the
day. If this is done it will be called up in
the Senate Tuesday.
The Indian and naval bills are btfore
the Committee on Appropriations, and it
is believed that the Indian bill will be re-
Dorted before the week is out, although
the House's action relative to the appro
priation" for Indian schools is likely to
cause some debate in committee.
After the postoffice bill is disposed of
the Senate will probably renew the dis
cussion on Cannon's resolution, directing
the Secretary of the Interior to obey the
law opening the Uncompahgre Reserva
tion to settlement. This, several days ago,
was made the unfinished business after
the Arkansas matter should be disposed
of.
The bill to protect fur seals from exter
mination is demanding attention, and an
effort will be made to get it up. The re
mainder of the week will be probably de
voted to consideration of bills on the cal
endar.
FOR CALIFORNIA MINERS
They Will Be Well Provided
For by the Fifty-Fourth
Congress.
Good Work of Representatives Her*
mann of Oregon and Hooker
of New York.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.â The
miners of California are to be well taken
care of by the Fifty-fourth Congress. The
San Joaquin is to receive the aid sought for
it by Major Corcoran and others who came
to Washington in its behalf, and the Sac
ramento and its navigable tributaries are
to receive extended aid. Among other
items, the Committee on Rivers and Har
bors has agreed to recommend the appro
priation of $250,000 for the construction of
constraining works for the protection of
the Sacramento and Feather rivers, as
recommended by the California Debris
Commission.
It is also proposed to create a Sacra
mento River commission, to take charge
of the Sacramento and its navigable
branches and thus provide for scientific
and methodical treatment of those rivers,
in fact, California will fare better at the
hands of the present Committee on Rivers
and Harbors than for many years past
Although California has no member on
the committee she has a loyal and active
friend in Representative Hermann of
Oregon, who has been a member of the
committee for many years, and who has
been largely instrumental in securing the
splendid recognition which California has
received. The chairman of the commit
tee, Mr. Hooker of New York, has also
shown decided friendship for California.
The committee expect to make their final
report on Tuesday in the shape of a river
and harbor bill in the usuai manner.
ROBERT KNEERS' RELEASE.
Due to the Fact That a Subordinate
Judge Suppressed Evidence.
BERLIN, Germany, March 29.-The
action of the high court at Leipsic in
quashing the conviction of Robert Kneebs,
the American horseman who was recently
tried on the charge of "ringing 1 ' the mare
Bethel under the name of Nellie Kneebs
on the German trotting course, was due to
the fact that the court found that fifty-one
witnesses, chiefly Americans, had tendered
their testimony to the defense and had not
been heard by the lower court. The high
court, therefore, quashed the judgment
against Kneebs and ordered a new trial,
pending which time Kneebs will remain
in prison.
IOWA'S GOVERNOR
TALKS ALLISON
Says There Is No Doubt
of His Nomination for
the Presidency.
M'KINLEY'S PROSPECTS.
The Ohioan Will Lead All Other
Candidates on the First
Few Ballots.
THEN LOOK FOR A STAMPEDE.
The Hawkeye Senator, Being Every
body's Second Choice, Is Bound
to Win.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 29.-Gov
ernor Francis M. Drake of lowa came on
to New York yesterday afternoon
after the successful launching of the
battleship called after the State of
which he is at present the Executive.
When asked about the prospects of Re
publican Presidential candidates in the
West, and particularly whether McKinley's
ultimate strength would be as great as it
now seems probable that it would be, the
Governor replied :
"I think McKinley will lead all other
candidates, not only on the first ballot,
but also on the second and third ballots.
After that I think his strength will begin
to recede, and the nomination will pass to
Allison."
"Then you think there is no chance of
the nomination of McKinley on the first
ballot?" asked the reporter.
"Not the slightest," said Governor
Drake. "A good many delegations which
have already been secured for McKinley
have been got by hustlingâ"
"Manipulation?" interrupted the re
porter.
"Well, in a sense, you might call it
that," replied the Governor. "I am
convinced that the prevalent feel
ing of the States west of the Mississippi
is in favor of Allison, though the dele
gates from Minnesota, Nebraska and South
Dakota have been secured for McKinley.
But as soon as they give him a ballot or
two they will break up and leave him.
"One great chance that Allison has of
getting the nomination is that he is every
body's second choice. Every one knows
that Allison is fur sound money and lowa
i has already passed sound money resolu
tions."
"What do you mean by sound money ?"
asked the reporter.
"Well, I mean that we shall use all the
silver which it is possible for the Govern
i ment to redeem in gold, but no more.
JWe have already reached the limit,
|of silver coinage which it is
| possible to keep at a par with
gold as it is.Â» I have no doubt but
that the Republican National Convention
I will adopt a sound-money platform in ac
! cordance with the views which I have just
expressed."
"\Vhat about the silver States?" asked
the reporter.
"They will cut no figure in the next Re
publican convention, " said the Governor
somewhat contemptuously. "The free
silver Republicans will go over into the
Populist camp and leave the field clear for
sound money delegates to be sent to the
Republican National Convention."

St. Louis, Mo., March 29.â Democratic
conventions were held yesterday in five
counties of Missouri and each of them
passed free silver resolutions. In Madison

his newly acquired reputation as a successful
duck hunter and that we greatly regret he has
not given more time to waging an unsparing
war upon the flocks of threatening and dan
gerous mallard, sprig, teal and canvasbacka,
Â»iud less time to co-operating with foreign
money-lenders for increasing the bonded in
debtedness of an already overburdened people
by additional issues of interest bearing bonds
payable only in gold.

principles of our great party and honoring the
immortal name of its father in the manner
most agreeable to themselves, the President of
the United States, the Cabinet, Democratic
Senators and members and many distinguished
leaders have been invited to accompany the
officers and executive committee of the
National Association of Democratic Clubs la
an excursion to the tomb of the great apostle

At Monticello an address will be delivered by
ex-Governor Russell, one of the most promi

CONVICTS MUTINY.
Warm Reception to the &eii> Warden of
Kentucky's Penitentiary-
FRANKFORT, Ky., March 29.â There
was a mutiny in the Frankfort peniten
tiary yesterday, but it was promptly sup
pressed by Warden Neil. He resigned
from the Senate a few days ago to accept
his new position, and assumed charge of
the penitentiary yesterday.
The 1180 convicts selected yesterday as
an opportune time to overawe him, but
they failed utterly. When the prisoners
came out for rollcall yesterday morning
they Looted and cried and several fights
with bricks and knives obtained from the
chair-factory took place. Then two women
convicts engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand
encounter.
Marshal Blair, a desperate negro, at
tempted to head the outbreak. He was
seized by the guards and taken to the
Warden's oihee. He was impudent to
Warden Neil and refused to allow the
guard to tell his story. Warden Neil
thereupon ordered him soundly thrashed.
This weakened Blair. The news of the
Warden's action spread, and the dining
room, which had been a scene of disorder,
became quiet at once.
To add to the excitement of the day
Warden Neil discovered that William
Shearer, one of the night guards who had
charge of the female department of the
prison, had been guilty of a serious of
fense. He was at once discharged. He
was appointed only two months ago.

TRAGEDY IN ARKANSAS.
An Insane Man Brains His Wife
and Child and Cuts His
Own Throat.
Failing Health and Visions of Family
Distress Had Unbalanced His
Mind.
ROGERS, Ark., March 29.â One of the
most horrible tragedies ever enacted in
this part of the country occurred at the
home of Pulnski Duckworth, five miles
west of this place, about 10 o'clock this
morning. Duckworth, who was an honor
able and respected citizen, and who had
always shown extreme love and care for
his family, while temporarily insane,
killed his wife, fatally wounded his five
year-old daughter and then cut his throat,
dying instantly.
He struck his wife two blows with the
blade of an ax across the forehead, laying
her skull wide open. The woman seemed
to have been struck first while standing.
The blow struck near the center of the
forehead and ranged downward.
The second blow took effect also in the
forehead and ranged diagonally across,
indicating that she was struck after falling
to the floor. The murderer then plunged
the bloody ax into the scalp of his five
year-old girl, laying her brain bare.
Leaving his victims writhing in their
blood, Ducksvorth went intoanother room,
and standing by me bed, cut hi* throat
with an ordinary pocket-knife, the blade
being exceedingly dull. Both jugular veins
were severed and death resulted imme
diately.
The little girl is vet alive, but her death
is expected at any hour.
The family consisted of Duckworth, his
wife, who was about to again become a
mother, and two little girls, aged seven
and hve years respectively.
The elder of the little "girls, on her re
turn from Sunday-school, was horrified to
find the bodies of her mother and sister
lying on the floor and writhing, and with
out looking for her father she ran to the
house of a neighbor about a mile away for
assistance.
For some time Duckworth had been de
spondent over his failing health. He had
just passed the meridian of life, his
strength had given way and he feared that
he would soon be unable to provide for his
family. He brooded over this until his
mind became unbalanced, and rather than
see his loved one? suffer the pangs of hun
ger he committed the awful deed.
GROWING TREASURY DEFICIT.
It mil Jicach Ten Millions A.oor<s car
lisle'a Estimate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.â
With two days of March Jeft, the Govern
ment receipts for the month have only
reached $24,000,000. They are not likely
to exceed $26,000,000 for the entire month.
The low receipts have been very disap
pointing to Treasury officials, who have
been trying to persuade themselves that
business, which is reflected in Government
receipts, was materially improving. The
deficit for the year to date is $18,000,000.
In April heavy interest payments come
due, and at the present ratio of receipts
the deficit at the end of the riscal year may
approximate $27,000,000. Secretary Car-JOHNSON DEFIES
FRESNO'S WRATH
The Evangelist Returns to
the City Despite All
Warnings.
THREATS AGAIN HEARD.
Indignation Runs High When
His Presence Is Made
Known.
DEPUTY SHERIFFS IN CHURCH.
Authorities Guard Against a Demon
strationâAngry Meetings on
All Sides.
FRESNO, Cau, March 20.â Fresno was
on the verge of another uprising to-night.
Evangelist Johnson, who a few evenings
ago was requested by a committee of citi
rens to leave the city ami never return,
came in from his rural retreat this fore
noon and participated in the services at
the K-su.-t -i Methodist Church to the ex
tent of offerin- up :i prayer. The public
had settled down to the conviction that
the community was fairly rid of Johnson,
and, therefore, little attention was paid to
the rumor yesterday that he would at
tend and take part in the services to-day.
Johnson availed himself of this calm.
Depnty sheriffs were distributed through
the audience during the services, but all
passed off quietly and orderly. Few
persons aside from the membership knew
of Johnson's presence in the city, so that
up to 7:30 o'clock no demonstration of
any kind was made. But this evening
there were angry mutterings, and John
son's name was coupled with threats in
every place where men congregated. Not
until the evangelist retired to the home of
some parishioner and the lights in the
residences began to disappear did the
excitement subside. Even Johnson's
friends pronounce his course in returning
as foolhardy. If any violence is done all
agree that he would be wholly to blame.
Rev. George Mcrse of Pasadena, who is
a wealthy champion of Johnson's cause,
preached the sermon in the church this
forenoon. The official board of the
K-street Church, wherein Johnson pro
claimed his libel on the daughters of
Fresno, published an address to the public
in this morning's Republican. It isatem
perate and well-worded document. It
deprecates the unfortunate affair, and
claims that its authors were the very rirst
to brand Johnson's offensive statement as
false and that further consideration of the
offense was under discussion when the af
fair reached the public through the press.
There were no personal signatures to this
address.
Johnson, it is learned, had been hiding
on iieorge Church's ranch about three
miles southeast of town.
STANFORD VS. BERKELEY.
Schedule for the Intercollegiate
Baseball Games Has Been
Arranged.
An Erroneous Report That Lange
Was Coaching California's
Players.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal.,
March 29.â The schedule for the intercol
legiate baseball games between Berkeley
and Stanford was arranged to-day at a
conference between Managers Bernard P.
Miller of Berkeley and Watson of Stan
ford. One game will be played on the
grounds of each college, and the third on
neutral grounds â at San Jose if possible.
The schedule is as follows : April 22 or 24,
game- on the Stanford grotinds; May 2,
on Berkeley grounds; May 8, at San Jose
f possible.
In order to accustom the teams to the
grounds of their opponents, each will play
a game on them with some outside team.
A game will be arranged between Berke
ley and Santa Clara College for April 18
on the Stanford grounds, and Manager
Watson will arrange a game with either
the Reliance or the university club' 3 team
to be played on the Berkeley grounds in a
few weeks.
Great interest is being shown in baseball
here. The men are practicing faithfully
and are in fine form. Several interesting |
games will be played within the next few j
weeks. On Saturday the Vanity will meet I
the California team, composed of ex-Stan
ford and Berkeley stars, under the cap
taincy of "Jack" Sheehan, Stanford '96.
This team recently defeated Berkeley,
ln-v On April 17, junior day, the '97-'Â£Â»9
baseball talent will try conclusions with
a team chosen from '96 and '98. The game
will be very exciting as the teams are
evenly matched.
Tne published report that "Bill" Lange,
the famous outfielder of Chicago's team of
'95, ana a resident of Oakland, is engaged
in coaching the Berkeley team, is erron
eous. Lnnire was at one time negotiated
With by Berkeley to serve as their coach,
but the negotiations fell through for finan
cial reasons. Money was raised at Stan
ford by Dopular subscription, and Lantre
was secured as a coach for the Stanford
team, and spent thiee weeks at Stanford
in that capacity. Lange never coached
the Berkeley team, and is at present
practicing with the Chicago tearo at Gal
veston, Tex.
During the three weeks' coaching by
Lange the team mad*' great improvement,
and his departure for Galveston was much
regretted by the players. He is active,
patient and" a skilled player, and imparted
much of his own activity and earnestness
to the team. Captain Mc.Laine is follow
ing the methods and suggestions of Coach
Lange to good advantage, as shown by the
improvement of the team.
MURDER AT FAIR OAKS.
â i Japanese Kills and Buries One of Ilia
fount m. .
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 29.â Fair â 
Caks colony, settled this winter near this
cry by General Howard and others, has
.rcied its first crime. Last Tuesday
ni:ht a' Japanese named Lakauye killed
oie of his countrymen with an ax and
bu-ied him. The trngedy was not known un
til'o-night, when Lakauye was brought to
'hi city by one of his countrymen and
tuned 'over to the officers. He admits
ttia he killed.and buried a man Tuesday
n 'F t, but says the latter went to his" room
and tried to murder him with an ax. He
was rounded, but got the ax - away from j
his assailant and killed him. Then he
buried him and went about his work next
day. The Coroner will have the body ex
humed to-morrow.
TEMPLETON ELOPEMENT.
Mrs. Minnie Nelson Leaves Her Husband and
Children and Flees With a Trav
eling Musician,
TEMPLETON, Cal., March 29.âConsta
ble F. G. Till man of Salinas Township has
offered a reward of $50 for the arrest of
Charles Paulson and Mrs. Minnie Nelson,
who eloped from this city on March 23.
That the flight of the couple was accom
plished in true pioneer style is evident
from the following description of them
selves and their vehicle, as contained in
notices scattered broadcast over the coun
t ry :
The woman was of medium height, weight
about 150 pounds, light complected, scar on
left cheek. Was attired in a brown dress, with
a brown rape and black hat. The man is heavy
set. with a light mustache and hair the sann-;
weighs ISO pounds.
Their wagon was a light lumber wagon
painted greeu, striped with yellow, with more
thHti the usual amount of striping: it had
large sideboards and a Large brown, top, emi
prant style, with a window hole in the back.
The horses were a gray, a buckÂ«icin and a small
black or browii with a white stripe in its face.
When H. Nelson returned home Jast
Monday he found his children crying for
their absent mother. Neighbors informed
him that Mrs. Nelson had eloped with
Paulson, and had gone for San Jose. He
at once started in pursuit, but after trac
ing the runaways to Niles lost the trail
and has since been unable to locate them.
Paulson is a musician who travels with
"barnstorming" theatrical companies.
When he appeared in this City Mrs. Nelsoi.
was struck by his dashing style and
haughty air, and Paulson had no trouble
in persuading her that future greatness
was in store for her behind the footlights.
She is but 25 years old and comely, and
when she left" with the musician it was
with the presumed intention of becoming
a theatrical star.
VISITING LOS ANGELES
Mme. Modjeska Resting After a
Journey Over the Great
Divide.
Will Go to Her Santiago Canyon
Home to Recuperate From Her
Late Illness.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 27.â Mme.
Modjeska, accompanied by her husband,
Count Bozenta, arrived here this evening
on the Chicago limited over the Santa Fe.
They were met at the station by Dr. J. H*
Bullard, an old Anaheim friend, who
drove them to his residence at 308 South
Olive street, where they will remain until
the Countess has had time to rest from the
fatigue of the journey, after which they
will proceed to Mod jeska's country seat,
Arden, in the Santiago Canyon, Orange
County.
The great actres? shows plainly the ef
fects ot her recent ilrness, from which she
has not fully recovered, although she is
gradually growing stronger. Her left arm
is paralyzed and hangs limp and helpless
at her side. The paralysis was caused, the
doctors say, by a clot of blood in the
."boulder, the result presumably of over
exertion while playing at Cincinnati. It
was on orders of her physicians, who rec
ommended outdoor air and abÂ«olute rest
mentally and physically, that she decided
to go to her ranch.
" Yes. I expect to be able to return to the
stage," saia the Countess in answer to a
question. "I am sure that this genial
climateâ the glorious sunshine and balmy
air â will soon restore me to perfect health.
"Although returning here unexpectedly
and under adverse circumstances, I am
sincerely glad to be here, for this is my
home and I am always content among the
people of California, who have been ex
tremely kind and neighborly toward me
since I first settled among them."
Although Modjeska left the home of
her son in Chicago but five days ago, she
knew nothing of the attempt to kidnap
her grandchild, information about the
affair being kept from her so as not to un
duly excite her. Count Bozenta said it
was evidently the act of some crank, who
was not moved by malice toward Mme.
Modjeska, but was making trouble for her
son and family from pure motives of mis
chief or some insane freak.
TRAMPS AVOID MILL VALLEY.
Men Who Will Not Work Placed in Water-
Soaked Cells of the Sausa/ito
Jail.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 29.â The
people of Mill Valley have about solved
the vagrancy question, and aa a result few
of the dusty travelers are seen in the val
ley. The method is simple and works ex
cellently, and is recommended to other
communities. When a man who is unem
ployed simply because he will not work
comes into Mill Valley, he is either es
corted out of town or made to feel very
plainly that his presence is not desired. If
he is obstinate and refuses to leave, he is
arrested by a deputy constable and brought
before the Justice of the Peace, where a
charge of vagrancy is placed against him.
The deputy then takes the prisoner to
Sausalito and lodges him in jail.
The Sausalito jail is usually under water
and is not a very pleasant place in which
to spend a night and the vagabond soon
learns the fact. After being kept in the
water-soaked jail over night, he is brought
backlto Mill Valley where the Justice of
the Peace informs him that he will be sent
to the County Jail for ten days unless he
leaves Mill Valley nnd promises never to
return. Tb,is he very willingly does for
the "haunted" cell in the County Jail is
where the vagrant is usually put. This
â¢'haunted" cell is well known and the
tramps have a Hread of it.
And this method is not without its good
points. The Justice of the Peace gets $3
for the case; the Deputy Constable makes
about $o, and the vagrant, it is claimed by
some, is never taKen to jail until the last
train leaves, so a team must be hired to
get to Sausalito, and 'the county foots the
bill.
To Be Guests of Mill Valley.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 29.-MHI
Valley is preparing to entertain the school

The Mill Valley Improvement Club has

tions point to a successful and enjoyable
reception. This will be the first conven
tion of any kind ever held in Mill Valley,
and consequently great arrangements are
being made to entertain the guests.

CHEROKEE FLAT'S
GOLD PRODUCER.
Only Mine in California
Run by a Court of
Equity.
SPRING VALLEY'S YIELD
Property From Which $13,000,000
in Yellow Metal Has
Been Taken.
JUDGE PREWETT IN CONTROL.
Interesting History of a Bitter Legal
Fight Dating Back to Twelve
Years Ago.
OROVILLE, Cat,., March 29.â The well
known Spring Valley hydraulic mine at
Cherokee Flat, whose big mortgage of
$280,000 was ordered foreclosed by Judge
I'rewett on Friday, after eight years of
bitter fighting on the part of the Bank of
California and Rideout & Smith, is the
only mine in California that has ever
been run by a court of equity. Through
application made by the bondholders last
November Judge Prewett appointed a re
ceiver for the mine, thus taking it out ol
the control of ihe banks, where it had been
so long.
The Judge appointed for the responsible
position of representing him at the mine a
close personal friend, W. J. Wbitcomb of
Colfax. Whitcomb, under orders of the
court, has absolute charge of the mine.
While not working it himself the receiver
has made contracts with third parties for
the leasing and working of various parts
of the "worked over" portions of the mine
upon an agreed royalty. He also super
vises the maintenance, patrol and opera
tion of the 100 miles of ditches, flumes and
pipes owned by the company, and gener
ally has the care of the large interests at
stake covered by the big mortgage.
The appointment of the receiver was not
secured by the bondholders without a
hard fight, the two banks which have been
fighting the validity of the bonds making
the claim that for a court of equity, in
which capacity Judge Prewett sat in the
case, to assume judicial charge would vir
tually amount to usurpation. Attorney
Blakeman, however, as counsel for the
bondholders, riled some affidavits with the
court alleging gross negligence on the
part of the agents of the Bank of Califor
nia, which had been for six years in pos
session of the mine. In support of his affi
davit Attorney Blakeman declared to
Judge Prewett that the flumes of the mine
had all been ripped out, that many of the
"chiefs" had been sold and that Attorney
C. W. Cross, one of the lawyers in the case,
had "jumped" one of the most valuable
portions of the property at the mine.
The receiver was appointed upon the
presentation of these affidavits, and the
mine has since been run by the receiver,
under the direction of the court. It is not
expected that there will be any contest of
the claim by Mr. Cross, as the lawyers
hold that the latter has no legal standing
in tlie case.
The history of the protracted litigation
dates back over twelve years. In 1880 the
New York Mining Development Company,
headed by Senator A. B. Dorsey, pur
chased the property. The price paid was
$800,000 in cash. One hundred and fifty
thousand dollars in bonds was sold. Later
the company became indebted to the Bank
of California and Hideout & Smith for
$50,000.
The attempt to defeat the bonds fol
lowed. The banks claimed that there were
technical informalities in the issue of the
bonds, and, after raising that question
concerning their validity, sold the entire
property, including the vast system of
ditches and canals, bidding everything in
for the amount of their judgment. Owing
to the uncertainty regarding the bonds,
no one else cared to bid at the sale. Since
then the fight has been between the
banks and the bondholders.
At one time an attempt was made to
compromise the suit. The bondholders,
while claiming that the banks had full
knowledge of the mortgage at the time
they made advances, and that if poor
judgment was shown, they, and not the
innocent holders of the bonds should
stand the loss, agreed to 8 reorganization
plan. It was proposed that a new issue of
bonds to the amount of $200,000 be made
by the mining company, the banks to get
$50,000 in bonds as the amount of their
debt, and the bondholders to take the bal
ance of $150,000 for the $155,000 owed
them. The late L. L. Robinson, who was
president of the company, made several
trips to New YorK for conference with the
Eastern bondholder?, but when the deal
was about to be consummated, the banks
suddenly broke off all negotiations and
began their attempt to defeat the mort
gage. So contident were the banks in
being able to win, that it is said that they
had all the arrangements made at one
time to sell the mine to a big company of
mining men.
The mine has a brilliant record as a
gold- producer. Upward of $13,000,000 in
gold has been taken out, with the lead
apparently inexhaustible. No other single
hydraulic mine in California has such a
magnificent showing. The gravel deposit
is over 1000 feet wide and the extent of the
workings is over a mile in length.
The price paid for the mine by the New
York company, $800,000, represented one
of the largest deals of its kind on the coast.
At present prospecting tunnels show over
$1,000,000 to be lying loose in the lead.
The last manager of the mine before the
litigation tied up the property, was Louis
Glass, the well known head of the tele
phone interests on this coast.
It Is due to Glass' engineering skill that
the present course of the lead is known.
Against the advice of many other engi
neers, who asserted that the" lead had de
flected into a side ravine, where it totally
disappeared, he ran a long tunnel under
neath Table Mountain, again discovering
the lead, which was found to be richer and
larger than ever. Under the mountain
the lead was probed by numerous tunnels
and was found to be from 800 to 1000 feet
wide and from twenty-rive to fifty feet
thick.
It is in the tunnels that the estimates
show over $1,000,000 in loose gold lying in
the gravel lead ready for extraction.
Glass had all the preparations made for
drifting, but the tiling of the suit in fore
closure brought everything to a (standstill.
The long litigation that. has followed has
had one beneficial effect. The long delay
lias, in the opinion of experts, given the
Glass tunnel time to drain the part of the
lead already tapped, so that to-day drifting
for the million in sight can be commenced
at once.
Air, tflass is one of the holders of the
bonds. The only other large California
bondholder is David Gage of OakJand.
The balance is held in Is ew York. Most
of the Eastern ones are now owned by
estates, the original owners having died
during the protracted litigation. Among
the men who have owned in the company
is the late Edgar Judson of the Judson
Powder Works, A. E. Davis, the late mil
lionaire, Doe, another deceased millionaire,
and Senator George C. Perkins. L. L. Rob
inson was president of the company up to
the time ot his death.
Mr. Gage was one of the men in charge
of the mine for twenty-five years and he
and Mr. Glass are tiie only bondholders
who are acquainted with the practical
operation of the mine.
It is an odd fact that more diamonds
have been discovered at the Cherokee Flat
mine than in any other part of California.
About 300 diamonds, many of them valued
as high as $150, have been found in the
flumes, and it is supposed that a great
many were washed away with the slick
ens.as no special attempt was made to
save them. Garney Williams, the famous
California expert, who is now superin
tendent of the Kimberley diamond fields
at South Africa, under a salary of $100,000
a year, paid some attention to the dia
monds at Cherokee Flat while he was
superintendent of that mine, but there has
been no other diamond prospecting there.
Although Cherokee is generally spoken
of as a dead mining camp, as a result of
the litigation over 100 men nave for years
been making wages on the old workings of
the mine. Tinder leases from the receiver,
two companies, consisting respectively of
forty and twenty men each, are "ground
sluicing" the "flat," together with various
smaller firms. A Portuguese company
composed of twenty men recently cleaned
up after a year's run, taking out $20,000.
The ditches conveying the water to the
mine and the provision made for the care
and disposal of its debris are both on a
gigantic scale. No two such systems for
one mine has probably ever been success
fully carried out, if even attempted.
The water is brought over the 100 miles
in ditches, pipes and flumes, and the canal
by which the "slickens" is conveyed to
tne tules is over thirty miles long, and
from 1000 to 2500 feet wide, with levees
seven feet in height. To bring in the
water alone cost $750,000, and the con
struction of the canals $500,000 more.
Tne water rights of themselves are con
sidered highly valuable. The ditches tap
the largest water-shed in that part ot the
Sierras, and command in the dryest part
of the year over 5000 inches of water,
miners' measure. The mine also owns
twelve reservoirs, used to supply the works
in case of any temporary accident to the
flumes.
Two of the reservoirs are located on the
route of the ditch, each being three miles
in circumference.
The engineering difficulties overcome in
the problem of bringing the water to
Cherokee were of a most hazardous nature,
most of the engineers who examined the
proposition when it was first broached pro
nouncing it impracticable. The late Ed
gar J. Judson, founder of the Judson
Powder Works, finally found an engineer
who said it could be done and poured his
money into the project, despite the jeers
of hisassociates.
The work, during its progress, was
dubbed "Judson's folly." The most diffi
cult piece of work is the crossing of the
Feather Kiver by a wroughtiron pipe
thirty inches in diameter and 13,000 feet
long. The pressure at the lowest part is
1000 feet, the pipe being three-eighths of
an inch thick.
The sale of the big mine under fore
closure of the bonds will be pushed for-,
ward with haste. Already the bondhold
ers are organizing to put in a collective
Did for the full amount of the total judg
ment. Whether the policy of the banks
will be one of delay looking for a possible
compromise is not yet known.
THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
Orchardists Interested in a Ma
chine Designed to Protect
From Frost.
Crop Prospects in the Valley Are
Encouragingâ Mrs. Lovett Sues
for a Divorce.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 29.âOrchard
ists are evincing much interest in a ma
chine, designed to produce a cloud of
vapor for the protection of fruit trees from
frost, that is completed and ready for trial
on the W. C. Anderson fruit ranch on the
Ahnaden road. It is claimed that the con
trivance will prove much more successful
than the smudge fires sprayed with water
that have heretofore been tried in orchards.
The machine consists of a large sheetiron
furnace designed to be moved through the
orchard upon a sled or waeon. The fur
nace door is in the rear and half a dozen
chimneys carry the smoke from the upper
part of the furnace. Around the front and
on both sides of the furnace is a wire net
ting that holds a packing of stable refuse
and straw about eight inches thick. On
top of the furnace also is a layer of manure
and straw.
The straw packing is kept wet con
stantly, and in the furnace is kept up a
good tire, fed by the brush from the or
chard. It is claimed that two men can
start the machine moving at 3 o'clock in
the morning and. before 6 o'clock they will
have a bank of fog envelopine an eighty
acre orchard twenty feet high, which will
absolutely protect the fruit buds from the
frost. If the principle of the machine
proves a success it can be greatly improved
upon in the construction.
SANTA CLARA VALLEY CROPS.
An Encouraging Outlook, for the Growers
of fruit.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 29.â While the
prospects for a large crop of fruit in Santa
Clara Valley are good at present, this is
the critical period in the development, and
it will be some weeks before results can be
predicted with any degree of certainty.
Much fruit has formed and set well and is
growing, but causes may arise in the com
ing month to make it drop. Moorpark
apricots will be light in the valley, but
reports of a very good crop come from the
section around Los Gatos. There is every
indication of abundant crops of prunes
and peaches.
The recent warm rains have done an im
mense amount of good. The hay and
grain crops in the low lands are looking
well.
Sues for a Divorce.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 29.â Frances E.
Lovett has sued Charles E. Lovett for
divorce on the ground of willful desertion.
The Lovetts were married in this city in
1890 and lived together until early in 1895,
when Lovett deserted his wife. The plain
tiff alleges that she supported her husband
during their entire married life. There
are no children and no community prop
erty.
Deserted by His Countrymen.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 29.â Another
charge of murder has been placed against
Wong Mow Gee, the Chinaman who shot
and killed two of his fellow-laborers at
Laurelwood farm, about five miles south
of Santa Clara, a couple of weeks ago, and
to-morrow he will be arraigned in Justice
Dwyer's court for the killing of Gee Ah
Lung, his second victim. Wong Mow Gee,
who is confined in the county jail, has
been entirely deserted by his countrymen.
He spends most of his time lying in his
bunk crying.
Snow at Seattle.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 29.â Nearly

MARE ISLAND
NAVAL NEWS
Visions of a New Drydock
Dispelled by Act of
Congress.
PROGRESS ON THE YARD.
The Gunboat Bennington to Be
Overhauled and Put Into
Shipshape.
HOWISON MAY BE PROMOTED.
It Is Believed the Commandant
Will Be Given the South
Atlantic Station.
VALLEJO. Cal., March 29.â T0 live in
a navy-yard town one must be endowed
â¢with the happy faculty of always looking
for something bright in the future. Hopes
have been indulged in for the past few
weeks â since Congress has been in session
âthat the lawmakers, in their wisdom,
would appropriate money to build a new
dry-dock at Mare Island. The hopes were
as light as vapor, yet it was something to
keep the spirit up by those who toil with
the hammer and ax. The past week has
witnessed the disappointment of those in
dulging in the visions of a foundation for
a dock sutlicient in size to take in the Ore
gon or the great battle-ship lowa, so suc
cessfully launched at the Cramps' yard yes
terday. The dock will not be commenced
this year.
Now the people here are looking for
some apostle in the wilderness to aid in
securing a torpedo boat to keep the ma
chines at work. The regular appropriations
were passed, but not to become available
before the Ist of July, and even then some
of them will not be drawn upon for
months unless some rule prevails that con
tractors shall furnish material promptly
and of excellent quality. The special appro
priation? for the repairs of ships comes in
good time, and will enable many men to
be retained and others to be taken on.
The Bennington, for which some of the
money will be used, is in the drydock and
will be overhauled at once. There is com
paratively little to be done to her outside
of general repair work incident to a ship
in commission as long as she has been.
It is quite interesting and refreshing to
read a published statement that "the Ben
nington was the butt of every joke of the
English officers while in the Asiatic sta- '
tion, by reason of her engines being so
frequently disabled." The fact is well
known to every one in naval circles that
the Bennington has never visited that
station.
It is currently reported that Captain H.
L. Howison, Commandant of the Yard,
will be detached in July, his term of three
years shore duty having expired. His ad
ministration has been one of success from
beginning to end, and there have been
more complicated matters and heavy work
to be accomplished than for years past.
The captain, being nearly at the com
modore's, list and the most available man,
will undoubtedly be eiven the South At
lantic station. Several bavo been spoken
of for the command of the station and
yard, but none so far definitely settled
upon. While Commodore Norton has been
mentioned prominently for the place, it
would not be a surprise to see the orders
given to Captain Louis Kempff, who is
higher on the list of captains than was
Captain Howison when he was given com
mand of the yard.
Commodore Norton will soon be a rear
admiral, and of late officers of such rank
have been given the presidency of some
one of the boards, with headquarters at
Washington. Commodore Norton is well
known her.c, as for years he v.as in com
mand of the receiving ship Independence.
He, like Captain Kempff, in his younger
days was counted one of the best athletes
in the navy, and each saw considerable
active service during the war, Commodore
Norton being the executive officer of the
Lackawanna on the west gulf blockading
squadron.
The friends of Boatswain D. Glynn, U.
S. N., and Miss Annie Ward are extending
congratulations to them upon their con
templated marriage on the Bth of next
month. The boatswain is attached to the
yard and Miss Ward is the eldest daughter
of James Ward, in charge of the Govern
ment stock at Mare Island.
The appointment of Commander John J.
Brice a 9 Commissioner of Fish and Fishe
ries is one that meets the approval of those
in and out of the navy-yard.
Naval Constructor Baxter and several of
the construction mechanics well versed in
the dockage of ships went tip to Port Or
chard the first of last week to dock the
monitor Monterey. They will be gone
two or three weeks. It was considered
best by the department to assist in the
first trial of docking a vessei in the new
dock at the northern station.
As much interest was manifested by the
clerical and appointive employes in a re
port that they were to be placed under the
civil service rules as though a battle-ship
had been awarded to the yard. While
there is some truth in the rumor that the
commandant, clerks and chief clerks of
the departments may be so placed, it is
not at all likely that the Secretary of the
Navy would wholesale all of his own ap
pointees into life positions under tne Gov
ernment.

AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
Slim Attendance at the Butts and Only
a Few Matches.
At Schuetzen Park but few marksmen
put in an appearance during the day. A
half dozen club members were matched
for dinners and refreshments, a couple of
guards from the State Prison at San Quen
tin tried their skill and a few straggling
members of the Naval Battalion put in
an appearance.
During the morning, Clubmen Baden,
Lange and Ehrenpfort shot two scores, the
prize bein? a dinner, to be paid for by the
loser. The points made were:
Baden, first ten, 204; sacond ten. 208.
I.anue, first ten, 166; second ten, 'JO/.
Khrenpfort, first ten, 191: second ten 212.
During the afternoon Messrs. Utschig,
11. Plageman and Lange contested with a
team composed of Messrs. Baden, W.
Ehrenpfort and A. Ehrenpfort. The scores
made were: Ulschig 109, Lange 72, Piage
man 73, total 254, against W. Ehrenpfort
97, Baden 85, A. Ehrenpfort 104, total 286.
The small attendance at the range is
accounted for by the fact that yesterday
being a "fifth Sunday" in the month, was
an off day. Next Sunday will be held the
grand free-for-all shoot on ring and honor
ary targets.
PRIVATE RIFLE MUTCHES
Several German Sharpshooters
Indulge in Fifty-Shot
Contests.
Huber and Jungblut Beat Glinder

Medal Records.
Whenever there are five Sundays in a
month the fifth is always called the "off
day" among the rifle shooters. Yesterday
was an off Sunday at the Shell Mound
shooting range, but for all that there were
several individual matches that were of in
terest. Four of the best German sharp
shooters had a match for a purse. W.
Glimlermann and W. Garms shot a 50
--Â« hot match against H. Huber and H. Jung
blut on the 25-ring German target. The
first couple won by 173 points. The scores
in strings of ten shots were as follows:
Huber 193, 205, 189, 199,207â993; Jung

WOODLAND, YOLO
COUNTY'S PRIDE
The Wealthiest City of Its
Size on the Pacific
Coast.
ITS VARIED RESOURCES.
Banks, Fruit Exchange, Cream
ery, Armory, Opera-House
and Big Ditch.
FINE CLIMATE AND RICH SOIL.
Water Storage and an Irrigating
System Alone Neededâ Career
of the Founder.
WOODLAND, Cal., March 29.âWood
land, one of the prettiest little cities in
California, is the county seat of Yolo
county, wnich has a population of over
4000. It is the -wealthiest city of its size in
the State, and excels in the number and
cost of handsome residences. There are
four banking institutions of almost un
limited resources and credit, that represent
in wealth more than the six banking
houses of Stockton, a city three times its
size.
Thefstreets are wide and clean, the busi
ness thoroughfares are paved with bitumi
nous rocK, and the residence streets and
avenues are adorned with shade and orna
mental trees, affording many miles of ex
cellent driveway. The city is illuminated
bj* splendid electric light, incandescent
and gas systems. The water and sewer
age systems are first class and are both
controlled by the city. The business
blocks are of imposing masonry and of a
substantial character.
"Woodland is justly proud of its volun
teer tire department, and insurance com
panies credit it with being remarkably ef
ficient.
Journalism is represented by the Daily
Evening Democrat, a first-class newspaper,
owned and edited by Ed E. Leake. The
Democrat is the city and county official
paper. The Home Alliance is a bright
little eight-page weekly, ably and success
fully ediied by Mrs. S. A. Huston. The
Mail is a morning paper, edited by J. 11.
Dungan, and is a good local journal.
Woodland is noted as a city of schools,
churches, conventions and literary socie
ties. Its free public Horary affords large,
airy and comfortable reading-rooms and
is replete with standard and wholesome
literature. The public schools and the
high school are weli organized and are in
charge of an efficient corps of instructors.
The High School, which is now in its
first year, already shows results of a grati
fying nature, and is an excellent addition
to the school system of this city. The
closing of Hesperian College, which for
many years was the leading educational
institution of' the Sacramento Valley,
made a public High School a necessity.
The school draws pupils from all parts of
the county and has a constant attendance
of eighty or more. This is remarkable
when one considers that three-fourths of
the pupils are in the lirst or junior class,
and bespeaks a widespread interest in
educational matters on the part of the citi
zens of the town.
The Holy Rosary Academy ranks among
the best educational institutions in the
State and affords thorough discipline and
educational opportunities.
The leading denominations possess fine
and well-ordered houses of worship. Al
together Woodland's advantages from a
Bocial, religious, educational and literary
point of view are of a superior quality.
Any account of Woodland, either* as to
her business or social life, would not be
cemplete without reference to Major F. S.
Freeman, the founder of the city. His
career, dating from the earliest history of
the city, is an open book to our citizens,
and one on which his many friends dwell
with pride.
In 1852 Major Freeman purchased from
the Government the land upon which
Woodland now stands, and in the same
year purchased irom N. Wyckoff the
country store and stock of merchandise
then just established on the site of our
beautiful city. This was the first store
house ever built in Woodland.
In 1857 Maior Freeman was married to
Miss Gertrude G. Swain, a niece of Mrs.
Charles W. Crocker, now of San Francisco.
The Crockers ana Dernniings were then
residents of this county.
The town site of Woodland was laid out
in 1860 ana christened Woodland by Mrs.
Freeman, from the abundance of oalt trees
which then extendea for miles In all di
rections.
In 1872 Major Freeman was chairman of
tne Ways and Means Committee of the
General" Assembly. The gailant fight he
made in advocacy of the "Freeman fare
and freight bill" maae him for a tune one
of the most conspicuous figures in the
State. The measure was carried through
the lower house, but through the strenu
ous efforts of the railroad lobbyists was de
feated in the Senate by only one vote. At
that time he had the support of all the
live journals in the State, except perhaps
the railroad contingent, whose auvocacy
of railroad interests was grounded on nio&t
substantial considerations.
The kindly, ?;enial nature of the major,
his broad and generous humanity, are
proudjy remembered by hundreas who
knew him in those early days. Friendships
cemented there were of the lasting kind,
and when recountine his many good
qualities, the oIJ residents seldom foreet
to mention that none were turned away
from tne major's store cold or hungry
because they had not the means to buy.
Such memories in the hearts of a grate
ful and appreciative people are of more
worth than monuments of^ bronze ana
marble.
The Woodland Fruit Exchange was in
corporated June 5, 1894. It is one of the
leading institutions of the county and an
important factor in the development of
the local fruit market. It was organized
on a co-operative basis and aims to reduce
the cost of materials used by buying In
large quantities, facilitating the market
ing of crops by concentration of products
and uniform grades of cleaning and grad
ing at one place, thus largely cutting un
der the expense of individual shipments.
The association includes nearly all grow
ers in the county. The latest improved
cleaner, sternmer and grader for raisins,
and grader and dipper for prunes, all pro
pelled by steam power, have been added.
Large quantities of table grapes are
shipped 1 to New York and the exchange
has established a reputation for Woodland
grapes excelled only by one packer in the
State. During the past season forty cars
of green fruit, mostly Tokay, Cornichou
and Emperor grapes, ten car 9of pears,
peaches and shipping prunes and twenty
live cars of seedless Sultana raisinsâac
knowledged by the trade to be the finest
Sultnnas in the Stateâ left the Woodland
market for Eastern points. In addition to
this the exchange sends out about forty
carloads of dried fruitâ raisins, prunes,
apricots, peaches and pear;-.
The association has been a big saving to
the growers in securing prices in advance
or those obtained by individual growers.
It is especially beneficial to the small
grower, as he receives the same price for
one ton as the man who has fifteen cars,
it' quality is equal.
During the packing season about 100
women, girls and boys are given employ
ment. The capacity* of the building will
be doubled this season.
The board of directors are H. C. How
ard (president), L. G. Rhodes (vice-presi
dent), C. T. Uidwell (secretary and treas
urer). W. H. Howd (superintendent), I. P-
Hoftg, A. J. Thomas and E. Gallup, all
representative business men and orchard
ists. ,
The Woodland Creamery is an enter
prise in â which every farmer within v
radios of ten mfles of this City manifests
a deep and growing interest. It was in
corporated last October and is now fully
established as one of the leading features
of Woodland's industrial life.
The directors are: G. N. Merritt, presi
dent; T. S. Spaulding, secretary; i~aae
Fisher, E. 8. Farnham, H. J. Rasmussen,
E. A. Dopking, J. li. Powell and H. E.
Coil.
The original cost of the plant was $.3150.
The manufacture or butter was com
menced November 1, 1895, with W. M.
Turner, the veteran butter-maker, at the
helm. On the opening day 950 pounds of
milk were received from nine farmer
patrons. To-day the institution has sixty
six patrons and the daily receipts of milk
are 8500 pounds.
The industry is operated on the toll sys
tem. Patrons are charged ?>)Â± cents per
pound for the manufacture of the product,
which is marketed and sold for the patrons
by the association.
At DO time since operations were com
menced (four months since) has Woodland
creamery butter sold for less than 40 cents
a roll, and during the winter as high as 80
cents a roll has been realized. At no time
has there been an accumulation of butter.
In fact, the reverse has been the situation,
and to such an extent that preparations
for enlarging the factory are now being
made.
That well-appointed creameries through
out the Sacramento and San Joaquin val
leys are flourishing institutions is indi
cated by the following figures furnished by
Butter-maker Turner of the local enter
prise. They extend over a period of four
months, from November 1 to February 29:

patron alone furnised the creamery 18,677
pounds of milk from twenty-five cow*.
The butter wa9 sold for 25 cents per pound,
and after deducting 3}4 cents per pound
for manufacture, the amount dueand paid
him by the directors was $184 20.
While eight acres, are required to feed a
cow on coast range land one acre in this
valley will keep a cow in splendid condi
tion. In Yolo County butter can be pro
duced for lo cents a pound and leave a
profit to the producer.
Woodland is tinder obligations to Cap
tain H. M. Pnndle and the officers of
Company P, Is. G. C, for the commodious
armory recently completed. The building
is of brick in the form of a fortress. It is
a two-story structure with a frontage of 90
feet and a depth of 130 feet. The west GO
feet constitute an immense drill hall and
a large hanging gallery that will accom
modate hundreds of people. Other por
tions of the building constitute an armory,
dressing-room, assembly-room, banquet
hall, etc*
No company in the National Guard has
more complete or comfortable quarters
than has the local military.
Woodland's opera-house, now in course
of construction, will be as complete and
perfect in its appointments as any of the
metropolitan theaters. The exterior will be
unpretent ious, but the interior will be
elaborate and tasteful.
The interior of the building will be GOx
104 feet. The stage will be 25x30 feet,
which is unusually commodious for the
demands that will -be made upon it. The
orchestra will seat eighty-eight people, the
dress circle 224 the gallery 300 and the
boxe9 sixteen. The interior will be beau
tifully decorated, presenting shades and
tints "of the most delicate colors. Every
department will be perfect in detail, which
will make the new \Voodland opera-house
a delightful place of amusement.
When the building is completed none
but the most popular traveling companies
will be engaged. Located as this city is,
between Sacramento and San Francisco,
the high-class companies that visit the
Coast will rind it both profitable and con
venient to present the best they have ill
tVeir repertoires to the enterprising people
of this locality, who are capaDle of ap
preciating the favor.
So mucn for the town's community lifeâ
a life built upon good schools and good
society â blessed with a healthfui climate
and surrounded by the richest and most
fertile lands in the Sacramento Valley.
But there is a serious question which pre
sents itself whenever Woodland's con
tinued growth and prosperity are matters
for consideration. It is irrigation.
It is a satisfaction to know that the out
of-date methods of the old-time wheat
rancher are becoming a thing of the past
and that the immense ranches are being
subdivided and converted into small hold
ings of 10, 'JO and 40 acre tracts. The
holders oi these small tracts especially ana
the farming community in general are be
coming aroused to the consciousness that
their prosperity depends upon irrigation,
and in this growing belief or opinion we
see evidences in every section of this fer
tile valley.
No other place on ea.rth presents such
splendid nutural advantages for irriga
tion as does Yolo County in Cache Creek,
with Clear Lake as its storage reservoir.
But the stumbling block lies in the owner
ship of the Moore ditch, the proprietors of
which control the exclusive right, prac
tically, to use the waters of Cache Creek
] for irrigation purposes. The ditch is now,
j and has been for years past, in litigation,
! and the welfare and substantial interests
I of our farmers have suffered and are now
â  suffering therefrom. Thousands upon
j thousands of dollars, figuratively speak
ing, daily lloat down in the unused waters
of this stream.
It is not often that the affairs of one
family so largely affect an extensive com
munity, but in the case of the contentions
of the heirs of the late James Moore, for
mer owner of the Moore ditch, the mater
ial interests of thousands of people suffer.
When Mrs. Moore, wife of the late James
Moore, chose to remarry, her children
made desperate opposition. The old lady
was compelled to come into court and de
fend herself against a charge of mental in
: competency preferred by her children.
j The effort to prove her irresponsible and
I put her under guardianship failed and re
i suited only in intensifying the already
overheated feelings between mother and
children.
Having, after her marriage, relinquished
the control of the ditch to her son Robert,
stie instituted legal proceedings against
him to keep him off the ranch and ob
strnct his work as manager of the ditch.
The son sued hia mother for $GOOO. Pend
ing this litigation the court appointed a
receiver to manage the. ditcn. Subse
quently the mother sued to have the re
ceiver removed and herself reinstated as
manager of the property. In answer Rob
ert set up that durinsr the time his mother
managed the ditch, the two years before
her secend marriage, she wantonly neg
lected the ditch with the avowed purpose
of depreciating the value of the *property
to the injury of the rights of the Moore
.children, and in violation of the provisions
of the will of the deceased Jame3 Moore.
The mother's petition to have the re
ceiver removed was denied by the court,
and the Judge, in rendering his decision,
took occasion to say : "It is to the interests
of tue mother to curtail the amount ex
pended in repairs to the minimum limit
in order to increase her annual income.
It is.to the interest of her son Robert to
increase the amount expended in repairs
to the maximum limit in order to make
the property more valuable, a 9 he has an
interest in the remainder after her death.
The court is of the opinion that undef the
circumstances of this mass of litigation,
and the peculiar relation existing between
the parties, it is best for the trust property
that their claims and management to the
Woodland ditch be set aside and rsvoked,
and some disinterested person De appointed
to assume full control and management
thereof."
At the present time the ditch is in a
deplorable condition and it is difficult to
understand how it is to be improved.
The dam was built by James Moore in
1881 at a cost of $50,000. Will the mother
rebuild it at a cost of $35,000 or $40,000
simply to increase the value of property
that is not hers? Will the children re
build it so long as the mother lives and re
ceives the net income?
In view of all this, in view of the litiga
tion that disrupts all peaceful relations
among the Moore heirs, the wretched con
dition of the ditch property, the poor pros-
pect of its being improved, it seems doubly
imperative that the people along Cache
Creek for whose happiness and prosperity
God traced that beautiful stream down
from the hills shall organize themselves
under the State law and proceed at once
to construct an irrigation system commen
surate with their needs and the grand op
portunities which nature offers for the de
velopment of this county and city.

THE NICARAGUAN CANAL.
Interesting Digest of the Report
of the Congressional
Committee.
FRIENDLY TO THE WATERWAY
Healthfulness of the Route and Its
Availability to Sailing Craft
Commended.
By CAPTAIN W. L,. MERRY.
When the Board of Engineers appointed
by authority of the Fifty-third Congress to
examine the Nicaragua canal made its re
port to the President, an incorrect version
of its contents was given the public
through anEastern journal. The publica
tion of this important paper by the Gov
ernment has consequently attracted much
interest, and has been, in some particulars,
an agreeable surprise to the friends ot the
canal.
The liealthfulness of the Nicaragua
canal route is commented upon as tin im
portant factor In its favor, 'i'lie report says:
'There seems little reason to believe that tne
general conditions in Nicaragua involve any
special rate of mortality. So far as statistics
ere attainable tney indicate healthtul condi
tions and the absence of epidemics. â¢ â¢ â¢
Only human ienoranee and the neglect of
sanitary^precautions would occasion an exces
sive mortality." (Page IS.)
The commission states that "there seems no
reason to apprehend danger from earth
quaken that will imperil the stability of canal
construction," thus dismissing one of the theo
retical objections occasionally alluded to.
(Page 15.) â¢
i'he eroftion by the action of water
(heavy rainfalls, whicii are copious on the At
lantic Coast and decrease rapidly inland) Is
found, by observation, to be so inconsiderable
as to remove all anxiety on that score and,
with a surface canal, the water encountered
will be under the control of engineering skill.
(Fane 39.)
Tho variety of products produced in
the country, "natural and cultivated,
are remarkable," an important observation,
in striking contrast with Suez and Jr'anaina,
indicating that the development which will
ensue in the vicinity of the canal after its con
struction is actively commenced will soon
create a commerce whicn will pay the cost of
maintenance. (Page lti.)
The prevalence of steady trade winds
over the line of the canal and in tho ap
proaches to both terminals is remarked upon,
proving that the Nicaragua canal will be
available lor sailing vessels again in con
trast with Suez and I'auama. It is largely due
to these perennial winds that Nicaragua en
joys a healthy marine tropical climate, with
cool nlphts and minimized malarial influences.
(Pages 18 and 29.) â¢
Tne availability of labor to be obtained
at Jamaica from a population of 400,000, from
which 15,000 to 20,000 excellent negro labor
ers can be contracted iorat fair wages, is noted
as an important advautage. (Page 18.)
After thus commenting upon the great
advantages which the canai engineer rinds
to encourage his skill, the report enters
upon tne criticism of the work already
done, and of the plans outlined for the
completion of the work. I may here re
mark that the engineers who have adopted
tue present plans are, like those who make
the report, mostly iv the service of the
United States Government and using,
aside from their own surveys, those of
other American, English and French en
gineers, since Child's survey for Vander
bilt in 1852. The commission was only
forty-one days in Nicaragua, of which
about one-half were used in examination
of tho canal line, and the residue ex
pended in visiting Managua, the capital of
NEW TO-DAT.

the republic, and other points of interest;
a fact in contrast with the years of pains
taking work by Menocal and other engi
neers associated with him. The commis
sion remarks that their predecessors have
paid too much attention 10 hydrographic
work and not enough to hydraulics. This
is possibly correct, since over 4000 miles
.have been surveyed with instruments of
J precision before finally deciding upon the
me of the canal. The techuical criticism
; of the plans adopted by the company's
engineer cover too many points to permit j
more than a brief allusion thereto.
While the eeneral plan is approved, j
some details are objected to, notably the !
construction of the Ochoa dam, on the |
San Juan River, where the board would j
prefer a cut-stone masonry instead of a
rock-rill dam. But, admitting its feasi
bility as arranged, recommendations are |
made for its improvement and for increas
ing its dimensions, necessarily also its
cost. Many other minor changes are sug
gested as improvements, among them in- â 
creased dimensions of the canal in some j
places, an increase in the number of locks, !
some changes in harbor plans, etc.
A recommendation is made to raise the
summit level two feet, from 110 to 112
feet, a change often suggested before, and i
apparently advantageous. Carefully con- ]
sidering the various changes recommended I
the impartial reader and student of the
questions presented will accept some and
reject others, but it is proper to note that
every change suggested materially in
creases the cost.
The apparent inconsistency of the in
creased cost estimate has attracted public
attention, but a careful examination of
the report makes the reason plain. It is
evident that the commission landed in j
Nicaragua with the Panama fiasco im
pressed upon their meutal vision. They
were to append their names to a Govern
ment report, and naturally decided to take
no chances on cost; to err on the right
side if any error occurred.
With "standard double-track construc
tion railways" at eoch end of the line;
locks increased in number; additions to
dimensions of sections of the canal; $4,000,
--000 tor management; $1,000,000 for sani
tariums; $500,000 for lights and buoys,
etc. ; the estimates are increased.
But the greatest change, which has in
! creased the company's estimate of $69,
--893,660 to $133,472,893, ia caused by the in
creased units of cost, arbitrarily fixed.
The units of cost used by the company's
engineers are 30 to 40 per cent higher than
are being paid at the Chicago drainage
and ship canal, and, to the company s
figures, another 30 to 40 per cent is added
by tne commission! I may make two
comparisons to prove this: Chicago drain
age canal â Dredging per cubic yard, b l /> to
8 cents; rock excavation, 59 to 74 cents.
Nicaragua Canal Companyâ Dredging, 25
to 30 cents; rock excavation, $1 26 to $1 50;
Commission report â Dredging, 40 cents ;
rock excavation, $5.
The fact of a day's labor representing
less work in Nicaragua than at Chicago
or any other acceptable reason will not
explain these increased units of cost, es
pecially as the crude labor in Nicaragua is
payable in silver at about 40 per cent re
duction. The San Francisco Harbor Com
mission officially reports its dredging to
cost 6.87 to 12.97 cents per cubic yard, and
both coal and labor are higher here than
any part of the country, while the class of
dredges used by the Harbor Commission
is antiquated. Why should it cost 40 cents
gold in Nicaragua? More than ever be
fore, machinery will do the greatest part
of the work on the canal, and in hydraulic
work, which is impeded by ice and cold ,
weather at Chicago, machinery will cer- I
tainly do as much or even more work in I
Nicaragua, although it has to be taken ]
there, and fuel will cost somewhat more, i
The enormously increased units of cost
can only be explained on the basis of hav
ing "a dead sure" estimate, to secure pro
fessional reputation, and even then a con
tingency estimate of 20 per cent is added
to increase the figures to the total com
mission estimate. It is suggestive in this
connection that a responsible Chicago con
tracting firm has offered to construct the
western division of the canal for the com
pany's estimate, including the con
tineency, and to give bonds for faithful
performance. The Government can easily
test the matter by inviting bids in subdi
visions for the entire work, under proper
restrictions.
The mercantile mind, equally cautious
as that of tne engineer, has accepted the
cost of the Nicaragua canal as approxi
mating $100,000,000, and it iseasy to prove
that it will pay a handsome return on even
more than the commission estimate.
But a thorough knowledge of all con
ditions involved, resulting from an in
vestigation of years and of a thorough
personal acquaintance with the canal
route, justifies me in the opinion that con
tractors engaging for a completed canal at
$100,000,000 will make a proht of $10,000 000
to $12,000,000. Under conditions of con
struction, at times permitted by the
Government, it might cost more. But the
people of the United States are willing ;o
leave technical details to engineers. As
President Cleveland lately remarked to one
of our Congressmen, "The canal ia the
most popular work before our people," and
they demand its construction because it
has become a necessity, which will ulti
mately overcome all opposition. Even the
transportation interests that now oppose
it from the fear of competition will finally
admit its beneficent results to the prop
erties intrusted to their management? To
the Pacific Coast the canal means rapid
development, and this will increase the
prosperity of every inland transportation
interest.
San Francisco, March 24, 1896.
TO BUY CHINO RANCHO
Agents of an English Syndicate
Come for Final Settle
ment.
G. Wilding and J. V. Gilmore, of London,
representing a big English syndicate that
is making negotiations for the purchase of
the Chino Rancho of 40,000 acres in San
Bernardino County, arrived here yester
day and are at the Palace.
The visit of these two men is for the pur
pose of making final investigation into the
title of the property, and is believed to be
only a formality preparatory to the con
summation of the sale of the extensive
estate.
Some little time ago the ranch was put
in charge of Easton & Eldridge of this
City, with directions to sell it. Shortly
after taking charge Mr. Eldridge left for
England, where he purposed to interest
Enelish capital in the enterprise. The
price then understood was $1,600,000.
The return of Mr. Eldridge and the pres
ence of these representatives of an English
syndicate would indicate that the sale is
all but accomplished.
The idea of the English purchasers is to
subdivide the ranch and to form a colony
of settlers that will be brought out from
England to develop the land.
Several hundred acres of the ranch have
I for some time been devoted to the raising
of sugar beets, a factory for the extraction
of beet sugar being located on the place.
It is not, however, the intention of the
syndicate to buy the beet sugar industry
already in operation, but to extend the
cultivation of sugar beets throughout as
much of the section a3 is well suited to
that particular product.
If everything proves satisfactory the
| Englishmen will take possession at once,
paying the whole amount during the first
year, and not taking advantage of several
years originally suggested in the terms of
sale.

Little Mary, Pet of the Girls'
Training Home, in
Italy.
TRIED TO GET TO THE HILLS.
Work of Reclamation Being Done by
a Worthy Institution in the
Mission.
An oda little girl, with big, soft black
eves and a thoughtful face that might, as
far as seriousness goes, belong to a woman,
took steerage passage on one of the Atlan
tic liners the other day. A forlorn little
licure it was, notwithstanding the fact that
it was surrounded by a troop of other chil
dren, with dark Italian faces and large,
wondering eyes.
The child was "Little Mary," the former
pet and prodigy of the Girls' Training
Home of this City. Every one who has
visited that institution remembers Mary
Scravoni, the elfin child, with vivacious
manners and a queer history. '
Mary is the daughter of an Italian ash
man. She is the oldest child in a large
family, and a year ago she tired of her en
vironment. She grew tired of attending
the wants of little brown babies who, as
soon as they learned to understand Mary
and there was a curious language of pan
tomime established between them, were
duplicated by other and smaller human
copies. She used to look out at the green
hills, so near and yet so far to her rhildish
comprehension, and wish she were wan
dering over them, far from the stuffy little
room and the large-eyed crying baby.
One day when the newest baby was
asleep she put on her tattered hat and
started toward the hills. She wandered
along streets and tarried at shop windows
she had never seen. She crossed the street
just before an electric car that whizzed
past her so Quickly it made her head ache.
Then she hurried on to the stretch of
green just ahead and walked and walked
until she was tired and sank down to
Bleep. The hills were still at a distance
when she awoke, but a big blue-coated
policeman was leaning over her.
She was frightened at the sight and be
tween her sobs asked him to let her leave
him ana all those people and wander on to
the beautiful green hills. But be was re
lentless and the queer, fanciful child soon
found herself in a courtroom where her
sire, the ashman, was testifying that he
could not keep her at home, in fact that
she was incorr.gible.
She was committed to a prison-like
house where the children called her
"Mooneyes" and said she acted as though
she were asleep. So she slipped away
again and ran toward the hills that con
tained so much of promise to her. Like
Moses of old she was destined never to set
foot upon that alluring ground, for once
more a stern-voiced man with a silver star
on his breast overtook her.
Again she was brought into court, and
again declared incorrigible. This story
was repeated once, twice, thrice, indeed
many nine-;, until one day a kind lady
w.th a fair face and a sweet smile put her
arms about ncr and asked her why she
waa so naughty and persisted in running
away. Mary leaned her head on the ma
tronly shoulder and cried as she never
had before, while she told her story about
being tired of the house and the con
stantly recirring babies and of her longing
Jor tne wonderful, far-away green hills.
The lady's eyes were moist when she had
heard thVlast word of the pathetic little
story. She pushed back the tangled brown
hair an i touched Mary's forehead with
her lips. It had been a long time since
Mary had been kissed, aud thai little act
made her the good lady's willing subject
for life.
"Will you give up your trip to the hills
fora while and go with me to a home
where there are other girls, older and sad
der girls thanvou?" asked the lady, and
Mary nodded. She went with the lady to a
smail house on a quiet street where there
were other girls, some of them almost as
young as herself, but all with faces on
whicn were written characters little
Mary's pure, dreamy eyea could not de
cipher. The girls saw this and never per
mitted her to read the riddle. She was
not of them, although with them, and they
loved her for it.
"Little Mary" some one called her when
she made her debut in the queer circle,
and 'Little Mary" she will always be to
them. She never lost the old drtaminess,
but displayed an aptitude for reading and
applying what she read. The old book
that* man}' discard now was a newly dis
covered treasure to her. Strangely apt
were her quotations from it. "Man looketh
upon the outward appearance, but God
seeth the heart," she said when one of
the girls complained that her dress was
shabby.
"Fear no evil, for I am with thee," she
used to say when she encountered that
ogre of childhood, a dark room, and when â 
she looked away at the loved hills with the
hope that some day the ladies who were so j
kind to her would permit her to make that
long-deferred journey (she never thought I
of going without permission, now), she !
used to say, "I will look toward the hills
whence comet h my help."
Mary was happy now. She was peering
into the mysteries of learning and she was
learning the joys of thoughtfuiness for |
others.
Ladles who visited the home always
noted the eerie little face and elfish form,
and one of them talked vaguely of taking ;
"Little Mary" to her home as a companion j
for her children.
One day there was a sharp, sudden blow I
and Mary awoke from her happiness. Her j
sire, the'ashnian, presented himself at the i
neat, quiet home and demanded his j
daughter. The family was about to return ;
to Italy, and she must go with them.
There was no appeal from the parental
court. His rights had never been re
linquished. So Mary made ready for the
journey.
There was much weeping the night she
ieft. There was a quaver in the little
voice as it plead, "Dear Lord, make our
homes happy wherever they may be, but
yon know there is no other home 'zactly
like this." . i
And Mary went out into the rain and
the night, leaving happiness behind and
going forward to duty. Tne simple, pa
ihetic arnnals of the modest home at 26
Hill streer will never contain more touch
ing history, nor one more often recalled,
than that of "Little Mary."

THE STRIKERS' BENEFIT.
Fine Array of Professional Tal
ent for Next Wednesday
Night.
Nearly All the Seats in the Bush-
Street Theater Sold to Friends
of the Cause.
The benefit that the theatrical people of
this City propose to give to the striking
painters on next Wednesday evening
promises to be the best ever given on the
coast. Before the project was twenty-four
hours on foot there was enough volunteer
professional talent to run three shows.
Of ihose who were requested to take part
in the entertainment not one refused or
made an excuse for not being able to lend
a hand in the cause.
The idea of raiding money for the relief
of the striking painters originated with
W. Danielson, one of the hardest working
men in the cause of unionism. At first
the idea was not favorably received by the
strikers, who thought that it would be an
unprofitable venture, but Danielson would
not have it that way, for he said, '.'Boys, if
you will give me the authority to go ahead
I will secure taleVit, hire a theater and fill
it and it will not cost the union a single
cent. It will be a clear gain and before
this strike is over $-500 or $600 will not
come in amiss. Just tell me to go ahead."
Permission was given and the enthusi
astic fellow told to pick such a committee
las he desired to help him. The sum of
i $20 was also given to him for necessary
expenses. The committee he selected con
sists of T. J. Maloney, Robert Barber, A!
Feline and L. Taylor.
It was as Danielson said; there was
no trouble in securing the services of those
who sympathize with the laboring
man and it was with great care tnat
the selection of the artists was made by
j the committee.
The tirst selected was Frisky Barnett,
who is Known as t<e Tony Pastor of the
Wesf, and his wife, who is known in the
profession as Ida Clayton, the queen of
burlesque. This couple recently arrived
from the East and propose to open a the
ater of their own very soon. All the bene
fit they will keep tne audience laughing
with their local hits bearing upon the
strike. Barnett will officiate as stage
manager.
Gilbert and Goldie are also down on tne
bill. This team of comic artists is well
known to the public.
Another who is well known and of whom
the people never tire is Ellen Coursen-
Roeckef. She will introduce a Golden
We-t song, the "Banner of the Bear,"
composed by her husband, Professor
Roeckol, who will officiate at the piano.
Professor C. P. yon Ocr, a violin soloist
of no small pretensions, has consented to
appear in several selections.
Miss Annie Rooney, the balladist of
whom the boys sing so often, is also on the
programme.
An in i.erestiug feature will be introduced
in the shape of a team of athletes from the
Olympic Cluo.
One of the striking attractions will be
the Swedish Sing ng Society, eighteen in
number. It will be remembered that tuis
body of vocalists took the first prize at the
vocal contest at the World's Fair at Chi
cago.
By permission of L. Grover of the Al
cazar Miss Josephine Gassiuan, the special
| ty vocalist, will contribute her talent.
One ot the best friends the Painters'
I Union has is Professor T. W. Bree, the
banjo soloist. He will be there also.
No show was ever complete without an
Irish vocalist. Tnere will be one at the
benefit in the person of John T. Spickett,
who was among the first to offer his serv
ices.
H. P. Barbee, the silver-tone tenor, is
down for a number.
La Petite Rosa and Bertie Brightling are
both well-known to the public. They will ;
appear in their banjo soios and specialties.
Carter and Grenell, Irish comedians, |
Frank Silver and John Wyatt, the song j
I and dance team, Lillian Montgomery, the i
'vocalist; A..J. Holden, Thomas E. Leary
' and Misd Kittie Belmorein a "Night From
j Oliver Twist," and many other favorites
will also appear in their special roles.
It is predicted that tiie financial feature j
will be as successful as that of the profes- j
sional. The theater will hold about 1500 i
people and even at this early day the
larger part of the house is sold and but few j
tickets arc left. Carpenters' Union No. 22 j
started out by ordering 350 tickets and the ;
lroquois Club is down lor a goodly num- j
ber. Nearly all of the labor unions have j
' placed generous orders. All of the boxes j
have been sold to prominent people.
Like the talent the orchestra is also vol- â 
unteer and hrst-class, being the contribu- j
tion of the Musicians' Union. Prof. Jacob- i
son will be the leader. Kohler & Chase
have contributed the piano.
At 1 o'clock Wednes fay afternoon there
will be a rehearsal in the theater.
There will be no free liÂ«t and popular
prices are the order.
AT THE THEATERS.
The Attractions That Are to Be Offered
at the Different Theaters This
Evening-
This evening James O'Neill will make
his appearance at the Baldwin in "Monte
Cristo," a play that has made him famous
all over the United States. He will as
sume the leading character and will he
supported by a first-class company. This
is to be a souvenir night.
Milton Royle's company will open at the
California Theater with "Friends," a com
edy-drama that has already met with a
cieat >leal of success. Lucius Henderson,
a pupil of Joseffy, will appear in the char
acter of Adrian Karje. the pianist.
"Sinbad," that wonderful extravaganza
that never grows tiresome, will be con
tinued at the Columbia Theater this even
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1896.
ing and during the rest of the week. This !
production of Dave Henderson speaics for \
itself and the crowded houses testify to its
popularity.
At the Grand Opera-house this evening
there will be offered "The Red Pocket
book," a strong melodrama adapted from
the French, which is to be put on with
striking and novel stage effects. The cast
is an unusually large one, embracing about
lifty people.
The continuous performance at the Al
cazar this evening will include a number
of new dances and miscellaneous special
ties. "The Homestead" will be presented,
with Fanny Young and Leonard Grover
Jr. in the cast. "Passing Events" has
proved popular.
At the Tivoli Opera-house the manager
has decided to continue "Said Pasha" for
another week, so that will be the attrac
tion for this evening. Carrie Roma and
Anna Schnabel will, as in tne past, con
tinue to portray the leading feminine char
acters.
The many attractions that were offered
at the Orpheum Music Hall last week
proved so popular that it has been deter
mined by the management to continue the
same bill this week. This is one of the
very best bills that have been offered at
this house.
The Georgia Minstrels, genuine colored
men, are to open at the New Auditorium
Artists Who Will Appear Wednesday Night at the Benefit to Be Given to the' Striking Painters.
at Jones and Eddy streets to-night. Billy
Kersands, the "king-pin" of colored per
formers, will appear, as will also a number
of performers who are said to be artists of
the hrst rank.
At Macdonough's Theater in Oakland
Anna Eva Fay will open a four nights' en
gagement, during which she will present
the cabinet tricks and the other features
that have made her entertainments at
tractive.

SAN LEANDRO TRIANGLE
Ten-Mile Try-Outs of the Clubs
to Decide the Relay
Riders.
FASTEST TIME WAS 26:31.
The Bay City, San Francisco, Califor
nia and Imperial Clnb Men
Competed.
For the first Sunday in several weeks the
wheelmen had an opportunity to ride in
the country yesterday, and it was taken
advantage of by hundreds of them. San
Leandro and Haywards were the destina
tions of the majority on the Oakland side
of the bay, though some went farther, and
lunched at Centerville and even San Jose.
On this side a great many rode down to
San Mateo, and a large party of Olympic
Club Wheelmen, under Captain Fawcett,
went to Redwood City.
The country roads in every direction are
in much better condition than was ex
pected. Save for a few rough and gravelly
places the'ten-mile stretch from Fruitvale
to Haywards is perfect for bicycle riding,
and the road to San Mateo is good except
some portions of the bay road between
I here and San Bruno. There is such a
I heavy traffic on it between these points on
j account of the large number of vegetable
I gardens and dairies situated thereabouts,
i that ruts have been formed on each side,
! leaving a narrow ridge in the center upon
; which the wheelmen must ride, and even
| a good rider can only maintain a low rate
j of speed for the first dozen miles out of the
! City.
The attraction for the riders across the
bay yesterday was the several ten-mile try
) outs of clubs from this City wliich will
j enter teams in the great 100-mile relay
I race on April 12. Nearly all the clubs will
â  have these try-outs, for while it is easy for
j the various captains to name from five to
I eight of the men who will ride on their
respective teams, it is a hard matter to
choose the remaining number to make up
tne requisite ten men from each club, so
these try-outs are held to decide who
i among the many aspirants for positions
! on the relay teanis are entitled to tbe
I honor, for such it is most decideuly con
sidered, and the men showing the most
speed in these practice spins are the ones
from whom the choices are made.
What the wheelmen term "try-outs"
differ materially from scratch or handi
cap road races. In scratch events- all the
j men start from one mark at the same time.
i In handicap races the men who are known
j not to possess as much speed as others are
! allowed to start a little ahead, the handi-
I cap varying from three to four minutes in
i a ten-mile race. The man who is slowest,
I in the judgment of the handicapper, would
be given that much time allowance; the
next best man a few seconds less, and so
on in rotation, the best man starting last.
Generally in handicap races tlie scratch
men make best time while some man who
has a considerable time allowance
wins the race, and bia ability thus proven
insures him a position back near the
scratch mark in the next race.
But try-outs are entirely different, for
the men are started alone, one minute
apart, ride alone unpaced the entire dis
tance, and whatever time a rider makes
the distance in is credited to him. A man
ridinc ten miles in sny 27 or 28 minutes
would be a likely candidate for relay hon
ors, as he could probably be counted to do
as well or better in that race; while the
man dome no better than 30 or 31 minutes
would not be favorably considered, .as
most relays are ridden much faster than
that. Thus the men are "tried out" and
the speedy ones separated from the slow i
riders on their own merits.
The Bay City Wheelmen, San Francisco |
Road Club, California Cycling and Imperial j
Cycling Clubs all held try-outs at San i
Leandro yesterday, the men of the first
three clubs riding around the triangle and
the Imperials riding from Fruitvale
through San Leandro to Hay wards. The i
best time made by any one wa* that of G. !
Krafts, one of the Bay City Wheelmen, 26
minutes 31 seconds for t< n miles. The other
Bay City riders were Reynaud, Vincent,
Hall, DÂ»y, Languetin. Menne, Welis,
Hawks, Sheldon. Still, Griffiths and Mc-
Kay. McKay fell and Griffiths punctured
his tire, so neither finished. The times of
the other men were very fast, all under
twenty-eight minutes, but President Ker- j
riean would not announce them as he
wishes to keep the performances secret
until after the club's relay team, is com
pleted.
The California Club riders were Theisen,
Sternberg, Coulter, Williams, Thomas,
Cardinell, Pohr.-nann, Van Dyne, Wall,
Johnson, R.obbins, Madden, Coppin.
Cook and Tuttie. Captain Mayo took the
umes of the riders and will use them to
aid him in selecting the club's team. In
this try-out Johnson and Kobbins a'so
rose a special match race to decide who
was the better rider and finished a tie, so
that the question is still undecided.
Thiel, Goodwin, Friedlander, Lewis,
Kobert M. Mobius, Once Known as the "Socrates of the California Athens," Now
a Single-Tax Convert and on His Way to Assist in the Campaign in Delaware.
O'Malley, Farnsworth, Peiser, Korn and a
number of others rode for the San Fran
j cisco Road Club. Seven of the club's re
; lay riders are already selected, so that only
three were to be chosen from this lot. Cap
tain Pixley will announce his selections in
'. a few days.
The Imperial Cycling Club had the
greatest number of riders out for trial yes
; terday. The relay committee, consisting
i of Captain Catanich, Secretary Euan and
i Messrs. Burns and Miliett, decided that
any one wishing a place on the team,
must ride in the try-out and no one would
I be given a place who did not. This brought
| out all the good men and several rising
I stars in the racing world, as follows: C!a
brough, Cook, Mack, Langer, Metcalf, Gil
: bert Drotbers, Young, Manakie, Barley,
; May, Wiejiman, Cassasa. Boiree, Guiney,
; Perkins, Chapman, Flynn, E. Tooker.
I Morrin and Alborelle. Mack made the
best time, 27 minutes 28 seconds., with Al
borelle a close second. All the men fin
ished and none met with accidents, quite
i remarkable in itself.
After the races the men rode to Hay
wards and had lunch, and returned later
in the afternoon, singly and in groups,
each of the latter generally being led by
a tandem as pacemaker. There are fifteen
of these two-seaters in the Imperial Club
\ now. and the Bay Citys have fourteen.
i Tandem-riding is" a very popular style of
enjoying the sport, and the demand for
them is greater than the supply.
George H.Stratton and Henry F.Wynne
of the road pacing committee of the asso
ciated clubs rode over the last five relays
yesterday measuring the intermediate dis
tances accurately^ with cyclometers and
marking the starting and finishing points.
James Joyce Jr., Henry A. Goddard,
RoÂ«s E. Lozier, F. C. Cbandler, J. A.
Ostendorf and E. Edwin Stoddard rode to
I San Jose Saturday, returning yesterday.
They report the road 9on both sides of the
I bay in excellent condition.
The Acme Club wheelmen will hold
â  their try-out next Sunday at San Leandro
i to aid in the selection of their relay team.
I This club is looknd upon to finish in tirst,
I second or Inird position without fail, and
: the names of its riders will be watched for
with considerable interest by the pther
clubs.
The Liberty Cycling Club will hold an
! election to-morrow evening. The Em
I tracht Wheelmen had their first club run
i to the park yesterday under Captain Frank.
PALM SUNDAY.
The Day Celebrated With Interesting
Ceremonies in the Catholic
Churches.
Palm Sunday was celebrated with the
u?ual ceremonies that belong to the day
in all the Catholic churches of the City
yesterday. There was a large attend
ance at all tbe masses and palms were dis
tributed among the members of the con
gregation.
It was on this day that Jesus entered
into Jerusalem and the church distributes
green palm branches to commemorate the
event. The people went to meet Jesus
and in their enthusiasm scattered green
branches in his pathway. The ceremony
of blessing and presenting the palm to the
worshipers is a very simple one.
Holy week will De observed with the
usual ceremonies, recalling the suffering
and death of tne Lord. There will be
special services in the churches on next
Thursday, whith is Holy Thursday, Good
Friday and Easter Sunday
AID FOR STREET ARABS
Monsignor Nugent Speaks of
His Labors for Destitute
Children.
Says That Prevention and , Protec
tion Are More Effectual
Than Remedy.
Kight Rev. Monsignor Nugent of Liver
pool, Eng., addressed a large audience
yesterday at the Youths' Directory on
Howard street. The building was crowded
from the entrance door to the chapel and
probably five times many people were
unable to find even standing room.
Monsignor Nugent, whose remarkable
success in alleviating the hard condition
of the street arab has made him famous ail
over, the world, has the kindliest and !
sunniest manner, and it is not to be mar
veled at that boys take to him so readiiy. |
In the course of his remarks he related â 
the circumstances that led him to begin !
tuis movement for the benefit of the chil- t
dren who arc thrown on the streets of
great cities to fight their own way.
In 1864 he found that in Liverpool there j
were 40,000 boys roaming the streets with
no settled habits, and learning vice and
crime rather than honest means to pro
vide for themselves. â¢
He first hired an old abandoned theater
on Water street, Liverpool, into which he
gathered as many of these boys as he could
induce to come*. He ascertained their
names and found out the circumstances of
their poverty.
This being soon after the Crimean War
he was enabled to get at very reasonable
rates from the ships lying in harbor beds
and bedding for" the new home. Soon
after he persuaded the longshoremen
along the wharves to lay aside one penny
a week of their drink money for the sup
port of these boys.
This was the nucleus of a fund that con
stantly increased and from this humble
beginning has sprung the present Youths'
Directory.
The speaker said that boyg who have
been brought up in this home have filled
places of high honor and respectability
when they attained manhood. In fact he
meets them all over the world, men who
shako his hand and tell him they owe
their manhood to his endeavors. He ex
plained the system was one of prevention
and of protection rather than of remedy,
and said it was deserving of great assist
ance since it depends neither on the city
nor the State for its support.
A bamboo church organ is reported to
have been built at Shanghai, and it is said
to surpass organs made of metal.

Oakland's Boy Preacher to Teach
Single-Tax Theory in
Delaware.
HE IS A RECENT CONVERT.
A Talk With a Zealous Reformat
Who Sees Hope in Freedoa
of Land.
Robert M. Mobius is a recent valuable
acquisition to the forces of the single-tax
men of this City.
It may be said that he was no sooner
won than lost, for he goes to Delaware this
week to assist in the experimental and
educational campaign already under way
in that State.
Mr. Mobius is a unique figure among
politicians, in that he is a scholar and a
religious enthusiast. He has investigated
various reformatory measures of the day
and is firm in hid conclusion that the
single tax is the only solution of economic
problems. He will give his farewell ad
dress at Foresters' Hall on Wednesday
evening.
The young manâ he is but 26 years of
age â who has been called the "boy
preacher" and the 'Socrates of the Califor
nia Athens," is a grave, dignified youth,
with a thoughtful face and the air of a
student rather than an active participant
in affairs. He impresses one with his
earnestness and sincerity of purpose, and
! looks like a man who is capable of giving
i the best efforts of bis Jife to a cause he may
espouse.
Such is his intention. He is alive with
zeal for the campaign and hopefully
prophetic of its outcome.
â¢*I believe it will be an epoch-making
campai n," he said. "It will be to the
world of economics what the heliocentric
theory was to astronomy. It will mark
the reign of justice and equity, and of
industrial freedom. It will be a rapid
evolution.
"I have found socialism faulty," he ob
served, "because it appears to me to be
l>ased upon materialism. It would seem
to resort to coercion and forcible means,
and so with other movements in the direc
tion of reform. They are assailable, while
the single tax is in; pregnable."
Mr. Mobius is a native of Leipsic and a
student of the university of that city. He
had nearly completed the classical course
of that institution when he resolved to come
to America to escape being drafted into
the army. "I loathe the idea of war," he
said.
Primarily, perhaps, his object is to brmg
his fellow-man into closer relation with
the divine principle.as he puts it in his met
aphysical phraseology. "I find the most
intelligent peopie of the day lean toward
agnosticism," he said. "Materialism is
unlovely to them. Religion is veiled.
Hence they stop at agnosticism. I believe
when the environment of the masses be
comes more favorable to spiritual growth
there will be such growth. Institutional
reform first, then individual reform."
MAX MEYFR SHOT.
Frank Bliller Regents an Insult With a
Bullet.
Frank Miller, the night bartender of the
ABC saloon at the northwest corner of
Keamy and California streets, shot Max
Meyer, an auctioneer, through the point of
the shoulder as the result of a barroom
row yesterday morning. Miller claims
that Meyer was drunk and accused him of
stealing' a cane. Miller denie 1 this, and
in a few minutes Meyer returned with the
cane and asked Miller for a revolver. Mil
ler refused and Meyer hit him in the
mouth and called him a vile name. Mil
ler then shot and the ball entered Meyer's
left shoulder.
Miller immediately went to his home at
1117 Jones street. Lieutenant Esola fol
lowed soon after and placed him under
arrest for assault to kill. Miller at first
denied that he had done the shooting.
Meyer, who is an auctioneer at 425 KearÂ«
ny street, was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital. The bullet, which was from a 32
--caliber revolver, was extracted and the
wound will not prove serious.
She Landed on Her Neck.
Little Miss Ruby Skiff, 6 years of age, of 104
Fair Oaks street was playing "see-saw" in her
back yard yesterday afternoon and she fell.
At the Receiving Hospital it was found she
bad sustained a tracture of the right collar
bone.

The only way for Democracy to get a

Cleveland's objection to middle-aged
ladies riding the bicycle has not led to any
attack from the ladies, so the conclusion
is clear that none of them feel themselves
included in that class.
Bayard may pretend to take no notice of
the censure of the House of Representa
tives, but all the same he is talking neither
so much nor so loosely as he was, and it
is clear that he felt something hit him,
with a sobering effect.
. The people having shown signs of weari
. ness over the frequent iteration of the
phrases "sound money" and "honest
money," an attempt has been made in the
East to relieve the strain by setting up a
cry for "untarnished money."
A London newspaper commenting on
the rapid growth of the smoking habit
among the ladies of that country says it
is becoming as common in England as ."it
is among Americans," and now we know
how well we are understood abroad.
While eighty per cent of all women who
attain a marriageable atre elect to marry

twenty per cent of college-bred girls are
willing to take the risk, and it would seem
they regard their learning either as a cau
tion or else as a self-sufficiency.
A bill has been introduced into the Mas- j
sachusetts Legislature requiring all money

indignantly as an attempt at petty larceny.
: We have already six first-class battle

least eighteen, and the chances are he is
.right.
Charles C. Harrison, Provost of the
University of Pennsylvania, has just given
to that institution the sum of $500,000 to
establish twenty-seven scholarships, the
object being to group around the univer
sity a number of men devoted to the ad
vancement of learning who will live
among the students and exert an influ
ence in the direction of higher scholar
ship.
The naval appropriation hill as arranged
by the committee of the House provides
for one battle-ship and . one torpedo-boat
to be constructed on the Pacific ' Coast- "if
the cost is not excessive,", but there is no
such provision in regard to those to be
built on the Atlantic Coast. This does
not look like a square deal, but perhaps
our ? hipbuilders can meet the conditions
and win out anyhow.
THE MERCHANTS' PLANS.
The published correspondence between
the Superintendent of Streets and the
I "Merchants' Association discloses the fact
that the current year's municipal funds
available for street improvements do not
permit of good downtown pavements, and
that while the Superintendent will labor
with the Board of Supervisors for a suf
ficient levy for next year the Merchants'
Association will perfect a scheme of down
town improvements and be ready to see
that the money is employed to the best,
advantage.
The people of the City have come to re
gard the Merchants' Association as a most
useful agency, especially in matters re
lated to street improvements. It is com
posed of practical, hard-hea<ied business
men, who cannot be cajoled into the be
lief that public funds are intended for po
litical plunder, or that they should be used
;iny differently from private funds. In
tihe scheme of the organized merchants
â¦ here lias appeared no suspicion of politi
cal ambition. All that it has done means
that it recognizes the public value of good
streets and sewers anu the necessity for an
honest and intelligent expenditure of
municipal funds. For these reasons its
labors and hopes command respect and co
operation. Every merchant of good stand
ing in the City would show nimself a use
ful citizen by joininc the association.
The task which nbw confronts the mer"
chajits is ililh'cult and delicate. They must
not only exert their influence to keep the
ta*x levy within safe limits, and to that end
exercise patience and care in constructing
their plan for downtown improvements,
but they have an opportunity for perform
ing a valuable service in mastering the
whole subject of pavements. This should
not be left to the political exigencies of the
Street Department. In every city, particu
larly one that is growing, the demands for
public expenditures are so urgent that the
opportunity for securing political benefits
out of them are tempting. Contractors
represent another influence equally potent.
The evils obtaining in San Francisco re
sult in poor improvements requiring con
stant expenditure to maintain them, and
that is one of the reasons why cobbles s'ili
retard business and depress property val
iies in the downtown section. To educate
the people regarding the best pavement for
each purpose, to see that, the work is faith
fully and intelligently done, to guard
against the neglect of important public in
terests centering in boulevards and out
side improvements and to keeo the tax
levy for all tbe3e purposes within bounds
constitute the task of the Merchants' As
sociation.
A MODIFIED EVIL.
A few days ago a iarmer near Lockeford
made a small opening in the levee of the I
Mokelumne River for some harmless pur
pose. Unexpectedly the river became
greatly swollen by a heavy storm in the !
mountains, and before the small out could
be stopped the pressure of water had ;
widened it to a crevasse and large areas of â 
cultivated land were flooded. It was !
feared that many thousands of dollars rep- ''â 
resented by growing crops had been lost,
but it is now learned that no damage was
done by the submersion, and on the con
trary that a considerable benefit had re
sulted â the Hooding furnished just the
amount of irrigation needed to insure good
crops.
Of course this happy result was a mere
accident. The danger lay In the fact that
its elements were not under control. The
accident was made possible by the fact
that the bed of the river had been raised
by ihe deposition of silt brought down
from the mountains, where hydraulic
mining, farming, natural erosion and de
nudation by timber-cutting had exposed
the soil to the loosening action of frosts
and the washing effect of rains. Levees had
to be constructed to conflue the river to its
bed. As the river thus ran in a channel
higher than the level of the contiguous
country the cutting or breaking of the
levee during high water would result in
the floodine of the land. This is a danper !
appertaining to rivers besides the Mokel
umne, and that is the main reason why i
hydraulic mining is opposed by land
owners in the valley.
But the important lesson has been
learned in recent years that irrigation is
essential to the best results in California
farming. Millions of capital have been in
vested in irrigating systems, and the use
of the privilege means an addition to the
expenses of farming. It is a curious turn
of affairs which presents the "rivers ruined
by hydraulic mining" In the light of ex
cellent facilities for irrigation without an
enormous outlay for dams, reservoirs and
fiunies. As the streams run along ridges
through the valley it is possible to make
the levees safe and provide them with
headgates, which would serve not only to
relieve the heavy pressure on their banks,
but also to lead the water through canals
and ditches to the thousands of farms
needing irrigation. The management of
the rivers is yet in a very crude state, but
in ali plans looking to the development of
their usefulness it might be well to con
sider whether their value as irrigating ar
teries might not be made one of the most
important considerations.
JAPAN AND RUSSIA.
That the Imperial Government of Japan
should send so imposing a delegation to
the approaching coronation of the Russian
Czar should be a matter of considerable
interest to Europe, the United States and
China. The delegation, now at San
Francisco on Its way to Russia, is
headed by Marquis Yamagata, the fore
most soldier and diplomat of Japan, and
additional respect is shown to Russia by
the inclusion of a royal prince in the suite.
It will be noted with interest that the del
egation is making a considerable stay in
San Francisco, the nearest point of the
United States to Japan, and that the dis
tinguished Japanese visitors have selected
the longest possible route to St. Peters
burg.
It might be assumed that this choice
presented a far more diversified and inter
esting trip tnan the one by way of the
Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, as it will
take the travelers through the heart of
modern civilization. Japan is eager to ac
quire knowledge of the great world whose
inspiration has begun to stir her energies,
but at the same time she is seeking a prof
itable outlet for ihe products of her over- i
crowded population, and already Califor- i
nia has felt the initial pinch of that |
pressure. While the adoption in Japan of
American and European processes of man
ufacture will result eventually in modify-:
ing the squalor of her working hordes by
enabling them to live better on the unac
customed profits which they will enjoy,
every good thing which will come to them
will be yielded up by the workers of the

that Marquis Yamagata will not neglect

with ice the greater part of the year is not
sufficient to explain the enormous expen
ditures required for the transcontinental
railroad. Of late Russia has been show
ing a linely gloved, but none the less pow
erful, hand in various quarters. She
checked the aggressive English sentiment
that was stirred np by the Armenian
atrocities, and that episode quickly flat
tened out, leaving Russia as Turkey's
friend. Just now the Russian Minister to
Fiance has successfully demanded that the
French Minister of Foreign Affairs be re
quired to resign because of his conduct in
Northern African affairs, and we are in
formed that the same Russian Minister is
to be quartered at Nice with Lord Salis
bury to watch the progress of events on
the Red Sea.
Such an alliance between Russia and
Japan, aa Marquis Yamagata's expedition
seems to indicate, would be an essential
part of Russia's ganeral policy to become
the dictator of Europe. That the Czar's
great nation, hardly yet emerged from a
savage state, should use the weakness of
Turkey and the strength of Japan in for
warding her ambition presents &n curious
a study as does the independent struggle
of Japan to make western civilization pay
dearly for the benefits she aims to secure.
SAN FRANCISCO'S TRADE.
The volume on the commerce and navi
gation of the United States for the fiscal
year 1895, issued by the Bureau of Sta
tistics, shows some very interesting things,
summarized in the following comparative
statement of percentages:
Per ct. of Per ct. of Per ct. of
Exp. <fc Imp. Imports. Exports.

Naive* on ...... 2.74 .05 6.19
Savannah 1.30 .06 2.55
Chicago 1.08 2.0H .19
Baltimore's large exports over imports
are explained by its heavy shipment of
corn, while cotton created a similar condi
tion of things at New Orleans and Gal
veston. San Francisco sent abroad mostly
the products of California, while Balti
more, New Orleans and Galveston drew
their exports from a very large section of
the country, containing a population
twenty times as large as thntof California.
San Francisco accomplished this under
the most unfavorable conditions, among
them a monopoly of steam transportation
and a virtual absence of sailing vessels
except those carrying wheat. A large pro
portion of our imports was for transcon
tinental rail forwarding, and hence this
feature of the case presents no greater in
terest than the fact that with the excep
tion of tea, coffee and silk California has
little use for the products of countries
sending supplies to the United States.
hat is to say, while California produces
a wide range of articles for export suitable
to the needs of all countries, it contains
within itself resources which make it
practically independent of all other coun
tries. The articles which it produces in
clude most of the staples, such as all food
supplies, and such luxuries as fruit, wine
andtheiiKe. A full development of the
resources at our command will follow a
larger settlement and more favorable con
ditions of transportation and make us in
dependent of all countries except those
which produce coffee, tea and spices.
It is difficult to imagine the magnitude
of these facts. Considerations affecting
our welfare are profound in themselves,
but from a National point of view they
should have an overwhelming significance.
The trouble is that our country as a whole
: has not yet discovered California, â  nor
formed the vaguest idea either of its value
as a producing section or as the country's
gateway to the Orient. In this blessed
year 1896 the private interests of a single
railroad company are more tenderly re
garded by. Congress than the vast National
interests which center in California.
COAST EXCHANGES.
No sooner had the petroleum wells of
Los Angeles been developed than there
sprang ud a heavy demand for this valu
able fuel. Contracts were quickly made
for large quantities of oil and stens were
taken in various places to change furnaces
from coal-burners to oil-burners. This
eager demand led to the formation of the
Los Angeles Oi' Exchange, which began
systematically to adjust the supply to the
demand by making prices a factor. The
Los Angeles Journal thus tells the story:
"When the present management of that
organization took hold of the nil export
business the market was thoroughly de
moralized and sales in some instances
were being made at the ruinous pr.ee of
25 cents per barrel at the well tank 1 -. In
one instance as large a quantity as 10,000
barrels was sold at 28 cents per barrel.
From this state of utter demoralization
the exchange gradually advanced prices
until now it is making sales at 80 cents per
barrel aboard cars. This price is a little
better than 70 cents per barrel at the well
tanks."'
AH this had an effect ,in stimulating re
searches for oil. At the present time great
activity is going forward in the extension
of the output at Los Angeles, but the
work is by no means confined to that sec
tion. The Pasadena Star gives the history
of the Central Oil Company, organized
with a capital of $100.000 to bore for oil
near Whittier and San Gabriel. It is sink
ing its first well at Whittier, and although
it has strucK oil it is toing deeper for a
larger (low, with every prospect of finding
it. Meanwhile, according to the Visalia
Delta, the work of boring for oil on the
West Side, near Huron, is progressing en
ergetically and oil is flowing in generous
quantities.
As might have been expected, the oil in
dustry is giving rise to others. The Los
Angeles Herald tells about the Inventors'
Manufacturing Company at North Pasa
dena, organized to manufacture a new oil
bu rner for using petroleum. Says our ex
change: "The patent oil burner is used in
the factory for all heating purposes. The
fuel to run the four-horsepower engine
by this process only costs 20 cents a day,
and a temperature of 900 degrees required
to melt the brass which is used in manu
facturing the burner can easily be ob
tained."
The San Bernardino Sun details an in
teresting discovery which indicates the
surprises that are constantly being en
countered by those who seek to find the
treasures which California holds. Per
sons drilling a seven-inch well on
the Balfour-Guthrie land met a
strong pressure of water at a depth
of 500 feet. Our contemporary says:
"The result is that a perfect creek of al
most boiling water is forming a channel
for itself across the lowland. The water
rises in a solid stream five inches in diam
eter to a height of several inches ahove
the mouth of the pipe. It is so strongly
impregnated with sulphur and other chem
ical properties that the surrounding air is
filled with the unpleasant odor whicb ia
usually attendant upon springs and wells
of this character. The water retains an
average temperature of 108 degrees, which
is almost up to the limit of heat attained
by the Arrowhead Springs; it will readily
cook an egg, and its properties are sutri
c:ent to cure many forms of diseases which
find a remedy in mineral waters."
The Visaiia Delta is happy over the de
cision of the Valley road directors to run
the first arm of the road through Visalia
on its way from Fresno to Bakersfield,
and suggests that a grand celebration of
the event be made. That Visalia's pros
perity is assured is evidenced by this addi
tional information furnished by the Times:
"There was never such a prospect for a
fruit crop in Tuiare County as there is to
day. It is. not at all unlikely that twenty
times as much fruit will be shipped out of
Visalia this season as was ever shipped in
one season before. This will mean the
employment of an immense number of
people during the fruit season, and the
circulation of a large amount of money.
A good rain to help the grain-growers
would make the outlook exceedingly en
couraging for every industry in this
county."
For a time after the first flush years in
the California orange industry the growers
fell upon evil days. Profits ceased and
with them an extension of planting. Then
the growers organized and through intel
ligent co-operation have found a ready
market at profitable prices. The latest
effect of this prosperity following organi
zation has been a revival of planting.
The San Bernardino Times-Index says:
"The supply of orange nursery stock, par
ticularly of navels, is practically ex
hausted. Such a state of affairÃ has not
arisen in Southern California in many
years, and indicates that a phenomenally
large acreage has been set to oranges this
year, and that confidence in the future of
the orange industry is firoier than ever.
During the last two weeks the demand has
begun to assert itself, large orders coming
in which could not be filled for the reason
that the trees were not to De had. This
applies, of course, to navels. Of Medi
terranean sweets and Valenciaa there is
still a supply. Estimates made last fall
â indicated that there #were 300,000 young
orange trees in the hands of the nursery
men in the orange belt, and of these
250,000 were navels." Our contemporary
notes that one colony in Sacramento
County has ordered 20,000 trees. As re
gards prices for oranges it says: "The
price is very satisfactory. Mediterranean
sweets were quoted at $1 65 per box a few
weeks ago, wnile now they command $2 50,
with a very strong market. Navels are
still bringing top prices, but the supply is
limited."
The Oroville Register, after noting the j
extensive operations of the fruit canneries â 
at Biggs, Griuley. Marys and Chico, i
adds: "There is an opening, however, for j
a variety of products that will sell well, i
can readily be put up and always com- j
mand fair' prices. We refer to vinegar, i
mustard, chow-chow, sauerkraut, pickles, j
horseradish, marmalade and other prod- i
ucts of a similar character. The canneries '
have the room, have the steam power and I
they employ the superintendents all the
year round. The profits certainly ought
to be larger than in canning fruit, for j
there is nothing like opposition in the class j
of goods we allude to that there' is in fruit. !
Most of the pickles, much of the mustard
and goods of that kind are manufactured
in Europe and sent here. We feel confi- j
dent the industry couid be made to pay 5
handsomely, and would consume much !
material that could be produced in the
vicinity of the canneries."
The San Bernardino Times-Index men- I
tions the visit of a canaigre syndicate, re- j
cently formed, of Chicago, New York and
foreign capitalists, and says: "It is known ]
that the general purpose of the syndicate 1
is to establish an immense canaigre farm' I
and plant, sucn as it already owns near j
fhcenix, Ariz., and it has already been !
stated, although not authoritatively, that
the plans contemplate the establishment
of tanneries in this valley. However, the
capitalists are sufficiently interested that
they are investigating in person or by
trusted agents, and that is the object of
the visit of the party now at Rialto."

WEATHER PROBABILITIES STAMP.
The Washington Postofflce is soon to inaugu
rate a new feature in the way of stamping
letters, says the correspondent of the Brooklyn
Eagle in that city. All mail matter received
in the postoftiee for distribution will, in addi
tion to having the date and time of its receipt
placed on the back of it, contain a forecast of
the weather conditions for the following day.
This novel scheme originated in the brain of
The New Po;tul Stamp.
Postmaster Willet, and is to be put Into opera
tion with theconsentoi the Postmaster-! ieneral
and the co-operation of the Weather Bureau.
Twelve stamps constructed with a view to the
new work have been ordered, and as soon an
they are received they will take the place of
the old ones.
l'iie new stamps are very much like the old
o:n\ having been considerably enlarged, in
order to give space for the insertion of thr
weather fuieeast. In the outer ring there are
four spaces inio which will be set the type
predicting the state of t lie weather for the fol
lowins day. These type contain the following
words: "Colder, warmer, frost, cold wave,
cloudy, fair, cola, rain and snow," and when
in position will make an impression similar to
the reproduction below. The new scheme is
expected to meet with much favor, and before
long all the postmasters in the large cities will
probably be asking for the stamps containing
the weather forecasts. The stamps cost i?H
each, and as from 200 to 300 of them would be
needed for the principal postofiices of the
country, it will require a considerable sum io
supply them.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
UNLIMITED POWER..
How the Wind Might Bk Utilized to Drive
the Machinery op thk City.
To the Editor of the. San FrancUco Callâ Sir:
Very few people ever think that hÂ«re In San
Francisco we have the most reliable and avail
able power for all purposes known. It is
simply the constant wind that blows in from
the ocean over our City, sutllcient anu a
thousand times to spare to supply all the
motive power required in the world. Its
sourca is everlasting. Its possihili ties are be
yond comprehension and will afford food for
thoughtful investigation.
Five thousand years ago the Egyptians made
use of the wind to pump water to grind their
'corn and for other purposes.
Only think for a moment what can be ac
complished by the currents of the winds, on
which there arc no riparian rights to light or
that no monopoly could claim or control.
They are free for all and cost nothing. Wind
engines of any capacity could be erected at
elevated points to drive airpumps and com
pressors; the compressed air can be stored in
large receivers and be distributed like gas and
water to all who require power for any pur
pose, even to generating electricity for illu
minating purposes. It could be used in plan
ing mills, furniture factories, foundries, ma
chine-shops, elevators In buildings, printing
offices, for pumping waterâ in fact, everything
that power is used for, with no danger from
fire.
I iiflievt impossible and feasible to construct
a plant on the top of some large building at a
cost of less than $5000 that would be of suf
ficient capacity to furnish every building in
the block with power to run electrical motors
for illuminating, pumps to supply all the
buildings with pure water, elevators and all
kinds of machinery; besides, a current of air
could be provided "for carbureters containing
tramline buried in the ground that would fur
nish the cheapest and cleanest fuel in the
world, with no riak whatever.
Ii it was possible to introduce such an enter
prise it would create new industries and new
wants and give employment to thousands of
Idle men.
If any plan can be devised that will cheapen
the cost of our necessities, light, heat and
water, besides cheap power for manufacturing,
the conditions are more favorable for the ma
jority and better for the whole community, Â«s
the money saved the laboring man leaves him
more to spend in trade.
Compressed air perhaps is the coming power
that will even relegate our ponderous locomo
tives to the scrap-pile.
The use, introduction and development of
electricity has interested and absorbed the at
tention of most of our inventors to the exclu
sion of every other field. Electricity is won
derful, but then lots of it can be made by
using the wiud for the purpose. Perhaps these
few lines may induce some one to think over
the subject. It is said an idea is never lost to
the world, but it may slumber a long time be
fore it is acted upon. David B. James.
A MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAIN.
For the last half century the American resi
dents of Tucson, Ariz., have been trying to
solve a mystery in the shape of what appears
to be a hole through a mountain peak in plain
sight from the town. In the clear raritied air
it looks to be only a short distance away, when
in reality it is at least forty miles. The
earliest residents noticed the phenomenon,
and the only difficulty that lay in the way of
finding out just what it was was the fact that
it was Inaccessible, and when they came any
where near the spot the hole disappeared from
sight. In fact, it can only be seen from within
a few miles of Tucson, and this has led many
people to believe that it is not a hole at all.
By the aid of a good marine telescope the
mountain can be brought to within a few
The Hole Through the Mountain.
miles, but not near enough to tell the exact
nature of the rock formation. An astronomi
cal telescope cannot be focused on it, as the
mountain is too near. A first peep through
thegicss would Ipad one to believe that there
was no mystery about it. The hole appears as
plain as possible, but several days' study of the
spot wlli develop ttie fact that the "hole" does
not always look the same Many days when
the sky isdark behind the mountain the hole
will appear a brilliant white, like a snowdrift,
ar.d (in days when the sky is blue it will often
look so dark bk to be almost invisible. These
facts have led many to think that it is an im
mense piece o( mica lying with its jiolished
surface toward the sky and reflecting the cloud
formatl'iDs of anoth?r part of the horizon in-,
stead <if beine the light seen through a hole.
Viewed with "the naked eye the hole simply
appeiirn as a white spot, but the telescope re
veals pine trees and other details, although
very indistinctly.
The range of mountains in which the strange
peuk can be seen is known as the Catalnias
and numerous parties have made the attempt
to climb it. but all have failed on account of
thÂ«* Bte*to and ru?=red precipices in the vicinity.
Ths peak is a hign one and can be seen from
nny point in the journey toward it, but when
ten miles out of Tucson the hole can no longer
be seen even with trie aid of a glass. This can
be explained on the mica theory, as a surface
oj that material would not reflect a ray of
light toward a person's eye after they got out
of its angle of projection.
One man in TndsOt) claims to have climbed
the peak and looked through the hole into a
valley on the other side. For some reason he
always refused to take a party up there, and as
he could never tell what he saw in the valley
nor even direct others how to get there his
story was not believed. And so the mystery of
the "mountain remains unsolved, and in the
opinion of old prospectors alway- will until
somebody invents a flying-mnehine.
AN ATTRACTIVE COSTUME.
The waist shown here is especially adapted
to making very handsome parts of costume*,
or separate waists, tiecauÂ«e the box-pleats are
separate, and can thus be made of a different
material from the material of the body.
For a gown of green tnffeta9, black chiffon for
the body will be found a stylish contrast, mak
ing the box-pleats and sleeves of the silk to
inntch the skirt.
A gown of crepon is pretty made with a top
of lace r>ut on under the box-pleats, as shown
here. Or the body may be of silk, either plain
or embroidered, for either a silk or crepon
gown.
A dress of dark blue crepon with the box
pleats replaced by bands of linen hemstitched
on both edges', is exceedingiy stylish.
For extra waists to wear with black skirts,
any color is pretty with black chiffon for tiie
b<niy.
The skirt is exceedingly graceful, and per
haps the most popular model of all the sea
son's skirts. It Is a bell skirt with godet effect.
The style is very suitable for separate skirts as
well as for costumes of one material.

At the Tracksâ G., Crescent City, Cal.
The California record for a half mile is47J4
seconds. No charge is made at either of the
racetracks for stalls, but to send a horse here
and have him trained would cost the owner
about $G0 a month. Horses frequently work
out halves in 48 1 â ', and 49 seconds. A 49-horse,
half mile, â¢would he of no use at either track in

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
A Longshoreman Found on the
Street Badly Cut Sunday
Morning.
THE ROSS-MUNGER CHARGES.
Inspection and Drill by the Naval
Battalion on Board the Moni
tor Comanche.
A lonsr^horeman and stevedore known
on the water front as Paddy Clark was
found by Police Officer Beane near the
corner of Steuart and Folsom streets early
yesterday morning. He was lyiug on the
ground intoxicated and bleeding from deep
knife cuts across the head and face. He was
literally wallowing in his own blood, and
it seemed that most all of the vitril fluid in
his body had run out through the fright
ful gashes he had received. At the Receiv
ing Hospital he was found to have been
out fifteen timesâ seven on the head and
face, one a deep slash from cheek to cheek,
extending bad: of the ear; there were two
on the neck, three on the right wrist, which
severed the tendons, ar.d several on the
right hand, evidently received while ward
ing oft the murderous blows struck at his
life.
Clark and two seafaring men, one of
them a sailor from the revenue cutter
Rush, were seen along tne water front sa
loons late Saturday night. They were in
liquor, and, as is usual with drunken sail
ors, quarreling and hugging each other al
ternately. Clark had a knife which he had
taken away from the unknown third man,
and the weapon was the topic of much
loud contention. The knife was given back
to iis owner, and they all went into Riiey's
saloon on Folsom street, near Main, where
Clark ordered tne drinks. He wanted to
"do the square thing/h e confided to the
barkeeper, and offset his earlier disagree
able actions toward|his two friends.
The thing was; hardly square, however,
for Clark, as a matter of course, had no
money, and the barkeeper ran the three
into the street. Clark was found shortly
after by the police orticer bleeaing from
bis wounds, proving that war had broken
out again and Ciark had got the knife in a
different manner.
Jtmong the revenue cutter officers the
recent report of Captain Healy's dismissal
from the service is not believed. The de
partment would notify the commanding
officers of the fleet, and the news would be
known among the cutter Meet as soon if j
not sooner than the public. Not a word j
has been heard of the Lieutenant Ross j
charges against Captain Munger.
1: will be remembered that the younger !
oiricer wrote to the Treasury Department !
accusing his superior with drunkenness :
and unoftioerlike conduct while in Bering j
f<ea. Ro.-s was the executive officer of the <
vesssl, and it is stated that while Munger .
was drunk in his berth at sea the snip ;
wa< sailed by tne lieutenant, who was vir- .
tually her commander.
"Ross" charges are as true as holy writ,"
is the testimony of several persons who \
claim to be eyewitnesses of toe facts men- ;
tioned in the lieutenant's communication.
"Monger is ten times more guilty than
Healy and it will be a burning shame if .
the department ignores those char-res.
Ross knows justwmtf he is talking about ;
and he also knows that he can prove every- ;
thing alleged in that paper. The whole '
cutter Meet will go to sea the first part of ;
next month and the witnesses against i
Captain Munger will be scattered. The '
department should have begun an in
quiry into the charges immediately after ;
the trial of Captain Healy, but months \
have gone by and Munger not only con- j
tinues to emoy the confidence of his
superiors at Washington but he occupies a !
responsible position in the service up the
Sound. He must have some mighty pull
somewhere."
It is the consensus of opinion among
the officers of the revenue cutter fleet that i
Lieutenant Ross will have no difficulty in j
substantiating every charge he has made.

Reserve with his division went aboard of '

Count and Countess J. Pourtales arrived

They are on a little pleasure trip, and
after spending nearly a week in seeing the
sights of San Francisco and vicinity they
purpose to return to their home in Colo-
r ado Springs.
Count Pourtales is a tall, well-built,
j active -looking man, perhaps a little past
50 years of age. His ruddy face, partly
covered by a full, round, grayish beard,
his tortoise-bound spectacles and his gen
; eral appearance might stamp him as a
German scientific explorer. Trie Count is
a German ; but he is a mining man.
Ten year 3 ago he came to the United
States from tire State of Silesia, Ger
many, where he still owns some large
agricultural properties. Shortly after his
arrival he paid a visit to California, but
though he has traveled extensively since
i then and has made several visits to the
fatheriand this is only his second trip to
the coast.
He laughingly avoided any conversation
turned toward* his rank, his connections:
in Germany, or the romantic possibilities
of some ancestral castle, and declared that !
he is simply a business man and that he j
and his wife arc taking one of their little j
pleasure trips.
â¢ I am interested in mines in Cripple

About twenty claims, and is now yielding
$30,000 a month. I still own my original

"Cripple Creek to-day is a place of about
30,000 inhabitants, although some say
40,000, but that is too large an estimate.
"Last year the gold yield for the district '

ADIEU, FIRST INFANTRY
Colonel Shatter's Regiment of
Regulars Slated for
Transfer.
THE FOURTEENTH COMING.
More Money Authorized for Improv
ing the Presidio â Code of
Whistle Signals.
Word comes from Washington that the
comnianaing general of the army has re
solved to transfer several regiments of in
fantry at the beginning of the next fiscal
year, July 1. In army circles in and about
San Francisco the coming event is the
chief topic of comment, for it seems that
the First Infantry, Colonel William R.
Sh after, is slated for transfer.
Companies A, B and G of this regiment
are stationed at lienicia barracks, and
Companies C, D, E, F, I and X, together
with headquarters, lield, staff and band at
Angel Island. Company H is on duty at
San Diego barracks.
The Fourteenth Infantry, Colonel T. M.
Anderson, at Vancouver barracks, Wash
ington, is slated to reiieve the First in this
department Since 1?69 the Fourteenth
has served in Arizona, Tennessee, Ken
tucky, Dakota, Utah, Nebraska, Wyoming
and Washington. The regiment has been
on duty in Washington for the past eleven
years.
The First Infantry has served in the
Department of California for ten years
and during tnat time officers and enlisted
; men have become sincerely attached to
S^n Francisco. They will leave the sthtion
! with regret, but with most delightful
memories of Angel Inland and Benioiu.
It is given out semi-offieially that the
First will relieve the Fourth Infantry,
now on duty in Idaho and Washington.
Other regiments listed for transfer are
the Second, Fifteenth, 8 ixteenth and
Twenty-fourth Infantry. The Fifteenth,
which has been stationed at Chicago for
many years, will likely be sent to the
Southwest. The regiment is thought to
need that sort of discipline which service
on the plains impart.
Colonel A. S. Kimball, chiel quarter
master Department of California, has
received an authorization from the
quartermaster-general to expend $26,000
for filling in the marsti land of the Pre
sidio reservation. The tillinp will extend
west from Lyon street, the east boundary
of the reservation, to the road which
leads from the post of the Presidio proper
to the wharf.
The Fair estate is to fill west as far as
Baker street, and the owner of the marsh
ground between Baker and Lyon streets,
George Whittell, is making arrangements
to till in on his property. Lyon street will
then be graded from Lombard street to the
bay.
There will remain for future filling on
the Presidio about forty acres of swamp
or marshy ground west of the road lead
ing from the post to the wharf.
Colonel KiinbaU deserves special credit
for the comprehensive manner in which
he has placed tiie requirements of the Pre
sidio before the department at Washing
ton. The allotment of $14,000 for stables
and $20,000 for tilling in the marsh came
from the reserve fund of the present fiscal
year. The allowance of $100,000 for tue
double briCK barracks came from the first
apportionment of the appropriation. The
hiiine in of the marsh ground does not
extend the area of the parade ground, but
widens the field for drill exercises and the
evolution of troops for instruction in ;
minor tactic?.
React Friday, the 12-inch rifle and the
mortars will be fired to test powder. The
tests will be made under the supervision of
Captain Peyton. la order to lest the effi
ciency of the powder projectiles will be
thrown, and toa velocity attained meas
ured.
Captain George P. Scriven, Signal Corps
T. S. A., now the military attache oi the
United States Embassy at Kome, and j
Major-General A. McD. Cook, who is also
in Kome, will be designated by the Secre- i
tary of War to officially represent the War
Department at the coronation of the Czar.
Lieutenant John W. Joyce, Battery H,
Fifth Artiilery, wiiojserved as Post Adju
tant dniinc the prolonged absence of Ad
jutant Galbraith, is on duty again with his
battery.
General Orders, No. 2, an elaborate docu
ment of sixty-tive pages reiatinc to artil
lery, cavalry and infantry instruction has
just been issued from Headquarters De
partment of California. It provides that
all instruction, theoretical and practical
(including parade and other ceremonies),
will be conducted in the forenoon of each
day.
The order embraces schedule of instruc
tion for heavy artillery, schedule for i
light artillery, infantry instruction
whistle signals, cavalry instruction, ;
special schedule of progressive instruction
for cavalry in the riding hall, schedule for
cavalry recruits, suggestions for elemen
tary instruction in minor tactics. The last ;
subdivision embraces particularly advance
guard duty, outpost service, rear guard
duty, reconnoisnnce ana screening.
Wuile the details of instruction are
printed for the guidance of United States
troops serving in this department, the
scheme is available for the use of the
National Guard.
Under the heading of "Schedule for
Infantry Jn*truction,"~the following code
of "whistle signals'' is used promiscuously
in the absence of any official code:
1. Halt. One prolonged note.
2. For ward, wurch. Two short notes and

Kohler-Chase Hall Yester
day.
A Satirical Discourse Regarding a
Reported Ministers' Excursion
to the East.
A cor.rse of lectures on liberal social
ism was begun yesterday in Kohler it
Chase Hall by Morrison 1. Swift, the sub
i iect discussed being "Drones, Intereet and
Kent: and the Economic and Moral
Method of St. Paul Touching These
Phenomena." A review of recent social
events was first given. Mr. Swifc said :
It is reported that a free excursion to the
East It to be given to the miniver 1 - mid pro
it^ sors of this coast by Mr. Huntlugton in re
turn for their services to the Southern Pacific
Connun in keeping perfectly silent about the
wroagl done to the people by the railroad.
: All the professors of political economy, ethics,
! and allied subjects are to M especially recog
, nized by a grand reception at Huntington's
New York palace, and ihey are to be honored
: by an introduction to the greatest men of the
: countryâ C. Vanderbilt, J. Rockefeller. A.
! Carnegie. G. Pullman, J. Astor. Â«i. Gould. Mor
gan. G. Cleveland and General Mile*. C. P.
Huntingtuu and Colonel Crocker will intro
duce them. Kacn professor will be allowed a
few moments of conversation with these 'emi
j nent personages, find will be given their
photograph* as a token of special esteem.
The following comes to us from our special
Southern Pacific reporter: The Southern Pa
dfic ha> set aside a fund which it calls the
â¢'uiinisters' fund. ' All ministers whose
, churches cannot pay their salaries will have a
: claim upon thil nnd if they wul merely Bay
nothing about the Son them I'acitic Railroad
and will preÂ«ch exclusively about spiritual
â â¢ and heavenly tilings. The Southern Pacific
' Company fears that the Christtan religton ts
: becoming corrupted and defiled through the
; interference of one or two Eastern clergymen
! in secular things, and takes th'> ujjiiiis 01 keep
', ing the faith pure In California, it cungiatu-
J.Ht - the ministry of the coa-t that none of its
1 members have soiled tnelx cloth by dalliance
! with any of those vicious and worldly move
ments which are lalsely called advanced. â¢
Any pastots of rich churches, who through
nervous prostration have come to think that
i society is not perfectly just, or that the masses
arc not perfectly happy, wih be given an ex
j tended European tour from the ministers'
' fund. They will be allowed to travel until
! their malady is entirely cured.
Mr. Huntington now frankly admits that
! he sees the advantages of higher education
more clearly than ever before. He fir.d? that
his de^ns are hampered only by base and
uneducated pettons. He is not aware that a
single college graduate has thrown any ob
stacles in his way. If learning does not place
men on the same level with the ricli it at least
teaches them to perforate and despise the
vuljrar fallacies of ttie common working herd.
Friends near tne great man say that he is sure
to do something substantial for the university
graduates' associations of this State.
There are to be receptions to Vanderbilt and
i Depew this week by the Bohemian and Union
clubs becoming their civilian magnificence.
The Y. M. C. A. is to enjoy the rare felicity of
hearing a few words fall from the lips of f'hat
sublime Christian and patriot, Cornelius
] Vanderbilt.
Ju order that all sides of California life may
be represented it ha? been proposed that a
grand procession of all the unemployed in San
Francisco be formed to escort tne illustrious
: visitors from the ferry to the hotel. Mr.
Depew will be requested to speak from the
balcony on the benefits rendered to the masses
by millionaires. Mr. Vtinderbilt is to bo for
mally requested to contribute a ward to the
Suicide House for Workingmen, where those
who are no longer needed by the capitalists
can take their own lives with the least degree
of pain.
A deputation from the one-meal-in-two-days
out-oi-labor-union will wait upon i)r. Depew
to obtain courses 01 reading on the subject,
"HOW to maUe high-miii'Kd American citizens
out of skeletons who eat three times a week."
it has leaked out that a marble statue of Mr.
Vanderbilt and Mr. Huutington, arm in arm,
may be erected in Golden Gate Park, where
the workingmen can see it free. It is to repre
sent the union of the East and West. They
will appear to be walking on clouds, but be
low will be seen the feminine figures of Lib
erty and Justice, holding them up. The prop
osition comes from tiie Merchant*' Association
of San Francisco. They have offered to carry
out the idea if the unemployed will contribute
their leisure to the job gratis, and if the
sculptor will work for nothing. Much enthu
siasm is felt.
Five hundred skeletons have consented to
embellish the least in the maple room of the
Palace Hotel, given by the Union Club to these
Eastern grandees. Many of them are, or were,
strikers who were discharged by the Southern
Pacific and blacklisted. In the middle of the
banquet they are to be ushered through the
sumptuous hall to enhance the pleasures of
the reveler* by showing the contrasts which
God makes in human lots. Each of them is t to
be given a drink of water.
Gounod's "Redemption" to lie Produced
Gounod's oratorio of "Redemption" is to be
produced for the first time in San Francisco
with orchestral accompaniment, by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and the San
Francisco Oratorio Society, in Metropolitan
Temple, Tuesday, March 31. The oratorio
consists of prologue and three parts. Re
served tickets, 75, 50, 35 and 25 cents, on sale
at 308 Post street.
A GRASS WIDOW NOW
Lillian Beddard Will Face the
Footlights and Her Dia
monds Alone.
HER HUSBAND DRANK HEAVILY
The Divcrce Only a Ripple in. the Life
of a Light-Hearted English
Actress.
Lillian Beddard, who has achieved suc
cess m Fhakospoarean roles, met in San
Francisco with perhaps the first, and at
any rate the most disagreeable, incident of
her career a= a legitimate ftCifCM.
"I came here," she said in an interview
last night, "with the most br liliant pros
pects and the most flattering testimonials
from England, Africa and Australia, and I
starred three weeks la 'Siberia' in Stock
wells Theater, and received Mattering
notices from the press, however not more
Mattering than I have received elsewhere.
But â " And here a pout clouded the
countenance of the bright little Kngii^n
woman, and a sober louk stole into her
light blue eyes as she added : ''Mr. titock
well and I didn't agree very well, and my
husband, Hereward Hoyteâ that's before
I was divorced from him â was drinking
heavily ana my money. That
has thrown me bark considerably ; so you
may see that I have not been very well
treated here.''
Although this ktory so briefly told must
have been a sad one to remember the pout
was the only thing that marred the sun
shine on the mtrry face of the plucky lit
tle woman, who has always chosen to look
on the blithesome side of life. No one
would take Miss .Beddard for an English
woman, the only thing Knglfcb about her
being the cultured accent that rolls and
rattles the royal r-r-r. But that is all.
The rest is of sunny, vine-clad France,
whose people have hearts us warm as the
red hills upon which their choicest wines
are grown. The light blue eyes wear a
perpetual smile; the fair face, framed in
curly blonde hair, is that of one who en
joys the good things of life and pays but
little heed to the disagreeable ones.
Diamonds being some of the good things,
she has them in denty. and they scintillate
from her throat and lingers, making her
quite a sparkling gra-s widow indeed.
When one looks at her and thinks of the
divorce he wonders why a man with a
wife so charming should drink so much.
But, perhaps, that is Decause of the cussed
ness of the sterner sex.
Miss Beddard has a fine collection of
plays, most of which were written specially
fur her. One of these is "The White
Queen." written by Palgrare of London,
author of "Jane Shore.' It is a historical
play of the time of Louis Xll. Phe pro
duced this in London, ;md realized a large
sum of money out of the performances.
"The White Woman." a dramatization of
Wilkie Collins' "Woman in Wuite," is an
other of her favorite pieces. She has in her
repertoire several melodramas, among
them "The Gambler's Wife,'" by Neil 0?
London; ''The Mascot of Montana," by
her ex-husband, Hcrewnrd Hoyte, and sev
eral comedies, one. of which, "The Divided
Skirt." lias never been produced.
In London she playtd a long and suc
cessful season as luÂ»<ly Macbeth to the
Macbeth of Walter Kent lev. She played it
also for two weekn in Edinburgh, and the
bagpipers serenaded her every nigbt.
"Poor fellows! They seemed to enjoy it
â¢0 much. They really think it's music,"
and Miss Bedtiard iaughed heartily as
though she couid see ho music in "The
Keel o' Tulloch," "My Heart Is Sair for
Charlie." '"We're na That Fu, but Jist a
Wee Drap in Our Ec," and the other se
lections rendered with much explosive
ness by the braw and kilted Scotsmen.
Miss Bwldard was thp first Shakes
pearean actress to visit Johannesburg and
Kimberly, the gold and diamond centers
of South Africa, and she coined money
there in the name of William Shakespeare.
Among her enthusiastic patrons were:
Cecil it nodes, the South African states
man; Paul Rruger, the Boer President;
Mayor Graaff of Cape Town. A beautiful
full-blooded collie dog. the gift of Cicil
Khodes, accompanies the actress wherever
she goes. lie is one of the most faithful
of animals, and she would not part with
him for his weight in gold.
While in Cape Town, the actress was
very much interested in the Malay popu
lation. They are inveterate theater-goers,
and their women on such occasions attend
bedecked in the most gorgeous of silks,
and shod with embroidered slippers, rain
or shine.
People pay good prices to see a show in
Africa, the lowest being half a crown, and
ranging from 5 shillings to 10 shillings six
pence. The boxes fetch fiom 3 to 5 guineas.
At a benefit the rates are much higher.
"San Francisco is strange in one thing,
and that is that they don't give diamonds
to actresses," continued Miss Beddardwith
a laugh. "At my benefit in Kimberly I
got Â£.;,)0 worth of diamonds."
It was suggested that Kimberly was a
diamond district where tue minerÃ threw
diamonds at the birds, while San Fran
cisco was noted for its profusion of flowers
all the year round, which tbe people made
up into'bouqucts and threw at actresses and
at themselves.
Miss Beddard intends to ODen a season
here with one of her own plays in a short
time. ____^_
Funeral of a G. A. K. Veteran.
The funeral of Erwin R. McElroy took place
at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon from 320 Post
street. It was conducted by George 11. Thorn as
Post, G. A. R., of which the deceased was a
member, and was largely attended by the
veterans and comrades of the post. The Rev.
Dr. C. O. Brown, chaplain of the post, con
ducted the funerÃl services. The interment
was at National Cemetery.
FILLMORE IS OUTWITTED
Neat Trick Worked by the Mor
ton Special Delivery Com
pany.
TO ADVERTISE ITS BUSINESS.
Its Signs Are Now in Forty Stations
on the Southern Pacific
Railroad.
Superintendent Fillmore of the Southern
Pacific appears to have been made the vic
tim of a bright little scheme on the part
of the Morton Special Delivery Company.
For years he has waged a constant warfare
against the new baggage-smashing con
cern in order to protect the Pacific Trans
fer Company in the rights for which it has
paid. Peanut butchers were even forbid
den to sell on the trnins Looks containing
the Morton Company's advertisement, and
every possible means was taken to prevent
the traveling public from knowing that
they could have their trunks transferred
for thirty-five cents if they saved their
checks until they reached San Francisco
instead of giving them to the agent on the
train, who charged fifty cents.
That was the condition of affairs np to
last Wednesday. To-day nearly forty of
the railroad' 3 stations are decorated
with large card* warning people not
to give their checks to agents on :in> trains,
but to save them until they reach the City
and have them mored for thirty-live ceius
by the Morton Delivery Company. The
new cards were a great surprise to the
ticket agent.-*, but they had nothing to say
| on the subject, except that they were "put
i up by Fillmore's oiaers."
At first it was thought that a compro
mise had been effected between the two
transfer companies, but investigation
proves otherwise. W. R. Morton of the
delivery company, when spoken ta about
the matter, chuckled in the most pleased
manner and had the appearance of a man
contented with his handiwork.
â¢â¢"We have to be on the lookout for these
opportunities to bring our name before
Jhe public,"' Mr. Morton said, "and I have
been working on this scheme a long time.
I did the work through a well-known sign
company, and think the thing will stick
or somebody will get damages.
"This is the way it was," he went on.
"The sign company made an agreement
with Fillmore to put up large frames of ad
vertisements in seventy different stations
throughout the State. Their contract
reads that it shall be of 'any rirni or per
son and so woraed as not to "be libelous or
indecent/ As we are sale on any of the
exceptions, I don't see what Mr. Fillmore
can do except allow our sign to remain in
the frames or pay the Adsigns Company
a large bill of tfamages for the amount
they wouid lose by having it taken out."
Mr. Morton smiled in the most pleased
manner and continued: "The men
started out with the signs last Wednesday,
ami by this time most likely have them
in every station between here and Sacra
mento and down to Fresno. It. is also the
intention to place them in the stations 01
the coast divi.'ions. In fact, they will go
anywhere that they will do the most good,
lnany event it Is not. my light, as the sign
company has guaranteed me aeain-t any
trouble." If the signs don't stay there I
don't pay for them.''
Evan j. Colemau of the transfer com
pany expressed great surprise when told
that the Morton Delivery Company had
put up Â«igns advertising their business in
the stations between Benjcia and Sacra
mento. "Surely," he said, 'you don't
mean to say they are in the station build
ings?"'
When informed that they were, he be
came quite indignant for a few moments,
and finally came to the conclusion that
Mr. Fillmore could know nothing about
them. "Our contract with the railroad
company will not allow those signs in
their depots, and I will look into the
matter to-morrow. We pay a large sum
for the privilege of doing business on tae
trains and pay the agents ninny thousands
of dollars a year in salaries for their work.
The Morton Company now has more
privileges than it should have and it pays
practically nothing for them. Those signs
cannot remain therr, and I am surprised
that I have not heard of them sooner.
But I am sure that Mr. Fillmore has been
fooled and as soon as he hears of it will
order the signs taken down."
As the matter stands it seems to have
great possibilities for a pretty fight any
way you look at it. If Mr. Fillmore has
been" fooled the chances are that some
thing will "pop"' when he discovers the
trick. If the Morton signs have really
been put up with his permission he will
have his hands full to square matters
with the Pacific Transfer Company so that
things are bound to be interesting for the
people, particularly those who have an in
terest m the transferring of trunks for 35
cents instead of 50 cents.
QUIT YE LIKE MEN.
Rev. Anna H. Shaw Discourses on the
Requisites of Man
liness.
The California-street Methodist Churrh
Wl â  crowded last evening by an audience
chiefly of ladies assembled to hear Rev.
Anna H. Shaw's elaboration of the text:
"Watch ye; stand fast in the faith; quit
ye like men ; be strong."
She prefaced her address by the remark
that she would use the word man in the
generic sense. Miss Shaw continued:
The keynote of the test is strength of char
acter. The failures of the past have been ow
ing to characterless humanity. The world
has had too many weak women. What it
TOU/T
19* ' I
A smart Broadway, New
/ \ York, druggist has
this sign hanging outside
his store, it marks the
new era of drug selling.
Is it any wonder that he
has to enlarge his quar-
ters, that his clerks \ are
busy, and that his store is
one of the most popular
\ along the leading thor-
oughfare ?
You can afford to trade
with a druggist that has
such a motto as that.
needs is strong-minded, self-respecting, sell
assertive women. A stream cannot rise higher
than its source. A man cannot rise to a char
acter level higher than his parentage.
A man's character is himself. He can escape
his enemies, but not hims-'lf and his character.
There are three things necessary to a strong
character. It must posÂ«eÂ«s moral courage. A
man may be physically courageous, but a
moral coward. It is no easy thing to turn
aside from the beaten track of thought and
action, not alone when the tide of public senti
ment, but the pleas of loved ones, are against
such a course. A cross is beautiful at Easter
tide. But how rude anil bard was that one
borne nearly 1900 years ago?
A man ot strong character must be ft man of
unalterable faith in Hod. All those who have
gone forth with a great truth tor the world
have been men of such abiding faith. The
world is still mourning the Christ song Byron
might have sung.
Inialtering obedience to the commands of
Go<i is an essential of a strong character. No
man is capable of leadership unless lie be will
ing to follow in the footprints of the lowly
Christ.
A man should be loyal to what he believes to
be true. There is more manhood and hape in
him who cleaves to the truth as he conceives
it to be, even though it be not truth, than him
who is false to the truth he has recognized.
People have said men cannot live up to the
standards of women; that those standards are
too high. But they are God's standards. It
behooves the bearers to hold God's standards
higher than the standards of the world.

PRESIDES OVER
TWO CHURCHES
Rev. Dr. Cocmbe's Efforts
in the Cause of
Religion.
NOTED AS A BUILDER.
Pastor of Richmond and Pierce
Street Congregational
Churches.
WORK OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS
Christian Endeavor Societies and
Weekly Prayer Meetings Enjoy
Large Membership.
There are tyro churches in San Francisco
that are presided over by one pastorâ the
Richmond Congregational Church, in th^ Richmond Distric , Wher- tt.v. i i iJip Coombe, Also Pu.*t>r of the Pie. cc-Street Church, Presides
Sun Jay Evening .
[Sketched by a "Call" staff artist.*]
Richmond Congregational Church and the
Pierce-street Congregational Church. Rev.
Dr. Philip Coombe directs both. At 11
a. m. on Sundays be preaches at the
Pierce-street Church, and at 7:30 p.m. in
Richmond Congregational Church.
At present the membership of P.ichmond
Congregational Church is fifty-nine. The
members are mostly young men and
women, and a majority have united
with the church upon confession of faith,
few having been received from other
churches. They are united and loyal to
their pastor.
Connected with the church there is a
Sunday-school and a Christian Endeavor
Society. The Sunday-school is efficiently
ofiicored, and has foY its superintendent
Jackson Donogh and Mi3s Mat'tie Hook,
and for secretary Ilia Marie Horton. The
Sunday-school lias a meiuber.-hip of 101,
and the young people take a great pride
and interest in their organization. The
time of meeting is 10:45 a. m., and the
Christian Endeavorer.s assemble at 6:45
P. M. on Sundays.
But it is the prayer-meeting in which
the pastor takes thf> greate-t satisfaction.
It is held on Tr.Cfday evenings at 7:30
o'clock. The prayer-meeting has a large
and regular attendance. For some time
the church has been too smaii for the
needs of the congregation, and the mem
bers expect to erect a more spacious and
beautiful one soon. Part of the money for
this purpose has been raised, vi.d promises
to contribute much of thÂ»> timber required
have already been received. In case the
proper amount cannot be raised the old
church wiH be enlarged and remodeled, as
the members do not desire to be ineum
bered with debt. The pros]>ects for a new
church, however, are excellent. The de
sign favored by the majority is that of the
Hants Rosa church.
Tho membership of Pierce-street Church
is twenty-eight, and is composed mostly
of young persons. Connected with the
church is a Sunday-school of good attend
ance, which meets at 12:30 P. m. on Sun
days in order not to conflict with the time
of Sunday-school at the Richmond church.
Through the generosity of Stephen S.
Smith, one of the editors of the Pacific,
both churches have large and Taluable
lots clear of all incumbrance.
Dr. loorabe, the pastor of the churches,
is an Englishman by birth and was edu
cated in his native country for commercial
pursuits. Before coming to America he
held a position oi trust in the London
house of which George Williams, founder
of the Young Men's Christian Association,
is president. Coming to America in 1873
he engaged in commercial affairs for six
years and was successful in everything he
undertook.
In 1879 he entered the Pacific Theologi
cal Seminary of Oakland with the inten
tion of going to Japan as a missionary. At
the expiration of tnree years' study he was
urgently requested to remain in Cali
fornia.
The reverend gentleman's first pastorate
was at Feritdale, Hurnboldt County, in
LBBL For eleven years he remained there,
disseminating the truths of the Gospel,
lie came to San Francisco in 1893 :ind or
ganized the Richmond Congregational
Church in December of that year. The
Fierce-street church was not brought into
existence till April, 1895. Dr. Coombe's
domestic iife is the happiest, surrounded
as he is by a devoied wife and six bright
children.
Dr. Coombe preached on "The Agony of
Jesus in Gethsemane" at the Richmond
Congregational Church last night. He
said:
"No one who thinks seriously about the
agony of Jesus in Gethsemane can do so
without being moved in the depth of his
inner life; ior it brings before us the great
est agony, the deepest sorrow that has ever
been recurded in the history of our race.
"Jesus trod the wine press alone. He
knows ail our troubles by reason of his
own experience. He ia touched by our in
firmities.
"Jesus knows every agony of soul and
will never leave us. Our sky may be
heavily overcast, but there are golden rifts
in the clouds and glorious rainbows in the
heavens, reaching the earth as they circle
the aide*. In the invisible and eternal
things of the life beyond us and nbove us
we have to see the clouds and sit in the
darkness and suffer the Dam and endure
the loneliness, but we may see something
of the splendor of heaven if we will look
upward, and brightness and illumination
may beam upon us until the human face
may look like the face of an angel, and,
like Stephen, we may see the heavens
opened and the glory of God, and Jesus
sitting on the rigut hand of God. As we
ascend the mount of God through wind
and storm, with battered head and bruised
feet, and broken heart, and bated breath,
we shall reach the sunshine of the Divine
presence above the clouds and darkness,
above the tempest and storm."
Keefe Wa* Only Disciplined.
It appears that John Keefe, the gripman on
the Jackson-street line who was said to have
been discharged irom the Market-street Rail
way service because of a visit to Ingleside, is
merely undergoing discipline at the hands of
his company.
He attended the races with his wife and
some of her lady friends on his regular <?ay off.
He did not play the races himself, but ai the
request of his companions purchased some

His record is said to be excellent. Me ran
the first car over the Jackson-streot line eight
years ago and has bee'i in faithful attendance
to his duties since. He has laid his cose before
Mr. Viiiing and Mr. Skinner and they have
taken it under advisement. His defense in
that no rule prohibiting attendance at the
races was posted in the Jackson carhouse, and
that he was ignorant of such a rule. He is not
a habitue of the races.
Mr. Keefe is in a tractable mood and says the
company's rules must be obeyed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1896.
BROWN IN THE PULPIT
He Preaches Morning and Even*
ing at the First Congre
gational Church.
THE ATTENDANCE NOT LARGE
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and Her Bible
Class Hold Forth at the Native
Sons' Hall.
The Rev. Dr. Brown preached at both
the morning and evening services at the
First Congregational Cliurch yesterday.
The congregation numbered about four
hundred.
Dr. Brown selected as the text of the
morning discourse, Mark, chapter 11, verse
9, "Blessed is he that comeih in the
name of the Lord."
Unlike his sermon of the Sunday previ
ous, the pastor spoke directly to the sub
ject, not even so much as hinting at the
troubles now surrounding him or which
have come so near to wrecking the First
Church. When all else has been said Dr.
Brown must be given credit for preaching
an eloquent, masterly sermon, with just
enough of the tearless tremor to impress
those who had not heard him before.
In his opening remarks Pastor Brown
said that of all strange, inexplicable
things concerning the coming of the Lord,
none were more strange than this: Dur
ing the early part of Christ's ministry, he
did not proclaim his Mcssiahship, neither
did he deny it. It was not until Christ
had made a place for himself that he tod
the world who lie was. Had he done oth
erwise, argued Dr. Brown, he would have
wrought a political rather tnan a religious
change. Christ did not come to satiate
political ambition, but to elevate human
ity to the plane of talvation.
At the conclusion of the morning ser
vices the standing committee met in the
pastor's study to pass on the applications
for membership of twelve women, young
and middle-aged. Under the existing con
ditions the presumption is that the dea
cons passed the would-be members with
out any <:reat Congregational form.
John Kirn ball's Bible class occupied the
church immediately after the sermon, the
regular Snndav-school meeting in the
lecture-room below.
The evening service at the First Church
did not differ materially from that of the
morning, except as far as the text went.
Dr. Brown found his subject in the thirty
second verse of the last chapter of Revela
tions, and for half an hour entertained his
hearers with his interpretation of the gos
pel as found in that part of the New Testa
ment.
The fifteen or twenty new members se
cured by Dr. Brown and his friends during
the pa3t two weeks do not seem to worry
those now seeking to oust him. Brown's
enemies claim that it matters not how
much new blood is introduced, it cannot
save the pastor.
MRS. COOPER'S CLASS.
A Large Attendance at the B b!e
Reading and Discussion In
Native Sons' Hall.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper's Bible-class met
at Native Sons' Hall yesterday. There was
;,Â».-â â :- . â  â  â¢ -.--â 
a large attendance ; and all : took a \ lively
interest in the spiritual discuss ion. r The
class, which is . making an extra effort
since leaving the First Congregational
Church, has issued the following invitation
to their friends:
You are hereby requested to attend the Inaugura
tion exercises of the
SAKAH B. COOPER
Christian Endeavob ScxdaT-Schooi
AND KINDEBOABTKJJ,
Sunday, 3:30 p. it., April 5, 1896,
Ninth Avenue and H Street.
Mrs. Cooper has kindly consented toaddress the
meeting, and it is hoped her Bible-class will attend
in a body.
'lake the Xl lis or Halght street cars and transfer
to steam cars. Stop at Ninth avenue, south of
Golden Hate Park.
The class yesterday discussed "The
Young Ruler. 1 ' Luke xviii: 15-30.
Many Bible scholars in the audi
ence, including several clergymen. Visit
ors stopping at the different hotels intro
duced themselves and soon felt at home in
the discussion of different points brought
out in the lesson. It was agreed that the
young ruler lacked the central principle of
character. He loved himself and his
worldly possessions better than all else.
He loved material things above spiritual
things.
"To be a Christian," said Mrs. Cooper,
"the spiritual life must dominate the phy
sical f and secular life. Tiie young ruler
wanted spiritual good as a sort of addenda
to his earthly possessions. This is evident
from the fact that the moment the test
came, as to whether he would choose
spiritual excellence or temporal good, he
chose the latter without any hesitation.
He wen: away sad. Spirituality cannot
be a parasite growine on the boughs of
prosperity. The spiritual must inspire
and control the lower physical life. And
when this is a fact in hunun life, then all
other needed thing* are added. Selrish
nesd is dark and deadly wherever it is.
Selfishness is the bane of human life. The
law of sacrifice is the true law of life. Who
soever would save iiis life must lose it. He
that losetii his life shall i-ave it unto life
eternal. It is only what we give that we
really keep."
SCHRODER MONUMENT.

Fellows' CometÂ«ry by the 'Wood

members of the camp, a large number of
members from Redwood Camp No. 91 and
a large crowd of visitors.
The members grouped around the monu
ment in a circle and opened the ceremonies
with the singing of the anthem, "Rock of
Ages." Council Commander P. i>\ Gilroy
made a few introductory remarks as to
the purpose of the assemblage, which wns
followed by singing "Nearer, My God, to
Thee." Marion de Rocco then feelingly
recited the poem, "Oh ! Why Should the
Spirit of Mortal Be Proud?"
The council commander ordered the
master of ceremonies to remove the veil,
which being done, he rend the simple in
scription chiseled on the white marble
stiaft:
To the Memory of
Theodore C. Schroder,
Born December 23, 1807,
Died December 9, 1895.
Erected by tne Woodmen of the World.
There followed the dedication of the
monument in the impressive form peculiar
to the order.
The oration of the day, delivered by
George \\ . Day wait, dwelt upon the ster
ling Qualities of the character of the de
censed and paid a tribute to the relatives
and friends. After the camp salute the
members marched back to the chapel and
disbanded.

HAD A GOOD TIME.
Went Down to Arizona, Saw the
Sights and Has Returned.
Some Interesting: News From a Man
Who Has Traveled.
AMONG THE COUNTRY PEOPLE IN TnE
East, Arizona is still regarded as one of "the
wildest and woollest" placss that, this enlightened
republic holds as part of Its territory. But the Ar-
izona of to-dayâ though It may occasionally claim
attention because of some slight divergence from
what may be called "Sunday-school manners"â ls
not that man-hunting, reckless, devil-may-care
country which has so often been described in fairy
tales that touch the gentle ear of the average East-
erner with a thrill of holy horror. Out in this be-
nighted region (which, however, has been found to
be in truth '-God's own country") it i 3 not uncom-
mon for people who have the leisure to go down to
â¢Arizona" for a holiday, or when it is necessary to
lecuperate in a dryer or a warmer climate One.
Kf-ntleman who has just come from there could
without doubt give some very interesting informa-
tion about the great Territory, for he is a man o
keen observation. Reference is made to S. M.
Hooker, who is now In Los Angeles. Mr. Hooker
had the misfortune to get an attack of most malig-
nant catarrh, which was so far-reaching In its ef
fees that it nearly destroyed the whole of his
nervous system, b;it he applied to the great spe-
cialists at the great Hudson Medical Institute-
that wonderful establishment for the cure of all
the ills to which humanity is heir, and, of course,
the great specialists there very speedili- effected a
cure in his case, as they do in all other curable
cases. Mr. Hooker thus expresses himself about
it in a letter to the management :
Los Axoelks. July 30, 1895.
HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, San Fran-
ciscoâ Gentlemen: Your letters. rÂ»ached me, being
forwarded from Arizona tome h^re. .1 have no*
filled oul the blank, as I found it was unnecessary.
I feel now a? though I am a cured and a well man,
and I have gained ten pounds since I came here-
just a month ago. lam very grateful for what you
have done for me. 1 ou^hi. to have written to you
before, but have not had time. I had a spU ndi<l
time in Arizona since I wrote you last. Kesp.ct-
fnlly yours j S. M. Hooker.
This is an encouraging letter, for Mr. Hooker
was In a most serious condition when he placed
himself in the bands of the specialists of this
grand institution, but It is matched in tone daily
by hundreds of similar expressions of gratitude
from enred patients, a whole room at the insti-
tute being devoted to testimonials.
E. W. Fowler of Kamele. or., says: "I am
feeling as good now as it is possible for a man to
feel.''
F. Mlnturn of St. Louis, Mo.: "I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the careful and con-
scientious manner in which my case has been
trea.ed by you."
A. Burton of Grass Valley: "Your medicine
did me lots of v;ood and I will sÂ°nd for some mdYe. "
K. C. Taft 01 stowe, Ca!,: "I am feeling fine,
without the sign of disease now."
When thousands tall the same story, can you
longer doubt the skill of these marvelous special-
ists? In each instance you will find that the peo-
ple say that they have been CURED. Then, as
soon as possible, 'f you are ill at all in any way,
goto the HUDSON MEDICAL INSTIIUTE, for
there yon will be certain to find help, and you
won't waste any money either.
All the Following Cases Are Curable:
Catarrh of the head or stomach : all bron-
chial diseases: all functional nervous diseases:

POINTED ADVICE TO VOTERS.
: The Orator From Ohio Makes His
Last Address to the People
of This City.
Major T. C. Ryan's last appearance in
this City before a Good Citizenship meet
ing was greeted by a well-filled auditorium
at Metropolitan Temple yesterday after
noon.
Rev. Dr. Ray Palmer made the introduc
tory remarks, in the course of which he
said :
"The cause in which we are engaged is
immortal. The reasons are various and
strong why we should make our work a
permanent one. We recognize these rea
sons when we see this great country con
trolled by the Roman Catholic hierarchy.
"The American Protective Association
to-day, numbering almost 4,000,000 in
strength, stands around the altar of lib
erty and we pledge our honor and life to
protect the National flag from the machi
..; nations of aliens. We propose to make
= this Government the envy of both hemi
.: spheres. I know that the accomplishment
'â¢} of this work will be very painful to the
â ' â¢Roman hierarchy, but it must De done."
".'â¢ He then related the story of the man
: who went to the dentist to have along
. ailing molar extracted. He greatly feared
.:" the ordeal, and when he got into the chair
â  auu saw the dentist approaching with the
;'"â¢ formidable looking forceps, he closed his
.'. mouth and absolutely refused to open it,
*â¢ despite the persuasion and even force used
by the operator. The latter then con
:-;rred with his office boy to have the lad
â¢ .stick a pin in the patient while the dentist
was endeavoring to open his mouth. This
plan was carried out, the mouth of the
/'.sufferer flew open, the forceps went in,
â¢ 'gripped the acher and out it came, before
the victim knew what had happened.
Asked if he had suffered much the patient
I replied: "No, but I had no idea the root
ran down so far." [Laughter.]
Taking this as his text, the sneaker said:
"So it is with Romanism. Its roots 'run
further than we think, and there will be
considerable pain when we come to ex
tract it from the body politic of this coun
try." [Applause.]
The appearance of Major Ryan brought
out long and hearty applause. His sub
ject was, "Romanism and Protestantism;
Their Fruits Compared." He spoke as
follows:
"I hear some people say that the efforts
... c of the A. P. A. will soon be brought to
Bnaught.8 naught. Their efforts to stop the progress
ot the A. P. A. reminds me of the young
boy in my regiment who attempted to ;
tickle the hind leg of a mule, ana who
scon found himself some distance behind
the wagon to which the mule was attached.
, So tnese people who are trying to stop the
progress of the A. P. will find them
. selves so far in the rear that they will
, wonder how they got there."
He referred to the great growth and
' ' strength of the movement in the interior
towns of California, which he noted dur
ing his recent tour, and continued :
"One of the great tests of a nation or an
individual is the character of its fruits, so
we must judge also of the character of in
stitutions. . .-.
' "The influence of the Jesuits and their,
kindred organizations has always been
against good government, while the in
fluence of the American Protective Asso
ciation and other patriotic orders is for
â¢good government."
Â« Reference was made to the futile attempt
to have the American Protective Associa
tion investigated by Congress, and Major ;
â ~, Ryan said he was sorry that the order had
not been asked to place its whole secret j
work before Congress. He added that he
hoped that the. order of Jesuits and its
offshoots would also be investigated.
In Philadelphia, he said, a branch of the
Y. M. C. A. had been organized in the
High School, and claimed that this was
= the introduction of Roman Catholic meth
â " ods among Protestants. "These methods,' i
'â¢â "he addÂ«d, ''were being adopted by the i
'^Protestants, who were goinsr about apolo- !
"gizing for the Roman Catholics.
}.â¢'â¢' "Protestantism embrace* all kinds of 1
"religion. It is liberal and knows no big-!
otry. Our country is not a Protestant ;
â¢ country, but the product of Protestantism, j
We will not go even beyond that. It not j
oniy tolerates all forms of religion, but it !
embraces civil liberty as well as religious
liberty. Did it not do so it would have
been just as well as if Luther had never
.lived.
-â¢'â¢ The Declaration of Independence is not
a Protestant document; it is the product i
of Protestantism; of the idea which led to j
";:the, revolution against the Roman hier- j
archy.
= â¢%â¢ ".There is a revolution coming in this
country, and I would have the young men
prepare for the shock of battle. We will j
not have to lift the black man out of
â¢ ? slavery tnis time, but we will have to lift !
up the Roman Catholic to liberty.
. â â  "The Declaration of Independence re- i
' Â°"'{cites that all men are free snd equal, but I
have here a Roman Catholic book that
teaches some are born to be slaves, while j
. others are born to be masters and leaders; i
out I am glad to say that our Bible teaches
. us also that all men are free and equal.
â  "You can't teach me that there is any j
'. man who is infallible. Yet we have been i
."â" told by a celebrated Catholic priest that !
the voice of Leo is the voice of God. j
' Catholics claim that they take their faith
\ and not their politics from Rome. Bat I ;
â¢ : say if they take their faith from Rome
they tate their thoughts from Rome, and ,
â  '*. their thoughts control their politics.
â '"â â¢.. "We need another declaration of inde- |
â â¢â â â¢â pehdence, and if I had the power I would
make all immigrants who come here re-
" e nounce the power of th - Pope.
"During ail these years the Roman Cath
olic church has been trying to drive a dag
ger into the heart of our public school sys
â  < tern. It '.a true we do not produce any I
> John L. Sullivans or Paddy Ryansin those
i schools, but we do produce men. We now
float the American flag from our school
houses, and what we next want to do is to
put only those in the schools to teach our
cnildren who are loyal to our flag. If
there be truth in the report that some one
said things about the immoral character j
of our schools that person shoh-ld be forced
among -the Roman Catholics. We know
that yon think too much of your public j
schools to permit anything to enter them j
that "wouldinjure your children.
"In the city of Madison, Wis., a pa- j
rochial and public school adjoined one
another. The children played in the j
grounds of each indiscriminately and the J
best of feeling prevailed. But one day
there came a Jesuit ,to the city and on bis J
instructions a fence was put up to sep
arate the Catholic and the Protestant
pupils. The children as a consequence are
to-day so bitter, one against the other,
that they are murderous in. their hatred j
and go about seeKing each other's lives j
with rocks and clubs. This was the re- j
suit not of Protestantism, but of the pecu
liar methods of the Jesuits of the Roman j
Catholic church: .
'â¦There is not a foot of soil in America j
that b ould be polluted . by . the foot of a
Jesuit- Your soil in California is the same
as that at Mount Vernon, and no Jesuit
should be allowed to set foot upon either.
All is made holy by the blood of those who i
have fought and died for the liberty which
Romanism eeems incapable of compre
hending . t> ;
â¢'Objection has been made to the A. P.
â¢ A. oil account of its being largely made up
c
of Swedes. It has been my pleasure to
travel througb this Northwest country of j
yours, whÂ«re the Swedes and Danes have
settled in abundance, and there are no
people who make better citizens. The
trouble with the Koman church is that the
Scandinavians can read and write. If I
had my way I would invite sucn people as
the Scandinavians to come to this country
and would invite certain others to leave.
The Scandinavians do not spend their
m#ney for whisky, and they do not appear
in our police courts. The Scandinavian is
the product of Protestantism, .md the class
who usually nil our police courts is the
product of Roman ism.
"The Irish village at the World's Fair
to not a fair representation of the Irish
at home. It was simply a scheme of the
infamous priesthood of Rome to extort
money from the Irish of this country to
put into their own pockets.
'Miss M. T. Elder, an honest Catholic
and a niece of Archbishop Elder of Cincin
nati, in a paper read at the World's Fair
Congress, stated a truth that every metro
politan Protestant paper of note has re
printed, but which has never yet been
printed in a Catholic paper. In this paper
she said: 'My contention is that we have
no hold on tne agricultural masses.' Of
course they haven't. Their hold is on the
liquor traffic. Why. 84.7 per cent of all
the people engaged" in the liquor business
in this country are Romanists in good
standing.
"We have an orcanization in this coun
tryâthe W. C. T. U. I am in sympathy
with it, but it will never have its desire
| consummated if it makes an alliance with
I Romanism. Archbishop Corrigan says
that for hundreds of years the Roman
! Catholic church has been one ereat tern-
I perance organization." [Laughter.]
The speaker then claimed that in Dover.
jX. H. â a city in a prohibition State and
I with a population of l'J.OOOâ there were 300
i saloons, and that 287 of them were in the
| hands of "Romanists." "If you expect to
curtail that business," he said, "you must
never form an alliance with Rome.
"I am in favor of universal suffrage and
â  always have been, but if the women form
ian alliance with Rome I am against
I woman suffrage. We must first kill Ro
i manism and then have woman suffrage.
'â¢This honest opinion of this young lady
; then went on to ask, 'Why is it that the
! greatest men of our Nation are not Catho
' lies? It i* because the best men are from
| the rural stock, and the rural stock is sub
| stantially Protestant.' She tnen advises
i the Catholics to stOD whining about secret
societies, and says further: 'The great men
, of this country are and will continue to be
Protestants.' Amen, say 1. She said fur
ther: 'I do not mean by this men of
: wealth, but men of brains" and influence.
; When I see the large hoodlum element
among the Catholics. I feel in no mood *o
I give faffy to them. When I see the num
! ber of Catholics iv the liquor traffic I can't
! talk buncombe.' "
Major Ryan then read two stories of
miracles from a Catholic book entitled
"Glories Of Man," which he said were read
; to classes of Catholic children. He termed
'â  them the veriest nonsense and said that it
â  was sach things that the A. P. A. sought I
to change. "We demand," he said, '"that
' our teachers shall be intelligent men and
i women. No wonder that the Junior
Order of American Mechanics of Pennsyl
vania asked that such teachers as those I
have described as reading absurd stories
to children should not be allowed to enter
the public schools. There should be such j
a law in every State of the Union. L Ap
plause 1 . We can stand many things, but
we can't stand such things as that.
'â¢In closing let me say, be loyal to the
cause of American patriotism. Let no
miserable politician get- you off the track j
you have taken. Don't have anything to j
do with any party that affiliates with the |
hierarchy of Rome. It may betbat out of
this movement may rise a party that will
be compose 1 of the best men of all parties.
"Strike down, I say, the party ttjat is
always catering to the worst elements. I
see by one of your papers that the Irish
the other day demanded representation
on a certain ticket. Why do not the Ger
mans or other nationalities demand such
a thing? Strike down this element. Kill
it. If you don't it will kill every cher
ished principle of our Government. I'ut
no man on your ticket who is not an
American â I mean native or adopted â
men who devote their life, time and brains
to the public good.
â¢Whether I shall ever see you again on
this Pacific coa^t I know not, but I shall
think of you. On your next election day I
shall probably be at Washington and I
will climb to the apex of the great monu
ment there tnat I may see the smoke of
battle go up above the field of victory won
by the A, P. A. of California."

Four Dog Stake From
Firenzi.
Tom Hayes Beat Lady Fitzgerald in a
Match Raceâ The Talent
at Fault.
Beautiful weather and a card full of first
class dogs combined to draw an unusually
large crowd of coursing men to Casserly
&; Kerrigan's Ocean View Park yesterday
and the quality of the sport fully justified
the expectations of the leashmen.
In the main the hares were flyers and
gave the nounds hard runs to catch them,
many leading the way to the escapes and
going free into the paddocks. The judg
ment of the talent was far from good in
some of the races, notably the final of the
twenty-four dog stake when Firenzi, after
beating Foxhall, Tricks, San Joaquin and
Happy Jack, went down before Dublin
Stout while selling a3 to 1 favorite. Fol
lowing is the result of the run down :
B. C. Lucy's Firenzi beat D. Burfiend's
Tricks, J. T. Hannon's Foxhall beat L. Lisher's

A few match races followed the regular
stake, the most notable being between
Lady Fitzgerald and Tom Hayes, the lat
ter winning handily.
On Sunday next a twenty-four dog stake
at $1 50 entrance will be run. The draw
ing will take place at 915 Market street on
Thursday evening next.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW
Possibility of Lower Rates of
Interest on Bank
Loans.
INFLUENCE OF LOWER TAXES.
Large List of Offerings at Auction
This Weekâ The Record of
the Week.
The probability that there will be a re
duction in taxes this yearof aboutone-balf
per cent, combined with decreased insur
ance rates, will undoubtedly have some
considerable effect on the real estate mar
ket. A prominent broker, interviewed on
this subject last week, said : "The present
ruling rate at the savings banks for good
loans is 6} 5 ' per cent. A reduction of one
half per cent in taxes would inevitably
cause a reduction in the interest rate on
loans of a like amount. This would, in
turn, make it necessary for the banks to
reduce the rate of interest paid on de
posits, in which case many depositors
would be very likely to invest their money
in real estate promising an assured
Handsome New Armory of Company F That Was Recently Completed.
income of 5} 2 to 6 per cent, rather than to
accept the low rate that the banks would
be compelled to offer.
"This is one of a number of indications
that point to the creation of a good demand
in the near future for investment proper
ties. Even now there is a noticeable in
crease in the inquiries for small flats, medium
business properties, etc., that are yielding a
fair rate ot interest on the investment."
No matter what diverse opinions are enter
tained regarding the present condition of the
market, it cannot be denied that now is the
most favorable time seen here for years in
which to make purchases for investment pur- .
Values will never be lower, and in the i
course of a reasonably short time a turn in the
market is bound to come and prices generally j
will take an upward turn. The present market j
is not one that suits the speculator.
He is one who wants to buy to-day and sell j
to-morrow at a handsome advance, but as a ;
rule no matter how successful he may be in :
his operations the value of his estate when he |
dies aoes not compare with that of the shrewd j
real-estate investor. The striking instances 1
of the wisdom of the latter' 3 policy can be seen I
in any large city of the Union. The Astor es- ]
tate. one of the'iargest in New York City, is !
made up principally of real-estate holdings, '
the result of many years' careful buying. In
this City tnere are mauy similar cases, al
though on a smaller scale, among some of the
notable ones being the Fair, Parrott, Luning,
Hobart and other estates as well as numerous
individuals.
An abiding faith in San Francisco's future
growth and greatuess is what prompts and
has prompted these extensive investments in
real estate, and it will be noticed that such
estates will constantly enhance in value each
year. The days for 10 per cent per annum in
vestments, either in real estate or other lines
of securities, are over and the sooner that in
tending investors become reconciled to the
acceptance of an average net return of from
o'itoSper cent the sooner will come about
that steady volume of business in the realty
market that is the accompaniment of the
prosperous and progressive days of ail well
settled and growing cities.
Last week the principal business done was In
the auction rooms, although a number of
other sales were made privately. This week
promises considerable activity. Three differ
ent auction sales are to be held, and the In
quiry about the various properties to be of
fered, as well as the demand for catalogues, in
dicates a good attendance and possibly consid
erable competition in bidding in some in
stances.

A GREAT ST, BERNARD
Berna Is Young Yet, but Stands
Thirty-Three Inches Above
;.;. Ground. ,-.
E. P. Scheel, the Owner, Will Exhibit
Her in Los Angeles, Oakland
and Seattle. ;
E. P. Scheel, who lives at the corner of
Clay and Walnut streets, is the lucky pos
sessor of the largest female St. Bernard in
i the country. At least, so that gentleman
claims. . - -' r
Mr. Scheel, being a man of means, is
enabled to indulge his fad to the utter
most and has a large number ol dogs of
various breeds, many of them being well
known to the local sportsmen. Among
them are Lady Delight, the mother, and
Lady Gladys, the grandmother of the dog
in question. But the pride of the gentle
man's kennel is Berna, the St. Bernard he
thinks will take all the prizes at the com
ing dog shows for which she will be en
tered. '
Berna is but 18 months old and far from
the stopping point in growth and develop
ment, yet she has already attained a
height of 33 inches. This is just one
inch taller than Princess Florence, the
celebrated Eastern dog which has carried
off all the prizes heretofore. Her bones
and skull are larger than Princess Flo
rence's and she ha? a greater girth round
the loins. Princess Florence's wei ht is
180 pounds, that of Berna but 165; yet it
seems certain that with this superiority in
iramework and her youth taken into con-
tcrma, the Largest Female St. Bernard Dog in the Country. She Is Only Eighteen
Months Old, but Stands Thirty-Three Inches High.
sideration it is only a matter of weeks un
til she passes the coal.
All the distinguishing characteristics of
the St. Bernard are exemplified in her
case â white feet and breast, white nose
band and blaze with dark snadings, and
tail tipped with wnite.
The intention of Mr. Scheel is to enter
her for prizes In the dog shows in Los
I Angeles in April and in Oakland ana Se
attle in May. This explains his refusal to
give any information in regard to the ani
mal. It is said that he has refused to tell
his nearest friends whether or not he will
exhibit her at the coining dogshow in this
City.
An Expensive Souffle.
E. Benson, a Third-street saloon-keeper,
indulged in a friendly scuffle with a man
[ named William Cronnin early yesterday
morning, and after Cronnin had left he
j discovered he had been relieved of a purse
containing $235. He reported the matter
1 at the Southern police station.
LONG-DISTANCE CASTING.
Anglers Display Their Skill With
Rod and Line on Stow Lake
in the Park.
THE SUTBO BATHS CROWDED.
New Target for Anglersâ Attractions
at the Museum â A Balloon
Goes Up in Smoke.
The western hank of Stow Lake in
Golden Gate Park was lined from 9 o'clock
yesterday morning until noon by anglers,
who practiced casting flies so as to put
themselves in trim for the sport of trout
tishing when the season opens in a few
days.
There were a number who are recognized
as experts at long-distance casting, and
many who would be willing to consider
themselves such. The casting that was re
corded by W. A. L. Miller and Horace
Smy the, the judges, was north of a small
wharf, while south of it were a number of
buoys for the use of those who were not
entered with the "cracks." These were
active and made many good casts, showing
considerable proficiency with rod, line and
reel.
Thoss who were casting for a record
showed much ability in handling the trout
bait, and the following is the score: Mans
field, 77; Allen, 73; Golcher. 64; Kline,67;
Yount:, 77; Saunders, 55; Peterson, t>4, and
Haight, 72.
In an unofficial contest at 35 feet Finch
scored 91 and Crowell 75: at 45 feet Crow
ell scored 95 and Finch ?9.
For the first time a new target was put
in operation. It is the invention of W. A.
L. Miller, and consists of a ball buoy
which may be sunk at an y desired dis
tance. Affixed to this by four wires is a
rattan ring twenty-four inches in diam
eter, and ten inches outside of that is an
other rattan ring forty-three inches in
diameter. This is attached to the inner
ring and is held up by a number of corks.
Tnis target is sunk to a certain depth, so
that when the fly reaches it it will not be
come entangled in the rattan. The idea
of this target is to enable the judges to de
termine with more accuracy the points
made. If the fly strikes within the outer
circle it counts 9 and within the inner one
it scores 10. Both rings when under the
water are plainly visible to tne judges.
Arrangements are being made to nave
future long-distance casting tournaments
in the large tank of the Sutro baths.
During the afternoon the park was
crowded with people, the tine weather
having drawn them out. There was a
large turnout of vehicles, while cyclers
were out in full force. "It is a noticeable
fact," said one of the park officers, "that
while there Is a very large number of
cyclers in the park to-day, about 90 per
cent of the riders are new ones. It has
The Casting Target.
been so for six weeks. This is accounted
for by the fact that the new ones are the
contingent of '96, which is very larse, and
that the old riders will turn out in full
force in a few weeks. Aside from this, a
large number of the old riders are now go
ing out on the country roads for long
runs."
There were quite a number of contribu
tions to tlie park mnseuni last week. J. A.
Heifer presented 143 coins. Specimens of
coral were donated by Leong Lam, the
first Chinese contributor. Laru had charge
of the Chinese exhibit at the Midwinter
Fair. Dr. T. R. Grindley presented an
old-time porcelain plate. George W.
"Williams presented an old-time revolver,
of the Adams pattern. Mrs. Blanco Paul
son, sister of i. W. Dohrmann, presented a
piece of cancer wood, a very tine specimen.
Mr. Bardnell has added a number of inter
esting and curious articles to his collection.
Captain Thomson of the Park police has
in his possession a fine fur cape that was
found in the park a week ago.
The Sutro hne was well patronized yes
terday, every car being packed with peo
pie bound for the western shore. The com
pany is having new cars built to accommo
date the traffic.
The Sutro baths were crowded all day,
and at one time there were more than 300
bathers in the tanks. Tne entertainment
consisted of swimming races, athletic per
formances and instrumental music.
The balloon at the Haight-street grounds
that was to have carried up Emil Marke
berg went tip â in smoke â the sphere hav
ing caught tire in the progress of inflation.
AN AGED CRIMINAL.
Captured While .Endeavoring to Com
mit a Midday Burglary.
AI ex Thomas, a man TO years of age,
was detected yesterday at noon by the
watchman of the Golden Gate lumber
yard in the act of burglarizing the office of
that company. The watchman waited
until the elderly malefactor had got well
within tbe building, when he placed him

CANDY AND AN EXCURSION
Promise of a Man Who Has
Great Sympathy With the
Baby Burglars.
KETCHAM'S HIGH SCHOOL FIASCO
Chinese and Police in a Tug-of-War,
With Lottery Men on the
Short Eud.
Oak i.anp Office Sax Fraiwisoo Call,)
90S Broadway, Marco. 29. )
There, is one man in Oakland with a
herrrr.; â¢ -His name is John T. Bell, who
;.e ox the moving spirits of the recent
exposition, and, althouuh there are others,
there are not many who would admit that
in their boyhood they -were on about the
same plane of boyishness on which the
four baby burglars now at the City Prison
are standing.
"I have a feeling of sympathy for those
young rascals," said Mr. Bell yesterday,
''and believe that if Chief Lloyd, with the
consent of Judge Wood, would spank
them and send them home the safety of
society will not be jeopardized. Later on
when they have added a decade or two to
their.ages it may be necessary, perhaps, to
round them up again and send them to
the penitentiary, but the spanking would
just about meet the needs for this occa
sion.; When I was a youngster 1 had the
same craving for candy which these little
fellows have (and which was seldom grati
fied), and also a desire to see a big city,
and when, at the age of 10, I was taken to
Quincy. li!., with its teeming, swarming
population of 20,000 and was given a whole
half-dollar with which to buy candy there
was not a happier boy in fourteen counties
than 1 was. And then, too, I was some
thing of a thief myself at the same tender
age.
"The first four-bladed knife I ever
possessed I stole from Bill King, a school
mate, and suffered an agony of remorse
for three days, when my crime was de
tected, and I joyfully endured two flog
cings, one at home and the other at school.
1 hope that Judge Wood will release these
embryo malefactors this time, and if
they Will hunt me up 1 will gladly provide
funds sufficient to pay their way over to |
San Francisco ana out to Golden Gate
Park and return, with a margin large
enough to buy all the candy they can eat
during the clay."
As Judge Wood will render his decision
to-morrow morning, Mr. Bell may be
called on to make good his promise.
Oakland can always be relied upon
to reach the extreme in any matter of gen
. eral interest. Whether it be in the pro- j
duction of juvenile criminals or juvenile
elopers or in any form of scandal or mys
.-tcTy,-this "hatchery of the unexpected"
always goes one better than her neighbors.
The latest extremity to be reached is that
of the power of the press. Editor Keichain
of the High School -iEgis is the offender,
and his suspension is of more than pass
ing interest. It is a second edition of the
troubles that fell upon the management of
Jo?k â  few months ago. It is certainly
rig Jit that the High School should have a
magazine, for the good that it may do by
being circulated over the country is mani
festly great. It is certainly wrong that
the editorâ a mere ladâ should be able to
use his position for the purpose of showing
any personal ill feeling he may have-against
all* or any of the faculty.
If the iEgis were the personal property
of Ketcham he. could do with it as he
pleased and no one could interfere. But
as it is, the paper is owned by stockholders
and the editor is supposed" to have the
honor of the school so much at heart that
he would scorn to do anything to belittle
it in the eyes of the world. Ii every dis
satisfied pupil is to have the privilege of
, carrying on personal fights in .the editor
ial columns of the^Egis against the fac
ulty there must at once be an end of all
discipline and efficiency. Ketcham used
his power wrongly and is now suffering
the consequences. That is his case.
On the other hand, it would have been
far more praiseworthy if the lad had been
told outright that his manner of editing the
paper was distasteful to the faculty and
that he should adopt a different policy.
The claim made by Professor McChesney
that Ketcham was not standing high
"enough in studies is not altogether correct,
as several pupils have come to the front
who declare that their marks are lower
than Ketcbam's. It is this indirect method
of dealing that has brought several little
trouble? on the high school. There will
probably be some, radical changes at the
- election of teachers in June, as more
than one school director believes there is
j room for improvement in the faculty.
Th^e- : Chinese lottery dealers have en
tered into a tug-of-war with the Police
' Department. For a long time the attor-
n eys for the Chinese have been making ef
forts to defend their, clients by impugning
the motives of witnesses, demanding jury
trials and finally attacking the constitu
tionality of the court. Considerable in
genuity has been shown in these defenses,
but they have all been nullified, and now
nothing is left for the Chinese to do but to
pay their lines or go to jail. They have
L announced that they will go to jail rather
ptn'ith pay tines, and have also expressed a
I belief that the City Council will soon tire ;
I of paving $20 to a special detective for each !
| conviction, and that the warfare against
. lotteries will therefore die. The assump
tion of the lottery men is bad argument
and worse logic.
â¢-It is true that while they had Officer
Banks in their pay it did require a special
detective to insure asuccessiul raid. But I
.Banks has flown to the woods to escape all j
sorts of charges, and it is believed that the I
other officers are more honest and are do- j
ing their duty. As a matter of fact, very j
few convictions acainst Chinese have been I
obtained by men who have to be specially I
paid, nearly all the convictions being se
cured by the regular officers. This is one
reason why the Chinese argue badly. The
City Council is hardly likely to com
promise its dignity by -refusing to nay
r a conviction under one of its own
ordinances. That is execrabh 1 logic. Again,
the dealers.' who are arrested are'in many
instances men of wealth,, and occasionally
a:> emissary of "Big Jim" from San Fran
cisco is caught. For tue sake of a hundred j
dol.ars these men are not likely to go to ;
jail. For every one of this class that is j
convicted the cost of several other cases
v.iH Le paid, and as the rich class are in !
the majority the future for the Chinese
lottery dealers is not very roseate, unlessâ
there'is a change in the office of Chief of
Police. -""â â¢ -â¢;-- t . L. W. B.
SECOND WARD REPUBLICANS.
The Three Clubs Will : Probably Be
, Merged Into OnÂ«.
OAKLAND, Cal.\ March 29,â Over 100
Kepublicans of the Second Ward attended
'â â â  meeting at Milton Hall Saturday even
i:iÂ£, called by Fred A. Campbell, president
of the "Old" Second Ward Republican j
Club. Mr. Campbell acted as chairman.
He stated that the object of the gathering }
was to take steps which should result in j
there being but one Republican club In j I
dree ward instead of three. He asked F. R. i
â¢Sorter to discuss the question at issue. <
-Mr. .Porter spoke of * the I*Bo6 "Second '
\\ard Republican Club," of which he is i
president. He alluded to another organi
zation, the "Rejj-jlar Republican Club of <
the Second Ward,' of which P. M. Fisher (
is president Then he referred to the J i
"old" club. He said that in 1894 he was
chairman of the committee on permanent
organization of that club, and he thought
that his committee reported in favor of a
life of six months for the club. Still it
mieht be true that the report adopted
ordained that officers should remain in
authority until their I) successors were
elected and qualified. If this latter idea
was correct then the F. R. Porter club and
the P. M. Fisher club might be deemed
interlopers.
C. A. Fawcett, C. A. Tabor and Morti
mer Smith contended that the "old ' club
was dead. It was urged on their part that
the minutes of that organization would
show that at its last meeting it adjourned
sine die. However, the point was ad
vanced that those minutes were not now
in existence presumably.
Finally L. S. Matberson, assistant secre
tary of the "old' 1 club, was installed as
secretary. On motion, the chair appointed
a committee of five to ascertain the status
of the "old" club and report progress at
a subsequent meeting. As such commit
tee he appointed F. R. Porter, J. S.

STUDENT MASS-MEETING
Berkeley Collegians Will Discuss
the Eastern Track Athletic
Proposition.
College Republican Club to Be Formed.
Decoration for Dr. Holden
From Venezuela.
BERKELEY, Cal., March;:*).â A mass
meeting of the student body of the State
University will be held to-morrow after
noon for the purpose of considering the
proposition of sending the athletic team
East again this summer. Track Captain
Merwin and Manager Friend will address
the meeting and wiil lay before the stu
dents certain plans which they have in
mind for the raising of the finances requi
site to make tne trip a possibility. Some
thing in the neighborhood of $5000 will be
necessary to take a full complement of
men across to the Atlantic and return in a
proper manner. Last year's trip cost up
ward of $:J6OO, but the itinerary was not so
long as is planned for this year and the
team was lacking in two men to make a
full complement for all the track and field
events.
Manager Friend has already made are
rangements for the raising of a portion of
the sum desired. Seven hundred dollars
has been guaranteed by certain Middle
West colleges providing meets arc held
with them on the dates agreed upon. The
Berkeley co-eds will give the surplus of
their basket-ball game with Stanford on
the 4lh prox. 10 the athletic fund, and
various other benefits, such as a big field
day in San Francisco prior to their de
-sÂ»arture, have been arranged for. Manager
feels absolutely certain that the
necessary money can be raised, if not
through field days and the like, through
the generously inclined citizens of Califor
nia, who appreciate the honor which the
team of "96 brought to the State.
Captain Bierwtlj states that the team
this year will be equally as good as that
of last year, if not somewhat better.
The only place the team is Xt all weak is
in the apnnt.s and middle distances. They
are far stronger in the weights than last
season, and they have a pole vaulter,
which was lacking in 'fto. Edgren isdoing
better work with the sixteen-pound ham
mer even' week. Yesterday in practice he
hurled it 148 feet, thus exceeding by about
four feet anything lie has done hitherto,
even in practice, uoth the captain and
manager nave strong hopes that some of
the new men now worKing in the short
distances will show up well enough by
May 1 to be taken along. Scoggins ami
Barnes, the 100-yard men of '95, are greatly
missed.
The meeting to-morrow afternoon will
include the entire university, and on ac
count of there being no room in the main
buildings large enough to hold the assem
blage the gymnasium will be used.
Honor for Dr. Holden.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 29.â Dr. Ed
ward S. Holden, director of the Licit Ob
i servatory, has recently received from the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United
States of Venezuela the diploma and dec
oration of the Order of Bolivar the Lib
erator. The order was founded in 1854 by
Venezuela. It is bestowed in this ca^e for
services to science.
Dr. Holden has previously received the
decoration of Commander of the Ernestine
Order of Saxony, founded in 1690, on t*e
same grounds.

WORKING FOR FABIOLA
The Artistic Grand Stand Will
Be Completed by
Mayday.
PARADE AND BICYCLE RACES.
All the County Towns Have Been
Invited to Participate in the
Great Floral Festival.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. March 29. )
The directors of the California Jockey
Club at the trotting park have promised
that the new grandstand shall be in
readiness and be at the disposal of the
directors of the great Fabiola Festival to
be held in May.
The grandstand will Be entered from the
park and will present the view as shown
in the illustration, with the tankhouse to
the right and the clubhouse farther in the !
background. The 'park comprises twelve
acres of land and will be laid out in land- !
scape garden style, with miniature lakes
and tropical plants. In each corner of the
grounds will be a small Grecian temple
and one in the center. A historic feature
will be the preservation of the judges'
stand in which General Grant held the
watch when St. Julian made a world's rec
ord. The central entrance to the park will I
be for carriages, with footpaths on either I
side.
The grandstand is 240 feet long and 100
feet wide. From the pagoda there is a
view of the Golden Gate and fifteen miles
out at sea when the weather is clear. For
utility the stand will be occupied by two
water tanks connecting the pumping
plant and supplying four hose reels, one
on each floor in case of lire. Work has
begun on the tankhouye, which will bo
supplied with an electric pumping and
lighting plant in the basement. The pad
dock will be m imitation adobe, with a
tiled roof, and will be in the Mexican
style of architecture. The erection of the
clubhouse will be begun later.
The work of the fete Is now well in hand,
and there is no doubt that it will greatly
eclipse the festival of last year.
The affair is in charge of the following
committees: Executive â William R. Da

JUDGE ELLSWORTH HURT.
His Arm Broken in a Driving
Accident at Alameda
Yesterday.
The Wheelmen to Have a Lantern
Parade â A Young Man's Mar
riage Record.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â Judge
Ellsworth met with an accident to-day at
noon by which he sustained a fracture of
his left arm above the elbow. The Judge
is a lover, in a quiet way, of a good horse,
and lias a couple of fair steppers which he
is wont to drive out down on the speed
track at such hour? as his arduous duties
may spare him from the bench. Yester
day he put a big bay colt through his
paces and showed those who think they
have speedy goers that he was well along
with the procession. In coming home, on
Central avenue, the colt stumbled and
fell. The Judge was driving in n road
cart, and was thrown violently out on the
hard macadam. When picked up and ex
amined by a physician it was found that
his left arm had been broken above and
near the elbow. It is a bad fracture. In
setting it it was found necessary to take
out a piece of bone that had been splin
tered. There is some fear that the arm
will be stiff when it heals. It is certain
that the accident, will serve to keep the
magistrate off the bench for some weeks to
come.
Alainnda Wheelmen,
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â Captain
Dodd of the Alameda Cyclers would like
to get up a lantern pa r ade and entertain
ment to take place early in May. The
streets of Alameda being generally and
perfectly macadamized would afford un
usual opportunities for a wheel display
with CfiUMM lantern features, it has
been settled that the finish of the annual
relay race shall be at Morton street, on
Central avenue. The races will turn off
the San Leandro road at High street, which
leads straight through the easterly end of
the town. They will turn thence west on
Central avenue, which is broad and ad
mirably paved and without cartracks or
any obstruction.
Too Much Married.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â 8. C. Aus
tin Jr. is in doubt as to his matrimonial
status. Fanr.io Oneuia Austin was re
cently granted a divorce from him in a San
Francisco court, and the trial disclosed the
fact that another woman in Colorado
claimed hi 3 name. The evidence went to
snow that the Colorado woman was mar
ried to Austin in Carson City on June 21,
18()o. A ceriitied record was produced
showing this state of things to exist,
though Austin denied it. Austin's legiti
mate wife, who has just been awarded a
divorce, learned of the tacts through re
ceiving a letter from the Colorado woman.
Things are, therefore, becoming interest
ing for Mr. Austin.

HORSE FLESH FOR FOWLS
People Using It Have Cornered
the Egg and Chicken Mar
ket at Fruitvale.
COMPELLED TO SELL CHEAP.
One Rancher Says That the Horse Is a
Clean Animal, and Its Flesh, if
Healthy, Is Desirable.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 29. )
The chicken ranchers who feed their
stock on horseflesh have cut the knees of
those who feed the usual food, and there is
trouble at Fruitvale.
In the Fruitvale district lying between
Lynn and the terminus of Peralta avenue
are numerous chicken ranches varying in
size from one to five acres. Until the last
few months they have been a source of
profit to the owners of the once peaceful,
quiet neighborhood. Now all this is
changed.
The trouble commenced when an en
terprising Portuguese saw a profitable
speculation for himself, and obtained a
small ranch on Nichol avenue not far dis
tant from the Hermitage. Here he lo
cated and started up Btarving or disabled
horses and opened up a slaughter-house.
Then he proceeded to offer the chicken
raisers the meat at such cheap rates that
it proved a great temptation, and the ma
jority of them have found its use a bo
nanza. A whole carcass can be bought
for $1, or smaller portions at like rates.
This haa enabled the dealers to increase
their 6tock of poultry and eggs so that
they are now cheaper than ever. The
places where horseflesh is used the chick
en-raisers are receiving 11 cents in market
for their eggs, which are retailed at 12)4
cents a dozen.
Those who are opposed to using the
horseflesh as chicken food and compelled to
compete with these prices, say chickens are
â without profit, as wheat, corn and scrap
meat cost too much to feed hens whose
eges bring only 11 cents a dozen in the
market.
The consequence is that chicken ranches
for sale in Fruitvale are numerous.
Those who want to sell out are indig
nant at those who introduced the horse
meat into the vale, and those who buy it
are pleased to find a food so cheap and
egg-producing. The horse-dealer now
slaughters from eight to fifteen animals
every week, and disposes of every pound
of it in Fruitvale and vicinity. The bones
also find treir place of usefulness in the
poultry business. It is either burnt for
the lime it contains or crushed as egg food.
One of the largest chicken-raisers is
located on Peralta avenue, two blocks from
the Finch Orphanage. He owns 1500 lay
ing pullets, healthy looking, and their
main diet is cooked horsemeat. An acre
sowed In alfalfa supplies the green food re
quired.
The owner, who is a very intelligent man
from Maryland, said : "I have four acres
of land and I lino every foot of it profita
ble in my poultry business.
"As for horseflesh for food I can see no
objections to it when the animals are
healthy, for there is no cleaner animal
than a horse, especially in the selection of
iis food. This notion against it is only
prejudice and in a short time it will wear
away. Chickens are naturally dirty in
preference of food and if they always eat
things as clean and wholesome as horse
meat no one need complain."

Crowds to Hear Sankey.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â Several
thousand people who attempted to hear
Ira D. Sankey to-night at the Tabernacle
"were disappointed, owing to the great
crowd that tilled the big building. Not
since General Booth was in this city has
such an enormous aggregation of people
been assembled as gathered in the vicinity
of Twelfth slid Harrison streets to-nisht.
The meeting was held under the auspices
of the Young Men's Christian Association,
and au attempt was made to raise $3000 to
lift the deot off the Oakland Corps. There
was some response, but the amount
promised will not be known for a few
days. Secretary McCoy delivered a short
address and Mr. Sankey spoke of the
Young Men's Christian Association work
and his travels with Mr. Moody. All the
churches were closed so that the members
could hear the evangelist.

FEAST OF THE PASSOVER.
First Day's Service and Celebra
tion at the Bush-Street
Temple.
The Edifice Was Beautifully Decorated j
With Flowers aud Appropriate
Emblems.
The first day of the feast of the Passover
was celebrated by the Congregation Ohabai
Bhalome in the Bush-street Temple by two
services yesterday. The morning service >
was most impressive, and the interior of j
the edifice was beautifully decorated with j
flowers and emblems symbolic of the de- ;
liverance of the Israelites out of bondage, i
Dr. Fryer's sermon was most appropriate
|O the occasion, and an unusually attract
ive musical programme was rendered.
The evening service, called the Sadr
night, was an innovation in this part of
the country, and was held in the large
lecture-room of the temple. Tables were
spread with a feast of good tbincs and the
school children of the temple partook of
them while listening to stories of the Jew
ish people in Esypt^ A choir composed of j
youig people of "the temple rendered selec- â 
rions from appropriate musical composi- j
tions during intermissions.
When the feast was almost finished Dr.
Fryer read selections from the Scriptures,
and after each verse the children re
sponded in concert with a refrain pre
viously committed to memory.
The'arrangement of the lecture- room for
this service was most pleasing. The lec
ture platform was a ma-s oi flowers and
the walls of the room were hung with gar
lands. The tvo tables were long enough)
to seat about fifty children each and were :
decorated with light-colored blossoms. \
The ladies of the temple waited on the
Children and saw that all were properly i
attended to. The children were highly j
delighted at the novelty of participating at |
the service, and wi:h their bright faces and
pretty costumes formed a plea?in^ picture, j
The feast of the Passover is a feast of j
gladness and pleasure, although tilled with ,
solemnity when giving thanks to the Cre- j
ator for the blessings of liberty. It is j
these features that make the celebration so i
full of interest and give it an aspect that
can be appreciated by the children.
This morning at 10 o'clock Dr. Fryer,
by special request, will preach a sermon in
German. An excellent musical pro
gramme is pronr'sed that will be under
the direction of Cantor Meyerson.
JOAQUIN'S STAGE DEBUT
It Was Made Just a Quarter of a
Century Ago at Dietz's
Opera-House,
The Occasion Was a Benefit Tendered.
to the Veteran Editor, Calvin
B. Mac Donald.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â Calvin B. I
Mac Donald has written an article in his I
paper this week that tells of Joaquin Mil- I
ler's debut on the stage. It is exactly a
quarter of a century since the hermit
poet of Fruitvale appeared at Dietz's j
Opera-house.
"Oakland was then, in 1371, only a large
village," says Mr. Mac Donald, "but it con
tained some people of large intellectual j
stature and considerable financial conse- i
quenre â Durant, Felton, Tompkins, Ross
Browne, the Le Conies, Shattuck, Pardee,
Mor.-e, Dr. Hamilton, Walsworth, Mrs.
M. K. Blake, and others of much note.
Although there were only eight or ten
thousand inhabitant* when, through the
personal influence ol Mrs. Biake, I w:is
fiven a complimentary benefit at Braytoii
[all, now Dietz's Opora-houÂ«e, there was !
an audience of 1100, each with half a dollar j
and not one deadhead. Mrs. Blake, the
manager, made all the clergymen, profes
sors aud newspaper men come down with
the dust, and I myself, Cae benet.ciary, had
to pay half a dollar to get in. Next day I
was rich as a Jew, with nearly $.%0. That
incident was reported in the East, and
opened to me the most eminent situation
in the Middle "West. That was what the
powerfully executive Mrs. Blake did for
me, and !t was by no means the last of her
good voiks.
"That was the occasion of Joaquin
Miller's first appearance on the stage. He
was cur star performer, and a young liter
ary lion with an unbounded popularity
whom the ricli ladies used to come in ti:eir
carriages and take away to dinner and to
hear his poems. Mr. Miller deserved all
the friendly attentions and admiration he
obtained in the then town of Oakland
afterward in the great world's oapual,
Lond&n. He is one of the true America:)
poets who, as such, will survive, i hope
he may long continue to illuminate the
romantic eminence where he has made
his home; where in due time he may be
honorabiy cremated and have his ashes
inurned in democratic terra cotta and
planted in full view of the shiniiiLj gate
that opens out to the great South Sea."
MAKES A RECORD.
Edgren Succeed)) in Throwing the Ham
mer One Foot Further Than Hit*
Previous Best Effort.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â Robert
Edgren, the champion hammer thrower of
the U. C. team, has made a new record for
himself and is now confident that he is
good for the world's record.
"Yesterday while at practice he put the
hammer 14S feet. The distance was care
fully measured and he is much elated over
his success. In talking of the matter to
night belaid: "1 go East in about six
weeks, when I expect to break my own
record in the hammer throw. I get the
swinz every once in a while that makes
the hammer fly."
T: Only a short time ago he threw the ham
mer 147 feet, but he now declares that he
will make that a small affair in the near
future. Edgren is au artist of considerable
ability and is studying in the art school in
Ean I-Vancisco.
A Kicycle Parade.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â A big bi
cycle parate is to be iriven in this city
early ill H*f under the direction of the
A.'ameda cyclers. Captain V. A. Dodd is
making the arrangements. Al'ameda has
the best streets in California for bicycling,
and it is believed that there are no better
in the world, but heretofore there has been
no public demonstration on the part of
the bicyclists in recognition of that fact.
It is expected that all the bicycle clubs
of San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sac
ramento, Stockton and other cities will
send larjre delegations, and theie are hun
dreds of bicyclists in Alameda who will
take part in the parade.
Alameda will this year have the finish of
the relay races. Cominjj into this city
from the San Leandro road at High stree"t
the cyclers will go down Central avenue
and linish at a point near Morton street.
.Tust for J-"un.
ALAMEDA, UAL., March 29. âC. H.
Wilson, colored, who was charged with
the theft of :t watch and chain from Emma
Moore, also colored, of 2017 San Antonio
avenue, was found guilty yesterday after
noon by Justice Morris and sentenced to
pcrve in the county jail for thirty days.
lie admitted having taken the watch, but
declared it was for the purpose of getting
Â« joke on the owner and not with any in
tent to steal. The Justice seemed to be
unappreciative of jokes of this kind and
60 imposed the sentence as stated.

35 of this City, believing, that if passed,
the bill will greatly benefit them iii their
calling, has forwarded pamphlets to the
Senators and Representatives of California
asking them to aid by every honorable
means in their power the passage of the
bill in its entirety.
"American ingenuity has kept pace with
the skill of other nations in the develop
ment of men-01-war, but at the same time
the personnel of the Engineer Corps of the
navy has not been increased," is the lan
guage of the association as published in
their circulars. It goes on to say: "A
new order of still is required and new ele
ments are required in handling the new
war vessels. The naval engineering force
of tne navy is lamentably deticient in num
bers, while the demand for skilled Jabor in
the engine-room increases as each new
vessel is constructed or put into commis
sion. Ev*ry young man who desires to
enter upon a naval career, full of the tales
of the quarterdeck, prefers that to the less
conspicuous but more arduous work of the
engine-room. The result is the line is
crowded with waiting officers while the
Btaft is short in number.
"Section 1 of the bill now under consid
eration remedies these defects or will do
so if it becomes a law. It provides that
the active list of the Engineer Corps of the
navy shall consist of eighteen captains,
twenty- liva commanders, sixty lieuten
ant - commanders, seventy lieutenants,
sixty-live lieutenants of the junior grade,
and sixty-live ensigns and a number of
engineer cadt-ts, as provided by subse
quent sections. That these offices shall
be filled by the commissioning of the offi
cers of the Engineer Corps of the navy
borne on the active list at the time this
bill shall become a law in the order of
seniority, beginning at the top.
"That there shall be a chief of the Bu
reau of Engineering of the Navy Depart
ment, who shall be director-general of na
val engineering, and while holding said
office shall have the rank of rear-admiral.
That there shall be two inspectors-general
of naval engineering, who while holding
said office shall have the rank of commo
dore.
"The necessity for this increase in the
force of naval engineers is emphasized by
the increased use of steam power on the
modern men-of-war. In the modern sail
ing merchantmen auxiliary engines are
used to hoist the sails, weigh the anchor
and discharge the cargo. From the sail
ing vessel to the ocean greyhound is an
other transition, no ereater, however, than
the change from the old lumbering frigate
to the battle-ship and commerce-destroyer
of to-day.
"These vessels with their ponderous
guns are entirely controlled and operated
by steam. The huge masses of steel form
ing their guns, their turrets and other ap
purtenances would require hundreds of
men for their handling, and slow hand
ling at that, without being rendered folly
effective. To apply steam power where it
will do its work most efficiently and rap
idly is the province of the marine en
gineer.
'Another feature treated in section 8 of
the bill is looked upon by the Merchants'
Marine Association as a most potent move
for the good of the navy. That section
provides that the title 'Bureau of Steam
Engineering of the Navy Department'
shall be changed to 'Bureau of Engineer
ing of the Department of the >"avy,' and it
shall have charge of all that relates to the
designing, building, installation, fitting
out, repairing and management of all main
and auxiliary steam, hydraulic, pneumatic,
electric and other machinery and their ap
purtenances used on board of naval ves
sels, not including gun-carriages, torpe
does, torpedo-tubes and fittings. Also
that the Bureau of Engineering shall,
after the passage of the bill, have control
of all matters relating to the inspection,
purchase, character and quality of coal and
of all other kinds of fuel to be used for all
naval purposes; and that all tests of such
fuel shall be made under the direction of
the Bureau of Engineering.
"It requires the highest form of en
gineering sicill to develop the power and
machinery needed to handle the modern
warship. The present bureau of con
struction charged with this work is com
posed of the 'sailor' branch of the navy.
It is now proposed to transfer this to the
'Bureau oi Engineering of the Depart
ment of the Navy,' which shall have
charge oi all that relates to the 'design
ing, building, installation, fitting out, re
pairing and management of all main and
a uxiliary steam, hydraulic, pneumatic,

electric and other machinery and their
appurtenances used on board of naval
vessels.'
"The object of this section is to take from
! the hands of men inexperienced in the
' building of ahips, of metal and its uses,
and steam and its appliances and trans
fer it into the hands of men, who possess
the requisite practical and technical
knowledge for the performance of their ,
onerous duties.
"Those sections of the bill relating to the
appointment of engineer cadets meets
with the unqualified approval of the ,
; Marine Engineers Association. To place ;
j at the disposal of the young men of our
I country the advantages of a marine tech
-1 nieal education to qualify them for future
1 positions in the navy, seems to them a
i step in the highest form of patriotism. It
opens up a new avenue for employment
; for our youth, where those whose inchna- |
i tions sojirompt can find channels in which j
I to pursue their studies, and at the end of i
I their terms give their best talents in their j
; country V defense.
"In California we have two great univer
sities where several thousand young men
j annually pursue a high curriculum of
j studies. With our many miles of sea
i coa^t and facilities for studying in our un
equalled harbors the latest developments
of the navies of other countries, unusual
opportunities are afforded for the study of
marine engineering.
'It is a wise policy in a Government to
encourage the latent talents of the youth
of the land by placing opportunities for
! study in their hands. The difficulties sur
rounding the study of marine engineering j
â¢ make it advisable that every effort be |
made to place as many facilities as pos
sible at the disposal of those desiring to
pursue it.
"The organization of a corps of naval
engineering cadets must be of great ad
vantage to the country at large, for if their
I services are not needed in the navy the
requirements of commerce will undoubt
i edly open up avenues of employment for
â¢â¢ them. Should the country become en-
I gaged in war the same men would be
. available to design, construct or command
the new ships of the American navy. |
WITH JANGLING OF BRASS
The Funeral of an Influential
Chinese Decorously
Celebrated.
i
Pow Yee, the President of the Yeong !
Wo Company, Laid
at Rest.
Chinatown witnessed the largest funeral \
in its history yesterday. The deceased j
was Pow Yee, the president of the power
ful Yeong Wo Company, and all the in- j
fluential men of the Chinese quarter, as j
well as the members of his company, ;
turned out to reverence his memory. The
Chinese Legation was also represented.
The cortege started from the company's !
rooms on Pacramento street. It was 'â 
headed by Walcott's military band of six
teen pieces, followed by the hearse, drawn !
by six white horses, all trapped and ac
contend in magnificent style. The Chinese
musicians followed, industriously playing 'â 
the instruments which so pleased Pade- i
rewski. but found little favor with the I
white musicians in line, who vainly en- j
deavored to keep step and time in spite of j
the discordant jangling.
The cortege wound about the streets of i
the Chinese quarter for about half an hour I
and then started for the Chinese cemetery. \
At Powell and Market streets the brass |
band dropped off. At the cemetery the
usual offerings to the dead were made and j
the body was then returned to town and j
placed in an undertaking establishment \
on Eddy street. To-day it will be sent, via j
the Peru, to Pow Yee's home in Canton.
Pow Yee had been in this country only j
about seven months. He was of high rank j
in his native country, and for this reason |
was chosen to the presidency of the Yeong
Wo Company. He was 53 years of age
and had no relatives. His decease was the
result of asthma.
STABBED IN THE CHEST.
John McÃride Arrested For Jabbing
J. K. MrGee With a Knife.
J. E. McGee, a laborer, living on Tenth
and Folsom streets, was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital late Saturday night with
a knife-wound in his chest. The wound
was not se-rious, and after it was dressed
by Dr. Bunneil, McGee was able to go
home. He said he was walking along Fol
som street on his way home, and at Eighth
street a man, whom he did not know,
called him vile names and stabbed him in
the chest.
Yesterday morning John McÃride, a
laborer, was arrested in the Lindell House,
on Sixth street, and was charged with as
sault to murder. He admitted stabbing
McGee, but said he did it in self-defense.
McGee and a gang "jumped" him, and as
he saw he was going to get the worst of it,
he drew his pocketknife and jabbed Mc-
Gee with it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1896.
JAMES TUOHEY'S
LOWEST BID
Knowledge That Was Not
Given to the Other
Bidders.
TRUSTEE KENT'S STAND.
Appeared Before the Capitol Com
missioners as Tuohey's
Advocate.
COBBLESTONES SOLD CHEAP.
Serious Allegations Against a Sacra*
mento City Trustee and the State
Bureau of Highways.
John W. McDonald of the City Street
Improvement Company was asked yester
day whether there was any truth in the
following statement telegraphed from Sac
ramento to this City with reference to the
THE CORINTHIAN YACHTS COMING OUT OF WINTER QUARTERS.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
i bid of James Tuohey of Sacramento to
'â  hituminize the streets fronting on Capitol
Park for $60,399 90:
The proposition was advanced by the mem
â¢ bers of the alleged San Francisco rock com
bine that the State, owning halt' of the front
age, could, with the co-operation of half
â¢ of the property-owners, take the letting of the
! contract from the hands of the city and award
' it toothers; and, as the work would be done
! for $2000 less than Tuohey's price, that mdi!
-! yidual would De "frozen out" and prevented
j from entering into the business of bituminous
j street laying in competition with members ol
I the alleged rock combine.
Wneu personally interviewed on the subject
Tuohey said: "There is no doubt in my mind
that this combine of San Francisco rock
I men will go to great lengths to prevent me
getting this contract, as they know that if I
: once get a foothold in this elaaa of work they
j will never be able to compete with me again in
| Sacramento. They have even advanced the
1 argument that 1 had no machinery to work
\ with. That is true, but I have plenty of money
; with which to purchase it. After the time for
i placing bids last Monday had expired 1 was
approached by one of the members of the com
| bine, who desired to know what my price was.
I told him and then, 1 understand, an attempt
was made to have another bid smuggled in.
j 1 was informed that inferences were made that
: an attempt might be made to bribe Mr. Des
i mond, clerk of the board, but that gen;leman's
i honesty was beyond cavil, and, besides, it was
i found that any attempt to approach him would
! result in prompt bodily injury to the party
i making the attempt, so the acneme had to be
i abandoned."
Mr. McDonald denounced as absolutely
false the intimation that there was a com
! bination among the dealers and contrac
| tors in bituminous rock. Mr. Tuohey
1 could get all the bituminous rock he
\ wanted at the market price from the Santa
Cruz mines, represented by Mr. McDonald,
' or from the San Luis Obispo mines, repre
-1 sented by Mr. Perrine, or from half a dozen
| other sources.
The facts of the case are, according to
i the version of Mr. McDonald, that the
I City Trustees of Sacramento and the State
I Bureau of Highways neglected to notify
the bidding contractors from San Francisco
I of the fact that the State rock-crushing
j plant at Folsom would be in readiness to
| deliver rock for the "concrete at 50 cents
i per ton delivered in Sacramento. Not be
ing aware of this highly important fact,
the outside contractors bid on the esti
' mate that the rook for the concrete would
j have to be purchased from private sources
|atsl 50 per ton. This made a difference
! of $4000 in the estimate.
James Tuohey, the Sacramento con
tractor, had the tip on this, and underbid
McDonald in the aggregate $2100 on the
thi*e contracts advertised. On one of the
contracts aggregating $27,000 he underbid
McDonald only $(300 in round numbers.
On the night on which the bids were
opened, K. C. Irvine, one of the members
of the State Bureau of Highways, an
nounced that the plant at Folsoni would
furnish broken rock for the work at 50
cents per ton delivered in Sacramento.
Then Mr. McDonald and the representa
tive of N. I*. Perrine, who were the prin
cipal bidders on the work, saw that they
had been captured by a joker.
They protested against this unfair treat
ment, which was designed to cinch the
property-owners and the State out of at
least $4000, tne difference between the
price of the State rock and the private
rock on which the San Francisco contrac
tors had bid. But they were not allowed
to change their bids, and Tuohey got the
contract.
The work was let under the Vrooman
act, which provides that within ten days
of the letting of a contract for street work
the property-holders may, upon petition
of three-fourths of the frontage of the pro
posed work, enter into a private contract
with any other person (usually one of
their own number) at the same price as
that to be paid the successful bidder.
Then the person who represents the prop
erty-owners may sublet it to any one he
pleases at a lower rate. This law was de
signed for the protection of owners oi real
estate against combinations and pools by
contractors.
Thus if the contractors combine upon a
figure which is deemed too hieh, any one
else may step in and by offerine to do the
work lower may secure the job by private
contract. The whole matter rests with the
owners of the real estate fronting on the
line of the improvement. The State, rep
resented by the Capitol Commissioners,
owns one-half the frontage, and all that
will be necessary to take the contract out
of Tuohey's hands and save several
thousand dollars to the State and the citi
zens will be the consent of the Capitol
Commissioners and one-half of the remain
ing property -owners.
George Perine, under the provisions of
the Vrooman act, has offered to do the
work by private contract $2000 cheaper
than Tuohey's bid. This reduction repre
sents the difference between the price of
the State rock and that offered by private
persons, and the matter is now before the
commissioners.
"I think that City Trustee Kent has
placed himself in an indelicate position
by appearing before the Commissioners as
the advocate of Contractor Tuohey,"
added Mr. McDonald. "Mr. Kent as a
member of the trustees, and of the Street
Committee, will have to pass upon Mr.
Tuohey's work and upon his bills."
Mr. McDonald followed this remark with
a statement to the effect that on motion of
Kent some time last year the City Council
of Sacramento was induced to give to Con
tractor Tuohey for $10 or some such nomi
nal sum a lot of cobblestones for which
Mr. McDonald had offered Trustee Kent
$150. Trustee Kent informed the Council
at the time he made the motion that the
sum offered by Tuohey was all that could
be obtained for the cobbles, that the city
had no use for them and no place to store
them.
HE FELL SIXTY FEET
Miraculous Escape of a Boy
at the Second-Street
Cut.
He Climbed on Top of the Bridge, Lost
His Balance and Rolled to
the Bottom.
Francis G. Parker, a boy 6 years of age
livintr with his parents at 347 Fifth street,
had a miraculous escape from death yes
terday afternoon.
The boy and Eone companions were
playing on the bridge across the Second
street cut, which is about sixty feet high.
He climbed on top of the railing within a
few feet of the end of the bridge, lost his
balance and fell.
He fortunately struck on a heap of sand
which jutted out from the side of the em
bankment, thereby breaking his fall, and
rolled over the rocks and bowlders till he
landed in a heap at the bottom of the cut
Some bystanders who saw the boy rolling I
down from such a height ran toward him !
expecting to find his lifeless body. Blood ;
â was flowing from a long gash on the top of
his head and a deep cut on his chin, but he ,
was still breathing. .
The patrol wagon was summoned from
the Southern Police Station and the boy
was driven to the residence of his parents. j
They had been expecting him to return j
every moment to go to the park with j
them, and it was a terrible shock when
they saw what they supposed; his mangled j
body in the wagon. ' They jumped into i
the wagon, which was driven as rapidly as !
possible to the receiving hospital.
â  The boy recovered "consciousness and I
bore himself bravely while Dr. Thomp
son stitched and dressed his wounds. The
cut on his head extended clear across his I
scalp,, and, although' deep, the skull was |
not . fractured. Strange to say no bones ;
were broken. He was taken home by his
parents and will be all right again in a few
days.- . . . â¢

ridge, the owner of the fourteen $1000 j
United States Government bonds thatwere i
stolen.
They visited police headquarters yester
day atternoon and had a consultation with
Captain Lees, after which they went to the
City Prison and had a brief interview with
Loughridge. They will jro to Sacramento
to-day to get Governor Budd's signature to
the requisition papers.
The habeas corpus proceedings will come
up again this morning before Judge Slack.
Captain Lees has been informed by Carroll
Cook, attorney for Loughridge, that the
proceedings would be dismissed, and the

FROM WINTER QUARTERS
The Corinthian Yacht Club With
Its Fleet Out in the
Open.
GETTING THINGS SHIPSHAPE.
They Will Open the Season of '96 on
April 25 With a Big High
Jinks.
Yesterday the old wooden drawbridge at
the entrance of the Tiburon Lagoon was
raised to let out the white-canvased flyers
of the Corinthian Yacht Club. Last Octo
ber the fleet went into winter quarters in
the lagoon, and the old drawbridge has
kept faithful watch and ward over their
hibernation. So yesterday morning the
merry, merry clubmen, with the auxiliary
power of two big draught horses, hauled
on the ropes and pullies, and the yachts
were liberated for the season's sport.
As each enlivened craft passed through
the draw it was greeted with cheers from
the launches and rowboats lined up
abreast outside of the lagoon and on the
shore. All of the graceful craft left the
moorings and slipped out into the broad
waters of the bay except the sloop, yacht
Ceres. She draws five feet of water, and
her iron keel was firmly glued to the
muddy bottom. Two launches pulled
strongly on towlines, but the low water
and the adhesiveness of her winter bed
defied their efforts and she stuck. A high
tide and a tug will start her and she will
join her sisters shortly.
The yachts that were taken out were as
follows:
Witch, W. Brooks; Secret, G. G.Barlage and
T. T. Trncy; Elece, F. F. Ames; Pride of the
Bay, William Nutz; Miguon, G. V. Beber;
Freda, A. Lyons; La PalomÃ, E. G. Carrera;

Bros.; Truant, . l. W. Pew; Venture, William
Komaini; Pinta, F. E. Schoeber; Thelma, S. B.
Stevenson; Cisnc, H. L. Head.
They were taken to their moorings in
front of the Corinthian clubhouse where
the work of trimming ship was com
menced. Spars were scraped and put in
place, the rigglne set up and the decks
scrubbed and sundown found the white
squadron in shipshape condition for flight.
It was a beautiful day, sunshiny and
without wind, and the bay around
Tiburon was like a sheet of glass.
C. G. Taylor's new yacht Emma had her
i snowy canvas spread. The absence of a
i breeze left her stationary on the wavel'ess
i surface of the water.
The Corinthians have decided to open
ihe season April 25. On the afternoon of
that day they will entertain their lady
guests at the clubhouse with a varied pro
gramme of music, dancing, rowing and
sailing. In the evening the club members
will hold a hiith jinks and discuss the
work for the summer. Next day the
yachts will cruise in squadron and the
season of 1896 will begin.
A LADY'S MISTAKE.
Mrs. I.mwiTH Fires Two Shots Through
a Partition at Policeman
Brown.
Policeman Brown, one of Captain Gil
len's men, had a narrow escape from being
shot on Saturday morning by a lady, who
mistook him foi a burglar.
He was patroling his beat about 1 o'clock
in the morning, when he noticed that the
doors of 1030, 1032 and 1034 Valencia street
were open. The basement of the buildings
was formerly used as a candy factory, but
it and the Hats above have been empty for
some time.
Brown went inside and made his way to
the upper flats, thinking there might be
some one there for no lawful purpose. He
did not rind any one, and as he was de
scending to the basement two shots were
fired at him through a wooden partition.
The shots went wild, but they made
Brown's hair stand on end and he yelled
that he was a police officer. The firing
ceased, and a female voice begged his par
don, ixplaining that he was mistaken for
a burglar.
Mrs. Laseres, the former owner of the
candy factory, lives in the reÂ«r of the
buildings, and it was she who fired the
shots through the partition. Brown ac
cepted her explanation and told her to see
that the front doors were locked in future. I

CRUSHED BY THE CURS
Fatal Attempt of a Boy to
Board a Moving Train
Yesterday.
Willie Warde Meets His Death While
Returning From a Pleasure Trip
to the Cliff.
Willie Warde, an 11-year-old boy, who
with a youthful companion went out to
Sutro's new pleasure grounds yesterday
afternoon, was killed and cruelly mangled
by a train which he attempted to board on
the return trip. The deceased lad and his
companion, Johnnie Thorp, had been en
joying themselves until about 3 o'clocK,
when Willie, who was about three years
younger than his companion, took offense
at a fancied slight and deserted the elder
lad. The latter says he searched about
the grounds for an hour as he knew Willie
had no money to ride.
At last he made up his mind that his
comrade had in some manner started for
home. He then took the train in and on
the way heard of the lad that had been
killed. He was heartbroken when he
identified the clothing of his unfortunate
friend.
The story of the accident, as told by
Engineer James Lamb and passengers on
the train, is that when the Ocean and
Park .train that leaves the beach at 3:27
reached that point known as the links, the
boy was seen walking along the track. He j
stepped aside to allow the train to pass i
him, and as the engine went by he at- I
tempted to board the first car.
He was a little fellow and the feat would
have been difficult for|one skilled in
boarding trains. As a result he fell and
three cars passed over his body cutting
him up frightfully.
The deceased lad has been living with!
his uncle, Joseph Phelan, at 535 Minna ;
stretet. His mother conducts a lodging
house at 416 O'Farrel street.
Engineer James Lamb surrendered him
self last night to the police and was booked :
on a charge of manslaughter. Captain j
Lees subsequently released him on his j
own recognizance.

crop from the landing near Palo Alto to
this City.
The boat stopped here at noon on the
up trip and again at 6 o'clock last night to
take aboard several oi the passengers who
had put in the time here in preference to
the main objective point across the Day.
There were a great many young ladies
