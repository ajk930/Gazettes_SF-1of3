READY TO AFFILIATE WITH

The Coloradan Offered as the Chicago
Sacrificeâ Mantle Joins the
Seceders.
ST. LOUIS, Mo. June 19. âSeveral acces-
(uons to the ranks of the bolting silver men
were received this morning, the most not-
able being Senator Lee Mantle of Montana,
who had refused to leave the Convention
Hall with Senator Teller and his followers
yesterday. The bolters held a conference
late last night, and as a result an address
to the voters of America was issued, de
'daring their independence and readiness
to affiliate with any party that would go
into the campaign on a free-silver plat-
form.
The boom of Senator Teller for the
Presidency has been growing hourly.
Messages have been pouring in upon him
from white metalistsâ Democratic, Re-
publican and Populist â pledging support
if he were placed at the head of any party
(icket launched on a free coinage platform.
y The belief is growing that before the
Chicago conventions overtures which will
result in the choice of the Colorado states-
man as the Democratic standard-bearer
* will be made.
The address issued by the bolters fol
. lows : j
To the People ofthe United States: Obeying the
call of duty, and justified by the common citi
zenship of this Republic, we address this com-
munication to the people and forthcoming
convention of the United States. In doinv so
we claim no authority or right other than that
which belongs to every man to express per-
gonal convictions; but we respectfully solicit
"the co-operation of ail who believe that the
time has come for a return to the simpler and
more direct method of naming men for Na
tional service than has obtained in recent
years.
Political parry organisation is necessary, be-
cause without lt the individual voter is dumb,
â¢ but the party is only the means, not the end:
it is the voice and not the sense. As the world
advances to this wonderful epoch of Intellec
tual development and physical improvement
there is a constant requirement for better
things. The individual feels that requirement
and heeds it or falls in life's endeavor. Par-
ties must also obey the same law. It follows,
therefore, that the moment a party shall
choose to stand still or retrogress it also be
; comes inefficient to achieve the end to which
; the people are necessarily destined. There is
no sanctity in mere party name, and the mark
of decay is set on individual strength in the
Nation when the absolute rule of political or-
ganization coerces man from trie truth for the
sake of expediency and establishes insincere
submission to partizan rule for the sake of
power. . '
Recognizing the value and the splendid
achievements of political parties in this coun-
try as elsewhere, we are yet constrained to be-
lieve that for more than twenty years no one
of them has been entirely sufficient for the
needs of the people. The great trend to better
things resting in the heart and purpose of all
men has been stayed during the latter part of
this generation by the failure of parties to ex-
press in their achievements the highest hope
and aspirations of the mass of the people who
constitute the parties. And there has been
growing In this country, swelling with each
recurrence of National elections, a great mass
of Independent thinkers and voters, which
failing within itself to control, has gravitated
between the two great parties.
Since 1872 (excepting possibly the election
of 1876) the pendulum has swung from side to
side with each four years. In 1872 the Repub
lican party elected the President; in 1876
the Democracy claimed the election; in 1880
the Republican party elected; in 1884 the
Democrats elected ; In 1888 the Republicans
elected; in 1892 the Democrats elected; in
1896 (until within a few weeks) it has been
conceded that the Republicans would elect.
What has been the cause of this mighty
oscillation of a mass which this year has prob
ably obtained controlling proportions? Every
man can answer to himself. If he has been
an observer, if he has had interests that were
affected; if he has felt a hope to see a greater
justice done and has seen that hope blasted;
if be knows that the general dissatisfaction
has arisen from the fact that the party
promises made were broken to the people by
party performance, he knows that as soon as
the election was over and successful candidates
installed they became the servitors of the
party and the advocates of a narrow and non
progressive policy within which alone there
seemed to be an assurance of selfish safety and
partisan approval. During all this period we
have lacked a great constructive administra
tion. No new social truth has been put for- .
ward in an effective way. While in all the de
partments of physical life there have been de
velopments and achievements of ease and
comfort to the favored of mankind, in the
still greater and more important domain of
social reform we have stood still or retro
gressed.
It is not that the people have not felt the
stirrings of determination that this Inaction
has endured, but because of the rule of party
which has largely controlled men In and out
of office. It has been a source of reproach to j
any man that he should renounce allegiance |
to organization. Men have been expected to j
submit their views to the dictation of conven
tions, although it is common knowledge that
conventions have been swayed to views and
declarations not the most approved by the
mass of people, nor conducive to their wel
fare.
We do not arrogate to ourselves one iota
more of intelligence, patriotism or courage
than is possessed by other of our fellow-citi
zens, but we feel that the time has come for
the performance of a duty to the country, and
for our part, though we shall stand alone, we
wil! make an endeavor in the direction of that
duty. Parties may outlive their usefulness,
but truth never becomes obsolete. Every gen
eration of free men has the right to affirm the
truths of past knowledge and present acquire- |
menU, and if the enforcement of these truths
shall make necessary a departure from party
organization the people have this right and
will exercise it until old parties s**hall return to
the truth or new parties shall be created to ef
fect it into law.
If the voices which have sounded to us
The San Francisco Call
from every State in this Union are an indica
tion of the real feelings this year .is the ap
pointed time for the people to assert them
selves, through such mediums as may give
best promise of the achievement of justice.
But whether we are mistaken or not concern
ing the general sentiment in the United States,
we have-not mistaken our own duty in with
drawing from the Republican Convention,
feeling that it is better to be right and with
the minority in apparent defeat than to be
wrong with the majority in apparent triumph.
We hold that in the great work of social
evolution in this country monetary reform
stands as the first requisite. No policy, how
ever promising of good results, can take Its
place. Continuation during the next four
years upon the present financial system will
bring down upon the American people that
cloud of impending evil, to avert which should
be the first thought of statesmen and the first
prayer of patriots.
Our very institutions are at stake. To-day,
with the rapidly increasing population, with
widely swelling demands, , the basis of our
money is relatively contracting, and the people
are passing into a servitude all the more
dangerous because it is not physically appar
ent. The Nation itself, as other nations, is
losing the sturdy courage which could make
it defiant in the face of injustice and internal
wrong. . â¢ Â»V.i I-' j*" <;;â¢; I'Y'Y-rL'Xi
Prices will never cease falling under the sin
gle gold standard. The restoration of bimet
allism by this country will double the basis of
our money system. In time it will double the
stock of primary money of the worldâ will stop
tailing prices and steadily elevate, them until
they will regain their normal relation to the
volume of debts and credits in the world. . Bi
metallism will help to bring about the great
hope of every social reformer, every believer in
the advancement of the race who realizes that
the instability of prices has been' the deadly foe
of our toilers and the servant of the foreign in
terest-gatherers. Bimetallism will help to
bring the time when a certain expenditure of
human toil will produce a certain financial re
sult. Who among the great masses of our peo
ple in the United States but feels that his lot
would be made better, his aspiration take new
wings, if he could know in the performance of
his labor what would be the price of his prod
uct? Is not this purpose worth the attention
of the people as individuals and worth the at
tention of political conventions yet to be held
in this year 1396?
Is this not so great an end that all who be
lieve in the possibility of attaining it by the
means proposed can yield something of their
partisanship both in conventions and at the
polls? It is In the hope that the masses and
the remaining conventions will have the cour
age and the generosity to unite for this purpose
that we have dared to offer our views to the
people of the United States, and because in the
past there has lacked a rallying point for the
masses, who hold as we do to this belief, we
venture an act, trusting that it will be received
in the same spirit of conciliation, concession
and hope with which we put it forth, y '.'â :'.-.
We have endeavored in a plain way to set the
matter before the eyes of our fellow-citizens.
We invoke the union of all men and parties
who believe that the time has come for the tri
umph of justice. It is an hour when the peo
ple may speak for themselves as individuals
and through conventions yet to be held. It is
the right of every citizen to indicate his pref
erences. With this in view, we offer to the
forthcoming conventions and to the peo
ple .a name of a man for. the Presi
dency of the United States â.'whose.
life in public and private represents those
distinguished virtues which adorned the days
and the deeds of the earlier time of this Re
public, a return to which virtues are requisite
for the prosperity and contentment of the peo
ple and the perpetuity and commanding ex-
ample of these institutions. That name is
Henry M. Tellerâ a man of the people and for
the people. He is ot no section. His experience
and service, his devotion to the common jus-
ice and the common cause of his fellow-citizens
has been as wide as the country. We believe
that the people of the United States have him
in their hearts, as he has had their interest* in
bis purpose through all the work of an exalted
life.
It is not merely as the exponent of a mone
tary reform that we present this man to the
people. It is true that he has waged a mighty
war for the restoration of the money of the
constitution, and his name has been identified
as that of no other Jiving man with this great
cause. But had his services been less de

manded and less noticed in this direction, the ;
people -would still have recognized" in him for
other labors a statesman of the purest type.
His only poverty has been that of purse in
all things, etc.â the generosities of ...man to
man, in kindliness of deeds for his fellows
and in the study of the doings of a mighty
career he has been one of the most opulent
American citizens of any ace. In submitting
this name to the people we remind them that
just a generation ago* from the heart of the
boundless West and touched by the finger of I
God there arose an emancipator who was
powerful in work of human deliverance. By
his wisdom and courage, providentially
directed, millions were set free and the "Nation
kept in its holy union. If others shall see this
opportunity as we sec it, if our fellow-citizens
shall see this duty as we see it, that sublime
history may be repeated, and another man
clothed in the majesty of devotion to the
raceâ will be lifted to power where Dy his
wisdom and courage, providentially directed,
more millions may be made free from chains
as galling as those of actual slavery, and the
Nation may be preserved in the unity of its
mission to the world.

thing for the good ot the people of this
country:".
Last night a committee representing
the free-silver Republicans left St. Louis
to confer with Governor Altgeld. Mes
sages were exchanged between the bolters
and prominent Republicans, Democrats
and Populists, and nearly every free-silver
Republican, including most of the bolters,
will go from St. Louis to Chicago to at
tend the Democratic convention.
, Word . was received at the Colorado
headquarters that arrangements had been
made with the railroads to bring over 1000
Colorado Republicans and Democrats to
Chicago. Already Henry M. Teller clubs
are beine organized ia the States repre
sented by the bolters.
It was said last night by one of the most;
prominent men who left the Republican;
party that in a few days Teller would be'
formally placed in. tbe- field as the man
whom the j Democrats can nominate, if
they wish to place a representative Re
publican free-silverite at the head of the
ticket. iY'*
"And," continued . the bolting delegate,'
"if the Democrats straddle or adopt a gold
â¢plank Teller will be nominated by the sil
ver convention, which meets in this city
next month."
The Colorado men have given out badges
on which are printed: "We are solid for
Teller as Teller is solid for silver."
Before the convention was called to order
yesterday morning the men who had de
termined to bolt gathered in the Colorado
headquarters and counted noses. The
round-up showed that there were twenty
two delegates who had stuckâ all the
Colorado and Idaho delegates, three from
Utah, one from South Dakota, one from
Montana and three from Nevada. Each
man pinned a pink rosebud to his coat
and then they left for the convention
hail. " . Â Yv.-*YY;ri \â:-,Y !
After the bolt Senator Teller, Cannon,
Dubois and Pettigrew, with a few of the
other bolters, drove , to, the St. Nicholas
Hotel and talked over the matter in Sena
tor Duoois' ,room. They removed their
delegate badges when they left thel hall
and carried the Colorado banner with
them. They expressed themselves as
satisfied with the treatment they had re
ceived, for most of the hostile demonstra
tions came from the . '"as*. Stab**dele
cations."" They, said' they had succeeded In
carrying out their plans to. the letter, and
felt they had made ,an impression which
would do good to the cause of silver. They
had nothing' to say regarding Senator Car
ter and Senator Mantle, but one of them
ventured the opinion that "Senator Brown
is a dead duck in Utah.''
It was well understood among the bolt
ing delegates that while only one dele
gate from Montana, Congressman Hart
man, went out on the bolt the entire dele
gation was in perfect sympathy with the
movement, including Senator Carter and
Mantle. They had differences of opinion
about the necessity of going out of the
hall, some of them taking the position
that it would be just as effective for the
delegates to remain in their seats silent
and without participating in the proceed
ings as to walk out. It is confidently ex.
pected that the entire Montana delegation
will be found working in perfect harmony
with their bolting colleagues.
â¢ Counting Senators Carter and Mantle
and four Senatorsâ Dubois, Cannon
and Pettigrewâ who went out, there are
six "United States Senators 'who partici
pated in the protest against the gold
plank. ' They constitute almost * one
seventh of the Republican strength* in the
Senate. Their defection reduces the Re
publican representation in the Senate to
thirty-eight and- makes the Republican
vote one less than that of the Democrats.
Ail this, of course, depends upon the ex
tent to which Carter and Mantle join in
the independent movement. The silver
men regard this as one of the strongest
vantage grounds occupied by them.
O. J. Salsbury. a member of the Na
tional Committee from Utah, just re
elected, has announced that he has de
clined to serve and returned his creden
tials. He is a gold-miner and a banker,
and was one of the delegates who walked
out. '' "if -
Mr. Salsbury said he indorsed the action
of the delegates who withdrew, but he dif
fered from Senator Cannon on one point
of expediency. Mr. Salsbury thought
they should resubmit their case to the
people before proceeding further. He said:
"I believe we, as delegates, were acting
only as agents, and that we are not here
in an individual capacity to do as we
think best' after 'the withdrawal without
consulting our constituents, I don't pro
pose to support the nominee or the plat
form that the Republican party yesterday
decided on. "l? regard the financial ques
tion _| paramount to protection or any
Other issues,' and i shall support the can
didate for President who is nearest in ac
cord with my convictions on the financial
question."

M. Depew said to a reporter for the United
Press to-day: "Since the time of Grant

would" be elected by a majority in the
Electoral College without precedent ex
cept for the doubt involved in the silver
result.
- "The secession of the silver States was
dramatic, but its effect, in my judgment,
will not be such as the erring sisters be
lieve. Seventy millions of people have a con
stant interest in the financial and industrial
conditions of the country. Interest in the
production and coinage of silver is large
theoretically, but infinitesimal practically.
â Eight-tenths of * the voters believe j in the
gold standard in businsss to prevent fatal
fluctuation in currency and in labor, so
that the wages one earns may be paid in
the best moneyâ in money which yields
the largest results when used to pay rent,
.meet interest on mortgages, or for the sup
port and education of one's family. There
fore," I believe that for every silver vote
heretofore Republican which will be lost
to McKinley by going to Democratic or
Populist ' candidates there will be three
Democratic cold standard sound-money
men who will.vote the Republican ticket."
Mr. Piatt had this to say : "Like a good
soldier and * a good Republican I accept
the situation and will support the ticket
heartily and believe it will be elected.
There has been much in the contest to
irritate and dishearten the Republicans,
who have not been in accord with the men
who have become masters of the situation.
Our friends are satisfied with the results
of their efforts in compelling the adoption
of a gold-standard- platform. ' That is of
more importance to the success of the
ticket and the ' prosperity of the Nation
than all the rest. It is conceded that the
controlling element of the New York dele
gation led the movement and was instru
mental in accomplishing this object.
"The only other thing that the control-
ling element desired, which they found
unattainable, was the naming of a candi
date from New York State for the Vice-
Presidency. They would have accom
plished that result had Governor Morton
consented to the use of his name for the
second place after the convention declined
to name him for the first place. He would
have consented to the use of his name for
the Vice-Presidency in the interest of har
mony and the success ofthe ticket, but he
learned of the factious opposition of a
small minority of the New York delega
tion and wired peremptorily declining to
permit his name to go before the conven
tion."
"Maine, of course, feels grievously dis-
apDOinted," said J. H. Manley, "that the
country did not indorse its candidate and
make Thomas B. Reed the standard-bearer
j of the Republican party; but Maine is
| used to disappointments. It has always
i been loyal to the Republican party. It
! cast its electoral vote for John C. Fremont
in 1856, and it has never failed to give its
! electoral vote to the candidates of the Re-
J publican party from that day until now.
I It will not break nor change its record in
i November next, and it will give its loyal
support to the ticket nominated yester-
day. The platform adopted by the con-'
vention will receive the cordial support of
every Republican in Maine.
"I have attended six conventions and
been intimately identified with the organ-
ization necessary to. control, and run the
convention several times. I must confess
that the administration of this convention,
which has been under the control of T. E.

A SPONTANEOUS JUBILATION.
Mechanics' Pavilion to Open Its Doors

Programme.
The greatest case of political jubilation
that perhaps this City has ever seen will
take place to-night.
William McKinley has been nominated
for the Presidency. The name stands as
a signal for the incoming of good times.
His election will put a period to the long
era of distress that this country has strug
gled through. The people know this and
will to-day celebrate the beginning of the
new regime. The gathering in Mechanics'
Pavilion this evening, the procession of
the people on the streets, the blare of
brass bands, bonfires and the lighting of
the sky with rockets will serve as the key
note to the opening of the campaign and
indicate the jubilant temper of the people.
The rooms of the Republican County
Committee were the scene of great activity
yesterday. Everybody was busy with
preparation. Letters were being sent out
by the bushel, inviting Republicans that
could be reached in so short a time by
mail to come and lend their presence and
their voice to the great occasion. A sub
committee was busy with the preparations
for the parade.
It is arranged that the procession will
form in the side streets of lower Market
street, with the right resting in New
Montgomery street, near the Palace
Hotel. It will start promptly at 8 o'clock,
and the line of march will be out Market
street direct to the Pavilion. Along the
line of march there will be bonfires at
frequent intervals and the march itself
will be one long streak of red fire, punc
tuated with Roman candles and sky
rockets.
The speaking at the Pavilion will begin
also promptly at 8 o'clock, so that the
celebration within and without doors will
be going on at the same time. This pro
vision is made to prevent confusion and
so that the exercises within the Pavilion
may have full sweep of the evening,
giving each of the long list of speakers a
fair chance.
It is arranged that all the officers of the
County Committee shall make short ad
dresses, with a limit of about a minute
and a half. A limit of about five minutes
will be placed on allother speakers.
The members of the Republican State
Central and County committees will meet
at the rooms of the Union League Club
and proceed in a body to the Pavilion.
The Young Men's Republican League
will form at Justice Kerrigan's courtroom,
new City Hall, at 7 sharp. All young Re
publicans not affiliated with any political
organization are cordially invited to at
tend and fall in line.
- The members of the Woman's Republi
can State Central Club will assemble at
the dressing-rooms of the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Charles Mainwaring, as chairman of the
Republican County Committee, will call
the big assembly together and in the
capacity of chairman will inaugurate the

BLAND IS THEIR CHOICE.
Arkansas Democrats Express
Preference for a Silver
Candidate.
Declare for Free Coinage and Oppose
Bond Issues in Times
of Peace.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 19.â The
Democratic State Convention was in ses
sion until 2:15 this morning. The greater
part of the time was taken up in a hot
fight over the question of expressing the
choice for a Presidential candidate. The
resolution instructing the National dele
gates for Bland was vigorously opposed by
Senators Jones and Berry, but finally
adopted â 420 to 327. The platform makes
no reference to the National administra
tion. The financial plank is as follows:
We favor bimetallism, and to that end we
insist upon the free and unlimited coinage of
both gold aud silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 as the
money of final redemption, with equal legal
tender powers, independent of the action of
any other nation.
We are opposed to the issue of interest-bear
ing bonds for any purpose in time of peace.
We demand that the Government shall not
surrender, but shall always exercise its lawful
option to redeem its obligations either in gold
or silver, as may be most convenient. v â -,'; X .'..â 
We demand the repeal of the present laws
discrediting the silver money of the Nation
and legalizing private contracts, payable in
gold alone. We are opposed to the National
banking system, and favor only the money of
the constitution, and we believe the power and
duty of the Government to furnish the circu
lating medium should not be delegated to any
private corporation.
The delegates to the National Conven
tion were chosen as follows: At large,
Senators Jones and Berry, Carroll, Arm
strong and J. T. W. Tillar; First District,
Charles Coffin, John B. Driver; Second
District, S. M. Taylor, J. J. Sumpter;
Third District, Paul Jones, W. Kramsay;
Fourth District, J. G. Wallace, George A.
Mansfield ; Fifth District, R. B. Davidson,
Phil D. Scott; Sixth District, J. W.
Crockett, A. S. Lay ton.

BOTES AT CHICAGO.
lowa's Choice Confer* With the mana
gers of His Campaign.
CHICAGO, 111., June 19.â Governor
Horace Boies, who is the free-silver candi
date of the lowa Democracy for first place
on the Presidential ticket, arrived in Chi
cago this morning from his home in
Waterloo. He spent most of the day in
his room at the Palmer House.attending
to private business, and disclaimed any
political mission, buthis coming was pur
posely timed so he could bold a conference
relative to the promotion of his candidacy
from this center with Charles A. Walsh of
Ottumwa, secretary of the State Central
Committee; Judge Van Wagner, who will
be the delegate at large in place of Mr.
Boies; S. A. Brewster of Creston; J. S.
Murphy of Dubuque and S. R. Davis, who
is in charge of the Boies literary bureau of
the lowa delegation to the National Con
vention.
Secretary Walsh admitted to a United
Press reporter that the Governor came
here partly to confer with his campaign
managers and see that his literary bureau
was put in working order and arrange for
the formal opening of the lowa head
quarters at the Palmer House on the Ist
of July. Secretary Walsh said his idea
was that the convention would name a
ticKet without regard to the free-silver Re
publican bolt, and none of the delegates
would commit himself as to Teller being
on the ticket.

Telegrams Frcm Many Sections of the
Union to the Party's Standard-
Bearer.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 19.â Canton
was awake bright and early this morning,
notwithstanding the fact that a large pro
portion of the population did not cease cel
ebrating the nomination of McKinley till
nearly dawn. The town already takes on
the temporary commercial aspect peculiar
to the scene of larger gatherings. Fakirs
with campaign badges and fans for sale
thronged the streets, hawking their wares,
and the variety of these is simply amaz
ing.
Opposite the McKinley residence a big
tent has been erected, under which the
hungry and thirsty wayfarers may get re
freshments at the hands of scores of ladies.
The McKinley grounds presented a deso
late appearance this morning; the beauti
ful lawn, the pride and beauty of Canto
nese homes, was bare and brown as a prai
rie swept by tire. A stream of water was
played upon its surface, with the hope of
preserving or restoring it to its former
sightly appearance.
Major and Mrs. McKinley arose this
morning much refreshed by a good night _
rest and feeling none the worse for yester
day's fatiguing experience. During the
night a mass of telegrams had accumu
lated, covering a large desk and running
into the hundreds in number. Immedi
ately after breakfast the major addressed
himself to the perusal of these, and while
thus engaged received a member of the
committee in charge of the preparations
for the local demonstration on the 27th
inst. in connection with the Tippecanoe
Club of Cleveland, and which will be
really the opening of the campaign.
Among the dispatches received was the
following from the Vice - Presidential
nominee:
St. Louis, Mo., June 19.
Hon. William McKinley, Canton, Ohio: Accept
my hearty Congratulations and those of the
New Jersey delegation. V YY;
Garrett A. Hobaet.
To which the major replied :

RETURN OF THE CANTONESE
Major McKinley Thanks the Yoe-
men Who Bore His Banner at
St. Louis.
CANTON, Ohio, June 19.â Shortly after
noon preparations began making for the
reception of the leturning Cantonese, and
the neighboring bouses began filling up
with residents of the city. Market street,
on which the McKinley residence stands,
is the site of numerous handsome resi
dences surrounded by wide-spreading
green lawns. These, with the gay decora
tions, which were not confined to the
houses alone, but covered the. grounds as
well, made a brilliant and attractive scene,
heightened by the bright dresses of scores
of Canton's beautiful women and girls.
The McKinley house was a busy place in
a quiet way. A stream of callers, mostly
residents of the surrounding country,
manded the major's frequent presence on
the porch for a handshake. The intervals
he spent in conversation with a few trends
in the library, varied by frequent visits to
the parlor, where Mrs. McKinley and a
party of lady friends spent the day.
Incidents more cr less interesting were
not wanting, as, for instance, the arrival of
J.W.Smith, a colored man ''of Ohio,"
who insisted upon seeing the major to pre
sent in person an application for a posi
tion. . He failed to see him, however.
There was an unexpected delay in the
arrival of the train, and it was after 6
o'clock when the music of the band an
nouced the approach of the delegation.
As they came up one street a delegation
of several hundred from Trumbull and
Mahoning counties marched up a parallel
street and they simultaneously entered
the yard, front and rear, completely filling
it. At that time the adjoining streets
were jammed, fully 10,000 people being
within sight of the house.
Major McKinley received the triumph
ant pilgrims under the trees in the side
yard, and received from them such a trib
ute as seldom falls to the lot of man. It
was a memorable scene.
Standing bareheaded just at the corner
of the house, Mrs. McKinley sitting in a
SENATOR LEE MANTLE OF MONTANA, THE LATEST TO CAST HIS LOT
WITH THE SILVER BOLTERS.
window behind him, from which she
could see and hear all that occurred, was
the friend and neighbor of the excited and
enthusiastic throng, the center of interest
of a whole nation, pale but outwardly
composed, save for a glistening of the eye
that would not be repressed, listening
first to the cheers of the assembled thou
sands and then to expressions of regard,
respect, esteem and affection.
When quiet had been restored Con
gressman R. W. Taylor of the Twelfth
District addressed the major. He* said: â¢
"The delegation which a few days ago
left Canton with high hopes returns to
you with these hopes realized and with
the pleasing knowledge that, as you are
honored and loved here, so you are hon
ored and loved wherever the American
flag floats. We know the same devotion
and loyalty, the same courage and con
science, the same capacity and patriotism
which have distinguished you from the
beginning will characterize your labors
in the wider field to which the American
people will soon call you."
He was followed by Judge Baldwin of
Canton, and then by Judge Day, who, on
behalf of the ladies of Richmond, Ind.,
where the delegates took breakfast this
morning and held the first McKinley
meeting in that State, presented a box of
roses to the major for his wife.
As Major McKinley mounted the dry

goods box serving as _ rostrum it was
plainly seen that he was deeply moved,
but mastering his emotions he said:
My Fellow-Citizens: How can I make a fit
ting response to the splendid . tribute which
has been paid by three of my oldest and earli
est friends? I think I might be excused by
merely saying that I am inadequate to the
task and can only express my gratitude from a
full and overflowing heart I have had a good
many touching incidents in |my life. Yester
day, immediately after the nomination, I was
surrounded by my neighbors and . fellow-citi
zens who did not so to St. Louis, and friends
from Massillon and Alliance, and then came
more of them from the city of Akron last
night With all these tokens I was deeply and
profoundly Impressed, but somehow the words
spoken by these gentlemen, surrounded as I
am by their associates .who journeyed to St.
Louis, somehow they have touched me more
deeply and have sounded the depths of my
heart more profoundly than anything that has
gone before. -
In this audience to-day are representatives
from all of the counties which for years con
stituted my Congressional district, and with
which I have been associated all my life. A
large body, of my fellow-citizens are here from

[Great applause]. A large number are here
from Mahoning County [cheers], the place
where I spent all of my boyhood; the county
where I received my education, and from
which I enlisted in the war for the preserva
tion of the Union away back in 1861. [Loud
cheerine]. I came to Stark nearly thirty years
ago. You have all been my friends ever
since. [Loud cheer 3].
I will only add that I thank each and every
one of you from; the bottom of my heart for
these manifestations of frie_d*<hip, your devo
tion and loyalty. Canton and Stark County
could not help but make a good impression at
St. Louis, and Mahoning County, too, so they
all sent their best men. lam surprised that
most of them snould have been honored with
any title below "Colonel. [laughter], and as
you seem to have brought back what you went

say that they are glad to see you home again.
[Cheers]. 'XjY'XX-
While this neighborhood reception and
reunion was in progress the front yard
bad been invaded by the victorious host of
the McKinley League of New Yoric, in
cludinz the seventeen McKinley delegates
from that State. Their train was held at
the station for the call to be made, and as
time was precious, Mr. McKinley hurried
through the house and on the front porch
faced the 200 eager- faced New Yorkers, who
split the air with yells as he came through
the door.
John F. Mulholland acted as master of
ceremonies, and calling for order, said
they would be addressed by the next Gov
ernor of New York and the next President
ofthe United States. Warner Miller in
troflttced Major McKinley in a few words.
"My fellow-citizens of New York: It
gives me very great pleasure to meet and
greet you here at my home to-day," Ma
jor McKinley responded. "It was most
generous on your pait to have paused in
your journey to the East long enough to
give me the pleasure of meeting you face
to face. .What we have to Jo this year,
my fellow-citizens, is to keep close to the
people. [Loud cheering.] Hearken to
the voice of the people, have faith in the
people, and if we do that the people will
win for us a triumph for that zreat, mas
terful principle which in all the years of
the past has given us plenty and prosper
ity."
A few remarks by George E. Mathews of
of Buffalo, president of the league, closed
the speech-making, and the members
hastily took their departure and resumed
the journey homeward.
While the Major was at dinner a col

for the campaign, to their great entertain

TELLER'S STRENGTH.
Skinner of North Carolina Says the
Democrats Could Win Under
His Banner.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 19.â bolt o
Senator Teller and his free-silver associ
ates yesterday has caused politicians all
over the country to calculate his strength
as tbe Presidential candidate of the free
silver Republicans, Democrats and Popu
lists. The conclusions differ widely, but
that of Representative Skinner, Populist
of North Carolina, is entitled to as much
serious consideration as any. Mr. Skinner
is an advocate of Mr. Teller's nomination
by the Democrats and Populists as their
candidate for the Presidency. He said :
"Mr. Teller's strength is so very great
and he is so conspicuously the man for
this emergency that it will almost amount
to a crime if the opportunity is permitted
to pass unimproved. The Democrats,
however, must take the initiative, as they
meet before the Populists, but if they will
indorse him on a free silver platform the
Populists will accept him and give him
their full support at the polls. Mr. Teller
would be a much stronger candidate than
a free silver Democrat. He could poll
the silver strength of the three parties.
and would be at least seventy electoral
votes stronger than any Democratic bi
metallist in the country. A Democratic
bimetallist could, under favorable circum
stance, hope to carry only these States:
Alabama. 11 Texas IS
Arkansas 8 i Virginia 12
Florida. 4 Montana 3
Georgia 13 Idaho 3
Kentucky.... .13 Colorado 4
Louisiana 8 .Nevada 3
Mississippi 9 Utah .- 3
North Carolina 11: Indiana IS
South Carolina 9 Missouri 17
Tennessee 12 j Illinois 24
Total 197
"Now, Mr. Teller would carry all those
States and these in addition:
California 9, Oregon 4
Kansas 10 â  Washington 4
Nebraska 8 Wyoming 3
North Dakota 3 Michigan 14
South Dakota.... 4, Minnesota 9
Total 68
Total Teller strength In Electoral College, 265.
"I think these figures will stand the
most thorough examination, and I cannot
for my life see how the silver men in the
Democratic party, who will undoubtedly
control the Chicago convention, can fail to
give us Teller as the silver candidate."

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 19.â A few be
lated stragglers, feebly echoing the tumult
of the past four days, is about all that re
mains here to-night of the great conven
tion. The exodus began immediately upon
adjournment, and every out-going train
since that hour has been crowded. The
first to arrive were the legion of newspaper
correspondents, and they are the last to
leave. Most of the uniformed clubs left
this morning. All were escorted to the
Union station by local marching clubs.
There remain, however, a number of
men who added an exciting chapter to
political history. The dissenting delegates
who left the convention were as busy to
day as earnest men can be. Senator Lee
Mantle of Montana, who stayed in the
convention, but voted against the plat
form and the candidate, in a fate edition
of the Chronicle this morning casts his lot
with the bolters. His signed statement
follows:
Although not having actually withdrawn
from the late Republican convention, I am
nevertheless firmly of the opinion that in the
adoption of the single gold standard the Re
publican party has abandoned one of its
cardinal principles of faith, and I cannot sup
port it in that position.. I believ. that Henry
M. Teller represents, In the fullest and highest
sense, the true principles and purposes of the
Republican party as advocated by Lincoln,
Grant and Blame. I fully indorse the sug
gestion of his candidacy for President and do
not hesitate to say that if nominated I shall
give him my hearty support. And I urge
upon all who believe in the principles for
which he stands to do the same.
I take this position in my Individual capac
ity, and not as a delegate representing the
State of Montana. Lee Mantle.
Since the dramatic incidents of yester
day the Populists . have been active in en
deavoring to profit by the bolt. A hastily^
called conference of Populist leaders was
held at the Lindell Hotel to-day. There
were present Chairman Taubeneck of the
National Committee; A. Roselle, National
committeeman from Missouri; J. H.
Davis, National Committeeman from
Texas; Eugene Smith, National Commit
teeman from Illinois, and a large number
of local Populists.
Chairman Taubeneck would not give the
details of the conference, but said the
principal topic discussed was how to pro
ceed in tendering or accepting overtures
from all the friends of silver. *. V
" Mr. Taubeneck was anxious to know
whether the silver men would pledge their
votes and influence to the party that would

the whole weight of the coming statement
from "the Populists.
"The Populist party is perfectly neutral
on the tariff question," said Mr. Taube-
neck. "We will accept either a high, or
low tariff, if the man or party merits our
votes on the silver question. That we con
sider the main question before the country
to-day."
Others at the conference seemed anxious
to know if the Democratic party was likely
.to take up Teller. One of the results of
this conference will be an address to the
country which will shortly appear.
DUBOIS AT THE HELM.
All Matters Relating to the Bolting
Movement Placed In His
Hands.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jane 19.â At a meet
ing of the withdrawing delegates held this
morning, at which the address to the
American people was agreed to and is
sued, it was ordered that until a formal
organization should be perfected all
general matters relating to this move
ment, so far as these delegates were con
cerned, should be under the direction of
Senator Fred T. Dubois of Idaho. This
was done by the unanimous vote of the
men signing the address. Senator Dubois
will remain in the East for some time,
and will doubtless be at the Chicago con
vention. The others, including Senator
Cannon of Utah, will start at once for the
West.
Senator-elect Foraker of Ohio, who is
stopping at the same hotel, dropped into
the silver headquarters this afternoon to
say good-by to the delegates, all of whom
he knew personally.
STEWART'S OPINION.
Strength Shown by the Sliver Men
at St. Louis Regarded as a
Hopeful Sign.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 19.â Senator
Stewart of Nevada, who is at the Hoffman
House, regards the action of Senator Tel
ler and the men who followed him out of
the St. Louis convention as .significant in
the highest degree.
"Senator Teller represented the real
sentiment of nine-tenths of the people
west of the Mississippi River," said he,
"and three-fourths of the people of the
United States. To me it appears a hope
ful sign and very remarkable that 105 men
could have been found in the convention
to vote as they did against the consoli
dated bank influence of Europe and
America.
"The Democratic friends of silver have
succeeded in electing a majority of the
delegates in favor of the United States and
against English rule, and are anxious to
make an honest effort to rescue the party
which Cleveland betrayed from the con
trol of Pierpont Morgan, the Belmonts
and their associates. It remains to be
seen whether politics and intrigue will de
bauch the convention at Chicago."
Galusba A. Grow, Congressman-at-large
irom Pennsylvania, says that the Repub
lican bolt will not mean a loss of more
than seventy-five votes in the electoral
college.
PACIFIC COAST SENTIMENT.
Celebrations In Several Towns In
Ratification of the Action at
St. Louis.
SAN LUIS OBISPO. Cal., June 19.â A
grand ratification meeting was held here
to-night to celebrate the nominations at
St. Louis. It was under the auspices of
the Republican club and enthusiastic Mc-
Kinley people. A large platform had been
erected on one of the main streets, where
J. D. Fowler called the meeting to order
and stated its purpose. Speeches were
made by local orators, a brass band sup
plied music, large bonfires were burning,
anvils Doomed and the street was crowded
with people. It was the opening gun of
the campaign, and everything points to a
large Republican vote in this city in the
fall'
. SANTA ROSA, Cal., June 19.â The
news of the nominations at St. Louis was
received here with profound satisfaction,
and a mass-meeting of enthusiastic Re
publicans will ratify the Presidential
ticket on Monday night, There will be a
salute of anvils, speeches by prominent
citizens and music by a brass band and
glee club.
COLUSA, Cal., June 19.â The Republi
cans of this vicinity gathered here to-night
to express their approval of the action of
the St. Louis Convention, and the nomi
nation of McKinley and Hobart. Bands
were playing and anvils booming, and
hundreds of rockets were touched off.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., June 19.â A big Re
publican rally was held on the plaza to
night to ratify the work of the St Louis
convention. Ringing speeches were made
by General Eli H. Murray, Senator
Withington, Assemblyman Guy, Irving B.
Dudley of the State Executive Committee
and others.
AUBURN, Cal., June Republicans
here will ratify the National ticket to
morrow night by organizing a McKinley
campaign club. In an interview, F. P.
Tuttle, acting chairman County Central
Committee, says: "I believe the ticket is
very satisfactory to the majority of the
Republicans here. I have always been
for McKinley and preferred Hobart to
Morton. Of course the gold plank will
put a chill on our enthusiasm in the be
ginnintr, still I believe California will vote
ior McKinley and protection."SIGHTS ON THE SAN LORENZO.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 19.â T0-day
the Santa Cruz Venetian Water Carnival
wes distinctively worthy of the name. j
Nothing hut the Adriatic city itself could ,
have been more Venetian. Had one of the j
Doges of old returned to earth and ap
peared in the city of the Holy Cross he j
would have felt entirely at home. Indeed, j
the blue sky and balmy air of this Cali
fornia's most beautiful seaside city, is
reminiscent of sunny Italy.
The third day of the fiesta dawned glori- ;
ously and hundreds of people were early
on the streets or promenading the beach j
watching the waves break on the gleaming !
sand. There was happiness in the air and
a great joy in the mere fact of living where
Nature is at her best.
This was in reality a "water" day. All !
of the festivities took place upon the j
Laguna de Carnival and the people who
witnessed them were numbered in the ;
thousands.
One o'clock was the hour set for the
commencement of the performance, and
by that time all the seats on the shores of
the lake were a mass of color. Bright
faces and beautiful costumes were set
amid a background of waving fans swayed
by the hands of the lovely women of Cal- \
ifornia.
A few minutes past 1 the Venetian
river fete commenced. It was a magnifi- j
cent pageant of floral floats and artistic i
novelties in watercraft. Life and beauty j
were the order of the day.
It was scheduled that Governor Budd !
and Queen Josephine would review the
procession as it passed the royal palace, j
The Governor, however, failed to arrive,
and as a consequence her Majesty was at- \
tended only by her prime minister, B.
K. Knight. They did their parr, however, !
a- well as if the Governor had been there. ;
The beautiful procession of flower-covered
Boat! passed by in perfect order, each
seeming lovelier than its predecessor. The '
audience not only had a view of each float ,
as it passed but also a duplicate of it as it i
was reflected on the clear surface of the j
water. I
The first event of the day was the libera- |
tion of a number of homing pigeons,
which were brought from San Francisco. '
The birds were not very lively when first
liberated, but they soon ascended to a \
great height, hovered in the atmosphere a t
few moments until they got their bearings,
and then started toward the north. At a
late hour to-night nothing had been heard I
from them, although it was supposed that
they would reach their destination within '
three Pours. It was beautiful to see the j
dozens of pearl-colored creatures when
they first realized the joys of liberty after
their long confinement. They seemed
surprised and uncertain as to which way |
to fly and hovered over the lake a few sec- i
onds before making their swift ascent.
The procession started with a grand
overture from "Raymonde" by the or-
chestra.
The floats came from the lower end of
the lake, passed in front of the grand-
stand and then under Queen Josephine's
throne. Bound and round they glided
again and again, and yet the audience
never tired of them.
Each float came in for its share of praise,!
but Mrs. J. R. Chace's seemed to strike
the audience as a little more original than
the others. It was California beyond a
doubt. It was called the "Poppy float"
and was occupied by Mrs. J. R. Chace,
Mrs. Jeter and a party of friends. In gen
eral shape the float resembled an ordinary
Sailboat, but the sails were made of wire
netting with countless yellow popnies
sewed upon it.
The sides were covered with California
flowers and the general effect was original
and beautiful, and called forth rounds of
applause.
All of the floats were "beautiful, but of
course some were more pleasing to the
audience than the others. The barge from
the Holy Cross School came in for a good
deal of applause. It was in white and
silver and appeared to bediawn by butter
flies. No details were neglected. Its gen
eral form was graceful and pleasing and
the color scheme beyond criticism.
Within the float a number of young ladies '
Lively Times at the Santa Cruz Agency of "The Call" After the Arrival, of the Sp-cial Train.
from the school were seated. All were at
tired in white, and with their pretty faces
formed a graceful picture.
The "White" barge belonged to the So
cial Singing Club. It was in charge of
Professor Hastings, but unfortunately met
"with misfortune. For some unknown
reason it sank. The crew were all rescued
without great difficulty, but there was no
more vocal music during the afternoon.
The incident added greatly to the amuse
ment of the audience from the fact that
at the time of the disaster the singers were
doing their best to produce the harmoni
ous notes of "One More River to Cross."
Uncle Billy Bias had a barge of his own
and of his own kind. Uncle Billy was
thoroughly at home in, it and caused con
siderable amusement.
The "Marshal Kid" was also in a class
by himself and naturally broke all rec
ords. He was funny, too, in fact a great
deal funnier than many others who tried
to be amusing.
The Queen's barge was, of course, a
thing of beauty. It was in white and yel
low and propelled by a dozen lusty oars
men, who for the time being were galley
slaves.
Hihn & Co. had a beautiful float in yel
low and white. It represented a bell and
was entirely covered with flowers.
There were numerous other floats which
covered the water so thickly as to almost
hide it from view.
All was a scintillating movement of
bright colors and graceful form.
During the afternoon Roncoiveri's band
rendered the following programme:
Grand overture, "Haymonde" Thomas
Petite vals, "Flirtation" Sleek
Excerpt om "Robin Hood" De Koven
Solos for Messrs. Kent, Mahood and Schemer.
Intermezzo, "Forget Me Not" Mac Beta
March, "I* Hesia" Roncovleri
Descriptive fantasia, -'The Midnight Patrol of
the Shrtners" Donigan
Grand overture, "Orpheus" offenbach
'â¢Toreador et Andalouse" from "Bai Costume"
Rubinstein
Patrol. "The Passing Reeiment" Coverley
March, "*tcosemite" Stetzel
If the scene was beautiful during the
day, when night came it was beyond de
scription. . The palace and Queen's throne
appeared in light colors against a sky of
indigo. The waters of the lagoon seemed
like ink, except where they caught the re
flection of the palace and the barges.
Over the surface of the lake countless ves
sels moved, each illuminated by dozens of
Chinese lanterns. The bulls were visible
for a moment in the glare of the electric
light then disappeared in the shadows at
the end of the lagoon.
Tne incident of the evening was the
mimic engagement between the Monitor
and Merrimac. Both vessels were made
to correspond to the shape of the originals,
but the strongest material used was lath
and muslin, painted to produce an imita
tion of the terrors of the Rebellion.
An attempt was made to carry out the
facts of the great battle in Hampton
Roads. Both vessels approached in proper
order and the firing commenced. Cannon
roared and the smoke of battle almost
concealed the duelists from view. The
ammunition used, however, was the
ephemeral ball of the Roman candle.
Yet it did good work, for the Merrimac
was conquered in proper time and disap
peared from sight. This part of the pro
gramme called forth snouts of approval
from hundreds of throats.
The "sea fight" was the only feature of
the evening, and as soon as it was over the
barges commenced to move.
An entertainment was ' given on the
stage iv front of the palace, which con
sisted of fancy dancing by Miss Nina de
St, Hubert's pupils, a fancy drill by the
Santa Cruz Young Ladies' Drill Corps,
living pictures, athletic exhibition by the
Turn Verein, singing by the Social Sing
Scene in the Pretty Breakfast-Room of the Sea Beach Hotel Half an Hour After the Arrival of
The Call's" Special Train at Santa Cruz.

The fireworks were a feature .of the
evening entertainment. There was not a
moment when some mimic comet was not
cleaving the sky. This part of the pro-
gramme began with a grand salute of
meteors, which, after exploding, descended
in a shower of . golden rain. The last
piece was a pot-pouri of all sorts of explo
sives, such as shells, sky-rockets and
Roman candles. It was a striking wind
up of the third day of the Santa Cruz car
nival.
THE SANTA CRUZ SPECIAL.
Carnival Visitors Appreciate, the Enter-
prise of "lhe Call." '
SANTA CRUZ. Cal. June 19.â sec
ond specil carnival train sent out by tbe
San Francisco Call took this city by
storm. Tbe fact tnat a train would be sent
here was announced yesterday, and when "'
the â¢'flyer" reached the platform of the
Sea Beach Hotel this morning a crowd
was waiting eager to catch a glimpse of, the
great daily. .
The run made by this Call special was
better than yesterday's from a time stand-
point, but in a way not as good. It made
the run in fifteen minutes less time, but no
long stops were necessary. The special left
Fourth and Townsend streets at 3:45 a. m.
j and reached â¢ this . city at 6:30. From be-
ginning to end it was a rapid run. Papers
were thrown off at ail stations along the
road and eagerly grasped by the; carriers. .
People at the Sea Beach Hotel were par
ticularly interested' in the ; arrival of tbe
train. The big bundles of Â» Calls had no
sooner been opened than dozens of people
crowded about to purchase them. Many
of the buyers had attended Queen Jose
phine's ball and were not a little sur
prised to see an accurate, illustrated de
scription of it published in a San Fran
cisco paper hardly three hours after the
guests had gone to their homes.
In less than an hour after the special
train's arrival the pretty breakfast-room
of the Sea Beach Hotel was filled with
Calls. There was hardly a person at the
tables who was not perusing the great
morning daily. The same thing might
have been observed in any of the other
big caravansaries of the carnival city.
The newsboys who were fortunate enough
to secure a supply soon disposed of them.
Will S. Grant, The Call agent, sold over
1500 more than his regular supply.
Mr. Grant has fixed up his place of
business in the most pronounced carnival
attire. Yellow and white predominate, of
course, but the colors are so arranged as
to produce an elegant and pleasing effect.
The Call's special trains to the carni
val city have been a great success, and the
people have appreciated the work in the
most practical way â by buying all the
papers that were for sale.
PINE RIVER DAM BREAKS
Torrents of Water Are Sweeping
Through Pelican Creek Val-
ley, Minn.
Buildings Washed From Their Founda
tions and Carried Away No Loss
of Life Reported.
ST. PAUL, Minn., June 19.â News has
been received by courier that the Pine
River Government dam has broken, and
the water is pouring in torrents through
the valley of Pelican Creek to the Missis
sippi.
The break is about four miles from the
dam proper, and was caused by the water
running over the top of the bank and
making a channel before it was discov
ered, and the water is now rushing
through a break 200 feet wide.. There was
a sixteen-foot head on the dam, which
confined the water of seventeen lakes, all
being bank full. The gates at the dam
were raised at once in order to draw tne
water into the Pine River, which is now
running full.
The water was rising this afternoon at
the rate of one foot per hour in the new
channel- and also in Pine River. The
buildings of A. T. Kimball, a hotel-keeper
at Pelican Creek, have all been moved
from their foundations and some of them
swept down the stream in the new chan
nel. -He saved his stock and furniture.
At Brainerd they are . preparing for a
five-foot rise, in the river, which will make
it two feet higher than during the recent
flood. No lives are reported lost.

DEPEW SHUNNED HONORS.
Enthusiastic Republicans Wishes
to Present His Name for
Second Place.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 19.â Chauncey
M. Depew of New "York will never have a
more flattering opportunity to contest for
a Vice-Presidential nomination man * was
presented to him yesterday. It was a part
of well-founded gossip about the Southern
Hotel last night that an earnest effort was
made at one stage of yesterday's proceed
ings to : induce Mr. Depew to permit his
name to go before the convention for sec
ond honors. .'.-;-
;-,': From the moment of his arrival in the
ball until an ; adjournment was reached
ten hours later, Mr. Depew was easily, one
of the most conspicuous of the many dis
tinguished men present. His first appear
ance on the floor was the signal for a vig
orous hand clapping, both from the spec
tators in the galleries' and the nine hun
dred -and odd delegates. â¢ These cordial
manifestations of popularity were fre
quently repeated, so frequently that it was
obvious that those present desired to ' im
prove every opportunity to ; indicate in
this manner their affection for the great
New York Republican.
> .This was conspicuously so when at the
close of the day Depew arose I for the: last
time to second the motion to make Mc-
Kinley's nomination unanimous. It was
followed by a wave of applause of greater
intensity and duration than/any which
had preceded it.
It was . these . evidences of popularity
that led some of Mr. Depew's enthusiastic
friends in certain of the delegations to re
quest permission to nominate him for the
Vice-Presidency. While he was mani
festly flattered at the sincerity of purpose
displayed by these gentlemen he does not
appear to have been at all influenced by
the suggestion. Politely but firmly he
declined any suggestion of his name in
connection with the second place, and
while discouraging all efforts in that
direction quietly used his influence with
the New York delegation to support the
Eastern candidate, Hobart of New Jersey.
MCKINLEY'S EMBLEM.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 19.â The follow

MORTON DISAPPOINTED.
Sits In Silence for a Moment After
Hearing? of McKinley's Nomin
ation at St. Louis.
ELLERSLEY, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hud
son, N. V., June 19. â When the news of
McKinley's victory in the National Repub
lican Convention at St. Louis was flashed
across the private wire in the residence of
Governor Morton last evening the Govern
or, who had been close to the instrument
all day watching the convention proceed
ings, leaned back in his chair and said:
"McKinley is nominated and the next
President has been named."
There was something of an expression of
disappointment in the Governor's face.
He sat for a moment in silence and then
turning to a representative of the United
Press he said:
"The result is no surprise to me. Since
the action of the National Committee in
regard to the contesting delegates it has
been a foregone conclusion that he would
be named for President.''
LONDON PRESS COMMENTS
Rabid Attack Upon McKinley and
Americans by the Semi-En-
lightened Standard.
LONDON, Exo., June 19.â 1n its issue
this morning the Daily News congratu
lates the Republicans of the United States
if not on their candidate at least on their
refusal to have anything to do with the
mischievous currency delusion.
The Chronicle says: Nothing has been
heard in this country of Mr. McKinley's
personal character, except that it is hon
orable. Yy ->Y
The Standard says: McKinley is neither
distinguished, learned nor wise. It is a
victory of the common-place. Senator
Teller was right when he said that the
gold standard and protection could not
exist together in the United States. If
hard and fast protectionism wins in No
vember a debased currency is almost cer
tain to follow. The foreign policy is to be
truculence and fuss. England must not
assert her rights, but must be thankful for
what the ereat Republic condescends to
give her. It is a reactionary platform in
most respects. . Tne moral level of party
politics has fallen so' low that men of the
stamp of McKinley are about the best pro
curable. They are fully as good as the
Nation deserves.

YOSEMITE STAGE
ROBBER SUSPECTS.
Littlefield and Robinson
Tell of Their Recent
Movements.
A SPECK OF ROMANCE.
Claim They Were Principals in
a Midnight Elopement on
Horseback.
IN WHICH THE GIRL WEAKENS
District Attorney Wallace Thinks
They Might Also Have Held Up
the Stage.
RAYMOND, Cal., June 19.â 0f the
three men who were yesterday arrested on
suspicion of having robbed the Yosemite
stage it is doubtful if either is the crimi
nal. There is a strong set of circumstances
surrounding the actions of Littlefield and
Robinson. For some time past Littlefield
has been engaged to a young lady named
Miss Neva Loc_, who lives a short dis
tance from town. About a month ago the
mother and father of the young lady for
bid Littlefield coming to their house and
since that time the young . lady has not
been in the company of Littlefield.
Littlefield claims that he had a prear- I
ranged plan with Miss Neva that on the
night before the robbery she was to start
for Coulterville, under the pretext of vis
iting her sister-in-law at that place; that
he, in company with Robinson, overtook
Miss Lock, who was accompanied by Miss
Olive Whitfield, at about 1 o'clock in the
moraine between Raymond and Mari- 1
posa, the young ladies having started on j
horseback about the middle of the night ;
in order to avoid the heat of the day, and :
there Miss Lock refused to elope, stating \
that her parents had exacted a promise I
from her to refrain from naving anything I
to do with him.
When Robinson and Littlefield accom- i
panied the young ladies as far as Mariposa j
they turned back and arrived at Raymond
about two hours after the robbery, where
they were arrested.
The officers do not know how much !
credence to give this Btory, until Miss j
Lock is interviewed. The young lady,
is expected, will return from Coulterville
to-night or in the morning.
The day preceding the robbery Littlefield
wanted to change hats with the proprietor ,
of one of the hotels here, and when he was ;
refused he surreptitiously accomplished his i
object later in the day. He was also try- 'â 
ing to borrow a pistol, but was refused by j
every one whom he asked.
Miles Wallace, the District Attorney, ar- I
rived here to-day and has been investigat- [
ing the matter.
He says that under the facts as stated i
by Littlefield plenty of time could have
been had by the prisoners to go about
three miles out of their way, job the stage
and return to town when they did. A few
days prior to the robbery Littlefield was 'â 
"broke" and penniless, and when arrested !
he had several dollars, which he claims
were given to him by Robinson, who, it is â 
said, lately sold his cattle for several
hundred dollars. The preliminary ex- j
amination was set by Justice Ayer at 1 \
o'clock to-morrow, but the complaint now !
on file will probably be dismissed and a <
new one will be filed, as the proper ar-*i
rangement and procedure have been com- j
plied with in the present instance.
ASTORIA'S FISH WAR.
One Cannery Agrees to Pay Five Cents
and Others Will Follow.
â¢ ASTORIA, 0b.,, June 19.â militia
are still here, under charge of General
Beebe, but there has been no trouble of
any kind so far and none is expected.
The proposition of a Scandinavian fac-
Tory to-day to pay 5 cents was accepted by
the fishermen and to-morrow 125 boats
will start out for it. Other canneries are
in operation on a small scale with fish re
ceived from up the rivet. While there
are fair prospects of other cannerymen
paying the fishermen the price asked,
nothing is definite.
The season is now more than half gone. !
From a business point of view the season ;
has been a financial failure on both sides, !
to an extent hard at present to estimate.
It is reported to-night that the militia '
will be recalled because the expense,
about $2000 per day, is not warranted, as
up to th-; present time only nominal occu- :
pation has been found for them. The >
militia are having a regular picnic, j
although the discipline and conduct are j
excellent. Practically no scab fishermen
have accepted the protection offered to go'
out on the river. A few young men about
town without experience made drifts, in :
the river, which has such a large run of '
salmon this year that they made good
catches.
SPOKANE'S COMPLAINT.
Makes an Effort for a Square Deal in
Freight Rates.
TACOMA, Wash., June 19.â parlors
of the Tacoma Hotel have been occupied
all day with counsel and witnesses in the
great freight rate case which the Spokane
merchants are pressing to compel' the
Northern Pacific Railway Company to
cease giving cheaper overland freight rates
to the merchants of coast cities than is
given to those of Spokane.
The question involved is whether the
Northern Pacific Railway Company has
been carrying out the order of the Inter
state Commerce Commission, which re
quires that Spokane freighters shall be
given the benefit of an 82 per cent rate be
tween terminals on perishable goods not
subject to water competition.
J. M. Hannaford of St. Paul, W. A. Un
derwood of New York, C. W. Bunn and 8.
it. Fulton are representing the Northern
pacific Raiiway, and Frank H. Graves of
Spokane the merchants of that city. The
evidence so far given is in favor of the
Spokane merchants. '
PREVENTED AN ESCAPE.
Sacramento Deputy Sheriff Takes a Shot
â¢ at a Prisoner.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 19.â W. C.
Hardie, a County Jail prisoner, had the
life nearly scared out of him to-day by
Deputy Sheriff Conran. He and a man
named Roblin are serving a six months'
sentence for vagrancy. They are the pair
who were arrested last spring for bringing
a couple of girls here from Suisun and
placing them in a house of ill fame. See
ing an opportunity to dash through the
gate, of the jock yard Hardie took the
chances and was running for dear life
when Deputy Conran fired a shot at him.
Hardie dropped, and it was thought he
was shot, but he only did that to save be

in and returned him to the jail. â  ' â¢*>
PAS ADEN ANS FALL OUT.
Suits and Counter-Suits Brought by
Southern California***.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 19.â The
classic suburban town of Pasadena is con
siderably wrought up over the suit of Dr.
Denis S. Green, a prominent physician
there, against W. I. F. Randolph, his wife,
Marie Randolph, and son, T. E. Ran
dolph, for $20,000 alleged damages for
malicious and false prosecution.
. The action is brought in the Suprerior
Court of this county. Dr. Green was ar
rested at Pasadena in March last on com
plaint of the Randolphs. The complaint
charged that the doctor amused himself
one morning by beating his horse as it
stood in a stall in the stable, and that he
kept up the lashing for ten minutes.
-The prosecution alleged that by- reason
of his cruelty to the horse, he brought
himself within, range of the law with re
gard to cruelty to animals.
Green was tried before Justice Morrison
ef this City, and then brought the present
suit, including as defendants, Randolph,
his wife and son. Dr. Green alleges that
he has been a practicing physician in
Pasadena for eleven years past and has
borne a good reputation in the com
munity; that by reason of the prosecution
he has been injured in his business, and
the damage he has sustained amounts to
$20,000.
In their answer defendants allege that
they believed the charge to be true when
the complaint was sworn to and that there
was probable cause to justify them in that
belief. They deny that there was any
thing malicious in the prosecution. . Quite
a number of witnesses from Pasadena are
in attendance at the trial. The impanel
ing of the jury in the case was going on
this afternoon.
RESPITE AT SAN DIEGO.
Murderer Joe Ebanks Should
Have Been Hanged
Yesterday.
Plays the Insanity Act So Effectually
That He May Yet Cheat the
Gallows.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., June 19. â Joe
', Ebanks, the double murderer, was to have
j been hanged to-day. Like most other
i murderers, his neck is still unstretched,
| although he has confessed his crime. An
\ appeal has been taken to the Supreme
; Court, and meantime Ebanks, presumably
I on the advice of others, is playing the in
| sanity dodge, or was until to-day.
For four or five days he has acted as
j crazy as he knew howâ barking, howling,
; throwing dishes and rolling on the floor.
': He butted bis head against the walls of
; his cell, but took care not to hurt himself.
I He became so troublesome that he was
| placed in shackles and straitjacket.
A day or so ago he refused to eat, but
I couldn't keep this up more than two
meals, as his gluttonous appetite was not
i to be controlled by the freaks of his mind.
i Yesterday his tobacco was taken away
from him and this seemed to have brought
â  back his sanity quicker than anything
I else.
Ebanks now denies the troth of his con
! fession and his attorney says he will
make a strenuous effort to save his neck.
i The murderer is good for some weeks yet
| pending the appeal.
TA COMA'S HUNGRY FIREMEN.
Will Leave the Department Unless they
Receive Their Pay. .
TACOMA,. Wash., June 19.â A commit
tee from the Fire Department, one mem
ber from each company, called on Mayor
Fawcett to-day and in a respectful manner
addressed him in the matter of the men of
the department being left without their
salaries and without any assurance when
they may be paid. The exact condition of
the men, who for months have not re
ceived a dollar from the city, was made
plain to the Mayor. After tbe committee
had explained their positiou tbat some
thing will have to be done, they stated
that unless prompt action was taken by
the city officials the firemen would be com
pelled to leave the department in a body.
The Police Department will make a sim
ilar appeal to-morrow.
BAKERSFIELD BUNCOMBE.
Result of the Efforts .of a Pyrotechnic
Grand Jury.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., June 19.â
trial of ex-Deputy County Clerk H. L.
Packard on a charge of falsifying the rec
ords of the county came to an end to-day.
Packard was promptly acquitted. Pack-
ard was indicted by the famous Long
Grand Jury of 1894, which made wholesale
indictments of county officials on evidence
supplied by Expert Edgar Moore of Los
Angeles. It was alleged that he issued a
certificate to J. B. Batz, now County Treas
urer, for one scalp, but entered on the
books ten scalps, drew the money from
the State and pocketed it.
Assistant Attorney-General C. N. Post
came down from Sacramento to conduct
the case at the request of District Attor
ney Fay. Great caie was exercised . in ob-
taining a jury, which was composed of
men of standing. The evidence showed
that the entry complained of was not
made by defendant, but by another man.
The defense put Batz on' the stand and
he swore that he brought one scalp per-
sonally, but sent down nine more in the
same quarter from his home in the moun-
tains sixty miles away, by his half-brother
and received payment for same. The
messenger who brought the scalps is now
in Arkansas, but his deposition had been
taken and was to the same effect.
The defense had the canceled check by
which payment was made to Batz, but it
was not necessary to produce, it in evi
dence. This left the case without any
thing to support it and the jury promptly
found Packard not guilty.
This adds another to the list of indict
i ments found by the Grand Jury, in which
charges have been entirely disproved and
i verdicts of acquittal rendered. Every case
I so far tried has had the same outcome. .
BRITISH PROTECTIONISTS.
Opposition to the Proposed Free Trade
Celebration.
LONDON, England, June 19.â As some
thing of an offset to the tremendous re
vival of protectionism in the United
States and France, .as evidenced in the
popular support accorded to the cham
pions of that cause in those countries, viz.:
William McKinley and Premier Meline, a
grand free trade ; celebration ,is being
planned to take place before the expiration'
of the present year, which marks the
semi-centennial of the abolition of the
corn laws in this country.
There is, however, a considerable protec
tionist element in Great Britain, which
points with satisfaction to the refutation
of Cobden's prediction that England's ex
;ample would be followed by the principal
nations of the earth, in view of the fact
that not only the countries specified, but
also the English colonies without excep
tion, Germany, Italy and Russia, are still
strong in their adherence to protection.
.Many even of the firmest advocates of
free trade discountenance the idea of cele
brating the anniversary, claiming that any
agitation of the subject can but serve to
afford opportunity to their opponents for
initiating a policy of retaliation. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1896.

VISALIA BANDIT.
Si Lovren to Be Imprisoned
the Balance of His
Life.
VERDICT OF THE JURY.
The Leader of the Tagus Train-
Robbers Effectually Dis-
posed Of.
JURORS HEARTILY THANKED.
End of One of the Most Interesting
Criminal Trials of Tulare
County.
VISALIA, Cal., June 19.â three
months ago Si Lovren was arrested for
complicity in the Tagus attempted train
robbery. About 8:30 o'clock this morning
word was sent along the streets from the
courthouse that the Lovren jury was ready
to report its verdict.
It was not many minutes before an in
terested crowd assembled in Department 1
of the Superior Court, where the long
trial has been in progress. Lovren was
brought in by Sheriff Merritt. . He ap
peared, as usual, in his shirt sleeves, and
wore no handkerchief around his neck,
his once-gashed throat having completely
healed and only a scar remaining. After
the jury was polled they rendered thp fol
lowing verdict:
We, the jury, find the defendant, Josiah
Lovren, guilty as charged in the Information,
and recommend and direct that he be Im
prisoned in the State prison of California for
life. M. 11. Lovelace, Foreman.
Lovren's lips murmuring, "Thank God I"
was the only visible sign that the con
victed train-robber showed.
After the jury was discharged and as
they passed into the corridor many of the
spectators pressed around them to shake
their hands and congratulate them upon
their verdict.
Thus was ended one of the longest and
most interesting criminal trials ever held
in Tulare County. The trial was begun on
June 1 and 144 jurors were summoned
before the panel was* completed. Thirty
six witnesses were put on the stand by the
prosecution and twenty-six by the de
fense. There were six rebuttal witnesses.
Six attorneys were engaged in the legal
battle.
Monday, June 23, at 10 o'clock, was the
time set for pronouncing sentence.
This morning business was almost sus
pended, so eager were the people to talk
with and congratulate the jurymen on
their verdict. Maurice E. Power, who
made the closing argument yesterday!
came in for bis share of congratulations,
not only from Visalians but from citizens
in all Darts of Tulare County. YY* -YY

CAMPBELL ESTATE
IN CONTROVERSY.
The Death of James K.
Wells Causes Legal
Disputes.
MURDERED BY DUNHAM
A Question Now Arises as to His
Interest in the Will of
Mrs. McGlincy.
FINE LAW POINTS INVOLVED.
M. T. Brewer Opposes the Public Ad-
ministrator's Application for
Letters.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 19.â appli
cation of Public Administrator J. K. Sec
ord for letters of administration upon the
estate of James K. Wells, son of Mrs. R.
P. McGlincy and one of Dunham's vic
tims, came up for hearing in Judge Rey
nolds' court this morning.
The application of Secord is contested
by M. T. Brewer, the recently appointed
guardian of Dunham's baby, who has also
applied for letters on Wells' estate.
A peculiar question has arisen in the
caÂ«e. Under her will Mrs. McGlincy left
the entire estate to James K. Wells, and
the question is as to whi.h of the two died
first. If Mrs. McGlincy died first then
James K. Wells inherited the property
valued at $35,000, and Percy Osborne
Brewer, as Dunham's child is now known,
is direct heir to the estate. If Mrs. Mc-
Glincy survived Wells and Mrs. Dunham,
her daughter, then her relatives are also
heirs to the property.
Mr. Brewer, who is the baby's guardian,
makes the contention that Mrs. McGlincy
died first, and by reason of his relation
ship he should have control of the child's
estate. Some little testimony as to Mrs.
McGlincy's prior death was offered and
not contradicted. If Wells died first he
would have no estate upon which to ad
minister.
Judge Reynolds, after hearing argument
in the matter, took the case under advise
ment.
FRANKLIN DIVORCE CASE.
Testimony Taken in the Suit by Com-

SAN JOSE, Cal., June 19.â Court Com
missioner Montgomery has filed his report
of the testimony taken in the suit of Mary
J. Franklin for a divorce from Luther T.
Franklin, on the ground of desertion. The
Franklins were married at Stockton in
June, 1892.. At that time Franklin was
engaged m the piano business. In 1894
Mrs. Franklin's health compelled her to
leave Stockton, and she came to San Jose
and made her home with her mother, Mrs.
Elizaheth Judd. .It. was understood that
her husband would dispose of his business
and. follow her . here. Instead, however,
he took another woman and went to Pasa
dena, where he was last heard of. He has
not contributed to her support since she
came home to her mother. " There is no
community property and no children to
wrangle over.
MRS. LOVETT IS FREE.
Secures a Divorce Front the Husband
\ Who Deserted Her.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Juue Francis E.
Lovett was to-day granted a divorce from
Charles E. Lovett on the ground of deser
tion. The Lovetts were married some six
years ago. At the time of her marriage
Mrs. Lovett was a widow and possessed of
some means. She set Lovett up in the sa
loon business, but he began to run around
with other women and deserted his busi
ness and was finally forced into insol

EXECUTION OF KAUMANU
The Hawaiian Monster Hanged
for the Murder of Old
Mrs. Robinson.
One of the Most Atrocious Crimes in
California's History â A Neat
Job at Fo'som.
FOLSOM, Cal., June 19.â Paulo Kau
manu was hanged at the State prison this
morning. Kaumanu was the Kanaka who
murdered an old woman at Latrobe, El
Dorado County, kicking her to death and
robbing her house.
The Hawaiian murderer passed the
night quietly, giving no indication that
his impending fate disturbed his sleep.
He was served with a good breakfast in
his cell and ate fried chicken and other
food. He was then visited by Father
Hunt of El Dorado County and confessed
to him. He then announced himself
for executior-uj
I AtTtwenty minutes past 10 he was con
ducted from his cell to the trap. He was
calm and seemingly indifferent. The cap,
noose and straps were adjusted within
thirty seconds and the trap was sprung.
He said nothing on the trap, and hardly
moved a muscle after being dropped.
About thirty spectators were present,
among whom were Sheriff Hilbert of El
Dorado and several friends of the mur
dered woman.
Several weeks ago Governor Budd was
appealed to by representatives of the
Hawaiian Government to exercise clem
ency in the case of the condemned man,
but after an investigation into the facts of
thÂ« case, he failed to discover any mitigat
ing circumstances and refused to interfere,
The crime -for which Paulo Kaumanu
died was of peculiar atrocity. Mrs. Ellen
Robinson, the woman whom he brutally
murdered two years ago, was old and
feeble and wholly unable to make any
effective resistance. He felled her to the
ground and tnen kicked her until she was
in a dying condition, after which he plun
dered the house and made his escape. He
has never shown any remorse for his deed,
his whole behavior since conviction being
marked by a stolid indifference, which he
maintained to the last. V V
COALINGRUS GUSHER.
Spouts Four Feet and Runs Several
Hundred Barrels a Day.
FRESNO, Cal., June 19.â Tbe report
that a gusher had been struck in the
Coalinga oil fields, in the western part of
this county, has Deen confirmed by the re
turn of several parties who went over to
the oil district to investigate. The gusher
is on Captain Frank Barrett's claim and it
spouts four feet into the air, running sev
eral hundred barrels a day.
The well was capped with great diffi
culty.- An 800-pound weight was first
placed on the cap, but the jet sent it
hurtling into the air. Then 3000 pounds
of scrapiron was used and this held the
cap dows.
The value of the well is estimated at
$25,000. Before the summer is over 100
wells will] be sunk in the district and
Fresno County will receive a great boom
in 'the oil industry.

Yesterday there was noiced a curious
figure of the human fanily. A shade
darker than brown, but black, closely
cut white hair, piercing bUck eyes with
roguish twinkle, short, *w_ll knit, be-
whiskered, he indicated the Englishman.
It was difficult to get him Stated, but be
was at last prevailed upon, aid being at
bottom an affable fellow, -joke of his
travels, his escapes, his curioui meetings,
bis love for California, etc. \
Turning from the light, any, jaunty
manner in which he had been speaking he
became serious. Said he : \
"I have been in San Francisco nÂ»w about
ten weeks, and I have had the de-iil's. own
time of it until about a week ago.s;
"At first I saw the sights and had good,
jolly time. Never felt better. \
"But one - morning I got up with a
dizzy feeling, a pain in my back, a nerv-
ous twitching about the eyes and ether
parts of the body, and really, don't you
know, I was in a bad way, old chap. I
felt out of sorts. Took a little gin. Didn't
help me. Called in a doctor. He looked
at my tongue, felt my pulse, gave a piece
of paper and was off. Things went on
from bad to worse. I began to lose my
memory. I could -no longer concentrate
my mind. I was lost.
"I used to get up at night and trembled
all over. Couldn't sleep couldn't.
"I discovered I bad been on the go too
long.
- "Four weeks aeo, reading your paper
one day, I read about a medicine called
Hudyan. 'What was Hudyan?' said I.
Well, don't you know, I determined at
last to try it. I did so. Now, 1 tell you
what is the matter; no chaffing. This
same Hudyan is one of the most powerful
vegetable vitalizers made. It fixed me up
in no time. Look at me. Do 1 look like a
wreck? Why, lam as good as I was when
21 years old. After I took Hudyan two
weeks I had no pain in the backâ bet-
ter and stronger than I bad for many a
day. It fixed me up spin and span.
â¢_I am liKe a new man. Yes, I will treat
the new man.'*
So ended one of the pleasantest inter-
views had for many a day. After leaving
our English friend I determined to find
out what this Hudyan is. Hudyan! It
haunted me like a specter. Did I need
Hudyan? Should I get Hudyan? What
is Hudyan? Who takes Hudyan? For
what is Hudyan used ? These and a hun-
dred other questions occurred to me. . Ob,
now I know what is Hudyan, It is a
specific remedy for nervous, exhausting
debility, nervous loss of vitality, etc. It
cures Failing Manhood; renews, gives life
to ail parts of the body.
Hudyan is the great remedio-treatment
that has been indorsed by scientific men.

TVO DAYS OF HEAVY FIGHTING
retails of a "Crushing Defeat Which
General Weyler Reported as.
a Victory.
HAVANA, Cuba, June 17 (via Tampa,
FU., June 19).â Tbe event of the week has
been Gomez's splendid victory at Najasa.
Puerto Principe. The details thus far are
meager, the best report received here up
to the present time being from the cor-
respondent of La Discussion, which is re-
garded a? the best informed independent
paper in Havana.
He says Genera! Jiminiz Castellanos left
Puerto Principe on the Bth inst. with 2114
men. 342 horses and rive mounted pieces
of artillery. On the Oth they encamped at
a cattle ranch called Saratoga, where,
about 4 p. m., the attack commenced by a
charge of 1000 rebel cavalrymen with ma-
chetes. From that moment until the
morning of the 11th the insurgents con-
tinued harassing the troops, killing and
wounding many.
The story of Gerueral Castellanos, who
commanded the Spaniards, is that the
Cuban charges were repelled either by ar
tillery fire or by forming hollow squares,
, which the Spaniards consider unbreak-
able. Still Castellanos confesses that there
were moments of great danger, and only
by displaying the greatest valor could the
Spaniards succeed in repelling the attacks
of the enemy. He admits that the num
ber of wounded Spanish troops obliged
him to erect his camp hospital in the
farmhouse of the ranch, a brick structure
which was so riddled with bullets that
some of the wounded men were struck
after being placed inside.
Castellanos also acknowledges that Gen
. eral Godoy's arrival wan very opportune,
since the forty-two hours' fight had ex
hausted his treops. In view of the loss
inflicted on the forces Generals Godoy and
Castellanos decided to return to the city
without pursuing the enemy, who bad al
ready inaugurated their retreat .on Godoy's
approach.
Varela, La Discussion correspondent,
also states that the Spanish troops fired
50,000 cartridges and 30 shells and the
rebels 25,000 shots. He figures the rebel
losses from 400 to 500 and the Spaniards' ;
at &*>. of whom only 4 were killed and the
rest wounded, including two officers. He
concludes his story by simply announcing
the arrival of both columns in Puerto
Principe without stating in what condi
tion they entered thecity; whether all
their commanding officers of high or low
rank returned or who were missing. This
is the Spanish side of the fight, which is
borne out by the official report.
From ' other sources, incomplete and
lacking important details, it is snown that
â¢ Gomez had only 1800 men. General Cas
tallanos' forces amounted to 3500 men.
Gomez, knowing of his rival's approach,
placed the men in convenient positions,
dividing his forces in small groups of 300
men each. As soon as the Spaniards were
comfortably encamped in the ranch, pre-
paring for the next day's attack on
Gomez' stronghold at Najasa, the Cuban
chief suddenly made his appearance and
attacked their positions simultaneously on
all sides.
Taken unawares and completely sur-
rounded, all they could do was to defend
themseives from the continued charges,
which, with marvelous military precision,
were kept up night and day without af-
fording the Spaniards a moment's rest.
Thanks to General Godoy's timely ar
rival with 2500 men, Castellanos was saved
from complete defeat. It is said that if
Godoy had delayed his march six hours
longer Castellanos would have surren
dered, as he was already too weak to stand
fighting much longer.
The actual losses on both sides have not
been ascertained yet. It is only known
that the Spaniards brought with them 320
wounded from the held of action, and if
any were left behind them it is not
known. Report has it that the total Span
ish loss in killed, wounded and missing
was over a thousand.
The sanitary condition of the island is
getting worse every day. Reports are
coming in from every town and city re
counting ravages of yellow fever, small-
pox and other diseases.
Advices from Manzanillo. province of
Santiago de Cuba, show that numerous
parties of rebels belonging to ihe com
mands of Rabi and Jose Maceo, are con
centrating in the vicinity of that city.
Every precaution is being taken by the
Spanish commander there to prevent or
repulse an attack on that city.

THE TRANSVAAL'S DEMAND
Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Beit and
Others Must Be Brought
to Trial.
Obliged to Press This Step On Eng-
land for the Safety of the
Republic.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, June 19.â
The Secretary of State for the Transvaal
has telegraphed the British High Com
missioner here that, having in view the
welfare and peace of South Africa, the
Transvaal Government is convinced that
proofs in its possession, which are at the
disposal of Great Britain now, completely
justify and compel the bringing to trial of
Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Beit and Dr. Harris,
all of the Eritish South Africa Company,
and connected with the raid in the Trans
vaal.
The Secretary adds that the Transvaal
Government is obliged to press this step
on Great Britain, and also urges that all
control of the British Chartered South
Africa Company be transferred to Great
Britain.
Dr. Leyds, Secretary of State for the
Transvaal, has telegraphed to the acting
Governor of Cape Colony, asking him to
transmit to London the demand of the
Government of the Transvaal that Cecil
Rhodes and Alfred Beit, directors of the
British South Africa Company, be imme
diately brought to trial on charges similar
to those against Dr. Jameson and the
other leaders of the raid into the Trans
vaal.
Dr. Leyds expresses regret for the delay
on the part of the British Government of
an inquiry into the complicity of the
British South Africa Company in the raid
and asks that the entire control of the ter
ritory of the company be removed from
the hands of the company and transferred
to the British Government.

CHICAGO, 111., June 19.â A petition
for a decree ordering the sale of the Chi
cago and Northern Pacific Railroad was
presented to Judge Jenkins in the United
States court to-day by the Farmers' Loan
and Trust Company. The foreclosing trus
tee, Simon Sterne of New York, appeared
for the holders of all bonds -except 683,
whose holders could not be found. Judge
Jenkins was assured that the petition was
"not designed to freeze out the smaller
bondholders. In determining the upset
price it was stated that the stock was
valued at 45 cents on the dollar by Wall
street men; which would make the prop
erty worth $13,000,000.
The road will be sold about October 1.
and the decree will be issued in a few days,
the court desiring time to examine the pe
tition and consult with Receiver Hopkins,
The upset price to be fixed by the court
will be $10,000,000. The judicial sale will
terminate the litigation which has sur
rounded the road, which was created by
the Northern Pacific magnates only for a
Chicago terminal. It was said the pur
chaser would be the reorganization com
mittee of the bondholders, controlling 95
per cent of the bonds.

EQUINE STARS WILL BATTLE.
National Derby to Be Decided at St. Louis
To-Dayâ Ben Brush Will
Start.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 19.â The premier
event of the American turf will be brought
off to-morrow at the Fair Grounds track,
when the National Derby, guaranteed to
be worth $20,000, will be raced for by a
splendid field ol track aristocrats. .
Mike Dwyer arrived this morning with
his two cracks, Ben Brush and Ben Eder,
and Byron McClelland brought in Prince
Lief and Nimrod. Ben Brush and Prince
Lief are given top weightsâ l 27 pounds
eachâ while Don Carillo and Argentina
are burdened with only 119 and 117 re
spectively. All the others are imposed
112 pounds. ,"â¢
According to the handicappers, every
horse seems to have a chance, and the
betting will be lively.
It is thought Don Carillo is in too speedy
company, though he is a good finisher for
distance races. Captive, Byron McClel

possibilities, and some of the knowing
ones nod when Captive is mentioned.
The track was never faster than it is to

General Warfield, president of the ex
ecutive committee of the Carnival of the
Golden Gate, bad a telegram yesterday
afternoon from Colonel George Stone, who
was one of the delegates to the St. Louis
convention, announcing that he had a
conversation with Mark Hanna, the man
ager of McKinley's campaign, regarding a
possible visit of the Presidential candidate
to California this year.
Before Colonel Stone left, the matter of
j inviting the Presidential candidates of
| both the Republican and Democratic
j parties to this coast during October was
MISS HENRIETTA LITTLE.
considered. Many considerations were
involved, and it was finally decided tbat
an invitation should be extended. In his
telegram Colonel Stone says: "Hanna
considers proposition a good one, and will
endeavor to accept on behalf of x Mc-
Kinley."
As Colonel Stone has already left St.
Louis for home, nothing lurther as to the
details of the proposed visit will be known
until his arrival.

Miss Henrietta Little, a young lady of
this City who recently made her debut . on
the operatic stage in Italy, has written
from New York to friends here that she
will give a concert for the benefit of the
carnival on her arrival. Miss Little is a
graduate of the Girls' High School and
also attended a number of local private
schools. She intended visiting San Fran-,
cisco for rest and recreation before engag
ing on a European grand opera tour, but
learning of the carnival while in New York
volunteered her services, which will be the
only occasion on which she will appear.
Miss Lit was a pupil of the late Karl
Formes and possesses a rich boprano voice
of great range and" compass. She created
quite a furor in Milan on the occasion of
her debut, and the Italian journals devoted
to -musical.;, affairs speak, in the highest
terms of her vocal abilities. , -.â ::â  â
* Miss Louise O'Brien of Stocuton has
sent in a design for the carnival badges

of; the Golden Gate and bay of Sail Fran

the waters. Over all, two figures repre
senting peace and plenty are floating in the
sky, and ' underneath the picture , Miss
O'Brien suggests the words,"Peace and
plenty reign inside the Golden Gate."

Ed White, a Railroad Man, Mysteriously
Shot and Killed.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 19.â
White, a railroad man, was shot to-night
by an unknown person and expired ten
minutes after tie was found.
Shortly before midnight the police were
notified that a man had been shot on
North - Alameda street close to Naud's
warehouse YY'YYY
The patrol wagon was hurried to the
scene and White was found lying un
conscious in a pool of blood. A large hole
in the leftside, just below and back of the
heart, showed where the bullet had en
tered, while on the right side was
another hole through which the ball had
escaped. , White was hurried to the Re
ceiving Hospital, but died in a short
while. â  . -
'Neither the identity of the murderer nor
any cause for the crime can be learned
now. A. Davis says that he was passing
along Alameda street and saw a woman
Whose hair was badly disheveled being led
from the warehouse by two men. One of
the, men told her to come along, as they
did not want to get mixed up in the fight.
Whether White was killed on account of a
woman or in a fight is unknown.

The SrxoAY Call.
McKinley was nominated on Waterloo
day, but it was an Austerlitz for him.
Now is the time for California to pledge
herself to patriotism, protection and pros
perity.
International bimetallism will not be a
forlorn hope if this country works for it
with vim and vigor.
McKinley and protection â the man and
the measure â suit one another as well as
both suit the country. .
McKinley stands for the industries of
California, and all who would promote
those industries will stand for him.
This time we take the tariff out of poli
tics and make protection the permanently
..established policy of the American people.
If there is any trusting to signs tbe
Democratic Convention at Chicago will
be like that at Sacramento, only more so.
Join in the grand demonstration this
evening of a deathless loyalty to all that is
truly American and a patriotism eternal
as the stars.
Republican prosperity will soon be re
established and all the evils of Demo
cratic days will seem no more than a
hideous phantom and a horrid dream.
When stalwart silver men find that leav
ing the Republican party means associa
tion with Democrats or Populists they
will return to their old friends and be for
given.
Instead of trying to take the tariff out
of politics all good citizens should unite
with the Republicans to establish a pro
* tective system and then proceed to kick
the would-be tinkers out of politics.
The common-sense of the people has de
cided to settle the tariff question in this
campaign and let the financial issue wait
until industry has revived and there are
once more wages and work for all who
need them.

the next administration will provide it. *

The Call of yesterday contained more
political information concerning the Re-*
publican party than can be found else
where in many volumes, and all who are
interested in political history should not
only read it, but preserve it for future
reference.
â¢ Under a Republican administration the
veteran of the war for the Union will be
honored and the widows and orphans of
his dead comrades remembered. The
party of patriotism will never be false to
the men who gave us a Republic' that
patriots can be proud of.
THE MEETINGS TO-NIGHT.
With the rallying cry of "patriotism.
protection and prosperity" the people of
California will meet to-night to ratify the
work of the St, Louis convention and ex
press with enthusiasm their approval of
the nominations of McKinley and Hobart
for President and Vice-President of the
United States. It will be in name a Re
publican rally. It will be in form the
demonstration of a political party. In
spirit and in sentiment, however, it will
be the uprising of the people, the union of
labor and capital, the combination of in
telligent men of all trades, industries, in
terests and enterprises, joining together
with one accord to pledge themselves to
the welfare of America and the welfare of
the home, and to greet with exultant ac
clamations the names of the statesmen
who stand for America against the world.
It is right and fitting that these ratifica
tion meetings throughout the State should
be attended by all business men and by all
workingmen, no matter what their former
party affiliations may have been. The
platform adopted at St. Louis calls for the
protection and promotion of the welfare of
all sections of the Union and of all the in
dustries of its people. Every man who
has felt the suffering and undergone the
losses inflicted upon the people during the
wretched years of Democratic administra
tion should unite in this manifestation of
popular rejoicing over the nomination of a
man who stands for everything opposed to
Clevelandism â in favor of everything that
is summed up in the word Americanism.
The St. Louis platform and the St. Louis
candidates, as said Senator Thurston, are
pledged to "a deathless loyalty to all that
is truly American and a patriotism as
eternal as the stars." No fair-minded
man can read the platform or study the
characters and the records of the candi
dates without feeling conscious of the
truth of that statement. The grand old
party that freed the slave, saved the
Union, established prosperity, protected
Industry, fostered enterprise, reduced the
public debt and lightened the burden of
taxation upon the people, never was more
fitly led and never more firmly and wisely
met the emergencies of the Republic than
at this time. It well deserves the honor of
every loyal citizen and the support of
every man who desires a return of pros
perity to the homes and firesides of the
people.
The ratification meetings to-night should
be great popular demonstrations. The
Republican party will extend a cordial
welcome to its ranks to all Democrats or
Populists who have profited by the dis
astrous experience of the last four years
and now see the necessity of establishing
the protective system firmly upon the
statute-books of the Nation before we un
dertake to deal with any other political
problem whatever. The home comes first
and the home is destroyed when the in
dustries and the wa^es that maintain it
are destroyed. This truth is now known
to the American people and they will be
false to themselves if they are false to it.
Come forth, therefore, men of every in
dustry and of every interest; men who
represent every form of American home
from the mansion to the cottage, come
forth and unite in the meeting which rati
fies the nomination of men whose every
political aspiration is the establishment of
prosperity in the American home. Make
the assembly a true expression of the
popular will. ' Make it a rebuke to De
mocracy and to Populism, a condemna
tion of Cleveland and free trade, an up
holding of American manhood against
pauper labor, an assertion that the Ameri
can Goverume it shall stand for American
industries, and an unmistakable proof
that the American people are united on the
broadly National platform of "patriotism,
protection and prosperity."
A PARTY WITH ONE IDEA.
While the echo of the first shouts of the
people's approval of the work of the St.
Louis convention still lingers upon the
ear the Democracy sends out its carefully
prepared counteracting war cry, but
which does not counteract â "McKinley is
a man witb but one idea; the idea of pro
tection."
In its blind stupidity the Democratic
party has coined a sentence in derision
that will be taken up by the people as the
cry to arms in defense of the very "prin
ciple to establish which there was in
augurated a war which culminated in a
declaration of American independence. It
was the "idea of protection" that kept
aglow the ikes of the spirit of right, of
justice and freedom, and which moved
the people to make July 4, 1776, the be
ginning of a new cycle in the onward and
upward advance of humanity. Washing
ton and his confraternity of human
rights defenders were inspired by but the
"one idea" of "protection" against what
ever was calculated to hold the colonies
subservient to foreign nations. What the
Democracy has invented to belittle the
Republican party's leader will return to it
as the boomerang returns to the thrower.
Just euch a campaign enthusiasm-begetter
was needed, and the Republican party
thanks the Democracy for it.
Yes, Mr. McKinley as candidate of the
Republican party for President stands but
for one idea, whichis protection or Ameri
canism. Since March, 1393, the people
have been growing in the belief that there
is too much foreignism and not enough
Americanism in the conduct of the affairs
of the Nation, and, like McKinley, they
have but one "idea" about the matter, and
that is to reverse the order of things and
have more Americanism and lessâ a good
deal less â foreignism. Mr. McKinley's idea
is that when our people are so deprived of
protection against the invasion of their
enemies that every present and future
prospect of advancement is in the clutches
of discouragement, the time bas come for
every true citizen of the United States to
have but one ideaâ the idea that all dis
couraging prospects for the American to
gather for himself thtj fruit of bis labor
should be turned into positive assurances
that what is his is his, with the further
assurance that he shall be protected in his
effort to add to that which is already his
by right of his own industry.
Not only Mr. McKinley. but every other
good Republican, has but "one ideaâ the
idea of protection." But the definition of
"protection," as Republicans define it. in
cludes everything that is calculated to
protect our people against whatever threat
ens to retard them in their social, political
or commercial advancement. Therefore,
when a Republican talks about "protec
tion," he means by it the adoption of any
policy and the employment of any means
that promise good to the citizen of high
and low degree. Protection does not mean
high custom-bouse charges merely, but it
means a watchful eye upon every avenue
by which harm could reach the machinery
of the individual, and the Nation's pur
pose to go from strength to strength in all
the ways to better conditions for the enjoy
ment of life, liberty and the harvest of
one's own honest effort. '
The McKinley "one idea" stands for
true Americanism in all its ramifications,
and hence it includes everything that the
spirit and letter of the Declaration of In
dependence promises to the citizen of the
United States. It would not mean more
THE SAN FRANCISCO y CA__i_, ATTJRD A ; JUNE 20, 1896.
nor less to say the "Declaration of Inde
pendence" instead of "Protection," nor is
either susceptible of being' twisted into
more than "one idea" of purpose. Pro
tection, as the Republican party under
stands the definition of the word to be,
means â first, to eive all the encourage
ment possible to every American citizen
to better his condition of living, and to do
that in the most effective way a reciprocity
of interests is established to the end that
each member of the family of American
sovereigns shall secure his just proportion
of the general "wealth increases of the
country; and second, to protect his prop
erty acquisitions against the attacks of
outsiders, who would not only deprive
him of what he has already accumulated,
but deny him the right of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. The Democracy
is right. Mr. McKinley and the Repub
lican party have but "one idea â the idea
of protection" to everything that true
Americanism stands for.
LET CAPITAL GO TO WORK.
The election of Mr. McKinley is suffi
ciently assured to warrant capital in going
out into all the fields of employment.
There are hundreds of millions of dollars
that have earned no income for three
years; but there have been many good
reasons for capital to hesitate to venture
into the activities of the business world
since the control of the Government passed
to the hands of the Democracy.
There has been more or less uncertainty
all the time, besides nearly all capital that
was caught in industrial and agricultural
enterprises when the tariff act of 1890 was
repealed has fared badly. But now that
it is only a question of a few months when
an administration friendly to the indus
tries and markets of the country will direct
the affairs of the Nation, together with
the further fact that Cleveland is power
less to inflict any further damage to busi
ness enterprises, there should be no hesi
tation on the part of capital.
It is safe enough to go into the sheep
raising industry, agricultural employment
or any one of the various merchandise
manufacturing enterprises. It is true that
capital would not meet with much en
couragement or secure very satisfactory
results for a while, but it must be remem
bered that it will take a little time to
clear the highways of the debris that
the present administration has strewn
along them. We certainly shall estab
lish reciprocal relations with the
Latin American states and with other
countries, too, no doubt, and capital
would run no risk in making preparations
for that event. 'fin-plate factories will
multiply as soon as they are protected
against the Welsh intruders, but there is
no reason why capital should wait until
the actual repeal of the Wilson-Gorman
act is effected, for it will be wiped out by
the time any new establishments could be
made ready to supply the tin-plate de
mand.
A change in the policy of the Govern
ment in the interest of home industries
and home labor is as certain as could be,
and capital should anticipate coming
opportunities for profitable and safe em
ployment by taking time by the forelock,
so to speak. Right here in San Francisco
capital should be looking about to build
shipyards, for the building of a merchant
marine is sure to follow close on the heels
of Mr. McKinley's inauguration.
Investment in iron works from furnace
to mills to turn out finished products
would prove remunerative, as would
woolen and other fabric factories. In
short, there is not a line of industry that
is not now safe for capital to enter. If
there was any uncertainty as to the out
come of the present political contest there
would be reason for capital to hold back,
but there is no risk at all on that score,
unless the majority of the people of the
United States should go daft before the
ides of November.
HIGH ART.
The picture of William McKinley in yes
terday's Call is the summit of newspaper
portraiture. As a work of high art it has
never been equaled on the Pacific Coast,
and never b3en excelled anywhere; be
sides, as a likeness of the original, the pic
ture is faultless.
A member of Thb Call's art department
was dispatched to Canton, Mr. McKinley's
home, for the express purpose of obtaining
an exact' likeness of the next President,
and Mr. McKinley kindly gave a Bitting.
When tne portrait was finished, the family
and friends of Mr. McKinley pronounced
it a perfect likeness, and Mr. McKinley
indorsed their opinion by affixing his own
signature to the drawing, for it was a pen
and ink portrait from life.
The difference between a portrait
sketched from life, as this one was, and
one taken by the camera* is marked, as may
be seen by comparison. It will be seen
that The Call's portrait of Mr. McKinley
leaves the lines and facial expression as
they are naturally, thus depicting in ac
curate delineation his character, as ex
pressed in his face, to the life. The Call's
readers would do well to preserve this
most accurate likeness of the next Presi
dent.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
The California bathing girl Is the one
that really gets wet when she dons her
pretty bathing suit. In many parts of
Europe and in the Eastern States it is
fashionable to parade tbe beach in full cos
tumeor absence of it â never wetting
more than the soles of the feet, or possibly
the ankles. The California bathing girl's
costume is none the less chic and modish,
yet it is made to withstand the effects of
extreme moisture. Aside from her prone
ness to get wet, the California bathing girl
has many other distinctive qualities and
graces, some of which have been set forth
io verse by The Call's poet and beauti
fully illustrated by one of The Call's
artists. "The California Bathing Girl," as
treated in The Sunday Call, will be en
joyed as a unique and striking feature of
these latter days of journalism. And be
sides being beautiful and shapely and
fashionably attired, she is still modest.
She and her costumes are given a page in
to-morrow's issue.
There are many other pages, remember.
And every one of these additional pages
contains its own particular bright and at
tractive feature or features, many of which
are decidedly novel, and all of which are
new, entertaining and interesting to all
kinds of readers.
Never before in the history of our coun
try did the welfare of the whole people
depend so much upon a single party as at
this juncture. He who, deserts the Re
publican party now is false to the welfare
of every interest, industry and home in
the Republic.
General Maceo doesn't care so much for
American recognition as for more men
and more arms. In other words, if we
will let the filibustering ships go free ha is
willing for us to look the other way.
The Republican party has an everlasting
right to govern the country because it is
everlastingly right on every issue that con
fronts the country.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
REJOICING POPULISTS.
Re-publican Loyalty to Goto Will Help
Strengthen the Tofulists.
To the Editor of the San â  Francisco Callâ Sir:
It is no assumption to say that the stand taken
by the National Republican Convention in St.
Louis in favor of preserving the existing gold
standard and in opposing the free coinage of
silver except by international agreement with
the leading nations of the world will greatly
strengthen the Populists and help build up
the new party, for the Populists, by a per
sistent fight against obloquy, misrepresenta
tion and the formidable bulwark of ignorance
encountered in well-organized and disciplined
parties containing a large majority of the
voters, are gradually emerging from such
seemingly hopeless obscurity into the open
i day, and their principles, as they "state them,
! are beginning to be better understood. ! :'r- ..
It is true, and must be admitted, that thero
are intelligent and fair-minded men who are
still under the baneful influence of early mis-
apprehension of the principles enunciated by
the Populists, and they honestly believe that
Populists "stand for Government ownership of
every public means of conveyance and trans
portation." involving "the Immediate purchase
of all public highways of travel and shipping
by the Government, which would oblige the
creation of a new public debt of over $11,000,
- to pay for tne railways alone," while
In fact their platform simply "demands" that
"the Government should own and operate the
railroads in the interest of the people," and
their financial system provides for the pur
chase of railroads without the creation of a
debt, of any amount, and at actual value of
the property, and not the inflated value on
which the people now pay big interest and
dividends, in which case the railroads are
worth all that is to be paid for them, and will
soon pay for themselves and ever after be the
| source of revenue to the Government.
it is likewise true that honest men are still
misled, and really believe that Populists favor
"the wiping out of all banking institutions
and the unlimited issue of paper money by
the Government," when in fact their platform
on .these two points distinctly says: "We de-
mand a National currencyâ sound and
flexibleâ hsued by the General Government
only, a full legal tender for all debts, public
and private"; and "We demand that the cir
culating medium be speedily increased to not
less than $50 per capita," including of course
the gold and silver now in circulation as a
part of the $50 per capita/a less amount than
was In circulation at the close of the war.when
Secretary Windom in his report of the Treas
ury Department stated that "the people were
almost entirely out of debt" and that the busi-
ness of the country was on a cash basis, almost
exclusively and not as now almost exclusively
on ''confidence" in a very shaky financial sys
tem.
Similar misapprehensions no doubt prevail
to some extent with reference to other planks
in the Populist platform, but will soon all be
corrected and large numbers oi people, no
longer blinded by prejudice or ignorance, or
misled by false statements or deterred by ob-
loquy, will find much to their surprise that
they do not need to become Populists, for the
simple reason that they are already Populists
but did not know it. Present conditions
throughout the country stimulate a good deal
of independent thinking and serious investi
gation, producing as a natural result the inde-
pendent voter, who becomes deaf to appeals to
stay with the party another four years and try
to secure reform within the party. These in
dependent voters will not only be numerous
this year, but they will be extremely inclined
to vote for a change as the most effective way
to bring "the party" to a clear understanding
of what the country needs in 1800, not in 1900.
Senator Teller will have a following which
may become more numerous than McKinley
Bound-money Republicans can at present be-
lieve possible. It is certainly a fair statement
which was made in St. Louis two days since by
one of the ablest living Republicans, John J.
Ingalis. that "the Republican party is in a
transition period"; that "the issues on which
it came Into power have gone into history";
and that "these issues have passed from plat-
forms into precedent and are written in
statutes and constitutional amendments." In
a word, new Issues are before the country in
which the plain people feel that they have a
vital interest. li the vote on the adoption of
the platform to-day at St. Louisâ Bl2}^ for it
aud 11 0>Â£ against itâ may ba taken as a fair
indication of the free silver minority in
the Republican party, that is, about one silver
man to eight gold men, the possible loss of one
vote out of nine in several of the doubtful
States will be apt to have a cooling effect upon
the ardor of many a McKinley man. . It needs
no array of figures to uisclo.e the stubborn
fact that there is very likely to be i a shortage
of the votes necessary to elect Major Mc-
Kinley.
In conclusion, I venture to say that there is
far more genuine and heartfelt satisfaction
over the adoption of the Republican platform
among the Populists than among the Republi
cans. To the one it is a certain promise of a
large Increase in numbers and to the other a
loss of numbers which can possibly be made
good by the defection of gold Democrats and
still leave the electoral college a knotty prob
lem. No one need be surprised if some im
portant political developments are made
within a very short period.; "

BURNING COAL , CARGOES.
A Remedy Tiiat Is Believed Will Insure the
Safety of Colliers. .
To tlie Editor of the San Francisco Callâ
I read to-day of another hot coal cargo in a
ship. I will suggest a remedy that is simple
and is just as good for loose grain stored in
bins as for coal. The coal vessels ; could carry
an air motor of some kind, and attached to
that a low-pressure airpump. Even a rotary
would do, as the pressure would not amount
to anything, the air to be distributed by per-
forated pipes with holes downward, to prevent
their stopping up on the bottom of the coal.
Every day air would be forced in, displacing
the foul air, which could be let out try a vent
on top of the coal, thus destroying the fire
damp. When this is done spontaneous com
| bustion will be a thing of the past in coal
j ships. The cost oi the little machinery would
amount to little. Fred Fisher,

SALUTE THE FLAG.
An Incident That Augurs Well for the
Patriotism of the Rising Generation.
. To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: I
was riding on a streetcar the other day and on
the opposite seat was a young mother, with a
curly-headed tot of lour or five. Presently
a funeral passed, a military escort at the head
bearing the American flag. The little fellow
spied the flag and, jumping from his seat,
pulled off his cap and with bare head and
flashing eyes turned to his mother, crying,
"Salute the flag, mother I Salute the nag!"
And there he stood, with bared head, until the
flag had passed out of sight. Let us have
more such mothers and our children will be
better Americans. F. A.W.

A small number of property owners whodm
agine they see .in the coming of the Valley
Road an opportunity to sell their property to
the right of way committee at a much higher
price than they could hope to get from any
one else are likely to be disappointed, if the
result of condemnation suits iv the counties
north of Fresno can be taken as an indication
of public sentiment in regard to the policy of
obstructing for profit. Two cases of this kind
were concluded in Merced yesterday in which
the property-owners demanded a total of $17,
-600 tor the.land; required by the -railroad.
They ere awarded $1827 50. The policy of
the Fresno committee has been to pay all that
the property is actually worth, required
by the owner," and - it Is not probable that a
jury of citizens will be found to do more than
that. To the contrary, those who are willing
to accept a fair offer or submit to arbitration
are likely to fare better than those who insist
upon litigation and the expenses which ac
crue under that method. - - vi -
A MISS' SHIRT WAIST.
The waist shown here Is one of the most styl
ish shapes. The yoke back is cut deep enough
at the top to extend well over the shoulder,
torming a shallow yoke in front, to which the
body is gathered.
Batiste with cuffs and collar of white linen
makes a very jaunty waist.
The new fabrics for shirt waists show some
startling combinations of color, and very
striking designs of flowers conventionalized.
These are often made up with a plain color
which harmonizes for the cuffs and collar.
Very elaborately embroidered batiste in nat
ural colors is used, and the result is very rich.
The cuffs and collar are usually of plain
batiste to match, or of white.

made In Foraker's speech nominating McKin

should be read several times over, especially
by the youth of California who have their

away for future reference. The Call has ren

Justice of the Peace Kerrigan had occa
sion yesterday to call in a deputy sheriff
to prevent his court being turned into a

trol over his temper.
J. J. Coffey, an attorney, appeared for
his daughter, to whom he had assigned a
claim for a fee.
After having asked the same question
over a dozen times and being admonished
by the court that he must cease he became
noisy and fell into a. wrangle with the at
torney on the other side. The court's pa
tience finally becoming exhausted he said:
"Mr. Coffey, sit down; yon are making
too much noise. Sit down."
"I won't sit down, and 1 will stand as
lone as I please," vociferated Coffey, as he
glared at the Judge.
A whispered word to an attorney soon
brought Deputy Sheriff Dick O'Connor,
who is as big as the Siamese giant and
much broader. Coffey cast one sidelong
glance at the stalwart "dep." and then
subsided for the rest 6f the afternoon, not
even venturing to talk above an ordinary
tone of voice.

spring of '50 the old boundary lines of
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF THE BEAR (REPUBLICAN) CLUB, 1898
Yerba Buena remain an indelible â¢
memory.
To him the wonderful progress of .pay- j
ing with cobbles the few streets that then ;
formed the principal portion of this City !
was sufficient to impress him with the j
march of progress made by himself and
those who thought as be did.
The old signal-yard displayed on Tele
graph Hill which announced the arrival of
a seagoing and incoming ship was all
sufficient. This with a marked increase
in the number of goats and chickens seen
browsing on the sun-dried rocks of the
southeastern brow of ' this observatory
convinced him that there was a great
future in store for the City of the West.
With all of those things he paid no
further attention nor did he bestow a
thought upon any section west of Powell
street.
The "old comer," with his convivial as-
sociations and with the hooked end of his
imported hickory thrown carelessly over
his left forearm, the better to enable him
to use bis right hand in keeping flies off
the free-lunch table, was content to enter-
tain his associates with long-winded sto
ne b of the days of his youth, spent on the
plantation where negroes were chattels
and where it was looked upon as an act of
deep degradation for a white man to labor
at anything more severe than flogging a
disobedient slave who failed to do the task
set out for him by his master.
While thus remunerating and entertain-
ing those about him with tales of the
blessings to be had in the sunny South
where Democracy flourished and where it
is a misdemeanor to be a Republican .San
Francisco was growing not in the direc
tion of Telegraph Hill or North Beach,
but westward, out toward the great ocean:
and with this growth there were streets
being made and hills pulled down to fill
up the hollows on which houses had been
built, and in those houses men and women
moved. And as it follows in all respecta
ble locations the building of houses and
their occupancy meant an increase in the
population which in time necessitates the '
building of school houses and the educa- j
tion of the children.
Now this is just what took place in San i
Francisco after the spring of *50 and dur
l ing the period in which our esteemed Dem
| ocratic * friend was dreaming of what a
grand Democratic State California would
I be when sufficient Southern people settled i
I on its soil.
In tbe meantime, however, the indomit- \
i able Yankee was climbing the Rocky j
| Mountains with teams, aud right behind
him was corning the puffing and snorting |
iron horse drawing not one wagon but
hundreds of wagons", each wagon carrying
its load of New Englanders bound for San
Francisco. These finally arrived, but, un-
like their neighbors from the South with
the hooked hickory, they settled in the
Western Addition, built their homes and
sent their children to the public schools.
At those schools the youth were in-
structed that labor was honorable and i
idleness "produced misery and crime.
These being part of the Republican doc-
trine the young men as they grew up to
manhood carried the lessons taught them
in their youth into practice as soon as op-
portunities pre en ted themselves.
Of such young stock are the members of i
the "Bear Club." These young San Fran-
cisco boys .not caring to follow in the foot
steps of their fathers, in so far as remain
ing politically indolent from election time
to the recurring occasion, organized a Re-
publican Club in the Western Addition
and one that should be continuous, in
which none but respectable, well-conducted
gentlemen would be admitted to member
ship. They believed that politics couid

and should be made clean and acceptable
to all decent people.
With this object in view E. W. Williams,
a Western Addition boy barely of age,
conceived the idea of associating with him-
self a sufficient number of respectable
boys who would form a political club quite
different Irom - the political clubs which
had been in existence in other portions of
the City where the principal qualifications
for membership were the quantity of bad
liquor that each member could consume
and the number of lights he could take
part in on a given night when Republican
clubs had to be stuffed and captured in the
interest of the dear old party.
No such qualifications were required
from the applicants who sought admission
to the Bear Club.
The young men of the Western Addi
tion coincided in the views of Mr. Wil
liams, and when -a sufficient number had
been got together in 1885 the originator
had the club formed, and located its head-
quarters at the corner of Fillmore and
Post streets, where it has since remained.
While Ed Williams was the originator
and the all of the Bear Club, yet with his
usual mo testy he has never been its presi
dent. He always with that magnanimity
which he possesses encouraged some young
friend of his to the front, contenting him
self with occupying the responsible posi
tion of chairman of the executive commit-
tee, from which the success of the club has
emanated, and to wh;ch the high standing
of its members and its influence as a Re-
publican organization are dne.
The first officers of the Bear Club were:
President, E. J. Casey; secretary, Charles
A. Baldermau; treasurer, Samuel Val-
leau: executive committee E. W. Wil
liams, Franklin Bull, George Allen, Frank
Grimes and R. O'Connor.
The opening night given -by the club
was attended by some of the best-known
socie'.y ladies in the Western Addition.
These for the first time in their lives en-
tered the door of a political gathering, and
spent a most enjoyable night with their
young friends.
\ Thus it was that, the members of the
j Bear Club established for themselves a rep
utation for respectability that made them
favorites all over the City, and which
I brought to their secretary applications for
j membership from some of the leading local
1 Republicans, all of whom considered it an
honor to be enrolled on the books.
There were no geographical lines laid
j down for members. Any Republican of
| good moral 'standing in the City could pre
sent his application, and if he went
I through the ordeal of an investigation and
escaped without being hit with a blackball
'he was admitted. Y-Y * ; - -
There is no other club in San Francisco
i out of which so many of its members were
| rewarded with public office as this.
Among some of the names thus honored
j are found Mayor A. A. Sanderson, Con
gressman E. 1". Loud, District Attorney,
State Senator and Insurance Commis
| sioner J. N. E. Wilson, County Clerks
j General W. A. Davies and W. J. Rudd'ck,
City Recorders E. B. Reed and Alexander
Russell, Supervisors Samuel Valleau, S.
j S. Morton, William Wilkinson and J. B.
| Curtis, with State Senator Dan Everett,
Meanwhile the brains and originator of
j the club and the man through whom all
i those have received political favors,
contented himself with a clerkship until
the present time, when he was rewarded
with the office of chief clerk of the Jus
tices' Court.
But this is not his only reward from his
young associates, for no man is held in
higher esteem by those who know him
than is the genial and gentlemanly Ed
! Williams of the Bear Club. Polite and
j obliging, with a kind word for all, yet a
leader of men and an organizer of no mean
ability, he and his club will be heard from
before William McKinley takes his seat in
the President's chair.
As it is with Ed, so it is with those
! who assist him in the management of the
j club. No young man can make more
friends in a given period and retain them
for a lifetime than George 8. McComb, the
secretary of the club. His modesty has
Kept him indoors, for he has not yet pre
sented himself to the admiring public.
But those rare gifts are inherited, not be-
stowed.
McComb came by his genial manner
through legitimate possession, for his
j now departed father, General John Mc
! Comb, possessed those qualities in a
1 marked degree as compared with the
majority of men. ;* --.
The executive officers of the club at
present are: President, T. J. Collins; vice
president, H. C. Firebaugh; secretary,
George S. McComb; treasurer, Oscar
i Tolle; executive committeeâ E. W. Wil-
I liams, W. W. Wade, R. W. Roberts, John
Williams and Daniel T. Cole.
The club will turn out to-night and join
| in the ratification of William McKinley
; for President. The drill corps will make
its appearance for the first time ins 1896,
and will no doubt give a good account of
itself between now and next November.

NETTIE CRAVEN
RECORDS DEEDS.
Claims Over a Million
Dollars Worth of
Property.
JAMES G. FAIR'S GIFT.
The Name of the Deceased Was
Signed With a Lead-
" ' Pencil.
ATTORNEYS TAKE PRECAUTIONS
The Southwest Corner of Pine and
Sanspme One of the Pieces
of Real Estate. "
George R. Williams and Stephen Rob
erts, as attorneys for Mrs. Nettie Craven,
had two deeds recorded yesterday to prop
erty worth over a million dollars, which
Mrs. Craven claims James Q. Fair gave
her before his death.
The intimation was made some time ago
that Mrs. Craven had deeds to valuable
real estate, but the nature of the property
was not made known.
The deeds were the ordinary printed
blanks, the insertions describing the prop
erty and the signatures being made in
lead-pencil.
Both purported to have been made out
on September 8, 1894, and were acknowl
edged by Notary Public J. J. Cooney on
September 27, 1894.
Both witnessed that through love and
affection and a desire to provide for her
future maintenance, James G. Fair had
made a gift to Mrs. Craven of the property
described. The first deed was for the lot
on tbe southwest corner of Pine and San
some streets, 227 feet on Pine and 131:6
feet on Sansome. This property is worth
over $400,000. The other deed was for a
half block of land bounded by Eleventh,
Potter and Mission streets, 550 feet on Mis
sion street and 275 feet on Potter street,
Mr. Fair paid $550,000 for this tract in
1891.
Attorneys Williams and Roberts exer
cised the greatest care over the documents
while in the Recorder's office, sitting by
Deputy Joseph Cooney while he copied
the deed and taking possession of them
immediately on their being finished. They
gave as a reason for this action that they
feared that the pencil insertions in the
blank might become effaced if the deeds
were left in the office and handled by the
officials.
The searchers of records, who desired to
get the main features of the deeds, were
not permitted to touch them at all, their
only inspection of the documents being
while they were held in the hands of the
attorneys.
The Recorder was no less careful regard
ing his portion of the transaction, more pre
cautions being taken than with any docu
ments ever recorded in his office.
Not only were the verbiage and inser
tions of the deeds copied, but also the num
bers ofthe practitioners' blanks, and even
the printer's figures at the bottom of the
blanks.
When the work was all done the book in
which the deeds were recorded was
locked up in the safe to be sure that no
accident happens to it.
George R. Williams, the attorney, who
personally had the deeds recorded, was seen

More plain talk
â but from eminent New York newspa-
pers this time :
"It is not saying too much to assert that the use of spu-
rious teas has tended to aggravate diseases of the nerves
and digestive organs, has often caused disorders almost un-
known to medical science before the days of drug teas, and
has helped to. swell the mortality list." â New York Herald.
"Some tea is colored with Prussian Blue, to make it
green; green tea is usually the worst, while black tea is
blackened with plumbago. Nice stuff, that, to take into the
stomach â Brooklyn (N. V.) Eagle.
You see what we mean ; we might say
this ourselves more directly, more con-
cisely, because we are speaking direct to
you, men and women of San Francis-
co. But we are " interested"; we have
tea to sell ; and our tea is pure ; and what
is more natural than that we point to and
exaggerate the danger of colored tea for
our own purposes ?
No ; there is nothing to be scared about.
The Japan tea you are drinking will not
kill you. It is only bad for you. That
is all we say.

San Francisco , m A Schilling & Company
at his home, 1466 Tenth avenue, East Oak
land, last night, but was extremely ] re
luctant to say anything about the matter.
He finally, however, gave the history of
the documents so far as he was acquainted
with it. .z~ ' * ' ,'\
About three weeks after Senator Fair's
death, and immediately after the Good
fellow will had been stolen, he was ap
proached by Stephen Roberts, an old
time friend of his, who asked him some
hypothetical questions relating to the
pencil will and pencil deeds, as has since
developed. As the result of this consulta
tion, Mrs. Craven was introduced to Mr.
Williams. Mr. Roberts' acquaintance with
Mrs. Craven resulted from the fact that
Mr. Roberts and Mrs. Craven were both
school teachers.
Mrs. Craven at this interview informed
Mr. Williams of the existence of both the
will and the deeds, and virtually re
quested him to act as her counselor in the
matter.
At that time the will had been sent to
New York by Mrs. Craven, and he advised
her to produce it before the Probate Court
at the earliest possible day, and it was
this advice of Mr. Williams that caused
the sensational introduction of the pencil
testament into the Fair will controversy.
In response to questions Mr. Williams
made toe following statement:
"I went out to the City Hall in San
Francisco yesterday with Mr. Roberts to
have the deeds recorded. I exercised
great caution in this, as the documents
were in pencil and I was fearful of some of
the writing being rubbed and made illegi
ble or possibly mutilated. I was appre
hensive also that they might be stolen, as
was one of the Fair wills. For these rea
sons I did not care to let the originals go
out of my hands."
When asked in whose custody the docu
ments are at the present time Mr. Wil
liams declined to state, but inferentially
it was learned that they were in his pos
session.
"Were there any other witnesses to the
signing of the deeds besides Mrs. Craven,
Notary Cooney and Senator Fair?'l was
asked.
"Yes, sir."
"What are their names?"
"That I must not say."
"You know who they are?"
"Oh, yes."
"Did Senator Fair sign the deed in the
presence of Notary Cooney?"
"That I cannot say, but it would not
have been necessary to make the documents
legal. Any one might have written Fair's
name to the documents, but his acknowl
edgment of it before a notary as his
name would have made it his legal signa
ture. But lam sure it is Mr. Fair's sig
nature. At the 'time the deeds were exe
cuted Senator Fair was living in the Lick
House, and Notary Cooney had his office
in that building, with O'Farr.ll & Co., I
believe."
"Did Mr. Coor.ey state to you whether or
not Mr. Fair signed the deeds in his pres
ence?"
. "I did not ask him that question."
"As the signatures are in pencil, the
same as the body of the documents, is it
not fair to presume that they were al
ready signed when presented to Notary
Cooney for acknowledgment? Had they
been signed before the notary, would not
ink have been used?"
"Yes; I think, for the reason mentioned,
that the deeds were signed before being
presented to the notary."
"Are there any other deeds yet to be re
corded?"
"1 can't say."
"Why were the deeds not put on record
earlier, instead of waiting all this while?"
"For the same reason that she hesitated
about filing the pencil will; she did
not want the notoriety that she felt would
result. The property was perfectly safe.
No one could sell or steal it or make away
with it."
"What was the reason of her putting it
on record at this particular time?"
"Nothing special. But the documents
are in pencil and might become injured or
destroyed, j So the deeds were put on rec
ord to provide against any such mishap."
"When did you first actually see the
deed?". ,'â â¢..
. "That 1 must not answer." v . :
"Has Mr. Cooney. the notary, any spe- ]
cial recollection of the transaction of ac- j
knowledging the signature to the deeds?" j
"No; but he, like all notaries, keeps a I
record of all acknowledgments, and he has |
one of this particular transaction, of
course. That record briefly describes the
property, gives the name of the grantor
and grantee, also the date when the sig
natures were acknowledged. There is no
question in my mind about the matter.
Everything is as straight as a shingle."
Mr. Williams stated further that the
property was valued in the neighborhood
of $1,250,000.
Early in the evening a call was made at
310 Guerrero street, at the residence of
Mrs. Janet R. Craven, the grantee men
tioned in the deed, but Mrs. Craven was
not at home, and the ingenuous maid
servant neither knew where her mistress
was nor. when she would return, but she
did not think Mrs. Craven was trying to
dodge reporters.
TELLER'S SILVER BOLT.
The Republicans of California
Will Stay the
Party.
Republicans of San Francisco generally
regret that Senator Teller of Colorado has
decided to leave the party on the silver is
sue. They entertain the view that he
would be able to accomplish more good for
the cause of bimetallism in the Republican
party than outside of the organization. It
cannot be ascertained that many Republi
cans in California will follow his example.
It is said that a petition was in circulation
yesterday with the purpose of getting
the signatures of voters to sustain Teller's
bolt, but that only a few signatures were
secured.
C. F. Curry, County Clerk, was asked
last evening if he had heard of any de
sertions from the Republican ranks in
consequence of Teller's course, and he re
plied that he had not. The platform of
the Republican convention demanding
protection for all industries will bring to
the party many more votes than will be
lost by the withdrawal of Teller. Protec
tion is really the leading question. The
Democrats have got to work up an issue
of some kind to keep the party together,
and the declaration for free silver may be
j made at the Chicago convention. This
J platform will promise, the farmers every-
I thing. Republicans believe in silver, but
j other issues take precedence at this time.
General Robert A. Friedrich will ear
| nestly support the Republican National
I ticket and the platform of the party, but
he is of the opinion that energetic work
must be done to carry California. "I do
not know," he said, "how strong the senti-
I ment is in California for the free coinage
of silver, but I know that many Republi
cans favor bimetallism. In my judgment
Teller made a mistake in withdrawing
from the party. McKinley and Hobart
will be elected, but we must prepare at the
start for a hard battle in California."
Henry N. Gray did not believe that any
' considerable number of California Repub-
I licans would leave the party in conse
quence of the attitude of Senator Teller.
Joseph Simonson fancies that Teller's
defection will cut but a little figure in
party calculations. He said : "I have not
heard of any Republicans in San Francisco
who are going to leave the party on ac-
count of the silver question. This talk of
I the Democrats nominating Teller is idle.
. The Democrets .will not come to Teller.
'â  He must go to tnem. I fancy that the sil-
I ver Senators have been looking to their
I own interests in the move they have
taken. Perhaps they imagine that the
, chance of prolonging their service the

Major C. W. Kyle said he had not heard
of any desertions from the Republican

He remarked: "Silver is an industry, the
same as wheat, and the way to protect it
is to sustain the principles of protection
for which the Republican party declares.
The Colorado Senator should have re-
mained in the party to secure protection
for other industries. It was selfish to leave
j because silver was not protected in the
manner that he desired."
Grove P. Avers remarked that he had

The "History of the Calendar" was a
novel idea. It explained the meaning of
the names of the months, the signs of the
zodiac and the seasons. The story was in
prose with poetical and musical illustra
tions. The walls of the classrooms were
literally covered with meritorious draw
ings by the pupils in pencil, pen and ink,
charcoal and colors. A characteristic of
the Broadway Grammar, which is for girls
exclusively, is its cosmopolitan character.
Its 800 pupils include representatives of
all the Latin races, and they are especially
notable for their patriotism.

Important Decision of the Court
of Appeals in Two Land
Grant Cases.
Several Million Acres Indirectly In-
Possibility of Fur-
ther Litigation.
Judges McKenna, Gilbert and Hawley
of the Court of Appeals handed down an
important decision yesterday in the case
of the Southern Pacific Railway Company
against Nathaniel Bray and David 11.
Brown of Ban Bernardino County, involv
ing the title to certain lands held by the
defendants: Judge Hawley delivered the
opinion of the court.
In the litigation just ended only 300
acres are involved, but the principle of
law established practically settles the title
to several million acres of land hitherto
claimed by the Southern Pacific. The
suits were "originally brought by the rail
road on the ground that the defendants
held the the title in trust for the company.
The real question for decision was
whether the lands patented to Brown and
Bray passed by or were excluded from the
grant made by Congress to the Southern
Pacific Company under the provisions of
the "act to incorporate the Texas Pacific
Railroad Compauy, and to aid in the "con
struction of its road and for other pur
poses," which act was approved March 3,
1871.
It seems that Brown and Bray settled
on the disputed lands in 1878. Nine years
prior to that time Deputy United States
Surveyor Reynolds surveyed what is
known as the Jurupa grant in San Bernar
dino County, but it was never accepted by
the Government. Some years later one
Minto surveyed the same property, the
results attained by him differing mater
ially from the returns made by Reynolds.
When the action against Brown and
Bray was brought, it was argued that the
western boundary of the Jurupa Rancho
should be the rock on which the title to
the disputed property should rest. If the
the Reynolds survey was correct, then the
title of the railroad company could not be
disputed.
An action was accordingly instituted in
the United States Circuit Court, the South
ern Pacific contending that no one ever
claimed that the boundary of the Jurupa
Rancbo extended further west than toe
west line surveyed by Reynolds. The de
fense held that Minto's survey was offi
cial, and -consequently their title to the
land was from the Government and not
the railroad. The lower court held the
same opinion, whereupon the case was
carried to the Court of Appeals. That
tribunal now sustains the Circuit Court
and orders a judgment to be entered in
favor of Brown and Bray, the railroad to
pay all costs.

BREAKDOWN ON THE OAKLAND
She Drifted Around in the Bay Help-

Hour.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
is practically making a new vessel out of
the steamer Mexico. New masts are be-
' ing put in and her. upper works renewed.
Her machine; is being overhauled, and all
i the upholstering is being replaced. The
passenger accommodation is being in-
creased, and when everything is completed
the Mexico will be one of the best vessels
in the company's fleet.
The Pacific .Mail Company's City of Para
sailed for Panama and way ports in charge
I of Captain Crowell yesterday. When pass-
in over the bar an overturned fishing
boat, with twomen clingingto the bottom,
was sighted. Captain .McCollocb, the
pilot, drew Captain Crowell's attention to
the fact, and the steamer was at once
stopped. A boat was lowered, and the
men taken off. It was only just in time,
however, as before the rescue party got
back to the City of Para the fishing-smack
! sank.
At first Captain Crowell Intended put
| ting the men aboard the pilot-boat, but
| when the tug Sea Queen hove in sight he
j signaled her and Captain Ike Smith at
| once agreed to bring the men to the City.
j When their boat went down the fisher-
men lost their all. When they capsized
| they had a good catch of rockcod aboard
| for yesterday's market, so that they not
j only lost their boat and all its equipment
but the result of two days' hard fishing.
The ferry-boat Oakland, while on the 7
a. M. trip to San Francisco yesterday,
broke her rudder chain and drifted around
for half an hour. After considerable
maneuvering she was got around and the
other rudder was used. There was con-
siderable excitement aboard, but it was
soon allayed when the extent of the dam
i age was made known. The Oakland was
crowded, as the business people who live â 
I on the other side of the bay usually come j
over on that trip. I
There was a big crowd of school children
j and their relatives and friends on Clay
j street wharf yesterday. They all expected
to go on a pleasure trip to Angel Island
i on the steamer McDowell, but the vessel
j was otherwise engaged, so no 10:30 a.m.
' run was made. The men who came from
j Fort Canby on the State of California had
I to be taken to their destination and it took
tbe steamer all day transporting them
from the Oregon dock to Alcatraz and
Ansel Island.
The Pioneer Yacht Club held its second
annual regatta last Thursday. The fleet
was composed of the Volunteer, Nellie,
Ethel S, Pride, San Vincent. Amy, Emma,
Elia, Dread Naught, Maluna, Encinai and
Angelina. After a cruise around the bay
the party landed at Angel Island and
spent a most enjoyable time. There were
boatraces for men and women and run-
ning-races on the sand. The half-mile
rowing-race for ladies was won by Miss
Lottie Welch, the half-mile race for men
by M. King and the race for skippers by
the captain of the Ethel S.
The running race lor ladies was won by
Mrs. Welch, and that for men by Dave
| Dean. The runuins high jump was won
by Barney Jones, and the tug-01-war, club
men vs. non-members, was won by the
former. The target practice was a source
of great amusement. Each contestant
was blindfolded and given a brace and bit.
STliey had to keep turning the brace and at
the same time walk toward the target.
Miss May Drushell got within twenty feet
of the center and won the first prize. The
others wandered in all directions and had
i to be brought back to the starting-point.
j Everybody voted the affair a most enjoy- i
I able one, and gave three hearty cheers for
Commodore Kendall when it was all over.
The raisine of tne Blairmore is still a
problem that is worrying Captains Burns
and Whitelaw. Pumping and hauling
was kept up until 10 o'clock last night,
and then the tired men were given a rest.
Yesterday another new pump was pur-
chased and to-day was occupied in placing
it in position. It all goes well another at-
tempt will be made to-morrow, and if it
fails everybody will be - almost ready :to
give up in despair. If the sunken vessel's
stern can be raised all will go well. If not,
not all the tugs in the bay can move her.
Tee steamer Newport, which arrived
from Panama last Thursday, will have to
be overhauled before she can go out on
another trip. Her machinery broke down
on the run from New York, and it
took two weeks at Panama to net it in
anything like working order again. Per
manent repairs will be made at the Union
Iron Works and the vessel will then be as
good as new.
The Alameda is full of cargo for Aus
tralian ports, and yesterday ; sne stopped
receiving. There is not an ounce of Ha

Domestic Shortcomings of

Judge Seawell Allowed Mrs. Gerdes
Judge Seawell Allowed Mrs. Gerdes
Alimony Pending Hearing of
â¢ Her Suit.
Judge Seawell yesterday ordered Henry
G. Gerdes to pay his wife, Alvisa A. Gerdes,
$50 a month alimony, pending the trial of
a suit for divorce .which Mrs. Gerdes
entered on June 10, Gerdes is also com
manded to pay his wife $20 for expenses
incurred In bringing the suit, $50 alimony
and $75 on account of her counsel fees, on
or before July 1. On the day the trial of
the case begins, he must also pay her an
additional $125 for counsel fees.
Mrs. Gerdes' complaint tells a woeful
story of domestic infelicity. Her maiden
name was Alvisa A. Patterson. On Decem
ber 23, 1892, she was married to Henry G.
Gerdes, the druggist, whose place of
business is cat the corner of Pine and
Kearny streets. For the past three years,
the complaint alleges, the husband has
been guilty of willful neglect, failure to
provide the common necessities of life,
and of cruelty. YY -...:-;
Mrs. Gerties claims' that her husband has
a violent temper which he makes noeffort
to control when at home, and that be takes
fiendish delight in harassing her and hu
miliating her in the presence of others.
She says that during the past three years
the druggist has refused her permission to
leave their home at any time, and lias also
refused to allow her to have any visitors,
saying that he would "throw any visitor
out of the house."
The complaint further recites how Mr.
Gerdes has on several occasions left his
home without informing his wife as to
where he was going and absented himself
several days much to her distress. On
one occasion he absented himself while
sbe lay helpless on a sick bed.
When Mrs. Gerdes saw fit to go out in
defiance of her husband's commands, she
says he locked her out of the house. On
April 1, 1896, Mr. Gerdes brought his
niece, Clara Gerdes, to live at his home,
despite the plaintiff's protests, and there
she has resided ever since.
The last act of the whole play of cross
purposes was witnessed on May 23, last,
when, the wife alleges, the compounder
of prescriptions called her vile names and
attempted to strike her. Being afraid of
physical injury, she left him and applied
for a divorce.
The case will come up for trial after
Judge Seawell's vacation. Gerdes has
$1500 in bank, property on Castro street
and the income from the drugstore is $250
a month. Y-.Y^'Y. Y!Y -*"".

PARALYSIS AS A RESULT OF
NERVOUSNESS.
From the News, Indianapolis, Ind.
McCordsville Is a quiet little village sixteen
miles northeast of Indianapolis. Here lives,
in a modest cottage with her parents, a patient
sufferer whose afflictions, borne without a
murmur, have been known to all the country-
side. Her name is Anna Nagley, and this is
the story as she tells it:
â¢'I was a healthy, happy child. Four years
; ago last May I became partially paralyzed and
I by January, 1892, I was utterly helpless and
! lv bed. I lay until April.. I had the best
! medical attendance that could be procured,
I but nothing could be done for me. One day I
chanced to see an article in a paper, a state-
ment from a man who had been cured by Wil
liams' Pink Pills for Pale People. His symp-
toms and sufferings as he described them
corresponded to my own. I resolved to try the
pills. They were not on sale in McCordsville
and I sent to Mr. Quigley, a druggist at Green
field, y-w- - '
"My limbs from my hips down were cold
and numb. Though wrapped in hot blankets
and vigorously rubbed Kith liniments, the cir
culation of the blood could not be kept up.
The dose is one pill for each meal, to be in-
creased to three. I be.an with three. I said
to myself, 'The doctors have no hope for me,
so here goes three at a clip.' My improvement
was as rapid as it was wonderful. * By the
fourtn or fifth day my limbs were moist and
warm and I felt that my blood was stirring. I
took several boxes of tne pills. In the mean
time I got up and began to walk about, and
this was the first walking alone and without
a crutch that I had done for two years. From
95 pounds my weight rose to 117 ponnds, and
I could walk as well as anyone. I washed and
ironed and did the housework. The doctors
i were all puzzled. They neither understood
I my sickness nor my recovery.
"My experience has made Williams' Pink
j Pills for Pale People known to others, and
i many have used them and been cured. Mr.
Haskell, a neighbor here, partially paralyzed,
has been made well and able to work*. So
has Mr. Kimberiin and several others. W.
Uardman, an attorney at the neighboring
town of Pendleton, was partially paralyzed
following an attack of grip. He was scarcely
able to walk, even with crutches. The Pink
Pills have cured h.m. My father, James W.
Nagley, 05 years old, was so nervous he
could not hold a cup in his hand. The Pink
Pills have restored him. Mrs. Ellas Marsh of
Greenfield, who | suffered from rheumatism for
ten years and was almost helpless, has been
cured by Williams' Pink Pills lor Pale People.
I know of others, but I considered my case
the most remarkable of any of them, as it was
paralysis caused by the giving way of the
nervous system."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in a con-
densed form, all the elements necessary to
give new life aud richness Ito the blood and
restore shattered nerves. They are an unfail-
ing specifio for â *___ 'diseases as locomotor
ataxia, partial paralysis, St. Vitus' dance,
sciatica, neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous head
ache, the after effect of la grippe, palpitation

THE CORKERS' OUTING.
Athletic Sports and a Good Time on
, Bakers Beach.
The second outing of the "Corkers" was
held last Sunday at Bakers Beach, and it
was a most successful affair.
The weather was pleasant, and the
members availed themselves of the op-
portunity of having a good day's hilarity.
The lunch was prepared by the royal
caterer of the Corkers, Stephen Poggie,
who was ably assisted by the stewards,
Jim Lewis, Jackson Warren and Joe Mat-
tesun. After lunch, of which all the
members did justice, the following games
took place:
The first on the programme was a
wrestling match between Tom Finnerty,
the heavy-weight of the River Express,
and Pat Grace. Grace won first fall, and
in the excitement incident to the second
fall the contestants rolled over on the
beach until a bic roller from the ocean j
took all the. ardor out of them. Jack
Bendevidas challenged the winner to meet
him at the next outing. The next, event
was throwing the hammer, between Al |
Delehanty and Sam Eldridge, which was !
won by Delehanty, who beat Eldridge by
two feet. The next was a running race,
100 yards, between Winfield, Garrett, j
Wiikie, Michaels, O'Connell and Petsch, j
which was won by Wiikie in llj^ seconds.
The jury ping match was contested by ,
Billy Dwyer, Lewis, Poggie, Vebellen and j
Petsch, and was won by Dwyer by 2 feet. i
The tug-of-war between the married and
single men was well contested and was
won by the married men. . The baseball j
game, was won by the single men, and !
tneir success was due to the battery work
of Bendevidas and Lob. Score 13 to 6.
Following the games the Corkers' favo-
rites, Thomas and Brower, sang several I
duets, followed by the Corkers' Quartet, J
Love, Ford, Loh and Bendevidas, which
was well received, as also the Kindergar-
ten Quartet, Eddie Herbert, Boyle, Johnnie i
O'Connell and Jimmie Garrett. The !
Corkers started for home well pleased with I
their second outing.
The following members were present:
Henry Stelling, Stephen Poggie, Thomas
Garrett, _Â». P. Grace, Sam Eldridge, A.
Wiikie, Thomas O'Connell, James Lewis,
Thomas Finnerty, William Love, A. Brow-
er, M. Thomas, James Vebellen, William |

Ford, J. Bendevidas, E. Winfield, Jackson
Warren, P. Michaels, Henry Petsch, Al I
Delehantv, Jack Loh, James Garrett, E. K.
Boyle, Herb Boyle, J. O'Connell. The
next outing will be held the first Sunday
in August.

Mass-Meeting Tues-

REVIEW OF THE CONVENTION.
In Memory of the One Hundred and
Forty-Nine Delegates Who
Were Faithful.
Were Faithful.
Next Friday- evening, June 26, the]
woman suffragists of this City and vicin- I
ity will hold a mass-meeting in Metro- I
politan Temple. Itwili be the ratification I
of the suffrage planks In the Republican, !
Populist and Prohibition platforms. Only i
the Democratic platform will Deleft out of j
the ratifying and the uncavalierly de
meanor of the Jeffersonian brotherhood at j
Sacramento this "week will doubtlessly be j
eloquently reviewed.
"However," said Miss Hay at the I
suffrage headquarters yesterday afternoon, j
"there is something Democratic we will j
ratify and that is the 149 delegates in the ;
convention that voted for us and our ;
modest plank. So coolly were we and our
40,000 petitioners set aside by the Demo
cratic party of the State of California that
we had hard work to get our cause from '
being tabled for good. Finally we got aâ â 
rollcall and out of 569 votes we got 149.
"So we intend to ratify the effort of
those 149 ballots, because, small as that
number is, it represents the thousands of
Democratic names among the 40,000 on our j
petition.
"One thin? we gained from our rather '
barren trio to Sacramento last week was 1
the real expression of California Democ- i
racy. There is no mistaking its tones. It
is against woman suffrage first, last and
all the time, and we need never expect any
favor from that party. But why should
emancipationists expect anything from
the Democratic party? Did it ever turn
an open ear to the cry of anything 1
or anybody for the boon of po
litical liberty? I need not allude
to the negro and the little affair
of thirty years ago. When we offered a
resolution to the convention, we took for
our text the good Jeffersonian doctrine
that 'governments derive their just powers
from the consent of the governed,' but ;
that never touched them. Possibly they :
had forgotten that such a man as Thomas j
Jefferson ever lived. However, our plank i
went overboard, and timber devoted to
'protection of labor,' 'pure food,' 'personal
and religious liberty,' 'good roads,' 'free
speech' and an indorsement of President
Cleveland with a string to it was inserted
in the Democratic platform.
"Here is a paragraph of what Miss An
thony said before the convention last
Wednesday:
Gentlemen of the Democratic Party of Cali- ;
fornia: If you can afford to do this the noble
women of this State can afford to let you do it. :
Yon are unjust and cruel to the women. Every
other party in the State has received thisdele-
gation of your citizens and has received it not
merely courteously, not merely gallantly, hut \
received it justly and have put resolutions in
their platform declaring in favor of this Jeffer
sonian doctrine of the right of consent, and ;
have thus declared they will do their part to- j
ward the rank and tile of the voters of their re- j
spective parties about the merits of this ques- i
Son of the extension of the ballot to women.
"And the gentlemen of that party tabled j
"And the gentlemen of that party tabled
the question with a bored expression on |
their laces."
Mrs. Ida __ Harper, chairman of the |
press committee, in an interview made the
following statement:
The representatives of woman suffrage had
The representatives of woman suffrage had
but one figâ t to make before the Democratic
Convention, viz. : to secure an expression on j
this question from that body. We made our
fight and won it. At the Republican, Populist
anil Prohibition conventions we expected to â 
secure planks indorsing the eleventh amend- j
ment, and we were successful. The most san
guine enthusiast had no such expectation in
regard to the Democratic Convention. Our i
object in going to the latter was twofold:
First, to prove the thoroughly non-partisan
character of the movement by treating all po- 'â 
litical conventions with* the same attention
and respect; second, to Insist that the Demo- i
cratic party should put itself on record in re- j
gard to this momentous question just as the I
ther conventions had done.
Our delegation to Sacramento was as strong
and representative cs it was possible to make I
it. There were twelve ladies. Three of the-,-,
Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw and Miss Hay, were 1
from the National Organization of Woman I
rage; nine of them were residents of Cali- '
fornia; five were unmarried; seven were mar- |
ried; six were mothers; four were grand- j
mothers. With the thermometer at 105 deg. |
we spared ourselves no fatigue, no exertion, \
no embarrassment. At the beginning we en-
countered a dead wall of opposition. The dele- I
gates did not throng our headquarters as at i
the other three conventions. They avoided us !
when we tried to see them. On every hand we j
were assured that while we would be politely I
treated, given seats in the convention and per-
. mitted to appear before the platform commit- '
tee, there would be .no woman suffrage plank
and do action by the convention.
Well, it was something to be assured that we '
would be treated as decently as other people 1
who attended the convention, and not discrim
inated against because we represented 20,000 1
California women who had sent their petitions '
by us, asking for the right of suffrage. A great
many men and women who did not represent ;
anything were given seats in the convention,
and women did not even have to possess a good ,
moral character in order to appear before the i
platform committee. However, we did not
propose to quibble over small matters, so we
opened up our headquarters, got out our suf- |
frage literature and badges, put on our best
clothes, provided ourselves with fans and ice- !
water and awaited event*?. A few of the lead
ing Democrats stood by us nobly, but unfortu
nately they had fights of their own on hand
and could not enter actively into ours.
finally a few delegates drifted into our
headquarters to express their support ; others
followed, and before the convention closed
quite* respectable number had called upon 1
us; iii several instances entire delegations
came end. put on the little badge. Everybody j
assured us, however, that there would be no j
plank, and very few thought it would be pos-
â¢ Bible to bring the matter before the convention I
â¢to as to secure a vote. Not one of us iost an I
â 'opportunity of talking with the delegates ,
â¢""'whenever and wherever we could find them. ;
While the general sentiment was uncompro- ,
-mi singly opposed, some Â«_ the men had given 1
fhenucstion no thought, and after some argu- j
ment agreed that we bad a just cause and I
â¢ there was no valid reason why the Democrats |
"."should refuse to indorse it. Large numbers
'said that personally they had no feeling ;
against woman suffrage, but thought it would
be bad policy for the party to favor it. The
hole line of argument was that if the Demo
cratic party refused to indorse it then the en-
tire element iv the State which was opposed to
it would vote the Democratic ticket. It did
not seem to occur 10 them that every man
could stick to his own party and simply vote
"No" on the -iacndmenl.
The appointment of a platform committee of
thirty-five was unfavorable to us, as it is very-
hard to convince so large a number. A poll of
these names showed only lour or five favorable
to woman suffrage. We were allowed twenty j
minutes to present our case, not twenty mm- [
utes apiece, as some of the papers stated. The
anti-suffragists were given the same amount of
time. There were lour of them, including <>--
good Putnam of San Francisco. They at-
tempted to include James Phelan, but he in- I
dignantly repudiated them. We presented our !
petitions, bearing 40.000 names, and Miss An-
thony, Miss .-haw, Mrs. Cooper and other-.
made their eloauent pleas. We then with
drew, and the resolution was tabled almost be- 1
fore we were out of the room, without a word 1
of discussion or consideration.
The next step was to secure a minority re
port in order to bring it before the conven
tion, and we had the assurance of C. Wesley
Reed of San Francisco that tnis should be
done. He kept his word, although he also had
other lights on hand, and although he en*
dangered them by standing for woman suf
frage. This minority report, although prop
erly drawn and signed by four members of the
platform committee, including the chairman
of this committee, was "smothered" by the
secretary of the convention and its chairman,
Mr. Gould. Every other minority report was
read and acted upon by the convention. That
alone on woman suffrage was held back. In
vain Mr. Reed protested, the chairman ignored
him and called for a vote on the platform as a
whole. It was adopted with a roar, and our
tight was lost!
It was near midnight. We had sat two long
days in tbe convention, had slept but little,
were worn out and vor â .*, very wrath At this
juncture John Irish addressed the conven
tion, stating that a very distinguished lady
was present, etc., etc., and would they hear
Miss Susan B. Anthony? Thinking it was too
late far her to do any haim, she was received
with loud applause, it is impossible to say
what Mr. Irish and the convention expected,
but they got a rebuke for allowing such action
on the part of their chairman and for treating
the women of the State in this unjust and un
democratic manner that caused a hush to
fall upon the whole body. It was a dramatic
and impressive scene, one not to be forgotten.
At its conclusion there were loud cries for
Anna Shaw. The little fighter was at the boil
ing point, but she stepped upon the platform
with a smile, and, with that sarcasm of which
she is complete mistress, she supplemented
Miss Anthony's remarks. As she stepped down,
half the convention were on their feet de
manding the minority report.
The chairman stated that it was too late for
that, but a resolution might be offered. The
original resolution was at once presented, and
then there was an attempt to take a viva-voce
vote, but our friends demanded a roll call. It
resulted in 119 ayes and 420 noes. Mr. Gould's
own county voted almost solidly in favor.
Alameda County, led by W. W. Foote, gave 32
noes and '! ayes, yet this county sent in the
largest petition lor woman suffrage of any in
the State. The vote in detail will b3 consid
ered hereafter. Suffice it to say we secured
what we went afterâ a vote of the convention.
The ni'-ral and political effect of this vote is
discussed by Miss Anthony in further on.
When we went out of the convention hall
into the moonlight we found James Phelan
awaiting us with several carriages, into which
we were placed with great kindness and cour
tesy by that gentleman and sent to our hotel.
1 wish it were possible to give the names of all
who stood by us so bravely in a position dim
cult for us and for tnem. We know those
names by heart, and they will be remembered.
Miss Susan B. Anthony had the follow-
Miss Susan B. Anthony had the follow
ing to say:
For the Democratic convention to give 149
votes for a woman suffrage resolution was
really a greater victory for our cause than was
the almost unanimous vote of the Republican
Convention of a month ago. The Republicans
lave from time to time, when there was no
practical issue at stake, passed favorable reso
lutions; but never before, in any State where
an amendment was pending, did any Repub
lican convention put its imprimatur upon it
until that of California, at Sacramento, on
May 5, 1S!Â»0. So that, Father Solomon to the"
contrary, â¢'something new under the sun" did
happen then, It was a great and grand step
forward that presaeed triumph fo"r us at the
polls on November 3. It was what I most ear- i
nestly hoped, but hardly dared to expect.
The Democratic party, on the other hand,
had never, either in State or National conven
tion, had a favorable resolution presented for
discussion, much less adopted, while in several
of the States, when amendments were rend
ing, resolutions most bitterly denouncing
woman suffrage have been adopted. Hence, â 
when the California Democracy at Sacramento j
allowed the presentation, discussion aud roll
call of a full-fledged woman suffrage amend
ment resolution as follows, "Believing in the
Jeffersoninndoctrine, that 'Governments derive
their just powers from the consent of the gov
erned,' the Democratic party of California, in
convention assembled, hereby expresses its
approval of amendment No. 11, conferring the
right of suffrage upon the women of the State,"
and 149 delegates shouted '-aye," lt was a
vastly longer stride forward for the Democracy
than "was the full vote of the Republicans.
Tne parties in California now stand three
with solid planks and one with a quarter of a
plank. This means that the editors and
orators of the dominant Republican party and
of the People's and Prohibition parties will, If
they write or talk against woman suffrage,
oppose one of the principles of their own
parties; and those of the other great party
will, if they oppose the amendment, go
counter to the vote, the wish and the will of
one-fourth of the members of the Democratic
Convention. . â  YY i".-.
Hence, yon see, I am rejoiced over the
action of each and all of the State conventions
ot California, since each did splendidly con
sidering its antecedents ; and lam profoundly
grateful for the promise that these platform
utterances give tor the best of educational
help for our amendment by the bringing be
fore the rank and file of the voters a full and
free discussion of the merits of the question.
It is the first campaign during the last thirty
years in which the great Republican party has
thus pledged Itself to help us; the first time
any great daily paper like The ("all has ever
given itself to help us and the very first time
that the Democratic party has ever given us
even a fourth of a promise not to oppose us.
How can Ido other than feel sure that with
all these powers on our side victory will
perch on our suffrage banners in November
next?
The State Suffrage Association next
Tuesday will remove from 1630 Folsom
street to its new headquarters in the great
Emporium building on Market street.
The rooms selected are numbers 563, 564
and 565 on the fifth floor. One of the
apartments will be fitted as a reception
room and the others as offices for the
president and working officers.
A stenographer and typewriter will be
added to the staff of the headquarters and
the rooms kept open day and evening.
Mrs. Ida Harper, chairman of the press
committee, will be in constant attendance
to supply information. It is the intention
of all the members of the association to
remain at work until after the election in
the interest of the cause of woman's
suffrage. '

THE NEW WOMAN
AND THE FORCEPS.
Young Lady Graduates Talk
v About the Pulling of
Teeth.
READY FOR PRACTICE.
The Nightmare of the Dentist's
Chair Takes on a New
Charm.
THE FIRST CLASS OF LADIES.
Of the Fifty-Two in the Graduating
Class of the College of Dentistry
Class of the College of Dentistry
Five Are Ladies.
Five Are Ladies.
There is both a new charm and a new
terror in civilization.
She is the woman with the forceps.
Everybody has heard of the lady and the
tiger and of the lamb and the lion, but'
woman with one hand on the corrugated*
brow of a patient and the other upholding
a dropping tooth is another innovation pe
culiar to the new woman. This is the
woman in dentistry.
In the class of 1396 of the College of
Dentistry of the University of California,
which was graduated last Thursday, were
five young ladies. They were the same
"sweet-girl graduate" that ornament the
platform of female seminaries and high
schools in commencement weeKS.
If there was any difference it wa*? that
the fair dentists looked a little brave, for
there is a peculiar experience acquired in
an active dental clinic with suffering tooth
aches to operate on that can be observed
nowhere else. But while the rule seems to
be that none go to the dentist's chair as
long as they can go anywhere else, per
haps with woman behind it her gentle
touch may add a new and unexpected so
lace to the man with the forceps in his
jaw. Perhaps, too, her smile may dissi
pate the toothache as "sunlight drinketh
dew." Anyhow, who does not wish it so
could eat cactus without a whimper, and
has no need for the doctor of dental sur
gery.
The young lady graduates are Miss
Anna Sawyer of 733 Bush street. Miss Gae
McDonald of 107 Fair Oaks street, Mrs.
Mary L. Baird of 1426 a California street,
Mr?. Matilda Ayers of 4 Hyde si reet and
Mrs. Amy Maxted Gilbert. With one ex
ception, perhaps, all are going to begin
practice in San Francisco. Several will
take a recreation of a month or two after
their three years' study, but all will have
shingles out in the breeze "before the frost
is on the pumpkin." Miss Sawyer left the
City last evening for an outing, Miss Ayers
will go next Monday, and Mrs. Gilbert
will go away in a few days to be absent a
month.
Miss Ayers and Miss McDonald are
thinking about opening an office together.
Their signs may go up at Miss McDonald's
home, where their chairs will be set up in
one of the parlors, and divided by screens.
One of the young lady graduates went to
school with her husband, and they both
graduated and acquired titles at the same
time last Thursday night. The degrees
are "D.D.S." Her sign is already on the
front window of a neat California-street
fiat, and above it is that of her husband.
A chair has been set up, the myriads of
little instruments are in sight, and as Dr.
Mary L. Baird sat in the office and parlor
yesterday afternoon, she said :
"I am ready for business." She said it,
too, with a demure professional air.
"Will you treat men or women, or
both?"
"I will treat gentlemen if they want !
me," she said. That is what all the
young lady dentists do, too. So there is
an entirely new refuge for the young man j
in pain. Surely the toothache should not j
now drive a young man to drink.
The young ladies think there is as much
opportunity for practical success for
women in dentistry, as for men. They â¢
point to a lady in San Francisco who has j
been practicing dentistry thirty-eight j
years, and has built up a good practice, as
a shining example of woman's possibility |
in dental surgery.
This is the first class graduated by the
college in which there were any number
of ladies. The only other lady graduate
of the college is Miss Armstrong, of the
class of 1891. who is said not to have
entered practice yet. The faculty speaks
highly of the capabilities of the young
ladies, as well as the 'forty-seven young
men of the class.
Miss Ayers said yesterday afternoon
that, the nervousness at first naturally
attendant upon operations in the clinic
soon wore away, and that now she would
not hesitate any more to pull a tooth with
a pair of forceps than to eat a strawberry.
In describing how to pull a tooth, Mrs. j
Gilbert said: "It is not the strength that
does it so much as knowing how to do it."

tests, as such an impression might work us
some injury among our friends.
1 am in full svinpathy with the sentiments
expressed by William Greer Harrison as re
ported this morning, and I am sure that fully
two*thlros of our members would also indorse
Mr. Harrison's opinions that the club should
stick to its original plan, the principles of
wbich are sociability, goodfellowship and the
encouragement of healthy amateur athletics-
It is true that the club is arranging an ath
letic tournament in the Mechanics' Pavilion
that is intended to help swell its building fund,
and a couple of days ago, at the, request of the
committee having the matter in hand, I tele
graphed Frank Savin, asking if he would meet
Choynski In a ten-round contest; but the idea
that the club, has decided to go in for a series
of professional tournaments is a mistake. I
received an answer from Slavin yesterday to
the effect that he was willing to meet Chovnski,
but as Slavin has since been knocked out in
short order by Maher, the San Francisco public
might not be so anxious to see him or Mr.
Chovnski to meet him.
Although Mr. William Greer Harrison ac
cepted the presidency of tho St. George's Club
on the understanding that he should not be
called upon for active service, we shall expect
occasionally to nave the benefit of his advice
and valuable experience, which nt all times
will receive tne attention it so well deserves.
Yours very sincerely,
Edward Oliver, Secretary.

Their Money.
The Local Federal Force Has Hith
erto Been a Profitable Field
for Note-Shavers.
Local note-shavers and money-brokers
are much disturbed over an order just is
sued by the Postmaster-General "concern
ing the loaning of money to carriers, postal
clerks and other Government employes.
There are several hundred Federal em
ployes in San Francisco, there being no
less than 207 letter-carriers. The money
sharks have had an easy thing of it, cash
ing thirty, sixty and ninety-day notes and
accepting an order on the Postmaster, au
thorizing the amount to be withheld from
the clerk's or carrier's salary.
The following order, however, is intended
to dampen the ardor of those who have
for so many years successfully carried on
their cent per cent game:
My attention having been called to the fact
that certain money-lending concerns are ad.
vertising to loan money to railway postal
clerks, letter-carriers and other Government
employes, taking a note therefor and an order
upon the paying postmaster authorizing the
amount to be withheld from the clerk's salary
in the event of bis failure to pay the note at
maturity, I desire to state on behalf of the
Postofflce Department that such agreements
are disapproved; that paying postmasters are
forbidden to recognize the orders guarantee
ing the payment of such notes, and that indi
viduals or companies loaning money to em
ployes of this department under any such
guarantee will receive no aid or assistance in
the collection of their account**.
William L. Wilson, Postmaster-General.
The local authorities are pleased over
the stand taken by the department at
Washington. It relieves them of a great
deal of trouble and incidentally saves the
employes hundreds of dollars yearly. *

The firstdamage suit against the Maiket-
The firstdamage suit against the Maiket
street Railway Company because of Mr.
Viniug's mixed transfer system was filed
yesterday. :
W. L. Smith is the plaintiff, and in the
complaint he recites how he boarded a
Powell-street car, paid his fare, and at
Powell and Market streets received a
transfer to Market street. . He boarded a
McAllister-street presented his check,
was refused transportation thereon and
ejected from the car.
15y reason ofthe Market-street Railway's
refusal to carry the plaintiff to his in
tended destination, and by reason of the
violence and indignities heaped upon him,
Mr. Smith claims to have been damaged
in the sum of $5000, for which he asks
judgment.
He also prays that the court have re
turned to him the 5 cents he was com
pelled to pay on the car' which carried
him home after being put off the first one.
PAPINTA'S LILY DANCE.
Five Hundred Yards of; Silk to Make
One Flower.
Papinta presented a new dance last
night at the Orpheum, which aroused con
siderable interest. For the first time she
appeared without her mirrors, and took
the whole stage with' her gyrations and
her draper ies.
In her new dance she required all the
room which an unencumbered stage could
afford. "When the curtain went up all
that was visible was a moving mass of soft
white silK. Gradually Papinta was dis
cerned beneath it as she began her gyra
tions. : The silk spread itself out into
petals and ended by assuming the form of
a perfect lily of huge dimensions. Five
hundred yards of silk are required for this
dance, which is known as the lily dance. â¢

Wants.
THE WORK DESIGNATED
No Margin for Contracts That
May Be Awarded by
Supervisors.
ORDER REGULATING DIVES.
Cadences of Music Should Cease at
the Midnight
Hour.
The revised statement of Thomas R.
Ashworth, Superintendent of Streets, was
received by the Grand Jury at the regular
session yesterday afternoon.
At the special session last Wednesday
evening, when Mr. Ashworth conferred
with the jury to consider his estimate of
$1,500,000 to maintain the department for
the next fiscal year, he explained that all
improvements deemed desirable were in
cluded in his estimate placed before the
Board of Supervisors. Moreover, he pre
sented the fact that a large percentage of
the sum of $526,000 allowed for the present
fiscal year had been expended under con
tracts awarded directly by the Super
visors.
The Superintendent was therefye asked
to submit a statement of the actual neces
sities of his department for the year be
ginning July 1 next an estimate not to
include the cost of any contracts for work
that may be awarded by the Board of
Supervisors and payable out of the Street
Department fund. In accordance there
with the following was submitted:
For county roads $10,000
Street sweeping 120,000
Cleaning and repairing sewers and mate-
teiial same 70,000
Bepaving and repairing accepted streets. 200,000
Improvement in front of City property... 16,000
Improvement and maintenance of public
parks 30,000
Improvement In front of public parks.,.. 30.000
Total *. $475,000
The foregoing represents a reduction of
more than a million dollars when com
pared with the figures forwarded to the
Board of Supervisors.
Next week the Grand Jury will take up
the School Department figures. The Board
of Education asks for $1,500,000. indicating
that the sum of ?350,000 is required for
new schpolhouses. The purpose of the in
vestigation is to secure the co-operation of
the School Directors in an effort to obtain
a reasonable tax levy.
A short time ago the Grand Jury com
mittee on dives and social evils â com
mittee of which E. E. Cheever is chair
man and Jacob Martenstei'n and J. J.
O'Farrell are membersâ submitted a re
port in favor of closing the dives at mid
night. The District Attorney was asked
to draw an amendment to order No. 1537,
to the end that the recommendation of the
committee may be carried out. Accord
ingly the following amendment was pre
pared and transmitted to the Board of
Supervisors, with the request that it be
adopted:
Sec. 32. It shall be unlawful for any per
son to keep open, maintain, carry on or con

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The sporting feature which is creating
the greatest interest just now is the com
ing boxing bout between Tom Sharkey
and Jim Corbett. The big fellows will
meet on Wednesday evening in the Pavil
ion, and if Sharkey, who sprang up mush
room like to fame, stands before the cham
pion for four rounds the friends of Corbett
will be the most surprised men on earth.
Road-racing continues to be a popular
amusement among wheelmen, but the
same cannot be said of track-racing,
which is rapidly losing support because
of the loafing system now employed by
fast riders, who spurt only when the gong
so unds for the final effort. Then a grand
stand play results, which invariably ends
in a so-called exciting finish.
The anglers are now enjoying good fish
ing in coast streams.
A grand coursing meeting under the
auspices of the Interstate Club will be
held to-day at Ingleside Park.
The oarsmen are training hard for the
Stockton regatta, which will be held on
the Fourth of July.

The race will start at 10 a. m. from High

Charley Bates out of condition.
The Imperials' race, which will start at
11:1? from San Leandro, has forty-five

There have been several surprises in
cycling lately, but none have created as
much talk as the announcement just made
public that San. Plummer, captain,
and Horace P. Howard, secretary, of the
Bay City Wheelmen, have resigned their
respective offices, though not from the I
club itself. Rumor had it that there was !
something back of the matter, but this is j
unlikely or they would not have remained \
with the club. Plummer is out of
town a rood deal and Howard is not in \
very good health, and both felt they could '
not give their offices the requisite amount
of attention. George P. Caldwell, first
lieutenant, has been promoted to the cap
taincy, and George E. Dixon elected to (
fill his old position as lieutenant. Harry ;
Larkin was elected secretary. Captain j
Caldwell has called a run for to-morrow to I
San Mateo by way of Uncle Tom's Cabin
and the Spring Valley lakes, leaving the i
clubhouse at 8:30 A. K. This is a very |
interesting ride, besides not being too
tiresome, and it should be well attended.
On Sunday, June 28, the club will hold. a
ten-mile road race, open only to club
members.
The Olympic Cyclers and Bay City
Wheelmen will' have a joint run by
steamer to Petaluma, Friday evening,
July 3, to attend the meet of the League |
of American Wheelmen there.
By a recent, amendment to the constitu- i
tion of the Camera Club Cyclists, here
after only active and associate members of
the California Camera Club are eligible to
membership. Captain Argenti and Mr.
Duboce are arranging a run of the club for
Sunday week to Walnut Creek by way of |
Martinez, with a bullshead |,breakfast as
the star attraction..
Some of the members of the Sunset
Cycling Club made the trip from Alvarado
to Madrone Springs, in the Mount Ham
ilton hills, fifteen miles south of the Lick
Observatory, last Saturday morning, re
turning Monday afternoon. Those in the
party were: Mr. and Mrs. H. P. . Dyer,
Mr. anil Mrs. J. W. Atkinson, Miss Nina
Dyer, E. W. Burr. Miss Dyer, Miss Riley
and H. Dyer.
Henry Walker, a well-known dealer of
Honolulu, is in the City for a few days,
looking for wheels and sundries. Here is
a tip for the trade.
W. C. Klotz, Joseph Quadt, J. M. Sala
zer and W. B. Lewis have been elected to
membership in the Bay City Wheelmen.
Captain Mayo has called a run of the
California Cycling Club to Haywards to
morrow, taking the 8:30 a. m. boat, to wit
ness the club's road race. The racing men
will take the 8 a. m. boat and train to San
Leandro. The club's annual banquet next
Saturday evening is interesting the mem
bers in a prospective way just now.

The attention of rulers is directed to general
rule Cof the racing board. In default of with
drawal of entry one week before the date of
meeting, or of a satisfactory and conclusive
explanation of failure to compete in any of
the events for which entered, riders become
liable to suspension from the track for â¢ period
at the pleasure of the racing board. Entrants
in handicap events may be excused from start
ing by the referee. Failure to pay entry fees
also renders riders liable to suspension.
R. M. Welch,
Member of the National Racing Board.
The Golden Gate Cycling Club will elect
new officers next Tuesday evening and
will have a try-out over the San Carlos
course Sunday week.
C. Nufred of the Golden Gates is on a
trip awheel to San Luis Obispo, and J.
Cookson is riding to Santa Cruz.
Entries for the San Francisco Road
Club's big race on the 2Sth will close at the
clubhouse Monday evening next. There
will be a large number of starters. To
morrow Captain Pixley will lead the men
on a blind run, leaving the club at 8 a.m.
The wheeling clubs hereabouts seem to
take very little interest in the Baker &
Hamilton trophy race scheduled for San
day, July 12. Few men care to ride twenty
miles under a scorching July sun to try to
win for their club a trophy which was do
nated partly because it would be a good
"ad." for the donors. The Garden City
Cyclers have announced they will not
enter a team, and the Bay City Wheel
men feel the same way.
The associated clubs, which control the
running of the race, while having no con
nection with the League of American
Wheelmen, which organization, by the
way, condemns road racing, has passed a
rule| that no nan can. ride in a team in
this twenty-mile race who rode in class B
on the track when that class existed.
This is absurd on the face of it, for if the
league has "whitewashed" such men and
restored their amateur standing, what
right has the California Associated Cycling
Clubs to say that they are not pure ama
teurs? The rule shuts out the best men
on the coast to-day, lessens the interests
of the big clubs, and the chances are the
B. & H. trophy race will be a very tame
affair, thanks to the Oakland delegates to
the Associated Clubs, who put the motion
through. ; ,-XYYX.
There is some talk of a special moon
light run of the clubs belonging to the as
sociation, to Sutro's Baths some evening
next month, and arrangements are now
being made with that end in view. It
would be a novelty and probably would
prove a very enjoyable tut ing.
The proposed indoor tournament at Sac
ramento, July 23, 24 and 25, will attract a
number of the riders from this part of the
State. The programme as arranged will be
about as follows:
Thursday, 23â One-mile open, amateur; one
half mile" handicap, amateur; one-half mile
open, professional; one-mile handicap, profes
sional.
Friday, 24â One-mile handicap, amateur;
Friday, 24â One-mile handicap, amateur;
one-quarter mile scratch, amateur; two-mile
scratch, professional; one-mile Handicap, pro
fessional.
.Saturday. 25â Two-mile scratch, amateur;
one-mile handicap, amateur; one-mile open,
professional; one-half mile handicap, profes
sional.
The prizes in the professional class will
not be under $50 for firsts and the others
in. proportion.
The" Olympic Club Wheelmen will have a
joint run with the Acme Club Wheelmen
of Oakland to-morrow toTrocadero, near
Ingleside; leaving the Olympic Club at 11
o'clock. The Acmes are thus returning
the visit paid them by the Olympics a few
weeks ago, when they entertained them at
Lake Cha bot.
Bicycle-riders should learn to adjust
their saddles properly. One of the great
est inconveniences, connected with cycle
riding is the difficulty experienced in find
ing a comfortable sitting posture. The
saddle may be too high or it may not be
nigh enough. If the saddle inconven
iences you the only thing to do is to ex
periment with it until it fits, and then do
not change it under any circumstances.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen, Garden
City Cyclers and Santa Rosa Wheelmen
will have a joint club run to San Mateo
Sunday, Jane 28, the Olympics being the
hosts. The Olympics "will run off their
five-mile road race there before lunch, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1896.
afterward the riders will visit the Crystal
Springs dam and other points of interest.
Chairman Gideon, of the L. A. W. rac-
ing board, says Cycling West, has in his
office in Philadelphia, a novelty in the
shape of a $20 draft received from Harry
Terrill, the California professional. ':_: At
one of the opening meets on the coast in
the early spring (Santa Rosa, May 2) Ter
! rill's anger was aroused by a decision of
the referee, Plummer, and he used sprue
uncomplimentary language to him. He
was immediately fined $20 and the money
was forwarded to the racing board when
he paid the^fine. Mr. Gideon is delighted
with the prize and never misses a chance
to exhibit it to his friends and newspaper
men. This is the first money ever received
by the league in this way and Mr. Gideon
proposes to put the amount into the trea
sury out of his own pocket and have the
draft framed and hung in his office.
John S. Johnson is not making the suc
cess of his foreign tour that was expected
of him. It goes to show that record
breaking and winning open races do not
follow the same lines. Smashing records
was easy work for Johnson, but he has
found it impossible to beat the foreign pro
fessionals in actual races.
The success of Ziegler, Terrill and Mc-
Farland on the National circuit Thursday,
when they won ail three professional races
iij an Arkansas town, one apiece, shows
what splendid form the Californians are
now in. McFarland is looked upon by
many as the coming man. When these
three meet Bald, Cooper and Sanger
there wiil be racing worth seeing. '
The Mountain View Cyclers have ar
ranged a bullshead breakfast, to be given
at Mayfield, Sunday, June 28, at noon, to
which some of the prominent City clubs
have been invited. At 1 o'clock they will
hold a series of races on the road, the dis
tances and prizes being as follows:
Five-mile race, scratch, amateurâ prize,
gold filled watch, valne $25; second prize, box
of cigars, value $3. One-third mile race,
scratch, amateur, finalsâFirst prize, shaving
outfit, value $3 50; second prize, sweater,
value i? 3. Halt-mile race, scratch, amateur,
finalsâ First prize, silver napkin ring, value
$3; second prize, set silver-plated knives and
forks, value $2 50.
These races are open to all amateurs and
there is no entrance fee. Entries should
be sent to Phil W.Clark, care Mountain
View Cyclers, Mountain View, Cal., prior
to Tuesday evening, June 23.
Emil Laneuetin of theÃay City Wheel
men is touring in Southern California.
Thomas S. Hall, F. L. Day, A. J. Menr.e
and George P. Caldwell of the same club
are spending a month's vacation at La
Honda. B. D. Bent will depart next
week on a wheeling trip to Los Angeles.
This trip to the south seems to have
attracted quite a number of riders.
Walter Crowell and Oscar Ellinuhouse of
the Baifk of California have but lately
returned from there and E. A. Kolb ofthe
Olymoic Club got back this week. W.
Henshaw Stmson and J. "Wheelman"
I Coffroth of the Olympic Cyclers will make

V. A. Dodd, captain of the Alameda
i Cyclers, has been appointed on the road

ciate Clubs, vice Henry F. Wynne,
resigned.
What has become of the Cycle Baseball
League, about which we have heard so
much and yet so little? Perhaps our friend
Raviin of the Chronicle can tell He ar
ranged the dates and schedule of games,
but most of the dates have passed and
none of the games have yet been played.
The proposed northwestern and coast
racing circuit will probably be about the
j same. It is a case of much ado about
! nothing.
The entries for the league meet races
j at Petaluma on July 4 close next Friday
' evening, and it wiilbe well for riders to
| send their blanks in early and thus aid
j the handicapper. The meet promises to
be a big success and is receiving hearty
support. If the Petaluma wheelmen will

GUN AND DOG.
How Canvasbacks Are Lured by
Dancing Decoysâ Club Shoots. '
The Alameda Sportsman's Club and
Lincoln and Reliance Gun clubs will meet
this afternoon at the Webster-street
grounds. Some good scores will surely
be made at artificial bluerocks. The
Placerville Gun ' Club will hold a blue
rock tournament to-morrow in Placerville.
Some of the crack shots of this City will
take part in the smashing of the clays.
Thomas H. Brown, the well-known St.
Bernard fancier and member of the S
Bernard Club, has received from the East
a magnificent specimen of the Hospice
dog. The new arrival won second prize at
the New York bench show of this year,
and will prove a valuable acquisition to
the St. Bernard interests of this coast.
As all sportsmen who have a predilec
tion for duck-shooting are aware that the
royal canvasback of the far North is a
most cunning bird at times the following
interesting letter from a Portland (Or.)
sportsman will prove assuredly interesting
to many. 'â :â 'â [
The writer says that on calm days a
"jigger" must he used .to insure good
shooting, and he explains what a "jigger"
is in this wise:
One day while -journeying to our hunting
grounds a discussion arose as to ducks and the
various methods of alluring them. From Mr.
Scoggins, who, by the way, is one of the I most
successful eanvasback-shooters of the North
west, I learned of the "jigger." Drawing
from his pocket a bundle of string and rubber
bands, he explained that by their use he fre
quently turned defeat into victory..
"When the water is placid," said he "the
birds will not decoy, for,- seeing so many
decoys sitting motionless, suspicion enters
their heads. Why, I have seen birds make a
dash at decoys, and when they noticed the
entire absence of motion go off with apparent
fright. When the wind- fail* me I wade 'out
among the decoys and fix a strong stick into
the mud and beneath the surface of the water.
To this I attach a couple of these rubber bands
and to these a good, strong string that will
more than reach to the blind. At intervals
along this string I attach about three decoys,
and a gentle pull on the shore end of the line
will cause the counterfeits to** dance merrily.
One can so tie the decoys that when jerked
the**: appear to bj diving and feeding, aud the
waves caused -by their antics keep the entire
stool in geitle motion, ruffling the water for
quite a distance. Should I fuil to have a rub
ber band with me I get a strong but elastic
stick and fasten the string directly to it. This
does nearly ps well as the rubbers, and I some
times like it better."
Several of the market hunters of this
State have used the "jigger" with telling
success in the mashes tnat margin the
Sacramento River.
The sportsmen of the old countries are
thoroughly familiar with the many tricks
which a fox resorts to to avoid annoyance
and trouble. Foxes . are bothered with
fleas as well as other animals, when j
the fleas become two numerous for his com- I
fort he easily rids himself of all or most
in an ingenious manner. With a piece of
moss held between his incisors he walks j
with deliberation into the shallow water !
of a stream or river, His "lodgers" all the j
while hustling up higher so as to keep out j
of the wet when he proceeds further into
the stream. At last only his head is above
water, and it becomes a case of "standing I
room only" with his friends, the enemy. \
Then, standing with his snarp muzzle
pointed downstream, he sits down, gradu
ally immersing his head until only the
bunch of moss is high and dry. . When the
unwelcome tribe has crowded upon the
bunch of moss the fox opens its jaws, and !
tbe infested island floats off . down the i
stream. "";%' .r.-yy'.' â¢'â :',' -;,"*:
COURSING.
Grand Sport Is Promised at Ingle-
side Park To-Day.
The Interstate Coursing Club has issued
very neat invitations for its "ladies' day
meeting," which will be held this after
noon at Ingleside Park. '
Coursing will commence sharp at 1:30
o'clock and the committee in charge is in
hopes that ail lovers of the grand old sport
will be on hand promptly to see the first
brace of dogs enter the slips, as consider
able money is wagered on the inaugural
race of the day. The Mission-sreet elec
tric cars will convey passengers to the
grounds. X*ts\X
According to the drawing' which took
place on Thursday evening last great rac
ing should certainly result, as the fastest
and best-bred dogs in the State are entered
in this particular event.
It is hardly necessary to remark that
Dalton's hares are runners of the old
school. The races of last Sunday proved
beyond question, that the hares of Ingle
side Park are superior as long-distance
runners to any of the Merced stock that
have been imported and raced by grey
hounds within the fenced grounds. Man
ager Dalton attributes his success in tuis
particular to his method of feeding the
spry little short tails. .
Hares, he contends, are like racehorses.
They must be carefully looked after and
fed regularly on food that will harden
them for long and grueling courses. .â 
The Interstate Club meeting of to-day
will certainly be witnessed by a lar>:e gath
ering of ladies and gentlemen. Of course,
owing to the fact that a large number of
sportsmen whose principal outdoor amuse
ment is witnessing sharp and spirited
dashes between the long and shorttail
fliers cannot leave their work to seethe
sport of to-day, it is not expected that the
gathering at Ingleside will be as large as
if the meeting was held on Sunday. How
ever, a grand day's sport is promised all
lovers of the leash who will be in attend
ance. 'XXyXy
The following report appeared recently
in the American Field: y;?Yy y
It will be welcome news to all having the
welfflre of coursing at heart to know that W.
C. Peyton and J. 11. Rosseter have been elected
by the Interstate Coursing Club as its repre
sentatives on the American Coursing Board.
This is cause for congratulation all round.
Furthermore, the president of /the board has
appointed these two gentlemen a committee to
act upon California cases, in which they will
take testimony and report to the board. J.
Herbert Watson has been working for some
time to bring this about, and we heartily con
gratulate him upon its consummation. The
meetings of the Interstate Coursing Club are,
of course, run under the American Coursing
Board's rules, though some minor alterations
may be allowed in order to suit circumstances
out there.
Messrs. Peyton and Rosseter are un
questionably the right men in the right
place, because they have the interest of
the sport at heart and have been always
untiring in their efforts to wash "inclosed"
coursing of a stain it held for years in this
City. :YY â *

THE OARSMEN.
Names and Crews of the Clubs En-
tered for the Stockton Regatta.
Things are rapidly assuming proportions
for the Stockton regatta to be held on July
4 oil the Stockton channel, both among
the local boat clubs and the Stockton
Athletic Association, under whose aus
pices the affair is to be held.
The races will commence promptly at 10
o'clock and the programme of events with
the corrected entries up to date are as fol
lows: .
Senior four-oared barge. South End
Clubâ Henry Bode, bow; Bob McArthur,
forwardwaist and captain; Gus Carson,
afterwaist; Frank Duplissea, stroke, and
George McGrill, cockswain.
Pioneer Rowing â Fred Orr, bow
and captain; Coney Ochs, forwardwaist; j
George Colloky, afterwaist; John Clifford,
stroke, and George Fitzsimmons * cock
swain.
Stockton Athletic Associationâ Carkeek, I
bow; Spencer, forwardwaist; Swift, after-!
waist; Davis, stroKe, and Doc Flynn,
cockswain. | '
In the junior four-oared barge the South
End Club will, in all probability, enter the j
same crew that made such a good showing
against the Stockton giants at the recent j
El Campo regatta. â  ;
The personnel of the crew is as follows: j
Al Fritz, bow and captain; I Mat Breen, |
forwardwaist; James Pallas, afterwaist; |
Ed Scully, stroke and George McGrill, j
cockwain. * .
The Pioneers have two crews in training
for this event, and a try-out race will be
held some evening during the week, and
the winners will go to Stockton.
The crews that will race in trial are as
follows: R. Collopy, stroke; Ed Faulkner,
afterwaist; ; Phil Tint?, forwardwaist ; : W.
St. John, bow and captain, and George
Fitzsimmons, cockswain.
The second crew is made up of: W. Espy,
stroke; J. Klui. der, afterwaist; M. Callan,
forwardwaist; T. Sands, bow and captain,
and 'Doc" Flynn, cockswain. V
The Ariel Club will have no entry in
this event or in the senior event. A crew
had been in training for the junior race,'
but for some reason it has been - dis
banded.' X. .- , . ,
The Alameda Boat Clnb will enter a
crew in the junior event if the Stockton
Athletic Association will tender it the use
of its old racing barge.
As the Aiamedas nave no suitable rac
ing boat of their own they have written
to the Stockton club asking for the -use of
a boat, and as the Stockton: oarsmen are
equipped with a brand new Eastern-built
racing boat, they will doubtless give the
i Alameda crew the use of their old boat on
j the day of the race.
'The make-up of the Alameda crew is as
follows: A. Webb, bow and captain;
Fred Avers, forward waist; J. Hanson,
afterwaist; A. Hancock, stroke, and
I Thomas Guilfeather, cockswain.
| This will be the first four-oared crew
1 that the Alameda Club has entered in a
j regatta for many years. /-> ,'- ':, 'Y
The Olympic 'and Dolphin clubs will
j make no entries in this event, and the
! crew from the Stockton Athletic Associa
tion will be as appended: Henry Backe,
C. Strother, Will Folger and Joe Foley. .; *
In the senior single-scu'l event the fol-
lowing will line up: William McCansland
and Henry Wittkopf of the Ariel Boat
Club, Frank Duplissea of the South End
Club, and Al Brown and Louis Gio-
vanesse of the Stockton Athletic Associa
tion.
Henry Wittkopf is training hard for the
senior event and rows about ten miles
daily, going out mornings and afternoons.
He hasn't sat in a boat since last Fourth
of July, and there are many who think he
will never regain his old-time form; at

Young Frank Duplissea, the South
End's pride and champion stroke oar of
the coast, feels his defeat in the El Campo
regatta very keenly.
In the senior outrigger skiff events at
| the Stockton races will be entered Samuel
J. Pembroke, Dr. Cecil Dennis and Fred
Ayers of the Alameda Club, Bob Ellis and
Jim Wilson of the Ariel Club and Jack
Coughlin of the Dolphins.
The Stocktons, South Ends, Pioneers
and Olympics will make no entries in this
event, as they have no outrigger-skiff.
A junior outrigger skiff race is down on
the programme for the Stockton regatta,
and many are training for it, but no
entries have been made thus far.
A launchrace will also take place, and
in this tne Ariel Boat Club of this City
will undoubtedly make a great showing.
Eugene J. Flanders, the club's secretary
and champion gormandizer, has just con-
structed a launch that will show a speedy
â¢pair of heels to any boat of her size on the
bay, and while she is his individual prop-
erty, the members of the Ariel Club take
as much interest in her as if she belonged
to the club.
A lame crowd of the club members
and vacationed letter-carriers have just
left on the launch for a two weeks' so-
journ up the river. They intend visiting
Stockton, Sacramento and other points.
The boat is undoubtedly one of the fin-
est of her kind on the bay. She is thirty-
five feet long, seven feet beam and three
feet six inches deep.
Its engine was built at Grand Rapids,
Mich., is a twelve-horsepower and only
stands three feet high, is brass finished
throughout and can turn the propeller to
432 revolutions a minute.
The flywheel is twenty inches in diam
j eter and weighs 27o pounds and no turning
I of it by band is -necessary, as is the case
i with the majority of gasoline engines be
| fore they can be started. V *
The engine is placed in the after part of
the boat and the gasoline tank is forward.
This eliminates any ballast being carried
to make the boat set properly in the water,
as is the case with ot:ier launcnes.
The boat was built by the American
Boat-building Company of St. Louis and
was shipped out here in parts.
An attractive cabin tnree feet high and

capable of accommodating twenty-five
persons runs from a few feet forward
nearly aft. It is equipped with a closet
and patent washbasin that are in them
selves novelties never before seen on any
launches here. YYY 'YY: /YYy
The closet is not these force-pump af
j fairs, but is kepi clean by the overflow of
I the engine, and the washbasin can be
; folded up in such a manner that it can be
used for a writing-desk, comb, soap,
! and brush-holder and repository for books,
and periodicals.
All in all she is the most improved
'. launch at present on the bay, and some
i thing the Ariel Club and Mr. Flanders can
be proud of. She is expected to make
from thirteen to fifteen miles an hour,
I burning a gallon of gasoline hourly.
Johnson, the champion senior single
I sculler of British Columbia, has sent a
. challenge to William McCausland, the
i champion ofthe Pacific Coast, to row him
1 a mile and a half straight-way race for a
| trophy. Â»
Johnson is a member of the Birds' Inlet
â  Rowing Club, and the race is to take place
â¢at the Victoria regatta. McCausland's
i expenses will be paid, and if victorious on
the Fourth of Juiy he says he will accept
the challenge.
The following letter is self-explanatory:
June 19, 1896.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Will you please state
in your boating column of to-morrow's paper
that the Stockton regatta committee will offer
gold and silver medals, first and second prizes,
j for junior outrigger skiff race. The Alameda
i Boat Club will enter two men: two more are
wanted to insure the race. Those intending to
enter should communicate at once with S. J.

I to guarantee four boats to secure the race.

THE RING.
Straight-Arm / and Round-Arm
Fightersâ Slavin's Downfall.
James J. Corbettâ Jim and Tom
Sharkey, the pride of the American navy,
will shake bands and exchange punches
at the Pavilion on Wednesday evening.
Sharkey is unquestionably a magnificent
specimen of the athlete who scores sue-
cesses on the padded floor in Gneco-
Roman or catch-as-catcb-can wrestling,
but for, fighting under the established
rules of the present day Thomas, in the
language of the judges of dogflesh, is alto
gether too stocky.
Years aeo when fighters battled under
the rules of the London prize ring, men of
Sharkey's caliber proved very successful
because they were possessed of brute
strength and endurance, qualifications
which were deemed quite necessary, by
the way, to guarantee a successful ending.
True, John L. Sullivan, when in his
| prime, was a big husky fellow, but al-
though powerful and savage when in
front of an adversary he was as active as a
cat, and generally used pretty good judg
ment when striking at an opponent.
He whipped all of, his men in quick or
der, as a rule, but readers must not lose
sight of the fact that the fighters who fell
before his powerful blows were slow, yes,
very slow, when compared with the cham
pions of the present day.
f Corbett and Mitchell were the only pugi-
lists Sullivan faced who nuzzled the ex-
champion. . There are men living who
had witnessed * the great international
prize-ring battle in ' France between Sulli-
van and Mitchell.
They do not hesitate to say that
Mitunell bad Sullivan under his thumb at
one stage of the game and would have
.whipped him had. it not been for a large
amount of money Pony Mitchell's
father-in-lawâ received with "the under-
standing that the match be declared a
draw, and so ;it resulted. Be that as it
may, Mitchell made a great stand against
the big and powerful Sullivan, who,
owing to his great weight, sun. [ deep in
the mud and was : consequently heavily
handicapped in this particular.
Kilrain, Ryan, Cardiff and all the other '
< ;â <':.â  â -â â â â  :,. .-â --â .. â¢;.-..., , ;
big fighters whom Sullivan whipped
rather handily, were of the old school of
pugilists who were taught to swing their
dukes and take chances on landing a
knock-out blow.
Corbett and Mitchell punched straight
from the shoulder, and, of course, they in
variably landed, while tbe swinging blows
of their opponents reached only about
half-way on their journey to face or body.
Corbett proved, in his battle with Sulli
van, that a straieht-arm punch, although
probably not as dangerous or as effective
as a swinging blow, is in the long run the
winning styie. Jackson proved the same
thing in his fight with Paddy Slavin who,
by the way, is relegated to the shelf if the
result of his fight with Peter Maher on
Thursday night is to be taken as a line
on his present fighting anility. . \Y' <:
Apropos of the once great fighter Slavin,
Jim Corbett's old trainer, Billy Delaney,
recently received a letter from old Jem
Mace, who is now 65 years old, which
stated that before Slavin's departure from
the land of good old roast beef and stout.
Mace put on the gloves with Paddy, and
was surprised to find bim such an easy
mark to hit. Â°
The letter terminated with a "P. 5.," in
which the old English champion said:
"Billy, on the dead, Slavin is a gone
goose. He can't fight any more, and, if
Maher is any good, he will certainly put it
on him."
Corbett should certainly whip Sharkey.
The only chance the sailor has of winifing
public favor is to mix it Op with Jim, and,
instead of Corbett chasing Sharkey, the
latter's only hope is to chase Corbett,
and â "'catch him if he can."
The following letter from a Stockton
correspondent is self-explanatory:
The boxing exhibition of the Stockton
Athletic Association was the best thing of
its kind that has been seen in th;s city
since the palmy days of boxing when
Charles Turner was in his prime and de
lighted Stocktonians with his cleverness.
Every seat in thb big gymnasium had
been sold long before the opening oi the
doors. The first event was not announced
until after 9 o'clock, and before that time
nearly every seat was occupied. Billy
Armstrong acted as master of ceremonies
and announced that the first event of the
evening would be a two-round bout be
tween Billy Scott, a colored boy, and Billy
McMahon.
The contest was for points and lasted
two rounds. Scott donned blackened
gloves and McMahon fought with a pair
dipped in chalk. The first round was a
hot one and, while the white boy landed
more blows than his opponent, Scott had
him covered with soot before the round
ended. The second round was a repetition
of the first and caused much merriment
among the spectators. Armstrong de
clared the bout a draw. Armstrong
next introduced Danny Mahoney and Joe
Sullivan, both well known in their class.
The event was to be a six-round contest
and it was promised that the decision
would be given to the man who did the
most aggressive work and made the most
points. Mahoney certainly scored the
most points, but the contest was declared a
draw by Referee McCreedy.
The event of the evening was a 10-round
go between Ben Lewis, a colored lad, and
Jim Lawlor. Both weighed in at 125
pounds.
The contest was declared a draw, al
though the best and most aggressive fight
ing was done by Lawlor.
The crowd cheered both fighters and
voted the exhibition the best that has been
given here in years. John Craig.
B
THE ANGLERS.
Large Trout Are Now Being: Caught
In the Ble Sulphur Creek.
1 This is the season of the year when the
j angler's skill is thoroughly tested.
The trout are now of good size and un-
like the "babies'." that are caught by tyros
in angling in April and May with any
kind of lure, the Jnly and August fishes
are "up to snuff" and will not be fooled
by every Tom, Dick and Harry who goes
a-fishing. -'Xy'-
"The flymen" are now enjoying right
good sport. Owing to the late season of
rains several good-sized trout have "re-
mained over," but to catch the artful
dodg rs an angler must employ all the
cunning and skill that is known only to
men of experience.
Reports have been received from several
quarters that there are no fish in the
streams. Those reports come from the
inexperienced anglers, who have much to
learn of the art of catching trout when
the fishes have grown-to be wise and cau
tious. It was only of recent date that a
well-known disciple of the craft returned
from Lagunitas Creek with a basket that
was fairly well filled with trout of good
size. He said that there were at least a
dozen stream-slashers who were in ad-
vance of him, but at the end of the jour-
ney, when baskets were compared, the
expert, with pardonable pride, exhibited a
creel of good-sized fish, much to the aston
ishment and disgust of his brother anglers,
whose baskets contained only dngerlings.
Explanations followed and the experi
enced angler gave his friends a bit of ad-
vice. He said :
Remember, boys, that you represent a pretty
good -sized object when tramping lh a stream.
A trout in clear water is as shy as any fox that
ever lived, and once a denizen of a deep pool
catches your shadow on the water the jig is
up with you. Now, then, if you want to catch
large trout steal catlike along the banks, and
when you arrive at what appears to be a favor-
able spot just wait a few minutes before you
cast your line. Don't splash the water. Drop
your flies or worm as gently as possible. Imi
tate nature as nearly as you can and you
will be rewarded by the capture of a good
fish. That's all. .â â¢/ ,.--â ;.

Many of our fishermen still cling to the hope
that our streams wili someday Di stocked with
varieties of trout which -ill remain continu
ously in the streams in wnich they are placed
and supplant the indigenous variety which run
to salt water. Now, a rule thought on this
subject should convince them that they hope
in vain. Every effect Jus a cause. If our in
digenous trout is enadromou's there certainly
must be a cause for i;, and in this case tne
cause is not difficult to find. Our seasons are
divided into two, the wet and the dry.
During long, dry summer the germination
of parasites in the water is very great. These
prey on the fish as a.-as do on a dog, causing
them to seek relict This they find in cool
temperatures or sal'ne water, hence it has be
come a habit of the suedes. Insect pests are
the cause; the" migration to salt water the
effect. Now when we place foreign varieties
of the same species under the same conditions
is it not natural to .issume that they will adopt
the same habit as the indigenous species? The
cause which forced the habit on one species
will do soon th*- other. Take our California
trout and place it in -eastern waters, where the
trout do not se<k the sea, and they will soon
adapt themselves to their changed conditions
and remain ii. the streams where they are
paced. ,*â .-â 
- '1 hese facts being clear, is it not better for us
to protect the fish we have and be thankful
that it has no superior, either as a game
fighter or a toothsome dish, when caught?
The clause in our fish laws permitting the cap
ture of these fish in tide-waters when they
come in fro the sea to spawn is very perni
cious, and opens the door to illicit practices
and fraud-, which it is almost impossible to
counteract. Expunge this clause and protect
the true California trout, or steelhead, iridea,
or whatever you may elect to call our native
trout, and our streams will again become pro
ductive.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
Concerning One cf the Most Sensa-
tional Events In Cricket Annals.
In their expedition against the cricket
forces of Great Britain the hitherto con
quering eleven from Australia have struck
, a hard and knotty snag. This occurred in
a contest with the If. C. C. and Ground,
the latter team including in its roll such
eminent cracker jacks as Grace, Stoddard,
Jackson and Ranjuxiubji. Tbe M. 0. C.
going in compiled the for them modest
score of 219 runs.
Then followed one of the most remark
able collapses in the whole history of
cricket, the entire Australian team falling
for eighteen runs. To this paltry total
Graham and Trott contributed four and
Bix runs respectively and Kelly eight,
Then Pougher of the M. C. C. got in bis
fine worn and took all tbe remaining
wickets without the cost of one run. This
inimitable achievement has created the
greatest excitement throughout cricket-
Corn.
Who shall stop playing cricket on the
fcoreofage? Playing at Finsbury Park,
London, for the North London Tradesmen
against the Munro 0. C, the veteran
bowler. Charles Absolon, 79 years of age,
has just taken 8 wickets for 70 runs. El
derly members of our association will
please make a memorandum of this
"chirp."
Nottingham has been worsted by Mid
dlesex to the tune of 123 runs.
In the Surrey-Derbyshire match, the re
sult of which is not yet to hand, Abel of
fcurrey scored 109 without a chance.
I mentioned some weeks since that the
Haverlord College cricket eleven was about

on July 4. It is one of the best in the State
for cycling and some records will probably be
broken on the Fourth. The Capital City
Wheeelmen, Terminal City Wheelmen, Stock
ton Road Club, Reliance, Acme and Olympic
clubs are all training for the events. The med
als and prizes will be valuable. Carkeek is
training here for the half-mile run, and will
show the fliers from other clubs some great
speed. Ed I 'acne is doing good work in the
sprints, and is getting very close to even time.
Yesterday he injured his leg a trifle, but to
day he is better. Carter will also enter the
sprints.
E erybody here is greatly excited over the
prospect of the Giants winning the senior
barge race and taking the laurels away from
the South Ends. The men are training hard
and the new boat is expected from the East at
any time. The oars arrived here yesterday by
express and the boat is coming by fast freight-
It has cost the club, including transportation,
some $450, and should be the best boat o i the
coast to-day. With the great strength the
Giants have they should be able to break all
records on the Fourth of July.
The programme for the boxing tournament
on the evening of the Fourth has about been
arranged. Jack Hopkins of the Phcenix Ath
letic Club will go up against lien Maxwell, a
local colored pugilist, in an eight-round con
test. This will be a hot battle, and both men
are in active training for the event.
George Green feud Willis Armstrong will give
a six-round exhibition, and then Van Buskirk
and Patsev Corrigan will meet in the eight
round contest. The event of the evening will
be an eight-round bout between Charlie Tur
ner, formerly of this city, and Tom Barry, the
erstwhile middle-weight champion of the coast.
Barry is training at Antioch. Corrigaa is
training here and getting some of his flesh off.
Entries are beginning to come in for the
field-day events, and it is evident that the
games at Goodwater Grove will be a great
uocess.

The Stockton Road Club, which was organ
ized about a week ago, has some very speedy
riders in It and wiil make a good showing in
the races on the Fourth. Tnere will be a one
mile county championship race on that day
and this will bring out ail the local talent.
There is a project ou foot to hold a 25-mile
track relay race between the members of the
bicycle annex of the Stockton Athletic Asso
ciation and the Stockton Road Club. This
will probably come off soon.
Arrangements are being made for several
hose races here, and one week from next Sun

TAMALPAIS EXCURSION.
First Scenic Railway Trip Up
Marin County's Great
Mountain.
The Whole Length of the Read Frcm
Base to Summit Is Given at
Eight Mil
A merry party of about thirty people ac
cepted the invitation to take the first trip
over the Mill Valley and Mt. Tamalpais
Scenic Railway on Saturday last.
On reaching the terminus of tne narrow
gauge road at the depot, a narrow-gauge
locomotive, attached to which was a
handsome, commodious observation car
similar to the open, ones on the Cliff
House road, except that on each side
were sliding gates that could be closed by
a lever in the hands of the conductor at
one end of the car before the train started,
thus preventing the possibility of a person
being thrown out of the car while in
motion. It had a seating capacity of
sixty, and was furnished with powerful
brakes on the wheels, and as an extra pre
caution had "track-brakes" as well, to be
used in cases of emergency.
On the way up our whole attention was
occupied with the strangeness and beauty
of the trip. "While as a feat in engineer
ing the building of the road may not be
remarkable, yet everybody wondered at
the conception and the skill that con
structed it.
For the first mile or more the track fol-
lows up the Biithedale Canyon, rising
higher and higher above the bed of the
creek, running through the shady forest of
redwoods, buckeyes and fragrant bry
trees, with here and there a cozy cottage
tucked away in some sequestered
nook; passing now an artificial
pond, with its pretty boats and
the children playing in them,
now giving a glimpse of a camping party
with its tents and hammocks and all sorts
of out-of-door conveniences. Close below
lay the little villages of Mill Valley and
Biithedale, almost hidden among the
tre Beyond opened out the bay of Sau-
salito, with its big ships, steamers and
jaunty yachts and pleasure boats,
while on the steep hillsides above could
be seen the villas and cottages nearly
hidden in the abundant growth of trees
and shrubbery; then there came tothe
view the farther reach of the waters of the
bay of San Francisco, Alcatraz, with its
bristling cannon, Verb- Buena and Angel
Island, Goat Island and the Two Brothers.
The whole length of the road from base
to the summit of the mountain is nearly
eight miles, stopping some 250 feet below
the almost perpendicular jaÂ»ged peak on
top; up this good trails will be made, so
that one will feel that he has bad some-
thing to do in the way of mountain climb
ing.
It is expected that the road will bo com
pleted by the first of August and that from
its opening it will afford one of the most
popuiar trips in the State of California.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1896.
THOSE WHO WILL
BE IN FRONT ROWS
Members of the Civic Feder
ation at the Prize-
Fights.
CORBETT ON NEALON.
Believes Him to Be a Magnificent
Specimen of "Old Man-
hood."
THEY WILL PLAY HANDBALL.
Former Methods of Training Have Been
Broken Away From by Both
Broken Away From by Both
Pugilists.
Handball is the fin de siecle method of
training pugilists for the ring. -
Dumb-bell Sifting has gone entirely out
of use and so has club-swinging. 'Wrest
ling is only used in moderation/ and even
sparring is now indulged in but
moderately. As to dieting, it is no longer
thought of, excepting when it is necessary
so as to reduce the fighter to certain
weight.
Corbett, at the Olympic Club on this
side of the Day, and Sharkey at the Acme
Club on the other side, are exemplifica
tions of the new system of training, and
both men are in fit condition to-day to
enter the ring.
They have nearly a weeK more to wait
for results, and they will not allow them
selves to become "stale," nor will they
overtrain. They will simply continue
playing handball at the rate of a half
dozen games each day.
Sharkey, however, in addition to this
does considerable walking and sprinting
to better his limbs as well as his wind.
He drinks nothing but tea, coffee and ale
âvery little of the latter. Corbett, on the
other hand, stints himself in nothing his
appetite or taste dictates.
These handball games in which Corbett
indulges are witnessed daily by an inter
ested crowd, who marvel at the supple
ness of the champion's limbs and the
rapidity with which he can run his im
mense frame around his smaller oppo
nents.
Hampton, the Olymnic Club's champion
handball player, and Corbett make a mag
nificent pair of player.". Up to date their
games have been a tie after many hours of
hard and clever playing. Corbett is firm
in the belief that in a number of suc
cessive games he could outlast the little
man, and it is quite likely he could, his
physique and condition coming to his as
sistance, y --YY
Jim Nealon, the other man of handball
renown who has come against Corbett, is
not so young as Hampton, nor is he as
â ight on bis feet; still he has been able to
hustle Corbett around very lively in a
strange court with' a smaller area and a
softer bail than he has been in the habit of
playing.- Y'X Y;Y
Corbett is one of Nealon's greatest ad
mirers. He was speaking absut him yes
terday afternoon in his brother's place,
where a number of newspaper men met
him. YiY
""Do you know," said the champion,
"that I don't think that I have ever met a
man in my life I have found to be so per
fect in constitution and physique as Jim
Neaion? Of course I'm talking now about
men of his age, *
"Let's see. ; My father is past 55 years of
ape and Jim >eulon is older than he. He
must be going on 80. Still, he's as lively
as a lad of 20 and as strong as an ox. He
strips well and bis wind is great. I don't
know that i have got anything to boast of
if Ido beat Jim. Why shouldn't I, con
sidering 1 am a young man and be is so
old ? I will back him if he would play
j against any handball- player in the world
: of his ace."
Corbett's admiration for James Nealon's
ability represents tne sentiment of all the
people who know him. He is certainly an
athletic man of note, and he is a man who
has never smoKed a cigar, cigarette or
pipe, nor has he ever taken a drink of
strong liquor in his life.
But to get back to Corbett. -.*
The newsboys on Powell and Eddy
streets take a recess every afternoon about
the time the champion is on his way
from exercise at the club to his brother
Harry's saloon. They cease peddling
their papers and their traffic in transfers
to "lay" for Sullivan's victor.
As soon as he comes in sight they make
a run for him, and like a giant he stands
among so many pigmies.
"Scramble fur us, Jim !" they yell on all
sides, and Jim can't help laughing as he
gazes upon the earnest faces of the
expectant little fellows. He knows
quite well what they mean, and he
reaches down into his trousers pockets for
dimes and nickels. He gets this every day
and he is always prepared.
Hauling out a handful of small coins he
hurls them as far up the street as
he can and watches the gamins
"scramble" to pick them up. It is great
fun, but before it is quite over Corbett
starts on a run for his brother's resort to
get away from the returning youngsters.
Corbett's exercise yesterday consisted of
a nine-minute boxing bout with heavy
weight Van Buskirk, after which he im
mediately sparred a round with E. Hislop
and one with Bob McCord.
All this boxing was done without any
interruption excepting the change of
opponents, Corbett being by far the fresher
man of the quartet at the end of the exer
cise.
Following this Corbett and Fred Butz
played and won three frames of handball
against Edward W.Lewis and James C.
Nealon. In these four-handed games the
last two gentlemen did not show to any
great advantage, the Corbett company
winning easily with scores of 4 to 21, 10 to
'li and '6 to 21. The last game came very
near being a "sKunk," Corbett and his
partner reaching nineteen points before
their opponents got a cbalkmark.
James C. Nealon, when seen after the
1 lay, stated that he did not care very
much, anyhow, for a four-handed game.
"I will "meet Ccrbett next Sunday in a
single-handed game and 1 will come pretty
near showing him what handball playing
is. I believe I can defeat him, and I shall
certainly try."
Mr. Nealon is the crack player of the
Occidental Handball Club and his recent
defeats by Corbett have caused much com
ment. * .. - -. y
In explaining them yesterday he said :
"I am not used to playing in a small
court, iror do I care to play with a soft
ball. But I am getting used to the
Olympic's court and on Sunday I'll be as
familiar with it as Corbett is."
The seats for the contest have been going
so fast that the entire downstairs part of
the Mechanics' Pavilion will bo sold out
before Tuesday next. No seats will be
Bold for the gallery until the night of the
contest, when they will be handed out at
$2 apiece at the box-office.
The National Athletic Club has certainly
made a gr-at stroke of business, . finan
cially, in getting up this contest, and is
seriously considering building up more
seats on the lower floor to accommodate
the demand. .?â â ;
Some of the. peonle who have been
tendered the choice boxes and seats are:
Civic Federation, box '42, -section B; Gov-*
ernor James H. Budd, box 49, section B; Mayor
and Board of Supervisors, boxes 42 and, 49,
section A; Board of Police Commissioners, box
41, section A. ,*,.';"_-.-
The Bohemian Club will occupy sec
tions F and I; Pacific-Union and Cosmos
clubs, section A; Olympic Club, sections
B, L and M.
CORBETT WILL PLAY BALL.
Ho Makes His Appearance at Pre-
sidio Park Next Sunday.
The third game of the City league base
ball championship series will be played at
the Presidio Athletic Park to-morrow. The
Pacifies and the Imperials will be the con
testants and a real old-fashioned game is
sure to result as both teams are heavy bat
ters. V V
The Imperials have been materially
strengthened since they played the Cali
fornia?, and this being their second game,
they will naturally improve in their team
work. Nicols is said to be an expert
twirler, and if he is able to hold the Pa
cifies down a bit the sloggers of his team
will surely hammer out a victory.
The Pacifies, on the other hand, are
leaders in the race so far, having won the
only game in which they participated, and
are confident of adding tho Imperials
scalp to their collection.
Following is the make-up of tha oppos
ing clubs:
PAdFICS. Imperials.

STAMPEDED THE HERD.
How Pat McDonougli'i Friends Res-
cued His Cattle From the
Authorities.
Pat McDonough, who keeps a dairy
ranch on the San Bruno road, would have
had to bail his cattle out of the Pound
yesterday but for the assistance of the
neighbors, and now he is liable to lose his
milk permit and some of his friends their
liberty over the affair. 1 V ; -
Some time ago McDonough was warned
to keep his cows out of the swamp and he
did until the Board of Health employes
turned their backs. Then the cows went
back to the morass.
Yesterday Inspectors Dockery and
Davis caught ten of McDonough's cows
feeding in the swamp arid started to drive
them to the Pound. McDonough hastily
gathered a number of his neighbors, made
a short cut through the hills and just
about the time the authorities thought
they had the bovines safe a cavalcade on
horseback and in wagons beating tin cans
and howling wildly swept down on the
herd aud stampeded it effectually.
The last the inspectors saw of McDon
ough's cows they were headed for home
with flying tails, and McDonough is on
the black list. V *

SPRECKELS GIVES
A VALUABLE CUP.
A Very Rich Stake Event
Planned for Next
Year.
FOR THREE - YEAR - OLDS.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club
to Hold the Race An-
nually. \
BUILDING A NEW CLUBHOUSE.
An Elegant Structure at Ingleside to
Ba Finished by October 15th
Next.
The horsemen who bring their equines
to attend the next meeting of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, which begins in Octo
ber of this year, will have an opportunity
to enter their crack three-year-olds in the
most valuable stake event ever run on this
coast.
California Las never had a big stake race
of the importance of the Suburban or
Brooklyn handicaps, and the lack of this
character of events has served to keep
many big turfmen of the East from send
ing their borses to San Francisco. The
Pacific Coast Jockey Club has been figur
ing on giving a race of such value that it
will pay horsemen from all over the coun
try to send in their entries, and at a re
cent meeting the plans were approved.
The race will be known as the "Spreckels
Cup," in honor of the president of the
club, who got up the scheme, and it will
be run during the month of April next, on
a date to be decided after the fall meeting
begins.
The next meeting will not see the last of
the Spreckels cup, however, for it will be
perpetuated by being run in each succeed
ing April as long as the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club conducts its meetings at the
Ingieside course.
Exclusive of entrance fees and forfeits
which should amount to a comfortable
sum the cup will be worth $7500 in coin to
the first three horses under the wire. Of
this the first horse under th,* wire will re
ceive $5000, the second $1500 and' the third
$1000. \ XYY.
The cash prizes will not be the only
thing for which the thoroughbreds will
strive, however, for a valuable cup will be
presented to the winner by President A.
B. Spreckels. This trophy will be worth
$1500 which will brine the value of first
prize up to at least $0500.
The distance will be one and quarter
miles.
Those who attend the fall meeting will
see one great improvement in the Ingle
side grounds in the shape of a handsome
clubhouse for the entertainment of the
enthusiasts who go early and stay late.
The plans were accepted some time ago
and yesterday ground was broken for the
foundations and work on the building will
be pushed steadily to a completion.
It is hoped to' have tho structure in
shape for occupancy on or before October*
15. The plans show an elegant and orna
mental buildinc, and neither pains nor ex
pense will be spared to make it the finest
racetrack clubhouse in the United Slates.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 19.â The nomina
tions and the adoption of the gold plank by the
Republicans at St. Louis yesterday served to
strengthen the marKet fo â  securities to-day. The
news from London was also of an encouraging na
ture. The fact that there were no engagements of
gold for shipment to Europe to-morrow added to
the bullish feeling. Loudon buying was quite a
feature of the day, the foreigners having bought
about 25.0.0 shares. The decisive victor .- of the
gold men at st. liOnia was mainly responsible for
this buying. While the market rule firm
throughout, business was dull, the sales footing up
173,400 shares. . .J .< -
The gains in prices ranged from 1 j to % to 13'g
per cent, outside of Tobacco, which jumped irom
65 to 68 on a report that divMendson the common

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Inâ June 19.â With the elimina
tion of the Republican Convention as a factor in
the wheat market.' trade in that grain fell into an
easy and quiet position. At the opening this morn
ing business was quite active, but after the expira
tion of the first half hour less animation was
noted. The direct influences having an adverse
effect on values were heavy Northwestern re
ceipts, 515 cars, lower Liverpool cables and fine
harvesting weather. Later in the session, on a re
port of a sharp demand for winter wheat at coun
try stations, shorts were Induced to cover, prices
recovering and advancing by the operation.
closing continental cables were generally lower.
Export clearances were fair at 282.700 bushels.
Damage was also reported from spring wheat sec
tions, and received more or less considers; ion.
t-eptember Wheat opened from 58% c to 58% c,
sold between 57y_@576/8c and 59y8c, closing at
58% c, %c higher than yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 30 cars.
COR**-.\'o essential improvement In business
was perceptible in the corn market. It was the
same dull grind of scalping and local transactions
to which no real importance was attached. The
operations were based on the feeling of the wheat
market' with some reference also to heavy re
ceipts, 349 curs, and lower Liverpool cables. With
drawals from store were 304.424 bushels. Export
clearances were light at 37.200 bushels. Sep
tember corn opened at 29@29i/Bc,sold between 29c
and 295/gc, closing at 29%@29%'"'. yB@%c higher
than y esterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
400 cars.
OATSâ Were easy and lower, both on their own
position as respecting the crop prospects and on
account of the weakness which surrounded them.
Receipts were free at 434 cars and 359,300
bushels were taken from store. Export clearances
were large at 312 586 bushels, The close was
. teady. September closed unchanged from yester
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 274 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash 81%@81%c: July 81c ;
September. 821 _c. Receipts 17 cars.
VISION Â» â The product market was in
equally as discouraging a state as was any of the
grain markets. It was believed that the result of
the Republican convention would contribute to
the revival of business and strength, but hopes in
thin direction were not as yet realized. The run
of hogs at the yards this morning was heavy
which dampened the ardor of the buyers of the
product. September pork closed 10c under yester
day, September lard 2i/2(g>sc lower and September
ribs 5c lower. " *'â -

DIN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 19.â R. G. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the week have been 276 in the United
states, against 228 last year, and 28 In Canada,
against 31 last yen. There are continued signs
that again in business has begun. Stocks have
gone higher than they ere before the artificial
break ten days ago. Wh- at and cotton are in bet
ter demand. There is more confidence in mone
tary circles ami the tendency toward shrinkage In
great industries seems it. some measure at least to
be caeca While the outcome of the Demo
cratic Convention it uncertain and the great crops
are not yet wholly beyond danger a sure and
strong improvement could hardly be expected,
but. he tone In business circles has grown mere
hopeful. Clearing-bouse exchanges for the past
week are 3.4 per cent less than last year's and
Only 5.2 per cent less than In 1893.
The boot and shoe Industry not only holds Its
place as the most prosperous of the great indus
tries, but reports some gain both in order, and
prices. ,
Textile manufactures do not gain. There is
rather more hopefulness, which is telt in the arrest
or the decline 111 wool; prices average no lower
than June 1 and sales do not deer. se. Manufac
turers await orders which clothiers hope scon but
are not yet ready to give, and the only changes in
prices are declines ot 5 to 10 per cent in some very
iow-graue goods. The only change in CO tons is a
reduction in bleach shirtings in standards to the
lowest price ever reached, though the change dis
closes no new weakness, hut a belief that the time
lias come when sales can be affected by reduction,
and large sales are now reported. Stocks of deal
ers are bound 10 be so low that replenishment
would now ma a great change in the condition
of the Industry, ,
The watting in iron and steel brings a slightly
lower average in pricesâ the lowest sine- April 1,
and only 1.8 per cent above the lowest ofthe year,
though the combinations make no change in
quotations. Beams are quoted delivered instead
of at the mill, but numerous contracts are kept
back. Consumption of wire nails at current prices
has so declined that American wire rods are of
fered at competing prices in England. Scarcely
anything is done in iron bars, because steel bars
at 1.1 per cent take the business, and tbe billet
pool is still undersold about $1 by middlemen,
while many works are putting steel plants of
their own. Plates are weak, arid also sheets, and
orders for rails, though numerous, are not lame.
Southern No. 1 is offered $1 below Pennsylvania
bo,-. and gray forge is 10c lower at , Pittsburg.
Since coke was advanced to 82 per ton the ovens
at work have decreased 33 per cent and the
weekly output 60,463 tons, or 35 per cent.

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been 11 arrivals irom the coast
mines with 26,467 tons of coal: the St. Mnngo from
Swansea with 2877 tons, j ana Sprlngburn from
Australia with 3995 tons. The liberal Imports
from the Northern mines this week have relieved
the market, although but two foreign cargoes have
come to baud, alt the foreign arriving since May
19. it Is a lone period since it has been recorded
that we have had but two foreign cargoes of coal
arrive here within 28 days.. It clear!/ shows how
Independent we have become on the fuel question,
i. c.. that our coast output is ample for our require
ments. Of course it would work a serious hard
ship on our consumers if they were lett entirely in
the hands of the Northern mines, as the low prices
rating are entirely rczulated by tne delivery cost
of Australian and English; .f these latter were re
tire 1 irom the market for an Indefinite period,
much higher values would be established for our
coast coils. The Australian strike is still in force.
and may last through this month, although recent
cables intimate an early settlement; It his already
lasted long enough to seriously dismember busi
ness."

MEN WHO HEARD THE TRIAL.
Mrs. Mayhrick's Prospects Have
Been Hurt by Cheap
Agitation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 19. f
The attempt to raise money on behalf
of Mrs. May brick, which was worked suc
cessfully in the Northern Pacific Coast
States, was also attempted in this city,
although it does not appear that it pro
pressed through any more than the pre
liminary stage. This was to send a circu
lar to prominent people stating the pur
poses of the "Maybnck Association," and
that an agent would appear later who
would be authorized to collect subscrip
tions.
The circular was a very simple affair
and did not deal in detail, but denounced
the imprisonment of Mrs. Maybrick as an
outrage, and stated that with a sufficient
fund the case could be reopened and the
woman now in Woking Penitentiary would
undoubtedly be acquitted.
One of those who received the circular
was Dr. 0. L. Jones of this city. The doc
tor is well posted on the Maybrick case.
having been traveling in England at the
time of the trial. He was prepared to
have an interesting talk with the "agent,"
but the publication of a Maybrick swin
dle from the north a few days ago seems
to have upset the arraneements, for the
agent has not yet appeared, nor is he ex
pected.
"The friends of Mrs. Maybrick," said
Dr. Jones to-day, "have a wrong concep
tion of the facts. They are working ou
the idea that Mrs. Maybrick was thrown
into prison, and that the British Home
Secretary, who is the active part of
royalty in such cases, is afraid to
advise her pardon, because the pop
ular voice demands it. This is far
from being the case. The trial of Mrs.
Maybrick was one of the most sensational
ever heard in the historic St. George's
Hall, Liverpool. So confident were the
public that a verdict of acquittal would
be brought in that they carried large
white bouquets into court ready to pre
sent to her when the verdict should be
pronounced. They haa even asked per
mission to pass the bouquets to her wuile
she was still in the dock. Everybody
wanted her acquitted and the public sen- j
timent to this day is in her favor. These j
conditions, however, do not appear to !
have any weight with the Home Secretary :
and mere are many who think that if |
there had been less cheap agitation on j
her behalf her chances of a pardon would |
have been greater." i
There is another gentleman living in
this city who heard all of that wonderful j
trial. He is an Englishman and naturally j
has a high opinion of British jurispru
dence. His comparisons of the manner
of carrying out sentences as evidenced by
Mrs. Maybrick and Durrant are, however,
interesting at this time.
"Mrs. Maybrick had one of the fairest
trials,"' he said to-day, "and perhaps the
ablest criminal pleader in the world, Sir
Charles Russell, to defend her. No one
doubted the fairness of her trial and the
jurors must have been clearly convinced
of her guilt when they rendered a verdict
of guilty in the face of public op
position." In my opinion, it ill be
comes the people of this country
to dictate to Great Britain how law should
be administered. Here the jails are full of
murderers and there are scores more at lar_-e
that should have been hanged years ago if it
were not for corruption. Compare Deming,
who was hanged in Australia a few years
ago, with Durrant. When is ever a rich
man hanged in this country? Don't you
know, I think the Home Secretary must
have some grit to refuse to obey the de
mand of this Nation. Talk about sympa
thy for Mrs. Maybrick. The ladies of Liv
erpool would have carried her out of the
dock if they could and have set her free."
TO CEMENT A RESERVOIR
Result of Health Officer Rowell's
Analysis of Berkeley
Water.
Trustees Advised to Have Constructed
a Cement Bottom for the
Berryman Tank.
BERKELEY. Cal.. July 19.â Dr. H. N.
Rowell, Health Officer of Berkeley, has
â¢ just completed an analysis of the water
supply of the town, made at the instance
of several complainers who declared that
there was an objectionable odor about the
water.
Dr. Rowell, with Sanitary Inspector
Frank Thompson, visited the Alameda
Water Company's reservoir and secured
for chemical examination samples of the
water furnished to the town.
"I find that there is some vegetable mat-
ter in the water, though not much," said
Dr. Rowell to-day. "There is nothing
dangerously harmful in the fluid, but the
vegetable matter is not desirable and steps
should be taken to remedy this one defect
in so far as is possible.
"I shall recommend that the Alameda
Water Company be compelled to provide
a cement bottom for its reservoirs, or else
to cover them over. Either one of these
two courses will do away with the evil that
has been complained of."
The reservoir which It is proposed to
have provided with a cement bottom is tbe
lowest of the company's three reservoirs,
Known as the Bern-man reservoir. It has
a capacity of about 25,000,000 gallons. A
rough estimate of the cost of constructing
the cement bottom places the expense at
about $10,000.
* If the Board of Town Trustees should
adopt the recommendation of Dr. Rowell
and order the Alameda Water Company
to cement the bottom of its reservoir the
company would be compelled under the
Jaw to give heed to the order, the improve-
ment being one which it is in the power
of the Trustees to order as a sanitary
measure.
The nearest time at which the cement-
ing is likely to be done is next winter,
when the reservoir can be emptied with
assurance of an immediate supply of
water to refill it.

VISITED BY A JURY.
shown the Device by Lottery-Dealers
to Prevent Being Seen by-
Players.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 19.â The sight
of a jury, with the court and all of its offi
cials, visiting a Chinese lottery joint, is
novel and attracted much attention when
they filed into "Big Jim's" place on
Eighth street, near Washington. Captain
Wilson was in charge, assisted by Bailiff
Mitchell.
One of the witnesses for the prosecution
swore that he looked through a door and
saw the defendant behind a partition, built
specially to conceal him from view. This,
said the defendant's attorney, was an im
possibility, and in order that the jury
â¢night see the condition of things. Judge
Wood decided that the jurors might see
for themselves the condition of the prem
ises. The jury inspected the blind parti
tion aDd room in tbe rear carefully. Slips
had been cut through the partition to per
mit of the passing of the tickets out, to
purchasers. The shelves on each side had
been inclined at a slight angle so that a
person could not look through the slits
and see anybody. At the door, through
which the witnesses referred to, it was
seen that a screen two feet wide had been
put up to prevent persons on the outside
catching a glimpse of the dealer inside.

It has been discovered that all the heirs
to the $55,000,003 paid by the French Gov
ernment to the Government of the United
States nearly a century ago are not all
dead. Three of their- are at present resid
ing in Oakland. They are the minor chil
dren of Mayor Davie. â â â XX. < V
The fund in the National treasury known
as the French spoliation claims would
have been distributed under the provisions
of a bill passed by the last Congress, but it
was vetoed by the President. The money
was paid by France and held in trust by
the United States for depredations to pri
vate persons and property during the ex
citing years at the end of the last century
ana the commencement of the present one.
The grandfather of Mayor Davie's chil
dren resides at 155 Hawthorne street, San
Francisco. He has for. years been in
possession of oil the data *-' necessary to
establish the claim of ] .his grandchildren,
and he will at once taKe steps to see that
the money is paid to those for whose bene
fit it was intrusted. to the Government of
this country. â¢ *-â¢ .'-Y
very interesting little story is told by
the grandfather, James Biddolph, in a let
ter received by Mayor Davie this morning:
155 Hawthorne Street, )
San Francisco, June 18, 1896. j
John L. Davie, Mayor of Oaklandâ Dear Sir:
! There are reports that ail cf the heirs to the
1 French spoliation claims are dead. Hut I can
i assure you that there are a great many claim-
I ants that are very much alive. Your own
three children are heirs in a direct line for
those claims.
The schooner Variety, a duly registered ves
sel of the United States, Micah Dyer, master,
i bound on a lawful voyage to Leghorn, sailed
from Duxbury, Mass., January, 1798, and in
' March, 1798, when near the entrance of Leg-
I horn Harbor, was seized by a French cruiser or
| vessel of war and taken tothe Isle of Corsica
and was there condemned by French tribunals
and wholly lost to her owners. By reason of
said capture Micah Dyer was thrown into a
French prison.
After being robbed of all he possessed, and
.offering in bod; and mind through the filth
of French dungeons and the insults of French
citizens, he was afterward cast out In a foreign
! land penniless to make his way the best ho
'â  could to his native land. His case has been
tried and his claims proved valid, and the
money to pay those Claims' was received by
the United States and paid into the United
States treasury nearly 100 years ago, under
Andrew Jackson's administration. This Gov
ernment has therefore had in its possession
for nearly a century money belonging to
Micah Dyer and his heirs.
Your children's great-granamother, now
nearly 89 years old and residing with me,
Mrs. Minerva 8. Oliver, is Micah Dyer's eldest
daughter. There are three other (laughters,
now residing in Massachusetts. If they think
the claimants are all dead there is a fine
chance for them to undeceive themselves by
applying to Jajies I'idpolph.
Mayor Davie went to San .Francisco this
Mnyor Davie went to San .Francisco this
afternoon to see what further steps should
be taken in the matter. "I have known
this for a long time," be said, "but not in
such a definite way as Mr. Biddolph has
now placed it. If his facts are capable of
proof there should be no difficulty in hay-
ing the spoliation bill passed over the
veto at the next session of Congress.
The three young heirs are all bright
boys and capable musicians. Under the
training of their father, who was at one
time a tenor soloist in grand opera, they
have made wonderful progress and nightly
concerts with home talent are the pro-
gramme at the Davie residence.

meda auxiliary of the Woman Suffrage
Association held its usual meeting this
afternoon inG. A. R. Hall. The question
discussed was, "Why Are So Many
Women in -Business Occupations?" The
answer given was, because monopolies and
corporations controlled the business arena
of the Union, forcing men to accept wages
that would not support the family. This
compelled women to leave the home and
earn a living to make existence possible.
Mrs. Morris sang "The Brook" charm
ingly before the discussion began.

Banker Stephen G. Little of Dixon was
buncoed out of $7500, closed its case this
morning. -v They succeeded in getting the
National Government bluebook as evi
dence to show that there was no such as
sayer in the Philadelphia Mint as Morton,
a3 he is alleged to have represented him
self to be to the banker.
"Big-foot" Gordon was the first witness
for the defense, and he denied that he was
in OaKland the day the alleged ounko
game was worked, saying he was in New
York at the time.
He was substantiated by William de
Bell, who testified he was employed in a
livery stable in that city at the time and
hired a rig to Gordon.

Wickham was one of the railroad strik
ers in 1894, and being unable to get any-
thing to do, he hired a horse and buggy
â  and left for parts unknown. At Bakers
field he disposed of the rig for $20, but was
I subsequently caueht and brought back to
this city for trial.
When the case came to trial his attorney
made no defense, but claimed that the in-
formation against defendant had not been
filed with the County Clerk by the District
Attorney within the time specified by law,
and asked for an acquittal. The District
Attorney admitted at the time that the
i failure to file the information was due to
; the carelessness of a clerk, and the court
I overruled the motion to dismiss, and now
the Supreme Court has reversed the lower
! court and orders the prosecution dis-
I missed, unless good cause is shown for

SWEET GRAPES IN JUNE.
Yuma Heights Matures the Ber
ries Ahead of Any Section
in the Country.
Proud Achievement of a Man of Pluck
and Enterprise in the Arizona
Desert.
Grapes, sweet, ripe and fully matured in
the middle of June is the proud record of
Yuma Heights, a section of irrigated
desert about two miles from the town of
Yuma.
They were raised by H. W. Blaisdell of
Yuma and a sample box of them shipped
to W. G. Curtis, engineer of maintenance
of ways of the Southern Pacific Company,
who was showing them to his friends Yes
terday as a gratifying tribute to the pluck
and enterprise of Mr. Blaisdell. Accom
panying the fruit was the following letter:
I forward by to-day's express a small box of
Thompson's seedless grapes from the > Yuma
Heights ranch, such as we are < shipping in all
directions.
Please show them to Mr. Kruttschnitt. I
should also like to have Mr. Smurr see them.
Next year we should be prepared to ship 100
tons of such fruit before June 20.
Mr. Curtis is deeply interested in the
labors of his friend, who by his persist
ence and determination, has demonstrated
that the variety of grapes mentioned, as
well as other table grapes, can be placed
on the market from Yuma fully a month
ahead of those raised in any other part of
the United States. For this reason alone
Mr. Curtis thinks there is justification for
the irrigation of that district.
"'.* "Blaisdell's enterprise," said Mr. Curtis,
"has done more for this section than any
other man. The water used for irrigating
by Mr. Blaisdell is brought to Yuma,
Heights in pipes from the Colorado River'
where it is pumped by steam power to the

TWENTY YEARS FOR ROBBERY.
Judge Wallace's Kule for Highway-
men Still Holds Good.
Judge Wallace does not intend that the
footpad industry shall be revived during
the present spell of darkness in this City
if he can help it. He yesterday sentenced
J. Jones, a negro, who some time ago held
up Leonard Roach and robbed him of
$2 30 and a watch, to twenty years in the
(State prison.
Jones' attorney pleaded that his client
was a man of family and would at once on
his liberation leave San Francisco forever
by shipping on a deep-water vessel if given
a light sentence. His Honor could not
find any reason for leniency in the promise
and held to his usual rule to give foot
pads a twenty-year sentence.

NAT GOODWIN DID
NOT CALL US JAY.
The Comedian Makes a
Speech Denying the
Impeachment.
HAS FELT LONELY HERE
He Tells His Woes to His Friends
at the Baldwin Profes
sional Matinee.
BUT "JAY" IS UNGENTLEMANLY
Even a Series of Dress Rehearsals
Could Not Goad Him to Insult
the Public.
Nat C. Goodwin gave a "professional
matinee" yesterday afternoon at the Bald
win Theater, where, surrounded by his
brother and sister actors, he took the op
portunity of denying in the most emphatic
manner that he had ever been guilty of
anything so "ungentlemanly, unprofes
sional and unkind" as to call San Fran
cisco a "jay town."
The "professional matinee" could not
have been convened for the purpose of giv
ing Mr. Goodwin an opportunity of mak
ing the amende honorable to this City, as
it was announced a week ago, and the in
terview in which the comedian was repre
sented as using the word "jay" only ap
peared in a local paper on Thursday morn
ing.
Mr. Goodwin was called on for a speech
at the end of the second act, and in the
exuberance of his feelings and talking to
so many members of the "profesh" he
began talking of his woes, and laying his
hand on his heart he assured his brethren
that the ungentlemanly word "jay" had
never escaped his lips.
Nearly every one who is any one in
local theatrical circles was there â
the stately Maxime Elliott to the willowy
Papinta. The men were more in evidence
than the women, as they strolled out be
tween the acts, and people who did not
know their features again recognized them
by their stage strides.
Daniel Frawley occupied an advan
tageous position before the entrance cur
tains, where no one could fail to behold
him. Kelcey hid his head in the darkest
recesses of a box, as modestly as if he had
been a debutante. Fred Butler of the
Grand sat between two ladies in the par
quet, looking as meek and mild as if he
had never known what it was to be a
villain, and the dashing Lizzie B. Ray
mond of the Orpheum made a record for
herself by removing her hat. Most of the
millinery present was non-committal.
â¢ Never have Goodwin and his troupe, es
pecially the troupe, acted as they did yes
terday "afternoon in "A Gilded Fool." Their
jokeYwere lau.hed at; their points were
appreciated, and thunders of applause
spurred them on to fresh efforts. At the
end of the second act there was a call for a
speech, and Goodwin remarked, pleas
antly, that after what he had just passed
throuah he really could not find words to
express his delight at the laughter and ap
plause. "It is so kind of you to have come
this afternoon, because we have all felt so
lonely. Since coming here we have had
nothing but a succession of dress rehear
sals. Call again and see us.
"I don't wish to be understood as saying
anything against San Francisco. There is
a certain word which reporters are very
fond of using â word jay â I never said
it. To use such a word would be ungentle
manly, unprofessional and unkind to the
few people who have had the courage to
visit as. We want to keep their good
opinion,-and it is not right to insult the
public."
Having dismissed the subject of the
word "jay" Goodwin went on to congrau
late his former employe, Tim Frawley;
He also spoke affectionately of Kelcey,
Stock well and Beach, and concluded with:
"I do not believe in any little antagon
isms between them which is said to exist.
Shake hands, and may God bless you."
At the conclusion of toe performance
many of the professional visitors went be-
hind the scenes and partook of light re
freshments. Among those present were:
Herbert Kelcey, Miss Effie Shannon, Miss
Winona Shannon, John T. Sullivan, L. R.

HOW'S THIS FOR HIGH?
Specimen of Oats From the Cotati
Ranch That Is Over Eight
Feet in Height.
Oats 8 feet 4 inch tall. Just think of it!
This is something pretty high, even for
California. In fact, the owners of the
specimen think it good enough for presen
tation to the Academy of Sciences, and so
that is what they are going to do with it.
This extraordinary specimen is the prop-
erty of K. O. Gates" and H. R. Babb and
was" grown near the station of Cotati, mid
way Detween Santa Rosa and Petaluma,
on what is known as the Page ranch.
The ranch formerly consisted of 10.000
acres, but has lately been .undivided and
sold in sections.
The owners say that, though the speci
men they have just brougut down with
them is as pood as could be found in the
field, yet there is no place that a man could
stand therein and not be hidden from view.

JAMES G. MAGUIRE
REACHES HOME.
He Will Remain Here and
Take -Part in the
Campaign.
SAYS SILVER WILL WIN
The Congressman Says the Silver
Men Will Not Trifle at
Chicago.
A SILVER PLANK AND MAN.
There Will Be No Straddle and No
Thought or Care What the
Goldbugs Do.
Congressman James G. Maguire arrived
home from Washington with his family
last evening. He will remain here during
the campaign and take an active part in it,
CONGRESSMAN JAMES G. .MAGUIRE, WHO RETURNED FROM WASHINGTON
LAST NIGHT.
both in behalf of his own fortunes in the
Fourth District, in which he is a candidate
for re-election, and in behalf of the party
and the silver cause.
Last evening at bis home, Mr. Maguire
expressed his satisfaction with the State
platform and his belief that the party will
at Chicago declare for free silver and
nominate a strong silver man, giving the
Democracy chances of success.
"The Democratic State Convention
adopted a good platform," he said, "and
of course I can't deny that it elected a
good delegation to Chicago.
"I approve the silver plank in the plat
form, of course, and I think it expresses
the sentiment of four-fifths of the party in
this State â yes, probably nine-tenths of it.
"The remonetization of silver will be the
issue of the campaign, and all others will
be overshadowed by it. I am satisfied
that the National Convention will not only
adopt a strong silver platform, but nomi
nate candidates who stand and who have
stood steadfastly for the same proposition.
The plank will not be a straddle. That
would be absolute folly.
"If the gold men have more than a
third of the convention the two-thirds
rule will be abolished instantly. The sil
ver men will be too much in earnest to
allow any mere precedent of party usage
to force them to nominate a gold or a
compromise candidate on a silver plat
form. It doesn't matter what the gold
men do. They will not bolt on account
of abolishing the two-thirds rule, as has
been suggested. If they are disposed to
bolt on the platform they may do it, but
it would be folly for them to swallow a
silver platform and bolt because a party
precedent was disregarded. The majority
of that convention will not stop to inquire
what the gold men will do.
"As to candidates there are a good
many available men, but no candidate has
assumed such a decided lead on the fight
as to make a prediction worth anything.
I can't say that I have any decided prefer
ences myself. I am personally well
acquainted with some of the leading
candidates and I naturally incline
to tbem. Among them are Vice-
President Stevenson, who has been
silent on the money question, Bland,
and Morrison, whom I was for, but
who has made some declarations that
probably put him out of the race. Camp
bell of Ohio is a good man and took a
strong position for silver, while Governor

Boies and Matthews are strong men. I
think that the candidate to be selected
must be a leading Democrat who: has a
record as a leader in this silver cause,
either State or National.
"With a silver platform and a silver
candidate I think the prospects of Demo
cratic success will be good with the
chances in favor of the Democratic ticket.
I think that the fight will increase in in
tensity as it goes on, and develop into a
fight between the money power, for which
the extreme East is rather an agency than
a controlling force, and the masses of the
people, who realize that they are being
enslaved by the money system.
"The whole fight for the gold standard,
both to establish it and to maintain it, is
being made by the great moneyed inter
ests of Europe and tire extreme East,
which have the homes, industries and
commerce of the people of all the rest of
the country mortgaged to them and
which insist on drawing their tribute in
gold only."
When asked about the possibility of any
agreement on candidates between the
Democrats and Populists he said:
"I have no knowledge of any such pos- '
sibility, and I hardly think any such thing
is possible. I don't think any such ar
rangement could be made now. There
might come about a certain community of
action, but it would not probably be
brought about by prearrangement."
As one of the leading and best-known
single-taxers in the country, Mr. Maguire
is much interested in the single-tax cam
paign in Delaware.
''The single-tax movement has grown
very strong in all parts of Delaware,"
he said, "and while I never believed
it possible that the sentiment or
credeuce of a State could be changed
in one year's campaign, yet the
single-tax men of Delaware strongly
believe that a majority will favor it in
November. The growth of the single-tax
theory there has been so rapid as to make
that prediction reasonable.
"My belief is that some reasonable con
cessions will be made to the single-taxers,
and that they ougnt to be accepted. The
main concession would probably be the
abolition of the polltaxes, except the
small polltax necessary to be paid under
the constitution to secure the right of suf
frage. The fact that the system of taxa
tion in Delaware is especially mixed, and
indefensible by the opponents of the single
tax, makes that field a fertile one to
work in."
BRODERICK'S ESTIMATES
Working on the Figures That Will
Be Used in Making Up the
Tax Levy.
Auditor Brodenck and his entire cleri-
Auditor Broderick and his entire cleri
cal force has been working for two nights
past on the estimates for the next fiscal
year sent in by the various municipal de
partments and preparing the same for the
Board of Supervisors.
The Auditor figures each year what the
amount of the various appropriations
should be and submits the same with
what the head of the departments ask to
the hoard, which decreases or increases
the appropriations as it sees tit.
The tax levy is based on the aggregate
of these appropriations and the estimate
of revenue, which is also made up by the
Auditor.
Thus far Mr. Broderick has made only
minor changes in the demands, but the
heaviest â those of the Street, Â«Police and
Fire departmentsâ have not been cone
into, and here the heaviest cuts are ex
pected.
The Auditor's complete estimate will be
submitted to the board on Monday.
SOUTHSIDE IMPROVEMENTS.
Arrangements Being Made for a Big

The executive committees of the South

evening at Dr. Rottanzi's office. The sec
retary was directed to send communica
tions to the officials of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Railroad requesting that
the Fourteenth-street crossing be bitumin
ized ; also to the officials of the Market-
Railway Company, requesting them to
bituminize the crossings of Folsom and
Sixteenth, Tenth and Eighth streets.
A committee consisting ot G. L. Center, I
A. G. Maguire and P. Heyfron and the of- j
ficials of Folsom-street clubs 3 and 4 was
appointed to arrange for a mass-meeting
of the Folsom-street people, from Sixth
street to the water-front, to hasten the
completion of the bituminizing of Folsom
street. A committee consisting of G. L.
Center, A. B. Maguire, G. G. Raabe,
F. W. McEwen, R. E. Cole, P. Heyfron,
J. Schwartz and Dr. Rottanzi, was ap
pointed to co-operate with the committees

FOURTH OF JULY
AND FATHER YORKE.
Gives Reasons Why Foreign
Flags Should Wave
in Parade.
HE POINTS TO HISTORY.
Charges the Celebration Commit-
tee With Narrowness
and Ignorance.
GREEN FLAG IN THE CIVIL WAR
His Address Delivered at the Enter-
tainment of the League of the
Cross Cadets.
The principal feature of the entertain
ment and social given at Native Sons'
Hall, 414 Mason street, last night by Com-
pany C of the League of the Cross Cadets
was the lecture by Peter C. Yorke on "The
Fourth of July and Foreign Flags."
The hall was beautifully decorated for
the occasion. Much of the ornamentation
consisted of the American flag in various
forms and positions.
In speaking to his subject, Father Yorke
said substantially:
"It is easy to see I am in the house of
my friends." He said this in recognition
of the ovation of applause he received from
the audience, which crowded the hall to
the doors. "I think Company Cis a good
company to help, and I am willing to do
my part to help them on this occasion.
"Company Cis not like some organiza
tions which are unable to go down in
their pockets and pay for their own uni-
forms, but want a town which is not able
to pay its gas bills to buy them for them.
Down in the Fourth of July committee
offices you will find an advertisement ior
patriots. I'll tell you who some of the
Continental Army are. They are those who
value their front teeth at $50,000. They
will ultimately have the stripes without
the stars.
"The Fourth of July committee has
agreed that no foreign flags shall be per
mitted in the Fourth of July procession.
They may be afraid that they might pro-
mote treason and that the Pope might
come over and elope with the army.
"The League ol the Cross is an Ameri
can institution. Most of its members
were born here. 'Old Glory' is good
enough for them all the time.
"I believe in occasions when we should
show Old Glory only. But on the Fourth
of July we should remember that other
I flags have floated in the past and should
I be floated still side by side with the Stars
I and Stripes. The issue is raised by a con
spiracy and by a false. issue. We would
lay down our lives if necessary to defend
the flag of our common country. This
Nation is cosmopolitan. We should
not turn our backs on the Nations that
helped us when we needed help. The ob
! jection to the nag comes from those who
call themselves Anglo-Saxons. The objec
i tion also comes from men who have not
j renounced their allegiance to England,
and who have in their hearts a secret alle-
J giance to England's bloody rag.
"Tuttle, chairman of the Fourth of July
' parade committee, bears a name that can-
I not be found on the register of San Fran
cisco. Two of them who are standing by
i him on the committee were born subjects
! of Victoria.
"When other countries do us injustice
| then is the time to rally to our common
i flag. But we should not crush out mem
ories of other countries. Love of country
makes all men brothers, and all nations
one. The men who keep tor-sign flags out
of the procession know very little about
the history of the Fourth of July. Did
i the thirteen colonies spurn the foreign
flag? Every flag of other nations, except
; England, was welcome and present and
I did pood service in that cause. The cry
of Pope is not a new one. It was heard
i when there was talk of French alliance
: with the revolutionists as told in Fisk's
History of the American Revolution."
Here Father Yorke read extracts from
the history to prove his statement.
Continuing, he said: "There is a pedi
! gree to every lie. France helped us with
\ 1,000,000 francs. Lafayette, the gallant
I chevalier, fought side by side with Wash
ington. When the colonial army was in
need of a tactician to train the farmers
| who did it but a German, Yon Stuben?
: He made them one of the finest armies in
the world. They were also helped by
j Kosciusko and Pulaski. King Frederick
of Prussia stopped the drafting of the
| Hessians. A tax was placed on their ex
! portation, as though they were cattle. Yet
to-day the flag of that foreign prince is
proscribed.
"And the end at Yorktown, what was
that?
"It was there that Cornwall's army sur
rendered. Yet on that great day the colors
of France floated with the stars and stripes.
The army of Kochambeau marched side
by side with the army of Washington at
that victory. Fisk says of Rochambeau
that his assistance was "one which cannot
be too heartily acknowledged. ' Yet this
Fourth of July committee boycotts the
flag that made the Fourth of July a possi
bility.
"There is one flag, though, in particu
lar which these men cannot stomach.
They call it a 'green rag,' and say it repre
sents no nation and no country. It stands
for something higher â freedom and prin
ciple. We will stand till its cause is suc
cessful. No wonder the hirelings of Eng
land hate it. They forget it was side by
side with the Stars and Stripes during the
Civil War in glorious death or glorious
victory.
"Our flag, the stars and stripes, should
have first place* everywhere at all times.
No flag should be allowed to fly higher,
but I do not believe in the narrow patriot-
ism which proscribes on the Fourth of July
the Hags that helped to make the history
of this country. We should not be led by
English sympathizers. Above all things
we must see that the Union
shall be preserved. Bats ana owls shall
not succeed," he said, referring to the
A. P. A. "They are already squabbling
over the bones of their patriot organiza

What ol the Buckleyites now?
Gavin Mi-Nab has been wiping away his
sweat since Tuesday, leaning on a spade
most of the time and telling that he has
just finished rounding a mound of garbage
over the grave where Buckleyicm lies
sleeping. Y\
The Junta people generally have been i
taking it for granted since Tuesday that
the "Buckley" party organization would
now disintegrate at ; once and that the
members of this faction would break each
other's necks getting in behind Rainey,
Daggett and Lanigan, who now have a
sure grip on the Junta organization.
But the seating of the Daggett-Ralney-
McNab delegation in the State Convention '
has but put new vigor and determination
into the "regular" organization. They are
going for the municipal fight now, and j
they, are- just taking off their coats and I
getting really to work. -
The Occidental Club . was crowded last
night. The leaders of the faction and the
most reliable and : influential district- j
, workers were gathered there, and they
seemed to feel better for the thrashing
they got at Sacramento. They surely felt
more like fighting, and , every mother's
son of them declared that they were right
in the middle of a big fight and that they
proposed to stay there.
The State Convention, they say, is one
thing and municipal politics another. As
they held a majority of the old committee
when the Junta split off last fall when the
gas was turned out, they declare that they
have an incontrovertible and unassailable
claim to being the regular Democratic
municipal party.
They say that the courts must recognize |
the fact that they alone are entitled to a I
place on the ticket under the title "Demo-
cratic," and that they will hold on to and 1
battle for this right. > yv
They also point to the. fact that they
enroll four or five times the number of
voters the other side can lay claim to, that
they have practically all the party workers
with them except those who follow Rainey
or who are enrolled ' by v Daggett, that in
the fight at Sacramento they bad every
consideration of party right and reg

ularity on their side while the suc
cessful opposition had simply the
effective cry of "Buckleyism," that
their organization is full of leading men
who never followed Buckley and who
never could be controlled by him, and
that the rival organization is a disorgan

CHARGED WITH FILIBUSTERING.
Captain Oiclttnan of the Laurada Under
Arrest at I'hila'delphia.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., June 19.âWar
' rants for the arrest of Captain Dick man of
j the steamer Laura-da and Colonel Emilio
| Nunez, the Cuban leader, were issued this
! afternoon charging them with conducting
j a filibustering expedition to Cuba on that
vessel. The Laurada arrived here a few
, days ago from a southern trip, and it was
| on this voyage the offense is alleged to
have been committed.
Captain DlcKman was arrested this after
; noon and held in $1000 bail, but there is
! little likelihood of tbe warrant for Nunez
j being served, as it is more than probable
j he is on his wuy to Cuba on a filibuster
which sailed recently.

formally declared off to-day by President
| James Flint of the Amalgamated Associa

i He siated, however, that the strike has
; not been declared off, and that it will not
j be as long as the men feel as they do at
j present.
