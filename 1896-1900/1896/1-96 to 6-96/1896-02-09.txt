DEBTS OF THE
UNION PACIFIC
Reorganizes Give Their
Views to the Senate
Committee.
MR. ANDERSON'S OFFER.
The Receiver Recommends That
the Government Accept
$35 } 000,000.
HUNTINGTON ALSO APPEAKS,
Says He Used Gold to Build the Central
Line, but Then It Was Cheaper
Than Silver.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. B.â The
Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads
gave another hearing to-day to those in
terested in the settlement of the debt 3of
the Pacific railroads. Among those pres
ent were Collis P. Huntington, president
of the Southern Pacific, W. J. Coombs and
E. Lllery Anderson, Government directors
of the Union Pacific, David H. Littler,
representing the Sioux City and Pacific,
and General t ounsel Pierce of the reor
ganization committee of the Union Pacific.
Senator Wolcott, who had not been
present at the hearing last Saturday when
Mr. Pierce explained the plan of reorgani
zation, closely questioned the latter on the
details and purposes of the reorganization.
The Government in subordinating its
lien to the first mortgage bonds was re
garded as being in the same position as
any other creditor. It it desired to pro
tect its lien it must come forward and do
something. Otherwise the first mortgage
bondholders might, if they wished, fore
close. The reorganization had several
plans of settlement with the Government,
any of which would be acceptable to them,
or they would probably agree to any fair
and just business-like proposition that
might be made by the Government.
Replying to a question relative to the
plan of dealing with the sinking fund,
Mr. Pierce said that fund was treated as
being an amount applicable to the reduc
tion of the debt. The statement of the
debt has been excessive; it amounted, he
tuougiit, to no more than $52,000,000.
'iae friends of both the Vanderbilt and
tÂ»*iou!d interests were represented on
The committee of reorganization. Mr.
Tierce w&p not able to say, of his own
krowledge, whether if the receivers of the
Union Pacific had not diverted the receipts
and earnings they would be able to meet
the interest on the bonds. Receivers were
at times opposed to reorganization
schemes, but in this case he thought the
receivers were favorable to reorganization.
No assistance in the way of legislation, he
asserted, was necessary to foreclose the
lien of the Government.
When asked by Senator Morgan what,
if the road were sold, would become of
the four Government directors, Mr. Pierce
Eaid he thought they woula go out of of
lice, despite the law requiring {heir ap
pointment.
Senator Brice remarked jocularly that
the Government directors would, no
doubt, be sold with the road.
Subsequently Mr. Pierce said, in reply to
Senator Morgan, that he could not reach
the conclusion that further legislation was
indispensable, although further legisla
tion might be desirable. Pierce contended
that as the case now stood he believed
they could foreclose the first mortgage
lien without further legislation, but there
â was no need of foreclosure. The matter
should be settled by an agreement between
the road and the Government.
E. Eilery Anderson, one of the receivers
of the Union Pacific and formerly a Gov
ernment director, favored an adjustment,
but was not prepared, as one of the receiv
ers, to adopt any of the plans proposed
until he had thoroughly investigated the
subject and knew what the best interests
of the Government demanded.
The sale of both roads would, he was
confident, bring less than the principal
and interest of the Government debt and
all prior claims. The Government held a
lien on the Union Pacific, representing a
certain amount of the principal advanced
and unimbursed interest, approximating
$33,000,000, after deducting about fifteen
millions now held as a sinking fund. The
question to be answered was, what was the
Government lien fairly worth? He did
not regard the claims of stockholders as to
any alleged misapplication of funds as en
tering into it, for tne reason that such
claims did not constitute a tangible asset.
Regarding the property of the Union
Pacific itself ns the only source from which
anything was to be expected, there were
two things to be consideredâ the available
value of the property and the amount to
be taken out before the Government could
realize anything. The available value of
the property, Mr. Anderson said, could
not easily be estimated. Much depended
upon commercial and other conditions,
all of which militated against the earning
j '.wer of the Union Pacific. The Union
Pacific property, considered in- various
ways, was worth about 170,000,000. Based
on the value of its stocks and securities it
*as worth about $b7,000,000, to which, if
the preferred stock )a added (the common
stock having no market value) the total
w>in,l be about $92,000,000.
After paying all expenses the earnings
for 1894 amounted to $4,300,000, which
was the average earning capacity of the
road. This represented the interest on an
investment amounting to about $80,000,000.
By any process of valuation of the road
the conclusion was reached that the fair
market value of the Union Paciiic was be
tween 175,000,900 and $80,000,000.
Continuing, Mr. Anderson said that
taking everything out in the shape of a
lien in order to get at the basis of value of
the Government's ciaim he fixed it as be
ing worth between $30,000,000 and $40,
--000, COO. He would recommend that the
Government accept $35,000,000 in cash for
its claim. The Central Pacific and the
The San Francisco Call.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 9, 1896â TWENTY-EIGHT PAGES.
Union Pacific if Bold together would, he
believed, bring more than if they were
sold separately.
An offer of say $65,000,000 for the two
systems was better, he believed, than any
proposition that had been submitted.
The two properties together would make a
splendid system.
In response to a question by Senator
Brice whether the Union Pacific system
was able to earn one year with another 4
per cent on $120,000,000, Mr. Anderson
said that it could just about do it.
''Suppose," said Mr. Brice, "the claim
of the Government :s taken up by some
person or corporation and properly
secured as a first-mortgage lien diawing 3
per cent interest, would it be a pood
proposition for the Government to accept?
Would it be better than $35,000,000 cash?"
"Yes, I believe it would be the better
arrangement," said Mr. Anderson.
"Suppose*" Mr. Brice again asked, "we
make the interest 2 per cent with a fair
sinking fund, the bonds to run 50 or 100
years, how would that compare with the
others?"
Such a bond as that would not be worth
more than two-thirds as much as a 3 per
cent bond.
Mr. Anderson was inclined to think the
acceptance of $35,000,000 would be better
than the acceptance of the 2 per cent bond.
Collis P. Huntin^ton, representing the
Central Pacific, said he expected some
figures from New York that had not ar
rived. He desired to be heard by the com
mittee at some latter date, which request
was granted. Mr. Huntington said that
when he did appear he desired to correct
some statements that misrepresented the
conditions, because they were made by
persons who did not understand the situa
tion.
The bonds of the Central Pacific were
sold, he said, for gold, and gold was used
in building the road. The road had been
successfully operated, and Mr. Huntington
insisted that, if given a chance, it would
ultimately pay its Government debt, dol
lar for dollar.
"Why did you not use silver, Mr. Hunt
ington, in the construction of your road?"
asked Senator Morgan, jokingly.
Before Mr. Huntington had an oppor
tunity to reply Senator Stewart said : "Sil
ver at that time was worth 3 more
than gold, and they used the cheaper
metal."
The hearing then adjourned. The next
hearing will take place on Friday next.
BANQUET OF THE OHIO SOCIETY.
Governor Bushnell Says There Should Be
More Preparation and Less
Talk of War.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 8.-Tne tenth
annual banquet of the Ohio Society was
held to-night at Delmonico's. In point of
number and distinguished guests it was
one of the most successful dinners ever
held by the society.
Governor Bushnell of Ohio and a num
ber of the members of his staff were pres
ent in full uniform. General Burnell,
president of the society, presided.
Governor Buahnell was the speaker of
the evening. Ht referrea to the liberal
subscription to the popular loan, and con
tinuing he said he deeply regretted that a
member of one of the most august bodies
in the world should have spoken disre
spectfully of the highest officer in the Na
tion.
If he had no respect for the Chief Mag
istrate of the Nation, he should have some
fo* % the office.
The way to make a Government re
spected was to stand by it. There had been
recently some talk of war. There should
be more preparation and less talk about it..
Money and ships, not talk, were the re
quisites for war, declared the Governor.

THREE MEN LOOT A BANK
Robbers Make a Successful Raid
in a Small Town in Mis
souri.
One Stands Over the Watchman While
the Other Two Secure the Con
tents of the Safe.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Feb. B.â The most
successful and daring bank robbery that
has occurred in "Western Missouri for a
quarter of a century took place last night
at Savannah, a small town fifteen miles
northeast of this city. Tnree experienced
cracksmen wrecked the safe of the State
Bank of Savannah, secunne $25,000 in
money, Government bonds and postage
stamps.
About 1 o'clock this morning Night
Watchman Jake Garling saw three men
working at the front door of the bank.
He nsked them what they were doing.
One of the robbers, without replying,
knocked Garling down, carried him into
the lobby of the bank and bound and
Dlindfolded him. He then Btood guard
over Garling with a cocked pistol while
the remaining two robbers drilled a hole
in the sale, which was an old-fashioned
affair, and succeeded in unlocking it from
the inside.
At 9 o'clock this morning Bank Presi
dent William R. Wells found Garline in
the condition described. In the meantime
the robbers, to whom there is no clew, had
had plenty of time to make cood their
escape.
Mrs. Mary Breckenridge lost $14,000 in
Government bonds, of which the coupons
for January had not been clipped. The
PoUraaÃter lost $275 in stamps and $250 in
money. Other local depositors lost $10,000.
For twenty-five years Mrs. Breckenridge
had kept the bonds in her house. They
had been deposited in the bank less than a
week.

ALL THE FIGHTS

MEXICO NOW THE SCENE.
Governor Ahuamada Away and
Arrangements Made With
His Successor.
SELLING OF TICKETS EESTTMED.
There Is a Promise That the Pro
gramme Will Be Carried Out on
Schedule Time.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. B.â lndications
to-night are that Dan Stuart will fulfill his
promises and bring oft the fights as billed.
Late this evening the platform on which
the ring is to be staked was taken by teams
to a point a mile below the city, where the
river makes a big bend. It is now thought
it will be moved across into Mexico and
set up at once and that the Mexican
authorities will not interfere with the pro
gramme being carried out.
In addition to this significant act, a
paper, which was drawn up and signed on
the sth inst., was made public this even
ing. It reads:
The undersigned, backers and managers of
the pugilists who are billed to appear during
the carnival to be held near the city of El Paso
from February 14 to 18, after a thorough sur
vey of the ground and information from those
most vitally interested, desire to make the
following statement to the press and public:
"We are satisfied first there is no possible dan
ger of interference In any of the glove con
tests booked. The arrangements are perfect
and the Dattles will be fought to-finishes and
under conditions which preclude all danger of
molestation from any source. Disquieting re
ports from various sections, we are satisfied,
emanated from captious and unreliable
sources. Surely, if we, who have everything
at stake, have been satisfied, there can be little
room for doubt with the general public.
The fights will take place, and those who
contemplate a journey here to witness them
can come on without the least remote misgiv
ing or fears. Martin Julian, for BobFitzhim
mons; .1. J. Quinu. for Peter Maher; Thomas
F. O'Rourke, lor Dixon and Wolcott ; J. Kin
ney, for "Bright Eyes" ; Charles E. Davies, per
T. F. Orr, for Jimmy Barry; J. J. Quinn, for
Jerry Marshall; J. J. Quinn, for Johnny Mur
phy; Hugh P. Kane, for Jack Everhart.
The circular has had tne effect since it
was circulated of satisfying the majority
of the people here that the right will be
pulled off on time. It is reported that
Governor Ahuamada has taken a fifteen
days' layoff, and a great many surmise
that arrangements have been made with
the party who is succeeding him tempora
rily to take no notice of the fight, and that
it will be upon Mexican territory. Others
offer the suggestion that a part of the old
Fort Bliff reservation, having been pur
chased by a sporting man at a recent sale,
might be ground over which there will be
a mooted question.
The platform which' was built so hur
riedly the otner day was carted away this
afternoon to a soot one mile below town.
This gave rise to reports that the fight
would take place to-morrow, but as no
preparations are being made to-night, so
far as can be learned, it looks as though
the management is not intending any
fight before the days announced. Some
have suggested that the island below the
city, where Captain Jones of the Texas
Rangers was killed a few years ago, being
claimed by both the Mexican and United
States Governments, would be a sate place
to have the fight, but Sheriff Silmons says
tiiat it cannot be pulled off there.
The Herald publishes this evening in
its sporting column a statement from Dan
Stuart that he will pay the expenses of
any man who comes to see the fights and
who has the money to pay for the privi
lege if he does not get that which his
money calls for.
Since the circulation of the circular re
ferring to the tights ticket-selling has been
resumed at a rapid rate, and parties who
had purchased tickets and were offering to
sell them for $5 are now confident that the
fights will come off and have withdrawn
their tickets from sale.
Dan Stuart has been in earnest conver
sation with some of the leading lawyers of
El Paso this afternoon, and while he does
not seem in as good humor to-night as
usual, his friends claim that it is simply
for annoyance of minor details. He states
there is no contingency that can arise
which can prevent the fights from coming
off as scheduled. The only thing which
Stuart fears now is that the crowd will not
be as large as expected owing to conflict
ing reports.

FORT SCOTT, Kans., Feb. 8.-J. R.
Colean, who wrecked the State BanK of
this city by stealing $50,000, this even
ing stood trembling and crying before
Judge Simons and was sentenced to
live years in the penitentiary, the maxi
mum penalty for embezzlement. His wife
and her sister, Mrs. McArthur of Jackson
ville, 111., supported his wean body through
the ordeal. After being sentenced Colean
submitted a written statement, the only
one made since his arrest. It was this:
'â¢Judge, I wish to tell yon the truth. I
understand some people believe me to have
means. I state to you such is not the case.
My family and I are absolutely penniless
in the money sense. I have wronged my
friends and family, but I assure you my
intentions were never to wrong any man.
I trust I have done some good in this world
in the past, and should my life be spared I
shall try to improve the future."

BEATEN BY FORAKERITES.
McKinley Men Defeated at a
Meeting of the County
Committee.
Now There Are Charges That Bribes
Were Offered and Loud Talk
of Indictments.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Feb. B.â The
Foraker and McKinley factions came to
gether here tni3 afternoon at the meeting
of the County Republican Central Com
mittee in a sensational manner and the
Forakerites came out victorious.
To-night the McKiniey men were red
hot and Judge Young openly charges a
man who is very close to Governor Bush
nell with trying to buy up committeemen.
The fight was over the election of a chair
man, the two candidates being Sam Wil
kerson, a Forakerite, and Horace Keifer, a
McKinleyite.
The latter is the son of General Keifer,
Governor Bushnell's old political enemy,
and was defeated on the second ballot by a
vote of 20 to 16.
McKinleyites angrily assert that they
will try to secure the indictment by the
Grand Jury of the bribegiver. The real
fight is over the Congressional fight in
this, the Seventh D strict, and election of
delegates to the St. convention.

PROVINCE OF THE RAND.
Plan to Give the Invading Uit

TO COMMAND THE TRANSVAAL.
The Ex-Premier of Cape Colony Will
Represent England as Well at a
Financial Syndicate.
[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Eng., Feb. B.â Something ab
solutely unexpected by any one has hap
pened. Cecil Rhodes, instead of remain
ing and making sport in the gladiatorial
arena with Chamberlain, as all England
took for granted he would do, has merely
had a long talk at the Colonial Office, and
is forthwith hurrying back to South
Africa. A more unlooked-for and puz
zling surprise hardly could be imagined.
At one stroke it throws all the imagined
forecasts out of gear. The chartered com
pany must hold its annual meeting within
a fortnight, and the public has been wait
ins; for the great speech that Rhodes was
to make as the grand opening move in the
campaign between him and Chamberlain,
which was to eclipse everything since the
time of Warren Hastings. It entered into
nobody's head that the battle could be
avoided. Now we are calmly told that the
fight is off, and in men's minas there is
room for only one question, "What does
it mean?"
The coincidence of Mr. Chamberlain's
long and elaborate official statement ap
pearing at the same hour as the news of
Rhodes' swift return has to answer the
question. Means have been found to strike
a balance be-tween the exigencies of Cham
berlain's political career and the colossal
political, financial and social influences
that the chartered company is able to
command in its defense. A compromise
has been arranged and apparently the
scheme adopted, is big enough to afford
ample elbow-room for both Rhodes'
and Chamberlain's ambitions. When two
such predatory genii combine to work to
gether it may be assumed that some third
party is to pay the bill. In this instance
it scarcely needs a prophetic eye to discern
the probability that Kruger and his Boers
are marked for the sacrifice. In other
words, it is plainly open to be feared that
England, having oehaved with scrupulous
correctness up to the present point of the
Transvaal business, is now about to do an
unlovely thing. Perhaps it is manifest
destiny, but it will wear an ugly aspect
non 9 the less.
Chamberlain's lengthy recital of events
from the starting point of Mafeking tells
little that is new. It throws the perfidy of
Jameson's behavior into rather a stronger
light than before and coldly hints that Sir
Hercules Robinson's innocent ignorance
of what was eoing on needs some further
investigation. But the really strong parts
of the document are not reached till he
begins to disclose the policy of the British
Cabinet. England's rights of entire con
trol of the Transvaal's external relations
and its intention to maintain them in
their integrity are affirmed in the plainest
possible language that has been done be
fore; but now, in addition, comes the
statement that England, by geographical
and other considerations, is justified in
tendering its friendly counsels on inter
nal matters also. Then, after a long
narration of the grievances of the Uit
landers, comes what Chamberlain de
scribes as merely a suggestion of one way
of meeting the difficulty, but which will
be read alike in Pretoria and Berlin as a
British ultimatum.
The entire Rand, embracing the whole
mining district, is to be erected into a
serai-autonomous province, with a Legis
lature, Supreme Court, police, educational
system, mining management and so on of
Its own. Plenty of safeguards of the
Transvaal's supremacy In large matters
are suggested, such as the power to veto
and the lite, but, in substance, Chamber
lain proposes to give to the invading Uit
landers on the Rand a rather freer scheme
of home rule than what he broke up the
Liberal party for attempting to secure for
the Irish in their own island.
The announcement that Rhodes on his
return will live In Rhodesia, instead of
Cape Town, may be taken as signifying
that he is to stand on the frontier df the
Transvaal as the representative not merely
as the head of a huge private financial
syndicate, but as the more or less official
representative of England's will that the
Uitlanders be allowed to manage the Rand
in their own way.
That Kruger will accept this solution
without a violent protest, or that his Boers
will not encourage him to resist by force
of arms and appeals for European aid, is
entirely unlikely. One may look with con-
fidence, too. to see Germany foam over
again with exuberance at the vague notion
of blocking England's felinous progress,
but when it comes to reality what can
either Kruger or the Kaiser do? England
is on the ground and holds little Transvaal
as in a thumbscrew. One twist of its giant
hand and the Boers pass into history,
while with its other hand the German
navy and mercantile marine could be
mauled beyond recognition, and so the
British empire goes on being made.
As a rule the week preceding the session
of Parliament is made vocal with specula
tions and rumors about the Queen's
speech. This year nobody displays the
faintest curiosity on the subject. It is
supposed that there will be a request for a
large naval grant, wnich will not be seri
ously resisted, and a clause devoted to ed
ucation. It is said that this latter is the
subject that the Tory leaders have most at
heart, and that it will be put through at
all hazards. Tt is their measure for
strengthening the church's grip on the
schools. Some Irish land legislation must
be introduced, and there will be the usual
gags about agriculture. But, save in the
matters of schools, no one cares much, and
even there the majority is too huge to be
hopefully opposed. Much more fighting
interest attaches to foreign questions, and
to Armenia in particular. There will be a
direct and immediate assault on this point
by Kosebery in the House of Lords, and a
battle between him and Salisbury is ex
pected to claim rirst place in the public at
tention.
It is being whispered to-night among
Tories that Salisbury, whose case seems
so naked to attack in this whole Armen
ian business, had something up his sleeve,
which will show England really strong
where to outward view it seems weakest;
but I hear this is rather in the spirit of
whistling past a graveyard. There can be
no doubt, however, that the Turkish
question and various Continental prob
lems entered with it look much more in
the Parliamentary mind than all the
phases of domestic politics combined.
Sexton's selection to succeed Justin Mc-
Carthy has been a foregone conclusion all
the week. Up to the last advices he was
pretending not to want it, but that is only
pretty Fanny's way. In reality his was
the most utter egotism in the whole vain
boiling, and he has been tnrust into the
post by Healy merely to keep Dillon out.
It is not risking much to predict that his
reign will be both a brief and stormy one.
The French Government is hurrying
forward plans for representation at the
Czar's coronation at Moscow in May,
which will eclipse anything on record in
such matters. It happens that the present
French Embassador in Russia is by
seniority of service the dean of the diplo
matic corps at St. Petersburg,, so he is to
enjoy the right of receiving the young
Czar and Czarina in the name of his col-
leagues when they enter Moscow. He will
do this on a scale of extraordinary mag
nificence, two of the largest noblemen's
palaces in Moscow, rented for the occasion,
being all refitted in the costliest manner
from France. A mile and a quarter of the
costliest carpeting that France can pro
duce is merely one item in the bewildering
outfit. The supper alone, when their
Majesties attend the first ball under the
French roof, is to cost $50,000. Louis XV's
ornate state chariot which so many
Americana have seen at the Musee Cluny,
is to be sent out for the use of the Embas
sador in the procession, with trappings
for horses and liveries for postilions and
footmen oi the same highly monarchial
period; and orders are already placed in
Morocco, Algiers and along the Riviera
for the choicest fruits, vegetables and
flowers that the season will permit, all to
be shipped to Moscow.
This wild ostentation may not improb
ably prove in the nature of a funeral dem
onstration over the corpse of the Franco-
Russian entente. Many signs point to the
conclusion that the Russians are already
tired of the thing. Fewer of their princes
and millionaires are spending their win
ter in France than for years before and
France is Hardly mentioned nowadays in
the Russian papers.
Meanwhile Verestschagiri's new collec
tion of painting", recently moved from
Moscow to St. Petersburg, is attracting ex
ceptional attention at the latter capital.
Their principal feature is a dozen huge
canvases devoted to the Napoleonic inva
sion and retreat of TBl2-13 and they lay
almost malicious stress on the French bru-
tality to the Russian peasants and prison
ers, the French cowardice wnen bravely
opposed, and above all the French sacri
lege in desecrating the Russian churches
and shrines.
When it is remembered that the Russian
official censorship is peculiarly sensitive
and severe on the question of permitting
picture exhibitions, it is not strange that
the French are surprised to rind this show
being allowed at this particular time. Un
less omens fail, they will get much more
direct hints presently when theCronstadt-
Toulon honeymoon is over.
All Germany agrees in attaching deep
importance to the attempt by the Saxon
Ministry to alter the suffrage laws of the
kingdom. At present the suffrage is pretty
nearly universal, the limit' being a fairly
new tax-paying qualification. The meas
ure now proposed by the Government
sweeps away direct voting altogether, and
by statutes instead a sort of electoral col

some one on the floor to respond
to the slightest wish that he may ex
press in regard to considering the
bill at an inopportune time and
enter a vehement objection to its consider
ation before Mr. Huntington's managers
are ready for it. It will remain on the
clerk's desk until they are ready or it
comes up in its regular course.
Gobel recognizes the situation and
knows that ever-watchful eyes are on that
bill and that any motion to call it up
ahead of its time or before his opponents
are ready would bring an "I object" from
Mr. Weissinger, who would go on with his
talk or his work as if objecting to calling
np bills repealing rascally railroad char
ters was as much a part of his daily life
as interposing the same remark in regard
to a question put to a witness in a magis
trate's court, where justice was just thÂ«
thing he did not want, though supposed to
be pleading for it.
Should he happen to be out or otherwise
engaged Mr. Goebel will see the portly and
stately form of Major Thomas H. Hayes
rise in his seat and after fastening the two
lower buttons of his Prince Albert, getting
out his handkerchief and "specs" and
wiping the latter carefully â the Major
never likes to hurry and we]l knows the
value of time when the enemy is paying
for it â say in his deep guttural
tones, very slowly and deliberately:
"Mr. President, I did not catch the
motion made by the gentleman from Cov
ington, sir, quite clearly, and I would like
to understand, sir, just what it is before I
make any further remarks or allow it to
pass."
On the motion being repeated the Major
will take off his "specs," repolish and re
place them, clear his throat and say:
"Well, Mr. President and gentlemen of
NEW TO-DAY.

, Are most competent to fully appreciate the
purity, sweetness, and delicacy of Cuticuba
Soap, and to discover new uses for it daily.
' In the form of washes, solutions, etc., for

the Senate, I desire to enter my objection
to calling up this bill at th's time, because,
sir, it is a matter, sir, in which, as I take
it, the people of Kentucky generally have
little interest. And, besides, sir, we have
many matters-of more urgency and much
nearer concern to which we should devote
our attention," etc., etc.â killing a good
Jialf hour before he gets through.
" The major was not elected to the Senate
solely on account of his perspicuity of
fpeech. It seems as if his long connection
with the Southern Pullman Sleeping Car
Company had made him as pompous as
one of the porters. His long experience in
Legislatures and lobbies gives him some
advantage over Weissinger in handling a
case like this. Though he is not so quick
and vigorous as his colleague he has
better equipoise, and can support a job
with a straight face where Royal's clean
shaved face would hetray the part that he
was not acting just as his better nature
told him was right.
Boyal Weissinger lacks the brass that
Mr. Huntingtou needs just now. He has
the best of advice on the outside, but when
on his feet in the Senate debating this bill
he will not be able to come up to the
mark, because tie is not built that way,
His announcement yesterday that he
wished the record to show that two of the
â¢committee voted against reporting the
bill was not of much consequence, as
everybody knew beforehand that he and
Hays would fight it all along the line, but
as the chairman did not state that the
committee was unanimous on the report
Weissinger's reasons are not quite clear,
unless he wanted the fact published that
two such important members as himself
and Senator Hays were the ones opposing
it, for the sake of the effect on the other
members of the Senate and most of the
House.
His declaration that the railroad would
fieht the passage of the bill over every inch
of the pround might have been spared.
The advocates of the bill, especially Sena
tor Gofcbel, know this well enough, but
they are too wily to be fooled fora moment
as to the kind of a fight Huntington's
men are making.
The show of vehement opposition in the
Senate is not going to throw them off their
guard as to the House, where the other i
party expect to get in their fine work j
while the bill is delayed in the Senate un- '
til they are ready to let it go to the House.
Goebel cut his eye teeth a good many
years aco. He is a man, and a good one,
take him as you will. He is an honest |
and conscientious representative of the
people, and during a long service in the
.Legislature, antedating the passage of the
charter in 1884 some two or three terms,
his record is a clean one. There are no
Colton letters hid away to be brought out
in after years to put his cheek to the i
blush. As a tactician he has no superior â 
in either house, nor do any excel him as a
lawyer and a parliamentarian.
It is indeed a most fortunate thing that
the championship of this bill, which is so
pregnant of future disaster or prosperity
to the people of California, has fallen to
him: and he has able coadjutors. Sena
tors Bronston, Fulton, Sims and Landes,
the members of the committee with him,
are men of high standing and much influ
ence, and they will fight to the last in sup
port of their report. They are all popular,
respected men with their colleagues, irre
spective of party, and will command many
a vote just becr-.use they are interested.
On the other side, Senator Burnett is
well liked by all who know him, is a good
mixer and well posted; but until some
one is elected Senator he will not take any
very active part, as his name has been
mentioned as a possible candidate in case
Hunter cannot be elected, and he is not
going to jeopardize the chance he may
have by antagonizing anybody on the re
peal bill or anything else if he can hel]> it.
Outside his own set Weissinger is not at
all popular among his colleagues, and his
set are very few in number. He is entirely
too exclusive, and that is a thing that the
rural Kentucky legislator does not like,
whether he is dignified with the name of
Senator or is only a mere Representative.
He considers himself a gentleman and is
naturaliy inimical to any one who in the
slightest decree, either directly or in
directly, fails to accord him the privileges
and recognition due him.
Evidently the Huntington people are not
relying on Royal Weissinger to make votes
in the Senate against the bill, but using
him as an objector and delayer. They can
hardly depend much on Senator Hays,
either. Neariy every one in the State
understands his reasons for opposing the
bill and his connection with and obliga
tions to the railroad company. The major
is not exactly a "duke," but he is a little
''tony" and does not really love the
average member.
With General Duke it is tomewhat differ
ent. While he is one ofHhe "kid glove"
fraternity that frequent the Pendenni*
Club he has a recora as a good soldier and
considerate commander; and then he al
ways remembers the boys when they
come to town, calls them by name, shakes
hands and is not afraid of getting hayseed
on his coatâ and this tells with the boys.
Nobody knows the general's power in this
regard better than those who have been
opposed to him.
Weissinger's persistent refusal to sup
port Blackburn will also militate against
his influence. He was elected as a Demo
crat, and as Blackburn is the choice of the
major part of tbe people he represents he
should give him his vote. That he does
dot do so is surprising to many of his best
friends in Louisville. He has, however,
the Bupport of the Courier-Journal* if no
body else, in his causeâ which will help
the cause of repeal.
The "lobbycrs," as they were called to
day, have been on the go all the week,
working hard. They will have additional
help next week. Most of them followed
the members as they scattered to-day after
adjournment until 12 o'clock Monday
next, some going to Lexington, Covington
and Cincinnati, but the greater number
with the larger crowd, which went down
to Louisville.
It is fair to presume that they will not
let any of the country boys get lost be
tween the depot and Sulbach's Hotel and
that "Old Smoothing-iron" will hold spe
cial services at the '-Pandanna" for the
select few that he specially desires to see
personally.
'The okl general knows that he has a
fight on hand.

The treasury will receive in round
figures about $111,000,000. Geographically
considered the bond 3 are distributed in
round figures as follows: New York, $78,
--000,000; New England, $9,000,000; Eastern
States, $5,500,000; -Western States, $3,350,
--000; Central States, $3,000,000: Southern
States, $1,250,000.
It is impossible to give the e*act average
rate at which the bonds awarded were
made, but it was close to 111, at which the
interest realized will be slightly less than
3% per cent. The exact average rate may
not be computed for a week or so by the
treasury officials.
The amount awarded the Morgan syndi
cate is slightly reduced from that stated
yesterday, owing to overlooking two bids,
or rather in not being able with a hurried
examination to discover the exact rate
named. These mistakes reduce the amount
awarded the Morgan syndicate by $32,100,
and make the true amount of bonds the
syndicate receives $33,179,250. There were
781 separate successful bidders, and they
were formally notified to-night by Secre
tary Carlisle of the acceptance of their
bids.

Some of the yew Honda Will Have to Be
Oentroyed.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. B.â An
error has* been discovered in the printing
on the back of some of the new bonds
which wiJl necessitate their destruction
and reprinting. It affects only a few
hundred thousand bonds.
The error consists in having a part of
the back of the new bonds different in
design from the back of the bonds issued
on February 1, 1895. The bonds issued
then were 4 per cent thirty-year bonds,
and those issued now are of the same
issue, being dated February 1, 1895, and
must therefore be identical in all resnects.
To correct the error will cost but little,
and Chief Johnson of the Bureau of En
graving and Printing cays it will not
cause any delay in the delivery of the
bonds.

Financial Papers Aot Impressed by the

LONDOX, Eng., Feb. B.â The Economist
and Statist concur in the opinion that the
new American bond issue will only tem
porarily relieve the treasury, and advise
investors not to be over-confident in a rise
in American stocks. In an interview Mr.
Seligrnan, a member of the well-known
banking-house, said tha*. the success of the
loan ought to increase public confidence in
the future of the United States. Investors
here, he said, have been impressed by the
self-reliance and patriotism of the Ameri
cans, and will be more inclined to hold
American securities.
Baring Brothers are of the opinion that
the American currency laws must be ad
justed before there will ba a permanent
beneficial effect on the treasury.
FIGHT IN PINAR DEL RIO
Engagements in Which the Span
ish Claim to Have Been
Victorious.
General Marin's Forces Sent to the Re
> lief of the Beleaguered
Towns.
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. B.â An engage
ment occurred to-day between a Spanish
column led by Colonel Segueras and an
insurgent force under General Maceo, near
Canuelaria, in the province of Pinar aei
Rio. It is reported that the insurgents
lost eighty killed and many wounded. On
the Spanisn side, Captain Gil is known to
have been wounded. The other losses to
the rebel forces have not been ascertained.
Tbe righting in Pinar province in the
last few days has been the most severe
since the beginning of the war. The con
dition to which the Spanish forces in the
west are reduced has led Marin to abandon
the attempt to force a battle with Gomez,
delay his return to Havana and go to the
relief of the beleaguered towns.
Maceo's forces include the bands of Miro,
Sotomeyer, Delgado, Zayas and Bermudes.
The official government reports give them
a strength of 600, probably much greater.
Combined forces fought a pitched battle
with Lnqae at Paso Real Monday. The
latter reported that the rebels formed in
line of battle and charged tbe Spanish
lines with great valor. Luque claimed a
complete victory and asked for the San
Fernando cross, having remained in com
mand though shot through the leg.
After the fight Luque withdrew his force
to the capital of the province. Wednesday
the same parties of rebels besieged Can
delaria, a railroad town near the Havana
province border. They had apparently
recovered from the battle with Luque.
The volunteers and a small detachment
made a heroic defense of Candelaria for
twenty-six hours.
Marin, who was about leaving Artemisi
for Havana, ordered Canella to the relief
of Candelaria and to attack Maceo.
He took all the available forces and pro
ceeded in person to support Canella. The
latter made a remarkable march, reached
Candelaria, and found the insurgents
swarming in the towns in that vicinity.
The garrison held out though many fell.
The troops of the Simancia and Zamoria
battalions attacked the besiegers, and the
fieht continued two hours. The insur
gents made several machete charges
against Spanish troops. The latter used
artillery. The losses were heavy on both
sides.
The troops finally entered Candelaria
Thursday night. The insurgents moved
west to San Cristobal. Marina column
arrived at Candelaria, and Cane lla fol
lowed Maceo. Another battle is expected.
It is impossible to learn the losses at Can
delaria accurately. The Government says
twenty-six dead insurgents were found on
the field of battle and afterward discov
ered nineteen more. Their own losses are
given as five dead and forty-eight wounded.
The Hudson River ice crop, it is feared,
Will be a failure.
DEMOCRATS SPLIT
ON FREE SILVER
Arguments in the House on
the Substitute for the
Bond Bill.
IS FAVORED BY TOWNE.
The New Member From Minne
sota Creates a Sensation by
His Strong Speech.
POLITICAL ISSUES EEVIVED.
Leaders of the Old Parties Talk Bluntfy
of the Demonetization of the
White Metal.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. B.â There
was a decided sensation in the House to
day. Towne (R.) of Minnesota, a new
member, favoring in the absence of any
other proposition looking to the extended
use of silver the Senate free-coinage sub
stitute for the bond bill passed by the
House, spoke for nearly two hours and
Held the undivided, interested attention of
the House. He manifested an acquaint
ance with the subject of free coinage and
the collateral one of the effect of the de
monetization of silver upon prices and
values that has eelciom been brought into
the discussion and an eloquence which
enabled him to present even the tables of
figures in an attractive way. When he
concluded an ovation was given him that
has not been equaled for a long time in
the House.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio departed from
the beaten path of oratory upon the finan
cial question and made a general political
speech, declaring that whether the Presi
dential election was determined by the
voters at the polls or by the House of Rep
resentatives under the "constitution, the
result would be the choice of the Republi
can convention, and that the silver Sen
ators who had asserted that unless "some
thing was done for silver there would be
no Republican party" represented not
the party, but a faction only.
Other speeches were made during the
day (including the last session of the
parliamentary day of Friday beginning at
10:30 o'clock) by CorliÃ3 (R.) of Michigan,
Boatner (D.) of Louisiana, Evan's (R.) of
Kentucky, McCreary (D.) of Kentucky,
Hepburn (R.)of lowa and Hall (D.) of
Missouri against free coinage of silver, and
by Bartlett (D.) of Georgia and Milner (R.)
of Michigan in favor of it. The House
took a recess at 5:15 o'clock until 8 o'clock,
and will meet again at 10:30 o'clock on
Monday morning to continue the debate
on the pending bill.
Fifteen members responded to Speaker
Reed's suggestion at 10:30 o'clock this
morning that the House come to order for
the third session of the legislative day of
Friday.
Corliss (R.) of Michigan was the first
speaker of the day on the bond silver-coin
age bill. He favored the passage of a bill
to secure international bimetallism by an
agreement with other nations than Great
Britain, and if that could not be accom
plished then to keep out foreign bullion
and coin the American product.
Boatnejs*-(D.) oi Louisiana favored the
coinage of just so much silver as could be
maintained at a parity with gold. Both
gentlemen opposed free coinage of silver.
A little life was thrown into the discus
sion in the course of the remarks of Bart
lett (D.) of Georgia. He asserted that the
victory of the Democratic party in 1892
whs won because of the belief that Demo
cratic success meant the remonetization of
silver and the failure to vindicate that be
lief was responsible for defeat in succeed
ing years. Boatner asked if such shining
lights as Bland and Hatch had been re
pudiated by their people because of their
opinions on the subject of free silver.
Bartlett â Those gentlemen were de
feated because the people were so dis
gusted with the failure of the Democratic
Congress and administration to redeem
the promises of 1892 that 984,000 men who
voted the Democratic ticket in 1892 either
stayed at home in 1894 or voted another
ticket.
Further colloquy ensued regarding the
desirability or expediency from a party
standpoint of prosecuting the free-coinage
idea. Boatner asi:ed Bartlett if that was a
Democratic spectacle now being witnessed
in Kentucky, where the Democracy was
threatened with the loss of a Senator be
cause the silver Democrats were not satia
tied to support the State platform?
Bartlettâ The Democracy is threatened
with the loss of a Senator in Kentucky be
cause a few menâ a small minorityâcan
not control the great majority. [Ap
plause.]
Boatnerâ The situation there but em
phasizes the fact that we should not agi
tate issues as this is the party.
Continuing on the necessity of main
taining party organization Skinner (Pop.)
of North Carolina asked what Bartlett
would do should the Democratic National
Convention nominate a gold candidate for
President on a single-standard platform.
Bartlett â I shall support whoever the
representatives of the mass of the Demo
cratic party sent to Chicago say should be
our standard-bearer. [Applause.] I say
this because I believe that the Democratic
party alone promises to maintain the liber
ties of the people of this country.
Skinnerâ Then the gentleman would
sacrifice the interests of his people and of
the whole country upon the altar of party.
Milner (R.) of Michigan, successor of
Senator Burrows, advocated concurrence
in the free-coinage substitute sent by the
Senate, and at the conclusion of his re
marks, at 12 o'clock, the House adjourned.
It was immediately called to order for the
legislative day of Saturday, and after some
minor business had been transacted the
House in committee of the whole resumed
discussion of the bond silver coinage bill.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio departed from
consideration of the financial features of
the matter to make a general political
speech, taking for his text the plea of the
gentleman from California (Johnson),
"Do something for silver." He said the
offer of the House in tbe bond and reve
nue bills to do something for the whole
people and to provide sufficient revenue
for the needs of the Government was met
by the cry, "Don't do that; do something
for silver." Do something, continued
Grosvenor, for one hundred men â men
constituting the strongest monopoly in the
country.
Referring to the frequent denunciation
of the "crime of 1873" as a piece of secret
legislation, Grosvenor said that any man
who made such a statement when the
Congressional Record contained sixty
columns of debate on the subject ought to
go home and never come back.
Grosvenor read from the declaration
signed by a number of Senators and
printed to-day, to the effect that unless
something was done for silver there would
be no Republican party. From this he
went on to the question of the probable re
sult of the Presidential election in 1896 to
demonstrate the truth of the statement
that whether the contest was deoided at
the polls or by the House of Representa
tives it would result in the selection of the
Republican candidate. Pennsylvania, one
of whose Senator* sigiwd this declaration,
Grosvenor said, was "represented by noth
ing, absolutely nothing." In conclusion,
Grosvenor warned Republicans against
voting for the free-coinage substitute.
Evans (R.) of Kentucky spoke against
the Senate substitute, and was followed by
McCreary (D.) of Kentucky, who referred
with pride to the large number of bidders
for the new bond issue, but regretted that
a nation like ours should be forced by un
wise and vicious laws to offer its bonds for
sale when Congress was in session and
ready to give relief. He asserted that the
Democrats were not responsible for the ex
isting financial condition. He preaicted
that if the Republican party continued the
course it had followed for the past two
months there might be a repetition at the
next election of what followed the session
of the Fifty-first Congress. He showed
that during the period from 1870 to 1896,
when the free coinage of silver was sus
pended, property valuations had increased
from $30,000,000,000 to $65,000,000,000.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa denied McCreary's
assertion that the Republican party bad
demonetized silver.
Towne (R.) of Minnesota discussed and
defined the term bimetallism and said any
man who did not agree that it meant that
both gold and silver should be admitted to
the min^s, and of equal value, at the option
of the debtor, in the discharge of his obli
gations, should have the courage of nis
convictions and stand up and be counted
as a single cold-standard man. [Ap
plause.]
The compliment of half an hours addi
tional time was paid Towne, which he oc
cupied in an eloquent discussion of values
and prices as affected by the operations of
the single gold standard.
Hall (D.) of Missouri spoke against the
free coinage of silver. He was asked by
Talbert (D.) of South Carolina if he had
not voted in the Fifry-third Congress for
free and unlimited coinage.
Hallâ l reply yes. But the difference
between the gentleman and myself is that
I have progressed some since then, while
he is standing still where I was then.
[Laughter.]
Hall referred to several illustrious ex
amples of a change of mind, among them
that of Speaker Reed, of whom he said:
"History will write him down, when the
clamor of partisan has been hushed, as the
greatest pioneer in the development of
parliamentary law the world has ever seen.
I never criticized nor condemned his action
regarding the counting of a quorum and
never expect to, because I believed it to be
exactly right."
In concluding Hall asserted that the un
limited free coinage of silver at the ratio
of 16 to 1 was not a Democratic doctrine,
the only party which liad declared for it
being the Populists.
The House at 5:15 took a recess until 8
o'clock, with the understanding that an
other recess would be taken until 10:30
o'clock Monday morning.
The Representatives who gathered in,
the hall of the House in the evening to
hear and participate in the debate on the
bond Bilver coinage bill could be counted
on one's fingers. Phillips (R.) of Penn
sylvania, Colson (R.) of Kentucky and
Wanger (R.) of Pennsylvania opposed free
coinage, and Talbert (D.) of South Caro
lina advocated it.
At 9:20, there being no one else desiring
to speak, the House took a recess until
10:30 o'clock Monday morning.
TREATMENT OF HAMMOND
It Was Investigated at the Re

Making a Speech in Favor

fcORTON FRIENDLY TO ALLISON.

NEW YORK, X. V., Feb. B.â Politicians
are wondering whether Thomas H. Carter,
Senator from Montana and Chairman of
the Republican National Committee, will
manage the next Presidential campaign
for the Republican Bide. It is hinted that
he wishes to do so in order to vindicate
himself for the disaster of 1Â«92. He may
be allowed to manage the campaign, the
politicians say, if the "combine," as the
organization of bosses is known, does not
nominate its man at St. Louis. In that
case Senator Quay of Pennsylvania will
probably assume control of the campaign.
On the other side, there is no doubt that
William F. Harrity will be calied again to
run the campaign for the Democrats. Mr.
Harrity, it is understood, will have prac
tically no opposition for the honor of con
ducting the campaign, which promises to
be a losing one.
Ex-Governor and Senator-elect Joseph
B. Foraker of Ohio will not attend the
Ohio Society dinner to-night, saying that
he was confined to his home with ton

that his illness is merely an excuse as he
wishes to miking a speech" in
favor of McKinley. He is not friendly to
McKinley, and while he will not oppose
him he does not wish to actually support
him. McKinley also has declined to at
tend the dinner, because he does not care
to make a speech at the present time.
Governor Morton is more friendly to
Senator Allison than to either Speaker
Reed or ex-Governor McKinley, or any
other man who has been put into the field
as a candidate for the Presidency.
Senator Allison is said to have refused to
allow his supporters to invade this State,
establish headquarters and begin a cam
paign which should be an annex to his
lowa "boom." Governor Morton has been
advised of this, and is said to have re
turned the compliment by indicating that
he thought Reed and McKinley territory
offered the best field for operation io the
work of developing strength for himself.
Morton's friends are wondering whether
Allison would accept second place on the
ticket.
Sarah Bernhardt appeared last night as
the heroine in Suderman's play, "Hei
niath," which she gave in French at Ab
bey's Theater under the name of "Magda."
Her performance was a remarkably clever
one, as facile and expert a piece of worn as
her fine technical skill and finish made a
certainty.
But it is fair to say that if Mme. Bern
hardt had never played any other role
than Magda her fame would not be as
great as it 4s to-day. It is not a part, in
the first place, suited to her temperament
nor her personality, and the personality of
the French actress is notoriously the
dominating feature of every play in which
she appears. "Magda" is not a play of
any engrossing moments. It is a study of
German life and character and the role of
Magda is an inherent part of it, playing no
such figure in the development of the story
as do the other parts in which Mme. Bern
hard t usually acts.
If Mme. Bernbardt failed to fit her per
sonality into the role her method of play
ing it was just as fatal to any sincere, con
vincing impression. There were moments
in the play â notably in the interview with
her father in the third act, and in the
scene with her impertinent visitors â when
her acting: was truthful and genuinely ef
fective, But there were few such elements
in her performance.
It was brilliant in the theatrical way, of
which she is such a past mistress. But in
the great scenes of the play â the interview
with her old lover, the scene with the
pastor, and the final dialogue with her
father, just as the play closesâ the emotion
was insincere, its expression artificial, and
tthere was never for a moment any illusion
of reality and suffering.
In marked contrast to these unsatisfac
tory qualities of her performance was her
acting at the close of the third act, when,
in obedience to her father's command, she
follows him into her room to confess her
sin. This was one of the few natural and
moving elements of her work.
Melba in "Lucia" and Calve in "Caval
leria Rusticana" drew a laree and brilliant
audience to the Metropolitan Opera-house
last night that liked the strains of Doni
zetta's opera, for almost every number was
applauded, and the delight of hearing the
threadbare, though tuneful airs and their
otchestratiou was visible on the coun
tenances all over the house.
Every turfman in town was grieved to
hear of the death of Colonel W. P. Thomp

unostentatious in his practice, and every

not respect him.
Coionel Thompson made his entries to
the diiferent stakes under the name of the
Brookdale stable, which was registered as
Colonel William P. Thompson & Sons, so
that the entries hold good.

WJZLIA'O TO RELEASE WAZZBR.
.French Staf**mcn Would Kike to Haw
Indemnity Waived.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. B.â A Sun
special from Washington' says: The Wal
ler correspondence, called for several weeks
ago by the Senate, has been declared, when
it is sent in, a conclusion of the case,
which has now been pending before the
State Department for six months. The
administration has abandoned all hope of
securing the testimony presented during
the court-martial proceedings in Madagas
car, and without this it is believed that it
would be impossible to substantiate any
good ground for demanding the indemnity
insisted UDon by Waller, and but for
which he could have been released weeks
igo.
Embassador Eustia, however, has had
access to part of the proceedings, and on
his report it is understood that the de
partment will inform the French Govern
ment tnat it will accept Waller's uncon
ditional release and waive any rights it
might have to any indemnity claim. Wal
ler's friends in this country, and more
especially his wife, have been urging him
to hold out and not accept a release, which
France offered out of courtesy to the
United States some time aco, believing
that eventually his claim would be estab
lished and an indemnity demanded.
The efforts of the department in Wal
ler's behalf are said to have been par
ticularly vigorous since last autumn, and
but for the firm request of the administra
tion to learn what actually occurred at the
court, it is questionable if Mr. Eustis
would have been permitted to have con
sulted them at aiJ. The correspondence)
regarding the case is very voluminous, and
covers the whole affair from the time it
was taken by Mr. Gresham until thÂ«* last
communication received from abroad.

THE WHEELMEN.
Importance of the National
Assembly to Be Held at
Baltimore.
3ROWTH OF THE LEAGUE
Various Knotty Problems That
Require an Immediate
Solution.
MANY SCHEMES ARE ADVANCED.
Not the Least Important Will Be
Advocacy of Good Roads
Everywhere.
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 8.-only ten
States in the country will be unrepresented
at the National Assembly of the L. A. W.,
which opens its session here next Monday.
The convention promises to go down in
cycling history as the most momentous
ever held. More knotty problems that re
quire immediate solution will come up
than have heretofore fallen to the province
of a National assembly of wheelmen.
Seventy-four amendments to the constitu
tion are down for consideration.
This remarkable condition is due to the
fact that the league has grown so im
mensely in membership within a recent
period that the present system of govern
ment has become cumbersome. All kinds
of schemes are advocated to simplify the
conditions. With the arrival of the van
guard of the delegates last night and to
day. league politics began to boom, and
will continue to grow in importance until
the officers are elected nextW'ednesday.
President Willison is on hand and ex
presses unlimited confidence in his re
election. His strongest antagonist is Ster
ling Elliott of Massachusetts. The fact
that two other names are being talked of
in connection with the presidency has
given rise to the supposition that Elliott's
followers fear his connection with the of
ficial Bulletin of the L. A. W. has resulted
in bringing forth strong opposition to his
candidacy.
The two outside choices in the race are
Cossum of Poughkeepsie, K. V., and Mor
rison of Illinois. The racing question can
not enter into the contest as between Wil-
Jison and Elliott, as both candidates sup
port racing under the jurisdiction of the
league. One hundred and ninety-two per
sons are eligible to cast ballots, but it is
not expected that more than 150 will be
deposited.
The assembly will practically be started
by a meeting of the racing board to-mor
row afternoon. This board has autocratic
powers over all who race on bicycles. The
chief business to be considered at to-mor
row's meeting will be in regard to reopen
ing the Titus-Murpby-Cabanne case. The
suspended riders will be represented by at
torneys. There appears to be a sentiment
among the members of the board in favor
of reinstating at least two of the men.
Monday will be given up to talks on good
roads and at night a banquet will be given
to 650 persons. Chief Counsel Sams went
to Washington to-day to secure the ac
ceptance of invitations by Speaker Reed,
Senators Gorman, Hill, Gibson and others.
Short addresses will be made on the high
way improvement association.
The real business of the assembly will
begin Tuesday. One of the most widely
discussed amendments to the constitution
which will be considered is the anti-racing
proposition of Chief Counsel Potter of
New York, in which it is proposed that the
league relinquish control of cycle racing
and turn it over to an organization com
po?ed of the chief counsels of all State
divisions having membership of 1000 and
over, this body to select its own chairman.
The defeat of Mr. Potter's idea is antici
pated. Failing to convince the assembly
that his views on the racing question
Bhould prevail, Mr. Potter undoubtedly
wili make an effective tight against the
continuation of class B.
Chairman Gideon of the racing board,
will move to amend the rules in such a
manner that a class B rider will no longer
be called an amateur, but simply a class B
rider. The value of prizes for class B is
â¢Iso cut down from $150 to $100, and that of
class A from $50 to s3s. Should tue recom
mendation of Chief Counsel Jacquish of
Illinois prevail, the anti-negro clause will
be effaced.
The place for holding the annual meet of
the L. A. W. will also be decided by the
assembly, and the fight has narrowed down
to the cities of Toledo and Louisville.
PEARL BRYAN'S MURDER
The Police Working Hard on
the Clews They Have
Obtained.
Mysterious Letter Written by Scott
Jackson to William F.
Wood.
GREENCASTLE, Ind., Feb. B.â Marshal
Starr this afternoon notified William
Wood, who is believed to be concerned in
the murder of Pearl Bryan, to leave town
before night. Wood lost no time, and left
on an afternoon train with his father and
mother. A lynching to-night was immi
nent.
CINCINNATI. Ohio, Feb. B. âThe police
are working hard on the Pearl Bryan case,
and although nothing of a sensational
nature was brought to light today 'beyond
the letter from Jactson to Wood, they
will continue to follow each clew got
from the suspected men, Jackson and
Walling.
The efforts of tho officers of the depart
ment to-day were concentrated on the
search for the cab in which Pearl Bryan
was driven to her destruction. It was as
certained that two men called on the Met
ropolitan Cab Company a week ago Thurs
day and asked for a cab without a driver.
He explained the reason for not wanting a
driverâ because there would be three in
the party and that but two could ride in
the cab. Mr. Baker, who hired them the
cab, was taken to the cellroom and took a
good look at both men. While he waa not
certam, he believes Jackson was the man
who acted as spokesman and that Walling.
was his companion. Both the prisoners
deny this.
A gang of men from the city street
cleaning department is searching the sew
ers of the West End, hoping to find the
missing head.
The doctors ridicule the confession of
Walling that Pearl Bryan met her death
by a quick poison. To professional eyes
the condition of the body indicates that
she died by the knife and that she was
conscious when killed.
J. D. Scott, a student at the dental col
lege and a friend of Jackson and Walling,
is being looked for by the police. He is in
no way implicated in the murder, but the
detectives believe he may have been a con
fidant of the two men nnder arrest and
may be able to eive some valuable infor
mation concerning their movements.
This afternoon Mayor Caldwell received
the following letter, written by Scott Jack
son to WiUisaa F. Wood, Miss .Bryan's ad
mirer at South Bend. End., but which had
been remailed to the Mayor by the post
master at that place.
Hello BUI: Write a letter home signed by
Ben's name, telling the folks he is somewhere,
and going to Chicago, or some other placeâ has
a position, etc., etc.â ana that they will be ad
vised later about it. Say tired of living at
home or anything you want. You know about
the way he writes.
Send it to some one you cnn trustâ how will
Smith at Lafayette do? Tell the folks he has
not been at 1., but at Lafayette, and traveling
about the country. Get the letter off without
one second's delay, and burn this at once.
Stick by your old chum, Bill, and I will help
you out the same way or some other Way some
time. Am glad you are having a good time.
Be careful what you write to me.
Jackson admitted this afternoon that
Bert in the letter means Pearl.
"Now, why did you write that letter?"
"Walling told me to write it. He said
that something had to be done and I did it."
SALVATION ARMY ORDER
The United States to Lose Com
mander and Mrs. Balling
ton Booth.
Part of a General Change of Territorial
Officers Throughout the
World.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 8.-Comman
der and Mrs. Ballington Booth, who are
preparing to take their leave of the Salva
tion Army in the United States, in ooe
dience to the order of General Booth, have
issued in the War Cry a formal letter of
farewell, addressed to their "brave and be
loved comrades."
The leaders expross regret that the news
of the commander-in-chief's order to them
to relinquish the command of the army
here should have reached the officers and
soldiers first in the form of a rumor and
then through the newspaper press, when
it would have been fitting that a great
council should have been called and the
information made known there or through
the War Cry.
The commander and his wife state that
the order was a surprise to them, but they
say that since receiving it they have
learned that their orders "to farewell" are
only a part of a general change of terri
torial commanders throughout the world.
They urge obedience to the commander
in-chief's order by all of .the army in
America, and that the work here so suc
cessfully begun be pushed on. The Salva
tionists are bidden to hold up the flag and
retain the confidence of the people.
"Fight on, dear comrades," the letter
concludes, "sin^ on, dear soldiers; march
on, dear warriors, and may the cross be
your victorious emblem, and the love of
God be the inspiration of your hearts.
Think of us ever as your loving and de
voted old leaders for God and his warfare."
CAUCVS OF POPULIbTS.
Will Vote for Their Own Officer* for the
Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 8.-The
Populists held a caucus this afternoon to
agree upon their policy with reference to
the reorganization of the elective officers
of the Senate. Ex-Representative Thomas
Watson of Georgia was nominated for Sec
retary of the Senate and H. C. Taubeneck
of this city for Sergeant-at-Arms.
It was decided that the Populist vote
should be cast for these candidates with
the understanding that the agreement was
to be binding unless otherwise ordered by
a Populist caucus.
If this is carried out the Republicans
will not have a plurality of the votes cast
and cannot elect the ticket named yester
day, but it is claimed by the Republicans
that ultimately the Populists will decline
to vote and leave the situation as it was
when the Republicans reorganized the
committees.
Nothing was done to-day to change the
previous decision of the Populists to vote
solidly against Mr. Quay's motion to re
commit the tariff bili.
HAMLIIf IS AMUSED.
-Yot Worried About the Story of His Zm-
peachmrnl.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 8.-Assist
ant Secretary Hamlin of the treasury was
surprised when informed this morning
that San Francisco advices had it that he
was to be impeached by Congress for
meddling wiih the court-martial proceed
ings against Captain Healv of the revenue
cutter service, on trial at San Francisco.
He said it was the first he had heard of the
matter.
The Assistant Swiretary, whose position
is held simply at tne volition of Secretary
Carlisle and "the President, is naturally
somewhat amused by the intimation that
his purely clerical official action in regard
to the Healy court-martial should have
rendered him liable to impeachment by
the House of Representatives and convic
tion by the Senate of "treason, bribery and
other high crimes and misdemeanors,"
under article 11, section 4, of the constitu
tion of the United States.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
IN BEHALF OF
BIMETALLISM.
German Statesmen Are Not
Satisfied With Yon
Hohenlohe.
FAILS ON A CONFERENCE
An Endeavor Not Made to Enlist
Powers Independent of
England.
COUNT YON MIRBACH'S VIEWS.
This Country May Be Obliged to Resort
to the Exclusive Free Coinage
of Silver.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. B.â The an
nouncement made by Chancellor yon
Hohenlohe in the Reichstag to-day that
the Bnndesrath had declined to approve
the idea of holding a monetary conference,
in view of the fact that the invitations
sent to the Federal States asking an ex
pression of opinion in regard to holding
such a conference had had a negative re
sult, ha-s altogether failed to satisfy the bi
metallists in the Reichstag, and the Chan
cellor's statement has been the subject of a
good deal of comment, ana does not win
the approval of the ch3riiber. The talk
which it has occasioned in the lobbies has
disclosed the fact that one cause of discon
tent is the neglect on the part of the Gov
ernment to endeavor to get the pow.ers in
dependent of England to join in the pro
posed conference.
Prince Hohenlohe's other statement,
that the Bundesrath had disapproved the
proposal toissue invitations to the powers
to join in a conference because the pour
parlers with England had proven abortive,
is held to be a very insufficient reason for
the cessation of overtures in the direction
of a conference to the other powers. In
asmuch as the opposition of England to a
monetary conference is deemed certain,
the bimetallists are convinced that the
whole action of Prince Hohenlohe in the
matter has been a pure evasion. If the
Chancellor had Deen really earnest in ful
filling his pledge he would, the bimetal
lists assert, have pushed the question to a
decision Dy all of the states comprising
the Latin Monetary Union, and relied
upon them for adhesion with America to
get the question of international currency
again discussed. The sum of the truth is
that Prince Hohenlohe has never mooted
the question of a monetary conference to
the powers beyond sounding England upon
the subject.
Count yon Mirbach, the leader of the
bimetallists in the Reichstag, has just
issued a pronunciamento in which he de
clares that if the system of bimetallic
currency is not achieved the United States
will be ultimately obliged to resort to ex
clusive free coinage of silver. The docu
ment then proceeds to predict that this
will make imports into America from gold
currency countries in Europe impossible
and also secure for American exports pre
miums of nearly 50 per cent, securing the
parity of American currency with that of
the silver paying countries, and thus ob
tain for tbe United States a monopoly of
the dealings with those countries. Outside
of the circle of bimetallists Count yon Mir
bach's assertion in the matter has no
weight; still the Reichstag, as a whole, is
in sympathy with bimetallism and is dis
appointed with the Chancellor's state
ment, a majority of the Deputies being of
the belief that Prince Hohenlohe oucht to
have made a more genuine effort to bring
about a conference.
The special committee of twenty-one to
which the new civil code has been re
ferred has a long life before it as well as a
busy one. The Conservative and Reichs
partei members of the Reichstag opposed
the reference of the code to the committee,
while the Centerists, Poles and Socialists
voted against the proposal giving the com
mittee power to accept certain sections of
the bill en bloc without debate. The Na
tional Liberals, Free Conservatives, Frei
sinniges' and Vereinigungs favored and
accepted the bill almost as a whole.
Though the measure is of the highest im
portance, the Reichstag throughout the
four days' discussion prior to the reference
of the bill to the committee rarely con
tained more than a hundred members.
The party objection may be summed up
something like this: The Conservatives
and Centerists oppose the provision of the
measure dealing with divorce, and the
Centerists are especially opposed to the
civil marriage clause.
The Socialists are of the opinion that the
code was conceived for the purpose of
maintaining the existing social structure
and leaving the popular grievances un
touched, contending that the measures
give the employers a powerful advantage
of the working people. What the code
will be like when it has been subjected to
the amendments with which it is threat
ened, it will be futile to predict.
Baron yon Hohlenberg, in the course of
the discussion of the bill in the Reichstag,
voiced the honest sentiment of a consider
able section of the house by a declaration
denying the necessity for the unification
of law of Germany and deploring the
tendency toward excessive centralization,
which was menacing the federal states.
The Government of the kingdom of
Saxony has struck the first blow which has
long been dreaded by the Freissinnigs
and Socialists, against popular suffrage.
A franchise bill has been introduced into
tÂ£e Saxon Diet, whicn proposes to abolish
the electoral system at present in operation
and substitute therefore the Prussian
system of indirect election in classes. The
first of these classes comprises voters who
have an income of 10,000 marks a year and
upward, the second composed of those
having incomes of not less than 2,800
marks a year and the third made up of
rate payers, each class electing one-third
of a college of electors, which college se
lects the deputies composing the Landtag.
The result of the operation of this sys
tem in Saxony will be that the workmen
and ratepayers, all in the third class, will
be outvoted in the college of electors two
to one, and consequently will have no
representatives in the Landtag at all. The
bill is recognized by all parties as a step
toward the restriction of universal suffrage.
Jfrince Bismarck has congratulated the
Saxon Government upon its introduction
of the bill, and Herr Liebknecht and other
Socialist leaders are stumping Saxony in
opposition to it.
The obvious tension between the court
and many members of the higher nobility
as evidenced by the withdrawal from Ber
lin within a recent period of a number of
the leaders of society, is creating a good
deal of talk, much of which would not be
at all pleasant for the Emperor to hear.
While these personages are leaving Ber
lin, however, it is noted that Prince Fred
erick Leopold of Prussia and his wife,
Princess Louise Sophie, sister of the Em
press, who were announced to leave Berlin
some time ago owing to the quarrel be
tween the Prince and Emperor, which re
sulted in the confinement of the Prince in
the fortress of his castle ior a fortnight,
have not yet taken their departure. It is
understood that they are detained in Ber
lin because the Emperor has not seen fit
to allow them to leave.
The body of the late Embas9ador, Hon.
Theodore Runyon, will be accompanied to
New York by Mrs. Haskins, his daughter.
Mrs. Runyon and her unmarried daugh
ters will not sail for their American home
until May.

Continued from First Page.
leee chooses members of the Diet. This
college is to be elected one-third by citi
zens enjoying an income of $2500 or over,
one-third by the class with incomes not
less than $700, and the remaining third by
those under that figure who have votes.
This will insure that the working and
small trading classes will never be able to
name more than a fraction of the electors,
and, of course, they will get no members
in the Diet at all. It is avowedly aimed at
the Socialists, who are now fourteen in the
Saxon Diet out of a total of eighty-two.
If the bill becomes a iaw in Saxony it is
assumed that it will be extended to other
states, while Prussia already has some
thing equally plutocratic. This outlook
obviously threatens the whole principle of
imperial universal suffrage, and it is ex
citing alarm in all liberal quarters. Even
Bismarck is advising against it, but the
current of absolutism is running so strong
just now that hardly even he could stem
it.
Meanwhile new personal altercations
and alienations in the inner imperial cir
cles are constantly occupying the gossips
of Berlin. Prince Albert of Saxe-Alten
burg has given up his Berlin palace, and
settled with his family on his Schwerin es
tate.
Through a quarrel with the Emperor
more serious still, the Kaiser's remote
Catholic cousin, Prince Frederick of Ho
henzollern, brother to the King of Ron
mania and one of the most prominent mil
itary figures in Prussia, has thrown up his
command of the Third Army Corps in dis
gust and quitted the capital for good to live
in Bavaria. Lists are being published of
other Princes of great feudal families, like
Stolberg. Wernigorode. Katibor, Plesses
and many others n .vho since the present
reign have turned their backs on Berlin
for the same cause, namely, their unwilling
ness to eat dirt.
The incorporated Authors' Society is to
have it? annual general meeting a week
from Monday, and the literary atmos
phere is alive with rumors of tremendous
things there are to be done.
An author named W. H. Wilkins, whose
name, I confess, is unknown to me in
connection with books, but who writes
with distingtiisned fluency and fervor in
the correspondence columns of newspa
pers, is to move a repudiation of the re
cent authors' address on the Venezuelan
difficulty, and what practically amounts
to a vote of censure on the officers who
allowed the society to seem responsible
lor it. They say he has drummed up a
lot of tupport for his motions, but when
it comes to actual test, I fancy that the
knights, backed by those who expect to be
knights, will not have much difficulty in
putting the temerarious Wilkins down.
Speaking of knights, I hear that Rider
Haggard is to have a "Sir" put before his
name during the year following.
Despite professions of the academy's
calm here, a really earnest scuffle is pro
ceeding inside the Royal Academy as to
Leighton's successor. All the papers were
supplied early in the week with a para
graph expressing the academy's profound
regret that the state of Sir J ohn Millais'
health would not enable him to accept the
post, which otherwise would be his by ac
clamation, but Miilais promptly had his
physicians to publish a round-robin de
claring that his health was perfect, wÂ«th
the trivial exception of a sort of wart in
his throat, which they will be ablÂ» to
abate in no time. There is now sent out a
feeler in the shape of a hint that Millais
may be prevailed upon to accept the office
till, at least, the close of the year, but
there is no sign that he will consent to en
ter into a bargain of that humiliating na
ture. As there is ho rule concerning the
time of filling the post the date of the elec
tion is still in the air, but the academy
meets February 29 for the choice of three
new associates, among whom Shannon is
almost certain to be one, and after that it
will be easier to get the notion into shape
of canvassing for Leighton's shoes.
Only one or two papers have thought it
worth while to print Austin's poem on
Prince Henry of Batten berg in its entirety,
and many do not give the smallest extract
from it. Such editorial allusions to it as
are made are at best cautiously non-com
mittal, and for the most part frankly con
temptuous. His tragedy on Alfred, en
titled "England's Darling," has no polite
treatment, however, in any quarter. It is
guyed from one end of the island to the
other, and even his own Standard opens
its columns to a lone series of corre
spondents, showing that when he said
that Alfred had been neglected by the
English poets tie was ridiculously ignorant
of the facts.
A good deal had been expected of the
memoirs of Due do Persigny, published in
Pans yesterday, but the result is described
as extremely disappointing. There is not
a word in them about the coup d'etat, and
except for somewhat interesting personal
glimpses of Bismarck, there is little of
value to the student of the second empire
and its tiroes.
The memoirs of Bernadotte are creating
much greater interest in Paris, where it is
reported without contradiction that their
anonymous editor is really King Oscar II
of Sweden. Harold Frederic.
Germany and Silver.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. B.â ln the
Reichstag to-day Prince Hohenlohe. Im
perial Chancellor, made the admission
that the vacillations in the price of silver
had somewhat injured the trade of Ger
many. As the invitation of the Govern
ment to the general States to express their
opinions in regard to the proposed mone
tary conference had had a negative result,
he said the Bundesrath had declined to
give its approval to summoning a confer
ence. If, however, a sound basis should
be presented later, he would reconsider the
matter, and take such steps in the direc
tion of holding a conference as were pos
sible under the circumstances.

BETRAYAL OF A
WOODLAND GIRL
Pitiful Story Told by Mary
Higgins Before Her
Death.
DUPED BY A DECEIVER.
Her Marriage to D. A. Lancaster
Found to Have Been a
Mockery.
SHE DIES IN AN INFIRMARY.
Relatives Will Endeavor to Have
Justice Meted to the Man Who
Blighted Her Life. '
WOODLAND. Cal., Feb. B.â The death
of Mary Higgins. a young woman, at the
County Infirmary this afternoon, dis
closes a pathetic story of betrayal as the
result of a mocK marriage. While in
Woodland she met D. A. Lancaster, an in
surance agent, and shortly afterward they
met again at the Arlington Hotel at
Suisun.
The statement made by the woman
sbortly before her death was that Lan
caster induced her to go to San Francisco,
where a marriage ceremony was per
formed, but there is no record of the mar
riage, the date or the officiating minister.
She stated that Lancaster had insisted
that she should return to Woodland and
keep their marriage a secret until such
time as his financial circumstances im
proved so that he could proclaim her to
the world as his wife. This was over a
year ago, and since then she has been un
able to learn of his whereabouts. The
woman became a mother a few hours be
fore her death.
A brother and sister of Mary Higgins,
who reside in Suisun, have been notified,
and are already instituting a search for
Lancaster.
fAIR XAMCH THREATEXETK
Water Enrroaeliiitg Upon Six Thou-
Aanti Acres of (trowing Grain.
WOODLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â The Fair
ranch, of over GOOD acres of healthy young
grajfl", is in imminent danger of an over
flow. Water is within a few inches of
being on a level with the back leyee, and
ifl gradually rising. It is the wind and
waves that are threatening the great ranch.
None of this flood water is from the river.
It was all emptied into the Colusa and
Northern Yolo basin from the streams that
find their source in the mountains an-i
foothills to the west. This water has
already submerged the fertile body of
15,000 acres of land that has heretofore
been protected by the Howe 11 Point levee.
With the increase ill volume and a high
north wind, it naturally moves southward.
If the levee breaks, and there now seems
to be no possible way of averting the dis
aster, all hopes of a crop for this season
on a greater part of die ranch will be
destroyed, as the water will remain on the
land for several weeks. Sycamore Slough
affords the only means of draining it, and
the present stage of the river precludes
the possibility of making that means
available. Several hundreds of acres are
already covered by water. The outlook
now is that the crops on this tract are
doomed.
CASSEj.3TA\ CEXSVItED.
The Supervisor Declared to Have De-
frauded Xolo County.
WOODLAND, Cat.., Feb. B.â Supervisor
Casselman was severely censured by the
Grand Jury, which submitted its report
this afternoon, as follows:
The minority of the Grand Jury, ui>on the
question of the investigation of "the* official
conduct of E. Casselmau, beg leave to report as
follows'
We find that Mr. Oasselman. for the purpose
of procuring the payment of claims that w re
illegal and not entitled to payment at all out
of the county treasury of Yoio County, falsely
and fraudulently, and with the intention of
procuring them to be falsely and fraudulently
paid, falsified not only the items of the said
claims, but falsified the verification thereto;
that is to say, Mr. Casselman, in Ihe case of
the McGregor claim, procured Mr. McGregor's
signature and sworn to by him; that Mr. Cas
selman then filled out the'items of such claim
and falsified the dates of such Items, so that
the claim would appear on its face to be fair
and would be allowfid and paid out of the
county treasury.
The other claims mentioned by tne majority
report here are in a similar situation, and a
similar allepation by this minority as to them
would be true. We are, therefore, of the opin
ion that Mr. Casselman palpably violated sec
tion 72 of the Penal Code of this State.
AFTER TULARE OFFICIALS
Assessor Gibson and District
Attorney Howard Scored by
the Grand Jury.
Useless Expense Said to Have Been
Incurred and the Law
Violated.
VISALIA, Cal., Feb. B. âThe Grand Jury
impaneled last Monday filed its report
tbis afternoon. Concerning Assessor Gib
son the report says:
"Upon an examination of the books and
statements in the Assessor's office we find
that the Assessor received statements from
certain individuals of personal property,
which statements he failed to enter upon
his books. As we understand the law, it is
the duty of the Assessor to enter upon his
assessment-roll a statement of all the per
sonal property of the county, and he is
guilty of at least a. technical violation of
the law in not entering these statements
upon his boyks."
Relative to District Attorney Frank B.
Howard the report
"We lind that the county has been en
gaged in considerable litigation during the
past year; that considerable money has
been expended in the employment of out
side counsel. If it is necessary for the
District Attorney to have deputies, we rec
ommend that be employ as his chief dep
uty a lawyer and a man of some experi
ence in the practice of his profession. We
believe tliat much useless expense has
been incurred during the past year, and
that it is traceable directly to the District
Attorney's oflice. In many suits where
the county fca.s been a party for the pur
pose of protecting the county's interest the
lioard of Supervisors has been compelled
to employ outside counsel to assist the
District Attorney. 1 '

no indictments were founa.

MODESTO SUIT DECIDED.
Dr. Tynan Will Retain the Estate
His Step-Daughters Sought
to Secure.
The Court Rules That the Plaintiffs
Have No Right to Any of
the Property.
MODESTO, Cal.. Feb. B.â The long
pending case of Woodside against Tynan
was decided to-day in favor of the de
fendant.
This action, was brought by Mrs. Eme
tine A. Woodside and her sister, Mrs. E.
Lucinda Fuquay, against their stepfather,
Dr. Thomas E. Tynan, several years ago
to require him to convey to tbem practi
cally all of his large estate, valued at sev
eral hundred tDousand dollars, tinder the
claim that it had been acquired by him
during his marriage to their mother, and
after her death from the rents and profits
of her property.
The suit was first tried before Judge Wil
liam O. Minor and decision rendered in
favcr of the plaintiffs, on December 22,
1893, whereby the plaintiffs were given
three-fifths of Dr. Tynan's property. An
appeal was taken to the Supreme" Court,
and the judgment was reversed on the in
sufficiency of the evidence to support the
decision of the lower court, the evidence
having been chiefly based upon conversa
tions which the plaintiffs testified they had
heard between Dr. Tynan and their mother
during the time that they were between
the ages of 5 and 12 years, now more than
twenty-five years ago.
TbVcase was pushed forward to a second
trial and was called on January 27. The
counsel for plaintiffs included Governor
Budd, who has been present during the
trial, while the defendant was represented
by D. M. Delmas, L. W. Fulkert and W. H.
Hatton.
When the evidence for the plaintiffs was
closed to-day Mr. Delmas moved the court
for a non-suit on the ground that the
"plaintiffs had shown absolutely no right to
any part of the property. The matter was
fully argued and this evening the court de
cided in favor of the defendant. It is the
general opinion that the decision, con
sidered with that rendered by the Supreme
Court, finally disposes of the case.

TOMANS IN A
FUTILE SEARCH
No Trace of the Missing
Mrs. Cody Can Be
Found.
BUT ONE BAY OF HOPE.
She Might Have Started to Join
Her Children in Los
Angeles.
DRAGGING THE BAT IN VAIN.
Relatives Now Believe That the Un
fortunate Woman Did Not
Commit Suicide.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 8.- No trace of
the missing Mrs. Arthur B. Cody of Chi
cago has yet been found. Tne Bearch in
the city and suburbs, as well as outside
points, was to-day pushed with the vigor
ihat has characterized the movements of
the officials and the relatives of the un
fortunate woman during the past week,
but aside from unfounded reports and
theories, without facts to substantiate
them, nothing new has been learned.
Attorney Cody, the husband of the miss
ins woman, has, since the trail to Portland
turned out to be a wrong one, come to the
conclusion that his wife is still alive and
making her way southward|with the inten
tion of joining her children, who are in
Los Angeles.
Chief of Police Smith left the city at an
early hour this morning to investigate a
clew in some new direction, but just where
he has gone or to what this new move is
due has not been made public. The de
tective force, together will all patrolmen,
are leaving nothing undone in their search
in the city, but the search seems hopeless.
The party tnat has been engaged in drag
ging the bay has met with no success, and
this point of investigation gives evidence
of proving fruitless also.
It was learned this morning that among
the letters found in Mrs. Cody's room at
the home of her parents was one in which
she stated what disposition she wanted
made of her personal effects after her
death. She expressed the desire that cer
tain pieces of jewelry or other property be
given to certain relatives, evidently in
tending the letter to be her last words to
her parents. These letters are a strong
point in the theory of suicide, and while
the husband is of the belief that his wife
is alive others believe the contrary, basing
their opinions upon her letters and fro on
the fact that she purchased a revolver on
the day of her disappearance.
TO IMPEACH AXIiERSOJf.
Another Echo of Tacotnn'a Notorious City
Hall Scandal.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. B.â Tne City
Council passed a resolution this afternoon
calling for impeachment proceedings
against Isaac W. Anderson to remove him
from his position as City Park Commis
sioner, on the ground that he misrepre
sented to the city of Tacoma the value of
the light and] water plant purchased by
the city from the Tacoma Light and Water
Company, by which transaction the city
was defrauded out of $787 : 5OO; further
more, that he used money to bribe voters
at the election for the pure base of the light
and water plant, and that he is guilty of
neglect of duty.
The petition was sworn to by J. A.
Overman and John Koel. Councilman
Bulger introduced the resolution. Attor
ney Arthur N. Jordan rcDresents the peti

before the City Council on these charges
has been set for 10 o'clock on the morning
of February 20.
Anderson is president of the Tacoma
Land Company, a side issue of the North

LAWSUITS AT SANTA ANA
Justin Fruit Association Sues the
Earl Company for Breach of
Contract.
Dissatisfied Growers of the County
Are Watching the Case With
Much Interest.
SANTA ANA, Cal., Feb. B.â Suit has
been instituted by the Justin Fruit Asso
ciation of this county against the Earl
Fruit Company in the Superior Court here.
The plaintiff alleges that under a contract
between the two parties the defendant sold
thirty-two carloads of oranges from March
to July, 1894, from the proceeds of which a
sum aggregating $1878 92 was fraudulently
withheld.
The case is an important one^ to fruit
growers, who, as a rule, have suffered too
often by tricky commission men. The
prominence of the defendant company
lends to the action more than usual in
terest.
This is: the second case now on the
docket of the Superior Court of this county
in which the Justin Association sues the
Earl Fruit Company, the former one being
for a larger sum alleged to be due owing
to the failure of . defendant in | fulfilling a
contract to.dispose of a stipulated number
of carloads of oranges during a certain
period. .' ; ' â

SAN BERNARDINO
WATER STORAGE
Irrigation Facilities That
Cannot Be Surpassed in
California.
THE SPRING TOERENTS.
Thousands of Acres of Arid
Land to Be Brought Under
Cultivation.
ABTESIAH" WELLS TO ASSIST.
Tunnels to Tap Mountain Ranges
and Beds of Creeks at
Intervals.
SAN BERNARDINO, Gal., Feb. B.â A3
the greater portion of Southern California
has to depend upon irrigation as the means
of aiding the cultivation of the Boil the
county of San Bernardino is second to
none in water resources.
Dividing the desert and valley portion
of the county is a great range of moun
tains, constituting a watershed that can
not be surpassed in California. On the
south side of the range the mountain
streams dash from every canyon and
gorge into the valley below, and all that is
necessary for the farmer to do to get the
water on his land is to construct his
drains and ditches, the former to protect
his lands, as in winter time and early
spring the streams at many points come
down in perfect torrentÃ.
Two of these streams in particular â one
coming fron Santa Ana Canyon on the
east and the other from Lytla Creek
Canyon on the west â form most destruc
tive rivers, that when up sweep every
thing before them, the latter especially
having destroyed thousands and thousands
of dollars worth of valuable property.
Along the Santa Ana F.ivef bed, to the
southeast of this city, a Riverside water
and improvement company has sunk big
artesian wells at a distance of about 200
feet opart, so that in summer time they
swell the size of the stream, which during
the months of June, July, August and
September runs quite Jow.
Irrigation, it might be said, is in its in
fancy in this county, as the water used
was taken as it nat'irally came from its
mountain retreals, there being no effort to
increase the flow or form any storage.
That it came was sufficient for the old
settlers of tne valley. Whether or not it
was taken under control to be used on
land where its natural flow would never
take it was a matter of very little conse
quence.
But new blood took hold. Men of push
and enterprise saw that great things could
be achieved in this county by means of
irrigation. They set to woj-k and to-day
Highlands and Redlands furnish indis
putable results.
JLJefore the Bear Valley dam was con
structed and its waters sent down over the
eastern plains of the valley, where Red
lands and Highlands now stand were
nothing but acres and acres of cactus,
sagebrush and rocks. Unfortunately for
all concerned the Bear Valley system has
been very indiscreetly handled and sensa
tions are yet liable to spring from its
waters. That it is a great system there
can be no doubt, but is it the only one?
No. There is the Arrowhead company,
the Grapeland, the Semi-tropic, the Cajon,
Columbia Colonization Company and
Lytle Creek.
Perhaps the greatest of all is the Arrow
head Company. The seat of operations of
this company is about a quarter of a mile
over the summit of the mountain. The
company is now in the fourth year of its
existence. At present not much work is
being done on the system, as the company
has a corps of engineers at work examin
ing the resDective sheds.
The water will be taken from the moun
tain recesses by a system of tunnels, in
which there will be twenty tunnels in all,
ranging all the way from 300 to 6000 feet in
depth. â¢ Two of the tunnels have been com
pleted, one being 6000 feet in depth and
one 2000 feet. The third tunnel is now-be
ing excavated and it is estimated that it
will be about 2200 feet in depth.
These tunnels are not to be opened at
regular intervals, but will follow the course
of the range, which will include a scope
of between 75 and 90 square miles. These
tunnels are being built on contract, and
already over $450,000 has been expended
on them. When the tunnels are completed
they will empty into a canal built along
the mountain side, and thence into a
mammoth dam or reservoir. This will be
the distributing point by which thousands
of acres of land on the great desert beyond
the mountains will be irrigated and placed
under cultivation.
The men back of thia enterprise are
thoroughly responsible, and feel satisfied
that their venture will prove a success in
every particular.
A system that is attracting considerable
attention from men versed in irrigation
affairs is the Grapeland Company. This
company also goes on the tunnel system,
and as a result of their labors they now
have a tunuel 2300 feet in depth, from
which flow over 300 inches of water. The
tunnel, when comp.Vted, will be between
3000 and 3200 feet in depth.
As the work progresses the water in
creases at the rate of one inch per foot.
Very little timbering tyas to be done, as
the work has been almost through solid
rock. The tunnel runs under Lytle Creek.
Where the end will be it will be seventy
five feet to the surface or river bed. in
many places the tunnel is 400 and 500 feet
under ground and in none less than 40 or
50 feet. The tunnel throughout is 4i6U
feet.
In the neighborhood of $150,000 has been
expended in the enterprise, but owing to
the muddle over the Wright act work has
been suspended. His act has also placed
the company in a peculiar position, as
John \V. Downs of this city, who holds
$3000 worth of Grapeland bonds, has filed
on the water flowing from the tunnel to
rcake good his venture. He also awaits
the decision, saying: "If Judge Ross' de
cision is sustained I have the water; if re
versed I have the bonds."
The other enterprises nave as yet not
progressed snfficiont to make any show
ing, as the present time is being token up
securing rights of way and posse sion of
certain water rights. The Columbia
Colonization Company is intended to water
the great expanse of country in and about
Victor. The dam of the company will be
built at what is known as the Narrows and
will be 150 feet in height, below which will
be a submerged dam to catch the under
flow.
The watershed from which the water
will be taken has an elevation of about
5000 feet, with an annual rainfall of about
68 inches. During the dryest period of the
year, the flow of the river at the dam site
is nearly 14,000 inches, and it is estimated
that the reservoir with the height of 150
feet and in length 140 feet at the base ana
350 feet at the top, will irrigate 200,000
acres, and by raising the dam to a height
of 175 feet 400,000 acres can be accommo
dated.
It will take two or three years to finish
the work, and it is estimated that the cost
will be about $1,584,700.
The reservoir will hold 127.721,404,000
United States standard gallons, and after
making allowances for evaporation and
seepage, and reserving one-third of the
capacity of the reservoir, there would be
left for use 115,633,836,000 gallons. When
the system is completed as planned it will
be one of the greatest in the State.
San Bernardino City depends on artesian
wells for its supply, there being between
1000 and 1200 in the city and immediate
vicinity. __________________

Nature works as hard as she can, but
there are some things she cannot stand. If
a man gets some foreign substance into the

watch to i run ; until the impediment is re-

himself. The reaction comes on gradually,
. however, so that sometimes he scarcely sus-
pects the cause.
The causÂ« of nine-tenths" of the sickness
of the world is constipationâ a condition
so common that four people out of five take
it as a matter of course. From this one
cause come ; indigestion ; disorders of the
stomach, liver., and kidneys ; biliousness,
headaches, flatulence, heartburn, impurity
of the blood and the serious complications
that follow. To begin with, constipation is
a little thing, and a little thing will cure it

Grass Valley the Home of
the Happy One.
But it Was Not in Gold That
He "Struck It."
IT IS FUNNY TO WATCH THE MAN WHO
-*- goes out to make his fortune in a way that
is ' 'out of the groove." Sometimes he will ap-
pear in the guise of a lottery fiend ; again ha
will appear as a dabbler in stocks ; anet he is to
be found as a gold mine prospector, and he has
been heard of as trying to find gold on. goose-
berry bushes. In any case he is a man without
an objectâ a careless, reckless and usually
[ worthless chap, whose duty to humanity (in
his mind) is made up of getting rich at some
one else's expense. That is not the type' of.
man, though, who carries his life in his hand
from day to day, and who really works hard to
secure fortune's favors. ;: He is ; usually a ster-
ling, whole-souled fellow, fearing nothing,
though he risks much. One of the sterling sort
of searchers after "luck" who has recently
"struck it rich" is Mr. A. Burton of Grass Val-
ley. He was unable to pursue his arduous call-
ing as a miner because he was prostrated with
a serious disease. He thought there was no
relief for him and he began to look at death as
a certainty. He had not heard of. the grand
old Hudson Medical Institute then. But he
went there and he is cured now. '"Health is
more than wealth." His good fortune was
health. , In a letter to the managers of that
great institution he says 7 .

See how with "hard times" practically staring
him in the face, this decent fellow expresses
his thanks for what has been done for him by
the skilled "physicians at the great institute
which is located at the corner of Market, Stock-
ton and Ellis streets. And he is only one
among many thousands of decent, grateful
men. For instance, among those who have re-
cently felt impelled to thank the specialists .
for what had been done for them : . "
S. J. Bailey of Weaverville says: "After two
months' treatment by you I feel fully restored
to health." *â¢ Â» , .
K. C. Tart of Stowe, Cal., says: "I am feeling
fine without a sign of the disease now."
J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah, writes: "I am
very pleased to say that I am cured of the
terrible disease I had."
There is not a single State or Territory in the
Union from which equally satisfactory indorse-

be a proverb (for it is pure and unadulterated

Before Rear-Admiral

SKILLED IN EVOLUTION.
Intricate Maneuvers Gracefully
Executed by the Brawny
Sons of the Sea.
STATE GUARDS IN THE LINE.
The Naval Commander Pleased With
the Splendid Showing â A Dance
at Night.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. B.â The men
who would defend California on land and
sea in case of war marched in review
before Rear-Admiral Beardslee here to
day. An imposing and martial array it
was that threaded the streets of San Diego,
the trimly garbed blue jackets and the
manly guards of California vicing with
each other in grace of movement and cor
rectness of evolution. Nearly a thousand
marines were in line, the flagship Phila
delphia, the monitor Monterey and the
Albatross furnishing their full quota.
Admiral Beardslee had cause to feel proud
of the showing they made, for careful dis
cipline "Â«ras evidenced by the easy and
graceful manner in which they executed
intricate maneuvers. Altogether the naval
parade was a great success and it was an
event that San Diegans will long remem
ber.
The earliest information relating to the
excursion this morning, was to the effect
that a party of 800 excursionists had left
Los Angeles and Pasadena in a train made
up of two sections. This was very pleas
ing news, inasmuch as it was hardly ex
pected that many visitors would attend.
The first section arrived at 1:15 o'clock.
The second section, containing large num
bers from Riverside, Redlands and San
Bernardino, arriving soon after. A large
crowd was at tho station to meet the
visitors and escort thorn uptown.
After their arrival, the crowds of visitors
had time to secure luncheon, when the
entertainment began by the assembling of
the marines, sailors and military at 2
o'clock on D street in front of the court
house. The parade moved promptly at
2 :30 o'clock, under command of Colonel A.
G. Gassen, with E. E. Spileman and
George H. Bower, adjustants, and E. A.
Lavin, orderly, acting as staff. The parade
was strictly military, except for the
mounted police and a few civilians in line.
The first division was led by the mili
tary band of the United States flagship
Philadelphia of thirt3* pieces, all costumed
in brilliant new uniforms. Then came
the Army and Navy Battalion, Lieuten
ant-Commander Injrersoll, Staff Surgeon
F. A. Hessler, Adjutant W. H. Campbell,
Ordnance Otiicer H. A. Eilers and Chief
of Pioneers Barth. Following these came
Company H of the First Infantry, United
States army, Lieutenant R. H. Noble;
Philadelphia marines, Leutenant McLe
more; four companies of seamen from the
Philadelphia, commanded by Lieutenants
Holcomb, Field, Shoemaker and Lanning;
United States battleship Monterey oat
talion, Lieutenant W. R. A. Rooney com
manding, Ensign C. C. Fewell adjutant;
two companies of seamen, Lieutenants
Lieper and George commanding; ammu
nition passers, hospital corps, artillery
battery, Gunner Charles B. Babsen com
manding.
The second division was headed by the
City Guard band of twenty-four pieces.
Then came Company B of the Seventh,
Captain R. V. Dodge; Third Division
Naval Battalion, Lieutenant T. M. Shaw,
and about twenty carriages containing Cap
tain Coffin of the Philadelphia, Captain
Drake of the Albatross, Lieutenant-Com
mander Wadbam of the Monterey, Gen
eral C. F. A. Last of the Second Brigade,
National Guard of California, with their
respective staffs, and a number of other
officers.
The parade was reviewed by Admiral
Beardslee, General Last and others, from
a position on the plaza, after which the
military and marines were disbanded, with
the exception of the Philadelphia bat
talion, which, .under the command of
Lieutenant-Commander Ingersoll, exe
cuted its famous "silent drill" to music,
being accompanied by the military band
of the Philadelphia. The drill was watched
with interest by an immense crowd, which
attested its appreciation by frequent ap
plause.
The ball to-night at the Hotel del Coro
nado was the most brilliant affair in the
history of San Diego. The ballroom, the
largest in Southern California, was deco
rated with flags from the warships, and
the rooms were filled with beautiful
women and handsomeh uniformed offi
cers. The marine band of the Phila
delphia and the Kamrnermeyer's Hotel
orchestra furnished the music. Fully 2000
persons were present, and the ball at its
height was a kaleidoscope of vivid coJor.
The Chamber of Commerce has prepared
a programme for the entertainment of ex
cursionists Who will remain in the city, it
consisting of side excursions, balls, sailing
parties, etc.
KCIiLATTICK lA SA3T HIS /.'A ARMS O.
Officers Jtelicre They Have the ' Denver
Healer in Jail.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. B.â
The jail officials of this city are positive
that they have the world-renowned healer
Schlatter in the County Jail and &s a
member of the chain gang breaking rock
for the county. He was brought in from
Redlands last evening as a vagrant, and
judging from the various descriptions and
published likenesses of the Denver healer
the prisoner is that personage. â¢- i
While at worK on the chain gang the
stranger Keeps apart from the , other pris
oners, and when in jail he seeks his cell
and will have nothing to say to his fellow
vagrants. This afternoon, on being ques
tioned by the deputy in charge of the chain
he said: â¢ . . . '
"1 am here doing penance."
During another conversation he said that
the mule which lie had ridden had died
crossing the Yuma desert. He ia very de
vout, seemingly very ignorant and simple
in his actions. In fact, in every respect
he resembles the lowly cobbler who two
months ago was besisged by thousands of
invalids and cripples.
It is known that a year ago bcblatter
was a tramp and at that time visited Colton, .
and it is believed that he again took to the
road.

Experitneut* Being Wade at San Zeandro
and Rutherford.
RUTHERFORD, Cal., Feb. B.â Some of
the representative men of this vicinity
held a meeting this afternoon for the pur
pose of discussing the beet sugar industry.
It is believed that the soil here is suitable
for beet culture, and it was decided to get
twenty or twenty-five farmers to plant a
small piece of ground each this year for a
sample, and if it can be demonstrated
that the beets can be raised here satisfac
torily, to try to induce Mr. Spreckeis to
establish a factory here.
SAN LEANDRO, Cal., Feb. B.â One
hundred ranchers in the vicinity of San
Leandro are planting beets from seed fur
nished by Claus Spreckels this year to
prove tbe'quality of the beets for making
sugar. In case the quality is proved, one
of the largest beet sugar plants in this
country will be erected at West San Le
andro, where rail and sail transportation
will make this the best location in Cali
fornia.

GRANTS PASS TREASURE.
Seven Thousand Dollars in Green
backs Found in a Buried
Can.
A Friend of the Late Anson Burlin
game Believed to Have Cached
the Money.
PORTLAND. Ob., Feb. B.â W. S. Fassett
returned to Portland to-day from Grants
Pass, and tells a strange story about the
unearthing of $7000 in greenbacks, issued
the second year of the rebellion, jn the
ranch of Jared Overton, about ten miles
south of Grants Pass. On Thursday last
Overton had cause to visit a corner of his
farm never having been under cultivation.
In looking about, tie saw in a small rift
made by the recent rains, the corner of a
rusty, sauare oyster-can. It was sealed
and seemed to contain some metaliic sub
stance. Overton opened it as a matter of
curiosity, and to his utter surprise, he
found it filled with brandnew greenbacks,
protected by a covering of oilskin.
The currency was almost as crisp as
when it came from the printing-press, and
was in denominations of from $5 to $100.
The metallic substance in the can turned
out to be four octagonal $50 slugs minted
in San Francisco in 1852. The property
upon which this treasure was found has
changed hands a score of times since the
beginning of the war, at which time it was
almost worthless.
Mr. Overton, the present owner, lives
near San Francisco, and only recently
carve up to inspect it. He said that the
late ATison Burlingame, during the time
he was Minister to China, owned the prop
erty. In 1865 a friend of Bnrlingame,
Henry F. Welsh, supposed to be quite
wealthy, came out from Washington City
for his health and lived on the ranch for
almost a year, when he died.
He brought with him two negro ser
vants, a married couple, who after his
death alleged that Welsh carried with him
a large sum of money, which disappeared.
It is possible that the greenbacks are the
Washingtonian's money, which could not
be found after his demise.
CURING THE GOVERNOR
The Strange Case of the Nevada
Official, Who Is Still
Living.
The Remedy Consists Largely of Two
Pasty Salves, One of Which is
Yellow, Like Butter.
Governor Jones of Nevada, who has
been ill so long at the Palace Hotel with
cancer of the stomach, continues to im
prove steadily. His appetite is good now,
he walks around considerable, reads the
papers and has increased in weight.
It was a month ago yesterday when the
three physicians attending him assured
his family that his case was hopeless.
They said he might live forty-eight hpurs,
but that would end his career, for the
disease which he had was a malignant
cancer. Mrs. Jones then stated that she
believed she would try another physician.
"I shall only be glad if you do," is re
ported to have been the reply, "for know
ing the terrible agony of the death which
awaits persons with this disease, I shall
be only too glad to get him off my hands."
Therefore Mrs. Jones called a physician
who had been recommended to her.
"When I called on him," said this phy
sician, who is a woman, "I found five
large lumps in the stomach, some of them
as large as two fingers, and all covering a
space as iarge as your hand spread out. I
didn't know but what his case was too far
gone, but I said I would try It.
"He began to improve, though the
change was slow for a few days. He it* get
ting along splendidly now, and there is no
doubt about his complete recovery."
The physician says it is nothing to cure
a malignant cancer, and that she has
cured more than thirty persons. Her
remedy, as seen yesterday, consisted of a
couple of jars of salve, such as would make
the ordinary physician shriek with laugh
ter. One of the jars looked like butter,
being of a yellowish color, and the com
pound in the other was as thick and
pasty, but of a greenish hue. These queer
salves are applied externally by the hand
and are expected to kill the poison of the
cancer, whiie a prepared liquid taken in
ternally tones up the system. It is this
that is expected to cure Governor Jones.
The new physician, however, is not even
a medical graduate. She claims to be a
licensed practitioner, however.
Govprnor Jones doesn't need to go to
Nevada now to sign the payroll. The Su
preme Court got to figuring on it, and
finally Judge JJigelow came down a day or
two ago and informed the Governor that it
was all right; that he needn't hire a pri
vate car to go there, but to stay here and
continue to get well.

EXCURSION TO DONNER LAKE.
Eloquent Lecture by a Survivor of the
Party Stormbound Fifty
Tears Ago.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Feb. B.â As the ex
cursion train pulled into Truckee this
morning gunpowder salutes, the blowing
of locomotive whistles and other sounds
of welcome awakened those of the citi
zens who had not yet deserted their
couches. Sleighs were in waiting to take
the visitors to either Dormer Lake or Lake
Tahoe, and soon merry crowds were being
drawn over the snow, their laughter min
gling with the sound of sleigh bells.
At noon a special train was chartered by
the Knights of Py.hias t j take excursion
ists to the Dormer Ice Company's works,
and about 500 people, accompanied by a
brass band, took advantage of tuis oppor
tunity to witness the harvesting of the ice
and spend an hour or two skating on the
pond. The Knights of Pythias were out in
uniform, and they made this mountain
town resemble a military camp. It was
their day, and they made it an enjoyable
one.
Tobogganing has captured the crowd to
night, and it appears to be a greater at
traction than a circus. The involuntary
shouts at their first trip down the slide
scares even the immovable Digger Indian.
William G. Murphy, a survivor of the
famous Dormer party, was a center of at
traction to-day, and be was taken to the
site of the cabins of the Dormer party in a
Pullman car. He was photographed un
der a cross marking the spot where his
mother was buried. He recognized the
country and the places where the cabins
were built, and waa overcome with emo
tion.
Mr. Murphy's lecture to-night was a
popular attraction. Hundreds of people,
anxious to hear the story of the Dormer
party from one of the survivors, crowded
the hall, and hundreds were unable to gain
entrance. The unfortunate ones went to
the skating rink or the toboggan to enjoy
themselves as best they could.
William G. Murphy, the lecturer, it a
venerable gentleman of 65 years, a lawyer
and an impressive speaker. He is an ex-
City Attorney of MarysviJle, where he re
sides, and considers himself part of the
State of California. HÂ« commenced his
lecture by stating that he intended to de
liver a sort of mixed historical remi
niscence in the nature of a memoir.
He followed the Dormer party from its
starting point in Kansas through the
great central plains to the point where
the fateful storm of the winter of 1846-47
overtook them, and where his mother
died from starvation. The story of terrible
suffering, the eating of human remains
and other appalling incidfÂ»nts were drawn
in wonderful word pictures, and his audi
ence was held spellbound.
"During the early summer of 1847," said
the speaker, "I settled on the banks of the
Yuba. I was living there when gold was
discovered by Marshall. When the Mill
race country was developed a city was laid
out on a ranch and called Marysville in
honor of my youngest sister, who crossed
the snow with meâ she who cut trie shoes
off these frozen feet.
"There have I realized the dreams of my
boyhood, solved that scheme of human
happiness that comprehends home, wife
and children, and while I so reverently
thank God for all the blessings bestowed
upon me and mine, it is natural that mem
ory should carry me along that stream
that sends yonder snow into the valley
down by my. home on its way to the sea, and
standing here at its source, in my imag
ination, I contemplate ti.e sad ending of
those companions so ruthlessly cut down
in health.
"They all, with me, had hopes, ambi
tions, day dreams, fond anticipations as to
what they would accomplish when they
reached that fairy land of promise
toward which we all were journeying.
But there are memoirs of the past, mostly
sad, burned into our very natures, that
will not down at our bidding, though fifty
years have passed. And this I realize in
all its potency as to-day, after half a cen
tury, I present myself ,to scenes and asso
ciates that rush upon me.
"As I stood on that ice-bound reservoir
that sow in sacrilege floods the common
crave of the deadâ our dead, the relics
gone back to the wrecks from which they
were taken and their spirits to God who
gave them â and listened to the winds as
they trembled through green boughs and
bending branches of the stately old pines
mournful sentinels they seemed to give
in whispered cadences and wordless signs,
in echoes and re-echoes, the moans, groans,
wails and prayers of the helpless and
starving of fifty years ago.
"These sighing winds, solemn as a
funeral dirge, bring back to this frail
memory pictures and scenes that hang in
boyhood's hall, so deserted and drear. ~
"1 almost fear to tread and call back to
life and reality incidents and casualties
long since buried in the heart. An apall
ing stillness is nature's requiem, but the
eulogy of those dead is unpronounced and
unpronounceable, save in hearts like this â
hearts that knew and felt and loved and
suffered as no mortal tongue can tell. "
GAMBLERS ARRESTED.
Police Kept Busy Enforcing the New
Anti-Poker Gambling Or

Last night orders were issued to Police
Sergeants Davis and Donovan to raid the

cupied by the grand officers, and twenty
parlors have their meeting places there.
Everything about the large hall will be
completed for the ball Tuesday night,
which will be an aftermath of the dedica

Though the building cost $100,000, the
hall association has placed most of the
stock, and has the enterprise on s good
financial footing. The present directors of
the hall association are:
J. r>. Phelan, president; Lewis F. Bylngton,
vice-president; Adolph Eberhardt, secretary;

Robert W. Martland is manager of the
building.
The hall association was incorporated in
April, 1893. The capital stock is $100,000,
in 20,000 shares, owned exclusively by
members.
The building is a handsome four-story
structure with the main hall on the ground
floor. The other stories are laiu off in
meeting halls, fifteen of which are used by
parlors of the Native Sons and five by the
Native Daughters. The Marine Engineers,
Knights of the Golden Eagle and letter
carriers also meet there, and Lincoln Post
and the Grand Army Corps will take a hall
on March 1. The building is elegantly fin
ished throughout and an elevator that runs
is provided in contrast to some fraternal
buildings. The stage of the main hall is
provided with a handsome drop-curtain
â¢nd scenery for entertainments and the
floor is of maple. It has a spacious gal
lery. The hall is intended for Jarge meet
ings as well as balls and entertainments,
and especial attention has been paid to the
acoustic properties.

ROYALTY IS THE DANCE
Prince Luigi of Savoy Attends
the Italian Free School
Ball.
SPEAKS ABOUT THE CLIMATE.
Large and Brilliant Gathering of Ital
ian Society People and Their
Guests.
Prince Luijrf of Savoy and his fellow
officers were the guests of the Italian col
ony last night, at the ball given in Califor
nia Hall on Bush street, for the benefit of
the free Italian school.
. There was only one opinion expressed
by those present respecting the entertain
ment â it was a success, a complete and
delightful success. This happy state of
things was largely brought about by the
pleasant geniality and hospitality of the
entertainers of the Italian colony on the
one hand and by the exquisite courtesy
and friendliness of the distinguished guests
on the other.
There. were no more simple, unaffected
men in the room than the officers. From
the Prince downward they entered into the
spirit of the affair, and devoted themselves
might and main to the entertainment of
those to whom they were introdnced.
Not only had the local Italian colony
turned out in force, there were also con
tingents of guests from neighboring coun
ties, all come to do honor to their Prince.
California Hall was charmingly decorated
with bunting and pennants, bearing the
red, white and green of Italy, interspersed
with the white cross of Savoy.
The brilliant uniforms added color to the
scene. Several gentlemen of the colony,
particularly the Consul, Cay. Bruni Gei
ruaidi, shone with orders and decorations.
Some of the ladu-s wore full evening dress,
others were in demi-toiiettes, but there was
plenty of dress display and flowers were
everywhere.
Signori P. Barbieri, Car. Calegaris, A.
Sbarboro, J. F. Fugazi and other members
of tbe school committee met the Prince
and his fellow-officers at Folsom-street
wharf. From there the whole party drove
directly to the hotel, where they arrived in
time for the grand march at 9 o'clock.
As his Royal Highness entered the hall
a burst of cheering from a thousand lusty
Italian throats assured him that he was
welcome. The grand march commenced
forthwith, the Prince leading the way with
Miss Aida Sbarboro. The first dance was
the lancers, in which the Prince and Miss
Sbarboro took part, the remaining seven â 
couples being: Captain Bertolini with
Mrs. A. Barbieri, Chief Engineer G. B.
Ricci with Miss A. JPaladini, Second Lieu
tenant Presbiterio with Miss A. Crimi,
First Lieutenant Aymeri with Miss E.
Brizzoiara, Commissary Politi with Miss
B. Paladini, Lieutenant Arrivabene with
Miss M. Marchetti, and Dr. Giura, surgeon
of the Cristoforo Colombo, with Miss Rosa
Avignini.
Between each dane? Prince Luigi held
an informal reception, so to speak, at
which members of the colony brought up
their friends and introdusedlhem to "Sua
Altezza," each being welcomed by a
friendly shake of the hand and a" few
pleasant remarks from the frank youne
sailor. He looked very handsome and
boyish in his brilliant uniform and his
honest gray eyes seemed to light up with
genuine pleasure at the friendliness
evinced for him on all sides.
Prince Luigi had not yet conversed
with any of the representatives of the
American press since his arrival in this
City, as he has a horror of publicity, and
prefers being regarded as a lieutenant of
the Cristoforo Columbo to being looked
upon as a prince.
When a reporter of The Call, however,
was presented to him as having resided in
Italy, he chatted pleasantly and unaffect
edly of his native land.
The English he spoke was pretty and
rhythmic, with a slight foreign lisp, and
the distinct "E" of cultured Italians, but
his voice was low and what the Italians
call "una voce sympatica."
"Do you think this climate resembles
that of Italy?" was asked.
"I prefer San Francisco," answered
Prince L,uigi frankly. "You seem to have
no extremes of climate here. I lave a
great dislike either to ereac heat or cold.
In our northern provinces it is frigid at
this season, and further south our summers
are intensely hot."
All the officers, in speaking of the Prince,
wÂ«re enthusiastic in his praise. "All the
three brothers are alike," said one lieuten
ant, pleasant and unaffected to every one,
and he added: "It is only the truly great
who can afford to be so affable; their posi
tion is assured and they have no fear of los
ing caste by being delightful to high and
low alike."
The hall and its approaches were most
elegantly decorated, palms and ferns con
trasting effectively with the Italian and
American colors. The stage was embow
ered in tropic foliage, amid which a select
orchestra of forty pieces was stationed.
The music during the evening wus excep
tionally fine, the rendering of the "Marcia
Reale' ; and Italian National Hymn as
the Prince entered the hall being particu
larly spirited and effective.
Amohg the guests were:
Dr. Rottanzi and tbe Misses Adela and Silvia
Rottanzi, Dr. and Mrs. Spitzy, Mr. and Mrs. A.
Mancina, Mr. and Mrs. A. Ferrogiaro, Mr. and
Mrs. G. Giovannoni, Mr. and Mrs. G. Cadenasso

ROYALTY MET AT COURT.
The Etiquette of Prince Luisrl, Count
Ceni and Prince Ponia
towski.
Prince Luigi, Count Ceni and Prince
Poniatowski met and regaled themselves
over in the Palace Hotel court yesterday
afternoon. Count Ceni had come out
from the hotel office booted and spurred,
with a riding-whip in his hand. Prince
Luigi appeared in the court about the
same moment, and he also was rigged for
riding. Each strode forward with daunt
less air.
About this time they espied Prince
Poniatowski and he saw them. Poniatowski
had come in, it appeared, from the grill
room. Such another lot of bowing and
rushing for chairs for one another was
probably never seen before.
Each nobleman bowed low and often,
and seemed to feel that it would be the
greatest occasion of his life if he could only
get a chair or two for the others before
they did for him. Prince Louis was as
active as the othpr titled {.'entlemen.
The three sat down and began to con
verse in French. Finally Poniatowski
said something to one qf the waiters at his
eibow. The others did likewise, and pres
ently three glasses were brought forward.
One was a foaming beaker of something
with the hue of whisky and soda. This
was for the Polish nobleman. The others
were two small glasses of liqueuer, and
these and the big glass the three notables
quaffea, while they continued their con
versation in French.
At iength Cciii and the Duke arose and
made thsir obeisance. It was a deep
rooted, heartfelt obeisance, apparently,
and Poniatowski felt it as such, and
showed his appreciation of it by retalia
tory bows.
Count Ceni and the Duke of Abruzzi.
otherwise Prince Luigi, were setting out
for the lncleside races. Their horses were
ready, and they vaulted into their saddles,
waving other adeiux to Poniatowski. who
waved a few more back to them, and the
etiquette of the affair was over.
Mayor Sutro has, by the way, at last
figured out the difficult problem as to
whether he should first call on the Prince
or wait for the latter to call on him.
After much consulting ol authorities on
etiquette and asking the advice and aid of
those who have bad experience with roy
alty, he has come to the conclusion that it
is his place to call on Prince Luigi on
board the Italian cruiser Cristoforo
Colombo and not wait in his office for his
Highness to take the initiative.
In order that the municipality, judi
ciary and Federal authorities may be well
represented he has invited Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court Beatty and Collector
of the Port Wise to accompany him.
The party will leave Harrison-street
pier at 10 o'clock this morning on a special
tug and will be welcomed on board the
cruiser with the pomp and ceremony befit
ting the standing of the members. An in
vitation will be extended to the Prince to
visit the various departments of the City
and United States Government.
MORE ARRESTS TO COME
Warrants Are Out for Witnesses
in the Peralta-Reavis
Case.
How One of the Most Gigantic
Swindles of the Age Was
Brought to Light.
The arrest of Andres Sandoval on a
charge of conspiracy in connection with
the mythical Peralta-Reavis claim to lands
in California valued at $75,000,000 will be
followed by the arrest of some eight or ten
other persons on a like charge.
Warrants have already been sworn out
in the United States District Court for the
arrest of the many witnesses who swore
to the legality of the Peralta-Reavis claim
and the Marshal's deputies are now busy
serving them. It is expected that all the
parties to the fraud wiil be arrested in a
few days.
United States District Attorney Foote
admitted yesterday that warrants had
been issued for the accused persons. Fur
ther than this he would not discuss the
situation.

women in California will be arrested and
charged with perjury and conspiracy in
connection with this case. Similar cases
were tried in New Mexico and Arizona
and nearly all the Peralta witnesses were
found guilty of perjury and punished quit*
severely.
The perjuries complained of in the
present instance are alleged to have been
committed in the examination before
United States Commissioner Houghton in
this City in October, 1890. A dozen wit
nesses testified in favor of the fraudulent
claimants to sora* 13,000,d00 acres of land
in this State. It is expected that ail who
figured in that investigation will be ar
rested.
The history of the litigation and the at
tending conspiracy is an interesting one.
In October, 1892, James Addison Peralta
Reavis and Loreto Micarla de Peralta
Reavis, his wife, sued in the Court of Pri
vate Land Claims for confirmation of a
grant alleged to have been made by Spain
in 1758 to one Miguel Peralta, Baron of
Arizona, Knieht of the Colorados and
grandee of Spain, covering 12,740,000 acres
of land in Arizona and New Mexico. This
claim included the sites on which the city
of Phoenix and. other large places in Ari
zona now stand. The title to the land had
been investigated by eminent counsel and
pronounced genuine. As a result many
persons and a few corporations acquired
interests in the territory claimed as pur
chasers from the plaintiffs.
It was alleged that the original grant
had been rooomraended by Philip V of
Spain in 1744 and by Ferdiuand VI in 1748;
that it had been actually allowed by
ihe Viceroy of New Spain in 1748 and rati
fied some time later; but the Federal au
thorities made a thorough investigation of
the claim and the result was the unearth
ing of a great mass of fraud. From a
search of the archives of Spain and Mexico
it was found that the instruments of which
the copies were correct and duly authenti
cated were cleverly forged on genuine an
cient parchments, from which other writ
ings had been skillfully erased, and placed
among the records attending the adminis
tration of Government affairs in California
and adjacent territory during the period
of Spanish dominion.
Special counsel from Washington will
conduct the prosecution of those charged
with conspiracy in what is declared to be
one of the greatest frauds of the century.

CONVICTED OF FORGERY.
Jonathan Tice Implicated in the Zovt
Will Fraud.
PORTLAND, Ob., Feb. B.â The trial of
Jonathan Tice for complicity in the Love
will forgery was concluded before Judge
Stephens to-night. After fifteen minutes'
deliberation the jury returned a verdict of
guilty as charged.
This case has been on trial for several
days and great interest was taken in the
proceedings. Tice, who at one time was a
prosperous merchant here, was the leader
in a conspiracy by which it was intended
to swindle the heirs of the late Nancy M.
Love out of an estate worth $1.50,000.
A penuine Love will was in process ol
being probated when the ccnspnators
made attempts to sell a bogus document
to certain attorneys for the purpose ol
contesting and, if possible, defeating the
original will. Besides Tice there were Georga
G. Smith, who pleaded guilty to having
signed the will as a witness; F. R. Mnrfit,
an insurance man, now in the penitentiary
for forgery, and an attorney named Edgar,
who left this city two years ago after being
arrested for forgery.
It came out in the trial that Judge Parks
of Oregon City, who disappeared from
here two years ago and is supposed to oe
in the East, was implicated in the trans
action.

AN EFFORT TO
SAVE THE BOYS.
Friends of Majors and Will
more Urge Reform
Measures.
APPEALING TO VICTIMS.
The Men Who Were Robbed Will
Be Asked to Give Their
Assistance.
WHY MAJORS SR. WAS HANGED.
Lawyer J. Richards' Reminiscences of
the Famous Murder Trial Twelve
Years Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 8. J
Now that the excitement concerning the
arrest of tne boy burglars and safe
crackers has subsided and the youthful
prisoners have told their stories, there are
not wanting those who think that the
prisoners should be kept from going to
State prison. It is evident to all who
have passed a few hours in the boys' com
pany that they do not realize the enormity
of the many crimes they have committed.
The lads are not desperadoes; they are
reckless, thoughtless boys. They are not
sentimental, and there is nothing babyish
about them, but neither are they entirely
callous. There is probably a great deal of
truth in the story told by Majors, that his
first ideas of burglary and safe-cracking
were inspired by a story of crime and the
methods of carrying it out.
The part that is most puzzling ia that
played by Mrs. Willmore. All the police
officials that have investigated the details
of the case, from the Chief down, say they
are positive that she must have known all
that was going on. It was intended to
place her under arrest to-day, but Chief
Lloyd said to-night that although abso
lutely convinced that she knew all that
Mrs. Majors-Wagner, the Mother of One
of the Boys Arrested at Oakland.
[From a photograph.]
was going on it would be impossible to
secure a conviction so long as the boys
stuck to the story that sb.e knew nothing,
and so he seeE no use in making the arrest.
It is very evident that young Majors'
love for the V.'illmore girl is very strong
and that he will not say a word against
her mother. Although questioned several
times since his arrest he wi!l say nothing
that will tend to show that Mrs. V Urnore
knew of what they were doipg.
The young girl, Ina, is a particularly
bright little woman and for six months it
has been known amonc their friends that
Mrs-. 'Willmore sanctioned the engagement
to Majors and was willing that they
should marry early. Abe Majors makes
no secret of his love for the girl.
The boys express sorrow that they com
mitted such deeds, but the police think
that there is nothing in their manner to
indicate that they would not do the same
again if they were free. They told Ser
geant Hodgkins to-day that they have
been taught a lesson by their arrest and
imprisonment that they could never forget
for the rest of their lives. They both de
clare that when they get out of their pres
ent trouble they propose to lead upright
lives.
It is not thought probable that the boys
will be sent to San Quentin", and it is the
opinion of many lawyers that they cannot
legally be committed to the penitentiary.
Attorney Ayers, who is defending the
boys, says that there can be no real de
fense where the boys unequivocally con
fess their doings, but he says he will do
everything possible to keep the boys out of
the penitentiary. He is trying to per
*uade all the storekeepers whose stores or
safes were opened by the lads to sign af
fidavits that they think the ends of justice
w'll be best subserved by having the young
burglars committed to a reform-school
rather than to the penitentiary.
'It is very evident," said Atttorney
Ayers to-night, "that the boys are not
thoroughly bad. They have been wild
and reckless, but Ido not think they are
beyond the pale of reformation. Ido not
believe that any one whom they have
wronged will wish to see them branded as
convicts for the rest of their lives. They
got their silly notions from trashy liter
ature and they seem to be really penitent.
Both boys have lacked the bringing-up
that only a fattier can direct, and to a
great extent they are to be pitied. They
both worked when they could get work
and up to a few months ago Abe Majors
was good to his mother. I shall probably
plead not guilty for them in the Superior
Court so as to gain a little time and partly
because the lads do not realize what they
have done and are not, therefore, legally
guilty."
Mrs. Wagner says that her divorced hus
band, who is now in contempt of Judge
Wood's court, is responsible for Abe tak
ing a dislike to home and going to stay at
Mrs. Willmore's. Wjigner is at present
keeping out of Chief Lloyd's way, and it
is thought that he could perhaps give
some light on his stepson's career if he
could be found.
Abe Mayors was asked to-day about
some trouble that it is reported be once
got into in the Sierra Nevada Mountains
in which be is credited with doing some
shooting. Both the lads deny the story,
and although questioned separately they
tell precisely the same story.
Willmore said that the trip was under
taken shortly after he found the Hinckley
diamonds. He said: "I had been work
ing for Mr. Mason steadily for about
three and a half years, and he told me I
could take a vacation. Archie Majors and
I started out together, after he had bought
a couple of horses from the proceeds of
the bicycle which Mr. Mason bad given
me as part payment for the diamonds.
Alter I had a quarrel with Archie Majors
I walked back. I was gone about five
weeks. We did net have any trouble with
anybody while away."
When asked if he ever thought of the
certainty of arrest Willmore replied: U I
never gave the matter a thought. I just
wanted to get enough money to leave
town. I had heard that times were better
at Los Angeles, and I was trying to get
enough money together tb go down there.
I intended to take my mother and sister
along although 1 had not said anything
about it."
Both the boys were in the Police Court
to-day, but only for a few minutes. Their
attorney asked that the examination be
set for next Monday.
Abe Majors has shown aversion all day
to seeing hi 3 mother. He was asked this
evening if he had any message for her, ana
he replied, "No; but tell Mrs. Willmore to
come ana see me." Several times during
the day Abe has asked people to tell Mrs.
Willmore that he wants to see her. Mrs.
Willmore's absence, and her remarks that
Abe has led her boy astray, have been con
veyed to young Majors, and he hinted this
evening that only his love for Ina has kept
him from talking.
About six months ago Archie Majors,
who is supposed to be in San Luis Obispo,
told several of his friends that there were
diamonds in the Willmore house, but it
was thought tnat the boy was romancing.
Now it is believed that the stories were
true. The incident referred to was before
Abe went to stay at the Willmore house
and soon after the Hinckley diamond
episode. Every effort is now being made
to find Archie and bring him to Oakland.
If Archie tells all he knows for the par
pose of saving his brother there will prob
ably be a revelation.
THE RESPONSIBILITY.
Oakland Is Agitating the Question
Whether the Boys Should
Go to Prison.
There is a general discussion in Oakland
of the moral responsibility of the boys and
of the law of heredity in connection with
this case. In an editorial yesterday the
Tribune said:
The two young rascals who have been ar
rested in this city for a series of burglaries
have made an extraordinary record of crime.
It is doubtful if it can be matched by any
other criminals of the same age in all the
country. What astonished the community
was the youthfulness of the criminals. Young
in years, they were old in crime. Now, where
did they get their schooling? They had a
complete set of burglar's tools, most of which
had been made to order. They knew how to
drill a safe, put in a stick of dynamite, arrange
the fuse and make an complete a job as any
old criminal who had speut half his life in the
penitentiary.
Are these congenitaljcriminals, who needed
very little schooling to fall into criminal ways?
One of them is the son of a man who was exe
cuted in this city for one of the most diabolical
murders ever committed in the State. He did
not commit the act, but planned it and then
induced three others to rob and murder an in
offensive old man who was living in a lonely
cabin in the hills of Santa Clara County. The
criminal inheritance of the other is not quite
so clear. But he is so desperate that he ac
cused his mother of a knowledge of some of
his crimes. He had not even the chivalry of
an ordinary criminal.
The boldness and rapidity with which this
series of rascalities was committed disclosed a
genius for crime that has seldom been sur
passed. These fellows are young enough to be
sent to a reform school. It is doubtful if there
is any training at Whittler that can make them
other than what they are now. The peniten
tiary is a very poor school of reform; but it is
quite the safest place for those whose inherited
instincts and aptitudes are all for crime.
The Enquirer says in regard to the same
subject :
In the general mind the idea of heredity as
applicable to crime is that of yielding to irre
sistible inclination, and the view taken of re
sponsibilities under these circumstances is ex
pressed by the remark which has been heard
during the last twenty-four hours, "A person
is not responsible for what he can't help and
should not be punished for it." Such expres
sions as these are prompted by a general and
not an intimate knowledge of the doctrine of
heredity, as; it is held by scientific men. How
the latter look at it was explained by Professor
Jordan of Stanford in a lecture which he de
livered in San Francisco last evening. The
following is a condensed report of a portion of
his remarks:
"When the individual is born," said the
speaker, "he finds that 'the gate of gifts is
closed.' The characteristics he inherits are,
so to speak, 'stage direction*' by which his life
is ordered. If he is a well-balanced man he
may develop new characteristics, acquire new
individualities, develop the best and suppress
the worst of his inherent qualities. He inher
its many diverse and discordant elements. It
is the work of training in life to bring these
discordant elements into harmony. Many in
dividuals go through life and never do any
thing except by the 'stage direction' of heredi
ty. Many of the so-called 'double lives' are
the result of failure to bring these discordant
elements into harmony. Lives sometimes fall
apart through degeneracy. Every man's an
cestry has left him a mosaic of characteristics
which he may, if he works right, weave into
beautiful pictures, or which may be a simple
jumble of inchoate elements. If he does not
work them right he is simply a machine for
spoiling so much oxygen."
It will be seen that in the way President
Jordan puts it all responsibility does not go
out when heredity comes in. We are all to
some extent victims of criminal heredity, be
cause we all inherit some vicious tendencies
along with our good ones. The boy Majors has
had many ancestors and has inherited from
all of them; he did not get his whole nature
from his father.
By the clergymen who have been inter
viewed about the proper punishment for
the boys the following opinions have been
expressed :
Rev. Dr. E. S. Chapman: "I believe they
should be dealt with with such severity as to in
timidate any others from attempting to follow
their example. They are not boys. One 17
years of age is as old as one was at 30 when I
was a boy. I have no faith at all In reforma
tory institutions for such, for they are beyond
the age when they can be reformed. I have
the greatest interest in boys. I have been a
teacher among them for years. I believe in
teaching them the power of government and
authority."
Rev. Dr. Alfred Rummer: "The question of
what to do with them is a grave one. Young
fellows who are fo hardened in crime as to be
ready to take iife, however, cannot be allowed
to go unpunished. The manuer of punishing
them and at the same time to make something
out of them is one of the unsolved problems as
yet. It is pitiful to see such young fellows
going to the bad. I believe it is greatly due to
the literature they are allowed to read. There
is a romantic streak in most boys which causes
a great deal of such trouble, even when fed on
proper material. They are not hardened crim
inals, but are carried away easily, owing to a
lack of early training."
Rev. Dr. Robert F. Coyle: "Such crimes as
these boys have been guilty of should be pun
ished. The punishment, however, should be
of a reformatory nature, which it has not
always been. But because it has not is no rea
son why punishment should not be meted out
to such offenders."

THE CRIME OF MAJORS.
Lawyer Richards Tells the Story of
the Celebrated Case
of 18S3.
The murder of William P. Renowden
and Archibald Mclntyre, for which Lloyd
Majors, father of Oakland's boy burglar,
was hanged, was characterized by inci
dents of the most dramatic interest, such
as make it one of the celebrated cases of
California.
This is the story as told by John Rich
ards, counsel for Joseph Jewell. The laiter
was a companion of Majors in the crime.
"Lloyd L. Majors came to San Jose in
the early part of 1876," said Mr. Richards.
"He brought with him a young wife. He
was about 35 years of age, a big, ungainly
man, awkward in manner, homely of face,
having a dark, stern, rather covert and
altogether forbidding expression. He wore
a thin, straggling beard that only partially
covered a mouth the ugly lines of which
constituted almost a deformity.
"His wife, on the contrary, almost a
child in years, was very fair to look at,
trim of figure, simple in manner, modest
and full of winsome grace.
"Majors was a carpenter or wagon-maker,
and set himself up in a shop on the
outskirts of the town on what is
known as the beautiful Alameda. He pro
fessed to be something more than a worker
with his hands, however, and engaged the
attention and won at least the familiar ac
quaintance of myself and other lawyers of
the town who happened to have graduated
from the Ann Arbor Law School by de
claring that he, too, had done so. He also
enlarged his circle by joining the Metho
dist Church and taking a prominent part
in its work.
"His shop suffered from a series of fires,
from which he always collected the in
surance. No suspicion regarding .the tires
attached to him. Apparently broken up
from their effects he left San Jose and went
to Los Gatos. He joined the church there,
but was handicapped in his progress in
that direction by opening a hotel with a
bar attached. This brought him into dis
favor in the cuurch. The step from a
hotel with a saloon attached to a saloon
without the hotel was easy and took place
directly, and Majors became known as a
plain saloon-keeper.
"Meanwhile he took to politics in lien of
religion, and was an active figure in the
Garfield campaign. That was in 1880. He
organized a uniform company in Los Gatos
and traveled the country over making
speeches, in which he was quite forcible
and effective. His wife bore two
children at that place. His place was
known as Majors' Mill from a large wind
mill which he had built with the purpose
of not only developing power for pumping
water, but for other purposes. His saloon
became the rendezvous of the idle and
rough element of the entire neighborhood.
"I had a personal meeting with Majors
shortly after the installation of Garheld
that impressed itself upon my memory,"
said Mr. Richards. "Garfield was in diffi
culty with National high lights â the con
troversy with Conkling being at its height.
Majors called in at the office and the con
versation turned to this. He became ex
cited with the topic at once.
"'I know Garfield,' he said. 'I was a
pupil at Hiram College when he was a
professor there. I tried to enter a certain
class, but failed in mathematics. Garheld
took a fancy to me an>l offered to help me
along in this study ; gave me his evenings
for personal instruction until I caught up
with that class. I entered Hiram College
because there a boy nail a chance to secure
an education by working for it. I know
Garfield and '
"The man paced up and down
the room and worked himself into a
passion, giving me such a demonstration
of passion as 1 had never seen. It was
frightful â his dark, vindictive face was
seamed and distorted by its violence. He
swung his arms and increased his gait,
great drops of perspiration stood
upon his face, while he -beat the air and
swore, declaring over and over again that
if the men who were opposing and block
ing the wheels of his administration were
within his reach he would tear them limb
from limb. This voluntary exhibition of
violence amazed me, and, as I say, fixed
itself in my memory.
"In the mountains near Los Gatos there
lived an old woodsman named William
Renowden. He bwned 200 acres of the
mountain side, lived in a cabin, was some
thing of a recluse and was popularly sup
posed to have considerable money hidden
away. His cabin stood far up on the
mountain side, and from its door a picture
of incomparable beauty stretched away
below, the mountain leading down in
gentle slopes to the far-spreading valley,
wita its winding river and the white vil
lages in the far distance.
"Recluse that he was, Renowden had one
friend in Archibald Mclntyre. Mclntyre
was an ideal mountaineer, a Scotchman,
agile, strong, fine looking and known far
and wide. His every acquaintance was
his friend. This young man lived with
the old man much of the time.
"One morning in March, 1883, the village
of Los Gatos was aroused by a messenger
from the mountains, who brought the
news that old man Renowden and young
Mclntyre had been murdered and their
cabin destroyed by fire. Of course, tnis
created great excitement; parties went out
to the place and people talked and specu
lated of nothing else. Majors' saloon be
came the center of all this, and Majors
himself was loudest in denouncine the
atrocity, and most eager for the capture
of the murderers.
"A mountaineer had first brought the
news to town. He lived some miles away
from the Renowden cabin, but had seen
the light of its burning. Fearful as these
men are of forest fires and quick to com
bat them, he had hurried toward the light
until he came to the edge of a deep can
yon, on the further side of which was the
burning cabin. He saw that he could do
nothing and turnedback. Next morning,
however, he made his way around the can
yon and found the ashes of the cabin and
near by the body of Renowden pierced by
two bullet holes.
Afterward those who went up from the
village searched among the ruins and
found something of the trunk of what had
been another human being. It was only a
portion of the lungs and the upper portion
of the heart. These were carefully pie
served at the time, afterward sent to a
physician for examination.
"Interest in the crime grew aa time
passed. Nothing developed further, how
ever, for two or three duys, when it was
noticed that two men who had figured
quite conspicuously in the life of the com
munity were missing. They were John
Showers, a young, big- boned, brutal lel
low, and Joseph Jewell, a man almost his
opposite in every characteristic. Two
horses had been stolen from Majors' stable
the night of the murder, and the tracks of
two horses, ridden at speed, were noticed
in the road leading toward Gilroy. Then
came the news that two men answering
their description had been seen at Gilroy,
and one of 'them was arrested. The other
escat>ed. Showers it proved to be who was
arrested. Locked up he confessed. With a
relish of its details that proved him the
fiendish inventor of many of them, he
told this story:
"With Jewell he had been a frequenter
of Majors' saloon and of all the number
Majors had selected tnern to do this mur
der, that had long been in his mind.
Majors would invite them to remain at
night after the others had gone, fed them
on whisky, and after a while broached the
subjectâ explained how easily it might be
done, the improbability of detection and
the money that might be secured. Mur
der was not a necessary iucident in the
first discussion, but it came to be con
sidered as a matter of course afterward.
Jewell and Showers when the left Majors'
place would wander to the banks of Los
Gatoa Creek and there elaborate their
plans. They intended to torture the old
man into a confession of where he kept his
hoard, as they called it. They would burn
his feet and with pincers pull the nails
out of his toes until the old man was
forced to tell. When they had secured the
treasure they would humanely kill him.
These details were evidently the invention
of Showers.
"On the day appointed the two went up
the mountain to a point above the cabin,
where they could reconnoiter. They soon
discovered that Renowden was not alone.
They had plenty of whisky along, and
waited in the Drush all the afternoon,
hoping that Mclntyre would leave. When
the sun was going down they determined
to wait no longer ; they would go through
with the enterprise anyhow. They de
termined to approach the cabin for some
thing to eat, ana afterward to ask the way
to Los Gatos. One would remain in the
cabin wnile the other went out to receive
the directions, and when the two men
were thus separated they would attack
and overcome them. The plan was carried
out. They were made welcome at the cabin
and given supper. Then Jewell asked to
be shown the way to Los Gatos. The old
man led the way out, and proudly, 89
though this prospect presented to their
eye were his one luxuryâ a leature of his
hospitality, and, awaiting the expected
exclamation of surprised delight from his
visitor, he pointed his finger to the far
away point in the beautiful valley, where
the windows of the little village had
caught and held the light of the setting
sun.
"Showers remained Inside. He heard a
shot and then another. Mclntyre sprang
up, drew his gun and rushed to the door
and on the threshold received a ball that
struck him dead from Jewell's revolver.
This was Showers' story, remember.
Showers carried a 45-caliber, and Jewell a
38-caliber revolver, according to this same
story. The two men were dead, and the
murderers, alarmed at their work, forget
ting the plunder, hurried down the moun
tain, and about midnight, heated and
worn, rapped at the back door of Majors'
saloon. They were admitted, and in a
few broken sentences told the instigator of
the crime what had taken place. He gave
them two horses from the stable adjoin
ing and they fled through the night toward
Gilroy. This was Showers' story.
"Majors was arrested, and so, shortly
afterward, was Jewell. Although the
revelation as to Majors created some sur
prise at tirst, it was generally believed. A
neighhor had noted on the morning after
the murder that Majors' mare, as she stood
in the stable, showed signs of having been
ridden hard the night before, being cov
ered with mud, and evidently very tired.
A man who lived a couple of miles from
town on the road toward Henowden's
place had been awakened by the sound of
a horse's hoofs going at a gallop over the
neighboring bridge, and about an hour af
terward heard tbe same sound again, the
horse traveling back toward the town.
"This was the circumstantial evidence
against Majors. It explained the fire.
Majors' plans had not carried. His two
tools had murdered two men, and were
flying the country. A lire destroying the
bodies of his victims would leave him se
cure.
"Discovery would come with daylight,
and daylight was but a few hours away.
It was never exactly known, but no one
doubted that it was Majors' horse that
crossed the bridge track at a gallop be
tween midnight and morning, and between
the going and returning of which the
mountaineer discovered the light of the
burning cabin.
"But in their hurry the murderers had
probably not told him that old man Re
nowden's body was not in the cabin.
"Of this murderous trio, the man Jewell
was the mystery," continued Mr. Richards.
"He was a young man of most pleasing
appearance and address. He was an artist,
and a good one; correct in his speech, a
gentleman of some education. He carried
himself well, was neat and well dressed.
He was distinguished for his loye of chil
dren, and every child in Los Gatos was his
chum. He spent his spare hours in the
homes of little children, and would spend
hours with the little tots, apparently per
fectly happy. For some months, however,
it ha.d been noticed that he grew idle and
was drinking.
"Stiowers, because of his confession, was
sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial
of Jewell was taken up. I was appointed
by the oourt to defend him. The triai
lasted eleven days. He was convicted and
sentenced to be hanged. It developed
during the trial that Jewell was not his
name, but where he came from, why he
came to Los Gatos. why he concealed his
identity, all that was made known to but
one man, who alone succeeded In gaining
his confidence. That man was his sworn
enemy, the nearest friend of the murdered
man Mclntyre, who has taken an oath to
pursue the murderers through his life and
to the ends of the earth if needs be. The
man's name is Morrill, and he is now a
well-to-do rancher, near Los Gatos. He
gave up his business and devoted himself
solely to the conviction of the men. He
gathered much of the evidence for the
prosecution. He visited Jewell in his ceH
every day and so won upon him that the
â murderer told his whole story, though
under Dromise that Morrill would never
reveal any part of it but what pertained to
this case.
"His people, he said, were highly re
spected and he would not have them dis
graced. Morrill was confident that Majors
was the chief devil in the scheme, and it
was for his conviction he was working.
Showers had insisted that Jewell fired the
shots that killed both men. It was the
effort of his counsel to raise doubts with
the jury as to the truth of this story.
Jewell consented to go on the stand. He
said that when Renowders led the way
out of the cabin lie (Jeweil) had no notion
of committing murder. He intended to
trip him up and secure his hands, believ
ing it would be easy for him, a young
man, to do so. The old mountaineer
turned npon him with such vigor, how
ever, as to take him completely by sur
prise. He started to retreat, but the old
man came after him in such style that he
was compelled to shoot. The first ball
struck him in the shoulder and only
seemed to enrage him. He shot again and
killed him. At the same time he heard a
shot from the cabin and Showers came
running out alone.
"A remarkable oorroboration of the
truth of this was presented. It will be
remembered that only a handful remained
of the body of Mclntyreâ something of
the lungs and the heart. As the physician
examined this remaining portion of the
heart there dropped upon his table a
bullet. It fitted a 45-caliber revolver
which Showers had confessed was the size
of his own. This fact was made much of
to Bavethe life of Jewell, and I was given
to understand it almost prevailed.
'Then came the trial of Majors. It
attracted even more interest than the
other. There was the testimony of his
two confederates against him and the cir
cumstantial evidence mentioned. But
against it all there was the presence in the
courtroom of his broken little wife
still young and still pretty, with her little
wisp of a ngure, but broken utterly.
' And unconscious of what it portended
to them their two beautiful little boys,
playing about the courtroom through
those long summer daysâ Little Abe, the
younger, with his long brown curls, his
confident, childish days, went from one to
another in the courtroom making friends
with everybody and drawing frtquent tears
from the more tender of those wno realized
what he did not. The picture of that mild,
broken little woman and her babies has
remained with me sinca and always will.
1 had lost sight of them, however, until
this new tragedy in their lives has come
to light likts a sequence to a blight. They
saved Majors from a death sentence at that
ume, for the jury's verdict pleaded mercy.
But Majors' Nemesis was there in the per
son of Morvill.
"The public was not satisfied. Majors
had been tried for the murder of Renow
de,rs. MorriU, backed by public senti
ment, urged a prosecution for the murder
of Mclntyre. The defense secured a
cnange of venue, and the second trial took
place io Oakland. Majors was coavioted
and sentenced to hang. Shortly afterward
he maae a desperate break for liberty, and'
made his way from jail to the open street
and fought his way, hand to hand, with
his pursuers for a block and until his arm
was broken. Then he surrendered, and
was hanged while his arm was still in
splints." .

PORTI^AND, Oregon, Feb. 5.
I send you herewith the photographs of
some of the best people of Portland, and I
write to tell you that Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla has touched the hearts of the
people of this city. I have personally
spoken to and noted the different people
ox the Quimby House who have used
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaoarilla, and they all
praise the great remedy.
Portland is doing finely. Business is
not absolutely rushing, yet one meets few
idle people and everything has an air of
business. Go on the streets, in the mar-
kets, to the theaters, all is lifeâ not the
hurly-burly, bustling life of Chicago, but
the staid, solid business life of a substan-
tial city.
The Hon. D. J. Quimby is now one of
big cannery is Jto be operated the coming i
season. Last year great difficulty was ex j
perienced in handling the fruit crop, foT '
while seventeen new dryers were erected, I
the orchards which came into bearing for j
the first time increased the output mate
rially.
Never since the establishment of fruit i
canneries in this city have conditions been
more favorable than at the present time.
In February last year over 40,000 cases of j
unsold canned j:oocls were stored in the i
fruit-pacfcing concerns of this place, while
to-day there is but 500 caseÃ remaining un- I
sold.
Miller & Hotchkiss, proprietors of the
Russian River cannery, nave made an
offer to purchase the Sebastopol cannery,
the leading business men of Portland, and I
I was interested in him to-day for nearly
two hours. We spoke of the result of the j
new bond issue, and we agreed in looking
forward to a good spring business, j
"Well," said he, "I'm glad it is coming. I
I feel able to cope with an" amount of I
extra work. lam really and truly a strong !
man. I was not in good spirits or health \

GREAT HOME REMEDY,
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA.
To tell you the truth, all of the regular
guests of the Quimby House had spoken
to me so hiehly of Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla that I was induced to try it, and j
the result is simply marvelous. lam now j
a strong and vigorous man. I suffered I
very much from biliousness and liver
complaint. I can truly indorse Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla."
Afterward I conversed with the gentle-
men whose names appear above, and I
give you the exact substance of my con-
versation.
MR. F. SNYDER said: "Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla is a good remedy. It
was recommended to me. I took it. I
feel betterâ stronger. I am not now
jaded."
MR. J. MURRAYâ Headaches bothered
me. I used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
and to-day a Call reporter was informed
by Mr. Hotcbkiss that the sale would
almost certainly occur. "If we get the
cannery," said he, "it will be operated.
We are not putting our money into the
buildings for tun, but because we desire to
handle the product of the Gold Ridse
orchards. Every case of goods put up by
us since the establishment of our packing
houses nas been sold at satisfactory pncea,
and we wish to extend our capacity. The
Analv country offers the field desired.
The residents of the Geyserville country
look largely to Walden & Co. for a market
for their fruits. Last season the firm ex
perimented in the matter of putting
up brandied fruit, and it proved a sue
cess.
It is a great remedy. I recommend it.
C. 'f ROXELâ Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla has many friends in Portland.
GEORGE PEASEâ Put me down as an
indorser of Joy's Vegetable Barsaparilla.
JOHN McGINNâ I believe Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla has more friends in Port-
land than some of the best-liked men. It
pleases every one.
F. HILDEOâ Joy's Vegetable darsapa-
rilla cured me: I like it. I recommend it.
J. F. ELLIOTTâ We all believe in Joy's
for the jaded.
F. HILLâ A drngeist tried to talk an-
other blood medicine, but I ordered a
bottle of Joy's because Joy's is the best.
A. J. MORRISâ Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla cures skin disorders. I had a
friend who suffered muchâ he now praises
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
F. BUTTONâ Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa-
rilla is good for the blood. I like the
remedy.
L. W. BROWNâ We all praise Joy's.
P. KALICHâ Joy's is the great medi-
cine now.
J. S. JENKINS-I have ttsed Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. It is good.
W. H. HUNTER-Joy's for me every
time.

people who praise the great remedy, Joy's

TUNNELED TO THE SURFACE.
Earth Hidden Under the Boilers
Causes a Search and Leads to
Discovery.
A well-planned plot to escape from the
State prison at San Quentin has just been
discovered among the lawbreakers in that
institution.
At least a dozen of the most vicious

to Escape. ,
[From a sketch by a "Call" staff artist.]
criminals within its walls are thought to
have been implicated, and that the most
desperate break for freedom in the history
of the prison has not occurred is due to the
sagacity and unceasing vigilance of
Warden Hale and his officers.
A hole through the prison jrall below
ground, a tunnel running a dozen feet
along the wall and a shaft reaching to
within a few inches of the surface fur
nished a means of exit in the proposed
flight and bore the startling testimony to
the cleverness of the plotters. The work
had been so nicely calculated that the top
of the shaft was covered only by a cement
gutter, which, while it prevented a prema
ture cave-in, would form but a slight bar
rier to the desperadoes when they had
decided that their time for escape had
The works were big enough to permit
the passage of the largest man, and their
extent is thought to indicate that many
men were involved.
The tunnel started from the fireroom of
the jutemill, where the brawniest and
most vicious of the convicts are kept at
work. This room has great boilers on
either side. They are bricked in, leaving
narrow passages between them and the
outer walls, and in a center aisle the con
victs feed the tires.
In one of the passages between the
boilers and the south wall of the prison
are situated the pumps which supply the
boilers, and the dim corner beyond fur
nished the plotters an opportunity. No
one had business at that spot, and it was
seldom visited. So there they worked
while a confederate kept watch.
One by one the bricks were loosened in
the wall, patient fingers picking the mortar
from between them. Handful by handful
the earth was removed ami thrown be
neath the boilers through an iron door in
the rear brickwork, put there for use only
during the annual overhauling. Each
night and at the least alarm the loose
bricks were replaced, but finally the work
was finished, and the conspirators waited
only for a foggy day to make a dash for
liberty.
But the attempt was frustrated through
the keenness of Warden Hale.
One morning several weeks ago that offi
cial passed hurriedly through the mill
door and started for the flreroom. A con
vict standing in the doorway of that room,
on seeing the Warden, turned quickly as
though to warn some one inside. This the
Warden noticed and he suspected some
thing wrong. His officers were notified
and since then that department has re
ceived special watching.
When the mill was shut down for the
annual overhauling the officers found the
earth beneath the boilers, and then know
in g what to loon for were not long in dis
covering the tunnel. This was filled in
and the wall was rebuilt and yesterday
when the Prison .Directors were taken to
view the spot nothing was to be seen save
the patched brickwork.
The desperate nature of the attempt to
escape, which would undoubtedly have
been made except for the timely discovery,
ia revealed by a survey of the outside sur
roundings. The shaft came to the surface
near the foot of a Gatling gun tower, in
which armed guards are stationed night
and day, and the attempt must have inevi
tably been made in the daytime, since no
convicts are permitted in the mill after
5 o'clock. But the head of the shaft is so
close to the tower that the escape might
not have been witnessed by the guards
therein, and the convicts may have hoped

to surprise and overpower the guards, and
so secure arms. Even then it is hard to
see what hope of escape they could have
had, as both at night and on foggy days
the country round about is patroiled by
guards armed with repeating shotguns.
The officers of the prison, even now,
when tho discovery of the plot is gener
ally known, ere reticent about it,
and but few details concerning it are ob
tainable from them. It is known, how
ever, that two convicts have occupied the
dungeons because of their part in the mat
ter, and the Warden is stiJl probing for
information as to their accomplices. A
dozen men, at least, are habitually em
ployed in the fireroom, and it is scarcely
possible that the work could have been
done without the knowledge of each one
of them.
It was yesterday that the directors
learned of the attempted break, though
the tunnel was discovered a week or more
ago.
RAINING IN LONDON.
The Swell Young Men and Ladies Have
An Experience Upon Leav
ing the Baldwin.
Like on the street crossings on a rainy
and muddy day the ladies leaving the
Baldwin Theater last night lifted their
skirts, and displayed all manner of pretty
bottincs and ankles to the delectation of
a contingent of human statuary on the
lookout in front of the building.
It was one of the periodical displays
which occur, according to Alfred Bouvier,
whenever there is a "full house" in the
theater, and some idiot in the rooms over
head in the Baldwin Hotel starts to take a
bath, and lets the water run on while he
listens to the performance through the
ventilator.
As a matter of fact, Starter Caldwell of
the Inpleside racetrack, quit his room, 74
in the hotel, and demanded another, on ac
count of the plumbing being out of order.
The house plumbers came in and tried to
remedy all abjections. When they left,
they had forgotten to turn off a faucet run
ning at full blast, and at 9:30 p. m. room 74
was flooded with Spring Valley's product,
and it showered the lobby of the theater.
PRESS CLUB SMOKER.
An Informal Reception for Members
and Invited Guests.
The Press Club of San Francisco gave an
informal reception and smoker at their
rooms, corner of Kearny and Sutter streets,
last night. There was a large attendance,
and the utmost feeling of goodfellowship
prevailed.
Among the honored guests was Mr.
Telfair Creighton of the Los Angeles
Herald.
A number of gentlemen came over from
Oakland, and by some unaccountable mis
hap missed the last boat. It was discovered
at a late nour t,hat some underhanded
miscreant had stopped the Press Club
clock at 11 o'clock, and by unanimous vote
it was decided that the Oakland men were
not to blame. Their wives are expected to
accept this explanation as sufficient. Resi
dents of this City who waited for the first
car this morning are authorized, to use the
same excuse.
As the Press Club has a goodly airay of
musical talent, there was no lack of
melody and symphony. The usual re
freshments were present and were enjoyed
by all.

POLICE OFFICERS
FIGHT A DRAW
A Lively Tilt Disturbs the
Quiet of Morton
Street.
SERGEANT COOK'S ACTION
Accuses Officer John McGlauflin
of Being Drunk While on
Duty.
THE CHARGE STBONGLY DENIED
Demands the Officer's Star, Gets It
and Also a Stiff Blow on the
Neck.
Through over-zealousness Sergeant
Cook, one of the recent promotions of the
Police Commissioners, has brought down
on his head that which may mean severe
censure, if nothing worse, from the powers
that be. The direct cause of his trouble
was a fight between him and another
officer on Morton street.
It all depends on hia ability to establish
the fact that Officer John McGlanflin was
not only drunk while on duty, but used
vulgar and disrespectful language to his
superior. Back of this is a story or official
authority which began Thursday night on
Morton street and ended at the California
street station, at least for the time being.
On Thursday night Officer McGlauflin
was in charge of that part of Morton street
lying between Kearny street and Grant
avenue. With all the vigilance of which
he is capable, according to his story, he
patrolled the shady thoroughfare, not
leaving his beat from the time he went on
duty until requested to do so by Sergeant
Cook. Then he went, with many protesta
tions, into which crept, unwittingly, he
says, some pretty strong language.
At exactly 9:50 o'clock, as McGlauflin
was nearing the Grant-avenue end of his
beat, the sergeant came upon him, though
from what point of the compass the officer
does not know. Anyway, Cook, so Mc-
Giauflin says, immediately accused him,
in language much stronger than the occa
sion demanded, of being drunk, following
this up by demanding his pistol and club.
These weapons were prntestingly handed
over, but the sergeant was not satisfied.
He wanted the officer's star, and nothing
short of that would satisfy him.
McGlauftin curtly but firmly refused to
yield the rive-pointed trophy, declaring at
the same time that he was not drunk and
did not propose to be degraded any
further. This enraged Cook apparently
beyond control, for he sprang at the now
defiant officer, and then followed as pretty
a rough and tumble tussle as the most
pugnaciously inclined could desire. It
ended by McGlauflin landing a half-arm
upper-cut on the sergeant's neck, com
pelling the latter to call In assistance.
Officers Young and Floyd responded,
and McGlauflin asked them to substantiate
his oft-repeated statement that he WRo not
drunk or" even drinking. The belligerent
officer was then persuaded to accompany
Floyd and Sergeant Cook to the California
street station.
On the way McGlauflin met several
friends and he called on them to make
note of the fact that he was not intoxi
cated. At the station he loudly protested
against the indignity to which he had
been subjected by the new sergeant, and
those who saw and heard him, among
whom were Officers MuJender and Murphy,
were compelled to admit that he was ap
parently perfectly sober.
McGlauflin stated at the station that
Cook had used violent and vulgar lan
guage, calling him among other things a
native son, . He said
further that he had noticed the sergeant
in the neighborhood for over an hour, and
was greatly surpriÃed when the iattercame
up and accused him of being drunk. He
had not taken a drink in weeks he said.
.lust here comes one of the most peculiar
features connected with the incident.
McGiauflin was relieved of his star and
after a few moments' detention was al
lowed to so. No charge of drunkenness
was placed against him at the police sta
tion then or afterward.
The next day he was given back his club,
pistol and star, and last night was back on
his old beat, Morton street. If McGiauflin
was drunk there is no apparent reason why
he should not have been locked up like
any other man charged with a similar
offense.
Officers and patrolmen around the Cali
fornia-street station declare that Mc-
Glaufln gave no evidence of being intoxi
cated when he arrived there. He was very
much excited, and insisted on asking
every person with whom he came in con
tact if. he looked like a drunken man.
Officer Floyd, who accompanied the semi
prisoner to the station, entertains the
same opinion. "If McGiauflin was drunk,"
he said last' night, "he certainly gave no
outward evidence of it. He was very
much excited, but that was all."
A California-street station officer, in
speaking about the matter last night, said:
"1 cannot understand the unwarranted
conduct of Sergeant Cook, unless he acted
on the sugeestion of some possible enemy
of McGlaufiin, and I was here when the
latter came into the .station Thursday
night, and I will swear that he was not
even intoxicated. Cook is an officious sort
of a fellow, and is not generally liked. It
may be that, like other new men, he was
after a record. If McGiauflin was drunk
why was he not locked up, or why was he
placed on duty again before his case was
investigated?"
In the meantime Sergeant Cook has filed
a complaint against McGiauflin charging
him with being drunk and insulting a su
perior officer. The case will be heard be
fore the Police Commissioners on Wednes
day next, and the accused man will be on
band with twelve or fifteen witnesses, who
will swear that the sergeant is wrong in
his assumption.
Officer McGiauflin feels keenly the dis
grace that has' been brought upon him by
nis superior, and, regardless of the way
the case against him goes, will prefer
counter-charges against Sergeant Cook.
He has witnesses who will swear that the
sergeant used language unbecoming an
officer.
Officer? John McGlauflin has been on the
San Francisco police force for thirteen
years and this is the first time a charge of
any description has been made against
him, and naturally he is not in a happy
frame of mind, and declares his intention
of "getting even" with the man who ha 3
cast this blot on a hitherto unblemished
omciahrecord.

THE INSURANCE MEN.
An Agreement to Form a .New Associa
tion Reached by the Monterey
Convention.
Many of the insurance men who at
tended the recent convention of under
writers at Monterey came home last even
ing. The statement w"as made by a well
posted agent that practically an agree
ment was reached* which will put an end
to the reckless fate-cutting which de
stroyed the prolits of the insurance busi
ness in this State during the year 1895.
. Only three agents refused to subscribe to
the agreement. It is expected that these
three will consent to the terms proposed
within a few days.
The most perplexing question presented
was that relating to salaries and commis
sion. A vigorous pressure was brought to
bear to place brokers, solicitors and city
agents on a commission basis pure and
simple. Objection to the payment of
salaries in Oakland, San Jose and other
towns was made. As far as can be ascer
tained the new association will favor the
Commission principle.
It is thought that tke association will
take the old compact rates as the basis for
a new schedule, but will shade down the
prices somewhat and perhaps offer a
material reduction. This, however, is a
matter of conjecture at present. The

underwriters will come together in a short

organization. It is possible that the
agreement reached at Monterey may not
stand the test when the time comes to sign
the constitution.
ANXIOUS FOR THE MONEY
The Pacific Bank Property Sale
Closed for $130,000 in
Cash.
After Long Waiting, People's Bank
Depositors Will Get 10 Per
Centâ Protests.
The People's Home Saving Bank has
declared a dividend in liquidation of 10
per cent, to be payable March 2.
This action was taken yesterday when
the board of directors of the bank held a
special session, and was the outcome of
the sale of the Pacific Bank property.
There was not much discussion upon the
subject of the sale, as it. all seemed to have
been prepared, and the Pacific Bank build
ing and lot at the northwest corner of
Pine and feansome streets was transferred
to the Continental Insurance Company of
New York for $130,000.
Certified checks for the full amount were
handed to Manager Sheehan, who imme
diately thereafter deposited them with
the California Safe Deposit and Trust
Company.
The Continental Company stipulated
thai it would take care of any and all suits
involving the property, and for that rea
son it was stated the bank directors de
termined to take $130,000, notwithstanding
the fact that an offer of $140,000 from P. D.
McEiroy was before them.
With money on deposit in the trust
company's savings bank, this additional
sum of $130,000 made enough to pay a
dividend of 10 per cent of the People's
Home Banfc liabilities, and that payment
was ordered made on and after March 2.
Attorney John Flournoy, counsel of the
board of directors, and Messrs. Gunnison,
Booth and Bartnett, representing the
trust company, which ia the assignee of
more than 2000 depositors, having claims
of $720,000 against the bank, protested
against the sale, holding that $10,000 more
could be realized, and that there was no
danger from suits over the property.
The Bank Commissioners were requested
yesterday by the trust company and its
attorneys to exercise the general super
vision over the Feople's Bank provided for
in section 2 of the act creating a bank com
mission, and prescribing its duties and
powers. For cause of this request was
submitted a statement that the rights of
depositors and creditors of the bank were
jeopardized in resolutions adopted by the
directors. A communication on the same
matter was presented to the board. It
protested against the resolution granting a
stay of ninety days to M. E. Collins and of
sixty days to M. H. Sherman aud Hattie
E. Sherman, the former in a mortgage
foreclosure, and the latter in which to
amend an answer to the People's Bank
suit in Arizona.
The letter concludes as follows:
For grounds of protest we respectfully urge
that these resolutions were framed In the In
terest of the debtors of the bank, and to give
force and effect to the same will jeopardize
the interests of the depositors and creditors of
the bank, and the interests which this protest
ant represents.
Therefore we respectfully request that said
resolutions be rescinded, and that the conduct
of the litigation of the bank, so far as it re
lates to actions now in suit, be left in the hands
of the attorney of the bank.
The attorney had protested against these
resolutions, having founded his protest
upon legal knowledge, but his advice was
not taken.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Sailing of the Mail Steamer
Acapulco With a Barge
in Tow.
A CENTRAL AMERICAN PLAN.
The Beats Are to Be Used as Tenders
to the New Guatemalan
Railroad.
The water front was treated to an un
usual sight yesterday. A Pacific Mail Com
pany's steamer went out with a lighter in
tow, and the people who watched her from
the lookout station were willing to bet that
the venture would end in disaster. As far
as the passing out was concerned the pilots
thought there was no danger, but when it
came to a question of meeting a south
easter there was a difference of opinion.
Some of the pilots thought that the vessel
should never have been hampered with a
tow, while others asserted that during the
present fair winds and smooth seas there
should be no difficulty in navigating the
Acapulco to Panama.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company is
under contract to carry eight lighters to
San Jose de Guatemala, to assist the Gov

wharf. The latter is to be erected about
seventeen miles from the capital of Guate

is expected in consequence.
There are eight other lighters built to
the same order awaiting instructions from
the Central American combine, and just
as soon as it gives the word there will be
a chartering of vessels heretofore un
known. Machinery, lumber and general
m-erchandise are in' demand at Costa Rica,
Guatemala, San Salvadoi and Honduras,
and in consequence the trade at San Fran
cisco is augmented.
The steamer San Juan started with
lighter 1, but failed to get past Fort Point
with her tow. The San Jose made better
weather of it and finally landed the craft
at its destination. There were eight of the
crafts to go, however, and the Acapulco
had to make an attempt at the job yester
day. Judging by the Merchants' Ex
change's big glass at Point Lobos the
venture was a success. The Acapulco
crossed the bar without any trouble and
when last see"n was making good headway
on her way to San Jose de Guatemala.
Lieutenant-Commander Buhner, who
has been temporarily in command of the
revenue cutter Bear, has been transferred
to the revenue cutter Hartley. Captain
Tuttie has taten command of the Bear and
it is a toss-up as to which one is the more
popular. Four years ago Tuttie was com
mander of the Hartley and eight years
ago Buhner was in the same position.
The people wqk> had business with the in

and are glad to see Bunner back.
Captain Richardson of the steamer
Hope has so far recovered that he will be

His Berkeley friends are glad to hear
that he is better and Captain Jim Starke is
glad that he will once more be able to

Piper, Aden, Goodall Company's office.
The steamer Sansaiito has been laid up
to get her usual spring overhauling. In
the meantime the San Rafael will take her
place.
The steamer Golden Gate sailed for the
canneries yesterday. The Pacific Steam
Whaling Company has gone into the sal
mon packing business and is determined
to make a success of the venture. The
Golden Gate will go to Prince Williams
Sound, and will be followed by the tug
Alice, which is now being prepared for the

some lively competition.
The Southern Pacific Company's Herald,
the Monticello and the State's tug Gov
ernor M.arkham had a narrow escape from
a collision yesterday. The Herald and
Monticello were both making their dock
from Vallejo, when the Markham, in
backing out, crossed their bow. Both of
the Vallejo steamers went full speed
astern, and in consequence ran into each
other. No serious damage was done, and
all three vessels were finally able to make
a landing.
It was reported yesterday that' a woman
committed suicide on Friday night by leap
ing off the ferry-boat commanded by Cap

hand reported that the woman, who was
apparently well-dressed, disappeared as
the boat passed Goat Island. As the re
port could not be confirmed the boat was
not stopped.
i FOUND DROWNED.
Two Unknown Men Mysteriously Meet
Death in the Bay and at
Ocean Beach.
The body of an unknown man was. found
on the ocean beach about a mile south of
the Cliff House yesterday afternoon.
From the condition of the body it was evi
dent that he had been dead but a few
hours. The deceased was dressed in a
white shirt, collar, black four-in-hand tie,
a light brown cutaway coat and vest, gray
trowsers and a pair of lace shoes. The
body appeared to be tnat of a man about
45 years of age, about 5 feet 5 inches in
height and weighing 180 pounds.
A coincidence which places an air of
mystery around his death is that his
clothes were water-soaked, as though he had
met death from drowning, while the body
was lying fully 100 yards above the break
ers among the sand dunes. An autopsy
will be held to-day to ascertain whether or
not the deceased had met death through
foul play or by drowning, as the condition
of his clothes indicated.
Andrew Kearney, a boatman, discovered
an unknown body floating in the bay near
the Jackson-street wharf yesterday after
noon. After securing the body he "notified
the Coroner and the remains were taken to
the Morgue.
The body was evidently that of a sailor
about 40 years of age, and it is supposed to
be the remains of the man who jumped
into the bay from the Jackson-street wharf
about a week ago, as decomposition had
set in. The body was poorly dressed and
nothing was found by which he could be
identified.
ER. HALL'S INGRATITUDE.
Judge Conlan Fines Him 850 for Bat
tery Upon John Sunith.
Dr. S. H. Hall appeared in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday morning to answer
the charge of battery preferred against him
by John Smith, coal-dealer, 327 Sutter
street.
During Dr. Hall's incarceration in the
County Jail pending his trial for criminal
malpractice Smith supplied his wife with
coai amounting altogether to $2,150. On
Wednesday Smith met Hall on Mont
gomery avenue and asked him for pay
ment of the bill. Hall replied by knock
ing Smith down.
Hall pleaded his own case and on the
witness-stand he said that Smith had
called him a "baby-killer" before he
knocked him down. He would not permit
any man to apply such a epithet to him.
In answer to the Judge he said he had
gone through the insolvency court and
Smith's bill was included among the
others. The Judge remarked that he
thought Hall had made a very poor return
for Smith's kindness in furnishing his wife
with coal while he was in jail.
The Judge sentenced Hall to pay a fine
of $. r >o or fifty days in the County Jail. The
fine was paid.
THE KNIGHTS OF CHESS.
How tlie Players Stand in the Tourna
ment at the Mechanics' Institute.
The grand chess tournament which is
now being played at the Mechanics' Insti
tute lias aroused much enthusiasm, in
local chess circles. Thirty-two players
entered the lists, many of whom, as may
be seen from the following names, are of
more than average ability: Samuels,
Franklin, Cnrtis, Thompson, Epstein,
McClure, Nevill, Ott, Durkin, Hirsch,
Condon, Stein and Martin, all of whom
played in the first class. The second class
includes H. Epstein, Chilton, Spanlding,
Cutting, Harding, Schnman, Walker, F.
Burnett. In the third and fourth classes :
Boxall, Muller, Thomas, Torres, Mac-
Leod, Newman, Miehl, G. Burnett, Den
ton, Keynolds. The last four metioned
comprise the fourth class.
The results up to yesterday evening were
as follows: Nevill, Hirsch, S. Epstein,
Martin, Spaulding, Harding, Schuman, P.
Burnett, Muller, Thomas, Newman Miel,
G. Burnett and Reynolds succumbed to
their several opponents In the first round.
The second round so far has thrown out
Cutting and Stein, who were defeated by
Handon and McClure respectively.
Perhaps the most interesting game yet
contested occurred, between O. Samuels
and G. it. Thompson yesterday afternoon.
The recognized ability and rivalry be
tween these two players drew a large num
ber of spectators. The contest proved an
exciting one and the attack which was
played by Thompson finally won.

NEW TO-DAY.
â  In the filling of prescriptions the average â  person
is in the dark as to the cost and the contents of the
medicine, consequently has to rely on the honesty
and reliability of the Druggist who dispenses the
drugs. The majority of the Druggists of San
Francisco pay a commission of 25 to 50 per cent to
the physicians who . send their prescriptions to
them. This being the case, how can the "Com- j
mission Druggist" be honest? For instance, a j
physician writes a prescription for one bottle IJs- ]
I terine, regular price 75c bottle (actual wholesale
! cost 66c). On this the Commission Druggist
"dlvies" with the pliysician 25 or 50 per cent. To
a person on the outside It looks as If the Druggist
was out and injured. BUT HE IS NOT. He just
substitutes a vile imitation of Listerlne costing 50c
per gallon. There are, on the other hand, a re-
spectable class of physiciansâ and they are nu-
merous â who will not accept commission from any
Druggist. This element of the profession we cater
to and have their entire confidence, as they know
we take no liberties with their prescriptions, filling
all prescriptions exactly as ordered and pay no
commission to any doctors. The confidence In us
held by the public of San Francisco is proven by
the fact that we dispensed over 30,000 prescriptions
in 1895, ft larger number than dispensed by any
store in the State. - ..

FATHER YORKE
TO DR. WENDTE
The Chancellor's Continued
Answer to the
Unitarian
ON CHURCH AND STATE.
Catholic Doctrine on this Great
Question Extensively
Defined.
SAYS DR. WENDTE IS IN EKEOR.
Father Yorke Contrasts the Views of
the Church With the American
System of Law.
Rer. Father Yorke contributes another
letter in answer to Dr. Wendte. It is as
follows:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: The
second subject which the Rev. Dr. Wendte
undertook to discuss was "The Doctrine of
Civil Government Held by the Catholic Church,
as Contrasted With Our American and Secular
Theory of Church and ttate." lhe six letters
which he wrote on this point form a mass of
miscellaneous information unparalleled I be
lieve in the annais of controversy. The dis
orderly and unscientific manner in which Dr.
Wendte presented his arguments renders a
logical classification of them a matter of much
difficulty. This difficulty is much increased by
the tendency to digression to which he gave
himself up," especially in his iater letters. I
must, therefore, in the first place rescue the
relevant matter from the rubbish in which it
Is hidden, and then, sweeping all this rubbish -
together, form it into a second part treating of
almost every subject under the sun, from free
dom of conscience to the architect of Dr.
Wendte's pantaloons.
The first part of this letter, therefore, will be
occupied with a revision of Dr. Wendte's argu
ments on the relations subsisting between
I. CHURCH AND STATE.
Dr. Wendte opened the discussion by pro
pounding what he considered the Catholic
doctrine on the relations between church and
state- That doctrine was entirely erroneous,
and in answer, 1 explained the teachings of
Catholic philosophers at length. Hence the
first part of the review falls naturally under
two heads.
A. The false teaching attributed by Dr.
Wendte to the church.
B. The true teaching as set forth by Catholic
authorities.
A. WHAT CATHOLICS DO NOT BELIEVE.
Dr. Wendte explained the Roman Catholic
doctrine as "the supremacy of the church and
the subordination of the state to it." rte said
practically that Catholics believed in a "theoc
cracy." "The classical example for it is the
system of the Papacy and the canon laws of
the Roman Catholic Church. Since the time
of Gregory VII the Catholic church has taught
that there can be no sovereign political
authority nor any independence for the in
dividual beyond the limits iixed by the
ecclesiastical power."
To back up this misstatement of our doctrine
Dr. Wendte gave what he aliegod to be:
1. The philosophical argument.
2. The Roman canon law.
3. Declarations of recent Popes.
4. Declarations of eminent modern Cathol ics.
5. Actions and principles of Catholics in
America.
6. Actions and principles of Catholics abroad.
It was evident irom the very -beginning that
Dr. W r endte was not familiar with Catholic au
thorities. Indeed, he confesses as much him
self and makes the confession in such a way
as to put him outside the pale of serious con
troversy. He is utterly incompetent to state
what Catholic teaching is, because he has
never read that Catholic teaching authorita
tively set forth. He does not seem to realize
that quotations taken at fourtn and fifth hand
are never reliable and that a scholar would
sooner cut off his right hand than use them.
The fact that Dr. Wendte has used them and
trios to defend his method shows that he has
been trained rather to sustain his master's
opinion than to seek truth scientifically and
for himself.
Let us now examine the six proofs which he
produced to show that his statement of Catholic
belief was accurate.
1. THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT.
Dr. Wendte contends that "the Pope is the
sovereign of the world and that all must sub
mit to his dictation." He gives the following
sentiment from Bishop Gilmour as the Catholic
argument for the Catholic claim:
"The state is for the body, the church is for
the soul. But the soul Is superior to the body,
hence the church is above the state."
I replied that this argument proved nothing.
It Is a statement common enough in Catholic
and Protestant writers, but is no more alleged
to prove the sovereignty of the Pope than it is
to prove the sovereignty ot the man in the
moon. The fact that the church is superior to
the state in the sense that the soul is superior
to the body does not show that the church
possesses or claims supreme temporal
power. Superior may mean higher
in Jurisdiction or greater in excel
lence. If I Fay a peasant is superior to
many a king I do not mean that the peasant
has jurisdiction over the king, 1 mean simply
that he is of greater worth. When 1 say mat
the church is superior to the slate because the
church deals with the soul, which is worth
more than the body, with which the state
deals, no sensible man will imagine that I con
sider the church to have jurisdiction over the
state.
I believe that my profession is superior to
that of a lawyer. I base my belief on the fact
that clergymen aim at the welfare of the soul
â lawyers at the welfare of the body politic.
The soul's interests are superior to temporal
interests, and, therefore, the calling oi the
priest is superior to the calling of the jurist.
Is there any one outside of an insane asylum
who will ascribe to me the opinion that the
judges on the bench are bound to do my bid
ding?
when Bishop Gilmour says the church is
superior to the state, because the soul is supe
rior to the body, neither he nor any other
bishop ever Imagined that this superiority
would be produced as a claim to temporal
sovereignty.
To this reply to his philosophical argument
Dr. Wendte vouchsafed no answer except the
pitying comment that 1 make a very "poor
showing."
2. ROHAN CANON LAW.
After this very remarkable piece of ratiocin
ation Dr. Wendte undertook to quote canon
law. The doctor does not appear to have the
faintest idea of the meaning of the term, be
cause in the long series of citations which he
labels with the term there is not a* solitary
sentence which pertains to canon law. He is
at much at sea on the signification of canon
law as he was on the signification of physiol
ogy.
All these alleged quotations were taken from
a book entitled "The Spirit of the Papacy,"
â written by John S. Hittell, one of the many
hand-me-down scholars that plague this coast.
Hence I was compelled to deal with Hittell and
thus grew up the
INTERLUDE OF THE HOARY HUMBUG.
Among many charges against the authen
ticity ot Hittell's quotations, which charge*
will come up later, there was one of downright
lorgery. In one of his books Doeilinger de
scribed the doctrine held by a certain Tolomeo
of Lucca. Doellinger did not quote Tolomeo,
but gave in his (Doellinger's) own words what
he conceived Tolomeo p teaching to be. Hit
tell deliberately look Doellinger's words,
adorned them with inverted commas and put
them in the mouth of Thomas Aquinas.
Of course I called Hittell a forger.
Dr. Wendte retorted by saying that I hated
Hittell because he wan an infidel, and he added
that the said Hittell was "a man of high moral
Erobity, of wide learning and of scholarly
abits."
In my next letter I reiterated my charge that
Hittell whs guilty of forgery. Â»
To this Hilteil answered in propria pprsona
and asserted that his quotation was correct
"My forgery consists in quoting word for
word from Doellinger in the English transla
tion."
Whereupon I put Hittell's quotation and
Doellinger iv thu English translation in pa
rallel columns. The juxtaposition justified
my charge.
Hittell answered that he understood "Doel
linger to hold Aquinas responsible for the
ideas written by his (Aquinas') partner in a
book which the two composed conjointly."
From the very same page of Doellinger in
the English translation 1 showed that Aquinas
had been dead a quarter of a century before
bin "partner" wrote the book in question.
ExftHittcll.
Dr. Wendte merely lamented that my man
ners were very rude.
In the mean time, while this interesting and
Instructive eDisode was running its course, I
took up the alleged quotations from the canon
law and examined tnem separately, with the
fallowing result:
(a) THE CODE OF GRATIAN.
Dr. Wendte quoted the code of Gratian as
part of the canon law and as something to
which every one owes obedience as declaring j
that the I'ope alone gives power and efficacy j
to every law.
I repHed that the code of Gratian was merely j
a textbook, and I denied that Gratian said that
the Pope jrave efficacy to civil law. â¢
Dr. Wendte responded that I had an "arro
gant and unlovely temper."
(b) THOMAS AQUINAS.
The history of the fate of Thomas Aquinas is
told in the diverting interlude of the Hoary
Humbug.
Dr. Wendte, however, was determined not to
let the saint escape. If he could not be hanged
for "pitch and toss" Dr. Wendte resolved to
hang him for manslaughter. Therefore ho de
clared. "Perhaps Aquinas did not say that, but
he <iiÂ«i say that all heretics ought to be put to j
death."
A consideration of this logical and beautiful
answer 1 defer to the second part. The burn
ing of heretics has nothinK to do with the the
ory of the relations of superiority pf church
an"a state. 1 will, therefore, examine it when
I come to sort the contents of the rubbish
heap.
(C) BELLARMINE.
Next in Dr. Wendte's procession came Bellar
mine. He was made to say that the Pope had
supreme temporal power.
I found on examination that Wendte had
quoted from Hilteil, who had quoted from
Kunke, who had quoted from Beliarmine. I
found, too, that Ranke distinctly said. "Bellar
inine does not go so far hs to ascribe to ihe
Pope as of divine right adirect secular power."
Dr. Wendte rejoined by calling on Hiitell to
answer for the citation.
Hittell answered not.
Dr. Wendte added, Bellarmine was a dishon
est character and that he said. "Heretics when i
strong are to be commended to God, when i
weak they are to be committed to the execu
tioner."
I defied Dr. Wendte to tell me when and
where hellarmine gave utterance to that mon
strous sentiment.
Dr. Wendte promised to gratify mo soon, but
finally acknowledged he had not marked the
reference in the notes he took at Hnrvard years
! ago. However, he said if Bellarmine did not
I say that, he held that heretical kings could be
killed at sight.
I advised him to burn his Harvard notes.
He retorted. "I am tired of being belabored
{ with accusations of fraud and dishonesty and
j epithets neither just nor polite by my angry
] opponent."
The question of killing heretic kings is re
served lor the rubbish heap.
(Cf) POPE INNOCENT 111.
Dr. Wendte quoted Innocent 111 as claiming
the government of the whole world.
I verified the quotation and found that In
nocent was speaking of the spiritual primacy
of the Pope.
Dr. Wendte answered never a word.
(c) NICHOLAS I.
Dr. Wendte cited Pope Nicholas I as pro
pounding a most extreme form of the "Divine
Right of Kings." a doctrine not known until
after the Reformation. Dr. Wendte had
! quoted from Hittell, who had quoted trom
Cormenin, a French Protestant minister, who
gave no reference.
By supplying the words from Cormenin that
Hittell had dishonestly suppressed I demon
| stratfed that the extract was an obvious fraud.
; I examined all the letters of Nichplas I extant
! and found nothing even resembling Corme
i nin's quotation.
Dr. Wendte called on Hittell to take care of
the quotation.
Hittell didn't.
Dr. Wendte whooped In rebuttal: "In vain
do you attempt to discredit Protestant scholar
ship."
(/) GREGORY VII.
Dr. Wendte accused Gregory VII of writing to
a Roman synod that he could give and tate
away the dignities and possessions of men.
I found that the doctor quoted Hittell, who
quoted Janus, who quoted Mansi, who quoted
Gregory VII.
I showed that Janus did not say that Greg
ory wrote these words to a Roman synod, and j
j I showed moreover that the words" given by
: Janus were by Gregory said of the saints in
j heaven.
Dr. Wendte answered that I was trying to
drive all decent men out of the controversy
by my savage r racks.
(</} 'JKEGOHY VII AGAIN.
Dr. Wendte quoted Hittell to demonstrate
that Gregory claimed feudal dominion over
several European princes.
I replied that feudalism was a purely political
institution of the middle age; that kings en
! tered on the feudal relation toward the Holy
j See voluntarily and for the sake of substantial
i advantages; that the relation had nothing to
â¢ do with the Pope's spiritual character, and
! that it ceased to exist with the abolition of
feudalism.
Dr. Wendte answered that my replies were
"characteristic of an attorney who has a weak
case to defend."
(A) ADRIAN* IV.
Dr. Wendte produced the bull of Adrian IV
giving Ireland to Henry 11.
If mat bull was genuine, and I believe its
spuriousuess has been proved beyond reason
j able doubt, still it had nothing to do with Dr.
I Wendte's argument. I explained that by the
political constitution of Europe in the Middle
Ages the Pope was recognized as a supreme I
courton temporals by the public jurisprudence I
I and I quoted the. words of Pius IX to snow that j
this function, based on "the common consent |
of Dations," had passed away. The acts done I
in accordance with that power prove nothing !
concerning the relations of the Popes to the !
Governments of to-day.
Dr. Wendte retired behind nls theological
cook and declared she was more likely to
know where truth lay than the sophisticated
minds of priests.
(t) PAUL IV.*
Dr. Wendte quoted Paul IV as claiming su
preme power over thrones and nations.
As usual Dr. Wendte quoted Hittell, who
gave no reference.
I looked up the Bullarium and stated that
the words in Inverted comas were invented by
John S. Hittell.
Hittell "evidently had enough of Thomas
Aquinas and though Dr. Wendte called on him
to verify his quotation Hittell remained as
dumb as an oyster.
Dr. Wendte "remarked that I was "unfitted
for the calm judicial treatment of a disputed
question."
(j) GREGORY IX.
Dr. Wendte produced a le tter from Gregory IX
to Frederick 11, in which the Pope claimed that
| even kings 6hould submit to the guidance of
i priests.
As there was nothing in the quotation to
j show that anything was meant except spiritual
guidance, I contented myself with the general
answer given in the description of the relations
between the Pope and tne Emperor laid down
by the civil law of Europe in the Middle Ages.
Dr. Wendte says I make up in verbosity what
I lack in argument.
(Jfc) BONIFACE VIII.
Evidently Dr. Wendte considered the Bull
Unam Sanqtam as one of his strongest points
I thought that in explaining the Catholic
theory of the relations between church and
State and the relations between the Pope and
the Emperor, as laid down by medieval juris
prudence, I had explained the true meanin* of
that document. But Dr. Wendte was not sat
isfied. He came into the arena a second time
brandishing the Bull and dealing death and
destruction to my arguments.
Though smarting under the accusation of
verbosity I was compelled, therefore, to enter
on a lengthy explanation of this bull and to
show that Dr. Wendte's description of its con- i
tents was both misleading and untrue. From
an examination of the text I made evident !
that
1. The "definition," or that part which is
"of faith" and must be accepted by all Catho
lics, deals with the universal spiritual primacy
of the Pope over the church.
2. In the argumentation in the body of the
document, which argumentation, of course, is
not of faith, Boniface showed the distinction
of the spiritual and temporal power".
3. He declared that the spiritual power '
was wielded by the church, the temporal by
the State. J j
4. He declared that the temporal power j
should be guided by the moral law, natural !
and revealed.
5. He declared that the civil authority should i
protect the rights of the church.
1 stated that these principles were all acted j
on iv America to-day, and that they were
doubly applicable in a condition of society
like that oi the middle ages, when all Europe
was Catholic and there was no separation of
Church and State.
Dr. Wendte said no more about the Bull
Unam Sanctam, but he modestly declared: "I
do not intend to claim any personal victory "
It will be seen from this review that Dr
Wendte made a dismal failure of the attempt
to prove the claim of ecclesiastical supremacy
over civil affairs from what he denominated
canon law. In order, however, to make some
6how at defending the "accuracy of Protestant
scholarship" about which he boasted so loud
ly and so long he had recourse to what I can
only call
"POISONING THE WEI^."
When dealing with his so-called quotations
from Catholic authorities I had recourse to
the only means allowed among scholars to test
the* value of the^e quotations. I hunted up the
references, obtained the original authorities
and carefully compared the citation with the
text. Hence it was that I was able to speak
confidently and with authority on the genu
ineness or relevancy of these sentiments.
Dr. Wendte tried to break the force of this
damaging disclosure of the Brummaecm char
acter of his erudition by calling all Catholic
writers liars and forgers. He wrote, -I regret
to say, Roman Catholic historians and uog
matists are not always trustworthy where the
interests of their church are involved." In his
lagt letter he returns to the charge, and speaks
of the "garbled and imperfect editions which
the Catlioiic church sometimes employs."
It is evident that if this accusation be true
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
all my words go for nothing. If Catholics are
untrustworthy and if they prepare spurious
editions to deceive Protestants then we tire the
basest of men. â < If Dr. .Weadte believes his own
accusation why did he ' undertake to argue*
â with me? II mv authorities are mutilated, my
editions garbled, my quotations* forged, then I
am beneath contempt. But if ; Dr.;, Wendte
makes this charge without | reason, Mr. Editor,
and thus attempts . to destroy the credit of my
words beforehand, to - cut the ground from
under my feet, to infuse into the imaginations
of ; your ..: readers f suspicion ana mistrust of
everything 1 1 may say in reply to him, then to
use the words of Newman, he is guilty of the
cowardly and unmanly crime of poisoning the
wells. :.
ROMAN FORGERIES.
- To give some : evidence for the truth of his
charge. Dr. Wendte appealed to J* Janus," who,
he asserted, exposed "the literary forgeries of
the Roman church, on which, in large degree,
it bases its pretensions to divine right and ab
solute rule. These fabrications are quite well
known to Roman Catholic scholars, and are
yet defended, passed over in, silence or;con
doned by them,' while the church continues to
make use of these fictitious documents to es
tablish itself in both spiritual and wordly
power." :â -Â£, â¢ .â¢'
Now, as a matter of fact, the first to expose
the forgeries to which -Janus alludes were
Catholics,' and that long- before the Reforma
tion. From the very beginning ot Christianity
sagas and- legends had sprung up attaching
themselves to the Apostles, the martyrs I and
men of note in the church. As Professor Ram
say remarks in his book just published, "Paul,
the Roman Citizen and Traveler," these tales"
were intended to take: the place of the often
times impure novels or stories in which the
pagan world delighted.
It is absurd to state â â¢ that these documents
were forgeries i and wicked inventions. One
might as well accuse our popular historical
novelists as guilty of this crime. Daring the
dark ages, - so-called, â ; these tales , and docu
,ments received a certain belief, but it would
be jnst as critical to say that the legend of
George Washington and his little hatchet was
invented to support the supremacy of the Fed
eral Government as to shy that the stories of
the Donation of Constantine were Invented to
support the primacy of the Roman Pontiff.
It is demonstrable by the clearest evidence
that these sagas and legends were not the bases
of the Roman church's claim to the primacy,
but that the fact of the primacy obtained for
these legends a certain credence. It is also
demonstrable that the church does not use
these forgeries to substantiate their claims.
Moreover it is absolutely, untrue to say that
Roman . Catholic scholars defend or condone
these spurious documents. As I have already
remarked, their true nature was demonstrated
at a time when there were no scholars but
Roman Catholic.
However, even if it were true, as Dr. Wendte
asserts, that the historical claims of the Papacy
are based on forgery, can he show that 1 have
used them? The observant reader will readily
note that the forgeries in this discussion have
been all on the side of Dr. Wendte. He, not I,
has cited garbled extracts and spurious de
crees. He has not b^n able to breathe even
a suspicion â  against thÂ» authenticity of a
single passage quoted by me, wnile the greater
part of my time has been taken up in showing:
how he has doctored and gerrymandered the
utterances of Catholics. â¢â¢â¢â â '
To complete his task of poisoning the wells,
Dr. Wendte cited tne case of a certain abbe who
discovered that Roman Catholic authorities
were garbled, falsified and untrustworthy, and
who in consequence became a Protestant. I
asked Dr. Wendte for the name of the abbe, hut
Dr. Wendte refuses to give it, under the plea
that the old man does not wish to be perse
cuted. This unfair insinuation against Catho
lics is characteristic only of congenital mean
ness. Let me inform Dr. Wendte that his in
formant has lived here for years without per
secution, tnough every one knows him. Let
me inform him, too, that the story is too
'â¢sweet" to be wholesome. â  If the "abbe" will
give the name of the. book which he found
falsified I can have the whole matter examined
in the British Museum. Until Dr. Wendte's
informant does this, I am compelled to credit
tke common rumor for the cause of his defec
tion. I consider it beneath the dignity of a
scholar and a gentleman to make charges
against the trustworthiness or honesty of a
great church on anonymous testimony, and I
imagine that Dr. Wendte would have bettered
his cause if he had given facts instead of re
tailing gossip. -
Let me repeat that this sweeping charge of
untrustworthiness in which Dr. Weudte in
dulges is a cowardly subterfuge. â  It iis par
alleled only by the device of the sneakthief
who, when tried for stealing a lady's purse, at
tempts to escape by aspersing his accuser's
honor. .
- 3. DECLARATIONS OF RECENT POPES.
To prove that the Catholic church teaches
that the state is in temporal matters subordi
nated to the church Dr. Wendte quoted the ut
terances of some recent Popes.
(a) Leo XIII.
He asserted that Leo XIII Had said words
which warranted us in believing that the
Papacy if it had its way would soon suppress
free government.' . >; â¢' ' '
1 showed by means of the deadly parallel that
Dr. Wenate had mutilated Leo's sentence by
suppressing half of it and that the suppressed
clause expressly stated that the church could
use, only the moral means which every sect
employs to-day. " â¢ â¢
- Dr. Wendte excused himself by saying that
he shortened the sentence in the interests |of
brevity, and he proceeded incontinently to go
into hysterics about the bloody persecutions
of the church of Rome.
For these persecutions see the Rubbish Heap.
(6) Pius IX and Gregory XVI. Dr. Wendte
next quoted what he called the "Evangelical"
and syllabus of Plus IX as condemning free
schools, a free science, a free press, liberty of
conscience and of religious worship.
All of which, including that specimen of
"physiology" the "Evangelical and syllabus,"
as having nothing to do with the civil supre
macy of the church are hereby consigned to
the Rubbish Heap.
Dr. Wendte's endeavor, therefore, to prove
from the modern. Popes tnat the church
claims civil supremacy over the state only
demonstrated that he was ready to garble
quotations to bolster up a bad cause. * . :-â 
4. DECLARATIONS OF MODERN CATHOLICS.
Dr. Wendte now produced the sayings of
certain eminent, modern Catholics as testi
monies that we are seeking to control the
state. Let us sec how his witnesses fared.
(a) Louis Veutllot. ,
The editor of the Paris Univers was first
called to the stand. His sentiments were that
Catholic principles denied free speech. :â 
What this has to do with the supremacy of
the church I do not know, but I asked Dr.
Wendte to produce his authority for ascribing
this statement to Veuillot.
Dr. Wendte . replied, "I am not fond of con
troversy."
' (b) Doctor Brownson.
Then Dr. Wendte quoted the Catholic Re
view and Dr. Brownson .as saying that
Protestantism had no rights where Catholicism
was triumphant.
â  In reply, I remarked that Brownson had
nothing to do with the Catholic Review and
I demanded the. date of the quotation.
Dr. Wendte retorts that it is wrong to sneer
at cooks and tailors.
(c) Bishop Gilmour. 1
Dr. Wendte then: produced Bishop Gilmour
as saying .that ''Nationalities . must be made
subordinate to religion." :
I explained the sentence as a rebuke 'to a
movement which was then on foot to divide
the Catholics ot this country into various Na
tional groups. ; â¢ > â 
, Dr. Wendte replied by quoting more of the
pastoral, which completely justified my expla
nation. :â â¢â .' â ". .'â ", ; â -â  - â  â :. â .â  *--.â  â â  â â  ..â â  â â¢â  â 
But Dr. Wendte insisted; "the Bishop says,'
'We owe unqualified â  obedience to the state in
all that does Dot conflict with the law of God'
and this is treason." ' â¢
Does Dr. Wendte wish us to obey man rather
than God? Is, there a conscientious man: on
the.f ace of the earth who will break what he
considers to be God's law for any one? â :
But says Dr. Wendte, the Bishop was opposed
to our public schools. - .-â =â . Âr.
Respectfully referred to the Key. Father
Gleason or the Rev. Father White. ,
(d) Cardinal Newman. . .
Then Dr. Wendte flew at higher game. He
quoted Cardinal Newman as authority for the
deduction that no Catholic could take an oath
of allegiance without the consent of Rome. , v
I showed that Newman was speaking of a
certain i well-defined instance, in . which Â« the
ridiculous policy of the English Government
in refusing to deal directly with the Holy See
got them into trouble. â  * :-â â . -.: ;,--
Dr. Wendte threw the burden on Gladstone
who states that pledges were given by the
Roman Catholics of England -to obtain relief
from persecution, which pledges were deliber
ately broken afterward.
In answer : I stated that Gladstone ' was
proved in the Spectator of March, 1875 to
have made a blunder from which a few hours'
reading of Hansard | would have I saved him.
Gladstone's contention, was that the Roman
â  Catholics in 1781 declared that they did not
I believe in Papal infallibility and ; that .it was
on this condition they were relieved of -certain
disabilities.'- This assertion was not true In
reality the Catholics refused to accept relief
under such : conditions v and the *-. Catholic
prelates : petitioned Parliament not to grant
relief under a misapprehension as to the real
teaching of the church. : So much for. Glad
stone. â¢ . ;> r : " â¢ .- . r .Â» - - ;â¢
U) Father Jouin. .
In his fourth letter on the relations of church
and state Dr. Wendte produced a textbook by
rl.li? cV 'i Lo Â£ Â»Â£ V i "- In order to; rove < that
California Catholics were : taught that z the
church has civil authority over the state Dr.
endte clamly suppressed a plain | statement
by Jouin that the ; 'church; wields a spiritual
power only." : â  Â» â : â¢â  : â¢ â¢ -."- â¢
:..%When I called his attention to this peculiar
manipulation -.; of â  authorities , he : merely pro
ceeded to quote .more Jouin, as usual garbling
it. and leaving out significant passages. Thus
he beitan his extract ; in the middle of a para
graph; the opening sentences of which are:
"The *â  normal condition of â¢ society, requires
that both church and state should act in har
mony, -, hat i there ; should ibe union . among
them. This union consists v neither iin , the
absorption of the state by the church nor in
the subjection of the church to state control,
but in the mutual co-operation of both, each
remaining in its own spnere.' 1
These two sentences Dr. Wendte suppressed
because; they contradict his statements about
Catholic teaching. Jouin is heTe dealing with
the "normal" or "ideal" state, and he takes it
lor granted that all the citizens are members
of the one church, yet even in such a case he
"ipclares that the church cannot absorb tne
state.
Tnen Jouin jroes on to say that the laws of
the state must be based on the moral and re
vealed law. This is a truism. In America the
state accepts the revealed Christian law as the
basis of legislation. Whence does the state ac
cept it, if not from the Christian church ? Take
the case of polygamy. There is nothing in
political reason to condemn this practice. All
the non-Christian states allow it. It is forbid
den in America because the Christian churches
insisted that polygamy was opposed to Chris
tian morality and that Christian morality is
tne basis of our legislation. Does this prove
that the churches in America have civil juris
diction over the state ?
But, says Dr. Wendte, Jouin holds thatjin
doubtful cases the ohurch must prevail. Dr.
Wendte designedly obscures Jouin's supposi
tion that the "doubtful case" referred to is a
question of morals and that he is speaking of
laws binding on the conscience.
Now let me ask Dr. W>ndte if the state com
manded him to marry half a dozen wives at the
same time, would he consider himself conscien
tiously bound to obey. If he believes as he
says that the state has the right to fix the
bounds of its own jurisdiction, he would be
compelled to commit hexagamy at once. Is
not tltis a reductio ad aburduin of his theory?
Jouin holds, like every sensible man, that
church and state are essentially separate, that
the laws of the state should be modeled on
God's law; that if collisions arise, they are to
be settled on their merits, bearing in mind the
principle that all things temporal belong ex
clusively to the state, and things spiritual to
the church, and finally, that if the state begins
to interfere with the conscience and wake
laws which violate the moral sense of the
Christian people, that these laws do not bind
in conscience, and Christians should do their
very best to have them repealed.
1 need scarcely remark that these are princi
ples on which the American people have al
ways acted. If Dr. Wendte will read the his
tory of the abolition movement he will realize
the Justice of my statement.
Neither Jouin's theory nor the American
practice proves, however, that the church has
or claims civil jurisdiction over the state.
From the foregoing it is evident that Dr.
Wendte was bb unsuccessful with modern
Catholics as he was with ancient Popes. In
deed, the only Catholic book he appears to
have seen is Jouin, and Jouin he deliberately
garbles and misrepresents. But his armory is
not yet exhausted, und he appeals to
Fifthâ The principles and actions of Catho
lics in America.
Though the Catholic church has been here
since the foundation of the Republic, Dr.
Wendte is able to bring against us but two
charges, one of which is untrue and the other
is a calumny.
(a) Church property.
He asserts that the property of the Catholic
church is held absolutely by one person, the
Bishop, and by him only as the representative
of a foreign ruler. Moreover he says the church
denies the right to the state to interfere with
this property even when the welfare of the
community demands it.
I beg to say that these statements are not
true.
1. The property of the Catholic church is
held in trust for the Catholic people, hi accord
ance with the laws of the various States. As
far as I am aware the laws of no two States are
alike. In New York the bulk of the church
property is held by boards of trustees erected
by a special act of "the Legislature. In the arch
diocese of San Francisco the diocesan property
is held by a corporation sole known as the
Archbishop of San Francisco and constituted
under our laws. Nearly every religious com
munity is an independent corporation, as are
also the principal institutions, such as the
orphan asylums, the seminary, the hospitals.
2. It is true that certain properties may be
entered in the Bishop's name, but they are
held by him not as a representative of the Pope
who could not realize 10 cents on all the church
property in America, but as a representative of
the Catholic people, to whom the property
belongs.
3. It is not trne that the church denies the
right of the State to interfere with this property
for tne welfare of the people. Can Dr. Wendte
produce a single incident to show that the
Catholic church has refused to obey the general
or local regulations touching property? The
church, it is true, protests against robbery and
spoliation, but she protests against it in the
spirit of the American constitution which pro
vides that the right of eminent domain shall
not be exercised unless reasonable compensa
tion be made. Dr. Wendte should remember
that the robbery of the churcn has never yet
benefited the people.
(6) Priests in politics.
Dr. Wendte states that clerical ambition is
one of the dangers against which America
must guard, and that in every election poli
ticians are compelled to reckon with the in
.fluence of the Catholic church.
Concerning this statement allow me to say
that it is a cruel and baseless calumny.
1. I believe that there is no class of men in
America to-day who are less animated by po
litical aspirations than the Catholic clergy.
54. I know as a matter of my own knowledge
that the charge that priests influence their
parishioners to vote thU way or that is a false
hood.
3. I know that for every priest, who may
take even a platonic interest in politics, there
are a thousand preachers up to their necks in
the mire.
4. I know that the influence of the Roman
Catholic church is not cast one wav or an
other in elections, and the man who claims he
can control or use or sway such influence, be
he priest or layman, is a liar and the truth is
not in him.
5. Finally, I know that there is no class of
people In the world so quick to resist clerical
dictation or influence in politics ns Catholics.
1 am firmly convinced that if I did what
preachers have done here and in Oakland and
called r meeting of Catholics to-morrow in
this City and urged them to vote -this way or
that I would be pelted off the stuge with rot
ten eggs. And I would deserve It.
6. Dr. Wendte traverses the whole habitable
globe to prove that Catholics are an unruly lot
and always in conflict with the civil power.
In answer I took up one exampleâ Germany.
I described the nature of the laws apaink
which Catholics protested. Dr. Wendte was
ashamed to say any more in defense of Bis
marck.
I repeat now what Jouin asserted, that in
every case of conflict between the church and
state, hinted at by Dr. Wendte, the state has
been the aggressor, and the church has been
fighting for these elementary rights which are
guaranteed the most insignificant congrega
tions in these United States.
So far now I have considered all the argn
ments which Dr. Wendte. produced to show
that Catholics claimed civil supremacy for the
church over state. Not one of these argu
ments was worth the paper on which it was
written.
If it be true as he asserts that the Catholics
believe in a "theocracy." surely it should not
be so difficult to prove it. Dr. Wendte has laid
every century under contribution, but in vain.
He is tiying to prove the thing that is not.
The doctrine of the Catholic church about
church and state is the doctrine held by
Americans, and every attempt to foist a dif
ferent belief upon us must of necessity prove
futile.
As this review of "What Catholics Do Not
Believe" has extended far beyond the limits, I
will defer the review of "What Catholics Do
Believe" and the inquisition into the "rubbish
heap" for another letter. Yours truly,
P. C. Yobkb.
TROLLEY TRIPPERS.
Bis Times at the Grounds Planned for
To-Day â Parachute Drop Out of
the Ordinary.
The pleasant weather has entirely reju
venated the water-chutes on Haight street,
and now the boats cannot go fast enough
and the trolleys cannot be put upon the
cable often enongh to uccommodate the
â¢'chute shooters" and "trolley trippers."
On account of the great crush of last Sun
day, it has been decided to open the
grounds at 10 o'clock this morning, and
from that time on until 11 at night the
boats will ruph down the- long slide and
the trolley will be tripped.
At 4 6'clock in tile afternoon Emil
Mttrkeberg, the little German aeronaut,
will make a balloon ascension and para
chute drop, hanging by his teeth. He has
made a number of ascensions at the chutes
and with unitorm success. Open-air con
certs will be given afternoon and evening,
and after the sun goes down the grounds
will be illuniinated with hundreds of col
ored incandescent lights.
Fred Kinerson Brooks.
Fred Emerson Brooks, the California poet
and humorist, who has been absent from this
State some seven or eight years, and who has
made such a splendid record on Eastern plat
forms, will appear in unique entertainment
with his partner, Mr. Mflcy, buffo-basso, at the
Young Men's Christian Association audito
rium, Mason and Ellis streets, next Thursday
evening at 8 o'clock. They will be sure of a
large aad appreciative audience.
Fire In a Dwelling.
An alarm was turned in through box 175, at
4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, for a fire In a
two-story frame dwellinir-house at 722 Grove
street, occupied by A. S. Brethout. The cause
of the fire was the careless use ol matches.
The house was damaged to the extent of about
$100, which is fully covered by insurance.
FRED GARDNER IN FRONT.
Proved a Surprise in the Gover
nor Budd Stake at
Ingleside.
BACE-GOEBS OUT IN NUMBEBS.
Several Upsets During the DayâLo
gan Beaten Out by Wheel of
Fortune.
The superstitioualy Inclined were sadly
out of line at the races yesterday. A big
crowd journeyed out to IngJeside to see
the rich Governor Budd stake, over a mile
and a half, run off, and of course many of
them were firm believers in signs, Jonahs
and hoodoos. As a mark of courtesy to
A. B. Spreckels, president of the new
jockey clnb, the silken bag containing the
purse that is always suspended from the
wire in stake events at the new course,
was yesterday a blending of red, white and
blue, the colors sported by the horses
owned by Mr. Spreckels. Six horses were
entered to contest for the $1500 prize that
went to the winner, which was run under
selline conditions, and when 4 to 5 was
posted againsr the Spreckels pair, Cadmus
and imp. Candid, the bookies were besieged
with coin.
At post time 7 to 10 was the best
obtainable against the stable. The other
starters frere in no great demand, although
Fred Gardner was backed down a couple
of points from 9, and a light play made
the books cut the long price against
Flirtilla. Claudius, the second choice, was
quoted at 4, 6 to 5 and 1 to 2. When tbe
bugle called the horses out and they pa
raded past the stand all looked fit to race
for a kingdom. They were" sent away at
the first breakaway, with Dungarven,
Flirtilla and Candid showing in front,
Flirtilla and Candid went out to make tne
running, heading the field from the stand
and into the backstretch. When nearly
a mile had been covered Tod Sloan
on Fred Gardner made his move, and at
the far turn was leading Flirtilla and Can
did three lengths. At this stage Bergen
was nrging Cadmus, who was apparently
unable to respond. Headed for the wire
it looked a certainty for Fred Gardner, the
chestnut horse merely galloping, with all
of the others being urged by whip and
steel. Claudius made his usual stretch
run, passing Flirtilla, but only got within
hailing distance of the leader, who won as
he pleased by four lengths in 2:39. Flirtilla
hung on gamely, being beaten but a head
for the place.
The favorites did not have the easy thing
they did on Friday, for but three out of six
caught the eye of the judges first. The
racing throughout was excellent, and the
! big b.-tting ring was thronged with spec
tators.
The day's sport opened with a six-fur
long dash, for which Fortuna was a slight
favorite over Tbe Judge. The favorite
was away from the post last and finished
third. In a drive the third choice, Sea
I Spray, beat The Judge out half a length.
The folio wing race was also a six-furlong
: spin, the Corrigan entry Kowalsky having
first call in the betting at 8 to 5. The
youngster was away from the post none
too well, but gradually threaded his way
through the bunch and won at the end
cleverly by half a length. Minnie Ccc and
; Morven indulged in a rattling drive for the
! place, which the former secured by a head.
That shifty jumper, Burmah, from the
' stable of W. 08. Macdonough, stored
j again in the mile and a sixteenth handicap
s hurdle event. Even money was obtainable
against him throughout the betting. Mara
rated him along nicely, and he was walk
ing in when T. Murphy came with a rush
; on Nellie G, and, nearly catching Mara
i napping, was beaten out but half a lÂ«ngth.
i Silverado was third.
Old Logan had his colors lowered m the
mile and a sixteenth handicap Dy speedy
Wheel of Fortune. The betting was chiefly
confined to the pair, Moderoceo, Santiago
and Foremost coming in for^utsligut con
sideration. The "Wheel" was at one time
as pood as 3 to 2 in the betting, but
around post time was favorite at even
money, with 6 to 5 offered against the
"every-day' : horse. Grifh'n on Logan took
tl>e lead when the flag fell and was in front
to the stretch, when he had a clear lead of
a length with Harvey's mare, who had
moved up from last place an easy second.
She soon had her head in front of the Iron
horse, and in a drive beat him out a short
half length in 1:43)^. Foremost was a fair
third.
Liberal scratching reduced the field in

I:29VA- ,
the last event, a seven-furlong run, to six
starters. Ed Kearney was backed from
evens to 1 to 2, and after leading into the
stretch simply swinging was unable to re
spond to the challenge of the second choice,
Bueno, who romped past him and svon by
two lengths. The favorite was even beaten
out a head for the place by old Nephew.
Track and Paddock Items.
E. J. Baldwin has secured a new trainer.
Charles Green, who formerly trained for
Dan Honig and in his time owned some |
good racehorses, arrived from New |
Orleans on Friday and will take charge of j
the Santa Anita string.
George E. Smith (Pittsburg Phil) did I
not bear a pleasant look on his placid |
countenance after the last race. The book- i
makers began to rub when they perceived
him backing his horse Ed Kearney, and
3 to 5 was about the best he got.
At the conclusion of the race, when the
crowd in the betting-ring was thinning out
fast, the quiet plunger lingered longer.
George Rose, the bookmaker, standing
in front of his stand, espied the plunger
and accosted him with the remark: "Well,
Mr. Smith, my old horse beat you," re
ferring to Nephew, who headed Ed
Kearney out for the place. Pittsburg
Phil was not in good humor and smiled
dryly. He said: "Yes! but I would like
to bet you $1000 against $500 my horse can
beat yours at the same weights, on Mon- (
day."
Mr. Rose replied that he would like to
sell him Nephew for $500, but this answer
brought no response. Finally the penciler
told Phil that he would consult his trainer,
and if the latter thought advisable he
would make the match. Trainer Lottridge
was then consulted, and Tommy thinking
the little game old chestnut had a 1 to 2
chance, advised his employer to accept the
proposition. The consent of the jockey
club will be asked to-day to decide the
merits of the two horses, and to-morrow
the race-going public will have a chance
to see which bookmaker or plunger is the
shrewder matchmaker.
As though match-making were conta
gious, another match is also on tne tapia.
A crowd of horsemen were arguing the
merits of different horses at the Baldwin
Hotel last evening and Charley Quinn and
By Holly failed to agree on one point.
The Sage of Flosden is the possessor of
both Major Cook and Sir Richard. Quinn
was of the opinion that the Major could
beat the gray horse six furlongs, each to
carry 110 pounds. Mr. Holly thought
different, and a forfeit is up for a match at
$2500 a side. In event of it being con
summated. Major Cook will be turned
over to the care of Quinn.
EVOLUTION OF RAILS.
ThÂ« Southern Pacific 'introducing the
Latest Pattern That Wai Old
Tears Ago.
The Southern Paciric Company's engi
neers have introduced a new rail, which
represents the latest thing in * the evolu
tion of railroad engineering. The rail is
the product of practical experience rather
than a direct result of engineering thought
or science, and what appears particularly
remarkable about it is that this latest form
is almost an exact counterpart of the first
designs.
The new style of steel rail is being laid
oyer a stretch of twenty-ftve miles of track
across the San Goronio Pass, between Los
Angeles and the desert, at the rate of
about one-third of a mile a day. It is a
75-pound rail, calculated to stand the
greatest possible amount of wear and tear.
In chemical composition and form it is up
to date, being so constituted as to be
harder and tougher than ever before, and
flat on top and nearly half as wide again
as the old pattern, which is still in gen
eral use.
Such standards in railroad engineering
are set by the National Society of Civu
Engineers. For many years past this em
inent body heard papers read and dis
cussed, and considered pages and pages of
figures wDich demonstrated that a circu
lar-top rail was the best of all patterna.
And, indeed, it was proved by mathe
matical lore that that pattern should be
adopted, and it was made the standard
type of American rail. Actual applica
tion of the convex-topped rail, however,
did not confirm scientific theories, it
seems, and it has developed that the old
fashioned broad and flat pattern is now
the standard tor railroad engineers.
THE SECOND BRIGADE.
General Warfleld Sails for Hawaii and
Colonel Macdonald Takes Command.
Brigadier-General R. H. Warfield, Sec
ond Brigade, National Guard of California,
sailed for Honolulu on the steamship
Mariposa last Friday, and "William Mac
donald, colonel First Infantry, now com
mands the brigade. General Warfield
expects to be away six weeks or two
months. His physician prescribed a sea
voyaee and change of climate, hence the
trip to Hawaii.
The recently elected field officers of the
First Infantry are not yet commissioned,
so Robert A. "Marshall, the senior captain,
takes command of the regiment.
Coionel Macdonald has issued orders
directing the companies of the First In
fantry now stationed at Tenth and Mar
ket streets to occupy quarters assigned to
them in the armory on Page street. There
may be some murmuring in the ranks and
along tlie commissioned line, but the
order will be obeyed.
The transfer will oblige the Second Brig
ade Signal Corps to move from the Page
street house. . .
Major Jansen has been appointed in
spector on the staff of General Warrield, to
succeed Victor I>. Duboce, who was re
cently elected lieutenant-colonel of the
First'lnfantry. Major Jansen is a Grand
Army man, and he is up to date on mod
ern tactics and regulations. As a general
proposition National Guardsmen do not
fancy soldiers who served in the war
thirty years ago, asserting that the old
veterans insist on recognizing old fash
ioned and out of date methods of military
management.
Major-General W. H. Dimond, the di
vision commander of the National Guard,
has been traveling in Southern California
for several weeks. He is expected horn*
this evening.

JUDGE OR JURY?
l Which Is Supreme in a Civil
Case in the Superior
Court?
EUGENE DEUPREY'S TEST
Objects to Judge Daingerfield's
Radical Charge to the
Jury.
TWELVE MEN DO LIKEWISE.
Jurors Desire to Reverse the Verdict
They Gave Under His Honor's
Order.
Attorney Eugene N. Deuprey is making
an effort at this time to know whether the
judge or the jury is supreme in civil cases.
It is in the recently decided case wherein
Asa Fisk obtained judgment against John
Mallon, before Judge Daingertield, for
some amount over $3700 on a promissory
note.
The decision was given on the 4th of
this month, and since then the twelve
jurors who passed on the case have decided
they were induced into error, or rather,
they allowed themselves to be influenced
o*>y the court's charge, into passing judg
ment in the premises regardless of their
own conviction.
Attorney Deuprey, who has been made
acquainted with this state of affairs, has
secured an affidavit from the jury to be
used to-morrow in his appeal for a new
trial. If Judge Daingerfield refuses to al
low the appeal, the affidavit will be pre
sented on the same line to the Supreme
Court.
The case at issue is very peculiar. It is
more so than the cases usuaiiy brought up
by Asa Fisk, the well-known money-lender.
The affidavit reads that the charge made
to the jurors by tne court left them no al
ternative but to find a verdict for the
plaintiff without assessing an amount, or
else to fix the amount in favor of the
plaintiff at $3790, which Fisk prayed for in
his complaint.
In the affidavit the jurors say they were
coerced by the court, and not permitted to
use their own discretion under penalty of
being held in contempt. In other words,
Judge Daingertield assumed the high plane
of judge and jury. To this the jurors
demur in their affidavit, and ask that John
Mallon be given a new trial, or else that
the verdict given on February 4 be con
strued as reversed and in favor of the de
fendant.
M. M. Estee and Arthur Fisk, a rela
tive of the money-lender, are the attorneys
on the Fisl: end'of the case, and they will
be nerved witn the notice of application for
the new trial. It is brief, with the excep
tion of the jurors' affidavit, but the history
behind it is full of interest.
Some thirteen years ago John Mallon,
who is now a partner of Harbor Commis
sioner Chadbourne, accommodated his
friend, John Hill, a real estate man, by
indorsing his note for $250. Hili claimed
it v,tÂ»a but tk temporary accommodation, as
theMiote would be transferred to a friend
of his and would be taken up in a few days.
Instead of that Hill discounted the note
for $200 with Asa Fisk and allowed it to
remain with him on that gentleman's cum
ulative plan of interest.
At different times, hoping to^ help Hill
out of his financial incubus, Maiion paid
to Fisk amounts aggregating $1200, ex
pecting that Hill would settle the note
held by Fisk. But in 1386 Fisk, who has
been an acquaintance of Mallon's since the
pioneer days, sent his secretary, Mr. Lang,
to tell Mallon that there was one sure
way in which both could get all that was
due them from Hill. All Mallon need do
was to sign the note, or rather renew it so
as to make it valid, as it was nearly out
lawed, and Fisk had an inkling where
they could levy on some of Hill's prop
erty.
Mallon signed the note. Fisk had told
him privately he would never be held re
sponsible for the indorsement, and he felt
riot only secure in not having to pay the
principal, but he saw his way clear to get
back the amount he had paid out in in
terett.
But, according to Mr. Mallon's state
ment in court, he only signed a note for
$230, which, when Fisk brought the suit,
was produced as a note for $2000. With
interest added, the indebtedness figured
up to $37 f <o.
The details of the loan by Fisk, Mal
lon's indorsement of the note, the interest
he had paid in behalf of Hill and the busi
ness hardships he had undergone through
his act of kindness, were all explained to
the jury in Judge Dain^erfield's court, and
the affidavit these "twelve honest men and
true" have placed at the disposal of At
torney Eugene N. Deuprey in his fight for
a new trial states:
"We desire to reverse the decision we
were compelled to give for plaintiff, under
instructions from tne court. 1 '
There is another phase of the court pro
ceedings which is commented upon by the
attorneys who have nad dealings with toe
case.
It seems that as soon as Asa Fisk
brought Buit against John Mailon for
$3790 the people with whom he had had
business relationship for years, and who
were always pleased to extend nim credit
for unlimited time, shut down on him â¢ami
likewise brought suit. AVhittier, Fuller
and A. H. Winn^.two firms dealing in
plate glass, sued for $5000 each.
The German and the FrenÂ°ii Bank each
sued for outstanding accounts and the
local banks refused to longer accept Mal
lon's paper. Mallon felt himself injured
and in a cross-complaint before Judge
Troutt he asked for $25,000 damages, or
rather he claimed be was entitled to that
much money as damages to bis business
cnaracter. Judge Troutt sustained the
cross-conu>laint, but when it came before
Judge Daingeniel ' in the trial of the case
it was not admitted in evidence.
Taking this and other things into con
sideration the twelve jurors who gave a
verdict for Fisk now want to have their
dictum reversed. The names of these
gentlemen are: Simon Furfh. T. R. Hor
ton, S. Fisher, William Mocker, Platt
Conklin, Joseph N. Nounan, Albert Fol

SCORING THE MILL RINGS
Attorney Baggett, in the Hale &
Norcross Case, Speaks
Warmly.
WAS "AN UNHOLY CONTRACT."
The Supreme Court on Levy's and
. Hay ward's Scheme to "Defraud
the Company."
W. T. Baggett for the plaintiff in the
Hale & Norcross mining case ended the
argument with a terrible arraignment of
the methods by which over a million dol
lars' worth of bullion have disappeared
from that mine, leaving not even the
"color" behind.
"There men (the defendants) must have
been moral idiots," said he, "or else they
would not have corae into this court again
and tried to plead their innocence. They
do not seem to understand the crime they
have committed. They have been so long
engaged in this nefarious business that
possibly they claim it to be their special
privilege to despoil the innocent and ig
norant."
W. E. F. Deal, for the defense, said in
argument yesterday morning that Judge
McKisick, for the plaintiff, had accused
the defendants' witnesses â miHmen
brought from Nevada â of suppressing evi
dence of the fact that gold remained in
the battery and did not. show in the bat
tery assays. He held that this was a mis
take, and" all the assays were more likely
to err than that the men should withhold
evidence.
Counsel claimed that in this case the
gold and silver in the ore was $2,225,300,
as shown by the battery assays.
"We returned," said he, '"'51,678,921 61,
which was all that should have been re
turned, and this is every dollar the com
pany is entitled to."
Mr. Deal explained to the court in full
detail that $14 ore could be milled at a
profit of $1 78 per ton. Tfcis was unsafe
ground/for Mr. Deal to venture on, as he
soon learned.
"If what you say is true," asked Mr.
Bairgett, "what would be theprotit for the
mill working $38 35 ore ?"
Counsel for the defendants very wisely
refused to answer. As a matter of fact,
according to his calculations, about $25
should have been returned to the mine.
As there were 84,068 tons milled from the
Hale & Norcross during the time men
tioned in the suit thi9 would bring the
returns up to $2,101,700. Counsel had
just contended that $1,078,921 01 was atil
the mine was entitled to.
Regardless of the fact that the Superior
and Supreme courts have delared the Levy
contract to be a fraud Mr. Deal contended
that if Levy owned the Nevada mill and
was also a director in the Hale & Norcross
Mining Company that fact would not in
validate the contract, as such contracts
were not illegal as he understood the law.
Mr. Deal said the plaintiff's witness,
Tangermann, was a failure, and had been
imposed upon by the plaintiff and his
attorneys. He exhibited a model of the
mortar of a mill to prove that gold could
not remain in the battery, although many
of the witnesses for the defendants had
testified that gold sulphurets did remain in
the battery of the Nevada mill, and in one
clean-up as ntuofa as fifty pounds were
found in each of the twelve mortars.
Because and Hay ward had made
an illegal contract, hciti Mr. Deal at the
close cf his argument, t.ie court should
not look upon fiverythiug connected with
the defendants' side of the case as tainted
with fraud.
Tiie defendants had Buffered already for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
this contract (in the judgment of $210,000
for illegal milling), and they should not
be made to suffer a second time.
W. T. Baggett for the plaintiff, W. M.
Fox, in the opening of his argument said :
I had intended to give in detail much of {he
testimony, but in order to close the ease as
speedily as possible 1 will merely outline arid
read pilch portions of the testimony as will
give the court necessary information.
The whole defense rests on the battery as
says. The Supreme Court does not confine
this court to the battery assays, as has beÂ«n
claimed by the defendants' attorney. There
has been a strong effort made here to bring
Die question of the contract up again.
This court has declared those contracts to
be fraudulent, and the Supreme Court has sus
tained the declaration. It was an unlawful
and unholy contract, entered into between
Levy and Hayward to rob the stockholders of
the Hale <fe Xorcross mine. These men must be
moral idiots, or else they would not have
come into this court again and try to plead
their innocence. They do not seem to under
stand the nature of the crime they have com
mitted.
Fif Leen years ego, before this infamous cus
tom of milling was introduced on the Com
stock and before the methods of checking all
mills were abandoned, the mills were obliged
to return a specified sum as shown by the car
sample assays. But when the mill rings got in
power they abolished these checking systems,
and when they are caught stealing, their at
torneys come into court and claim that their
crime shall be measured by the batteiv sys
tem, over which they have sole control.
Fifteen years of pillage and infamy which
this mill ring has established is unparalleled
in the history of mining. All the witnesses
brought here by the defense in this case gave
testimony based on the imaiaous practice.
I am g!ad to represent the Moses, as this
plaintiff has been styled by the other side. It
is a happy title, for this Moses will lead some
of the stockholders in silver mines out of a
wilderness of systematic bondage.
Mr. Baggett said that he was sorry to
see counsel for ibÂ« defense attempting to
cast ridicule at a Justice of the Supreme
Court simply because that official had
only confirmed the decision of the lower
court that the Hale & Norcross stock
holders had been systematically robbed
in strong unmistakable terms.
He referred to Mr. Mackay'a deposition
in which witness said that car assays from
50,000 or 100,000 tons of ore taken at differ
ent times would fully closely approxim
ate the value of the ore. Mackay meant
just what he said and there could be no
mistake there. That witness also claimed
that there was an average of about $5 be
tween battery and car assays. The record
shows that the 84,068 tons of ore by car
assay was $3,224,226 53, which less $5* per
ton would be over $2,803,000. The losses
in moisture and slimes would leave a bal
ance of $2,444,514 82. There was only
$1,678,921 76 returned.
Counsel then produced the following fig
ures of ore returns to show that the judg
ment, $651,2 J 61 â the silver discount taken
out, asked by the plaintiff, is not exces
sive: According to Expert Maxwell's and
Ryan's testimony it should be $664,674 31:
according to Expert Kinkead it should
be $680,547 48; according to the Overman
mine, worked from IS9O to 1892, where
54,000 tons returned 76.40 per cent of car
assays, it should be $668,894 81 ; according
to the Consolidated Virginia ore, which
in 1895 returned 83.30 per cent of railroad
car assays, the judgment should be for
$856,490 07; if it had been worked as well
as the Hale & Norcross was worked last
year, when 89 per cent of the railroad-car
assays were returned, the judgment should
be for $900,000.
"Everybody knows that Mr. Inackay
runs the Consolidated Virginia mine,"
said Mr. Baggett, "and that he owns one
third of the Comstock Mill and Mining
Company and he compels the milling con
tracts to be signed by the oincers of that
company at the rate of 70 per cent of the
battery assays. This 3 ear that company
has returned 89 percent of the battery as
says. No such returns were made by that
company or any other before this suit was
begun.
"Now Hale & Norcrosa ore returns 89
per cent of the car assay. Consolidated
Virginia 83 of car and Overman 76, and
these defendants are here in court clamor
ing that the Hale & Norcross returns of 52
per cent â while the steal was on â were
enough. Justice Garoutte said in his de
cision that it was not enough and every
body knew it."
The case was submitted.

DAGGETT FACES TROUBLES
He Is Ordered to Washington to
Explain Those Patronage
Matters.
MAGUIRE URGES HIS CHARGES.
Senator White Backs Greggains, the
Buckleyite, Whose Removal Is
Not Approved.
Superintendent of the Mint Daggett has
gone to Washington in response to ad
ministration summons, and in, a few days
a few things will be likely to pop.
It is an almost unprecedented thing for
a mint superintendent or Government
official of like position to be summoned to
Washingtou to answer for alleged deeds
and misdeeds, but that is why John Dag
gett has gone. His going was a very quiet
one. He slipped away on the overland
train last Wednesday night without mak
ing any announcement of his departure,
and the iourney he was on was not known
even among employes of the Mint until
a day or two later.
When Daggett gets to Washington the
charges filed and urged against him by
Congressman Maguire, his tussle with his
political enemies and the patronage mess
in which he has kent himself ever since he
assumed office, will all be brought to a
focus. It is not thought likely that Ma
guire and others will succeed in getting
him removed, but when he gets through
with his explanations and with the coun
ter-roasts which he has ready for his
enemies, ne will likely listen to the read
ing of some law.
The discharge of Alexander Greggains,
the Democratic politician of the Thirty,
third District, on November 30 last, be
cause he displayed fealty to Buckley in
stead of hnstling for Daggett and Rainey
in the local fight in the general commit
tee, is one of two or three things that
brought the tight over Daggett to a focus.
Greggaina promptly won the backing of
two elements â the Buckleyites and many
enemies of Daggett outside the Buckley
camp. Greggains is a popular fellow be
sides. Then his discharge gave Daggett's
opponents another chance to urge thai
Dagget was displaying "pernicious activ
ity in local politics and generally usine
his patronage power, in flagrant violation
of the declared policy of President Cleve
land that offensive partisanship and other
political indecencies should be avoided by
Leads of departments.
A vigorous protest against Greggains'
dismissal was filed with the Director of
the Mint and well backed up. According
ie law and regulations the dismissal of an
employe by a mint superintendent must
be approved by the Director of tne Mint
before it becomes nnal. Ordinarily such
a dismissal would be approved as a matter
of form without inquiry, but private ad
vices from Washington show that the Di
rector of the Mint has flatly disapproved
Daggett's action. If Daggett does not con
vince Director Preston and Secretary Car
lisle that his dismissal of Greggains Â»houla
be approved as a measure of discipline, if
nothing else, Greggains Till be reinstated
ana draw bis pay for the time he has been
loafing, and Daggett will appear badly sat
down on.
Another little thing thai has kept the
fuss going in Washington was the way
Daggett tried to trick Coiner Spotts into
refusing to nominate a lady for appoint
ment in his department at the request of
Secretary Carlisle himself. About six
weeks ago Mr. Daggett received from Di
rector Preston a letter saying that Secre
tary Carlisle desired the appointment of a
certain lady in the coiner's department in
the place of another employe. The Sec
retary of the Treasury has no power to
make such appointments, but this letter
was a tolerably strong pull for the lady in
questidn. Under the law all appointees
in the coiner's department must be nomi
nated by the coiner himself, but approved
by the superintendent of the Mint a-s well
as in Washington. Daggett is a bitter
enemy of his coiner, who is a Presidential
appointee, and so beyond hi 3 direct con
trol, and he thought he saw a chance to
Â§et Spotts into trouble at Washington, too.
o he merely sent to Mr. Spotts by mes
senger the name given, with the verbal
word that Mr. Daggett wanted a nomi
nating letter. Mr. Spotts wanted some
information about who and how compe
tent the lady was, as he had never heard
of her before, and/declined to nominate
her without a littlyinfonnation.
Daggett made no further communication
to Spotts, and pointers from Washington
indicate that Daggett sent back word that
Mr. Spotts refused to accede to the request
of the Secretary of the Treasury. Mr.
Spotts, however, had smelt a rat, and a
short time ago secured the information
from Washington that the lady's appoint
ment waH desired by Secretary Carlisle.
Thq nominating letter was at once sent
to Daggett, and the lady will presumably
be an accountant under Mr. Spotts in a
few days. Spotts saved himself from being
a persona non grata in Washington, and
Secretary Carlisle heard of the wav Dag
gett pot his fair political friend a place in
San Francisco. Thfs, and one or two other
patronage complications now pending,
helped keep the San Francisco Mint in the
foreground of the administrative troubles
of Messrs. Preston and Carlisle.
These little things are merely supple
mentary to the charges against Daggett
which Congressman Maguire filed when he
returned to Washington a few weeks ago.
The two charges, that Daggett neglected
his duties by being away on private busi
ness a large share of the time and that he
had invited the Mint employes to sub
scribe to Rosalie mining stock, are not apt
to have great weight, especially since the
Rosalie mine is reported to be turning out
pretty well.
But the other charge is being made the
most of. Maguire has told President
Cleveland, Secretary Carlisle and Director
Preston all about Daggett's discharging
the sister of Senator Gesford, the brother
of Senator Biggy and the brother of Sen
ator Fay because these Senators did not
give Daggett their complimentary Demo
cratic votes for United States Senator, and
about Biggy losing the Mint washing for
the same reason. He has recited other
similar patronage doings of Daggett, his
partnersnip with Sam Rainey to do local
politics and his sending for employes and
ordering them to get out and hustle for
his end of the local Democratic fight. The
Btory that Daggett called in Alexander
Gregeains. as he did others, and told him
what to do, and then discharged him be
cause he didn't do it, has been told in
Washington as another example of how
Daggett is running the Mint here, and his
interviews in which he declared that he
was running the Mint, and that no Buck
ley man could stay around him, have been
placed on file.
The administration is asked if it can
stomach this sort of business and this sort
of a man. So now Mr. Daggett is to have
a chance to explain how he is running the
Mint and what he thinks a Mint is for.
Senator White has been a strong backer
of Mnguire in the matter, and has been
especially active in behalf of Greggains,
through the influence of prominent Demo
cratic friends here and through his per
sonal antipathy to Daggett. The enmity
between White and Daggett began at the
Stockton convention in 1884, when Dag
gett was read out of the party. It was in
creased at the State convention in Odd
Fellows' Hall, San Francisco, in 1886, when
Daggett made an ineffectual effort to de
feat White for the chairmanship. From
that convention, too, dates Daggett's hos
tility to Buckley. Buckley refused to op
pose White and Daggett broke with him.
It is said that while Daggett is in Wash
ington he will attend to some other busi
ness besides meeting the charges and pro
tests with which he is concerned. He pro
poses to see if he cannot get the Mint
building overhauled, repaired and im
proved. The structure was built many
years ago, and several thousand dollars
expended on its copper roof and in some
BLACK DRESS GOODS!

What Maguire Says.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. B.â John
Daggett, Superintendent of the branch
Mint at San Francisco, is expected to ar
rive in Washington on Tuesday evening
next. Judge Maguire, when seen by The
Call correspondent this evening, said:
"I understand that Mr. Daggett has been
summoned to Washington by the Secre
tary of the Treasury upon some matters
connected with his management of the
Mint, but I have not inquired and do not
know what the specific cause of his coming
is. It may be that his conduct has
reached 'the limit of toleration,' which, in
his case, has been very broad."
MAX KATZAUER GUILTY.
After Deliberating Three Hours the
Jury Returned a Verdict
Agaiuqt Him.
Max Katzauer was yesterday found
guilty of conspiracy in the United States
District Court on three different indict
ments. The jury was out three hours.
Katzauer, who was allowed out on bail
some time ago, was rearrested yesterday
afternoon and locked up in a cell at the
County Jail.
Katzauer took his conviction calmiy.
The prospect of passing a few years in San
Quentin with Cionco and Foss did not
seem to worry him in the least. He ex
pected, however, that a verdict in his fa
vor would be brought in, as the jury, dis
agreeing upon several points, had returned
for instructions.
Katzauer was originally indicted for
forging and circulating forged Chinese cer
tificates. He belonged to the old Ciprico
gang of certificate formers, and his convic
tion was eagerly sought by ihe Federal
authorities.

A HOME FOR YOUR RENT MONEY. r
A REAL STORY OF HOW MANY ARE OB-
TAINING HOMES AND -HOW YOU
. MAY OBTAIN ONE.
'A, tired of living in a rented house, buys our
$.500 house and lot, paying $300 down, leaving
$2200 to .be paid in monthly installments of $.5,
including interest (7 per cent per annum), which
creases every month, the last interest 'payment
being less than 10 cents. When his payments are
completed he has. by paying no more than the rent
of an inferior house, bought and paid for a home
that in the meantime has increased in value. All
the lime he ban lived in a new and modern house,
built to suit his needs and tastesâ his own home,
which he could improve as he saw fit.
B rents a house for $25 a month, it is not new,
not modern and doesn't suit . in . other ways. ' You
can't get much Of a : house for $25. ; But every
month his landlord takes the rent, and B has noth-
ing to show for it. He acquires no interest in the
property. A's home has cost him $300 (the origi-
nal payment); B hasn't any home.'.' .
To see the HEYMAN TRACT, and the cottages
now being boilt take Castro-su car to Twenty-third

MILLIONS FOR O'NEILL
The Oakland Heir Learns That
His Share Is Now in
Sight.
IN CHANCERY MANY YEAKS.
The Estate Was Formerly the Prop
erty of the King of the Province
of Leinster.
Oakland Office Bub Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Fet). 8. $
Dr. William O'Neill, who lives on Ashby
avenue, North Oakland, has just received
word from Europe that some valuable evi
dence has developed tending to establish
his interest in large estates in Leinster
that were formerly owned by his ances
tors.
For several years it has been acknowl
edged by all concerned that Dr. O'Neill is
one of tbe heirs to' the estate of Lord
O'Neill, Earl of Antrim. The estate has
been in chancery many years, and the
doctor has proof that if it is distributed
during his lifetime his share will not be
less than a cool million dollars.
Lord O'Neill died before Dr. William
O'Neill was born, but the father of the
DR. WILLIAM O'NEILL, THE HEIR TO A FORTUNE.
[lu-produced from a photograph.]
Oakland claimant filed a claim in.the Court
of Chancery many years ago. For more
than lifty years the proceedings have been
dragging slcwlj along, and now they seem
to be in a fair way toward being closed up.
- Fathers and sons and grandsons who
| might have come in for some of the money
bare been born and died since- litigation
â¢â¢Aommeliced: ' "v '>.â¢â¢' ' " -;- 'A
..V-Aiter his father died Dr. O'Neill filed his
claim and has been calmly awaiting final
proceedings. It is calculated that each of
the thirty-two coirs will receive about a
' million dollars . apiece and still '; leave a
fabulous amount for legal and other ex
penses.
Dr. O'Neill ia a native of a little town
in the county of Monaghan, and was
born the nicht of the big wind in ISol. He
came to this country when but 9 years of
age, and in 1843 he settled in Buffalo, N.
V., where be resided many years and
where he married. He studied at St. Jo
seph's Academy at Buffalo, and then en
tered a journalistic career. During the 70's
lie uublished two papers at Buffalo, the
Funday Transcript and the Anti-Alonopo
list.
The Oakland claimant to the O'Neill
estate came to California thirteen years
ago. He located first In San Francisco
and then came to this side of the bay,
where he has been for about a dozen years.
He entered the real estate business, and
all this time he has, in common with all
the other heirs, been making contributions
for the prosecution of the claims in the
Court of Chancery. He is now informed
that the matter Is in its last stages, and
tnat the distribution may take place in a
few weeks. The heirs are distributed as
follows: United States, 41; Ireland, 7;
Scotland^, and England, 1.
Dr. O'Neill describes the estate generally
by saying that it embraces the entire
division of Leinster, the O'Neill being at
one time king of that province. There is
another O'Neill in California who has
proved up his claim in the Chancery Court.
He is Richard O'Neill of Bakerafield. Dr.
O'Neill thinks that the O'Neills of Golden
Gate are also related.
Many years ago the Boston Pilot pub
lished the history of the family and from
this story much information was obtained
by the Irish-American heirs. The most
recent information is very positive and Dr.
O'Neill expects very soon now to obtain
come of the coin for which hie father com
menced to fight. The entire estate is said
to be worth Â£12,000,000.
ALL THREE WITHDRAWN.
Minister* Who Desired the Call
Alarmed at a Supposed Division.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â The Second
Presbyterian Church is yet without a
pastor, and has not even a candidate to be
considered for the place. Two weeks ago
there we're three prominent and well-fitted
ministers, either of whom would have
made an acceptable pastor had not the
others been in the field.
The .Rev. Donald Ross of San Francisco,
the Rev. John Thomson of Cambria, San
Luis Obispo County, and the Rev. James
B. Orr of Benicia, were the three. : An in
formal ballot showed they all had friends
in about the same number. The Rev. Mr.
Orr received a call from another ' church
and accepted it, but' this was unknown to
the others.
The. vote, as informally taken, was given
out in some manner and caused "the other
two 'gentlemen to withdraw their names
'on the ground that' they did not desire to
accept a call to a divided church, so, that
when the church "met this week to choose
a. pastor, . there were ' none ' to be chosen
where there had been : three. The choice
has now been left to the session, will
not ' let its wort 'â . become public prema
turety.
HUNTING A PASTOR. <
First Congregational CUurc'.i Pastorless
Nearly a Year.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 8. -Rev. J. K.
McLean, D.1)., resigned as pastor of the
First Congregational Church in July, 1895,
to take effect September 1. Ever since mid
mmmer the quest for a man to accept the
vacant pulpit has been in progress, but bq
far has not resulted In success. The mem
bers of the committee will only say that
the matter is making progress.
The church is one of the largest Con
gregational churches in the country, not
more than four or five exceeding it in
membership. It proposes to pay $5000,
and would not let an extra $1000 stand in
the way of getting just the man it wants.
This is as much Balary as similar Congre
gational churches in . the East pay, so the
salary question is not the trouble in secur
ing a pastor. The difficulty they experi
ence is that tbe strong men in the denom
ination are well settled and do not wish to
move.
THE BOOT IDENTIFIED.
Remains Found at Blair Parft Those of
Joseph Kallmas.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â A lady who
conducts a lodging-house at 415 E<idy
street, San Francisco, called at the morgue
this afternoon and requested to be allowed
to see the remains of the man found at
Blair Park yesterday morning. She said
she had seen the picture in The Call and
believed it was one of her lodgers. When
shown the body she identified it as Joseph
Kallmas.
She refused to give her name, but said
Kallmas had lodged with her two years
to-morrow; that he was a native of Ger
many, about 60 years of ace. He came to
the coast about thirty years ago and had
been a miner at Bodie, Cal.. for many
years. The last seen of him was Thurs
day forenoon when he left the house.
He was next seen by Butcher B. McDer
mott that afternoon walking up tbe Pied
mont road, the body being found Friday*
morning early. The general opinion is
that it is a case of suicide from despon
dency, but tbe Coroner will have an
autopsy held Monday to determine the
cause of death. The inquest will be held
in the evening.
Bessie and the Baby.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â Judge Greene
to-day granted tbe petition of Bessie Hood
of Buffalo and her minor child to have the
estate of Dr. John W. Hood distributed to
them. Hood, it seems, had lived a dual
[ life and had discarded the petitioner, but
! : was never divorced, lie lived in Hay
-1 wards with a woman who went by the
j name of Effie Hassler Hood, who died a
: few months before the physician. Wnen I
j he died he left abont $2000 to A. J. Hassier,
ignoring his former \.ife entirely. The
true wife, however, established her right
to thu estate and thus secured it.
Will Attend Church.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â Rev. R. F.
Covle. 8.D.. pastor of the First Presbyte
rian Church, has accepted an invitation
from the various local councils of the
American Protective Association of this
city, to address them. The subject of his
discourse will be "The Character of Abra
ham Lincoln." and to-morrow evening is
the time. There are thirteen councils of
the order here and all membe; are re

o'clock, to march to the church in a body,
where seats will be reserved for them in
the body of the house.
The regular Sunday afternoon lecture

Menzenmeyer to Return.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â District At
torney Charles Snook received a dispatch
to-day from Deputy Sheriff Al "White as
follows :
"All O. K. Will start back to-day with
Menzenmeyer."
The news was unexpected, but is highly
satisfactory to the officers of this county.
The Deputy Sheriff arrived in "Victoria
this morning and had with him two wit
nesses to the shooting of John Perkins on
Christmas eve at Lorin. It was reported
Menzenmeyer would fight extradition to
the last, but he has evidently changed his
mind.
A Vacant Pulpit.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. B.â Rev. E. H.
Hayuen of the Baptist church at Golden
Gate has resigned to accept a call to Santa
i Rosa. Mr. Hayden has been in Golden
Gate about a year, having succeeded B. F.
Huddelson, who resigned to become State
president of the American Protective As
sociation and who is now holding that po
sition. He has done a good work and is
released with a feeling of regret by the
people of that church.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY â¢9, 1896.
CAN GET TIME TO THINK.
Why W. G. Landers Opposes
the San Leandro Electric-
Light Bonds.
HE IS "NOBLE" NO LONGER
,
â 
The Gas Company's Vice-President
Recalls His Fall in the Public
Estimation.
Oaklasd Office San Fbancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Feb. 8. f
The fight between the citizens of San
Leandro and the gas company has taken
on a new phase.
W. J. Landers issued a circular letter
to-day and rehearsed some facts that show
how quickly the estimation of the people
changed after Mr. Landers helped to open
the electric road.
About five years ago, says Mr. Landers,
the San Leandro papers showed their good
judgment by publishing the following:
Gas Turned On.
On Monday evening all the street lamps were
lit with gas for the first time. The initial
lighting was a grunt, success, and bore us out
in the statement we marie some time ago,
namely, that the work would be well done. In
some future issue we will publish a complete
account of the modus operandi by which the
gas is made. Mr. Henning was congratulated
on all sides on the success of his work, but for
Mr. Landers our citizens reserved the lion's
share of the praise. And while all rejoiced
with him, but few knew how much time, labor
and thought he has devoted to the erection of
the works, nor of the endless vexations he has
had to endure. But he has persevered, and
there is not a property-owner in San Leandro
but will be benefited more or less by the result
of his labors. And what is more to his credit
than all else is that no great pecuniary reward
was what he sought, as he was^actuaied as
much by public spirit and the desire to see the
town take & position among the live and pro
gressive municipalities of our ctate.
Now the people of San Leandro, almost
to a man, are fighting the gas company.
The Trustees have ordered the town light
ing discontinued and by an almost unani
mous vote the people have decided to issue
$10,000 bonds to build a municipal electric
light plant.
"Now," says Mr. Landers, "it is abso
lutely the case that the property has not
paid in any one year 2 per cent per annum
upon the capital invested, and furthermore
the case that at any time during the past
three years when I began to observe tbat
the citizens were bein^ led by a few mis
chiefmakers I would ha"~e sold the
property for 50 per cent of its
cost, and consider the other 50 per
cent as a loss, rather than contend
with the leadership referred to. I was
also led in the direction of making the
loss upon observing a growing disposition
to disregard the friendly feeling and spirit
absolutely due from the" people in respect
to this particular investment. About the
same time and from much the same mo
tives I assisted materially in erecting one
of the most prominent buildings in the
center of town.
"The litigation which I have started
will have the ad antage of giving the peo
ple plenty of time in which to think care
fully over what has been done, also to
test the judgment and acts of the Trustees
and likewise that of incurring the debt, if
at all, for a sufficient amount and in ac
cordance with law."

The bleachers about the diamond were
crowded with faculty members, university
students and their lady friends and other
visitors when time was called for the
game. At the appointed hour the foot
ball-players came sprinting down from
the gymnasium attired in complete foot
ball uniform and b?gan kicking the pig
skin bag to one another across the field.
Soon the members of the Glee Club
dressed in outing costume approached
from the vicinity of the cinder track, sing
ing "Ransonie Is a Jolly Good Fellow."
The two parties met in the middle of the
field, and after a heated discussion over the
relative merits of football and baseball
the singers challenged the knights of the
gridiron to a game of the latter.
The "Renderers of Song," as they were
styled in the souvenir of the day, took the
bat. In the first inning they scored five
runs, which were made By Temple Smith,
Fred Knight, Charles Elston, Allen Smith
and Clay Gooding.
At the outset Rawlings of the Glee Club
brought laughter and applause from the
bleachers by his phenomenally high
catches, facilitated by his lengthy arms.
"Briek 1 ' Morse tackled Kennedy in real
football styie, and the latter went tumbling
in a heap. When the footballers came to
the bat Wallthali, the giant guard of the
Varsity, was struck out by Morse's swift
curves. Ransome, the newly elected cap
tain of the football team, came to the plate
amid loud cheering, and he was also struck
out.
At the beginning of the eighth inning
the score stood 14 to 8 in favor of the glee
boys. Temple Bmith batted a hard rigtft
fielder into the nands of Wallthall. who
wa9 on third. "With ouly one more inning
and the footballers rapidly increasing
their tally, the excitement became intense.
In the last of the ninth the> score stood
18 to 17 when the football team took the
bat. Carr was struck out, Hilborn came
next, but was put out on first by Rawl ; tiLs,
Wilson was struck out and the* yame waa
ended with the singers one point ahead.

BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â A meeting
of the executive committee of the inter

How Manager Cook Taught

NO MORE CROSSING THE BAY.
Monday Night the Frawley Company
Will Tender Him a Benefit at
tee Macdonough.
Oakland Office Fan *-*aÂ«oib>co Call.)
908 Broadway, Feb. 8. j
Miss Maud -Morrell will make her debut
as a professional in this city next Monday
night. The occasion will be the benefit
performance tendered to Manager Charles
E. Cook of the Macdonough by the Fraw
ley Company. /-/
Although the only first-class plAyhouse
in. this city has been open only three years
Oakland is now known throughout the
East and by all good companies as a "good
show town." Prior to the opening of the
Macdonough a night at the theater meant
Charles E. Cook, the Popular Manager of tho Macdonough Theater, Oakland.
[From a photograph.]
a long, cold trip across tho bay and back,
besides occupying much time. Under
these circumstances it can readily be un
derstood that the patrons of the drama in
Oakland were|Very few. Although several
companies wire induced to come over
here the old Cllosseum was so'definitely a
relic of the past that society shunned and
actors condemned it.
After the opening of the new theater it
was not very generously patronized for the
first few months, and the people did not
seem to appreciate it until C. E. Cook took
charge of the management. He has had
to create a habit and a desire to attend the
theater among a select body of people who
had learned to look upon a first-class play
house as domething that they dare not
hone for tlm side of the bay. Little by
little the fact was recognized thai Oakland
had a luxurious playhouse, and with the
recognition of the fact came the first-class
companies. It was an npniil fight, for
those to whom the theater was a part of
their social Jife had formed the habit of
crossing the bay, and it was hard to break
the custom.
After a year of persistent effort Mr. Cook
realized that he had not worked in vain.
Society set its seal on the Macdonough,
and for the first time in Oakland, high-ela j s
companies like thrse of Ward and James,
and Fannie Davenport and the Lyceum
Company, played week stands to crowded
houses. This was somewhat of a revelation
to Eastern managers, and Oakland was at
once listed as a place to patronize. At this
time every first-class attraction is sure of
a crowded house, and the success of the
pretty theater is assured.
Next Monday Mr. Cook will be tendered
a benefit, and every effort is being made
by his many friends to fili the house. An
anecdote is told on Manager Cook that
shows how completely be has his chosen
profession at heart, and how practical are
his ideas.
A new theater was opened in Oakland,
and some one suggested to Mr. Cook that
it might draw a certain element away from
the Macdonough. "Sot a bit of it," said
Cook. "It would be better if we had two
more houses in town. It would encourage
the nabit of attending, and that is what
we want. Even these second-class Houses
help, because the people to vf> om they
cater show a disposition to attend a first
class house whenever they can."
The piece selected by the Frawley Com
pany is "Men and Women."
The players of this company nave en
deared themselves to the amusement
lovers of San Francisco and Oakland by
their artistic and intelligent presentations
of high-class plays, aud their production
Â»f "Men and Women," now running for
the second week to crowded houses at the
Columbia Theater, San Francisco, has
proven the crowning triumph of a series
of brilliant successes. The play is a flaw
less gemâ the choicest of their splendid
repertoireâ and is the same in which the
Charles Frohman company achieved phe
nomenal success. Critics agree that the
Frawley company's presentation of "Men
and Women" has not been surpassed on
the American stage.
The numerous friends of Miss Maud
Morrell will also be present, and society
having set its seal upon the event there
will certainly be a large house.
ALAMEDA HEALTH BOARD.
It Takes Stringent Measures to
Guard the City's Food
Supply.
The League of American Wheelmen
Hold an Enthusiastic Meeting
on the Encinal.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. B.â The milk
men who supply Alameda get nervous
about the tima for the Board of Health to
meet. The board goes rather thoroughly
into the food question and nobody seems
to have a pull with it. Its executive of
ficers are not only listened to when they
make reports, but as each member of the
board is a regular physician in practice the
body has a pretty good idea of how its
officers have done their duty and whether
they are as thorough as they should be.
The veterinary inspector is relied upon to
Bee that the milk and other food supplies
are in proper condition. Last night he re
ported that he had inspected all the
dairies and found them in excellent con
dition except three, and these are being
put right as fast as possible, The butcher
shops and restaurants had all been visited
and no tainted or unwholesome food was
found.
The subject of a garbage crematory was
taken up and the conclusion arrived at
; that it is time that A Jam eda disposed of
its garbage by burning. The board will
inspect the new crematory in Oakland.
The subject of displaying meat and veg
etables on the sidewalk, now in vogue by
Alamedans, was discussed, and disap
proved. An ordinance 1 will probably be
enacted requiring food that is displayed by
dealers in their . store-fronts to be raised
two feet from the sidewalk or floor.

AMBULANCE FOR FABIOLA.
A Lady Member of the Associ
ation Donates It to the
Hospital.
WILMERDING FUND IS CLOSED.
Enough Money Has Been Raised to
Purchase a Suitable Lot for the
Proposed School.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 8. f
Oakland is to have an ambulance of the
latest approved pattern in the near future.
It is the gift of a lady member of the
Fabiola Hospital Association to the or
ganization, but is to be used in ah cases of
sudden sickness, injuries or removal of
those who ne- d such service, under cer
tain regulations to be established by the
association.
Although Oakland is a city o! over 60,000
inhabitants and is called the "Athens of
the Pacific," yet all these years it has been
the custom to use tne police patrol to re
move the sick or injured. Being a rail
road center many of the wounded em
ployes are brought to the hospitals and
are always transferred from the train in
the patrol wagon. In case of an accident
on any of the streets to a woman or child
they are hustled into the patrol and hauled
through the streets, much to their humil
iation, as none know whether they are
prisoners or not.
The gift was made known at the annual
meeting of the Fabiola Hospital Associa
tion, but the donor is to be kept secret.
Some six weeks ago Bhe placed an order
with Studebaker Bros., South Bend. Ind.,
for a duplicate of the ambulance which
took first premium at the Columbian Ex
position held in Chicago, aod it was to be
delivered in ninety days. It is expected to
arrive within six weeks.
A number of the old board of directors,
finding it impossible to devote the neces
sary time to the work, requested to be re
lieved from further service, which was
granted. The election resulted as follows:
Board of directorsâ Mrs. Remi Chabot, Mrs.
James A. Folger, Mrs. Pedar Sathere, Mrs. A.
Barton, MrÃ. Allen D. Wilson, Mrs. W. W. Stan
ford, Mrs. Charles J.JDewing, Mrs. John Yule,

For an Armory.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. B.â A commit
tee consisting of Captain Chipman, Lieu
tenants Simpson and i Dohrman, Secretary
Burkbartand Corporal St. Sure has been
skirmishing in the vicinity of Park street
for some time past, having in view the
purchase of a piece of property upon
which it is proposed to erect an armory
building designed to be a thing ornamental
to the city and a comfortable and cozy
home for the members of Company G,
N. G. C. It is the desire of the committee
that the armory should be built on Park
street, and with that end in view it has
confined its skirmishing to that thorough
fare. The committee already has its eye
on two good properties. One piece is
located at the north end of Park street,
and the other is on Santa Clara avenue,
convenient to the former street. It is the
intention of the : committee, if thought
consistent, to enlist the attention of some
of the moneyed men of the city who might
feel an interest in Company G and try and
induce them .to form 'an association, the
purpose of which would be to advance
funds for the erection of an armory build
ing. A building such as Company G would
like to be housed in would cost, it is esti
mated, about $20,000. It would be a two
story brick structure, containing â  all that
would be necessary intone of its kind in the
way of a meeting-room,' company quar
ters, assembly-room for drills, and being a
thorough equipped building.

PHELAN MAKES A
PRINCELY GIFT
Offers the Board of Super
visors a Beautiful
Fountain.
IN MARBLE AND BRONZE
The Work of Art Is Symbolical
of the Admission of
California.
DESIGNED BY DOUGLAS TILDEN.
The Art Fountain to Be Placed at
the Junction of Market, Turk
and Mason Streets.
James D. Phelan wrote yesterday to the
Board of Supervisors tendering to the City
the beautiful fountain which he ha?
caused the sculptor Douglas Tilden to
design for him as a gift to San Fran- }
cisco in honor of the Native Sons of ft
the Go lden "West. For the last few *
months Douglas Tilden has de
voted almost his entire time to design
ing the beautiful work. Mr. Phelan
wished the whole design to have a syru-

bohcal meaning and, at the same time, to
be a work of art which would be an orna
ment to the City. Gradually the concep
lion of the fountain has grown. Douglas
Tilden modeling and remodeling his de
sign and Mr. Phelan applauding, criticiz
ing and suggesting, till at last the com
pleted model stands out in all its beauty,
a work of art of which the greatest city in
the world might be proud.
The fountain is of marble and bronze,
designed by Douglas Tilden, and is to rep
resent the admission of California into the
Union. There is a tail shaft of California
marble about thirty-five feet high, sur
mounted by a bronze winged image of the
Genius of California, bearing in her hands
an open book of the free constitution,
datea September 9, 1850, in bold letters,
the date of the admission of the State.
The base is about thirteen feet square,
and on a pedestal rising from it is a bronze
ligure representing the Youth of Califor
nia, clad as a miner, bearing in his right
band the National colors and in his left
hand his hat, which he is waving, in the
attitude of rushing forward with im
petuous haste and cheering lustily in
triumphant enthusiasm. The figures are
each seven feet in height. About the
pedestal are the pict and the cradle of the
miner, whicn have been temporarily laid
aside.
On the face of the pedestal will be in
scribed the date of the laying of the foun
dation of the monument and the dedica
tion, which is to the Native Sons of the
Golden "West. There will be emblematic
carving and above the two bowls watar
flows from the mouths of bears. The
whole tells the story of the admission of
the State in a SDiritÂ»d way. The figures
are full of action and moving forward,
apparently to some desired object.
Douglas Tilden, the sculotor, in a young
Native Son who was educated at the Deaf,
Dumb and Blind Asylum at Berkeley,
and who, through the patronage of
W. E. Brown an<F the asylum officials,
was sent to Paris, where he executed
"The Baseball Player," "The Tired
Boxer" and "The Bear Hunt," which
have given him international renown.
Although young, he ranks among the best
and most promising men in his profession,
and as this monumental fountain will be
conspicuously exhibited, and being for the
decoration of his native city, he is taking
special pains to make it his masterpiece,
li is hoped that other citizens will give
him orders, and that this will be the be
ginning of many such gifts in tbe future.
The new Native Sons' Hall is on Mason
street, about four blocks from Market
street, and this will indicate to all passers
by on the main thoroughfare the location
of that new and beautiful edifice.
It was in the following terms that James
D. Phelan made his princely gift to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday:
San Francisco, February 8, 1896.
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors, City
and County of San Franciscoâ Gkntlkmkn: I
hereby lender the City and County of San
Francisco a fountain constructed of marble
and bronze, emblematic of the admission of
California into the Union, designed by Douglai
Tilden, sculptor, to be erected by me, with
your consent, at the junction of Market, Turk
aad Mason streets, and to be forever main
tamed by the City as a drinking fountain.
The model may be seen by your committee at
the sculptor's studio. Yours, respectfully,
James D. Phelan.
To Improve Webster Street.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. B.â The most
feasible plan yet suggested for the im
provement of the now almost impassable
Webster- street roadway, connecting Ala
meda with Oakland, is the one which City
Attorney Taylor makes public. Mr.
Taylor has been laboring zealously on the
plan for some weeks past, and thinks that
he has at last solved "the problem which
will permit of some advancement in the
matter of improvement of the roadway.
He proposes an assessment district, which
will compel owners holding property on
either side of the roadway for a distance of
300 feet to proportionately contribute to
the cost of the work. The marsh land on
each side is held in undivided interests.
The cost of this improvement will not be
assessable against the frontage, as is the
custom in other street improvements, the
usual modus operandi not being applicable
in this case. Rough estimates place the
cost of the improvement of Webster-street
roadway at between $18,000 and $20,000.
This cost would be paid by the property
owners whose land would be included in
the proposed assessment district, and if no
one lays claim to that portion of the land
assessed for the work it would be sold to
satisfy the cost.
GEN. J. S. ELLIS IS DEAD

He Was Brigadier-General of the

This City.
General John S. Ellis, once a prominent
figure in San Francisco, died in West
chester, N. V., Thursday last, at the ace
of 69 years. The dispatches regarding his
death were very meager, and only the bare
facts were transmitted to his friends in
this City.
General Ellis left here years ago, and so
the present generation knew little or noth
ing of his career, while the older people
almost forpot him. And yet he took such
an active part in the early politics of tbe
City and the State, when social conditions,
passing through a process of purification,
were exceedingly turbulent.

mentality, who went out with others of

COUNCIL FOR DR.
BROWN NAMED
Ten Churches Selected by
the Committee of
Deacons.
TO MEET IN NINE DAYS.
Letters-Missive Drafted so as to
Cover Every Charge Against
the Pastor.
THE VIEWS OF THE ACCUSED.
He Is Thoroughly Satisfied With the
Composition of the Ecclesiastical
Court.
One week from Tuesday next the coun
cil that is to silt the reports attributing
immoral conduct to Rev. C. O. Brown,
D.D., pastor of the First Congregational
Church, will convene in this City.
There were two meetings of the board of
deacons, who were appointed a committee
to call this ecclesiastical council. The
first was held at the pastor's office in the
First Congregational Church. It began at
3 p. m. and continued until sp. m., and
then adjourned until 8:30 p. M. to meet in
the office of Deacon J. Howard Barnard in
the Columbian building. â¢
In the afternoon a canvass was made of
the various churches to be invited, but
nothing definite was done, owing to the
unavoidable absence of Deacon J. J . Vaa
concellos.
It took but an hour in the evening to
complete the business, which was to select
the ministerial representatives to the coun
cil and to draft the letters-missive. All
the proceedings were harmonious, and
every act received the unanimous approval
of the five deacons.
Letters-missive will be sent to the fol
lowing churches to-morrow:
San Franciscoâ Plymouth, Rev. W. D. Wil
liams, D.D.; Third, Rev. William Rader; Beth
any, Rev. William C. Pond, D.l>.
Oaklandâ First, Rev. S. M. Freeland, D.D
(acting pastor); Plymouth avenue, Rev. J. K.
McLean, D.D.
Alamedaâ First, Rev. W. W. Scudder Jr.
Berkeleyâ First, Rev. G. B. Hatch.
Sacramentoâ First, Rev. W. V. Hoyt, D.D.
Stocktonâ First, Rev. R. H. Sink, D.D.
San Joseâ First. Rev. H. M. Tenney.
The invitations read as follows:
The First Congregational Church of San
Francisco to the Church, , sendeth
greeting.
Whereas certain charges affecting the moral
character and ministerial standing of our pas
tor, Rev. C. O. Brown, D. D., are current in this
community and have been spread broadcast
through the public press, and, whereas, he has
requested the church to call a council to be
convened at the earliest possible day, we,
therefore, respectfully invite your attendance
by pastor and delegate at a council to be held
in the lecture-room of the church on Tuesday,
February 18, at 2 p. m., to thoroughly investi
gate all matters pertaining thereto and advise
us accordingly.
Wishing you grace, mercy and peace, we are
fraternally yours,
C. O. Brown, Pastor,
J. Howard Barnard, Secretary.
It was claimed by Dr. Brown on Friday
that the committee would, according to
Congregational usage, have to submit the
list of churches they selected to the mem
bers of the church, but the committee
construes the action of the church on last
Wednesday evening to mean that it was
given full power, without further action of
the church, to call the council. The mo
tion as passed by the church was as fol
lows:
That the board of deacons be a committee
for the calling of a council to be convened at
the earliest possible day, to investigate and
pass upon the rumors current In the com
munity affecting the good name and integrity
?t he v P, B | tor o f the First Congregational
Church of San Francisco.
A consultation was held by the commit
tee with Dr. Brown yesterday morning
and the latter agreed that the committee
had the power it claimed.
When the list of churches and letters
missive were submitted to Dr. Brown by a
Call representative last night he ex
pressed himself as perfectly satisfied with
the work of the committee. He added
tbat he would have preferred to fee a min
ister of high standing of one of the other
denominations added to tne council mem
bership.
It is but fair to the committee and to
Dr. Brown to state that he was not present
at either session of the committee yester
day, nor did he make any suggestion as to
the composition of the" council, tnough
he had the right to object to any member
or members if he thought they were preju

MRS. COOPER'S DENIAL.
She Refutes the Charge That She
Secured the Discharge of
Mrs. Harland.
In one of the Brown letters published
yesterday there occurred the following
statement:
I cannot speak of her (Mrs. Cooper) with any
degree of complacency. I could teli you of an
instance within the last ninety days where the
combination of Coopers forced from her posi
tion one of the brightest women in this State,
the mother of three fatherless daughters (the
widow of a prominent Mason who was killed
in the mines), who was struggling as only a
mother can to buy them oread, just because
she had the womanhood to criticize the work
of Sarah B. Cooper. I have for gome time
thought that at some time or another the
people of tnis City would understand her
methods.
Mrs. Cooper made the following state
ment with regard to this matter:
I have only this to say: All side issues in this
case are irrelevant. The simple question comes
back, Is Dr. Brown innocent of the Krave
charges that have been made against him? As
to my own essential characterâ it my life from
day to day shows it to be firm and faulty I
must abide the decision of the public, for the
Scripture is true, "A tree is known by its
fruits." My life for twenty-six years in San
Francisco must speak for itself.
As to the charge that I "forced from her po
sition one ot the brightest women in this
State, the mother of three fatherless children,"
Ipronounce this statement to be utterly false.
The party in question sent in her resignation
to the president of tbe society with which I
am connected, and at the meeting of the board
her letter of resignation was read and unani
mously accepted. I was present at the board
meeting and voted with alLthe other members
of the board. The letter of resignation
is now in the hands of the president
and speaks for itself. I had noth
ing whatever to do with the matter,
further than to vote to accept the resignation,
as did every other member of the board pres
ent. As a simple matter of justice to all con
cern . in these days of anonymous letters,
wouluitnotbe fair to insist upon seeing the
names of the writers of letters before publish
ing the same? I gave to the editors the names
of the writers of the letters to me, simply ask
ing that they be withheld from publication.
This seems to me to be the only fair way to do.
It was not the kindergarten association to
which reference is made, and has nothing
whatever to do with it in any way.
Mrs. Cooper declined to mentioa the
name of the lady referred to in this case.
It was learned from another source, hrw
ever, that the person referred to was Mrs.
Hester A. Harland.
Mrs. Harland undertook to act as State
organizer and lecturer for the Woman's
Suffrage Society, but her health was such
that she eventually decidea to give up the
work, for that reason alone.
MRS. DAVIDSON'S CASE.
Judge Slack Will Probably Assign
It to Judge Wallace or Judge
Bahrs.
The information against Mrs. Davidson
is still unassigned, but it has been deter
mined that it will not go to Judge Belcher.
It was reported around the hall yester
day morning that it was to go to Judge
Belcher's department for trial, and such
was Judge Slack's intention, but Judge
Belcher objected. He called attention to
the remarks made by Dr. Brown about
him and said that in view of the state
ments made he did not feel it would be
the rigbt thing for him to take the case.
He has no personal feeling in the matter,
but he thought it would be better to send
the case elsewhere.
This leaves a choice between Judge
Bahrs of Department 12 and Judge Wal
lace of Department 6. From the time of
the boldinjr of the prisoner by Judge
Campbell there hÂ«id been a well-defined
idea among the parties interested that
Judge Bahrs would get the case, and it
was said at the time that, should it go to
Department 12, it would be tried in the
month of February. The prospect of an
assignment to Judge Belcher has upset all
these calculations, however, and no one
but Presiding Judge Slack can tell who
will get it. It will be assigned to some
department to-morrow.
TUGS WEBE OF LITTLE USE.
Why More Were Not UÂ«ed to Pall the
St. Paul Off.
While the St. Paul was resting in the
Jersey sand at Long Branch, with only
three or four wheezy tugs pulling at her
occasionally, the question most frequently
asked by people talking about her was:
"Why doesn't the comnany send down
more tugs? Why don't they send fifteen
or twenty times as many boats as they
]%aye and get her off auickly ?" The usual
answer was, "They're afraid they'd strain
her."
While talking with Clement A. Griscom,
the president of the American line, a few
days before the vessel was eot off, a
Sun reporter asked him the question. Mr.
Griscom answered:
"That's a point that people seem to be
all at sea on. The trouble Is just this: It
is impossible to get resistance from the
water. Boats in the water cannot get the
purchase to pull great weights. Great
ships like the St. Louis and the St. Paul,
with their 20,000 horsepower, represent
only about sixty tons ot pushing or pull
ing power. Tugboats, with their little en
gines, have probably not half a ton of
power each. A single hawser, such as any
one of the four the St. Louis has out, with
an anchor at the end out to sea. and bein<*
pulk d on by the engine and windlass on
the ship, has a ninety-ton pull, or equal to
one and a half times the pull of the St.
Paul's 20.000 horsepower when she is
floating in the water. It has as much
pulling power as a hundred tugboats have.
The four hawsers that are out represent a
great deal more power than could be ex
terted by all the tugboats that could crowd
around the St. Paul.
"There is more power in these four
hawsers even than we want. At no time
since she ran aground has all this avail
able power been used to pull her off. It is
not possible to pull a ship like the St.
Paul over the sandhiils. She must work
herself free. The pulling on the hawsers
aids her in doing this. The St. Paul is
working herself free, and the four cables
and the windlasses are helping her more
than all the tugboats in New York har
bor could help her."

tiring, cause sleep.

BLESSED
HILLS
OF
SAN FRANCISCO
IF only it were not for the everlasting |
hills!" .
This is what a San Franciscan said
to me, recently, when I spoke of the
picturesque charm which this won- j
derful City has ever had for me.
I exclaimed at the heresy. Did he realize
â¢what San Francisco would be without the
hills, investing her with a beauty that has
made her famous?
Yes, he knew. She would be a city
where suburban life would have some com
fort and uptown building lots some value.
As though city realty, uptown or down,
were not already higher than any of
our city hills!
Then he swung aboard a Clay-street car
to ride from Montgomery street to Taylor.
What will be the fate of the human race
a few generations hence if we continue, as
we are doing at present, to neglect the
natural uses of the body and to rely upon
artificial substitutes for the organs nature
has provided for our use?
We have covered our heads with hats
until our hair has grown sparse and in
sufficient for the purposes it was meant to
fill. We have augmented our sight by
i spectacles until we have greatly lessened
the power of the eyes. We have so re
duced to a science the preparation, mace
ration and lubrication of food that our
teeth are failing into decay, and the sali
vary glands, through inactivity and abu^e,
are becoming the seat of queer atttictions.
We have almostly entirely lost the use
of our toes, once useful, active mem
bers of the body, and the majority
of us are in a fair way to forget
for what lungs and legs and arms
were given human beings. We are ren
dered breathless by ascending a flight of
stairs. We are exhausted after climbing
one of our city's hilly blocks, and we are
quite worn out when it comes to carrying
a moderately heavy package any distance.
In fact, we are in a fair way to realize that
scientific picture of the twentieth century
man as a toothless, hairless, sightless
creature, with limited power of self-loco
motion, with an enormous nervous devel
opment. Elevators, cable and electric
cars, bicycles and horses, are all combin
ing to make us comparatively helpless
creatures as regards nature's methods of
locomotion. In time Yankee ingenuity
may invent a creature that can carry on
the work of the world independently of
human effort, and when this happy time
arrives we can sit down quietly to the
leisurely task of growing our bones out
side our bodies, for the better protection
of the soft, feeble organisms they are
likely to become.
But while tbe race at large may be con
tent to permit its physical faculties to fall
into "innocuous desuetude," the fortunate
d-^cllera in San Francisco will have to bear
a neavier weignt of responsibility than
falls to their fellows' share, for, in neglect
ing the natural exercise for lack of which
we are becoming a feebler folk than were
our progenitors, we are sinning against cir
cumstance, as well as against oursalves,
â¢ and against the richest environment nature
ever bestowed upon a happy people.
The "everlastine hills" that lift our city
heavenward on their broad, service-loving
shoulders; "the heart-breaking and back
breaking hills," I heard them called re
cently, by one who knew not the wrong
she did them. The beneficent hills they
are, if we only knew how to use them, are,
could we but understand it and know its
value, sending us perpetual invitation to
let them help us to health and strength
and beauty and inspiration. We are poor,
tame-spirited creatures, that we are con
tent, day after day, with letting ourselves
be draeged up and down them, elbowing
each other in crowded car*, breathing
stale air and cowering before drafts, when
we might climb them of ourselves, to the
expansion of our lungs and the develop
ment of muscle and digestive power, to
Bay nothing of the greater mental and
moral force that comes from a free use of
the body.
If we patronize the cable-cars at all, it
should be to bring us down the hills, for
the actual jar, upon back and nerves, of
coming down a steep, flagged grade, is
greater than the muscular exertion and
demand upon the lung power of ascending
the same grade. This is not wholly true
of an unpaved hill road, although, in any
case, the descent, while apparently easier,
is a greater strain in the long run than the
ascent. In this, as in some other things,
it is easier to go <lown than up, but it is
harder upon you in the end.
But, going down or up hills, even San
Francisco hills, should not unduly tax the
Btrength of an ordinarily well person. We
make a terrible bugbear of them, we who
A BIT OF COUNTRY WITHIN THE CITY. THE FRUIT ORCHARD ADJOINING THE STONE RESIDENCE ON RUSSIAN HILL.
[From a sketch made by a "Call" artist.]
dwell among them, when we should find
them a help and a blessing. Only from
the hills can we note the real majesty and
beauty which this city has, hateful though
most of its buildings are to the eye, and
this beauty can by no means be rightly
seen, and appreciated when seen, even
from the dummy of a hurrying cable
car. It is a matter of belief with
me that, could the majority of our busi
ness men and women walk downtown in
the morning, noting from the various ele
vations the city to which they were de
scending, thinking upon it seriously, of
its beauty, its possibilities, its wonderful
power, spread out thus before the be
holder; or, walking back, at night, could
turn and gaze upon the deserted markets,
tbe closed stores, the quiet streets wherein
is stilled for a time the clamor of the day,
there would grow up in their hearts a
deeper, more real love for their city, that
would manifest itself in better citizenship,
a more earnest endeavor to make it worthy
of its noble surroundings.
It would probably not be possible for
many people to start out, at once, to walK
up and down our hills without great fa
tigue to unused muscles and lungs, but
beginning by slow degrees a training could
be thus acquired that would be of lasting
benefit to the wnole system. There is
something absolutely pathetic in the sight
of San Franciscans repairing to the quarters
of the various athletic clubs, for exercise,
when nature's own gymnasium is open to
them day and night, free as the sunlight
and the stars.
And then, the joy of the special visits
one may make to the hills! One need not
go to Lone Mountain or the Twin Peaks
to find green and joyous spots or magnifi
cent outlooks. I know a view from a low
walled approach to a home on Broadway,
that is like a vision in Italy for beauty and
color, and that quaint, foreign suggestion
that one so often comes upon in this queer,
suggestive city. One must see them to
believe the bits of almost rural loveUness,
wonderful reminders of orchard and
meadow, almost witbin a stone's tlirow of
the city's business center. It is worth a
stout climb up anyone of the high hills
out toward North Beach and Barbary
Coast to come upon the unexpected and
delightful surprises sure to greet one.
Such a hill I climbed one day. not so
long ago. It was a crisp, clear day. "Over
head the fleckless sky was radiantly blue,
and the February sun mellowed, without
beating, the sea-scented air. From Alca
traz came faintly, above the hum of the
city and tne nearer shrilling of children's
voices at their play, the sound of a gun.
The skirling cry of tbe gulls as they fol
lowed a Pacific liner bound out through
the gate reached me musically.
Looking across the city I could see nest
ling against the ultimate purple hill Jine
the ihaded preens and browns that mark
the park and its surroundings. Between
it and the silver pleam of the bay the city
lay before me. I could count a score of
cable lines, their clanging cars running,
with the apparent purposelessness of so
many ants, over the hills, now climbing
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
a heavy grade, pausing on the crest of
some height, silhouetted aeainst the sky
for a single instant, then rushing dizzily
down to the next level.
There is, to me, an endless fascination
about this peculiar feature of our fascin
ating city's streets. I watched the down
ward career of a Sacramento-street car,
sweeping, stately, from the serene heights,
past beautiful homes, great schools and
goodly churches, to plunge, at last,
through Chinatown's weird squalor, into
the hurrying rush of the business quarter,
until it swung around the curve at the
water front, to begin its upward flight.
Gray and countless, standing shoulder
to shoulder along the hills, hiding behind
their uncommunicative walls endless sug
gestions of human love and hate, joy and
sorrow and boundles3 hope, the homes of
the city spread, rising, tier upon tier,
until they ranged against the sky, reced
ing, row upon row, to the further Jine of
the peninsula. On the other side the bay
were Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda,
and an on-reaching vista of further blue
hills on the Marin and Alameda shores,
and lending its own beauty to all the bay
smiled in â  the sun, bearing upon its
broad bosom the ships from far lauds and
near.
Could . any other city on this continent
spread such vision of wonder for the be
holder? It will be a day for the Civic Fed
eration and all the law and order leagues
in the city to take Holiday and rejoice
when the people of San Francisco come
really to know the strength and order, the
good government and helpful strength
that lie in our city's blessed hills.

Soiled Bank Notes.
A well-known bank cashier was talking
the other day about tne possibilities of
contagion in soiled bank notes, and took
occasion to remark that a much cleaner

lot of paper money was now in circulation
than formerly. The banks, he said, now
send their soiled notes to the United States
Treasury to be destroyed as soon as a suffi
cient quantity accumulates to justify it,
and new notes are issued in their place.
This has been rendered not only possible,
but advisable, owing to the increased fa
cilities for punting bank notes. One never
sees a soiled bank note in London. They
are all crisp and white and new, simply
because the Bank of England never lets a
note go out a second time. Although the
average Jife of a Bank of England note is
said to be five days, the notes which find
their way to the colonies are kept in circu
lation for years, and these are found to be
in an even worse condition than our own
greenbacks.â Philadelphia Record.
WHITE HOUSE DINNER IN 1818.
Described by a Congressman Who Was
a Guest of President Monroe.
Tho December meeting of the Oneida
Historical Society was held in the Arcade.
The speaker of the evening was Robert J.
Hubbard of Cazenovia.
Mr. Hubbard's subject was "Political
and Social Life in Washington During the
Administration of President Monroe." In
the beginning he stated that his paper was
composed largely of extracts from private
letters written by Thomas H. Hubbard.
In the years 1817 to 1824 he was Repre
sentative at Washington from the Con
gressional district embracing Madison and
Herkimer counties of this State during
the administration of President Monroe.
Mr. Hubbard had been presented to
President James Monroe, who occupied
the "palace," as the President's house was
called, in 1817, and spoke of him as a
plain, unassuming man, who acted as any
other well-bred man would do. The Pres
ident received callers on the Ist of Janu
ary, 1818. At 2 o'clock the doors were
opened and the crowd poured in. A corps
of marines was drawn tip in front of the
house, bright in all the trappings of mili
tary dress. The President received with
Mrs. Monroe. One followed in the current
which bore him to his distinguished hosts,
who bowed gracefully to each guest â much
more dignified, certainly, than the more
democratic custom of handshaking which
prevails in our own time.
Simple refreshments were passed by the
servants, consisting of sweetmeats, ice
cream, hot punch and lemonade. The
President was dressed on this occasion in a
blue coat and buff waistcoat and small
clothes and white silk stockings. Mrs.
Monroe had on a silk or satin gown of
light color, almost white, close around the
neck and a large bunch of artificial flowers
at the bosom. Her hat or bonnet was of
the same material, surmounted with three
nodding plumes. She was about 50 years
of age, rather handsome and very gracious
and polite in her manners. This good
couple stood on their feet, nodding, bow
ing, smiling and talking with about 1000
persons.
On February 21, 1818, Mr. Hubbard dined
with the President, in company with
Messrs. Cushman, Palmer and Drake.
They went at 6 :30. The President's brother
and private secretary received them in a
most awkward manner and ushered them
in Indian hie into the drawing-room,
where there were some twenty gentlemen,
sitting in a row in a solemn state, mute as
fishes, they having undergone the grand
state ceremony. "Mrs. Monroe." he
writes, "was seated at the further end of
the room with other ladies. On our ap
proach she arose and received us hand
somely. After being myself presented, I
introduced the other gentlemen. I now ex
pected to be led to the President, but
my pilot, the private secretary, had
vanished.
"We beat a retreat, each to his respective
chair. Observing the President sitting
very demurely by the chimney-corner I
rose and advanced to him. He got up
and shook me by the band, as he did the
other gentlemen. This second ceremony
over, all again was silence, and each once
PERCHED ON A MOUNTAIN TOP
Where a Young Man Was Exiled to Expiate
His Folly,
AWAY up on the very pinnacle of
a small peak of the first rise of
the Santa Ynez Mountain range,
in full sight of Santa Barbara^ a
tiny cabin has recently appeared,
which has been the subject of general
comment throughout the valley. How
did it get up there? What could be the
object of anybody in seeking such a dizzy
height and isolated location foraresidence?
Who were its occupants? These are a few
of the questions that have been asked and
that no one could answer. Few suspected
that in the lonely cabin perched on the
heights could be found the solution of a
mystery which perplexed not only Santa
Barbara, but the country at large, last
spriner.
It will be remembered by the readers of
The Call that considerable commotion

more moved to his seat. It was a period
of great solemnity.
"The dinner was good and the table
most richly furnished. There were about
thirty guests in all. It became more lively
as the dishes rattled. The plateau in the
center of the table was very elegant. It
was fully twelve feet long and two feet
wide, oval at the ends, and figures, eight
inches high, with extended arms com
posed of a mirror surrounded by gold fe
males holding candlesticks. The table
was garnished with artificial flowers. The
plate was very handsome china, highly
gilt, and the dessert knives, forks and
spoons were of beaten gold. The dinner
was ended at about half-past 8 o'clock."
Mr. Hubbard attended another dinner at
the "palace" and spoke of it as a grave
and serious affair.â Utica Herald.
was caused last May by the announcement
that Francis Lord of Santa Barbara, the
son of a retired officer of tho British Royal
Engineers Corps, who was still an English
citizen and drawing a pension from her
Majesty's Government, had received the.
appointment of cadet to Annapolis Naval
Academy, although some of the candi
dates who had presented themselves to
the Congressman of young Lord's district
to take the competitive examination in
sisted that another lad had been appointed
and that Lord had ranked decidedly below
other Santa Barbara boys in his record at
that time. Congressman McLachlan was
requested to explain his reasons for ap
pointing young Lord in defiance of the
rules governing such appointments and
indignantly disclaimed having done so,
naming the young man whom he had se
lected for the position. Yet there was
Lord's official appointment, made out in
due official form and bearing the signa
ture of the Secretary of the Navy, along
with other collateral documentary evi
dence. It was then decided that the ap
pointment must have been one of the
thirteen in the privilege of the President
of the United States. By this time the mat
ter had been very thoroughly dis
cussed, and a strong opposition arose re
specting the appointment of an English
man's son to a position which it is the
dearest ambition of loyal American boys,
the sons of patriotic fathers, to secure.
The newspapers took up the question, and
it was discussed not only by all the promi
nent journals on the Pacific Coast, but by
the Eastern press as well. Prominent men
on this coast and patriotic organizations
sent protests to Washington. It should
be understood that this opposition was
based purely on broad principles of public
policy, and was in no sense due to any per
sonal feeling. For the entire Lord family,
personally, the highest esteem was felt in
this community. The fact was even
brought forward that Captain Lord, the
father, had made his preliminary declara
tion of intention to become an American
citizen some seven years before, bat that
although for two years past he had been
competent to complete his naturalization,
he had not chosen to do so. To remove
this objection Captain Lord, in the height
of the discussion, took out his final papers
as an American citizen, and in so doing
sacrificed the pension he was receiving
from her Majesty.
Meantime the hero of this National com
motion was riding on the top wave of local
popularity in Santa Barbara's most fash
ionable circles. Local society boasts quite
a contingent of retired naval and military
officers, and a boy who was on his way to
a cadetship in the great National academy
where naval officers are made became an
object of more than ordinary interest.
The cruiser Monterey was then in port,
and Francis Lord was a frequent and hon
ored guest on the big battle-ship, beine
carried off to days of target practice and
junketing of the jolliest kind. The fiesta
guests, including the Monterey, departed,
and a week or so later Francis Lord, en
vied by every Santa Barbara boy, left for
the north in response to an official sum
mons, which he displayed, calling him up
to Mare Island for his final examination,
which it was understood was to be little
more than a formal ceremony. For nearly
a year he has been supposed to be enjoy
ing the privileges of life at Annapolis.
This reads like a disjointed tale. There
would seem to be little connection between
a lucky young cadet enjoying the privileges
of one of the first schools of the land and a
lonely cabin on the mountain top along
the shores of the Pacific. But a few days
aco a Call correspondent climbed the
rugged trail leading to this cabin, a trail
that makes an ascent of 2000 feet in the
course of a mile and a half, and on the
very summit of the mountain, in the little
building whose timbers were dragged by
lariat up the mountain side and which is
now anchored down by wire stays to keep
the winds from sweeping it away, clad in
the regimentals of a mountaineer ranch
man, was young Francis Lord.
He made a clean breast of the whole story
and was perhaps a little relieved to feel
that the scribe was no malevolent corre
spondent of a sensational journal whp had
sought him out to "roast" him, after the
current phrase.
"I deserve all I've suffered and more,"
he frankly said, "and I don't want to
shirk any of the responsibility of what I
did, when I say that it had its beginning
in a mistake â a mistake about a telegram.
You see when I went down to Los Angeles
to take the examination my number was
'41,' ana the telegram announcing the re
sult read that '41' was appointed, when
it should have been '42.' For five days I be
lieved I had the appointment and told peo
ple about it, and when I found out the mis
take I hated to own up. So I tried to make
peoole think I had it anyhow. Yes, that
paper that purported to come from Wash
ington was forged, and so were all
the other letters. There was a man in
town â I wish I had never met himâ who
got up those letters for me, just for the
lark of the thing, and it seemed as if the
deeper I went the harder it was to pull
out, so I just kept on. I'm sorriest on
account of my family. It's been hard on
them."
And the boy hung his head in honest
contrition. "Yes, I've been up here ever
since." he replied, in answer to another
question. "There are just two of us here
â both boys â and sometimes it is a little
lonely. We thought our cabin would go
over in the high windstorm the other
night, but we're pretty comfortable, on
the whole. We grub out chaparral, attend
to a few head of stock, milk a couple of
cows nieht and morning, and get our own
meals. That's about the sum of it. We're
really very comfortable."
The cabin is comfortably fitted up, and
a woman's taste has had something to do
with the furnishings of the lonely place to
which this young exile is condemned.
There are a tpuple of charming bay-w.n
dows with Beep seats, pretty Japanese
rugs, a couple of easy chairs, soft blue
draperies with white dragon pattern, cur
taining off an alcove; a little set of boot
shelves, a pleasant reading-table with a
Rochester lamp. Somebody wants to
make this boy's lot as easy as it may be.
But oh, the barrenness and isolation !
Nothing but rooks and brush and bleak
mountain-tops around, not a single neigh
bor within sight or hail, and the only com
munication with civilization that long,
steep, dangerous trail, washing away in
places with every rain, so that only a

makes passage possible !
When Francis Lord rounded off his
little season of deception with a gay time
in San Francisco, at the time of His sup
posed trip to Mare Island, there was noth
ing left but to come home and face the
music. The honor of the old English
father was grievously wounded. For three
weeks the boy was shut up in the barn on
the grounds of the pleasant residence of
the family on Arlington Heights and fed
on prison diet, and he was only released to
be sent into this curious exile. But the
old father's judgment was a wise one.
The shamed and guilty boy who climbed
the mountain heights last June is a man
now, with a man's hone3t purpose to re
trieve his error. He hopes soon to rind a
berth, no matter how humble, on an
ocean-going steamer, where he will have
an opportunity to earn advancement and
prove that he has the making of a sailor in
him, even if he never wears the. uniform of
the United States navy. The lesson has
been a bitter one to him, but out of the
reckless boy's mistake may come the man's
growth and salvation.
And America has gained a loyal citizen
in the person of Captain Lord.

KEMEMBRANCES OP LONGFELLOW.
Mary Anderson de Xavarro Writes of
tin- Beloved Bard.
In writing of her early days on the stage,
and telling the incidents of her first tour of
the Eastern cities, in February Ladies'
Home Journal, Mary Anderson de Na
varro dwells at some lengtu and affection
ately upon her reminiscences of Longfel
low, the poet, for whom she had the great
est admiration. The actress was invited
to meet Longfellow at his Cambridge
home, James T. Fields bearing the grace
ful letter of invitation. Of the sweet singer
she writes: "Surrounded by the calm of
his peaceful home it seemed as though
the hand of evil could not reach
him. Eve ry conversation with him left
some good result. His first advice to me,
which I have followed for years, was:
'See some good picture â in nature if pos
sible â or on canvas; near a page of the
best n|usic, or read a great poera daily.
You will always lind a free half hour for
one or the other, and at the end of the
year your mind will shine with such an
accumulation of jewels as to astonish even
yourself.'
"He loved to surround himseif with
beautiful things. 1 have scan him kneel
before a picture which had been pre
sented him and study every detail and
beauty of his 'new toy,' as he called it,
with a minuteness and appreciation which
few would understand. However infested
with care or work a day might be, a visit
from him was sure to beautify it.
"A few months before his death, being
unable, through illness, to leave the house,
he sent for us again. The usual warm
welcome awaited us. Luncheon over he
snowed me a 'new toy,' and tried to be
amusing, but there was a veil of sadness
over him, and I noticed how feeble he had
grown. â¢Uiitil the spring, then,' he said,
as we parted, 'if lam still here. I wonder
if we shall ever meet again ! I am old and
not very well !' He apologized for not see
ing us to the carriage, as was his wont,
but stood at the window watching us leave.
Its sash was covered with snow. His face
looked like a picture set in a white, glisten
ing frame, for the sun was shining and his
hair and beard was nearly as white as the
snow itself. I can see him still standing
there, waving his last farewell. Soon
after the English-speaking world was sad
dened by the loss of one of its sweetest
bards."
General William Booth originated the

READS LAW AT FOURTEEN.
A Youthful Disciple of Blackstone and Devoted
to His Ideal.
V| \f yILLIE," called General
\V W A bri Â« ht Â» fine-featured,
V V brown-eyed, dark-haired boy
of fourteen, neatly clad in a
navy-blue knickerbocker suit, stepped up
to the general's desk and awaited orders.
'â¢Willie, the law hrm of Blank & Co. de
sires to learn certain facts in the case I
hand you. Ring them up on the telephone
and supply them witn the information
they want. Here are the documents," and
the general passed the papers over to the
boy. Willie answered, "Yes, sir," and a
moment later was engaged in reading and
explaining things with a masterful air
to a prominent barrister at the other end
of the wire.
A friend of the general, seated in his pri
vate office, looked up with unfeigned
astonishment.
"Can you intrust such an important |
duty to a mere child?" was the natural
inquiry.
"That boy knows just what is wanted,"
responded the general. "In fact, th^ busi
ness I have just given him is a compara
tively simple matter. If 1 wish to send a I

message, short or long, over the telephone
to either lawyers or clients, I explain to
Willie what I want to say, and he repeats
the message in the ear of the instrument
with absolute correctness. If somebody
warns to learn several different dates I tell
them to "Willie here at my table. He never
writes them down, but goes directly to the
instrument, and I have yet to learn that
he has made a single mistake. Why, I
would trust his memory as soon as I
would my own."
Such associations served only to arouse
further interest in the youthful prodigy.
"Your wonderment is quite excusable,"
remarked the general. ."That boy is a
phenomenon. He reaas law, young as he
is, with a natuial relish. He pores over
pages of abstruse legal lore, studies com
plicated problems of law, and' not only
does he do it in a lawyer-like way, but he
is able to explain faithfully and to the sat
isfaction of anybody gifted with an under
standing the passages he haa read. For
instance, i;e opens a lawbook and reads
along until he strikes some ponderous
word that is new to him. He never Bkips
a sentence, or even a word, and seeks to
understand |horoughly all he reads. Well,
he holds his finger on the word that puz
zles him, and opening his Webster, which
he keeps at his elbow, rinds the definition,
then turns again to the sentence in which
it occurs and eets the full knowledge
of the meaning. I frequently stop
him in the midst of his reading and
ask him what he has learned from
the volume in his hands. He tells me in a
deliberative manner, with apparently as
much regard for fidelity to the subject
matter as you would expect from a Judge
on the bench, the substance of what
he has read. He has explained to me
questions of English tax-titles, and he
not only makes himself plain, but shows
an appreciation for the nicety of terms. I
find his memory astonishingly retentive,
and he has wonderful analytical powers.
That boy will be a Charles James Fox if
He lives. He is a born lawyer."
And all this had reference to Master
William B. Gorman, whose attractive face,
looking up from his own little deslc, is the
first to greet whoever enters the reception
room of General Barnes' law offices.
Master Willie is the youngest of three
children, ill boys, who reside with their
widowed mother, Mrs. M. Gorman, at
2304 Harrison stnÂ«et. He was graduated
from the Horace Mann G rammer School
in May, 1895, being awarded the Bridge
medal for general excellence in that year.
Two months later he entered the office of
Judge Seymour D. Thompson, the legal
writer, remaining there until January 10
of the present year, when Judge Thomp
son returned to his home in St. Louis, Mo.
The distinguished lawyer formed a strong
attachment for the youth. It was he who
recomaundea Willie to General Barnes.
In a letter of introduction, written Jan
uary 8, Judge Thompson thus referred to
Willie Gorman :
'â My work has been that of an author of
legal textbooks, and finding Master Gor
man exceedingly bright I put him at work
looking up cases and verifying references
for me in the Mills building law library.
He did this with great quickness, aptness
and accuracy. I soon found that I could
6end him from my office into the library to
find out what was decided in a particular
case. He would return very qu.ckly and
standing up before me, give me a very,
clear oral statement of the exact decision
which the court made, stating the facts
and then stating the legal conclusions of
the court on those facts. 1 am amazed
that a boy of his years should possess an
analytical power so highly developed. Be
lieving that he possesses the intellectual
foundation for a great lawyer I proposed
to his mother to take him to St. Louis and
to give him all the advantages of instruc
tion which my facilities there would afford,
but, he being her youngest child, she was
naturally unable to part with him."
Master Gorman is conscientious, willing,
faithful and earnest in attention to his du
ties. He has already read several law text
books, Blackstone's Commentaries, Robin
son's Elementary Law, Thompson on
Negligence, and considerable case law.
Attorney D. A. Ryan, the legal assistant
of Genera! Barnes, has taken a deep inter
est in "Willie, and delights in explaining
complicated points of law to the "Chief
Justice," as Master Gorman is styled by
some of the barristers who have made his
acquaintance.
"I shall be examined in Blackstone as
soon as Mr. Ryan finds time," said Willie
to a representative of- The Call. "In
studying I make notes of propositions in
which there is anything the least obscure,
and whon I understand the matter well I
destroy the notes. Oh, I expect to go to
school again, probably next year, and then '
I will take up Latin and Greek. Latin, in
particular, I am anxious to learn.
"Exercise? I ride a bicycle out to the
Ciiff House once in a while, and I like
football. I used to play football a great
deal at school and I have seen some of the
big games between the colleges. There is
a lot of excitement and a lot of hard work
in a game of football."
"Willie!" came a call from General
Barnes.
"Yes, sir."
A number of Supreme Court decisions
were wanted and luaster Gorman was
speedily glancing over the labels of the
long rows of lawbooks and handing down
the proper volumes.
"Best lawyer in the country for his age,"
whispered the general.* "Gem of a boy!
Fine head! Always correct! Born in
him!"
Raising his voice the general said:
"Now, Willie, go and amuse yourself with
Blackstone; but take it easy. No rush.

TRUE REPRESENTATION.
Advantages ot the Preferential Propor
tional System Explained by
A. 11. Sanborn.
A. H. Sanborn lectured to the members
of the Mechanics' Institute at Library Hall
last evening upon "The Efforts for Secur
ing Representative Government."
I think all of us in our thinking have been
in the habit of considering that the direct
method of government is the betler, but on
more mature thought we are apt to conclude
that the indirect method is the more effective.
As the country become* larger and its affairs
more intricate it becomes more and more diffi
cult to put the direct method In operation.

government by representative legislation. I
think it must be evident to all that represen
tatives iv many cases do not really represent.
By the system commonly in vogue, known as
the majority system, a very small majority
may totally deprive a great minority of repre
sentation. To remedy tins, a system known as
proportional representation has been devised
and has been adopted in Denmark and other
European states. Illinois' has adopted a sys
tem of somewhat the sume nature.
Ii we can present a system which will ef
fectually and perpetually eliminate the boss I
think we nave rendered our country a great
service. In the preferential system of propor
tional representation I think we have attained
this end. We know that reforms of all kinds
grow by degrees. Parties do not spring full
grown into being, and it seems to me as scon
as a party has gained sufficient size to be en
titled to remesentation it should have it, and
its members should be granted a chance to ex
plain their ideas in the halls of Congress.
Mr. Sanborn explained the actual work
ings of the system he advocated as demon
strated in the elections for trustees of the
Mechanics' Institute. In the last two elec
tions the proportional system has pre
vailed.
MISS TAYLOR'S SUCCESS
A California Girl the Particular
Star of the Saturday
Concert.
She Sang in the Native Russianâ An
Excellent Carr-Beel Pro
gramme.
The chief event of the forty-ninth "SW
urday Popular Concert" at Golden Gate
Hall yesterday afternoon was the appear
ance of Miss Marion Taylor in several
vocal selections that were immensely ap
preciated and encored by the fashionable
and critical audience.
Miss Taylor is a native daughter of the
Golden State, well known in musical
circles. She has just returned from Paris,
where she studied under M. Marty at the
Conservatory, and was subsequently a
pupil of Mme. Marchesi. Miss Taylor got
at the heart oi her audience almost from
the very erst notes yesterday. She has a
mezzo-soprano voice of unusual quality,
it is soft and sweet, and yet has a remark
able strength, and is always pure and
clear when used to its best advantage.
She was a trifle nervous yesterday, and
those wiio know her capabilities say she
did not do herself full justice. But
strangers found it hard to believe this, for
the audience was enraptured with her per
formance, and she was recalled many
times. The most notable of her efforts
were a couple of Russian folk songs,
sung in the native tongue. These were
given with much spirit and feeling, and
were greatly enjoyed, and made Miss Tay
lor at once a favorite witli her audience.
The programme in full was as follows:

the Pop Trio. The fantasie of Niels Gade
is a sniooch-flowing piece of music remi
niscent oi Mendelssohn. It was well played
by Mr. Kent, who has a fine tone and
phrases In an artistic manner. The forty
ninth Pop was a most successful event
throughout.
The Dog's Fine Business Capacity.
August Abert, an enterprising baker, do
ing business down near the French market,
owns an intelligent tlog, Fifine, that keeps
his master's shop for him. Abert has a
little bakeroom behind the shop, and as
he gives his personal attention to the oven
! Fifine proves invaluable in waiting upon
| customers. The dog carries strapped about
I her neck a little bank whose slot is ar
j ranged to receive a nickei.
The customer may help hln<self to a
i loaf from the counter, but woe betide one
who tries to depart without depositing the
I requisite nickel in Fifine's bank. If more
| than one loaf is taken, an equal number
I of deposits must be made in the bank or
Fifine will know the reason why. She
knows very well how to use her teeth in
case of necessity, though she is usually as
mild as a lamb and quite a favorite with
her customers, but if her master should be
needed the has only to null the bellrope
j which communicates with the bakeroom
I and he is on the spot.
Occasionally an ugly customer comes
along. Last night, for instance, a tramp
tried to work Fifine for a supper, but the
dog grubbed his ankles as he was making
for the door without the formality of a de
posit, pulled the bell and kept him safe
and sound till Albert appeared and a po
i liceman could be summoned. â PhUa

THE LATEST MAP OF MARS
Camille Flammarion Discusses the Recently Com
pleted Chart,
The new chart of Mars, lately perfected,
is a task of which the completion may be
termed an astronomical event of the first
importance, says Camille Fiammarion in
the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. For if the
furrowed lines, as shown in this chart,
cross the waters of the planet as well as
the continents, we shall be constrained to
modify our received hypothesis with ref
erence to Mars generally, and 10 consider
it no longer cut up by means of watery
masses.
For all that there is water upon this
neighboring globe. The clearest proof of
this is the snows which in winter
extend all around the poles to a
latitude equal to that of St. Peters
burg, and sometimes to that of Paris,
and which beneath the rays of
the planet's summer sun are almost en
tirely melted. This melting of the circum
polar snows is far more complete on Mars
than on theeartb, no doubt, chiefly because
the seasons, though similar to our own,
are, nevertheless, twice as long. There
remains, therefore, but one permanently
frozen point, which is not at the geograph
ical pole, but at the pole of frigidity.
Whence all this water, then, and what
becomes of it?
It fills the canals and is distributed over
the whole surface of the continents for
purpose of irrigation. It never rains on
Mara, or very rarely. Fair weather is prac
ticaily pemetual. There are neither snows
nor rains, nor springs nor streams, nor
rivers nor floods. The currents of water ]
Four Aspects of.ithp P.lanet irmier the tefescope 3
are established through quite different
means. .
In accordance with the conditions estab
lished by these recent investigations, the
waters accumulated as a result of the melt
ing snow give rise, first to melted areas,
which we take for seas. From them are
distributed water lines, which give life to
meadowa and lields, to woods, perhaps,
and the verdure of which varies with the
seasons. Thus is it further transmitted
through the geometrical network of rec
tilinear canals to the most desert-like
steppes.
The series of circular disks at the inter
sections of the canals are oases purposely
created and fed by the waters.
It is known that upon this neighboring
planet a man weighing on our earth
seventy-five kilograms would weigh but
twenty-six; that the specific gravity of
matter is far less than nere; that the at
mosphere is very thin, and that the con
ditions of existence vary sensibly from our
own. It is very probable thp.t humanity
on that planet, such as it is, is created
upon a scale vastly superior to our own-
Mars being mucn older than the carth â
and immensely higher in intelligence.
This general unity of organization, bo to
speak, conforms to the theories we have
formed respecting our heavenly neighbors.
HOW FRANCE PLAGES A LOAN.
People Anxious to liend Their Money
to the Republic.
I do not thiuk that the French republic
has placed a national loan since 1891, and
I remember its bein^ shown at that timfe
by some of the political economists that a
man with an annual income of 80,000 francs
was paying the state, department and
city, year in and year out, a total of 14,000
francs, or over 17 per cent of liis annual
revenue in the way of taxes. H till, and not
withstanding this heavy taxation, it is
seldom that any one complains, and, more
over, the people are always ready to loan
their money on the same burdensome con
ditions.
Bpfora arranging for an eraprunt the
Minister of Finances holds frequent con
sultations with three or four of the lead
ing members of the chief banking estab
lishment; tbat is to say, with the Director
of the credit Lyonnais, with the Roth
schilds, etc. It is thus finally
agreed that these houses will, them
selves guarantee to place whatever
part of the loan the public failÃ
to subscribe for; further, they agree to
help the Government in the work of tak
ing in the money. Then their commis
sion â generally one-half of 1 per cent of
all that they handleâ is arranged, and last
of all they are told what part of the loan
they may themselves subscribe lor.
It is not often that the state permits
these moneyed advisers to have more than
one-fourth or one-fifth ofÂ» the total cm
prunt, the great majority being reserved
for the public subscribers; that is to say,
the people themselves. Besides, the max
imum price of each "rente" is fixed, and
beyond this figure no person, banker or
other mortal, may advance the price until
after the new bonds have been quoted on
the Bourse by the-^agents de change of
Paris. This enables a poor subscriber to
one share to benefit by a bull movement
as much in proportion as it benefits the
richest capitalist who happens to own
many bonds.
There is not much chance, however, of
great fortunes being made by speculating
in rentes on the Paris Bourse or elsewhere.
In March, 1893, French rente âthat is,
Government securitiesâ reached tne high
est price they have attained during the
present century. That month the 3 per
cents touched 97 francs, but then, as on
other occasions, this nscendine movement
was stopped by economical complications
or by political events, and rentes soon fell
to their average price, which is usually
about 87 francs to 89 francs.
As I have stated, the last time the French
republic asked her children for a loan was
only a few years back, and then it was a
loan for "nearly $180,000,000, though
she only wanted "a part of it paid cash
down. At the time appointed the public
flocked ar>(l subscribed the total amount
seventeen times over. The first payment
required was, if I remember correctly,
$-8,000,000, and the windows were opened
to the poor and rich alike on a Saturday
morning. When the treasurer counted up
that Saturday night he found the people
had, inside of eight hours, brought him
over $400,000,000.
Raising a big loan in France is always a
bis event for Frenchmen, and French
women, also, have great confidence in
t'aeir country's credit. They consider thai
there is no money so safely invested as
that which is intrusted to the care of the
stateâ could there possibly exist a better
or more patriotic reason?â and they seem
to be sufficiently rich to do without out
side, assistance.
Tn France no one is even told of what
Oerman banks or English banks may do
about a public loan, simply because those
foreign concerns are not permitted to have
anything to say about it. There are no
bonds for persons outside of France until
after they have all been subscribed for at
home. Xo matter how large the amount
asked for by the French republic, rich
and poor flock in a crowd, some with pock
et-books bulging out with banknotes,
others with stockings full of gold and sli
rer. The day following the German war
Thiers said: "We require 3,500,000 to lib
erate the land." Then subscriptions
poured in to nearly 44,000,000, and the land
was free.â Paris Correspondence Boston

Uses for Horge Bones.
The leg bones of horses are so very hard
and white as to be especially valuable for
handles of pocket and table cutlery, and
the ribs and head are burned to make
boneblack after they have been treated for
the glue that is in them. In the calcining
of these bones the vapors arising are con
densed and form the chief source of car
bonate of ammonia, which constitutes the
base of nearly all ammoniacal salts. To
make glue the bones are softened in muri
atic acid, dissolved in boiling water, cast
into squares and dried on nets. The phos
phate of lime, acted upon by sulphuric
acid *nd calcined with carbon, produces
phosphorus for matches. The hoofs are
boiled to extract the oil; the horny sub
tance is shipped to the manufactories of
combs and a variety of special articles.
A CURIOUS CEOWN.
Found Many Teara Ago in the Wild* of
luoluiniio County.
A short time ago Professor Van der Nail
j lenof this City received from Henry Bueh
j ler of Jacksonville, Or., a most strange and
interesting curiosity. A letter came with
it, stating that Mr. Buohler beliived the
object to be some sort of a crown, but
would liko some positive information on
i the subject.
The letter went on to say that the sup
posed crown was found by the writer about
thirty-five years aeo on his ranch in
Tuoluinne County, in this State. At the
time he had DeenlTTtng on the ranch for
about three years, and it was wild land

[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
when ha got it. There is no record of any
one except Indians ever living in the
vicinity, and there is not the vaguest possi
bility that the work was done by them.
The place where the crown was found
was a most curious one, and the circum
stances connected with it are strange and
interesting, Mr. Buehler states in his let
ter that he was dinging out a large sage
brush that was in the way of his plow. At
a depth of about four feet from the sur
face his shovel struck what s ppeared to be
a bowlder about the size of a man's head.
As the ground about the roots was soft he
picked up the lump and was astonished at
its lightness. A close examination showed
a piece of shining metal sticking ont tit
one side. Taking his knife Mr.Buehler
scraped away a portion, and could hardly
believe his eyes when a perfectly formed
grape leaf, made of bright yellow metal,
came to view.
The work of removing the object from
its encasement was a task that occupied
several days. The substance surrounding
it proved to be a composition of clay and
gypsum, and incessant boilini: and scrap
ing with bits of soft wood was necessary to
get it off. Great care was necessary, as
the intricate mass waa soon found to be
very delicate. â¢
When Mr. Buehler at last had the object
in his hand he had not the least idea of
what it was, but his few neighbors agreed
that it was a crown of some kind, al
though nobody would attempt to explain
how it came to be buried among the roots
of a sagebrush. Since then hundreds of
people nave examined it, but so far no
satisfactory explanation of its origin has
been given.
Taken altogether, it is a moat unusual
object. It is hemispherical in shape, about
five inches in diameter across the base
and made to appear of interwoven leaves
of grapevine. The leaves are most deli
cately and accurately modeled, all the
veins showing plainly on both sides. Little
bunches of grapes are scattered over the
surface. These are in fact the most curi
ous part of it. They are purple in color
and made of a substance that looks like
Bohemian glass. Each grace is fastened
in the proper place by a tiny wire and all
are bound together into a perfect bunch.
An analysis ol the metal forming the
leaves shows it to be composed of gold,
saver and copper, gold being nearly one
half of the composition. There must be
nearly $100 worth of the precious metal
in it.
Professor Van der Naillen, although well
posted about such subjects, could form no
idea of the origin of the object. He
Â«howed it to several persons in "this City
woo are familiar with all the big curio
collection? in the world, but none of them
could recollect ever having seen anything
that looked the least bit like it. AU agreed,
however, that it was a crown.
Th- only possible solution of the prob
lem is that it was made by gypsies from
certain ornaments stolen "by^ them. The
leaves have a slight appearance of Hun
garian workmanship, and were evidently
made by a more skillful hand t^an the one
that put them together into thoir present
form. But how or when the crown came
onto the ranch in Tuolumne County is one
of the mysteries that would be hard to
solve. Perhaps the Indians stole it from
the early Spaniards and buried it after
covering it with clay.

A City Where the Restaurant* Are Al
ways Full of People.
Between 12 ard 1 in the middle cf the
day ali Berlin is saying ."mahlzeit," which
means meal time. The conductors of the
cars and omnibuses greet every passenger
with "mahlzeit," and the passenger in
recognition says it to them. The same
word passes between every storekeeper or
clerk, and the customers and the different
members of the family salute each other
with it when they sit down to the table
and again when they rise to leave.
In Berlin the restaurants are always full
of people, no matter what hour of the day.
Between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning
they are having their second breakfast of
rolls, cold meat or cakes and chocolate;
at 1 o'clock dinner; and in the evening
meals and drinks of evÂ«ry. description
about the small tables which crowd the
salon. In the winter time, with men and
women alike, tea perhaps is the next
favorite beverage after beer, but they are
seldom induced to take it straight, and the
least bit of cognac or rum must be added
to give it tone. The tea is never served in
cups and saucers, but in glasses resem
bling those from which Americans drink
soda. Hot uoda of any kirid is unknown,
but one can drop into plenty of little shops
for a cup of hot chocolate," with delicious
whipped cream and a small sweet cake
thrown in. White beer is a beverage pe
culiar to Berlin, and found nowhere else.
It is a great drink with the students, and
foams and sparkles like champagne when
it is first drawn. It is made in Berlin
from the water of the River" Spree, wnich
accounts for its excellent flavor, so it is said.
Cafe Bauer, on Unter den Linden, is the
most popular restaurant, and through its
immense windows gay groups can be seen
ever chatting, drinking a good deal, eating
a little, reading papers, smoking and
watching the crowds of people pass by on
one of me prettiest streets in the world,
with its promenades, carriage drives, rid
ing paths and rows of beautiful trees. At
this season Unter den Linden 13 at its gay
est, and the lines of shop windows are
gorgeous with wonderful jewels, bric-a
brac, costly furs and dainty Parisian
gowns.
Suddenly there is a great commotion,
policemen catch horses by the head, the
crowd collected on the sidewalk is pushed
this way and that, and amid the general
confusion the white-plumed body guard
of the royal family appears and the im
perial carriage dashes by with some mem
ber of royalty inside. Many times the
crowd is unable to ascertain who it is, and
the curiosity of all is at a high point.
When any one belonging to the royal
family goes into a store two soldiers are
immediately stationed at the door to pre
vent any one else from entering, although
those already inside are allowed to remain
if they so desire.â Correspondence of

Left- Handed Parrots.
Superintendent Sol Stephan of the Zoo
has made all Borts of curious discoveries
in the habits and characteristics of ani
mals, the latest of which is that wild
creatures are % mostly left-handed. Mr.
Stephan has been endeavoring to verify
this observation on two parrots jateiv
brought from Mexico. He found that in
grasping a finger offered as a perch the
parrot always put the left foot forward.
Usually the tinjrer thus offered is that of
the right hand. But when tne left finger
is offered to the parrots they put forward
the right foot. There is, however, appar
ently a small residnra of preference for the
left foot. This seems to be due to the fact
that men are usually right-handed and
offer the right hand to the parrot.
The left foot is the one naturally put for
ward by the parrot in this case, and
through repetition of this action a species
of left-footednesj is induced. Mr. Ste
phan s general conclusion i 9 that there is
no evidence that the parrot is naturally
left- footed.
The appearance of that left-footedness
is due entirely to the fact that tliose who
offer the finger or food to parrots do so, as
a rule, with the right hand. Repetition of
this process makes the parrot more or less
left-handed in time. â Cincinnati Enquirer.

PRISON DIRECTORS MEET
Orders Have Been Received for
200,000 Jute Sugar
Bags.
A LIFE-TERMER DISCIPLINED.
George Bul'ock Attempted to Scale
the Prison Wall in Broad
Daylight.
The monthly meeting of the Board of
State Prison Directors was held at San
Quentin yesterday, Directors Hayes, Neff,
Devlin and Fitzgerald deing present.
Chairman DePue Â£ in the East and in hi 3
absence Director Fitzgerald presided.
Warden Hale reported the sale of 20.000
sugar bags and the receipt of orders ior
200,000 more within two days. The miil
has started up again and next week will
be running at full speed, turning out 18,000
sugar bags daily. Messrs, Hayes, Fitz
gerald and DePue were appointed a jute
committee, with power to fix the price of
bags in. the intervals between meetings, if
necessary.
The applications of Osgood, Staley and
Craddick, the Lake County whitecappers,
for commutation of sentence were laid
over for one month, at the request of Sena
tor Seawell, their attorney. The applica
tion for the parole of Mary Wilson, sen
tenced from San Francisco for arson, will
also be considered at that time.
The board tried three refractory prison
ers on charges preferred by the Warden
and found them guilty.
George Bullock, who was sent up for life
from Santa Cruz in 1893 for murder, was
charged with attempting to escape over '
the wall in daylight. Buliock is a rather
intelligent Swede, but although he had
owned up to Captain Edgar when brought
before the boaru he pleaded not guilty and
refused to make any statement, "because
it would get into the newspapers." Cap
tain Edgar told the story.
Bullock had secured a rope with an iron
hook at the end. He had thrown it twice
attempting to hook, it into the wall
and draw himself up. If he got over the
wall he intended to take to the water, and
he had fashioned an ingenious life pre
server of oiled canvas which he would in
flate at the proper time.
The prisoner wore a red shirt, the badge
of one who had attempted to escape be
fore. Hia former attempt wa3 made in
April of last year, when he cut through
the roof of his cell. For this he spent
twenty days in the dungeon.
The board found Bullock guilty, but
scarcely knew how to discipline a life
termer who had no credits to lo'te. So
they turned him over to the Warden, and
that official ordered him into solitary con
fine ment.
Thomas Vickers, serving a life sentence
for murder in the second degree commit
ted in Santa Clara and Thomas Kelly o!
San Francisco, serving seven years for as
sault to murder, forfeited three years and
three months respectively for having
opium in their possession.

A STOEY ABOUT THE SULTAN.
It Ig Offered as Explaining Why Turkey's
Navy In Useless.
"Why does the Sultan- allow what was
once a respectable fleet to rot to mece3* an
chored off Stamboul? 'Simply because he
considers an ironclad a dangerous instru
ment in the hands of any Minister or reso
lute commander. It is true that there are
no ships to guard his coasts, but also there
are none to steam up the Bosphorus and
throw a shell into his palace, and that is'
th * thing to bo thought of. *
The incident which led â : to the order for
the extinction of the Turkish navy was as
follows : A transport was bringing a num
ber of time-expired men home, when they
respectfully mutinied and begged their
officers to go below, as they wished to do
something which might not De approved of.
Some non-commissioned officers then took
command and anchored off Dolma
Bagtcheb, and, after firing a small salute
began shouting, "Long live the Sultan!"'
This demonstration caused immediate
confusion at the palace, and various high
officials were dispatched to parley with the
mutineers, but they insisted on seeing the
Minister, and when he at last appeared
they said that they knew that the Sultan
had given the money to pay them, but that
they had not received it, and they would

! not budge until they did. No arguments
were of any avail, and tno money had to
be sent for and distributed, after which the
men weiehed anchor with a cheer and gave
up the ship again.
The Sultan, however, reflected that what
a transport had done peaceably a heavily
armed man-of-war might do with evil in
} tent, and calling Hassan Pasha to him, he
| declared that he wanted no more navy. In
I this light-hearted manner a branch of na
tional defense which had been thejoride of
its officers was sacrificed to the royal fears
for personal safety, and Hassan Pasha,
wlio has steadily carried out his master's
i programme, has ever since been in high
favor and is, to all intents and purposes,
Minister for life.â London Standard.
A WOMAN WHOSE TWO DIVERSE
NATURES BECAME ACQUAINTED
BY "W. O. MORROW.
[The recent publication of an account by me
of a resident of San Francisco who lost four
years by living a life in that interval which
was totally strange to his ordinary experience
has called forth the following remarkable doc
ument written and addressed to me by a
woman, who begs that her identity be not dis
closed. It will be seen to differ radically from
the case which I presented in a way which the
document itself explains. Apparently it is
written in all sincerity and for a very useful pur
pose, as it informs those who may be thus af
flicted concerning some matters which will
have a strong interest for them; but it has a
wider usefulness than that, in approximately
unveiling one of the profoundest mysteries of
the human mind, and in suggesting wonderful
possibilities to all.â W. C. M.]
I am about 30 years of age, have a fair
education and, as may be supposed, am of
a nervous temperament. Up to the time,
about four years ago, when I fell down a
stair and suffered a severe injury of the
brain I was perfectly healthy, not at all
nervous, inclined to a quiet life and seden
tary pursuits, and was a hard student of
music, in which, by reason of the posses
sion of what were supposed to be uncom
mon talents, it was my great ambition to
become famous.
My mind was slightly deranged by my
fall, and hence I was taken to a distant
city as soon as I could be moved, in order
that I might be treated by a famous spe
cialist in nervous disorders. I quickly re
covered my physical health under bis min
istrations, but the remarkable part of it
all was that my whole nature was changed.
Not only that, but I had forgotten all the
experiences of my prior life, having even
lost every trace of knowledge of my lan
guage. I was kept secluded in a sanita
rium for several months, during which
time I had to learn everything as would
an infant; but I progressed very rapidly
and when discharged was competent to
pass as an ordinary girl.
The most fascinating subject with which
I had to deal was a study of my former
life as it was detailed to me by my patient
mother, who was my constant instructor
and comfort. It was clear to her and to
the specialist having charge of my case
that I was another being entirely. It is
interesting now to reflect that I preferred
my new self to the old, and that I
cherished a certain contempt for the
creature whom I had supplanted. It
never occurred to me at that time that
there was really only one of me, and that
these two strangely different identities
were merely distinct manifestations of a
single character.
It was only long afterward that this
wonderful phase of the subject occurred
to me, or that I came to realize the im
portance of seeking out the mystery which
lay behind my condition. In those early
months I assumed merely that my old
self had been destroyed and that a new
and wholly separate character had sup
planted it. I know now that such an as
sumption was absurd, and that there was
neither destruction nor creation. Had I
been, in that new condition, as earnest a
student as I was before and am now, my
subsequent discoveries might have been
easier and of far greater value. It is for
the purpose of showing how 1 brought
these two parts of me to an acquaintance
with each other that this is written.
From having been a student with un
common musical talents and a high am
bition, I was now merely such a gill as
one sees in fashionable society on every
handâ light-hearted, pleasure-loving, de
voted to the frivolities of life, cheerful,
fond of dancing and society, possessed of
no ambition and blind to every sense of
responsibility and power as a comely
young woman. It could hardly be ex
pected of such a girl that she would set
herself to any serious tasK, much less one
so strange and bewildering as that of
solving the complex mystery of her mind.
For a clear understanding of all that
happened afterward it is necessary for me
to reopen a painful chapter of my life and
seemingly violate the reserve and good
taste which should form part of a woman's
character. But it affects the subject of
love; and as this and all that it leads to
constitute the most vital interest of life, I
drag it forth in order to show how com
pletely I changedâhow the very funda
mental principle of my existence appeared
in different and opposing aspects.
I became deeply attached to a young
man whom I met in the fashionable so-
ciety to which I belonged. He was identi
cally like all other young men who find
pleasure in such a life. His habits were
good, his dress faultless, his dancing per
fect and his ability as a critic of art and
decorated china most entertaining. We
we^p very much in love with each other
and were arranging to be married (our ap
proaching nuptials having been already
announced), when another extraordinary
happening befell me.
It came about in this wise : My physician
never lost sight of me, but made a deep
and almost daily study of me. It is not
for me either to condemn or praise him for
an experiment which he made upon me;
it is necessary merely to say that I con
sented to it. My mother was violently op
posed, for, to tell the truth, she was not at
all backward in making me know that she
preferred me as 1 was then to the earnest,
serious student of former days. She her
self was a woman of society, and
as I was her only child she had
looked forward to the time when I
should participate with her in the treas
ures of which she was fondest. But I had
inherited the tastes of my father, who had
died when I was a child, and so I was a
great disappointment to my mother, and
no spiritual or mental sympathy had ex
isted between us before I tell down the
stair. After that occurrence she and I
were in perfect accord and she was very
happy over the fact. Naturally sue feared
that any further experiment might restore
me to my old condition, in which I would
be again, in a measure, lost to her.
An unaccountable perversity determined
me to disobey her and submit to the pro
posed experiment. I am convinced norv
that while such an act was entirely incon
sistent with my whole nature as it was
then, there was something acep within
me demanding dumbly to be recognized
and assisted. In other words, that part
which had formerly controlled my con
duct, and which was merely held in re
pression, demanded its share in the oppor
tunity for development which my living
and breathing and moving presented. It
must have been that I listened to this
pleading, or that some profound principle
within me was directing my course.
At any event I rebelled against my
mother's influence and authority and sub
mitted to the experiment.
Thisconsisted merely in a trephining op
eration. When it had been performed I
suddenly changed back to my former and
normal condition, retaining no recollec
tion of anything that Had happened in the
interval of three years. It seema some
what strange that as a frivolous society
girl I very industriously kept a journal.
A fascinating pastime of the suc
ceeding few months was a study of
it and an eager inquiry into every
detail of my life. My physician was of
great assistance to me in this, and I may
say here that his pride and gratification
over the success of his experiment were
boundless, and vhat he liked me far better
as my old self than as the light-hearted
girl whom he had lifted out of darkness.
As for my mother, her fear beinc realized, #
she was for a time unconsolabie, but lat
terly has become reconciled.
When I was perfectly restored and began
to long for the old scenes and occupations
which I had abandoned three years before,
the physician very earnestly said this to
me one day :
"You were none the less yourself before
the operation than now. The puzzling
â¢problem, which you alone can solve, if
that be possible, is this: We know that
the part of you which has been repressed
by a restoration of your skull to its former
configuration is still within you, stronger
now than before you fell down the stair,
because it has been developed by exercise
and training. Where is that part of you?
Can you find it? Surely, it was charming
in its way and it is a pity to see its activity
destroyed. Can you not drag it forth and
become acquainted with it? If so you
will have done a wonderful thing â some
thing rational, scientific, useful and nat
ural and utterJy unlike the idle and whim
sical conceit of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
The subject at once developed an extra
ordinary fascination for me. We discussed
it often and deeply, and it was ludicrously
pitiful to see the helplessness of that giant
intellect as it groped and grasped in search
of some means for bringing the other part
of me to the light.
Finally it was agreed between us that
there was only one way in the world to ac-
PALO ALTO SKELETON IN A DARK CORNER OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
[From a sketch made by a "Call" artist.]
complish the seemingly impossible; but
before proceeding to that part of the nar
rative I must revert again to my love af
fair.
Of course you have already anticipated
what course that matter took. My fiance
(whom I did not remember at all) was
utterly distasteful tome. At first 1 was
glad to have had my eyes opened con
cerning him, but then reflected that
he was perfectly worthy of such re
gard as it had been possible for me
in another condition to bestow upon
him. But to my reawakened perception
he seemed so utterly shallow, so lacking in
the depth and strength which go to the
making of men who might command my
admiration and affection, that I could
barely tolerate his society. He could not
comprehond the change which had oc
curred in me, nor realize that the nature
which he had learned to love had stepped
back into oblivion and was no more before
him. But his despair was so touching
that it grieved me to the heart, and this
greatly assisted me in the task which I
now set for myself.
The plan agreed upon by the physicicn
and me was that I should go into strict re
tirement and undergo.a long and vigorous
course of introspection, concentrating my
whole attention on the task of searching
within me for that light-hearted, genial
part which everybody had loved.
A remarkable thing happened two
months after I had put this plan in opera
tionâmy other self began to appear to me
in nay sleep. I kept a close record of
those dreams, and as I read them now I
am impressed with the pathos and tragedy
of them. At first we were distrustful of
each other. My dominating conscious
ness was my serious, studious self, ana I
call that part of me I. My other self held
me in a certain ludicrous awe, while I
treated her with a kind of disdain. But
she was so sunny, and I was really so
eager to cultivate her, that we made prog
ress and eventually became good friends
in dreamland.
My physician was the only person who
had access to me, and when I reported
these dreams to him he exclaimed that I
was in the way of success. We talkpd
long and seriously over many strange
problems that presented themselves. One
of them concerned immortality, for it was
a question which, if- either, of my selves
would live hereafter. As this was all
speculation, and is not relevant to the
business of a plain narrative, I shall give
no more space to their discussion.
I pursued* my rigorous course diligently
and faithfully, denying myself sufficient
food in order to secure a finer sense of per
ception by keeping my physical nature in
repression. Presently it came about that
my other self's visitations were not con
fined to my slumbering hours. If I kept
the room absolutely dark and my atten
tion sharply concentrated on the subject
for many hours, 1 could feel that my other
self was with me, at first externally, in the
room, and then within me. From this I
gradually passed to another stage, in
which I was often uncertain which of mv
selves was dominant. At all events, we
were in perfect harmony of purpose and
both worked assiduously to a common
end.
The first intimation I bad of another
strange thing that was going on within me
was when 1 discovered that recollections
of my fiance were no longer disagreeable.
This slowly developed into a positive lik
ing for him, and then into a great desire
to see him. The doctor was my full con
fidant in all these matters, and he took
the iiveliest interest in them.
I shall never forget the day when, after
I had shown a strong spirit of rebellion
over my confinement and a compltie lack
of interest in my quest, I boldly told my
physician that the whole proceeding was
a farce, that I had failed utterly and that
I wanted to see my mother and my lover.
The physician sprang to his feet in great
excitement and j>.sked:
"And your other self never visitÃ yon
now?"
"I have no other self!" I impatiently
exclaimed.
"And you remember all that you did
after you fell down tne stairs?"
"Of course I do," I answered. "I had
never forgotten it!"
"You remember all of your life before
that accident?"
"Certainly."
"Then, my young friend," he cried in
an ecstasy of delight, "you have won the
victory, and it is the most wonderful in
all history â you have dragged forth your
light-hearted self and made it a part of
you. Your two distinct identities, your
two separate and opposing consciousnesses,
have become amalgamated, and you, as I
see you here, are the product of both in a
most charming combination."
But it all seemed foolish and idle to me,
and I could not patiently listen to him
giving me a scientific explanation of it. I
know that as I am now I am both studious
and fond of society. Really it does seem
that I am different from what I had been
in either of my former conditions, and I
am willing to let the physician's explana
tion of it close the case
Except that I might add this: I am
very, very fond of my old lover, who is
none the less ray lover because he happens
to be my husband.
PALO ALTO'S SKELETON.
What Became of the Remaina of the
Famous Racehorse.
When the great stallion. Palo Alto died
about four years ago hundreds of thou
sands of horse-lovers felt real grief for a
short time. But the feeling of sorrow did
not last long. In fact most people forgot
all about it in a few weeks.
It was announced in the newspapers that
Senator Stanford had been offered a great
sum for the skeleton, but had refused it as
it was his intention to put in the museum
at Palo Alto after it was properly prepared
and mounted.
Whatever the Senator's intentions may
have been they were never carried out, for
the skeleton is at present in a dark unused
room of the Academy of Sciences in this
City and has been since a few weeks after
the horse's death.
It seems that Senator Stanford was
deeply afflicted by the death of his favo
rite and at once made arrangements to
preserve the remains. The bones were
shipped to this City and given in charge of
W. G. Blunt, who had orders to clean and
articulate them and put them iD present
able shape for exhibition purposes.
Mr. Blunt had a several months' job be
fore him and did his work in the basement
of tl*e Academy of Sciences. The bones
had to be boiled and bleached and put
through several processes so as to remove
all animal grease and prevent decoaiposi
tion. They bad also to be filled with poi
sonous chemicals to prevent the ravages of
vermin. The work of putting the bones
together again was a most delicate task
that consumed several weeks.
When the skeleton was in shape and the
bones occupied the same relative position
to one another that they did when Palo
Alto was alive Mr. Blunt moved it up
stairs to an unused room ready for the
inspection of Senator Stanford. But the
Senator never came to see it because he
was prostrated by the illness that eventu
ally caused his death.
Since then the skeleton has remained in
the same room. It has been covered with
a few old oil cloths and pushed into a dark
corner.
In general appearance the skeleton of
Palo Alto does not differ much from the
skeletons of other horses, but a close in
spection reveals a delicacy of bon* and
large joints that carried 'the powerful
muscles of the racehorse. The articula
tions are all unusually large, with smooth,
lubricating surfaces. Tne hoofs are very
small. The ankles are long and with
heavy joints. Although the face i$ noth
ing but bones, it really looks as though
one could see the same gentle ex
pression it bore in life. The ribs are re
markably small, but must have been very
flexible to allow the expansion of the pow
erful lun?s.
Standing alone in the musty corner, cov
ered with the ragged old cloths and the
dust of nearly three years, it is hard to
realize that those bones once belonged to
the greatest horse of the time.
Just what will eventually be the fate of
the skeleton is a matter of conjecture.
What became of the skin of the famous
racer appears to be a mystery.
A His; Black Diamond.
Henri Moisson recently exhibited at the
French Academy of Sciences a black
diamond as large as* a man's fist, which is
valued at about $40,000. It is said to be
the largest black diamond ever found, and
was picked up in Brazil by a miner work
ing in private grounds. It weighed 3000
carat?, or about twice as much as the
largest stone of the kind hitherto dis
covered. Within a short time after its
discovery, about five months ago, it lost
nineteen grammes of its weight, evidently
by the evaporation of water contained in
it. but this loss has now ceased. Its
crystalline form is nearly perfect, re
sembling that of the artificial black
diamonds formed by the crystallization of
carbon in silver crucibles.
The city having the longest blocks is
said to be Louisville, Ky.

SOCIETY
LAST week was a week of weddings.
It seems a happy coincidence that
the season which was so brilliantly
inaugurated by several fashion
able weddings should have a num
ber of stylish marriages to lend eclat to its
closing weeks.
Good taste cha racterized all three of the
fashionable weddings, two of which â the
Grant-Pond on Monday evening and the
Jarboe-liull on Thursday morning â were
solemnized at Bt. Luke*.
The weddinc of Miss Ella Goad ana C.
d Hooker on Wednesday was a
fashionable home crush. Five hundred
invited guests witnessed the ceremony and
offered their congratulations to the happy
young couple. The bridal presents, which
were displayed on the upper floor of the
Goad mansion, were without doubt the
handsomest ever seen in this Citj\ They
came from all over the world and com
prised the latest < onceits in jewels, por
celain, silverware and bric-a-brac. One
large table alone was devoted to the cut
glass, which represented a fortune in
itself.
Among the many elegant gifts the lamp
sent by Mr. and Mrs. Herman Oelrichs
was greatly admired, it is of Tiffany
glass, the now so stylish crystal and gold
effect, and of which but very few have as
yet been seen on this coast.
Another much admired present was tiie
medallion brooch surrounded with dia
monds â gems of the purest water â the gift
of Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Tevis. Dr. Harry
Tevis sent a most artistic diamond spray
with white aigrette, a fashionable hair
ornament
The coming week will keep those in the
swim quite as busy as the-preeeding ones.
There are to be large luncheons and re
ceptions, besides several minor entertain
ments.
To-morrow evening the Monday Even
ing Dancing Class will give its last dance
of this season, preparations for which
have boen made on rather a more elabo
rate than the previous affairs of this
club.
On Friday evening the Friday Night
Dancing Cla^s will close its season with a
leap year cotillon, which Miss Hobart is to
lead.
Daring the week, besides the weddings,
there \v;is quite a number of delightful
affairs, one of ihe most charming of which
was given yesterday (Saturday) afternoon
by Miss Edith McÃean and the Misses
WUHama at their apartments at the
lticheiieu. It was a tea for young people
only, and about 100 young ladies and gen
tlemen were entertained.
T. c apartments of Miss McÃean and
the If isaes Williams, which open into one
another, were converted into a most com
modious reception room and prettily deco
rated with fragrant flowers, ferns and
painis. The ladies received their young
friends alined only by Miss Hobart.
The hours of the tea were from 4 till 6.
On Friday afternoon Mrs. Lloyd Tevia
pave a charming little luncheon. Mrs.
Tevis has been giving a series of these de
lightful affairs at which never more than
eight guests are entertained.
Yesterday Mrs. Henry T. Scott gave a
child's party at her home, corner of Clay
and Laguna streets, complimentary to her
little son Harry Scott. Everything was
done for the entertainment of the little
guests, who spent a most delightful after
noon.
The informal entertainment f;iven on
Thursday evening by the Concordia Club
was one of the most original and enjoyable
affairs of the season. The handsome ball
room of the clubhouse was, with the aid
of lanterns and palms, converted into a
seeming roof garden.
The puzzling clause of the invitations,
"Bring a plentiful supply of nickels," was
explained by the numerous nickel-in-the
slot machines, which contained many
surprises for the guests.
Bill-posters with many happy hits at
popular members occupied prominent
positions in the lar-ie hall and the curtain
which divided the stage from the uudi
torium would have gladdened the heart of
the most persistent advertising man.
The programme, which was furnished
entirely by prolessional vaudeville artists,
was greatly enjoyed by the large audience
present. During the performance music
hall refreshments, beer, sandwiches, etc.,
were served.
The guests at the delightful English high
tea given by Miss Catherwood on Sunday
evening last were Miss Hobart, Miss
Clement, Miss Sherwood, Miss Clark, Miss
Smith, Miss Carroll and Messrs. F.
Crocker, Hobart, Hart, Felton, Webster
and Clement.
Mrs. H. W. Scale gave a luncheon on
Thursday in the private dining-room at
the Occidental complimentary to Miss
Whittier, whose engagement to Mr. Weir
of New York was recently announced.
Seated at tbe table were: Miss Catherwood,
Miss Zane, Miss Lougli borough, Mrs. Me-
Dermott, Miss Romie Wallace, Miss Rose
Hooper, Miss Lottie Wood, Miss Mabel
Estee, Miss Lizzie Leigh, Miss Simpson of
Stockton, Miss Bryant, Miss Jessie Fil

A NEW POINT OF LAW.
Real Estate Cannot Be Ob
tained Under False
Pretences.
Judge Bahrs Says the Law Applies
Only to Personal Property and
Money.
Judge Bahrs bas filed an opinion in the
case of James H. Cummings, in which he
lays down a new principle of law â that
there is no such crime as obtaining real
property under false pretenses.
Cummings was arrested for securing
possession of a ranch in Fresno County
belonging to Paul F. Pelton. He was
charged with obtaining property under
false pretenses, and an information against
him was filed. His attorney demurred
to the information on the ground that it
did not state a public offense, and the de
murrer was sustained by Judge Bahrs. In
rendering his decision, Judpe Bahrs said:
The concluding words or phrase of section
532, viz., "is punishable in tne same manner
and to the sajne extent as for the larceny of
the money or property so obtained," seems to
leave no other construction possible than that
the Legislature intended to limit the section to
that character of property which was subject
to larceny.
This construction is aided by the farther
consideration that, unless this construction is
correct, the Legislature has created an offense
for which it has provided no punishment. For,
as real property never was nor can it be the
subject of a larceny, the statute provides no
punishment for the offense of obtaining real
property by false pretenses. It cannot be
presumed that the Legislature created an
offense, but failed to provide a punishment
therefor. Â§
Again, the two succeeding sections of the
Penal Code, viz.: 533 and 534, treat of land
and real estate in terms which establish
another aid to the construction that real estate
was not iutended to be Included in the word
property, as used in section 532 of the Penal
Code. Again, the history of this character of
offense seems to remove all doubt as to the
character of property to which it was intended
to apply. One of the earliest English statutes
recites that "a failure of justice frequently
arises from the subtle distinction between
larceny and fraud."
This recital shows clearly that the statute
was originally intended to operate only as to
such property as was subject to a larceny. In
North Carolina it has been expressly held that
the false pretense act does not extend to the
conveyance of land. Our own Supreme Court
has by implication ruled the same way (Peo
ple vs_ Reed , 70 Cal. , 533).
The inference that section 532 has no appli
cation to the conveyance of land seems irre
sistible, and for that reason the demurrer to
the information must be sustained.
DATE OF THE DEBATE.
California and Stanford to Meet for This
Tear's Public Forensic Contest
on April 18.
A committee of arrangements for this
year's California-Stanford intercollegiate
debate met at the Palace Hotel yesterday
afternoon to decide upon the date of the
contest and the manner of choosing the
judges.
P. H. Dam was Berkeley's representa
tive and B. F. Bledsoe, R. J. "Wardall and
R. J. O'Neill were present as delegates
from Palo Alto.
It was finally agreed, after long partisan
contention, to hold the public exhibition
of forensic ability in Metropolitan Temple
on a Saturday night and April 18 was
fixed upon as the date.
Each university will name one judge
subject to the approval of the other uni
versity, and the third Judge will be chosen
by the twp__ universities together. It is
probable that all the judges will be well
known lawyers of San Francisco. Two
years ago the judges were subjected to
some broadside and scathing criticism
from the classic slopes of Berkeley after
they bad decided in favor of Stanford, and
it is the intention of both sides this year
to guard against accusations of judicial
prejudice.
Three debaters already chosen on com
petitive trials will represent each college.
The University of California will probably
choose the question and Stanford will have
tiie choice ot sides.
BAB TALKS TO THE WOMEN
Some of the Troubles Experi
enced With House Ser
vants.
IMPERTINENCE OF THE MAIDS.
A Kindly Remembrance of the Old
"Mammy" Nurses and Domes
tics Down South.
NEW YORK, Feb. 5, 1896.â This is es
sentially a feminine talk. Men can go to
the background â they seldom do much
else but form, in their rigid black and
white, a background for the beautiful flow
ers in gay, bright colors that, stupidly
enough, are called women. It seems as if
they deserved a better name. Something
that told of tbeir ability to suffer and keep
quiet; something that told of their ability
to laugh with their lips when the eyes
were burning with tears; something that
told of their ability in whatever position
they may be placed and of their superiority
to men. Oh, yes, I like men. And I gen
erally stand up for them, but I do that
because I feel that they are the weaker
vessel. There are times when a woman
likes to talk to a woman â yearns for a
woman's gossip. .Likes to hear about the
last baby, especially if it is a new one,
which, bless its heart! I could squeeze to
death for love of it, or the new frock, or
just how Jack is being sweet, or the be
havior of the perfect ladies who dominate
the kitchen, and dominating the kitchen
rule the digestions and, consequently, the
entire house. A man with a crooked
digestion doesn't love his wife or his chil
dren, and ttie woman who has to preside
over a badly cooked dinner loses iaith in
everything.
Oh, those kitchen ladies! That clever
writer Herbert Ward spoke of them as
"ciphers in society." And then he went
to prove that just such a cipher, because
she listened at the doorway and construed
things to suit herself, could send a young,
beautiful and well-bred woman to the peni
tentiary for life on circumstantial evi
dence. She thought she saw ' the young
lady stick the paper-knifeintoher cousin's
neck; she knew they hated each other,
and she was certain, in her own mind,
that this young lady had quarreled and
quarreled bitterly with hÂ«r cousin. And
after this lady had lost her youth, her hope
and her belief, a dying burglar told how
he had killed a man and usea for this pur
pose the sharp paper-knife, which the lauy,
who had quarreled with her cousin, had
played with and then dropped on the Moor.
We were a lot of women together drink
ing chocolate and eating the usual stuff
offered at a ladies' luncheon. Ido believe
ladies' luncheons are arranged in the in
terest of ladies' physicians. But we have
enough of the doctors. I drank cocoa and
ale bread and butter, and listened. Diffi
cult? Oh, no, not always. Mme. St.
Germain told of the old servants she had;
those inherited from her mother, who
were devoted to her and who sympathized
with her in every pain and ache. Pretty
Mme. Fin de Siecle looked at her with
envy. Her servants came from an intel
ligence office, and no matter how good
their references were, the results were
as nothing. There I am wrong; they
amounted to a great deal. The little
woman, with a sigh and an unhappy look
on her face, said : "My housemaid, to whom
I pay enormous wages, came to me to-day
and told me that a very expensive cup
had parted in her hands. She insisted that
she hadn't broken it, but it just 'lepp'd'
apart." She saia it couid be taken out of
her wages â her wages for six months
would not pay for it. My cook came to
me with wonderful references. She had
suited Mrs. Blank and Mrs. Dash and Mrs.
Head-of-Society so well that I wondered
they parted with her, but i soon discovered
the reason. She had a weakness, not for
cooking badly, but for drinking exten
sively. I requested her to leave in a polite
way. but as 1 am a child of the century I
declined to give her a reference. It is
queer to me how women will put their
names to references given to servants dis
charged for stealing, drinking or absolute
inability.
*' And the consequence was â well,what do
you think? A letter of six pages came to
me, presumably an anonymous letter, but
one in which I was told that if I didn't
give Maria Ann, that being the melodious
name of the cook, a reference, she
would tell every one of my friends what
she had heard said about them at the din
ner table, and that she would inform my
husband that when he was away I had a
male visitor. The man was the doctor,
and my mother was present during the
time, the very short time, in which he
managed to rid me of frightful rheumatic
pains. What did I do? I took thatletter
to the police station, and a gentleman who
measured over sis feet informed the per
fect lady who had formerly presided over
my kitchen that unless she stopped this at
once she would land in Sing Sing. You
see she made a threat that unless I gave
Maria Ann a reference such and such a
thing would be done. That made it black
mail."
My eyes were growing larger and larger,
when little Mrs. Couleur de Rose said : '-Do
any of you remember when it was rumored
that Jack and I were going to part? Mv
dear, that was the result of kindness. : The
newspapers had . my * picture and Jack's
picture in them and said that in a very
short time there would be a frightful scan
dal in- the divorce courts. Horrible?: It
was more than horrible. I cried until my
nose was red, and when I do that lam in
grief. But Jack braced me up with a 1 lov
ing kiss and a very sincere hug and forced
me out with him every afternoon for a
month either to drive or to walk. The
truth was I had. brought a maid over with
me the last time I was in Paris. When I
engaged her she asked me: 'Will niadame
pay me $25 a month and - give me her cast
off clothes to sell, or will she pay me $30 a
month and keep her clothes for her poor
relations?' I
. "I laughed, as an American woman
might, and told her that I would -give her
$30 and that she ; would get < the ; clothes,
too. , That is where I was a fool. Then I
never dreamed of locking my desk up, and
after events proved that she read every
letter 1 got. ., One day . she was very im
pertinent; I she had been rather impolite
for some time, but this special , day she
said, 'If madame wishes to meet Monsieur
Charlie .* I > will arrange ; for it. Well, I
ordered her; out of the room; refused to
see her again, told the butler :, to pay her
her wages, and. put " her ; out .. of ' the
house. . As Madame + Fin de Siecl* says,
the consequence was â this. She* knew
by sight and by name the vari
ous ft reporters who used to come ;to
ask I about i.our.dinners \ and dances, i and
she sought every one of them out, and told
them that my husband and I had quar
reled, that I was in love with a fair-haired
an named Charlie, and hinted that they
could easily ' fit it to a well-known club
.man. As you girls all know, 'i my brother
Charlie . was ' desperately in t love ;at that
time with r Miss â  Millionaire. ' He ; did not
dare to write to her, as her people objected
to him for he was poor. But he wrote the
letters tto me, and :as her ; : name * and
mine ?i happens Vto â  be â  the â¢' same, ; : ' I
used to s tear v: off ; the - envelope, S throw
the letter on the desk, and later in the day
forward it < to ! Ethel Millionaire by special
messenger. During the short time these
letters \ reposed on vmy desk this French
devil had an opportunity to read them, and
she was so vicious Herself that she thought
no woman "; could love ." her own husband,
but must have ;, an affair with some other
man. Of course there are plenty of people
who will always believe that I did Â» some
thing dreadful ; 5 in I reality, I i only helped
two love-lora people, who are now married,.
to each other, and have forgotten that I
was ever any use to them. Curious how
people forget."
I thought of my old mam^y 'way down
South, who had nursed my father, and
who, whenever there was. trouble in the
family, went to that one who was most
unhappy. We used to say of her. "Aunt
Julie never knows of anything unpleasant
in the family except to those who are in
the trouble.'.' When she got to be very,
very old, we who had been ber babies put
together and paid for a house, and gave
her a little income. When it comes to
thirty or forty men and women to make
up an allowance, nobody need give very
much, and when I went to my Southern
home on a visit it was my greatest de
light to drink tea with Aunt Julie, for,
though she was half blind, she refused to
sit down with meâ she had too much
pride for thatâ but her great-granddaugh
ter waited on me. There are no preserves
like hers nowadays, there is no such
golden corn bread, and I don't believe any
body ever knew how to cook coffee as she
aid.
Then when, the day of death came we
were all there, and women and men who
hadn't seen each other for ten or twenty
years shook hands at her grave and re
membered the years gone dv. And she
was laid to sleep at the foot of her mis
tress, and I believe she hoped that when
the resurrection day came she would be
allowed to wait upon her, for that would
be heaven* to her.
Where are these| servants nowadays?
Money cannot buy them. What is the
matter with the women in our kitchen
and the women who nurse our children?
They have no respect for the mistress who
cares for them, they have no love for the
children they nurse, and everything is a
matter of dollars and cents. Whose is the
fault? I cannot believe Jthat it is entirely
with the mistress.
Not long ago a dear friend of mine hired
a maid; four weeks after she came to the
house she was struck down with typhus,
not typhoid, fever. During her long ill
ness she was faithfully nursed by her mis
tress; when she was able to go out in the
fresh air her mistress took her in her own
carriage; when strength had* fully re
turned to her she gave her mistress a
month's notice.
The too kind woman looked at her and
said: "Why, Mary, how can you leave me
when I have cared for you through all
your sickness?"
"That is the very reason," she answered ;
"if you had been as much of a lady as I
thought you were when I hired myself to
you, you wouldn't have done it."
A less flagrant case was this: An Eng
lish laay was told by her own maid that
she would not come to America with her.
As she had been very kind to her she dis
charged her, and took one who brought
good recommendations, into which she in
quired carefully. Before leaving London
she paid Â£5 to have her taught hairdress
ing and Â£10 to make her an adept in mani
curing. All the way over the maid was
sick, and so of no use to her mistress.
Her first month was up two days after
landing. When she was paid she said:
"You will have to get somebody else; lam
going to leave this afternoon." An abso
lute cross-questionicg brought out the
truth.
She felt sure that this lady would have
her properly trained for a first-class maid,
and that it would cost her nothing to come
over. And the consequence was, as
Madame Fin de Siecle says, that a lady
used to having a maid wait upon her was
left without one in a strange country.
Is gratitude an unknown quantity? Just
among ourselves, you and that other
woman and me, we three women together,
I thinlr it is. "Thank you" is said as one
says "Good morning," but it is usually
for a nosegay, the picking up of a fan or
a handkerchief. It is not in appreciation
of the real kindnesses of life. It is true
that when we do what is right and woman
ly we ought not to want "Thank you" ;
but, alas I we are only women, and we
like gratitude expressed in some way.
Men laueh at us for expecting it. The
best of them do what is right, and are sat
isfied because they have done it, but we
women, well, we are a little weaker, and
when we deny ourseives some good thing
for somebody else's sake, when we give
the helping hand to somebody, or when
we aid somebody by making the roueh
path of life a little bit easier to tread, we
like to think that what we do is appre
ciated. And we think so much of a little
bit of gratitude. A woman can nurse the
man she loves through a long illness â she
may get no rest, she may get no change,
and the sickroom will "be her abiding
place, day in and day out ; but she is satis
fied, oh I so thoroughly satisfied, if, when
that man is well, he pats his arm about
her and whispers some loving words that
tells of appreciation. But nine times out
of ten, men take the service of women for
granted.
A woman may take two or three of her
old frocks, brush them and freshen them,
make them over into one nice one and
hand them to that poor relation who needs
a gown, And if the recipient will only
say, "I was glad to get the frocK, fcr I
know you put yourself to much trouble
about it, and I thank you," then the busy
days will be as nothing, and that woman's
heart will be full of happiness for many,
many days. It is true, I suppose, that the

mankind will ever realize the greatness of
a womanly womanâ if they will know
what it means to be mothers, daughters

great troubles attached to each vocation.
I suppose not. When they do, when they
realize all that a real woman can suffer for
dear love's sake, can suffer with a smile,
they will fall down and worship her; but
that will be when the millennium comes.
However, I do believe that when it ar

HIS MARVELOUS ESCAPE
Result of an Early Morning Shoot
ing Affray in Quincy
Alley.
John Wilson Fired at by Thomas Nolan
and Saved by a Button on
His Trousers.
Thomas Nolan, a laborer, was arrested
at an early hour yesterday morning on
Pine street by Policeman J. M. Dwyer on
the charge of assault to murder.
Dwyer, while patrolling his beat, heard
a pistol shot from the direction of Quincy
alley. He ran toward the alley and met
a young man who was running at full
speed followed by Nolan, with a revolver
in his hand. Dwyer called upon the flee
ing young man to stop, and at the
same time grabbed Nolan. As he did
so Nolan raised the revolver and Dwyer
shouted: "Don't shoot; I'm an officer!"
Before he could grasp Nolan's right hand,
Nolan deliberately fired at trie young man
and he dropped to the ground. Dwyer
promptly wrested the revolver from Nolan
and turned him over to policeman Jerry
Dinan, who had arrived on the scene.
The young man who was shot said his
name was John Wilson. A hasty examin
ation showed that he had had a miracu
lous escape from death. The bullet had
penetrated the outer edge of his coat, torn
a crease along the vest and striking a but
ton upon his trousers was deflected down
ward and passed out at the bottom of his
trousers without grazing his skin.
Both young men live in Oakland and at
i tended the Green-Needham prizefight on
i Friday night. They were both drunk and
Wilson was charged with disturbing the
peace. He told the officers that he was
walking through the alley when Nolan at
tempted to rob him.
Yesterday after he got sober he said he
had no recollection of the affair as he was
too drunk at the time. Nolan refused to
say anything as to the cause of the
I trouble.
"When the case acainst Wilson was
called in Judge Conlan's court yesterday
morning he pleaded guilty and the Jud^e
postponed sentence till Thursday, re
manding Wilson into the custody of the
police. Nolan's preliminary examination
on the charge of assault to . murder waÂ»
fixed for Thursday.
Wilson's attorney claimed that postpon
ing his sentence till Thursday was simply
a, subterfuge to evade the recent decision
by J udge Wallace in the Proctor case to
the effect that witnesses cannot be held in
prison prior to a preliminary examination.
He intends to apply for a. writ of habeas
corpus.

Pacific Heights Won the Game.
The Pacific Heights and John Swett Gram
mar Schools met on the Central Park gridiron
yesterday afternoon in an interscholastic game
in emulation of the football rivalry of the two I
universities, and the wearers of the blue and I
gold administered an unquestioned defeat to
the John Swett eleven, sporters of the red.
Three of the four touchdowns were scored in
the second half, when the Pacific Heights Bet
and maintained a lively pace without their
captain, who was retired with a broken
thumb.
Following is the score, and the men as they
opposed each other: .

One Made Life Miserable, While the Other Gave
' Her Happiness,
Miss Dely was down at the spring place.
It was an area of soft turf a few yards
square, worn by footpaths, lying in a basin
betw. en two hills. The branch ran through
it and kept the grass green and tender, and
the spring, which bubbled cold and de
licious at the foot of a giant planetree, con
tributed its largess to this end. A little
square of wet earth just below the spring
was almost constantly marked by hoof-
An expert rider, swinging downward
from his seat, could easily f,rasp the long
handled gourd that hung from the tree's
brown bole and refresh himself and his
horse at the same time.
Dely bad spread the long breadths of
cotton sheeting, which had just come
from her loom, on the grass to bleach, and
seemed now to be studying the hoofprints.
Her eyes wandered from them to the
farmhouse on the hill, and again to the
mountain which lifted its blue shoulder
above the crest of the nearest hill.
''It do pinted ly seem like ma gits wus
ser and wusser the hull time. I ain't hed
a mite of peace all summer, " said Dely,
addressing the hoofprints.
"Why she should suspicion 'at them ar
hoofmarks war made by Alec Penlan's
horse I cayn't surmise. An' Bob Wilson
a-comin' reg'lar an' the license got an'
everything."
"Oh, Miss Dely, Miss Dely 1" called a
soft, drawling voice.
" WHOA ! " CRIED WILL, AND HE STOPPED AND STARED.
Dely faced quickly around.
"That you. Bud Harris? What yer
want? Don't holler thetaway!" with a
furtive glance at the house.
She looked at the boy as calmly as if he
had been a post. And yet ne was a pic
ture. He set all hygienic theories at defi
ance. Corn brad and bacon, sodden bis
cuit and buttermilk, stewed beans plenti
fully "seasoned"' with bacon, made the
menu by which Bud liad come to such a
glory of satiny, olive skin, clear eyes and
sturdy growth.
'â¢What yer want?" repeated Miss Dely,
imperturbably.
BÂ«d was only 8 ami Dely was 29.
"He's over yonâ back* o' the sprinc
houseâwaitin' ter see yer," said Bud,
breathlessly.
Looks of pleasure and fright chased each
Other over Mi*s Dely's face.
"You go along, Bud, an' don't tell no
body!" she said.
Bud giggled, caught his breath and then
gazed soberly after Miss Dely, who started
at once for the springhouse.
"Them two folks is in love," thought
Bud, reasoning correctly, as even eight
years old can reason on this question.
"Bnt ef she's in love wi' Alec, what for
air 3he a-eoin' to marry Bob Wilson?" pur
sued Budl
This puzzled him and Mrs. Townshend's
big flock of guineas jnst then came like a
pray wave up the hollow and invited a
fusillade of pebbles.
Miss Dely opered the door of the spring
house and went in.
It was clean and sweet and cool, and
pervaded by a soft gloom, only broken by
the streaKS of light that marked where the
chinking had fallen from between the logs.
The stone floor was damp and mossy.
Jars of milk and butter stood in a deep
trough along one side, and the water went
purling between them, dripped from the
trough into a channel and went gurgling
off into the branch.
Miss Dely bent her face to the widest
crevice between the Jogs.
"What you want, Alec?" It was a
shaggy head that approached hers and a
]>air of keen blue eyes, rimmed by blonde
brows, already a trifle frosted, that were
framed in by the edpes of the iogs.
"Jest ter see yer, Dely," was the reply,
in softest tones. "Jest ter see yes once't
more. I cayn't come ter the weddin' â yer
couldn't expect that â "
"Why not?" interrupted Dely.
"She axes me why!" groaned Alec.
â¢'Come out hynr, Dely. It ain't comfable
to talk wi' them logs atween us."
"I cayn't,' answered Dely. "Mall see
me. And I don't reckon hit's any use
talKin'."
"Hit's the las' time," pleaded Alec.
"When I give yer up ter Bob Wilsonâ"
"Yer didn't give me up," interrnpted
Dely, almost angrily. "Yer couldn't, 'cause
yer'never hed me."
"An" why didn't I hey yer?" demanded
Alec, piteously. 'I 'lowed 'twere all set
tled, only we hed ter brek it ter yer ma
â Miss Townshend's so sensitive.
Oh, Dely, come out hyar."
"I amt er-goih' ter. You war eleven
year a breakin' it an' Bob Wilson only tuk
two moDths," said Miss Dely, the wild
apple tint in her cheeks growing rosier.
"An' it never war all settled nohow. Ye
hed ver chance an' ye didn't tek it. I
dnnno why. Ef you reely hed cared for
"Ef I bed cared fer ye!" said Alec.
"Don't yer know I cared fer ye?"
He gave her a look of such intense af
fection that she grew pale and felt like
Jainting. Then, like the man he was, he
lost his advantage by beginning to tramp
up and down the narrow space in the rear
of tne springhouse r groaning and gesticu
lating.
"I wish I'd a fit him. I vow I wish I'd
a fit him!"
Dely watched him, at first curiously and,
no doubt, with a certain pleasnre. He had
bad his chance and had not improved it,
and now he was being punished for it, a
kind of poetic justice which appeals to
eouJ*" of all grades.
Bi t as the scene went on it became
amuiiner. Miss Dely began togiizgle; then
as the hysterical impulse grew stronger
she laughed with all ncr might.
"Dely, Dely 1" cried Alec, horrified. "Are
the heart of woman so hard? I 'lowed ye
al'ays knew 'at I loved yer ever sence we
went ter schule together over yon," sobbed
Alec, in a rush of emotion that attested his
absolute sincerity.
Miss Dely's mood changed. She began
to cry heartbrokenly.
"What's the use er-tellin* on it now?
she sobbed.
Big Alec Penland grew as weak as a
baby.
"Dely, if you won't come out hyar I m er
comin'in thar," be cried, and in another
minute he had her in his strong arms.
It was only for a second, however. Dely's
sobs stopped suddenly. She struggled to
get free.
"Aint yer 'shamed, Alec Penlan', an'
me most ez good ez married ter Bob
Wilson!"
Alec released her instantly and stood
looking at her, his face drawn and pale.
"You act like a plumb fool, Alec,"
whimpered Dely.
"I reckon mabby I do, ' said Alec,
humbly.
He looked at her, his heart sinking, but
he saw that she was trembling for all her
harsh words.
The insurgent love dared to snatch at a
new-born hope.
"Dely!" he began.
"Dely. Dely, Dely!'' called a sharp, men
acine voice.
"Thai's ma!" exclaimed Dely, wildly.
"Oh, Alec, don't let her see ye. She'll
bang her head ergin the wall wus 'n ever
she banged hit when Bob axed fer me, an'
she banged hit ersrin when Susan Harris
brung home my weddin' gown."
If she meant to cut him to the heart by
this allusion to her nuptial finery, she
failed. He only looked at her in a curious
way and then asked in the quietest of
voices :
"What did Bob do?"
"Nothin', only jest laffed! Oh, Alec,
why won't yer go? She's er-comin' !"
Alr-c went, seeing that the danger was
imminent.
Mrs. Townshend called again. "I'm
comin', ma," and Miss Dely hastened.
"What air you er-foolin' away your time
for down thar, an' here's Jim Wilson been
ter tell yer that Bob's took powerful bad
an' the doctor ain't no hopes on him
hardly. Er pretty piece er work thet is,
an' you'll git talked about fine. An' ye
got yer weddin' dress an' all," jeered the
old woman.
Miss Dely grew sick all over. Was there
then no escape from this life?
"Jim wanted yer ter go over thar, but I
telled him I wouldn't hey no sich work as
thet â my da'ter running after a man thet
away." .
They had reached the house now, and
there in the living-room was the wedding
gown Dely had been so proud of.
She began to weep.
"You shet up, Dely Townshend !" cried
her mother. "Ef yer don't I'll bang my
head all to pieces orgin the wall!" and she
gave it a hard thump.
"Oh, ma, don't, don't!" shrieked Dely.
"I won't cry. I won't do nothin'."
The old woman sat down in her splint
rocker.
"Yer'd better not, then."
The menace in her black eyes meant
business, and Dely, choking down her
sobs, went about getting dinner.
Poor Bob Wilson never recovered from
his sudden illness. He begged to see Miss
Dely, and once in the dead of midnight
she stole out trembling and went and
stayed an hour by his sick bed. â 
"I hate ter leave ye," said Bob, kindly.
"But thar's Alec thinks a heap on ye.
'Twas a mighty squar' thing his givin' ye
up ter me like ne did."
"Oh, Bob, don't talk thetawayl" cried
Miss Dely.
Hers was a sincere soul and here was
Bob dying, but she was absolutely power
less to tell him the whole truth.
"Well, well! It's all right, I BUppose,"
said Bob, weakly.
He was so nearly done with this life that
its loves and hopes did not matter much.
Dely's wedding gown was Dresently put
away in the old family chest and 'Dely
went about her duties with a sadder face.
"A widder 'thout ever bein' married,"
sneered her mother, and the kind neigh
bors added that it "'peared like Dely
Townshend was pintedly meant fer an old
maid."
In the few weeks that followed Bob Wil
son's death, Alec Penland did a deal of
thinking and day-dreamine. Pleasant
thoughts and pleasant dreams they were,
too, one would guess by the serene ex
pression of his strong, kind face. He
worked some at "fixing things" around
home.
Alec had lived alone, keeping house for
himself ten years or more, and it is put
ting it mildly to say that the appearance
of the house both inside and out indicated
that such had been the case.
But this did not trouble Alec. He was
apt to sit after supper smoking nis pipe
on the front stoop without a thouctit of
the unwashed dishes, and watch the smoke
curling up from the Widow. Townshend's
chimney.
"She's a good gal 'n 's neat 's a pin."
he mused one night. "Bob was a better
man then me, some ways. He'd a done
it, an' I'll do it, an' I won't wait no longer,
blessed ef I do."
He knocked the ashes out of his pipe,
put out the cat, and went to bed and slept
soundly all night.
The next day found him at Mrs. Towns
hend's door.
The bees were humming in the lilacs,
and the March winds were soft atid warm.
The house was wide open. Mrs. Towns
hend was carding cotton. She gave him
but a curt welcome.
"I bope you are well enough, ma'am,"
said Alec, with deference.
"I'm only jest tol'able," was the cold re
ply.
"Where is Miss Dely?" ventured Alec
presently.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
"She's down ter the springplace, but I
don't reckon that consarns you."
Alec's heart beat hard, but he answered
boldly:
"Yes it do, ma'am, bekase me an' Dely
air goin' to git married.''
"No, you ain't," snapped the old
woman. "I ain't goin' ter have you
hangin' 'round here tryin* to steal my
da' ter."
Alec's face lighted. If he had known
Shakespeare he might have said:
"1 thank thee, Jew, for teaching me
that word."
But he only repeated:
"Yes, we be."
"I say you siian't hey 'er. Alec Penlan',
you git out o' my house."
Alec sat immovable.
"Ef you git her you'll wish yer hadn't,"
sairi Mrs. Townshend.
Alec's face hardened.
"Dely is a good gal an' yon nin't no call
to talk thataway about yer da't*r. I
don't ever want to hear no more o' that."
She stared at him dumfounded. then,
starting up, hurried to the side wall and
beat her head against it till the partitions
creaked.
Alec glanced around. A long wool scarf
hung over a hook. On another hook were
suspended two or three saddle girths.
In another second Mrs. Townshend sud
denly felt herself grasped around the waist
and borne forcibly to the old splint rocker.
She screamed, struggled, kicked and bit,
and though a church member said some
awful words,
It was of no use. Deftly and quickly,
though as gently as possible, Alec bound
her firmly in thechair and bound the chair
to the tall, four-poster bedstead, and con
fined her hands and feet.
â¢'l'pe reely afeared ye might hurt yerself,
Mis' Townshend," he said kindly.
"Alec Penlan', how dare ye! Turn me
loose, turn me loose! I'll put yer in the
penitentiary !" yelled the victim.
"Sho, now, I wouldn't! There? Don't
fret! Will is er comin' back afore sun
down, yer know, an' nell untie yer. I
wish yer a good day, Mis' Townshend."
He backed ont of her presence like a
courtier, carefully shut all the doors and
hurried to the spring-place.
Poor old woman! She gave one or two
discordant cries, and then astonishment
got the better of anger. By this simple
expedient oi beating her head against the
wall she had all her life ruled with an iron
rod her whole family. Was it possible it
was going to fail now?
Alec found Miss Dely sitting on the steps
at the springhouse, churning. She wore a
clean, d%rk-blue gown, and the cream
which foamed up around the dasher was
not whiter than her cape bojinet. She
looked, Alec told himself, as pretty as a
posey.
She smiled at him and bade him
"Howdy!"
Aiec thought of Bob Wilson.
''Thar shan't nobody say he war a better
man than me!" he muttered.
He went boldly up to Miss Dely and
kissed her. Then he laid his shaggy head
close and whispered something in her ear.
"Oh, no, no, no, Alec! Mad beat her
head off."
"No, she won't. She cayn't.* 1
Dely looked scared.
"You ain't killed her, Alec?"
"Oh, Lordy, no! She'sâ gone a-visitin'."
Mis 3 Dely pot up quickly.
"Alec, what you been er-doin'?"
"Nothin'l But I'm goin' ter kerry yer
off."
"No, you ain't! I cayn't go!"
"Now, Dely!" coaxingly. "Be a good
gal. Come!"
"I cayn't! Alec, what you done with
ma?"
"You come an' I'll tell yer."
'I cayn't ! The butter ain't come."
"Darn the butter! Come!"
"No, no, Aiec! I cayn't!"
"But I say yer cot ter."
Miss Dely protested, but her resistance
grew weaker. Perhaps it was the tender
words he kept whispering in her ear that
sapped her strength.
He half led, half carried her down the
bank of the branch into a woodsy bridle
path. There stood his big black mare
Molly, all saddled.
He helped Dely to the top of a bowlder
close by, and then climbed into the saddle.
"Come!"
He reached out his hand and caught
her*.
"No, Alec, no!"
But she put her other hand on his shoul
der and sprang up behind him.
"Oh, I cayn't go, Alec!"
"Yer cayn't help it," he said triumph
antly, and the mare cantered down the
Â«haded roadway toward Asheville.
Three hours later, when the westering
sun was low, they were slowly returning
in the same way along the same road.
And so returning, who knows what pleas
ant castle-building was interrupted by the
sight oi a wood wagon jogging along in
advance of them.
"There's Will!" exclaimed both.
Abreast of the team Alec drew rein.
"Whoa!" cried Will, and he stopped and
stared.
"Ef I were you, Will," said Alec gently,
''I'd hurry home. Yer ma needs yer. An
Will, you tell 'er 'at Dely an' me is mar
ried, 'n' ez fur ez we're got we like it fust
rate."
As he rode on he turned to look over his
shoulder into her smiling, rosy face.
"Don't we, honey?"
Dely's looks answered. She was not an
emancipated woman, but she had changed
tyrants. It was the happiest hour of Ler
life.â New York Tribune.
Another Veteran Dead.
Lincoln Post No. 1, G. A. R., will hold funeral
services to-day over the body of C. W. H. Coney,
who died at Pacific Grove on the 3d Inst. He
enlisted early in the war, and served in the
following Massachusetts regiments: Thirty
third and Forty-first Infantries and the Third
Cavalry, and lost an arm at the battle of Ope
quan.Va., September 19, 1864, but was not
mustered out until July, 18G5. He was for
several years newspaper mail cleric in the San
Francisco Postoffice, and months ago, in antici
pation of his decease, gave minute directions
as to his funeral. His body will be conveyed
to his birthplace in Massachusetts for burial.
It has been decided to celebrate the genii
centennial of Wisconsin, perhaps with an
industrial exhibition.

They Claim That They Have
Been Unjustly Criticized

â¢ ________
A NEW ACCUSER FOR HEALY.
Captain Healy's Friends Seem to Be
Confident That He Will Come
Out Unscathed.
"Captain Healy seems to have the cinch
on this whole outfit," remarked one of the
favored few admitted in room 83 of the
United States Appraisers' building during
the sessions of the court of inquiry at
present investigating the charges against
the veteran navigator.
"When the investigation opened," con
tinued the officer, "all persons connected
with the case were strictly charged not to
reveal a word of what took place during
the sessions of the court. By consent of
counsel on both sides it was agreed that
absolutely nothing â not even the names of
the witnesses â should be given out for
publication. This agreement was in the
nature of a formal compact, and all con
cerned were reminded that a point of
honor was involved in the matter of strict
compliance with its terms.
"Our side, at least, has kept its plighted
wdrd. We have not revealed any of the
proceedings of the investigation ; we have
refused to be interviewed ; we have refused
to give even our names for nublication.
But every morning what do we see? Long
articles in some of the papers preceded by
headlines and abounding in pointed shafts
of ridicule directed at the prosecution.
We find ourselves, the younger officers of
the fleet, held up to the execration of the
public as a crowd of ignorant, immoral,
and utterly incompetent boys, engaged in
a foul and traitorous conspiracy against I
our lawful iuper-ior.
"But that is not all. The reports of the
investigation are very complete; that is,
nothing of importance is omitted; but
everything is represented in a manner
favorable to the captain. The old man
was well hauled over the coals the other
day for talking to reporters, and I guess
he deserved it. Lieutenant Reynolds was
obliged to remind him that his honor as
an officer and a gentleman demanded that
he remain silent and divulge nothing of
what might take place during the inquiry.
"As for poor Daniels and the rest of us,
they call us the 'triumvirate,' and strongly
hint that we are conspiring to ruin the
captain, that we have no status, in the
service and are nothing but graduated
cabin-boys. We are called a gang of in
grates and scored as the very offscouring
of creation. But when it comes to con
spiracies I know of a bigger combine than
any three young lieutenants could get up,
and that Is the caoal of Captain Healy's
compatriots. They are bound to see the
captain cleared of the charges against him
by fair means or by foul.
â¢'Our side has kept its word long enough,
and I for one am going to ask that we be
released from further obligations of se
crecy. The Heaiy side of the case has
been before the public long enough, and it
is time for us to have a show. When Dr.
Sharp comes his testimony will knock the
Healy side into a cocked hat. He kuows
things that the other witnesses knew but
were afraid to tell. He is independent of
Captain Healy, and will tell the truth.
But I will be glad when the affair is over,
â¢for I am heartily sick of being stigmatized
as a disgrace to the service."
The Healy people seem to regard the
victory as theirs. The old captain says
nothing, since he rather dislikes being
reprimanded for speaking of the inquiry;
but as each charge against him falls flat he
smiles aqniet little smile all to himself
and glances archly over at the corner
where Messrs. Daniels & Co. sit nursing
their impotent wrath.
"The case against the captain has fallen
through,"" said a warm personal friend of
Healy's. whose rank entitles him to be
present at the sessions of the court. "The
prosecution, in fact, has no case whatever,
and to-day they begged the captain's side
to allow them a little time in order to
fetch Dr. Sharp from the East. They ex
pect great things from Sharp, but they are
going to be badly fooled. All that Dr.
Sharp can do will be to show his deadly
Eersonal enmity toward the captain. He
as. in fact, sworn repeatedly that he
would 'do Healy up' whenever he should
get a whack at him."
"But what a sorry whack he is going to
get!" pursued the captain's admirer.
"Poor Captain Healy may be a first-class
navigator "and an efficient officer, but he is
like a child when it comes to defending
himself in court. When Daniels, Dorry
and Emery were doing their worst to
prove that their commander npver drew a
sober breath from the 10th to the 25th of
August, 1895, there were in the City sev
eral captains and officers of whalers who
could testify directly to the contrary.
These were Captain Louis Wiliiams of the
Hidalgo, Captain A. H. McGregor, Cap
tain Bonnifield of the Lakme, First
Officer Philip Montgomery of the
Narwhal. and several others, be
sides Richard Nelson, assistant keeper of
iho lighthouse and relief station at Point
Barrow, who was sent by Captain Aitken,
his superior officer, to warn Captain Healy
against attempting to enter the polar sea,
as the danger from ice would be very great
and the trip to Point Barrow unnecessary,
seeing that the station was amply sup
plied.
"Now, thpse whalers were anchored
off Icy Cape during the month
of August, 1895, waiting for the
ice to break in order to effect
an entrance into the Arctic Ocean. The
Bear and several other v.essels were there
during the same period. There was
nothing to do but to wait. Under such
circumstances the officers made the best
of the leisure time at their disposal, dining
with each other and visiting continually.
Thus it happened that the officers whom I
mentioned, and about twice as many
more, saw Captain Healy every day. The
captain knew these men were in town and
was in friendly relations with them, and
never thought of asking them to testify.
His attorneys learned accidentally of their
presence in the City and immediately had
them . cited to appear. The testimony
of these officers utterly broke down the
accusations of the prosecution.
"Anyhow," concluded the captain's
right bower, "you may be sure the old man
will come ont on top. His accusers are
only a trio of young fellows without ex
tended service in northern waters. Their
intended victim is a man who has made
his mark in the history of Arctic explora
tion. It would hold up the American
Nation to universal and deserved ridicule
if one of its most faithful and efficient
servants were allowed to surfer indignity
at the hands of these three youths, who
came upon the earth long after Captain
Healy had gained nis laurels in his coun
try's service."
At the urgent, request of the prosecution
further proceedings in the investigation
have been postponed until the 20th inst.,
when it is expected Dr. Sharp will be here
to testify against Captain Healy.
Henry Laboochere says the government
of the "piratical South Africa Company,"
in that part of South Africa covered by its
concession from England, "is the basest
and vilest of gvernmenta that the human
mind can well conceive."
ADMIRED BY MAXIMILIAN.
Komantio Story of a Magnificent
Gold Bronze Timepiece.
â¢ There'has lately been placed in the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art a clock with a
most interesting history. It is also a work
of art of the highest order, being possibly
the finest piece of real gold-bronze in the
United States.
The name of the sculptor who designed
it has been obliterated for unknown
reasons, but it is known that, the clock was
made for the first international exposition
held in Paris in 1855. It created consider
able stir in the art world at the time and
was awarded the highest prize and a
medal for that class of work. The work
was so far in advance of an/thing of the
THE CLOCK THAT WAS COVETED BY MAXIMILIAN.
kind that had been done up to that time
that it was sought by the agents of many
of the royal houses of Europe. The price
was placed at 50,000 francs, but no buyers
came forward and it remained in the
hands of the dealers.
One of the greatest admirers of th*e clock
was the then Archduke Maxmilian,
brother of the Emperor of Austria, but as
he had no money was unable to make even
an offer. But every time he visited Paris
he spent hours in admiration of it. It was
still in Paris when he sailed for Mexico to
become Emperor in 1864.
As Emperor of Mexico, Maxmilian was
able to bestow many favors, and was
showered with presents from those who
wanted a chance to become rich in the
New World. Among those was a French
nobleman .whose finances had reached a
low state, and wlio desired a good position
from Maxmilian. He consulted Napoleon
111, who, knowing the Mexican Emperor's
admiration for the clock, suggested that if
he took it to him as a present he could
have anything he asked for.
The nobleman went to all his friends and
relatives and raised 40,000 francs which he
induced the dealer to take for the clock.
But this left him almost without funds, so
that hÂ» was compelled to start to Mexico
in a sailing vessel that consumed many
months on the voya c. Tbe day he
arrived in the City of Mexico be heard that
Maxmilian had been shot in Queretaro.
The event caused bitter enmity against
all sympathizers of royalty, so the noble
man was compelled to get out of the conn
try with his clock a3 quickly as possible.
He reached Acanulco after a'most exciting
journey over the mountains, and paid
every sou he had to the captain of a small
vessel for passage to San Francisco.
Arriving here "broke" he sought to sell
the clock, and lifter telling his story found
a purchaser in F. L. A. Pioche, a promi
nent French banker here at the time, and
left for his home. How much he received
for the clock is not known.
Mr. Pioche put the clock in the parlors
of his residence on Stockton street,* and it
remained there until after he committed
suici c in 1876, when it was turned over to
M. Thellar, to whom it had been left in
the will. Mr. Theilar found it an elephant
on his hands, and he had to store it away.
For nearly twenty years it was practically
buried, until Mr. Thellar, thinking that it's
beauties might as well te enjoyrd by
somebody, sent it over to the Art Insti
tute.
To minutely describe the clock would be
an almost impossible task. It is really a
clock and two candelabra, and in their
present position show to the best advan
tage against the mantel of dark ebony.
The center piece, or clock proper, is about
three feet long and two feet high, and has
a figure on either side, one with a hunter's
horn and the other with cymbals. On top
of the dial are other instruments entan
gled amid olive leave*. Each of the can
delabra is about four feet high and repre
sents a bunch of St. Joseph lillies, with a
figure seated at the base. These figures are
also representative of music.
The workmanship on the whole group
is of the highest order, and was surely
done by some master. The style of the
work indicates a careful training in the
schools of Italy. Although over forty years
old, the bronze is as bright and brilliant as
though just from the founder's hands. It
really looks like polished gold.
TO BE CONSISTENT.
Why a Really Legal and Satisfactory
Will was Broken.
Copies of the depositions in the matter
of the estate of James A. Bradley are being
sent on to Minneapolis, where another
phase of the contest over his estate is
going on.
Bradley left a will, devising his property
to heirs-at-law, just as if he had died in
testate. He made no bequests, but an
nounced that his heirs should each have
his or her legal share, and yet the will wai
contested. The reason iorthis was that at
the time he drew the will, Bradley made
deeds for $100,000 worth of property in
Minneapolis, transferring the same to
various charities in North Carolina. The
heirs want these deeds set aside, on the
ground that the old man was not of sound
mind when lie made them. The will was
made at the same time, and so to give
color to tbe suit to set aside the deeds, and
to be consistent, the will was contested.
The contest of the will came before
Judge Sanderson some weeks ago, and the
will was broken. Now tbe suit to set aside
the deeds will go on in the case.

Instead of converting into silver and
taking home the war indemnity paid by
China, the Japanese have decided to leave
it as a gold deposit in London, ahd it
would teem the Mikado dances as nimbly
to the fiddling of the money power as any
other potentate on the globe.
A little pressure and encouragement
from Washington might have induced the
Japanese Government to purchase Ameri
can silver with the gold paid as a war in
demnity by China, and the silver could
then have been used to promote local in
dustries in Japan or to buy r.aval and
military supplies from the United States;
but the pressure was not applied.
ORIENTAL COMPETITION.
Â» The resolution adopted by the meeting
called by the Chamber of Commerce and
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation, urging upon Congress the appoint
ment of a commission to investigate the
extent of Japanese competition with
American manufactures, comes none tpo
soon. The only fault with it is that it is
not broad enough. It should have called
for an investigation of the whole question
of Oriental competition, including China
as well as Japan, and the increasing pro
duction of raw material as well as that of
manufactured goods.
An article published in a recent number
of the American Economist, compiled mainly
from reports of British Consuls, affords
abundant evidence that it is not in manu
factures only that we are to rind competi
tors in the Orient. These reports show
that the competition is to be particularly
strong in the wool and the cotton indus
tries and is to include all branches of
them from the production of the raw ma
terial to the manufacture of the finished
goods.
The increase in the production of wool
and cotton in China has already become
one of the notable features of the Oriental
trade. It is stated that in the last fifteen
years the exports of sheep's wool from the
Mongolian provinces of the emoire have
increased eighteenfold, and the limit has
not yet been reached. In 1886 the cotton
exports from Shanghai amounted, in round
numbers, to 37,000,000 pounds, of which
Japan took something over 6,000,000
pounds. By 1894 the total export had in
creased to 124,000,000 pounds and the Japa
nese purchase to over 76,000,000 pounds.
It is noted, moreover, that the increased
demand did not increase the price
whence the conclusion is drawn that the
supply is by no means inadequate to any
drain that may be made upon it.
One difficulty that has hampered the de
velopment of the wool and cotton produc
ing provinces has been (he lack of cheap
transportation. That difficulty, it is said,
will soon be overcome by the construction
of railroads which have been already un
dertaken. At present it costs $2 a bale to
bring wool from Kuei-hua-eheng, the
center of the wool provinces, to the
seaboard, but by the proposed rail
way the coat will be reduced to 50 cents.
That, of course, will largely stimulate
the production and give the Chinese
woolen-mills cheaper raw material than
any other mills in the world. When to
that is added cheap labor, it will be seen
what great advantages the Orientals will
have in a free-trade market. Nothing can
save the workingman of civilized countries
from the disastrous effects of that compe
tition save a complete protection in his
home market. That will be necessary even
in England itself, and in America it will
be so imperative that to neglect it would
be an economic crime.
A MINISTEES' VIOTOEY.
A most astonishing condition of affairs
is reported from El Paso. Already had
Texas redeemed itself in the eyes of the
country by an extraordinary session of the
Legislature called to enact a law against
prize-fighting when Corbett and Fitzsim
mons were preparing for their meeting.
But El Paso, which is just within the bor
ders of Texas (New Mexico being close at
hand) appears to have a considerable
population quite different from that
of the other parts of the State.
Through the efforts of the min
isters of that city, Congress has passed
and the President signed a bill prohibit*
ing prize-fights in the Territories, and this
puts a stop to the supposed intention of
the fighters to meet on New Mexican soil;
and because the preachers have done this
some so-called "business men" of El Paso,
we are informed, are highly indignant and
have threatened to withdraw their support
from the churches.
This is amazing news from an Ameri
can city. It means to Bay that by
these people churches are not wanted
in El Paso; that the restraining
and elevating influence which they exert
are deemed injurious to the interests
of that community; that instead of
churches these "business men" of El Paso
prefer prize-fights and all that goes with
them â ignorance, brutality, drunkenness,
gambling and ruffianism and outlawry in
all possible forms. It means that "busi
ness men" of El Paso are indifferent to
the fact that they will be regarded as out
casts from American civilization, antagon
istic to religion and insolent to Congress,
and lacking in those distinguishing quali
ties of patriotism that mark loyal citizens
of the United States.
Of course, the self-styled "business
men" of El Paso will not readily
admit that they are placing them
selves in such a position. All that
concerns them is the fact that they
will not get a large amount of money
which they had expected from an influx
of spectators assembled to see the fight
between two notorious bruisers. In order
to pet this money (which they might have
lived without) they are ready to risk every
thing which most self-respecting persons
hold dear. Hence the grievous feature of
the case â that men and communities here
and there put money above all other con
siderations. But that happens to be ex
actly the policy of the burgiar and the
thiet.
The residents of new and border towns
should realize that the sooner and more
completely they bring themselves into
sympathy with the moving influences of
this country the more quickly will their
prosperity be assured. If the churches
in America represented at El Paso
do not instantly and vigorously come
to the support of their threatened off
spring in El Paso we greatly mistake
their intelligence and earnestness and
their appreciation of the fact that El Paso
has given abundant evidence of the need
of churches.
AN IMPOSING EVENT.
The brilliant snccess which attended the
efforts to mane last year's rose carnival at
Santa Rosa an attractive spectacle has led
to a far more ambitious undertaking for a
repetition of the event in April. It is re
markable and gratifying to learn that in
response to circulars addressed to those
who contributed to last year's festival to
double their subscription lor the next,
there has not been a single refusal, but on
the contrary many have ' voluntarily
pledged themselves for four times the
amount given last year. We say this is
remarkable, because such public spirit and
such an appreciation of the permanent
value of these enterprises is exceedingly
rare in California, outside some of the
cities in the southern end of the State.
The smaller cities of California- have a
tremendous advantage over San Francisco
on the score of co-operative effort. It is
no excuse for San Francisco to urge that
its comparatively great size renders such
a movement impracticable. Chicago, with
a population five times that of Ban Fran
cisco, has this co-operative sense devel
oped to a remarkable degree, and it has
been out of its wise and energetic exercise
that the greatness of the city has issued.
It is well to call attention to the fact
that community effort is developing rap
idly and hrmly in this part of the State.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
Napa is now leading with a gigantic en
terprise for utilizing the waste water of
Clear Lake for the generation of electricity
which will soon double the value of all
property coming under its influence.
This will include the whole of the Napa
Valley and possibly a part of Sonoma,
Livermore is steadily pushing its organi
zation for the community good. San Jose,
the center of a region which for so long re
garded irrigation as unnecessary, is put
ting an extensive irrigation scheme into
the field, is preparing to build an electric
railroad to the western mountains and is
completing preparations for a splendid
flower carnival.
Meanwhile all these advancements will
bring benefit to San Francisco by develop
ing the region tributary to it. It is there
fore the duty of San Francisco to give
them all possible encouragement and as
sistance. The Napa electric scheme, for
instance, should be placed before our com
mercial bodies and a just demand made
for their assistance. Likewise Santa Rosa
should have an agent in San Francisco
asking as a matter of simple right that
our people lend a hand. These commu
nities spend their money here and supply
our markets with their products. They
are an intimate part of us, and their in
terests are ours. They have a right to
seek our co-operation and it is our duty to
respond. ; f
CONCEENING IMMIGEATION.
One of the most thoughtful discussions
of the immigration question appears in
the current issue of Donahoe's Magazine.
Robert de C. Ward, secretary of the Immi
gration Restriction League, opens the
symposium with this able presentation of
the problem : "No demand for the further
restriction of immigration will ever have
the hearty BUDport of the majority of
Americans, native and foreign born, if
that demand is. based simply on the desire
to keep America for Americans, or if those
who make the demand are actuated by re
ligious or race prejudices, or by the selfish
motives arising from the wish to exclude
certain definite classes of foreigners be-
cause they compete in special trades with
our native workmen. On the other hand,
if a careful and impartial study of immi
gration and its economic, political and
social effects makes it plain that some of
our immigrants are lowering our high
standards of living; are exposing our
workmen to unjust and ruinous competi
tion ; are tending to degrade the American
race; are disinclined to assimilate with
our people â if, in short, it becomes neces
sary, in order to preserve the American
Republic and the high standard of Ameri
can citizenship, that something should be
done in the way of further restriction, then
the demand for thi3 restriction will have
the support of the country at large, and
will be met by the passage of more strin
gent laws by Congress."
The writer then takes the ground that
illiteracy and the tendency to form sep
arate and distinct communities of for
eigners, in which foreign languages and
customs are adhered to, are sufficient
reasons for exclusion. Hence he approves
the recently introduced McCall amend
ment to the immigration law of 1891, be
cause it requires that immigrants shall be
able to read and write the English or some
other language.
But Edward F. McSweeney, United
States Commissioner of Immigration at
the port of New York, inferentially ques
tions the adequacy of this measure. He
shows, in the first place, that the statistics
of immigration are misleading, in that
they do not take into account the fact that
a good many immigrants are merely re
turning to this country; in the second,
that as most of our illiterate immigrants
come from Italy, Poland and Austro-
Hangary it is an unwise evasion to impose
a restriction aimed at certain nationalities,
and that the proposed amendment does
not exclude those Canadians who make a
practice of working in the States during
the summer and returning to Canada for
the winter. He suggests that distribution
of immigrants by the Government is better
than restriction, in view of the fact that
this country can support many times its
present population and that it should be
maintained as the asylum for the op
pressed of all nations.
We beg to add that this matter' of "op
pression" has a relative significance.
What might be oppression to one is not to
another. Anarchists claim to be a product
of that condition, yet most certainly we do
not need anarchists in this country. After
all, Mr. Ward has expressed the true
American sentiment. If immigrants are
not assimilable we do not want them.
AN ORIGINAL LECTURER.
William E. Smythe, president of the Na
tional Colonial Society and an enereetic
mover for the irrigation of the arid West,
is delivering a series of lectures in Chicago,
New York and other Eastern cities that
have a distinct quality of novelty. His
object is to organize colonists for Califor
nia, and the peculiarity of his speeches is
that he is perfectly candid. This method
is so different from that of land speculators
and boomers, who have done so much to
iuiure the State by painting alluring pic
tures and producing disappointment, that
they have a distinctive value and will un
doubtedly be productive of the best results
ever secured in efforts to colonize the State.
One of his lectures entitled "The Truth
About California" is as merciless in its
criticism as it is just in its praise. After
noting the fact that the- name of California
is better known throughout the world than
that of any other American State, he an
alyzes the case and bases it on historical
rather than industrial data. "And yet,"
he truthfully adds, "after all that has been
said and written, California is mostly a
vague and misunderstood part of the
Union â a sort of- glittering and unsub
stantial reality of which we know less as
we hear more." He insists that California
is only for those who are willing to work
for a living, and that if they are so willing
they can secure the best results in Cali
fornia.
Treating California in its broadest aspect,
he says: "'Just as New York is the focal
point on the Eastern coast, drawing to
itself the largest measure of business and
trade and population from the East, so
San Francisco is the focal and strategic
point of the great West. Just as the val
leys directly tributary to New York enjoy
the largest and most even prosperity, so
must the territory immediately tributary
to San Francisco do the same. Just as
New York has become the center of trade
and commerce, literature and art on the
Eastern slope, and as Chicago has done
the same in the middle West, so has San
Francisco done on the Pacific Coast. It is
less than fifty years since California telt
the first impulse of Americanization, but
already, and because of these immutable
laws, California is the largest State and
San Francisco the greatest City west of
the Rocky Mountains. Before I went to
California I somehow had the impression
that it was pretty well settled up, but such
is not the case, it is merely in its infancy,
and I believe it could sustain 20,000,000
people, at least, as readily as Illinois sus
tains its present population."
This is the truest possible presentation
of the case, and it must come exactly as
the wonderful wisdom of Brigham Young
produced the transformation of the val
leys of Salt Lake into wealth-producing
gardens â by intelligent and diversified
farming on a small scale, by intense meth
ods and with the aid of irrigation; and
the colony plan is. the very best for the pur
pose.
THE NICABAGUA EEPOET.
President Cleveland has at last sent to
the House, apparently without remark,
the report of the board of engineers ap
pointed to investigate the feasibility of the
Nicaragua canal. The engineers are evi
dently opposed to the project, and a pecu
liar feature of their report seems to be a
special plea against the canal. The tele
graphed condensation sent to this coast
does not indicate that the board paid any
attention to the. political features of the
matter, though that might not have been
a part of its duty.
The two main points of the report are
that the tremendous rainfall along parts of
the route will seriously interfere with both
construction and maintenance, and that
the cost instead of being $66,466,880, as es
timated by the canal company, will really
be $133,472,893. With regard to this and
other matters connected with the subject
it should be borne in mind that while the
Government engineers gave only two
months to a study of the situation the
canal company has given years. It is
curious to note that the board triinks an
expenditure of $350,000 and a two years'
study necessary for securing complete
data concerning a canal project.
On its face the report seems to have no
value whatever. It could hardly be ex
pected to have under the circumstances,
for it would be unreasonable to sftppose
that strangers in two montns could mas
ter novel conditions which have been thor
oughly studied by persons long on the
ground.
It will now be interesting to note what
position will be taken on this inadequate
report by those who are insisting on a
railroad funding bill. As they have as
sumed that in the settlement of the rail
road debt the financial aspect of the
matter is the only thing to be considered,
and that it is the duty of the Government
to settle on any terms dictated by the rail
roads, it may be assumed, especially as the
Nicaragua canal would weaken the power
of the railway monopoly, that they will
seize upon the question of cost as being
sufficient to throttle the enterprise.
The enemies of popular rights in the
matter of transportation would doubtless
be pleased to see England furnish the
money for the construction of the canal,
and exercise over it the power by which
she governs the Suez canal. The situation
is sufficiently grave to call forth the
strongest efforts of true Americans, and
will serve as a test of loyalty to the welfare
of our country.

work in the California mines.
Thomas fi. Barrett, a wealthy member of the
Chicago Board of Trade, is at the Palace, ac
accompanied by his wife and several friends.
They have been seeing Chinatown and tne

Behuttler Wagon Manufacturing Company, and
in this capacity gained extensive information
in regard to different woods. It is said no one
in America is better informed. His report,
published officially of the woods in connection
With the Illinois exhibit, has been highly com

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
C. M. Root, superintendent of the Green
wood Gold Mining Company af Greenwood, El
Dorado County, is at the Grarid. He says there
is much activity in developing low-grade gold
properties in that part of the State. Most of
the property where he is, he states, however,
are not yet mines properly speaking.
The locations are on and near to the mother
lode. In some instances large bodies of in
ferior ore had been worked. Four leading
copanies are at work .
Three miles away is the noted Taylor mine,
of which E. W. Chapman of this city is man
ager and a large owner. Mr. Root credits this
property with producing from $25,000 to
Â¥35,000 each month. It has a forty-stamp mill
and employs 120 men.
"There are no mills yet where I am," said
Mr. Root, "but a St. Louis company will soon

"The country about Greenwood never looked
better than at present. I was born and raised
in Shasta County, and am very familiar with
mining, tut I never saw a more promising
county than that part of El Dorado.
"There are big bodies of ore, and it runs
higher than similar-sized bodies do in most
sections. I* requires sixteen miles of staging
off the railroad from Auburn to get to Green
wood, but it is a camp worth going to, never
theless. I look for a lot of big mines to be
developed there."
EXILE.
When day's long course of life is done,
Before the rest of night,
I stand to watch the setting sun
Drop slowly out of sight.
Then In the clouds 1 love to trace
The forms of hill and plain.
And think I see my native place,
My distant home again.
I love the wind that blows from thence
With news 1 long to hear;
I love the wind that blows from Hence,
My greeting- oft to bear.
Across the silent deep blue skies
Seek out my home, O breeze !
Beyond the seven hills it lies,
Beyond the seven seas.
How blue those heaving seas and deep,
How high tbose parting hills.
The sunbeams on their green crests sleep,
Their vales the shadow tills.
O land of youth, O vanished land,
I seek a distant shore,
And can I ever hope to stand
Upon thy mountains more ?
Or in that oountry where I go,
My weary wanderings past,
Shall I look robnd about, and knot*
My native home at last ?

The present war scare should teach the peo

foreign nations; we import too many goods of
foreign manufacture; In short, we spend too
much abroad and too little at home. This
should be so changed that the end of each fis
cal year should see a large trade balance in
favor of this country. An effort should also be
made to depend less and less each year upon
the investment of foreign capital and thus
keep dividends and interest at home. Let this
be done aod the outflow of gold will cease and
an era of prosperity will be ushered in.

A WAIST WITH VEST AND REVERS.
Trim round or slightly pointed waists well
fitted with long rever's ana plastron or vest
effects are very popular for costumes of woolen
fabrics. Contrasting fabrics and colors may
be used for plastron and revers, making it
possible to give very stylish combinations.
The back is fitted with the usual seams in
the back, formed by back, side-body ana under
arm forms. There is but one dart either side
of the front . of which the lining fastens in tne
center, the vest hooking under the left revers.
A tweed mixture of brown and white had
a plastron of wnite cloth with a graceiul de-
sign outlined in green spangles and brown
beads. (Such a vest can be easily made at
home, having the design stamped.) The revers
and collar were of brown velvet.
A cheviot in a mixture of green shades of the
sage tone had velvet revers of green with plas
tron of white satin crossed with guipure.
A very dressy waist of Dresden silk had the
revers, collar and plastron of white satin with
creamy guipure laid ilat over it.
A waist of prune-colored velvet (worn with
a crepon skirt of the same color) had revers
and collar edged with chinchilla fur. The
plastron was of white satin elaborated in a
design with steel beads and spangles. A brown
cheviot was made with revers of the goods,
bound with light brown leather, of which the
plastron also was made. A narrow belt of the
same leather was vorn with this exceedingly
trim and stylish suit.
A dark green cloth had revers and collar of
the goods bound with gold braid. The plas
tron of fawn-colored cloth was heavily braided
with Rold, and three tiny gilt buttons were set
on either side of the waist where the revers

Welland Canalâ O. 8., City. The Welland
canal of Canada leaves Lake Ontario at Port
Dalhousie, twelve miles westward of the
mouth of the Niagara, and at Port Colborne,
seventeen miles westward of the river. It enters
Lake Erie, surmounting the falls nnd rapids of
Niagara. Its length, apart from branches to Port
Maitland and Chippewa, is 27 miles and 1099
feet. The building of the canal was first
talked of in 1816, and in 1824 the work was
commenced by W. H. Merrltt and others, who
formed a stock company. The original scheme
was abandoned in 1825, and another was de
vised by the company, that had a limited
capital, and waa aided by the Imperial and
Provincial governments. In 1839 the Cana
dian Parliament authorized the purchase of
all the private stock of the company, but this
was not done until- 1841, and then the canal
was plated under the control of a board of
works of Canada, and its enlargement was de
cided upon. The wooden locks were replaced
by Btone ones. Wa:er was turneu into the
canal in 1829, and two schooners ascended it
to the River Welland.

LIFE OF McKINLEV.
AN advanced copy of Robert P.
Porter's "Life of William MeKin
ley" has been received for review
from the publishers, N. G. Hamil
ton Company, Cleveland, Ohio.
It is a voluminous work of 440 pages, finely
printed on heavy paper and handsomely
illustrated.
Aside from the powerful political interest
attached to MeKinley, the publishers
aver in a prefatory note, "his life has
been one so typical of all that is best in
the self-made American, his career one
that affords such stimulus and inspiration
to the youthful brain and sinew of our
country, that it is with genuine satisfac
tion we publish the stainless record of the
citizen, soldier and statesman."
The biographer, Mr. Porter, is not a
stranger to the people of the Nation.
'When we asked Mr. Porter to under
take this work," say the publishers, "it
was with the knowledge of his peculiar
litnessâ as writer, economist and personal
friend of McKinley- for the task. For
years an investigator of industrial topics,
as member of the Tariff Commission,
Superintendent of the Eleventh Census
and active journalist, Mr. Porter has had
unusual opportunities to observe the prog
ress of the Nation under a generation of
protection policy, and he, perhaps, more
than any other, save McKinley himself,
has given the people an intelligent under
standing of its working."
In his introductory remarks, Mr. Porter
thus refers to McKinley: "Essentially a
man of the people, his rise from a lad, born
in an Ohio village, to the position of one
of the foremost statesmen of the times, is
full of interest to the American public,
fc? t ill in the prime of a vigorous and de
veloping manhood, the subject of this
sketch presents alike to young and old the
possibilities of our free institutions, when
supplemented by patriotism, integrity,
courage, perseverance and unbounded
faith in the economic policies which best
promote the welfare of our common coun
try. The story is that of a serious and
earnest life â a life of devotion to duty, to
principle and to the public service. Aided
by nothing, save an honorable parentage,
a good constitution, a quick perception, a
courteous bearing, a brave heart and a
high sense of honor, this youth in teens
*i*s mustered into the army, and began
tfie conflict of life on the Nation's battle
fields â a conflict continued in the halls of
National legislation, and closely inter
woven with the last twenty-five years of
National progress."
It has been the biographer's purpose to
make' the volume under consideration the
most complete life of McKinley yet pub
lished. The work contains incidents
of the boyhood life of the subject
at Niles and Poland. Immediately fol
lowing the war McKinley laid aside
the accouterments of the soldier and
entered upon the study of the law, and
â was graduated from the Albany (N. V.)
Law School. "One year after the close of
the war he was a briefless young lawyer
in the little town ol Canton, Ohio, study- j
ing early and late, and endeavoring to eke !
out a somewhat scanty living by the aid of
such retainers and fees as would come to
one experienced in civil war but inex
perienced in the practice of the legal pro
fession." The biographer endeavors to
give the real every-day life of the young
lawyer and to picture the surroundings
under which his fertile mind was devel
oped and his sterling character built
up. The people of Canton recognized in
him a man with a future, and twenty-five
years ago they elected him Prosecuting
Attorney of Btark County. Mr. Porter
opines that McKinley would have made a
profound jurist had he not devoted the
best of his life to statecraft, for when he
accepted the nomination to Congress his
Mr. Kckinlcy in 1865.
law practice, in a measure, had to be given
up.
McKinley is compared to Garfield with
reference to a thorough preparation by
reading and study for a broad public
< areer. Each of these possessed elements
of strength, by reason of his conscientious
study of political subjects. McKinley was
first elected to Congress in 1576 and re
mained aVeraber of tne House of Repre
sentatives for fourteen years, his closing
year being signalized by the passage of the
tariff measure which bears his name. The
volume treats very extensively of the
policy of protection as represented in the
MeKinley law and discusses at length the
crushing Republican defeat of 1892 and the
tidal wave that engulfed Democracy two
years later.
Extended references are made to two
pj.iscides in McKlnley's career that have
!>een discussed of late in the public press.
These are his fidelity to John Sherman at
the Republican National Convention of
June, 1888, and to General Benjamin Har
rison at Minneapolis in 1892. In thÂ« first
instance be was under instructions of his
State convention to vote for Sherman as
Ohio's Presidential candidate; in the sec
ond he considered himself bound to the
cause of Harrison. In each case fidelity to
his trust and to his friends caused him to
put aside the Presidency.
"Twice," declares the biographer, "had
MeKinley put from him a nomination
which would have been purchased at the
expense of broken pledges."
MeKinley is of Scotch-Irish descent.
James MeKinley, an emigrant from the
north of Ireland, who at the age of 12
years, crossed the Atlantic with his rela
tives in a small sailing vessel at the begin
ning of the last century, was the father of
David MeKinley, the great-grandfather of
William MeKinley. David MeKinley, as
shown by records in the Pension Bnreau,
re-enlisted seven times in the War of the
Revolution; hence MeKinley comes from
good fighting stock. As to his parentage
we quote the biographer:
Nilee is a small Ohio city, and at the time
of the birth of William, January 29, 1843, his
father, William McKinley Sr., was managing
an iron furnace there. The McKinleys in
herited not only fighting qualities Jmt the
skill of iron manufacturing from their revolu
tionary ancestors. The father took naturally
to this occupation and followed it until 1876,
when he retired. This was his business in the
early part of the century at New Lisbon. In
McKINLEY'S RESIDENCE AT CANTON, OHIO.
1829 he established an iron foundry at Fair
field, Columbians County, Ohio. For twenty
years William McKinley Sr. was interested in
iron furnaces at Xew Wilmington, Ohio. From
Niles he moved to Poland because of the edu
cational advantages of Poland Academy.
Shortly after he was associated with 8. O.
Edison, uncle of Thomas Edison, to construct
iron furnaces at Black River, now Lorain. In
1869 he moved to Canton with his family, in
tending to retire, but he enjoyed and managed
Iron interests at Caseville, near Saginaw,
Mich., up to 1870, when he retired. He kept
track of his business with exactness up to
three weeks of his death, which took place
November 24, 1892.
William McKinley Sr. was a man of char
acter and of the highest integrity. His habits
were frugal and regular; he was a hard and
constant worker. While at times it was a
struggle to provide â for such a large family
(nine children) he conscientiously performed
what he believed waÂ« his duty and made
every possible sacrifice to educate and make
useful men and women of his children. In
all this he was more than seconded by his
noble wife, McKinley's mother, whose maiden
name was Xancy Campbell Allison. Mrs. Mc-
Kinley was one of those rare women who are
destined to shine in all sorts of good and use-
Mr. McKinley in 1876.
ful work, whether In pioneer lift or amid the
comforts of our modern homes. McKinley
owes much to this good mother. All the chil
dren were instilled with sound Christian ideas
of life and with a patriotism and love for their
country which made no sacrifice for it too
much. Moreover, the mother wag an intel
lectual force and encouraged boys and girls
alike In their studies, and was ever ready to
surrender her own personal comfort that they
might equip themselves as thoroughly as pos
sible for the battle of life.
Here we have a strong force In the develop
ment of the young man's character. Many of
the wholesome traits, which in after years en
deared the soldier and statesman to comrades
and fellow-countrymen may be traced to the
early teachings of the mother, who lives
to feel proud and happy over her son's achieve
ments. That her son should have won fame
is undoubtedly a source of gratification and
pride to the mother; but her real happiness
comes from the fact that he is a man of honor
and integrity. To this plain, sweet, simple
pioneer mother, who has experienced much of
the hardships and struggles of early Western
life, with a large family and limited means,
the fact that her son William is a man of high
principles and patriotic instincts and has
never ceased to love and cherish her Is a
greater comfort than the fact that he may
some day occupy the White House.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
The Allisons originally came from Eng
land. Abner Allison, in 1798, married
Ann Campbell, who came of a Scotch-Ger
man family, and these were the parents of
the mother of MeKinley.
Referring to the regiment in which Me-
Kinley enlisted and to his military record
we have this from the volume:
The Twenty-thira Regiment was officered by
three men whose alter prominence made this
command one of the most noted in the war.
The first colonel was W. S. Rosecrans, after
ward General Rosecrans, a captain whose re
nown is now worldwide, and whose services
later in the War of the Rebellion were import
ant in its suppression. The first lieutenant
colonel was Stanley Matthews, afterward Sen
ator from Ohio and a Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States. The first major
was Rutherford B. Hayes, afterward a general
of great ability, thrice Governor of Ohio and
President of the United States. * * *
The official records indicate that McKinley's
military life and advancement were most
creditable. They show that William McKin
ley Jr. enlisted as a private in Company Eof
the Twenty-third O. V. 1., June 11, 1861 ; that
he was promoted to commissary sergeant April
15,1802; that he was promoted to second
lieutenant of Company D.September 23, 1862;
that he was promoted to first lieutenant of
Company E, February 7,1803; that he was
promoted .to captain of Company G.July 25,
1804; that he was detailed as acting assistant
adjutant-general of the First Division, First
Army Corps, on the staff of General Carroll ;
that he was brevetted major March 13, 1865;
and that he was mustered out of service July
26, 1865. â¢ â¢ â¢
McKinley is a Knight Templar, a Knight of
Pythias and also a Greek Fraternity man. His
entrance into Masonry was an incident of the
war and rather unique. McKinley was going
through a hospital with one of the regimental
surgeons. Ke noticed that the surgeon and
some of the Confederate wounded were very
friendly to each other, and in several instances
the surgeon gave money to the prisoners.
There was an unmistakable bond of sympathy
between them. Young McKinley asked the sur
geon if he knew these prisoners. The surgeon
told him they were brother Masons. Young
McKinley was so much Impressed by the
friendly feeling existing between Confederate
and Union Masons that he expressed the de
sire to join the Masons. He was made a>l*son
in Hiram Lodge, Winchester, Va., May 1, 1865,
receiving his degree at the hands of a Confed
erate master of the lodge.
McKiniey was married to Miss Ida Sax
ton, daughter of John Saxton, an Ohio
journalist of note, on January 25, 1871.
Two children were born to them, both
girls, but they died early in life. For years
Mrs. McKinley has been an invalid. In her
gentle heroism, she never allows her
health to interfere with her husband's
career.
In regard to Governor McKinley's domestic
life, perhaps the most pathetic thing to De said
is that there has been so little of it. On Janu
uary 25, 1896, Governor McKinley and his wife
celebrated their silver wedding in the same
modest house in Canton in which a quarter of
a century before they began life together.
The part played by McKinley in the
Chicago convention of 1884, whicn nomi
nated James G. Blame for President, is
described in a rather effective manner.
McKinley was pledged to the Plumed
Knight. Mr. Porter thus tells the story:
McKinley bore himself modestly at Chicago,
but his great quality of leadership came to the
front by force of circumstances. He only
spoke two or three times from the floor of the
convention, but every time ne arose he at
tracted attention, and the influence he exerted
was most remarkable. At the critical time
during the convention his was the voice that
rallied the Blame forces. Three ballots had
been taken. Blame gained on each ballot.
The final and desperate effort was made by the
other candidates under the leadership of the
dashing Foraker in Sherman's behalf for an
adjournment. Curtis, the great editor of
Harpers' Weekly, and Theodore Roosevelt were
on chairs frantically yelling. Stewart of
Pennsylvania and Carr of California, in their
zeal for Blame, were trying to outdo Curtis
and Roosevelt in voice. The massive and
phlegmatic Dutcher of New York, one of
Arthur's generals, was thundering away in
the effort to catch the ear and eye of the chair
man of the convention, General Henderson of
Missouri. There was pandemonium and there
threatened to be a panic.
In the midst of the storm McKinley arose.
Although only of medium stature his torm
seemed to tower above those around him. His
face was pale and looked like a piece of marble
s;atuary, except that his eyes fairly blazed.
Before he had uttered two words his voice
could be heard. He waved his hand and the
tumult ceased. No mistake about itâ he was
â  the master-sDirit of that convention. Calm
and like granite he stood. His short speech
was carried in clarion tones all over the Im
mense hall. As a friend of Blame, he said, he
recognised and respected the rights of friends
of other candidates to secure an adjournment
and then he said: "Let the motion be put and
let everybody favorable to. the nomination of
Blame vote against it."
That settled it. Under McKinley's leader
ship, assumed Spontaneously and boldly, the
Blame men accepted the challenge, the motion
for an adjournment-was voted down and the
victory wp.s won. It was not defeat that Me-
Kinley turned asideâ the situation was not so
serious as thatâ but in a crisis where the
Blame men were getting demoralized and the
convention was turning itself into a mob, Mc-
Kinley, leaping to the front, by one command
marshaled the Blame men into line and
pressed them forward to their already sighted
victory.
Speaking of the Coneressional experi
ence of the Ohio man, the biographer
proceeds:
MeKinley is an adroit debater. The Con
gressional Record does not show that he was
ever worsted in a passage of arms with the
most brilliant of his colleagues. In the earlier
years in the House of Representatives he was
cautious, and only undertook debate on ques
tions with which he was thoroughly familiar.
Unlike most new members, MeKinley did not
rush madly into the wordy arena.
He listened, weighed well the strength of
his antagonists and said little until his time
and opportunity came. For this reason, when
MeKinley arose to speak, he invariably com
manded the attention of the House. He was
generally regarded as one of the members who
.had something to say, who said it well, and
when he had said it stopped. It was also dis
covered that MeKinley was quick in debate,
and that, though his speech upon such occa
sions might be termed the essence of courtesy,
it usually made the gentleman who had inter
rupted wish he had let MeKinley alone.
A remarkable epispde in his Congres
sional career was tne following:
Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania was
Speaker when McKinley entered Congress and
they became warm friends. There was one
memorable scene in the Fiftieth Congress in
which both figured. It occurred on May 18,
18S8. the day on which the general debate
closed on the Mills bill. Randall opposed this
measure and incurred the displeasure of the
rampant iree-trade element, headed by Mills
of Texas. He took the floor to speak against
the bill. In feeble healtn, his voice at times
almost inaudible, the great leader labored
under serious disadvantages In this, his first
fight for protection. Before he was through
his time expired amid cries of "Go on!"
Mr. Randall asked for an extension, but Mills,
with a discourtesy almost incredible, walked
to the front and said, "I object I" The cry was
repeated by nearly fifty Democratic members.
It was a sad sight to witness this great
Democratic leader thus silenced upon a mo
mentous question by his own party friends.
There was an exciting scene. Members and
spectators, for the galleries were crowded,
joined in making the tumult. Amid it all the
chairman announced that McKinley of Ohio
had the floor. The latter was to close the de
bate on the Republican side. His desk was
piled with memoranda and statistics.
"Mr. Speaker," he cried, and his voice stilled
the din about him. "I yield to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania out of my time all that he
may need in which to finish his speech on this
bill."
C beer after cheer arose from the House and
galleries, and by the courtesy of the Republi
can leader the once leader of the Democracy
was enabled to finish his speech in a body over
which he had thrice presided as Speaker.
An estimate of McKinley as a public
speaker is thus given:
As a public speaker McKlnley stands in the
frout rank. Even those who say that he can
make only one speech must admit that he can
make that one well. But such a criticism is
not fairly taken. The truth is that few men in
political life have delivered speeches upon
such a variety of subjects as has McKin
ley. â¢ â¢ â¢
In his specialty, the tariff, he stands the un
disputed master. His attractiveness in the
presentation of this question is only equaled
by the consistency and tenacity of his views
thereon. * * *
Wherein is McKinley's strength as a speaker
upon the tariff? The answer seems to be:
First, his evident sincerity, and, secondly, his
simplicity in the presentation of hisargument.
There is very little of the ornate in his style,
but still it is graceful. It is eminently epi
grammatic, yet not mosaic, for the sentences
are not only well rounded but are well con
nected and are forcefully arranged, so that the
climax stands upon a broad and firm founda
tion of argument and fact.
Not only has he a splendid voice, but his
pronunciation is charming.
McKinley's views on public questions,
his opinions of National celebrities of tbe
past. his religious sentiments, are pre
sented in chapters devoted to those par
ticular topics. There are chapters on
reciprocity, finance, public education,
labor issues and the McKinley tariff law,
as well as a resume of the history of Mc-
Kinley's gubernatorial administration,
which is characterized as "wise and pru
dential and without red tape."
In his concluding chapter the biographer
declares in plain terms what may be read
between the lines of the book from the
very beginning:
The surest road to Republican success in the
coming Presidential election is to put the
tariff to the front. We should begin a fresh
campaign in behalf of the wage-earners of
America, a campaign which should be carried
on without cessation until the sinister shadow
of free trade is lifted from every American
home and American industrial independence
is assured forever. â¢ â¢ *
McKinley is a type of American citizenship
and American manhood of which we may well
be proud, and whether his public life termi
nates now', or he achieves still further honors,
the name of McKinley will never be erased
from the memoriea of a vast majority of his
party followers, who are rightly inspired by
the hope that he may some day be President of
the United Btates.
THE AIMS OF LITERARY STUDY.
This little book is the ninth of the Mac
millan Miniature series, and is a learned
dissertation on the subject under consid
eration. The author, Hiram Corson,
LL.D., takes for his keynote the doctrine
of the trinal unity of man as enunciated
by Robert Browning in "A Death in the
Desert." He holdÃ that all literary study
should aim to develop to the highest de
gree tkat immortal part of a man which
will survive the grave. Dr. Corson defines
literature as the expression in letters of
the spiritual co-operating with the intel
lectual man, the former being the pri
mary, dominant coefficient. He says: "A
production of the pure intellect does not
belong to the domain of literature proper.
We can know a true poem only so far as
we can reproduce it sj'mpatheticallv
within ourselves. In these days the

most difficult problem to be solved
is how to secure a better balancing of
the intellectual and the spiritual man.
When this problem shall have been suc
cessfully solved there will be a civilization
such as the world has never yet known.
The leading aim in the teaching ot Eng
lish should be: First, to enlarge the stu
dent's vocabulary; second, to cultivate a
nice sense of the force of words, and third,,
to speak and write good, live . English.
These three things can be secured only
through an extensive and sympathetic
reading of good authors."
Such an author as "Washington Irving
Professor Corson considers excellent for
youn? students, for in Irying's works it
would be hard to rind a Latin word used
where its Saxon equivalent would be pre
ferable, or vice versa. Furthermore, the
careful student could hardly help being
wholesomely influenced by the genial per
sonality of the author. For advanced stu
dents no more educating author could be
selected than De Quincey.
Dr. Corson considers examinations the
bane of literary study, for the reason- that
they largely determine the character of
this study in the school. Literary knowl
edge and literary culture are quite distinct
things. The author considers it fortunate
that much of the finest genius of our day
is employing prose liction as its most effi
cient instrument and form. Students can
turn in their leisure hours to great novels
which are instinct with the poetic, are in
formed with intellect, heart and con
science, and often grapple with the most
serious questions of life and u"es r .iny.
"In studying a poem with a class of
students,"* Professor Corson says, "one
very important aim of the teacher should
be to keep the minds of the ciass up as
near as possible to the height of the
argument." The best response to the es
sential life of a poem is to be secured by
the fullest interpretative vocal rendering
of it. The reading voice demands at least
as much cultivation as the singing voice.
The author finds it a cause of much regret
that so little attention, comparatively, is
paid to the cultivation of the reading
voice in our schools and colleges. [New

"HUNTING IN MANY IANDS."
This is the title of the latest volume
issued by that famous organization of
sportsmen known a3 the Boona and
Crockett Club. Sixteen members of the
club contribute articles based on their
various experiences in quest of big
game. The editors are Theodore Roose
velt and George Bird Grinnell, and the
work is published by the New York Forest
and Stream Company. The editors declare
that the Boone and Crockett Club was
largely interested in securing the passage by
Congress of an act to protect the Yellow
stone National Park, and to punish crimes
and offenses within its borders, "though
it may be questioned whether even their
efforts would have had any result had not
the public interest been aroused, and the
Congressional conscience pricKed by the
wholesale slaughter of buffalo which took
place in the park in March, 1894."
It is deemed necessary, that public senti
ment should be aroused on the general
question of forest preservation, and espe
cially in the matter of securing legislation
which will adequately protect the game

and the forests of the various forest reser
vations already established. A matter of
peculiar interest is embodied in the follow
ing excerpt from the introduction:
A really remarkable phenomenon in Ameri
can animal life is the attitude now assumed
toward mankind by the bears, both jrrizzly'and
black, in the Yellowstone National Park. The
preservation of the game in the park has
unexpectedly resulted in turning a great
many of the bears into scavengers for the
hotels' within the park limits. Their tame
ness and familiarity are astonishing; they act
much more like hogs than beasts of prey.
Naturalists now have a chance of studying
their* character from an entirely new stand
point and under entirely new conditions. It
would be well worth the while of any student
of nature to devote an entire season in tbe
park simply to study of bear life. Never be
fore has such an opportunity been afforded.
One bear has made a practice of going into
the kitchen of the Geyser Hotel, wnere he is
fed on pies. If given a chance, the bears will
eat the pigs that are kept in pens near the
hotels; out they ha\e not shown anySendency
to molest the horses, or to interfere in any way
with the human beings around the hotels.
These incidents and the confidence which
the elk, deer and other animals in the park,
have come to feel in man are interesting, for
they show how readily these creatures may be
taught to look upon human beings as friends.
The different papers have nothing of
brilliancy about them, from a literary
point of view; they simply relate, in plain,
everyday language, the accounts of adven
tures had by the authors in quest of big
game. â . â¢ . â  . -^.i-:---':' â  . .
OPING DICK.
A series of stories dealing with the possi
ble adventures of a humorous highwayman
in the days of Charles II of England forms
the contents of a small volume bearing the
title of "Galloping Dick." The tales are
all of a fantastic character and are written
in a style just quaint enough, to suggest
the mode of speech common in England in
those days. There are six tales in all, but
have no connection with one another fur
ther than that they are told by the same
person, Richard Ryder, otherwise Gallop
ing Dick, and relate some of his fantastic
fortunes in pursuing his calling as a gen
tleman of the road. The stories were
originally published in the New Review
and the Chapbook and are already. known
to a wide circle of readers. Even
to those who know them, however, the
new volume will be interesting, as all the
tales are well worth reading twice, taking
rank in fact among the best short stories of
the day. ["Galloping Dick," by H. B.

A HISTORY IN RHYME.
"America Liberata" is the title of a poem
by Robert H. Vickers, who is already
known as the author of a History of Bo
hemia. The new work has just been
issued by Charles H. Kerr & Co. of
Chicago. The history of the revolutions
which have resulted in the independence
of States which ad formed part of the
old Spanish dominion is told in 136 eight
line stanzas of labored verse, running
thiough seventy-four pages. The volume
is supplied with copious foot notes. Trib
utes 'are paid to Simon Bolivar, San Mar
tin and other liberators and patriots of
Spanish-American countries. To Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Chile, re
spectively, many pages are devoted, and
the Spanish names often play the mischief
with the meter. .

an improvement on the previous issues of
this useful publication. It contains well
arranged information and statistics of the
city of Brooklyn and Long Island that
will prove of interest to those who wish to
know about this section of the Union.
The stage rights of "Macaire," the play
by Stevenson and Henley, a review of
which appeared in The Call a few weeks
since, ha 3 been purchased by Richard
Mansfield, who will produce the play in
America, while it is expected that Beer
bohni Tree will introduce it in England.
Francis Bellamy, who for nearly six
years was one "of the editors of the
Youth's Companion, has been added to
the editorial staff of the Ladies' Home
Journal as one of Mr. Bok's principal as
sociates. The new editor is a cousin of
Mr. Edward Bellamy, author of "Looking
Backward."
Mary Anderson de Navarro's long-ex
pected work, "A Few Memories," will ap
pear during the month of March. Harper
& Brothers are the publishers. In April
.the same house will issue a volume en
titled "Personal Recollections of Joan of
Arc," and the second volume of Curtis'
"Constitutional History."
Henry Houssaye writes in the annual of
the Societe dcs Amis desLivres: "Aldus
is taking the place of Virgil, Trabouillet of
Moliere, Pierre Brunei of Montesquieu."
He means that book lovers, considering
books as art objects, not as instruments of
labor, think of their illustrators, editors
and publishers, and not of ttieir authors.
M. Georges Ohnet is engaged on a new
novel. The title he haÃ chosen is "Le Fil3
Adoptil." Al. Jules Lemaitre, whose re
ception at the French Academy was the
great literary event of January, awoke to
find himself famous in consequence of an
article in which he "executed" M. Ohnet,
as few authors have been executed oefore
or since.
The new edition of Poe has finally been
completed by the issue of the tenth volume.
It is now two years since the actual work
of this edition was begun, and this time
has been one of unceasing: labor on the
part of Mr. Stedman and Mr. Woodberry,
the editors, and Messrs. Stone & Kini
ball, the publishers, to make this edition
the absolutely linal and definitive one.
In ''The Lounger's" column of the
Critic of February 1 appears this brief,
pointed note: Mrs. Madeleine Yale
Wynne, the author of "The Little Room
and Other Stories," is the daughter of the
inventor of the Yale lock. As a Yale lock
is always accompanied by a Yale key L
wish that Mrs. Wynne would use one to
unlock the mystery of "The Little Room."
To the Photographic Times (New York)
for February Professor Charles F. Ilines
contributes an excellent article on ''Elect
rical Discharges Investigated by Means of
Stereoscopic Photography," with a re
markably interesting photograph. The
Hon. A. A. Adee, Assistant Secretary of
State, who is a distinguished microscopist,
contributes an illustrated article entitled
"A Water Beetle."
The notable features of Outing for
February include "The Llewellin Setter,"
"Sweet Marjory," "Paddling in Hon
duras," "Shooting at Swatow, China,"
"Modern Snipe," "The Wizard of the
Cascade," "Cycling in Mid-Atlantic,"
"Cruising in the Gull" and "About t:ie
Balearics." The editorial and record de
partments are valuable, and the number
is beautifully illustrated.
The American Academy of Political and
Social Science, Philadelphia, has just pub
lished three volumes that are of especial
interest at the present time. They are:
"The Nicaragua Canal and the Monroe
Doctrine," by L. M. Keasby, paper, 25
cents; "The Advantages of the Nicaragua
Route," by J. W. Miller, paper, 15 cents,
and "The Nicaragua Canal and the Eco
nomic Development of the United States."
by E. R. Johnson.
In the February number of the Progrpsi
of the World, the notable features are the
accounts of some recent marvelous dis
coveries, such as the device of. Dr. A.
Graham Bell, by which he transmits
sounds and ordinary conversation along a
sunbeam, in the same way that we now
use a telephone wire; also the new light,
accidentally produced by Professor Roent
gen, that "penetrates solicl substances, and
can photograph the skeleton of a living
man.
The Roycroft Publishing-house, East
Aurora, New York, announces for imme
diate delivery an exquisite edition of "The
Song of Songs; Which is Solomon's,"
being a reprint of the text together with a
study by Elbert Hubbard, wherein a most
peculiar and pleasant effect is wrought by
casting the song into dramatic form. The
study is sincere, but not serious, and has
been declared by several learned persons,
to whom the proofsheets have been sub
mitted, to be a work of art. Hand-printed
on excellent paper, and bound in antique
boards, ?2.
The new biography of Lady Blessington,
which Messrs. Downey of London, Eng.,
have announced, will be published on.
February 10, ."The Most Gorgeous Lady
Blessington," as the memoir is called, will
appear in this country on the same day.
J. Fitzgerald Molloy, who is the
biographer, has, in preparing the present
volume, had at his disposal letters ad
dressed to Lady Blessington by such
celebrities as Marryat, Dickens, Tom
Moore, Lytton, Disraeli and Gait, the Scot
tish novelist. Much of this correspondence
will see the light for the first time.
In the February Ist issue of the Chap-
Book is an interesting announcement.
Beginning with the next issue the price of
the magazine is to be raised from 6 to 10
cents. This is the first sign of a reaction
against the cheapening of magazines,
which has gone on at such a furious rate
during the last year or two. Many people
have questioned whether it makes any
essential difference to the purchaser
whether he pays 5, 10 or 15 cents for his
magazine, provided only he gets some
thing he really wants. And he saspecta
that there is a limit to the possible cheap
ening in the manufacture of a magazine.

THE THEATRES
TO-MORROW evening the great
Paderewski will be with us. Al
ready we are preparing to bow
down and do him homage, and
for the next nine days we shall
vie with one another in inventing extrava
gances capable of expressing his golden
glory. "Paddy's" will be a name to con
jure with. There is scarcely one of us
with soul so dead as to own that the
glamour of the pianist's fame and an over
whelming curiosity to see his chrysanthe
mum-head in all its glory are the real cause
of our buying those costly tickets for the
recital, and absolutely no one in this com
munity will be base and ignorant enou.h
to deny the Polish pianist's marvelous
genius.
How many of us, however, are going to
be capable of really appreciating the fine
distinctions that separate Faderewski's
playing from that of other great pianists
whom we should not flock to hear if they
came to us with only a mild amount of
heralding? Let Paderewski play behind
one screen and Rosenthal or d' Albert be
hind another, and only musicians or peo
ple of highly musical temperament could
distinguish sufficiently between the hid
den performers to point triumphantly to
Paderewski's lair and cry, regardless of
grammar, "That'9him!"
There is a great deal in a name, more
even than in a picturesque appearance.
A couple of months ago we had with us a
violinist whose rlaying was a pleasure to
hear. His name was Higgins, and he faded
away without arousing a rip^ple of interest.
What could the man expect? He surely
did not think that the Nob Hiil tribes v.-ere
going to stir up interest in him by exclaim
ing enthusiastically at afternoon teas:
"We went to hear Higgins play yesterday;
he was just lovely I" No one witn bo
every-day a name as Higgins could possi
bly be lovely in a matinee girl's sense.
The name precludes such a possibility. If
Higgins had appeared on the programme
as Higginini or Higginski the matinee
girl might have raved over his shaegy
ebon locks, his pale, ethereal face and the
soul in his playing, but a mere Hiugins
has no right to expect recognition for
playing with soul in the present state of
public feeling.
W. Ward Stephens, a young New York
pianist, has just shown native musicians a
road to success by chancing his name to
Varri Stefanski. He was Sherwood's
CORINNE AT THE COLUMBIA.
pupil and made a debut some years ago
at Chickering Hall, New York, which
created little or no public interest. With
added years Stephens has acquired added
wisdom. He realized that true greatness
could only become his through a foreign
norn de guerre and he asked Nikita to
compose a Polish fantasia his
American name for her theme. In a

moment of inspiration the little lady ex

that he has engaged him for an eight

Baldwin Theater.
The Tavary Grand Opera Company will
commence its second week to-morrow
night with the double bill of "Lucia
di Lammermoor" and "Cavalleria
Rusticana." The cast will be arranged
with a view to especial strencth.
On Tuesday night "Mignon" will bold
the boards, and for Wednesday mati
nee we are to have for the last time
"Martha." "Aida," in which the com
pany opened its engagement, will be heard
for the final time on Wednesday night.
"Carmen" will be presented on Thursday
evening, and the first performance of
Gounod's "Faust" will be heard durine
the present engagement on Friday night
The opera for the Saturday matinee is to
be "Trovatore," and Wagner's "Tann
hauser" will be sung before a large audi
ence on Saturday night. The third and
last week of the Tavary Company com
mences on Monday, February 17.
California Theater.
Thomas Keene, who will come to the
California Theater next Tuesday night for
an engagement of two weeks, to be devoted
to a series of the best classical tragedies, is
such a favorite in San Francisco as to
make it almost a work of supererogation
to point out the high position which te
holds on the American stage.
Keene is a believer in the higher mission
of the drama and the eternal qualities of
tragedy. He docs not believe that Shakes
peare will ever be out of fashion so long an
the English tongue shall be spoken, or that
the taste for tragedy is dying out.
He is said to have a large and excellent
company, of which the prominent mem
bers are Adele Belearde, Mary Timber
mann, Mrs. S. A. Baker, Frank Hennig,
Thomas Eapleson, Carl Ahrendt and Law
rence Lowell. Mr. Keene's opening bill
will be "Louis XI," a play tierived mainly
from Sir Walter Scott's romance, "Quen
tin Durward," which affords Mr. Keene a
fine opportunity for the depiction of a
smile wretch, whose only good point is
his superstitions dread of all that bears
the name religion. It is a character part
in line with Mr. Keene's best work, and by
many is regarded as tbe role which gives
him his best claim to fame. The reper
tory for ths balance of the first week is:
Wednesday. "Richard"; Thursday, "Rich
elieu"; Friday, "Hnmlet"; Saturday mati
nee, "Othello"; Saturday night, "Louis
XI"; Sunday night, "Kicfaard III."
Columbia Theater.
Jolly little Corinne and the sixty people
who form her support will change their
quarters%his week from the California to
the Columbia Theater. They will present
"Hendrick Hudson," the attraction which
proven such a magnet last week.
Newness, brightness and up-to-dateness
are the characteristics that impress them
selves upon everybody who goes to see
this production." The extravaganza is
cieverly constructed and brightly written,
the music is brisk and melodious, the
scenery new and elaborate. There is no
c'oubt that Corinne will repeat her last
week's success.
Ornnd Opera-House.
The coming attraction at the Grand is
the popular Californian story "My Part
ner," the piece associated with Louis Aid
rich and which made almost instantaneous
fame for its author, Hartley Campbell.
Since "My Partner" was written endless
attempts have been made on similar lines,
but they have not achieved the same suc
cess. It is said to be the only "red-shirt"
piece which New Yorkers will tolerate,
and the same is very nearly the case in
California.
The plot is well concocted and the situa
tions are naturally brought about. There
is plenty of breezy comedy. One of the
chief roles is the famous Major Henry
Clay Britt, for which part Charles Ed
monds has been especially engaged.
Grover's Alcazar.
The play for the coming week at the Al
cazar will be Bartley Campbell's "The
White Slave."
Through a series of natural misunder
standings the "While Girl" is sold into
slavery, and remains in the bonds of servi
tude, subject to the whim;, and caprices of
her owner, for a long period. The interest
is heightened from time to time until her
rightful birthright is made apparent. The
management announces that there will be
a storm of real rain on the stage, ard a
steamboat explosion amid the swollen
waters of the Mississippi River. There
will be a carnival of little darks' and big
darky jubilee singers, wing and buck dan
cers, banjo players and all the happy-go
lucky life of the plantation negro.
Valentines will be presented to every
one at the next Wednesday "Pop" mati-

nee. These touching tokens of 14th of
February will be given in addition to the
bicycle.
The Carleton opera company is an
nounced to commence an engagement at
Grover's Alcazar on February 24th. Rtina
Atchinson, who is spoken of as a very
gifted prima donna, will make her first
appearance in this City with the company,
which is said to be a complete one,
embracing J. Taylor and George Camp
bell as prirao tenori. It will bring a com
prehensive repertoire. The operas will be
changed three times each week.
Tivoii Opera- House,
"The Gentle Savage, 1 " with its Mexican
orchestra, Spanish fandango dances, moon
light ballet and real soldiers from the
Presidio, will hold the boards at the Tivoii
Opera-house this week.
The linal performances of this clever
home production will be given next week.
'â¢The Gentle Savage" will be followed by
Yon Weber's classic opera. "Der
Freischutz." Afterward several European
novelties will be heard, to be followed by a
season of erand opera and a spring pro
duction of a new burlesque upon an old
subject.
At the Orphanm.
The Garrisons, travesty efeetch artists;
the Pantzer Brothers, head balancers and
equilibrists; Walter Stanton and Fina
Corri, the latter reputed to be a talented
singing and dancing soubrette, are to be
this weeks addition to the Orpheum bill.
TUO.HA3 W. KtENÂ£ AT TUE CALIFORNIA.
Stanton promises to be the greatest novelty
of the present season. He makes up as a
giant rooster, and his appearance is so
realistic in his borrowed plumage that
game chickens engage in hot battle with
him on the stage. He is careful to put
pads on the spurs of his small opponents
before tne combat begins, but sometimes
they become disconnected, and the human
bird gets the worst of the conflict. This
happened once at the Albambra, London,
when a spirited Malay rooster was pitted
against him. The Malay feathered war
rior gave his towering enemy a swine be
tween the left eye and the nose, which left
him a black eye for a week afterward,
and had the blow been delivered a little
further to the left, Stanton says he would
have had no left eye remaining to assist
him in future battles. Carroll Johnson,
Rachel Walker ana Billy Carter, who have
all made hits, are retained.
Paderewski Recltnls.
Ban Francisco is preparing to torn out
in force for the first Paderewski recital, to
be given to-morrow night at the California
Theater. The great pianist is to oe given
a magnificent reception by the music
lovers, who have bought seats in immense
numbers for all three recitals.
The pianist will give only one of his re
citals in the evening, the remaining two
taking place on the afternoons of Wednes
day and Friday next, the 12tli and 14th of
February.
MACDONOUGH THEATER.
Manager Cook's Benefit and Mis* Maud
Morrell's Debut.
Charles E. Cook, the popular manager
of the Macdonough Theater, Oakland, will
be tendered a testimonial benefit to-mor
row evening at the theater over which he
so ably presides.
Desiring to announce for the occasion a
performance of unusual interest, Mr.
Cook has secured the services of the Fraw
ley Company, who will appear for one
night only in "Men and Women." The
play has been drawing crowded houses in
this City and will no doubt pack the Mac
donough to-morrow.
The occasion will also be memorable to
the many admirers of Mhs Maud Morrell,
as being her first appearance in Oakland
as a professional actress.
Dramatic Brevities.
Two per cent is about the proportion of
the population of a community that at
tends the theater each day.
It is definitely settled that Henderson's
"Sinbad" will play a fortnight's engage
ment at the Columbia Theater next month.
In his performance of "Richard III,"
Thomas Keene v.ears a suit of mail that
formerly belonged to Gustavus Brooke, the
English tragedian.
Nat Goodwin has just completed all the
arrangements for his forthcoming Aus
tralian tour. He appears at the Baldwin
previous to his departure.
"A Woman's Reason," the ne-w play
just produced by Charles Frohman's stock
company in New York, is described as a
fin de siecle "Frou-Frou."

repertoire includes "The Mountebank,"
"The Lion's Mouth," " Virginius,"
"Damon and Pythias,' 1 "Julius Caesar"
and "King Lear."

Regents Shy About Discussing Mayor
Sutro's Site for the Wllmer
ding School.
There was another conference of uni
versity regents on the subject of affiliated
colleges at the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art yesterday forenoon. President Kel
logg and Secretary Bonte were on time at
10:30 o'clock. Regents C. F. Crocker, J.
West Martin, Timothy Gay I'helps and
J. B. Reinstein did not keep th" 1 commit
tee waiting. "
Albert Pissis, Clinton Day an : Walter J.
Matthews, constituting a cor;mittee of !
architects appointed last Ti'i-sday, re- !
ported for duty yesterday morr.*ng. They j
inspected the live plans on exhibition at '
the institute and then went tut to the j
building site near the park. I
. The architects may be able tcs submit a j
report, recommending the adoption of j
one of the plans proposed or a if jection of '
all the designs submitted, by tlxÂ»: time the
regents convene next Tuesday. â ;
The architects have been specially in- j
structed to consider the cost of ihe build
ings, as the regents do not warn to appeal
to tBÂ« Legislature for another appropria- I
tion of public money to complete the j
buildiner enterprise.
The regents are shy when it comes to j
talking about sites for the Wilmerding |
School. No expression of opinion con i
cerning Mayor Sutro's gift of a block of
land north of the park could be obtained.
It Was said that leading men of Oakland
were about to organize for the purpose of |
raising money to acquire a site in that city
or one near Berkeley. The president of
the university was asked if the regents j
and faculty preferred that a site in Ala- j
meda County should be selected, but re- j
plied that expressions- of opinion on the ;
subject had not come to his knowledge.
The regents now want to dispose of the i
question pertaining to the affiliated col- â 
leges. When that is settled the site for '
the Wilmerding School may demand seri- j
ous reflection. Consideration of the two !
propositions at the same time may impose
a greater tension on the intellectual forces i
at the board and faculty than is consistent
with safety.
A SUPREME COUNCIL.
Delegates of the Young Men's Institute
Going to Denver to Organize a
Central Body.
The supreme delegates of the Young
Men's Institute have concluded all ar
rangements for their visit to Denver to at
tend the first Supreme Council of their
order. They will leave San Francisco
Tuesday evening and remain away a week
or ten days.
They are John J. McDade, ex-Judee J.
F. Sullivan, Frank McGlynn. Frank Mur
asky, Grand President John Lynch of Oak
.land, Frank Kierce, F. Gallagher of Fresno
and M. McEntee of Tacoma. Messrs.
Lynch and McEntee are going as alter
nates for J. F. Smith and Ed. I. Sheehan
of this City.
These prominent members of the insti
tute have been elected to represent the
Pacific jurisdiction at the Supreme Council
and a membership of abuut 5000 scattered
over the Pacific Coast.
At a meeting held last Wednesday they
came to an understanding as to a general
plan, which will be presented for consider
ation of the Supreme Council. The order
has grown to such a decree that one cen
tral governing power is needed to preserve
the principles and objects of the institute
from corruption or change, and it was with
this view before them the Pacific Coast
delegates discussed the subject of a rec
ommendation to the Supreme Council. The
Eastern jurisdiction lias a nmmbership of
12.000, with councils in several cities.
When the Eastern and Western dele
gates meet they will consider a constitu
tion for the new Supreme Council and the
advisability of establishing other jurisdic
tions by dividing the two already in ex
istence into several smaller ones. The
Supreme Council code of laws it is under
stood will be general in their effect with
out interfering materially with the rights
of district councils.
The Supreme Council will convene late
this week.
A Visitor From Chicago.
Detective Sergeant Frank G. Corbus of Chi
cago was a visitor at police headquarters yes
terday. He is on his way to Portland and
Seattle, and, being his first trip to the Pacific
Coast, he was desirons of spending a few days
in this City. His visit to the coast, he said,
was partly business and partly pleasure, but
he. was reticent as to the business part. He is
& comparatively young man and has been
seven years on the Chicago detective force,
during which he has earned an enviable repu

A MOODOO
OLP SAILORS declare that the
British ship Rathdown is afflicted
with a hoodoo. "There's a black
cloud over the craft," they say.
The ship has suffered ill-luck on
every trip since she first touched the water
at Belfast, Ireland, a little over four years
ago. The story of her calamitous experi
ences would fill a book. On her initial
trip, sailing from Belfast to Cardiff in
order to take on a carco for San Francisco,
she was caught in a violent hurricane, and
narrowly escaped capsizing. Her captain
( was compelled to run her into Fisciiard
Bay for shelter, and a week was consumed
in a passage that should have been made
in twenty-four hours. Starting on her
maiden trip to this port, she was off
Queenstown her third night at sea, when a
rising wind necessitated her shortening
Bail. The royals having been clewed up,
some of the crew, all negroes, were aloft
furling them, when of a sudden she was
Btruck by an enormous sea from the
weather side, and the crew was washed in
every direction. When the gale eased up
and the deck was clear, it was found that
the foretopmast and maintopcallantniasi
had been carried away, along with a couple
of the crew, and that three other sons of
Ethiopia were seriously crippled in the
disaster.
Then the gale grew furious again, and
for a whole week afterward the Rathdown
beat about before she managed to drop
anchor in Queenstown harDor. Her force
pump and life boat had been destroyed by
the heavy seas that boarded the ship, and
altogether her condition was such that she
had to be towed Lack to Belfast for re
pairs.
She was three months under repair, and
when at last she was being towed out of
the Belfast docks she struck the pierhead
so hard a blow as to cause her to leak
during her whole passage to the Pacific
BURYING ONE OF THE CREW OF THE RATHDOWN.

*- and necessitated , her being drydockedon
arriving at this port.
Rounding Cape Horn she was held off
four weeks in a succession of southwest
and northwest gales such as few ships
ever experienced and lost almost every
stitch of canvas and had her maintopmast
carried a way. The trio to port occupied
165 days, during which time the pumps
had to be kept continuously going. Even
in these calm waters, inside the Golden
Gate, the dark clouds hovered over her.
While lying at the Oakland pier, discharg
ing coke, the truss of hermainyard carried
away.
Her return â  trip to Barrow, England,
was comparatively free of either accident
or incident, and her captain began to con
gratulate himself on the assumption that
the ship had outsailed h*r bad luck. He
was soon .rnad6 aware of his mistake, for
the vessel had not : been long in dock
Barrow .when, without any warning, her
iimnyard came tumbling down on deck,
ana the â  stevedores and others who had
been working underneath had a mirac
ulous escape. The recurrence of such ac
cidents drew the suspicions of Lloyd
surveyors, who inspected the Rathdown,
and as a result, condemned all the iron
work appertaining to her yards, and com
pelled her builders to substitute new ma
terial. ' % â¢ ,
On her second voyage the Rathdown
brought a cargo of rails from England to
British Columbia., Once more the captain
selected a black crew. â 
While anchored off Sydney, B. C., the
crew received money from the captain ana
a Sydney barroom received it. from the
crew, a quarrel ensued, in : which one of
the blacks was knocked senseless. The
fellow returned to consciousness, and get
ting more whisky in him sprang at the
I st negro within reach and buried: a
Bheathknifc in his heart. The ship's crew
had the diverting experience of a mnrdee
trial at \ lctoria, B. d, and manslaughter
'*t.H-f^?n etdlct V, Xhe Â° the Rathdown set
Â^ sail for Havre. Prance.

â kuikinl .Â£? 112.* Of - lhe murdered man
â¢kuiking about the eiirouds, and the more
terrorized among them were certain that
the dead man's shade was marking out
somebody for destruction.
Near Havre one of the crew died and
was dropped to the bottom of the sea.
This made the fourth burial from the ship
in about two years. In the English Chan
nel the snip beat against a westerly wind
for seven days before she was picked up
by a tug, 200 miles south of Havre. Three
l.awscrs were parted before her head could
be brought to the wind, and then three
days of hard towing were required before
she could anchor at Havre.
The Rathdown next towed oyer to Car
diff and loaded coal for Montevideo. The
captain wanted another neuro crew, but
the owners opposed the scheme and whites
were taken out. The captain, at the last
moment, shipped a burly negro boatswain
over them.
At Montevideo the captain sought to
shift the vessel to another anchorage under
sail. Something went wrong with the
steering gear, however, and the Rathdown
plowed into a sandbank. It required the
| united efforts of four tugs to drag her off.
I She was then so leaky that another turn
: at a drydock was necessary.
The ship being ordered to Buenos Ayres,
I on arriving off that port a Spanish pilot
; was taken aboard. He brought a supply
i of liquor with him, and drank heavily.
Taking offense at some fancied insult he
i drew a razor and slashed about like a
j madman. The captain and two of the
j crew were badly cut before the Spaniard
was overpowered. The drunken pilot was
j seÂ»t ashore in a tug, and being tried there
for his offense was merely "reprimanded."
The moment the Rathdown docked at
| Buenos Ayres the whole crew deserted.
In ballast the Rathdown sailed to New
castle, N. S. W., and took on coal for San
Diego. While being moored to a buoy out
in the stream at Newcastle, ready for sea,
what is known as a "southeasterly buster"
came full swing into the harbor, along
with a tidal wave, and in the wash that
followed the latter the Rathdown parted
her mooring chains and narrowly escaped
collision with an iron bark that lay quite
close to her. A timely anchor saved her
till tueboat assistance arrived. San Diego
is the favorite port of the Rathdown, being
the only one up to date wherein the ves
sel has not sustained any accident.
From that port she sailed to Astoria,
and while being towed from there toPort
land she stuck fast off Tongue Point for
some time, although in ballast. Loadiag
half grain at Portland, she was returning
to Astoria to complete her cargo with sal
mon, when 6he ran into the immense steel
bridge across the Columbia River, her fore
topgallant mast being carried away and
her jibbooms bent out of all shape. The
bridge was damaged to the extent of $1000
and traffic over it was stopped for a week.
At Astoria the ship was repaired, and early
in last July she started from the mouth o"f
the Columbia, bound for Liverpool. Every
body here read about the Rathdown's
cargo shifting in rough weather off the
Horn, and how put into Auckland,
New Zealand, to have her cargo righted.
It was not until the middle of November
that she was enabled to continue her voy
age to England.
The Rathdown certainly has a hoodoo.

storeroom has also been enlarged. The
committee was instructed to change the

MENACED AN OFFICER.
Roughs in the Mission Try to Intimi
date an Officer of the Humane
Society.
Officer P. E. Laniar of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals stopped
and attempted to arrest a peddler at the
corner of Eleventh and Howard streets
yesterday afternoon. The horse the fellow
drove was in a pitiable condition, and
scarcely able to haul the rickety wagon it
was hitched to. A large crowd gathered,
among which were several rough?, who
threatened to make it interesting for Mr.
Lamar should he lay his hands on the
owner. The better element in the crowd,
however, assured the officer tiiat if he
did not arrest the peddler they would cause
him to be arrested. He was in the act of
climbing on the wagon after his man, re
gardless of either party, when the peddler
jumped off the other side and escaped
down Seventh street.
Lamar found the horse too sick to carry
to the home, and took it to a stable near
by. He said he thought it would be nec
essary to shoot the animal.

HUMBOLDT HAS RETURNED
Strange Adventures of an Ala
meda Homing Pigeon
in Oregon.
Restored to His Owner After a Year's
Absence, He Fought for and
Won His Nest.
Humboldt has returned to his accus
tomed place in the pigeon loft of T. W.
Leydecker in Alameda, and in conse
quence that gentleman considers himself
the most fortunate fancier in California.
Nearly a year ago Mr. Leydecker sent
seven of his favorite birds â five veterans
and two that hatched in 1893â for a fly
from Ashland, Or., to Alameda.
As the youngest had never been beyond
Sissons he was not greatly surprised,
though far from pleased, when the older
birds returned without them. The libera
tion was in a snowstorm. He had about
given up hope of ever seeing either of
them again, when he received word from
Portland, Or., that one of the carriers,
Humboldt, was at that point and would be
forwarded to Mr. Leydecker on receipt of
$50. The letter came from W. W. Bretter
ton, a brother fancier, to whom the bird
had been offered by John Henderson, who
had caught it after it had alighted on his
house in an exhausted condition.
Mr. Leydecker answered that he did not
object to the amount, but he thought that
the bird should be returned without ran
som, inasmuch as pigeon-flying wa s merely
for pleasure and absolutely without profit.
While the correspondence was in piog
ress Humboldt made his escape from his
original captor and was taken by another
man, who with more iairness offered to
return him to Alameda if expenses were
paid. This Mr. Leydecker was willing to
do, and yesterday Humboldt was back in
the loft as happy as any pigeon could be.
An amusing scene followed his return to
the flock. His nest in his absence had
been "jumped" by another pigeon, and
the intruder was in possession *w lien Hum
boldt entered the loft. Without a mo
ment's hesitation the prodigal, with all
the belligerence of his kind, waddled over
to his old accustomed place and gave the
holder thereof a sound drubbing, finally
driving him away, and settling down with
an air that portended that he had come to
stay.

IN CHILDOHOOD`S REALM
WE have made our childrens'
page to-day a real "valen
tine page." A little early,
you think? But, remember,
by next Sunday Valentine's
day will have joined the countless proces
sion of all past happy days and will live
only as a sweet memory.
That it may be a sweet one â that there
may be no regretsâ l am gome to give my
boys and girls a wee bit of advictf of how
to spend the day.
Kenu-mber. it should be the merriest,
fullest of frolic festival of the year. Have
as much pure fun as you can, but oh,
please don't bring the flush of anger or
shame to the cheek of any human being.
Shun the company of those two wicked
imps, "spite" and "jealousy," who are so
ready to take advantage of the "mystery"
and "secrecy" attendant on St. Valen
tine's day to wound the feelings of others
by reminding them of some mental or phy
sical frailty.
In other words, have nothing to do with
those vulgar disgusting publications called
comic valentines.
Make yours a day of fun, loving and
giving, and at its close may your minds be
filled with the peace which comes at
twilight to the heart of him "whose deeds
have been most kind, whose words have
fallen like sunshine where they went."
Homo-Made Valentines for Girls.
Almost any useful thing which you take
pleasure in sending mysteriously to rela
tives or friends can be made to take on the !
real valentine spirit by
painting across it some
original legend, humorous,
sentimental, or pertinent,
or by the artistic uss of the
'conventional hearts and
bow-knots, which are the !
very essence of 14th of Feb- '
ruary gifts. Let ingenuity I
be your master requisite, and neatness !
your most obedient servant.
Probably one of the most practical gifts
is the always-acceptable picture-frame.
The simplest kind is made of two square
envelopes (tinted ones are the prettiest),
laid face to face, and punched witn an awl
a half-inch from the top and bottom of one
side. Througtj the small holes thus made
run baby ribbon, and tie the two envelopes
tog ther in small bow-knots. Now the
frame stands firmly, and has two leaves ;
which are daintily held together. On the
inside sketch lightly with a hard pencil j
the outlines of an oblong picture-opening, i
In the center of this opening (found by
drawing diagonals from corner to corner)
place a small dot, using this as your start
ing point for cutting.
Cut with the scissors from this dot to
each corner of the outlined opening.
Turning the fouÂ»-triangles thus formed
back from the lead-pencil lines, and you
have a space for pictures which are kept in
place by sealing the backs of the envelopes.
(Figs. 1 and 2.)
Other frames may be made of two heart
shaped pieces of thin pasteboard (with
picture-opening in one), covered with linen
or figured China silk, overhanded neatly
together except at the top, where the pic
ture is to be slipped in and finished with a
double knot of ribbon, in which is tied a
brass ring, which serves as a hanger for the
frame.
These frames may be made still more
pimply of two circular pieces of cardboard
or celluloid, pinked around the edges, with
a tiny hole in each scallop.
Through these holes run narrow ribbon
of a contrasting color, and finish at -the
top like preceding frame with bow-knot
and small brass ring.
The pinking may be roughly simulated
by notching the edges and making with an
awl the required hole 3at regular intervals.
This photo-holder is particularly pretty
made of sage-green celluloid, laced with a
dark and light shade of green ribbon, with
the lines traced above the heart-shaped
oneninc, as in Fig. 3.
If you do not happen to be skilled in the
use of pen or brush do
not hesitate to cover
your fancy work with
China silk. Beautiful
designs, violets strewn
over liglit grounds or
dashing sprays of deli
cate chrysanthemums,
form a decoration in
itself, often far surpass
ing the most ambitious
of amateur work. One-
quarter of a yard of this silk, costing about
25 cents, will make two circular frames.
A pretty laundry tablet may be made in
a similar wny, having an oblong frame of
cardboard painted or covered with silk,
and placing in the center a tablet of white
celluloid, on which in gold lettering are
placed the names of articles usually sent
to be washeu . Â«&Â»ving a ejrace on the left
side for the number. Finish this at the !
top by a bow of baby ribbon with two long i
ends, to one of which a small pencil is fas
tened, and to the other the sponge is tied.
A tiny heart-shaped needle-book, covered j
on the outside with kid from the long j
wristlets of some wornout glove, and in- i
side with a scrap of pink silk. Three little j
button-holed leaves of white Hannel within 1 1
for the needles, and all tied togethe r with
pink bow-knots of baby ribbon, as in ligure
5, make a dainty valentine lor grand
mother's work-basket. Paint across its
face the words, "With heartfelt greetings."
Sachet-cases, large and small, in simple
and fantastic designs, are now so much
used that one can never come amiss. A
pretty one, tastefully made in the old bag
shape of shaded heliotrope ribbon, filled
with a large quantity of heliotrope sachet
(for the fragrance vanishes with astonish
ing rapidity from a small allowance of
powder), tied together with a splashing
bow of dark heliotrope ribbon, with the
following lines traced carelessly across it
with gold paint or with ink, would cer
tainly give pleasure to mother, sister or
friend :
I send you, dear, a valentine,
The sweetest I could fina,
Though iL's not half so sweet as you,
Who are so good and kind.
If you wish to pay a humorous compli
ment to a friend, from a heavy piece of
cardboard cut an outline of thereof a
shoe, and from some bright-colored paper
the outline of a small heart. Tie the two
together with a ribbon bow and write in
ink or gilt lettering :
1 Rond tny iove, sweet Valentine,
With all my heart and sole
Upon a neat menu card put a senti
mental rebus, as in Fig. 6.
The larger the sole the greater the im
plied compliment.
Here again, if you are lacking in sketch
ing powers, you may substitute the real
things (bows, matches, cents, etc.). Deftly
tied or pasted on, they greatly enhance the
unique appearance of the card.
A dainty blotter for a friend's writing
desk may be made by tying together,
with rose-colored ribbon, two or three blot
ters and a piece of cardboard of the same
dimensions. Ornament the edge of the
cardboard with water-color gilt, and paint
in one corner trie harrowing design in
figure 7. Write underneath the rhyme
given on the design, or any other ridicu
lous one which may occur to you.

Fig. 7.
A pretty little heart-shaped sachet
(Fig. 8) may be made of silk", and tilled
I with violet or heliotrope powder. A silk
i or lace frill is added around the ecge, and j
a bow of ribbon at tne top, and this mi
i scription painted or worked in outline
stitch:
A penwiper of kid with several leaves of
chamois-skin may also be cut in the shape
of a heart tied together with ribbon and
! ornamented with the appropriate verse
I found in figure 9.
Adapting these hints to your own. inge
nuity and resources you will be able to
manufacture valentines which will prove
more desirable than any which you could
afford to buy. You will have, besides, the
fun of the making, the satisfaction of
gratifying the wants of friends, and best
of all, the dear old mystery of sending,
which seems to make of this happy, non
sensical day a sort of second Christmas. â
C. B. Jokdax, in Youth's Companion.
Ursula, the Child Slave.
The child slave Ursula sat in the wide
marble portico awaiting the coming; of her
imperious little mistress.
A moist, cool breeze, perfumed from the
great beds of flowers at the side of the
court, touched her soft cheek caressingly.
Albeit her face waa so round and young
and might have been so sweet, it was very
sullen and unhappy looking.
The fortunes of the cruel Roman wars
had brought Ursula io Rome, away from
her home and kindred, where she had
been petted, humored, caressed and
spoiled, as a playmate for the little Lady
Irene, an exacting, capricious mistress
enough, as badly spoiled and quicli of tem
per as her slave.
At last Irene c;.me dancing down the
great stairway and out through the por
tico, followed by her attendants.
"Come, thou little surly face," she cried,
gayly ; "we have permission to take a
morning stroll, and then to the baths.
We will visit the shops and test tire fruits
of tne country girls. I may buy theea
bracelet if thou wilt be merry."
She caught her hand, and Ursula, with a
child's ready pleasure, sprang up, delight
ed at the promised treat.
"How gay the streets are!" Irene ex
claimed, as they emerged. "Didst bring a
wreath to offer "at the temple of Jupiter?"
she asked, suddenly, glancing at Ursula's
empty hands. "Of course not, thou care
less one."
She swung the girl's hand violently away
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1896.
and struck her a stingine blow on the
cheek.
"Thou never doest the thing I want,"
she said, angrily.
"Oh, my lady f Irene's nurse exclaimed.
"Thy father would be ill pleased to see
thee so demean tnysalf on the streets. Re
member, the girl knew not that we were
coming until the instant."
Irene's ill humor vanished instantly.
"Forsooth, we will buy a finer wreath
'Come, thou little surly face,'' she cried.
than that little stupid can make. Come,
get not that scowling face again. Thou
art ill of temper. I will have my father
sell thee for a dog. I tell thee, be merry
such a morning."
While they were returning home a deli
cate Neapolitan shell necklace in one of the
booths caught Irene's fancy. In spite of
the nurse's remonstrance she insisted on
buying it. She was holding it up ad
mil ing it when a company of soldiery
swept by.
Irene "and her train drew up hastily
against the wall. Ursula, taking advan
tage of the crowd, allowed herself to be
violently pushed, against Irene, knocking
the necklace out of her hand to the ground,
where it was trampled to fragments in an
instant.
Irene turned upon her like a little fury,
and the blows rained thick and fast upon
her face and head.
Ursula's reason left her completely, and
if the nurse had not caught her hand the
iittle Lady Irene would have been paid in
kind.
"Dost wish the lash, mad child?" whis
pered the nurse. "Fall back among the
slaves. Irene will soon forget."
"Irene may, but Ursula will not," mut
tered the maddened girl.
Late that evening the nurse came to
Ursula's little pallet.
"I heard the Nazarene to-night," she
whispered, softly, "and he said the un
known god did not teach veneeance, like
Jupiter and the other gods, but that we
were to love them that hated us and do
good to them that despitefully used us."
Ursula sat up, pushing back the tangle
of her thick black hair.
"I9.the unknown god great?" she asked,
eagerly. ''If I offer libations to him ne
may strike Irene dead. She does not know
him to intercede."
The nurse shook her head.
"No, thou wicked child; the Nazarene
says, 'Though he be greater than all gods,
he is & god who says to love.' "
"Is that the greatest thing â to love?"
asked Ursula, wonderinglj.
"Truly, I think so," answered the
woman. "Would it not be the greatest
thing for thee to love Irene?' 1
"The gods themselves could not do a
greater thing," answered Ursula, with
clinched fists and flashing eyes.
"Thou art not a Roman, "but thou art of
Thessaly, and brave blood runs in the
veins of Thessaly. Thy father was a noble.
If it be the hardest thine to love, then
show t!>y birthâ and love," counseled the
wily nurse.
The greater part of the night Ursula lay
with wide-open eyes thinking deeply.
"If I Joyed Irene I would tell her what I
overheard Lady Fulvia say to Lady Viliani.
Ido not think it true. 1 see little beauty
in her. She is vain enough now. Bah ! "l
will not please her so; but then the harder
the task the greater it is to do it. Well, I
will wait until the morning. Perhaps the
unknown goft will aid me," she communed
to herself.
As usual, the next morning she took her
station in the portico.
Irene came in pleasant humor, her
small form enveloped in a white robe,
heavily embroidered in purple.
"Thou hast a brighter face this morn
ing," she greeted Ursula. "I beset thee
right hardly yesterday, did I not?" she
continued, with a ringing laugh. " 'Twas
most uncouth of thee to break my pretty
chain, but nurse says it was the soldiers'
fault, not thine. Here's that bracelet I
promised to pay thee for the headache I
gave thee. Put it on!" she commanded,
imperiously, throwing it at Ursula's feet.
The blood surged over the girl's face as
she stooped unwillingly and slipped the
bauble on.
"I thank thee, Lady Irene," she said,
softly.
Irene looked at her in astonishment.
"Somu one muat be teaching thee man
ners," she said.
Out among the great beds of flowers
they gathered industriously awhile, Irene
chattering incessantly, Ursula, as usual,
quiet.
At length Ursula said :
"Irene, I heard somewhat of thee the
other day."
"No?" replied Irene curiously. "What
beardst thou?"
"The Ladies Villani and Fulvia were in
the portico awaiting thy mother. Thou
hadst but passed. Dost remember?"
Irene nodded
"Lady Fulvia said 'The little Irene bids
"Ursula Crowned the Statue."
fair to carry off the palm of beauty among
our Roman maidens when she hath a few
more years.'
" 'Thou speakest truly,' Lady Villain j
answered. 'She hath a supple form, a j
proud and winsome face.' "
Irene sprang forward and kissed Ursula
imDetuously, then ran to the fountain,
where she stood over the clear water
pluming and preening herself like some
pretty bird. Ursula watched her with a
half smile.
"That was very hard to do," she sighed.
"I feel better, though, than I did when I
wanted to strike her."
Irene came dancing back and threw her
self down on a bench near her, watching
her through half-closed eyes.
"Thinkest thou the noble ladies told the
truth, Ursula?" she asked, half teasingly,
half vainly.
Ursula's face reddened.
"I have seen but few of the young
Roman maidens; I know but little of their
beauty." She hesitated, then said slowly:
"Still, Lady Irene. 1 know of mine own
sight thou art fairâ when thy heart is
pleasant," she added, half defiantly. "My
father hath said to me: 'Fair thoughts
make fair faces.' "
Irene sprang up impatiently.
"Thoua^t impertinent. 1 want none of
thy chatter. Hasten with the flowers, else
they will wilt before a chaplet is woven.
Thou hast enough now. Come to the por
tico and we will weave them."
When the garlands were completed she
strung them on her arms and set one on
her soft, dark hair.
"Now, I will be the bearer, and thou
shalt crown," she laughed.
So Ursula, climbing the pedestals,
crowned the white statues.
One of the vases had been carelessly
placed on its pedestal, and, as Irene leaned
against it, it wavered as if to fall. With
the swiftness of a panther, Ursula darted
upon Irene and hurled her away, just as
the mass of earth and marble fell crashing
to the floor.
The numerous attendants who were
always lounging about rushed to the spot.
Irene sat at a little distance, breatnless
and dismayed, but Ursula was partially
under the mass. They extricated her
gently and bore her, "limp and still,
through the wide halls to her tiny cell.
Many hours after she came to conscious
ness. They had sent Irene's nurse for the
child's especial attendant, and to her she
said, groping for her hand:
"The Nazarene was right. The unknown
god irives the greatest command, but dost
know 'twas easier to save the life of Lady
Irene than to tell her what LadjrFulvia
said?"
After a long silence she cried, tri
umphantly:
"I, a noble of Thessaly, can love my ene
mies."
Then it was very quiet until the nurse
arose and laid the slender hands across
the little breast, storm -tossed no longer,
and pressed the heavy lids down over the
eyes, whose depth had lost their trouble. â

Another First Valentine Story.
A little boy loved pie. My, how he loved
pie. He had no brother; he had no sister.
He had lots of cousins who lived close by.
The cousins called his mamma "auntie."
So the little boy called his mamma
"auntie" too. His mamma knew how to
make lovely pies.
Some days that little boy asked his
mamma for pie about one hundred times.
He asked for it iv a great many ways.
Sometimes he said "'please" and some
times he didn't. Sometimes he got the
pie and sometimes he didn't. One day,
no matter how nicely he asked for pie, he
did not get any.
He was puzzled. He sat down to think.
At last he jumped up quickly and ran to
his mamma's side. Puttinsr his arms
around her neck he said: "Oh, auntie,
I'm so thirsty for pie!"
Valentine's day came soon after this.
The little boy had never had a valentine.
He wished for one very much. When
his father came home from town that
night he brought the pie-loving boy a
sealed, stamped envelope.
There was something inside of it.
The envelope had the little boy's name
written across its back.
He looked at it for a few moments,
thinking about the pretty valentine that

DONALD ..SERIESâ NO. XV. ,
'. .:â¢ FOR tiny; BOYS.
1 am going to tell you about the first val
entine that : Donald ever received and I
know you w^ll think it was very strange.
; That Valentine's day was : such a cold,
stormy day. Tiie wind \ howled and the
rain, pouring down so hard, made the lift
tie pollywogs â oh, I mean the raindrops â
just scamper down the window-panes.
; Mamma and Donald were- sitting in the ;
cozy corner close "by. the fire trying to keep :
warm. -> â â : ,.ly^ â - â¢- . ' â .-â â -.,.':
Donald held his rubber-ball in his hand.
I Every.once in a while be bounced the ball
on the floor; catching ut: as it bounded
back. ; Once he '6 missed it * and the : ball
rolled far- under the lounge. ; ; ;
" Down on his knees the little boy went
and soon had the plaything tightly clasped
in ; his i hands; \ but, alas! as he was ' rising
to his feet he gave his head a terrible
bump against the end of the lounge. Oh,
how it did hurt, and how poor little Don
ald did cry.
W T hiie mamma was bathing the poor,
sore place and trying to soothe the sob
bing boy, tinkle, "tinkle, tinkle went the
doorbell. It was the postman in all the
rain, and he had a valentine for Donald.
When be opened it with his trembling
little hands â he was so excited because he
had never had a velentine before â he saw
a picture of â what do you suppose?
Well, it was a picture of three little girls
bumping tl'eir heads.
Now, don't you think it was very strange
that the little boy with the bumped head
should get a valentine about bumped
heads?
Donald and his mamma did and it made
them think that St. "Valentine was magic
just the same as is dear old St. Nick.

The letter from the little girl who lives
in South San Francisco will be published
in next Sunday's Call, because it refers
to Washington's birthday.
An interesting "Legend of the Poppy"
was also received, and will be published
on the "children's page" in the near
future. Boys and girls, please write on
one side of your paper only.
Now for the letters, which to me are the
very best part of "Childhood's Realm."
Santa Crvz, Cal., Feb. 4, 1896.
Editor ChOdren'i Page: I love to read the '
children's page. I wisn there were two pages
of "ChildhooU's Realm." I am interested in
the story about Donald. I have forty-two
paper dolls, nnd I piay with them on rainy :
days. Very truly yours,

_ San Francisco. February 3, 1896.
Editor Children's Pageâ Dear Sir: In answer
to your letter on Sunday about St. Valentine
I decided to write what I know, viz.:
Valentine was a holy priest in Rome who
with St. Marias and his family, assisted the
martyrs in the persecution under Claudius 11.
He was appreheuded and sent by the Emperor
to the Prefect of Rome, who, on finding all his
promises to make him renounce his faith inef
fectual, commanded him to be beaten with
clubs and afterward to be beheaded, which
was executed on the 14th of February, rtbout
the year 270. 7
To abolish the heathens' superstitious cus
tom of boys drawing girls' names in horn* of
their goddess Februata Juno, on the 15th of
this month, several zealous pastors substituted
the names of saints in billets given on this
day.
I think this is his exact history and the
meaning of nis day, for I have heard of it
whenever it neared Valentine's day. Yours
truly, \v. R. Dillon (age 13),
215 Fill more street, City.
San Francisco, Feb. 2, 1896.
Editor Children's Pageâ Dear Sir: I do not
know a great deal, but will do the best I can
upon the subject of Valentine's day.
Valentine's day, a festival celebrated on
February 14 and established in England, Scot
land and France aoout the fifteenth century,
was very popular among the upper classes and
at many European courts. On St. Valentine's
eve spinsters and bachelors were accustomed
to meet in a social way, write upon bits of
paper the names of a number of spinsters and
bachelors of their acquaintance, throw them
into a basket and then draw them out one nt a
time, care being exercised that each should
draw one of the opposite sex. the person thus
I drawn being the drawer's valentine. The fes
tival was introduced into America at an early
day, but its observance has since undergone
material change, and is annually becoraine:
less and less general, at present being limited
to friends exchanging snonymouscommnnica
tions with each other, the same being made in
verse or verses referring to a variety of topics,
the subject being illustrated by cuts of an
amusing or sentimental character.
I will add just a little more. St. Valentine's
&ar, the 14th of Februaryâ it was a very old
notion alluded to by Shakespeare that on this
day birds began to couple. Hence, perhaps,
arose the custom of sending on this day letters
containing professions of love and affection.
Alice M. Bell (age 13),

San Francisco, Cal., Feb. 4, 1896.
Mr. Call Editor: I am a little girl 11 years
old and have a little brother 6 years old. I
read the children's page every Sunday. lam
very interested in it. I read the children's
letters and I thought I would write, too, and
tell a few things about St. Valentine. When
February comes all the children send valen
tines to their friends. St. Valentine was a
poor man and on the 14th of February he
would go around begging and would get some
thing from every house, and when he returned
home he would be hung around with bags and
bundles like a "beast of burden." But yet he
would make the best of it. He had a kind
word for every .child who came running to the
door. My letter is setting long, so I must
close. Your friend, Rose C. Bealdet.
333 California avenue, San Francisco.
San Francisco, Feb. 3, 1896.
Editor Children's Pageâ Dear Sir: My an
swers to Sunday questions are as follows: St.
Valentine's dayâ a day sacred to St. Valen
tineâthe 14tli of February. It was a very old
notion alluded to by Shakespeare that on this
day birds began to couple. Hence, perhaps,
arose the custom of sending on this day letters
containing professions of love and affection.
This Valentine, who was also commemo
rated on the 14th of February, is invoked, es
pecially in Italy and Germany, in .cases of epi
lepsy and cognate disorders.
This Is my answer about St. Valentine.
Lillik Pearl Mitchell,
6 Elliott park. 12 years old.
Dear Editor: Some people say St. Valentine
was a Bishop, others say hb was just a com
mon man, but was so noted for lm love and
charity that the custom of choosing valentines
arose from this. But I think the prettiest idea
is that the birds are supposed to select their
mates on that day. Sending valentines is an
old, old custom. The valentine was not always
a love letter, but was often gloves, garters and
pretty pieces of jewelry. I think it a very
pretty custom, only I don't like the comic
ones. Your friend, Byra Sill,

YOUTHFUL STEEET MEBOHANTS.
Honest Pennies Turned by Boys Who
Karn a Living.
Almost any morning, snowy, rainy,
windy, promising clear, however the
weather happens to be, an enterprising
group of youngsters may be seen in the
City Hall Park or any of the conspicuous
news centers eagerly scanning the columns
of a newspaper. The newspaper may be
the joint property of all, or else it is a loan
from some friend in the news business.
Picturesque enough these small citizens
look, eager, excited, urged on to keener
interest by the knowledge that bread, and
perhaps butter, certainly a place to sleep,
depend upon their exertions. No man of
business scans the morning daily more
thoughtfully, seated at his luxurious
breakfast table, than do these would-be
merchants, turned out of their lodging
places after a hasty meal, in the cold light
of a wintry dawn.
"Here's a canal-boit in," exclaims one.
"And a fruit-schooner," says another,
pointing with a childish finger to ihe ad
vertisement.
"I guess that's about all to-day," says
the boy in possession of the newspaper,
proceeding to fold it up.
"Hold on !"' exclaims a third. "I think
there was something about a fire uptown ;
that would be a chance!"
In less than five minutes the knot of
boys that stood so long with their heads
together have vanished. Two of them
have gone to the canal-boat, others to the
fruit-schooner, yet another party has set
off uptown to the scene of the tire. This
has been an unusually good morning
when three such promising chances for
business offer.
The boys clean out the canal-boats,
brush out the cabins and scrub up the
decks a bit, and in return for their services
they get potatoes or other produce which
the boat has happened to bring, and such
remnants of coal as may chance to be left
over in the coal bin. The potatoes and
coal both are readily vended in the tene
ment-house districts, where the people are
glad to get small lots at less than market
price.
For helping to unload a fruit schooner
the boys get paid in oranges and bananas,
and these they sell on the streets or round
at the different houses.
For helping to clear up the rubbish
where a tire has made havoc, odd lots of
the damaged goods are given them, such
as gloves, suspenders, socks, etc., and these
the boys sell at a few cents a pair to com
rades of their own, who are glad of the
chance to get the articles for a nominal
price.
Several of these little arabs went into
business not long ago, establishing a wood
yard on a diminutive scale in a cellar,
which they rent for $1 50 a month. They
get the frames and discarded boxes from
various Jarge establishments, conspicuous
chemical factories and type foundries, and,
after breaking them up, sell them for
kindline wood. Sometimes they break up
boxes and frames for the establishment,
working a couple of hours for the privilege
of usine what they can carry away. At
first they broke up the frames with a stout
paving stone, but later thej* have been
able to procure hatchets and an ax.
For. 6 cents these venturesome spirits
secure a clean, comfortable bed in the
lodging-houses. Breakfast co3ts 6 cents,
likewise dinner; lunch they set or not,
according to circumstances ; but no inmate
is allowed in the lodging-houses after the
breakfast hour unless he is ill; even then
the hospital is the more likely place of
refuge. The boys are all turned out in the
early morning, and the dormitories, living
and eating rooms made clean and receive
pure and wholesome ventilation until
nightfall.
Eighteen cents is a good deal for a small
boy to earn everyday in the year. Yet
this is the lowest rate at which even the^
most charitable houses can afford to lodge*
them.
From 8 to 14 years of age are these self
supporting little men, and a list of the em
ployments by which they earn their
precarious livelihood is' interesting.
Many of them scour the lines of
railroad tracks for pieces of iron,
bolts, horseshoes, nails, hoops, etc.,
and ofttimes, according to accounts,
they Bnd a dime, a nickel or even a quarter
shining in the way. This old iron is sold
to the regular venders, who make a busi
ness of collecting it. Many business men,
loath to leave their desks even ior an hour,
have their lunch brought to them and
boys are employed for this purpose by the
big lunch companies.
\\ ashing dishes in restaurants on extra
busy days is another source of income, and
boys domestically inclined wait on sick
l>eople in the poorer districts, who are
glad to have nimble hands and feet at their
disposal for an hour during the day. If a
man or woman is confined to bed, with no
one to sweep or clear up the room, no one
to hand a cup of water or to fetch a bowl
of needed nourishment from some neigh
bor's kitchen, they are glad to give a boy
a dime who is willing and intelligent.
"I lent a lad $2 50 to set up in the lem
onade business," said the superintendent
of a big lodging-house. "He got two big
tin pails, some glasses, a squeezer and ma
terials. In six weeks he had paid me my
money back and had established for him
self a tolerably good trade." â New York
Tribune.

ANEW style of phonograph, that
seems to possess qualities which
render it thoroughly practical and
within the reach of all, says
La Natnre, has just been devised
by Mr. Werner. The different apparatus
hitherto described in these columns have
given excellent results, but have not real
ized as well as the one under considera
tion all the desiderata that we have a right
to expect from a family apparatus. The
principal parts of the "loud speaker" do
not differ essentially from those of the
primitive phonograph. We find therein
the wax cylinder of the same form as that
of the usual Edison model; parallel with
this a carriage, A, to which is added the
The Werner Phonograph.

2. General view and internal details of the ap
paratus.
3. Register n? disk.
4. Disk for the reproduction of speech.
registering disk or tbe speaking one and
the cornet for allowing speech or song to
be heard by a room full of people, or, if
preferred, a thin tube of rubber for indi
vidual listening.
In figures 3 and 4 are shown the two
principal parts, the register and the trans
mitter, which have been greatly improved
since the Edison invention of 1878. The
essential part in both is a disk of mica
closing a small ebonite box surmounted
by a tube of the same material, which is
adjusted to the carriage, A. The latter
carries a bent tube ana the various parts
for the registering or reproduction of the
sounds. When it is desired to inscribe
speech or song upon the cylinder a mica
disk carrying a small knife (3) is used.
The cylinder is set in motion by ungear
ing the clockwork movement," and one
places an inch or so from the mouth a
small cornet fixed to the extrerrHy of a
flexible tube, whose other end is a ijusted
to the free part of the carriage.
When it is afterward desired to repro
duce what has thns been registered, the
other disk (4) is rabfttitated for iLe lirst.
It wil! be remarked that this differs en
ti.-eiy from the other, in that toe small
blunt point that rests upon the cylinder
is not in the center of the vibrating disk,
but at the side, and is connected with the
center through a lever. These arrange
ments have been especially studied, and
it iÂ« to them that is due the purity of the
articulation and the intensity of the sound I
fvhat the apparatus under consideration I
pives. Tbe result is such that, even with- .
ont the addition of any accessory, what '
the apparatus says may be understood at a i
distance. The clockwork contributes j
in a large measure toward rendering
the apparatus practical. It is so
constructed as to be entirely hidden
in the base of The apparatus, the
dimensions of which are 10 Dy 6 by 5 inches.
The regulating part, although not abso
lutely new, is very interesting. It consists
of a ball governor, D, which causes a disk,
P, to approach or recede according to the
velocity of a stop, I, forming a brafce. The
position of this stop is regulatable at will
by means of a lever, C, which is acted upon
by a screw, B. The starting or stopping
of the motion is effected by means of the
handle, M, which, through a flexible rod,
acts directly upon the lever.
It is, therefore, very easy to vary the
velocity of the registering cylinder, and
nothing is more curious than to make it
rapidly repeat what has been slowly pro
nounced. When, especially, one listens to
his own voice, the effect is exceedingly
surprising.

engraving shows, one side of the upper i 3
folded over the other, like a flap, and they
are fastened together by a lace which run's
through the eyelets, and hooks into a hole

By this comfortable device the boot may
be easily removed from the foot or
tightened upon it through simply loosen
ing or pulling the lace.
A NEW MOTOR.
Hermann Ganswindt of Berlin is con
stantly improving bis peculiar motor sys
tem, which really consists of the use ol
leverage and transmissions in a way not
before attempted. One of his latest inno
vations is a motor-plow, which is worked
by one man, although three plow-shares
are employed. Working in the fields with
this plow will cost less than a fourth
of plowing by steam, and less than a
sixth of plowing in ' the old way, em
ploying human labor. The manner in
which the apparatus .is employed ex
plains itself in the accompanying
cut. Ganswindt motors are now be
SLX-BLADED PLOW WORKED BY A GANSWINDT MOTOR.
ing universally applied for industrial
purposes, and many manufacturers are
constructing transmissions and treading
attachments to foot-power machines ac
cording to his designs, paying Ganswindt
a handsome royalty. On* of these appli
ances is a bottle-washing machine, which
is constructed by Otto Yogel of Berlin.
Whereas in his old apparatus the work
men had to pedal 110 times a minute to
obtain 800 revolutions of the brush, the
present apparatus enables the workmen to
obtain 1200 revolutions and trundle the
pedal but 10 or 12 times within a minute.
The saving of labor is considerable and
the additional cost is paid back in very
little time.
THE JtOEXTGEN "PHOTOGRAPHY."
Discoveries like that of Professor Roent
gen, which, for want of a better term, may
be approximately called photographing
the invisible, are startling because they
are such unexpected triumphs in man's
perpetual struggle with the forces of
nature. Like a blast in a mine, which
blows out the rock wail and reveals a new
and unsuspected vein, they not only add a
new resource to those already possessed,
but suggest the possibility of gaining many
more advantages which have hitherto
been considered absolutely impossible.
â¢Unlike the successive" discoveries of
serums ana lymphs for the cure of dis
eases, which are only developments of
Jenner's discovery of vaccination, or the
recent addition of a new element to the
three of which ibe air had been supposed
to consist, which was suspected long be
fore it was found, Roentgen' 3 discovery is
not only new iv itself â for the few pre
vious experiments in this direction cannot
be said to have revealed it â but it deals
with an entirely new principle.
A new force has been found in nature.
It proceeds by means of rays, but it is not
light, for it penetrates where light cannot;
nor heat, for it does not warm. It has
some connection with electricity, but it
has no influence on the most sensitive
magnetic instruments. The discoverer
calls the means by which it operates
"X rays," because he has no better name
l for them. Other scientists call them
I "cathode rays," because they seem to
proceed from the cathode, or end by
! which the current leaves a galvanic celf.
Doubtless more will t>e known about the
new force in a short time, for the best
j students of electricity and kindred sciences
1 are now hard at work on it. As yet, it has
only been discovered; it has not been de
veloped or described.
It seems pretty certain, however, that
while it will enable us to see many things
hitherto invisible, each as the sknll of a
1 living creature, or abnormal conditions in
; various parts of the body, it will not
! show them to us bo clearly as to facil
itate minute study of them. Strictly
' speaking, it will not enable us to see the
I actual objects at all, but only images
of them printed on a sensitive plate by
a process which is provisionally called
: photography, though it is not pbotogra
, piiy, but only something analogous to it.
j But these images are in the nature of
! shadows, and shadows, though they may be
â  sharp in outline, are dim in details. They
', are indefinite and vague, and, while it is
j impossible, of course, to predict what will
j be accomplished in the future, the nature
of the rays and the manner in which they
are said to work, by recording simply the
! varied resistance of the different media
I through which they pass, seem to pre
-1 elude the supposition that a bright, well
defined picture can ever be obtained in
! this way. Certainly, the reproductions of
: the views already obtained are very shad
\ owy and lacking in detail. If they were
offered as ordinary photographs they
would De rejected at once as unsatisfac
tory.
A new principle in nature has been dis
i covered, and it may lead to revelations of
which there is as yet no expectation or
even suspicion, but it is best not to count
; upon it too strongly at first, and to let the
scientists work out its problems before
calculating too closely upon its adaptations
to the various branches of science.âPhila
delphia Ledger.
A BATTLE-FIELD LAMP.
A new lamp, the invention of Ludwig
| Durr of Bremen, is being tried by the Eng
lish military authorities. The light is
originated by evaporation and superheat
ing of the vapors from ordinary petroleum.
Air is drawn into the lamp between the
gasifier and an external cylinder, and a
smokeless flame of great brilliance is pro
duced. In short, vapors are produced by
intense heat and converted into gas, which
upon being burned yields a light ranging
from 3500 to 14,000 candle-rower. The ap
paratus is self-acting and does not necessi
tate the employment of compressed air.
It is so constructed that a lamp and reser
: voir capable of holding ten liters of pe
troleum, and supplying a 3500 candle-
I power light, can be strapped on thÂ£ knap
sack of a soldier. The lamps can be car
ried about when burning, or may be fixed
in any position.
A NEW PAPER-CUTTER.

operates on the same principle as the laree
paper-cutters used by binders and station
ers, but it is much more simple, and it
should be for home purposes.
It consists of a board marked with a
scale of inches and pfovided with a steel
edgepiece, asainst which the knife de
scends. The paper, or engraving, to be
trimmed is laid on the board, and the part
to be removed is allowed to project over

down the paper is cut away.
SOME CURIOUS TOPS.
I am in the habit of bringing home from
my travels a few playthings, which, put
away in a drawer, afford pleasure to" my
little nephews. Being desirous one day
of getting a little order into this collection,
I found therein a number and variety of
tops that surprised me, and I set them
aside. The idea occurred to me to ex
amine them in detail and to compare
them, and, in doing so, I was struck no
less by the ingenuity of the manufact
urers in introducing an element of novelty
into a plaything so ancient and so simple
in its primitive form than by the scientific
iaterest of certain of the combinations
realized.
I have adhered to the strict definition of
the top, that is, a revolving body held in
equilibrium upon its vertical axis through
the rotary motion that is given it, and
have thus had to exclude several very
curious playthings, and especially the "air
turbine" and the "magic box," as well as
various others in which the object set in
revolution is not a top, properly so called,
but a flywheel whose axis is held by sup
ports.
I have divided my tops into two great
classes ;
I. Those which revolve, aÂ£ I may say,
simply in order to revolve, or, in" other
â¢ words, tnose in which one has had in view
merely the rotary motion and the momen
tary equilibrium resulting therefrom. I
have divided them into different categories
according to the way in which the rotary
motion is given them.
11. Those in which the rotary motion is
applied in order to produce another effect
optical, acoustic, mechanical or otherwise.
In the case of simple tops, I place the fol
lowing:
1. Tops eet in motion by hand. This
category comprises the teetotums. I have,
in the first place, the ordinary teetotum,
set in revolution through the upper part of
the axis. That of Fig. 1 has the preten
sion, I think, to represent a dancing dervish
with arms swinging. The "top" teetotum
(Fig. 2) differs from the preceding, in that
the fingers grasp it by the point. The
"domino" or "die" teetotum (Fig. 3) may
be used for different plays. The "centrifu-
I gal" teetotum (fig. 4) and the "cyclone"
teetotum end the list of these form's of the
top.
'1. Whiptopsâ l know of but two char
acteristic types of these â the common one*
(Fig. 6), wnose conical form is one of the
oldest known, and the "mushroom"
(Fig. 7).
3. Pegtopsâ These are the tops of col
lections, the "short point" top (Fig. 8), the
"long point" top (Fig. 9), and the "flat"
top (Fig. 10). Fig. n shows a variant of
Fie;. 8. The cord, instead of beine free,
remains fixed to the top, while at the same
time allowing it to spin.
These varieties do not differ in form
only, but are thrown differently. The
short point top ia held in the hand, the
point downward and the forefinger resting
upon the stem, and is thrown by a down
ward motion of the arm; the long point
top is i held- in verted, the point in the air,
and in throwing it the arm describes a
semicircle from back to front, like the
hammer of the blacksmith. The flat top
is held with the arm lowered and is thrown
with a horizontal motion, analogous to
that of the ricochet, in drawing the cord
toward the body.
4. Humming Topsâ ln this category the
retary motion is ; iven by the cord, drawn
rapidly with one hand, while the top is
held in place. The "Dutch" top is held
in a handle provided with an aperture,
with which either engages the upper part
of the prolonged axis (Fig. Yd) or its point
(Fig. 14), and from which it is disengaged
after it has been set in action by the cord.
A top of an analogous system (Fig. 15)
but of metal and provided with a movable
cover, is sold as a sugar-plum box.
In other systems the bearing paint is
taken upon the top itself, or else the top
around which the cord is wound and its
axis are interdependent. The "Eiffel
tower" top (Fig. 16) belongs to the first
type. The penny top of the shops (Fig.
17) and many other analogous ones have
axis independent. To this second type be
longs also the "acrobat" top (Fig. 18).
In the "Protean" top (Fig. 19) the
glass cone that forms the top is held at
the moment at which the cord is drawn
by a movable axis independent of it.
Finally, in the "gyroscope" top (Fig.
20) the rotary motion is given to the
interior flywheel in holding the external
ring in hand.
5. Tops of Various Systemsâ The top
having a to-and-fro motion (Fig. 21) is
very ingenious. With one hand is held
the small frame beneath, in which the
axis turns freely, and with the other the
cord whose extremity is fixed to the axis,
and alternating rotary motions are tnen
given the top. After the top has been set
spinning it ia left to itself, when the cord
winds up in the little cage and the top re
volves freely.
The "Flora" top (Fig. 22) is likewise set
in motion in a peculiar way. Itis mounted
upon a screw thread and takes on the mo
tion of the upper axis, which revolves in a
curved pipce held in the hand. , After the
cord is unwound the axis is arrested, and
the top unscrews and continues to spin.
The petals of the fanciful flower that it
represents open under the action of cen
trifugal force, the flower expands and then 1
gradually closes under the action of small
springs when the motion begins to slacken.
I have two air tops, one of which, called
"JBolian," is shown in Fig. 23 and the
other in Fig. 24.
The spring top (Fig. 25) merits special
mention on account of the simplicity of its
operation. It is too well known to'need a
description. In a variant of it (Fig. 26)
the spring is applied beneath at the lower
part of the axis that serves as a bearing
point for the top. This latter is nothing
more than a ring provided with four
wings. When the spring is freed, the top
CURIOUS TOPS.
rises slightly in the air, and then falls
back to the- ground and continues its revo
lutions. In another variant (Fig. 27) the
spring is also beneath, but forms part of a
support upon which the top is capable of
continuing to revolve. I have also a spring
top (Fig. 28) that is very well balanced and
spins for a long time. The helix has like
wise been applied to the setting of tops in
motion. The "Archimedes" top (Fig. 29)
is a simple disk provided with a point. A
traveler forces jt to descend along the helix,
from which it escapes in "revolving. In
another top, called the "Alternative," the
motion is inverse, and it is the helix that
is displaced vertically (Fig. 30).
In the class of compound tops are the
following:
1. Acoustic Topsâ Among the tops that
I have arranged in the first class, all those
that are hollow produce more or less
acoustic effects. They whistle, sine or
hum under the action of the air in the
apertures with which they are provided.
In the wooden pegtop (Fig. 31), a
variant of No. 2, tne play of reeds is at the
upper part, and the "spinning of the top
produces a draft of air through properly
arranged apertures. The same is the case
in top 32, the cheap model of the shops.
The play of feeds is here in the interior.
In model 33 the axis is independent
of the body of the top. It carries a fly
wheel which is provided with wings, and
that revolves in the bell-sbaped portion.
The "harmonic" or "choral" top (Fig.
34) produces changing tones. The prin
ciple of model 35 is different. The axis
terminates in a sort of claw that renders
it immovable, and a revolution of the top
is established upon the axis that remains
fixed. The latter carries a tongue that
strikes a play of reeds carried by the top,
and the result is an air analogous to that
of the music rattles sold under the name
of "rivoltellas."
â¢ 2. Optical Tops â I mention in the first
place the "spectral" too (Fig. 36) serving
as an advertisement to Pear's soap. It is a
simple cardboard disk carrying lines fig
ured in black upon a white ground. When
set in a motion in a good light, the concen
tric circles assume the colors of the spec
trum, and the order of which is reversed
according to the direction of revolution.
The "chameleon" top (Fig. 37) was one of
the first to popularize the effects of the
Helmholtz colored disks. It is a spring
top. The top shown in Fig. 38 is what is
called the "dazzling" top. What" is called
the "enchanting" top (Fig. 39) lends itself
to various optical experiments. The point
revolves on a support, and, thanks to this
arrangement, the rotary motion and
equilibrium persist for a long time.
3. Tops Producing Magnetic Effectsâ
The "induction" top (Fig. 40) has already
been described in these pages, as has also
the "magneto-electric" one (Fig. 41). The
"Sultan" top (Pig. 42) is a sraaii one with
a very light spring. After it has been set
spinning there is placed near the axis a
magnetized bar to the rounded end of
which it adheres and continues its revolu
tion while suspended in the air.
4. Tops Producing Dynamic Effectsâ
The "hydraulic" or "water-jet" top is
shown in Fig. 43, and the "screw-spin
ning" top in Fig. 44. The "puppet" top
(Fig. 45) consists of a disk set in revolution
upon a pivot by means of a movable handle
and a cord. Above is suspended a jointed
puppet made of cardboard. The project
ing radii of the disk strike the feet of the
figure and cause it to dance a sort of jig.
Fig. 46 represents tbe "carrousel" top. A
small table carries the carrousel, upon the
axis of which there is a disk provided with
bristles. The top being in its equilibrium
of revolution the carrousel is placed near
it, when the circular brush rubs against
the striated conical portion of the top, and
the carrousel enters into a rapid motion to
the musical sound of the top, which is pro
vided with a play of reeds.
5. Various Topsâ The "Byrograph" top
(Fig. 47) consists of a metallic disk'of some
little weight elevated upon qnite a long
point formed of a sharpened lead pencil.
The top is spun upon a sheet of paper and,
as it is difficult for it to assume a vertical
equilibrium, the pencil point draws spirals
upon the paper that may be varied by in
terfering with the top's motion. '
The "stork," also called the "para
chute," top (Fig. 48) is formed of a series
of cones that set into one another. When
the upper one. is removed, after haying
once been set spinning, the little cones of
various colors separate and revolve
around it.
Next come various dancing tops, such as
the "waltzer" (Fig. 60) and the "dancer"
(Fig. 49). The waltzer shown in Fig. 51
is very graceful and of a pleasing effect.
The motion is given with a single revolu
tion of the cord upon the part forming a
hollow pulley at the foot, and is trans
mitted to an'internal flywheel. The body
of the dancer is carried along through the
impulsion, and every ticae that the roller
under the second foot touches the ground

LAST OF THE RUNNING FOOTMEN.
Sam Cliffe, who claimed to be the sole
survivor of the race of running footmen, was
interred this week in the City of London
Cemetery in the presence of nfty-four of
his descendants. Born near Shrewsbury
on November 10, 1803, he rerained his fac
ulties up to the' last, wlaen sudden aenile
collapse terminated his existence. As a
boy he was accustomed to act as gate
opener for the Shropshire pack, and attract
ing attention of the riders with those
hounds by his knowledge of the country
and his powers of endurance, he soon ob
tained more lucrative employment, and
for years was employed in the old posting
days to secure relays, numbering among
his patrons Squire "Jack" Mytton and
Corbett, the Earls of Wilton and Balcar
res, the Marquis of Queensbury (old Q.),
and later the Marquia of Waterford and
his set, of whose mad freaks he was never
tired of telling. His general run was sixty
miles a day. On all the great roads from
the north to the metropolis he was a well
known figure, and his supplies en route
were furnished without demur, and the
cost charged to his patrons. Up to the
last he was in receipt of a pension of Â£1 a
week. He aied on Monday at the resi
dence of his great-granddaughter at Forest
Gate. â Westminster. Gazette.
WEIGHT OF A HUMAN BRAIN.
"Some interesting facts," says Dr. D. G.
Brinton in Science, "were developed by
Professor Ranke at the last meeting of the
German Anthropological Society, in rela
tion to the relative weights of the brain
and spinal cord in man. It is well known
that man ha 3 not the heaviest brain of any
animal; the whale and the elephant have
heavier. Nor has he the heaviest in pro
portion to his weight; some smging-birds,
various small apes and the mole have pro
portionately^ heavier brains. What Ranke
brings out is that the weight of the hu
man brain 13 greater in proportion to the
weight of the spinal cord than in any
other vertebrate ; and this, therefore, con
stitutes an anatomical distinction of man,
strongly contrasting him with all other
animal forms."
A PUMICE-STONE LIFEBOAT.
In England trials have been made with
a lifeboat made of pumice-stone, which a
report, made by the Lighthouse Board,
states to be most satisfactory. Not only is
the material of great lightness ana
strength, but it is easily worked into any
shape. The boat remains afloat and will
support quite a load even when full of
water. The parts are made interchange
able, and when a part is injured the
simple loosening of a bolt enables the re
pairer to remove it and put in another.
A BIG LIFE BELT.
The ever-present dangers of the sea
dangers illustrated almost daily by ac
counts of collision, fire or other disaster,
so often attended with loss of life â have
prompted the invention of many more or
less ingenious life-saving devices. One of
the simplest, ani yet most valuable, is
that lately introduced by William Brandt,
a sailmaker, at Lubeck, Germany.
Substantially it is a reproduction, on a
very large scale, of the hfe-saving belts or
rings commonly found aboard ships. But
besides ita greater carrying capacity it pre
sents some novel and sensible features
which enhance its value.
Numerous partitions divide the belt into
water-tight compartments, so that dam
age to any part does not materially affect
Lifebelt Holding Many Persons,
thÂ£ efficiency of the whole. The great
elasticity of the belt reduces the danger to
a minimum. Despite its great size it is
very light. One man can easily roll it
along the deck and fling it overboard. It
I does not matter how it strikes the waterâ
iit invariably turns right tide up. Tne
middle space is taken up by a strong net
work.
An important addition is that of ropes
made fast to the periphery of the belt, and
kept afloat by corks, so that persons sev
eral yards away from the buoy can draw
themselves to it. Seven large men stand-
I ing on it do not appreciably sink the device,
and when it is considered how small the
weight of a person partially supported by
the water is it will be seen that one belt
can save a large number of people. â New

AN ELECTRIC KIFLE,
The practice of firing big guns by elec
tricity is already well established, but
hitherto no practical attempt has been
made to explode the shells of small arms
electrically. An electric rifle has recently
been designed by J. F. Blake of New
Haven, Conn., in which it is sought to
carry out this principle. The source" cf
the current is a battery, A, which is fitted
into the stock either from the side or from
the ends. The noles, 88, are connected
to springs, C C, Irom which the wires, D D,
run respectively to a spring, M, bolted at I
to the lockplate, and to the insulated ham
mer, H, fixed on the upper part of the
trigger, G. Qis the shell containing an in
eulated pin, the head of which, O, projects
beyond the base of the shell. If necessary,
two pins can be placed parallel with each
other and insulated until their points

cartridge and a hammer is a pin. X,
encircled by a spring and riveted into
a crossplate, J, at one end, the
other end being fitted into an insulated
thimble, L, the point of which nearly
touches the shell pin-head, O. When the
cartridge has been inserted and the gun
closed, the spring, M, rests on the metal
base of the cartridge.
As the trigger is pulled, the hammer
strikes the plate, J, forcing the point of
the thimble, L, into the point of the pro
jecting end, O, of the cartridge-pin. An
arc is established at P O, which explodes
the contents of the cartridge.
The point of the firing pin, P, can be
placed anywhere within the explosive
powder of the cartridge, but by extending
it near the bullet, as shown in the illustra
tion, a more effective explosion of the
powder is secured.â Electrical Engineer.
A TOUCH REGISTER.
In playing the piano, after a certain skill
has been attained, it becomes very difficult
for the master to distinguish the inequali
ties of touch on the part of his pupil, and
hence MM. Binet and Courtier have in-
The Touch Register.
vented an apparatus for recording them,
which we illustrate in Fig. 1. It con
sists essentially of an indiarubber tube,
T, which runs beneath the keys and com
municates with a drum, D, so that when a
key presses on the tube a pulse of air
causes the drum to expand, and make the
pencil, P, draw a corresponding pulse, or
wave, on a ribbon of traveling paper, R.
The play of the keys is thus recorded
on the paper, and can be studied at the
time or subsequently without any inter
ference with the player, who is not em
barrassed by the tube. The apparatus
can be applied to any piano without alter
ing its external appearance, and in the
record shows the faults of the player.
Although these are inappreciable to the
ear, it is of great service in teaching. The
inventors also claim that a register of this
kind will enable composers to indicate
slight changes in the time which cannot
be marked on written music. Another
invention, which may be useful to musi
cians who possess a talent for improvisa
tion, is the music recorder of M. Rivoire,
which we illustrate in Fig. 2.
It is entirely mechanical in its action,
the keys when played working a system of
levers which press marking wheels against
the traveling band of paper, P, shown be
neath the keyboard, and mark it with hor
izontal lines corresponding to the notes.
A little practice is sufficient to enable the
musician to read these marks like ordinary
music. The device does not interfere with
the player, but allows him to be carried
away by the inspiration of the moment. â

ance as if he were exerting all his cunning
to keep the cap there, balancing himself as
well as the cap with very clever motions,
horses move, little dogs dance, and all
these motions are reproduced so true to
nature that considerable amusement is de
rived for little as well as big children.
A DOUBLE LOCOMOTIVE.
The locomotive shown In the illustration
on this page is probably the largest and
i heaviest of all the engines of this kind. It
| was designed for the Mexican Central
j Railroad by its chief engineer, F. W. John-
I ston, with special regard to the conditions
'of the road and the traffic thereon. This
engine is to be used for the propulsion of
freight trains between Tampico and the
City of Mexico, which is the most difficult
i section of the road on account of its steep
grades and its many curves of short radius.
The locomotive is double in all its parts,
except the locomotive cab: one single stiff
frame carries the two boilers .and driving
mechanisms, each machine resting on
three axles, which are placed close to
gether. The total weight of the engine
is 260,000 pounds. In order to enable
this colossal engine to run over com
paratively short curves the driving
wheels of the trucks carrying the fore and
rear parts of the locomotive are arranged
to accommodate themselves to the curves,
la spite of its great length this engine can
therefore go around curves of a much
shorter diameter than an ordinary single
engine. The mechanical arrangement of
the driving wheels was, however, a matter
of considerable difficulty. The crank
shafts of these driving wheels were pro
vided with universal ball joints near the
cylinder heads, so that, when the driving
wheel assumes an angle other than ninety
degrees in reference to the frame, the
crank shafts connecting with the cylin
der heads and the driving wheels could
follow the movement of the wheel with
out injury to the engine. An exact de
scription of the detail of this construc
tion is impossible without special designs
which are too technical for ordinary read
ers. The engine is one of the compound
system, the steam, expanding consecu
tively in two cylinders. The high-pres
sure cylinder has a diameter of 13 inches,
the low-presaure cylinder of 24 inches;
the steam pressure averages 12 one-half
atmospheres. The boilers are of steel and
have a diameter of 4 feet 6 inches, each
one bei.ng provided with 201 steam tubes
15 feet long. The engineer controls both
engines with one lever, but it will remain
for the future to show whether this style
of locomotive is all that is claimed for it
in practical use.
SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.
In some experiments reported as having
been made abroad lately on the self
ignition of cotton waste, a few facts of
special interest to textile manufacturers
were developed. A handful of cotton
waste was dipped into linseed oil, squeezed
out, placed in a wooden box and the tem
perature observed closely by means of a
thermometer introduced into the box.
The temperature surrounding the box was
Kept at 70 degrees Centigrade, and in a
snort time after the temperature in the
box was found to have risen to the height
of 173 degrees, and smoke issued there
from ; then, when opened so as to admit
air, a flame burst out at once, while a box
from which the air was perfectly excluded!
consumed after five or six hours. In an
other experiment, in which the. cotton
waste was saturated with rapeseed oil, the
box burned after ten hours. With an
outer temperature of 56 degrees Centi
grade, gallipoli oil caused the spontaneous
combustion of cotton wrapped in paper
castor oil required twenty-four hours

THE LATEST FASHION GOSSIP FOR WOMEN AND MEN
THE last week has been wildly gay,
and among the most enjoyable
affairs were the weddings at St.
Luke's, the informal Presidio hop,
the delightful private dance for
young people, given at that most hos
pitable home on one of the corners of
Laguna and California streets, and the
very enjoyable euchre party Friday even
ing on Washington street, near Franklin.
The coming days, preceding Ash Wednes
day, will be more than full of engage
ments of a most delightful character; in
deed, many are wishing that there were
more than seven days in a week. It is
really a pity that so much is always
crowded into the last of the season. If
people would only entertain more inform
ally there would not be many complaints
about dullness, though indeed this
season's debutantes have had a gay winter,
for numerous have been the' quiet
luncheons, dinners and teas, which have
been far more appreciated than the great
crushes. Not many years ago the buds
were supposed' to care for nothing but
dancing and lunch parties, now not a few
of even the youngest of them confess
that they like dinner parties quite
as well. As a result I have heard
of several dinners given exclusively to
young people, at which several of the
belles and beaux proved themselves clever,
in tact, almost brilliant, conversationists.
Borne writers maintain that conversa
tion is oecoming a lost art, and that most
people indulge in monologues if they exert
themselves at all. Tbis is a bad state of
affairs, for every one appreciates a bright
man or woman, and the brilliant story
teller's name heads many a dinner list.
Great has been my surprise on more tban
one occasion on being expected to listen to
long dissertations concerning the children's
illnesses, their mischievous tendencies and
the inferiority of servants by hostesses
who, owing to many advantages, should
be brilliant women intellectually. How
ever, all sorts and kinds of people enter
into the composition of w! at is known as
society, but those who have the ability
should endeavor to make themselves
agreeable to entertaining on all occasions.
Now and then one hears of a case where
some one tries to appear witty at the ex
pense of a guest who is either presumably
too dull to comprehend the allusions or
too well-bred to resent them publicly. Such
persons should be tabooed socially until
they can obtain at least the necessary
veneer.
The first benefit concert o the Saturday
Morning Orchestra will take place on the
17th inst., and it promises to be a social
success, as it will be under the patronage
of several of our most prominent citizens.
Many predict that the Mardi Gras ball
will be poorly attended by dancing men,
as by the time a ticket is purchased and the
carriage and flowers paid for there Is not
much left of %'JO, and nowadays even such
email sums are worthy of consideration.
The favors at the recent cotillon remind
one of some favors lately given East which
were unique, consisting of "curb-chain"
bracelets, odd silver perfume bottles, sil
ver-embossed cigar- boxes, water-color
drawings, dolls (richly attired in national
costumes), cycling hose and golf caps.
It is needless to say that our society
women are on most occasions beautifully
gowned, and for the moment dinner and
dancing gowns are being principally dis
cussed, as at this date no one is having
visiting gowns made up, for all too soon,
must begin the preparation for spring and
Bummer. "Indeed, the seasons fly past
with alarming rapidity.
Most women will welcome with delight
the news that the predicted diminution in
the width of our skirts is now an estab
lished fact, and at the present moment a
skirt five yards wide is the limit of good
taste in Paris many not exceeding four,
and all cores are cut on the straight
of the material, after Doucet's beautiful
model. Now the line is straight and trim,
the folds stand "heel to heel, as it were."
Our friends who belong to rhe smart set
East have been paying their calls and
going to comintr-out teas in gowns of
white face cloth tine as satin.
Let me describe a model gown of this
fabric. The skirt has five godets and has
a lace jet design worked on the bottom.
The lining is of yellow silk with a ripplins
stripe of white r.atin. A corded ruffle com
pletes it. The bodice is seamless and
round, of white cloth, slk-htly blouse, and
girded with white satin ribbon fastened by
two huge Strass ornamentsâ a copy of old
buttons, I dare say. From the" collar
band in front fall two white cloth tabs,
appliqued in yellow velvet, a wonderfully
pretty design touched up here and there
with fine jet. The ends are scalloped
with jet and the sides are trimmed
with narrow sable. They hang to within
an inch or two of the brilliant girdle
clasps. White cloth gigot sleeves ap
pliqued in velvet to match, but in design
quite different, with a jet finish on the
velvet edges. The wrists are bordered
with sable and the ensemble is a modern
ized Venetian bodice and most charming."
A yellow velvet rolling collar with tufts of
yellow lac- under the ears and a white
satin ribbon tying in a frisky bow in
back completes an exceedingly chic and
most extravagant costume, which, of
course, can only be worn in one's own
perfectly appointed carriage. 1 have no
expectation of seeing any such costumes
here, but I quoted the elaborated descrip
tion as it abounds in good suggestions.
A ball gown of rare charm is thus de
scribed: "It was of red satin, geranium
redâ a beautiful evening color. The skirt
a Doucet, perfectly plain, lined with red
taffeta glace. Red will not stand a skiit
lining in contrast. It was draped with
tulle matching exactly, but very scantily
draped as la mode directs, and finished at
the bottom by a full tulle ruching. The
decollete bodice was slightly pointed,
tight fitting, with bias flouts and laced in
the back. The decolletage was finished by
an empire bertha of tulle, which consists
of several folds of tulle in several thick
nesses draped across the bust and caught
up in the center. Very short sleeves with
tulle wings, small affairs, wired, and
bunches of red poppies and foliage fastened
to the shoulders."
Doubtless this winter will see the last of
the pretty Louis XV and XVI jackets, as
they have become too numerous to be any
longer considered chic. For instance, at a
large tea given two weeks ago I saw a black
velvet jacket with a white satin front
covered with Brussels net. Thenl noticed
one of light gray brocade with largerhine
stone buttons. Next one of rich green
brocade edged with mink, Having a vest of
heavy white silk, over which was laid line
lace. A belt of gold passementerie held it
at the waist line. The lining was of white
silk. The effect was excellent, but that
style is too much in voeue to continue
lone
Washington is most delightful at this
season and many are the beautiful toil
ets worn by our representative women
there. About the middle of last month the
wife of Senator Sherman gave a large re
ception, on which occasion she wore a
superb gown of white satin brocade,
trimmed with rare o!d point lace. Mrs.
Sherman was assisted in receiving by her
daughter and several of Her nieces. Mrs.

When Mrs. Morton received she selected I

Miss Quay was marriel in Washington re-
cently and her gown w. #;s remarked for its
rare richness and simplicity. The bride
is a slender and stylish brunette.
Mrs. Cobb,wifeof the Congressman from i
St. Louis, is considered to be one of the |
handsomest women in Washington, so her I
costumes are frequently described at
length. One of her Paquin costumes is of
pinK satin, the skirt as usual very full. The
decollete bodice is beautifully trimmed
with creamy lace, black velvet and black
silk poppies. The front of the bodice has a
single plait and lace finishes the decollete
effect. A large bow of satin ribbon at the
left of the waist line held a gracehil cluster t
of the poppies, and a bow effect finished I
the Dodice in the back. Full puffs of satin j
form the elbow sleeves. Miss Cobb wore
a dress of deep cream satin, the bodice be-
ing draped with accordion pleated chif-
fon.
Mrs. August Belmont, who has been
seen seldom this winter, appeared at the
Oeden Mills cotillon and looked positively
beautiful in a marvelous gown of pink
miroir velvet. Speaking of Mrs. Belmont j
â¢reminds me that some one recently asked
her why she intended to marry Mr. Bel-
mout. . She is reported to have replied:
"I wish to be superior to the Vanderbilts.
Mrs. Belmont led New York society long
before a Vanderbilt was heard of, and I
shall be Mrs. Belmont."
Major Cootes bride (nee Gartside) was
seen lately in a calling costume of green
velvet, made with a shirt coa; anda waist-
coat of white and silver brocade. The coat
was edged with sable. Her hat was of the
green velvet, with a soft crown. Three
feathers dropped over the brim on each
side of the front.
A correspondent, in writing from Paris,
notes a superb muff, large in size, of silver
fox, which is a change from the hundreds
of sable ones to be seen daily. This writer
speaks of Mrs. Rollason, who is a demi- j
blonde, with an unusually perfect figure, j
She attracted attention by one of her
gowns. It was of a bluish gray cloth
with diagonal lines in black coming to the
surface all over it. The skirt had not a
bit of fullness about the hips, but fell
in ripples at the back and sides,
With it was worn a large flare
cape, with an overlying cape of black
lynx. This tapered to a point at the waist
line and ended in two boas like ends, which
were tied carelessly. There was a neck j
band of the same fur and the foot and j
waist bands matched. This fur on the j
front of the cape left a narrow wedge- j

quoise velvet. The hat designed for this
toilet was a reminder of Napoleonic mod
els, and was of a wonderfully becoming
shape, covered with black velvet. Some
jet of a bluish cast was drawn closely
under the puffy crown.
In Paris a pretty Countess this season
was more than usually attractive in pink
velvet, wnich opened in front over an
apron and stomacher of white satin, em
broidered in pearls and silver. The edges
were bordered with the most delicate of
silver lace. The sides of the skirt formed
deep-fluted folds, which were also seen in
the back, as the lower edges described
deep ripples. The large collar was of
chenille-embroidered velvet, and the bal
loon sleeves of pointed velvet, in shades of
changeable green and pink. White gloves
were worn.
I have just ascertained that the mag
nificent visiting toilette I so recently de
scribed, composed of royal blue velvet and
ermine, is one of the gowns in the trousseau
of Mrs. William Gibson (formerly Mile, de
Montbrisson), who was married last month
in Paris. She is a wonderfully handsome
woman, who always dresses perfectly.
Taffeta is being much used at present, as
the best quality, has a mostly lovely
sheen, and its claims were fully demon
strated at a large ball, on which occasion
a beautiful matron wore a dres3 of white
taffeta, with sleeves of white embroidered
chiffon de soie. The sleeves fell off the
shoulders, the bands over the shoulders
being trimmed with geraniums; clusters
of geraniums were also used for garniture
around the corsage, and among the frills
of chiffon (ie soie down each side. Re
vers of geranium velvet, embroidered
in seed pearls, with narrow velvet in front
to match, completed an admirable cos
tume. Although fur has been so exten
sively used this season as a trimming, the
report comes from the East that owing to
the mild weather many furriers will be
totally ruined. A cold" spell before- the
holidays might have saved many, so o*hr
Atlantic sisters and cousins will shortly
lave the opportunity of purchasing many
costly garments at remarkable figures.
Two pretty girls here have the hand
soniest ermine capes in the City. They
are composed entirely of this costly fur,
and are large and fiarine, reaching below
the waist line. They arc"lined with white
satin, which reminds me that when Â«o
many were having black velvet capes lined
with white satin it was considered an ex
travagance; but I find that whenever the
wearer has exercised moderate care and
the satin has been ot the best quality it
looks almost as fresh as ever.
Among the illustrations to-day is one of
a stylish evening gown of shot moire, cut
en princess, the upper part of the bodice
and sleeves being of yellow satin covered
with pink accordion-pleated chiffon; puff
ings of yellow satin ribbon finished the
sleeves and neck, which is cut below the
shoulders, and attached by a thread of
colored stones and pearls forming a boSv.
The skirt has a long train, which is beauti
fully jeweled to match the bodice,
The evening blouse is composed of a
fancy cream-white silk, covered with dots,
Rows of yellow lace extend down the
front and also ornament the large puffed
sleeves. It is trimmed with an exquisite
shade of phlox satin ribbon, the effect of
which is dainty.
The teagown is a charming affair of
batiste and insertion over rose taffeta.
The collar is large and full, and edeed
with lace. The ample sleeves are elbow
length, and the choux and girdle are of
rose.velvet.
The great bow between the ends of
which the young girl is looking is com
posed of pale-blue tulle, edged with lace,
I have just heard that Mrs. Cleveland's
latest evening gown has caused many corn
plimentary remarks, as it is an exceed
liicly handsome toilet of white velvet de
collete, with ornamentations of silver and
diamonds. Mrs. Cleveland owns many
beautiful and valuable jewels, but has not
yet indulged herself with one of the fash
ionable tiaras.
Mrs. Jack Gardner of Boston lately wore
a tiara branched out like horns. The
effect is described as "very bizarre," and
her evening bodices are said to be "creep
ingly low cut as usual." It is all very well
for a woman to be proud of having her
wonderful jewels commented on, and that
should satisfy Mrs. Jack, who shows ex
cellent taste in the selection of labrics, as
at a large reception lately given she wore
a gown of rose-pink, Oriental-looking
gauze, doubtless picked up somewhere in
her Eastern travels, with gold embroidery,
Last week I spoke of the touch of black
which would be in evidence in all spring
and summer garments, and a few days ago
had my prediction partially verified as
one window of a fashionable store had a
large display of shirt waists, blue with
edgings of black on the ruffle down the
front, on the turn-down collar and on the
cuffs. Yellow, pink and ecru waists were
treated in the same way, and I have no
hesitancy in saying that I thought the ef
feet very ugly indeed; in fact, the sulphur
yellow waists with black were simply
hideous. However, I was assured that
when I became accustomed to them I
would be filled with admiration; but if it
is true that "a thing of beauty is a joy
forever, â  how about those yellow waista?
The new importations of Swiss muslins
and organdies are exceedingly attractive,
and I do like an organdy I saw in a Post
street store. Through this particular one
ran a narrow black stripe. It was snowy
white, covered with delicate clusters of
flowers, and the black gave it a chic effect.
These fabrics are very reasonable, and
eirls with stylish figures can have num
bers of them made at home during Lent at
small cost.

Simple sleeves are being much talked [
about, but three model waists just received '
from Paris by a large New York house

and be.low they curve out in three hollow ;

their stiffness holds (hem in shape. Each
curve is very effectively rilled with a single
large blossom, a mammoth rose or poppy j
on black tulle sleeves or on those of black
Brussels net, while orchids are on whiie j
sleeves. These sleeves are mounted on '
s-atin and their intricacies baffle descrip

mure simply made, are worr. with white'
satin gowns. Some of these are trans par* I
ent, showing the arm through, while others
have a satin lining the color of the tulle.
The popular designs in Persian printed
velvets reappear for spring, the figure be

For lounge suits browns and grays are
most in vogue, and should be worn with
ties having a blue or red tone.
The long frock coats are much worn this
winter in New York.
A correspondent of Vogue states that
he can only afford one new suit at present,
and desires advice, as he wishes to wear it
to church, theaters and entertainments,
and also asks for information concerning
the style of bat, collars, cuffs, ties and shoes
he should wear with snch a suit. I quote
the reply, as it is exceedingly sensible:
"A dark gray worsted would answer your
purpose best. Do not have the tails of the
cutaway come lower than the back of the
knee â the tails should not be pointed.
The coat should be cut away rather
sharply in front, and finished with two
buttons on each sleeve. The trousers
should be 19>Â£ inches at the knee and IS}4
at the instep. Waistcoat single-breasted
and cut high, six buttons. A top hat
should De worn with this suit, but a pot
hat is permissible; a high choicer collar,
overlapping in front ; square-cornered cuffs,
a narrow four-in-hand tie of any dark
color, and patent leathers, buttoned, com
plete the ensemble. A waistcoat, double
breasted, of buff or gray duck, goes very
well with the above."
A white dress waistcoat can be worn
with a dress suit on many occasions, but
discrimination must be used. For the
opera, formal dinners and balls it is per
fectly suitable.
Men can have their address on either of
the lower corners of their visiting cards,
but the right is preferred.
De .Toinville scarfs are never lined, the
nand being made of handsome silk, which
is carefully fitted to the neck before being
made up. As a critical observer says: "A
scarf that is to be tied must fit the collar
properly or the knot will be forced into a
position that does not permit of the effect
it was intended tc obtain. Each scarf of
the tieable kind has its understudy in the
made-up class. There is the Teck

HOME WITHOUT SLIPPERS.
[ An Incident That Drove m Boiton Mm
to the Club.
He had taken off his boots and wai
down on bis hands and knees in the room
searching for something, when his' wife
noticed him.
"What are you looking for, William f â¢
she asked.
"My slippers," he replied.
"Oh, I gave those old things away to*
day,' 1 she said.
"You gave them away!" he repeated,
and then he added solemnly: "Mrs.
Miffler, are you trying to drive me away
from home?"
"Of course not. I "
"What is home without slippers?" he
interrupted. "What is an evening at home
with heavy boots on your feet? Mrs.
Miffler. what do you think constitutes
home?"
â â  V.'hy. you can get another pair," she
protested.
"Of course I can," he exclaimed. "I can
get a new pair of stiff-soled slippers and
spend thirty days breaking them in."
"The others were torn, and "
"That's wh,y I liked them! They were
comfortable. When 1 got them on things
seemed homelike. I was settled for the
evening, and a four-horse team could not
get me out again. But nowâ now I ara
ready for the club or theater, or any old
place. Slippers, Mrs. Miffler, help me to
make the difference between the home and
the office, and old slippers make the differ
ence greatest."
"I can't see why "
"Of course you can't. No woman ever
can; but I tell you, if I were running
things I'd make every woman take a course
in slippers. That's what is needed more
than suffrage or anything else in that line.
Just slippers â nothing but slippers."
He got up, stamped around thrÂ» room tn
his stockinged feet for a minute or two,
and then put on .his boots again.
"This isn't home," he said, bitterly. "It
isn't a bit like it. I'm going to the club."â

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Xxx.', Feb. B.â Not much aggressive
actlou by either bulls or bears . in wheat was noted
to-day. It was evident from the coarse of prices
that "shorts" were inclined to cover up for the
week, but there was no i a vestment to speak of.
Liverpool cables were a disappointment to those
who believe in higher prices, quotations at that
place showing no gain. After the weakness which
resulted from this cause had about spent Itself, a
re jo very took place, but the range of values was
below he opening figures of yesterday. "Export
clearances for the week were fair at 2,907,000
bushels against 2,555.000 bushels last week. Re
ceipts in the Northwest, were large at 541 cars
against 4SO last Saturday and 179 a year age.
Chicago received 126 cars and* inspected out 61),
--390 bushels. Atlantic 'seaboard clearances
amounted to 276.720 ousbels. Closing Antwerp

last hour, the close being At almost the Inside. May

CORNâ Steady values ruled In ' corn to-day, but
trading was at a minimum. ; Sustaining power was
communicated by large exports for the week,
3,200,000 bushels. Receipts to-day were '245
cars, and 248.280 bushels were taken from store.
Liverpool cables were dull. Atlantic seaboard

dull market, the fact that it was .Saturday adding
to the aversion to trade. The tone and feeling
came from corn and wheat. Receipts were 191

transpired in the provision market. Steady prices
were the order of the day, although at the opening
the sentimeut was not very strong owing to a de
cline of 5c in bogs. he final weakness of grain
was influential in causing a decline in product.
At the close ' May pork was 6c under yesterday,

COLONEL JOHN F. FINERTY
Irish Citizens Making Extensive
Preparations for His
Reception.
BRIGHT NEWSPAPER CAREER.
Journalist, Orator and Nationalist, He
Stands First Among His Com
patriots.
John F. Finerty of Chicago, who comes
to San Francisco to lecture under the au
spices of the Irish National Alliance of
America, is to-day one of the most pic
turesque Irishmen in the United States.
The local branches of the society of
which Colonel Finerty is the recognized
chieftain will receive him in a manner
worthy the man and becoming the occa
eion. He will be met at Los Angeles by a
delegation of prominent Irish-born citi
zens of San Francisco and escorted to the
City with flying colors. Colonel Finerty is
now lecturing on Irish national affairs in
the Southern States. At the conclusion of
his tour in the South he will come directly
to California and deliver one lecture at
Metropolitan Hall in this City on the even
ing of March 4, the anniversary birthday
of Robert Emmet, the young Irish patriot
who was executed in Dublin in the latter
part of the eighteenth century for an al
leged political offense against the crown.
From here the lecturer goes north to Port
land and the Sound cities and thence to
Butte, Mont., concluding his circuit at
Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Finerty's one aim is to tell the people of
the South and West all about the new
Irish National Alliance, now well estab
lished at the East, and whose sole purpose
is to secure Irish independence, by peace
ful means if possible, with the sword if
compulsory. It is denned by the modern
ers as the reactionary movement which
comes through the working out of natural
causes from the wornout legislative policy
for which O'Connell stood rirst and Par
nell last. And Finerty is, perhaps, the
one man in America to tell what it means.
John, as everybody calls him in Chicago,
is a fine fellow. When he speafcs the mel
lifluous, unctuous tone of voice that he
derives from his ancestry is strengthened
by the robust vigor of his own oratorical
power, and the combination always wins
his audience. No man has been "'written
up" more than Finerty, and rightly, too,
for his. personality and character are as
f uli of color as a California sunset. It is
no extravagant prediction to say that Fin
Â»rty will never be forgotten by those who
will have the Rood fortune to see him and
listen to his Ciceronian rhetoric and his
matchless oratory.
This will not be Finerty's first visit
to San Franrisco. But he comes as
Timon went to Athensâ in rather differ
ent circumstances. â¢ On the occasion when
he first struck this transmontane metropo
lis he landed here without a penny in his
pocket. But his stars were with him and
he negotiated a loan from a newspaper
friend and was thus enabled to get safely
back to his friends. This time his ex
penses will be all guaranteed and there
will be money in the tiil over and above
the requisite'amount for expenses.
Colonel Finerty has had an eventful life.
His earlier years were passed as a reporter
on the daily* press of Chicago and later he
won distinction as a war correspondent
dnnas the Indian wars in the Northwest.
His whole life, and he is still in the prime
and vigor of his manhood, has been one of
action.
Suave, keen of eye, ruggedly good na
tured. impetuous yet cantious in his habit
of thought, strikingly original in speech,
generous, open-handed, a giant in stature
and a Titan in heart â this, in brief, is
John Finerty. He is soldier by nature,
war correspondent by experience, and
statesman by choice of the people. Yet
one who knows him well would pronounce
him a better soldier than a statesman, for
like all his race, he is a patriot born and
bred, and real patriotism, the sort we in
herit from the Greeks, who gave it to the
Rorrans. who flushed barbaric Europe by
their noble example, always finds its
broadest and most exhaustive outlet in
soldiery and fighting.
Finerty's newspaper work at the front
during the Indian wars in the Northwest
gave him a lasting reputation as a corre
spondent. His standing in the newspaper
world immediately advanced. His task
was a difficult one, as the Indians drew no
distinction between an English and a
Hibernian scalp; It was in the spring of
COLONEL JOHN' F. FINERTY.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
1876 that Finerty was detailed by the Chi
cago Times to join General G.eorge
CrooK's Big Horn and Yellowstone expe
dition against the Sioux, Cheyenne and
and other warlike Indians, then robbing,
plundering and murdering the whites in
the Dakotas and Montana. He was pres
ent at the Tongue River affair on June 9,
1876, and at How bud on June 17, where
every man was obliged to defend his own
life. Onsier and his men were massacred
a few days later some twenty miles away.
Later the correspondent joined General
Sibley's scouts and accompanied the dar
ing oand of frontiersmen in their memor
able expedition along the base of the Big
Horn range in Montana and took a hand
in the terrible encounter between the
scouts and the Indians on the Little Big
Horn River. The Sioux ch?ef, White An
telope, and other Indian warriors of re
nown were killed. Sibley lost a number
of men, killed and wounded, and all his
horses. The Indians received re-enforce

ments until the country was swarming
with them, and the scouts were obJiged to
retreat by night some fifty miles over
great rocks and turbulent streams (a
geoloeicai formation peculiar to the terri
tory) until they finally reached General
Crook's main body encamped under the
shadow of Cloud Peak. General Crook in
his official report to General Sheridan
spoke in praise of Finerty's valor in the
field and cheerfulness on the march.
Finerty continued with General Crook's
column until the close of the campaign
and was present at all the engagements
with the Indians. He was with the army
in its awful march from Tongue River to
the Yellowstone, and from the junction^of
the latter with the Powder River, beyond
the Little Missouri, tnence south to the
Black Hills in Dakota. Over 600 cavalry
horses were shot or abandoned on the
trip. The men were obliged to sleep in
the open, midst fierce storms, and for a
time they subsisted on horse meat. There
were several sharp encounters with the
Indians on the march in.
Captain Charles King, the historical
narrator and romance writer of the frontier,
in his volume, "Campaigning With
Crook," mentions the Ã¼biquitous reporter
in tins language: "A keen shot had just
succeeded in knocking an Indian out" of
his sadale and capturing his pony. Then
up came John Finerty, who seeks his
items on the skirmish line and uses pencil
and carbine with equal facility. Finerty
wants the name of the man who killed the
Indian, and learning from the eager voices
of the men that it is "Paddy Nihil,' he de
lightfully heads a new paragraph of his
dispatch, 'Nihil Fit,' shakes hands with
his fellow pathfinder and scurries off to
take a hand in the uproar on the left."
Many other like tales of the campaign
have since been told by army men at the
expense of the fearless and dashing young
Irish reporter. It was in the lifetime of
the buffalo. Finerty had killed his first
bull. His companions in the hunt remem
bered that it was of medium size, but on
reading a description which Finerty wrote
lor the Chicago Times they calculated that
the buffalo must have been at least eleven
feet high and weighed not less than 8000
pounds.
On his return to Chicago Finerty was
sent into Old Mexico, where he remained
for some time writing his impressions of
the country. He returned north to join
another expedition against the Indians in
Arizona and New Mexico, sending graphic
accounts of the campaign to his paper. He
had many narrow escapes from death, but
ran the gauntlet sately and returned home
only to be dispatched to the front again.
He was present on the Canadian line in
1879 when Sitting Bull surrendered to
Major Woods of the Northwest Mounted
Police and participated in the closing
skirmishes of this great Indian war.
After peace had been established Finerty
joined a geological party that explored the
Rocky Mountain regions, following the
course of the Lewis and Clark expedition,
and following down the Columbia River to
the Pacific Ocean. An exhaustive descrip
tion of the country through which he had
passed was afterward published in the
Chicago Times, which in the old days,
when Storey was at its head, was the great
est newspaper in the West. With Stoiey's
death the paper lost its grip on the public
mind, and gradually sank, until two years
ago it was bought for a song and became
hyphenated with the Chicago Herald.
After severing his connection with the
Times Colonel Finerty established the
Chicago Citizen and devoted his attention
to the affairs of his native Erin. This
was at a time when the Land League was
being established in the United States and
Finerty threw his whole soul into the
work. He always held extreme views on
the great question, and is now more than
ever convinced that if Ireland ever gains
herliberty it will be won by the sword.
He is unaltered in this conviction and
Finerty is a man of pronounced conviction.
He walks, talks and acts like a man with
opinions of his own. He is no half-way
patriot. As an orator Cokmel Finerty haa
a national reputation.
"There are orators and orators," says a
writer in the Chicago Chronicle, speaking
of Finerty's oratorical attainments. "One
will have the light, humorous way of play
ing with facts and logic, like the late
Emery A. Storrs; another will spout musi
cal prose and say nothing to any purpose,
other than that of gathering in the dollars,
like Colonel Ingersoll; still another will
brilliantly travesty history, like the late
lamented James G. Blame. Finerty is
not as any one of these. He is an orator
of a better note than any of them. He
does not trifle in his speeches; he is free of
blank verse, musical manner sms; he does
not draw forensic drafts on history, rewrit
ten by himself to suit his occasions; he
never speaks in public but be has some
thing important to say, and the style he
employsâ a style naturai to himselfâ is
happily correspondent to his matter. It
is terse, telling and brilliant, attracting
and convincing his hearers, and never
wearying them to any undue length of his
utterances. Arct his written is no less ad
mirable than his spoken style. In days
agone, when he was a writer daily on the
Chicago press, his articles were ever recoe
uizable by his friends and admirers, so
characteristic in the turn of thought and
phrasing were they of him and different
from the common.
Colonel Finerty served one term in the
lower house of Congress and has held im
portant offices in the municipal govern
ment of Chicago.
Regarding the reception to Colonel Fin
erty, a correspondent writes to The Call
as follows:
"Hon. John F. Finerty is a representa
tive newspaper man. From a reporter of
the Times to the editorship cf the Citizen,
he still represents that guild. It would be
only proper to select a few of our best Irish
journalists (and we have a few), with J. J.
O Bnen. Hon. Robert Tobin, George R. B.
Hayes. Colonel Patrick Roland. Dr. O'Neill,
Irvine Graham, Daniel O'Conneil, Thomas
E. Flyun, John K. Orr, Colonel J. C.
O Connor, William Cluff, Roger. Magee,
ex-Judge J. F. Sullivan, Judge J. F. Coffey
and such men, whose names are synony
mous with respectability, non-sectarianism
and the Celtic race, to meet him. Finerty
will speak on 'Robert Emmet. 1 The grand
father of John K. Orr was one of Emmet's
lieutenants in that memorable year of
'pride and sorrow, 1 so it would be fitting
to have Mr. Orr on the committee. Irvine
Graham and William Cluff are also North
of Ireland men, and as Emmet knew nei
ther north nor south, but a united Ire
land, without sectarianism, such a com
mittee could not fail to impress Mr. Fin
erty that the Irishmen of the Pacific Coast
were Ã¼breast of the twentieth century, and
it would stimulate him to do justice to the
memory of one of the purest', noblest and
most disinterested patriots that ever lived
upon the tides of time. An Irishman."
Death of James .Logue.
James Logne, one ol the oldest and best
known residents of Richmond, was buried last
Monday from the Star of the Sea Church.
High mass was celebrated by Key. Father
Coyle. The funeral was one of the largest ever
known in the district. The deceased was very
popular and had a large number of friends
among the business men of Richmond. For
some time before his death he was employed
at the Bay District racetrack. Mr. Logue was
a native of Ireland, 47 years old.
ARE STATE OFFICIALS
Bank Commissioners Cannot Be
Ousted by Criminal
Process.
They Are Not Amenable to the Law
Governing County or Municipal
Office-Holders.
It has been Bettjed, by decision of the
Supreme Court, that the Bank Commis
sioners are State officers, and cannot be
removed under the provisions of the penal
code, which prescribe the proceedings to
remove county or local officers. The de
cision is in the case of Paris Kilburn and
others, Bank Commissioners oi California,
a-.ainst J. K. Law, Judge of the Superior
Court of Mtrced County.
The case was based upon the application
for a writ of prohibition against Judge
Law, commanding him to desist from any
further proceedings against the petition
ers as Bank Commissioners in the matter
of the accusation of William Sherman.
On October 8, 1895, Sherman filed in the
Superior Court of Merced County a com
plaint against the Bank Commissioners,
charging that they had willfully neglected
their duties in that they did not ascertain
that the Merced Bank was insolvent and
unable to fulfill its obligations.
The claim was made that the Bank Com
missioners being State officials could not
be removed by criminal proceedings un
der section 772 of the Penal Code, the
section-of the code under which Sherman
made his complaint. It waa claimed by
the original suitors thnt there were many
features of a civil action in a proceeding
under section 772, principal among them
being a provision directing the court to
proceed in a summary manner to hear the
evidence, which is taken to mean that
there need not be a jury, and also that
the proceeding is not in the name of the
people. . , Â
In conclusion the opinion of the court
I stated the following:
It follows that the point that euch prosecu
tion cannot be had under this section against
the Hank Commissioners must be sustained.
They are not district, county, municipal nor
township officers, and by sections 888 and 889
prosecutions under section 772 can only main
tain against, such officers.

THE BIG BLYTHE ESTATE
Grandma Perry-Byrne Has Hypo
thecated a Portion of Her
Interest.
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND.
Imposing List of Those Who Have
Done a Percentage Banking
With the Lady.
The numerous attorneys connected with
the celebrated Blythe case from time to
time are exploring their thought domes
fcr an explanation of the motive of Flor
ence's grandmother in hypothecating so
large a portion of her interest in the estate.
To the world Florence Blythe-Hinckley's
grandmother was known as Mrs. Kate
Perry up to a few weeks ago. Her change
of name is due to a marriage which is said
to have taken place in Los Angeles on the
22d of Jast August.
The new name by which Mrs. Kate Perry
that was will henceforth be known is
Byrne, her second husband being John E.
Byrne, son of the capitalist, J. M. Byrne.
But that has nothing to do with the reason
which Mrs. Kate Perry-Byrne may have
for hypothecating so much of her contract
interest in the Blythe estate, though a
speciai and separate interest attaches
thereto as will be seen later on.
The attorneys say that Mrs. Kate Perry-
Byrne is after another slice of the estate.
This, however, ia merely an opinion, but
is put forth as a possible solution of the
lady's action. As is well known, she has
a 10 per cent contract on the estate with
her daughter Florence, which is equiva
lent to $350,000 or $400,000. Ex- Attorney-
General Hart holds a similar contract, but
that is another story.
The fact remains that the books of the
County Auditor furnish indubitable proof
of a number of transactions of the kind
mentioned.
in the language of one of the attorneys,
who has been actively identified with the
celebrated litigation for several years, Mrs.
Kate Perry-Byrne has banked "on her in
terest to the great profit of those who nave
been her bankers. One of the legal gen
tlemen goes so far as to say that she has
given in some instances $2 and $3 for one.
However true or fallacious that may be
can be judped after perusing a transcript
of the records.
lii book 37 of Covenants, pasje 283, is
found the first record of bvpotnecation.
It reads: Kate C. Perry to L. P. Drexler,
a $10,000 interest in her contract for ttie
consideration of $10,000 and interest, etc.
All of the notes read that the money
borrowed is to be on loan until such time
as the litigation shall come to an end and
the estate be distributed.
On page 337, same book, is recorded a
loan of $4000 obtained by Mrs. Perry from
Levi Kowalsky.
Page 355, same book, is allotted to Mrs.
Perry and W. B. Waldron, the latter hav
ing supplied Mrs. Perry with funds
amounting to $3485, at 6 per cent.
On pace 3GO Mr. Waldron is also re
corded as having furnished Mrs. Perry in
July, 1895, $2000 for six months, interest at
the rate of 2 per cent.
One of the most important and signifi
cant records is that found on page 3ti9,
same book of covenants, it is set
forth that for and in consideration of his
legal services, Hepburn Wilkins is to re
ceive 3 per cent of all the moneys which
Mrs. Perry realizes from the estate by vir
tue of her contract with Florence. That
means twelve or thirteen thousand dollars.
On the 14th of August the records show
that William Feehan loaned Mrs. Perry,
then Mrs. Perry-Byrne, $1500. Mr. Feeha'n
had previous to the date mentioned taken
H. .1. Kowalsky's contract.
Henry I. Kowalsky on page 250 is re
corded as Mrs. Perry's creditor in the sum
of $45,00 C. On the same date, March 30,
1892, Kowalsky assigned his contract to
Henry J. Lang.
Book 39 of Covenants, page 57, contains
the record of a loan of $31,500 made by 8.
G. Murphy to Mrs. Perry at 8 per cent.
On page 69, same book, is found the re
cord of a loan of $8576 80, at 6 per cent,
made by A. Fusenot.
A loan of $5740, at 10 per cent, is recorded
on page 93, same book, from L. P. Drexler
to Kate C. Byrne. January 23, 1896.
With interest the hypothecations herein
specified will approximate about $160,000.
Irrespective of any bearing which these
figures may have on the theory advanced
by some of the attorneys, it is obviously
expensive to her as Mrs. Perry and Mrs.
Perry-Byrne have lived. But" that does
not count against a new grandpapa, and
from all reports Florence lias gracefully
accepted Mr. Byrne as the patriarchal
paternal head of the family.
The marriage of Mrs. Perry to the weil
known capitalist's sou was kept a secret for
several months, not being made known
until a few days ago. The date of the
marriage is given as August 22, 1895, and
a comparison of dates reveals a spicy
story.
In the latter part of August of last year
Mr. Byrne spent two or three days in the
City. He had with him considerable
money and jewelry of the value of $800 or
$900. A waiter at a certain restaurant
helped himself to $500 worth of the jew
elry and considerable money. The cul
prit was apprehended and the money and
jewels were recovered. Mr. Byrne de
clined to prosecute and disclaimed all
knowledge as to the ownership of the
jewels. It afterward transpired that they
were the property of Mrs. Kate C. Perry,
then or afterward his wife, and specula
tion was rife as to the cause of the mystery.
