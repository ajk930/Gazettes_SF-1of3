Interests.
WASHINGTON, P. C. April 17.â
rival San Pedro and Santa Monica harbor
delegations were arrayed against each
other before the Senate Commerce Com
mittee today. The session lasted from
10:30 a. m. until 5 p. m. Senators White
and - Perkins, Representative McLachlan,
Huntington and several of his agents to
gether with the nine Los Angeles dele
gates were present. The first speaker was
McLachlan, who gave the following suc
cinct history ofthe case:
"Perhaps it would be well for me at the
outset of my remarks to state briefly the
history of harbor matters in the vicinity
el-Los Angeles. More than twenty years
ago Congress made an appropriation for
the improvement of Wilmington harbor,
now known as the inside harbor of San
Pedro, and various appropriations have
.been made for improvement of that har
bor until they now aggregate nearly
51,000,000.. Some years ago the Govern
ment engineers made an investigation of
the outside harbor at San Pedro and re
ported the feasibility of constructing a
deep-sea harbor in that vicinity.
"A short time afterward another survey
was made by Government engineers for
the purpose of determining which was the
better place for the outside harbor, at San
Pearo or Santa Monica, a place located in
the neighborhood of thirty mile 3 north
west of San Pedro. Reports of the Gov
ernment engineers in reference to the in
vestigation of these two harbors are a
matter of record, and can be examined by
you for themselves. They will show that
the Government engineers in comparing
the two locations, specified certain advan
tages in favor of San Pedro.
â¢Since that last report there has been a
great deal of agitation over the question
as to which is the better location for a
deep-sea harbor in that locality, and each
locality has had its supporters. When I
was nominated for Congress I stated that
if I were elected I would do all in my
power to obtain a provision for a deep-sea
harbor at San Pedro. I think that each
"candidate nominated by either party in
that campaign two years ago did the same
thing. The general sentiment of the peo
ple, based largely, I believe, upon the re
ports of the Government engineers, was in
favor of San Pedro.
"These are conditions on which I came
to Congress. I arrived in Washington
and found here the friends of San Pedro
in doubt as to the advisability of contend
ing for an appropriation for an outside
harbor at San Pedro at this session. After
consultation with the friends of San Pedro
harbor I decided it was wise on account of
the depleted condition of the treasury and
economical ideas which seemed to prevail
to confine my efforts to an appropriation
to deepen the inside harbor at San Pedro
to eighteen feet at mean low water, ac
cording to the report of Colonel Benyaurd,
who stated that it could be done for
$392,000. \y.y
"I was the last friend of San Pedro who
finally assented to that course, and the
friends of San Pedro will bear me out
when I say that I told them that I was
elected to come here to work for an out
side harbor at San Pedro. That was my
pledge to the people, and I feared I would
not be justified in confining my efforts to
an inside harbor. But it seemed the best
thing to do.
"â We went before the House Committee
and asked for an appropriation of $392,000
â¢ for.the improvement of the inner harbor
at San Pedro, at the same time stating
that we did not .relinquish our efforts for
an outside harbor in that locality, but dis
tinctly declared the reasons* why we had
.concluded to confine our efforts at this
Congress for an appropriation for an inside
harbor.
"Just before the river and harbor bill was
reported to the House it was learned that
the House Committee bad included in it
an appropriation for 'the full amount that
was asked for an inside harbor at San
Pedro and also an appropriation for about
$2,800,000 for the construction of an outside
harbor at Santa Monica.
"I am bound here to state, as a represen
tative from that district, that I never
asked an appropriation for Santa Monica.
We simply confined our efforts to the in
side harbor at San Pedro. - And I now say,
as a representative of that district,' coming
. fresh from the people, that I am not here
to-day asking for an appropriation for
Santa Monica, but asking for one to com
plete the inside harbor of San Pedro ac
cording to the plan of Col. Benyaurd, and
if in the wisdom of the committee they
see their way clear to give us an appropria
tion for an outside harbor I ask. you to
give it for the construction of such harbor
at San Pedro. No locality in the United
' States is more entitled to a large appro
priation 1 ' for such improvements. No ex
penditure of public money will .bring
* better results, not only to that locality but
to tlie whole nation." jY *
W. C. Patterson, president of 'the Board
of Trade of Los Angeles, said :
"In view of the repeated reports of the
United States engineers and in view of the
repeatedly expressed preferences of our
people it would seem to us superfluous to
discuss the question of a site for a deep sea
harbor. It would seem scarcely necessary
for us to attack the claims which have been
nreseuted for establishing a harbor at a
The San Francisco Call.
location which has not been favored by
any considerable body of our people;
which has not been supported by any of
the eminent engineers of the United States
Government, which has not been favored
by either of the distinguished Senators
from California or by any representatives
in Congressâ from the section of the
country which is interested in the con
struction of a harbor contigious to Los
Angeles. It would seem these facts alone
should be sufficient to eliminate from con
sideration any other location than San
Pedro."
Judge A. M. Stephens followed Mr. Pat
terson and said for the San Pedro project :
' "It will bring large and small vessels
into immediate contact, allowing foreign
commerce to come into immediate contact
with the coastwise vessels. It will be more
economical in the administration and con
struction than a breakwater at Santa Mon
ica and will enable the Government by rea
sonable expenditure to attain any reason
able depth over the inner bar, thus accom
modating all classes of vessels. y .
"With all these reasons in favor of San
Pedro you will readily see why our people
insist upon that location. It has been
urged as a reason why Santa Monica
should receive an appropriation that Mr.
Huntington has tried San Pedro and found
that it would not answer the purpose and
that he accordingly built his pier at Santa
Monica. I do not believe that Mr. Hunt
ington abandoned the construction of
a pier at San Pedro for any such reason.
On the contrary, I think I can point out
the true reasons. About 1875 an inde
pendent railroad line was built from Los
Angeles to Santa Monica, with a pier to
deep water at the latter point. This line
and pier about 1877 was bought by the
Southern Pacific and fell at once into in
nocuous desuetude.
"That company having no competitor at
either place showed its faith in San Pedro
by transferring all business to that point,
and using lighters at San Pedro instead of
the deep-sea pier at Santa Monica. This
continued to be the case until the Redondo
people built their wharf in ISS7. That
company by contracts with merchauts se
cured about 53 per cent of all tbe ocean
freights to Los Angeles. Then the South
ern Pacific determined to and did move
up the coast to the extremest point. I
think this accounts for the move, and had
Redondo pier not been built no pier would
have been built at Santa Monica."
Ex-Mayor Hazzard of Los Angeles argued
forcibly in favor of San Pedro.
The first witness in the afternoon ses
sion of the committee was Major C. W.
Raymond of the corps of engineers. He
was a member of the board appointed by
the Secretary of "War in 1892 and he said
that the reasons for the preference given
by the board to San Pedro bad been stated
very clearly and concisely in its report. In
answer to questions by various members
of the commfttee Major Raymond de
tailed at some length the points on which,
in his opinion, the harbor at San Pedro
was to be preferred to that of Santa
Monica. *'* :' r '' J '^-'j"y
Lieutenant-Colonel Peter* Harris of the
engineer corps, also a member of the array
board of 1892, added his statement in sup- j
port of the views of the board. J
Then the friends of Santa Monica came
to present the arguments in favor of tbat j
harbor.
Collis P. Huntington, president of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, told how his
predecessor, Mr. Stanford, had mistak
enly assumed that San Pedro was to be the
important port on the coast and had ex
pended nearly a million of dollars there;
out now he (Mr. Huntington), when he
made a visit of inspection, became satis
fied that a mistake had been committed
and went to work and built a track to and
docks at Santa Monica, which he pre
dicted would become a very important
port.
E. L. Coltrell, civil engineer, furnished
the committee with a variety of technical
reasons why Santa Monica was to be pre
ferred to San Pedro.
Ex-Senator Cole of California spoke of
the wonderful progress of Los Angeles in
population and wealth during the last ten
years, and gave it as his opinion that fully
nine-tenths of the people of i Los Angeles
now favored Santa Monica, although they
had been passive in the matter during the
past year.
The final argument in favor of Santa
Monica was made by Mr. Mitchell, but he
had not got through s with his speech at
the time of adjournment. 'y â¢<
The hearing will be continued to-mor

Late last night Jim Donahue, aged 18

believing him to be Davies. fired. One
charge of buckshot entered the back of his
bead and he will probably â  die. He lived
with bis widowed mother on a farm near
the scene of the accident. The result* of
the accident has been to further enrage
the people against Davies, and a lynching
will almost certainly take place "if he. is

JUSTICE MAY BE SECURED.
Barbarous Tactics of the Spanish to
Form the Subject of Special
Inquiry.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 15 (via Tampa,
Fla., April 17.)â The appointment of Gen
eral Fitzhugh Lee to succeed Consul-Gen
eral Williams it is understood by Ameri
cans here as well as by the authorities at
the palace as an adroit way of sending a
military commissioner from the States to
Cuba. When there was an intimation a
fortnight ago that Mr. Cleveland contem
plated sending a commission here to learn
what was going on the officials at Madrid
said very plainly that no military or other
commission would be accepted by them or
permitted to pry into affairs in Cuba.
There is, therefore, some curiosity as to
how General Lee will be received and as to
what facilities will be accorded him for
learning what is transpiring outside of the
city of Havana. s:
The Spanish officials with whom I have
talked will not discuss any other mission
he maybe supposed to have. /They have
got along so" smoothly with Consul-Gen
eral Williams, who has devoted himself
assiduously to viewing bills of lading and
allowed Americans in jail to rot- there and
others to be shot down and their prop
erty destroyed, that there may be trouble
when a live American comes here to rep
resent Uncle Sam. V ' *. :
It goes without saying \ that American
residents will welcome General Lee with
open arms. He will not be long in discov
ering that a state of war exists in Cuba;
that life is respected on one side and pris
oners set free, while on the other a war of
extermination against all Cubans is waged
prisoners of war are shot and cut to
pieces and political suspects imprisoned
by thousands. He will learn that Spain is
powerless to protect American property
throughout the island; that millions of
dollars worth of property belonging to our
citizens has been destroyed, and the pros
pect of recompense is as shadowy as cas
tles in Spain. -
He will hear of Americans who have
Deen shot down by Spanish troops
and will find others imprisoned in dun
geons with no prospect of trial or release.
His eyes will be opened to that which
has stirred the heart of mankind, for the
truth has been told by all American corre
spondents with one exception. They have
got the news out in spite of the Spanish
censor and of all the barriers to truth that
the narrowrhindedness of the middle ages
has endeavored . to erect around the island
of Cuba.. Correspondents have been thrown
into Moro Castle. Others have been ex
pelled, i ' â  V /.-y.-rj {
Those ; who remain know 1 what ' fate
awaits them. But the truth gets out just
the same. If the : appointment of Gen
eral Lee means that the administration
seeks light in view of all the misrepresen
tations that have been and are going
through official channels, it is a step in
the right direction and had it been taken
months ago, thousands of lives would
have been saved. J. Frank Clark.

.. SEATTLE, April 17.â Confronted
by the stern fact that within a few days
he would be taken back to Puluth to an
swer ior the killing of Miss Lena Olsen for
her money, and by the further probability
of having to account for the death of his
first wife, James E. Allsop, who was ar
rested'in this city last evening by Petec
tive John Courtney -of Minneapolis, took
his own life to-night. He hanged himself
in a cell in the city jail between the hours
of 8 and 10 o'clock. His body was found
by Petective Courtney about 10:30 o'clock
and cut down by that officer, with the as
sistance of Jailer Peer. Âââ¢ * -*-. ii: ~- 'â :"')
. . Courtney had started to his department
to retire, and on the way stopped at the
jail to see how his prisoner was faring.
He was too late. Life bad passed from the
body, which was yet warm. Allsop had
torn his blankets, plaiting the strips into
a rope, which he tied about his neck and
then made fast to an iron bolt four feet and
six inches above the floor. He held his
legs and feet from the floor in such man
ner as to be able to produce strangulation
and death, the desired result. His body
when found stood in a half-crouch
ing attitude,' with the legs doubled up
beneath it. ' '.'â¢-â '
'. Coroner Askam was called in, but de
cided not to hold an inquest. The body
was then taken -to the Morgue, where it
lies on a slab to-night, as cold and lifeless
as those of the persons whose lives Allsop
was accused of having taken.
During the day Detective Courtney sev
eral times remarked that Allsop showed
signs of breaking down, and expressed the
belief that the man would commit suicide
if he : only had an opportunity. Shortly
after the tragic end, Courtney declared
that if there was any way it could be done
without violating the law be proposed to
take the body, back to Minneapolis.
. . Evidence that would place a noose about
the neck of the murderer had accumu
lated ;- ; ," rapidly after his arrest Vby
Courtney. : The officer to-day proved
beyond question that the * pris
oner,- who was known here and in Tacoma
by hundreds of people as Allsop, was a man
who traveled in Minneapolis and Duluth
as A. Austin. - .-;.', ' ; .
A lady living in this city, who knew All
sop in Tacoma and also in Kansas, where
he-was Mayor of Wakeeney, Trego County,
in the eighties, says Mrs. William Bur
roughs of Tacoma .is in possession of an
affidavit or confession in writing, in which
the first Mrs. Allsop declares that her bus
band had' on two occasions tried to poison
her. tVhen the â = first attempt was made
they were living in either : Michigan ;or
Wisconsin, and according to the state-
I ment Allsop administered paris green in a
nicely prepared dish of lettuce, of which
his wife was very fond. Suspecting some
thing, Mrs. Allsop abstained from partak
ing of the dish and had the contents an
alyzed, with the result, as claimed, that
enough paris green was found in the let
tuce to kill three women. The same in
formant states that it was the general be
lief in Tacoma at the time of the alleged
runaway that Mrs. Allsop, who was
known to have lived most unhappily with
her husband, had met with foul play
rather than accidental death. :yy.- tyl
â  Allsop spent his boyhood days at Gil
bertsvilie, Otsego County, N. V., where
he was a schoolmate of Henry .Foster, a
well-known resident of this city.

SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 17.â
Carnival week ended to-night in the
splendor of the far-famed annual ball.
The canvas pavilion adjoining the Arling
ton was the scene of the dancing. It re
tained the decorations and the illumina
tions already described in connection with
the great display of the roses, but where
the tables of flowers had stood a crash
covered floor felt the tread of the dancers.
In itself the ball was much like any
brilliant event of the same nature in Sao
Francisco, except that the dancing was in
a tent instead of a hall, and the constant
swaying of the breeze-blown roof gave a
summery and out-of-doors aspect. There
were no floral decorations of especial note,
but flowers were not needed for the beauty
of the scene. And Santa Barbara has been
covered with flowers all the week.
There were about 15,000 persons in the
pavilion, and everybody was delighted
with the brilliancy of the social event.
The programmes, given as souvenirs, were
in the form of booklets. The cover was in
rich brown shades, with a maiden's por
trait and a palm background, partly con
cealed by the hinging ribbons of white
moire. Inscriptions of the costumes will
be a description of the brightest, airiest ef
fects that the artists can produce.
Pescription of the wearers of the lace
and the muslins and the silks would be a
story from the infinite. Society maidens
of quiet old Santa Barbara, were hardly
in greater numbers than their sisters, the
.pqrenially summer girls of all California,
â¢and there were scores of young ladies from
the East; San Francisco had * a notable
representation of the men and the naval
officers were prominent.
The ball was begun with a flower dance,
performed by. fifteen young ladies, who,
with the exception of three in pink, wore
costumes of white tarletan and car

ATHLETIC 6PORTS.
Fine Records Made Despite a high
Wind.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 17.â
The field day of sports or tournament of
volunteer firemen of Southern California
held at the Agricultural Park grounds
here to-day drew but a moderate crowd,
probably because of the disagreeable wind
which was blowing and which caused

necessity postponed.
The records takenVere all more or less
affected by the .weather and in almost
every instance would have been materi

WON AN EDUCATION.
What Fayette Birtch's Hundred-
Yard Score Meant.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 17.â
When Fayette Birtch toed the chalk-mark
in the hundred-yard run at the Santa
Barbara racetrack to-day few of those
who looked on understood what the win
ning or losing of the race meant to the
boy.
Small and slender, with a thin, beard
less face, he looked a mere lad in contrast
to his stalwart competitors. As he came
flying alone the track, a hand's breadth,
a foot, a yard in advance of the others, his
pale face set, his eager eyes unseeing the
throng of people and fixed only on the
goal, he saw something more than the line
which marked the end of his course and
the small glory of reaching it ahead of the
other runners. He was running for ah ed
ucation and knew that upon this race de
pended his future career.
When young Birtch, a high school se
nior in the Santa Barbara school, who bad;
never bad a day's training in his : life,'
made a record of 10 1-5 seconds last fall, a
famous college club wrote and offered him
a regular salary. This salary, while a gen- ;
erous offer to an inexperienced young
amateur, was still insufficient to pay his
college and personal expenses. If he could
lower this record he was well aware that
new and more generous offers would be
made.
A young runner with a record almost
equal to the world's best is in demand in
these days, when it sometimes seems a
question whether the athlete or the scholar
is the more distinguished product of our
great universities.
This race was the first on the afternoon's
programme. The runners, perhaps a trifle
nervous, made their start a little after
rather than upon the pistol shot, Birtch
and one other ; touching one hand to the
ground and throwing the body forward in
the approved fashion of the best runners.
The day was a disagreeable .one and
windy, and although the young men had
their backs to the breeze 'it came in whirl
ing gusts, hindering rather V than helping
them. Among those at the track was a
writer on track athletics, who represents
eight Eastern sporting papers as their
Southern .California correspondent, . and
who has a fair idea of track facilities.
He made a critical examination of the
ground and, considering track and weather
together, declared that no man could pos
sibly do better than 11 seconds on that
track.: If one of them should go under
that, he declared, he would be a "cracker
jack." For the benefit of the uninitiated
it may be explained that a "cracker jack"
is a world's record breaker, a term com
monly applied in" bicycle racing.
Every one agreed tbat the track was too
soft for the spiked shoes of the runners.
When Birtch came down the track in
splendid style, well in advance of the rest,
the cries of "Fayette!" "Fayette were
deafening. All the high school boysâ his
fellow-studentsâ out in force, and
they had known what to expect from the
first. There was a dash for the boy when
he crossed the line and the time, "ten
flat!" was shouted.
Dr. Birtch, the lad's father, made a wild
rush for him, and succeeded in pushing
aside the rest. Few understood the rea
son for his excitement. Fayette Birtch's
uncle, the doctor's brother, had been
killed by being stopped too quickly at the
end of just such a run in Canada years
ago. Then Fayette was lifted to his
friends' shoulders and borne triumphantly
back to the judges. - h;.?
There was great dismay among men
from the south who had been laying heavy
odds against tbe Santa Barbara boy, but
a few minutes later the discovery was
made that Birtch's trainer had been at the
chalk line at the time of the start. Al
though it was conceded that this in no
way influenced the run it was in clear vio
lation of the rules, and, after a hot dispute,
the race was declared off.
Another event was called, and when the
100-yard race was repeated Birtch made
precisely the same record of ten seconds
flat, this time crossing the line fifteen feet
ahead of his rivals, who good-naturedly
acknowledged his triumph and joined in
the cheers which greeied this second score.
Later on Birtch again distinguished him
self by scoring 16J_ seconds in the 120
--yard hurdle race, coming in five yards in
advance of a Riverside runner of high
repute. In this run Birtch had the mis
fortune to strike the first hurdle, almost
losing his balance and considerably retard
in. him. .
There is a history back of this boy's re
markable achievement. He comes of a
family of runners, his father in his youth
being ruled out of all local events in his
Canadian home. Robert Birtch, his
uncle, was the champion of Canada and
was never beaten in a race. He died
twenty-seven years ago at the end of a
successful race against the American
championâ a man from Woodstock, Vt. â
being killed by a friend, who caught him
and checked him too near the line. ; y V
Fayette is said to be the image of this
uncle. The boy, who it is believed may
now justly lay claim to the California
record, was born in Scotland, S. Dak.,
February 29, 1876, and has, t herefore, just
seen his twentieth birthday. He is a good
scholar and of unusually studious habits.
He has never trained, even in the sense of
taking the proper precautions against
catching cold and being rubbed down
after running, until the last few weeks
while he has been preparing for this run.
His admirers among his schoolmates,
jealous of his strength and health, have
been fuming because Fayette neither
dieted nor observed the proper hours in
training, and there was a panic among
them when he went to a party some ten
days aco and stayed up until midnight,
eating a late supper. His father, when
appealed to, assured the anxious friends
that it was the best thing the boy could
do, as every night that he remained at
home he invariably sat up until 1 or 2
o'clock; in the morning reading or
studying.
FIESTA DE LOS ANGELES.
The City of the Angels Donning
Carnival Garb.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 17.â The
city is beginning to don its holiday clothes
preparatory to the opening of the carnival
next Tuesday. As yet little decorating
has been done, but the work will be begun
in earnest to-morrow and pushed with
vigor over Sunday. By Monday evening
the principal streets will be masses of red,
green and yellow. Â y
The street decorations will be especially
fine. Frank Wiggins, superintendent of
the Chamber of Commerce exhibit, who
made such an enviable record as manager
of the Southern California exhibits at re
cent international expositions, has charge
of this feature.
Thousands of palm leaves and miles of
bunting will be used in beautifying the
line of march, while magnificent floral
arches will span tne principal street inter
sections.
The pageant promises to be the most art
istic and picturesque ever seen west of the
Rocky Mountains.
The parade on Wednesday afternoon
will 'be participated in by the entire
brigade N. G. C. of Southern California,
marines from United States ships and
many uniformed societies. The floats in
this parade, typical of Southern California
resources, progress and development, will
be very attractive.
Most unique of all will be the Chinese
section, containing the big dragon, 800 feet
long, and the rich and gaudy trappings
from the Chinese theaters and josshouses
in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
The night parade Thursday evening,
typical of lands of the sun, will rival the
New Orleans Mardi Gras in artistic merit
and gorgeousness.
The sports at Athletic Park on Thurs
day will draw an immense crowd. Prizes
will be competed for by some of the most
noted athletes in the State.
The school ] children's parade and flag
raising on Friday will not be the least
interesting feature of the week's festivities,
and the display of fireworks Friday even
ing will be par excellence.
Hazard's pavilion, where the fiesta ball
is io take place,' is being converted into a
veritable palace for the occasion. The
presence of naval and military officers in
full uniform will give eclat to the event
unusual to social functions in Los An
geles! '.-.'" / " " : : 'â¢ " , ' â¢
The hotels are already filling up with
fiesta guests, and the indications are that
the city will b* taxed to its utmost to ac
commodate the throngs that will be here
next week. ' :

made. Fifty more carriages than necessary
to accommodate the 350 hotel men were in
waiting. Raymond Hill, the site of the

to thank each .ana every person who con
tributed flowers or service*. We shall always

Geo. W. Lynch, President H. M. M. B. A.
From Pasadena the Easterners went to
Redlands. At Santa Anita they were met
by the following committee of Redlands
citizens, sent out by Colonel J. T. Ritchie,
chairman of the local committee of ar
rangements, to give them a welcome to the
city: Messrs. E. G. Judson, R. C. McGln
ness, Dr. J. S. Riggs, A. G. Hubbard, C. M.
Brown, Dr. D. W. Stewart. Charles Put
nam, R. H. Garland and S. C. Haver.
Arriving at Redlands, carriages were for
the second time to-day placed at the dis
posal of the hotel men and their ladies,
and they enjoyed a ride about this beauti
tul young wonder of a growing city, which
is now but a decade old. Of course they
visited Smiley Heights, now grown fa
mous, and went into ecstacies over both it
and the view therefrom.
" Toward evening Casa Loma, Redlands'
handsome new hotel, became the center of
interest because of Colonel Ritchie's ten
dering them a complimentary orange
supper.
The building was tastefully decorated
both inside and out with bunting and
flags. .'.'â¢*"'..
' In the center of the rotunda was a pyra
mid of handsome oranges, the openings
between which were filled with large straw
berries, and the whole crowned with a
beautiful bouquet of flower. In front of
the hotel the double row of graceful pep
per ' trees had been made more beautiful
even than they were by nature.
Ropes of oranges stretched for several
hundred feet on either side, besides great
streamers of flowers, while the rows of
Spanish bayonets and palm leaves com
pleted the transformation. Oranges were
given away by the boxfull. Then followed
the orange supper at the Casa Loma.which
was a very tasteful one, and it was served
by the girls of the Redlands High School,
who acquitted themselves well.
As the dinner drew to a close President
B. H. Yard of the Hotelmen's Mutual
Benefit Association called for a vote of
thanks to the citizens of Redlands, to

GEAR PROTESTS WITH WARMTH
Hill of New York Argues Against
the Investigation of Bond
Issues.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.â Hill
continued without concluding this after
noon the speech he commenced yesterday
against the passage of the Peffer resolu
tion to investigate the bond sales of the
present administration. Hill saved his
strength for a protracted fight by having
read at the clerk's desk the various laws
relative to the redemption of greenbacks
ana quotations from President Cleveland's
messages on the financial question. He
has still much matter in reserve and may
continue for two or three days, especially
if he secures the assistance he did this
afternoon. V 7
Hill was about to yield to a motion for
an executive session, when Gear (R.) of
lowa reported the bill for the refunding of
the Pacific bond-aided railroads. This led
to an altercation between Gear, chairman
of the committee, and Allen, the Populist
Senator from Nebraska, in which some
warm words were used on both sides.
Gear' s statements were characterized by
Allen as false. Allen was called to order
and his words read from the clerk's desk,
after which he was permitted proceed
in order. Allen's subsequent remarks
consisted of a tribute to the recent candi
date of bis party for the Presidency,
James B. Weaver, and a defense of the
principles of the party which Gear had
attacked.
Hoar of Massachusetts, who expects to
leave the city, immediately, spoke briefly
in favor of the investigation resolutions
and criticized .the remarks of Hill as
being more in place on the stump than in
the Senate Chamber.
The attendance of the Senate was very
slim, and when, after the disposition of
routine business at 12:15 o'clock. Cannon
of Utah sought to call up the Senate
resolution directing the Secretary of the
Interior to open the Uncompahgre reser
vation in Utah to settlement in ac
cordance with existing law, the point of
ho quorum was made, yyyv -' *' â¢
This resolution lost its place as the un
finished business and went to the calendar
yesterday when Peffer's bond resolution
was taken 1 up. Cannon moved to again
take it up and consider it till 2 o'clock
without displacing the bond investigation
resolution. <â -.<â  , -_â  .
Upon tbe call of the Senate, fifty-nine
Senators responded, more than a quorum,
and the joint resolution was then taken
up. Upon Cannon's suggestion the order
of business was laid aside for twenty
minutes in order to permit Senator Vilas,
who antagonizes â¢_ the resolution, to reach
the chamber. Gorman (D.) of Maryland
suggested that in the absence of Vilas, who
desired to be heard on the subject, the
matter go over until to-morrow.
Aldrich (R.) of Rhode Island remarked
that there must be some purpose back of
the constant attempts to delay business.
If there was it might as well be developed
now as any other time.
This precipitated a lengthy colloquy be
tween Gorman, Aldrich and Chandler
about delay to business, which was ended
by the appearance of Vilas. He made an
argument against the Uncompahgie joint
resolution. .â¢>-.'',! -'.- '- '- -^ ,'--".,' .."
At 2 o'clock the Peffer resolution was
laid before the Senate.
Turpie (D.) of Indiana asked unanimous
consent that Vilas be permitted to con
clude his remarks, but Peffer objected.
Hill (D.) of New York then addressed
the Senate on the bond investigation reso
lution, continuing the speech begun by
him yesterday. George (D.) of Mississ
ippi asked if, under existing law, bonds
could be sold to secure gold for any other
purpose than to redeem greenbacks and
maintain the reserve.
Hill said that : was the whole authority
and gold had not been used for any other
purpose. ;
. Hill then read the resumption act of
1875, under which, he said, bonds should
be Issued to obtain either gold or silver, as
the Secretary of the Treasury might elect.
The theory of the friends of the pending
resolution was that that law had ; ex
hausted itself when specie payments had
been resumed. But the law of 1878 pro
vided for the ! continuous reissue and re
demption of greenbacks and gave continu
ous authority to protect the greenback
currency and redeem it so long as re
quired. The laws of 1875 and 1878 must be
taken together. Had not the power been
exercised to issue bonds disaster would
have resulted. This new-born party, how
ever, was contending that these bonds had
been issued without authority." Why cast
discredit on the bonds of the United
States? Why insinuate a doubt where no
doubt existed? It would have been im
possible to keep up the credit of the Gov
ernment without a bond issue.
There was a deficiency in Government
revenues, and some money must be ' had
for the support of the Government. While
these bonds were not "actually issued for
keeping up ; the " expenses of the Govern
ment, yet it amounted to the same thing.
Therefore he would ask those who doubted'
the authority to issue bonds how, in view
of the deadlock existing between ", the
House and Senate, the credit of the Gov
ernment was to be maintained otherwise?
He had not supported the â¢â  Wilson bill.'
He had used his best endeavors to have
some of its obnoxious provisions stricken
out. But the bill was passed, and it was
now conceded by both " its \ friends = and
enemies that it did not provide sufficient
revenue for the support of the Govern ment.
Funds were procured otherwise to supply
the deficiency the â¢ bond-issuing power
had been exercised. What chaos would
â¢ have resulted without it ! i. It - was ; by that
means the present administration - had
kept the Government afloat.
; â â 'â¢ The President and Secretary of the
Treasury did not , issue' bonds as a matter
of choiceâ it was an imperative necessityâ
the result of a policy that was inherited
by the administration. Why all this harp
ing criticism ? It would not secure votes
from the other party ; it would not help
the party. "God knows," said Hill, "the
party, has troubles enough of its own with
out borrowing any."
Allen intimated that the Democratic
party was on the way to destruction.
"The old party is not gone," retorted Hill
"It will live on and on, if true to itself.
The actions of a few misguided cannot
destroy it. It has seen darker days than
these, and has gone through them to great
and glorious victories."
Hill, reviewing the recent bond sale,
showed that the vast majority . of the
money was subscribed by the people of
New York State. He did. not propose to
have these securities depreciated, if he
could help it. by any trumped-up charge
such as is now being agitated by a few
Populists, unsupported by any other class
of people. The attack upon the adminis
tration was unwise, silly and absurd and if
the investigation was had the administra
tion would come out of it, Hill asserted,
without a stain. Why not pursue the
manly policy and admit that he bad to
sell bonds in order to keep up his reserve,
but do not, he appealed, question the Sec
retary's honesty. ;. . " ?
Referring to Carlisle and deploring
the offensive language used by some of
the silver men, Hill paid the Secretary a
glowing tribute.
In proof of the fact that the administra
tion did nothing secretly Hill had the
clerk read the message of the President of
February 8, 1895, announcing that the con
ditions were such that it was necessary to
issue bonds to the amount of $62,000,000.
It informed Congress exactly of what was
contemplated and what would have to be
done. Congress was deaf to the President's
appeals. It preferred to denounce syndi
cates and then play into their hands by
withholding adequate legislation.
As the hour of 3 o'clock approached Hill
reached a point in his remarks where he
was about to yield to a motion to go into
executive session, whan Gear laid before
the Senate the bill agreed upon by the
Committee on Pacific Railroads, of which
he is chairman, providing for the refund
ing of the debts of the Pacific bond-aided
railroads. j This report led to a sensational
incident and prolonged a debate for more
than an hour that was warm and personal.
Hill, who was willing to be interrupted,
yielded to Allen, who began to condemn
the action of the committee. It was, he
said, a matter of common report that the
"notorious Collis P. Huntington and lob
byists had been seeking to influence legis
lation relative to these roads." '
Allen called tbe attention of the Senate
to the fact that no invitation had been is
sued to tbe people along the lines of these
roads or to their patrons to appear before
the committee and give the information of
which they were possessed. There had
been a studied effort on the part of the
.committee to cut off these people and not
get a full and free expression of the public
. sentiment.
Gear retorted with warmth that Allen
had no right to impugn the chairman of
the committee for not sending out notices
to every Tom, Dick and Harry all over
God's country. The country had been
notified through the newspapers of the
hearing, and ail who saw fit to come had
been heard. The committee has followed
the universal custom of both branches of
Congress in conducting the hearing.
This explanation did not appease the
Senator from Nebraska. Allen replied
that he had seen the supreme magnet of
the Pacific bond-aided roads, that "em
bodiment of corruption itself," sitting in
the committee -room like an autocrat,
lording it over the committee, and with
the lobbyists occupying seats there, but
not a single farmer who had been op
pressed by the road ; not a single patron
of the line itself. He repeated that there
had been a studied and fixed purpose to
exclude these people from the hearings of
the committee. i~.v â 
Gear stated he had invited the Senator
to come before the committee, but he bad
not done so. He represented in part â
Gear would not say "misrepresented â a
State interested in those roads, and yet he
declined the committee's invitation to be
present and give such testimony as he saw
fit. The Senator from Nebraska belonged
to a class of people who sought to pull
down rather than build up. "I have
known him for thirty years and have
known all the parties with which he has
affiliated," said Gear, "and now he turns
up here as what my friend, the Senator
from Mississippi, would call a Populist."
Allen was proceeding to give an account
of his political history, but prefaced his
remarks with an apology for his interfer
ence in the "exhibition" of the Senator
from New York. ' ,
"The what?" asked Hill in astonish
ment. \ ' '"',-. -.j '' -'
"Your speech, I should perhaps say,"
replied Allen sarcastically.
. "Yes, that's better," replied Hill.
Allen then went on to tell the Senate
how he had voted first for Lincoln, then
twice for Grant, whereupon Gear arose
and congratulated him on being right that
far in his political career.
Gear again congratulated Allen upon the
fact that be had been all right in at least
four of the votes he had cast for the Pres
idency. So far as Mr. Weaver was con
cerned, he was simply a confiscationist,
and believed in confiscating the railroads,
telegraphs, - telephones and other great
works that belonged to private individuals
or corporations.
. Allen replied with intense emphasis that
Mr. Weaver was one of the most distin
guished citizens of the United States and
he denied that he believed in the doctrine
of confiscaton. That statement "of the
Senator from lowa Allen characterized as
false. . Â. .. ... V.. V, -. â ",..'".;
Gear retorted that Weaver stood in that
campaign and stood to-day on the Ocala
platform. He believed in . the right of the
Government to seize all railroads, tele
graph lines and other public works and
pay for the same with an unlimited issue
of paper money. That, Gear - said, was
nothing short of confiscation. Gear said
Weaver was a citizen of his (Gear's) own
State and he had heard nim make such
declarations and the statement that the
Senator from lown now made was true.
He .would leave ;, the Senator from Ne
braska to dispute that matter and the in
terpretation of the Ocala . platform with
Mr. Weaver himself.
:- "No," said Allen fiercely and bitterly.
"I will not dispute with James B. Weaver
himself. I dispute with the Senator from
lowa. He is in this chamber. I am his
equal here and elsewhere for that matter.
He can't stand and utter falsehoods of that
kind against one of the greatest and most
illustrious citizens of the United States be
cause be happens to be a Populist, and go
unwhipped ; of '. the , rebuke his language
justly and necessarily deserves."
Instantly Hoar jumped to his feet, called
Allen to ; order and demanded j that his
words ;be taken down. J Faulkner moved
that \ Allen be permitted to proceed in
order, whereupon Hoar made the point of
no quorum . and the call of the Senate
proceeded.
v; The words above quoted were read from
the desk and then upon a renewal <xt
Faulkner's motion Allen was permitted to
proceed in order. He yielded to Gear,"tÂ»_w s
said he was willing to leave his record and
political conduct to the people of lowa
who best knew him. He was sorry, how
ever, that he had been drawn into this
altercation, for it only verified the truth of
an old adage, that you could not "touch
pitch without being defiled."
Allen resumed his remarks at the point
where they * had been interrupted, first
paying his respects to his amiable and dis
tinguished friend, the Senator from lowa,
whom he loved with all the love of a son
for his erring father, and to his "exceed
ingly amiable and conscientious friend
from Massachusetts, who kept a kindly
eye upon him so that he should do no dan
gerous thing in the Senate chamber."
Continuing his argument he contended
that Mr. Weaver was not a confiscationist,
but a man, than whom there was no one
in the country better equipped to dis
charge public duties; a lawyer of distinc
tion in many courts where some of the
men in the Senate who sneered at him
would not be permitted totake aback seat.
"The honorable Senator from lowa and
my always amiable friend from Massachu
setts never gave to this country the moral
force and intellectual power that has been
given it by James B. Weaver."
As Allen was proceeding along these
lines he was interrupted by continued
laughter in the chamber and severely de
nounced this conduct.
"We are not laughing at what the Sena
ator says," replied Chandler, with appar
ent sincerity, "but at the way in which he
says it."
Allen yielded to Chandler on a motion
to proceed to executive business, but Hoar,
as he did not expect to be present when
Hill concluded his speech or when a vote
was taken on the resolution, asked leave to
make a few remarks on it. He thought
the resolution perfectly proper, ana sup
ported it. It did not as he understood it
impute any wrongdoing on the part of
any official of the Government, and he
was surprised to find opposition to it. He
would like to know whether the Govern
ment had lost ten or more millions by
selling an issue of bonds to a syndicate as
bad been alleged, and why the money
obtained by the sale of the bonds had been
used for the payment of the ordinary ex
penses of the Government.
Hill stated that on Monday he would
analyze Hoar's remarks and answer them
at length. Hoar said he would be present
on Monday and he would be happy to re
ceive any blast from the Senator. The
Senate at 5:35 o'clock adjourned uutil
Monday.
WORSE THAN a baron robber.
Members of the House Make Bitter Be-
mar lis About Uncle Sam.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.â
was an old-fashioned field day in the
House with radical variations. It was
private bill day, under the rules, when
bills to pay claims arising out of the war,
which in the past afforded opportunity
ana excuse for fighting the battles of the
Rebellion over again, were under consid
eration.
To-day, however, the contest was waged
largely by Republican members, who ad
vocated the payment of the bills reported
by the Committee on "War Claims and
those who favored postponing action, and
some of tbe statements were startling in
their bitterness. Mahon of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the committee, was asked by
Dingley of Maine if the committee was
satisfied of the justice and correctness of a
claim for the payment of which a bill had
been reported: Replying, Mahon re
viewed the action of Congress on these
claims, their' reference to the Court of
Claims for examination and finding of
facts, and passionately declared that Con
gress either ought to pay the claims
recommended by the court or abolish the
court, so that people might know what to
expect.
He declared that the Government was a
great robber of its private citizens, and he
asserted that he would rather have a
pauper owe him $1000 than to be a creditor
of the United States for that amount.
Walker (R.) ; of , Massachusetts was al
most as violent in his denunciation of the
policy which prescribed the payment of
these claims. Dramatically he declared
that no robber baron has ever equaled the
Government of the United States in its
robbery of honest creditors. He attacked
the leaders of the House, charging them
with purposely- preventing the considera
tion of bills for the payment of just claims,
and asserting that extraordinary rulings
of the chair (in committee of the whole)
were resorted to to aid in carrying out that
policy. â 
McCall(R.)of Tennessee and Evans (R.)
of Kentucky appealed to the House to pay
the claims of loyal men from the South,
and Ray (R.) of New York charged that to
enter upon the payment of them would
compel the next administration to issue
bonds from beginning to close.
Dockery (D.) ol Missouri and Grosvenor
(R.) of Ohio made political speeches in
connection with their common opposition
to the payment of the claims, the former
asserting that Republican legislation in
the past and the latter that tne present
administration, was responsible for the
present condition of the treasury. The
net result of the day's discussion was the
rejection of one "bill and the passage of
another.
The bill passed granting a pension of $50
a month to Josephine *Toote Fairfax,
widow of Admiral Fairfax, and on this
measure Loud (R.) of California, who is
opposed to granting large pensions to the
widows of officers, demanded the ayes and
noes. On a vote by tellers the ayes and
noes were refused and the bill passed.
â  Tickler (K.) of South Dakota reported
the general pension bill prepared by the
Committee on Invalid Pensions, and it was
recommitted.
At 4:50 o'clock the House took recess
until 8 p. m., the evening session to be for
the consideration of private pension
bills.

INACCURACY OF

Grave Suspicion Is Thrown
on the Claims of the
English.
GOV. LIGHT'S LETTER.
One Vital Paragraph Suppressed
in the Argument Made by
Salisbury.
LIMITS OF BRITISH GUIANA.
Now the Venezuelan Commission May
Doubt the Truthfulness of the
Whole Volume.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 18.-The
Venezuelan Government has laid before
the high commission an authenticated
document, secured recently among the of
ficial records of the colony of British
Guiana, which throws grave suspicion on
the accuracy of the Salisbury blue book,
upon which England expressed a willing
ness to rest her claim to the disputed ter
ritory.
The document in question is the letter
from Governor Light of the colony to the
Marquis of Normandy, dated July 15, 1869,
transmitting a report from Schomburgk
regarding his travels under the auspices
of the Royal Geographical Society. In
the British blue book part of the letter is
quoted, but the following vital paragraph
is suppressed : "I shall observe there are
no documents in the archives of the col
ony respecting the western or southern
limits of British Guiana.
"The memoir of Mr. Schomburgk is there
fore valuable; it confirms the .opinion of
the Superintendent of Essequibo as to the
western limits, and points out what may
be fit subjects for discussion with the dif
ferent Governors whose territories border
on British Guiana. The Colombian Gov
ernment is desirous of ascertaining their*"
The fact here established that there
were no documents in the- archives of the
colony respecting the western or southern
limits of British Guiana at that critical
period when both Brazil and Colombia
were resisting the final encroachments of
England, in the opinion of those now
studying the question, seriously weakens â 
the British contention.
-Under ordinary circumstances the great
mass of these archives quoted in the blue
book might have had ""weight with the
high commission, but the discovery of fal
sification in quoting an English letter has
thrown a cloud over all the wages and the
book and the entire publication is regarded
with distrust.
MISS EFFIE PERRINI, of Salinas.
0 ALINAS, MONTEREY COUNTY, CAL.
âI never have met a more enthusiastio
class of people than I did in Salinas, and,
in fact, all through Monterey County. One
of the most pleasing gentleman with whom
1 talked is Mr. George Perrini. He told
me that be had heard of many remarkable
cures that had been effected by the use of
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and that he
had occasion to prove this to his own ad-
vantage.
Some time ago his little daughter, Effie
Perrini. was covered with email sores. A
bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla was
bought and very moderate doses were given
to the little girl. Before the entire bottle
was exhausted all the sores had disap-
peared and Effie got better. She continued
to improve until she is now a perfectly
healthy child. He told me that he had
recommended Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
to many people and that every one was
now praising the native remedy.

PLUNGER, GONE
Death of the Most Daring
Operator in the Chicago
Wheat Pit.
A NAPOLEON OF BEARS.
Made the Biggest Fortune That
Was Ever Taken From
the Market.
BEAT OLD HUTCH IN FUTURES.
On One Occasion the Absence of His
Wife Prevented His Utter
Ruin.
CHICAGO, 111., April Edwin Par- |
dridge of the Board of Trade firm of C. W.
<fc E. Pardridge. the reigning king of
plungers in the wheat pit, died this morn
ing at his Prairie-avenue residence from
Bright's disease after an acute illness of ten
days.
He was 60 years of age. He leaves a
widow and five children. He lost a for
tune a year and a half ago and was com
pelled to sell a State-street store building
for $750,000 to provide himself with ready
money after he had scraped together
several hundred thousand dollars to keep
pace with the rising wheat market.
The plunger determined to hypothecate
his real estate, which was worth several
millions of dollars, but fortunately for him
his wife was in Europe and' mortgages
were valueless as collateral without her sig
nature. This chance saved him from utter
ruin.
His gains in one year were estimated by
conservative operators at $1,500,000 and his
losses in memorable squeezes were from
$600,000 to $800,000. He was always a bear
speculator.
In one hour he was short 15,000,000
bushels of wheat, and there were many
anxious faces in the pit. The market rose
5, 8 and 10 cents, but the i\apoleon of the
bears stood out on the greater part of his
15,000,000 bushels. He predicted a rapid
decline of the bolstered market, and it
came so quickly there was no cover left for
the bulls. The fortune he made thereby
was the biggest that one man had ever
taken from the market.
During the Grid's Fair he sold 20,000,
--000 bushels of wheat without having one
bushel to deliver, and he beat "Old Hutch"
in gambling on the future price.
LOUD'S PLAN APPROVED
Report to Be Made on the Scheme
for Economic Post
age.
Expense of an Order by Mail to Be
Borne by the Receiver Instead
of the Sender.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.â The
House Committee on Postoffices and Post
roads to-day ordered a favorable report on
.the bill of Loud of California to extend
the uses of the mail service by providing
for what is termed the economic postage
system, the object of which is to enable
the Economic Postage Association to fur
nish the trades people of the United States
a convenient and cheap method of solicit
ing trade by mail and the public a conve-
n ient and inexpensive method of placing
orders.
To accomplish these purposes the asso
ciation asks the use of the United States
mails under such provisions as will give
absolute security as to payment of postage
to the Government and under such rules
and regulations as may be prescribed by
the Postmaster-General. It is the in
tention to furnish business men with the
coupon cards and envelopes of this asso
ciation for trade purposes and it is desired
to allow the postage upon all such cards
and envelopes to be paid through the asso
ciation at the office of delivery.
The effect of this legislation will be to
place the expense of an order by mail on
the receiver instead of on the sender. It
is claimed that all such business for the
service would give an annual increase of
$30,500,000 net postal revenue as a result
of the adoption of this new system.

nal says this morning: A dispatch was
received in this city yesterday from Phila

man Sovereign and General Secretary-
Treasurer Hayes of the Knights of Labor
are about to resign from- the order. â 
Hayes and. Sovereign are bitter, enemies,
and it is said that Hayes is afraid that if he
retires before Sovereign the latter will fill
important posts from .the Sovereign fac
tion and then retire. The reason for
Hayes'; resigning is that he has a lucra
tive positron in a gas company and "wants
to give all his time to it. Sovereign, it is
said, wants to resign because he is tired of
the way matters are running, with the
treasury of the order in a low condition.

NICARAGUA CANAL ROUTE
It Is Explained to the House
Committee by Civil Engineer
Endicott.
This Government Should Favor the
Project as a Military Ne
cessity.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 17.â Civil
Engineer M. T. Endicott, who was one of
the board of engineer oflicers which
investigated the Nicaragua canal route
last summer, appeared before the
House Commerce Committee to-day
and detailed the work performed at
Nicaragua. While he regarded the com
pany's plans as impracticable, he did not
doubt that a canal could be built. He be
lieved a canal along the line of the pro-
posed route to be practicable, and thought
that when completed it would meet all ex
pectations, i
Speaking of the canal from a military
rather than a commercial standpoint, he
expressed the belief that in the event of
war with England the United States would
have to abandon it, not being strong
enough now to hold it. If the United
States possessed the naval strength of
Great Britain it could easily be main
tained. The canal, he thought, would
cost $133,000,000, not counting interest on
the money invested. With that amount
the Government could construct a canal
with a navigable depth of twenty-eight
feet.
Mr. Endicott was asked if the modifica
tions suggested by the board were adopted
he would still advise that the Government
should construct the canal. He replied
that he would if the Government proposed
building the waterway. He thought the
United States ought to own a canal con
necting the waters of the Atlantic and the
Pacific. This was really a military neces
sity. He did not know of any route more
favorable than the one uuder considera
tion.

Team on the Fast Track at
Coronado.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., April 17.â Seven
world's records were captured to-day by
the racing team under the management of
B. H. Gleezen at the Coronado track.
The strength of the team seems to be F.
E. Schefski, the young athlete of Salt
Lake, and his performance to-day in his
one-third-mile race against time stamped
him as a game rider.
He sprang both cranks of his wheel in
starting, and this caused him to strike
both ankles at every revolution of the
sprockets. When he finished with the
world's record for the distance to his
credit blood was streaming into his shoes.
The time was 3 1-5 seconds better than his
own previous record and four-fifths better
than Hamilton made at Coronado a few
weeks ago. The records made to-day are
as follows:
One-third of a mile, standing start, unpacedâ
F. E. Schefski of Salt Lake. Time, :37 4-5;

afternoon train from the north yesterday
brought to Los Angeles a stylishly dressed
young man who hied away to one of the
leading hotels of the city, where he left his
baggage and then sauntered out upon the
street. Later in the day he called at the
Santa Fe ticket oflice and negotiated for a
ticket to the East.
In the meantime Chief Glass received a
telegram from Captain Lees to lookout
out for a young man named J. A. McLure,
who is wanted in San Francisco for for
gery. Detectives Bradish and Steele were
detailed upon the case and were soon on
the trail of the young man who had left
his baggage at a certain hotel. Between 7
and 8 o'clock last evening the officers
found their man in front of the Chamber
of Commerce, where he was taking in the
sights. .;,.' yyyy,^

asked them if they could not be "fixed,"
but he did not know the men he was deal
ing with and in a short time he was locked
up in the city jail. . 'â¢ â  . y'y ;

Lure when another telegram was handed
to Chief Glass from Chief Crowley asking
the Los Angeles Chief to look out for
another young man . named G. W. Per
sons, who is also wanted in San Francisco

Persons would probably arrive in Los An

scoured the city and soon secured his man
on Broadway and lodge I him in jail, yy ;
. The extent of the forgeries these men
are wanted for is not known here, but from
the tone of the San Francisco telegrams it
is evident that they are something above
! the ordinary. McLure is about 30 - and
Persons is about 23. McLure is said to

FLED FROM LOS ANGELES.
Frank Baldwin Took Money Belonging
to His Employers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 17.â Frank
Baldwin, one of the best-known young
men in Los Angeles and who has held
many positions of trust, has been missing
since Monday and his friends admit that
he has fled the country, taking with him
several hundred dollars belonging to the
firm with which he is connected. y â¢-%
A short time ago, in company, with Will
R. Teale, for a long time connected with
the State Loan and Trust Company, the
firm of the Baldwin-Teale Company was
established! The new firm opened iup a
collecting and real estate agency, did a
good business and everything was moving
along smoothly until last Tuesday, when
Baldwin tailed to put in an appearance.
Teale was loth to believe that Baldwin
had skipped until he made inquiries at
the First National Bank, where they had
between $400 and $500 deposited. Teale
learned that Baldwin had drawn all the
money on deposit with the exception of
$19.': â ":,â¢â 
Baldwin was until recently chief clerk in
the Street Superintendent's office.
-y His people are numbered among the
most respected residents of I Los Angeles,
and Baldwin himself has always been
looked upon as a model young man. Fred
Teale, City Auditor, brother of Will R.
Teale, was* backing the firm financially.
Monday morning Will. R. Teale found a
note-on his desk from. Baldwin to the
effect that he. had gone to San Diego on
business. After discovering that Baldwin
had drawn the money, from the bank the
books of the firm \ were gone over, and a
shortage of $313 was discovered, y 'y

She Threatens Dr. MacGowan With More
Horse- Whipping.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 17.â Mrs.
Robertson, the woman who yesterday at
tacked Dr. D. G. MacGowan with a horse
whip, evidently does not propose to let
the matter drop without another effort to
accomplish her purpose. The. doctor to
day received a note from the woman as
follows: "I warn you not to say anything
further about the insanity theory," inti
mating; that there would be more horse
whipping if he attempted to prove her in
sane. .;' '- -* . y â 
Friends of the doctor urge him to swear
to a complaint charging her with insanity,
and it is probable that be will do this if
Mrs. Robertson continues her warlike
demonstrations. His friends assert that a
legal investigation will clear the doctor of
whatever suspicion may attach to him as
having given cause for the woman's at
tack. li-y '':r-yy

ROSS' FARCE PRESENTED

Students Appear in Comedy Roles

Nor Professor.
GOOD-HUMORED LOCAL HITS.
The Play a Burlesque on University
Lfeâ Succ:s> cf the Annual
"Prcm."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
Junior â devoted entirely to the
junior class exercisesâ opened, as usual,
with the circulation of printed and type
written circulars containing "take-offs"
on nearly even* junior in the class, as
well as on eccentric individuals in other
classes. Th s? circulars are always gotten
out anonymously, so there is no one re
sponsible for the sting which many an un
fortunate is made to feel. Most of the
"grinds" were good-humored, but there is
often a tendency to malice in them. Some
of the hittees this morning were around
looking for the hitter, but that individual
was not to be found, so no physical pun
ishment could be wreaked upon him.
The farce called "A Stanford Deal" was
presented in the morning in the Encina
gymnasium, where the opera "Said Pa
sha" was recently given. The interior of
the building was handsomely decorated in
class colors and ornamented with ever
greens. A crowd of students and nearly
all the faculty members, with their wives,
were in attendance, and the building was
well filled. The farce-comedy was the
work of a member of the class of '97, J. M.
Ross. Mr. Ross is one of Stanford's rep
resentatives for the 'intercollegiate debate
next week. His work as writer and de
bater has already attracted considerable
attention here, and his farce was chosen
as the best of the five presented in compe
tition.
The whole play was a typical college
creation, based on college political corrup
tion and abounding in digs at a number of
professorsâ even Dr. Jordan coming in for
his share; shafts sent at vulnerable points
of well-known students, whose hobbies
were caricatured to a dot, and a general
ridiculing of many features of college
life. All the professors took the jokes
on themselves in good part, and the audi
ence was kept in constant merriment. The
committee of the class of '97 that made
the selection of the farce included Miss
Rose Payne, Harry Z. Osborne, H. R.
Straight, Chris Henne, J. H. Timmons
and Francis W. Lake, chairman.
The synopsis of" scenes oi the play was
as follows:
Act Iâ Dining-room of the Redwood Hotel.
Act llâ Moonlight promenade on the quadrangle.
Act lllâ Roble reception. â¢-;â¢;â ?
Act IVâ Ski Hi fraternity house.
One of the features of the farce was the
scenery, that of the second act being a
very good imitation of the interior of the
Stanford quadrangle.
The cast of characters was as follows, all
of the principals being juniors:
Dick Sharp, who likes to pull wires F. W. Lake
Clarence Stanwood, a typical college man
and member of the Ski 111 fraternity
_ ..Chester A. Tbomas
Fred Thurston, Stanwood's chum and -frat"
brother Walter M. Mcintosh
Willie Wobbles, who loves his mamma and his
_ "frat".. j. m. Koss
Professor Musty, D.D., Ph.D., etc., who is op
posed to political corruption W. c. Price
Bob Rusher ( c. B. Diehl
Ned Swlper -Sharp's co-workers,' Evans Holbrook
Roy Erwin ) (.R. S. Dart
Alizannah Wobbles, who is unlike her brother
. â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ Alice E. Wheeler
Leslie Donovan, who loves politics for Dick's
sate Alice 1. Cowen
Waiters, fratmen, Roble maids, etc.
Dick Sharp, with his coworkers, plans to
capture all lucrative offices in the next
student election. To succeed, they need
the support of Willie Wobbles of the Ski
Hi fraternity and Professor Musty, but
unfortunately they are at outs with the
"frat" and Professor Musty is known to
be hostile to combines. While the schemers
are laying their plans in the Redwood
Hotel they are interrupted by Ski Hi
"Irat" men, who are initiating Willie Wob
bles and some others into their mysteries.
The plotters withdraw unseen and the
"frat" msn end their hilarity by packing
off all the furniture on the place. Sharp
has noticed all this from a secret place,
and as the hotel proprietor will not be
lieve the Ski Hi's are the guilty parties,
Dick Sharp is the only person who coula
place the information in the hands of a
constable, who is out with a warrant.
Sharp uses his power on the Ski Hi's and
is pledged their support. Professor Musty
is secured by intimidation, it being insin
uated to him that his trip to Mr. Stanford's
vineyard with two big baskets had been
observed and would be made public if he
refused his support. . .
Sharp gives his scheme away to his co-ed
helper, .Leslie, and she, in a pique at his
supposed neglect, gives Stanwood infor
mation which defeats Sharp's plans, y â ;'
All the parties took their roles with
great success, and the grotesque situation
was highly appreciated by the spectators.
The junior "prom" was held in Encina
gymnasium this evening. The walls were:
draped and . divans . were placed in cozy
arbors ; for the dancer. The work of ar
ranging the details of the "prom" fell
largely on Harry C. Hazzard, chairman of
the "prom, committee, and on Chris
Henne, the class president. The success
of the function was largely dee to these
men. Henne was indefatigable in making
the entire programme a success. The
dances were twenty-lour in number. About
fifty couples were on the floor at one time
during the evening. .

CAPAY VALLEY AROUSED
Feeling Against McMillan May
Result in an Attack
Upon Him.
Residents Angered Because He Seized
the Land of the Man His
Sons Killed.
WOODLAND, Cal., April 17.â Deputy
Sheriff Hugnes returned to-night from the
scene of the Maxwell murder, in the foot
hills near Capay. He reports that the
feeling in that vicinity against McMillan,
the father of the boys who did the shoot
ing, is bitter, and<!s likely to break out at
any moment. McMillan's attempt to
jump the dead man's claim as soon as his
death was reported has incensed the peo
ple almost to desperation. That McMillan
has been spared thus far is because" the
evidence against him is not positive.
The McMillan boys, who are mere lads,
stoutly deny that the shooting was done
intentionally. When questioned to-day
by the officers the elder boy said that he
shot at a bird and that Maxwell, whom he
did not notice, was in direct range. It
was through fear that he ran away when
he realized what he had done, instead of
going to the old man's assistance. No ar
rests have as yet been made, but the Dis
trict Attorney has the matter in hand.
FERNDALE'S MARSHAL SUED.
Litigation Affecting the Rights of Ittner-

FERNDALE, Cal., April 17.â A suit
affecting the rights of canvassers and
itinerant salesmen has been instituted in
the United States Circuit Court at San
Francisco by F. P. Holfschulle, a young
book canvasser representing P. H. Collier
of New York, against Frederick Doe, Mar
shal of FerndaJe, for $6000 damages.
Holfschulle alleges false imprisonment, he
having been arrested by the Marshal on
a complaint riled before the Recorder,
James Smith, charging him with violating
an ordinance requiring canvassers and
solicitors to first secure a license.
Holfschulle came to Ferndale about a
year azo. A license fee was demanded of
him. He refused to pay and was arrested
and fined $20. The fine was paid under
protest, and again he proceeded to can
vass. He was arrested a second time and
fined $40, which was also paid after he
had been in custody for some time. The
next morning he left the town and after
an interval of some months the suit was
commenced.
FRESNO CROPS BLIGHTED.
Damage Done in Vineyard and Orchard
by Frosts.
FRESNO, Cal., April 17. â This, the
great raisin center of California, was
visited by another killing frost last night,
which blighted most of the first crop of
raisin grapes for thiÂ» year. The Malagas
suffered most, and it is almost certain that
there will be few high-grade layers mar
keted from Fresno next autumn. The
largest vineyards, being unprotected by
surrounding trees, suffered the most. It
is expected that the second or later crop
will be increased by this misfortune, but
thes. raisins are always inferior and much
below the others in price. 'â .â¢'â ;
The damage to peaches, apricots, pears
and apples has also been great in most of
the colonies surrounding Fresno. In the
foothills, where the cold seemed most se
vere, apples and peaches are said to be al
most totally destroyed. The weather haÂ«
moderated to-day and no further damage
â is anticipated.

The Umatilla's Captain
Gives His Passengers
a Fright.
DEATH OF A LEVIATHAN
While Taking a Nap It Is Cut
in Twain by the Prow of
the Steamer.
DISMAY IN THE DINING-ROOM.
Dishes and Their Contents Scattered
in All Directions by the
Shock.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., April 17.â
Captain" J. C. Hunter, master of the steamer
Umatilla, has had many experiences in
his life on the sea, but the strangest of
all came last evening as he was carefully
guiding his vessel around the treacherous
rocks of Cape Flattery and into the straits.
The vessel was proceeding under easy
steam, when the outlook forward reported
something floating that looked like an
overturned schooner. The Umatilla's
powerful glasses were at once turned on
the wreckage, and the experienced eye of
Captain Hunter told him it was nothing
but a whale, although it was a monster.
It was the work of a moment to decide
what to do, and Captain Hunter swung
the Umatilla around on a bee line with
the sleeping monster and rang down to
the engine-room for full speed. The Uma
tilla answered quickly and was soon leap
ing through the water toward the levi
athan. A moment later and the vessel
struck the whale, and for about ten sec
onds there was oil poured on troubled
waters. The passengers felt the lurch of
the craft and rushed on deck in time to
see the two ends of the half-severed mam"
mal dangling at the prow of the steamer.
The force of the blow had not driven the
steamer entirely through the whale, and,
in preference to pushing the remains into
Victoria, Captain Hunter backed away
from it. Then it could be seen that the
whale was one of the humpback variety,
over fifty feet in length. Several camera
"fiends" were aboard, and secured good
negatives of the unusual sight.
There were four passeneers on deck at
the time the whale was struck, but it did
not take long for all to get there. The
bump against the sleeping monster sent
soup and tea flying in all directions in the
dining-room, and it looked for a time as
though there was going to be a : panic.
Everything quieted down as soon as the
passengers were informed of the cause of
the shock.
HORSES CAUSE TROUBLE.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., April 17.â
The brigantine Blakeley leases here early
to-morrow morning for Alaska, unless
held by legal process, which now seems
probable. The vessel left Seattle with a
select party of tourists and miners, who
wanted an outing, and all paid fare in ad
vance. On arrival here they found that
sixteen horses were to be put on board and
all the passengers rebelled.
After two days' parley the matter was
finally compromised this evening by the
return of half fare to two passengers who
refused to go with the horses, and now
two others are demanding the return of
their full fare and are taking legal steps to
detain the vessel unless their demand is
complied with.
The report has been received here by
carrier pigeon that the steamer Lakme,
which left Port Townsend crowded with
freight and passengers for Cooks Inlet,
was leaking when the pigeon was released,
285 miles northwest of Cape Flattery.
CHIEF LLOYD ARRESTED.
Another Move of the Accused
Gold-Brick Swindler
Root
Oakland's Chief of Police Appre
hen_ed, bat Released on a One
Collar Bond.
OAKLAND, Cal.; April 17.â One of the
boldest tricks yet played in the history of
the gold-brick swindlers was attempted
to-night, but it failed to work. About 10
o'clock Attorney j Nusbaumer and Deputy
Sheriff AÂ» White marched into the police
station, and the attorney laid his hand on
Chief of Police Lloyd and told him he was
under arrest. *--â '.-.'. '
He turned his prisoner over to the
deputy, and the Chief was taken to the
County Jail, where :he was charged with
felony for having sworn to a misdemeanor
against the goldbrick man, Root, on in
formation and belief.
Chief Lloyd suspected what the game
was, and before leaving the City Hall he
told Captain : - Wilson if bonds were pre
sented for the release of Root to imme
diately rearrest him Â«on suspicion of
felony.. 'â  â  : â  "y'yV,'y
The Chief had not been gone many
minutes before Attorney Reed walked
into the prison and presented bonds for
the release of Root. Bail had . been or
dered for $1000 on each of two; charges.
When the bonds were presented there was
no alternative but to accept them and re
lease ! Root. : He ; was, > however, imme
diately rearrested on suspicion of .felony
and placed back in 5; his cell. ; This is > the
fifth time he has been released and been
rearrested. To-morrow the habeas corpus
mill will be worked for the sixth time.
Chief Lloyd ; was "turned over to the
Sheriff and was shortly afterward released
on a bond for, $1. Every y effort is being
made to hold Root till the Grand Jury
meets Monday. The "only direct evidence
against hira is that of the Dixon banker,
Stephen Little, and as he will not swear to
a complaint; Root can only beheld on an
indictment by the GrandJJury. : Â» â¢â¢
The District Attorney could present Lit
tle's evidence to them as soon "as they as
sembled and an indictment would at once
issue. It is declared by , the Superior
Judges who have already ordered Root's
release ; on habeas y corpus that , tne evi
dence is not sufficient to hold, him and his
attorneys declare that ' his [ frequent arrest
merely to â¢ get;; him j brought within the
jurisdiction of a grand jury an outrage.
y Chief Lloyd will now make more strenu
ous efforts than ever to hold Root till the
Grand Jury meets.
"My arrest was an outrage," said he to
â  -â â -â  â  â â¢â â -..â 
night, "and its object is plainly to be seen.
It was a piece of very evident stupidity to
arrest me to-night, as there was not the
slighest reason to suppose I would leave
town; before a complaint could be sworn
out against me to-morrow and properly
served. But it did not benefit anybody/

So great was the force upon the block that
a heavy post to which it was made fast

through the air a distance of seventy-five
yards.
THE EVERLASTING LIFE
Professor Le Conte Considers
Immortality in the Light
ot Science.
The Belief Would Not Have Survived
the Lapse of Centuries if It
Were Untru?.
Some of the City's leading intellectual
and social lights filled Golden Gate Hall
last night at Professor Joseph Le Conte's
lecture on "Immortality, Considered From
the Standpoint of Science/ The lecture
was given under the auspices of the Cali
fornia Psychical Society, but many not
members, among - the number a goodly
sprinkling of clergymen, were present.
The veteran scientist commenced by'
stating that he had been reluctant to en
ter upon the discussion of the subject of
immortality, since he he had written so
much about it, but on second thought he
had changed his mind, in view of the
probable fact that much that he had said
and written had not been even heard of
by many people. "
"By immortality," he commenced, "I
do not mean the continued existence of
the body, since death is the most certain
of all material phenomena. Nor do I
mean a mere continuous being of the spirit
without a distinct individuality. The
only immortality worth considering is
that of the person. This is the form of
immortality which we intend to speak of.
"The unconscious, impersonal con
tinuity of our spiritual part under the
form of light, or of air, or of heat, would
be of little advantage to us. The person
would be sacrificed and the personality
annihilated. Yet the conviction of per
sonality is rniversal. Now, when does
this germ or principle of immortality take
root in the human being? Is it at the
moment of conception, of quickening, of
i birth, or when the child comes to the use
of reason or undergoes tie experience
: known as regeneration or 'new birth?'
"These are hard questions to answer,
but one truth we must hold to be self-evi
dent: There is a gulf between the human
being and the brute, between the outer
world of sense and the inner world of con
sciousness. The latter world is the
peculiar sphere. of man. Man alone lives
in two worlds; in the outer world of sense
with the brute and in the inner world of
consciousness alone, or, perhaps more
truly, with God. All the great achieve
ments due to the infinite progressiveness
which is a distinctive characteristic of
man must be referred to this principle of
what we may hope is immortality.
"In this connection I assume the truth
of the doctrine of evolution. I further as
sume the fact of the existence of God, and
still further I assume and maintain the
circulation, throughout all nature, of a
divine, self-existent energy. Material in
dividuality is common to man and brute;
but kinetic personality is one of the attri
butes which distinguish the human being
from all inferior creatures, and renders
him like the mysterious, almighty energy
which placed him as ruler over the lower
citizens of â  t c universe. Spirit exists in
many forms, but kinetic entity is the ex
clusive heritage of man and the beings of
a higher order than he.
"The fact of immortality is not a mere
poetic ideal, but a truth which only needs
to be dimly comprehended in order to fill
mankind with a love for that quality
which is the glory of humanity, in the
evolution of the human soul from the
lower phases of spiritual existence we find
some intellectual difficulties. Platonic
view is that souls are fragments of a great
self-existent spiritual principle. The
orthodox view that God created the
material part of man and then breathed
into it the breath of life cannot be enter
tained. The scientific view asserts the
pre-existenee of the soul in embryo, and
at the same time admits its creation by
natural forces.
"By means of the brain we are able to
advance without the confines of things
material and penetrate the mysteries of
another, nobler world. This seems to me
a certain participation in the divine
nature, of which immortality is an essen
tial attribute. The belief in God and in
immortality jis universal, * save : where it
has been overthrown by a shallow, ma
terialistic philosophy. This belief has
persisted until our day, and is at the bot
tom of all or nearly all the nobler traits of
humanity. This belief would not have
survived had it not been true. y
"1 cannot forbear comparing a rational
Christianity with the modern worship of
humanity. The first moral law is the love
of God, the second the love of j humanity.
Rational Christianity recognizes .these
laws and traces their enactment to a per
sonal, all-powerful; infinitely loving God.
Rational Christianity also presents before
us these three views of immortality: first,
the Platonic idea of a self-existent, pre
existing, non-creating and non-created sea
of spirit ; second, the exploded ; orthodox
theory of a material creation' to which life
was imparted from outside, and third, the
scientific conception which believes in the
pre-existence of the soul in embryo and
its creation as a : conscious" personality
through the agency of natural j forces.
This, in my opinion, is the most rational
view.
y. "I have several times referred to God as
a person. The essence of God is beyond
our comprehension ; yet when we^hink of
the almighty ...'power which '% made '} us, we
naturally form an : image in our hearts
and. endow that image with :: all that we
consider most worthy ?of the divinity.
Conscious personality is the highest thing
which the ; human mind can conceive;
hence we God a person, though we
little know .t ether that -finite ; term be
worthy of 'the boundless majesty to which
we owe our being." â >

John Schneider, alias Haller, on a charge
of robbery, was concluded this morning.
Twenty-two minutes after the jury retired
it returned with a verdict finding the de
fendant guilty of the crime of robbery, in
having on January 15 robbed the stage
running from this place to Will its, taking
the express-box and contents, about $17.
Schneider's trial on the charge of having
robbed the same stage on December 31 had
already begun when the verdict in the first
case was returned. After a consultation
with his attorneys the bandit stated his
desire to withdraw his plea of not guilty,
which be had previously entered to the
charge on which he was about to be tried.
Permission was granted by the court, and
he thereupon entered a plea of guilty as
charged in the information. Time for
judgment was waived and the court at
once passed sentence upon Schneider in
both cases, ordering that he be confined
for a term of fifteen years for the crime of
which he had been convicted and five
years for that to which he had pleaded
guilty. San Quentin was fixed by the
court as the place of his incarceration.
Schneider will be examined before Jus
tice Chritchfield to-morrow on a charge of
having assaulted ex-Sheriff Standley with
intent to murder, and, -if held to answer,
the information will at once be filed and
the case tried at this term of court. Since
his plea of guilty this morning Schneider
has confessed, it is said, to Sheriff John
son that he committed the robbery, and
stated that the only thing he was sorry
for was that he had shot Standley. .y-;; ;
Sheriff Johnson claims to have sufficient
evidence in his possession to justify him
in charging Schneider with the murder of
Sheriff Pascoe of Nevada County, one of
the crimes of which Fredericks, who was
recently executed, had been accused.
OREGON RAILWAY SCHEME
Receiver McNeill Petitions fo-
Permission to Complete
a Reorganization.
PORTLAND, Or.. April 17.â Receiver
McNeill of the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company to-day filed a petition in
the Federal court asking for leave to exe
cute the necessary agreements looking to
the adoption of a reorganization plan for
the purpose of avoiding protracted litiga
tion and ending the complications that
have followed the receiver's appointment
in July, 1894. The petition, which has not
been acted upon yet, states that a reorgan
ization plan has been prepared, to which
the different stockholder, have given con
sent. ! [ .' V..y
A reorganization committee composed
of Alfred S. Heidelbach, W. L. Bull,
George Coppell, Charles 8. Fairchild,
Arnold Marcus, John Crosby Brown,
A. A. H. Boissevain and Henry R. Reed
has been appointed, and has arranged
that Master in Chancery McArthur's re
port be abrogated or set aside, McNeill to
assume as net liabilities the sum of
$163,557 21, and the five former receivers
to have credited to them the sum of
$28,000.
Receivers Blank, Mink, Anderson,
Coudert and Doane of the Union Pacific
claimed that McNeill, as their successor,
should assume the entire liabilities in
curred during the months of their admin
istration prior to the appointment of
McNeil, tney asserting that the order ap
pointing McNeill so required. McNeill
Eetiuoned to have the clause in the order
earing such . construction eliminated.
The matter was heard by Special Master
in Chancery McArthur, who sustained
McNeill, placing â¢ the amount to be
assessed by him at $55,122 92. out of a
total liability of $320,807 16. The five re
ceivers appealed, which appeal is now
pending. . .

HEAVY FIRING
Argument in the Martin
Case Is in Full
Sweep.
AN ALL DAY'S TALKING.
The Struggling Crowd Breaks
In the Dcor of the Court-
Room.
THE INTEREST IS INTENSE.
Delmas Pays a Tribute to the Dis-
J trict Attorney and the General
v 7 Expresses Gratification.
Neither the Martin will case at any time
nor the Durrant case very often drew such
a crowd as struggled at the door of Judge
Daingerfield's court yesterday to hear the
arguments of Mr. Delmas and Mr.
Barnes iii the George N. Martin damage
suit against the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Early in the struggle at the door the
glass in the upper panels was broken and
at intervals during the day pieces of it
would go tumbling to the floor of the hall
in a great clatter. Again and again the
Deputy Sheriffs were compelled to clear
the hallway or eject men whose persist
ence outran their discretion in their efforts
to get forward in the crowd.
The whole day was consumed in the ar
guments of the two lawyers, and at 5
o'clock, when a juror, fearful of being
kept in the juryroom all night, suggested
an adjournment Mr. Delmas had only
fairly entered upon his main argument.
â¢ Mr. Delmas' opening consumed about
an hour. He ran through the story, touch-
ing lighly upon the main points, but, as
General Barnes remarked during the five
minutes recess following, "saying as little
about the case as possible and reserving
himself for the finish."
He described his client's visit to the
State upon business, sick at the time, in a
condition where the least shock would be
followed by the most serious illness; of
his being roughly ejected from the car at
a lumber camp; his return in a freight car
to Sacramento; his journey home, and his
medical treatment in Sioux City and after
wards in Chicago; compelled to sell out
his business and now "waiting the dissolu
tion that will come to him as a boon."
"This condition may not have been
caused, but it has been greatly aggra
vated, by the circumstances I have de-
scribed," he said. "For this you are
asked to award him compensation.- The
demand is not for the purpose of punish
ing toe defendant would . that it were.
He asks that you give him $75,000. The
amount seems to have excited the risi-
. bility of the defendants. They have
offered to pay him $139. Both parties are
speaking : from the extreme limit of self
interest. It is for you to judge between
them."
In the course of his address Mr. Delmas
criticizea the position of General Barnes
upon several points, but took occasion to
pay a compliment to the District Attor-
ney, the general's son. ,**!
After a five minutes' recess General
Barnes began, saying that whatever of irri
tation he might have felt in regard to cer
tain reflections of the counsel, it had dis-
appeared under the influence of the eulogy
he had passed upon the District Attorney,
"a young man to whom I am related by
marriage." "Mr. Delmas and I do not
often agree, as you see; but in this regard,
in admiration of this young man, we are
on a common footing," said Mr. Barnes. â¢
He said another pretty thing or two
about the younger Mr. Barnes, reverting
casually to the lengthening of his own
shadow, and this little tribute to his son
before a jury quite caught the audience.
Then he turned to the case. "The
Southern Pacific Railroad has been de-
scribed as a giant," he said. "If it is a
giant it is a giant in rags when it comes
into a courtroom. The average lawyer
leaps forward if he sees the slightest
shadow of a case against the company;
leaps forward to almost a certainty. He
feels that he has the influence of -the daily
press behind him to influence public
opinion, filling the air with misrepresenta
tion of the cause and of the counsel who
may plead it.
"Now let us look at this case. This de
fendant undertook to carry the plaintiff
across the continent, take the best of care
of him, allow him to stop at any station,
all for six-tenths of a ( cent per mile. When
he arrived in San Francisco we find him
in the office of a scalperâ what time
the 4 o'clock train left for Sacramento.
From the sullen young man from Ottin
gc.r's we learned that he offered the ticket
for sale, contrary to hi* agreement.
. The counsel here went into an explana
tion of how the company loses from the
scalper. He then began to follow the acts
of Martin, as presented in the evidence;
that in his debilitated condition, as por
trayed by counsel on the other
side, he took a day coach for his
ride to Sioux City. He was an
old traveler; he knew how to do things.
Martin, he said, had . explained that he
took the day coach during the day with
the purpose of taking a sleeper at night in
case there was a vacant â otherwise
he would sit up all night. He then went
over the history of the signatures, calling
them caricatures.
"He (Martin) says that the conductor,
HubbÂ«Â»rd, treated him well, but was not
satisfied with the signature. Martin says
be -showed him his watch, matchbox, his
gold-headed cane, all bearing his initials.
The conductor says he showed him none
of these things. Nobody else. saw them
except the carpenter going to Sacramento.
He says he saw a gold cane with a round
top. The i cane Martin presents here is a
crook handle, with an inscription of pre
sentation from some orange-growing asso
ciation. Now, that is one of the ugly ele
ments in this case. The fact is he never
had that cane. In all this it looks to me
that this man is- an old-fashioned North
American liar. If that is so I indicate to
you a gentleman who is telling the truth"
(pointing to Conductor Hubbard).
The speaker went over the testimony of
Martin, of how he was roughly ejected
from the car by conductor and brakeman,
who sat him up against the station-house
and, while they jeered at him, motioned
for the train to po on.
He lollowed with the testimony deny
ing this. The speaker characterized : the
subsequent conduct of the plaintiffâ riding
in the caboose of a freight train to Sacra
mento, his trying to sleep in the station,
being put out and walking four blocks
carrying his baggage all as being done
merely to enhance his premeditated plan
to sue for damages. ;". -''./''
"He told the conductor on the train
that he had but $8 or $10, enough to buy
his meals and land him in Sioux City, and
yet when he arrived in tnis City he had
money enough to stop three days at the
Palace Hotel and then buy a new
ticket to Sioux City. On the train orig
inally he was so economical that he took
the day coach, his satchel under the
seat, . no money for sleepers and scarcely
enough to buy meals on his way. During
this whole time, in his interview with Mr.
Ross in the railroad office, or with any
other person, so far as we can learn,
he did not say to any one that he had
been treated in the brutal fashion he
has described. He did not consult
a doctor nor did he so much as buy a dose
of medicine. When he got home he says
he went under medical treatment within j
a few days and so remained under treat
ment for two or three months. That was
his story. We would not have known any
thing to the contrary except for his part
ner, my little friend from Cape Cod. Now,
Mr. Delmas and I do not agree often, as I
have said, but if there is before this bar or
any bar a lawyer who will not allow his
client to tell a lie on the stand if he knows
it, or who will not lead him into error,
that man sits there" (pointing to Mr. Del
mas). "But the testimony of this little
codfish hunting man from Massachusetts
lets us know through my cross-examina
tion h3w instead of being confined
to sea for months he was instead
flitting like a bird from place to place, or
flitting like a bat as you please, from
Sioux City to Boston, to , Cincinnati and
back across the continent to San Fran
cisco to anchor here and Hie a claim for
$75,000 damages. While here he has lived,
practically lived, in that sink of iniquity,
the Midway Plaisance, walking the streets
in the early morning hours with the
creatures who serve beer there. We have
not brought all this into view because we
delight to riot in the misshapen character
of this plaintiff, but because he has pre
sented himself here under a mask."
Slighting reference was made to the
marriage contract of the plaintiff.
"Now, gentlemen, this case has attracted
an amount of attention entirely surprising
to me. It is an ordinary case. This throng
that comes here to witness the contest
between Mr. Delmas and myself you have
nothing to do with. You will take the j
evidence into the jury -room, where there I
is no crowd to laugh or applaud, and ren- j
der your judgment upon it. 1 have been â¢
charged with sneering at this claim of ;
$75,000. I do not know that I have done j
so. â¢ I have a great respect for $75,000. But ;
I have seen cases brought for $.50,000 and
quietly settled for $50. No one expects to
get what they ask for. I ask you to render
judgment upon the evidence alone, and so
1 leave it with you." Â£Â£g
After another interval of five minutes
Mr. Delmas began. Â y ,: .: , y _y
"In the course of , his argument s the
learned counsel has seen fit to refer to the
m arked interest that this case has awak
ened In the public mind; the space given
to it in our public journals," be said.
"The cause, gentlemen of the jury, is not
j far to seek. This matter appeals to every
i one. It is of chief moment to this
i plaintiff, to be sure, but every man has a
! personal interest in it. It is something
! to know if, when a man purchases a rail
i way ticket, leaves his home with certain
i plans. and, taking with him money enough
j for li is purpose, that he is subject to the
whims of the agents of the railroad lines
over which he is to travel ; that he may be
set down at some way-station, 1000 miles
from his .home, in the night-time, and
when he is sick and without friends or ac
quaintances. Every man who would travel
has an interest in this. It is such methods
as this that readily accounts for the un
popularity of this great railroad corpora
tion. A corporation that welds the States
together ; east : and west and widens the
horizon, and . conduces to the spread of
liberty â or should conduce to it â should
be among the most popular institutions of
the country. But it has subverted its
great power until it threatens to under
mine the very Government, and men come
here trembling for fear of incurring its dis-
I pleasure.
"Now I. want you to look over this
I proposition set up here by this corpora
j tion. This plaintiff is charged with hay
! ing a 'game' all through to fleece the
! Southern Pacific Company. It is set up
j as his first and most conspicuous move in
the game that he started East without a
j sleeper. One of the witnesses here, a
j reputable business man of this City, was
going East in exactly the same manner.
So the force of that is lost. Now let me
tell you what the game was.- We â  were
told that Martin's ticket was 'bulletined,'
as they call it in railroad circles. An
agent of the railroad company seems to
have found a place among the
ticket scalpers â possibly at Ottengers'.
When Martin called" there he was
interviewed as to his ticket, and it was
'bulletined'; the company's agents were
warned, the number of it was given to
them and they harassed this man all
along the line and finally put him off the
train near nightfall at a station where he
could get no funds nor medical assistance.
"We were told that we would have evi
dence leading up to this bulletin, and
under that promise the counsel secured a
ruling from his Honor. Of course the
counsel meant to do as he said, but we
did not get the evidence. Either it did
not come to hand or, coming, was of such
a nauseating character that his heart
failed him and he did not dare present it.
"I am free <o admit that ; Martin .is not
an angel. Thank God, there are others.
There are other ) men who are wholly
â¢ human. Martin is not of that pure and
ethereal character necessary to enter the
service of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. I have no doubt that all that
force from Huntington down have incip
ient wings growing under their coats.
Other men may lie, but they never do;
other men may cheat, but . they, never
do; other men may make false reports of
their affairs to the Assessor, . but they
never do." ...
The speaker dwelt with some warmth on
the reference of the other side to the mar
riage contract. Until a couple â¢ of ' years
ago that form of marriage was lawful in
this State. It was changed because of the
developments in a .trial in which the
learned counsel was on one side, and was
intended to prevent another Sharon case
in this State. '.;"''
*. But while the counsel may champion
the marriage in thechurch, the wedding
march sounding down .'. cathedral aisles,
there may be those who, in the simplicity
of their two hearts, do not desire such,
or could not afford it if they did. They
may not choose to be wiser than the law,
either. . , >
"The direct inference from the'argu
ment here is that this man's wife is not a
| good woman. By .what right is such an !
unwarranted inference imparted here.
What possible relevancy has it?" ;aid the
speaker. â â¢â¢â ..-
Referring to suits against the railroad
the speaker said: "It is not a profitable
business. Even the successful litigant is
more often than not made to regret that
he undertook it. What with appeals and
possible reversals yit "is ri a long and
tedious - road ;at /best. The company
brings , its -whole strength to bear to teach
the daring man how hazardous a thing it
is to ; confront it. But* men do at such
times insist upon their rights, ana then
the â whole ; detective force is turned upon ;
such a one, and every indiscretion of his
youth, every family quarrel, every misstep,
every ghost in his- closet that has been
guarded from the public eye, is dragged
out to gibber in the night."
; The speaker was dissecting the evidence
anent the handwriting that caused all the
.trouble when the court adjourned. r

A comparison of the figures shows that
the gold yield of the State for the year 1895
increased over that of 1894 by $1,471,035 80
and the silver product increased $302,
--485 15, a total increase of precious metals
in California for the year over the previ
ous one of $1,773,49395. Considering the
increase of 1894 over 1893 the annual , gold
product of the State has increased $2,795,
--538 in two years. In the following table is
shown the increase or decrease of product
of 1895 with relation to the previous year

Unapportioned
.in these tables the . "unaoportioned"
refers to bullion from sulphurets, etc.,"
sent to Denver or the Puget Sound reduc
tion works from the mines of this State.
"It will be seen that there have been
some marked changes in the relative
standing of thâ¢ counties as regards bullion
product. In 1894 Calaveras County yielded
over $2,000,000 and headed the list of gold
producing counties. Next came Placer
County, followed by Nevada, Amador and
Trinity. For 1895 Nevada County beads
the list, leading both Calaveras and Placer,
which the year. previous exceeded it. The
order this year is Nevada first, Calaveras
second, Placer third, Amador fourth and
Trinity fifth.'. No. other counties produced
over a million; dollars. Nevada thus re
gains Â the precedence : it held for many
years as the ; first ' of the gold-producing
counties of the State. Â£._â -.
It is worthy of ; note that the three conn
ties of the State which showed the largest
yield in 1894 all show a falling off of prod
uct in 1895, and the largest producer shows
the largest falling off. In the latter case
the reduction is doubtless due to the fire
in the Utica mine, which .closed, it down
some little time. .As this is the largest
producing mine in Calaveras County and
in the State its stoppage of work for a time
had a marked effect on the gold product.
Several . of -the â counties show a .very
marked *'- increase 'â  ,'-. in y product, nota
bly, El r Dorado, Butte, Mono, Riverside, 1
Shasta, Siskiyou, Trinity, and Tuolumne!
It will be noted that the mining counties
in the southern part of the State are com
ing to the front as much; larger producers
than, formerly. ;â¢;. y; ; t . .; â¢
Of course a great deal of gold comes from
the smaller ; operations in -. the different
counties, though each county has "one * or
more large producers to help it out. In
Amador County the Kennedy is : the larg
est producer and in Butte County the Gold
Bank mine. In Calaveras the Utica is the
largest, and probably the largest produc
ing gold mine in the United States. In
El Dorado County the leading - producers
are the Idlewild, Church, Grand Victory
and Gentle Annie. In Inyo County the
largest : silver producers are the Sorba,
Newton, Union and Minietta, In Kern
the mines at White River and those in
Amalie and the Goler districts are doing
best. In Madera and Los < Angeles the
product is all from small operations, and
the same may be said of Mariposa, though
some large companies will be producing
there this year. In Mono the. Standard
Consolidated at Bodie, and the Jackson
and Lakeview at Lundy, are the largest
producers. At Bodie ' about $200,000
came last year from tailings worked
by the cyanide process. Nevada
County's largest producers are the
North Star, Maryland, Original, Em
pire, W. Y. O. D., North Bloomfield.
Providence. Champina. In Placer the
largest producers are the gravel mines.
Among those showing the greatest yield
are the Golden River drift, Mammoth Bar,
Mayflower, Paragon, Morning Star, Big
Dipper, Hidden. Treasure, etc. In quartz
the Pioneer and Lynn and Hathaway lead.
In Plumas County the large producers are
mainly gravel. Riverside , County has its
best mines at Perris, where the largest
producers are the Good Hope and Santa
Rosa. At Banning, too, are some good
mines. From Sacramento the mines
around Folsom and Michigan Bar give the
greatest yield. In -San Bernardino the
Silver King properties at Calico are the
largest j silver, producers. At Hedges, in
San Diego County, is the Golden : Cross
mine, which is the largest producer j in the
county. In Shasta the largest producers
are the Texas Consolidated and the Uncle
Sam mines, though the Iron Mountain
mines are expected to be this year. In
Sierra County the mine making the largest
yield is- the. Feather Fork. In Si'kivou
are many small claims, the most of "the
mines being gravel. â¢ The Black Bear is
the largest producing quartz mine. Among
the gravel mines with good yield are the
Summerville, Bentz Bar, Owens & Sells,
Pinery, Grider, China, Lem, Eastlick,
Wright & Fletcher, Golden & Evelith, etc.
In Trinity the largest quartz mine is the
Brown Bear, and the largest gravel mines
the La Grange and the . French company's
claim at Junction City. , In Tuolumne the
largest producer is the Rawhide.
The showing for the year as made v out
by , Statistician Vale .at the Mint -is â¢ a
very satisfactory one for the mines of Cali
fornia. These figures settle the vexed
question as to which of the two States of
California or Colorado furnished the most
gold last year. The State Geologist of
Colorado only claims $15,000,000 for his
State, and he claimed all that he could.
California's yield is consideraDly above
this and will doubtless be from $1,500,000
to $2,000,000 more this year, because many
mines have been put in the hands of capit
alists this season which are being developed
on a large scale and will be soon at a pro
ducing, stage. Meantime many other
claims are being opened in a smaller way
and all j over the State there is intense
mining activity, greater, indeed, than has
been the case in the past twenty years.
1 DEVELOPMENT OF ART.
A Society for This Purpose Formed
After the Parisian Idea.
A movement has been started to organize
in this City, a society on the same basis as
La Societe dcs Amis dcs Arts :of Paris,
under the auspices of the directors of the
San Francisco Art Association.
Members of the ; Art Association .who
subscribe $5 as a minimum and non-mem
bers who subscribe $10, shall for each sub
scriptionregarded as the unitâ be en
titled to one chance in the drawine to be
made on the closing night iof the exhibi
tion. For instance, if $1000 be subscribed,
the proper committee. will select : pictures
for that amount from ; the exhibition for
that year, and will distribute them to the
members by lot on the closing night.
â  By this plan it ; is believed the artists
will find a sale for ; their pictures, that in
terest .in their work and in the associa
tion's exhibitions will be stimulated" and
a means of patronizing art and securing
pictures be brought within the means
of all. .' , - ; y
This is thought to be one of the best
means there is for developing art in a new
community. As an evidence of the inter
est already taken in the project the follow
ing list of subscribers is given : Â -y

WILL SOON COME
BEFORE COURT.
Fair's Pencil Will All
i
Ready to Be Pro
bated.
ISSUES CLEARED AWAY.
An Open Field to Try the Merits
of the Famous Docu
ment.
FORCED TO TAKE A STAND.
The Litigation Narrowing to the Point
of the Validity of the Later
Instrument.
The Fair case is getfing down to what
lawyers call definite issues. Not that the
issues which have already come before the
court are in any way indefinite, but many
of them have had but a distant bearing on
the main question as to which of the
two documents proposed for probate was
really the last will of James G. Fair.
There have been collateral issues enough
to keep forty lawyers busy, all lending a
little mist to befog the main case, and so
it was decided that before the main ques
tions for the court to pass upon were pre
sented all these outside matters should be
cleared away. To this end the hours of
Judge Slack's afternoon yesteraay were
taken up with demurrers to petitions, to
contests and to applications, and motions
to dismiss, to set aside, to deny and over
rule, to continue, to amend and to strike
out.
There was considerable progress made.
The weakling branches were cleared away
and the graver questions were put in shape
for final decision on next Friday. These
main questions include the application
and supplemental application for the pro
bate of the will of; September 21, 1894â the
"stolen will." The applications are by the
executors and administrators named in
that will, y :: â¢;
This will have to lapse, however, until
the more pressing questions included in
that part of the litigation surrounding the
"pencil will," the will of September 24,
1894, have been determined. These ques
tions are an application by Dr. Marc Lev
ingston, an executor named in the "pencil
will," demanding its probate, and un ap
plication of Mrs. Theresa A. Oelrichs and
.Virginia Fair to the same effect. There is
then the contest of Charles Fair to the
"pencil will." , That is an action which
comes up with the application for probate,
for upon the rise or tall of this contest de
pends the existence ofthe will. \
There is another contest pending, how
everâthat of Herman Oelrichs Jr. and of
Wesley Crothers, a grandnephew of James
G. Fair. It is contended that Herman
Oelrichs Jr. has no interest in the pro
ceedings and he must, therefore, establish
his right to appear in the- matter before
he can fight the pencil will. .
The proceedings, of yesterday were
opened by ex-Judge Van R. .? aterson,
who, on behalf of six jj Lundy heirs, seven
Fair heirs, several more Crothers ' and
young Herman Oelrichs, filed a contest to
the pencil will. > ,
In it the allegations were made that the
will of. September 24, 1894, was not the last
will of James G. Fair; that it had never
been written by him, and if ii had been at
one time valid it was canceled by a re
publication" of the will of September 21,
1894, done upon November 26, 1894. Charles
Wheeler, who represents Mrs. Oelrichs and
Virginia Fair, demurred to the contest be
cause it includes a number of legatees â
the Lundys and Thomas Fair â who had
sold their claims ' against the estate
and so were not interested one way or the
other. : .-Â» â¢ â¢
â¢ There was gan argument over this and
1 the end was reached in two motions, one
from Mr. Wheeler and one from Judge
Paterson to strike out' the names of thir
teenâsix Lundys and seven Fairsâ
the contest. Judge Paterson's motion was
granted and the Fair contestants were re
duced by that number. Â«
... This left as contestants Herman Oelrichs
Jr. and .Wesley Crothers and Charles Fair.
Herman Oelrichs Jr. is contesting the pen
cil will because the will 1 of September 21,
the "stolen will," is much more profitable
from his standpoint. Under the trust
clauses he is a legatee, but with them de
clared invalid, or under the pencil will,
which has no trust clauses at ail, he is not
a legatee.
The trust clauses were declared invalid in
so far as they related to the real property,
some time ago, and there is quite a ques
tion as to whether or not they can be made
to stand as regards the personal property.
The decision was , rendered in the case of
Charles Fair against the special adminis
trators, and as it was eminently satisfac
factory to both sides, there has been no one
to appeal. .But little Oelrichs wants to ap
peal, or his guardian and attorney, Judge
Paterson, does, for the decision ' does not
suit him at all. ' Therefore he has a motion
pending before Judge Slack asking that he
be made a party to that suit.
â¢ The sense of "the court upon the relation
of the trust to the personal property is be
ing tested in r another way, however.
Whenever little Oeirichs, in the person of
his guardian, makes a motion or files an
important paper, Mr. Wheeler rises and
objects that he has no interest in the pro
ceedings, for the trust which defined him
as a legatee has been declared - invalid.
Judge Paterson maintains the child has
an interest, for the trust still stands so far
as the personal property is concerned, and
so the question of the relation of the trust
to the personal property is at once
brought up. : - â¢. .
This was before the court yesterday
when Mr. .Wheeler started to object to
Judge ; Paterson's ' motions and contests.
It was Judge Paterson's third amended
contest, and - it >â  was : decided that the sec
ond, which still remained, should, upon
Wheeler's motion, .â¢ .be ordered v off the
calendar. Then Wheeler argued that
Judge Paterson could not, file, any contest
of the will .because ; the court "had . not
allowed him to do so. ' The code directs,
said he, that contests by minor > heirs can
be brought only by counsel appointed by
the court for that . purpose. : Judge Pater
son had not ., been appointed with, such
authority, nor had it been delegated to
him later ! on, said Mr. Wheeler, and he
therefore moved toy dismiss â¢" the contest.
This motion was i denied by the court on
the ground that; it, required the court to
take a partisan stand in the matter.
Then Wheeler came back to little Oel
richs again. He said the child had no in
terest in the case and so could not enter a
contest. Paterson rose and \ answered by
making quite an admission. y; He said if
Judge Slack's decision already rendered in
the trust clause case should stand, then it
was evident that little Oelrichs had indeed
no interest, for the application of the trust
to the real and personal property was such
as to make the falling of it in one part
bring down the other. ; : He ';â  said - further
that the point was one not to be tried by a
motion to dismiss, but should be tried on
'an issue of facts. â : 1.-. y : : y' vy yr/. '.."." y . '
Judge Paterson declined to go on record
as saying anything definite , about . the
standing, of J; his client, tor he had hopes'
that Judge's Slack's decision would not
stand. At any rate he demanded that Mr.
Wheeler file either a demurrer." or an
answer to his contest, and let the matter
come up in tnat form. As to Pa'terson's
client, ) Wesley Crothers, he is not to Oe
touched by any preliminary : opposition.
It was shown that under the "stolen will"
he received one-eleventh of $250,000, and
under. the "pencil will", he received one
eleventh of , $200,000. This clearly, gave
him a right to oppose the "pencil will," so
he was left alone.
This brought the case well along toward
4 o'clock, and then S. M. Shortridge, who
had been listening silently all the after
noon, took a hand in the case. He gave
notice that on next. Friday he would
move to have the probate of the pencil
will set for trial. He said that the later
proponent of the will, Dr. Marc Leving
ston, still stood in the same position as
that occupied by him when his application
for probate was filed. He was anxious to
have the case come to trial, and to that
end the contest of Charles Fair and that of
Judge Paterson for the minors had been
announced without mention of technicali
ties and within a few days. The issues
were clearly joined in both- cases, and he
would move to set the probate of the will
for trial. . '.'j&l'J-yJ'-
All this means that the probate of the
"pencil will" is close at hand. Wheeler
will have to answer Paterson's contest, as
has Marc Levingston, and then the at
torneys for Levingston and the Fair girls
will be arrayed, against the remaining
counsel. With the probate of the will
will be involved all the issues now stand
ing, and before long, if no obstructions are
thrown in the way, the tangle in the Fair
case will be straightened out.
IN THE LABOR CIRCLES.

Carpenters Fail to Agree on the
Question of Recognizing Shingiers
as Tradesmen.
The San Francisco Labor Council met
last night at 1159 Mission street. There
was a rather small attendance of delegates
when the meeting, was compared with for
mer sessions, yet the usual business of the
week was transacted.
Delegate Finnerty of the Sailors' Union
reported that the wages of sailors had
been advanced $5 a month at Eureka,
Humboldt County, and that shipowners
there tried, to secure crews of non-union
seamen, but failed. The outlook for the
Seamen's Union was bright.

Pacific Company against the State Board
of Railroad Commissioners, whicn has
been progressing â¢in long and numerous
chapters before Judge McKenna in the
United States Circuit Court.
"You just come within the limit," re
plied the attorney to his inquisitor.
"How is that?"
"Well, it is this way," went on the at
torney. "You are the eleventh man that
has asked me that question; the twelfth
dies." y 'â :: :
This case has been distinguished for the
length, breadth and depth of the.argu
ments of counsel on both sides and there
is no knowing but that Judge Hayhe, who
is making a very exhaustive argument,
will continue another week.
All day yesterday Judge Hayne played
a ceaseless tattoo upon the position of the
railroad. He cited authorities, drew
parallels and raked the enemy fore and
aft. .
Judge Hayne consumed the greater part
of the day in reading decisions of the
Supreme Court of ' the United States upon
tbe question whether the proceedings iwert
such as to deprive the Southern Pacific
Company of "the equal protection of the
laws" within the meaning of the.Four
teenth Amendment.
He read"' a case which showed that a
I State could make a law providing that ap
; peals from one locality could be heard by
one appellate court, and appeals from an
-1 other locality in another manner; that in
cities of a certain size there could be fifteen
challenges to jurors and in cities of a less
' size fewer challenges; that the property of
railroads could be . assessed by one set of
' instrumentalities and the property of citi
! Zens by a different set; that corporate
| securities could be assessed at par or
nominal value, and other securities at
actual value; that for the purpose of fixing
rates railroads could be classified accord
ing to their length, or according to the
amount of business done, or according to
the time at which they were built â all
without infringing in the provision as to
due process of law, or the provision as to
the equal protection of the law. ri i"'\
Then Judge Hayne took up the proposi
tion that only the grain reductions could
be considered in this proceeding, but had
not proceeded far when the court, ad
journed till Monday.
The fact that Judge McKenna continued
the case until Monday instead of Tuesday,
as heretofore, shows that he is anxious to
get through with it. It has been a long,
tedious case, involving questions that
have never before been raised in a State or
Federal court, and its conclusion will
doubtless be a great relief to 'both the
Judge and counsel. * â¢ ~: :,.-â¢-''"''
Following Judge Hayne, the argument
for the railroad will be taken up by Mr.

SATURDAY '. ......APRIL 18, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Santa Barbara has done the State proud.
This is the day to order The Sunday
Call.
Delegates who have to be pledged are as
a rule hardly worth pledging.
The trouble with Carlisle is that he
maunders too much and slops over.
There* are plenty of queens of beauty in
the State, but they are not common. â¢
California cannot afford to sit down until
she is assured of a seat in the Cabinet.
The Carlisle boom was started by bank
ers, but all the same no one is banking on
it.
If the fruit crop should not be as big as
was expected perhaps the prices will be
bigger. â .
The poetry of spring has been realized
at Santa Barbara to make a California
holiday.
If the Cubans can hold on until Cleve
land drops out of office, recognition will
come to them.
It is a pity the local Democratic factions
cannot do politics without disturbing the
town worse than a dog-fight.
The Czar may be willing to show his
hand in Africa, but up to date no one has
exhibited any desire to call it.
The Canadian Pacific is something of an
octopus itself and should be made to keep
its tentacles out of this country.
Although the campaign is at hand, no
Republican should put on his war paint
until after the St. Louis convention.
About the worst bust of humanity possi
ble to conceive is that of a disgruntled
ward boss trying to pose as a martyr.
Great Britain has a surplus while we
have a deficit, and that is the .way the
Democratic tariff works out its results.
The Republican procession has now
started on the right - road and has a cer
tainty of victory by simply moving straight
ahead. \y";/ 't;y :
The Lanigan crowd, tbe Buckley gang,
the Rainey push and the Daggett pull are
all in evidence, but where is the Demo
cratic party?
lf an attempt is made to pass the fund
ing bill at this session of Congress, we
may as well abandon hope of an adjourn
ment in June.
If both the silver Democrats and the
fold Democrats should manage to be in it
at Chicago, one of them will have to be
inside of the other.
If Kelly and Mahoney would eet them
selves born again and be born Democrats
they might find themselves in a faction
that would fit tbem.
Eastern people may run in a few picnics
between blizzards at this season, .but a
week's festival is not possible anywhere
outside of California.
The attitude of California at the St.
Louis convention should be that of abso
lute impartialityâ friendly to all candi
dates and hostile to none.
For an unpledged delegation strong,
brainy, sagacious managers of men are
needed, but for a pledged delegation â¢ al
most any old thing would do.
: Why send a delegation with instruc
tions to St. Louis when it would be easier,
safer and much cheaper to send the in
structions direct by telegraph?
The festivals, carnivals and fiestas that
follow after Santa Barbara will have to
make a wonderful spread if they are to be
ranked as coming out ahead of her.
We shall not grudge the British their
present prosperity, for as soon as the Re
publican party returns to power we shall
have a greater prosperity of our own.
As a rule the tin-horn . politician has not
wind enough to keep himself moving
while blowing his horn, and when you
hear him tooting loudly you may know "he
is stuck. â¢
Senator Hill is resolutely fighting
against any investigation of the bond
deals. He knows his friend Cleveland is
in a hole, but he does not intend to have
the hole caved in on him.
The latest suggestion in regard to . the
cathode ray is to use it in j photographing
criminals, as it is believed no crook in the
world could ever succeed in altering the
makeup of his backbone.
Salisbury may be an effete aristocrat
while Cleveland is a fat Democrat, but all
the same the British lord has brains ; and
energy enough to diminish the national
debt of his country and Grover is doing
the other thing.
Between the Canadian Pacific .oh one â¢
side and the Southern Pacific on the other,
California is in a position where she must
strike out with both hands and' fight for
all she is worth to maintain her commerce
and protect her industries at the same
time. '.';-y'_, '*
THE IMPORTANT QUESTION.
The Call yesterday published inter
views with a number of leading Republi
cans on the attitude the California dele
gation should take , at the St. Louis Con
vention. - The opinions given were not
unanimous. That was not to be expected,
of course, for they were gathered impar
tially with the intention of. : representing
the sentiments' of all sections of the party.
There . were few, . however, who favored a
pledged delegation. The great majority,
were in favor of a delegation gent to St.
Louis for the purpose of advancing the
interests of California and bound by no
pledges that would interfere with the best
performance of that work. ' /.
It' was clear from the interviews that
those who favored a pledged delegation
looked at the subject from a point of view
widely different from that of those who
favored an unpledged delegation. ' In the
eyes of the one the National Convention
will have no other purpose than that of
nominating a candidate for President. In
the eyes of the other the convention will
be a deliberative body, having large poli
cies to outline and the means of carrying
out those policies to devise, and therefore
the nomination of candidates, instead of
being the chief object of the convention,
will be only a part of the means for ful
filling the principles to which the party is
devoted.
There can be ho question that those who
regard the convention as a deliberative
body are right. Every one having a prac
tical acquaintance with .politics knows it
is at these National conventions that party
policies are formed, the measures to in
sure them adopted and the men who are
most likely to succeed in carrying them to
perfection named as leaders of the party
in the campaign that will follow. There
fore those who favor an unpledged delega
tion have the truer view of the situation
and understand belter the duties which
we are to expect of the delegation at St.
Louis.
If there were to De done at the conven
tion nothing more than the nomination
of a President, and California were to in
struct her delegation for one man, to the
exclusion of all others, it would matter
little what manner of men we sent there.
In fact, it would not be necessary to send
a delegation at all. We might simply
telegraph the pledge to the secretary of
the convention. If the other view is
taken, however, it is clear that we must
send a strong, brainy delegation, com
posed of sagacious managers of men,
well informed as to the needs and inter
ests of California and the Pacific Coast.
We are among those who believe that
the attitude of California at the conven
tion should be one of absolute impartiality
among the leading candidates. That atti
tude, we are convinced, best represents
the whole Republican party in California
and certainly best assures, us of exerting
our rightful influence at the convention in
shaping the policies and forming the
measures which the party will. carry out.
It will also give us a prestige and an influ
ence that will go far toward obtaining for
us a representation in the next Cabinet.
That is what we ought to have. It is
what we must have, if we are to make the
next administration all that it should be
for the Pacific Coast. Opposed to no can
didate, favorable to all, loyal to all, de
voted to the interests of the Republican
party and to the State of California, we
urge an unpledged delegation to show at
St. Louis that, no matter who is nominated.
California in this contest will be a Repub
lican State. . â¢
A STRONG MAN DIES.
California has suffered a loss in the
death of Dennis Spencer.. ' Those who
were acquainted with bis commanding
presence, his bluff geniality and the rug
ged directness of his manner did not have
to be informed that by sheer force of
character, intellect snd physical vigor he
had raised himself from the ranks of the
common people to a conspicuous position
among world-builders. It is pleasing to
reflect that there was nothing factitious in
his eminence. Had he been . possessed of
the smoother graces which heredity or
fortunate circumstance of rearing can im
part the honorable - politic aspirations
which he cherished and which are so be
coming in a worthy man might have been
easily attained. Unhappily, it is not
given to the world at large to understand
the better things of life. In whatever
position the Democrats of California might
have placed this man be would have been
an honor to his party and a bulwark of
popular rights. y
"While a contemplation of his approxi
mate failure to receive the political dis
tinction warranted by his worth is not
encouraging to other men of his type, this
being due in a measure to some errors of
political judgment which time made clear
to his calmer understanding, his life as a
private citizen was particularly whole
some ana exemplary. He dug his liberal
education out of unestablished- byways,
being nothing of a schoolman and yet a
scholar. Reared in poverty, and bearing
in youth the burden of physical labor, he
retained to the end that sympathy for the
poor which is so essential to breadth of
character. That he- did not employ his
splendid abilities for the amassing of a
fortune was due as much to his generosity
as to his contempt for power which leans
on wealth alone.
His brilliancy as a lawyer was of hardly
less value than the honesty and pains
taking thoroughness of his work. To be
known as an incorruptible man must have
been pleasing to one who held personal
integrity in so high esteem. ; His aim
seemed to be to command his own respect
above that of the; world. , Only a chosen
few have ever understood the man as he
really wasâ a gentleman by instinct and a
man of principle."
AWAITING THE PLATFORM.
While the Republican : press throughout
the country is vigorously keeping the
principle of protection before the people,
and while the same idea has been -aggres
sively embodied in all the recent State con
ventions held to elect delegates to the Re
publican National Convention, the Demo
cratic press and Democratic politicians are
having very little to say on the subject.
The cry of a revenue tariff is drowned in
the clamor for protection. The wide dis
tress which has resulted . from the WilÃon-
Gorman bill of 189. is no longer explained
on the ground of a universal financial de
pression. -.-'â  v ; â¢
The history of American politics reveals
nothing, more interesting than that ruin
working measure. The; McKinley bill of
1890 made a great reduction on the tariff
which it supplanted, but was more wisely
framed in that the protection of industries
in which labor was a leading factor was its
controlling motive. ,> For- purely political
reasons it has been more grossly misrepre
sented than any other tariff measure. And
yet the Wilson-Gorman bill, which took
its place in the beginning of 1895, clearly
recognized the sound principle on which
it was based. This â  fact is accepted by all
unprejudiced thinkers. Among them is
Professor James Albert Woodson, who
says this the April Ckautauquan:
y "The Gorman- Wilson measure, the â¢ last
general revision of the tariff,: although en
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 18, 1896.
acted by a party which had denounced
protection as unconstitutional, was made
almost entirely on the principle of protec
tion. The Wilson bill as It originally
passed the House considerably modified
the McKinley act, lowering the duties on
an average of 20 per cent. * * * Speak
ing generally, the new act merely read
justed the rates;" Thus the Democrats
gave to their tariff measure the form of
free trade and the substance of protection.
It was the boldest fraud ever perpetrated
by a political party on the unheeding vot
ers who so blindly maintain it. That' Mr.
Cleveland and the other leaders, of the
party were fully aware that the measure
was not what it purported to be a scheme
for raising revenues for public necessities
is shown by the wretched and abortive at
tempt to secure sufficient revenues by
means of an income tax : law, which the
Supreme Court promptly suppressed.
The Wilson-Gorman bill leaned further
toward protection than revenue, though
from either point of view it was a fraud
and failure.
It will be interesting, therefore, to see
how the Democratic party proposes to
handle the question this year. At present
it does not seem to regard free trade as an
agreeable topic for discussion, but there
may be reasons for this other than the
awakening of an intelligent conscience.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The desire to make the Sunday issue of
The Call a more generous exponent of the
ideas whi,ch it fosters has compelled a
large addition to its ordinary number ol
pages. Hence The Sunday Call will pre

This might be cause for regret if the sole
idea in its compilation had been to make
a showing on the score of size. It is not
difficult :to make a big newspaper out of

yard for a song. To produce a distinctively
California paper, carefully prepared by
able home writers and garnered by experi
enced editors, and issued largely with a
view to encourage outside interest in the
infinity of charms possessed by the State,
is quite another matter and the special
function of The Sunday Call.

A PRESSING NEED. '
San Francisco is by reason of her geo
graphical location and natural and ac
quired transportation facilities the legiti
mate center for not only the accumulation
and distribution of the merchantable com
modities of the Pacific Coast country, but
is the natural gateway for the passage of
the trade movements between the Orient
and the Occident. Nevertheless, nowhere
the full measure of the requirements . of
commerce will be reached until the Gen
eral Government promotes a system of
ocean craft to sail from and return to San
Francisco. The territory that is naturally
tributary to the commercial and money
center reaches beyond the coast country
to all the shores of the Pacific, but it can
not be possessed by means other than by
vessels that fare enabled to enter into com
petition with foreign carriers and distribu
tors of commerce by such subsidies as oc
casion demands. v: ~. '
Not only were the projectors of the
Canadian Pacific Railway given princely
aid in their enterprise, but the British
Government by liberal bounties enables
the . maintenance of a line of steamships
between the "eastern terminus of the road
and the countries of Europe, and another
line between the western terminal and the
countries of Asia. The United States in
the meantime has done nothing to direct
this immense volume of trade and traffic
to our own coasts. . The people of San
Francisco and of the Pacific Coast country
are obliged to forego the benefits that
would otherwise accrue to them simply
because they are not sustained by the Gen
eral Government in their struggle against
Canadian rivals for commercial suprem
acy. It is not good business sense to per
mit this state of things to exist.
California, as wpll as every other Pacific
Coast State, is j deeply interested in the
purpose of San Francisco to have a mer
chant marine service that shall be strong
enough to maintain itself against any and
all competitors, but no system of ocean
transportation could compete unaided with
the subsidized carriers of England, and
hence the absolute necessity of substantial
recognition of that fact by our Govern
ment.
Now, ' San Francisco possesses every re
quired advantage I and facility for the ini
tial and objective points for any number
of ocean merchandise carriers except one
thing, and since that one thing must come
from the General . Government why not
move upon Washington with such argu
ment and influence as will secure the sail
ing to and from the metropolis of the Pa
cific Coast of a fleet of merchantmen that
shall fetch beyond peradventure â " that
which . belongs here '* by every unwritten
law of trade, interchange and merchan
dise distribution ? A more extensive mer
chant marine is San Francisco's pressing
need.
In addition to all the other factors and
factions in politics this year Kansas claims
to have a political organization known as
the Mystic Brotherhood that expects to cut
a wide swath among the candidates.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Court Commissioner D. R. Prince of Fresno,
familiarly known as Judge Prince, is at the
Grand Hotel. The Judge is up in connection
with the bonding of a large number of mining
properties in which he is interested near
Coulterville.
He is a native of Angels, finished the course
at Santa Clara College, where he afterward
taught two years, and then launched into law.
In August, 1887, he went to Fresno with the
late David B. Terry and entered into law prac
tice. Now he is chairman of the Democratic
County Committee of Fresno and Dy appoint
ment of Judge Erskine M. Boss is Circuit
Court Commissioner for the southern district
of California, it was Judge Prince who built
up the Police Court at Fresno. He was first
elected City Recorder, which in cities of the
fifth class corresponds to Police Judge in cities

of the first, second, third, or fourth class.
Then he was elected Justice of the Peace and
served one term, afterward forming a new
partnership in the law, which he has practiced
steadily since. .It was in June that he was ap
pointed Court Commissioner. Judge Prince
says Fresno County will be very active this
summer as it now appears, though it is a little
dry .down there and the recent frost may have
hurt the grapes a little. *
"I took a drive yesterday for fifteen miles
east of Fresno,'.' said he, "and from the Boston
vineyard, three miles from town, to Clovls, the
vineyards seemed to be injured to some extent.
This was true of both the wine and raisin
grapes. vi^-y y ; '.;.-;>. -Â«:Â£â¢
"If we get more rains the grain crop may do
well; otherwise it will beat a disadvantage.
I hear the grain crop in Tulare is in need of
more rain. As lt is it is tending to lightness.
j "However, there are a number of things un
der way in that part of California that promise'
to more than straighten everything out. j The
new electric power from Pollasky, thirtj^miles
from Fresno, is one of the big things. It will
light the city, and make Fresno the best-lighted
place on the coast. It is expected that there
will be power enough also to run all the mills
there, and others that may be started, and thus
Fresno is expected to go. ahead rapidly as a
manufacturing city.
"One of the big fruit canneries of San Fran
cisco has made arrangements to move down
there too, In order to be right where the fruit
ls grown. This will help the city considerably.
The future of Fresno seems to me to be very
good, indeed." ' y-y '
The Judge will probably be here for two or
three days. ! .^y/y y"Vw?-'i'.;
"Oh, yes; there are other interior cities in
California, butâ" Editor Bobertson's pause

Bald more emphatically than so many words,
"there's none of them in it with Placerville."
Now, Placervllle is the home of the Placer
ville Nugget, and Bob V. Bobertson is the edi
tor and half owner of that bright little after
noon paper. Mr. Robertson came down with
the Editorial Association as far as Sacramento
and then made a flying trip to this City on
business. He is full of Placervllle, of Placer
ville's climate, of Placerville's fruit, her mines,
her people, her natural advantages, her poten
tial and substantial wealth and the "wonder
ful thrift and enterprise of her citizens."
"The frost never touched our fruit," he said
yesterday at the Lick House. "We're too high
for that. We send out the first and tne finest
cherries of the season. There's a lot of capital
going into the mines up there now. So far as
El Dorado County is concerned, we are work
ing the mines in the ground just at present,
instead of In the offices in San Francisco. It's
that way a good deal all along the foothills,
too; but there's no county seat in the State
ahead of Placerville in a good many things.
We're putting in a new fire-alarm system. We
expect to get a cannery, located there before
long, and we're going to sprinkle ten miles of
a good country road between Placerville and
Coloma. Oh, yes; Placerville is the coming
city. There's no boom on, but things are
brisk, trade is good and the people are wide

LOVE'S CRIME.
Love played with matches in her eyes, Â«
A dangerous game, with none to binder;
As to the pole the needle flies,
So in my breast a spark found tinder;
I sought to check the lambent raid,
But soon In ashes spread the pyre,â
It is a crime for any maid
To set a young man's heart afire.
Straightway I sought the Sheriff grim,.
A warrant for the culprit, Daphne.
I poured my sorrow out to him.
Me only laughed and tried to chaff me:

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
GOLDBUG ADMISSIONS.
FIGURES WHICH SHOW THAT THK POPULISTS ARE
DANGEROUS.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
Aside from the proposed joint nomination by
the Populists and silverites of the same candi
dates on separate but not antagonistic plat
forms at the, National conventions which are
to meet in St. Louis, July 22, as independent
conventions, it is admitted by so conservative
a gold-standard journal as , the Boston Globe
that the Populists alone constitute a formid
able force which will have to be encountered
in the ' approaching , Presidential campaign.
After a careful review of the several Presiden
tial campaigns since 1872, and reaching the
conclusion that in no one of them the race for
the White House was won in a walkover, each
one having Deen a real contest, .thelGlobe pro
ceeds to say: â¢â ;',.
"If the Democrats should persist in their
sulking and scuffling and sacrifice every
Northern State in the election of next Novem
ber our Republican friends ' still would have
the Populists to reckon - withâ the much de
rided but undismayed Populists.
' "Look at the voting records if you Imagine
that the Populists are not profiting by this
state of things. In spite of the tidal waves of
Republicanism they have been gaining almost
everywhere in the South and West. In Arkan
sas their vote Jumped' from 11,000 in 1892 to
24,000 in 1894, â  in California it res* -fcom
25,000 to 51,000, in Colorado from 53,000 to
82,000, in Georgia from 42,000 to 96,000.' in
Illinois from 22,000 to 59,000, in Indiana from
22,000 to 29,000, in lowa from 20,000 to
32,000, in Michigan from .19,000 to 30,000, In
Minnesota from 29,000 to 87,000, in Missouri
from 41,000 to 42,000, in Montana from 7000
to 15,000, in Ohio from 14.000 to 56,000, in
Texas from 99,000 to 159,000, in Virginia
from 12,000 to 81,000, in Washington from
19,000 to 25,000 and in Wisconsin from 9000
to 25,000. while they have held their own
completely in Tennessee, South Dakota and
Oregon.
"Now let us look at some other figures. The
winning candidate for President will need
224 votes in the next electoral college. If the
Democrats should not carry a single Northern
State the Republicans would go to the Missis
sippi Biver and face the Populists of the great
West with only 207 votes, or seventeen less
than the requisite number."
Quite nam Â«*ly this showing of Populist
strength leads, the consideration of what is
likely to take place "if tne choice of a Presi-
dent is left tothe House of Representatives,"
and the Globe reaches this conclusion: .
"The silver members from the South and
West control twenty-four ot the forty-eight
State delegations, and if the silver Republicans
from any three States like California, Idaho,
Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon,
South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming
should carry out their current threat and cast
aside party lines, the election of the Republi
can candidate for President by the House of
Representatives would be impossible.
"In other words three members of Congress,
controlling as they do the vote in the House
of Idaho, Montana and North Dakota, would
have it in their power to defeat the Republi
can candidate.
"Furthermore the Senate is so divided that
the Republican candidate for Vice-President
could not be elected under any imaginable
circumstances."
If the desperate struggle of Senator Hill, re
ported in the news of to-day (April 17) to pre
vent an investigation into the facta now so
â¢ sedulously concealed which underlie the no-
I torious bond deal as proposed by Senator Pef
fer of Kansas < Populist) and Hill's wrathful
assault upon the Populists for proposing such
an investigation, may be taken as a frankÂ«ex
pression of the feeling entertained by the gold
standard men of the country, there is some
reason for supposing that the Populists have
come to be regarded as dangerous to the plans
of goldmongers, and he was wise in saying
that "it Is about time for Senators who repre
sent States interested in this question to act
together," regardless of party affiliation.

SENATOR PERKINS' VIEW.
Oakland Tribune.
Senator Perkins occupies a good position to
survey the political horizon. ' He does not
think that any candidate for Vice-President
will be selected west of the Rocky Mountains
by the St. Louis convention. But he thinks
the California.Bepublicans should conserve all
their influence by sending an unpledged dele
gation .to the convention. That delegation
will know a great deal more about the politi
cal situation when it gets to St. Louis than it
can possibly know before that time. There are
five or six Republican candidates who are pos
sibilities. Even General Harrison Is a possi
bility; for it is known that he can have the
backing of his own State if he wants It.
The California delegation should be free to
act as it shall seem best when it arrives on the
ground. It does not even need be pledged to l
protection. There is Â»ota sound Republican
in the State who is not heartily committed to
tbat policy. Every man who has been named
as a possible Bepublican candidate for a Presi
dential nomination stands squarely on the
doctrine of protection. Of course delegates
will have their preferences as to candidates, .'
but they should be free to adapt their action
to circumstances that cannot be clearly fore
seen in advance of the convention.
A PRETTY SKIRT.
The skirt shown here is especially liked for
very thin materials, for wash goods or light
weight silks. It also develops well in the
light-weight crepons and may be made with
out the box-pleat in front. Â£fis_!
â  : A charming evening dress of pink taffetas
with a black stripe was trimmed with black
satin ribbons run through a creamy lattico-
work of batiste, as shown in the illustration.
The waist had a black chiffon ' bodice, with
short, puffed sleeves of the silk. * Three stripes
of the batiste, with black satin ribbon run
through them, formed bretelle trimming on
both back and front of the waist. :
A blue dotted mull dress had a ruffle of
narrow Valenciennes lace on the edges of the
double box-pleat. The waist was made with a
blouse . front, which was also made ' with a
double box-pleat edged with * lace. The short
puffed sleeves had four rows of lace from
shoulder to the elbow.

MEETING OF METHODISTS
Abolishing The Time Limit on Pas
torate-)â Joint Work of Min
istry and Laity.
A meeting of the Methodists of Oakland,
Alameda and this City was held in Cen
tral M. E. Church, on -Mission street, last
evening. James W. Whiting of San Fran
cisco and Henry French of San Jose, the
delegates elected by the Laymen's Elec
toral Conference last September to attend
, the General Methodist Conference at
Cleveland, were presents They are on
their way to the great Methodistic gath
ering.
The principal business of the evening
was the adoption of a resolution abolish
ing the time limit of five years, the extent
of a pastor's work in one"charge. Should
the conference concur in this expression,
the church in one locality may retain its
minister any length of time its members
elect. NBn__ri_BMÃn_Sra_Â£Â£-_BB_B___B

MAY WIELD A
SUNDAY RAZOR
The Barbers' Law Declared
Invalid by the Su
preme Court.
SPECIAL AND ILLOGICAL.
â '. -y
No Reason in Closing Sunday
Afternoons for Barbers
Only.
CAN WORK WHEN THEY PLEASE
Severe Criticisms Passed by the
Justices on the Latest Labor
' Law.
There is no further necessity for the
beardless to attend the Saturday night
sessions at the barber-shop, or crowd
around the chairs to be shaved before 12
o'clock on Sunday. . The barbers can work
all the holiday if they please, for the Su-
Supreme Court, has laid the "barbers' law"
level with the dust.
The "barbers' law" was secured only
after long and persistent work by the more
liberal-minded employers and by th' greater
number of the journeymen. It was passed
by the last Legislature, and by its terms it
was made a misdemeanor for any shop to
keep open, or for any barber to draw scis
sors or razor between 12 o'clock Sunday
noon and 12 o'clock Sunday midnight.
The law was not long in force when Otto
Jentzsch, keeper of a small shop in this
City, made himself liable to arrest under
its terms. He was industriously removing
a three-days' growth about 3 o'clock one
Sunday when te was arrested on com
plaint of one of the committee, whose duty
it was to see the law obeyed, and he was
charged with misdemeanor.. He petitioned
for a writ of habeas corpus, and the Su
preme Court has granted his petition and
ordered him discharged.
In discharging the defendant the Su
preme Court declares the "barbers' law"
unconstitutional, and then proceeds to
criticise it most severely. It was framed
to protect the laborer from the capitalist,
the opinion says, but it is not easy to see
how it does so. It deprives a man of the
right to labor and to enjoy the fruits of
his toil. It is a curious law for the protec
tion of labor which punishes the laborer
for working, yet it is precisely what the
law considered does. Continuing, the
opinion says:
The laboring barber, engaged in a most re
spectable, useful and cleanly pursuit, is
singled out from the thousands of his fel
lows in other employments and told that,
willy-nilly, he shall not work upon holidays
and Sundays after 12 o'clock noon. His
wishes, tastes or necessities are not consulted.
If he labors he is a criminal. Such protection
to labor, carried a little further, would send
him from the jail to the poorhouse. '.y V y'~'' :
; How comes it that the legislative eye was so
keen to discern the needs of the oppressed bar
ber, and yet was so blind to his toiling brethren
in other vocations? Steamcar and streetcar
operatives toil through long and weary Sunday
hours, so do mill and factory hands. There is
no Sunday period of rest and protection for
the overworked employes of our daily papers.
Do these not need rest and protection? The
bare suggestion of these considerations shows
the injustice and inequality of the law.
The law is special, and it violates the
provisions of the constitution which
secures to a man the right of personal free
dom, says the opinion, and also the right
to labor where and when he pleases, and
in whatever form he sees fit. It is special
because it singles out barbers alone; it has
no concern whatever with the vast army
of men who in other trades toil through
Sundays and holidays as well as upon
week days; it is only the barber who must
suffer if he runs his work over the Sunday
noon hour. For that reason the court
considers it special and unequal and also
unreasonable. If it were general, the
court concedes there might be something
to.be said on the ground that it was a
police regulation, but in its present form
the Supreme Court can see nothing in the
law that is not harmful. In concluding
the opinion contains these words:
In a law such as this no reason has been
shown why the followers of one useful and un
objectionable employment should be debarred
from the right to labor upon certain days and
not on others. When any such class is singled
out and put under the criminal ban of such a
law as this the law not only is special, unjust
and unreasonable in its operation, but it
works an invasion of individual liberty the
liberty of free labor which it pretends to pro
tect.
The decision was written by Judge
Hensbaw and was concurred in by the en
lire court. . i?\ 'â '-.;
OPEN AND SECRET POKER
Can the Game Be Played by
tbe Rich and Denied to
the Poor?
Accusation Against Ashworth Re
ferred to a Committee of the
Grand Jury.
The Grand Jury held a session yester
day afternoon and considered the subject
of open poker games. An easy way is not
found to prepare an ordinance that will
permit poker-playing in clubs, hotels and
private houses and prevent the pastime in
saloons. The Grand Jury seems to be
earnest in its desire to remove the tempta
tions which lure the youth of the City to
gamble and spend the fruits of honest
toil in games of chance where the' percent
acre is sure to absorb in a very, short ti me
all the money staked on the game. Still
the members cannot see how poker-play
ing can be made lawful for one class of citi
zens and unlawful for another.

DR. BROWN'S SIDE.
He Submits an Affidavit by Miss Ella
SI. Havens and a, Statement by
Mrs. Brown.
Dr. C. O. Brown desires the following
affidavit and statement published. They
relate to a published story to the effect that
Mrs. Brown had admitted to Miss Havens
that her husband had sinned. The affi
davit and statement run as follows: ' v
San Francisco, April 14, 1896.
The Chronicle article of this morning is in
many respects entirely false In word and
statement. I never said Dr. Brown was a liar,
but, on the contrary, I said I would believe his
word against the world, which I sincerely do.
If at any time I held suspicions on account of
newspaper reports, they have entirely disap
eared, because I found them groundless. J
aye Deen in Dr. Brown's home frequently for
a period of two years, and always found him
a perfect gentleman and a man of the highest
honor. I know nothingâ not the sligntest
reflecting upon his honor or integrity.
I came over voluntarily from Alameda this
morning to correct the false statements given
in the Chronicle. Ella M. Havens.
Subscribed and sworn to before rue this lith
day of April, 1766. Charles S. Phillips,
Notary Public in and for the City and County
of San Francisco, State of California.
The above affidavit by Miss Havens was
written and signed by her on the morning that
the Chronicle article appeared. She came to
our house to do this without the slightest hint
from us. No one could regret more than Dr.
Brown and mrself that her name has been
drawn into this matter. Certainly we are not
responsible for it. I never said to" her nor to
any other person that my husband gave me
cause for jealousy. Nor did I say to her any
thing that implied that there was any failure
of honor on his part, even the slightest. The
statement that 1 bad said that I should not tell
the truth on the witness-stand is preposterous.
If my friend thought I ever said that she
grievously misunderstood me, which might
possibly be, as we were on the street and dis
turbed with its noises when the conversation
occurred. Those who know me best have not
waited for any denial from me to be assured
that I never said any such thing.

CRUELTIES OF A HUSBAND
Mrs. John Martin Was Driven
Insane by Neglect and
Abuse.
The Woman Is Held Entirely Blame
less for the Killing of Her
Husband.
A Coroner's jury yesterday acquitted
Mrs. John F. Martin of all responsibility
for the killing of her husband. The lan
guage of the verdict was as follows: *â  ;r
That John F. Martin, aged 35 years, came to
his death on April 3, 1896. at the City Receiv
ing Hospital, from peritonitis from a gunshot
wound; and we further find that the aforesaid
Johu F. Martin came to his death by a gunshot
wound caused by the hand of his wife, Mrs.
Susie Martin; and we furthermore find that
she, Mrs. Susie Martin, done the same while af
flicted with temporary insanity, caused by
cruelty and neglect at the hands of John F.
Martin, deceased.
The first witness called was Mrs. Etta
McDermott, who testified that she was
in the corridor in the City Hall at the
time of the shooting. She saw Martin and
his wife pass along the corridor. Mrs.
Martin carried a pistol at the time. She
did not witness the shooting though she
heard the shots fired.
' Dr. Fitzgibbon stated in his evidence
that Martin was suffering from two gun
shot wounds when he was brought to the
Receiving Hospital and looked as though
he had been drinking the previous night.
Detective Eagan was in the corridor
when he heard the scooting. He turned
and saw Martin lying down and Mrs.
Martin fired another: shot at him. He
and Detective Crockett took the pistol
from the woman and arrested her.
J. J. Callundan. superintendent of
Morse's patrol, from whom Martin and
his wife rented a room at 543 California
street, said that the couple quareled and
Mrs. Martin complained that her husband
did not pay the rent. They got behind in
their rent and Mrs. Martin was crying and
worrying all the time. Martin was driving
the patrol wagon at the time and was well
able to support bis wife. Mrs. Martin had
complained to tbe witness of her hus
band's.neglect.
Ned Foster, brother-in-law of Mrs.
Martin, testified that she married Martin
two years ago. After they had been
married about four months Martin was
taken ill and his wife nursed him. After
recovering he started drinking again and
also paid attention to another woman to
the neglect of his wife. Finally Mrs.
Martin went to live with the witness and
his wife, and later went to Salt Lake City.
Martin implored her to return to him and
promised to do better by her, but when she
returned he renewed his old habits of life
and willfully neglected her. Mrs. Martin
had told : the witness that she could not
bear up under her tronbles and threatened
to commit suicide. Mrs. Foster testified
to about the same, effect. Dr. Barrett
testified as to the result of the autopsy,
the jury retired- and after a short
time returned the verdict as stated above.
Mrs. Martin was unable to attend the
inquest. She is still in the' matron's ward
at the City Prison. "

TO HOLD A HORSE SHOW
The Association Decides to Ex
hibit Early; in De
cember.
WILL NOT AUCTION BOXES.
R. F. Morrow Offers a Challenge Cup.
C. asses for California-Bred
Horses. â¢
It Is now definitely settled that the
Horse Shoe Association will hold its
third annual horse show this year in the
early part of December, at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
This decision was reached at the last
regular meeting of the directors. There
was a large attendance and it was resolved
that the show should be held without any
change in the prices of the boxes. What
largely influenced the directors to con
tinue the horse shows was the evident will
ingness of owners of horses to exhibit.
Some weeks agoanumoerof exhibitors and
possible exhibitors were communicated
with and requested to state whether they
would enter their horses this year. At
the lime of the last meeting over fifty re
plies had been received, assuring the asso
ciation that the writers were willing to
exhibit. '
Among those who have already ex
pressed their intention of exhibiting are
some of tin 1 principal horseowners in the
State, and it is believed, from present in
dications, that there will be considerably
more competition than there was last
year. It has already been decided to
smooth the way a3 far as possible for
country exhibitors. For instance, it is be
lieved that last year people in the interior
were deterred from entering pairs of car
riage-horses on account of the difficulty
and expense of transporting also the car
riages and harnesses necessary to exhibit
them. Exhibitors in the interior who
enter well-broken pairs of carriage-horses
at the coming show will be furnished by
the association with carriages and har
nesses for their exhibition.
It has also been decided that at the com
ing show there will be several classes of
California-bred horses, though details on
this subject will not be definitely settled
till June or July.
As a result of the resolution taken at the
last meeting all the former holders of
private boxes will be communicated with
to-day in order that they may have the
first chance of paying deposits on their
boxes, the directors having decided
that the patrons of last year shall have
the privilege of choosing the same boxes
they occupied at the last show. In the
event of any subscriber desiring a different
box from last year his application v. ill be
filed and he will be given his choice,
according to priority of application, on
this year's boxes unsubscribed by - last
year's patrons. After old subscribers have
been provided for the remaining boxes
will be thrown open to new subscribers.
The rumor has been quite extensively
circulated that the horse Show Associa
tion was contemplating auctioneering off
the choice of location to the highest bid
der. Thi* is done at the New York Horse
Show, where as large a sum as $500 or $600
is sometime paid for choice of location in
addition to the cost of the box. Tho ad
visability of auctioneering locations was
fully discussed.by the directors at the last
meeting, but it was. finally settled that it
would . be treating subscribers better to
allow them to retain their boxes at the
same price. _
,No canvassing has yet been made for
awards, but as an instance of the interest
which the coming show appears to be
arousing two awards have already been
volunteered. Robert F. Morrow has'offered
a $300 challenge cup to be won in two suc
cessive years. The donor has left to the
directors the choice of the class in which
the cup is to be put. Tne Palace Hotel
has also volunteered $100, to be given in
plate or money, at the wish of the di
rectors. " ;y y \ - *
All the above mentioned steps toward
the success of this year's show have been
taken within the last few days.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Nicaraguan Ports Closed by the
Rebels Against Pacific
Mail Steamers. â
The City of Para Leaves With Orders
to Move the Merchandise
at Once.
The wars and rumors of wars in Nica
ragua and San Salvador and other Central
American ports have been the - cause of
considerable loss to the Pacific Mail Com
pany. The harbors of San Juan del Sur
and Corinto are closed and at the present
time there are 1500 tons of eeneral mer
chandise and seventeen loaded freightcars
at Panama awaiting transportation to the
interior. The coastwise steamers . have
been unable to handle it as; the ports
named are in the hands of the rebels and
they will riot allow any ships to enter. In
consequence the Pacific Mail officials are
in a quandary as they are under contract
to deliver the goods and the owners are
clamoring for them.
An attempt is to be made to move the
merchandise. The steamer City of Para
will sail to-day and Captain Russell has
received instructions to take all reasonable
risks to get the entire shipment to Corinto
and San "; Juan del Sur if possible. Of
course he will attempt to make the ports
and nothing short of cannon will prevent
him from effecting a landing. '-;â  Just how
the matter will turn out remains to be
seen, but if the goods can 'be delivered
without loss of life Captain Russell will do
it. The City of Para should have an ex
citing voyage..- ..
Nearly "all the officers ofthe City of Para
have gone bacK to New York and the fol
lowing will go out in the vessel to-day:

owner wants her subjected to another sea

anticipated.
The gasoline schooner Etta B, Captain
Matsen, has conferred a boon upon the
farmers of Fort Ross that they thoroughly
appreciate. Formerly they had to cart
their butter and produce to Cazadero,
twenty miles away, and send it by train to
San Francisco. Now the Etta B calls
there every trip, and yesterday made the
run down in eight hours. The little
schooner formerly only ran as far as
Tomales, but owing to the efforts of G. W.
Call, who has done so much for Fort Ross,
Captain Matsen agreed to extend his run
and take in the point mentioned. Fort
Ross dairy products will now be a potent
factor in the San Francisco markets.
Vessels which left here lor Alaska dur
ing the past month must have had a bad
time of it. The following is a brief report
of the bark Leon from Nanaimo for Sitka:
On March 25, in latitude 51.32 north,

gale from northwest tor thirty-six hours.
On March 27, in latitude 51.44 north, longi
tude 136.52 west, experienced a heavy gale
from southwest, lasting three days. A
heavy cross sea was running and we blew
away several sails. On April 1, in lati
tude. 55.23 north, longitude 137.40 west,
had a very heavy fall of snow followed by
frost. On April*2 made land off Sitka at
4 p.m., from thence to port light winds
from northeast with calms. No accidents
occurred during the voyage.

HELD COURT IN GERMAN
Justice Groezinger Departs Strik
ingly From the Beaten
Path.
Attorneys, Witnesses and the Court
Us 3 the Mother Tongue by
Agreement.
A curious scene was enacted in Justice
Of the Peace Goezinger's court yesterday. |
when, for the first time since the City Hall
was turned over to the municipal officers,
or, in fact, since the Spanish Alcaldes held
the reins of justice, a case was tried in a
foreign tongue. Such a proceeding is not
contemplated by the statutes governing
American courts, and had a stipulation not
been made by the attorneys before the trial
began, the loser would have had a clear
case for a new trial. As it was the matter
was agreed, and from the time the first
witness was put on the stand until the
Judge gave his opinion nothing was
spoken but German. y ."y.'y-
Attorneys, witnesses and the Justice
were all conversant with the language, the
witnesses, in fact, speaking so little Eng
lish that progress in that language would
have been slow and: difficult. So the
mother tongue of the participants was
resorted to and the trial progressed with
out a hitch. Even tne Justice seemed
pleased at the change. The few visitors
to the court who were not prepared for the
programme listened a few moments,
looked astonished, and passed out, leaving
the shrine of justice to the exponents of
German, who were perfectly at home, and
made amazing progress with the testi
mony.
The case was that of O. H. J. "Wetirock
against Eureka Lodge No. 6 of the Order
of Hermann's Sons, the plaintiff claiming
that he was not paid sick benefits to which
he was entitled.
Justice Groezinger intimatedâ in Ger
man, of course that as the plaintiff had
exercised his right of appeal to the beads
of â¢ the organization, as provided by the
constitution of the order, that he. was not
entitled to a verdict and gave judgment
accordingly. .

TO INVESTIGATE
OUR RESOURCES
Mission of Treasurer Shaw
of the Christian En
deavor Society.
SAN FRANCISCO AS HOST.
An Emissary to Ascertain if We
Can Entertain a Big
Convention.
RECEPTION BY ENDEAVOREES.
Oakland and Local Unions to Honor
the Distinguished Visitor From
the East.
Whether or not San Francisco is to reap
the honor and benefit in 1897 of an inter
national convention composed, at a mod
est estimate, of 25,000 delegates, will be
WILLIAM SHAW, THE WORLD-KNOWN CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORER.
largely dependent upon the report which
William Shaw, the treasurer of the United
Society of Christian Endeavor has to make
when he returns to his Eastern home.
Mr. Shaw will arrive in Oakland this
morning at 10:45 o'clock. He will be met
at the train by a committee of the local
Endeavor societies, and no effort will be j
spared to see that he is duly impressed j
with that side of the bay. In the evening \
he will address a large mass-meeting, j
which will partake of the nature of a re- j
ception.
At the conclusion of the meeting a com- j
mittee of San Francisco Endeavorers, con- |
sistin..- of J. S. Webster, Dr. R. L. Rigdon.
Dr. E. E. Kelley, Donald Mackenzie and
Professor J. A. Wiles, will escort Mr. Shaw
to this City. Apartments have been pro
cured for him in the Palace, and these will i
be profusely decorated by members of the
society.
Mr. Shaw has been prominently con
nected with the Endeavor movement al- I
most from its beginning, having: served as !
first president of the society formed in
Phillips Church, Boston, in the fall of
1883, by Rev. F. E. Clark, now president of
the World's Christian Endeavor Union.
He was born on February 14, 1860, at Bal
lardvale, Mass., where his home now is.
For several years he was in business in
Boston, but retired in 1887 to accept a posi
tion on the Golden Rule, the official organ
of the United Society.
In the spring of 1890 he was appointed j
to the position of treasurer of the United I
Society, and in 1895. when the "World's
Christian Endeavor Union was formed, he J
was elected treasurer of that body also. It !
is largely due to his ceaseless watchfulness
and business ability that the United Soci
ety, through its publishing department,
is able to conduct its great business with
out receiving any contributions or levying
a cent of dues upon the Christian En
deavor societies. Mr. Shaw is a familiar
figure at all the Christian Endeavor inter
national conventions, and his resonant
voice, coupled with his quick wit, brightly
proclaims the power of the youne Chris
tian business man.
Holla V. Watt, the popular and ener
getic chairman of what is called the
Committee of ; 1897, whose duty it will be
to plan for the entertainment of the great :
Christian Endeavor Convention, to be '
held in this City in July, 1897, in an inter- j
view outlined what has been done toward I
securing this .convention, as well as the !
preliminary work yet to be accomplished
in order that there may be no possible
doubt of its coming here.' He saia:
California lost the National Republican
Convention by a scratch. San Francisco
demonstrated its ability to entertain a large i
number of people when the Sir Knights held
their triennial conclave in this City again !
when the Grand Army of the Republic held its
encampment here, again when the National '
Educational Association came to our hospitable '
shores. â â â :â > â  7 ."â  -â¢ \
San Francisco was naturally disappointed at '
her failure to capture tne National Republi- '
can Convention. We now have, however, an
opportunity to secure the presence in our '
midst of a very much larger number of people i
from all parts ol the world than the Republi
can Convention could have brought.
In 1893 the committee having in'charge the
securing of the International Christian Kn
deavor Convention went to Montreal with a
large delegation, having the indorsement of
the. Governor of the State, the Mayor of the
City, the Chamber of Commerce and other
public bodies and many of the religious organ
izations and secured the convention of 1695 '
for California. We failed to hold it for 1895 I
because of our inability to secure railroad
rates low enough to Induce a large attendance '
hence the convention went to Boston and !
over s6,ooo delegates attended; probably the
largest convention the world ever saw
Our committee made a determined effort at '
Boston to secure the convention for San Fran
cisco in 1897, and succeeded, on condition
that satisfactory railroad rates could be se
cured. The action of the Transcontinental
Association in fixing a $50 rate from the Mis
souri River (round trip) for the Republican
Convention justifies the expectation that "* he
same rale will be made for this larger body.
The citizens' committee asked â  tor Â£100' 000
with which to entertain the National Republi
can Convention and readily secured it. The
International Christian Endeavor Convention
will cost only about one-auarter of that sum,
or say $25,000, None of this money will be
needed unless the convention actually comes
to San Francisco, but for obvious reasons it is.
necessary for us to arrange a guarantee fund
in order that our committee may go to Wash
ington, D. C, where the convention will be
held this year, with as strong a leverage as pos
sible. . y_ . .- v â  . -.
The convention will be held in San Fran
cisco in July, 1897, during the vacation time
in the East, and will bring to us just the char
acter of people California needsâ young men
and women just out of school, bright, Intelli
gent, enthusiastic, largely with the plans of
lite unsettled, susceptible to the influence of
our magnificent State. We have little doubt
that many of them will be .induced to perma
nently locate in our midst; others will return
to us later, and all will, while they live, sing
California's praises. Many college professors,
hundreds of school-teachers, clergymen, law
yers and doctors attend these conventions.
The Sir Knights and Grand Army of the Re
public are largely composed of men past mid
dle life, with homes and business fixed, re
quiring a wrench to change. Not -so the
Christian Endeavorers. Alive to the splendid
opportunities of the West, on the very
threshold of life, who can estimate the num
ber out of the thousands of visitors who will be
permanently attracted to us?
What is the money needed for?
Delegates pay their own traveling and living
expenses, and very naturally leave a large
amount of money in every convention city.
Our expense will arise in promoting and ad
vertising San Francisco, the convention city,
in providing suitable meeting places. There
are usually two or three meetings of from 5000
to 7000 each in progress at the same time;
therefore, aside from the Mechanics' Pavilion,
we must have two other places of equal ca
pacity, probably monster tents. These require
chairs or benches to accommodate "20,000 in
the aggregate. These meeting places must be
suitably decorated, and provisions made for
telegraph, telephone and newspaper service,
committee rooms, musical Instruments and
instrumentalists. Souvenir â  badges must be
given every delegateâ 30,000 will be
required. Headquarters for States must be
provided. Programmes in pamphlet form, in
cluding all the music of the evening, must be
printed. The expenses of famous orators from
all parts of the country must be paid. Our
principal streets must be decorated. Excur
sions about the bay and about the City and
genuine California hospitality will require the
sum named. v r:- -
I have mentioned, however, only material
benefits, but who can estimate the influence |
on our community of such a gathering of i
Christian people of all denominations? Peo- â¢
ple who do not belong to or go to church I
must appreciate the grandeur of this organi- I
zation, which stands for the broadest Christian I
j fraternity, good citizenship, and practical ]
Christianity, and welcome its leaders to this, j
I our great metropolis of the West. The City
! will feel the presence of the great convention i
i and be benefited by it.
Portland and Los Angeles made a strong j
j fight in Boston last year to get the convention,
! guaranteeing to raise a sum not less than !
J $20,000 to pay its expenses, but the trustees I
, wisely concluded to let the convention go to
San Francisco, the metropolis of the Pacific
Coast, and we have no doubt that the citizens
will readily subscribe the required amount I
when called upon by the finance committee, of
which C. Z. Merritt of Miller & Lux . is chair
man and W. H. Crocker, president of the '
I Crocker-Woolworth Bank, is treasurer. The
| money will not be required until next year,
but the guarantee should be met by. subscrip
tion before the Ist of July, so that our com
mittee may go to Washington, having the re
i quired amount pledged. Let it be definitely
understood that every delegate to San Fran
cisco pays his own expensesâ a dollar comes
out of subscription.
A reception will be tendered the distin
guished guest by Golden Gate Union at
the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium to-morrow
afternoon at 3 o'clock. The following pro
gramme has been prepared: '

THE SAN FRAKCISCOr CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 18, 1896.
THE TENDER BLAIRMORE.
All the Sailors on the Neighbor
ing Ships Discussed Her
Crankiness.
MATE MATSON'S TESTIMONY.
â â -â¢-â  â '.
Captain Caw's Fellow-Skippers Think
the Luckless Vessel* Well
Handled.
The investigation into the disaster of the
Britisn ship Blairmore, which capsized in
Mission Bay April 9, was resumed before
Vice-Consul Moore yesterday morning.
Captain James Garriocir. and FirstM ate
Gordon Wilkinson of the British ship
Ellesland testified that they considered the
Blairmore a safe vessel, and that no blame
could be attached to her management prior
to the accident, but First Mate Browne of
the ship Yeoman and Second Mate Mat
son of the Verejean gave evidence that
strongly censured Captain Caw. They
noticed the Blairmore lying over to the
puffs of the gale, and were fearful of a
disaster.
Apprentice Boys Bannehr and Powell
of the lost ship testified, the former to be
ing at first afraid of the "tender" motions
of the vessel, and the latter to having seen
Mate Ludgate covered by the ballast of
the careening Blairmore.
Second Officer Henry Matson of the Vere
jean was sworn, and stated that his ves
sel was about half a mile from the Blair
more. He thought she was cranky and in
a dangerous position for a ship with such
little ballast.
"Were you alarmed about her?" asked
Vice-Consul Moore.
"Yes. I did not care for the looks of the
ship during the time she came to lay out
there."
By bis peculiar phraseology he probably
meant to say that he was alarmed about
the vessel all the time she was at anchor
there. J
"I watched the ship all the time she was
there at anchor and noticed that with the
least wind she went over."
"If your shiD had acted in the way she
did," asked Mr. Moore," would you have
been afraid of her 7"
"I would. Ido not consider the weather
of April 9 severe enough to have capsized
a vessel properly ballasted. If I had been
in command of the Blairmore I would not
have allowed the men to work in the hold
that morning, considering the weather
and her crankiness."
"Did you notice, the . Blairmore that
morning?" --y
"Yes sir. I watched her from 4 o'clock
till the time she went down that morning,
and I thought I would not care to be
aboard of her."
"Did you expect her to capsize from the
way she acted?"
"Yes I did. She did not lie in any more
exposed place in the bay than any other
ship."
! "How did your ship behave that morn
ing?" Â.'â¢:'
"Stiff. No danger whatever. She was
about half a mile from the Blairmore. A
vessel properly stiffened would not have
been in any danger."
First Mate D. J. Browne of the British
ship Yeoman swore that from the deck of
his vessel he noticed the Blairmore lean
ing over pretty well. He did not then
think she would capsize, but, stated that if
his vessel would careen that far he would
not have been satisfied. ;:y >
"Under the circumstances that she did
capsize," said he, "I consider that the
weather that morning was such that any
vessel, even if properly stiffened, may be
in danger. The squalls were heavy and
sudden and the flood tide making. I no
ticed the Blairmore's chain slack before
the squall came, and when the wind struck
her she backed on her chain and it tight
ened. Then she heaved more around
broadside on to the tide and the wind
seemed to strike her either right ahead or
on the port bow. She careened, and I
think something must have have shifted,
for she hung a little and then went over.
I could not judge accurately of her dan
gerous condition, not being aboard of her,
but she rolled too much and was too ten- 1
der. The Blairmore was about three ship's
lengths from us."
First Mate Gordon Wilkinson of the
Ellesland stated on the witness-stand that
the Blairmore was about a quarter of a
mile away. He noticed that she seemed
to be a little tender and lay over more
than his own ship in the squalls. He was
watching the other ship all the while, he
said. When she went over she hung a
little, as though she were trying to re
cover; then she suddenly went over as
though something had shifted.
"If I had been in command of her," he
said, "I would have allowed the men to
work in the hold at that time."
Rev. James Fell of the Seamen's Insti
tute testified that the mate and the boys
had spoken to him about the condition of
the ship. The former had said that he
did not think the ship was very safe, as
she heeled over in a way that made it un
pleasant to be in her. On another occa
sion Mr. Fell had sat with four of the ap
prentices in one of their boats and they
said during a conversation that they had
got out of bed that morning, fearing
the' ship ' would capsize. He had men
tioned these reports to Mr. Foreman and
Mr. Binnic of Balfour, Guthrie & Co. the
Sunday before the accident. '
"Do you consider it judicious," asked
Vice-Consul Moore, "to spread any such
reports around upless you could vouch for
the truth of the same from your own ex
perience?" y :. y
"I never gave the matter a thought."
Here Captain Caw slewed around on to the
chaplain, and asked him if he bad told
Mate McDonald the "-, ship was cranky be
fore or after the disaster.
"I talked to him in the hospital after the
accident, telling him I heard that the ship
was in that condition," answered the wit
ness. y .- .'.- y
"When were the -boys speaking to you
about the stability of my ship?" l
"I think about ten or twelve days be
fore April 9."
"Did they speak voluntarily, or did you
put tbe question to them so they would'an
swer in the affirmative?"
"1 think 1 only answered : that your ship
was heeling over a good deal. On the day
of the boat race there \ was a strong wind
and tide running, and she went over con
siderable.'' -: > â¢
." i "Do : you f not - think ;it was your duty,
seeing that you tooK so much interest in
the boys, officers and crew, to warn me of
any impending disaster?" y â -Â«â¢ yy
"No; if they thought: they were in dan
ger they ought to have spoken to the cap
tain, themselves. It was no business of
mine." '. 'â¢â , â¢ >
First Mate.Tbomas Smith of the British
ship Inverisk testified that he had spoken
several : times to 'the j dead; mate of the
Blairmore, and that officer i had often ex
pressed f himself _ very positively ; that :: the
vessel was r safe and acted in ; port : just as
she acted at sea in ballast, and he did not
think the ship lacked in stability. ;
y He was not asked how they happened to
be talking -â  of y the vÃlairmore â â¢Â» and her
chances. In fact, a number of the seamen
witnesses gave testimony which; looked as
though the- cranky condition, of the un
luc_:v ship was a general topic of conversa
tion on all of the vessels in her vicin it v.
Captain James Garrioch of the Ellisland
testified that the Blairmore behaved about
the same as his ' own ship and did not
appear to lack stability. He did not con
sider that the weather that 5 morning was
such as to cause any ship properly stiffened
to capsize. He thought something aboard
USt m a â¢ lifted, causing her to go over.
Ihe Ulan-more was not exposed to any
more wind than was his own ship.
First Mate Henry R. Leslie of the Crom
dale, who had charge of a rescuing boat,
first noticed the Blairmore careening to an
angle of 65 or 70 degrees. Other ships
were careening at the same time. He
thought that vessel was in an awkward
predicament with the tide setting one way
and the wind blowing another.
The inquiry will be resumed at 10 o'clock
this morning.

RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND PROGRESS
An Epitome of Sermons of the Week
Throughout the Land.
Following is a summary of the principal
sermons recently delivered in the United
States and Canada by the leading clergy
men, priests, prelates, religious teachers
and professors of the Christian faith. Id
every instance the full text has been care
fully read and abbreviated. y . â  ci Â£%
.'â¢ "-inconstancy.;-;; r iy;y|
I It Is better to be a skeptio than to be untrue to
one's intuitions, one's reason or one's con
science.âRev. L. B. Voorhees, Methodist, Nor
folk. Va.
hr'yti?, INDOLENCE.
The radical vice of the times is the desire to
get som.thingfor nothing, or as near to noth
ing as possible.â Rev. Henry Hopkins, Congre
gationalism Kansas City, Mo.
] virtue.
A life of sanctity and purity Is a more no
tent example for men to live by than any
amount of creeds and doctrines.â Rev. R. A.
Van Fossen, Presbyterian, Allegheny, Pa.
EQUALITY.
Every person born on this earth has the in
nate possibility of knowing God and of over
coming evil tendencies, gaining in the end life
eternal.â Rev.. Ida C. Hultin, Unitarian, Mo
line, 111. -.'-â â 
THE PRESS.
The daily papers are terrors to evildoers.
Vice and crime are kept in check through fear
of their power to check and expose. Reputa
tion is dear even to the conscienceless.â Rev.
Theodore Clifton, Congregationalism Chicago,
THE HOME.
The ideal home begins in marriage. A man
or woman may have a room where he or she
stays, but that is not a home. The priest
comes tha nearest having a home without
having one.â E. M. Wood, Methodist, Al
leghany, Pa. ' ; -y.-
HARMONY.
The great need of the world is a religion
which can harmonize the interest of the indi
vidual with the interests of society, which can
make the desire of the individual and the de
sire of society one and the same thing.â Rev.
11. Bigelow, Congregationalism Cincinnati,
Ohio. '
â¢* Vyy ORATORY.
We have all heard speakers who were rhetori
cal'and oratorical, but they said nothing.
Every statement should be clear. Some people
who are called deep are muddy. Like some
Florida streams, in the intellectual world,
clearness and depth go together.â Rev. W. H.
Moore, Presbyterian, Doylestown, Pa.
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. . 'â¢ â¢ sl.
Religious liberty is the most resplendent
gem in Columbia's diadem. Let not this jewel
be dimmed by narrow-mindedness and fanat
icism. This is a free religious country, and
church and synagogue, with the aid of the free
press, are the powers behind the throne.â Rev.
L. Wintner, Hebrew, Brooklyn, N.Y. y y
-â â â . WORK.
Work is a necessity. Work tells! No matter
by whom it is done. A dollar of help is a dol
lar to be credited on the right side of God's
ledger, whether it comes from the kidgloved
hand of the refined or the begrimed hand of
the artisan.â Rev. Richard Harcourt, Metho
dist, Philadelphia, Pa.
; TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW. â¢ y
To-day the riches of the world, and the
pleasures of the world, and the honors of the
world are the things which clamor for your
attention and for your life, and you are to
make a choice between them and the glory
that shall be revealed hereafter.â Rev. Dr.
Smart, Methodist, Memphis, Term.
MUNICIPAL EVILS.
There are ! three organized iniquities, para
sites on modern city life, which threaten every
municipality in our land. They are the saloon,
the organized purveyor to drunkenness; the
brothel, the organized caterer to human lust,
and the gambling hell, which is the business
manager for the gambling mania.â Rev. J. F.
Stout, Methodist, St. Paul, Minn.
GOD AND MAN.
God governs in the life of man by trusting
each with some gift. yNo outward array, no
numbers, nor mere statistical army, counts in
the kingdom of God. One â  single soul true
unto its ideal, one single soul sweet in charity
and true to heavenly instincts brings the king
dom of -God near.â Rev. William H. Rider,
Universalist, Gloucester, Mass. â  ;â¢
, -'.; THE TURKS. . "" \<
The Turkish Government has no right to
exist. It is fast dying. Heaven and earth are
against it. On the. wall. the handwriting of
destruction is already visible. \ The persecution
of Turk against Armenian comes from the
fanatical hatred of Moslem to Christianity, and
through the results of this same hatred the
Ottoman empire willy perish. â Rev. K. B.
Tupper, Baptist, Philadelphia, Pa. y
MANHOOD.
The true type of ideal manhood is not the
ascetic man with -:, his starved and weakened
physical development, but the athletic man in
whom all faculties are \ keenly alive, but held
in equipoise by the predominance of the moral
law in every part of his ; being. : : Not : outward
weakness, but - inward strength; must be the
test" of morality in life.â Rev. A. L. Hudson,
Unitarian, Salt Lake City, Utah.
.y WEALTH.
Spiritual riches, the riches of eternity, are
open to all, whether rich - : or , poor in - this
world's goods, and they will be given to those
who seek them in a proper spirit. , If we can't
have both .there is but one choice. Give us
the riches of God in preference to the wealth
ol man, for ] the former insures eternal happi.
ness.â Elder C. W. Penrose," Mormon, Salt Lake
City, Utah. y; -, - y â  .y. <' â¢â 
'.' ; * â â ';'' yy FRIGID RELIGION. ': ' ' â 
y Stiff preachers . make empty pews. The
preacher should prove himself the friend of
mankind. He should descend from his pomp
and high platform of empty dignity and come
among the people, speak to the people, and
show them that he is a friend of manhood at
large. Cold and formal churches make empty
pews. Christianity Is served too much on ice.
We want warm hearts, warm greetings, warm
handshakings in all our churches.â Rev. M. A.
Peters, Lutheran, York, Pa.
ARBITRATION.
In the bright lexicon of diplomacy there's
no such word as "arbitrate." There are in
trigue, scheme, bribery and coercionâ indeed,
all arte that play upon the sordid side of men
and nations, and that use dark and tortuous
secrecy; but to settle an international affair
openly in the fair field of Intelligent discussion
Is an innovation that a statesman of the old
school regards with suspicion.â Rev. Frank
Crane, Methodist, Chicago, 111. .- Â
; BPIRITUALISM.
What is known as modern spiritualism does
not necessarily differ from true Christianity
save on one . pointâ the possibility and fact of
spirit communication between this world and
the spiritland. As to the fact that there is a
spirit land, and that there are spirits there,
and that these spirits are the souls of departed
friends, and that we shall see them again, we
are all spiritualists.â Rev. B. F. Duncan, Con
gregationalism Utica, 111.
HEAVEN.
The belief in mutual recognition in the heav
enly world is as natural and as universal as
the belief in the existence of God or the im
mortality of the soul. Memory will accom
pany us. Death does not effect so great a
change as many suppose. It is not so much a
transformer of character as a transferer of real
personality into a new state of existence under
different â  conditions.â Rev. Amos Sherman,
Baptist, Woonsocket, R. I.
napoleon, jy.-y*
His was the genius of death. . His name
spelled horror and destruction and wounds
and famine and blood and fire to countless
thousands. Children were taught to curse
him who had slain their fathers; mothers
cursed him who had slain their sons. Strip his
robes from- him, dismiss his attendants, send
home the horses and carriages and what is
left? A scientific butcher of menâ a prince of
death.â Rev. Hudson Stuck, Episcopalian, Dal
las, Texas.'
SLANDER."
â¢ What right have you to defame your neigh
bor's character? How easy it is to take around
a little story about your neighbor, and how of
ten we find that those least merciful to their
neighbors are the very ones who have skele
tons hanging over them. Many a' poor soul
has been driven' to despair and subsequent
rash doings by the malicious tongues of others.
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."â Rev. Father
Dacey, Catholic, Lowell, Mass. s
UNITY.
I believe it would ao us all good could we put
Catholic and Protestant, the Baptist and Uni
versalist, together and tell them to find out
what is common to them all. and I have faith
to think what is common to all would be what
is best in each and thus living out what is
botn common and best we should find a pure
Christianity of both doctrine and action.â Rev.
Lee S. McCollester, Universalist, Detroit, Mich.
TRAMPS.
Four causes are assigned for men becoming
tramps: First, the drink habit; second, the
love of wandering; third, the evil effects of
the indiscriminate huddling together of men
and boys in our jails; fourth, this same indis
criminate mixing of country and city boys in
our reformatory schools. The number of peo
ple leading this wandering life in our country
is estimated to be at least twice the size of the
standing army.â Rev. Alexander Lewis, Co
gregational ist, Worcester, Mass.
THE RELIGIOUS AGE.
There has never been an age when men took
such an extraordinary interest in religion.
The secular papers devote columns to the con
secration of a prelate and the doings of the
Salvation Array. The President of the United
States presides at a meeting in the interest of
missions. Services for business men attract
enormous congregations in the two great com
mercial cities of the New World.â Rev. W. W.
Mac ley, Episcopalian, Westchester, Pa.
y?;Vy : ; AFTER DEATH.
We shall be somewhere, certainly. Any
where we choose to go, I imagine. Freed from
the body, the law of gravitation will no longer
hold us to the earth. Hunger and thirst, cold
and heat, will no lenger trouble us. As a
spirit the whole planetary system will be our
large house. ' We may go to Venus or to Mars
or From world to world at will, or dance down
the corridors of space to the music of the
spheres.â Rev. L. H. Squires, Universalist,
Rochester, N. Y.
GREED.
The desire to get rich has become in this
country of ours a fever, a mania, an insanity.
It is a golden poison in the veins of our people
corroding our private and public life, destroy
ing the beauty, the grandeur and mobility of
our American character. One of the outcomes'
of this greed for money is the corporation,
and I tell you that the struggle of the twentieth
century will be between the individual Ameri
can and the American, corporation.â Rev.
George C. Lorlmer, Baptist, Boston, Mass.
MONEY AND RELIGION.
Money and religion are the two greatest con
cerns of men. One sums up all that pertains
to this world, and the other all that relates to
the world to come. Accordingly we see that
one of the chief tendencies of men is to keep
their money | for themselves . as long as they
can, and then control it after, they are dead,
if possible. But there is still a stronger pro
pensity to make other people accept their reli
gion while they are here, and then to enforce
it some way - upon mankind when they are
gone.â Rev. J. C. Jackson, Methodist, Colum
bus, Ohio. â¢ : :â â ..â â¢',''-."â¢â  "â¢<"
STATUARY.
There has been some opposition to placing
the statue of Marquette in the pantheon of
great men at > Washington because he is
clothed in a black gown. Would you have
him in a swallow-tail and a plug hat, or in a
cutaway and knickerbockers and tan shoes,
sucking a cigarette? A dress coat made out of
marble or bronze is not a thing of beauty. A
sculptor has much trouble with a standing col
lar in granite. There are some hideous
Images around Washington. I would dislike
to see Pere Marquette looking as if he was
about to attend a Vanderbilt wedding. Rev.
Myron Reed, Independent, Denver, Col.
IMMIGRATION. ",-,â¢.
We do not despise a foreigner because he is a
foreigner. Some of our very best citizens are
foreigners, either of foreign birth or parent
age, and yet they. are loyal to America and
American institutions. But the vast majority
who seek our shores are the scum of all na
tions. They come to this Nation with no re
spect for religion, no respect for government,
no respect for home, destitute , of morals,
vicious and contemptible tramps and vaga
bonds. No sooner have they set foot on our
shores than they begin to corrupt society.
They despise religion; they despise restraint.
They love only that which is vile and debasca.
Infidelity is their religion, the saloon is their
church, anarchy their creed.â Rev. E. N. Allen,
Presbyterian, Kansas City, Mo.
A FRANK STATEMENT.
Mrs. R. C. Peterson, of Fairhaven, Tells

ness and Care.
From the World- Herald, Fairhaven, Wash.
s Mrs. R. C. Peterson of Fairhaven, Wash., who
has been for a number of years a sufferer from
nervous prostration, rheumatism and female
weaknesses, and .who has lately entirely re
covered therefrom, was called upon a few days
ago by a Herald representative whose atten
tion had been called to her case. In answer to
an inquiry, Mrs. Peterson said: â¢ ; y
"Yes, I was a sufferer for many years from
nervous attacks, rheumatism and other com
plaints.; We, my husband and I, expended a
large sum of money in visiting the celebrated
doctors of Denver, Salt > Lake City and San
Francisco, but my relief in all cases was only
temporary, and we had nearly despaired of my
ever recovering my health, when one day a
friend advised Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, saying
they had known of a case very similar to mine
where a wonderful cure had been effected by
their use. -â¢â "-.
:. "Acting upon this advice, as a last remedy,
my husband purchased a box of the Pink PillÂ«,
more to please 'my friend tnan from any belief
in the medicine. However, before the box was
half gone I felt a decided change for the better,
and after using three boxes was entirely recov
ered, and felt as well and strong as I ever did.
â  .'.'Dr. Williams'. Pink Pills have certainly been
a wonderfully effective remedy for me, and I
have; no' hesitancy in recommending them to
any one who was attected as I was." -
1 Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are not looked upon
as -a. patent medicine, -but rather as a pre
scription. -An analysis :of their properties
shows :' that they contain, in condensed form,
all the elements necessary to give new life and
richness to the blood and restore shattered
nerves. They : are an ; unfailing specific ; for
such diseases as locomotor ataxia, partial
paralysis," St. Vitus' dance, sciatica, neuralgia, ;
rheumatism, -1 nervous ",. headache, the after
effects of la grippe, palpitation of the heart,
pale ; and sallow complexions, : and the ; tired
feeling resulting from nervous prostration, all
diseases resulting from vitiated humors in the
blood, such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, etc.
They are also a specific i for troubles peculiar
to females; such as suppressions, irregularities
and all .forms of weakness, y They build up the
blood and restore ; the glow of health to pale
and sallow, cheeks. They are. for sale by all
druggists, or may be had. by mail from Dr.
Williams' Medicine : Company," Schenectady,
N. V., for 50c per box, or six boxes for $_ 50.

REMEDIES CURE
CATARRH MD ALL TIIROAT AND
LUAG DISEASES.
Catarrh Lea'ls to Indigestion. Insomnia,
â  Nervous Disorders, Consumption and
Many Other. Diseasesâ
, Positively Cures by His
New Method.
Catarrh, itself an unpleasant disease, is
an insidious foe and leads to other very
serious diseases. If not cured it will ex-
tend to the stomach and affect the diges-
tive organs, causing dyspepsia, which
makes life a burden. Weakness, debility,
insomnia and even insanity have followed.
Catarrh neglected also reaches the lungs
and ends in consumption and death. Dis-
charges from the Nose and Throat, Bad
Breath, Stnffed-up Nostrils and Heau .Pres-
sure and Sharp Pains in the Head, Dizzi-
ness, Sneezing, Nose-bleed, Inflamed Wa-
tery Eyes, liability to take Cold, stupid
heavy feeling in the Head, Nausea, Deaf-
ness and Hawking and Spitting of Mucus,
are some of the symptoms of catarrh.
. Are you a sufferer from catarrh ? Have
you taken all sorts of drugs and patent
nostrums ? Are you tired of paying big doc-
tor bills without being cured ? Are you will-
ing to spend 50 cents for a cure that perma-
nently cures catarrh by removing the cause
of the disease? If so, ask your druggist
for a 25-cent bottle of Munyon's Catarrh
Cure and a 25-cent bottle . of Catarrh Tab-
lets. The catarrh cure will eradicate the
disease from the system and the tablets
will cleanse and heal the afflicted partsand
restore them to a natural and healthful
condition. : Â», -. v.< " - .- v' ,-yâ¢\. ' ,
A Specific for Each Disease.
Professor Munyon puts up a separate
remedy for every, disease. His Rheuma-
tism Cure seldom fails to relieve rheuma-
tism in from one to three hours and cures
in a few days. His Dyspepsia Cure apead-
I ily cures all forms of stomach trouble.
I His Cold Cure never fails to cure the most
j severe cold in a few hours. The Munyon
Remedies are sold at all druggists, mostly
at 25 cents a bottle.

Position Taken by the Bay City
Wheelmen in the Relay
Matter.
PRESIDENT KERRIGAN'S REPLY
He Asks for a Thorough Investigation
sni That H s Club he Given
Fair Play.
President Frank H. Kerrigan of the Bay
City Wheelmen, after thinking the matter
over for several days and consulting with
his clubmates, has formulated a reply to
those who demand that the trophy won by
the organization in the recent relay race
be delivered to the chairman of the road
racing and record committee of the Cali
fornia Cycling Clubs.
1. Percy Mills, the referee, who is a mem
ber of the Garden City Cyclers, disqualified
the Bay Citys for an alleged violation of
certain of the rules of the contest, and on
this disqualification the trophy was de
manded. .President Kerrigan's reply to
the demand goes thoroughly into the mat
ter, and closes with the declaration that
the cup will be retained by the club until
the question is given a thorough investi
gation by the association.
The members of the committee were
mailed the following letter last evening:
' San Francisco, April 13. 1896.
To Menrs. G. JI. Stratton, 11. F. Wynne ana
A. P. Sicain, the Road Racing and Record Com
mittee of the CAlifornia Associated Cycling Clubsâ
Gentlemen: I beg to acknowledge receipt of
your letter of April 13 stating that the Bay
City Wheelmen have been disqualified iii
the recent relay race by the referee, 1. Percy
Mills, for violation of rule 4, which reads:
"Bed flags snail be placed 100 yards each side
of each relay, and transfer of packet must take
place between such flags," and requesting that
the cup be delivered by the Bay City Wheel
men into the custody of the chairman of your
committee.
I cannot refrain at this time from expressing
the deep regret which I feel that your com
mittee, in considering the report of Mr. Mills,
was unable to give the club most interested a
hearing in the matter. That this regret is
shared universally by all lovers of fair play
connected with cycling I can assure you, and
it seems to us unquestionable that the matter
of this protest should be considered by your
body as fairly and as thoroughly as the nature
of the subject permits. It is a serious thing.
The allowance or disallowance of this protest
will determine the standard of sportsmanship
which the organisation who control one of the
important branches of the sport in this State
have set up, and we shall all be judged by it.
1 have no doubt, therefore, that your com
mittee and the board of governors will readily
receive any assistance which the Bay City
Wheelmen may be able to offer them in finally
determining so important a question.
And that we are in a position to place your
body in possession of facts not yet before it
facts that had involved careful Investigation
upon our part and which must, without a
doubt, have a determining effect upon the
conclusions of the board in this matter it is
the purpose of this letter to show.
The Rambler cup is in the possession of the
Bay City Wheelmen. We feci that it was won
by that club fairly. It is a matter of easy proof
that should the rules of the association be I
strictly construed and Insisted upon, no club
qualified for the cup this year. No club with
the exception of the California Cyclers rode
over the relay course. A protest from them on
this ground would be equally as reasonable as
the one now under consideration. Further, no
club except the one last named and the Bay
City Wheelmen complied with the provisions
of rule 7. Would any true lover of the sport
consent even to remain a member of an organi
zation that would make use of such a ground
of protest? The California* themselves fur
nisned ground of disqualification for a non
obserVanee of the provisions of rule 4. and it
follows therefore that no one of the contesting
teams could be awarded tne cup this year ;
under, a strict Interpretation of the rules, i
Neither the constitution and hv-laws of the;
California Associated Cycling Clubs nor the !
rules of the relay race contain any provision i
as to how an infringement of them shall be
brought to the attention of your body.
The method usually adopted is by protest,
and there is some mention of that method in
the road-racing rules: but it is a serious ques
tion whether the committee should not take
official cognizance of any violation of its rules
which it considers important enough to dis
qualify a club, when that violation is appar
ent to its officials, even without their attention
being called thereto by other persons. Circum-'
Stances might easily arise where such a course
would be imperatively necessary in justice to
the giver of the cup. For example, the relay is
an unpaced race. If an official of your com
mittee should observe pacing it would un
questionably be his duty to disqualify a club
accepting it of his own motion. Even though
a tacit agreement had been entered into be
tween all the clubs to allow pacing, and not to
enter protests on that ground, it still would
manifestly be the duty of your committee to
disqualify them all of its own motion. -
As I have said, it can be shown that every
club except the California Cyclers violated the
regulations of the committee in such a man
ner as must have been observed by its officials.
A carrying out of the rules, then, on the part
of its officer* would result in your committee
awarding the cup to the club that was last to
cross the tape. I think it will be admitted that
such' a result is not to be desired.
The foregoing demonstrates that an ironclad
adherence to your rules might easily result in
a decision not only unjust and inequitable, i
but ludicrous as well. â â¢.â¢ -4.y V-
However, at a hearing before the governing I
body of the association we will show that the '
grounds of the 111-advised protest made by the
Garden City Cyclers and allowed by Mr. Mills,
one of their own number, were not "well taken.
We will show you that, as a matter of fact, the
packet was exchanged by the Bay City Wheel- '
men's riders within the flags; and, more than I
that, that at the time the question was raised ;
âwhen, by the way, the Bay Citys were some I
three minutes behind his own clubâ the
magnanimity of a victor the referee decided
the protest in favor of the Bay Citys, already
seemingly defeated. We will show you that j
the flags were improperly placed, that the dis
tance between them was some twenty-five i
yards less than It should have been under the
rules.
Our motive in voicing the public demand for I
an investigation of this matter is not merely a
desire to retain the honor of having won the i
race. We appear before you on a broader plane i
than that. We have the interests of cycling I
in this State at heart and feel that our club has i
done at least as much for the general good of I
the sport as any other similar organization. |
The matter before you is one of principle. On |
the one hand you have a cycling club striving j
to detract from the glory of the best run and '
most closely contested race in the history of I
your organization by interposing as an objec- i
tion to the awarding of the cup to the winning i
team a technical violation of a rule which
every one admitsâ even though It had been
violated, as Is claimedâ could have had no
effect on the final result; while on the other
hand we come before you championing that
broader spirit of sportsmanship which con
strues all rules and laws with the view of
effecting their object and of promoting justice.
It is not on account of the mere fact that we i
finished the race first that leads us to take this
position, for no matter what club had been j
protested on such grounds they would have i
had the Bay City Wheelmen with them in the
interest of "the sport and for the sake of the |
principle involved.
We wanted to win the race. But we wanted
to win it fairly and without taking an ad
vantage of the mistake or the misfortune of
any club. In proof of this, I need only call
the attention of your committee to the action
of our trailer, Freeman, in giving up his wheel
to Hardy Demiiig when the rider was helpless 1
with a punctured tire, and had the defeat of
his club staring him in the face through no
fault of his own. The spirit that prompted
such an action as that stands out in harsh
contrast with the position the Garden City
Cyclers have taken. - ;__B^Gn^M@s9&s
In conclusion, gentlemen, I wish to assure
you that no discourtesy to your body is in
tended by our action in retaining the cup till a
final investigation, and we have every confi
dence that upon that occasion the body which
you represent will determine the question of
its continued possession justly. Very respect
fully, Frank If. Kerrigan,
- ;,'. r President Bay City Wheelmen."
A MIRACULOUS FALL.
Young I.areaon'a Thirty-Foot \ Tumble
With Hones Intact.
A. Lareson. a plumber in the employ of
Henry Earrist. fell from the roof of a build
ine at 1411 Washington street yesterday
afternoon and escaped without a fractured
b"ne. .â -'.:' .';'.- ",
The young man was climbing to the
combing of the roof, a distance of thirty
feet from the ground, when a sudden gust
of wind caused him to lose his balance.
His body took a backward turn and when
he landed on the ground beneath it was in
a horizontal position. That saved his bones
if not his life.- y y
His back was severely sprained and will
cans'! him to keep his couch for some
time, but he escaped all other injury. y
Dr. Helme, who attended the injured
man at. the Receiving Hospital, said it was
one case in a thousand. If Lareson had
struck the ground in any other position he
would have been seriously, if not fatally
injured.

MISS HAAKE VINDICATED
The Post-Street Milliner Returns
to the City and Faces
Her Accusers.
The Young Ladies of Her Class Deny
That They Were Cheated Out
of Their Money.
Miss Alice Haake, the milliner, whose
place of business was at 121 Post street,
and who was reported as having myste
riously disappeared, has returned.
At the time this young lady left San
Francisco, it was rumored that she had
absconded, taking with her money of sev-
eral ladies, who had paid her to impart to
them the mysteries of the millinery art.
This allegation Miss Haake refuted, by
inviting the young ladies of her class to
her residence at 14 Chattanooga street, yes
terday afternoon, to give their versions of
the treatment, as also the instructions im
parted to them. The following-named
young ladies were present: Miss Jane
Aiken. Miss Ada Fulton, Miss Anna Sut
ton, Miss Mabel McDonald, Miss Elinor
Matthai, Miss Carrie Wyckoff and Miss
Bernice Lark. Those seven young Misses,
with three others, Miss Anna ,:^apthaly,
Miss Amy Sefton and Miss Jessie Hunt,
who were not present, represented all the
entire class employed by Miss Haake at
the time of her departure from this City to
Nevada.
Those present all stated that they had
not been defrauded by Miss Haake out of
their money, but on the contrary were
well pleased with their treatment and the
instructions given them. Miss Lark, a
pretty little blonde, had only been with
the milliner one month and in conse
quence of not having secured a suitable
place to continue her studies felt as if she
had not got the value of her $20. Other
wise she had no fault to find with Miss
Haake.
In explanation of her sudden disappear
ance from this City Miss Haake stated that
she simply went to Navada to sell an over
stock of goods and that she had no desire
to desert her class or j business, but | would
continue as before to make an honest liv
ing for herself in San Francisco, where she
was born and educated.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 18, 1896.
ANGRY ALASKAN MINERS.
Have Been Detained Here Four
; Days by the Charterer
of the Albion.
CROWDED AND OVERLOADED.
The Inspectors Stepped In Yesterday
and Refused to Allow the
Vessel to Clear.
There was almost a riot on Mission-street
wharf yesterday morning. The steam
schooner Albion was to have sailed for
Turnagain Arm, Alaska, with about 130
miners, five families and about twenty
head of cattle. When Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers Talbot and Phillips appeared
on the scene there was consternation.
They examined the vessel and at once said
that the cattle could not be shipped and
that only eighty-four passengers would be
allowed. Then all raised a howl of in
dignation, and for a time it looked as
though the promoter of the scheme would
fare badly. Matters quieted down after a
time, and an attempt will be made to get
the^ vessel away this af ternoon. .--â â 
Nearly all the men, women and children
who are seeking a passage to j the new El
Dorado are from Fresno and vicinity.
During the latter partof 1895 Frank Dusey.
a miner, returned from Cooks Inlet and
set the countryside on fire with his stories
of the fabulous wealth of the Alaskan gold
fields. Women caught the craze and in
sisted upon accompanying their husbands.
Men sold their ranches and business men
borrowed money on their belongings in
order to raise the necessary funds to reach
the land of gold. Dusey was unanimously
elected to bead the expedition, and every
applicant paid him $25 in advance.
The head of the expedition then came to
San Francisco and chartered the steam
schooner Albion. She is 165 tons net bur
den, 120 feet long, 31 feet broad, and 9 feet 9
inches deep. Into this space the miners
and all their belongings were to be
crowded, and of course there had to be
i space reserved for the crew, the miners'
! outfits, provisions and coal.
j As soon as arrangements had been made
i and the charter secured, Dusey tele
graphed to Fresno for the people to come
j on. They arrived here last Tuesday, and
1 ever since have been paying' their own ex
penses in hotels and lodging-houses.
Some of them have spent their all in pro
j curing an outfit, and are down to their
j last dollar. In fact one miner and his
i wife had to leave their hotel last night
I and seek refuge in a friend's house because
i they had no money with which to pay
I room rent. Nearly all the miners are in
; the same fix, and all laugh at the idea of
j wanting money ,in Alaska. They are all
! well supplied with provisions, clothing
| and cooking utensils, and that is all they
j consider necessary.
When they arrived here each man and
J woman paid $10 additional to Dusey and
then sent their baggage to Mission-street
j wharf. There was so much of it that the
j longshoremen could not handle it, and
i some of the miners were set to work on
| the - huge pile. When the coal and . pro
; visions began to arrive the wharf was
j blocked : and soon the vessel was down at
| her stern- to the guards with the qnantity
I of stuff rushed aboard. >
It was while this was going on that the
inspectors appeared and warned the cap
tain that he could not get clearance papers
unless the law was complied with. The
miners began to swear, the women to cry
and the children yelled in sympathy.
Finally a semblance of peace was restored
and Dusey started for the Custom-house.
He interviewed Chief Deputy Collector
Jerome, but the latter insisted on uphold
ing the ruling of Inspector Phillips. Then
Dusev, went back to the steamer and or
j dered all the partitions knocked out of the
I horse and cattle boxes. Carpenters were,
next called in and the cattle boxes were
soon in the process of being turned into
sleeping apartments for the men. The
work of loading is still Â£oing on, but the
inspectors will have to be reckoned with
this afternoon before the, Albion gets
away. 'â â ' y-- . .
I The smart schooner Sophia Sutherland
is also loading for y Alaska, but Captain
Oliver Smith will not take a t man more
than the law allows. The vessel has the
best of accommodation, and, given any
thing like a fair wind, she will easily beat
the Albion to Alaska. Captain Smith is
also an old Alaskan miner, and knows
some of the best mining districts on Cooks ,
Inlet. Many of those who were going on
the Albion have' made up their minds to
go with him if they can get their passage
money refunded. â¢ .. ':''- .'â¢â :â â >
f Among those who have taken passage
on, the Albion is C. T. Church, the man
who came all the way from Port j Harford
in a small sloop. y He expected to take; his
i boat with him, but now, for want of space,
! it bas to be left behind. -J He will send' it
| back to Port Harford on the ' next Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's steamer.

FRIDAY NIGHT CLUB.
Dancing Functions of the Season Ter
minate With an Assembly at
Odd Fellows' Hall.
The assembly of the Friday Night Club
at Odd Fellows' Hall last evening was the
last of the dancing events 'of the season.
i In the estimation 1 of society leaders there
jis quite a difference in importance be
| tween a cotillon and an assembly. The
latter may be enjoyable, animated, full of
proper life and decorous pleasure, and
even brilliant as a function, but still it is
supposed to lack some indefinable quality
i of excellence that stamps the cotillon with
a seal of exclusive splendor.
Assuming that last night's assembly
I would not assemble more than 200 of the
j flower of San Francisco society. Mr.
Greenway directed that the banquet table
should be spread for only 225, and the
! caterer provided for that number. â â¢;;â 
The decorations of the banquet-hall, not
! over-profuse, were beautiful indeed, and
J symbolical of spring. The professional
' decorator achieved quite a triumph, in
light and airy festooning.
The stage in front . was banked with
plants, ferns, interspersed with roses and
lilies. Beyond the column of plants and
flowers the orchestra of twenty pieces dis
| coursed lovely music. The music of an
j assembly ' differs in some degree from the
! music of a cotillon. In quantity the latter
j follows an arbitrary and fixed rule of num-
I bers. On the programme so many num
bers are indicated, and it would be out of
form to vary from the established chart.
The form of government ofthe assembly
is more flexible. It may indeed be elastic
to the extent of extending and repeating
music particularly fascinating to the
dancers. - :-;*'<
The hall did "light up well" lastevening,
when the director of illumination turned
on all the light* of the gas and electric
system with which the house is provided.
The high lights in the ceiling and the bal
cony supplemented the rays on the central
chandelier and imparted a brilliancy that
would have reflected honor on a cotillon.
The function was in all respects delight
ful and closed the season in a happy
manner. â¢â  â¢ -fy

SALE OF FILLED CHEESE.
Inspectors Find 125 Drums in
the Hands of a Local
Dealer. /
FAKE BUTTER IN LOS ANGELES.
Failing to Exculpate Themselves From
Guilt the Offenders Will Be
Prosecuted.
A law was passed by the last Legislature
requiring that all cheeses known as
"filled" and all oleomargarine should be
stamped as such. The State Dairy Bu
reau at once appointed inspectors, whose
'duty it is to determine whether these
spurious articles are being sold through
out the State. . .
Secretary William Vanderbilt, learning
that as large a quantity as 125 drums of
Eastern cheese had been shipped to a
wholesale merchant of this City, sent out
an inspector, who purchased a couple of
these cheeses and at once sent them to
Professor Hilgard of the State University.
His examination of the samples gave the
following result:
One sample marked "New York Full
Cream" contained only 5.46 per cent of
butter fat. 32.61 per cent less than is found
in pure cheese. Tha full components of
this sample were: Water 33.80 per cent,
butter fat 5.46, foreign fats 27.67,"*. casein
25.99, ash 4.11, other adulterants 2.97.
The other sample was nearer a pure
state. The analysis showed that the per
centage of water was 30.70, butter fat 19.61, j
foreign fats 16.70, casein 26.87, ash 3.63,
other matter 2.49.
The pure article should contain 33.55 per
cent of water, 38.07 of butter fat. 23.36 of
casein, 3.35 of ash and 1.67 per cent of
othef matter. :yyy; :, y
The , dealer in whose possession this
cheese nad been found was at once asked to
explain how he had come to inport this
filled cheese and claimed that he had
ordered the pure cheese. As he promised
to prove this by sending for the corre
spondence in full on the subject Secretary.
Vanderbilt has decided not to give his
name, to the public until he has had a
chance to vindicate himself. The dealer
said that he expected the arrival of these
negotiations last Wednesday, but they
arrived not, nor had anything further
developed up to yesterday evening.
The secretary, however, has given the
dealer to understand that no further time
will be permitted him after next Monday.
Several samples of suspicious looking
cheese were brought in yesterday and put
through the micioscopic test. No definite
results were arrived at and they will be
given a chemical analysis.
Though Secretary Vanderbilt is non
committal it would look as if the whole
sale dealer had been disposing of the
cheese to the retailers after he had been in
formed that the cheese was filled, in
case this dealer fails to establish con
clusive proof of his innocence in the mat
ter he will be prosecuted in accordance
with the law. -. y. . y..y yy
About 20,000 pounds of oleomargarine
was also discovered in Los Angeles, much
of it- being colored to represent butter.
No oleomargarine has thus" far been found
in San Francisco. Both the impure
cheese and the oleomargarine were im
ported. .-v-:-: :; y y.
Fully to understand the injurious char
acter of the , article known* as "filled"
cheese it is necessary only to understand
the process by which it is made.
First, the butter fat is entirely extracted
from the milk. Then a mixture of beef
suet and lard is added to the skimmed
milk, and through the agency of heat an
emulsion is formed. To this the rennet is
added, and the cheese made in the usual
manner. Of course it is only to be ex
pected that the more unscrupulous class
of manufacturers will use rancid lard and
suet from diseased beeves.
Neither can dairymen be expected to
compete against the sale of an article that
can be made so cheaply.
Teamster's Leg Broken,
A. Bacigalupi of 1 Joy place. in the employ
of Tay & Co., Jackson and Battery streets, was
brought to the Receiving Hospital yesterday
afternoon suffering from a fracture of the
left leg. ' '
He. was driving his team through the en
trance to the storehouse, when one ot the
wheels struck a post and threw Bacigalupi in
such a manner as to break his leu.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The weather of the past week has mate
rially improved the roads for cycling, and
to-morrow numerous wheelmen, who will
don the colors of different clubs, will be
seen taking an outing in the country. As

While the relay race and the trouble
that has since arisen over it have absorbed
most of the time and '. attention of the
Dr. J. A. Kuykendall, Captain of the Triangle Wheelmen.
wheelmen during the past week the cap
tains of the various clubs have been alive
to the fact that the touring season is now
open, and the above list of club events for
to-morrow indicates this fact. The par
ticulars of all of the above runs were given
in The Call yesterday.
Chairman Stratton of the road-racing
committee of the Associated Clubs has
stated to the writer that no action could
be taken regarding the relay-cup dispute
until next week. He received the answer
of the Bay City Wheelmen to his letter
requesting the return of it, in which the
club refuses to deliver the cup without a
hearing. A special meeting of the associa
tion will be called lor some night next
week for this purpose. Meanwhile the
club has possession of the cup and it reposes
in a safe deposit vault and none of the
club member's seem to know who has the
key. It is quite evident that the Bay Citys
do not care much for the cup itself, though
they will not give it up when they feel it
rightly belongs to them. Having won the
race on its merits a prominent member
tells me they are satisfied, and if the
Garden City Cyclers want the cup so badly
as to take it under the existing conditions
Captain Plummer will call an immense
club run of all the Bay Citys . and they will
carry the cup down and present it to them
with much assumed pomp and ceremony.
The agitation over the relay race is hav
ing the effect of causing considerable bit
terness between the four big' clubsâ the
Acmes, Bay Citys. â¢ Garden Citvs and
Olympics the association will": be the
loser by it.
It seems that . the winning team of the
Bay City Wheelmen will not be permitted
to rest on its laurels. Harry Terrill has
organized another team in the same club
which he declares can beat the winners.
The riders and their positions would be:
F. L. Day, F.G. Lacey, John Davidson, H.
B. Freeman, Robert L. Long, T. S. Hall.
Archie Reid, H. E. Mendell. Harry F. Ter
rill and Tom Cooper. Some of these men
are faster than two or three of those on the
winning teamâ Lacev, Long, Hall.
Reid, Terrill and Cooper for instanceâ and
as a team they feel sure of winning. The
challenge is being considered and may be
accepted, in which even Ulbricht and "Mc-
Crea would come up from the south again,
as it is specified that the team must be ex
actly as it was last Sunday.
The Olympic Cyciers will have a road
race over the San Carlos course Sunday
April 26, and'a large number of ,the mem
bers are actively training for the event. It
has been qufte a struggle for some of them
to give up the pleasures of life for two or
three weeks and go into the severe training
necessitated in the preparation for a bicycle
race, but many are doing it "for the spirit
of the thing, and.the race promises to be a
great club event.
The San Francisco Y. M.'C. A. Cycling
Club has reorganized under th-; name of
the Triangle Wheelmen, and the following
officers have been elected: : C. F. Steuart,
president; Joseph Sims, vice-president; R.
S. Boyns, secretary-treasurer; Dr. J. A.
Kuykendall, captain; B. W. Waterman,
first lieutenant; Dr. H. L. Diet* Jr., sec
ond lieutenant. .'#'-â¢â 
Captain Kuykendall- is well known
among the wheelmen of thisCiflr as a very
clever rider, and he should fie office to
which he has been elected admirably.
There seems to be dissension somewhere
among the makers of bicycles, for the idea
is quite prevalent in many places where
-the manufacture of cycles"is a big indus
try that it should be the sentiment - of the
makers not to employ racing teams. Some
of the 1 well-known concerns have taken
pains to so declare themselves, and there
is a likelihood of .*. combination being
formed to work ultimately to ibis end. In
case such- an agreement" is reached, and
the general opinion of the Cycle Board of
Trade-points- to -a withdrawal from the
scheme of controlling racing teams, it will
effectually result in the abandonment of
the National circuit. There can be no cir
cuit of this character ; under the existing
league rules without the support of the
manufacturers, many of whom now believe
that they can dispense with this mode of
advertising.* - ,y ..' . â¢'
Nevertheless, the fact is plain that the
racing man is a good advertising card and
the returns for the expenditure are ade
quate to the cost of maintaining the indi
vidual. In every city where a racing team
competes and the riders cover nearly the
entire country during the yearâ the benefit
in 'advertising, to.the firm controlling the
team is very great A rider is associated
.with the wheel he rides to victory. His
name is in the minds of all wheelmen, and
in recalling the name of the rider and
commenting upon his victories the name
of , the wheel he rides is naturally brought
to mind. It. is not to be. disputed that
some riders are paid greatly in excess of
their real value, but this, like many an
other matter, will reach its level shortly,
and then should the manufacturers con
tinue to support racing teams the riders'
services will be obtainable at a more rea
sonable figure. : :,"~. :â ::.
\ The mere fact of being mounted upon a
bicycle does not insure perfect enjoyment.
There are many little ; things to, be taken
into consideration, such as the matter of
adjustment, the knowledge of pedaling
and proper dress. But J more important,
perhaps, than any other one thing is the
matter of proper breathing, which often
counts as much as muscular strength.
Ti.e easier a person breathes the easier he
may ride, but by ease of breathing should
be understood long, regular respirations,
avoiding any tendency to abort, quick
breaths. Those troubled with nasal . dis
orders are often compelled to breathe
through the mouth, and when riding at a
good rate rapid exhalation is almost una
voidable. This manner of breathing is
always injurious and is more than apt to
lead, to heart or lung trouble. The mere
rapidity of , movement is not in itself suffi
cient to bring about this "shortness of
breath," as. it is. familiarly known, but
must be accompanied by intense muscular
effort in order to produce it, and may
therefore be attributed to general mus
cular fatigue. When a rider begins to feel
a weakness of this kind he should at once
reduce his pace, or dismount and rest,
making at tbe same time a practice of
breathing through the nose with slow ex
halations through the mouth.
Precautions of this kind add very much
to the pleasure and enjoyment of wheel
ing, and greatly multiply the benefits
that are to be derived from the exercise.
Every rider should learn something
about the wheel he is going to ride. Most
buyers choose their mounts without in
specting the workmanship of the wheels
or going into many fine features some of
the manufacturers have embodied in their
products. All wheels look alike from a
distance, but upon close examination a
vast difference is easily discernible, .yy â¢
America is no longer the only market I
for American bicycles. The manufac- !
turers in this country are more than will
ing to compete with the foreign makers on
their own ground, and for this reason the
exports of wheels to Europe have been in
creasing with great regularity. Naturally
the invasion will be regarded" in no kindly
light on the other side of the Atlantic,
particularly in England, but as the sun
never sets on the British empire, so the
day is soon coming when the sun will never
set on the country which does not pay
homage .to the skill and scientific fea
tures incorporated in American-made bi
cycles. ' yy

L. D. Cabanne, the St. Louis crack racer,
who was suspended for a year for having
participated in an alleged plot to throw a
race, is now circulating petitions through
out the West asking the racing board to
reinstate him. Cabanne" never admitted
complicity in the scheme, planned by F.
J. Titus and overthrown by Charley Mur
phy, and to this day affirms his innocence.
From the number of signatures he has got
to his petition it would seem that nearly
every one believes him innocent.
All sorts of "authorities" are constantly
coming forward with statements of what
it costs to build a 1 bicycle, presumably
with the hope of persuading the
manufacturers of high-g'ade machines to
comedown in their prices. One of the
most amusing in this line was that of a
man in New York State somewhere, who
thought he had discovered that it cost
just $16 50 to build a hieh-grade bicycle,
and pointed to the records of the law
courts to substantiate his statements.
It appears that a naughty boy in the
employ of a certain bicycle concern, whose
bicycles listed at something under $100,
being overcome with covetousness began
to steal. One day this bad boy walked out
with a hub in his pocket, and the next day
another hub and some balls of various
sizes, and then some spokes and then a
rim. Although the authority did not
enter very closely into details, it is pre
sumed that probably the day after, when
no one was looking", this boy walked out
with a frame under his coat and a handle
bar up his sleeve. At any rate he kept on
stealing until he had stolen all the parts
of the bicycle, and then was discovered
and arrested. His employers entered a
charge of grand larceny against him. but
were compelled to change it to petit lar
ceny because they could not swear that
the aggregate value of the material stolen
to more than $16 50. Thereupon
this authority immediately assumed that
it cost $16 50 to build a high-grade bicycle.
It is not on record that this wicked boy
stole all the parts of a bicycle, for that
would have been a large number, as in the
standard machines, for instance, there are
more than nine hundred separate parts.
But even if he had and the aggregate was
no more than $16 50 in value the author
ity plainly forgot to add to the construc
tion the cost of assembling, brazing, tru
ing, inspecting, enameling, nickeling,
finishing, packing, shipping, advertising,
printing, agent's commission, wear and
tear of machinery, new machinery, insur
ance, losses, guarantee, skilled employes'
wages, office force, royalties on patents or
, the purchase of same, maintenance of
plant, interest on investment, taxes, sup
plies, accessories and a thousand and one
other things that appear on the balance
sheet of the bicycle manufacturer. At
any rate he demonstrated that it is very
easy to jump at conclusions.
The regular monthly meeting of the
board' of officers of the North California
Division, League of American Wheelmen,
will be held next Saturday evening at the
rooms of the Reliance Club Wheelmen,
Oakland. The -treasurer stated
to The Call representative the other day
that the supply of roadbooks is now
nearly exhausted, iso that there will
only be about enough for the next fifty
new members or so. After they are all
gone the I members will have to await the
next edition, which ,will be out in July or
August. Meanwhile, however, the tour
ing board is preparing a handbook, which
will be out and ready for free distribution
to league members only about the middle
of May. This book will contain valuable
matter relative to touring, and taken either
separately or in connection with the road
book, will be of great service to the mem
bers who tour at all. The division is hav
ing made some elegant gold and enamel
lapel-buttons with the initials "L.A. VV.."
which are so expensive they cannot be
given to members free, but the division
will stand about half their cost. Notice
will be given in these columns when they
are ready. '.y. y y y ''

pounds, though the average weight when
fully grown is about sixteen. It is found
in abundance in the Sacramento River,
northward to Alaska, close to the coast,
and is abundant in the Columbia and
Frazer rivers in the springtime during the
salmon run.. It feeds' in fresh waters, un
like the other trout, which fast during the
ascent of j rivers, S consequently during its
migrations is plump and well fed. .

The San Francisco Rod and Gun Club
will give its next banquet on Tuesday
evening, and as one of the leading pisca
torial authorities of the country will ad
dress the members on this occasion a
pleasant evening can be relied upon.
It is yet too early for good fly-fishing,
but as the streams have become clear and
are rapidly assuming their summer ap
pearance some tolerably good sport with I
flies should be had to-day when the sun
smiles on the riffles. Trout will not rise
very well to floating insects until Old Sol
puts in an appearance.
The first day's whipping of a stream
with artificial flies is one of revelation to
the novice, and even to the experienced
bait-fisher. Its mysteries are not to be
solved in one day or one week.
For the novice to make a successful
catch with artificial flies would be as
logical as for a donkey to make a success
ful debut a* a country school teacher.
But notwithstanding all the little disap
pointments what can be more healthful
and invigorating, more charming and de- '
lightful, more pleasurable to soul and j
body, than to ramble by some sparkling j
mountain stream? If nothing else would j
dispel the cares of business, still trout j
fishing at this time, of the year might
reasonably hope to do so. You have no
boat to row, as: when fishing. on large
bodies of water, no dog or gun to care for.
as when on a hunting expedition; in lact
no incumbrances to mar the pleasure of |
the outing. â¢:; -
A light bamboo rod, a book of well
selected flies of the John Benn Kind and a
basket swung over the shoulder make up
the outfit for a day's pleasant angling on
some favorite stream. The real sport of
trout-fishing is in the dash of the trout at
your stretched flies and the successful
landing of the mountain beauty in your
basket.
To cast a fly lightly to some chosen
spot; to note instinctively the swell which
indicates a rise; .to strike at once, but
lightly; to keep your rod bent and at an
angle with your fish and your line taut, all
require a display of judgment, .Kill and
self-control.
The ecstacy of the moment when a eood
sized trout is struck is indescribable.
While the experienced angler partly con
ceals his excitement, the novice is set in a
Mutter, his mind is uncertain, his arm is
unsteady. What if the fish should disen
gage himself from the tiny hook, or break
the a air-like leader as he struggles in the
water? Only those who bear in their
minds, the tender recollections of that
happy.- moment when they found their
affinity have any memories to be com
pared with those of such a moment/Then
when the fish is landed, with what an air
of importance the sportsman regards his
catch. How it is magnified in his eyes!

Not far from Napa City and near a town
called Yountville live two . sportsmen, M.
Whitten and A. Patton, who aro the proud
owners of ; a pack of â¢ "varmint" dogs.
Some years ago a few hogs strayed away
from a band of porkers and ran wild
through the country east of Napa. All of
them, with the exception of one big fel
low, who has been shot at dozens of times
by hunters, have been brought to bag.
This nncaptured brute has skilled between
twenty and thirty valuable hounds, and
old hunters contend ' that he is as large as
a donkey and can fell a small tree with a
few slashes of his sharp and treacherous
looking tusks.
Last Sunday Dr. F. J.. Lane and R. D.
Fry of this City visited Napa purposely
to. join, a few lriends in a. hunt for the
terror of the hills and canyons, but it
rained hard and the hunt was postponed
for a few weeks. It is safe to predict that
if the dogs encounter the old boar in the.
latter's retreat, which is. at the bottom of a
deep and brushy gulch, there will De a
cleaning out of the pack.

aides away, and for an affair that none of
them could attend without an additional ex
rense of from $_ to $5. On the other hand we
id not feel disposed to tax our members for
the purpose of paying the attorney for the San
Francisco people, after they had just "put up"
money tor the purpose of employing an attor
ney for the Solano County end. We do not feel at
ill put out by being rejected from the Sports
man â¢ Protective Association of San Francisco.
i- we have always been able to look out for our
lelves without the assistance of any defunct
autside organizations, and can and will do so
in the future. ' â¢
r The present condition of affairs is as follows:
in 1&94 the Teal Shooting club of San Fran
r.sco got out injunctions against some forty
- Bye or fifty people, principally sportsmen who
Â£_Â£ residents of Solano County, enjoining
ihem from shooting on several thousand acres
sf land leased by them, for the convenience of
.bout a dozen wealthy sports. Money was
raised in Solano County to fight the case. We
were successful. The injunctions were set aside
by Judge Buckles. What was the result?
a. l er we " ad fought the case to a finish, boats
-na arks were moved on to the marsh by a lot
Dt scab hunters from San Francisco", who
*Â° ul not put UD a nickel to fight the case, or
who did not have backbone enough to go on
to the marsh until it was thrown open by the
rolano County sportsmen.
I Every man who put up a dollar to fight that
iase got good return? for hiÂ« money. There is
lust this about it: lf the Solano County people
so not stand together on propositions of this
kind it will not be many years until they find
themselves without an acre of ground to shoot
on.
At present wo have the injunction suit to
contend with, brought about by the Ibis
Club a combination of five men, who have in
corporated under the laws of. the State of
Colorado for the purpose of bulldozing the
people of this county and State. This case is
being heard in the Circuit Court before Judge
Deady. The Colorado incorporators are trying
to make our laws, and to tell us where we
shall hunt and what we shall do with our
swamp and overflowed lands. We do not pro
pose to submit to such action.

THE OARSMEN.
Crews In Training for the May Re
gatta at EI Campo.
A keen interest is being evinced by ail
the local boat clubs in the regatta to be
eiven by the South End Boat Club, under
the auspices of the Pacific Amateur Ath
letic Association, at El Campo on May 30.
All the boat clubs about the bay, with
. the exception of the Pioneers, have signi
fied their intention of entering crews and
siugle-scullers in the different events, and
the men are already in training for the
contests. lyyyy
, The South Ends have a plethoric treas
ury now, and will not be compelled to
pursue tne economical course with the
comtfig regatta that they had to with their
last, but will give prizes that will be well
worth the effort made to win.
Entry blanks have been sent to the dif
ferent clubs, and the list of races is as fol
lows: Senior four-oaied barge, junior four
oared barge, senior outrigger skiff and
junior and senior single-scull races.
The entries from the different clubs will
be as appended: Dolphins, senior and
junior crew and a single sculler; Ariels.
senior and junior crew, single sculler and
outrigger skiff oarsmen; South Ends,
senior and junior crew, outrigger skiff
oarsmen and two single-scullers; Ala
medas, single scullers and outrigger skiff
oarsmen. The Olympic Club Boating
Annex' will enter a junior crew, and it is
thought the crack crew of the universities
will also row.
The personnel of the crews, single scull
ers and outrigger skiff oarsmen that will
contest will not be known until next week,
as the clubs are now trying-out theis men.
The committee having the regatta in
hand are: J. E. Scully, chairman; John
D. Mahoney, secretary; Joseph P. ODea,
treasurer; John A. Lenahan, William J.
O'Brien and Al J. Fritz.
The South Ends' entertainment held at
Native Sons' Hall tne other evening
netted them a tidy sum.
The Alameda Boat Club has joined the
Pacific Athletic Association and elected I
William Craigh, S. J. Pembroke and J. W. j
McSamson delegates to the association.
C. H. Blanchard of the Alamedas'has
sold his ark, the Mikado, to A. P. Roth
kopf of the Dolphins. She has been en
tire! remodeled and will be used as a
* summer residence at Belvedere.
Mr. Pembroke of the club, whose shell
was cut in half last Sunday by a canoe, has
sent her to Rodgers' shop for repairs.
At the meeting of the Pacific Athletic
Association field last Monday evening
the following committee was appointed to
look into the matter of raising funds for a
big regatta to be held on the bay on Ad
mission day, September 9: J. Nolan of the
Ariels, A. P. Rothkopf of the Dolphins
and J. Lenahan of the South Ends. S. J.
Pembroke of the Alameda Club was
elected chairman of the committee.
The Dolphins have changed their junior
crew by substituting Ai Laib for his
brother Joseph. Joseph was- a valuable
adjunct to the crew, but could not con
tinue training owing to business demands.
The crew at present is as follows: E. P.
Sbllivan, stroke; Al Laib, afterwaist;
Fred Woerner, forwardwaist: W. O.
Patch, . bow and captain, and George
Roach, coxswain. ;, y
The duo's high jinKs and regatta com
mittee met at the boathouse Sunday and
arranged for several aquatic events, for
that day. A feature will be the canoe race
.between Judge Keogh and Lieutenant-Cap
tain of the Club Mo^an.
At their picnic to be held June 7at Sun
set Park several attractions will be offered
in the way of sport.
CRICKET CHIRPS
Regarding the Opening of the Sea-
son the World Over.
Cricket is reviving the world over, and
nowhere more than in our sunny Cali
fornia are there marked indications
of its popularity. The game last Sunday
of Ground vs. Ground at Golden Gate, in
which representative teams of all the local
Clubs participated, proved that the talent
of '96 is well in advance of last season.
Among the new members. Smith of the
Bohemians and Pollock of the Pacifies
promise to be most strengthening aid 3to
their clubs. The former is a sound bat,
stronger, perhaps, in offense than in de
fensive play. Pollock is not only an ex
cellent wielder of the willow, but is a use
ful change bowler and a good field. He
plajed for the Bakersfield eleven last sea
son and was generally considered the next
best player to the crackerjacfc, Richardson.
The first cricketing outing arranged is
for the Pacifies, who go to Penryn on the
29th prox. and play a two days' match.
The vacancy in the team now on its way
to England from Melbourne, which was
caused by the inability of C. T. B. Turner
to catch the Cnzco. though not yet offi
cially filled," will most probably be" taken
by Albert Trott, who is following the team.
It is almost certain that tbe Australians
will return home via this City, and that
'at least one match with a representative
eleven of the California men will be ar
ranged.
â¢ The officers of and delegates of the asso
ciation for the coming season are: Presi
dent, .J. W. Warburton, British Consul-
General; vice-presidentsâ R. H. Delafield,
D. Heartfield, R. B. Hogue, A. E. Coates;
honorable secretary and treasurer, Benja
min Clark. Delegates: Alameda C. Câ
R. B. Hogue, E. T. Randall;, Bohemian
â¢C. Câ W. Robertson, H. H. Cookson; Cali
fornia C. Câ C. Townslev. M. Moran;
Pacific C. Câ GeorgeTheoba'd, R. H. Dela
field ; San Jose C. C.-W. Ainsworth, W. S.
Mayo.
; The matches to be^plaved to-morrow are
junors: Alamedasvs. Pacifies at Alameda,
and Bohemians vs. San Joses, at Golden
Gate. The latter is not a cup event.
HANDBALL.
Bonnet and Harlow Will Play for the
Coast Championship.
The lovers of first-class handball are
deeply interested in the result of a special
match game for a $50 trophy between T.
F. Bonnet and James Harlow. â¢/
The contest will be', decided to-morrow
In the San Francisco court on Howard
street, and it can be very safely said that
the match will prove particularly interest
ing because of the standing of the players
and their ability to put up a first-class
game.
Harlow holds the championship of the
coast and he certainly is well able to de- ,
fend that title against all comers. - --'i- -
The friends and supporters of Bonnet,
who are many, are very sanguine that
their favorite will capture the champion
ship and the handsome trophy which has
been given for this special event by Gen
eral Phil Ryan. The game will certainly
be well worth going long distance to see
and no doubt the court will -be crowded
with the lovers of old Ireland's game
when the referee will call time for play.
The programme for to-morrow reads:
L. Carraine and G. McDonald to play P. Ryan
and J. Casserly, P. Hutchinson and D.Con
nolly to play J. Kelson and J. Slattery, J.
White and W. Stansbury to play M. Edwards
and R. Murnby, J. Lawless and P. Kelly to play
Al Pennoyer and G. Hutchinson, J. Harlow,
the coast champion, to play T. F. Bonnet a
single-handed game for a $50 trophy donated
by P. Ryan, proprietor of the San Francisco
ball court.
Coursing.
" With two meetings on the tapis, cours
ing promises to be lively to-morrow, and
should pleasant weather be had a large
crowd of leashmen will turn out.
At Ocean View Park a twenty-four-do g
stake, with entries of more than usual ex
cellence, \ will be run. Cottage Boy. who
surprised tbe talent by winning last Sun
day's stake, is again entered, and St. Law
rence will make his first appearance after
a rest of several months -on account of a
badly broken foot.

The Corkers' Outing.
The second annual outing of the Corkers
took place last Sunday. It was held on
the beach about one mile from Fort Point.
The banquet was under the direction of the
caterer of the Corkers, Steve Poggie, and
full justice was done to the excellent lunch
provided by hira. The Corkers amused
themselves in athletic games, foot races,
baseball,, jumping, etc. The feature of
the games was a wrestline match between
Tom O'Conneii and Jack Bendevidas,
which was won by Bendevidas in two
straight falls. The following were present:
Stephen Poggie, Albert Delehanty, James
Lewis, Thomas O'Conneii, John Bende
vidas. P. Grace, T. Garrett, H. Stelling, S.
Eldridge, F. Ford, C. Nelson. A. Wilkie,
T. Finnerty, John Boyle, M. Thomas, W.
Dwyer, A. Brower. J. Lewis, E. Winfield,
J. O'Conneii, William Love, J. Loh, L.
Fitzpatrick, J. Matison, W. Jackson. The
next outing will be held in July.
Bass in the North.
SEBASTOPOL, Cal.. April 17.â About
half a mile from here there was liberated
to-day a consignment of striped bass just
about to spawn. They were brought from
a lake near San Diego, and were the result
of the efforts of the Board of Fish Com
missioners to stock our northern lakes
with improved stock, and were put in the
Laguna de Santa Rosa. The local fish
club secured a strong ally to-day in pro
tecting their importation by enlisting the
boys of Laguna school district as a fish
patrol. There will probably be some sur
prised celestials before many moons with
this young army of bird-nest hunters using
their keen eyes on the lookout for nets.
ARRAIGNED THE TARIFF
Radical Free Trade Address
tO the Social
ists.
Legislative Interference With Com*
merce Declared to Be Unjust
and Unwise.
The meeting of the Society of American
Socialists at 26 O'Farrell street last even
ing was unusually interesting and well at-
tended. After an instrumental solo by
Miss Echison, Dr. J. F. Wetzell read a
practical arraignment of tbe present
social conditions. His poem was entitled
"Columbia, Weeping.' '
J. W. Dutton was tbe speaker of the
evening. His subject was "Servants Unto
Tribute." He declared that the people of
the United States were to-day servants
under tribute, although instead of being
called tribute it was now known as pro
tective tariff. He continued :
Strict justice would -seem to demand that
each member of society should be taxed in
exact proportion to his possessions,* but, un
fortunately, exact justice is to-day an irides
cent dream. Tariff Is taxation. Taxation is
an evil, and is only endured for its compensat
ing features. Trade comprehends every species
of exchange, and it is necessary to every class
and people. Exchange is mutually beneficial,
and not as the protective theory would seem to
insinuate, a commercial warfare. The protec
tive tariff is avowedly to prevent importation.
It has no revenue in view and creates revenue
only insomuch as it fails to protect.
Protection for whom? By whom? And at
whose expense ? Protection to American
labor is the sweet, soothing song of the siren,
sung only to receive the vote of the unsuspect
ing laborer. Where is there a protected em
plying capitalist who would pay more to an
American laborer than he would to a Portu
guese or a Chinaman who could do the same
work? If there is one he would obtain a high
price as a freak in a dime museum. Is any one
so unsophisticated as to put any faith in the
solemn protestations of unselfishness of pro
tected, capitalists. There was a time when
tariff advocates were so audacious as to tell us
that the foreign producer paid the tariff, but
this ground has been abandoned as untenable.
The person who buys any protected i article
pays the tariff, and if it be of domestic manu
facture he pays the price of manufacture plus
a sum equal to the tariff and profit.
If a protective tariff is a good thing let us
carry it to its logical conclusion and, like
China, build a wall about the country. If
protection is an equal benefit we would all
soon get rich robbing each other. If it is not
equal in its operation it is unjust. The march
of facts, the logic of events are emphasizing
the truth that legislative Interference with
the laws of commerce is politically unwise and
morally unjust. It is inconsistent with that
maxim of this republic which says, "Equal
rights to all and special privileges to none."
AN IRATE MOTHER.
Mrs. Connama Has a "Warrant Issued for
the Arrest of Her Daughter.
Mrs. Connama, living on the corner of
Hyde and North Point streets, had a war
rant issued â  for tbe arrest of her daughter,
Mary Forsyth, yesterday afternoon, with
the end in view of placing her in some
institution to keep her away from her hus
band. - ..â¢
It is claimed by Mary's mother that she
is three months under age, and that when
young Forsyth; procured the license to
wed be swore that the young bride was
over 18.
The irate mother would gladly, prose
cute the charge of perjury against For
syth, but she has been advised that it will
not stand. --.
At the last report the young people
were in ignorance of the danger threaten
ing their marital felicity.
Death of Philip Smith.
Philip Smith, who was injured by the falling
walls of the old- sugar refinery on Thursday,
died at 2:20 o'clock yesterday morning. The
body was removed to the Morgue and an in
quest will be held. .'..' â  â

judges first. The attendance was lighter
than usual and wagering in the ring
sluggish.
I The dumpy chestnut sprinter Gold Bug
had the honor of winning at the longest
odds. With odds of 15 to 1 about him he
passed Shield Bearer, who with Tim Mur
phy shared favoritism honors in the ring,
soon after the start and leading through
out passed the stand a handy winner,
three lengths before Tim Murphy. Fin
ishing next the rail, Levena C was a close
third. " ' 'â â¢ ,
Palomacita easily disposed of her com
pany in the seven-and-a-half-furlong run,
decided over the inside course, starting a
9to 20 favorite. Slaughter, who had tee
mount, contented himself with IS letting
Comrade, a 100 to 1 outsider (Rapido) and
the second choice (Belie Boyd) make the
running to the stretch, where he gave the
odda-on choice her head, and drawing
away " she won easily *by two lengths.
Belle Boyd took the place just as handily
from Rapido. ;~
The most closely contested race of the
day was the four-furlong scramble . for
two-year-olds, with ' nine going _to the
post. The Racine filly closed' favorite in
! the betting ai 9: to 5, with Lode Star at 13
|to 5 and Alma quoted at 3 1 .. the next most

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT
Congressman Powers Enthusiastic Over Paine's Celery
Compound, the Greatest Spring Remedy,
' ' '-'S -^ -â¢ -
Judge Powers, who to-day represents
Vermont in Congress, entered the National
House with a magnificent record as lawyer
and judge of the Supreme Court of
Vermont.
He is a fine type of â¢ the careful, learned,
New England lawyer.
Though but 56 years of age he was a
member of the Vermont Legislature a third,
of a century ago, and again in 1874 when
he was Speaker of the House.. He has been
State Censor,' a member of the Constitu-
tional Convention and of the State Senate;
In 1874 he became Judge of the Supreme
Court of -Vermont, and remained on the
bench until 1890, when he took his seat in
Congress. Judge Powers presided at many
of the most notable trials in the history of
the State, and is the author of many of the
most important opinions to be found in
Vermont reports.
No Judge on the Supreme Bench in an/,
of our States has a reputation for more
clearly and unmistakably expressing his
opinions. His unqualified indorsement of
Paine's celery compound in the following
wire, it looked as though Alma and Lost
Girl, who were heading the field, were
going to fight it out for tne purse. A fur
long from home, however, the favorite got
up, and in an exciting drive won by half
a length, with Alma half a length before
Lost Girl. .. ._; ..
J. Carroll's stretch-running gray colt
Paros landed the fourth race at a mile
very cleverly, after receding in the betting
from an 8. to 5 favorite to a sto 1 third
choice. The principal play was on Sea
side, who was first in demand around post
time at sto 2. Flynn on the \ outsider In
stigator cut out the pace to the stretch, at
which point he was leading imp. Fullerton
Lass a length, followed by O'Fleta and
Arno. , â "> .â  'â  , j'.
The result looked doubtful until a fur
long from the stand; when- Paros . came
irom the rear and assuming the lead won
easilg with Arno in the place, a length be
fore Instigator. Seaside was fourth.
With but 89 pounds in the saddle, Joe
Terry was backed down from evens to 7 to
10 to win the event following, a six-fur
long selling dash, and \ ridden out he
passed the wire a length before Don Caesar,
a3oto 1 shot. All Over, heavily played
for the place, was a close third.
The last race on the card, over a mile,
was gathered in by Zeke Abraham's geld
ing Pollock, who went back in the betting
from 4t07t0 1. The lightweight took the
lead at the jump, and in a hard drive the
last furlong beat the sto 2 favorite Rebel
lion out a head. Trix finished a poor
third. _______

down from 20 to 8 to 1, and ran a most
creditable race.
Entries for the Indiana Derby, to be run
at Sheffield track Saturday, May 9, close
with Secretary ' William C. Graveling, 130
Adams street, Chicago, on April 27. The
value of the stake is $1000 to the winner.
The distance is one mile and a furlong.
A novel race is in .tore for race-goers, to
be decided on Wednesday, April 22. It
will be a private sweepstake of $25 each,
with $300 to De added by the California
Jockey Club. The distance is seven fur
longs and the entries are: ' Ferrier, Mr.
Hobart; Service, S. C. . Hildreth, and
Logan, Alex Shields. Owners to ride at
not less than 160 pounds; weights to be
stated. The race grew out of some jolly
bantering on the Dart of all three turfmen
named and : should prove a decidedly
strong drawing card. â - â¢. - - ; r
Considerable fault was found with
Slaughter's ride on Shield Bearer, but it is
said' the boy rode -according to instruc
tions, which were' not to go out in front.
He took the horse back ano was unfortun
ate in being cut off, .
Old Tim Murphy seems to be suffering a
streak of bad luck of late. With as good a
break '4 as Shield Bearer got the purse
would undoubtedly have been his.'/

Poor judgment seems to have been ex
ercised in picking out races for Rapido or
be should have been < scored; a winning
bracket ere now. y '
The performance of Dura, the daughter
of Racine,' was a most creditable one, con
letter is as straightforward and . concise as
any one of his thoughtful charges to a jury :
House of Representatives, U. S.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 19, 1896.
I have for several years been acquainted
with â¢ the medicinal qualities of Paine's
celery compound and can enthusiastically
indorse it as a specific in many cases for
which its use is recommended by its pro-
prietors.;
H. Henry Powers,
i. Ist Dist. Vt.
By far the best use that any tired or
ailing person can make of these precious
spring days is to purify tfieir blood and
regulate their nerves with Paine's celery
compound. It is plain to any observant
person that the best remedy for neuralgia,
persistent headaches and such like indica-
tions of low nervous vigor is the one that
most rapidly and completely nourishes
the worn out parts. , It is not in the power
of any other remedy to do the vigorous
work of Paine's celery compound in
strengthening the jaded system and in
bringing it back ,to an energetic, healthy j
conuition. - â¢ -- - . \
sidering the track, which was not light
ning fast, and the strong wind that was
blowing.
It was intimated tbat after Thursday's
sprinting race for which Faro was a favor
ite that he was a "dead one." If he was
the Angel Gabriel's awakening horn had
not yet blown, for he appeared to be just
as much a "corpse" in yesterday's race as
ever. ' â  .-. \ y^'f
: Tommy Butler's ride on Arno yesterday
indicated that the little San Jose man
must bave been "sawing wood" during
the rainy winter months. It would have
made Little Pete's eyes sparkle with de
light.
How much better performer is Paros
than the gray sister of his called Kat
rinka that White & Clarke brought out to
this coast about two years ago. Stony
Clarke said that she worked half a mile
in half a minute, but could neveÂ» get wit
nesses to substantiate the fact, and in dis
gust sold her to the Bakersfield turfman
and breeder, Charles Kerr.
Sir Richard, the gray horse, was a starter
in the fifth race, piloted by young Mr. Mc
lntyre. Mr. Mclntyre is not a very fast
rider, and Sir Richard finished outside of
the money, much to his stable's distress.
When Zeke Abrahams paid say $350 for
I Pollock, it was liberally hinted in private
| turf circles that he was, to use turf par-
I lance, "soaked." When, the judges hung
out the timeâ l:42â Zeke took an- extra
twist in his 4-karat: diamond stud, puffed
on his cigar, and said: "Well, I dun'no,'
King Thomas cost his wealthy purchaser
over $39,000." ...'.....
Long Lady commanded a deal of back
ing in her race, but Mclntyre was thinking
I of the poet when the barrier went up, and
i was virtually left at the post. .
A BUTCHERTOWN MURDER.
Ah Foo. a Chinese Laborer, Fatally.
: . Stabbed by a Companion.
Ah Foo, a Chinese laborer, waa stabbed
to death by Sing Lin "while the former
slept in his bunk on Thursday night. ,'. The
| murderer escaped. Both men were em
| ployed by Bayle, Lacososte & Co. at their
fertilizing establishment on Fifth avenue
and M street. South San Francisco. They
slept in bunks in a room adjoining the
place where they worked. Thursday night
the Chinese quarreled and separated with
ill-feeling on both sides. During the night
Sing Lin stole quietly no. to the bunk
where Ah | Foo slept, unconscious jof ap
! proaching death. Three 'times Sing Lin
I plunged his knife into the neck of his vic
i tim.. The jugular vein was severed and
Ah Foo died without . a ; struggle. ; Several
other Chinaman were sleeping in the same
room at the time of c the murder. ; They
gave the alarm; and 'a search was made
for Sing Lin, but he had â  escaped. â¢â  The
police are on his trail and his arrest is ex
pected. He is headed toward San Jose.

Goodness, gracious I'm well already.^ How
ickly Mitchell's Magic Lotion acts 1 *
The real danger that stares sick people
m the face is the putting off attending to
sickness and disease and letting slip these
health-inviting spring days, when every-
thing so strongly favors getting well. Thia
greatest of all spring remedies is doing an
astonishing amount of good these days
among sick people and those semi-invalids
who are "run down" by the long, trying
winter or worn out * and afflicted by
disease.
The soul and life of sound health is a
well-nourished nervous system. Paine's
celery compound repairs the worn, nervous
system as nothing else can do. It is the
one certain and permanent cure for sleep-
lessness, hysteria, nervous debility and
exhaustion, rheumatism, neuralgia and
the various manifestations of an unhealthy
bodily condition, such as languor, nerv-
ousness, heart palpitation, loss of flesh
and mental depression. .
With Paine's celery compound, return-
ing strength and cheerfulness soon show
that one is undoubtedly on the right road
to health. _y yy ;^-'-"- <: ''.
Paine's celery compound is the one real
spring remedy known to-day that never
fails to benefit. Get Paine's celery com-
pound, and only Paine's celery compound,
if you wish to be well.

NEW YORK MARKETS. "
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 17.â 'tendency
of prices on the Stock Exchange to-day was down
ward, owing principally to the aggressiveness of
the bear leaders, who are claiming that the ad
vance has been carried too far, and that a reaction
is long overdue. Particular attention "was given
to the industrials, and these and Manhattan scored
the greatest losses. Sugar was sold by a former
member of the Stock- Exchange, who is also a
dealer in privileges, and has calls falling due 10
--rn orrow at 125. The stock opened at 125 V_.
-broke to 123, and closed at 123V_, a net loss of 2
on the day. Chicago Gas fell from 69y 8 to 68y 8
on reports from Chicago that a decision in the
matter of opening streets for the purpose of laying
mains had been rendered in favor of the Ogden
Gas Company.
At the decline brokers who usually act for Chi
cago Gas people bought the stock and a rally to 69
ensued. Near the close,' under pressure, the stock
fen to 681 _â¢ . American Cotton Oil was heavy and
on liquidations the stock dropped svÂ» to,s4V_@
65V. and the common 2% to 12. A story was
â¢ current to the effect that the company could not :
meet its dividend payment on the preferred stock,
now about due. The report was denied, but it was
generally understood that- people closely con
nected with former insiders were liberal sellers.
Manhattan broke 3 per cent to 108 V. on realiza
tions and short selling.
The railway list started off firm, but the weak
ness of the industrials finally affected the market
and a loss of y_(iji% per cent ensued. Speculation
ciosid weak. Net changes show losses of Vtta'.s

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 17.â Louis advanced j
1 cent for wheat this morning and Chicago fol- |
lowed with promptness/ As to the trading on the i
advance it was no: possible to detect anything j
important, the pit traders rendering prices all the
assistance they received. The improvement re- I
ferred to took place . about an hour after the open- i
ing, previous to which the tone and feeling were j
barely steady and prices not much more than sus- j
tamed. The bulls attempted to start a drought
scare early, but were prevented from doing so by i
the Weather Bureau, which predicted showers for ;
the winter wheat belt generally. -
â  Receipts at Chicago were fifteen cars and 30,355 |
bushels were withdrawn from store. The North- i
west had 301 cars against 289 last Friday and 200 |
a year ago. Liverpool cables were firm at un- j
changed quotations. The. death of Ed Pardridge, !
the noted scalper, was announced about the mid- I
dle of the session, firmness following. Cutler A j
Co., who formerly traded extensively for him, ;
bought about . 250,000 bushels, the impression !
being that that was the remnant of his open con- i
tracts. Closing Continental cables were generally ,"
higher. Export clearances amounted to 237,107 !
bushels. May opened from 66c to 65% c, sold be
tween t>si_(.a)6-6__ and 67c, closing at 66%Â® |
663,40. %c higher than yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow seventeen cars.
CORNâ The same old story was repeated to-day. j
It was not active, prices followed those of wheat, j
and there was no news. Cables from Liverpool j
quoted steady and unchanged prices. , Receipts,
239" carsâ l 4" more than expected. Withdrawals;
from store amounted to 59.845 bushels. Export I
clearances were light at 75,303 bushels. May corn ,
opened at 30V_@303 /B e. advanced to 305_c, closing I .
at 30V_, Vs c 'Â° Vie higher than yesterday. Esti- |
mated receipts for to-morrow, 330 cars.
OATSâ Hose in strength obtained from the sur
roundings, but business was quiet and dull. Re
ceipts were 193 cars, and .000 bushels were taken
from store. â¢ May closed V B c higher. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 220 cars.
FLAX- Was steady. Cash, 91V_@92c; May,
88c; July, 91c; September, 92@93c. Receipts
were 26 cars..
PROVISIONSâ A slight improvement took
place in product, due to the fact that the receipts
of hogs were not as heavy as expected, and that
prices for them had advanced. The strength of
wheat extended some aid to provisions. May pork
closed -2*j_c higher. May lard a shade higher, and
May ribs be higher.

; 'DUN'S. REVIEW. OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 17.â R. 4 G. Dun A Co.
to-morrow will say in their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the past week have been 223 In the
United States, against 241 last year, and 36 in
Canada, against 34 last year.
The sudden change from sleighing to midsummer
heat has tested the prevalent Idea that good
weather only was necessary to bring general im- '
provement of business. Everywhere -there has
been more retail buying, and Jin some 1 branches
better demand at wholesale nnd at the works has
resulted. There is no abatement of the almost
universal disposition to deal with unusual con
servatism and not to anticipate future wants.
To many interested in iron ore and coke, steel
billets, Bessemer pig and various forms of steel it
may be disappointing that the forming of the
combines and fixing of prices have not started
again the rush to buy ahead of needs which mode
last year so memorable. But , it is not easy to for
get the lesson which the last year taught. " Bes
semer pig and gray forge are a shade lower at
present, .as is the average of all iron and steel
quotations, and obstacles to some attempted com
binations have not yet been - overcome. Tlnplate
makers are meeting, and some propose to produce .
steel for their trade at plants of their own. Their
unsold stocks increased in March 18,588 tons
more than was reported last week. y
At the West almost every town seems to want
steel for some building and good orders have been
placed .for bars by implement and car makers.. I
Heavy production of copper defeats heavy exports
and- 10!54c is quoted for Lake and" Spelter has
broken 10 4.10 c. '
.- The boot and shoe makers have put some quota
tions a shade lower since leather has fallen , below
the average a year ago and hides, to the lowest
average since November, 1894. having declined 3
per cent this week. The Northern and North
western demand' is I backward, though I the South
has bought freely. â¢'. ...... .
The Silk' Association states that 40 per cent of
the machinery and hands in the country are Idle,
partly because of Increasing Japanese competi
tion. .Several more woolen | mills have shutdown'
and some have â¢ reduced wages 10 1 per cent, while
many are 'working only half time. The demand
for goods does not improve. Wheat rose about 6c
last week, met some reaction, but is a shade higher
than a week ago. .'After remaining unchanged for
many days, rumors either way having no effect,
cotton ârose ' a , sixteenth on Â» Thursday. ; Heavy
commer?lal and. mill stocks hinder .most .buyers
and possibilities of .injury, to. the coming crop re
tard sellers at current prices. .--,â¢-â¢â¢" - ;;..

than in April, ,1893. Railroad earnings for April
thus far show a gain of only 2.6 per cent over last
year. The stock market has grown stronger on
stories about things done abroad, a few foreign
purchasers helping, though trusts weakened on
the signing of an anti-trust law by Governor Mor
ton. March imports were $3,129,455 smaller and
exports 512,366,107 larger than last year, and the
excess of exports was $9,144,015.

COALâ Harrison's . circular says: "During the
week there have been .11 arrivals from the Coast
collieries with 26.928 tons and 430 tons from Aus
tralia. The free arrivals for the past few days hove
all been delivered to consumers direct, so that the
yarded stock is not increasing. The yards gener
ally are pretty well piled up and, unusual, there is
an oversupply of some grades and a scarcity of
others, still consumers can al.va.ys be induced to
substitute another fuel ! instead of the one they us
ually utilize. ! Newcastle brands are In very light
supply and will remain so for several weeks to
come, but there are British Columbia steam Coals;
which can be advantageously substituted.. There
is no change of values, as the Coast mines are gen
erously-filling all demands and are prepared to
name low figures for future deliveries, if they did
not shippers from Australia and ' Swansea would
cut seriously into their trade. Freight quotations
for * Coal from " the Colonies â  and England â¢ are
weaker, as there is an accumulation of disengaged
tonnage in those sections,' and this appears to be
the port that most shipowners seek, although pres
ent and future grain freights are quoted at discour
aging figures. ' No definite Informationâ¢ from Aus
tralia has been received relative to labor troubles â¢
next week will decide same conclusively; as April
20 was the date named for the miners to go out."

90S Broadway, April 17. )
A circular was received by the members
of the various ladies' societies connected
with the Church of the Advent yesterday
that presents quite a contrast to the criti
cisms made by the pastor from his pulpit
a few days ago.
Some of the ladies regard it as signifi
cant, inasmuch as it assures them of the
hearty approval of their work, and asks
them to continue to work in harmony
with "the vestry.'*
The reference to the vestry instead
of; the pastor is causing much think
ing. It is construed as a desire on tbe
part of the vestry to preserve harmony and
to offset, in some measure, the harsh
words of the pastor, Rev. Marshall Law.
The members are also chafing under
what they consider a slight by tbe other
Epicopal churches in the city. . It has
always been the custom 'for the Episco
palians to hold union services duting the
Lenten season. When Dr. Lathrop was
pastor of the Church of the Advent he end
his church were always generously repre
sented on the programme. This year the
services were called "union services," and
Rev. Marshall Law and his church were
ignored. This was not noticed a few weeks
ago, but it is rankling now and, the mem
bers are wondering why they were ostra
cised.
In his report from the pulpit the pastor
said that the only department of church
work that came up to the full measure of
his hopes was the music. As the pastor's
wife is organist at a salary of $25 per
month, and the pastor trains the choir,
Mr. Law's remark is considered rather
adulatory, and the contrast between the
compliment to his wife and the criticism
of the other ladies' work has not helped to
harmonize matters. It was stated to-day
that the very first breach between the pas
tor and the ladies of his congregation was
when he made the remark: "I believe to
visit or be visited by ladies, except where
others (preferably male) members of the
household are known to be within easy
call." Mr. Law made this remark at the
opening of the brown trouble and it was
not appreciated.
Rev. Marshall Law used to live in Pen
dleton, Or., and a recent number of the
East Oregonian refers to his "cheap sen
sationalism" and his opposition to women
callers.
A. J. Reed, the treasurer of the church,
is at a loss to explain Mr. Law's statement
that he had never heard of his (Reed's)
resignation. "Rev. Marshall Law seems
to have tired of his fight aeainst the ladies
of his congregation, for I see by yester
day's Call that he goes hotly for the poor
treasurer and his fitness for so honorable a
position. Without any desire of adding
to the rector's troubles, I will say that I
expressed my desire to be relieved of the
office of trust, but at the urgent, flattering
request of a unanimous vestry agreed Â» to
continue to do my duty to the church, to
the congregation and to the rector. There
fore, I snail be found on guard at the old
stand as long as ray services are required.
I also expect that Mr. Law will apologize
to me for his remarks, which were* untrue
and ungentlemanly." yy
SHYLOCK IS DISCOUNTED.
An Effort to Pay 10 Per Cent Per
Month for Money.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 17.â A suit filed
to-day by Jacob Bretz against J. F. Tur
ner et al., to foreclose a lien upon certain
securities, shows to what extent usury can
go. The plaintiff claims the sum of
$55,434 19 as principal and $26,816 22 ac
crued interest, making a total of $82,583 36.
He asks 2J_ per cent interest per month
on $21,091 21, according to the terms of
one note, and on other obligations at 12
per cent per year. He also asks for $3000
counsel fees.
Turner in answer says he borrowed $9000
on December 16, 1890, and made a promis
sory note for $11,000, due in one month,
â¢which was repeatedly renewed until Au
gust 31, 1891, when he gave a note for
$21,091 21 in full for principal and inter
est. He claims plaintiff knew his finan
cial troubles and took advantage, and
therefore in equity and good conscience
plaintiff should not receive more than
$9000, with legal interest from December 16.
1890.
Turner made another note to plaintiff
June 1, 1893, for $16,921 80 on promise of
receiving $5500, which he never received ;
on a note for $3000, dated October 4, 1893,
only $2400 was received ; on a note for $2700
of October 11,' 1893, only $2400 was received;
on a note for $5000 of date of October 14,
1893, only $4200 was received; on a note for
â¢ ' $4000 made on October 25, 1893. he re
ceived only $3000; on a note for $523, dated
December 7, 1893, no consideration was re
â¢ ceived. and also upon a note for $2028 80,
dated September 1, 1894, the defendant de
clares he received no consideration.
. The financial transactions of Turner
have landed him in jail, where he is now
awaiting his attorney's effort to secure a
new trial on the charge of forging an in
strument, of which he was recently con
victed. The case is on trial before Judce

A. J. McMurtry left Oakland on a novel
tour of the Middle and Eastern States. It
is distinctively a California tour, and Mr.
McMurtry will talk and illustrate Califor
nia till he returns in October.
Some months ago several of the leading
business men of the State decided to in
augurate a series of lectures in the Eastern
States, the theme of which should be Cali
fornia. This was acreed upon as being
the most attractive method of directing at-

ten tion to the products of this State. The
majority of those interested in Mrs. Mc-
Murtry's trip are from the southern part
of the State, and his illustrated lectures
will deal largely with that section.
The remarkable success that has at
tended raisin-growing will receive special
attention and all the products of the State
will be largely advertised. Mr. McMurtry
carries a powerful stereopticon lantern
with him and for several months he has
been collecting pictures from all parts of
the State. Among his pictures is a pretty
colored slide of the handsome building
now being erected for The Call. While
the tall structure is being gazed at by
thousands of Eastern folk Mr. McMurtry
will call special attention to the fact that
all the material is produced in Califor
nia and that it marks a new ere in the his
tory of architecture in San Francisco. At
intervals Mr. McMurtry will send articles
to The Call telling of the manner in
which California information is being re
ceived and acted upon.
A considerable portion of the trip will
be made on a wheel specially built for the
purpose, so as to make it easy to transport
his outfit., He will be in attendance at
several trade conventions, merchants'
meetings and similar gatherings, and
wherever an opportunity is presented
he will lecture yon and illustrate
California. His bicycle is being specially
enameled in red, white and blue stripes,
and the word "California" will be dis
played in bright \ gold letters on a scroll
that will be fixed inside the steering-wheel.
After concluding his Eastern trip Mr.
McMurtry will go through Great Britain
and continue the same methods of calling
attention to this State.
He will start out from Toledo, Ohio, in
about a week, and the result of this novel
method of calling attention to California
will be closely watched.

THE ALAMEDA MEMORIAL
Effor's to Endow a Bed in the
Children's Hospital Meet
With Success.
Opening of Encinal Hall by a Ball.
Meeting of the Woman's Suf
frage Society.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 17.â The city ;
turned out in great style to-night to wit
ness the performance of the operetta, "The
Rival Queens," atLinderman Opera-house.
The place was crowded to the doors and
the aisles and passageways were blocked.
The object of the entertainment is to en
dow a memorial bed in the Children's Hos
pital, San Francisco, which will be known
as the "Alameda bed" aud is for the use of
the afflicted little ones of this city.
Mrs. C. L. Tilden has been the main
soring of the whole works, and her aims
laudably carried out by a cohort of en
thusiastic workers of all ages and sexes re
sulted in a great success. The idea as soon
as mooted "caught on" and voluntary con
tributions poured in upon Mrs. Tilden
from all sides for such a meritorious work.
The Entre Nous Whist Club led the way
with $50 from its funds, $11 came from
other wellwishers and $10 a year from two
other ardent supporters. Miss Irene
Hogue gave a bedspread and two bath
towels, the Misses Mitchell and Miss: Til
den one bedspread each, Mrs. H. R. Wil
liams half a dozen pillowcases, the Van
Sicklen children three blankets, so that
with the proceeds ot the entertainment the
endowment of the bed is assured.
The libretto of the operetta is from the
pen of Miss Camilla A. Lies, and the mu
sic for the same was arranged by C. H.
: McCurrie of this city. The performance
I was an admirable one in every way, the
setting exquisitely pretty and the
tableaux effective and idyllic. The dainty
boy, Cupid, wearing his native nothing
ness, impersonated by E. A. yon Schmidt,
threw the ladies into ecstasies. The grace
ful dancing of Miss Gamble's pnpils was
also a feature. Over eighty children,
beautifully dressed, took part in the per
formance, which is to be repeated to-mor
row night. The principals in the cast

WANT THE ROAD QUICKLY
Livermore Ranchers Are Not
Satisfied With Supervisor
Bailey;
A FOURTEEN YEARS* FIGHT.
Immediate Relief Is Being Sought by
Many Farmersâ lt Now Rests
With Bailey.
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 17. J
Some of the ranchers who are suffering
for want of what is known as the Arroyo
Valle road have written the Livermore
League of Progress complaining of the in
difference and dilatoriness of Supervisor
Bailey in the matter, and asking the
league to help them in securing the road.
. The proceedings in connection with the
proposed county road were commenced
fourteen years ago, and a few days ago
Judge Ogden rendered a decision, con
demning the necessary land and awarding
damages. Of course the judgment may
be appealed from, but it is the general
opinion that if Supervisor Bailey pushes
matters the road can be in working order
before next winter. '.
"The road is an urgent necessity," said
Captain Crosby, who has lived there fif
teen years, to-day, "and will open up a
large area of territory. Besides this there
are about thirty ranchers at present tied
up because there is no decent road to Liv
ermore. :,*
"One of the most active opponents to
the scheme is R. T. Page, and his opposi
tion is 01. the most remarkable kind. He
simply does not want his property dis
turbed and is indifferent to the rights of
others. He is a rich man and acknowledges
that the new road will increase the value
of his property, but he does not want to
have any changes made while he is alive.
It is a most selfish position for a man to
take, especially when he sees how a large
number of ranchers are suffering. Every
summer we g have to rebuild our present
circuitous road, which runs for a part of
the way through the creek, and of course
all our work is washed away in winter.
We have spent more on the present
thoroughfare than would have built the
best road in the State.
"There has also been another strong op
position from the cattlemen who herd
I their stock on the Government land,
j When the mad is open some of the Gov-
I ernment land will be taken up by settlers
j and the cattle will not have free pasturage.
I Somehow or other Supervisor Bailey has
| been far more favorable to the wealthy op
position than to the poor ranchers, and
we are glad that Judee Ogden has opened
the way for relief. It rests with Super
visor Bailey now. As soon as he carries
the matter through in the county board
we shall have something done, and we
cannot have it too soon. The Livermore
League of Progress will bring its influence
to bear and try to help us. The land to
be benefited is particularly rich and pro
duces the finest fruits. The new road will
be about four and a quarter miles long,
and $1000 properly applied will make the
road passable. We have suffered long
enough and ought to be given immediate
relief."

BETTER THAN OLD GREEKS.
Berkeley Ath'etes Training Hard for
the Coming Field Daysâ The
Eastern Team.
.BERKELEY, Cal., April 17.â The Uni
versity of California athletes for the most
part are well under way in their course of
training preparatory to the proposed East
ern trip, which will be made next month.
About forty of them are in constant train
ing on track and field in the various events.
Out of this number will be chosen twelve,
who are to represent California against the
Eastern college cracks. Two big field days
will be held before May 7, the date set for
the departure of the team, and at these
opportunities will be given the aspirants
for the team to show what they can do in
actual contests.
These field days will be the intercolle
giate on the 25th inst. and the benefit field
day on May 2 at Central Park.
; ft is generally believed in athletic circles
at the university that the team this year
will be stronger, taken as a whole, than
that of the season of '95. Thus far in the
season it has been demonstrated that in
some of the events the men are much
stronger than last year, and in certain
others slightly weaker. Taking the gen
eral average it would seem that their
strength has been augmented, and that if
they meet With no ill fortune they should
leave California next month with the ex
pectation of raising their record at Mott
Haven at least one notch higher,
gj In the annual intercollegiate next Sat
urday California expects to add another
link to the unbroken chain of victories
over Stanford in track athletic contests.
For this contest about twenty-five men
will enter. Edgren has been doing won
ders with the sixteen-pound hammer re
cently, having exceeded the world's
record several feet by throwing the weight
148 feet 6 inches. Last Saturday, without
any one to' press him, he threw 141 feet.
These figures show that he is now far more
capable in his special event than last year.
His best throw on the trio of '95 was 134
feet at Mott Haven. Two bicycle cracks
have been developed in Crafts and Cush
ing. They will undoubtedly make an
interesting race in the intercollegiate next
Saturday. As for the hurdles, Torrey is
stronger than ever and it is anticipated
that he will lower his phenomenal record
of 15 4-5 for the 120 and equal the world's
record of 15 3-5 at his very first contest.
The men who are now trying for the 100
--yard dash are Chick, Hupp, Dickie,
Thompson, Cross and Thomas. Dickie
gives promise of developing into a ten
second man before the close of the season,
having made the distance in 10 2-5 last
Saturday. Chick, with his record of 8 1-5
for the 75-yard dash, will push Dickie hard
for first place. Dickie is much stronger at
the finish, however, than Chick. Colonel
George Edwards said to-day that he ex
pected Dickie to make the 100 in 10 seconds
before the close of the season. Those who
are training for the 220 are Dickie. Hupp,
Thomas, Thompson and Koch. Captain
Merwin said to-day that on Eastern fields
Dickie, Hupp and Koch should do as well
as Barnes in this event. Barnes' best time
was 22 2-5. Thomas has had but little
training in this event, and it is conse
quently difficult to make a forecast in his
case. In the 440, Magee, Morse, Jones,
Harvey, Stevens and Sherman are the
most promising men. Regarding these
men Captain Merwin stated this afternoon
that Magee and Morse should make the
distance in 52 seconds on the 25th inst.
Carroll, Brown, Reeve and Gish are in the
880-yard run. Brown is out of the mile run
because his relatives do not desire him to
compete against his brother, is at
Stanford, again this year. It will be re
membered that he finished ahead of his
brother Dave in the intercollegiate last
year. '' > yyy
Jackson and Reeve are in the mile run
and should make Dave Brown of Stanford
lower his record on the 25th. **
With resard to the men in the other
events and their prospects for honors in
the intercollegiate, Captain Merwin said
the following this afternoon:
"In the yard hurdle Torrey, Mc
intosh and Bakewell will probably be the
three entries. The event will be a gift to
Torrey, with Reynolds of Stanford fight
ing for second. In the 220-yard we will
have Torrey, Bakewell, Chestnut, Wool
sey, Creed and Mcintosh. The result in
this event will doubtless be the same as in
the case of the high hurdles.
"Edgren, Dorn. Carver and Hooper will
enter the hammer-throwing contest. Ed
gren will probably make 140 feet and Dorn
125. These distances will no doubt give us
first and second. Wilbur will undoubtedly
take third place. ' y
"As for the shot-put, there will be a
struggle between Edgren and Wilbur of
Stanford, with Lloyd and Koch close uo.
Both of the two last-mentioned men have
been putting j the weight over 40 feet in
practice lately. â¢
"Lloyd and Mum ma will enter the pole
vault aeainst Dole of Stanford. Dole will
probably break the coast record of 10:GlÂ£ if
pushed by Lloyd. _
"I am confident that Berkeley will take
first and second in the high jump if we
have Miller, Koch and Bakewell. \ Koch
has a record of 5 feet 11 inches, and Miller
can do 5 feet 8 inches.
."In the running broad jump Koch,
Dresser, Woolsey and Hilborn have been
doing very creditable work lately, and we
may look: for first and probably second
place if Woolsey enters."
.There, seems to be some doubt as to
whether the University of j California will
win the intercollegiate this year by as large
a margin as in former years, on account of
the strenuous effort Stanford has been ex
erting tids year to raise their standard of
track and field athletics.
The Berkeley athletes are now, almost
to a single man, observing the strictest
training .rules, and are making a steady
and perceptible advance in their condition.
Captain Merwin gives them a course of ex
ercise in the gymnasium each day before
permitting them to go on the track, and a
professional rubber has been employed" to
look after their muscles at the conclusion
of each afternoon's training,
y The sum on which the team will be sent
across the continent this year is steadily
increasing from the proceeds of concerts,
benefit plays and individual contributions,
but the great bulk of the means is expected
to be raised at the oig benefit field-day at
Central Park on May ;< 2, where all the
prominent athletic clubs of the State will
be represented. The question of finances
seems to be the only one which is now puz
zling the ; ; management of the team, as a
sufficient number of contests have been ar
ranged for to justify the trip.
Another Special Election.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 17.â The Board
of Education: last : night decided to call a
third special election to secure money for
new school buildings. The. election will
be for $22,500, to be raised by a direct: tax,

ositions submitted to the people, both of
which were defeated. â :â â â â  -y A

every record of the A. A. L. will be broken
excepting that in the broad jump. _ A
large number of entries, representing
twelve schools, have been made. Several
new schools have entered the league since
the last field day, and they claim to have
athletes who will cause a variation of the
usual order of A. A. L. field days, in which
the Berkeley and Oakland High Schools
are far ahead of other competitors.

Reception to Rev. C. E. Jefferson.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 17. A reception
was tendered Rev. C. E. Jefferson to-night
at the First Congregational Church. Dr.
McLean made a brief speech in which he
said that the church decidedly favored Mr.
Jefferson as their future pastor and he
thought the man from Massaschusetts had
better write to his wife and tell her that he
was permanently detained and to bring
herself and family to Oakland. â ./â¢-'/â¢ .- - -
Rev. Mr. Jefferson also spoke and said
that he had not decided and would not do
so till after next Sunday. He asked the
congregation not to pay any attention to
any reports that were circulated, as he
bad not anything definite to say.

TRUST IN LIGHT FORMED
Consolidation of the Gas . and
Edison Electric Light
Companies.
BASIS OF THE . COMBINE.
Ultimatum of the Gas Corporation
Accepted by the Edison
Directors.
The negotiations for a consolidation of
the San Francisco Gas Company and the
Edison Li. ht and Power Company practi
cally culminated yesterday in an agree
ment to combine. In consequence of the
reported agreement the stock of each cor
poration advanced several points.
Some weeks since The Call published a
statement showing the basis of a proposi
tion which the gas company had presented
as an ultimatum. Prior to the submission
of this plan, Joseph B. Crockett, president
of the gas company, and George W. Pres
cott had been in consultation with James
B. Stetson ard Frank Whittier, represent
ing the Edison Company. This commit
tee of conference was in session from
time to time for several weeks, and finally
reached a common ground of agreement,
but when the compact was referred to the
directors cf the Edison Light Company
they demanded a larger interest in the
consolidated concern than the agreement
allowed. Thereupon Frank Whittier re
signed from the committee and L. P.
Drexler was appointed in his place.
In subsequent negotiations the gas com
pany did not recede materially, hut in
sisted that the combined capita' stock
should consist of 140,000 shares, of which
100,000 should belong to the gas company
and the residue, less 10,000 shares reserve
to cover floating and bonded indebtedness
of the Edison Company, should be allotted
to the latter corporation in place of its ex
isting 20,000 shares. This in effect was
giving the Edison I] y for its stock, whereas
lj_ was desired.
From sources deemed to be authentic
it is learned that the representatives of
the Edison Company yesterday decided to
accept the l- : , proposition.
The gas company people were very firm,
insist that the Edison plant couid be
duplicated for 50 per cent less than the
value estimated in the consolidation. Yet
it was also acknowledged that a duplica
tion of the plant would not remove the
competitor!.
Joseph Crockett, president of the gas
company, states that the cost of lights
will not be advanced to consumers by res
son of the union of the two organizations.
There is an apprehension among consum
ers that the urice may be advanced in the
future if not at the present.
The big contracts for lighting the City,
which will soon be renewed, probably cut
a larger figure in the calculation than the
question of rates to private consumers.

AGAINST CONVICT LABOR.
Manufacturers and Producers Trying
to Discover Its Local
Abettors.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation is making a sturdy tight against
the introduction into the San Francisco
markets of goods made by convicts. A
special committee composed of several of
the association's directors v in pursuance of
this policy, have sent the following letter
to about 150 of the most prominent busi
ness men of this City:
Fan Francisco, April 17, 1896.
Dear Sir: At a recent meeting of the board
of directors of this association a committee was
appointed "to discover the source of supply of
prison-made goods sold in Caliiornia, who are
handling them, the extent to which they are
handled and any other information obtainable
on the subject." 1 his committee met yesterday,
and has, requested me to ask you "to give it
such information as you may have in your
possession or be able to obtain as to the com
petition which you meet with from prison
mide poods.
Please let me know, if possible, first, who
handles prison-made goods in your line in
this City or State; second, the ex
tent to which they are handled; third, the
prisons from which they are imported; fourth,
such other information" as you may have.
Awaiting your early reply, which we hope
for by return mail, if possible, yours very truly,

MYSTERY OF THE
BABY UNRAVELED
Its Reputed Father Now
in the Custody of the
Authorities.
DENIES ALL COMPLICITY
The Mother Is a Grass Widow
Named Browning, Who Lives
at 130 1-2 Ninth Street.
STATEMENT OF THE DOCTOR.
John T. Flynn, Charged With the
Child's Paternity, an Employe â 
of the Labor Bureau.
The mystery surrounding the dead and
abandoned babe of one hour's age found in
a satchel in a vacant lot on Twelfth street,
near Market, has been solved.
The mother of the dead babe, a Mrs.
Browning, is under a physician's care at
her home, 130J_ Ninth street, and the
reputed father, J. T. Flynn, is in the City
Prison charged with the murder of the
infant.
Captain Lees has had six men on the case
nee the discovery of the little corpse.
The clew which led to the discovery and
capture of the supposed father and mur
derer of the child emanated from the State
Labor Bureau.
It seems that J. T. Fiynn in the employ
of the bureau had given his card to Dr.
Quigley, .who attended the mother of the
abandoned babe, to be presented to Com
missioner Fitzgerald for payment of his
obstetric fee. . ".-â¢
On the strength of this information the
detectives shadowed Mrs. Browning's
house, 130}_ Ninth street, with the result
tbat a full description was obtained of the
dead baby's supposed father and mur
derer, and his arrest followed last night at
6:30 o'clock.
Flynn has worked for the Labor Bureau
and on the organ of the Commissioner for
some time. :'y; *
When brought into the presence of Cap
tain Lees last night he conducted himself
in a natural manner, without being flip
pant or straining for a nonchalance. He
denied in toto all knowledge of a babe
having been born to Mrs. Browning and
that he was in any way connected with
the death and abandonment of the help
less mite of humanity.
The detectives secured a statement from
Mrs. Browning to the effect that Flynn
was the father of the child, and that he
had taken it away an hour after its birth,
ostensibly to place it in an asylum. The
story of Dr. Quigley, who attended the
unfortunate woman, corroborates her
statement in detail.
Mrs. Ellis Browning claims to have been
deserted by her husband four years ago,
and since then she has been doing the best
she could to support her two children and
herself. When she met Flynn things were
different.
When presented with a statement of the
charges to be made against him by Cap
tain Lees Flynn said:
"I deny all those charges in toto. I
called on Mrs. Browning on that evening
without any idea of what ailed the woman.
In fact, I do not know even now that she
was pregnant. I called there occasionally
and have been keeping company with the
woman for about a year.
"I do not know anything about a baby.
Of course," turning to Captain Lees, "I
am not aware of what evidence you may
have in your possession, and I do not wish
to be understood as disputing your word,
but I repeat that I know nothing of any
child.
"Early in our acquintance Mrs. Brown
ing informed me that her condition was
Buch as to preclude anything more than
mere friendship. it V?
"I called there that evening at about
9:30 o'clock and found her suffering from
severe pains in the side. I did not think
that it had anything to do with her pos
sible pregnancy. As we had talked about
a threatened abscess, I thought her suffer
ing was due to that cause. As her condi
tion grew worse I suggested that I had
better go to a doctor. She demurred and
said that she did not wish a doctor. I in
sisted, however, and wen. to the nearest
doctor that I could find. . I sent him up
there and told him to send his bill to me."
In answer to a question by Captain Lees,
Flynn said :
"I saw no sign of pregnancy. : If I had
I would have had nothing to do with. the
case. I was not there during the delivery
of the child, if such there was, and knew
nothing of it. When I went back to see
if I could be of any assistance in getting a
prescription I saw no indication of any
such thing as childbirth.
"I went âback at half past 1 and she
asked. me to walk around the block with
her little girl. I was gone about half an
hour. When I came back I did not notice
anything unusual about the room. Then
her sister asked me up to her house with
her. It was on Larkin street, near Ellis.
She carried. a bundle with her about so
long [measuring with his hands about two
feet.] I waited at the foot of the stairs
until she came down again, which was in
about fifteen minutes. Then we turned to
Mrs. Browning. After -leaving Mrs.

WÂ¥ IL.O
With Eczema
I was a sufferer for eight years from Eczema, but '
now am entirely cured. The palms of my hands .
were covered and badly inflamed; little white
blister* appeared, then would peel off, leaving
a red, smooth surface, which would burn like
fire and itch. On the inside of the upper part of
xny limbs, great red blotches would appear, and
as soon as I became warm, the burning and itch-
ing would begin. Night after night I would lie
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. â  I got a .
box of Cuticura, and a bottle of Ccticura Re-
solvent, and after a few applications I noticed
the redness and inflammation disappear; before. 1
had used one box there was not a sign of Eczema
left. I: can truthfully assert that $2.00 worth of
Cdticdua Remedies cured roe.

When asked by Captain Lees concerning
i the gripsack in which the baby's body was
found Flynn denied all knowledge of such
an article. Continuing, he said:; y
"I never had any relation with Mrs.
Browning except that of pure friendship.
I took an interest in her after she had told
me her history. My interest in her was
| that of mere friendship, nothing more.
"I know nothing about the birth of any
child, and as I said before, if I had been
cognizant of her condition I should not
have gone to the house at that time. I
deny all knowledge of any childbirth, and
still believe that the woman was suffering
from peritonitis. I still say that I know
nothing of any satchel or towel, such as
those said to have been found in the vacant
lot. I believe that lam a victim of cir
cumstances." y ; ;y y.\
Dr. Qutgley's statement to Detective
Gibson was as follows:
"I was called to- Mrs. Browning's bed
side at 11:15 p. M. last Monday. Mr. Flynn
came after me. When I went there I
found that the woman was about to be
confined. It was an eight and a half
months' child. Not having been informed
of the condition of tbe patient whom I
was about to visit I was comparatively un
prepared. After attending to the mother
and making her as comfortable as possible,
which took some -time, I turned around
and failed to see the child.
"On inquiry I was informed that it had
been placed in a bureau drawer. On re
turning later at night, and the child still
being out of sight for some unaccountable
reason, I again made inquiry as to its
whereabouts, and was told that it was all
right. I was afterward informed that
Mrs. Browning understood that the child
was to have been taken to an asylum by
the man who called for me.
"The names of the father and mother as
SLAUGHTERING THE DISEASED COWS AT THE ALMSHOUSE.
given to me were Harry Walden and Eliza
Prescott. I told the mother immediately
the child was safely delivered that it was
necessary to have the names ofthe parents
to file a certificate of the birth with the
Board of Health. She said to come to
morrow and she would fix up some names.
I told her there would be no need to fix up
any names, as I knew both hers and the
father's." yy&f y;ivi;
The statement of ' Mrs. Ellis Browning,
as made to Detective Gibson, is as follows:
. "At about 11:15 o'clock p. m.' last Mon
day I gave birth to a baby in this room.
My sister was : with me and the doctor.
Mr. Flynn sent the doctor to attend me,
and after the doctor left Mr. Flynn came
in and took the baby away, saying that he
would take it to an asylum. What he did
with it I don't know. Flynn is the father
of the child. I suppose he wrapped it in a
towel, ana if he did you'll find the laundry
mark on this towel [handing one to the
detective] the same as the one the baby
was wrapped in. I have known Flynn for
a long time. I did not see any valise in
the room."
Captain Lees stated that a subpena had
been served on the mother of the aban
doned infant, but that she was still con
fined to her bed and too ill for any one to
think of moving her, and added that even
if she could be removed he saw no reason
for doing so at the present time. :*>y
Flynn did some very effective work as a
journalist in Portland, Or., several years
ago, and has been employed for a time
recently on the San Francisco Examiner.
Three or four years before | his departure
from the northern city he held a lucrative
position as land, agent for Jonathan
Bourne Jr., the millionaire owner of : the
townsite of Grants Pass, Or., during which
time he caused no little public comment
by. his : extravagant style of advertising,
filling columns of the daily papers of this
City and ';' Portland with attractive dis
play advertisements, " and chartering
excursion trains in both cities to convey
intending purchasers to the new townsite.
â¢He has been a married man, but his wife
died a few years ago, leaving a boy, who is
now 12 years of age, and who accompanied
his father to this City about a year ago.
This child is now living with Flynn's sis
ter, who is married and residing here. It

THIRTY-ONE SICK
COWS ARE KILLED
The Almshouse Herd Is
Almost Entirely Ex
tirpated.
ONLY THREE ESCAPED.
Weaver Says He Is Glad That
the Board of Health Has
Set Him Straight.
JULIAN BLAMED FOR IT ALL.
Dockery and Creely Now Propose to
Make War on the Dairies in
v the County.
The Almshouse dairy is a total wreck.
Out of a herd of thirty -four cows hereto
fore confined in the barn of the County's
great charitable institution only three
remain. ',' '
Veterinary Surgeon Creely, Milk In
spector Dockerv ana Market Inspector
Ben Davis completed their joint inspection
yesterday morning at 4 o'clock, and when
the record of the twelve hours was gone
over it was declared that tuberculosis had
for months ran rampant in the herd.
Of the thirty-four cows in the barn fur
nishing milk for the Almshouse inmates,
twenty-four were declared to be totally
bad, seven with suspicious tendencies and
three wholly sound. Later in the day the
emperature of the seven "suspects" was
again taken. In every instance it was
found to have risen from one to three
degrees, and so Dr. Cre'ely decided to put
them in the condemned bunch. y; - >
About 2 o'clock in the afternoon Creely
and Davis, with Dockery keeping ' tab ,
began the - work of destruction. It was a
mooted question as to the best method of
putting the afflicted animals to death. The
master of ceremonies, Veterinary Surgeon
Creely, insisted that the only humane way
to do the thing was to send a bullet in to
the brain of each. This plan was accord
ingly adopted, but later results showed
that Creely was far more expert in hand
ling a hypodermic syringe than in dealing
out deadly leaden missiles.
It required two shots to bring the first
cow to her knees, and even then Davis had
to end the creature's sufferings by a well
directed blow on the forehead with an ax.
After this Creely discarded the gun and
employed only the old-time weapon. One
by one the animals -were led out into the
big ' barren pasture, and by 5:30 o'clock
thirty-one cows were stretched on the
field... "I-./'""' V ' â /: ; :."y
Davis wielded 1 the knife with a freedom
which evidenced his thorough familiarity
with such work. A few of the cows
showed that the disease had made but lit
tle headway, though in the main they
presented a disgusting Bight. Tuberculo
sis of the lungs was seen in every animal
slaughtered. Some were perfectly honey
combed, while others indicated that the
disease was of recent origin.
During the early part of the slaughter
Superintendent Weaver was an interested
spectator. He did not have to Task any
questions. The. little white patches and
protruding buttons told their own story.
He was satisfied that Creely had made no
mistake, except possibly in not â  paying a
visit to the institution months before.
However, he .; forgave these shortcomings,
and declared his intention of > keeping a
more watchful eye on this particular de
partment in the future.
The visit of the Health officers to the
Almshouse has in one sense s been an
expensive one. The ? stock destroyed can
not be replaced for less than $1200, and in
the meantime some seventy or eighty gal
lons of milk must be purchased each day
to take the place of that formerly supplied
by the slaughtered cows. Mr. Weaver,
however, does not regret this item of ex
pense, but to use his own language, he
does "sincerely regret being censured for
something which he could not prevent or
control." ,â¢â¢â¢ -';â 
The superintendent contends that Julian,
the keeper, is ' altogether J responsible for
the condition 'in : which Messrs. Dockery,
Creely and Davis found the milk-supplying
animals of 'the Almshouse. :â¢ In this posi
tion he is sustained by James Conniff, one
of the clerks. The latter said last night:
"I do not mean to reflect on Julian or
any one else,: but}.. I do feel > that Mr.
Weaver has been placed in a false light by
these occurrences. If the superintendent
had known - the "- condition of ' the cows it
stands to reason- that he would have set
about correcting it. It is utterly impos
sible for him to attend to everything in
person, and consequently he must depend
on the assistance of those under him. ; ;
"I have seen the cows ; fed and properly
attended to by the man formerly in charge
and nothing of this kind "existed at that
time. If the cows did not v receive suffi
cient food the ; fault â¢ rests entirely ' with
Julian. All that he had to do was to re
port the matter to Weaver and I am sure it
would have been corrected. The latter, is
greatly handicapped in being surrounded
by enemies, who during the past few
months have strained every nerve to throw
him down. When all this is fully under
stood I feel confident that the people gen
erally will appreciate our superintendent's
embarrassing position." V Â...,
It is the intention of the three health in
spectors to make an investigation of every
dairy in the country. They will begin on
this work next week, and according to
Dockery's idea some rich hauls will be
made. â â -.;.â â¢,-â¢--â¢ -
MORMON CHOIR CONCERT.
The Monster Tabernacle Chorus Be-
sounded Again Last Night.
Brigham Young's tastes seem to have
run particularly to big families and big
choruses, but while polygamy has long
been on the wane even in Utah, the mon
ster tabernacle choir is as great an institu
tion as it was when the Mormon saint first
organized it. ' y- :
The completion of a mammoth temple
of worship where the great majority of the
people of a whole city might congregate
under one roof and give expression to their
common faith necessitated a choir of ex
traordinary size to produce a volume: of
sound in keeping with the extensive
auditorium. And so it was that Salt Lake
City, unique among the cities of the world
for its possession of the largest tabernacle,
came to have a choir that as a large per
manent organization for sacred song rivals
anything of the kind in the world.
It is in the powerful, reverberating,
mighty rolling of the eighty or ninety
female and as many male voices that the
chorus is heard at its best. You look at
the tier above tier of women seated at one
side of the stage and all dressed in white,
and at a corresponding array of men oppo
site and all in somber evening dress, and
you expect something unusual to result
from the harmonious blending of so many
trained voices. At a signal from the
leader, they rise as a unit and the chorus
starts, perhaps softly gliding in the open
ing bars, only >to gush forth a little later
with all the force of its combined vocal
power. yl.y
. So large a company could not travel in
the West primarily as a business venture
unless they came very often across cities
the size of San Francisco, that could fur
nish the audiences that have been in at
tendance upon the concerts for the last
three . nights in Metropolitan Temple.
But they are on a tour chiefly for pleas
ure, and that's different. ;y:* ;^-
Last night's programme was essentially
the same as that rendered on Wednesday
night at the opening concert. The "Sol
dier's Chorus," from "Faust," was substi
tuted for the "Prison Scene" of Verdi,
and was one of the selections in which the
choir, all the members of which Bang
without notes, showed to advantage.
Master Charley Pike, the boy alto, sang
again Handel's "Angel Ever Bright and
Fair." He has a remarkable voice, and
the pity is that he will probably out
grow it. r, " â _â¢ . ', , . ;.''. 'y-^
To-night's concert will end the general
programme, and to-morrow night â¢ the
choir will give its farewell performance,
devoting the evening entirely to I sacred
music. ; ;..,.-y:.-

A communication was read from Ireland
about the great festival to be held at Dub
lin y early in autumn for the revival of
ancient Celtic melodies.
â  James Horan, secretary of the Balfe-
Moore Club and one of its organizers, who
is a : Celtic scholar, was unanimously
elected to represent the society at "the
Feis." This festival ; fis ; by/: no means
original, as when Ireland made her own
laws and her people were united, with her
ereat seats ;of , education the pride of
Europe, the inhabitants held the Feis
yearly for a week about May. ; . :
â â .' The greatest ? printing publishing
farms in London* <i have y collected and
written to music old Celtic melodies which
have never appeared set . : to J music; but
which have been sung and handed down 1
from generation to generation by the peas
antry of the country."
The Feis ; takes y place \ in Dublin in
autumn and lasts a week. It is intended
to â¢: be an v annual : affair- in ' future. Â«. Dr.
Charles Villers Stanford, an Irishman, is
to take charge.- He is % professor of music
at Cambridge University, author of count

THE ROAD'S NEW OWNERS
John D. and Adolph Spreekels
Bought Half of the Electric
* Line.
EMPLOYES TO BE RETAINED.
No Changes in the Personnel
Improvements to Be Made
Scon.
It was announced yesterday for the first
time that John D.'and Adolph Spreekels
were half owners of the San Francisco and
San Mateo Electric Railway, which was
recently sold at public auction pursuant to
an order of the Superior Court. , , ,
At the time of the sale the purchasers
were announced as John A. Buck and
Nicholas Ohlandt, but those on "the in
side" of the big deal knew that there was
other capital interested. Yesterday both
the Messrs. Spreekels mentioned author
ized the statement that they were half
owners with Buck and Ohlandt.
Another point of interest. in connection
with the matter is the fact that the new
owners took formal possession of the
entire property purchased yesterday.
When questioned concerning the con
templated changes in management John
D. Spreekels said :
"For the present we will not make any
radical changes. "yV
"The men, every one of them, will be
retained in the places they now occupy.
There will be no change in this direction.
The superintendent informs me that he
has good men working for him. and this is
all that we desire or all that we can get or
expect.
"Workingmen have rights that em
ployers should respect, and one of these is
to treat them well when they are found
true and faithful.
"The road is in need of repairs all along
the line. This will be attended to just as
soon as we eet thoroughly informed as to
the necessities, of the situation and the
need of the improvements. , .1 y
"The line has been somewhat neglected
during the legal squabble through the
courts. It is good line and can be made
to pay well when it is put in proper work
ing condition."
