MURDERED THE WOMEN HE HAD BETRAYED
Pastor Hermann's Record
of Deception and Deeds
of Bloodshed.
PROOF OF HIS GUILT.
His Butcher Knife Found in the
Furnace of Salt Lake's
Desecrated Church.
CHARGED WITH SEVEN DEATHS
Bslieved to Have Slain Two Wives
and the Children That Bore
His Name.
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 24.â The Scan
dinavian church, where the murders of
Henrietta Clausen and Annie Samuelson
took place, has been visited by large num
bers of people ever since the horrible dis
covery was made known on Sunday.
No services were held in the church to
day. The human remains, together with
the garter buckle and the belt buckle
which were found in the furnace, have
been so identified that there is now no
doubt that they are those of Miss
Clausen. One of the razors and the
butcher- knife, also found in the furnace,
have been positively identified by Rev.
Mr. Mork as the property of Rev. Francis
Hermann, who is accused of the crime. The
razor is of English make and was brought
from England by Hermann with his other
toilet articles. Several women say the
butcher-knife was the one used in the pas
tor's kitchen.
The remains of Miss Samuelson have
not yet been found, although every hole
and corner of the church has been
searched. The police, however, adhere to
the theory that they are hidden some
where in or about the church and to-mor
row they will commence digging up the
floor of the basement, where they may
have been buried. The grounds around
the church are quite extensive, and in case
the remains are not found in the basement
the grounds will also be dug up.
Another theory is that the pastor, after
cutting the body up, preserved the parts
in a trunk, which he took with him when
he left for Kansas City on May 6.
Miss Samuelson had been living with
the pastor for several months before her
disappearance as nis housekeeper, under
promise of marriage. She was last seen
on February 28. On that day she told her
Mends that <The was sblng to Ogden to be
married to Mr. Hermann on the following
day. The next morning the pastor was in
town as usual, ana told Elder Hansen that
Miss Samuelson had gone to Oeden and
that he did not Know when she would re
turn. She never did return, and it tran
spired that she did not go to O:den at all,
and the chance is that she was murdered
by the minister that night in the church.
When Miss Clauson disappeared in Sep
tember of last year there was a good deal
of talk and inquiry, and some months
afterward Mr. Hermann gave out that he
had solved the mystery of her disappear
ance and stated that he saw her in Butte,
Mont., where she was an inmate of a dis
orderly house. The story was never con
firmed, and there is no doubt, in the light
of recent events, that it was a fabrication.
Miss Samuelson's and a ring have
been found in a pawnbroker's shop, where
they were pledged by Mr. Hermann just
before he left for Kansas City. The police
here have so far no further clew to the
whereabouts of Hermann.
CHARGED WITH SEVEN MURDERS.
Hermann's Record of Crime Rivals That
of Holmes.
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 24.â The de-
Yelopments in the church tragedy in this
city lead to the belief that the Rev.
Francis Hermann is a man with a record
of crime little less than the notorious
Holmes. His first wife died in England
under suspicious circumstances. He was
pastor of a Scandinavian church at West
Superior, Wis., in 1890 and 1891, and there
married a highly respectable lady, who in
less than a year died very suddenly with
her two weeks' old baby.
An inquest was held, but nothing be
yond a suspicion of foul play was elicited.
Hermann Boon married again and came to
Salt Lake in 1894 with his wife. Before
long a baby was born and the mother and
child died suddenly a few weeks after
ward.
Then his acquaintance with Miss CJau
eon commenced, and it is charged in the
complaint which has been sworn to by
John Sanson, a member of the church
here, that be murdered and cremated the
body in the heating furnace in the church
basement.
Hermann was engaged to marry Miss
Bamuelson in February of this year, but
she disappeared, and it is charged that he
poisoned her and carved up the body in
the church cellar.
As far as yet discovered it is believed
Hermann has murdered seven persons.
Miss Clauson came to Salt Lake from
Omaha seven years ago. She was a native
Of Sweden and as far as known had no
relatives in this country, but she had
many friends here and was considered a
good and respectable girl. Miss Samuel
son was employed as a nursery governess
in a good family here and left her place to
be married to the preacher. She had an
aunt and other relatives living here and
was a member of Hermann's church.
The church officers say that Hermann
was suspended recently for embezzling
church funds, confessed his guilt in that
regard, and was waiting a hearing before
the annual Methodist Conference. He
was a fine-looking man and very generally
liked. He is represented as having a great
liking for the study of medicine, anatomy
and kindred subjects, and often delivered
disquisitions on the human form.
HER FES WAS SILENCED.
St. Louis Friend* Wondered H li ,, MisM
f law on IMd Jfot Write.
OMAHA, Neb., May 24.â Miss Henri
etta Clauson, the young woman supposed
to have been murdered by Rev. Francis
The San Francisco Call.
] Hermann in the Scandinavian Methodist
Church of Salt Lake, lived in Omaha four
years prior to going to that city. A host
of her friends here have been anxiously
waitine for several months for letters from
her, and not until to-day was any intima
tion received that she had met a violent
death.
Thomas Erickson, a shoemaker, re
membered her well as an active workar in
the Danish-Norwegian Methodist church
at Twenty-sixth and Franklin streets thiÃ
city, and Miss Tillie Anderson, also living
here, was an intimate friend of the dead
girl, having known her both here and in
Salt Lake.
Miss Clauson, then 20 years of age, came
here from Denmark about nine years a:Â»o,
and, having no relatives in this country,
lived with a family named Johnson in the
western part of the city. The young
woman suffered ill-health, and at the so
licitation of Miss Anderson, who had gone
to Salt Lake, followed her there. Later
Miss Anderson returned, but Miss Clauson
remained.
A close friendship between Miss Clauson
and her Omaha friends was kept up by
correspondence for the past three years.
After Rev. Mr. Hermann and his wife
moved to Salt Lake her letters frequently
contained allusions to their aid and friend
ship to her.
During the latter part of last summer
the letters from Miss Clauson suddenly
ceased, without any explanation, although
several letters were cent to her. Then, as
! a last effort to reach her during last win
ter, Miss Anderson wrote another letter
j addressed in care of Rev. Francis Her
mann, because it was believed that it
would surely reach her friend. But no
reply came, and at every meeting
of the dead girl's friends at their
church in this city inquiries have been
| made about her. The last beaid was that
she was employed in the southern part
of Salt Lake, and nothing was known of
her keeping house for the Scandinavian
pastor.
LIKED IN WEST SUPERIOR.
Hermann Bore a Good Reputation in the
Wisconsin Tourn.
WEST SUPERIOR, Wis., May 24.â Rev.
Francis Hermann was for three years the
pastor of the First Norwegian Danish
Methodist Episcopal Church in this city.
His reputation here was good, and he was
a conspicuous figure in the Ministers' As
sociation. He was a leader in Scanai
navian social circles, and was well thought
of by all who knew him. He moved from
here to Salt Lake.
KILLED BY THE MAYOR.
Hot Springs' Executive Defends Himself
With a Pocket-
Knife.
HOT SPRINGS, Abk., May 24.â One of
the must sensational killings tb&t ever oc
curred in this city took place last night at
9 o'clock on Whittington avenue, opposite
the Catholic Church. The principals were
W. W. Waters, Mayor of Hot Springs, and
H. H. Martin, a drummer employed by
doctors.
Waters since taking the office of Mayor
has made a bold stand against the dis
repatable doctor-drumming element in
this city and has had many of the drum
mers arrested and heavily fined by the city
court. Martin, who was the recognized
king of these drummers, was arrested sev
eral days ago for drumming without wear
ing a badge and heavily fined by the Po
lice Judge.
Meeting Mayor Waters on the street last
evening Martin stopped him and endeav
ored to get him to remit the fine. This
the Mayor positively refused to do and
started toward his home. Martin followed
and kept abusing him and finally caught
him by the shoulder.
A scuffle ensued, during which the
Mayor drew a Knife from his pocket and
cut Martin in the neck, severing the jugu
lar vein. The latter died in ten minutes.
Mayor Waters immediately gave him
self up to the officers and is now under
arrest. Tom Mathias, a nephew of
Waters, endeavored to separate the com
batants and was severely cut in several
places.
SLAIN FOR HIS STAMPS.
The Murder of a loung French Collector
1-rplained.
PARIS, Frakce, May 24.â 1t is believed
the mystery attending the discovery near
Cherbourg of the body of a young
man in a trunk has been cleared. It
is reported that Joseph Aubert ana Mar
guerite Dubois, who were arrested at Cour
ville with the trunlt in their possession
nave confessed that they killed the young
man, whose name was Delahef, in order to
obtain a collection of postage stamps
which he owned. The collection was
worth $2000.

At one end oi the room was a sort of altar,
on which was a golden vessel filled with*
consecrated water. In the entry was a
golden cross, at either side of which were
lighted candles. The standard, hanging
from a staff, was held by a color-bearer,
who stood at the left of the altar.
The Bishops and priests of the Kremlin
cathedrals in gorgeous chasubles of gold
cloth attended by acolytes bearing censers
stood in front of the altar, while at the
right were the imperial male choir from
Bt. Petersburg attired in black and crim
son cloaks. Behind the priests, at a little
distance from them, were the Emperor
and all the mcraberj of the imperial
family, at present at Most*-" , with thtvr
respective suites and ladies of honor.
A 3hort religious service was held com
posed of prayers and responses and an
anthem by the choir. The standard was
sprinkled with holy water and formally
consecrated by the Metropolitan of Mos
cow.
At the end of the service, during the
singing of the famous choir, all of the
members of the imperial family tiled be
fore the altar and kissed the cross in the
hands of the priest who bore it, after
which the standard was taken from this
room into another apartment, to be care
fully guarded until the coronation on
Tuesday.
After the services the Emperor and Em

escorted by a squadron of cuirassiers.
They received along the entire route the
loyal acclamations of the people.
A grand review of all the regiments was

it was raining heavily it was decided to
abandon it. Later the rain ceased and the
sun shone brightly.
Large crowds of people continue to ar

HEW YORK STILL
LOYAL TO MORTON,

Delegation.
LAUGHS AT M'KINLEY'S CLAIMS
Empire State Republicans Regard the
Ohioan as a Dangerous
Candidate.
NEW YORK. N. V., May 24.âEx-Sena
tor Platt, while talking about the political
situation to-night, said:
"It is now plain that the McKinley man
agers propose to continue to the end their
plan of claiming everything and conced
ing nothing, without regard for facts, a
scheme they have persisted in for many
weeks. Their lieutenants here are deter
mined to aid them just as persistently for
ends and purposes essentially different â
ends and purposes with which Major Mc-
Kinley and his managers have no concern
whateverâ and without the slightest con
sideration for any one but themselves;
and this, too, without a thought for the
welfare of the business interests of the
Nation.
"The big men of the country, however,
may confidently rely upon It that their
views will be expressed at the St. Louis
Convention, both as to the maintenance of
the gold standard and as to the nomina
ion of a candidate who can appropriately

stand on a gold platform. New York will
present such a candidate, and the vote of
this State will be cast for him unani
mously.
"I observe that ex-Senator Miller, in an
interview, say? I have no commission to
speak for our delegation on that point. It
is a small matter whether I have or not.
The important thing is as to the fact, and
Mr. Miller will scarcely deny the fact.
"He, for instance, having been elected a
delegate at Governor's Morton's request,
had attended the conference at which it i
was resolved to place Governor Morton in
the field, having been the first man there
to advocate that action and the first man
to proclaim to the world by a formal in
teniew when the conference adjourned,
that he, of course, would be the- Gover
nor's stanchest supporter in the conven
tion. He says I must not speak for him,
but I can certainly recall his record in the j
matter and I can at least express enough \
confidence in his character as a man to j
say that he will keep faith with himself
and make good his promises.
"What is true of Mr. Miller in this re
spect is similarly true of the other dele
gates whether they represent districts or
the State at large. It should be plain to
the public that all this McKinley hulla
buloo in New York is simply so much j
empty sound. It will not affect the vote
at St. Louis of a single New York delegate.
It is a familiar noise. We hear it every
spring and fall. It proceeds from that i
same old crowd of 'antis' who have
been performing in this way these many j
years. And there is not an intelligent
nan who does not know that if the regu- :
lar organization to-day were advocating j
McKinley all these pe6ple would be de- J
nouncing McKinley and declaring him un- |
fit for public station. They don't care a
fig about McKinley; they simply make
use of his name and position to aid their j
conspiracy for the overthrow of the Re- i
publican organization.
"Meanwhile the Republican organiza- '
tion of New York, standing in the inter- !
est of the business community and a sound :
public sentiment throughout the country,
will loyally support the nomination of Gov
ernor Morton and the adoption of a plain, '
unequivocal, direct pledge to tue people
that the gold standard shall be maintained j
and our currency system reformed on i
that basis. It will oppose the nomina- j
tion of McKinley on the ground I
that he is a dangerous and misleading
candidate, whose vctes and speeches show
that he has no settled convictions on the
money question and whose managers have j
endeavored to secure support of one part !
of the country by declaring that he is in
favor of silver, producing in each of such
parts of the country those peculiar por
tions of his record as seemed to sustain
the impression they desired to create in
that particular location."

OHIO DEMOCRATS FOR SILVER.
Free Coinage Men Will Control the State
Convention.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 24.â 50 far but
Ex-United States Judge John S. Bugbee. the Victim of the Convention Riot at
Juneau.
[Provi a photograph.]
four Ohio Congressional districts have se
lected their delegates to the National Dem
ocratic Convention. In two of these the
free-silver Democrats have carried the day
and selected free-silver men as delegates.
The Twentieth District has chosen two
radical gold-standard men as delegates.
In this district the gold Democrats won in
tne primaries, but it is understood that
one silver and one gold delegate will be se
lected in the convention. In the county
conventions to choose State delegate?,
many of which have now been held, the
free-silver Democrats have generally held
majorities, and as the result it is almost a
foregone conclusion that the Democrats of
Ohio will in their State convention declare
for free silver.
It is reported here that Senator Brice,
who some time ago announced his inten
tion of coming into the State to make c
fight against the free-silver movement,
now sees the futility of it and will make
no opposition to it.

TWO FACTIONS COME TO BLOWS
Bitter Fight Over the Delegates to
St. Lou sâ Bugbae's San Fran
cisco Career.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., May 24.â
Probably nowhere in the United State 3
did the enthusiasm and intense rivalry at
tendant upon the election of delegates to
the St. Louis Convention assume such a
serious air, and with a fatal termination,
as it did in Alaska, a country hitherto free
from all political strife. As a result of a
riot in the Republican convention at
Juneau on May 14, ex-United States Judge
John S. Bugbee, well-known over the Paci
fic Coast, is dead. He was stricken by
apoplexy after a scuffle in the convention,
and just as he was about to be named as
a delegate to St. Louis. His death oc
curred on May 16, he being unconscious
from the time of the attack until the end
came.
Preceding the Republican convention at
Juneau bitter warfare was waged between
two factionsâ one known as the "squaw"
men and the other as the "aristocrats."
Trie latter included the better element,
and when the former saw that its cause
was a hopeless one it resorted to tactics by
which it hoped to win by force of num
bers.
When the conven tion was called to or
der by the regularly elected chairman,
John G. Heid, there was a rush, and the
opposition, headed by C. S. Blackett, a
well-known attorney, attempted to throw
the gentleman not only from his seat but
out of the window. Heid's friends rallied
around him and a fierce fist fight resulted,
followed by the drawing of many revolv
ers.
The Heid delegation was finally vic
torious, and the convention was continued.
In the interim, however, Bu?bee, in whose
interests the riot had occurred, took a
chair behind another desk and organized
an opposition convention.
In the scrimmage Judge Bugbee, who
was an old man not in the best of health.
had been rather roughly handled, and his
following was horritied to see him sud
denly pitch forward on his desk. A phy
sician was summoned and pronounced it a
case of apoplexy. Bugbee was taken from
the hall, and died two days later without
regaining consciousness.
Another chairman was selected, the
meeting continued and a delegation was
elected to contest at St. Louis the seats of
T. S. Snowell, the well-known mining
man; C. S. Johnson, ex-United States At
torney during President Harrison's term ;
T. R. Needham, editor oi the Searchlight,
and W. A. Kelly of Wrangelâ the regu
larly elected delegation.
Judge J. S. Bugbee, the victim of thÂ«
trouble, was probably one of the best
known men in Alaska, if not on the coast.
Prior to his advent into Alaska he was a
resident of San Francisco. His death ia
regretted by all.
A prominent feature of the great con
tention that had preceded the calling of
the convention was the political work of
one George Washington Delamater, known
in Pennsylvania political circles. He was
recently sent to the northern territory, it
is said, in the interests of the Presidential
candidacy of Senator Matt Quay.
John S. Bugbee was well known in San
Francisco, having lived here twenty-five
years. He was a graduate of a Boston
grammar school and studied law in that
city. He came to San Francisco in 1861 to
meet his father, who was then one of the
leading architects of California. The
senior Bugbee built the houses of Leland
Stanford and Charles Crocker.
Some years later the son, John S. Bu"
-bee, was married to an estimable young
ladyof Boston, a sister of Mrs. Sidney M.
Smith. The wedding ceremony was
performed by Dr. Horatio Stebbins. Mrs.
Bugbee went to Alaska with ncr husband
and on her return, about two years ago
delivered a lecture on Alaska at the First
Unitarian Church. She died at the FÂ»bi-2
Ola Hospital in Oakland a year ago. She
was a lady of fine literary attainments.
John S. Bugbee was a good lawyer. As
a pleader he had few superiors. He began
his law work in San Francisco as a man
aging clerk for John T. DoyJe, and was
subsequently admitted to partnership in
firm of Doyle, Barber. Scripture & Bug Lee.
His accurate mathematical knowledge and
his special ability as a pleader made him
a power in the Montgomery avenue. New
Montgomery street and Dupont street
widenine; cases.
In 1885 John Lord Love, then City and
County Attorney, appointed Mr. Bugbee
as a deputy in his office. Mr. Bugbee held
that position for two years.
During the recess in Congress in 1889
Mr. Bugbee was appointed United States
District Judge of Alaska, but the mission
aries made such war on him that the Sen
ate declined confirmation.
Subsequently President Harrison ap
pointed to the office Judge Warren Truitt
of Oregon, and that appointment was ac
ceptable to the Senate.
Two years ago Mr. Bugbee visited San
Francisco to receive the attentions of an
oculist. His vision was impaired and his
eyes were badly inflamed. His health in
this regard was soon restored and he re
turned to Alaska. Since then he was re
ported by dispatches from Alaska to have
organized a company to assist in the set
tlement of the boundary disnutes. He
was elected captain of the company.
Three sons of Mr. Bugbee reside in Cali
fornia. The eldest. Maxwell G., is an
architect in this City. The others are
Winslow and Arthur Bugbee. A daugh
ter, Bessie, is marriea and living in Ore
gon.
John S. Bugbee was 57 years of a*re am:
a native of Nova Scotia. He had in him
the elements which -ender a man popular
among his fellows. He was intellectual,
genial and warm-hearted.

SEATTLE, Wash., May 24.â The steam
ship Al-Ki, which arrived in port this
morning, less than four days out from
Juneau, brougnt the following advices:
The Republican Territorial election was
held at Juneau on May 14, resulting in
the election of Hon. S. C. Johnson and
Thomas Nowell of Juneau as delegates to
the National Republican Convention at
St. Louis. Mr. Johnson was formerly
United States Attorney for Alaska, and
Nowell is probably the most extensive
mine-owner and operator in the Territory,
possessing among other properties the
famous Berners Bay mines. Jud^eAVii

nates.
lhe delegation goes to St. Louis unin-
Btructed as to Presidential candidates, but
stands upon the appended platform, which
is silent upon the money question :
Whereas, The past year has demonstrated
more than ever before the need of representa
tion from Alaska in the Congress of the Cnited
States, and feeiing assured that when these
lacts become known that a speedy remedy will
be given; and, whereas, the isolated condition
of the Territory of Alaska and the great dis
tance from the seat of Government render it
impracticable for Congress to know the condi
tion of the Territory; therefore be it
Resolved. That the development of the conn
try, increase of population and investment ol
capital demand more legislation by Congress,
and we respectfully ask that Alaska be ac
corded a delegate in the Congress of the
V ni ted States to the end that our legislators
may be enabled to act intelligently upon such
legislation as may be needed by the territory.
It is probable that a contesting delega
tion, consisting of C. A. Yuung and C. S.
Blackett, who, according to the Mining
Record at Juneau, are "against McKinley
at all hazards and for Reed if possible"
will go to St. Louis. The Record claims
their selection was brought about by G.
W. Delamater, who a few years " ago
achieved fame and distinction as Senator
Quay's candidate for Governor of Pennsyl
vania.
The Democrats of Alaska have called a
Territorial Convention, to be held at Ju
neau on June 1, for the selection of six
delegates to the National Convention at
Chicago on July 7.
AWFUL TRIPLE MURDER.

Robbery the Apparent Motive â A
Young Man Suspected of the
Crime Is Missing.
AVA, Mo.. May 24.â The whole Sawyer
family, consisting of father, mother and
grown-up son, w* re four.d murdered in
their home, one mile east of this i;lace,
yesterday. Ernest E. Sawyer, the son,
had stab wounds in the throat and right
breast, had both jaws broken, and head
and face beaten to a jelly.
He had been murdered in the barn and
the body dragged to the house. The
skulls of both father and mother were
crushed in. Mrs. Sawyer's left arm was
broken, evidently in trying to ward off a
murderous blow. The three bodies were
piled together under a bed arid covered
with a blanket.
The object of the crime appears to have
been robbery. The Sawyers came here
from Linn County, lowa, last November.
A young man named Perry has been
arrested as the murderer.

Ge rraan Southwest Africa met with very
slight opposition. The action of the
House fitted admirably with popular feel
ing and has delighted the colonial jingoes,
who continue diligently to advance their
South African boom. The increase au
thorized by the resolution will give Major
Lentwein, the administrator of affairs in
German Southwest Africa, command of
1000 effective troops, which are regarded
as ample to suppress the rising of the
natives in that territory. The origin of
the outbreak among the natives has not
been officially explained, but the uniform
belief of the colonial party that the rising
was fomented by British intrigue was
given expression during the debate on the
credit resolution in the Reichstag last
Tuesday by a member of the Right, and
the German press in articles on the subject
denounce the English leader; who have
been supplying the natives in Soutii Af
rica with arms for years past.
It is not the prospect of crushing the ne
groes in Southwest Africa, however, that
elates the colonial party in Germany.
The Neueste Nachrichten, wbich is the
foremost of the colonial organs, makes no
concealment of the hopes of the colonials,
and reveals T>erhaps more of the aims of
the Government than are obvious upon
the surface. The paper, after remarking
that there is a community of interests be
tween the Transvaal and German South
west Africa despite the fact that the two
territories are separated by Bechuanaland,
adds that by means of the Jorce of 1000
men, which Major LÂ»utwein will have at
his command, Germany will acquire a po
sition in Southwest Africa, the influence
of which is already felt in Cape Town.
The general situation, the Neueste Nach
richten continues, has undergone a
change, and the Boers now indirectly re
ceive support of which time will plainly
display its effects.
The annual meeting of the German Colo
nial Society will be beid here on May 30,
when a resolution will be submitted prom
ising the support of the German Govern
ment in promoting the neutrality of the
Boer republics as essential to the further
ance of German interests. This expression,
however, will hardly have the effect of eat
isfying the more advanced of the Colonials,
who indorsed the demand of the Neuste
Nachrichten lor the establishment of an
offensive and defensive alliance between
Germany and the Transvaal.
The speech made by Joseph Chamber
lain. British Secretary of State for the Col
onies, upon the occasion of the South Afri
can annual dinner at tne Hotel Metropole
in London Thursday evening, in which he
sharply criticized the action of the Trans
vaal Government in its vindictive treat
ment of the Johannesburg Reform Com
mittee prisoners, is vehemently denounced
by the entire German press, the National
Zeitung expressing regret that President
Kruger should have shown so great a de
gree of magnanimity toward the prisoners.
A great international chess tournament
is to be held at Nuromburg, beginning on
July 20. The first prize will be $500, the
second $375 and the third $-'00, besides
which there will be lour smaller prizes.
AU of the best European chess masters
are expected to be present, and it is hoped
that leading American chess players will
also take part.
American purchasers of German manu
factures are devoting a great deal of atten
tion to the Industrial Exhibition, wnich is
now running smoothly. Several orders
have been lodged by Americans with one
of the largest German firms engaged in
the manufacture of machinery, aggregat
ing 100,000 mark 3. Exhibitors of dry
goods, however, complain of an utter lack
of American orders.
A great deal of interest is being taken in
the Hungarian millennial celebration at
Buda-Pest, to which place it is expected
that a large number of people will go from
Germany during the summer. Reports
received here say that there were more
than 200 Americana in Buda-Pest last
week, the majority of whom went from
there to Moscow to witness the coronation
of the Czar. Before going, however, they
ordered rooms reserved for them pending
their return.
Hon. John Wanamaker of Philadelphia
formerly Postmaster-General of the United'
States, during his recent visit here entered
into negotiations for the purchase of
Munkacsy's latest painting '"Ecce Homo,"
but with what result is not known.
The Khans, trotting-horse owners of
Hamburg, have purchased the American
trocters Bullet and Gloria, and the Beer
man Brothers of Charlottenburg have
bought Dr. Austin and Lucy W. The
horses will go into possession of their new
owners after the close of the West End
races, in which they are entered.
Dr. Inner, Governor of the Marshall
Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, takes occa
sion in a report recently received from him
by the Colonial Department of the Foreign
Office to deny the truth of the attacks re
cently made upon the American mission
aries stationed upon those islands. Dr.
Irraer pays a high tribute to tne maligned
missionaries who, be says, are peaceful
and quietly devoting themselves to Chris
tian work, holding themselves aloof from
all agitation.
A great deal of regret is felt in court cir
cles here at the death of Archduke Karl
Ludwig of Austria, brother of Emperor
Francis Joseph, who died in "Vienna a few
days ago. The Archduke was regarded
here as a thoroughly good, though oy no
means a brilliant, man, and was liked by
all who came in contact with him. It is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1896.
I stated that the illness which caused his
death was ascribed by his physicians to
his drinking of the waters of the river
Jordan, which he did as a matter of re
ligious devotion, upon the occasion of his
recent pilgrimage to Palestine. The water
of the Jordan is by no means pure, and in
the case of the Archduke it had a tendency
to bring on intestinal weakness which
could not be overcome.
An official announcement is made
through the columns of the North Ger
man Gazette explaining that the proposal
in the sugar tax bill empowering the
Bundesrath to reduce or annul the sugar
bounties as soon as other countries tase
the same action is associated with the re
sumption of negotiations with France and
Austria pointing to an agreement to the
gradual abolition of bounties.
France, which has hithereto been the
chief obstacle in the way of trie reduction
or the abolishment of sugar bounties, is
now understood to be willing to assent to
the question of a simultaneous reduction
in an international conference.
The Weser Zeitung of Bremen contends
that the sugar tax bill is not a fighting
measure against bounties, such as the Gov
ernment desired, and that the Bundesrath,
therefore, may allow the measure to die.
A contrary opinion is held in official
circles, where it is contended that the bill
will enable the Government to carry out
its matured designs for an international
abolition of bounties at an early date.
Tlie Whitsuntide holidays began with
perfect weather. The sun shone brightly
throughout the day, and the churches
were filled with worshipers.
The Emperor returned to Potsdam last
evening and the whole imperial family
were assembled, the elder of the young
Princes.Crown Prince William and Prince
Eitel Frederick, having come from Ploen,
where they are at scnool, to join the fam
ily circle.
Excursion trains, crowded| to their ut
most capacity, brought thousands of per
sons to the capital to-day.
The National Zeitung, in an article com
menting upon the coronation fetes at
Moscow, says it is not without anxiety
that England can look toward the imme
diate future. After the fetes are over, the
paper says, the Egyptian question, which j
has been tied up for Russia until the Czar |
is crowned, will become acute umier
Franco-Russian pressure.
TO VOTE FOR A BISHOP,
The Next Business of Importance
Beiore the M. E. Con
ference.
Colored Delegates Will Make a Fight
for the Selection of One of
Their Race.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, May 24.âT0-mor
row morning the Methodist conference
will proceed to ballot for a successor to
Bishop Taylor of Africa. The vote will be
taken at half-past 9 o'clock.
It is on this election that the color line
will be most sharply drawn, as the colored
delegates are determined to do ail in their
power to elect one of their number to the
position, preferaby Dr. W. J. E. Bowen,
president of the Gammon Theological In
stitute at Atlanta.
Another colored man who is being con
sidered for the place is Dr. H. A. Munroe,
who heads the delegation from the Dela
ware conference. His friends urge that
he has the necessary experience, having
been a member of the board of managers
of the missionary society for years and
that he has sufficient age to warrant his
selection.
About the only white candidate is Rev.
Dr. Harizeii of Louisiana, who has been
for some years secretary of the Freedraen's
Aid and Southern Education Society. Dr.
A. B. Leonard has been spoken of, but it
is not thought that he would accept the
place.
When this matter is out of the way
there remains one matter of grave im
portance to be disposed of. Dr. Buckley
will inaugurate and lead a fight to make
the college of bishops co-ordinate in power
in India with Bishop Thoburn. The bel
ligerent littie "Methodist Pope" seems to
"have it in" for the missionary Bishops,
and lie will try to hold the whip over the
Bishop of India as he does over the college
bishops at home. It was due to him that
the conference decided to ignore Bishop
Thoburn's request for another Bishop for
India.and it was due to him that a Bishop
was refused for the South American field.

ment authorities here of an alleged ship
ment of rifles, pistols and ammunition
from the United States to an American
named Morris at Elijos, a small town
below here. It is said Morris delivered
the guns and ammunition to the- Yaqui
Indians, and the latter are preparing for a
more vigorous warfare against the Mexi
can settlers than ever.
A band of about 100 Yaquis attacked the

FREAKS OF AN HEIRESS,
The Runaway Girl From Ston
ington, Conn., Is Found
in Montreal.
Had Worked in a Boarding-House as
a Servantâ Her Dread of an
Insane Asylum.
MONTREAL, Quebec, May 24.â Maud
C. Williams, the millionaire heiress,
whose mysterious disappearance from
Stonington, Conn., caused so much
anxiety to her friends, has been located
here and will be taken back to her home.
Last night a girl answering Maud Wil
liams' description came up from Quebec
by train. Train-ufcuatcher Dunn of the
Canadian I'acilic Railway noticed her and
h uving read a description of the mi=sin?
woman in the papers came to the conclu
sion she was the person referred to. She
had in her possession a card giving the
address of the place in Montreal to which
she desired to go and Dunn noticed it.
Later a lady put in an appearance, prov
ing to be Mrs. Montgomery of tue Shelter
ing Home, and took her away. Mr. Wil
liams, brother of the missing girl, who ar
rived here a few days as;o in search of His
sister, on being luformed that she was
found, drove to the home. The fcirl made
frantic efforts to escape when she saw the
cab driving up and cried: "For God's
sake do not let them in, or they will put
me in an insane asylum for life.' :
She then made an effort to escape
through the window, but was prevented
by the matron. She finally consented to
see her brother and the meeting was an
affecting one. She afterward consented to
return home. In giving her own story she
said she came to Montreal, giving her
name as Jessie Barclay. Saiu she:
"My object was to obtain a situation and
earn sufficient money 10 go elsewhere. I
nrst obtained employment in a boardinf
house as a general servant. After a week
1 earned enough to go to Quebec, when
my money became exhausted and I fell
ill. I fortunately fell into tne hands of
some Christian ladies, who took care of
me, to whom 1 cave the name of Jessie
White."
Mr. Williams was very much affected by
the appearance of his sister, who he
claims is only a shadow of her lormer self.

COURSING AT TOO PARKS
Lady Clifton Won the Sapling
Stake at Ocean View
Yesterday.
Magnet Took First Prize at Ingleside,
Fireczi Bsing the Run
ner Up.
Fair crowds attended both of the cours
ing parks yesterday, the tine weather
bringing out many veteran followers of
the leash who failed to attend during the
cold and rainy Sundays of the winter.
At Ocean View Park a sapling 6take
divided interest with the ola-dog stake,
and on this particular event the betting
was particularly heavy. Thirteen high
class pups were entered, each owner hop
ing to gain the silver cup that went with
the first cash prize.
The honor of having her name inscribed
on the trophy went to M. O'Connor's Lady
Clifton, a smart and fast black bitch, by
Lord Clifton-Rockette who displayed
great speed and worked close enough to
satisfy the most fastidious. Lord Clifton
is the blueblooded Eastern dotr imporied
by Martin Kerrigan about a year ago, and
Rockette is a sister of West Side, whose
performances have been very creditable.
Lady Clifton is one of the first of Clif
ton's progeny old enough to start, and her
performance augurs well for the stock.
Th* runner-up, Nellie Gray, is a remark
ably fast and true worker, but lacKs devel
opment and therefore staying qualities,
and will probably be beard from later on.
The hares ran well, and with few excep
tions the decisions of Judge Canavan and
the leash work of Slipper Cranston gave
general satisfaction.

On Sunday next a stake at $1 entrance, to

be run. The drawing will take place at
Pythian Caslle, 909 Market street, on Thurs
day evening. As the Interstate Club will
hold a meeting at Injrleside on Saturday
and Sunday, in which only members'
clogs will be permitted to enter, a large
stake is looked for at Ocean View. It has
not yet been decided whether or not cours
ing will be held on Saturdayâ Decoration
dayâ but announcement will be given in
Saturday's Call.
The tunning at Ingleside yesterday re
sulted in a winning for Joe Trade's speedy
Magnet, who carried off the first prize
with ease. Laurel Leaf was expected to run
into the money, but was lost (last week
and only recovered on Saturday through

William Mau Jumps Into the Sea to
Escape From His Brutal
Tormentor.
PORT TOWisSEND, Wash., May 24â
Mate William Smith of the American ship
Benjamin Sewell was la^t ni-ht bound
over by Commissioner Swan to the United
States District Court in the sum of $2300
bail, in default of which Smith is confined
in the County Jail here. The charge
against Mate bniith is cruelty to a sailor,
who jumped overboard and was drowned
as a result of Smith's abuse and inhuman
treatment of him.
The story told by seven sailors who
testified against Mate Smith was to the
effect that on January 6 last, at 4 o'clock
in the morning, on a voyage from Port
Townsend to Shanghai, the mate went on
deck to stand his watch and found Wil
liam Mau, a German sailor on watch,
wearing a coat. With an oath, Smith
ordered Mau to take off the coat, telling
him that no one but the mate was allowed
to wear a coat on that ship. Mau obeyed
the order, but was not quick enough in
his movements to suit Smith, who seized
a belaying-pin and struck Mau over the
head with it three or four times, then

knocked him down with a capstan-bar and
struck him with his fists, bruising Mau'a
eyes.
The morning was bitter cold, and Smith
suddenly took a notion to warm Mau. He
ordered another sailor to bring on all the
clothes he could find, and made Mau pot
them on, finally having a big sheet of can
vas wrapped around the fellow. Then he
ordered Mau to get up and dance and sing
on deck, telling him he did not want him
to freeze. Mau obeyed as best he could,
and a few minutes later, when Mate Smith
went below after breathing more threats
against Mau, the latter quickly stepped to
the side of the ship and jumped over
board, never being seen afterward.
Captain Sewell and Mate Smith of the
Sewell are also under arrest on a charge of
extreme cruelty toward a sailor named
Francis while on the last voyage from
Shanghai to Port Townsend. The hear
ing in this case will be held on Tuesday.
The ship Benjamin Â£. Sewell has a bad
reputation among sailors, being classed as
one of the hottest vessels in the deep-water
trade. She generally has much trouble in
shipping a crew, and her officers are sin
gled out for special attack in the "red rec
ord." Mate Smith regarded the matter
very lightly when arrested yesterday, and
when asked by Commissioner Swan last
evening if he had read the complaint, he
waved his hand and jokingly said he did
not consider it worth reading. Captain
Sewell listened to the reading of the com
plaint against him and said with a smile:
"Well, now, that's pretty serious, isn't
it?"
Both of them were more serious at mid
night, when Smith was bound over by the
Commissioner.
THE ENNENAUA STEANDED.
A. Mishap That Interrupted Weyler's In
spection Trip.
MADRID, Spain, May 24.â A dispatch
to the Imparcial from Havana says that
the cruiser Ensenada, which left Havana
Friday with Captain-General Weyler and
his staff on board, their intention being to
make a brief inspection of the troops and
defenses on the northwest coast, stranded
in the afternoon at Cabanas, a short dis
tance to the westward of Havana. Tugs
were sent to her assistance. General Wey
ler and his staff were transferred to an
other vessel. The damage to the cruiser
is not serious.
Prime Minister Conovas del Castillo has
announced that the United States had not
formally protested against the decree of
General Weyler forbidding the export of
tobacco from Cuba, but had inquired as to
Spain's intentions regarding existing con
tracts. These contracts, the Prime Min
ister adds, will be respected.BENICIA'S AGED

BENICIA, Cal., May 24.â J. H. D.
Wingneld, Bishop of the Northern diocese
of California for the Episcopal church,
Buffered a stroke of paralysis last night
and is in a precarious condition. Dr.
Williamson, the Bishop's physician, re
ports that his patient is in great danger,
but hopes that the iron constitution of
the ecciesiast will be able to combat his
malady.
All day long the Invalid has hovered be
tween life and death. To-night Dr. Wil

ment. He said there was no change in
the patient's condition for either better
or worse. His entire left side was par
alyzed, bat partial consciousness had re
turned and no complications had as yet
developed. He reported that the Bishop
had for some time been threatened with
paralysis, and consequently the attack
was not unexpected. Dr. Williamson
bases his slight hope of saving the Bishop's
Jife on the care the invalid has taken of
himself for the last few years.
Special services were held in the Episco
pal church and a general regret is ex
pressed in the community by all classes
because of Bishop Wingfield's illness.
WAR ON THE COLUMBIA,
Non-Union Fishermen Attacked
and Roughly Handled Near
Oak Point.
More Than One Man Found to Have
Been Killed in the Recent
Battle.
ASTORIA, Ob., May 24.â The non-union
men engaged in fishing near Oak Point
were set upon by a number of members of
the Columbia River Fishermen's Protective
Union to day and severely handled, their
boats being wrecked and turned adrift,
their nets cut and the men themselves left
on a rocky point jutting out into the river
from which they could not escape unless
assisted by parties passing down the river.
Just as darkness set in about 200 union
men congregated near Eureka, with the
evident intention of committing some act
of hostility, either toward the canners in
that vicinity or toward non-union men.
It is known that the steamer Alarm,
used as a cannery tender for the Cook
Packing Company, is near Oak Point with
twenty tons of salmon on board, and it is
thought the fish may be seized and de
stroyed.
From hints dropped by the fishermen it
is now absolutely certain that Searcy was
not the only fisherman killed in the recent
melee a few miles above this city. It is
believed that at least one of the attacking
party was killed and several wounded.
Searcy's partner, Jewell, who escaped
with slight injuries, states that when he
fired his shotgun more than one man
dropped, and that Searcy was that in the
forehead as he was reloading his eun.
Searcy and Jewell had no weapons, save
shotguns loaded with buckshot, while the
attacking party was armed with rifles.
It is thought that the end is not yet, and
that unlehS a compromise i.s quickiy ef
fected between the canners and fisfiermen
encounters of a more serious nature are
unavoidable.
The officers of the union express deep
regret that bloodshed should result from
the strike, but declare they are unable to
prevent individual members from commit
ting lawless acts.
TRAGEDY AT RUGENE.
Farmer Cottle Kndt Hit Life With a
Rifle Hull ft.
EUGENE, Oh., May 24.â People on the
etreets here were startled last night by the
report that C. H. Cottle had shot himself.
Cottle lived on a small farm about two
miles northwest of Eugene.
He had been in town after his daughter,
and returned home a little after 7 o'clock.
After being home for a half hour, the
daughter and Mrs. Cottle heard the report
of a <run in a workshop back of the housf.
Going to investigate, the daughter found
her father prostnite upon the floor. She
alarmed the neighbors and several men
responded, but they came too late.
Cottle had deliberately taken his own
life, using a 32-caliber rifle, which he still
held in his hands. He had lain down
upon the floor, with his bead on some
Racks, and holding the muzzle of the rifle
with his leit hand against his forehead
over the right eye pulled the trigger with
the right hand.
The bullet crashed through his head.
The only cause for the act, as far as can be
learned, was melancholy and despondency.
He was a severe sufferer from
iliness at times. He had no do
mestic troubles, living happily with his
wife and daughter: neither had he any
business troubles. He was a member in
good standing of the Odd Fellows and A.
O. U. W. lodge of this city. He was a
brother of H. W. Cottle of the State In
surance Company of Salem.
SUICIDE YEAR ALMA.
Charlet Bernard Bndt Earthly Care by
Cutting Hit Throat.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 24.â Charles Ber
nard, a woodchopper, was to-day fourd
dead in his cabin on the top'of the Santa
Cruz range, a few miles above Alma. The
finders did not make an investigation,
but from appearances it was judged that
Bernard cut hia threat. A Coroner's in
quest will be held to-morrow.
Bernard was about 40 years of age. He
recently served on juries at several in
quests upon suicides in that neighborhood,
and at the last inquest, held only three
weeks airo, declared that he would never
commit suicide. No cause for the act is
known.
SANTA CLARA VALLEY FRUIT,
Campbell Growers Ship a Carload to the
Belgian Market.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 24.â There is no
demand for dried fruit, and the market re
mains unchanged. There are about
twenty carloads of dried fruit in the vari
ous exchange warehouses, and this will all
be in the channels of trade before the
new crop comes in.
The indications are that there will be
an average crop of prunes, with apricots
light in some places, and peaches light.
The recent rains did some damage to
ripening cherries, causing them to become
soft and rot. The cherry crop is light, but
very good prices are quoted.
Offers of 6 and 7 cents per pound have
been make for Royal Anne cherries.
During the past week the Campbell
Fruit-growers' Union shipped a carload of
dried prunes to Brussels, Belgium.
Memorial Day Service*.
BAN JOSE, Cal., May 24.â The citizens'

LATE ARRIVALS AT THE COLLEGE MEN'S CAMP AT CAZADERO.
[Sketched by a" Call " artitL]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1896.
OR. STEBBINS TO
STANFORD SENIORS,
An Eloquent Baccalaureate
Address by the Noted
Speaker.
LOVE FOR THE CREATOR.
He Urges Faith in the Deity
Though Affliction Mingles
With Life's Joys.
RELIGION A BALM FOR EVILB.
No Human Mind Can Comprehend the
Bitterness of the Despondent's
Existence.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
â4. â The Stanford University Chapel was
jammed to-day with an audience anxious
to hear the baccalaureate address of Rev.
Horatio Steobins. A large number of visi
tors were present. About the pulpit were
set vases and baskets of flowers, while the
platform and railing were festooned with
green.
Dr. Stebbins' discourse was delivered in
that characteristic vein and manner which
has given him a wide reputation for elo
quence. He began with the quotation,
"Because he has set his love upon me,
therefore I will deliver him. I will set
him on high because he has known my
power. He shall call upon me and 1 will
answer him. I will be with him in trou
ble. I will deliver him and honor him.
With long life will I satisfy him and bliow
him my salvation.
Speaking from this text, Dr. Stebbins
continued: *'To the intellect alone re
ligion makes an evil, Â«yen conceited as
sumption, yet it proves roan's greatest re
ward ; it alleviates bis afflictions and paci
fies the disturbances of his bein>;. Yet
this it does without a word of apology. It
offers no proofs, and contends there can
exiÂ»t no proof, unless it be the consent of
the heart within the temple inclosing it.
The reason for this is the child's reason,
'It is so because it is so.' The inquiring
mind holds such logic no logic; it violates
and follows that precept: 'Trust and lire.'
But the wisdom of life is in finding out
that the child's answer is the best and pro
foundest one.
"Safety from evil, safety from the storm
and dangerâ the feeling of safety in Godâ
is religion. We need no proof of this.
Evil is a fact; we know how much trouble
there is in this world, that joys and pains
counterbalance one another. No pity
moves the restless sea for those who sleep
forever in its caverns. There is no pity in
the deadly plague and famine, as they
spread from city to city, and from one con
tinent to another. We look on them,
however, as something with which we
shall never be brought into close contact.
No human experience, no human heart,
can understand the bitterness, sorrow and
distress of the desDondent's life."
Continuing, the speater said that life
was not all dark and melancholy and that
he had no desire to be pessimistic. There
were beauties in the world which all saw
and which all enjoyedâ handiworks of
God, smon^ which we were placed and
which we could not understand, for they
were beyond human reasoning.
"The man who had solved the problem
of evil, as we call it, and reconciled it with
the goodness of God can boast that he un
derstands the Almighty to peifection,"
said he, "but such boasting is a snare or
hypocrisy.
"Daily sorrows and joys of life are pro
found facts. Reason does not and cannot
explain moral discipline. We may wonder
why God did not create us le.Â«s subject to
ills and pains; but this is a sin against the
creator, for it is a substitution of human
methods for the divine. We are charging
providence with the making of mis
takes."
The substance of the doctor's conclusion
wai to accept the goodness about us and
not to condemn what we could not under
stand, for notwithstanding the many years
which we might spend in study and re
search â even though one's life were ae
voted to it â there were myriads of phe
nomena which must be accepted on faith.
Religion, the strongest staff of mankind,
had much within it that was unknowable,
yet this should not make the student a
skeptic. Religion was the most precious
thing to which we could cling, and to the
student its value was infinite.
SUICIDE ON STANFORD CAMPUS.
John Morley, a Young Spaniard, Xndt
Hit Life With Morphine.
PALO ALTO, Cal., May 24.â The body
of a man was found on the university
campus by three children this afternoon.
It is believed to be that of John Morley, a
young Spaniard, a stranger in this section.
An examination disclosed that he had
probably committed suicide by poisoning
himself with morphine. He was cvi
dently a pharmacist, as a recommendation
in his pocket would so indicate. No cause
for his act was known. The body was
found soon after life became extinct.

AT CAZADERO'S
COLLEGE CAMP,
Christian Students Meet in
the Shade of a Spread
ing Oak.
LIFE WORK DISCUSSED.
Leaders in Y. M. C. A. Cam
paigning Explain Methods
to Delegates.
TO LABOR AMONG FRESHMEN.
Special Mission of the Undergraduates
Who Are Present at the
Conference.
CAZADERO, Cal., May 24.â As the sun
sank toward the irregular horizon of many
steep tree-covered hills and long shadows
crept down into the narrow amphitheater
where nestles the little hotel and cottages
the last rays fell upon a rmarkable scene.
Seated and reclining on the grass under a
great spreading oak on a conspicuous hill
side, grouped like some aboriginal council
of braves, were representatives of twenty
American colleges seriously discussing
what they would attempt as their life
work.
G. S. Eddy, Yale '91, was their leader,
for thi se sunset talks lasting an hour are
regular features of the great College Young
Men's Chri-tian Association conference
at Northfield, Mass., where Mr. Eddy has
had several years' experience in the same
class of work.
In other respects the second day of this
conference has been uneventful, for astrict
observance of Sunday has permitted of lit
tle beyond the regular session; but they
have been given the same long hours of
earnest attention by all the delegates.
Mr. Eddy began the morning session,
which was punctuated with frequent
prayers and songs, by a discourse on the
effectiveness of prayer. He cited many
most remarkable instances of wonderful
revivals in foreign missions, following
almost immediately upon concerted
prayers for them in this country.
S. M. Sayford was the principal speaker
and illustrated his ideas with numerous
scriptural quotations. In speaking of
prayer and its scope he named three es
sentials of prayer: (1) Spiritual concep
tion of God's character, obtained from the
word of God, teaching first of his person
ality ; second of the personality of the
Holy Spirit; third of the divinity or
deity of Jesus Christ; (2) realization of
God's presence; (3) earnest endeavor
after holiness in daily life. Prayer itself,
he explained, had the authority of the
scriptures, the command of God and the
example of Christ. In order to make his
prayers acceptable to God a man must be
clean, must have faith in God and must
render prayer in a forgiving spirit.
Hugh Beaver of Pennsylvania State Col
lege began the regular instruction in bible
study during the morning, taking as his
subject "Christ as the Man of Prayer."
His purpose is in similar daily talks to
prepare the men here to teach the bible in
the Young Men's Christian Association of
their respective colleges.
The Rev. Dr. Dille of San Francisco is to
address the conference on Tuesday. On
Wednesday the Rev. Alexander Patterson
of Chicago will speak and on Thursday
the Rev. Dr. Coyle of Oakland. Others
will follow.
The immediate result of the work of the
conference will be to exert a Christian in
fluence over the 1500 or 2000 freshmen who
wiil enter the colleges of the Pacific Coast
next fall. The permanent results may be
imagined. How wide-reaching this influ
ence may be can be inferred from the fol
lowing table of institutions to which these
worKers will return when the next term
opens:

MRS. NELSON'S DEATH.
Hosts of Frienda Mourn the Loss of the
"Mother of the Old People*
Home."
The news of the death of ivf rs. Charles
Nelson, "mother" of the Old People's
Home, has caused much sorrow among
her multitude of friends in this City ana
throughout the State.
Mrs. Nelson passed away at her home in
Seminary Park, Alameda, Saturday morn
ing. She has suffered for a number of
years from diabetes; this, with an attack
of the grip, resulted in her death.
Her life work has been the building up
of the home and looking after the comfort
of the au r ea people who took refuse therp.
She was a native of Denmark and was 66
years of age. She came to California in
ISSI. She was then Miss Metha Clausen.
A few years after her arrival here s!ie mar
ried the well-known vessel-owner and
lumber merchant, Captain Charles Nelson.
After tier marriage the captain and his
wife lived on Rincon Hill. Three chil
dren were born to them, of whom only
their daughter, Mrs. C. C. McMahan, re
mains.
In 1874. while an active member of the
Howard Presbyterian Church. Mrs. Nelson
began the work which has made her name
famous in San Francisco. At this time
she organized, together with Mrs. S. B.
Peterson, her sister, and some other
ladies, the Scandinavian Ladies' Benevo
lent and Relief Society.
In 1879 she succeeded in getting from the
State a charter for thÂ« Old People's Home.
This was in reality but a continuation of
the good work don* by the original soci
ety. She was also successful in persuad
ing the municipality to sell some shanties
on Francisco street and leave the site to
the society for a number of years. She laid
the proposition before the Mayor and
Board of Supervisors, encountering much
opposition, but finally with the help of
friends the desired sale and lease were ac
corded.
The home occupied its quarters on Fran
cisco street for about fifteen years. The
original building became too smaJJ for the
growing needs of the institution, and at
this time Mrs. Charles Crocker offered
financial assistance, saying to Mrs. Nel
son: "You furnisli the Drains and I will
furnish the money."
A lot at the corner of Pine and Pierce
streets was accordingly purchased, and by
the aid of Mrs. Crocker's generosity the
present magnificent structure was erected.
Mrs. Nelson, however, did the planning
ami arranging and watched each step in
the progress of tne building.
A year ago Mis. Nelson resigned as pres
ident, but until that time she never aU
lowed a week to pass without visiting the
home and cheering its inmates. Her last
visit was on Good Friday night. After
this she went to the southern part of the
State and after her return was never able
to leave her residence in Alameda.
A RELIGIOUS WAR.
"General" Peter Duggan of the Arm;
of Jeaua Attacks the Salvation '
Army.
"General" Peter Duggan of tne red
capped Army of Jesus held a spirited
meeting in his headquarters at 631 Mer
chant street last night.
The "general" is an ex-Salvation Army
warrior, and while subscribing to the
golden rule given by the chief of that
body he posaesses little love lor his old
comrades.
"The Salvation Army," said he in his
sermon last evening, "is a money-making
scheme first, last and all the time. Old
General Booth started in a poor man and
now he is a millionaire.
"General" Duggan has a standing army
of about twelve persons and a strongly
made base drum. All of his men, includ
ing the drum, are recruits from the Salva
tion Army. A part of the meet ing- place
is fitted up with bunks, where houseless
men are lodged as well as fed when the
larder will permit of such outlay. In his
method of conducting services, the "gen
eral" uses the swing, gesture and motion
of the army in which he trained and
which he admires so lntle.J
MRS. E. WALLACE DEAD.
The Widow of 'William H. Wallace
Passe* Avray SutliTenly.
Mrs. Emeline Wallace died at her resi
dence, 2220 Broadway, this City, yesterday
morning. The illness was brief. The pa
tient succumbed to an attack affecting the
bowels, which aid not threaten fatally
until a few minuteu before death ensued.
Mrs. Wallace was the widow of William
H. Wallace of the old-time firm of Sisson,
Wallace & Co. At ttie time of the con
struction of the Central Pacific Railroad
this firm had cash credits and resources to
a large extent and advanced considerable
sums for the building of the railroad. Ex
tensive payments were made in San
Joaquin Valley lands, which were owned
by Mrs. Wallace at the time of her death.
Wallace died fourteen years ago. Two

OREGON CITY ,A
FACTORY CENTER,
Steady Growth of the First
American Settlement
on the Coast.
HAS VARIED RESOURCES.
The Wheels of Its Industries
Are Turned by a Mighty
Cataract.
IN A PICTURESQUE LOCATION.
Nestles on a Plateau Between the
Coast Range and Cascade
Mountains.
OREGON CITY, Or., May 21.â Here,
at the lower edge of the Willamette Valley,
is one of the most interesting places on the j
Pacific Coast. The traveler from Califor- I
nia has passed the whole length of the
rich valley between the Coast Range and J
the Cascade Mountains. The long lines of j
hills rapidly approach each other at the
foot of the valley until a rim of rock is
reached connecting the two mountain j
chains. Over this rim pours the entire
volume of the Willamette River, forming
a cataract of picturesque beauty, and a j
water power of great commercial value.
Here is located the town of Oregon City,
the oldest permanent American settlement
on the Pacific slope; where the first
Protestant church on the Pacific coast of
either of the Americas still stands; where
the first newspaper wa9 published, the
first mint established, the first jail erected
and the first popular government organ
ized on the western edge of the United
States.
When San Francisco was platted in 1549
the nearest place where the plat could be
riled to give legal effect to it was in the
United States court at Oregon City, and
the original document is now among the
Clackauias County records there.
Strangers visiting Oregon City are likely
to think the whole town is crowded be
tween the bluff and the river. But back
on the bluff is a large tract with a gentle
ft*PER AND PUUF> mills AND electric power STATION A
I OÂ«Â«<K>N CITY WOOLEN M.LLi AND fWUft.NCMJUi I
itlope toward the Willamette which ia cov
ered with residences, and many business
houses are also located there. The eastern
part of town iB eomewhat broken. In the
southern part is another elevation, reach
ing an altitude of about 350 feet from the
river, which is a sightly locality for resi
dences. A view of the river and an inter
esting stretch of country, even to Portland
and beyond, is spread out before the gaze
of the observer from that point. On the
west side of the river the elevation is even
greater than the east side, though it is not
marked by precipitous cliffs except on the
immediate bank of the stream. The out
look from that locality is upon nearly the
entire city and the mountain scenery that
is bo beautifully accentuated in the tower
ing peaks of the Cascade Range. A sus
pension bridge 1000 feet long spans the
river at a height of nearly a hundred feet
above the water.
The picturesque beauty of the locality is
one of the greatest attractions at Oregon
City. The falls are not simply a series of
rapids, but the whole mighty volume of
the Willamette River plunges down a pre
cipitous cliff of solid basalt, forming a
cataract that is truly magnificent in its
beauty and power. Below the falls the
river flows between vertical walls of solid
rock twenty to fifty feet tall, in which that
peculiar columnar form which basaltic
rock sometimes takes is seen. The two
elevated shelves on the east and south and
the rising ground on the west quite change
the common aspect of cities, and give from
every part of the city command of an out
look of charming beauty and grandeur.
The banks of the river, both above and
below Oregon City, still carry to a consid
erable extent their native forests, though
between the city and Portland, which is
twelve miles below, there is less timber
and more farms and orchards than in the
other direction.
Each day the sun rises out of the jaerged
profile of the Cascade Mountains and Bets
behind the lower crest of the Coast range.
The hoary peaks of the Cascades are
plainly visible from Oregon City and are
objects of never failing interest. Mount
Hood thrusts its perpetual ice fields into
the sky fifty miles due east of the city. It
is a perilous climb to the summit, but
every year numbers of tourists pass the
still smoking crater of the grim giant and
reach its peak, nearly 13,000 feet above toe
sea level. To the northward the snowy
dome of St. Helens and to the east of that
Mount Adams' rugeed peaks come boldly
into view. Then in the southeast Mount
Jefferson and the Three Sisters rise high
above the crest of the range and punctuate
the landscape. All these peats are per
petually ice-clad. In the latter part of the
summer the snow disappears, leaving vast
areas of claciers exposed, and the moun
tains lose much of their dazzling white
ness and grow more seamed and rugged in
appearance. There are few places in the
world where such wealth of scenic beauty
is presented. There is harmony and
majesty in it and it never grows old.
Orecon City is essentially a manufac
turing town. It was the chief city of Ore
gon for a number of years in pioneer
times, b"ut in the undeveloped condition
of the country's resources there was small
appreciation of the gigantic rower wasting
over the falls bsyond its ability to grind
wheat for bread for a few hundred people,
and trade was transferred to points
nearer the ocean, where ships could be
laden for the gold fields of California, that
people were then going wild over. Now
that the country is reaching a stage of de
velopment requiring manufactures and
manufacturing facilities, another era of
supremacy lies before the city.
About $50,000 is paid out monthly in
wages in Oregon City. This money goes
|to employes of the electric company ; of
j the woolen mill, the annual output of
! which exceeds $750,000; of the flouring
mills, having a capacity of 1100 barrels a
day, and sending their product to Liver
pool and China; of the paper and pulp
mills, turning out an annual product of
about 30,000 tons, one of the mills being
the largest on the Pacific Coast; of an ex
celsior and shoddy mill, two sawmills, Ja
sash and door factory, a machine-shop, a
soap-factory, a cement-mill, a wooden
pumD factory, an ice-factory, and a num
ber of smaller manufacturing and repair
shops. The value of the annual product
of these manufacturing plants is aDout
! $3,000,000.
Another important industry is that of
1 furnishing electricity for light and power.
The city of Portland is lighted from the
falls of the Willamette and many of her
Btreet cars and factories are run by power
from the same source. The company con
trolling the water power owns 1200 acres
of land opposite Oregon City, so there is
no fear that it will not labor for local in
terest.
A town of 5000 inhabitants, the seat of
justice of a county larger in extent than
the State of Rhode Island ana richer in
natural resources, with street railway con
nection with Portland and steam railway
and boats to furnish unsurpassed trans
portation facilities to all the world, and all
the agencies of progressive civilization in
active operation here, it is not strange that
erowth and prosperity continue in the
face <f conditions that retard business
generally. The permanence of this pros
perity is due largely to the magnificent
water-power that, notwithstanding the
10,000 horsepower now in use, is but be
gin ning to be developed.
A comparative statement of the capaci
ties of various well-known water-powers
will afford some idea of the relative im
portance of the power at the falls of the
Willamette. Here is a statement compiled
from official and other reliable data:
Beat of water-power. Horsepower capacity.

The progress of this town, which unites
so much that is historically and industri
ally interesting, has an important bearing
on the prosperity of the whole State of
Oregon. It is worthy of the attention of
tourists seeking pleasure and entertain
ment, and of those having a more substan
tial object in view.

It was not until several members of the

of successful experiments with the nitro
that the rank and file o! the marksmen
dared to use it, but now many are makine

A prominent marksman In the East re
marked recently: "One ol the great draw

the dirt, noise and smoke, and I dislike to
wind up a day's sport with my rifles and

H. R. Crane, an Enthusiastic Marksman and a Member of the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club.
The new nitro is doing away with these ;
objections, for in its use there is but little ;
noise, no smoke and no recoil â that bogie
man of timid riflemen. Many labor under
the idea that firearms in which nitro is ;
used require but little care. This is a seri- I
ous mistake, for without the liberal use of j
cleaning rags and oil after firing the best j
of barrels will runt and become leaded as j
quickly as with the black powder. To in
â on safety lrom this the firearm should be
cleaned immediately after using, and
again a day or two later.
Among the first local riflemen to try
nitro in the heavy musket was Chris Meyer
of Company C. Yesterday he achieved ex
cellent results with forty-live grains (meas
ured) shot under two wads and a 405-gram
metal-jacket bullet. The bullet was really
lead nickel plated. The wads were used to
fill the space. Meyer seated his bullets
firmly in the shells, iustead of leaving an
air space, and the recoil of the musket was
hardly perceptible. He used Dupont's
No. 1 rifle powder, and in one string ol ,
twenty-five shots he scored as follows:
564456556 4 47 j
445655454 4 45
5 4 4 4 IT
Total â¢. 109
Possible. 125.
C. F. Waltham also of the Nationals was
on the range and scored as follows:
544646655 4â46
666456444 6â46
454556454 5â 46
654464665 5â47
656444466 4â45
The Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club's
regular shoot was held as usual and half of
the members, it was found, had become
addicted to the . use of the nitro. This
powder they use in everything from
the 22 target pistol to the high-class
target rifle with excellent results. H.
R. Crane has recently gone over to the
nitro ranks. He has been an expert hunts
man and scored great success in the field.
Now he is devoting all of his spare time
to target practice. The best scores of the
members yesterday were as follows:
Pistol, Blanding medal, three shots, open to
all comers- C. M. Dalss, 8, 12, 12; J. K.Gor
man, 9. 10, 11; A. 11. Pape, 10, 12, 14; F. O.

The German sharpshooters were out in
large numbers and some excellent scores
were made. In the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein's regular bullseye con
test for cash prizes the following scores
show fine holding:
First, John Lankenau, 121 points; second,
F. P. Schuster, 157; third, C. Thierbach, 231;
fourth', 11. Zetker, 301; fifth, C. F. Rust, 312;
sixth, John de Wit, 399; seventh, J. C. Waller,
418; eighth, R. Finking, 482; ninth, A. H.

William Plath, 831; eighteenth, H. Uuber,
8 ( i2; nineteenth, A. Mocker, 1115; twentieth,
A. Berthelsen, 1172.
The bullseye shoot of the German
Schuetzen Club for cash prizes shows
some good shooting:
First, R. Finking, 439 points; second, H. j
Zecher,4Uo; third, H.M. Wreden, 514; fourth. '
F. P. Schuster, 575; fifth, H. Huber, 734;
tixth, F. H. Bushnell, 70S; seventh, H. Bur
feind, 790; eighth, D. B. Faktor, 812; ninth,
L. Bcndel, 826.
In the monthly medal shoot of the
Nordentscher Schuetzen Club, the cham
pionship class failed to fill. J. Gefken of
the second class and G. Scbulz of the
fourth, by yesterday's record, became the
permanent owners "of their class medals.
The other scores stood :
First class, H. Huber. 418 rings.
Second class, J. Gefken, 391.
Third class, F. Rust, 351.
Fourth class, G. Schulz, 289.
First best sho', J. de Wit, 24.
Last best shot, H. Huber, 24.

H. Guembel Jr. Won the Much-
Coveted Honors and the
Medal.
Every stand in the Schuetzen Park rifle
range near San Rafael was filled yesterday
witn sharpshooters, and many were the fine
scores made and medals won. One of the
events of the day was the contest for the
honors of shooting king of the Eintracht
Schuetzen Club. The honor and the gold
medal fell to the lot of H. Guembel Jr.,
who made 63 points out of a possible 75.
The presentation was made by Captain
Kuhls, and the trophy is permanently the
property of the winner, as he won it two
years ago.
The usual bullseye shoot of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club drew out nearly all
of the members. John Utachig came very
close to the center and won the first prize.
The scores made were as follows:
John Utschijt 68 points, H. Guembel 386, H.

DR. A. T. SANDfcXâ Dear Bib: I received
your Electric Belt on February 9 last and wore
it from two to three hours every night for
about two months, and nave not had any of
the old rheumatic pains since, and wake up
in the morning after a refreshing sleep feeling
pood, My partner, Henry Mauvis, wore the
Belt for vital weakness and indigestion, and
feels to-day that your Belt has cured him of
those complaints. I. shall recommend it to
all who are suffering from the above com-
plaints. The $30 we paid for your Belt we are
not sorry for. I would not sell it for twice the
amount If I could not get another. Yours re-

Can drugs show any such record? Do
you want any better evidence of the faith-

The stage was beautifully decorated |
with roses, violets, lilies and ferns, light
colored silk draperies making up the back
ground.
Every seat in the auditorium was taken
when President William N. Ryder rapped
for order. The programme opened witn a
selection, "The Barrett March," exquis
itely rendered by Young's orchestra.
President Ryder in a few well -chosen
words then declared the convention open,
after which Mrs. Julia Schlesinger deliv
ered the address of welcome. She said:
In the history of all nations, peoples and in
dividuals are recorded marked events which
had great influence upon and in large measure
Ehaped their ultimate destinies. Some of these
at the time of their occurrence were regarded
as unimportant and Insignificant; but later
on. in the light of succeeding events, were re
garded as pivotal points upon which had cen
tered mighty changes and upon which had de
pended future successes or defeats. When tne
history of spiritualism in California shall have
been written this day will be marked as one of
(treat importance in having rthaped and
directed the future of the movement along the
most advanced lines known to the workers of
the preaent generation.
The fullest ana deepest significance of this
convention can scarcely be comprehended at
first glance. It is not merely to extend greet
ing and give royal welcome to a noted co
worker in our ranks that we are here assem
bled. The principle underlying this demon
stration is deeper, grander and more far-reach
ing than the mere expression of the courtesies
of life to a brother. It comprehends and em
braces our sympathy with and co-operation in
the work in which he is engaged, of the cause
of which he is the able champion and of which
he is, by virtue of his office and own intrinsic
merits, the highest representative in the land.
In doing honor to him we express our loyalty
to the great organization, the National Spirit
ualists' Association, of which he is the worthy
and respected president.
For nearly half a century spiritualism has
struggled against all forms of superstition and
ignorance and endeavored to take its proper
place as the leader in all reforms, the teacher
of the highest morality, the evangel of light
ana liberty, the bearer of glad tidings to hu
manity of the life that is to come. It has met
with opposition and ridicule from the time the
first faint raps at Ilydesville startled the
whole world and inaugurated an era of re-
Eearch and investigation concerning the laws
governing and controlling our relations to the
buperphysical universe, the continuity oi life
beyond the grave, and the possibility of hold
ing intelligent communication wiin the uii
seen intelligences of the spiritual world.
This opposition has been alike bitter and un
reasoning from pulpit and press. The former,
especially, has hurled iis anathemas at the
whole movement and denounced its represent
atives, its mediums and teachers &t> being
"common and unclean"â fit emissaries of the
evil one, doing his work, destroying the very
foundations of the church and society with
their heresies and infidel teachings. Its most
bitter foes have been those who should have
been its stanchest friends and received it mo-t
gladly as giving to the world the evidence
they did not possess, of that which ihey
taught and professed to believeâ the immor
tality oi the soul â a fetate of conscious ex i&U
ence'after death.
Notwithstanding the foes without and fool
ish ones within the fold spiritualism has gone
steadily along presenting its facts, demon
strating every proposition and principle ad
vanced, gradually commanding the respectful
attention of many of the world's greatest
thinKers and their scientific investigation and
indorsement of its claims. It has grown with
the flight ol time into a powerlul and effectual
force for the amelioration of the cond. lions of
the people in all the departments of lite wher
ever wrongs exist and injustice triumphs.
Wherever tearful, longing eyes have been
turned toward that land of peace and promise,
anxiously waiting for some sign from their be
loved, it has brought the tender answer; wher
ever hearts have been broken and crushed by
cruel wrongs it has brought love'i oil and wine
and poured out its healing, bulm-giving
strength, comfort and consolation. To the
mentally enslaved by old dogmas and super
stitions it has given light and freedom; to
those in doubt and ignorance of their immortal
birthright it has opened the windows of
heaven, until its shining radiance has illu
mined their darkness and dispelled all doubt.
Within the brief space of forty-eight years it
has extended, until to-day there is not a State
In the Union or a spot on the civilized globe
where its pure teachings have not been advo
cated and where its adherents may not be
found.
It has gained a foothoid in the islands of the
sea, and its truths have been scattered broad
;tift unto the uttermost ends of the earth, mid
are published in many different Uragoaces v.nd
accepted by people oi every nation, iintlr^ci,
tribe and tongue.
\\V. have strong, wealthy, incorporated so-
Meties, public halls, libraries and ordained
tuinisttTÃ.
But with all our brilliant attainments there
lias been lacking that thorough and lorderly
system of work which obtains only through |
general organization and by (means of which i
the greatest good is accomplished. Our most
far-seeing and prophatic teachers saw a time
coming when we must stand before the world
a united, fraternal brotherhood and sisierhood
for the more successful promulgation of the ;
spiritual philosophy and the putting into
practice in a more systematic and efficient
manner its beneficent. teachings for the uplift
men t and betterment of humanity here and
hereafter.
That time has already come and only waits
the coming of our people to a clear under
standing of their duties and responsibilities
and the perception of the disaster involved in
procrastination to arouse them to immediate
action.
A critical period is near at hand. The people
are in the throes of a death agony or the pangs
of a new birth. Which shall it be? Shall we, |
whore eyes have beheld the glimmering light
on the "distant hilltops, close them and say.
"the night is upon us still," or shall we
awaken to the exigencies of the hour and pro
claim that the morn is breakingâ that angels I
of love and wisdom are speaking to the hearts j
of men In no uncertain tones asking them to
turn their faces from the darkness unto the
everlasting lightâ to break the fetters of igno
rance, superstition and slavery, and pre-empt
their claims to an unfettered, unchained man
hood and all that is involved therein?
Have we as spiritualists nothing further to do !
after receiving the comforting message that our ;
beloved dead are living still? Is that all there
la of spiritualism? If that were all then it
would be â carcelj worth seeking, for we would ,
have but a brief time to wait until the inevi
table change which comes to all would reveal
death's mystery. But spiritualism compre
hends more than the possibility of communi
cating with the intelligences of the unseen
world. Its storehouses of knowledge, its won
derful resources of wisdom and happiness, its
divine potentialities and revetments, its
great unexplored heights and depths are still
hefore us compassing infinite possibilities and
attainments, all-embracing, vast, limitless as
eternity.
Shall we not hasten to possess ourselves of
this magnificent inheritance and appropriate
its benefactions for the upliftment of the race?
Humanity groans beneath its burdens, which
are the result of ignorance of past ages and
the almost criminal stupidity of the present.
I Spiritualism comes as the great reformer and
I liberator. The prophets, sages and saviors of
I all times who have pussed to the immortal life
I and garnered its lessons of wisdom, return
1 with clearer vision and loftier perceptions of
man's relations to physical life and the life
spiritual. They are the world's great teachers,
and just to the extent to which mankind be
comes receptive to their angelic ministrations
will the physical conditions of life be made
better until that beautiful ideal, the kingdom
of heaven, shall in reality be established upon
earth. With such grand achievements in view,
such wonderful possibilities before us, we
should welcome every he. ping hand, reach out
in every direction for aid, use every stepping
stone by which we can climb to higher ground
until the summit is attained.
From the watch-towers of the East have
come the signals of assistance. Let the West
respond by planting Its blazing torches upon
every mountain peak from British Columbia
to the Mexican border. Let us clasp hands
across the "great divide" and proclaim to our
brothers and si>ters of the Atlantic shores that
we of the Pacific recognize the need of tnis
great union of forces and welcome ii as the
harbinger of the dawn.
On behalf of the spiritualists of California
and of tnose represented by this convention
do I welcome the signal- bearer from the Eastâ
the man who comes to us to-day with this
wonderful message of love and fraternity â
Harrison D. Barrett of Washington. Mr. Bar
rett, it affords me great pleasure to welcome
you to our Golden State, to our beautiful
City, our homes and our firesides, and also to
assure you of our steadfast and unwavering
good-feiiowÂ»hip and sincere desire that suc
cess may crown your worthy efforts in the
cause for which you have come among us,
and that you may go back to your Eastern
home bearing the glad tidings of the forma
tion of a spirital union as abiding es the
eternal heavens and as indissoluble as the
marriage of the stars.
President Barrett said that no language
of his could express his gratitude for the
warm words of welcome that had iust been
uttered. Hfe hoped that perlect harmony
*ould prevail, resulting in the unification
of all true believers in spiritualism.
One of the most interestine features of
the morning programme was presented at
this point. The several spiritual Sunday
schools gave an intelligent physical culture
exercise, which was greatly enjoyed by
those present.
A Daper, "Restoration of Religion and
Philosophy," by Joseph Rhoades Bu
chanan of San Jose, was read by C. H.
"Wadsworth. It was probably the event of
the day. Mr. Buchanan has been a spirit
ualist for nearly forty years, and though
nearly 80 years old now, is still an active
worker in the cause. He spoke as follows:
The spiritual movement of the present cen
tury is a reaction against modern degeneracy,
and makes a vigorous protest against the gross
materialism which has become so conspicuous
among scientists, and especially against the
gloomy pessimism of Schopenhauer, which is
President Harrison It. Barrett Addressing the Spiritualist Convention at Golden
Gate Hall Last Evening.
THE SAN FtfAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1896.
the most degrading style of thought that over
obtained any currency in literature.
Tne profound religious sentiment of Pales
tine, which brought the Jewish nation into
close relation with the spirit world and ren
dered it possible for Christ to find among them
worthy apostles of his religion, has been
scarcely visible among the nations of the pres
ent century.
Apostles "ready to sacrifice fortune and even
life if necessary in the pursuit of spiritual and
relipiou* truth are almost unknown to-day.
The .-piritual movement oi to-day revives the
spirit and the scenes which murked the days
oi the apostles, when the power of the spirit
world was welcomed in every religious assein- I
bly and many were inspired with healing and
prophetic powers, which St. Paul urged them
to cultivate, regarding tne prophetic power as
especially valuable.
The spiritual movement to-day is largely a
renaissance of the spiritual phenomeuu of
primitive Christianity, making man familiar
witn the exalted life" of the spirit world and
capable of reaching the wise and ancient spir
its who attended the labors of Jesus and the
apostles, by whom our minds may be led to the
Almighty Father.
As In religion we are reviving the noblest
thoughts of antiquity, so in philosophy we
are turning away from modern materialism to
the loftier thoughts and purer sentiments oi
ancient philosophers.
The Spiri-ualist has the pure and earnest
faith of antiquity which animated the apos
ties, and he can sympathize with St. Paul in
his earnest language when he rejoiced that he
had fought the faithful light of duty and
knew there wns a crown waiting for him in
heaven.for we know that we may go with abso
lute certÃinty from a well-spent file on earth to
some of the many mansions that are ready for
us. where all we love will welcome us, and
where the sunshine of divine love will never
be hidden by the clouds and storms of earth,
nor the music of celestial song be disturbed by
the eternal wail of our dearest friends in the
agonies of fire.
And Spiritualism will elevate our colleges
an-1 universities to the dignity and refinement
of ancient philosophy, which gave more atten
tion to our higher duties, our moral principles
and the invisible soul worid than to the physi
cal studies which are tributary to the shop and
the factory.
The Lyceum quartet and Young orches
tra furnished the music for the occasion.
The quartet rendered a selection, after
which an adjournment was taken until 2
o'clock.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Interesting Addresses Delivered
by Prominent Spiri
tualists.
The afternoon session was devoted to ad
dresses, songs and papt rs by well-known
spiritualists. William Emmet Coieman j
! spoke on "The Value of Spiritualism to the
| World." Among other things he said:
Spiritualism has demonstrated the existence
of the spiritual universe and of a future life
for man. In this materialistic age, when so I
; many are doubtingâ nay, are absolutely deny
i ingâ the existence of aught in the universe ex
cept matter and force, had spiritualism done
nothing else but prove the existence of spirit,
that work would be the crowning glory of this
nineteenth century, exceeding all the achieve
ments at.d acquirements of material science
and phyt-ical discovery with which this teem
ing age is so prolific. Next, f>ri ritualism de- I
thrones the "King ol Terrors," destroying all i
tear of death.
In the spiritualistic philosophy death is j
shown to be an inestimable blessing tn the |
divine economy of natureâ the pattiway to the
brighter glories and purer felicities of the I
sweet by-ar.d-hy. Relief from fear of death I
constitutes a gleaming, glittering jewel In the
I diademic circle crowning the laurel-entwined
i brow of modern spiritualists. Eternal pun
t ishment. another monster ghastly and gaunt,
i has fallen to the earth transfixed by the pierc
! ing dart of spiritualistic reveaiment. Progress
I eternal is, we know, through spiritualism the
| birthright of the human soul. No heart so
black with hate and fierce malignity but what
in time will be attuned to sweetest harmony
: and purest love; no soul so blood-stained,
iso thickly crusted o'er with vice and
crime, villainy and turpitude, but what
is destined as the ages roll to be
redeemed therefrom, to walic arrayed in robes
of purest white, symbolic of abiding virtue,
purity and truth. Kel! un<l fabled Satnn/the
whilom "roaring lion," coursing up and down
the earth, devouring old and young, the pau-
I per and the affluent, we now find tethered fast
I where'er the light of spiritual science illumes
I the pathway. Liberal Christianity, t'niversal-
I ism. Unitarianism, etc., sorely wounded the
I devil, but Spiritualism completely killed him
and buried him out of sight, beyond all hope
I of resurrection.
Vice-President W. T. Jones paid his
respects to the recent legislation in several
j of the Eastern States against mediums
and spiritualists, asking all present to join
the ranks of the Mediums' Protective As
sociation.
"One of the important matters that
should engage the attention of this con
vention," raid Mr. Jones, "is protection to
; medium" in the exercise of their minister
â¢ial functions. I need not tell you that J
anless this i? secured the avenues of com
munication with the spirit world will be
:losed. Some of our sister States have
ilready passed laws which may seriously
iffect "our mediums and healers, and
judging from the experience of some of
the mediums in this City during the past
\rear we may take warning and begin to
prepare ourselves for a similar fate.
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
Let 'Justice to all, special privileges to
none, 1 be our motto and watchword.
"We are living in an age when statutory
enactments affect and control, in a meas
ure, almost every human acaon aud in
terest, and since the laws of our iand to
some extent are framed by and through
the influence of cunning and selfish de
signing men for their own aggrandize
ment, is it to be wondered at tbat the
pages of our statute books are disgraced
with arbitrary and unjust laws?
"Lite every movement in the past hav
ing in view the enlightenment and the
emancipation of the human mind from the
darkness of ignorance and the bondage of
superstition, spiritualism has received its
share of reproach and calumny, its seers,
prophets and mediums, and its advocates
everywhere in some way have suffered.
"1 have not time to cite cases to prove
my Btatemeut. The facts are well known
to many of you. The rights of individu
als guaranteed by the constitution of our
country have been too often disregarded.
Freedom to exercise natural and latent
gifts and powers to minister to the need 6
of humanity, especially when this power
is used to alleviate pain, has been ma
liciously denied to our spiritual and mag
netic healing mediums,"
Mrs. Addie L. Ballou, famous in spirit
ualistic circles, discoursed on "Spiritual
ism. Its Benefits to Women, Home and
the Government." The main point of her
argument centered in a general proposi
tion that spiritualism had done much to
elevate woman, giving her perfect freedom
of thought and action, thereby making
her a factor in the government of the
country.
Miss Ella Wneeler Marchant of San
Bernardino followed in a poetical address
on "Tne World's Nine O'clock." Mrs.
Cowell of Oakland then delivered what
she called an ' inspned talk," after which
Miss Jennie C. Read of Portland spoke as
foilowa:
I have not come bciore you particularly as a
spiritualist representative, for 1 am within the
pale of the Unitarian Church. Still, profes
sion counts very little, for "by their fruits ye
shall know them."
Creeds are worthless, save as you make them
accord with your everyday liic.
However, 1 am glad to say to the friend* here
that 1 believe in spiritual phenomena and the
ci'Miuunication of the two worlds.
It is not every church member who believes,
who Is willing to a>seut it. I claim no credit
for an honest statement, nor venture to ques
tion the attitude oi others. Spiritualism is the
fundamental principle of most rehgious. That
angels hover over us and guurd us. is taught
from all pulpits of the Christian churches.
But when you call it spiritualism they hoid
up their hands In holy horror.
Friends, we need no appeal asking God to
come to us, buÂ« simply a recognition of the dl-
Tine within each and every one of us. Oar
spiritÃ are his pulsating lifeâ the very fiber of
his being.
May we all feel In spirit and In truth, "Thy
will, not mine, be done." so that the mani
festation of the highest life may come through
each and every one of us.
Every nubia thought uttered here today is
the expression of a higher intelligence playing
upon divine instruments, whether It be from
an individualized gpirlt upon the other t^ide of
life or inspiration irom the all-pervaaing ele
ment of spirit and thought that exists all
about us.
We also have a personal spiritual influence
upon those with whom we come in contact.
T;ia: we aro responsible for as to how we play
upon sensitive natures aud whether we create
ui-oo'd or harmony. For It is not alone the
spoken words that give power, not merely the
outward utterance*, but the awakened con
science, the silent thoughts, the warm, pul
sating heart overflowing with love for human
ity and a desire to ameliorate its conditions.
After a song by the Lyceum Quartet the
convention adjourned until 7:3u o'clock.

SPANISH PEOPLE PICNIC.
Sun Rafael Fark the Scene of a Most
Snccemiful Outing.
The Spanish Benevolent Society of Cali
fornia held its nineteenth annual picnic at
Schoen's San Rafael I'ark yesterday, and
the affair was, in the opinion of ttie mem
bers and their friends, the most successful
event of the kind which this organization
has yet held.
Dancing, bowling for prizes, running
races and similar amusements contributed
to the day's sport.
The committee having the affair in
charge was Jose Alonzo, president; J. J.
Fatjo, treasurer; M. Garcia, secretary; M.
Arjo, recording secretary; S. Mendez, vice
president, and Louis Guardea, floor man
ager. _
Hoitt's School Reception.
The literary exercises at the annual re
ception of Hoitt's school at Burlingame
last Saturday were of a high order. A
large company was in attendance and
offered generous applause as each boy
acquitted himself with credit. A bounti
ful lunch was served, followed by an exhi
bition in field sports, which were also of a
high order, two of the participants having
won fir.it medals in league contests. The
school colors are green and gold, and the
school hall was beautifully decorated in
these colors. A social dance in the even
ing ended the festivities, which, as a
whole, were much enjoyed by the boys
and their friends. This closes the hfth
year of this excellent institution, which is
accredited at both of our universities.
Ex-State Superintendent Hoitt is well
known in educational matters. The men
tion of his name as master of the jchooi
is a guarantee to all who know him. thai
none Uut first-class teachers are employed
and that tl)3 school under his manage
ment ranks among the lirst of its kiad.
Nowhere are boys better cared for.

GOING AFTER
LI HUNG CHANG.
Arrival of Louis Spitzel of
Shanghai, Sent by
the Emperor.
RETURNS VIA THIS CITY
Will Meet Chang in London or
Paris and Come to New
York.
HIS RETINUE OF SIXTY.
Chang Drew His Petitions on the Em
peror and Stumped Him â Big
gest Man in China.
Among the arrivals here last night from j
China via Vancouver was Louis Spitzel of ;
Shanghai, the sole representative of the j
Thames Iron Works in China, who has i
been delegated by the Emperor of the j
Flowery Kingdom to go and meet Li
Hung Chang, who is attending the coro- j
nation of the Czar at Moscow.
Mr. Spitzel will conduct the great Chi
nese through America, and will come to
San Francisco, where he and his charge
will take ship for Cnina. Mr. Spitzal is
accompanied by his son and his secretary.
He has been a number of years in China,
and has taken some big contracts there.
As the representative of the Thames Iron
Works he has filled several orders for
ships, has filled some contracts for railroad
material, and during the Chinese-Japanese
war furnished guns, munitions and other
supplies in enormous quantities.
In his own words he has made "con
tracts amounting to some millions" in
China, and it is not unlikely that he will
fur man other millions of supplies to China.
Mr. Spitzel will not be able to reach
Moscow at the end of the coronation exer
cises, so he will meet Li Hung Chang in
Paris or London, and after being with liim
a while there will start for the United
States.
"Li Hung Chang has a retinue of sixty
persons with him, including Lord Li and
several other notable persons, besides his
secretaries and followers," Btid Mr.
Spitzel at the Palace last ni^ht.
"Li Hung Chang does not speak English,
but he is so shrewd a man that no differ
ence in what language you speak he knows
from your manner substantially what you
have said. He is an extraordinary char
acter in every way, and is stronger than
j ever he was in China. He is bigger than
th<s Chinese Emperor.
"I waa there and dined with him on his
seventy-third birthday, on February 18
last. He looked ten years younger than
he was. He sleeps as sound as an infant.
"Li gets up at 6 o'clock in the morning,
works till 12, has lunch and then works
till 3in the afternoon. At 10 at night he
retires to bed, and doee not have a dream
that disturbs him. He is, as I have said,
a wonderful man.
"He has been the real man behind
China all along. He petitioned the Em
peror three years ago for an army and
navy that would meet the exigencies of
the case. He saw what waÂ« coniina: and
wanted to be ready. But he could not
convince anybody that he was right.
" Wi.en fault was found with him at the
time of the war he produced coDies of his
petition to the Emperor. His position
then was acknowledged as being rieht,
and he is a bigger man to-day than he
has ever been. They see that he is the
only man who can reform China.
"I think there will be only one Viceroy,
and that be will be Li Hung Chang.
"The Americans have got a chance to get
in and build railways there. Li Hung
Chang told me he was very friendly to the
Americans, and tacitly said tbat he felt
like favoriua; the people of this country.
"I will meet him in London or Paris,
come back to Southampton with nim and
then cross to New York. We will stay
there a short time and then go to Wash
ington and possibly to Chicago, and then
will come straight to San Francisco. We
will be here several days before sailing.
"1 want to say you have got a good Con
sul to Shanghai in Mr. Jernegan. Min
ister Denby is also a very popular man."
Mr. Spitzel will leave to-day for the
East.

MONDAY MAY 25, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
To the extremist on any issue all mod
eration is a straddle.
If the unexpected happens Congress may
do something this week.
A divided Democracy is what Populism
is counting on for a dividend.
The St. Louis Convention is a conundrum
that can be answered only by itself.
The next step for Republicans is to get
ready for the ratification meetings.
The most popular dissolving views at
present are on tne financial question.
Democracy has no platform, no candi
date, no watchword and no band-wagon.
It is said if Congress adjourns early
Cleveland will call it back. He has a
string on it.
There is no longer any question of har
mony in the Republican party, and the
thing to be attended to now is organiza
tion.
Tbe Russell boom has got co far ahead
of others in tbe Democratic swim that a
good many people have begun to call him
Billy.
The average Democrat doesn't mind the
humiliation of having to eat his Cleveland
record, but what grinds him is that it is
so tough.
Three years' experience with Democracy
has convinced the people that a party
which cannot govern right has no right
to govern.
Cleveland may have thought that under
the circumstances the Dest way to get a
note on the third term to his party was to
drop it in the dead letter office.
They do not call it "Greater Sew York"
in that city, but "Grander New York,"
with a tone which implies that mere great
ness is the least of their ambitions.
A bill has been introduced into Con
gress to forbid excursion steamers from
interfering with yacht races, and thus the
Dunraven episode promises some good
result after all.
It has been discovered that the city pay

Under a newly adopted sanitary ord
nance in New York any one who spits on
the floor of a public building, a railway car
or a ferry-boat, is liable to arrest and im
prisonment. So the average American
citizen in that metropolis will have to
travel around with a pocket cuspidor.
The latest step in the way of civic reform
in the East is a demand that all city pay
rolls shall be published monthly, giving a
classified list of names, addresses and sal
aries or wages of all persons employed in
each department. It is believed such a
course would frighten payroll staffers and
save big money.
Tbe absence at this stage of the cam
paign of any of those free-trade documents
which were scattered about so plentifully
in tbe last three Presidential elections is
fairly Rood proof that we are about to en
ter a new era in which the protective sys
tem will be accepted as the established
policy of tbe country.
Slowly across the continent has come a
wailing voice, complaining that no one
invited Congress to attend the unveiling
of tbe Hancock monument, but, as it is
known that Cleveland made the principal
speech of the occasion, it is hardly neces

doing the complaining.

THE OLD CRY.
The old cry of the Democratic party that
under protection tbe wealth increase of
tbe country goes to factory proprietors is
being put in running order for the ap
proaching campaign. It is a device to
play upon the credulity of people who al
low their party leaders to do their think
ing for them. It has done the party good
service hitherto and doubtless will hold a
good many in line in the coming struggle,
and it is hardly worth the while of any
one to try to set them right. It is the
business and the duty of Republicans to
demonstrate with facts, figures and expe
rience the fallacy of the charge that pro
tection enriches the few at the expense of
the many, but it is not incumbent upon
them to undertake to supply Democratic
idiocy with common sense wherewith to
apprehend so simple a proposition that it
would be absolutely impossible for factory
owners to absorb the wealth increase of
the country. There is equal participation
in it from tbe producer of tbe raw material
to the retail merchant. That is to say,
each factor in tbe process receives in pro
portion to bis importance and investment.
It is true, however, as has been demon
strated over and over again, that under
free trade the wealth increase of this coun
try goes by a very short route to the Dock
ets of foreign factory owners. Our farm
ers know somewhat of the fallacy of Dem
ocratic economic theories* by experience.
In 1892 they exported breadstuffs
amounting to $299,363,000, fend last year
they had hard work to sell $114,604,000
worth of their products to foreign con
sumers. But our farmers are not having
all the deadly results of Democratic free
trade. Under Clevelandism we are buying
annually about $80,000,000 worth of mer
chandise from Brazil and we sell in the
markets of tbat country about $15,000,000
worth of our goods and wares. Meanwhile
England is selling Brazil about $47,000,000
worth of goods and buys about $5,000,000
worth. This leaves an annual trade bal
ance in favor of England of $42,00iJ,000.
which tnis country pays.
In view of these facts the stupidity of
some cf the rank and file of the Democratic
party must be very dense, else the leaders
would not so boldly deny the official
figures of exports and imports under the
administration of their own party. But
no doubt they overestimate the credulity
of even the most stupid of their followers,
for the experience of wage-earners since
the repeal of the protective laws has been
lamely in the line of job-hunting and en
forced idleness, with a painful scarcity of
money to buy bread and meat. In other
words, the Democratic party has been
running an economic school the past three
years and the people are very much better
educated now than they were. Hunger
and idleness have made their judgment
dangerously keen for Democratic use, and
no doubt they will right the wrongs that
have been heaped upon others by Cleve
land's free trade monstrosity.
SPANISH GENERALS.
The generals of no nation in the world
ever made such a record for stupidity, in
capacity and lying as the epauleted frauds
who have commanded the Spanish troops
in Cuba since early in the year 1895. The
Spanish political year-book for 18)5, which
has recently been received in this country,
gives the following authentic account of
the number of soldiers the Madrid Govern
ment sent to Cuba iast year to crush the
rebellion :
Troops in Cuba February 24, 1895 13,000
First expedition from Spain 8,593
Second expedition 7,477
Third expedition r. 4,068
Fourth expedition â 2,96.:
Fifth expedition ft,601
Sixth expedition 29,055
Seventh expedition 26,5*23
Eighth expedition 9.033
Ninth expedition 18.901
Troops at Porto Kico sent to Cuba 1,662
Cavalry paid by Havana 800
Naval infantry incorporated in the army.. 3.000
Volunteers of Havana 2,000
Volunteers sent from fcpain 2,600
Criminals pardoned and enlisted 8,700
Reserved called out to replace tne dead.... 23,000
New reserves called at the end of ISÂ»S 8.000
Total men 172,295
In addition to these 172.295 soldiers from
Spain Cuba has furnished, under compul
sion, of course, fully 50,000 for garrison
duty in Havana and other cities. This
gives a grand total of 222,295 well armed
and well drilled soldiers, who, after light
ing for fifteen months, find themselves
huddled up in towns and cities for safety.
Meanwhile, the rebels have captured and
now hold all of every one of the six prov
inces of the Island except the towns and
cities, and no doubt they would hold those
situated out of reach of the Spanish navy
if it were to their interest to hold them.
But the singular part of it all is the five
corps which constitute the rebel forcas da
not number over 45,000 all told and most
of them have been poorly armed until
quite recently. Hitherto the Spanish gen
erals have referred to the insurgents as an
army of invaders, but now that the rebel
General Gomez has issued an order
calling his ' troops "The Republic's
Army of Occupation" General Weyler
will probably work himself into a
fit of long-range exasperation and shoot
a batch of old men and women. However,
Spain is hurrying to dispatch 40,000 more
men to engage in putting down the rebel
lion, which will make the grand total sent
against the 45,000 rebels mount up to
262,295.
When it is remembered that, according
to Spanish reports, there has been a battle
every day for nearly 400 days and that the
rebels have invariably retreated after los
ing about ten men to Spain's two, one is
disposed to ask whether the rebels have
the power to reincarnate the next moment
after death or whether General Weyler
and his officers do not know how to tell
the truth. Anyway, if President Cleve
land does not hurry up and recognize the
belli. erency of the Cubans the opportunity
may slip him. They may not want it
later on.
HOPELESSLY DIVIDED.
The Democratic party is hopelessly
divided on the money question, and the
report is that each faction will appear in
the Chicago Convention under the leader
ship of a kind of Jack the Kipper. It is
said, however, that the Cleveland wing or
gold standardites are beginning to experi
ence about the same feeling that vertigo
imparts to the human organism â dizziness
and swimming in the head.
It is hinted that Cleveland himself is
now perfectly willing that the other side
shall have the organization, platform and
candidates if the convention will spare his
administration the humiliation of being
denounced for betraying the party. Mr.
Cleveland knows bis interpretation of the
money plank of the platform of 1892 was
not only not warranted by the traditions
of the party, but was diametrically opposed
to the spirit and meaning of the planic as
understood by the convention and that
there is no escape for his reputation for
unfair dealing except by covering it up in
seeming forgetfulness by the coming con
vention.
Boies, Bland ana Altgeld, however, re
member the snubbing the administration
basgivjn them, and now that things are
surely coming then way they are not dis
posed to hold the hand of their Jack the
Ripper. It is fair to assume that the op
position to Cleveland* administration is
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1896.
born of a sincere belief that he ana his co
adjutors deliberately and for a ourpose de
parted from the rut in whicn the party has
always traveled, and that the shades of
Jefferson and Jackson would torment them
were they to fail to administer a telling re
buke to the would-be destroyer of the party.
But anyway, there will be a big row,
which will so weaken the Democracy that
the business interests of tbe country will
be so firmly rooted in Republican princi
ples of government that if it should ever
again show strength it could do no more
harm than any other ghost.
CAUSE OF LUNACY.
Dr. L. Forbes Winslow, the eminent
London neurologist, is out with a com
parative statement of the percentage of
insane to the population in various coun
tries. He finds that France gives the low
est and Ireland the highest percentage,
which is a great surprise. The people of
France have been supposed to be degen
erating mentally and physically for sev
eral generations. The average Frenchman
has the reputation of preferring a life
which contemplates nights and days of
high and riotous livine, mostly in the di
rection of those things which bear heavi
est upon the nervous system ; but if Dr.
Winslow is right either the character of
the French people is misunderstood or
their habits are conducive to results quite
the opposite of lunacy.
It is no less a surprise to be told that the
people of Ireland furnish a larger per
centage of insane than America, England
or Scotland, for as a race they are a happy,
fun-making and fun-loving people. It is
an old saying that trouble must be great
when an Irishman cannot throw it
off at his heels, but Dr. Winslow
says that 1 in 303 Irishmen and 1 In
747 Frenchmen "go daft." For America
his figures are 1 to 623, for Scotland 1 to
430 and England 1 to 400. These ligures
are remarkable in that they upset all
neurological data on the subject and con
tradict the theory that licentious luxury
and dissipation are conducive to lunacy.
But the good doctor must be mistaken,
just as he was in many of his statements
before the Medico-Legal Society in New
York latt year. Putting aside the exces
sive dissipation in America, the rush,
whirl and excitement of our business life
is a strain upon the mind and nerves such
as no other people invite or indulge in,
and yet Dr. Winslow says the quiet and
fun-loving people of Ireland turn out
more than twice the percentage of crazy
folk. If the doctor knows what he is talk
ing about, the way to keep out of the lu
natic asylum is to limit one's excesses
only to bis physical and cash ability to
keep in the whirl. If Dr. Winslow will
tell how he arrived at his conclusions he
may convince the world that he ia rluht.
but meanwhile people generally will keep
on believing that ''early to bed and early
to rise makes a man healthy and happy
and wise."
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Redlands Citrograph Eays that the ex
citement regarding the oil fields in San Tim
oteo and Keche canyons is not abating, but ia
on tbe increÃse. There is a huge rush to se
cure locations, and claims are being located
in some cases a half a dozen times over. The
canyons and sagebrush-covered bills bristle
with location notices, some of them reported
to be a mile or two off tha land they are sup
posed to cover. That there is oil underlying
the section referred to there Is no doubt. Just
how much will prove paying property remains
yet to be proved.
Santa Rosa bicyclists are now burning Coal
ings oil in their bicycle-lamps with satisfac
tory results. The Republican of the first-named
city, having received a sample of refined coal
oil from Captain Frank Barrett's wells near
Coalinga, observes that "the oil is brilliantly
clear, has tbe odor of the best kerosene and
burns with a bright flame and little smoke.
Tbe well.* in tbe western part of this county
are producing the finest grade of oil found on
tbe Pacific Coast, if not the belt in the United
States. Tbe prospect of practically unlimited
quantities being found, and of such superior
quality, means the development of a new and
vast industry in this part of the State."
The Stockton Mail reports that Robert L. Ed
wards, former Public Administrator of San
Joaquin County, has discovered an nsbcutot
mine which he thinks will bring him a fortune
before long. It is situated about fourteen miles
east of Raymond. Fays the MtU: The fact
that there was a deposit of asbestos there was
first suggested by the cropplngs of the ma
terial. Investigation Boon convinced Edwards
that there was & valuable deposit beneath the
ground and he was not slow in locating. The
ledge is one and a half feet at a depth of
twenty feet and after takiug out about two
tons of the valuable material he found no in
dication of any lessening of the ledge. A shaft
was run down at an angle of about forty-five
degrees and showed the exceedingly fine char
acter of the ledge. According to the owner
the material will bring about $75 a ton and aa
it is easily mined there will be an immense
profit In the working of the mine if the supply
ie what it appears to be. The asbestos at the
Edwards mine is not of the finest quality, but
it is good enough for all purposes of packing,
for which it is used about machinery. In spots
it runs to a very high grade.
Two big irrigation systems are destined to
work wonders in the extensive Salinas Valley.
The San Lorenzo Creek main canal is nine
miles long, twenty feet wide in the bottom
Bnd five feet deep, and bag a capacity to irri
gate 250 acres every twelve hours. The Sa
linas River canal will be fourteen miles long,
thirty feet wide on the bottom and five feet
deep. With reference to the matter, the King
City Settler says:
Too much cannot be said of the advantages of
irrigation with water from the Salinas Riwr, as it
carries ft fine sediment composed of gypsum and
lime, which, distributed over the land, acts as a
splendid fertilizer.
With these two systems In operation, who can
estimate the benefit that will accrue to this valley?
Within six months 8500 acres of the richest and
beat land the sun ever shone on will be under Irri
gation, every acre of which will grow all kinds of
deciduous fruits, sugar h â¢;.â¢<, alfalfa and cereals.
Already the effect of Irrigation Is seen. Two
hundred acres of orchard an 1 165 acr.s of sugar
beets were planted on the San Lorenzo rancho
alone, which Is a small percentage of what will bt
planted the coming season. The Salinas Valley
Orchard Company Is preparing to plant on a por
tion of [be San Hamto rancho 200 acres in winter
apples, and will seed 135 acres to sugar beets this
winter. .
While no fault can be fonnd with the railroad
tariff on beets from King City to Wataonville, it
being only 75 cents per ton, we should have a
sugar factory where the beets are grown. With
the large acreage under Irrigation, the lime is not
far distant whan we will have not only a sugar
factory, but canneries to preserve tha fruits grown
here.
In calling attention to the fact that the vast
sandy wastes'lying between the Colorado River
and the coast are unprovided with means to
give the traveler his bearings and direct him
to the nearest water, the San Diego Union de
clares that the absence of sign-posts is a seri
ous drawback to prospecting on the desert.
The paper in question suggests relative action
in the premises by the interested counties:
Many a man who would put money Into a mine
If he could see it for himself declines to undergo
the perils of a trip over the desert. Even good
miners whose held has heretofore been in less
daagi-rous regions shrink from prospecting over
the unmarked sandy wastes. Still, desert mining

Southern Ca ifornla's wealth. It would be won

that are chit- fly interested to take united action to
remove what is at present the great drawback to
the industry.
Four whales have been caught in Monterey
Bay already thia year and the Monterey *Yew
Era is led to remark that '-whaling promises to
become once more one of the leading indus
tries of the town." A whale which will yield
450 gallons of oil was captured there last week
and Captain Jose Pedro states that he expects
an excellent season. The New Era reports him
thus:
He said that the most whales should be caught
during tbe months of August. September, October,
November and December, when they should be In
nrime condition. Daring these months. hÂ« ex
plained, a good-sljed whale should rie d all the
way from SOO to 2000 jtallonaof oil. Speaking of
past exppriecces the veteran whaler told of one
notable day, eight years ago, when four enormons
whales were cauÃht here in one day, the oil from
which amounted to more than 7000 gallons.
Discussing the bad roads question in the
light of a local campaign issue, the Los An
geles Tinittr makes the pertinent suggestion:
By way of a starrer in this matter how would It
do this fall to make candidates for Supervisors
take a castlron pledge to favor a comprehensive
system of road improvement that will put an end
to the present extravagant method of tinkering
roads and give us the beginning of a first-class
system of public highways? Our present nietbed,
or rather lack of method, of constructing roads is
extravagant and, ridiculous, and would have ex
cited the derision of those early road-bullderÂ» 000
years or more ago. whose work still remains In
food preservation on the continent of Europe.
The American idea of a country road appears to
b* to level off the soil and wherever there is a hole
filling it with loose dlrt-and then filling it again.
It needs as much science to construct a flrst-claaÂ»

meet on the street can build a road. Conse

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
'â¢If I had my way," said Special Treasury
Agent J. B. Crowley just before sailing on tbe
Homer a day or two ago for tbe rookeries, "I
would k ill all the seals on the Pribyloff Islands.
We would then see a scattering of the seven ty
five or hundred schooners that have been for
the last several seasons regularly poaching on
the possessions of the Government.
"The schooners would then have to go out of
tbe business and into some other occupation.
We have tried everything else up to date and
none of the plans work to keep the poaching
vessels off the scaling territory.
"It is true we capture some of them once in
a while, but there are always plenty more to
carry on the work. They have harassed us,
Special Treasury Agent J B Crowley, Who Wants All the Seals of the Pribylo tt
Islands Killed and the Business Wound Up.
[Sketched from life by a " (Jail " artitt.\
embarrassed us and put the Government to
lots of cost.
"As they won't desist, after being treated as
considerately as it is possible for a Government
to treat interlopers, I think we would do well
to kill the seals at once , harvest the skins and
shut up shop.
"In this case the skins woula be ours, for we
would have them in our clutches all solid and
tight. Nobody else could get them. As it is
now our property wanders around in the water
and finally goes to the rookeries to breed the
young.
"On their way there and back they have to
run the gantlet of the guns of the piratical
hunters. These hunters swarm around in tne
neighborhood of the rookeries. Sometimes
they come close up, but not even the officials
on the islands can always he aware of this, for
the fog often settles down heavily there. It is
so thick that you can't see twenty feet before
you.
"You understand, therefore, something of
tbe difficulties we have to contend with on tbe
seal islands. The Government ought to kill iv
seals, stop the expense and force the piratical
schooners out of business. In aoout ten years
there would be some more seals, the result of
the accumulated increase of the few that had
escaped death.
"Then we could go to work and take care ot
them and do what we have been trying to do
for ten years or more past."

LADY'S WRINKLED SLEEVE.
One of the most graceful of the new sleeves
is shown here. In one the fitted sleeve is cov
ered with sleeve goods which is gathered into
the seams. This Is particularly pretty for
lawn, dimity, organdie, batiste, silk, mull and
chiffon, in fact any material not too heavy.
The lighter weight silks are made up after this
model with very good results, and some satin
bo treated is exceedingly pretty. Tne new can
vas cloths, which are thin enough to allow a
bright silk lining to snow through, are charm
ingly picturesque ia this wrinKled or gathered
sleeve.
The fitted sleeve is suitable for all fabrics.
A combination of materials may be employed
inmakinjflt. One was of Dresden 6ilk, with
the puff of dark thin canvas cloth of which the
waist was made, having a Bolero front, with a
blouse vest of the silk. The back of the waist
was smooth over a fitted lining, with a coat
basque laid in plaits, and reaching only to the
under-arin seams.
A green mohair cown had the puffs of mo
hair, the lawn sleeves and a round yoke on the
waist being of embroidered batiste over a vio
let silk lining.

PILOTS PLAYING
IN HARD LUCK,
Three of Their Number Are
Now on the Sick
List.
ONE NEAELY KILLED.
The Bark C. D. Bryant Had a
Merry Race With the
Pilot-boats.
TRIED TO ESCAPE THE DUES.
Georg3 A. Kn ; ghfs Gallant Rescue
of Three Maids Adrift in a
Beat.
The American bark C. D. Bryant com
pleted yesterday the best all-round trip
between here and Honolulu made this
year. The run down only occupied ten
days, and, although fifteen days elapsed
before she came to au anchor in the bay
on the return trip, still she was off the
heads last Friday night. This is Captain
John Lee's first voyage in the vessel and
he has made a record he is proud of.
On the run to Honolulu the vessel was
kept under full sail nearly all tbe way,
and when within a mile of the reef the
pilot boardea her. Captain Lee had been
on watch for thirty-six hours, and when
the pilot took control he went below to
take a bath. An hour later he was on
deck again, but, instead of the Bryant
being inside the reef, she was seven miles
to windward and well on her way to
Moiokai. It was a bard beat back to port,
but under the captain's skillful manage
ment good time was made.
When off the Goiden Gate on the return
trip the Bryant had a merry brush with
the pilot-boats Gracie S and America. If
a vessel can make port without being
spoken by a pilot, then no pilotage can be
charged. If she is spoken and no pilot is
taken, then quarter rates are charged.
The bark came along with a strong breeze
behind her. All her light sails were
furled, but, nevertheless, she was logging
twelve knots an hour. Gracie S was
in the oth'ng, with her mainsails reefed
and headed lor the flying packet. Captain
Jordan saw he was being left behind, so he
at once let out the reefs and, later, hoisted
his staysail and flying jib. The Bryant
still drew away and, as night was falling,
tne crew of the Gracie S began signaling
to the America, which was on the inside
station. Just when Captain Lee thought
he was safe the America shot oat of a fog
bank and hailed him. The hail was
answered and the bark held on her course,
but the skipper cursed his lucK in choice
Kanaka. The Bryant will Lave to pay
quarter rates.
Tue Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
P mona arrived from Eureka minus one
of the steerage passengers yesterday. On
the 23d inst. at 3:15 p. m", J. Jacobson
walked up from the steerage and went
directly to the bow of tbe ship. No atten
tion was paid to him until he began to
climb upou the bulwarks. Captain Doren
was on the bridge and he yelled to the
man to get down. Jacobson turned half
way around, looked at the captain a
moment, his lips were seen to move, but
no sound could be heard, he then waved
his hand and the next moment jumped
feet foremost into tbe ocean. The Pomona
was stopped at once and the signal "full
speed astern" rung up. A boat was low
ered and for over an hour the search was
kept up, but no trace of the suicide could
be found. Captain Doren thinks the man
was crazy and that he weighted himself
with some old iron before jumping over
board.
The pilots have been playing in very
hard luck of late. No leso than tnree of
them are on the sick list, but all are now
convalescing. Captain "Pete" Ott, the
genial old soul who is a favorite with every
shipmaster that enters the Golden Gate,
has been taking a rest at Lytton Springs.
He is all right again and before the Ist of
next month will be piloting ships into
port again. Captain Freeman had a nar
row escape when bringing tue John A.
Briggs into port. In order to save a tow
he sailed the ship in and thus nearly lo^t
his life. While making a short tack he
sprang to one of the ropes to IVlp the sail
ors. The rope parted and Captain Free
man was thrown from the poop to the
main deck. He was back at his post in a
minute and bad the ship on her course
before anybody knew anything had hap
pened.
He brought the Briggs to an anchor and
then attempted to got into a small boat to
go ashore. He found that his right aide
was terribly bruised and his right leg
swollen and useless. He had to be sent
home in a hack. An examination showed
that the tendons of the ankle were strained
and the small bones in tbe leg broken.
He will be laid up for several weeks to
come.
Captain Erskine met with his accident
on the Gracie B. Tbe pilot-boat was going
about in a heavy head sea and ti.e captain
gave a pull on one of the ropes. The rope
suddenly slackened up and then went
taut again, in d ing so it curled around
the third finger of ]Â£rskine'Â» right hand
and nearly tore the first joint off. When
the pilot-boat came to an anchor t -c pilot
went ashore and had the stump ampu
tated. That makes the tops of three fin
gers that Captain Erskine has lost in al
most precisely the same manner.
The water front was crowded and the
ferry-boiits did a large business yesterday.
From morning till night crowds thronged
East street and every car that landed at
the ferries was crowded. The Travelers'
picnic was the first to get away. They
went a thousand strong to Glen Ellen, and
a merrier crowd never crossed the bay.
An hour later the Verein Eintracht went
to Schuetzen Park and shortly after that
the rush for El Campo began. Several
times during the day the gates at both the
broad and narrow gauge ferries toTiburon
and Bausalito nad to be closed, owing to
the crowded condition of tbe steamers.
The rush to Oakland and Alameda was, if
anything, greater than on the other
routes, and the Southern Pacific had to
put on extra boats to accommodate the
throngs t at bought tickets.
It was the Queen's birthday, but strange
to say, vÂ«ry few of the British ships in port
were aecorated. On last Fourth of July
all tue English vessels were resplendent
with bunting, while the American vessels
contended themselves with flying the
stars and stnues. Yesterday, from Broad
way to Folsom street, there were only two
decorated ships. One was the American
bark C. C. Funk, and the other was the
British steamer Monowui.
The various boat clubs are in active
practice for the forthcoming regatta of the
South Ends at Sausalito. Crews from the
Ariels. South Ends, Pioneers, Dolphins
and Tritons were out yesterday and good
time waa made. Single scull, pair-oar and
iour-oar boats were out, and they helped
to enliven the scene on the bay.
During the afternoon a couple of young
men who were rowing three young ladies
got adrift off Meiggs wharf. '1 be rowers
were paying more attention to their pass
engers than to their oars, which went
adriit. They were drifting out to sea
when George A. Knight saw their signals
of distress and went to their assistance in

RAISED $6000 ALREADY,
As Much More Practically Pledged.
Rev. Mr. Kip Exhorts His People
to New Effort.
The Chapel of tbe Good Samaritan on
Second street, near Folsom, was crowded
yesterday morning, the occasion being
the second anniversary of the establish
ment of the chapel. Rev. William Ingra
bam Kip Jr., who has been laboring in
this field for tbe past two years, in his ser
mon outlined the growtn and purposes of
the institution, mentioning the numerous
subordinate organizations and what they
had accomplished.
The speaker bigan by statin* the prin
ciples for which the Good Samaritan mis
siou stands. "The parable of the good
Samaritan," he saia, "gives us oor inspira
tion and our standard. It teaches that
in this world of sin, of sorrow and of toil
what is needed is large-hearted, earnest,
sympathetic work; that wherever tbe rob
ber's hand of oppression, of crime, of in
difference has fallen on the wayfaring
children of men there sho uld be thÂ« sav
ing hand of the earnest, loving child of
God.
"Among tbe various organizations of the
Mission are the men's club, with a mem
bership or fifty-five, through which meal
and lodging tickets are given in return for
labor, and clothing is also distributed ; a
boys' club and boys' choir of twenty-five
voices, and also a women's and girls' de
partment, under tbe management of which
mothers' meetings are held and a monthly
entertainment given. In addition are the
women's guild, the altar and choir guilds
and the women's auxiliary. A clothing
bureau collects clothing from any and
every source.
"Besides there is a ward robe, where cloth
ing is distributed to the absolutely desti
tute. A dispensary, under the manage
ment of four practicing physicians; a
training school which prepares younger
members for the regniar organizations and
a helpers' home, which serves as a home
center for women willing and able to spend
their lives in work among the poor, com
plete the list of organizations of the Mis
sion.
"There now belong to the Mission 450
members, representing eighty-nino fami
lies, besides many who occasionally make
use of the services and rooms. The aver
age attendance each week is 1800 men and
boys.
"The Good Samaritan has so far out
grown its present quarters that a new
buildings or builuings are necessary.
"Already a building fund of nearly $6000
has b< en raised. Ten thousand dollars
more is needed, much of which is at pres
ent practically pledged.
"In cloaing let me impress upon you the
necessity of two things in our workâcon
centration of forces, and at the same time, a
consecration of individual action. Conse
crated actions, consecrated lives, these are
what build up men, nations and churches."

CHURCH FAIRS
FROWNED UPON,
Rev. 0. C. Miller Wishes
Only Voluntary
Offerings.
FOUNDS FAITH MISSIONS.
Evangelical Lutheran Edifice
on Jackson Street the
Latest.
NEW CHAPEL CONSECRATED.
Services Dedicating the Recently
Completed Church of the
Holy Spirit.
"Nothing is a gift to the church that is
the price of anything; hence, we publicly
pronounce against all money-getting by
fairs, festivals, socials, etc., as introducing
worldliness into the church, grieving
away the Spirit, and thus bringing more
losb than train," said liev. Oliver C. Miller,
in the course of his consecration sermon
yesterday forenoon at the Evangelical
Lutheran Churco. of the Holy Spirit.
The edifice being consecrated was the
i neat little chapel at 2127 Jackson street,
j which Rev. O. C. Miller has been instru
| mental in having erected, and the methoa
which he has employed, or, rather, the
method which he has not employed, is
indicated by the excerpt given. Mr. Miller
believes in what he terms the true pente
costal church, and his idea, in part, of
such a church is one from which worldly
features are to the greatest possible extent
eliminated. That is why, when he under
takes to build a church â and he has super
intended the building of many â he frowns
upon the seductive strawberry festival and
the delusive grab-bag. He asks no sup
port but voluntary, free-will offering, and
it was by such contributions that the
Church of the Holy Spirit was madÂ« pos
sible.
The erection and maintenance of this
church is tho more remarkable from the
fact that, though belonging to tne Evan
gelical Lutheran denomination, it has vo
far chosen to remain apart from the synod
with tbe financial advantages to be de
rived therefrom, and start upon its career
of good doing with no support but the
generosity of its members.
The Church of the Holy Spirit was or
! ganized by Mf. Miller in Franklin Hall on
Fillmore street last November. Mr. Miller
is an experienced church organizer, and
since his first charge in Oakiand and Deer
Park, Md., he has strewn his path with
substantial monuments of his energy and
his people's generosity by causing "to be
erected suitable church edifices. These
were almost entirely erected as faith mis
sions, such as tbe Church of the Holy
Spirit, and the pastor's faith has never yet
had cause to raver. Just before coming
here Mr. Miller started a movement for a
new church building at Salem, Va. The
building, which is a substantial structure,
is now nearine completion.
The edifice on Jackson street which was
consecrated yesterday is not a new build
ing, but has been remodeled and reno
vated until both the interior and ex
terior give the impression of newness.
H was formerly used as a school. Its seat
ing capacity iB about 200, and at yester
day's lorenoon service there were no va
cant seats. In recognition of the special
service the ladies had effectively decorated
the interior ol the chapel with beautiful
flowers.
There was a special musical service, and
in addition to congregational singing
Misses Hilda and Lottie Colhson rendered
a duet and each a solo. The pastor's con
secration service was on the theme, "De
spise Ye the Church of God?"
This, he said, is the utterance of Paul, who
s ands next to him who spoke as never man
spake. Tre church at Corinth had strifes, and
it waa spoken in reproof, but it in needful to
day. The church is not intended as an ap
pendage, but a center of life and truth, bo
ciety is either christ-centerlng or chaotic. Our
troubles to-day arise from the fact thut society
Is not centered in and formed about the life of
Jesus. That which injures the body injures
the head also. Tnerefore one cannot despise
Christ's church without despising him.
The speaker then proceeded to analyse
the name of the church, Evangelical Lu
theran, showing, the significance of each
â¢word. Evangelical, he explained, meant
Â£Ohpel, and gospel was power. It was
called Lutheran in the sense that it was
not sectarian.
The church is weak to-day, he declared, be
cause she is cut up in slices. Under the power
of the Holy Kpirlt denominational walls are
bound to crumble. Luther protested Hgalntt a
church being named after him. Though the
name was first used in derision, it to-day
stands for brave protest and courage.
The church is tne body ot Christâ an assem
bly of believers having fellowship with the
Father through the Spirit. It is tbe habita
tion of God built through the Spirit. The idea
is not to join the church, simply, but to join
the life tv Christ's. The church is not a pen
sioner but a benetactress, blessing more than
we can ever return.
Every church is or ought to be the church of
the Holy Spirit. All her machinery without
his power is useless. Under the guidance of
the Spirit the church will not miss its misbion,
whicfi is to save men.
The pastor stated that though the mem
bership was yet small, he had ample rea
son to hope for great thiues in the futur â¢.
The field he believed particularly fertile,
as there was an area of thirteen square
blocks surroundine the chapel in which
there was no church.
BETTER IN THE EAST.
Noticeable Rise in the Price of Thor
oughbred Livestock â How We
Can Make Money.
George A. Wiley, for many years until
lately superintendent of the laruous Seth
Cook ranch near Danville, Contra Costa
County, has returned here after six weeks
in different parts of the East.
Mr. Wiley has for a long time, in addi
tion to superintending the Seth Cook
ranch, been buying and handling thor
oughbred horses and cattle for Japan,
China, Guatemala, Peru and other coun
tries. He is a keen observer and has col
lected much information lately in regard
to farming and livestock that will be read
with interest. He said Inst night at tho
Grand:
"I made a good many short stops in dif
ferent parts of the East, especially in the
prairie titutes. What particularly im
pressed me this year, for I am familiar with
the country and often go East, were the
long lines of corncribs, which were to be
seen in lowa, Illinois and other States of
that region. They have had big crops
there, as well as farther east, and arÂ« in
good shape. The people are prosperous.
They haven't big money, probably, from
the California standpoint, but they have
enough to grease the wheels and keep
things goini; in good shape.
"Then, on top of this the people are con
tented and happy. I was impressed with
the so. id appearance of things. Business
has taken a turn for tbe better. The peo
ple maybe haven't got so much money,
from our California standpoint, but they
know how to use it better.
"They are more economical than our
people and can *et along better on less.
They are not such spendthrifts, if 1 may
use the term. There you see every farmer
butcher his own beef and pork. He uses
salt and smoked meats almost entirely.
When he wants to butcher he gets some of
bis neighbors to help him for a day, and
he kills enough to supply him for the sea
son, and he pays them back by helping
them in like manner. He doesn't buy
anything at the store except coffee, sugar
and a few things like that. All the rest he
produces rulit on his farm.
"Hern our farmers go to the store for
most everything they want. If thore is a
rain in March they conclude too often that
it is going to be a b g year for crops, and
go right off to the store and order things
on that basis. The result is, if there are
no more rains to speak of, the crop may be
short, and the farmer is disappointed anl
can't meet bis debts, maybe, till the next
year.
"If he would only do business as these
farmers in the prairie States do. he would
be on velvet and would make plenty of
money, for the margins here are infinitely
greater. I often think what a snap these
prairie farmers would have if they were in
California, and would raise nice things as
they do there.
"The pr>Â«es for livestock are stiffening
up fast. A year ago you could huy two
year-old tho" oughbred cattle for breeding
purposes at almost your own price. Fifty
dollars each was a good figure. Now you
must pay $100 or f 125.
"The price for good horses has mate
rially udvanced, too. I should say about
double. Scrubs, of course, you can get at
any price, but if you want a Jgood pair of
driving, horses, see how long you will have
to look around before you get them. They
command a great deal more money.
"All these things are a good sign that
business is improving. We are on the eve
of our old-time prosperity. We ou^ht to
be careful, and go along without being to
any way reckless, or making any mistakes,
and we will soon be in good shape. We
want to quit discounting the future and
work conservatively on the basis we
have."
Beat His MothÂ«r-in-Law.
Ex-Policeman Chauncy Johnson was arrested
yesterday on a charge of beating his mother
in-law, Mrs. Bridget O'Counor. Johnson is

THE BEAR FUG
TO FLOUT AGAIN,
Semi-Centennial of Its Rais
ing to Be Observed by-
Native Sons.
ORIGINAL BEAR PARTY.
Three Members Who Live to Ride
on a Float in the
Parade.
BARRACKS STILL STANDING.
Why Ezekiel MÂ°rritt Was Chosen at
His Own Request Captain of
the Party.
On Tuesday next a special meeting of
the committee on the celebration of the
fiftieth anniversary of raising the bear
flag at Sonoma will be held in the office
of the grand secretary of the Native Sons
of the Golden West. The committee con
sists of F. T. Duhring, Henry Lunstedt,
Robert P. Hill, David C. Martin and C. M.
Belshaw. The object of the meeting is to
have the Native Sons take part in the cele
bration of the event, which has been un
der consideration for some time by the
Native Sons of Sonoma and the citizens
of that place who are not native sons.
Mr. Duhring, chairman of the commit
tee of arrangements of Sonoma, was in
this City yesterday with D. D. Davisson,
also a member of the committee, to make
suggestions.
"The people of Sonoma," said Chairman
Duhring, "are anxious to celebrate the
the great event. The Bear Party played
an important part in the history of early
days. We have made arrangements to se
cure from the Society of California Pio
neers the original bear flag â "
"And which," said Mr. Davisson, "was
made from a petticoat that belonged to
the wife of John Sears, one of the original
members of the Bear Flag party."
"The flag," said the chairman resuming,
"will be raised on a pole that stands on
the site of the original one, in one corner
of the nlaza. right near the barracks that
were captured by the party from the Mexi
cans. The old building still stands, but of
course it has been modernized ; still the
walls are there as they were fifty years ago.
The old church of the padres is' still stand
ing near the barracks, but is now a ware
house, and the home of the padres along
side of that is also standing and is now
used by Mr. Davisson as a wine cellar.
"We have not quite completed our plans
for the celebration," said Mr. Davisson,
"but I can say that we have decided on
having a procession, in which we have
reason to believe the Pioneers of San Fran
cisco will take part. We shall have par
lors of Native Sons from different parts of
the county, the militia from Petaluma and
the school children, and we shall also have
a float drawn by six white horses, to be
driven by James Alber'son, who was a
stage-driver for Clark Foss, when he ran a
line of stages across the 'Hog's Back' to
reach the Geysers.
"As to how that float will be arranged
the committee has not yet determined, but
upon it will ride three men who were origi
nal members of the Bear Flag party.
'â¢These are Harvey Potterrield of Napa,
Ben F. Dewell of Sonoma and Henry Bea
son of Mendocino. There is one more,
William Potter of Texas, but we will not
De able to have him at the celebration.
Wiliiam H. Todd was the man who
painted the innocent-looking bear on the
flag, and Ezekiel Merritt was the captain
of the party, he having been chosen for
that position at his own request. And tbe
reason for his request was that he wanted
to be at the head of the party that was to
attack tbe Mexicans, because he and
another man had at one time been tied to
a tree by Don Salvador Vallejo, had been
whipped by him with the flat side of a
sword, and he wanted to show the Mexi
cans that he was a leader.
"The Imtory of the Bear Flag party and
the bear flag has been written, but the
straight story has never been given, so we
will have it written up from reliable data
by R. A Thompson of the Santa Rosa
Democrat. I suppose I have met fifty men
who claim that they were the ones who de
signed the flag â that is, each one claimed
that he designed it."
"Will Wiliiam B. Ide take part in the
celebration?"
"Yes, I know that he claims to have
been the leader of tho movement, but that
is not so; he did not have any thing to do
with the original movement. No, he will
not have anything to do with the matter
so iar as we are concerned.
"We expect to have 10,000 people in our
town on the day of the celebration, the
13tli of June. There was some talk of con
tinuing it for two days, but it is doubtful
if tbe town can accommodate the number
of people who will visit us. We have
made arrangements with the railroad to
convey people to our place and home
again for a one-way fare, and, as to Santa
Rosa, the round-trip fare will be but $L"
The Civic Federation.
At a meeting of the executive committee ot

mittee whs appointed to frame certain bills to
be presented to the next Legislature, and the
matter ol organizing every precinct in the

until a subsequent meeting.

The Grand Lodge at its last meeting amended
section 16. subordinate- lodge constitu ion, relating
to the election of officers, so as to make the cleri
cal officers who are usually elected In November
elective in May. The grand master workman has
held that as tbe present officers were elected in
November last for one year their terms can
not be shortened: in November, when the usual
time for election comes, there will be no constitu
tional provision for election of clerical officers,
hence the election of these officers will not take
place until May, 1897. The effect of this legisla
tion Is to lengthen the terms of the incumbents,
who will serve for eighteen months instead of
twelve months. The above has no application to
officers other than recorder, receiver, financier and
medical examiner.

MUSIC'S CHARMS,
Thousands of People Are
Attracted by One
Band.
MUST HAVE AMUSEMENT
Live People Have Proved That
They Will Not Remain in
a Necropolis.
A PROBLEM PARTLY SOLVED.
Rev. Edwards Davis Not After the
Dollarâ Need of Gare With
Religious Armies.
Oaklajtd Office Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 24. )
The merchants of this city have been
for years trying to solve a problem, and
they partially succeeded last night. For
many years it has been conceded that not
less than 520,000 of Oaklanders' money is
spent in San Francisco for legitimate
amusement purposes only. Probably tha
amount is ereater; certainly it is no
Bmaller. This practice not only tends to
rob local merchants of what they consider
their just trade, but it also puts into the
hands of the railroad company for ferry
and car fares a small fortune. To keep
this money at home has long been the de
sire of Oakland merchants, because they
realize if they can keep people at home on
one proposition they can in all others.
So accustomed have been the merchants
to the old state of affairs that they well
nigh regarded it as their unconquerable
fate. They expected the city to represent
a necropolis after dark, and their expecta
tions were beautifully gratified. Nothing
has been done to change this state of
affairs, and year by year the result has be
come more marked.
Last night the neighborhood of the City
Hall was thronged with people till nearly
midnight. At 10 o'clock, the usual hour
on Saturday nis;ht for Oakland to die, some
of the sidewalks were impassable. There
were more people in the stores and more
business was done. Everybody was sur
prised to see everybody else on the streets
instead of having gone to San Francisco or
to bed. And all this was due to a pro
gressive move on the part of the Mer
chants' Exchange.
The members of the exchange recently
decided to try an experiment. They en
gaged a regimental band to give a concert
in the City Hall park. The effect was
magical, and the great danger now ia that
the City Council may pass some more
broad-minded "keep off the grass" ordi
nance because some of the crowd over
stepped the edges of the sidewalk.
Now is the time for the merchants and
capitalists to do some practical thinking.
If a band will attract a thousand people,
then two bands will attract two thousand
people, and the introduction of amuse
ments enough to gratify the varied tastes
of the masses will solve the whole diffi
culty against which the merchants are
now contending. Oakland is, of course,
the natural center of Aiameda County. It
contains the only first-class theater in the
county, which is open on an average but
two nights a week; it also contains the
only cheap theater, which is in a building
that ought long ago to have been suc
ceeded by a handsome modern structure.
Walter Morosco wanted to have a the
ater in a building that is soon to be erected,
but the owner did not think proper to
consent. There is but one way to keep
people and their money at home and that
is by offering them what they can get else
where. They will not remain in Oakland
for the purpose of keeping company with
the sidewalks.
Instead of devoting nearly the whole
of its energies to 10-cent license
quarrels the great body of mer
chants should begin at the other end.
It has been very clearly proven that the
attacks on San Francisco merchants are
circumvented at every turn. Now the
fight should be made from the other end,
and instead of fighting the merchants
should enter the field, at present unfilled
so far as Oakland is concerned, and do a
little building up.
The Board of Trade has just been re
organized and is now prepared for work.
It can do no better for thÂ« present than to
co-operate with the Merchants' Exchange
and go to work and see that the City is
supplied with a first-class family amuse
ment house. It would be filled nightly
with a crowd from all over the county.
The crowd will never come till the attrac
tion is here, and until it is merchants and
ethers will see their streets deserted in
favor of the larger City, for it is a well
known fact that legitimate business and
legitimate amusement go hand in hand.
Rev. Edwards Davis may justly be re
garded as a new minister. Since he first
occupied the pulpit at the Central Chris
tian Church in this city he has been crit
icized in a variety of ways. His dramatic
sermons were an innovation and several
other of his efforts struck orthodox Oak
land as being strangely out of place. At
times many unkind things have been said
about him and the methods he used, but
tie has now outlived them ana Is growing
in popularity, while his church is also in
creasing largely every month. His de
clination of the offer of a San Francisco
church at a greatly increased salary has
proved that he is sincere, and that the old
story of a call from a rich church being
always "a call from the Lord" is not in
variably true.
Mr. Davis is still a very young man, but
he will certainly add to his successes. He
has proved that the almighty dollar is not
his deity, and having done that is entitled
to the best tbat the world theological can
offer.
During the past two weeks this city bas
been visited by men who claim to be the
forerunners of new religious "armies."
Oakland has always been looked upon as
a legitimate and lucrative field for irre
sponsible religionists, and more so-called
evangelistic work is done here than in any
other city of its size. Gospel tents, gospel
halls and gospel missions are located all
over the city and so long as they are not
run on solicited subscriptions they are not
(subjects of investigation.
When, however, they are represented aB
organized bodies and a systematic canvass
for funds is made curiosi.y is excited as to
the validity of the claim. During the past
week collectors of the "Gospel Army" and j
"Jesus Army" and not many weeks ago of
the "Army of Heaven at Hand," were out
and merchants are anxious for credentials,
which are not forthcoming. Since the
success of General Booth's army any re
ligious movement with the military appel
lation commands respect A Broadway
merchant said this week that the majority
of the subscribers are under the impression
that they are subscribing to the original
Salvation Army. In one case a solicitor
wearing the well-known blue uniform was
arrested for obtaining money under false
pretenses, but he proved that he was col
lecting for an "army" of his own, known
as the "Gospel Army," and was released.
Ckne "army" has as much claim to sup-
port as any other, provided it is honestly
run and has an actual existence. So far
as Oakland is concerned there is no "Gos
pel army," no "Jeeus' army" and no
"Heaven at Hand army" at the present
time, nor has there ever been, and the
charitably inclined should be very circum
spect in the manner in which they hand
out alms. 8. W. B.
PLAYING FIREMAN.
rhe Usual Weekly Fire Drill Creates
a Good Deal of Excite
ment.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 24.â Some excite
ment was caused this morning on Wash
ington street while Chief Fair was drilling
several companies on the Brunswick Hotel
block.
There is a stand-pipe at the hotel, and
the Chief gave orders to test it. Contrary
to custom there was an unusual pressure
In the pipe, and when the water was
turned on the fun commenced. The pow
erful stream flew in all directions, knocked
a fireman down a basement, scattered
horses and pedestrians, and it was given
out that a very sericas accident had hap
pened.
"There was nothing serious at all," said
Chief Fair to-nieht. "I want the men to
become acquainted with the working of
the stand-pipes and hydrants in all the
big buildings in the city, and I worked on
the Brunswick this morning. Nobody was
hurt, although there was a little excite
ment when the full force of the water was
felt. Altogether we had a tir=t-class drill. 1 '
ALAMEDA'S FLORAL FETE

and F. E. Graham. Every bicycle must
carry at least five lighted lanterns.
Populists Meet.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 24.â The Aia
meda Populist Club met last nicht in G.
A. R. Hall, the president, W. Davis in the
chair. The subject for discussion was
"The bounty given by free-coin ajre coun
tries to their producers, and whether the
same operates as an embargo upon Ameri
can produce." N. J. Manson led, followed
by Dr. Taft and others. The opinion ob
tained that there should be free coinage
of silver in this country and that the only
way of protecting American producers was
by opening the mints to the free coinage
of silver.

FIREPROOF BUILDINGS,
School Director Murdock In Favor
of Using Them for the
Public Schools.
Ventilation and Physical Culture Are
Important Needs of the Educa
tional Department.
C. A. Murdock, chairman of the Classi
fication Committee, said to a Call re
porter yesterday tbat he was in favor of
extending the physical culture course by
the employment of an additional teacher
if the condition of the funds during the
next fiscal year should warrant it.
He added that he regarded physical cul
ture as one of the most important branches
in the public school curriculum, and that
he was heartily in favor of extending it.
Ventilation was another important mat
ter and fireproof buildings another in his
estimation.
"There is now a proposition before the
board," he said, "to erect a twelve-room
schoolhouse on Bernal Heights. It is
likely that instead of altering or rebuild
ing the board will put up a fireproof struc
ture."
In reply to the question as to whether
there would be much difference in the
cost, Mr. Murdock said that a brick build
ing plainly built would be only a little
more expensive than one of wood. He
was of the opinion that wooden buildings
were behind the age and that the safety
of the children demanded fireproof struc
tures.

LOSS OF LOCAL TRADE.
Berkeley's Butchers and Bakers
May Have to Pay Heavier
Taxes.
LECTURES TO DAIRYMEN.
Professors Woodworth and Jaffa to
Lecture at Eureka and Arcata
Next Month.
BERKELEY, Cal , May 24.â The ques
tion of solicitors' licenses and how they
may be adjusted so as to subserve the
best interests of both the solicitors them
selves and the town of Berkeley is now re
volving itself in the minds of the members
of the Town Board. As matters stand the
license of local solicitors being $10 a quar
ter, other vendors from Oakland and Ala
meda, in which places the licenses are $100
and $120 a quarter respectively, may come
to Berkeley, pay their license and dispose
of their goods ab a handsome profit.
At the same time the local resident so
licitor is running behind because of the
heavy competition.
One of the first matters to be taken up
by the new Merchants' Protective Associa
tion when it is organized will be the ques
tion of increasing the solicitors' licenses
with the hope of keeping within the lim
its of Berkeley a considerable portion of
the trade that now goes to Oakland.
S. H. Taylor, a member of the by-laws
committee of the association about to be
formed, has called the attention of the
members to the matter and suggested that
the Town Trustees be asked to raise the
tax to a sum similar to that charged in
Aiameda, which is practically prohibitory.
Mr. Taylor said: "A large number of
Oakland grocers and butchers do a thriv
ing business in Berkeley. In reality, such
business should all remain at home. Ala
meda's stores cet all the Aiameda trade
because that city has imposed a solicitor's
tax that makes it unprofitable for outside
firms to attempt to enter the home field."
Trustee Cripps of the Town Board does
not think that Berkeley merchants are be
ing materially injured by the Oakland
competition. "The present license tax tor
peddlers and solicitors, 1 ' said he, "is $10
per quarter, which is quite a heavy in
crease over the insignificant tax our own
storekeepers have to pay. The point
raised is worthy of consideration, but at
first thought I should consider that the
tax is high enough. If we find that fol
lowing Alameda's t>lan will do us any
good we had better take it up."
Will Address the Dairymen.
BEKKELEY, Cal., May 24.â Professor
Jaffa and Professor Woodworth of ths de
partment of agriculture of the State Uni
versity are preparing for a number of lec
tures to be given before the Association of
Dairymen at Eureka and Arcata about the
middle of June.
"We would like to send more men up to
the meetine," said Professor Hilgard yes
terday, "but our 'traveling expenses fund'
has nearly run out, and we cannot branch
out very "extensively until alter the next
annual budget of the Board of Kegents
has been made out.
"The plan of Recent Reinstein to have
fifty meetings held during the coming
year at various points throughout the
State with the view of bringing the popu
lation of the rural districts and the State
University into more close and more
friendly relationship is an excellent one.
He estimates that the cost of these meet
ings to the State will be about ?3. r >oo. The
money, if devoted to that purpose, will be
well spent I am sure, because of the fact
that the Agricultural Department and its
rural constituents are not in such close
touch as is conducive to the highest good
of both. It is proposed that at these
meetings, or at least at many of them, the
president will be present, and thus to add
to their importance. We have more invi
tations to attend and addre.-s farmers' in
stitutes than we can possibly accept be
cause of the shortage of funds.
"Several years ago we had an annual
appropriation of $1000 to be expended in
visiting the country districts; year before
last we had $500, and last year we were
allowed $300. You see what a difference
will be made if we can get $.5300 for this
same purpose. lam awaiting with anx
iety the report of the board as to their
budget for 1896-D7, which will be made out
at their meeting on Tuesday."

ANY DAY FOR A SABBATH
No Warrant at This Time for
Keeping the Seventh Day
Holy.
Rev. James Small Somewhat Surprises
His Congregation by His
Admissions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 24. J
Some unusual admissions regarding the
sacred law that is generally supposed to
govern the observance of the Sabbath
were made this morning by Rev. James
Small of the First Christian Church. His
address on "Christianity's Day of Rest"
was listened to by a large audience.
The preacher said in part: "The old
seventh-day Sabbath was Jewish and had
been abolished for Jew and Gentilo. It
was meant only for the Jews, and every
thing Jewish has been done away with.
Truth and absolute right can never
be abolished, and all that there
was in the law of Moses of this na
ture we have in the gospel. We are under
no obligation to do anything because it
was in the law of Mos*s. And yet what
ever t here was in the law right in itself,
morally right, right even long before the
law of Moses was given, and not made
right by being put there, is, of course,
obligatory upon Christians, but not be
cause it was contained in the law of
Moses. Christ is on his throne, and we
should hear him and not Moses. T.'iis is
saying only what Paul said, Hebrews l:i,
'In the last days God has spoken unto us
by his Son.'
"Taking the whole history of the church
into view in all parts of the world, under
every variety of political rule and every
ecclesiastical arrangement, it may be
safely said that any law tnat could have
been framed, must have been oftener
broken than kept. It was the highest
wisdom, therefore, upon the part of God
to leave it just as it was left, with the types
and the facts pointing to the day with
divine significance, with every prompting
of a redeemed soul, hallowing the day as
divinely precious with apostolic teaching
and example guiding Christians to keep it
with sacred rejoicing, and yet so un
trammeleu by statute or enactment tbat if
circumstances forbid the observance of it,
there ia no dishonor paid to diviue author
ity by the failure to keep it. Yet,
if any man in full view of these
considerations, pleads the absence of
positive law, and not only outrages the
public sentiment of Christian communi
ties, but the best promptings of gratitude
in his own heart, and the best yearning of
his nature for spiritual culture by devoting
this day to secular toils, he is simply un
worthy to be the Lord's free man. He
must learn not to use his liberty to his
own injury or to ttie injury of others. We
have no command to keen the Fourth day
of July and make it a -day wherein the
citizens of t >c States can shout for old
glory and yet their gratitude and patriot
ism is seen more in the fact in the absence
of statute or enactment; so our loyalty to
our Lord and master is seen in keeping it
by the early example. Authorized exam
ple is equal to precept or command in
Christianity. This is the day the Lord has
made. Let us be glad and rejoice in It.
"To be fair, however, there is no com
mand to keep the first day of the week.
There is no positive enactment upon the
subject. But this only shows the wisdom
of God. And it shows, too, the elastic
and universal element that is in Chris
tianity that forever adapts it to the great
onward march of humanity. And the
man who denies this elasticity holds in
lÂ»is hand the dagger that to-day is piercing
Christianity. The Christian must never
admit that the world can outgrow the
gospel.
"For, had the first day of the week been
established by positive enactment as a day
of rest and worship and the manner of its
observance been decreed among the
myriads of the poor, the bond and bread
winners and busy men generally who
have accepted the Christ in this age of
activity, the law must have been broken
continually."
Young Opens Hll Mission.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 23. â Steward
Young of Fruitvale messianic fame opened
his public meetings to-day at Thona's
Hall. There was a very small attendance,
not over twenty people being in the hall.
Mrs. Lasher was not there. Young spent
a greater portion of his time paying his re
spects to those who exposed him. He de
clared he has ample grounds for libel cases
that would make him a rich man, but the
satisfaction of knowing that the Lord led
him was sufficient.
Chaplain Edniondgon Preaches.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 24.â Chaplain
W. E. Edmondson of the United States
flagship Philadelphia preached at the As
bury M. E. Church South to-nieht. The
local companies of militia turned out and
attended church in full uniform to hear
the chaplain. He preached %very inter
esting discourse on the practical possibili
ties of blending patriotism and religion.
Died Without a Doctor.
OAKLAND, Cau, May 24.â Mrs. Victor
Sophia Darche v.as found dead in her bed
last night in Berkeley. The deceased was
67 years old and had been ill but four
days. Her friends recommended that she
see a doctor, but she persistently refused,
and so the Coroner will hold an autopsy
and inquest.
REALTY MARKET REVIEW
Decrease in Amount of Build
ing Contracts Filed
in May.
WOOLEN-MILLS AT AUCTION.
The Market Generally Is QuietâRe
view of the Records for
the Week.
The principal transaction last week was the
auction sale of the San Francisco Gaslight
Company's property. It Is reported that a
majority of the purchasers of these lots Intend
to Improve the same, but their plans in this
direction have not in any instance assumed a
sufficiently definite shape to make It possible
to more than generalize as to the character
and extent of such improvements.
The prices obtained for the property were not
high, yet, as In the case of nearly all sales
made now, theprices were thought to be "good,
considering the present condition of the mar
ket." Properly mterDreted, this expression
means that the present market is a low one,
one where rock-bottom prices prevail and one
upon which property sells strictly upon its
merits and Its present earning capacity. A
market like this is one where it is safe to make
investments; but it seems that this fact is not
appreciated to any great extent, judging from
the volume of business being transacted.
Bunding operations are considerably lighter
thus lar this month than last, taking as a
criterion the number and amount of recorded
contracts. By tome this falling off is attributed
to a fear on the part of those who contemplated
building of possible strikes in the building
trades. Activity in building has a correspond
ing effect as a rule on the real estate market,
and it is possible that the present quiet that
prevails this month In the real estate market
has been brought about to some extent by the
falling off in building operations.

promoted to the rank of colonel to take el-
Feet June 5, upon which date Colonel H.
W. Closson of Washington barracks goes
on the retired list. Colonel Guenther has
been granted a four months' leave of ab
sence. At the expiration of that time he
will take command at Washington bar
racks.
Colonel David Gordon of the Sixth Cav
alry, who will be retired in a few days,
will make his home on Georgetown
Heights, Washington, D. C. He is well
known on the Pacific Coast.
Captain Benjamin K. Roberts, Battery
A, Fifth Artillery, ison duty again at the
Presidio. During bis leave of absence he
visited Bohemia and studied problems of
life.
The promise of further extensive im
provements at the Presidio is about to be
f uliilled. The contract for a vast quantity
of grading to fill the marsh has been
awarded to John W. Murphy of Modesto.
He was found to be the lowest responsible
bidder when the proposals were opened a
few days ago. Since then Colonel A. S.
Kimball, chief quartermaster of the de
partment, has been advised by wire from
Washington to award tne contract to Mr.
Murphy, hence work on a large scale will
soon begin.
The quartermaster-general has also wired
acceptance of Silas Carle's bid for con
structing the new stables at the Presidio.
Mr. Carle is a Sacramento contractor, and
is preparing to carry out his new contract
without delay.
The foregoing work is to be paid for from
funds of the fiscal year which ends June
30. The allotment of the new appropria
tion for the next fiscal year will be made
early In July, and with the additional
money available other important improve
ments at the Presidio will be authorized.

DR. BROWN AGAIN.
The Depoied Minister Preaches in Odd
Fellows' Hall.
Dr. C. O. Brown preached yesterday
morning and evening to a congregation in
Odd Fellows' Hall. The services were
notable from the fact that they were the
first which the reverend doctor held before
his new charge since his ejectment from
the First Congregational pulpit.
Dr. Brown stated that the Sabbath
school, prayer meeting, Christian En
deavor and Ladies' Aid Society of the
"organization" would meet in Golden Gata
Hall, 625 Sutter street, but he did not men
tion the future meeting-place of the new
church. Until a more suitable place ii
found services will probably be neld in
Golden Gate Hal).
After the singing of the hymn "My Faith
Looks Up to Thee" Dr. Brown preached
from the following words of Jesus in
answer to Pilate when that Roman asked
the .Savior if he was a King:
"Thou sayest that lam a King. To this
end was I born, and for this cause came I
into the world, that I should bear witness
of the truth."
In the evening Dr. Brown held memo
rial services, and preached from the sub
ject of the "Heroic Dead."

CRICKET IN THE HOT SUN,
The Californias Were Defeated
by the Bohemians Yes
terday.
Heavy S'ogging Was the Feature of
the Mateh â A Practice Day at
the Aiameda Ground.
Tbe single-cup encket match played
yesterday at Golden Gate between the Bo
hemians and Californias resulted in a vic
tory for the former team by 51 runs.
It was an ideal day for the game and the
pretty ground was liberally sprinkled with
spectators.
Captain Robertson of the Bohemians
won the toss and went in. He and Bow
hill made the ilrst stand, scoring 32 and 2
runs respectively.
West, Grannan and Cookson each did
effective work for the side, which was
finally disposed of for 124 runs. Outside
of some hard bitting the feature of the
inning was the fielding of Brooks, who?e'
catches of Bowhill and Reevesâparticu
larly the former â were superb.
The Californias led off badly. Brooks,
an ex-Pacinc man, put up a very credita
ble 27. but only Guild and Townsley were
able lo follow him into double figures. The
bowline of Robertson and Pollock was all
too deadly, and the team fell lor 73 runs,
leaving their opuonents virtual victors by
half a century.
There was just time enough left for the
Bohemians to enjoy a second inning. It
resulted in a total of 175, most of which
was composed of boundary hits. The chief
contributors to the score were: Robertson,
who carried his bat for 54, Smith 39, liow
hill 32 and Martin 27 runs.
Following is the full score:

"KNOWLEDGE 13 POWER."
Therefore consult the great clairvoyants, -
PROFS. EUGENE AND VAN DE VERB,
1728 MARKET ST.
Their reading astonish the most skeptical. All
are satisfied. The professors give advice on all
matters that are of interest to humanity. Busi-
ness, speculation, investments, insurance, love,
courtship, 'marringe and divorce; settle lovers'
quarrels and cause speedy and happy marriages.
They locate mines and buried treasures, find lost
or stolen property, interpret dreams, cure bad
habits and destroy evil influences In half the
time required by the best of the other mediums.
Remember, there are but few mediums in the
world that can work these wonders, and none out-
side of the eminent professors in San Francisco.
Remember also that the professors are perma-
nently located in San Francisco: they are here to
stay. Hours 10 a. v.. to 8 c. M. Sundays 2 to 6p. x.

Â«N TWO CITY CHURCHES.
Paulist Father Clark Welcomes
the Boys in Blue to St
Mary's,
REV. DR. CRUZAN AT PLYMOUTH
The Folds of Old Glory Hung Over the
Altar While a Snaredrum Served
as a Pulpit Desk.
An American flag, lustrous under the
incandescent lights with the rich sheen of
silk and the flashing of gold bullion, with
etaff reared aloft and its bright folds wav
ing, was carried down the middle aisle of
St. Mary's Church last night by the color
Bergeant of Lincoln Post, George H. Rob
erts, a black man, whom the grand army
of the American republic saved from
slavery thirty-five years ago.
Behind him marched the grizzled mem
bers of the post, under command of H. W.
Mortimer. Then came Garfield Post, R. R.
Eilgore commander; Cass Post, John
O'Neil commander; Meade Post, John F.
Goggin commander, and Liberty Post,
William N. Park commander. They filed
up close to the altar rail and occupied the
front pews on each side of the aisle.
After them came the Women's Relief
Corps, consisting of Meade Corps, Mrs.
Bessie Johnson, president; Lincoln Corps,
Miss Lillie Milne, president; Garfield
Corps, Mrs. Addie Ballon, president, and
Seven Pines Circle, Miss Pauline Willis,
president.
The occasion was a memorable one, be
ing the first time that posts of the Grand
Army of the Republic have held memorial
services in a Catholic church. The church
selected was one conducted by the Paulist
Fathers, a Roman Catholic religious order
composed exclusively of natives of the
United States, and embracing among its
priests many prominent converts from
Protestantism. The interior of the edi
fice was most profusely decorated with the
American flag and National colors.
Two silken flags, rich with glinting bul
lion and bearing the eagle of the republic
at the head of the staff, were displayed at
the ends of the large marble altar. Back
of this and the two other altars the wall
was draped with the Mag for which the
Grand Army Veterans fought and suffered
more than a quarter of a century ago. In
front of the altars, high above the altar
rail, between two parallel wires, one above
the other, and extending lrom one gallery
to the other, were the letters in gilt card
board :
â¢ IN MEMOKY OF OUR DEAD HEROES :
The organ loft was crowded with women
singers and the music was more than ordi
narily impressive. There was also an
orchestra composed of the following: Miss
Chloe Devlin, violin; Miss Marie Gior
giana, organ ; Miss Marie Dillon, harp, and
the Misses May Mugan, Kate Gadsby, S.
Drathman, G. Drathman, F. Butler, M.
Butler, If. Johnson, N. Johnson and Mrs.
Hampton. Miss Devlin played a violin
solo, and was followed by Violinist Herr
August Hinrichs, who played a romanza
by Svendsen very sweetly, very tenderly
and very religiously.
The soprano soloists were Mrs. W. Nu
nan and Miss Lottie Crawford. The con
tralto voices were Mesdames George S.
McComb and D. Silva. Mrs. McComb's
sweet and mellow contralto had a fine op
portunity of being displayed in the hymn
"Regina Coeli," and the opportunity was
not lost.
The remainder of the solo singers were
J. Sieberthal and James Lane tenors and
W. Gordon and Frank Meagher bassos.
The sermon was preached by Rev. Father
Clark, who very appropriately used a snare
drum on top ot the pulpit for a desk. The
drum was fastened to the staff of a silk
flag which depended from the front of the
pulpit.
Father Clark is the grandson of one of
the American Revolutionary heroes of
1776, and feelingly mentioned that fact
when bidding the old Boldiers welcome to
worship with him at the same altar. He
spoke eloquently of the duty of the citizen,
both to his God and his country, and
pointed out what he believed to be the
Biost serious dangers that threaten the
Republic â the immorality of the press, the
avarice of rich men, the divorce laws and
the warping of marriage from its true and
natural design.
The most impiessivu part of the service
was the elevation of the host before the
kneeling congregation, the altar lights
twinkling like stars behind the clouds of
incense. It was the smoke of battle, not
where men are slain, as at Gettysburg,
Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain and Bull
Run, bat where sins are slain with the
sweet incense of prayer and the rain of
repentent tears.

shiped at Plymouth Congregational
Church last evening. About 125 of the
veterans occupied seats in the body of the
anditorium and the services were con
ducted by Rev. J. A. Cruzan, chaplain of
the G. A. R., Department of California and
Nevada. A number of choice selections
were rendered by the choir of Plymouth
Church, and Seldon Bturgis, chaplain of
George H. Thomas Post, made the open
ing prayer.
The chaplain's address was from the
text: "How Are the Mighty Fallen and
the Weapons of War Perish." He recited
in eulocium the characteristics which
marked the Union soldiers in whose honor
the institution of Memorial day was ob
served. His remarks were mainly ad
dressed to the younger generation which
had arisen since the stirring events of the
Civil War. He represented the Union
soldier as the grandest man that ever wore
a uniform. After extolling the high de
gree of courage evinced by these men on
the field, in the priton and in the hospital,
he said:
They were also men of a higher and nobler
character even than that. They were self
sacrificing. Tney freely gave themselves for
their country. Because they were such grand
men who did such erand work, we old soldiers
who marched with them and fought with
them ast you, a younger generation, to honor
them. Comrades of the George H. Thomas
Corps.it is our duty to impress upon this
rising generation how much tney owe to these
men. Memorial day should bo recognized not
as a holiday but as a holy day. Wherever
there are soldiers' graves the citizens should
march out to them, and by strewing flowers
upon them should say, "How are the mighty
fallen." In '65 the Nation counted thesp men
as worthy of all honor, and they are just as
worthy ol honor to-day in '9(5 as they were
in '65.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1896.
PENTECOST DAY
COMMEMORATED,
Solemn Services Held in
the Catholic
Churches.
THE CHURCH'S BIRTHDAY
Archbishop Riordan Preaches on
the Descent of the Holy
Spirit
MANY CHILDREN CONFIRMED.
Beautiful Spectacle at St Mary's Cathe
dral After the Solemn High
Mass.
Pentecost Sunday, the anniversary of
the great day when tongues of fire de
scended upon Christ's apostles in the
upper chamber in Jerusalem, came yester
day. All over the world the festival was
celebrated by the Catholic church with
becoming ceremonies, and in this City
there wa3 no exception to the rule. At
the late masses the services were solemn.
Altars were decorated profusely with dow
ers in honor of the day.
At St. Mary's Cathedral a solemn high
mass was celebrated by Rev. Father Har
rigan, who was assisted in hiÂ» office by
Father Ramm as deacon and Father
Dempsey as sub-deacon. Father Mulligan
was master of ceremonies. Under the
direction of Professor Harrison, organist
of the cathedral, Haydn's Third Mass was
sung.
Much thought had been given the
decoration of the chancel and altars. The
sanctuary was a bower of wonderful
beauty and effective contrasts. Palms and
ferns and red flowers made a gorgeous
color effect that was heightened by the
gilt candelabra, clusters of blazing candles
and the white marble altars.
Immediately after mass the archbishop
administered the sacrament of confirma
tion to 300 boyÃ and girl*.
He delivered a sermon on the indwell
ing of the holy spirit, telling his attentive
audience that men were the temples of ihe
Holy Ghost. The scene of the sensible
form of mighty winds when tongues of
fire descended upon the apostles was de
scribed.
This event marked the birthday of the
church. The whole church was assembled
there In the 120 in the upper temple. His
Grace said that the church had not only a
body but a spirit also. This spirit wan in
each mem her. "If any man will Keep my
word we will come unto him and tnke up
our abode in him." This was not only for
one place or one person, but for the whole
church. The upper chamber was the
great cathedral of Christianity.
In conclusion his Grace declared that
men must not only be born again in water
and the Holy Ghost, but must receive
him directly in the holy sacrament of con
firmation. He asked all to pray to the
Holy Ghost against temptations.
The confirmation service was a really
beautiful spectacle. There were nearly
200 girls all dressed in white, pictures of
youthful innocence and purity.
They wore white veils and delicate
wreaths, while their hair was tied with
white satin ribbons. As ttiey passed down
the aisled and knelt before the grand hi 'h
altar, with its play of color and its bril
liancy, where the Archbishop, attended by
prieÂ«ts and surrounded by acolytes in pur
ple, stood wailing to anoint them, an im
pressive sicht was witnessed.
These little girls seemed like so many

brides, and such indeed they were, being
wedded to their holy faith, in which
through the sacrament they became strong
and perfect. The boys were in black, with
white satin bows on their arms and white
gloves on their hands.
During the service the choir sang Him
mel's "Veni Creator." Very Rev. J. J.

NO BLANTHER.
The Police Have Absolutely No Idea
How to Catch the Supposed
Murderer.
Captain Lees and his detectives have
been hard at work for twenty-four hours
i-tamping circulars descriptive of J. E.
Bianther who is wanted for the murder of
.Mrs. Philipena Langfeldt over one week
ajro.
The circulars are nearly all made outu t in
Spanish and the $1000 reward offered by
Governor Budd for the capture and con
viction of the murderer is made a promi
nent feature.
The Spanish circulars are the same as
were distributed by post throughout this
State and Texas and they bear a reproduc
tion of the most recent photograph of
Bianther, published three days ago in The
Call. j
Excepting a few letters received by Cap
tain Lees yesterday from enthusiastic
Sheriffs and Constables in different parts
of the State 3aying they believed some one

SWALLOWED LAUDUNUM
Mi - F. Lively of Sacramento Having
Nothing to I.i w> for Attempts to
Commit Suicide.
Mrs. F. Lively, about 30 years of age, at
tempted to commit suicide yesterday
morning by swallowing an ounce of
laudanum.
She came from Sacramento Saturday
night and engaged room 8 in the lodging
house, 921 Market street. Shortly after 7
o'clock yesterday morning she went to
the landfady's room and asked for a spoon
to take some medicine as she was suffer
ing from neuralgia. Hhe tot the spoon
and in a few minutes opened the door of
the landlady's room and threvy the spoon
inside remarking, "Excuse me, but I am
through."
About 11 o'clock the landlady bad occa
sion to go into Mrs. Lively's room and
found her in bed unconscious and breath
ing heavily. She notified the Receiving
Hospital and Mrs. Lively was taken there
in the ambulance. The usual remedies
were applied and she regained conscious
ness. Two "trusties" from the City
Prison kept her from sleeping till all dau
ger seemed to be past.
Mrs. Lively said she had been deserted
some time ago by her husband, who was
an employe of the Southern Pacific Com
pany in Sacramento, because he had got
tired of her. She had nothing to live for
and thought she would come here and
commit suicide. She paid $4 for the
week's rent of her room and was left with
25 cents.

crawled around her father's bakery yester
day and picked up a few pieces of bread
upon which some rough-on-rats had been

The mother immediately administered
empties and the child was soon relieved.
Fearing, however, that the child might be
in further danger, the mother conveyed it
to the City Recoiving Hospital, where it
was found the child was in no danger.

THIS BOY IS A MECHANIC
George H. Woodbury, at Six
teen Years, Builds a
Launch.
His Strange, Bright Light Causes
Policemen to Prohibit Him From
Wheeling at Night.
George H. Woodbury, the 16-year-old
son of George E. Woodbury, manufact
urer of ore concentrators at 141 and 143
First street, has just performed a feat of
mechanical skill that would do credit to
one many years his senior.
It is not every boy that can design and
put up a boiler and engine complete in
all its workings and capable of propelling
a boat through the water from twelve to
fifteen miles an hour. This is what the
lad has accomplished.
Ever since he was able to know any
thing about machinery his whole time has
been devoted to it.
lie is at present a student at Anderson's
PreDaratory school at Sixteenth and
Guerrero htreets, preparing himself to
take the mining and civil engineering
course at the State University.
The boiler he has just constructed is of
the wat#r-tube pattern and generates a
pressure of 300 pounds of steam to the
square inch. The tubing of the boiler is
1 inch in diameter, thus allowing this high
pressure.
llPetroleum is used as a fuel, and when
the machinery is in motion it is run on
the surae principle as a naphtha engine,
large tanks of petroleum being stored in
lockers on each sice of the boat.
The engines are double and of the ver
tical fore-and-aft componnd type designed
to turn from 400 to <iOO revolutions a
minute and capable of developing from
?>0 to 60 horsepower, running with a 200
-pound pressure of steam.
Young Woodbury is thoroughly con
versant with all the workings of an en
trine, and can run one as intelligently as a
licensed engineer. He is now putting his
machinery into a launch which he had
built by George \V. Kneass. He expects
when everything is in working order that
the boat will beat anything of her size on
the bay. fche is 23 'feet Ion?, 4 feet beam
and 4 feet 6 inches deep, and is called the
Allegre. She is now lying at Long Bridge.
In addition to building engines and
boilers the boy is somewhat of _an in
ventor, and has got up an electric light for
a bicycle that can be out into successful
operation.
He has ridden with this contrivance at
tached to his own bike up Golden Gate
avenue several times, but every time he
appeared on the avenue the police invari
aoly drove him off, as the light resembled
a miniature lighthouse coming alone and
caused too many runaways.
The light would burn very steadily tor
six hours and throw its rays ahead of the
wheel for about fifteen feet.
On the two front forkb of tue machine
are placed large tubes tilled with oxygen.
On the handle-bars is another tube Died
with ether, and between the crossbars is
arranged a neat little battery. Wires con
nect with the oxygen tubes and the ether
and when in motion the wheel generates

"It is my natural bent to cultivate a
liking for machinery," said young Wood
bury yesterday. "My father followed a
machinist's vocation* and I naturally in
herit it from him. I built my engine 'and
boiler after school hours at my father's
shop and outside of a little help from some
of the men employed there everything is
of my own ciosign and construction. I

REV. FATHER RAMM.
He Tells St. Mary's Cathedral's Coi
gregation Why He Is a
Catholic.
There was a veiy large congregation in
St. Mary's Cathedral last night to listen .to
the Key. Father Ramm preach upon the
text "Why I am a Catholic."
In this the reverend father gave an in
teresting account of his bent for the clergy
and of his researches for the divine truth.
He dwelt at length upon the teachings of
the Episcopal church and reviewed the
teachings of the Church of England. He
then told of the Catholic church and
stated that it had always been the true ex
pounder of the word of God and that it
was the church that had never contradicted
itself, its belief being to-day what it was in
the first century of its existence; and it
was because he found it to be the true
church that he was a Catholic.
LADIES' AUXILIARY A. O. H.
.Mjirthu Washington Circle Xo. 1 Organ-
ized Yesterday.
Sunday afternoon, at Hibernia Hall, 120
Ninth street, there was a large attendance
of ladies to organize the first branch of the
Ladies' Auxiliary Ancient Order of Hiber
nians in the State.
In the East the Ladies' Auxiliary is a
very large body. It is organized in nearly
every State of the Union, and in some of
the States has thousands of members. The
objects of the auxiliary were stated to the
audience of ladies by Captain Jerome
Deasy, president of the county board
A. 0. H. Strong addresses were made by
Rev. Father Crowley, J. J. Donohue and
other members of the order.
Following the addresses a temporary or
ganization was perfected and tne follow
ing ladies were elected officers: President,
Mrs. Captain Deasy; vice-president, Mrs.
John Ryall, recording secretary, Miss
Essie Pnillips; financial secretary, Mrs.
Captain Wrin; treasurer, Mrs. Charles
Flanagan.
The motion to call the first branch of the
Auxiliary Martha Washington Circle No.
1 was carried unanimously.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion advised that the temporary officers
be made permanent for six months. Car
ried.
The committee on rules of order sub
mitted rules and by-laws, which were
adopted. Fully 100 names are on the roll

JOCKEY COFFEY SUSPENDED.
His Peculiar Ride on Zobair the Csn*
of the Kullng.
In the race won by Peru on Saturday
last, Zobair was a starter, ridden by
Jockey-trainer Jimmy Coffey. His hand
line: of the horse in the race looked just a
trifle queer, and after an investigation the
judges have suspended him.
Zobair carried Bookmaker Humphrey's
colors, and after opening in the betting at
4to 1 receded to 7. Following the usual
order of things in a matter of this kind
the bookmaker admits the ride looked bad,
but the| jockey will have to stand thÂ«
brunt of the punishment.
The officials have also requested J. H.
Shields, owner of Scimitar, to be more
