Pacific Roads.
i.
[ALL INTEREST COULD BE PAID.
Government Ownership Would Not
Necessarily Follow the Sale of
the Bond-Aided Lines.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. Secre
tary of the Interior Hoke Smith appeared
before the House Committee on Pacific
Railroads this morning in response to the
request of Chairman Powers. He talked
for an hour and a half. His statements or
recommendations were in line with his
last annual report.
The fact that the Smith refunding bill
was referred to the Secretary of the In
terior, led some to believe that he was
favorable to the refunding scheme, but
this impression seems to have been erron
eous, judging from his statement before
the committee to-day. The Smith bill was
merely referred to him tor his opinion as
to the practicability of certain features of
it. Secretary Smith was called before the
committee to-day to explain why land
patents had been suspended, but did not
confine his remarks entirely to this
subject.
Smith declared that if the Government
continued to patent lands there was no
necessity for a provision for recovery of
those lands subsequently patented.
"The Union Pacific was about to become
insolvent," said he, "and might thereby
have forfeited its lands before I deemed it
proper to suspend land patents, inasmuch
as Congress was about to meet and con
sider the Pacific Railroads debt question.
But this suspension of patents was not in
any sense intended as an adjudication of
this question. It was my purpose, in sus
pending patents, to leave the matter in
statu quo,* so that Congress might have
perfect freedom in dealing with' this ques
.iou; but if Congress had failsd to legis-
1 1 late, or had signified its unwillingness to
take any action concerning Pacific railroad
land patents, the Interior 'Department
would immediately have resumed their
issuance." 'â¢â¢. " 'â ' â  ' 'â '.'â 
; At this point Chairman Powers sug
gested that, according to E. Ellery Ander
son of the Union Pacific Government di
rectors, purchasers of lands and- not rail
roads were the embarrassed parties. Sec
retary Smith replied :
"Bona-fide settlers should be protected,
â¢ of course, but how was this to be done?
There is no provision of law for it. The
department could not undertake to dis
criminate between the two. The bill
favored by â  Mr. Anderson " proposes that
patents shall issue without regard to the
rights and equities as between settlers and
the railroad and without regard to the
.real status of householding mortgages.
The bill proposes to issue all patents and
subsequently endeavor to reclaim some of
the lands. But there might be -nothing to
reclaim. It would all be according to the
extent of the insolvency of the roads. A
Union Pacific sub-company was formed to
dispose of these granted lands and did
dispose of several million acres of them.
The impot^^ question then arises,
'Where did the proceeds go? Who got the
money ? â¢
Boatner asked : "Were these lands dis
posed of by a sub-company.instead of the
company itself *
"That is correct, according to my infor
mation," replied Secretary Smi *-, "and
it might not be a bad idea for the Govern
ment to try to trace that fund and as far
: as practicable apply it to the discharge of
the â  bonds and mortgages upon these
lands." â¢
Boatnerâ Secretary, it seems from
the report of the Pacific Railway Com
mission that the proceeds of those land
grant '-, bonds were divided among "con
struction companies," which were, it
appears, composed of members of these
corporations. Can yon. suggest any way
by which these diverted funds might be
returned?
Secretary Smithâ course the Govern
ment would have the right that any cor
poration would have to sue the directors
for the recovery of the diverted funds. If
we can trace or locate these funds, or
ascertain thtv'they have been paid to any
of these bondholders, we might reduce
the amount of bonds and save that and
the land. It seems to me that, instead of
providing that land patents shall issue, It
would be better to pass an act of forfeit
ure, with a provision protecting bona-fide
purchasers. â¢.-.-*
! At this point a member of the commit
tee asked if the Pacific : roads had done
everything required by"the act of Congress
in order that they might properly dispose
of the land granted them.
"No," said Secretary Smith. "A part of
the agreement, viz., 'That they should
meet their Government bonds,' : has not
been complied with. Congress therefore
has the right to pass, a forfeiture act, and
if Congress shall fail to do so I shall sim
ply issue an order that the land be' pat
ented and expedited as rapidly as possible.
I confess not te understand the equities
" between the Government and the bond
l>Mders, but I think we should act as': in
oividuala would act. My own opinion is
"at we should pass t a general forfeiture
act so 18 to protec\ bona-fide landholders,
ana then,- after ah investigation, issue
patents only to thai extent to which tfaey
nave met their obligations to the Govern
ment. ~\ â¢--
Boatner here asked if it were possible, in
Secretary Smith's opiiion, to foreclose
the Pacific * roads wifcout providing for
I Government ownership. The Secretary
The San Francisco Call.
replied, emphatically there was no diffi
culty about that. . . li' ! fi: : }-
"The first consideration, I think," he
continued, "would naturally be the value
of the property. The cost of construction
of a railroad does not by any means always
represent its value, when such road has
been for years in existence, for its capacity
to earn money has increased every year
since its construction; and, too, I think it
is possible for the Government to pursue
some of the directors for the recovery of
diverted funds." : ;.V
At this juncture a member of the com
mittee inquired as to the validity of the
first mortgage bonds of the Central and
Union Pacific railroads, and Secretary Smith
declared it his opinion that such a question
would not hold, as the Government had
several times recognized their validity.
"Although under the sinking fund act we
have charged up the bonds paid off against
it, this is a matter of bookkeeping merely,
and therefore it is no question in my mind
but that the first mortgage bondholders
could, it obliged, claim this sinking fund
as against the Government. But this mat
ter is immaterial, inasmuch as the roads
are worth a great deal more than the first
mortgage bonds."
The Secretary showed from his last an
nual report that for the past ten years the
net earnings of the Pacific roads had been
$8,534,000, including, as expenditures, the
amounts paid into the sinking fund.
"Then your position, Secretary Smith,
is that inasmuch as the first and second
mortgages are the same in amount, and as
the roads have been paying 6 per cent on
the first mortgage, they could pay 3 7er
cent on the entire debt?" was asked.
"That is it exactly," said the Secretary.
"ln other words." suggested Faris, a
member of the committee, "you I contend
that in the funding proposition the roads
would be able to pay-. 3 per cent interest
without increased earnings?"
"Yes, they could pay one million dol
lars per annum and yet leave a handsome
profit to the purchaser."
He continued: "I am emphatically op
posed to Government ownership, but this
threat of Government ownership should
not be allowed to prevent that purchase
and re-sale." v
Judge Patterson of Tennessee â¢ asked :
"Is it your idea for the Government to
foreclose and then issue 3 per cent bonds
for the entire lien?"
"Yes."
"But would it not be better to sell the
bonds to reorganized companies?"
"If the Government provided for a fore
closure sale it would not be hard, I think,
to find an organization to buy this prop
erty, agreeing to issue its own bonds,
guaranteed by the Government for its total
indebtedness as a mortgage upon the prop
erty, in payment for it, and at the same
time pay into the treasury a fair amount
each year, not as a ting fund but to the
redemption of the bonds."
"But under your plan what would you'
do with the lease of the Central to the
Southern Pacific Railroad?"
"I would 1 break it," said the .Secretary
positively. â¢ "That-: lease was made by a
company which is now insolvent."
Kyle of Mississippi inquired, "Have you
seen and examined the so-called -Reilly^
â bill?":-.;;-,;, :;.-â â â â¢;â¢ :-:-;â :'â  ;" â¢-" â ; -- '
"Yes, and do not think it a good plan,"
said Secretary Smith. "I have never and
do not now believe in extending - the Pa
cific roads debt." " ' â â¢-â â¢-' ti'
Upon the insistence of Kyle that he
(Smith"; could learn much by careful peru
sal of the Reilly bill, the Secretary de
clared that the friends of the refunding
proposition hoped -that each fresh com
plication would tend : to discourage Con
gress, so that to get rid of this trouble
some matter they would 'be willing to
sacrifice a part of the debt due the Govern
ment, and that the more muddled affairs
became the greater the sacrifice will be.
"I think the Government," he said,
"should authorize some one to act for it,
and provide that if the parties did i not
carry out their contracts authority should
be .given to protect this property and meet
the first mortgage bonds."
Farissaid: "A statement has been made
before this committee that the receipts of
one of these companies decreased $42,000.
They declare they are poverty-stricken. It
seems foolish for us to trifle longer with
meaningless propositions. Would it not
be better to act upon Secretary Smith's
suggestions?" -
Secretary Smith concluded his state
ment by declaring that it was offensive to
him to see this Government property cut
out of San Francisco. "For the past ten
years these roads (main lines) have aver
aged $3,089,000 net profits, after paying 3
per cent interest: annually on the first
mortgage bonds and Government bonds
and interest. They also paid tolls on the
bridge, and I think the bridge belongs to
us."
Secretary Smith estimated that a bridge
of that kind ought to cost about two mil
lions and a half. ....'."' i
This is widely at variance with Central
Pacific Attorney Tweed's estimate. The
House committee will probably take a re
cess for two weeks.

ate committee next Saturday. ,

I â  â â '-'â ..- ...
BRISTOL, Conn., Feb. 6.â A most ap
palling disaster occurred here shortly after
9 o'clock to-night in which twenty* work
men were precipitated into Pequabeck
River from the East Bristol bridge, and
from ten to twelve of them are probably
lost. ' . Â;.
The structure was found to be shaky, and
the 4:42 train on the New England road
had a narrow escape from wreck as it
crossed on the way to Hartford. For some
time the bridge had been looked upon with
suspicion and a new bridge was in process ,
of erection and almost /completed. . It was
close 'alongside ...- ; the 7- bridge which was
carried ' away. After the eastbound pas
senger train had passed to-night on e'" side
of the old bridge gave way to the current
and with a crash went down into the boil
ing stream.:- .".7 i-*' 'â '.â 
The managers of the road immediately
dispatched a -wrecking train from Hart
ford, which arrived on the Forestville side
of j the Pequabeck |at 1 5:45. There were
forty men on the train, all of ' whom had
come from Hartford. They were imme
diately set to work to make the new bridge
passable, and work was progressing satis
factorily, by the aid of lanterns, up to 9
o'clock. To facilitate the work half of the
men were located on the remaining por
tion of â  the old j structure, passing iron
girders to another gang of men on the new
bridge.
The waters of the Pequabeck had been
continually rising since morning, and at 9
o'clock : were r higher than ever before
known. The water had risen two* or three
cet since . the first crash at 5 o'clock, and
the remainder of the bridge was really
tottering while the men were courageously
standing upon it. : â¢ â¢ v.
The outer end suddenly sank with a
crash with its human freight and was
carried off ; in - the \ boiling current. The
cries of the men, the creaking of timber
and the falling of iron work made a com
bined noise i. which was;- heard half a mile
away. The half of the gang which had
been ires ting 7oh more solid foundation
were horror-stricken to 1 see their working
companions; so suddenly precipitated to
death. In an instant,, however, they : were
formed into ; a rescuing party and â â  very
effort was made to save the drowning men.
' Two men were fortunate 7 enough to
reach shore by their own exertions almost
immediately after the fearful fall. -V. A
third was saved 'j by a workman, who
plunged in after him ;, and " brought him to
, the shore. Finally a fourth, a fifth j and
' then a : sixth were saved by the heroic
efforts of comrades. - Others could be seen
struggling away in the : mass of debris,
clinging to -it ! and crying frantically for
help, while a number never came in sight
after the bridge went down. ;-

preparations â  and volunteers immediately
rushed, to, the scene of the disaster. ,The
night was darkness itself, and with the
boiling stream overrunning its banks on
both sides, efforts- to rescue in the j dark
ness were fraught with the greatest danger.
Thomas Marine was ', the first man taken
from the river. ? Soon, after , William F.
Barry, foreman of the construction gang
in the East Hartford j yard, was rescued.
He. was badly injured, '.; having been

At midnight eleven persons ; were still
among the missing. All the members of
the construction gangs came from ( Hart

dents of those places. The men were con
necting up iron rails on the old bridge and
pushing them across. to the new structure
when the accident happened. A gang
was workingon each end, andjby some mis
understanding, it is supposed, all of them
were called to the center of the structure.
Their weight, .with .the extraordinary rush
of the current, is supposed to have directly
caused the* fall of the bridge. â  . '

. Department. ; â â;.
7 NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. Harry
Howard, the late chief of the old Volun
teer Fire Department, died at his home
early this morning. He was one of the
unique characters in the history of the
city. . He was born at Manhattan on
August 20, 1822. 7.
r Harry Howard for the last half j cen
tury had been one of the best-known fig
ures of New York. He was a foundling,
having been ' left, in 1822, when but a few
days old, with Mrs. Sarah Howard/who
became his adopted mother. Howard
never had any schooling, except | what he
got in Sunday-schools when he was a
small boy. He was apprenticed to a
cabinet-maker, and worked jat j the' trade
for eleven year*. , :
â¢ On April 11, 1840, he joined the Volun
teer Fire Department. In 1850 he became
foreman of the Atlantic Hose Company,
and in the same year assistant engineer to
Chief - Carson. In 1857 he was elected
Chief Engineer of the department
In the end of 1859 he suffered while at a
fire from a stroke of paralysis, which led to
his resignation in February of ; the next
year. He was in the Assembly in 1853 and
was Alderman in .1844-45. 7 Since his re
tirement he had lived in his home on Elm
street, taking an active interest in the af

FIRST BLOOD
FOR THE BILL
Prospects Brighten for the
Repeal of Huntington's â¢
' Charter.
HEARD IN COMMITTEE.
Senator : Goebel's Measure Will
Be Reported ; for Passage in
the Legislature.
LOBBYISTS ARE HARD AT WORK
Two Senators Join Them, hut the
Southern Pacific People Have a â 
Desperate Fight. \
FRANKFORT, Kv., Feb. 6.â Friends of
the bill to repeal the Southern Pacific
charter gained first blood before" the Judi
ciary Committee, which considered the
bill this evening. .On a vote the bill - was
reported with an expression of opinion
that it should pass- by a vote. of 5. to 2.
Chairman Goebel and , Senators Fulton,
Landes, Sayers and Sims voted for it, and
.Weissinger and Bennett against it. ' 7 J-^ "'-7
, When the committee met Chairman
Goebel called for j arguments. Senator
Weissinger seated ' that General B. 'W.
Duke, the well-known railroad lobbyist,
would appear against the bill. He did not, â¢
and Senator Weissinger took "the., floor
against 7 the bill. He argued earnestly
against the bill, and asked that the comm
ittee do .'nothing against "this defense
less and beneficent corporation." He said
little of the unscrupulous methods by
which the bill was passed, but took, the
bold ground that the charter had vested
rights allowed under the old constitution,
and that it would be a breach of faith on
the part of the State now to interfere.
Weissincer made his . usual able speech
from a legal point of view.
Senator Goebel followed him, and took
the ground that the conduct of the rail
road in the passage of the bill' took away
all moral or other rights, in a logical and
forcible' argument. ' .7
. Senators. Landes .and Bennett made
speeches in explanation of their position
in the matter. Senator Goebel is cham
pioning the bill. He is well known as the
most effective fighter in legislative mat
ters in the Legislature, and is in high spir
its over the vote ~on the bill. 7. Senator
"Goebel 'said to The Call:; 7 '7. ' '.
r . : "I have not been deceived by the action
of the committee. 7 The bill will .pass not
only the Senate, but the House, when it
comes to a vote." -'â '
Senator' Hays and Weissinger will' lead
the fight in the Senate against the bill,
and will be assisted by a strong . lobby,
backed by Huntington. St. John Boyle of '
Louisville is one of . the champions of the '
lobby now at work against the bill.
Senator Powell Taylor isa strong friend
of the bill, having previously resided in
California, and is well informed as ;to all â 
matters concerning it. He. is outspoken
in his opposition to the corporation, and
will be a strong aid to Senator Goebel.' . -
A majority of the Legislators were
elected pledged to reform, and represent
constituencies which have been the vic
tims of abuses at the hands of Hunting
ton and others for years, and whose sym
pathies are with the people of California
in this fight;. but this does not deter the
lobbyists from their work. If they can
delay final action till they have the ropes
all in hand and the wheels well geared
they feel certain of winning. They have
all the means at band that can be needed.
The difficulty is to use them with safety.
â¢ The Senatorial fight is very complicated,
outside of the question of whether a Dem
ocrat or Republican shall be elected.
The nine "sound-money won't let â¢ Joe
Blackburn be elected, and Joe won't get
out of the way for any one else, nor will
Dr. Hunter. If they were both to step
down and let new. men be nominated at
once the' election would soon be settled,
and the Legislature would get down to
work. ' . , â  .-.i *7;'
There seems to have been a - little queer
dealing between Joe Blackburn and the
Republicans in the Senate, and < Dr. J
Hunter, who organized the Republican i
State campaign, sent to Senator Quay for !
money. Quay said that he coula only send .
his personal check, which he did for $1000,
on condition that it was -. not to be used
against Mr. Blackburn, on the ground of
Senatorial -courtesy. 1 Now, Dr. Hunter is
himself a candidate against Mr. Blackburn, '
and the knowing ones say that there is an '
understanding that if one can't get the
seat the other shall have it.
Though both declare they are taking .no
sides in the repeal bill fight, it is a fore
gone conclusion that wherever a trade can
be made it "will be made, and the Hunting
ton lobbyists understand this probably
better than anybody else in Frankfort,
and they are not letting - a single : thread
drop as they go on weaving their web. If
they can delay matters long enough j they
will win, and they, know it. Prompt
action will defeat him. '.:-â "
I ; Could , not , an .appeal be ; sent .by . the
many residents* in California "who have
friends in Kentucky to urge their repre
sentatives . to assist Goebel .in," getting
prompt action on the bill? It would' have
much weight. The average Kentucky
legislator is quite responsive to appeals or
requests from his constituents aud will be
very careful how he * votes when he knows
they are watching him.'. '7 The people . of
Kentucky, are with the people of Califor
nia in this matter if they, can be induced
to act.

tion was made by, certain creditors for the

the Great Mass *of \
Bids.
WILL GET PREFERENCE.
Those Who Supply Gold From
Abroad to Be Given
First Choice.
FINAL STEPS IN THE LOAN.
Morgan and His Syndicate May Yet
Get the Lion's Share of the
New Issue.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. Fifteen
or twenty of the most expert clerks in the
Treasury Department were to-day working
on the tabulation of the enormous mass of
bond bids. The most sanguine scarcely
expects to complete the labor before
Wednesday next. Until the tabulation is
completed no definite announcement can
be issued to the bidders as to whether
their bids have been accepted or not.
There is a well-defined opinion, how
ever, that beginning with the solitary bid
der from impoverished Newfoundland,
who offered his hoarded gold for
$50 of the 4-per-cent twenty-nine-year
bonds of the United States down to
the level laid by the Morgan syndicate
at 110.6877,' all bids will be accepted.
Everything under that figure will be
thrown aside. But it must be remem
bered that the Secretary has the right of
rejecting any and all bids, and the further
intimation is given out that, other things
being equal, preference will be given to
those who propose to bring their gold from
abroad.
Morgan, having associated with him one
of the strongest financial institutions in
Germany, and having himself an interest
in powerful banking institutions abroad,
may be able to give such assurances as to
the importation of gold as will increase the
percentage of. his bid, if it is accepted.
Morgan himself, as stated in yesterday's
dispatches, thought there was only forty
millions ahead of him. The full list shows
that if all the bids received are bona fide
there may be twenty or thirty millions
more. It will be, of course, discretionary
with the Secretary to accept say fifty mil
lions of the Morgan syndicate bid on con
dition that the gold, or the greater part of
it, be brought from abroad, and to parti
tion the remaining fifty millions among
the most eligible bidders at 111 and up
ward.
â Secretary Carlisle has not so far given
any indication as to his purpose. .
By working day and night with expert
accountants, Assistant Secretary Curtis
hopes to be able to announce to-morrow
the names of those who were the success
ful bidders at the bond opening on Wednes
day. 77"^
The treasury has already on hand ready
for delivery $40,000,000 registered bonds
and $22,000,000 coupon bonds. Practically
all of the bonds have been printed and will
be ready for distribution in ample time.
Already steps have been taken to afford
successful bidders an opportunity to pay
for their bonds. The following circular
letter directed to United States Treasurer
Morgan, copies of which were also for
warded to the nine assistant treasurers,
was signed by Assistant Secretary Wike
late this afternoon:
Treasury Department, February 6, 1896.
As scon as practicable the department will
furnish you a list of accepted bidders for the 4
per cent bonds of 1925, offered to the public
by the circulars of January 6, 9 and 15, 1896.
Tne list will contain the name of each bidder
with the address, the amount of each bid, the
price, and the date of the Secretary's accept
ance. You will receive payment for the bonds
in United States gold coin or gold certificates
by installments or in full, as provided in the
circulars above-mentioned. Each payment or
an- instalment should include the principal,
premium at the price named in the bid and
accrued interest from February 1, 1896, to
date of such payment, so that the proportion
ate amount of the bonds representing the in
stallment will be paid for in full. You will
issue for each payment your certificate of de
posit in duplicate, in the name of the de
positor, on account of purchase of 4 per cent
bonus of 1925, stating on the face of such cer
tificate the amounts respectively of principal,
premium and accrued interest received, and
also state thereon the number of the install
ment when not in full.
You will 'deliver the duplicate to the depos
itor with Instructions to retain the duplicate
and to forward the original to the Secretary of
the Treasury, accompanied by a letter from
the depositor giving complete Information as
to the kind and denomination of the bonds
desired and the place of their delivery.
The bonds will be issued only upon receipt
by the Secretary of the original certificate of
deposit. Any depositor may assign the orig
inal certificate issued; in his ' name, in which
case the bonds will be issued upon the order
of the assignee. If it .should be deemed ad
visable to postpone the receipt of .deposits on
this account beyond the dates fixed in the
circulars special instructions by telegram or
letter will be given you.
The department will begin the delivery of
both registered and v coupon bonds as soon as
certificates of deposit therefor are received by
the Secretary as above indicated. â  'â  â 
THE MURDER OF PEARL BRYAN.
Scott Jackson, the Dental Student, Dec/ares
the Crime Was Commit fed by
Alonzo Walling,
CINCINNATI, Ohio, . Feb. 6.-Scott
Jackson, the dental student who was ar
rested here last night, charged with the
murder of Pearl Bryan, the girl found
near Fort Thomas, has made a statement.
He says his friend William F. Wood had
come to him and informed him that the
girl, whom they both knew, was in a deli-\
cate condition. Wood asked Jackson' to
perform an operation, which he declined
to do. He however secured the services of
Alonzo Walling, " his present roommate.
The girl came here and was put in charge
of Walling, with whom she was left. Jack
son asserts he knows nothing," of his per
sonal knowledge, of .Walling., or Wood's,
actions in the matter after that. He de
clares his belief that Walling murdered the
girl. Wood has been captured at South
Bend, Ind.llgSliEi^
When taken before Chief Deitsch this
morning Walling declared that Jackson
killed the girl. He professed to be igno
rant of the details. When asked the where
abouts of the girl's head he said he sup
posed it was in the river. He' told of the
meeting with the girl on Fourth "street oh
Wednesday.when he told her that Jackson
was too busy to see her. That was the last
he saw of her. :< Ov7 â â ;â â â¢.'
Pearl Bryan arrived here at the Cincin
nati, Hamilton and ; Dayton ; depot Tues
day night, January 28,"* at 7 o'clock.' ? John;
Belli took her to the Indiana" House, and.
by her orders notified Jackson. She told
Belli that if Jackson did not come to see
her Walling would. Jackson says that
she c_me here to have an operation, per
formed. He implies that Walling was the
man that procured it. Meantime he ad
mits that she was killed in the attempt to
perform the operation.
The crime was one of the most horrible
ever committed in this section. Last
Saturday morning the headless body of an
unknown young .woman was found in a
field in the Kentucky highlands about
half a mile south of Fort Thomas. There
was no clew but a shoe, a corset and a
woman's check dress. The shoe was
traced to a farm in Greencastle, Ind., and
yesterday Mr. and' Mrs. Bryan, farmer
people living, near that city, identified
them as those of their daughter, Pearl
Bryan, who left home on Tuesday, Janu
ary 28, to, go to Indianapolis to visit a
friend. 7 r 7 7v*7
Detectives arrested Scott Jackson, who
is a student in the. Ohio Dental College,
last night. He is well connected at Green
castle. William* Wood, who was arrested
at South Bend, as an accomplice, is a near
relative of Rev. Mr. Wood, the presiding ,
elder of that district of the Methodist
Episcopal church. It is alleged that Wood
put the unfortunate girl on the train at
Greencastle, and was the last person seen
in that place with her. ' -"".,'",, -..,'

Unprofitable Whisky Properties Remain

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 6.â This was the
last day for filing interrogatories in the
whisky trust rebate claims before the
special master, and General McNulta, the
receiver oi the whisky trust properties, has
about finished his arduous task. He said
to-day :
"There are rebate claims . amounting to
$100,000 still unsettled, and other claims
amounting to $330,000 against the trust,
but many of the latter are fictitious and
the bonafide amount is about $200,000. I
have $500,000 cash to pay 'â  off all claims.
All of the active properties are in the bands
of the American Spirits Distilling Com
pany. Among the inactive distilleries that
are on my hands are the Calumet, which
cost $500,000, and the $300,000 Nebraska
distilleiyat Nebraska City. I have had
several conferences with Nebraska people
regarding the sale of the latter property,
but there has been no offer for the Calu
met."

Democrats Succeed in Electing Their
Candidate for State Libra- -
rian.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. The House
preliminaries preceding the balloting for
Senator to-day . were not characterized by
the stormy proceedings that were antici
pated. The reports of the two wings of
the Werner-Tompkins committee were not
made, the Republicans not having com
pleted their review- 1 of the case, and the
unseating trouble was â¢ not even ' remotely
touched upon. The lobbies and galleries
: of the Assembly hall were packed with
people as early as 11 o'clock, and the crowd
had swelled . out, filling the rotunda by
noon.
The roll-call showed 136 present; sixty
nine being necessary to a choice. Senator
Weisinger and Representatives Carroll and
Violett, sound money Democrats, voted
for Carlisle. Speighl, Walker and White
voted for McCreary. Populist Poore voted
for Bate. White's vote was a break in the
Blackburn column. The" ballot stood:
Hunter 67, Blackburn 62, scattering 7."
Lieutenant-Governor Worthington ruled
out of order Senator Bronston's motion to
go into an election for Librarian, and
Bronston promptly â¢ appealed. Worthing
ton vacated the chair, and the galleries
yelled wildly as Senator Goebel took : up
the gavel.
Worthington's decision was overruled
by a vote of 70 to 66, Senator Petrie (R.)
voting with the Democrats. The ; Repub
licans withdrew their nominee, Mrs.
Shelton, and Miss Guy, the Democratic
nominee, was declared elected. The Re
publicans as a body refrained from voting.
Petrie (R.) voted for Miss Guy.
TO CALL OUT THE MILITIA.
Therm Is a Promise of Trouble if Members
Are Unseated.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 7 (2 a. m.)â
After a consultation to-night between
Governor Bradley, Dr. Hunter and other
Republicans it was decided to call out the
State militia; to be present during the
balloting for United States Senator after
the unseating of members shall haye
begun.
This will certainly provoke trouble to
morrow.
At the conference the Hunter managers
announced to the Governor that some
thing had to be done, It seemed certain
that when Representatives Tompkins
and -.7 Kaufman . were . unseated ; â â â¢ the
Democratic Senate would retaliate
instantly and would not permit the un
seated Republicans to go into the joint
session, the Democrats having the chief
sergeaut-at-arms and doorkeeper.
They also stated: that quite a number of
Senator Blackburn's friends were going to
be sworn in as deputies in order to help
keep out the unseated Republican Sena
tors. This furnished the basis for the re
quest for the militia..

An Interesting Argument by the lowa
Statesman for the Distribution of

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 6.â The
matter of greatest public concern in con
nection with the proceedings of the Senate
when it met to-day was the disposition. to
be made of the resolution offered by Quay
of Pennsylvania last Tuesday, to recom
mit the House tariff bill with the free
coinage substitute to the Finance Com
mittee with instructions to report them
back as separate propositions. The resolu
tion came up after the routine morning
business, and was modified *by Quay by
striking out the phrase as to instructions
and inserting in lieu of it the j words "for
further consideration." . Quay also, \in
order to accommodate Senators, who de
sired to proceed with other business, pro
posed that the resolution lie over till Mon
day next after the morning business.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio could not see the
necessity of delay and proposed- immedi
ate action upon it, but an objectiou was
interposed by Hill (D.) of New York, and
Quay's proposition was agreed to the
resolution going over till next Monday.
Later on in the day, Morgan of Alabama
gave notice of an amendment to the reso
lution, the point of which is that coun
tries which will by law make United States
silver full leeal tender money in "payment
of customs and of goods imported to this
country shall have a reduction of 10 per
cent allowed in United States custom
duties on such goods if imported in
United States vessels or vessels belonging

The remainder of the day's session was
given to the consideration of the "resolution
offered by Dubois of Idaho, for the distri
bution of the general appropriation bills.
The matter went over without final action.
Immediately after the opening of to
day's session a handsomely bound mo
rocco volume was sent to the clerk's desk
by Sherman (R.) of "Ohio. It contained
the credentials of his future colleague,
Joseph B. Foraker, as Senator from the
State of Ohio for the term beginning
March 8, 1897, succeeding Brice. The
credentials were engrossed on parchment
in old English text, 'and the volume was
tied with a cord of blue silk.
Hill (D.) of New York offered a resolu
tion . which was . agreed to directing the
Secretary of the Treasury to send to the
Senate such detailed information of yes
terday's bond bill as may be desirable for
a proper understanding of the bids.
Thurston (R.) of Nebraska offered a reso
lution, which was agreed to, directing the
Secretary of State to furnish to the Senate
at his earliest convenience copies of all
laws, decrees and regulations promulgated
by the Governments of Germany, France,
Belgium and 7 Denmark discriminating
against the admission of American cattle,
meats and other agricultural products.
The Vice-President laid before the Sen
ate the resolution offered on Tuesday by
Quay (K.) of Pennsylvania to recommit to
the Finance Committee the House tariff
bill j and the free coinage f substitute re
ported with it, with instructions to report
them back as separate propositions.- It
was. at Quay's suggestion, postponed till
Monday next after the morning hour, it
having first been modified so as to merely
have the matter recommitted for further
consideration. m I}:s
â  Turpie , (D.) of - Indiana addressed the
Senate in support of his resolution pro
viding for the election of Senators by the
people.
â¢At the conclusion of Turpie' s remarks
the joint resolution was referred to the
Committee on Privileges and â¢ Elections.
Among the bills passed was the House
bill to piohibit prize-fights and bull-fights
in the Territories; House bill, to authorize

to remit fines and forfeitures.
7 Morgan (D.) of Alabama gave notice of
an amendment :to 'Quay's resolution re
committing the House tariff bill and free
coinage substitute -to the Finance Com
mittee. . .7
The amendment is to further instruct
the committee to report a provision that
there shall be deducted from : the customs
duties on articles imported ; from other
countries ;10 .percent, of the ) duties, and
when the imports are in' vessels of the
United States or in vessels of the country

country on- equal terms with gold bullion,
and shall be received without discount or
discrimination 7or payment lof customs
duties, or of such imported articles as : full
legal-tender money. _
. The resolution proposing the distribu
tion of appropriation l bills among the
committees -having; charge of the subject
I matter was then taken up.
{ Allen (R.) \of lowa, i chairman of^the ;
Committee on Appropriations, 7 made :an
argument on the resolution â¢ for the distri
bution of bills, speaking for two and a
quarter hours. ; He was -followed in the
argument by Hawley (R.) of ' Connecticut,
in favor of the resolution. ;
7 George (D.) of Mississippi also argued
in favor of the proposed amendment. In
the course of his remarks he paid a high
tribute to Allison, and the" speech made by
him to-day, ; Baying ? that if ' any * further
proof were needed of -that" Senator's emi
nent fitness for the ; high position in the
gift of the nation, that argument fur
nishad it. He might say that, he added,
in the Senator's absence. '
Hoar (R.) 0 7 Massachusetts argued
against the resolution. He believed that
it would be unwise to make such a sudden
change and to wrench the proceedings of
the Senate all awry. He thought that
the matter ought to goto the Committee
on Rules. - 7 ,7
The discussion continued until 5:40
o'clock, when Harris (D.) moved an ad
journment. Dubois and other friends of
the resolution demanded : the ayes and
noes on the motion to adjourn. The ayes
and noes were taken, but in the course of
the call there was a great deal of confusion
arising out of numerous transfers thereof
and misunderstanding on the question of
pairs. The result was finally announced
as: Ayes 34, noes 29, and the Senate at 6
p. M. adjourned till to-morrow.

STARS AND STRIPES WAVE.
Jones Islanders Victorious in an
Encounter With Peace
. Officers. .
An Attempted ' Eviction That Caused
an Uprising, in Which the
Women Joined.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Feb. 6.-The stars
and stripes still wave over Jones Island,
and the Jones Islanders came off victorious
in a battle this morning with nearly forty
officers of the law. Ever since the last
attempt at eviction on Jones Island the
islanders have been" 1 keeping close watch
on the Illinois Steel; Company, and they
have friends and spies in the very employ
of the company, who keep them fully in
formed as to the plans of the corporation.
Therefore, when the â¢ company went
among its men and asked them to serve
as deputies to assist in evicting the fisher
men, the Jones Islanders were speedily
told of the fact, and even knew of the date
fixed for tha raidâ this morning.
Constable S Paulson, accompanied by
between thirty-five and forty deputy con
stables, Was greeted by a force 400 strong.
The women were there with stove wood
and stove lifters, and one woman waved a
meat ax and swore to kill the first man
who tried to evict any of her neighbors.
Paulson is no coward, but although he had
a police captain from the south side, and
six stalwart "coppers" with him, he
hesitated to do anything which should
commence hostilities. Hoots and yells,
taunts and curses, along with an occasional
stone or club, were hurled at the now
frightened deputies, while the islanders
pressed even closer to them and grew more
threatening.
* At last Paulson said he would go alone
to the house, and the police escorted him
to the house of Baker Dettaff, for whom
the eviction papers were ; made out. !He
was escorted hither by a mob of infuriated
women, among them the woman with the
meat ax. Dettaff met him at the door and
assured him there was a sick girl in the
house. In view of this fact, which Paul
son ascertained by â¢personal observation,
he concluded to postpone the eviction till
another day.
When he returned to where he had left
his posse guarded by the moD, all but fif
teen had vanished, scared into retreat by
the demonstrations. __S_Â§"f?ill?

ADVANTAGES TO BE DERIVED.
The Debate Continues During an Even
ing Session, but No Conclusion
Is Reached, 7
' WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 6.â To-day's
session of the House was devoted exclu
sively to the further consideration of the
bond bill and the Senate's free-coinage
substitute therefor. "â 
The debate in favor of the Senate substi
tute was opened by Wheeler of Alabama,
a member of the Committee on Ways and
Means, who replied to Dingley's speech of
yesterday. He assorted that every alle
gation of Dingley upon which he based
his argument for the gold standard was
fallacious and unsupported by facts. He
took each statement of Dingley 'in de
tail and made a plausible argument in fa
vor of : silver coinage. He was followed by
Johnson of North Dakota against free
coinage. Johnson said:
"The Republican party was defeated in
November, 1892, when we were harvesting
and marketing the crop of that year, and
the shadow of free trade settled down on
the country. Measured by any standard,
I assert that never since Moses slew the
Egyptian and hid his body in the sand
has there been a time when the farmer
could have paid his debts so easily and
cheaply as in 1891, the culmination of
thirty years of Republican rule and policy
in controlling the administration of the
Government." [Applause.]
In regard to the effect of free coinage of
silver on debt paying Johnson said:
"Official statistics show that insurance
companies, savings and National banks
have over $10,000,000,000 ., on deposit % for
which they are debtors to the people. Free
coinage of silver would enable them to
shave this indebtedness in two by paying it
in depreciated silver dollars. This would
make, were the money equally . divided,
5000 ; millionaires. At present there are
but 4000 in the country, and to do this you
would rob the widow and orphan of half
of their living.".
In the course of his remarks several gen
tlemen endeavored to ; interrupt Johnson
with questions, to all of whom he said
that he would take them in turn when he
had concluded, which he did, after which
C. W. Stone (R.) of Pennsylvania and Mo-
Rue (D.) of Arkansas continued the discus
sion, the latter insisting the free silver
should be secured by the Democratic or
ganization. It : must be maintained be
cause^ he said, it is the only organization
that can check the paternal tendencies in
the government of the Republicans.
. The next speaker was Johnson (R.) of
California, who spoke in favor of free coin
age of silver. He said that the duty of the
House demanded that something be done
for silver. What the silver men asked
was that the country be put back to the
days of 1873, when silver and gold alike,
were coined in its mints, and that Con
gress quit trying the Keeley gold ; cure on
the Government. He criticized Dingley
for offering nothing as an alternative to
free coinage, and;. urged that American
silver at least be coined. 77 7
Johnson's time expired before he had
concluded, and the colloquy that : followed
over an attempt to secure an extension re
vealed something of the bitterness of feel
ing between the silver and anti-silver fac
tions. An extension would crowd Settle
(R.) of North Carolina out of ; the list for
the afternoon, and he objected. An ar
rangement was finally made by which,
through Walker (R.) of Massachusetts and
McLaurin (D.) of South Carolina, Johnson
secured the desired time. Resuming his
remarks, Johnson said: *
"I thank the gentleman from Massachu
setts for his courtesy. As for the other
gentleman, I want, to say that I never for
get a favor Or overlook "an injury.' If that
means war, speaking for one, I want to say
that the silver Republicans are ready to
set the lance in rest now or at any time'
upon this question." 7 â¢
The debate was continued by Settle, who
devoted some time to Johnson's speech.
He opposed the Senate substitute, but said
that he would like to see some legislation
that would lead to a freer use of silver. *
After 7 Brewster (R.) of New York had
made a brief speech in opposition to the
Senate substitute the committee rose.
- At the suggestion of Dingley at 5 o'clock
a recess was taken until 7:30 p. m., the
session to continue until 10:30 o'clock to
morrow morning, both sessions to be de
voted to debate only." ' . 7" '..7'
The 7! session of the House to-night
dragged along slowly and without interest.
Althoueh7 the session was to last until
10:30 o'clock the list of : speakers gave out
at 10 o'clock, and the chairman, Hepburn
(R.) of lowa, was forced to; declare the
House in recess until 10:30 to-morrow.
Hardly a score of members were present
and several times during the evening there
were long pauses, awaiting ( the appearance
of persons who desired to speak. ...

BOONE, lowa, Feb. 6.â The trial of
Stanhope Royster for the murder of E. W.

Boone until Royster came from his home
near here and discovered the truth. He
shot McFarland dead. Anna left home

WRECKERS IN GREAT PERIL
Fourteen Men at the Mercy of the I
Waves on the Stranded
Leamington.
Life-Savers Powerless to Effect Their
.Rescue on Account of the
Storm.
7 PATCHOGUE, N. V., Feb. 6. -Two
wrecKing tugs worked from yesterday un
til 10 o'clock to-day trying to pull off the
steamer Leamington, which went ashore
Tuesday night. At 10 o'clock this morn
ing the I tugs abandoned the steamer be- j
cause of the high seas.
The wrecking companies put seven men
aboard the steamer last night, but could
not launch a boat to get thÂ«m off, so they
left them aboard with Captain Duff, the
mate and three engineers. Fourteen men
are now aboard the steamer, and they will
probably be- washed . overboard before
morning..
Last night Captain Duff signaled Cap
tain Rourke to take off the breeches buoy,
which was done.
At 11 o'clock this morning signals of
distress were made from the steamer. The
life-savers tried to throw a line to the ves
sel, but failed. The steamer's stern is
solidly imbedded in the sand, while the
bow pounds back and forth with the sea.
The men dare not leave their positions or
they will be washed overboard.
At nightfall all seemed hopeless, the
seas dashing high over the vessel from
stern to stem.
A line was shot to the vessel about 6:30
this evening during .a lull in the storm,
which caught in the rigging, but tbe men,
who had taken to the masts at 6:lso'clock,
could not find it on account of tne . dark
ness. It is not. known whether the men
on board the steamship are dead or alive.
The line hangs listless in the surf. The
vessel is all under water. .
The seas threaten at any moment to
throw the r men out of the rigging. = It ap
pears on shore as if the steamer's bottom
has been broken.
The life-savers are still working bravely
under the terrible strain. 7
, The storm to- night is worse than it was
to-day. Two. of the men on board are
said to be Merritt's nephew and Lauter
back's brother. . 'â '..,

Managers.
AFRAID OF THE PENALTY
An Attempt to Hasten the Meeting
Between Maher and Fitz

CANNOT FIGHT IN MEXICO.
Dan Stuart in a Quandary as to Where
to Hold the Fistio Events
Announced.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 6.â The action of
Congress . passing Delegate Catron's
bill preventing prize-fighting in the
Territories has somewhat dampened the
ardor of those connected with the enter
prise, yet it is probable the star feature of
the carnival will be pulled off to-morrow
morning before President Cleveland
affixes his signature to the measure.
That the passage of the bill by the
House had struck consternation to the
managers of the carnival was apparent
this morning when contractors for the
platform v were , rushing round hunting
carpenters to complete their part of the
work. It was soon learned that it had
been decided to pull off . the Maher-
Fitzsimmons fight to-morrow morning
before the President signs the bill if it
should pass the Senate. Julian and
Stuart held a protracted consultation, at
which Fitzsimmons was an , attentive
listener.;
Maher was telephoned at Las Cruces and
everything seemed to be agreed upon, but
when word came that the Senate had
taken the expected action and passed the
bill promptly it seemed to dampen their
ardor.
It appeared to the outsiders that Maher
had become frightened lest the President
should sign the bill and that it would be
come a law so early to-morrow, as to make
the fighters . subject to the penalty. The
Irish fighter has not yet come in.
Everything is activity to-night, and
while Stuart is giving out that the pro
gramme will be carried out as advertised,
it is plain that he is not sure of his ground
and that he believes the bill passed by
Gongress cuts off the only sure locality
where the fight could be pulled off and the
participants escape with light fines. It is
reported that favorable telegrams were re
ceived . from , Mexico this afternoon, but
those opposing the fight are, confident of
their ground that the battle will never
take place on Mexican soil.
It is reported to-night that Fitzsimmons
has been notified that he could not train
longer in Mexico. ; The report comes from
reliable sources, and it is thought' tha v
Australian will have to hunt new quarter/
if further training is j necessary. . There ,
seems to be an inside ring on prize-fight
news, whereby only, those in it who will
send out news entirely favorable to the
prize-fight management are given infor
mation.
There is quite a feeling among a great
number of El Paso people that the action
of Stuart in publishing to the world that
he bad secured a battle-ground ' where
there would be no interference partakes
largely of the nature of a "bunko" game.
El Pasoans have made big preparations to
care for the crowd, and if the fight falls
ti. rough it will hurt many of the best citi
zens. , ."71
The sports are loud in their denuncia
tion of the Ministers' Union and are try
ing to incite the people against the minis
ters, claiming that if the fight is not pulled
off here and Et Paso loses the money
thereby, only the ministers are to blame,
They seem to lose sight of the fact that
Dan Stuart's word that the fight could be
pulled off in sight of El Paso, backed by
the word of the El Paso sporting people,
was the only foundation they had on
which to build their expectations. . A
prominent sporting man was heard to
night to say that he believed the whole
thing was off. Word received from Las
Cruces to-night would indicate that Maher
is perfectly quiet.

All the reports to 4 the contrary are/ given

to McKinley's strength. : I think when

- â¢
WHITING, Ind., *eb. 6.â Whiting was
the scene of a bloody riot- this afternoon,
and as a result three â¢ men are dead and
another is lying at the point of â  death.
The dead are: Emory Szanjo, Ateve
Mutcha and John Mokin. -
Seriously injured : Jacob Gladstone, ci
gar manufacturer, 397 South ; Main street,
Chicago, shot in breast; John Thomas,
.foreman for Standard Oil Company, shot
in right side, will die.;'
The trouble began in the saloon of Jo
seph Maovitik, at the corner of Adams
street and Whiting road. For pome years
bad blood has existed between the Hunga
rians and the Polanders living. in Whiting.
Maovitik is a Pole, and about 2 o'clock
this afternoon a crowd of Hungarians en
tered his saloon- with. the. avowed purpose
of clearing out the place. -
They began by directing insulting re
marks to the saloon-keeper and his wife,
who was also in the saloon at the time.
Several of Maovitik's friends were present,
snd one of them struck a Hungarian,
knocking him senseless. The Hungarians
became enraged at this, and, drawing re
volvers, opened up "a promiscuous shoot
ing. Maovitik and his wifs fled upstairs,
leaving the Hungarians in possession of
the saloon. 7 *'
Several of them rushed outside and,
with clubs, began" breaking the large plate
glass windows "of the saloon. Maovitik,
from an upper window, fired a volley at
the men below. His shots told, and when
the smoke cleared away Szanjo and Mutcha
lay dead in the street. .
. In the meantime Mrs. Maovitik stood at
the head of the stairs and fired into a
crowd attempting to mount the stairs.
Thomas fell, ; it . is thought,' mortally
wounded.
Gladstone was in the saloon at the time
the trouble began taking orders for cigars,
and was endeavoring to escape when one
of the shots from the woman's gun struck
him in the breast, just over the heart. The
bullet was checked by a matchbox in his
vest pocket, which saved his life. 7?.
j Then ' Chief of Police Dobbins, Officer
Lowenthal and jj Deputy Sheriff Emmell
came on the scene. 7 The maddened Hun
garians ' barricaded . ; themselves in the
saloon and refused to come out. 'With
drawn revolvers the .officers attacked the
doors of the ; buildings. â  They succeeded
in forcing an entrance and arrested the
ringleaders. They took the prisoners to
Hammond jail, where they will be given a
hearing to-morrow..
There is talk among the Poles to-night
that may signify trouble to-morrow. 7"
TO RECOGNIZE BELLIGERENCY.
General .Weyler Will Issue a, Proclama
tion to Tliat Effect.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 6.-? A Herald
special from Washington says: Just as
soon as General Weyler, the -successor of
General Campos in command of the Span
ish forces in Cuba, assumes his new duties
he will issue a proclamation, I understand,
practically giving belligerent rights to the
insurgents. ,' '
7*l learned at the department yesterday
that Secretary Olney has been advised of
the proposed proclamation and of the pro
gramme Spain has so far outlined ' for car
rying on the war. The proclamation will
declare the intention of Spain to carry on
a humane war as long as the Cubans con
fine their war to civilized methods. Gen
eral Weyler will issue the proclamation, it
is expected, within a week. It is the ex
pectation of the Spanish Government that
the rebels will agree â to the terms of the
proclamation to be issued, and cease the
destruction of property of non-combatants.
" The action . of :â¢ Spain ;in this . matter is
looked upon as a shrewd diplomatic move
[by the Madrid authorities. The commu
; nication received at the State: Department
was very friendly in tone, and it relieves
the United States from taking any steps in
the direction of suggesting action by her
looking, to' belligerency, such as was sug
gested by the resolution favorably reported
by^ the majority of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee: .7:* - ;;
] That the Secretary of State has not com
municated the proposed action of the
Spanish Government to the members {of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
is shown by the fact that ; it agreed yester
day upon the substitute for the resolution
heretofore reported. ;

The Question of Recognizing ' Cubans
.: Heard tin Committee. â '
: ] WASHINGTON, 7D. ,C.,] Feb. 6.-The
question of recognizing ] the belligerency
of the/ Cuban 'â â  insurgents was 1 fully dis
cussed at the meeting to-day of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs. ] '
Pearson of North Carolina precipitated
the debate by. suggesting that â¢ the House
should formulate a resolution . recognizing
the belligerency of the Cubans without
waiting further for. the data from the State
Department which] the] committee called
for several weeks ago. At that time the
general subject of Cuban affairs was . re
ferred to a sub-committee, of which Adams
of Pennsylvania^ chairman. 7 ' ; "
. /When Pearson had finished the question
was asked of Adams what ought to be the
attitude of this Government with refer
ence to Cuban recognition. / .'â -:'
i Adams obviously was . not over friendly]
to the proposition. He thought the United
States ought to proceed slowly the mat
ter./ He went on to say that Ihe had in
quired among the ] larger business houses
of Philadelphia as to the conditions in Cuba
and that his replies had not been satisfac
tory. '. ]/-' : -, "â ; '-.; .. ; . /.. â '

Other members of the -committee ques
tioned Adams upon other phases of the
situation, and the suggestion was ad
vanced by McCreary of -Kentucky that re
cognitions of this character, were purely an
executive function. â¢
â¢ This brought Smith of Michigan, one of
the young members of the House and an
enthusiastic sympathizer with the Cuban
insurgents, into the discussion. Smith in
sisted : that the constitution | contained
no authority vesting such power in the ex
ecutive; A recognition \of belligerency,
however, which might involve war, was,
in his i judgment, a legislative function,
and therefore a concurrent resolution of
recognition; which should be presented to
the President for his signature, would fix
tbe responsibility; where ;it; belonged
namely, upon the legislative branch of the
Government. He . informed the commit
tee that Senator Sherman in] 1870 reported
a resolution recognizing the belligerent
rights of the Cubans at that time. ,
After further discussion HUt, the-chair
man of the committee, announced that the
correspondence desired had been prepared
at the State Department and that as soon
as it was received by the House the com
mittee would be called to consider it.
â  Money of Mississippi interjected an ob
servation that it was the duty of ? this Gov
ernment to remain on friendly terms with
the Spanish Government. 7. To this- Smith
made a pointed denial.' ' The point was also
raised t that citizens â  of \ the United r ; States
have large property interests ; in the island
and the question was asked as to the effect
of a resolution of belligerency , upon 'i these'
interests. Smith 7 replied j} that he bad
given no thought to that question and that
he never measured his patriotism] by dol
lars and cents.

SAN BERNARDINO, . Cal!/ Feb. 6.--;
The case entitled the; San] Francisco : Sav
ings Union vs. the Semi-Tropic Land; and
Water Company has at ] last t come to an
end, after being 'â : in I the \ courts for 1 some
years. / On] Monday Otis of the Su
perior Court rendered his decision in favor
of the Savings Union, and unless the lands
of " the ; defendants are not "redeemed ;by
September 15, 1896, a Sheriff's sale will be
the result. : ]-v*iilÃ___-S^ :^^ â¢>/
/ ; The suit was brought ; by the -. Savings
Union on a note for $750,000.] The mort
ga c , given to ; secure /the note included :
17,000 acres of land situated to the west of
San Bernardino/arid forming ;' the â  greater
part of ' the Rialto ; settlement, about 140
. bonds of i the ' Rialto .; Irrigation District to
the value of about $70,000 and forty shares
of the Lytle Creek Water Company.
r ] The loan was made in; two parcels, the
smaller being for $13,000 \on " 180 ] acres* 7 of
land a little northeast of Rialto, the inter
est running the amount up to $13,723 48. ;
.-] The case ;; is V one of ] the most important
ever tried ; ; in ;* the courts of this portion of
State. When the original suit was
brought there were 450 defendants. When
the^ Semi-Tropic Land and^ Water Company
started it went with a boom, Ex-Governor
Merrill of - lowa was at the head of the en
terprise, supported by a large] number of
prominent ,' men from different Eastern
points. . Streets were laid out and real
estate offices opened. . A large and com
modious hotel graced the acres and acres
of wild, uncultivated land. '.'â¢,
The sale of lots commenced, and rapidly
â¢ the sagebush and cactus gave way 7to a
thriving settlement. Settlers bought with
the knowledge that a blanket mortgage
hung over the lands, but the boom was on
and they had hopes of being able to pay
off the mortgage and have their little
homes free. Many paid in full at the first
payment and received a release of the
mortgage, but those ] who failed -: are -the
ones who are in despair, and the seven
and. a half } months' time gives but little
hope to them in the face of the present de
pressed times. It is said that some have
left their places and gone to other points,
letting their homes go for what they will.
Â Still, in the face of all this, the : Savings"
Union \ has'. made a very liberal offer to
those who are in arrears. The attorney
for the Savings Union said to a Call corre
spondent : "The Savings Union has filed a
reasonable release clause, so that it will
cost no purchaser of land more to redeem
it than he was originally, to pay. Instead
of paying to the Semi-Tropic Company,
he i will I pay the ; balance he owes to the
Savings Union, and receive a release from
the mortgage.].- Of 7 course this must ]] be
done within the time given by the court."
-I 'â  Said a prominent \ Rial to man to a Call
correspondent : . "We are in hopes . tb at ' all
will come out well : and " think it will, so
that none of our settlers will suffer. Our
country] is growing, and the land '' is - now
commencing to give value received. There
may be such a thing as that an extension '
of . time-can ]be ' had iif the * outlook for a
settlement is anywhere good.','
J: Aside : from this present .difficulty, â¢. the
Semi-tropic Company is r striving to get an
injunction against â ; the .Grapeland. Irriga
tion Company, as the latter, by., tunneling
under the Lytle Creek waters, it is claimed,
will tap the supply now used by the former
for watering ; its lands, as the water owned \
'â â  by the "< Semi-tropic : Company . flows from
Lytle ] Creek i Canyon: and i the i. Grapeland
company is running a]. 3000-foot tunnel
under, the bed of the ', creek. \ The case 'â  is
now pending in the courts and the decision
is awaited with great interest. â¢";

PORTLAND WIFE MURDER
The Woman's Throat Cut by Her
Jealous and Drunken
Husband. â¢
Made a Desperate Attempt; to Kill
Himself, but Will Re
cover.
PORTLAND, Ob., Feb.. 6.â George ' Bar
ter/a logger, who recently came here with
his family from Roslyn, Wash., at 6 o'clock
this evening slashed his wife's throat from
ear to ear in the Winters lodging-house on
Davis-street and Grant avenue, East Port
land. â¢ She died in a few moments. -
The act was committed while, it is sup
posed, -his jealousy was fired by drink.
When the police kicked in the door of the
room, Baxter drew a razor across his own
throat ' He was a powerful man, and be
fore the officers could club the weapon out
of his hands, he indicted six deep and
ugly wounds upon himself, and fell to the
floor in an unconscious state. '.':â 
': Coroner Cornelius, . however, does not
think that Baxter's injuries are necessarily
fatal. He was taken to the Good Samari
tan Hospital, and the remains of his victim
are now at the morgue. '
â :.: Both had been drinking heavily to-day,
and ; at .' 7 o'clock this evening they were
seen crossing Bnrnside-street bridge in an
intoxicated condition. The woman wanted
to return to the West Side, and a quarrel
ensued, which resulted in' her death an'
hour later., " ./
'The people in the house know very little
of the couple, but give it as their opinion
that the man was inordinately jeanlous of
his wife. â¢ They also say that at times he
acted as if he had been mentally unbal
anced.,
The only surviving eye-witness to the
bloody - . affair was .'their " four-year-old
daughter, Edna. ' She is a bright . child,
as yet incapable of realizing, the enormity
of . what ; has ; befallen " her. ;< She said:
"Mamma and papa had a quarrel, and he
struck ' her *in : the > face, which â¢ made the
blood come,' and she fell on . the floor. â¢ I
asked papa if mamma was dead and be
said 'no.' We then ; botn kissed her and
papa began to cry." \ ':..y''. ,

LECTURE ON THE DON PARTY
Knights of Pythias to Give a Dress
Parade and Drill in Honor of
the Carnival.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Feb. 6.â The nights
continue cold and the ice king is in his
glory. Spraying is carried on assiduously,
and sprays of water are quickly converted
into a glistening sheet of ice. Skating and
tobogganing goes merrily on and devotees
of these sports are rapidly on the increase.
No one who attempts either will fail to try
it a second time, and after a person has
taken his first trip down the toboggan
slide and glided over the smooth surface
of icy ponds he is an enthusiast.
Saturday and Sunday will see the gayest
crowd of the carnival. Although each day
is of itself a sort of holiday, these days will
eclipse any thine that has as yet' trans
pired. Three hundred people from Truckee
alone will be skating, tobogganing arid
coasting, and it will indeed be a grand
sight. â¢' â :â¢.':.':;.
Much interest is being manifested over
the lecture to be given by William G.
Murphy on Saturday night. The largest
nail in town has been engaged, and Mr.
Murphy will be feted by a number ' of
prominent citizens.
The road to Lake Tahoe is now as
smooth as glass, and to-day an excursion
party, the first party that has ever had an
opportunity of viewing this beautiful body
of water in winter, took advantage of the
conditions and made the trip. About five
hours is consumed in making the return
trip, but it is time well spent, and : one
feels fully repaid for the time and small
expense connected with this interesting
journey.
Telegrams and letters engaging rooms
for Saturday and Sunday are being re
ceived, and there is now no doubt about

FIRE AT SAN BERNARDINO
Lodging-House Â and a Private
Residence Adjoining Destroyed
hy the Flames.
Several People Narrowly Escape With
Their Livesâ Loss Between
$2000 and $3000.
SAN- BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 6.â
What came near being ' a fatal fire oc
curred this morning at 12:25. An alarm of
fire came in from box 25 announcing the
fact that a conflagration was taking place.
The alarm was occasioned by a fire being
discovered in a lodging-house on Kingman
street, near the Santa Fe depot. A light
wind was blowing, and before the depart
ment could reach the fire the building
was entirely destroyed, as was a private
residence adjoining.
The lodging-house was . a large frame
building and was a relic of boom days. At
the time* of its destruction it Was being
run by a Mrs. Taber. It so happened that
at the time of the fire Mrs. Taber was
alone in the house and in bed. Her first
indication of danger was when she was
awakened by the roar of the flames and
smell of smoke. She jumped from her
bed and rushed toward the door, when the
flames broke through and drove her back.
She rushed -to the window of -her room",
but was unable to raise 7 it. The flames
were now almost upon her. Becoming
desperate â  she drove her fists through the
window panes, clearing away the glass
and jumping out. Nothing" was saved
from the building, and her timely notice
to her neighbors probably saved their
lives, as they barely got out. The total
loss is between $2000 and $3000.- .

that on the mere assertion of a few Chinese

they have practically destroyed, they were

beef and mutton :in Chinatown once.

that the Board of Trade adopted the reso

Chinese. $50 for each offense. This was
July 29, # Before that, 1895, I made

a plunge forward, rah smash into another

s iSPOKE FOR HIS CHURCH
Rev. Philip O'Ryan j Lectures on |
! Her Influence on Civil
ization.
BEFORE THE READING CIRCLES.
The Eloquent â Priest Shows That the
Catholic Church Led Nations
Onward.
The audience that filled Metropolitan
Hall last night heard the first public lec
ture of Rev. Philip O'Ryan, and â¢ showed
by its unbounded signs of approval that
the discourse was sincerely appreciated.
Father O'Ryan spoke on "The Church and
Rev. Father Philip O'Ryan, the Orator at Metropolitan Temple Last Evening.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
Civilization." His lecture was an eloquent
and scholarly exposition of the noble part
which the Catholic church has taken
through the centuries in developing and
influencing civilization, in art, literature
and the sciences, while maintaining its
prerogative over the spiritual guidance of
its people. He is still quite a young man, j
hut full of promise, a graduate of the j
Catholic University in Washington, D. C, |
\ who, through this masterful effort at the j
threshold of his career, has won a place in
the esteem and respect of the Catholic
people of San Francisco.
Much interest was manifested in Father
()' Ryan's lecture. He is already well
known as the editor of ' the Monitor, as
successor to the youthful though brilliant
Father Yorke. and those present last night
were carried away by the eloquence, force
and scholarship of his maiden address.
Very Rev. J. j. Prendergast, vicar general
of the archdiocese of San Francisco, occu
pied the chair, and Father Wyniau,
6uperiorof the Paulists in California. Rev.
J. Byrne, and other priests were on the
platform:
The speaker in his open>ne words said
never before were such rapid strides made
in civilization. Through the whole social
system has progressed the magnetic cur
rent that stimulated all to progress. Edu
cation has come upon the world and been
effective. But the powers back of this
century are intellectual and moral. Suc
cess fills men with pride and they too
often attribute it to themselves. Still,
progress after all is only progressâ a de
velopment. Centuries ago its fruit was
reapedâ the harvest that the dead have
sown â the dead, forgotten and un
known.
The speaker said his lecture would ex
amine what the church had to do with this
development, with civilization.
On close examination the earlier civili
zation was found to contain the elements
of ruin and decay. Slavery was the cor
nerstone upon which the mighty fabric
rested. The Roman law never developed
the man. So when the Romans settled
down to enjoy the -fruits of conquest the
morals of the people had degenerated, dis
appeared. New life was needed, and that
new life was to come from the scene of the
first Christian struggleâ from the Holy
Land.
To regenerate this society was the great
work which the church" had before her.
The church from the beginning set her
face against slavery. She taught that all
men were equal, thus laying the founda
tion for" universal liberty, for democracy.
The church taught the true work of life
and the true dignity of humanity.
Constantine revised the old Roman law.
This was of paramount importance, for,
though Roman law was to be overthrown,
it was at the bottom of all codes. The
church ". purified it. Constantine abol
ished gladiatorial combats, slavery.
The church from the beginning set her
face against slavery. For the redemption
of slaves did St. Gregory use riches to pur
chase freedom of slaves. Even Voltaire is
forced to cry out in admiration of Alex
ander 111, who proclaimed that ail men
should be free. 9P a &&6G&WÃÂ§&&sÂ£&^
At the end of the fifth century the great
migration of races took place, and they all
fell upon Romeâ upon the Roman
pireâ and were it not for the church of
God they would have swept away all civili
zation. -Only â¢ one place afforded protec
tion to the citizens, and that was the
church. When a Goth desecrated the sa-.
credness of a virgin of the church he was
called to account and his outrage decried.
It was left to a barbarian of this time to
insult her. VPSHPQSSfBVP'BBHp
The lecturer quoted various incidents to
show what influence the church had upon
the old civilization, and then," continuing,
stated that the old Roman civilization died
away, and settled upon Spain, Italy and
the other Latin countries, and without the
influence of the church; the civilization of
these countries would not have developed
into the beautiful civilization of after
years. \
he two great -rules of tbe church have
been legislation and education. This law,
â¢"pht into Germany by ti:e missionaries
li the Catholic church, was a new "beacon
"gut to that people, who without the in
fluence and the teachings of the church
barbar* not then have progressed from their
barbarism.
Even enemies of the church must admit
tnat were it Â, . or â â  the- episcopal and
SS VI C , MtablisbmSbta of the church let
i-tLL? u,d have dsed out in Europe. Moll
is,? i!,?'" tbe cent** of enlightenment
and learning. J The monks penetrated into
BOW lands, and wherever they went they
were tne pioneers of a hew cause and* new
civilization. "When feudalism and rebel
lion showed their head in Europe, it was
the Pope of Rome: who rose to suppress
them. - , â¢..:â  â  ,
Referring to the controversy between
Frederick Barbarossa* and Alexander 111
the lecturer 7 said that the Pope made the
lofty tyrant sue for peace. This showed
the spirit of the papacy in the twelfth cen
tury. Were it not for the Popes letters and
literature would have died out at this time.
The church established 118 universitiesâ
72. before and 46 after the Reformation.
The sects, with all -the. money of the
states, have established only 31. .
Turning to Ireland Father O'Ryan said
that site would never be accused of want
of loyalty to the vicar of Christ on earthâ
the sovereign Pontiff. And when Ireland
was most Catholic her schools were re
nowned throughout the civilized world
and her monks bore the torch of learning
into benighted lands.
The church fostered the printing press,
and before the end of the century marking
the discovery of printing close to 1000 books
were published from presses in Catholic
institutions. â 
It would be impossible to show that the
church has been opposed to scientific re
search, for the church and science went
hand in hand. Referring to Galileo, the
speaker claimed that the old story that
the astronomer had been imprisoned for
saying ihe earth was round was false.
I Galileo was punished for misinterpretation
of the Scriptures. Nothing is said, by men
I who bring up this Galileo story about the
| Danish Protestant astronomer who was
I told by a council of stale that his scientific
I work was obnoxious, and who then turned
; to Rudolf, the Catholic . ruler of Austria.
| The Popes gave their approval to Galileo,
I and it was a Pope who took up and estab
lished the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
Thus the Catholic- church has been the
keeper of art and science. :
To-day is heard the cry from Armenia
the cry unheeded. It was not so when
Europe was Catholic. From the very be
ginning of Mohammedanism it tried to
crush out the civilization of Christianity.
The results of Mohammedan rule in Eu
rope were reviewed. Some of the coun
tries affected are, as Father Ryan said,
but the memory of a name. Thecrusades
were organized by the Popes, and the cru
sades saved Europe from Mohammedan
rule, and . they gave Europe many other
benefits. All historians agree that these
crusaders were the victdrs over despotism.
The crescent forever waned in the horizon
and was buried in the red waters of Le
panto.
The Catholic church preserved letters,
patronized art, has been "in the vanguard
of civilization, and she holds the same
place to-day. .
There are those who say her days of use
fulness are over; but they know not of
her place in the world. > She has nothing
to fear from the - enlightenment of the
nineteenth century. The needs of this
century have as much use of her as any
former century. She alone, as in all ages,
has defended . and can alone uphold the
bulwark of humanityâ the sacreduess of
the marriage ties. She alone has never
parted with her birthright for a mess of
pottage. The Roman Pontiff has ; been
advocating the rights of humanity
through all ages. Leo XIII has thrown
open the library of the Vatican to show
the world what the Catholic church has
done for humanity. â  The Catholic church
to-day is a pillar of light for advancing hu
manity.
Father Ramm, a graduate of - Berkeley
University and the Catholic University at
Washington, and a convert to Catholicity,
will speak this evening.
A CARELESS GRIPMAN.
He Causes His Car to Plunge
Ahead, Injuring a Pas
senger.
The Victim Severely Hurt ,in the
Brain and Spine and Not Likely â¢
to Recover.
Miss Lou Reddan, living at 311 Taylor
street, was thrown against an iron struct
ure on car 37 of the California-street cable
railway yesterday, and received injuries
that may prove fatal.
She was riding on the after end of the
car, and as it was slowly mounting the
hill on Jones street, near Sutter, the grip
man, James Cummings, feeling J the cable
slipping through his grip, took a quick
fresh hold on the rope, and the car sud
denly shot ahead. The movement jammed
all the passengers; back toward the- rear,
and a heavy woman falling against Miss
Reddan hurled her down on the stanchion
with terrible force. " *.
". The back of her head struck the iron bar
and she fell senseless to the ground. 7 .
The " unconscious ; girl - was first carried
into the office ; of j Dr. Herzstein * and : then
sent home in the ambulance. 'Drs. Terrill
and Anderson were called and found her
partially paralyzed from ; the effect of the
shock on the base of the brain. She Anally
regained i consciousness, but is deaf, and
J from the injury to her ppine cannot move
; her body.- ; Dr. Terrill considers "the case
quite serious and is in doubt as to the
result. '- '"'^^BWBBffiW^W^y^^*
-'â  From ; the .statement of . the passengers
the act of Gripman Curamings was a most
reckless one and there seems to have been
no reason for his so doing. There was no
impending ? accident sor Â£ collision causing
him to grip the cable and lunge the car
suddenly" forward. : It 7 was !i carelessness,
pure and simple. . ;

his flag, and, barring. a couple of , tedious
delays,:; sent the â  fields j away in his usual
masterly fashion. .. ;. : : ; . .is. :.*
Eleven of the baby division sported silk
in the | three and a ; half furlong ; dash : for
two-year-olds, which I headed the card. 7' A
surprise awaited the f talent. I Tho I Hobart
pair, Investigator and The Sinner, carried
most of the coin at 6 to 5,' but Zamar, an 8
to 1 chance, led all the way,' and won by. a
length from Colonel 'Wheeler, with In
vestigator finishing in the show."
Eleven : selling-platers- lined up in the
six-furlone dash that followed. : Clacquer
was a decided favorite over, the; field; the
books holding him at 3to 2. The race re
sulted in- a very pretty finish, Clacquer,
Minnie '. Ccc and The i Judge : passing the
wire heads apart/ with the favorite, who
was away from the ; post poorly, in front. i
The bookmakers took a hard fall out of
the crowd on the mile run, for which Mr.
Macdonough's imported filly, Santa Bella,
was a hot choice, backed from 8 to 5 to 3
to' 2. Logan was a firm second choice at
threes, with the Cambridge stable duo,
Perseus and Yankee Doodle, next , in de
mand. Doggett, on Ferner, hustled his
mount out in the lead, but after showing
the way for . something over half the dis
tance had enough, and gave way to the
Cambridge stable's pair, who struck the
stretch on nearly equal terms, closely fol
lowed by Terrier, Santa ] Bella and Logan.
Chorn, on the latter, , now began riding
hard, and a furlong r from â > home / was in
front, and drawing away won cleverly by
a couple of lengths. Yankee i Doodle beat
his stable companion, Perseus, out a head
for -the place, with the favorite a good
fourth.
The colors of W. 08. Macdoncugh were
seen in front for the second time in the
mile and a half;, hurdle event. That
royally bred counterfeit on the flat, Bur
mah, was in with 131 pounds up, and the
books 'laid 3 to 5 against "him for a very
little. Jerry Mara had the mount, and a
more pleasant ride be never had, winning
as he pleesed by a length and a broad
grin, with Tom Clarke in the place. Mc-
Govern fell at the fourth jump, slightly
injuring his rider. .::. % - ' ". -
W. L. Stanrield's "Kansas City Hindoo,"
the very useful bay horse George Miller,
again placed ': a winning bracket ito his
credit in the seven-furlong run.' The: bet
ting favored -Ed ; Kearney, Olive ; and :< Gal
land, the first named horse ruling a" slight
favorite at 11 to 5. Miller was as good as
5 tol. r ;7'77 : â â¢v ; Vv7-7, : "" ; '-.-â¢â :;"â¢ -"7 â
The start was a very fair one. Coady on
George Miller was first to show clear, and
was never - but once ! headed ' during ' the
journey, and that at the half, where Sweet
Rose temporarily poked her head in front.
The Kansas Hindoo .finished strong in the
stretch, passing the judges a length in ad
â¢ vance of Olive. ;' In a' hard drive Gallant
took third place from Ed Kearney by a
nose.
The. talent was badly dumped on the
final race of the day, a six-furiong sprint.
Old Toano was a heavily backed 6 to 5
favorite, but 'had one of ' "his off-days and
tailed to get a number. Tod Sloan on the
6 to I shot Levena C succeeded in getting a
running start, and, never headed, crossed
the line three ; lengths ahead :of Boreas,
who made a great from the far rear.
Schnitz, at 6 to 1, was third. "".-,'
Track and Paddock Items.
Sixteen regular and two field books ac
commodated bettors at the ; track yester
day. â¢
Had Bobolink won the "to let" sign
would no doubt have* been prominently
displayed on several bookmakers' stands.
Mr. Wibaux, the Montana speculator,
stood to make a fortune ;on him. The
horse was backed down , from 100 to 20 to 1
and ran like a cart horse.
By actual count -3685 ladies viewed the
racing yesterday. â 
Pittsburg Phil lost a big chunk of coin
on his horse, Ed Kearny. He went to the
post full of life and his friends expected to
see him do some record breaking, but he
performed disappointingly.
Toano's running did not suit the critical
eye of the judges, and his owner is wanted
in the stand at 12:30 o'clock to-day to ex
plain his poor showing. The assistant
starter proved such an: adept with his
whip that he will be called before the
stewards at 1 o'clock to show cause why
he did not take a "swipe" or two at some
of the other boys as well as Pigeott alone.
And lastly Morey; who rode Esperance,
was suspended for putting up a ride that
would do credit to a man under the in
fluence of dope.
It seems as though officials in the stand
are prone to single out some old horse that
has seen many years' duty on the track,
owned by some struggling owner, to hold
up as a horrible example. Toano is a vet
eran; he is not as young as he was; his
legs are under suspicion, and no one
familiar with racehorses and their ills
looks to see him perform with the degree
of consistency expected of a younger and
more sound horse. Other horses at short
odds have failed to get to the wire in front.
Then why single out Toaro? > ;
Gordius, who has been turned out at
pasturage on , the Donahue ranch, will
shortly be taken up and put in training.
Ed Purser, who has been playing in
rather poor form of late, made a "killing"
over George Miller's win.
The Governor Budd selling sweepstakes
for all ages, one and a half miles, to be
run on Saturday, will be a great event.
The best long-distance horses on the track
will face the issue.
Tod Sloan was fined $50 for violating
the jockey-room rule, which prohibits the
boy a from wandering around in the
region of the betting-room between races.
Frank Taylor now has Royal Flush in
his string, the Owens Brothers, it is said,
having disposed of him.. Sir Richard and
Major Coo<t have been sent to B. C.
Holly's Vallejo ranch to rest up.
FOR A SEWER SYSTEM.
Mayor Sutro Argues Before the Street
Committee.
Mayor Sutro was before the Street Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors yester
day to urge that a general system of sew
ers be adopted for the ; region south of
Golden Gate Park rather than that inde
pendent and fragmentary sewers be put
doWr..
Residents and other small property
owners urged immediate relief for cer
tain quarters. They declared that in
many places their ; houses had been
swamped during the recent rains and that
they could not endure another winter with
present conditions ; that if : they had to
wait until a complete system of sewers
was devised and put down their property
would be mined. : '
The Mayor said that the main portion of
the City was suffering from imperfect
sewerage caused by an absence of system,
and this state of affairs should not be ex
tended to the suburbs in face of this ex
perience; that it would be a waste of
money.

Eastern States are rapidly preparing for
the coming conventions, and it is time for
the Pacific Coast to be getting ready.
California is trying to keep the law, en
force it and exalt it, while the monopoly is
trying to dodge it, break it and degrade it.

Republicans should remember that non

Cleveland has piled up a big bundle of
debts for Uncle Sam, and the old man had
better sit down on it now, and see that no
more is added to the pile.
The quickest way to achieve an inter
national reputation at this time is to dis
cover an old map of . Venezuela some

he is just enough of an ass to like it.

. The success of the popular loan carries
with it a condemnation of the former syn
dicate deal, and Cleveland should cer
tainly be made to explain why he did not
appeal to the people before.
The new bond deal has been a big suc
cess for the Government, but as some of
the bidders have to pay much higher prices
than others for the same goods the ques
tion arises, *Ms it a fair deal ?"
The paradox of getting the Fire Depart
ment to enter politics in order to keep out
of it involves the further paradox that
those of the department who fire up for
politics are liable to be fired out.
According to Chicago estimates Senator
Allison is the second choice of the friends
of all other Republican candidates for the
Presidency, and if this be true it means
i that he is virtually the first choice of the
party as a whole.
Great Britain recognizes the sovereienty
of Brazil over the island of Trinidad; but
' Brazil will permit Great Britain to use it
as a coaling station, and it won't be long
before the Brazilians learn that power
, goes with the coal.
A Chicago society has sent out a circular
asking, "What is your opinion of war as a
mode of . deciding controversies \ between
the United States and Great Britain ?" and
we have to answer that while the mode is
a liltle old-fashioned it is generally effec
tive and always saves talk. :*
. Some bidders for the new loan offered as
high as 119 and a fraction â¢ for small
amounts, while the Morgan syndicate will
get about half of the whole loan for a little
over 110. The difference in the price
shows the advantage of the syndicate. Mr.
Morgan is in it and the other fellow is out.

The evidence given in an Illinois court
that at least one Chicago clothing-house
has been selling clothing made in Sing
Sing 'l prison while smallpox was raging
among the convicts illustrates the need of
an interstate sanitary law. It :is not fair
that : one : State' should be permitted to get
rid of such dangerous goods by distribut
ing them all over the country through the
medium of ' the wholesale houses of an
other State. 7
Senator Vest says, "I would rather put
the flower in the sickroom of an over
worked girl or matron than have it said I
voted $110,000 for flowers and â  exotics ; : for
the receptions and bouquets of the officials
of the Government where the ; chandelier
flashes its : light across the . red wine and
the air is fragrant with perfume like the
spicy breezes of Araby the Blest." The'
sentiment is all right and r' the politics ;is
good; yet the old ; question arises, "Is .it

"KENTUCKIANS TO THE FRONT.
The fight now being made in Frankfort
to â¢ repeal the franchise of the Southern
Pacific Company affords to Kentuckians
living in California an opportunity -to
render an important service to the.
people of both States. , By letters and by
newspapers they can inform their rela
tives and friends in Kentucky of the actual
condition of affairs here, ana thus form in
that State a well-grounded sentiment in
favor of repealing the franchise which is
at once an injury to California and a dis
grace to Kentucky.
There can be no doubt of the- effective
ness of the work that can be done in this
way. To brine about a repeal of the
monopoly franchise it is necessary only to
give the people of Kentucky a full under
standing of ail that it signifies to them
and to us. We must conduct at once
a vigorous campaign of education on
the subject, and it can be carried on
with much greater success by Ken
tuckians in California than by any one
else. The monopoly lobby will per
sistently dispute and deny the statements
of the California press and of the commit
tee of fifty, and many Kentuckians in the
face of such persistent denials may hesi
tate to believe the statements of 'those
whom they do not know, but they will not
hesitate in regard to what is said by their
own kinsmen and friends. ''These there
fore are the persons upon whom Califor
nia must largely rely at this time, and
they should prove themselves worthy of
that reliance by putting forth their best
efforts to rouse Kentucky sentiment to the
fighting point.
In carrying, on this campaign of educa
tion every Kentuckian in California can
do something. It is not necessary, that he
should be acquainted with a member of
the Legislature, or that he should write
directly to any member. Let him write to
his friends. in Kentucky to use their in
fluence in forming a sentiment at their
own homes, and that sentiment will soon
make itself known at the State capital.
If in every legislative district in Ken
tucky there are men engaged actively in
forming public opinion against the mo
nopoly and its methods of business and
politics, the representatives at Frankfort
will not be long in coming to the conclu
sion that it will not be safe to defy that
opinion for the sake of rendering a service
to a corrupt corporation already hastening
to its doom. ' â  - â¢
There are thousands of Kentuckians in
California. All of them have friends of
more or less influence in their former
homes. Appeals from them would reach
every, legislative â¢ district in the State.
What they assert would have a weight far
greater than anything that can be said
by persons unknown in Kentucky. Friend
ship counts for something. It is the
greatest power known among men. Let
the Kentuckians in California set that
power in motion and the State of their
birth will erase a disgraceful franchise
from her statute-books, and the land of
tbeir adoption will be rid of a corrupting
monopoly. â 
VEST'S BITTER SPEECH.
Some allowance should be made for the
chagrin of the Senate in observing with
what contumely its silver substitute bill
has been treated by the House when we
approach the task of dissecting the fierce
speech of Senator Vest on the joint resolu
tion demanding that the Secretary of
Agriculture obey the law requiring him to
make a distribution of seeds and bulletins
to farmers. But in spite of its bitterness
and rancor, the speecn made some telling
points.
Mr. Vest was deeply incensed because,
while these seeds had been withheld, there
has been an expenditure of $110,000 during,
the past year for palms, orchids and
bouquets with which the President deco
rated the White House on occasions of
pomp. This deeply offends the Democratic
spirit of the old warhorse from Missouri.
But it does not rouse him so deeply as the
vigorous work which Secretary Morton
has done to bolster up the financial policy
of the administration/ This minor mem
ber of the Cabinet has made himself ob
noxious in many ways, especially in
adopting an attitude that is utterly incon
sistent with the broadly democratic
duties of his department. He is the one
member of the Cabinet whose duties re
quire him to stand in close intimacy, with
the people, and especially with the agri
cultural interests of the country, to en
courage their efforts and foster their
interests, and to use his whole influence
with the administration to that end. .
â  He has misseo that important function
entirely, and devoted himself instead to
the money interests of the country. 7He
has, neglected his own duties and im
pertinently intruded himself into matters
antagonistic to them, and his mischievous
activity is rendered all the more potent by
his shrewdness and ability. It is remark
able with what apparent â¢ indifference the
President is observing these attacks on his
functionary, for it is he who is responsible
for Secretary Morton's acts.
This indifference to the interests of agri
culture in this country comes at an inop
portune time, for the farming industry' is
at a low ebb and in "'. need of protection and
encouragement. The distribution of seeds
may not ' seem a very important matter,
but as it is the means, in connection with
bulletins which Mr. Morton has neglected
to issue, which the Government estab-

A FORMIDABLE LOBBY.
The most conspicuous feature of the
funding-bill flight is the railroad lobby at
Washington. Its presence and operations
have a : special interest j when considered
along with the lucia letters which â  Mr.
Huntington, the central figure of the
lobby, wrote to his partner, Colton, about
the time when Tom Scott ; was try
ing to secure the right ' to build a road
through the southern part of the country. .
An equally efficient arid industrious Hunt
ington lobby is at work in Frankfort, Ky.,
trying to defeat ':. the bill repealing the
charter of the Southern Pacific Company.
James Bryce, in . his "American '; Com
mon wealth," has something interesting to
say of lobbying in general aud of ; Mr;
Huntington Â£as a [ lobbyist In V particular.
He declares, for instance, that "I lobbying is
declared by the laws of California to be a
felony and by those of -. Georgia :to be a
crime, but. fails to add the information
that it was the operations of Mr"; Hunting
ton's lobby in the California Legislature
that made the creation "of such a law a
necessity. 7 7-- .7"-': '-â¢-'.'â >;
Again he says:- "It is particularly, hard";
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1896.
to discover the truth about Congress, for
few of the abundant suspicions excited and
accusations brought' against Senators and
members of the House have been, or could
have been, sifted to the bottom. Among
400 men there will be the clean and the
unclean. The I opportunities for private
gain are large ; the chances of detection
small. No small part of the business of
.Congress is what would be called in Eng
land private business, and although the
individual railroads which come directly
into relation with the Federal Government
are not numerousâ the great transconti
nental lines which have received land
grants or other subventions are the most
importantâquestions affecting these roads
do frequently come up and involve large
amounts of money." %7
Becoming then more personal, and of all
the railroad men in the United States se
lecting C. P. Huntington for presentation,
the author proceeds: "Bribery often takes
the form of a transfer of stocks or shares,
nor have even free passes on railroads been
scorned by some of the more needy legis
lators. The abuse on this head had grown
so serious that the bestowal of passes on
interstate lines was forbidden by statute
in 1887. In the end of 1883 portions of a
correspondence in the years 1876-78
between Mr. Huntington, one of the
pioprietors and directors of the Central
Pacific Railroad, who then represented
that powerful corporation at Washington,
and one of his agents in California, were
published; and from â¢ these it appeared
that the company, whose land grants were
frequently threatened by hostile bills and
which was exposed to the competition of
rival enterprises, which (because they. Were
to run through Territories) Congress was
asked to sanction, defended itself by con
stant dealings with Senators and Repre
sentativesâdealings in the course of which
it offered money and bonds to those whose
support it needed. 7 Mr. Huntington com
ments freely on the character of members
of both houses, and describes not only his
own operations, but those of Mr. Scott, his
able and active opponent, who had the
great advantage of being able to command
passes on some railways running out of
Washington." Bryce then quotes from
these letters and from the report of the
Pacific Railway Commission in substanti
ation of his position.
This formidable lobby, the most power
ful that this country has ever seen, is at
work now both at Washington and Frank
fort, and the issues are far more vital than
those which existed when Mr. Huntington
was engaged in spending, according to the
Pacific Railroad Commission, $4,818,000 in
"influencing legislation." '
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.
Last season Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Ex
press Company sent several hundred small
boxes of California -oranges as presents to
eminent residents of the Eastern States
and this year it proposes to send similarly
a greatly reduced number. Why the bur
den of this most excellent plan for adver
tising the superiority of our fruits was
permitted to fall wholly on the express
company is a matter that has not yet been
explained. The absence of seconding
efforts on the part of growers is made all
the more conspicuous by the fact that the
bulk of our fruits is shipped by means
other than the express company.
The idea of such a distribution i 3 so ad
mirable that it should be put in force on a
large scale. Likely it would properly come
within the province of the State Develop
ment Committee, but as the expense would
be very great if the plan should be carried
out on a sufficient scale the growers and
transportation companies might well con
tribute generously to the scheme.
The packages sent out would be an elo
quent proof of statements made in the
printed matter which it is proposed to dis
tribute. A reasonable exercise of wisdom
in the selection of articles and the persons
to whom they are to be given could be
made a valuable adjunct of the proposed
free lessons to be given on the preparation
of California dried fruits for the ; table.
The packages should be very small and
attractively put up, and printed instruc
tions for cooking should accompany them.
There is one branch of the California
fruit industry that needs advertising and
development. This is glace fruits. It is
somewhat remarkable that this most de
licious of all confects is not better known.
We know of but one establishment in San
Francisco where the preparation of glace
fruits is carried on with an approach to a
conception of its importance, and there
are very few elsewhere in the State. The
consumption of the product is largely
local, apparently no efforts having been
made to popularize it in the Eastern States.
Undoubtedly the present supply is as
great as the demand, but we can well
imagine to what proportions the demand
would grow under a better knowledge of
the article. - As one of the higher and
finer industries associated with the fruit
industry it yields a large profit, and the
field for an extension of the business by
intelligent industry is unlimited.
Samples of other fine products might be
distributed. The syrup of Muscat grapes,
for instance, is - far better than any other,
for table use except, possibly, maple syrup.
Its excellence needs only to be known in
order that a large demand for it shall
exist. Thus the : subject of advertising by
means of samples assumes 'large propor
tions and offers a promising field for profit
able labor in extending our market.

FOUR-FOOTED BIRDS.
; : Nothing in the realm of natural history in late
years excells in interest â¢_ the announcement
Of the discovery in British Guiana of a bird with
four legs, says the Popular Science News. 7 The
crested hoatzini opisthocomus 'cristatus7',the
only survivor of a race of birds,' several of which
are known as fossils, inhabits the most secluded
parts of the forests of South America, and it is
probable that it is owing to its retiring habits
that it has outlived its" congeners, as well as to
THE FOUR-FOOTED BIRDS OF BRITISH GUIANA.
the fact that, feeding as it does upon wild
arum leaves, its flesh acquires- so offensive a
smell and flavor as to have gained it the name
of stink bird, and to render It entirely unfit for
food. It is a large bird, almost as large ns a
peacock, in fact, but is very seldom seen.
Oftener its loud, wailing cry is heard. . .
The chief peculiarity of the hoatzin .consists
in the fact that when it is hatched it possesses
four welWdeveloped legs, the front pair being
of a reptilian character. The young birds leave
the nest and climb about like monkeys over
the adjoining limbs and twigs, and act and
look more like tree toads than birds. ' After
hatching the modification of the fore limbs be
gins, the claws of the digits falling off, and the
whole of the claw-like hands becoming flat
tened, changes into wings. After this modifi
cation has taken place feathers begin to grow,
and in a short time not a vestige remains of its
original character. As Professor F. A. Lucas,
in au admirable monograph on "Spurs and
Claws" in a bulletin of the Smithsonian Insti
tution, says: "The adult birds not only have no
claws upon their wings, but their thumbs, even,
are so poorly developed that one would hardly
suspect that in the nestlings we have the near
est approach to a quadruped found among
existing birds. Mr. J. J. Quelch, who
studied them in British Guiana, tells us that
soon after the hatching the well-developed
claws on the pollax and index are constantly
in use for hooking and holding on to surround
ing objects. The nestlings, when quite small,
are frequently found far away from any nest,
climbing by the help of their clawed wings
after the parent birds during feeding time.
One curious feature noticed with a nestling
which had been upset in the river was its
power of rapid swimming and diving when
pursued. As soon as the hand was placed on
it it dived rapidly in the dark water, in which
it was impossible to see it, and arose at dis
tances more than a yard away. Owing to this
power the little creature managed to evade all
efforts to secure it, taking refuge eventually
under the bushy growth, when it was impossi
ble to pursue it. The prolonged immersion
which a nestling will undergo, instinctively
and voluntarily, or which an adult bird will
endure in an attempt" to drown It, seems quite
remarkable.'.' ?.â â ,,:-. i â .--: . - ,

ENGINEERS FOR THE NAVY.
The United States navy is to-day in a pecu
liar situation. The Government maintains at
Annapolis an institution for the education of
naval officers, but owing to the character of
its training or the tastes and prejudices of the
cadets, out of an average of thirty graduates
a year not more than eight or ten men go into
the engineer corps, where they are needed,
while the line is crowded. with young offi
cers. With the development of the modern
cruiser and battle-ship , the . demand for en
gineers has Increased without there being
a corresponding * change .: in the dispo
sition of the men who '.- enter the ser
vice. The tradition of the sailor persists not
withstanding the decrease . in his relative im
portance in naval warfare, and the academy
continues to turn out classes mostly made up
of line officers, while the engineer-in-chief of
the navy pleads for more men in his branch of
the service in order that our vessels maybe
kept in readiness for action. Even now engi
neers are in demand, and :in case of sudden
need of an increased navy we should find ex
treme difficulty in getting them to do the most
important work on the new vesselsâ
which almost more then any other in the navy
re ires careful early training. \ â :
With a view to meeting this condition Rep
resentative Francis 11. Wilson of this State has
introduced into the House a - naval bill which
is likely to stir up the old difference â  between
line and staff, for it sacrifices some of the old
traditions for the sake of raising up a body of
men sufficient to care for the machinery of our
ships in emergency.- The bill-places in the
hands of the engineer-in-chief the inspection
of steel for the ships lof â¢ the ; new navy, thus
seeking to avoid any repetition of I the troubles
which have occurred over steel inspection in
the last few years." It permits the i staff officer
to : rise to the >. rank of commodore. , It allows
staff officers â¢.to v, retire after - thirty
live years' - service. ;: It gives â¢ substantial
encouragement to enlisted men: to work for
commissions. â  Most " important \of ..:- all, it
provides for | the j training of i engineers lin
private institutions. "â ; The Navy Department is
to detail to every scientific school which shall
pledge itself to educate marine .\ engineers
under regulations established by the depart
ment an engineer to be professor of marine en
gineering and naval architecture. ~ This will
enable the schools to ; fill the â  staff vacancies
which the academy leaves," and t also educate a
reserve force of engineers, who would be of
great service should a | sudden j increase of our
fle ~K be necessary at any time. ' V â¢â- -
; This bill is understood to have been prepared
under the supervision of .prominent I naval en
gineering authorities, and to have the support
01 the heads of some of the leading technical
schools, In this age of machinery the engineer
must play a greater part than our present naval
practice provides for, and the bill brought for
ward by Mr. Wilson appears on its surfaces to
solve some pressing problems, and merits seri
ous consideration.â New York Tribune.

OUR FRIEND, THE ENEMY.
In addressing the Senate Committee on Pa
cific Railroads in support of his Pacific debt
funding scheme. Collis P. Huntington sar
castically stigmatized Mayor Sutro of ' San
Francisco as "our friend, the enemy,"' who
has flooded this Congress with "stuff not worth
talking about." ,
It is in accord with the eternal fitness of
things that the head and front of the Southern
Pacific octopus should seek to brush away the
remonstrances of the people of California
against the perpetuation of the legalized ex
tortion to which they. have been subjected for
a quarter of a century as stuff not worth talk
ing about. It is no less characteristic of the â¢
tactics of the chief highwayman of the band
that has | exploited the Central Pacific road by
absorbing its governmental patrimony and
diverting its traffic to ascribe mercenary mo-
tives â to Mayor Sutro and brand him as an
enemy. . â <
An enemy of whom? Certainly not an enemy
of the people of California,' or for lhat matter
of the people of any part of the United States.
Mr. Huntington would' have the country be
lieve that the only motive animating the chief
executive of San Francisco in this contest is a
personal grievance, based on the refusal of the
great railway potentate to build for him an
eight-mile railroad to one of his pet estates.
That is an insult to American intelligence.
Mr. Huntington would gladly build a dozen
eight-mile branches as the 'price of sidetrack
ing Sutro and the issue which has raised such
a storm on the Pacific Coast.
The stigma, "our friend, the enemy," in the
sense in which Mr. Huntington Intended to ap
ply it, has been used time and again by con
struction ringsters and Credit Mobilier wreck
ers against men and communities that have
stood in their paths or sought to thwart their
schemes. From their standpoint everybody
is a public enemy who refuses to pay
tribute on demand without '-' a murmur,
or who ; defends -â - public rights against
the onslaughts of corporate greed. In this
controversy as to the settlement of the Pacific
railroad debt, : Mayor Sutro '-. of San . Francisco
cannot be accused of ,maliciously!or vindict
ively flooding Congress with "stuff not worth
talking about." The matter at issue involves
not merely $200,000,000, but the welfare and
future prosperity of millions of people. It is
not a quarrel between one man and a corpora
tion, but a struggle of the country dependent
on the Pacific railroads as public carriers for

As the embodiment of "our friend, the
enemy," Mayor Sutro ; merely represents an
overwhelming, : unpurchasable and Irre
pressible sentiment..- We take it that the
Chamber ot | Commerce of Francisco is not
swayed : by the ;â¢ personal s caprice of , any one
man, -or by 'enemity to the Pacific railroads,
which are and must remain the great arteries
of their commerce. And yet this body on Janu
ary .21 adopted the following : resolutions as
expressive of its demands upon Congress:
- Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco, having under consideration all the con
ditions involved, and having reference to the
message - of the I President of the United States to
the Fiftieth Congress, recommending the Govern
ment to secure Itself by legal process against
financial loss in its relations with the subsidized
overland railroads, urgently. protests against the
refunding of the indebtedness of these railroads by
legal enactment. . - :--.,-â .,. Â»%-.-â â¢
â ~Â£e*olved\"l , ha.t'the people dependent upon the
line of the subsidized defaulting railroads, in the
case of their debt being refunded, must endure the
burden of . excessive cost of transportation for the
many years of extension demanded, an obvious
Injustice, which will retard the development of the
. dependent territory, whereas a change of I manage
ment, either directly by the Government or by
lease under proper restrictions, will develop the
territory and .increase the value of the railway
Itself. : For these -.valid reasons this Chamber of
Commerce favors foreclosure by the Government
as the result of (he default in the payment of the
debt owing to it. â â¢ â 
In the i light of 'these resolutions, our friend,
the enemy, must be looked for in the person
age that is besieging Congress with a paid
lobby of political retainers in the interest of
his Southern Pacific octopus and in direct con
flict with the interests of the Government and
the people.â Omaha Bee.
NEWEST SKIRT WITH EOX PLEATS.
There is little ; change in the fashion situa-J
tion, which has for the last year made plain!
wide skirts the unchangeable feature of all'
costumes, v Despite many efforts to.introduce |
panels and trimming effects, the plain un
trimmed circular front skirt hanging ex
tremely full holds its own. The only novelty
is the box-pleated back which our illustration
shows in its most favored form. '
This model is seen in both separate skirts of
rich material to be worn with coat basques and
blouse waists, and as a part of costumes of one
material either in combination with jackets
for street wear or waists for indoor use. .
Despite its long vogue black satin is much
used. , Handsome crepons also are chosen for
separate skirts. Plaids cut very well after this
design and are much worn; it is also very de
sirable for stamped goods, showing no seams.
The pleats in the back are formed by sepa
rate gores, the seams being hidden under the
folds. The front is seamless, being cut circular.
It is not necessary to have darts at the top.
I The only stiffening now used in skirts, and
even this is often omitted, is a five to ten
inch facing of haircloth, wirene canvas or
crinoline around the bottom. The skirt should
be lined throughout, the lining being cut
exactly like the goods.

'. Stevensonâ Radcliffe, Belmont, Cal. Robert
Louis Stevenson j was married but once. The
lady he married was the divorced wife of Sam
Osborne, who for many years was shorthand
reporter in the late Judge Dwinelle's court in
this City. He met her in Paris, and married
her in this State. During the time he was in
California he lived across the bay, and probably
passed part of his time with acquaintances in
the vicinity of Berkeley. He was not an opium,
smoker." Stevenson was born in Edinburgh,
November 13, 1850, end died at Vailiraa, near
Apia/Samoa, December 3, 1894. He was a
novelist, essayist and poet, who at an early ago
developed his talent, but he was never robust,
and in 1873 his health broke down and he
went to different parts of the world on a . tour,
in the hope that he would find a health invig
orating spot. He was on this coast in 1887,
and in that year sailed on the Casco in search
of health in the islands of the South Pacific.
Finally he landed on the Samoan Islands and
made his home near Apia. - He took a great
interest in the . affairs of the Samoaus, and
wrote vigorous articles in their defense. Some
of these gave offense to Germany. He wrote
quite a number of novels and essays, also many
poems. "-â  â 'â¢'â ' " â¢'â *â -;.*, *"'â

I Papers were filed yesterday in the Su
perior Court in behalf of Agnes M. Haique,
making application for a divorce from her
husband, Martial Hainque. Martial
Hainque is a young man 23 years of age, a'
son of the former proprietor of the Cyclops
Machine Works, and an heir to his father's
estate, owner of a sixth interest in the
tools, etc., of those works. He is said to
be worth $25,000, and, upon the motion of
Walter Linforth, the plaintiff's attorney,
Judge Hunt, yesterday issued an injunc
tion restraining Hainque from transferring
any of his property, as threatened to do
in case of suit being entered. .'â .;â 'â¢ .7
The wife alleges extreme cruelty as the
grounds of her petition,' and cites a series
of extraordinary instances. The coupre
were married on the 30th of 'July, 1893, in
this City. The husband is alleged to have
begun to treat his wife with brutal vio
lence almost immediately after the mar
riage. On the evening of the 9th of Sep
tember, 1893, while they were returning to
their home at 510 Fifteenth street, after a
visit to a sister of Hainque, he struck his
wife with his fist,. causing her' nose .to
bleed profusely. ; ' 7; :--7
| She was only saved from another attack
in their house the next day by the ap
pearance of- a friend, Mme. Rosine
Guitrive. "'"â â ".' //X/
During the month of January, 1894, the
husband is alleged to have beaten his wife
in the face with his fist until he wearied of
it, and then dragged her about the room by
her hair. At this time the wife had but
risen from a bed of sickness, her child
being but three weeks old. ' . "-'â 'â  'â "â '_ 'â }'.'
In February following the husband
again beat the petitioner in the face,
choked her, threw her upon the floor and
kicked her in the abdomen. She en
deavored to escape from the house with
his child, but he overtook and choked her
again. - .â â .-. " ,""
A few days later, while" the baby girl
was asleep in its bed, being then less than
two months 'old, he threatened to kill her
should she awake and cry. The child did
awake and he hurled two wooden , boxes at
her. The mother threw herself in front of
the child and was struck over the eye arid
temple. :As a result, -her eye was swollen ;
and blackened and "-. her face discolored for
a period of two weeks thereafter. 7
In June, in the presence of a visitor, he
gave her another choking.
On the evening of the 4th of I July, about
9 o'clock,, he beat her into insensibility.
She did not recover, consciousness until 4
o'clock the next morning, or seven hours
after. As another result of this her face
was blackened and discolored for a period
of two weeks. . " â ""*.;
On the 30th of May, 1895, while in a pub
lic restaurant at Seventh and Market
streets, he threw a sugar bowl at her,
striking her on the shoulder.
.\ On January 27, 1896, with the acquies
cence of the husband, the wife "was re
peatedly struck in the face with great force
and violence by Mrs. Frank C. Bangs, a
sister of 'defendant."
The petition further states that these
instances were only a few of their kind,
but that repeatedly the husband beat and
abused the wife, in this way making her
sick, lame and disfigured. He used violent,
abusive and obscene language toward her
frequently in the presence of visitors, and
charged ; her with being upon improper
terras with every man who came ';â¢ to the
bouse. â  ;7/.-7 '7::7" ; -.', % ;' * ' '/ â¢ ;.t.?.;.y.\^.

Has Been Instigated by His

Frederick ', W. ; "Brooks, 1 manager of ; the

at the City Prison yesterday afternoon on
two charges of felony embezzlement.
/ ,The complaining "witness is Mrs. Orhnda
Van Wiej who was divorced from her hus

one-third of the community : property.
Her share was assessed at 7 $1125, which
she alleges was paid in two \ sums of $500
and $625 to Brooks on her behalf and re
tained by him.
Brooks' version of the affair is that after
Mrs. ; van Wie was divorced his mother
asked if he could not give her a home in
his house, as she was friendless. He con
sented to do so and she went to live with
him. The two attorneys who "acted for her
in the divorce suit got her to : sign a docu

interest .in the estate,' and :, when she com
plained to Brooks about it he advised her
â¢ to consult an attorney.

said Brooks, "and he advised her to ignore
the document. Several consultations were
held with the attorney^ for Mr. Van Wie as
to her share of ? the community property,

SHED CROCODILE TEARS
How Carrie Clarke Warde, the
Actress, Beguiled a Police
Officer.
She Bewailed Armstrong's Absence
After Hiding Him in the
Hall. . '
JJFrank Armstrong, the young California
actor who deserted his wife and infant son
a couple of weeks ago, has been located in
Humboldt County, comfortably playing
with the Carrie Clarke Warde Company.
There is a tale connected with his escape
from this City which proves that if Mrs.
Warde were as fine an actress on the stage
as she is off it she would be winning the
acclamations of the multitude in metro
politan theaters. â â¢â â .â :, 7 ; "7 '
The day that Frank Armstrong was to
sail to Eureka with the "Warde Company,
on the steamer National City, Mrs. Arm
strong and Officer . McMurray of the So
ciety for. the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children went to Mission-street wharf with
a Warrant for Armstrong's arrest, on the
"charge of deserting his wife and child. â¢
When the destitute young wife and the

officer reached the ' steamer they found
Mrs. Carrie Clarke Warde . walicing the
deck and weeping bitterly. "He has gone,
deserted us," she wailed when asked to
tell the whereabouts of her leading man.
"How can we play without an actor to
take the lover's roles! It was base of him,
for his flight means financial ruin for the
company." . ,
."Has not he been down to the ship?"
asked Officer McMurray.
, Mrs. Warde shook her head, wept afresh
and tore her hair. "He has sent np bag
Â§age;and no word," she said in a voice
roken by sobs. -
"I will search the ship,", said Officer
McMurray: Just at this point, however,
the actress was seized with such a violent
fit of hysterics- that she had to be patted
on the bacK and led gently to a seat, while
the poor little wife, shocked at: this fresh
instance of. her husband's perfidy, mingled
her tears with those of Carrie Clarke
Warde, and the hungry baby, whose milk
man had cut off the supply of food that
morning, also raised his little voice in
lamentation. ', '-v â â¢â'â¢:. -
Taking, advantage of the general con
fusion Officer McMurray paid. a hasty visit
to the staterooms, but ?ho found no trace
of ; the missing actor.: On returning to the

Mrs. Armstrong in broken accents to ac
company her, as a last : resource, to a" re
sort on Howard street, where Frank Arm

ASK FOR APPROPRIATIONS
The ; : Committee on Commerce
Espousing the Shipping

URDENED BY OVERTAXATION.
Several Proposed Recommendations
7 Suggested for the Benefit of
This Harbor.
A meeting of the committee on com
merce was held in the rooms of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon. -";
Previous to the arrival of T. J. Parsons,
chairman of the committee, an informal
.discussion was bad over the question of
water rates to the shipping. J. W. Dickie,
chairman of the sub-committee on '-'tax
ation on shipping,'' had discovered that
the firm of Goodall & Perkins, who have a
monopoly of the water supply along the
front," are charging more than twice the
price for \ supplying "â  the ships what they
themselves pay to the water company. 7 It
was shown that this firm charges the State
for its tugs $97 50 for the water supplied,
which they buy" from the Spring Valley for
$34 82. .-. ; . . - 7 " :- : â
This '-, "subject will not, however, be
brought before the committee for consid
eration' until such time as the Harbor
Commissioners look into the matter. ' Â»
The sub-committee on, taxation of ship
ping submitted the following as its report:
"In submitting their report; your com
mittee are fully conscious of the* fact that
the question of the taxation of shipping
that we are asked to report on is one that
in one shape or another has recently been
acted upon by several of the States: It is
also a question of vital importance to the
commerce of San Francisco, more so, per
haps, than to any other port in the United
States, as the shipowner of San Francisco
is in direct competition with foreign ship
ping, built cheap and subject to no taxa
tion.*' ':â 'â . : . "'-''â¢â ".â¢.'-â¢'â  fy-'/. â '"â â¢'
' "We had hoped that there might be
some way whereby the burden of taxation
on our shipping might be relieved short of
an. appeal "to the whole people of the State,
but these hopes present but little founda
tion upon which to build. â¢ .
"Your committee therefore decided" to
recommend that the San Francisco -com-*
mittee on commerce center its energies on
securing the passage of a resolution by the
Legislature to amend the first section of
Article XIII; of the . constitution Jof - the
State of California/providing that all ves
sels registered or enrolled jat any ' port*, in
the United States and any foreign port," or
between ports in the United States, shall
be exempt from all local and State taxa
tion; and we further recommend that the
committee at once begin the work of'edu
cating the people of ; this, State as J, to the
necessity for placing our shipowners in f a
better position to compete with the un
taxed ships that are now doing the work
that our own ships should do. '':': :.-''~'-.-\
"To this end we recommend that papers
or tract", be printed and issued by the com
mittee to every.voter of the State, showing
the justice and wisdom of such an amend
ment; its necessity in order to secure the
commercial prosperity of the State; j how
all interests depend on the prosperity
of our ; commerce; how other V States
and voters free themselves of; bur
dens, and how hopeless it is to compete
against free ships with taxed ships. By
such means, aided by the newspaper press,
which we think should be patriotic enough
to keep this matter constantly before their
readers^ not as a, party or sectional ques
tion, but as a great principal factor in the
welfare of this commonwealth.
"In this your /committee sees { the only
hope of r relief for an overburdened ship
ping.".S â¢ â ""â  â ' ,\ < >.â .â¢â -'".â  -7- â ' -' .'
A seneÂ»"of petitions were submitted by
the various sub-committees on - matters to
them referred asking appropriations from
Congress for/Keeping the/ telegraph line
between this City and Point Reyes light
house in good working order. For. this
service the sum of $2000 was asked.
The sum of $200,000 was asked : for the
purpose of removing several-dangerous ob
structions' in the bay. Also for. fair-way
signals entering the bay, and charts of the
various sections* traversed by telegraph
and telephone cables. "â /"/-â  '"'â¢: â â "â  â  7 ; ' /
On currents inside the Golden Gate the
sum of $5000 was asked to be appropriated
to the geodetic survey. '".:. ' . '
For a fog signal on the northwest Far
alien. $20,000, and to connect .the 'south
east Farallon island - with the -main land
on this side, $35,000 .was' prayed for. The
sum of $90,000 was asked to build and
equip a, fog-signal vessel, with auxiliary
steam power, to be stationed outside of the
bar at San Francisco; in place of the ineffi
cient whistling buoy now stationed there.
In order tv give additional strength and
force to the committee's request for the
above appropriations, a motion vtfis made
and carried that. the chair appoint a com
mittee of three to obtain the signatures of
other representative /organizations Â not
connected with the Chamber of Commerce.
On this committee W. M. Bunker, Alfred
Bouvier and Captain Thayer' were ap
pointed.

MISS FERRY'S DEBUT
She Appears as Dora Prescott
in "Men and Women" at
the Columbia.
The Frawley Company Takes a Cali
fornia Girl, New to the Stage,
as One of Them.
Miss Minnie Ferry was the star feature
of last night's presentation of "Men and
Women"; at the; Columbia Theater. It
was the occasion of that clever young San
Francisco girl's debut first l appear
ance upon the stage. Those who may not
have been aware of it, ; however, surely
could ; not have, guessed ; that ) the ? young
lady who was playing; Dora Prescott was
going through the trying experience of a
first night before the footlights. â 'â 'â ":â 
The part of Dora Prescott is that of a
soubretteâ a young girl, gay and artless,
who trips on and off the stage, has a little
something to do with all the other charac
ters, pets and pouts, woos and is wooed by
her first lover. It is.by no means an un
important part, but' requires a light. step, ;
a graceful bearing, a nice elocutionâ
art which wears the appearance of artless
ness. And all v these requirements the
pretty little debutante "; met so entirely as
to delight her friends \ aware that she had
just essayed the part and to give no warn
ing to others that she had ' not played the
part a thousand times. ' - ' :
(â â . When Miss Ferry made her first ap
pearance on the stage she was instantly
greeted by a â  burst of applause, for the
boxes were 7 occupied by her personal
friends, and very many in the house had
come especially to see her.. Her mother,
Mrs. C. P. Ferry, and; her little brother,
with a party of friends, were seated in the
center of the orchestra circle," where the
best view might be had. .
Miss Ferry was dressed in white with
red carnations.;., ln the next act she was
dressed in Dale sea green and violets. .: She
appeared in the last act wearing a street
dress of cadet blue with white trimming.
I During f the - evening she ; provoked fre
quent applause and flowers were showered
upon the stage.
Miss Ferry has been regularly engaged
by | the Frawley. Company and will go
north and continue with them until the
end of the " season. 7 She will ;go ':. to New
York, to friends there, and make arrange
ments for ; her k subsequent .*' career," which
promises to be brilliant. '
Miss Ferry is a native of San Francisco.
She is a graduate of i the Denman Gram
mar School, i She has traveled extensively
with her parents, completed her education
in France and Switzerland.: She is gifted
with j a good ivo;ce, â¢ pretty face and good
figure, and is ; : otherwise peculiarly
equipped to" adorn her chosen profession.
BOXING FOR CHARITY,
The National Club -Will/ Give Its First
Entertainment This Even- -
:.;/.. ing. .-.
The National Athletic Club will give its
inaugural athletic entertainment this
evening at the Auditorium Theater, and
J. Ross Jackson;/ the president, is â¢ san- *
guine that success will crown the first of
an interesting series of exhibitions which
will be held under the auspices . this
club. The principal feature of sport for
the initial gathering will bean eight-round
contest with gloves of regulation size be
tween Danny Needham and George Green.
The principals/ have been training faith
fully for three or four weeks for this exhi
bition, and speculation ; among | the lovers
of the sport is rife as to who will receive
a favorable decision at/ the termination of
the bout. 7 ''"'.'' < . .
I- Green has an ad vantage, in some ways.
He is several years , a younger man than
Needham, and may possibly ; be :. in better
trim to put on the finishing touches. /Need
ham has had long experience,: and will," it
is said, introduce several blows which may
surprise the protege of Champion Corbett.
It can :be : safely said,/ however, that the
bout will be well worth seeing. - Several of
the greatest boxing contests witnessed in
this; City were finished , inside : of ten
rounds. . . . - . . - â 
According to a letter which was received
yesterday t by,: a" prominent'/ promoter of
fisticuffs from a New York sporting 'â  man;
the betting on the Maher and Fitzsiinmons
fight will be strongly in favor of the New
Zealander. The gamblers" of New/York
and Chicago are of the opinion j that Fitz
simmons will stop Maher in' six/or seven
rounds, 1 and already /several /wagers have
been made that the fight will not last four
rounds, andXhat Fitzsimmons will prove
a winner. There :is ?â  very small *â ; interest
taken in the other fights that are proposed.
The answer Corbett 1 ; recently made to a
challenge s which he ; received/from/Peter
Jackson is not calculated to impress sport
ing people favorably toward the champion.
The sporting men of New York have con
cluded that if I Corbett intends .to] play : for
public pap.he must -throw, off jj his* theatri
cal robes and re-enter the arena.; If Peter
Jackson is, by a l breaking down y of his
physical forces, unable /to do 7 any more
fighting, Corbett should !be all /the; more
anxious to fight i him! and c prove to thou
sands of people that he is the better | man.* 1

A CRY FOR CHEAP BEER.
Saloon-Keepers Ready to Revolt
Against the Local
Breweries.
THE SYNDICATE WAS SCORED.
Scheme Presented for Supplying Un
limited Beer at Four Dollars
a Barrel.
There : was . a meeting of ' syndicate-op
pressed saloon-keepers and grocerymen at
909 Market street j last ! evening. Sixty sel
lers of beer responded to this call:
ATTENTION 1 SALOON-KEEPERS AND GRO
CERYMEN.
i: Dear Sir: You are cordially invited to at
,?,, Â£ mass-meeting to be held in Pythian
Hall, 909-915 Market street, San' Francisco, on
Thursday, the 6th day of February, 1896, at 8
o clock p. m., to discuss the late arbitrary ac
tion of the San Francisco breweries, or the
syndicate, and to devise ways and means to
buy a brewery of our own and to have beer at
$4 per barrel on the stand with rebate, and
permission -to the employes to spend money
over the bar when or how they please. â  .
; Important subjects on this question material
to our interests will be discussed by those who
understand the business. â  Frank Marty.
â¢ Â£|^*Please present this notice at the door.
The t breweries in the syndicate are the
Wieland, , Willows, Chicago, National,
Fredericksburg and the United States, but
the Brewers' Association, which abides by
the rules which the syndicate prescribes,
embraces also the Enterprise, Milwaukee,
California, San Francisco Stock, Ameri
can, Broadway, Albany, Hibernia, Jack
son and ; Washington. 'â -â ...
Recently an edict went forth from the
association that drivers must not spend
brewery, money with customers, which is
regarded as an indirect advance of 50 cents
on a barrel of beer, as that much money
was formerly thrown across the counter in
the delivery of each barrel. Hence beer is
now $5 a barrel without the shadow of re
bate. .; That is. the sum that goes to the
brewer for. every barrel "sold." :
, R. Manuel took the chair last night and
expounded the; objects of the meeting.
"Our cry," he said, "is cheap beer ' and
better beer. We. have a brewer who will
give it to us and release us from the ex
actions of the syndicate. For good reasons
the name of the brewer must be now
withheld, but he lives within 100 miles of
San Francisco. . He is. a responsible man
and understands the business. He was
not inclined at first" to help us, but he is
now willing to establish a brewery at a
cost of $30,000. ; He will put in $15,000 him
self. | And we want 150 saloon-keepers to
take each one share of stockâ that is to
say, invest $100 in the enterprise. The
beer, which this brewer makes is of
superior quality ; and will be sold for $4
per barrel. He -guarantees a dividend of
10 per cent on the slock. â¢ ; . -;â¢â¢.' â¢
"So each customer selling or ordering a
quantity of beer will get $114 the first
year.. He can easily supply 200 saloon
keepers. We must do something, for the
syndicate may advance the price to $6,
$7. or even $10 a barrel." .
r Charles S. Hubbs was the next speaker.
''This, brewer," he said, "who agrees to
come to ; our relief has traveled . all over-
Europe and this country. -He is a respon
sible and successful man. His brewery is
located in a barley -growing district not far
from here." Â' . .
The next speaker was a refreshing and
original orator who vouchsafed the in
formation that he was an agitator and an
Irishman from the city of Dublin.
Since the days of the sand Jot, when the
Kearney :;: meetings â¢ developed ; epigram
matic speakers, few orators ;â  have come to
the front who can surpass John Nugent,
formerly, from Dublin, latterly from Ta
coma and Seattle and at present of San
Francisco. 7 He gained applause last even
ing when he said that saloon-keepers -who
succeeded in San Francisco were the men
who "bought their beer of the syndicate,
fheir whisky of John Siebe and their cigars
of Mose Gunst." *â , Nugent said further: -'I
started in with the co-operative brewers a
few years ago, but the sharks and monop
olizers got hold of . the scheme. â¢'â¢ I made a
mistake then in not having with me the
labor union element. '.
; "I was then a workingman, but am now
a saloon-keeper and the workingman's
friend.- If you- want to succeed ;in this
new scheme you must have the ," labor
unions with you. Monopoly cannot
crush them out. The English syndicate
has caught \ our German , brewers. The
English have caught Matt Nurian. All
must come under the yoke of the syndi
cate."-';7'...*:â '.)._:-\-r.-y â ..â¢â :â .â¢. '-y-y-,:- â '-
"S- Nugent closed his speech by declaring
that- thÂ« liquor traffic was the life of a
town, and that there :. could be no r pros
perity until the workinjrman pot 5 wages
enough so he could throw a dollar across
the saloon : counter and : not â¢ miss the
money. .-..â¢â 
;.: A young ; man, who withheld his name
from the meeting, but acknowledged that
he represented the brewer who was willing
to supply beer at |4; per barrel, spoKe at
length. He reported that Stone of the
syndicate had said, "We have in our treas
ury |43,000 to : combat ; just such cases as
this.. We will sell beer in your town for $3
a barrel until the competition is crashed.
Despite Stone's threat the young man said
the beer.would.be supplied if 100 saloon
keepers stood in. ::,. ...
John Nugent of Dublin ; got another
chance â¢to speak and referred to an . ex-,
perience of the -co-operative ' 'â¢: business.
"We were doing at one time such a fine
trade on '; the . Barbary Coast : that : Tobin
took a way our , guides : because we : didn't
sell syndicate beer."
Frank Martin was introduced as a sturdy
brewer from the fatoerland, 'and he an
nounced with': emphasis ; and - sufficient,
lucidity that he would not' succumb to the
syndicate as long as he had a dollar.
V; After more talk; and encouraging assur
ances : the Philadelphia Brewery Associa
tion was formed,^ arid subscriptions to the
capital stock were received. :'y.-.
7 ue temper of the meeting was decidedly
in favor of a revolt aeainst the exactions
of * the 1 syndicate, and ; the * next meeting
promises to be a demonstration. '; ; ? : : " ;

- SPRINKLING A LUXURY.
Property- Own era , Protest Against the
Expenditure of Public Money.
: " A * petition with about thirty signatures
was presented to the Board of Supervisors
yesterday 7 against the "expenditure of
public money for, sprinkling > the ' paved
streets of the City." The reasons for the
protest as given are that ';. the work ;is not
an "improvement" and does not increase
the; durability or change the surface or.
character of Z the '; material : of -which' the
street is made,' 1 ): or in any wav add to the
improvement of the street; that it is not
necessary to the "protection of life or health,
but :on the contrary is only a luxury, and
should be paid for only by those voluntarily
consenting thereto. .* } * ' ''â '
It is further stated that "since the streets
have been well ; cleaned â â¢ there; has been
comparatively ho inconvenience :by not
sprinkling, in.- proof of which : Sutter and
other streets formerly sprinkled have not
been sprinkled within a year oast. If the
whole City- is to be sprinkled the expense
will be too great to add to the present high
taxes.. .If the whole City is not to be
sprinkled it will be special legislation,. and
an unjust and unlawful discrimination."

The answer was: "A couple? You'll need

took place.

would be had hosts of friends among.their,
ranks East and West, whether they sold
papers for a n ickel on the Pacific Coast or
for a penny on the Atlantic, and that she
would be glad to add them to the number.

all ' right ' "Same ' with : The 7 Call!

the pcape were again in order, for.the boys
exhibited a dangerous tendency, to mount
each other's shoulders at - imminent peril
of life and limb." '
' Mr.* Boyne dealt out the tickets with a
lavish hand, and' after the distribution
began the work was done in short order.
7 "Three cheers for Corinne! Hurrah for

part. He ; had exhausted his voice in the
service of his fair. entertainer, but he still
had strength"; to wave his hand, which, a

toward the gallery they will be in an

she great? I tell you she's prime." And
when the performance is over they will,

DAVIS' DIAMOND RING.
Interesting- Bit of Aftermath to the
Escapades of the forcer and
Confidence Han.
A diamond ring, said to be worth 1150,
formerly belonging to J. C. Da vis, : forger
and confidence man, has been the object
of a long drawn out controversy} before -
Justice of the Peace Cook: V It was decided
after an all-day session yesterday, in which
a half dosen prominent 'attorneys were
engaged. : The ring is in the care of Chief
of Police Crowley, who took it from Davis
at the time he was under arrest for forgery.
; "Major Stonehiil was his attorney at the
time and ">- Davis gave him some money .
and an order for the ring as his compensa
tion. Davis was- admitted to ball and im

that are still unknown. *>'â¢'"' â :. - - ';â

\ The case has come up for bearing on two

represented by Attorney Louderb&'ck. An
orÂ«^er was .presented f by Louder back in
which Davis .' transferred -i his interest in
the ring to hi? wife. This was dated ear

favor, and postponements were secured on
the ground that the wife was about to re

BATTERY VS. CAR ASSAYS.
Defendant's Argument ,in the
Hale and Norcross Min
ing Case.
THE GRADING OF THE SAMPLES.
Attorney "Wood Reviews the Expert
Testimony of : the ; Witnesses ;
of Plaintiff./ /
In the Hale 1 & Norcross silver mining
case yesterday, on its second trial in De
partment 4 of the Superior Court, Attorney
W. 8. Wood, for the defendants, 'made; an
exhaustive argument -I on the sampling of
ores and their relative value.
1 1 will- be remembered that ; M. W. Fox,
a stockholder in the Haled; Norcross Min
ing Company, began suit 'iasainst. the com
pany, charging that its directors, by means
of a fraudulent conspiracy between them
and the owners of the mills where the J ore
was crushed, had j defrauded and robbed
the stockholders of the mine of . over
$2,000,000. He alleged that: among- the
devices resorted to was tampering with the
ore after it left the mine, where car samples
had been assayed. One of the. devices re
sorted to was the mixture of worthless rock
with high-grade ores' so as to obscure their
value and at the same time increase 7 the
quantity of material to be put through
the mills. The concealment from the
stockholders of the average vaine of ,the
ores as thus reduced; a fraudulent system
of milling by. which only a small portion
of the precious metals -contained in the
ores was returned to the . stockholders,
and the disposition of the stolen bullion
in a (Banner intended conceal the theft,
were allege.). v ...
On June 11, 1892, the Superior Court
entered its decree in favor of the plaintiff
for the benefit of , the corporation and
against the other defendants, Lew (ex
nresident), Hobart, Hayward, Nevada and
Mexican mills and mining companies and
others severally for various sums; -
The defendants appealed, and the Supreme
Court foitnd; that Hayward, Hobart and
Lew had by a fraudulent agreement with
the Mexican and Nevada mills robbed the
company as charged; tnat â¢ they :; had
caused a quantity-of inferior and'worth
less ores to be extracted from the mine
and to; be milled after being mixed with
ores of a higher grade ; that â $7 per ton
had been paid for milling said ores, which
was fraudulent, as the. defendants were
entitled to only $4 50, the actual of
milling;^ and by reason of this fraud the
Hale & Norcross Company had sustained
damages in the amount of $210,197 50. But
the Supreme Court remanded, the case to
the Superior Court for rehearing upon the
value of ore delivered, to the mills, the
value and amount of bullion that should
have been . returned therefor, and -what
amount of this value delivered to the mills
was necessarily lost in the working; < also
the amount of money' if any, received
from the tailings or residue of the ores. â
; Consequently the object of the defend
ants in the case now being rehearsed is to
prove that the car or mine sample assays,
which: are evidence: against: them, were
too high and wholly unreliable to deter
mine the true value of the ores; and to
prove the battery or mill assays practically
correct, notwithstanding the figures were
in the hands of the defendants and subject
to whatever "doctoring", they might elect.
Attorney ."Wood stated yesterday that the
plaintiff and defendants agree ; that I the
amount of one was '84.063 tons aud 1700
pounds. The value of this ore by battery
assay was $2,225,300, and this value should
be adopted by the court.,.- : i,-
The percentage of â  moisture in this ore,
according to tbe testimony of -witnesses,
runs all the way from 3to 12 per cent. At
an average of S per cent, deducting this
moisture, would leave the value of battery
assay at $2,047,276. This, Mr. Wood held,
was the only . criterion by which the court
could determine the actual value of the
ore. No faith should be put in the car
sample assays, and they should be re
jected. : , ' : *'-.-'--..
He reviewed at length the testimony of
witnesses relative to the two different as
says and the methods of making each,
wnether fine ore, which ia known to be the
richer, because | mineralized rock will
crumble easily," was used, or the coarser
taken for the , test. The testimony of H.
W. Tangermann, the expert, who said the
ore should have milled 75 or 85 per cent of
the car-sample " assays, counsel considered
unsupported by further evidence. ''â¢". -'â 'â -'â '
The court was also told â¢ that Witness
Maxwell's testimony , that ; the '-. Overman
mine returns were 00 and 70 per cent of the
car-sample ;. assays was â¢ not to be con
sidered.', â¢; ; : '. .-'â¢'"â ". '.: .';'â '. ; . ' . ;
Assayer Price's * testimony for the de
fendants was taken up and; the story of
that wittiess' persistent adherence to his
assertion .that car-sample assays were
wholly worthless was repeated. Mr. Wood
held that no evidence bad been given by
which car-sample assays couid. be used as
a basis of a judgment, as only the assays
taken at the mills after the ore had been
crushed and properly mixed. : . 'l-.'lz:-\.

Lieutenant Daniels is not the only officer
of the Bering Sea revenue fleet who is now
trembling in his shoes. Assistant Engi
neer Dorry is also doing" his best to find
some one willing to speak a good word for
him during the coming investigation.
Mr. Dorry, when spoken to yesterday in
relation to the â¢matter in which he is so
much interested .refused to speak for pub
lication. He said that "at all events he,
being an honest man, should "have a better
chance than any ten-cent dude. But when
asked what he meant by a "-'ten-cent dude"
he refused to answer. - v
First Lieutenant Buhner of the Bear is
also in a disturbed state of mind. It ap
pears that some enemy of Captain Healy,
learning that .the"; first lieutenant's testi
mony tended to clear his superior, notified
the treasury officials at Washington. r , Tho
result was a telegram from Assistant. â¢ Sec
retary Hamlin of the United States treas
ury advising Lieutenant Buhner to tell the
entire truth 7 during " his examination
"without-ony concealment or reservation
whatsoever." ' "; ."*V. :^} ' v j^iV;:
This telegram nettled Mr. Buhner great
ly. It i* seemed to him jas â  though ' his
veracity were being called in question.
Hence, during the examination he read
the telegram aloud and asked who was re
sponsible for it.'; V,"7 l- * â¢
A deathlike silence was the only reply.
"Have you been writing to Washington,
Mr. Reynolds?" asked the first lieutenant,
eying the , judge advocate. ' : '
"Silence was : the only answer, and the of
ficials glanced at Mr. Reynolds as though
expecting him to respond. : :;
Yes, I have,*' * at ' last answered Lieu

have been requested to do so.!' Â '"Â£..â¢
"All right,', ejaculated Buhner in a tone
expressive of* the utmost resignation, "I
suppose I must take my dose like merest."
Captain Louis Williams of - the whaler

once a day. ' A^ to Captain Healy failing
to reach Point Barrow, the witness said he
was one of 'the /captains who counseled
Healy not to attempt the i trip,' as the ice
was commencing to gather and the officers
at Point Barrow were amply provided for.

the Arctic "currents than any "other man.
He had met Healy near Icy Cape, and had
advised him'-'. not to. go to Point Barrow,
since the trip would be a dangerous one,

At the afternoon session Dr. Bodkin tes
tified that; the liquor had been removed

THE HOME INDUSTRY FAIR
Manufacturers Have Secured a
. Good Site for Their Ex
position., â¢ '
A BLOCK ON TWELFTH STREET.
Plans for the Structure Will Be Made
.Â£â  at -Onceâ Prospectus of the
Project.
The members of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association have set to work in
earnest to make its home-industry exposi
tion a.. success. The setback received
through the directors of the Mechanics'
Institute refusing to lease the pavilion for
such a fair was only temporary. f A special
committee was, at the last, meeting ap
pointed to go ahead with the work of ar
ranging for an exposition of home prod
ucts/and in the past week much has been
done toward this end. The first \ step
made was to secure. a suitable site upon
which to erect a large exposition building.
Site of the Manufacturers' Home Industry
Exposition. ": '-.'"*.'
( Several pieces of land in various parts of
this City were offered, but none were ac
ce'ptcduntil within the past two days.
The lot selected is in the block bounded
by Market, Mission, Eleventh" and Twelfth,
or Potter. It has a frontage of 200 feet on
Twelfth street and is 475 feet deep, with a
twenty-five-foot outlet " upon'; Eleventh
street. The special . committee, consisting
of Messrs. : Mead. Bowers and Tacy,- called
upon the owners of the lotâ John Van
Bergen and Joseph Brandenstein, neither
of whom belongs to the association. Upon :
learning the objects of the home-ind ustry
exposition both of the property-Owners of
fered the use of the lot free of cost for -six
months, and the offer/was. at once ac
cepted vby the representatives of the asso
ciation. . ..â 
-; To-day the committee will confer with
several; architects with a view of obtain
ing suitable plans for an exposition build
ing that will cover the. entire lot. The
idea at present is that 'a; one-story frame
j structure will be constructed. A building
covering this lot will give the association
j 50,000 square feet on the main floor for ex-
Eosition purposes. There is some talk of i
aving the roof high enough for a | gallery â¢
which will allow considerable more space,
but the gallery question will not bo de- |
cided until the next meeting of the board, i
On the main floor will be erected a stage !
30x40 feet in size.
It is estimated that a suitable structure !
can be erected for; between ; $15,000* and I
$20,000. " So far a's the raising ot the money, j
is -concerned, the directors are not con- |
cerned in the least. The Bale of .floor space j
to exhibitors will be almost enough to pay '
the cost of the building, at least such was
tbe experience of those who managed the
recent home industry exposition jin Oak- *
land, which was -a great success- in every
way. 'â '::. 7 .- -" " ."' '"'-. .:.
' The central location of the site is a great
feature in the minds" of those who are at
work on the | plans. â¢ Within - three* blocks
of the lot are ten lines of streetcars which
reach every part of -San Francisco.
The special committee has prepared a
prospectus of what will be accomplished.
| In the first - place : the exposition will be
i different from any ever held before, as the
i display will be confined exc;usivelv to the
I manufactures and products of California
i by the members of the association. It is
! the intention to make the exposition mi
i structive and interesting." Incidentally it
t may be here remarked that the association
j will from time to time make similar expo
sitions in every county in the State. The
exposition will be in reality a vast factory,
wherein the public may -witness the manu- .
facture of -every. article exhibited. *j Looms
will be at work making cotton, woolen and
silk goods. Machinery will be running to
show the manufacture of gloves, shoes,
, wearing apparel, mdiarubber goods, jew
elry, furniture, electrical appliances, glass/
book-binding, etc. ..Cigar-making, prepara
tions of food products, confectionery, per
fumes, extracts, stone worts mining, agri
cultural and dairy machinery will also be
prominent features in the fair, and it is
also expected that a fine-arts display by
local artists will be arranged.
There will also be jan â¢; historical display
of California, with exhibits pertaining to
its i geographical 7 features and undevel
oped ; resources. - " Preparations are now
being made for interesting entertainments
consisting of vocal and -instrumental
music by professional and amateur home
industry talent, exercises by â¢ school chil
dren; and exhibitions by military and
atnietso associations. "â¢;.â â¢
7 With 7 such, attractions ' as. these* the '
oromotors have no fear of failure, even \
though their rivals, the trustees of the
Mechanics - : Institute, have threatened to
hold a â : home-industry fair this year The
proposition iS to get a - head of the institute

ON MAX POPPER.
Things Seem to Be Livening
Up Among Democratic
Braves.
SAYS MAX IS A "LIAR."
Senator Armes of the Mint Rises
to Make Some Pertinent
Remarks.
TELLS WHO IS BEING WATCHED.
The "Suspected Ones Among the Junta
Are Beginning to Toss Things
Around a Little.
There is a threatening aspect on the face
of the Democracy. * ***7"77 77*'^7 ; . '.
Max Popper, who confessed to the Grand
Jury that he bribed Supervisors in order to j
make money on street-sweeping contracts, j
in which he and Boss Chris Buckley were i
partners, came in for considerable atten
tion. Mr. Popper's remarks addressed to the ,
friends of Rainey, published in yesterday's â 
Caxl. had an immediate effect upon those \
mentioned, and early in the day Senator j
Armes of the Mint, one of the Democrats j
referred to -by Popper as friendly 'with j
Rainey, announced that he had some
thing to say that would jar Mr. Popper up ;
considerable
"I see." said he, "that Max Popper, the
purifier, has stated in an interview that I
am a friend of Sam Barney's. That is
ridiculous. I have not spoken to Rainey
for four years and have paid no attention
to the man in any way.
"Pepper goes back some time to connect
me witn Rainey, and even then he has no
ground to stand on. I was one of the
three candidates on the Democratic
ticket elected in I?T9 when Buckley and
Rainey sold out the party. There were
eighty candidates all told and only three
me out ahead. Two years after that I
was elected State Senator without Buck
ley's or Rainey's assistance, which proved
that 1 had no connection with them. Mr.
Popper has. nothing more than that to
justify his remarks regarding ! me, and I
think he wonld appear in a better role if
he would stick to facts and not run wild
in his statements. â¢
"There is not a mar. in this Mint who is
friendly with Rainey and I do not believe
there ever will be one under Mr. Daggett's
administration. lam out for pure politics
with more" sincerity than Mr. Popper, as "L
think in that lies the salvation of the
Democratic party in San Francisco. '.".
"Popper need not think he can fool any
one by his mud-dinging tactics. -He is
being watched just as closeivas Buckley
or Rainey. for he is just as objectionable
to.the great mass of Democratic voters as
they are. He has been tried by the De
mocracy as a leader and has proved to be a
Jonah. Public opinion forced him to
resign the chairmanship of the general
committee during the last campaign; .now;
common decency should prompt him not
to try to put himself in a position where
he would be fully as obnoxious as either of
the old bosses.
"No sane man believes the Democratic
party can win with either Bainey, Popper
or Buckley hanging around its neck like a
millstone. It was a distinct understand
ing when the party was organized a few
months ago that these three worthies were
to be excluded from any control in the or
ganization. If this had continued all
would be well, but when the new commit
tee was organized Ponper was dug up and
placed or. it, and with his usual modesty
he at once commenced his manipulations
for power, but he is being watched. His
cry of "wolf is fully understood. He is
not deceiving any one and will not be al
lowed to disrupt "the party as he did two
years ago.
"I believe the people will vote more in
dependently this year than ever before,
and no party or candidate representing a
boss car. come before the people and hope
to be successful. The hope of the Democ
racy lies in presenting a ticket free from
even the suspicion of bossism.
"There is a much better political condi
tion ahead of us than we nave ever
encountered before. The Australian bal
lot makes it possible for men to vote as
they see fit and the objectionable candi
dates are getting it in the neck worse every
year. There are some degenerating in
fluences .that we have got to overcome,
however, but,' all told, the Democratic I
party can take care of the election and keep j
it clean of bosses and riot breeders." There
is one sure way to show our sincerity in j
this matter,' and that is to put up an anti- j
boss ticket."
Another good Democrat who had formed j
an opinion that concerned Mr. Popper ;
was Chief Sullivan of the Fire Depart- I
ment, referred to by Popper as Rainey' s !
friend; and it was incidentally stated by. ;
Popper that Sullivan had told him that
Rainey was the only man who could drag
the Eire Department into politics.
"If Max Popper says, that I . told â¢ him
any such thing." said the Chief, "he lies
from start to finish. The more I think
over the matter the .more decided -, I . be
come to say nothing in answer 'to his
charges. Ido not consider - that I have
been charged by one who amounts to any-,
thing. The people have not forgotten that
Mr. Popper told the Grand Jury that he
dared not testify in a certain case for fear
that his own* testimony would convict
him. That's a pretty sort of a fellow to
accuse me of anything. .:I,n?vef told him j
anything that even resembled his state- !
ment, and he lies if he says "so. 7
"Look here," Baid the Chief,' leaning lor- j
ward in" his chair. "There are, just about
twelve words that I could say," that "would 5 j
be an answer to Max Popper's statement;
regardmg me. but 1 won't say them. Why, !
the fool. He is one of the worst liars in
town, anyhow. I conid tell you dozens of
stories that would convince you beyond a
doubt regarding his aptitude at the busi
ness, lam out of politics absolutely and so?
is the department. II any fireman wants to
exercise his right as an American 'to' make 1
wnat political moves are necessary : ; for.
him to protect himself it is all right, but
the department as a whole is out of poli
tics.7'7^^nÃÃÃÃ
"I want to be let alone in these rows and
would like to have the people of San Fran-
Cisco forget that there is such a man as
myself in existence." The Chief then
took a short breathing Â« spell and S finally
concluded : with the following bit of in-'
â irnnttmm 11 11*1111 ailiTmfiTiiKni
formation -which will doubtless find'! /room
in Democratic archives*. '
"Pouf' Max Popper is nearly as big a
political ass as Sammy Braunhart."

The Sutro electric railroad, extending
from the western terminal -of the Sutter
street cable-line â¢to ; the Cliff House, car
ried last Sunday 20,000 passengers, or
10,000 each way. Twenty-three cars,
fifteen of which * are of large size,, were,

available is ample for a three-minute ser- :
j vice. â â "'.* '
E. M. Van Frank", superintendent of the j
j railroad company, regards a three
j minute service as* sufficiently rapid, and
l twenty-five cars will easily afford that con
â¢vena: -
j Yesterday afternoon the cars were run
ning on a 7* ...'-minute schedule and were
fairly well 'crowded with passengers.
The spur track from the main line to
Golden Gate Park also carried quite a
number of park visitors.
The conductors and motormen on the
Sutro road are paid at the rate or 22 cents
an hour. No higher rate i? paid in San
Francisco, while- several of the lines
operated in tnis City pay only 21 cents.
The 22 cent compensation is not paid in
any of the Easjern cities. Many of the in- j
terior towns of California pay by the day
or week, but the wages do not approximate j
22 cents an hour.
The fuel used at the power-house of the

A FAIR LADY'S CONTEMPT

Judge Daingerfield has ".-divorced ..Mrs. I
Veronica Baird from her husband, Benja- j

i much bitter opposition, and Mrs.
Baird's oldest daughter, "Mrs. Barry Bald- j
j win Jr., had made herself liable for con- j
tempt before the end of , the proceedings. !
! The suit had been running two days, and :
I it wound up in the next thing to a row.
The testimony was nearly all taken on' j
Wednesday, and the attorneys started to j
' argue the case yesterday morning. Reel ;
; .Terry, counsel for Mr. Baird, was waxing
: eloquent over the woes of his client and \
j the eccentricities of ' the temper of his"
I client's wife, when he began to refer to the ;
j marriage of the daughter, Mrs. ; Barry i
: Baldwin, as an elopement, and caused
j wholly; by.the.treatment which the girl-re-, |
; ceived from' her mother, 7 This was too
I much for the young woman,' who sat by j
j her mother's side s during the argument, ;
â¢and she sprang to her feet.
. ""That's a.lie," she shouted.
Tern* stopped his flow of eloquence for a' i
j moment and then resumed his argument, :
1 while for the time the interruption seemed'
j to have-paasedunminded. âÂ»-,.,
At the conclusion of "the arguments the
court rendered judgment for Mrs. Brfird.
Judge Daingerfield had not forgotten the
â interruption,} however, sand alter render
ing judgment he proceeded; to comment on
j Mr*. Baldwin's conduct. He said sncb a
.scene was unseemly and improper, and he i
j would ' find Mrs. ; Baldwin guilty of con-, \
| tempt and inflict a small fine as a reminder â¢
j of bow to conduct heTfeelf in court.
" At this Terry -rose with a plea for merer,
but he was ordered- to > : sit ) down. : "Hura,' i
Mrs. "Blair's counsel, then '"wanted to; talk !
on the subject, he, too, was ordered to

She sai-i shi- had acted on 'impulse; that
the statement that she had "eloped was.

The great crusade of the police against

There is talk, now, of having some of the

"The police have not the right to arrest
anybody they 'please merely because he

yesterday. "If, - ; without reasonable
grounds, they, arrest a" citizen who is peace

The bicyclist who does not violate the ordi- :

"It is entirely unjust to swoop down on

â¢If the penalty were for riding a bicycle, I
then the bicycle " might '* be of * material 'â

never:. tell how fast its owner has been

Languetin was * locked up about four
hours. 7 He had aomething over $16 in his
packet, and his wheel was security enough >
i for his appearance court, but the young
j man was locked in a cell while he was try- '
'â . -Ing to get word to his friends.
It is usually difficult enough to reach
relatives and friends in such -emergencies
late night; but the 7 police i add d to
the natural 'difficulty â  on Wednesday
nizht and made matters as .troublesome as
possible for the prisoners. This * adds to
the belief that an intentional attempt at
persecution, was made by the police, and ;
it is not understood who _ could have any ' *'
| motive in" such persecution except the
streetcar managers., ;_...
Twenty of the wheelmen. were arrested
I on charges of riding over, street crossings'
! at a speed of more than seven miles an
hour, but the police did not have any
; trouble in effecting the capture of the
| alleged offenders. 77-Â»-'7 'â -â 
.; says that He was not traveling at a
high rate of speed, for at Fourteenth and
Howard streets, where he was arrested,
the pavement is torn up and rough, and it
would have been unsafe to ride at a rate of
more than seven miles an hour. Besides
that' the policeman who ; made the arrest
ran. after him, and at a .seven or eight
mile rate the bicycle would not have been
easily overtaken.
The officers of the League of American'
Wheelmen .are unwilling to directly op
pose the action of the police, as 'the ordi
| nance is their own, but they insist . thatthe
demand, for $20 - bail iii addition to the'
bicycles is entirely unwarranted. The
ends of justice would be subserved, they'
declare, if the police should demand only
a small amount of money as bailâ the
.Oakland example of $2 7 or js2 50, without
| the holding of the bicycles, having been
j found entirely satisfactory.
Â There is so much interest in the crusade' *
against the bicyclists and there were. so
many prisoners that ; Judge Joachimsen's
courtroom was crowded yesterday morn
ing. ~â" s "
The wheelmen were represented by Jus-"
; tice of the Peace Kerrigan, and when the
\ cases were called the attorney rose and
made a strong plea for dismissal. He ac
knowledged .that some of ; the defendants
â  had been technically guilty of violating
the ordinance, but he held that the intent ;
was lacking. The Wheelmen's League
was determined that the law should be en
forced and would uphold ; the police in
enforcing it, but he asked that under I the
circumstances the cases should be dis
missed, as it would be a warning to ail
bicyclists to obey the law, and seme of
those in court had been improperly ar
rested. BBBJM|^*^^^^^t| i *^Hg^^ \
Prosecuting Attorney Dare pointed 'out â¢
that the ordinance was passed at the re-'
quest of the wheelmen's .associations, and
it seemed strange *.' that members of those
associations should persist in violating it.
The Judge reprimanded the defendants
for not conforming to the provisions of the: *
ordinance, ' but j as? Judge Kerrigan had <
argued" that they were only technically
guilty he would dismiss the cases.

POWER FROM THE HILLS
Much ; Interest Attached to the
Bill for "Electric Rights
.7...;.; of Way.
STJEVEYOE-GEKEEAL APPEOYES.
A Measure That Will Cause -an Indus
trial Revolution in Interior
Towns. "
_, . . ...
Electricians and progressive ; men in the
towns oi the Ban Joaquin and Sacramento
valleys are watching -â¢with* consiaerable in
terest the bill recently introduced t>y Rep
resentative Bowers in Congress to amend
the act of March, 1891, granting a right of
way upon public lands for reservoirs and
canal purposes. The reason for this in
tense interest is said to be that the amend
ment is a measure demanded. by. the de
velopment of present conditions, or, more
correctly, by the (advancement of science
in .the application : of electricity to manu
facturing and agricultural enterprises.
' Congressman Bowers' amendment has
been '; favorably reported by 7 the House
Committee on .â  Public Lands, and . conse
quently is on , a fair way to adoption by
Congress. It contains the following addi
tion :
Section 2. That the Secretary . of the Interior
he, and hereby is, authorized and empowered
under general regulations to be fixed by him,
to permit the use of right of way. to the extent
of twenty-five feet, together with the use of
necessary ground,- not exceeding forty acres,
upon Duuiic lands and . forest reservations of
the United states by any citizen or association
at citizens 01 the United States for the purpose
of generating, manufacturing or distributing
electric power. .
The Secretary of the Interior has stated
that he saw no objection to Bowers'
amendment, provided that the right of
way desired be authorized by his depart
ment,- particularly regarding the use of
ground for the generating plants.
Such generally -favorable consideration
lias given those : interested good reason to
hope for the passage of- the amendment.
These men are mostly interested in the
cities along the eastern side , of â the San
Joaquin Valley and the northern and east
ern districts of the -Sacramento. Cther
districts, notably i'olo County and the re
gion around the lakes of Lake County, are
also watching.the 'progress, of this meas
ure. It is held by the interested parties
that the amendment will cause a revolu
tion in manufacturing ' industries, and
even in agricultural operations in the great
valleys of California. _
Under present conditions - the long
stretches of Government land and Govern
ment reservations, in ,the Sierras form an
impassable barrier between the sources of
power in the mountains and. places where
it may be utilized for the benefit of the
people. . *;. :
: Will S. Green, United States .Sur
veyor-General in this City, is a hearty sup
porter, of the amendment providing for
rights of way for electric power conduits
through Government lands.
"It is a very good . thing and I am in
favor of it," he r said yesterday. . "There
are many arguments' which "can be ad
vanced in its support, and here in Cali
fornia 1 am convinced it will be one of the
most beneficial measures that could be
taken: for .; the ;: benefit .. of the State. . This
right of way provided for in Congressman
Bowers' amendment does not give the
land away. The party or parties having
-the right of way cannot cut .timber upon
it, although : they may buiid a road as well
as maintain electric â¢:â¢ wires and poles.
Loads, of course, would Tbe necessary for *
the transportation^ of machinery and' sup
-1 plies to the generating works up in the
â¢mountains/ â ^.â¢â ^^-"rr-r.v -.-â  , ./â ',.-.
"Without such -a. legal right of : way
parties might run their. .. conduit wires
over Government land, as is the case now
in* Shasta,'' where' tremendous power is
transmitted from a mountain river to an
iron mine . near Bedding.* The wires in
Shasta are.strung \ over Government j land
too poor to grow timber and unfit for cul
tivation; in fact, too; barren; for grazing
purposes. "While this 'land is not taken
up the owners of -the wires are in constant
danger of being troubled by some design
i ing person. A fellow can come along and
get a quarter section, or more, where the
| lines and poles are, and then" claim that
I the wires have no right there. He can
cause a great deal of trouble, and probably
secure heavy rental for tne poles and
wires across his worthless land. Either
that, or tbe wires would have to come
down | and a new route found for them,
which might not be always possible. :
"Tberiwithout the security offered by a
Government light of way no â¢ capitalists
â¢would care to take chances on an -electric
generating plant. ; The : right . of : way : se
cures them against all fear of, loss, and
offers inducements for t.e building of
electric power machinery for nearly every
town in the valleys.
'.'Congressman Bowers, I have no doubt,
has in mind cities along the east side
of the Ban Joaquin Valley. It wilt mean
very much for those places, for with free
rights of way from the Government elec
tric power can be \ transmitted ; from hun
dreds of places in: the Sierras to Fresno
and other towns along there. - And then
with power costing; practically nothing I
can see no reason .why- agriculture should
not bo performed without horses or mules;
anyhow, this free power coming through
the National reservations will certainly
bring about an industrial | revolution jat
many important points in the interior" of
the State.:,' â -<.
â "I am certainly in favor of granting
rights of 'way ; through Government land
and National reservations for this purpose
and hope that this result may be accom
plished.'' - â¢â â -â¢ ii--'-* -". - .â â â -â -::â¢ ...

FATHER YORKE
TO DR. WENDTE.
Brief Review of the Status
of the Big Contro
versy.
PRIMACY OF THE POPE.
The Catholic Clergyman's Caustic
Words to the Oakland
Divine.
SOME LINKS OF THE . CHAIN.
The Five Main Points of the Discus
sionâls'the Biblical Authority
Sufficient ? .
To the Editor of the Call- Dear' Sir : I remark
with pain that the Rev. Dr. Wendte has yielded
once more to what the old theologians denom
inated "the concupiscence of wrath." His
, pentle humor of a week ago is overcast and he
makes his exit from the controversy in a very
bad temper. lam sorry indeed that he should
prove such a -striking example of the ineffl
cacy of good resolutions. However, he came
into the arena of his own' free will, and I do.
not think that he is wise in attempting to ex
cuse his conspicuous unsuccess by animad
verting upon his opponent's manners. '
THE STATE OF THE CONTROVERSY.
On January 10 Dr. Wendte intervened in the
current controversy by declaring intention
to prove v
1. That the primacy of the Bishop of Rome
was not supported by scripture or history.
2. That the Catholic theory or doctrine of I
the relations -between church . and state was
opposed to the American theory or doctrine on
the same subject.
3. That Protestant countries, races and men
are superior to Catholic countries, races and
men.
In the midst of the discussion Dr. Wendte
announced his determination not to treat this
third subject. He offered as his reason an un
willingness to irritate Catholics. 1 entreated
him to publish.his pamphlet and let us know
the worst at once; but my entreaties were in
vain. * Catholics are still shivering as they
think of the engine of destruction which Oak
land scholarship holds in reserve. Dr.Wendte's
admirers rest confident that if Rome should i
become too obstreperous their champion has |
but to hurl his lucubration and, lo ! Rome will
be no more. Anyhow, the controversy was by
this withdrawal confined to two pointsâ l, The
primacy of St. i'eter; 11, The relations between
church and state. '.:*-."
THE PRIMACT OF ST. PETER.
' ' In his first letter Dr. Wendte undertook to
prove live points, i
1. I'eter never received any authority over
tbe other disciples.
2. Even if be had, there was nothing to show
that this authority descended to his successors.
S. Peter was never bishop of Rome.
4. Peter.never abode in Rome for any such
term as i"5 claimed for him in the -official dec
laration of the Roman Catholic church;
5. Peter was, in all probability, never in
Rome at all. ,
Notwithstanding the old warning against at
tempting to prove a universal i negative Dr.
Wendte went bravely at his arguments.; It is
not necessary for me to describe . his method.
He confounded several distinct scripture inci
dents in one, he brought odds and ends of texts
from all over the New Testament, he showed
an unacquaintance with secular and ecclesias
tical history surprising in one who laid such
' claims to scholarship. Iv answer 1 was com
pelled to separate thescripture incidents- which
he had confounded, to examine each text
of scripture which be produced and to correct
his misstatements of historical facts. .
Dr. Wendte's answer deserves to be put on
record:
â¢ The Scripture texts and incidents to which 1
referred as demo'ustratlDg the utitenableness of
the- Catholic claim to Peter's primacy among. the
disciples and the great unlikeliness of his sojourn
and bishopric at Home are requoted one by
one by Father Yorke and given an entirely differ-'
ent interpretation, so that after bis manipulation
tney are made to appear as confirmations of his
own side of the controversy.- In other cases he
contents himself with evading my statements or
denying them altogether. And finally, be breaks
- the continuous force of my reasoning: and proofs
by separating each from the other and nibbling
and quibbling about each in detail until the reader,
wearied and bewildered loses all sense of the logical
connection and cumulative force of the various
parts of my argumentatipn. :*;.;,'
This is certainly a very extraordinary ad
mission. - Dr. . Wendte must -know: that the
strength of a chain, is the .strength of Its
weakest link. I did with his chain or argu
ment what any competent mechanician would
do with a chain.. I took up each link separate
ly and examined It. If Dr. Wendte was confused
and wearied by this simple process, his mind
must not be accustomed to logical ratiocina
tion. Ido not imagine that my readers were
bewildered by performing one of the most
elementary processes of reasoning. *
â â¢ Dr. Wendte did not attempt to analyze my
explanations of the sacred text. â¢ He consid
ered that the performance would be unspeak
ably tiresome, and therefore he leaves the
whole matter to the public. In order, how
ever, that the public may. see -what Dr.
Wendte's case amounts to. I will take the trou
ble of reviewing the argument in detail.
As I stated above. Dr. Wendte undertook to
establish five points:
A. Peter never received any authority over the
other disciples. - -' . -â¢
B. Even if he had there was nothing to show
- that this authority descended to his successors.
C. Peter was never Bishop of Rome, s
I D. Peter never abode in Rome for -any such term
j as is claimed for him in the official declaration of
the Boman Catholic church. < ,T *... ""
K. Peter was in all probability never in Rome
at all. . *Â..,
A. PETER'S PRIMACY. "i' /,*
" In order to show that St. Peter:- had been in
vested with authority over the other disciples.
I proved from the Scripture that: 1 --';
Firstâ built his church on Peter.
Secondâ Christ gave Peter the symbols
of royal authority in the church. â  .
Thirdâ That Christ - gave Peter the â 'â¢ royal
power of binding and loosing.
' Fourthâ That Christ gave Peter the power of
confirming the brethren. 'â¢*:
â¢ Fifthâ That Christ gave Peter the commission
to feed the lambs and sheep. ;-,;â '
: ..2 Let us see how Dr. Wendte treats each argu
ment. - - -. '-:--'."â¢ -.'-, â  -
Firstâ The rock foundation.
Against tbe argument drawn from the fact
that Christ had named. Simon the Rock and
. had promised to build his church upon that
rock Dr. Wendte objected:
(a) Peter is not the only rock. â¢ * '/.'.
--(b) His name Rock was given on a different
occasion and therefore has no special signifi
\ cance.
(c) Peter was the rock simply because he
- took a leading part in spreading the church. - .
(d) Peter was not the rock because. Christ
rebuked him and because he denied Christ. "â¢â â '
(a) Peter not the only rock. - *
Dr. Wendte attempted to show from r ; parallel
, passages in the Scripture - that Peter was not
thejpmy rock on which the church was -built.
â â  He Therefore quoted two texts, in one of which
it is said that Christ is the only foundation,
and in the otner of which Christ is. called the
â  headstone of the corner. .. * .../.*.-*-''.-.-?-.
That Dr. Wendte's objection should be of any.
j value he should demonstrate that in both these
places the church of Christ is said to be built
on Christ himself in the same manner in which
Christ says it was to be built on Peter.' r : >"v.
I simply made clear by quoting; the passages
cited that in- neither was there any. question
about building the church on a rock.
The. first passage â  was shown to refer to \ the
spiritual ;â¢ life ' of the individual Christian,
which can be built only on the one foundation
Christ Jesus. . . -.
The second passage was shown to refer to the
. despised stone, which was afterward made the
head of the corner.* . â 'â¢..'â  . : :
.'- Dr. Wendte's only, reply to this demonstra
tion of .the ; irrelevancy ;of bis quotations is:
"The Scripture :. texts are requoted one by one
by Father Yorke and given an entirely differ
ent interpretation." . :â .-â â -
If Dr. Wendte, instead! of bewailing my dia
lectic ' devices* had " attempted ' to ? show that
these texts could bear any other interpretation
than the one I have given he 'â â  might have
strengthened i his ' cause,*: instead of allowing
the rase to go by default. â ;, -.'., .Vi; V,- ââ¢
Hence.'l claim that ; my opponent, has not
shown that "Peter is not the only rock."
(6) The giving of his name.*^ii|*B|*BPya*gaÂ»
Dr. Wendte tried to break the force of the ar
gument derived from ; the name Peter. It is
the custom in; the .Scripture to signalize the
office or destiny of a man by a change of name.
Abram was called Abraham;' or the. "Father of
a' multitude,", because ;he was destined" to be
the '. parent : of great nations.':*.* Simon's . name
was changed to Peter, or Rock,' because be was
to be the . rock : on which ' Christ would Â» build
his church. Dr.* Wendte stated in -reply, that
Peter's name was given on another and differ
ent occasion and therefore had no significance.
' 1 showed that Dr. Wendte's statement .was
incorrect, and that there was. nothing in the
gospel' narrative 7 to imply that Peter's name
was given on a different occasion. : , -â  - '^/
â Dr. Wendte's answer . is , an offer to mail his
original pamphlet to any one who wishes to
read it. -".-, > â  "â - ' '"' *? ; *'-'- ;ii â¢' -7 ; â â
(c) Peter was the rock ' because he spread the
church, . -' â -'â¢;, : . .-" .
.. My reply to this extraordinary interpreta
tion was to warn Dr. Wendte not to. mix his
metaphors.' " - ','.'?. â¢".â 'â ? r'* â  *_ r : > . ---
Dr. Wendte answered 'that U was I who
mixed' the metaphors and that he made no
such objection. To show where the responsi
bility lies let me quote Dr. Wendte's first letter :
"Jesus, no doubt, depended greatly on Peter to
spread his gospel and build up his cause on earth.
This is not only shown by his | indicating him as
the rock on which his church was to be founded,"
etc. " ; * â¢ '-. -' ''â '-. .â¢ 7. ' .'.
If this is not a mixture of metaphors I do
hot know what is. Moreover, Dr. Wendte has
not the excuse of Irish blood unless, indeed,
he borrowed the objection from his theological
cook. â â .â¢â â¢â¢ ; . '-Â
To explain away Christ's words, , "Thou art
Peter and upon this rock will I build un
church," by saying that St. Peter spread the
church is to turn the apostle into a rolling
stone.- â  ' â ' -â¢ :
. Dr. Wendte did not try to justify his inter
pretation. .. -.. â â¢':â "â  - i 'â - " .'.'. ' . '':S-.:'
1. Peter was not the rock. -
Dr. Wendte objected that Peter, was not the
Rock when. he denied his master and when his
master rebuked him. :<'
In answer I admitted the objection and drew
Dr. . Wendte's attention to ; the fact that the
words of Christ only, promised to make Peter
the Rock. That promise was not fulfilled until
after the 'Resurrection,, and therefore Dr.
Wendte's objection is worth nothing. .
Dr. Wendte replies by saying thatl am preju
diced. â¢.-''. â¢â¢.â â¢â¢'
' : *â â¢" NEW OBJECTIONS. â¢ '..-
Though Dr. Wendte did not attempt to sub
stantiate : his - old objections, -he â¢ brought tor
ward- in his reply two new objections. One
that the rock meant Peter's faith and the other
that Doellinger is authority for, the statement
that none of '. the early church .writers in
terpreted the text as implying the primacy of
Peter. â  * . â "'â¢ n --â â :â '? â â¢*â -.*
OBJECTION NO. 1.
.' Let us now see what Dr. Wendte's first ob
jection amounts to. He says the. more he
reads the passage in questionâ art a
rock, and . upon this rock will I build : my
church"â the more firmly he is convinced that <
Christ referred to St. Peter's faith. Let us sup
pose he did. - When we say that the courage of
a general won a battle, do we separate the gen
eral from his courage? If .we declare, that
such and such a building Is a monument to
the skill of an engineer, do we divide the man
from his ability? - ;. .
So, if we admit that Peter's faith was the
rock foundation on which Christ would build
the church, what warrant have we for separat
ing Peter from his faith? It was on Peter as
endowed with that "faith which fails not"; it
was on Peter the . confirmer of the brethren;
it was on Peter the shepherd of the sheep and
lambs; it was on Peter in the concrete that
Christ founded his church in such wise that
the gates of he'd should not prevail against it:
Dr. Wendte seemed .to. be laboring under a
lamentable confusion of ideas in interpreting
this* text. He completely forgets that Christ
does not hand over the building of the church
to Peter. He himself is the architect and mas
ter builder. He, not Peter, lays the founda
tions; he, not Peter makes it strong, to resist
death and hell. His power, not Peter's faith,
erects the building on the solid rock.
The office of Peter or the rock is not to spread
the faith, but to sustain it. He is the center of
unity. ' He holds the building together though
winds blow and rain beats and floods surge
around. When, in the course of time, ideas
clash with ideas . and : truth seems to' be set
against truth the office of Peter is to declare
the faith. For that is he set by his master.
Dr. Wendte of course believes that the Mas
ter was a * mere man, and he may deride the
idea that Christ could preserve" his church
from the fate of all human institutions, schism
and decay. Rut Christians believe otherwise.
To them Christ was God, and he possessed the
wisdom and power of God. If therefore he
wished to preserve his truth intact he could do
so. If he wished to keep his church one he
overcame all obstacles. That he willed his
church to be one and to be indefectible is the
only rational conclusion the unprejudiced
mind can draw from the words "Thou, art
Rock, and upon this Rock will - 1 build my
church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it." . 'â :â -.,â¢ .:
And, as a matter of fact, every attempt to
build a church on a foundation "other than
this rock has met with disaster. Let Dr.
Wendte look at the history of all the reformed
churches, his own included. He speaks about
them being founded on ideas, on truth, on
virtue, on* faith: He might as well recom
mend our Harbor Commissioners to build the
new ferry depot on , wind, i Ideas are like the
shifting sands and Dr. Wendte knows the fate
of the house Which was j built upon the sand.
Already that fate, has come I upon the churches
which would not build* upon- Peter's rock.
Sects, heresies, divisionsâ all the evils of the
latter days are rampant among them and faith
is dead. . -'-95SWR
i There is only one church which knows the
truth and is not afraid to proclaim it. The
church in which Peter still 'lives and teaches
never falters in her declaration of Christ's
revelation. No matter how the gates of hell
may rage, her faith falls not, and .all through '
the centuries she confirms the brethren.
objection NO. 2. *
. Dr. Wendte next quotes from Janus, and
ascribes the quotation . to- Doellinger. I have
already. explained that there is absolutely no
evidence to connect Doellinger with Janus, and
that there Is every reasOn to . believe that the
book was not written by Catholics at all. Any
how, let us tee how much the objection is
worth : .
"Of all the fathers who Interpret these passages
In the Gospels (Matthew xvi:lÃ. John x.vi:l7),
not a 'single one applies them to ; the Roman
Bishops as Peter's successors. How* many fathers
have busied themselves with these' texts, yet not
one of them whose r commentaries we possessâ
Origen, Chrysosiom, Hilary, Augustine, Cyril.
Theodoret, . and - those whose ! interpretations- are
collected in catenas has dropped tbe faintest hint
that the primacy of Rome is the. consequence of
the commission and' promise â¢to Peter; not one of
them has - explained the' rock or, foundation on
which Christ would build his church If the office
given to Peter to be transmitted to his successors,
but they understood by It either Christ himself, or
Peter's confession of faith in Christ; often both to
gether. Or else they thought Peter . was the
foundation equally with all the other apostles, the
twelve being together the foundation stones of the
church (Revelations xxi: 14). .The fathers could
the less recognize in the power of . the keys and tne
power of binding and loosing any special preroga
tive or lordship of the Roman Bishop, Inasmuch as
âwhat is obvious |to any one at first sightâ
did not regard a power first given to Peter and
afterward conferred in precisely the same i words
on all the apostles as. anything peculiar to him or
hereditary in the line of Boman Bishops, and they
held the symbol of the keys as meaning just the
same as the . figurative expression of binding and
loosing." . ; . â¢-...
*, In order to show how far different were the
sentiments of Doellinger from those of James,
let me quote frbm, his ""First Age of Chris
tianity, etc.," vol. I, p. 47: ..-;â ;
"At the turning-point, when his ministry
was closing and his suffering about to * begin,
Peter made confession that Jesus Christ was

thirdly, Christ would give him the keys of his

heaven. iJ.K .. y\-yy< '>"'. ;â  'â  :<:.;â¢-;<.;:';â :.â :

a -house, Now, first, Simon : Bar. Jona
perceived why - the L Lord â¢ originally named
him Cephas, the rock. And thus Christ,
like St. Paul afterward, has combined the two
similes of a home and of family life. He wills
to build' his house, the "Imperishable church,
never to be overcome by the powers of death,
on the believing and confessing Simon, who
again is to be its foundation in the same sense
'as all the apostles are according to St. Paul or
St. John, though â  excelling all others *in I his
specialty as "chief foundation-stone.'-' And' in
this house built upon- him, Peter is to have the
duties and powers, not of I the master of I the
houseâ that Christ is and remainsâ but of the
steward. These were promised him under, the
symbol of the keys, whereby j he. is 'â  enabled to
open tbe treasures of ihe house, to guard the

he had before assured hfm of his future; ex

he must also surpass the other apostles iii love
to him, and be a rock-man in love as in faith,
giving -him -Â» thereby ,'7 an ; opportunity v of

the charge - thrice repeated, 'Feed â  my -lambs;

was given to the whole church, including the
apostles, and Peter was placed â  in the same re

Now, as to the question of fact, is it true that

â¢them as he.iswith.Bellarmine or Suarez. It

His Craft.
: : Hermits who make their homes in the
caves and forests of ; California are plenti
ful,-but a hermit who makes his ; home on
the water is not so common. The first one
that has ever been seen in the bay of San
Francisco iB now living in a small scow, or
ark, in the cove near Black 'Point? There
he spoÂ»'ls his days and' with the exception
of an occasional drifting? cruise along the
front in a small skiff , he never leaves the
home he has made for himself on the old,
battered craft which is named "Southern
Pacific." 7
The hermit is well ; known around
Meiggs wharf, and in fact had it not been
for the boatmen and Custom-house officers
he would have starved long , ago. â¢ The
runners for the various butchers and "gro
cery firms who trade with the deep-water
ships- also \ put an .occasional* donation
aboard ,-â¢ and in '; . this way the hermit man
ages to sustain life. j When questioned he
says he : belongs 'to "The â¢'â¢ Order of the
Messiah," and that in bis day he preached
"The Gospel of Freedom.'.'
Every morning, rain or shine, he is up
before sunrise.' Climbing a ladder raised
against an impromptu mast be reaches a
small platform. On this he kneels and be
gins, his morning orisons. First he sings
a hymn. Sometimes 'his voice can 'be
heard chanting the melody at Black Point
and at other times he can barely be | heard
by the fishermen who are waiting the turn
of tide 'in . Black -Point - Cove. Then ihe
will read a chapter from the | Bible, gener
ally from the enistles written by St. Peter,
and after that he prays that the. kingdom
of the Messiah may. come and that heaven
be established on earth. If it is a fine

through the night, "Why don't â  you : pay

The old man called back, "I haven't any
more chain to pay; out." The scow cap
tain answered, "Why in -7~?didn't? you
say so before?" and then he gave orders to
heave in the slack on his own best bower. -

by the artist he said: "The churches are

HE SAVED LEAVENWOETH.
The. Perilous Adventure of a Union
Scout in 1864.
The man who saved Fort Leavenworth
in 1864, recei /ing physical injuries which
have incapacitated him for the support of
his family, is now a suitor to the United
States Government. He desires reasonable
compensation for the privations.perils and
injuries which he suffered in his country's
cause. He was not an enlisted man at the
lime he performed this patriotic and ex
traordinary service, having * served three
years intlie army and been honorably dis
charged.. He was then acting as a volun
teer scout, and his services can only be re
quited by the bill for his relief now.penu
ingip Congress., ... * . ..
Itwasin 1864; when Price, the rebel gen
eral was threatening Fort Leavenworth
and all of Eastern Kansas. That State
and Missouri were both under martial law.
Governor Carney and General Deitzler, at
the head of the* Kansas State militia, had
their forces in the field on the Missouri
border under Geneial Curtis. General
Pleasanton, the Federal commander, was
near Independence,' Mo., separated from
Curtis by - Price and doing nothing. If
Carney- could not communicate with
Pleasanton and get him to co-operate with
Curtis, Kansas was at Price's mercy.
At this juncture the Governor sent, for
D. ' W. Bontwel', an.hoporably. discharged
Union soldier, who had frequently done
scout duty and knew â¢ the country
.thoroughly. â - A _ concise statement of the
situation, giving the position and strength
of Curtis' command in detail, was written
out by Governor Carney arid committed to
memory by Boutwell, as it would not do
to ; trust such dangerous information to
paper. .The. rest of the story is best told in
Mr. Boutweh's own words:
- "I .went to Kansas City and took a skiff
about 6 o'clock in the evening. This was
the 22d day of October, 1864. When I ar
rived at the mouth of the Little Blue my
skiff . got behind a sand bar and I had to
abandon it and swim ashore. When I
wentup the bank of the river the pickets
of General Price shot at me, but it was so
dark that ' they v could not follow ms.* I
went up the Blue until I came to a narrow*
place, where, - by throwing in rails and
poles, I effected a passage, but in doing so
slipped from the rails and went into. the
mud up to my waist.
. "Being somewhat, acquainted with the
country, I avoided the roads and went
through the woods, and when daylight
came I ; could see ri^ht into the rear of
Price's command. In a few moments I
had passed it, and .soon arrived at the
crossing of the. Big Blue, where I found
General Pleasan ton's command. He
questioned and cross-questioned me .until
he was satisfied of the correctness of the
statement.' â "-<;:*
"vVhile being, questioned by General
Pleasanton, General McNeal was present
and said 'that he (meaning, me) ought to
be tried and* executed ' fort being a sfy.'
After a dialogue between the two.it \-J.i3
decided 'in my favor, and in less time than
it takes to tell it Pleasanton's troops were
in motion and action, and the battle raged
all day. and nearly ail night. .
' "That night I passed' to the rear of Gen
eral Price's command, captured a prisoner,
arrived at Kansas City,' and turned : my
prisoner over to Colonel D. Brockway. who
was provost marshal at Kansas City!"
Mr. Boutwell suffered severely from hun
ger and exposure during his perilous ad
venture. ,'; { Beyond a complimentary joint
resolution of the Kansas Legislature, he
has received no official recognition of his
patriotic service.â New York Commercial

BOTH FACTIONS ARE CONTENT.
Mrs. Cooper in Tears Over the Gratuit
ous Insult Offered Her
Daughter.
Both sides in the First Congregational
Church controversy were claiming a vic
tory yesterday. BSS
On the one hand the friends of Dr.
Brown are exultant on the showing of
strength made by the pastor Wednesday
night and the adoption of every resolution
and motion made by them and the defeat
of every movement made by the friends of
the church, as the anti-Brownites prefer
to be termed.
But the friends of the church, while ad
mitting that they were greatly outnum
bered on every vote, declare that the out
come of the meeting, despite the repeated
defeats they suffered, was a most substan
tial victory for them. -It achieved, they
claim, the two important things that were
sought for. They say that even the most
strenuous and bitter opponents of the
pastor could not have asked for more than
was accomplished. The calling of an im-
mediate council and the abdication of the
pulpit by Dr. Brown completely puts at
rest all contention for the present, and all
interest is now centered in the position
of the proposed council and the facts em
bodied in Dr. Brown's statement of his
defense, which he claimed would disclose
a ploi concocted by Mrs. Davidson more
intricate and diabolical than anything in
fiction.
While no formal charges have been pre
ferred against Dr. Brown it is . generally
understood that the intimate relations
that are said to have existed between him
and Miss Martha Overman are to be the
subject of investigation. â â -â¢*â  "*
Just who are to be witnesses and what
the character of the testimony is to be
that will appear against the pastor it is
not now possible to . state. It is known,
however, that among those who will tes
tify are Mrs. Mary A. â¢ Davidson, Mrs.
Sarah B. Cooper, Mrs. F. J. French and
others who have known Mattie Overman
while she resided in I acorn a.
It is said that several people from the
latter .city have consented to make affida
vit to matters of a damaging character to
Miss Overman. Â_
The first meeting of the board of deacons
of the First Church will be held to-night
to arrange the preliminaries for the coun
cil, which it is said will be iv session
within ten days.
A report gained currency yesterday that
there was a scandal of a similar nature to
that now brewing here connected with Dr.
Brown while he was at Rochester, Mich.
An investigation of the matter however,
showed that Dr. Brown emerged from that
affair without any blame attaching to his
reputation. ".
Mrs. Cooper in an interview yesterday
stated that her greatest * sorrow "from the
present trouble came to her in the insult
offered to her daughter Wednesday night
by Mrs. Szanik, when the latter in"a most
spiteful manner referred to the misfortune
of Miss Cooper in bearing on her face the
traces of an attack of smallpox. Tears
came to the mother's eyes while speaking
of the incident. BlHaMfB
. Mrs. Cooper is more than ever convinced,
she says, that there can be only one out
come to the present affair, as the evidence
against Dr. Brown .is "*. daily growing
stronger. She is now in possession of
three pieces of testimony that she believes
Dr. Brown will be unable to satisfactorily
explain.
CALLING THE COUNCIL.
The Deacons Will Meet To- Day to
Discuss the Preliminary Ar
rangements.
The church council to hear the defense
of Dr. Brown, charged witn immoral con
duct, will convene within the next ten
days. At least that is the statement made :
by D. Gilbert Dexter, and there appears" at
this time no reason to question it.
The deacons, in whose hands the matter
of calling the council rests, will meet to
night to take such preliminary steps as
Congregational usages demand.
"There will be no delay in this matter,"
said Mr. Dexter yesterday. "The deacons
will meet to-morrow and formulate a plan
of action, and I feel safe in saying that the
council will be in session in ten days' time
at the most.
" "It is impossible at this time for me to
say just what churches will be selected,
though I am practically certain that they
will come from what is known as the Bay
District. This includes Alameda and San
Francisco counties. it is our privileee,
however, to call them from any section of
the State or United States if we should
prefer to do so. fKRBPB
"I cannot say as yet how many churches
will be asked to participate in the deliber
ations, though the number will certainly
not be less than ten. It may, however,
include a representative from every church
in the district. Letters will be sent to the
pastors of such churches as the deacons
select, and it will then be a mere matter of
selecting the day of meeting. lam safe,
therefore, in assuming that the council
will nave . heard Dr. Brown's statement
within the time mentioned." y^Bg"|
The standing committee has as yet
taken no action on " the request
of Dr. Warren, that Mrs. " Stock-,
ton's character be investigated. Deacon
Barnard says - ( that .' the - matter will
be held in abeyance until the Brown coun
cil has made a report. â  '.'This is necessary,'',
he says, "because â¢ it :is'i- impossible to* do
more than one thing at a time." .
- The impression has become general that
Dr. Brown preferred charges against Mrs.
Stockton many months ago. As a matter
of fact he only adopted such a - course
within the last three weeks. The stand
ing committee, . however, ; canvassed the
situation thoroughly and came to the con
clusion that it would be unwise to make
any inquiry until the accusation against
the pastor had either been cleared away or
proven. . -,
MRS. COOPER IN TEARS.
The Insult to Her Daughter Causes
Her the Most Poignant -77
Grief.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper was found in > a
most sorrowful mood yesterday/still
brooding over the insult aimed at her
daughter by Mrs. Szahik at the Wednes
day night meeting. It : had caused the
'..-"' .'" '.'â â  . " â  - â â¢-. -â 'â â  :â¢>â â â¢ â  -â¢.Â»,.-â¢ â :'.-' -â .. .
venerable lady.! a* sleepless night, and be
tween her grief and her weariness she pre
sented indeed a sad countenance. ?*.â â¢
â¢ -â¢: She â  said; she could << stand - any? attack
made on herself personally while carrying
out a policy which % she considered in the
line of her duty, but the wanton and un
feeling fling made at her daughter was too
much for her. -,r .;;*â â  'â -â¢Â» . *Â« â '.;â  ,:*
In explanation of her deep and unusual
emotion, Cooper related the following
sad tale of years ago:
You can readily Imagine how a mother's
heart would be rent to hear a dear, devoted
and only child â¢: characterized in the fearful
language of the woman â ; in questionâ why. It
will ring in .my. ears forever. These were her
words: :â¢ . .; * â¢ -:.-.â 
"\ou freckle-faced, pockmarked, meddle
some creature, you had better get out of this
place!" It 'was hard to bear, very hard. Such
a spirit as that would strike down the maimed,
or the sick or the unfortunate. '*-;'.. â¢:â¢
It made it all the harder to bear when I re
membered what brought this sorrow to our
home. It was during the last year of the war.
in 1805, when the Union refugees were flock
ing into Memphis. I was president of a society
in that city for the protection of refugees, and
supplies of clothing, food and money were sent
to me lor distribution. A poor woman had
come over from Arkansas in an oxcart, with
seven little children. ;-.v.
Her husbandâ a Union manâ hiding out
to get away from the bushwhackers, as, they
were called. She was utterly destitute and
came to me for help, telling me that all her
seven children were down with the measles.
It proved to be the smallpox, and although my
darling children had been vaccinated the year
befoie they were both attacked with the dire
disease. Our beautiful little Mary died, and
precious Hattie was spared to us, the last of
four children. .
This is the first time she has ever been
cruelly treated, and it was in my own church
and by a church member. It is the -hardest of
all the hard things I have had to bear in this
sad and dreadful case. This is all that I can
say. Could anything be more cruel than this?
Does it not show the spirit of some at least of
Dr. Brown's friends? . .
Reverting then to the meeting of Wednes
day night, Mrs. Cooper said she was ex
tremely gratified over it, as the outcome
was eminently satisfactory to her. Con
tinuing, she said:
I was very much surprised at the number
who voted "with us, in view of the fact that
such great efforts had been made to muster
the strength of the other side. - Why, they had
members present from Alameda and Oakland
and from as. far away as San Jose. I had no
idea there would be so many to stand with me.
Those who did were all of the noble element
and older members of the church. I hardly
knew any of the newer element which Dr.
Brown brought in. '.."*- - â Â«. *.
I don't feel any ill feeling . against Mrs.
Brown. It is commendable for a wife to help
and defend her husband. Of course there are
different methods of doing such a* thing. I
should probably not have taken her method.
It is not a question along the line she took, but
a question of fact. ; ;>
The two things we wanted most, were
brought about at last night's meetingâ the
abdication of Dr. Brown and the early calling
of a council. The results were such as to sat
isfy even those who were most strongly op
posed to Dr. Brown, and I am sure that those
who are in reality his best friends must also be
thoroughly pleased with his determination to
go forward as he has decided to do. . ;
Many of Mrs. Brown's statements were not
in accordance with facts. That is all I care to
say on that subject. My diaries are in the
cellar and I have been so busy all day receiv
ing my friends wMb called to sympathize with
me that I have had no opportunity to look up
the dates in connection .with the Stockton
matter. Mrs. Brown, I know, has said some very
harsh things of me and I can only say that I
am willing to have a calcium light of criticism
cast on my life from now to my early child
hood days. .'â¢â 'â ,-. '.--. â¢: . , .-
Mrs. Cooper then related Per connec
tion with Mrs. Stockton, as follows:
In 1890 Mrs. Stockton was recommended to
Mrs. K. Wiggins for admission to the letter's nor
mal training school for < kindergaten teachers.*
During her year of tuition under Mrs. Wig

kindergarten schoolsâ that one known as the

course withers. Wiggins, some time in 1892 I
believe it was, I recommended her for a posi
tion in Port Angeles, Wash. _
She remained there something over a year
and then returned to this City. -Meanwhile I
have received letters , praising her work as a
kindergartner, but suggesting that I be careful
in recommending her, as she did not always
pay her bills or arrange to do so. -
When she returned here she got into the
habit of attending the First Congregational
Church, and one day just after the morning
church service, as she was about to pass out of
the church, I introduced her to "Dr. Brown,
simply mentioning her name. They both ac
knowledged the introduction and then nassed
out of the church, Mrs. : Stockton leaving by
the front door and Dr. Brown passing out of
the door at the side of the pulpit.
Mrs. Stockton was next brought to my' atten
tion when, : much Ito 5 the "surprise of my
daughter and myself, she was propounded for
membership in the church. On that occasion,
I remember my daughter remarking Jo me,
when she saw the surprise expressed in my
looks: "Give her a chance, mother."
Then on the Sunday preceding the Tursish
tea given under the management of Mrs.
French I met the latter, in the church and
learned of the trouble she had had with Dr.
Brown over Mrs. Stockton. I told her our
meeting at that particular time was certainly
providential.
The next day I saw Dr. Brown after the meet
ing of the Congregational Monday Club and
informed . him in confidence of .what I had
heard of Mrs. Stocktonâ mind you, of
what I knewâ arid, this resulted, I believe, in
his. afterward making his â  peace, with Mrs.
.French. Â:..
It is true that I ; have commended Mrs.
Stockton during the present scandal and still
do, for as far as I know she has always been a
most faithful and affectionate worker among
the children. I have never known any one
with a kinder heart.
UNFOUNDED CHARGES.
A? Former Experience of Dr.
Brown, in Which â¢ His Reputa
tion Was Assailed. :
It was reported yesterday that Dr.
Brown had been connected with a scandal
similar to the present one some seventeen
years ; ago in Rochester, Mich., where he
then had a church. In an interview with
Dr. Brown he gave the history of the epi
sode referred to and which showed that he
came forth from . that trial exonerated.
His story was as follows: . -
My first pastorate ; was at Rochester, Mich,
and my success there was ' most flattering!
Shortly after my settling there members of mv
church began to find anonymous letters in the
street making charges of theft and general im
morality against toe. It was evident that the
person who wrote these letters feared to trust
the mails and took this peculiar method of ac
complishing his purpose. These letters were
found for a period extending over eight
months. There were twelve of them in all.
order to fenet out the author I went to
Detroit and employed Tergashis. a well-known
expert on handwriting.. By means of letters
submitted to , him containing various hand
writings he concluded the anonymous letters
had been written by a certain man; who was
then a minister and who was subsequently
found guilty of having stolen $2000. Â â¢
I then called a council, and ; after numerous
witnesses had been heard in reference to the
matter, the council completely exonerated me.
The conclusions of the council were published
in the Rochester Sun of March 13, 1879, and
are as follows : .:"â - .-â¢â¢;..':
In conclusion, this council would express its
utter i abhorrence of- the course pursued by the
author of the anonymous and forged letters,
which we have : examined ,* and described,
stirring up strife among the peaceable and
assailing the character of the innocent, and
that too, in the darkness of anonymous and
forged accusations." ~ ;<.--
We reprobate .with all the stress which do
mestic peace,' - personal purity and Christian
religion enjoin, such vile and slanderous at
tempts, and would place upon them the brand
of indelible infamy; and we would also brand
their author as an enemy of ; religion and of
humanity itself. .^:" â *,' â â *.-- / ' ;. .
;We ' extend, * therefore, to the slandered
and Wassailed, parties and members "â  of this

many of .us have known for years, and | known

Raleigh Barcar, . grand, sachem -of the
State League of Iroquois Clubs, has issued
the following call -for. the annual conven
tion :
To Iroquois Clubs in Californiaâ Gentlemen:
The annual conference of the State League ,of
Iroquois Clubs of California will be.h eld at
Pythian : Hall. 909 Market street, San Fran
cisco, on Washington's birthday, February 22,
1896, at 10:30 a. m. (See article 9, constitu
tion.)
' In the annual convention the clubs of the
Iroquis League are entitled to one delegate for
each club and an additional delegate for every
twenty members. . . . ? "
The Iroquois League has borne an honorable
part in securing past Democratic triumphs,
and in the Presidential campaign of 1890 will
have a field for its most active efforts. In Cali
fornia it is particularly desirable that a Legis
ture shall be secured* which will lessen the
burden of excessive taxation. The people de
mand a more economical administration of
the affairs of the State of California. The re
sponsibility rests upon every Iroquois to labor
to the ena-that it may bo secured. Success in
National -or State affairs can only be won by
organized efforts on the Dart of every member |
of the league. ; Let the convention have a rep
resentation . from .every club ; that measures
may be taken to perfect our organization and
extend its influence throughout the State.
â¢ Visiting delegates will be entertained by the
San Francisco club with the generous hospital
ity for which that organization has been noted
in the past. Very respectfully, ; .

were swelled so that the army of ticket
buyers extended to the Sutter-street Mar

The crowd was an orderly one. The
quarreling that often attends such pre
performance functions was conspicuously
absent. r
One of the firm remarked that it was the
most intelligent assemblage of the many
that have waited be. ore its doors for the
coveted bit of pasteboard *. that entitled
them to hear Patti or some of the big
opera companies. Prominent musicians
and representatives of society's charmed
inner circles were among . the "liners."
Bevies of fashionable ladies made unsuc
cessful attempts to reach the curtained
nook where L. A. Morgenslern and four
assistants were disbursing, tickets, but the
forbidding frown of one of the four stal
wart policemen deterred them. All appli
cants were limited to six tickets.
By noon yesterday the house was sold
for the 10th"inst. and the most desirable
seats were .disposed- 4 of for the 12th and
14th. Tickets were sold at $5,' $3 and $2,
but as early as yesterday afternoon the
$2 tickets for the gallery were being sold at
an advance of 200 per cent. Tne receipts
by 5 o'clock p. m. j esterday were nearly
$9000. â  * - 3
."Oh, the women! The women ["groaned
one of the exhausted assistants, "I would
rather sell to ten men than to one woman.
They brought their friends with them in
nearly every instance, and held conversa
tions about what they should do under
the circumstances, and what it would be
well to do if the circumstances were en
tirely different. They would have spent
an hour in such discussion if we had al
lowed them."

MARRIED AT HIGH NOON
Wedding of Miss Jarboe and J.

MRS. BULL (FORMERLY KVTIIRYN JARBOE).
ciate editor of Munsey'p Magazine. Noon
was the hour set. for the; ceremony, 7and
on the very first "stroke of [ the midday
hour the bridal party enterea the church.
Punctualityâ it is pleasing to recordâ
now considered very good form. 7 - ' *
It was most fitting that the wedding of
this young couple should have been cele
brated in this City. Although for the past
two years Mrs. Jarboe and her daughter,
the bride of yesterday, have made their
home in New York, most of their inter
ests are centered here. The name of Jar-;
boe is closely identified with the history
of ' the State, and : - the ; handsome young
bride is a native daughter. .Mr? Bull also
claims California as his State, and on the
local staff of a San Francisco paper he be
gan his journalistic career. His bride also
has literary tastes and capabilities as a
short-story writerâ tender little tales with
a sad and indefinite ending many of
which have been published in Munsey's
Magazine. J
A simplicity that was more impressive
than the most imposing pomp character
ized the ceremony. The decorations of
the church were in keeping with the sur
roundings. Potted palms and growing
plants were used principally. On either
side of the altar the spreading branches of
tall, shining ; rubber % trees met overhead,
forming an arch â of cool greenery under
which the young couple, stood while Rev.
Dr. Moreland, rector of St. Luke's, read the
marriage service.
While : the fashionable audience were
being seated Organist W. A. Sabin ren
dered some delightful selections which in
cluded the "Grand , Chorus in A" from
"Salome," selections from "Cavalleria Rus
ticana," and alto a selection by.Greig. _
The entrance of j the bridal party was as
impressive 'as; it - was 1* novel. Thirty-four
young i;, boys,' led 'â  by Va "i diminutive" man
bearing aloft . the 'â *. cross, and singing in
their fresh, boyish voices the bridal march
from ''Lohengrin," ushered \in the ; bridal
procession. Following the choristers came
the ushers, in * English * morning wedding
costume, with frock coat and gray trousers,
each wearing a jacqueminot rosebud in his
buttonhole. These ushers were ; Frank
Owen; Addison Mizner, Samuel - Board
man, Edward Sheldon, Professor Richard
son of the University of California and
Dick Harrison.
- Following the ushers and preceding the
bride, who entered leaning on- the arm of
her brother, Paul Jarboe, walked the maid
of honor, Miss Kate Clement. The groom
and his best * man C. P.- Hanley, met the
bridal party as the altar? /'â -"-.
During (the ceremony a;' jubilate, com
posed i by the organist, W. A. Sabin, was
rendered by the choir, and at the close of
the service their voices rang out strong and
clear in the impressive hymn, "On our way
rejoicing." After the ceremony the bridal
party and a ; limited V number of " invited
quests : repaired to the residence of Paul
Jarboe; on Taylor and Washington streets,
Where a bridal breakfast was served.
7At - the ' home ' all ; the apartments were
fragrant with the \ perfume of ; choice " cut
flowers, which, placed-; in vases and bowls,
were freely distributed throughout ' the
house.
. The dejeuner was served at small tables,
and seated at the' bride's table were: Mr!
and Mrs. Case ; Bull, Mr. and 1 Mrs: Paul
Jarboe, v Mrs." Jarboe. Miss Owen,' Miss* Pey

;**:<;'; at the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium.
Dr. W. W. Case held the interest of a
large audience for two hours at the audi
torium of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation last evening.
7 By means of charts, pictures, skulls and
even living models he, explained that the
conformation of the skull is a true indica
tion of native or cultivated propensities.
He exhibited the skulls of a Flathead In
dian, a Digger Indian and a member of
the demi-monde. The lecture assumed a
dramatic interest when the divine ordered
the lights extinguished, and, placing a
lantern within. the woman's skull, he ex
plained that she had been one of the most
notorious characters of the . City, .'and
called ; attention :to 7 the transparency of
those portions of the skull whose thinness
showed an abnormal development of the
lower propensities. â â â¢"'

UNIQUE WHEELED CHAPEL.
The Remarkable Mission Work
Performed by H. J.
Hills.
VISITS THE REMOTE PLACES.
He Preaches, Founds Sunday-Schools
and Gives Away Bibles in Twelve
Languages.
* Harry J. Hills, chaplain .of the mission
car Immanuel, sent forth by the Baptist
church to do evangelical work through
out America, is at the Baldwin.
The Immanuel is a complete residence
and chapel combined on wheels. The car
is the largest that ever came over the
Southern Pacific track, being eighty-five
feet from end to end. It is now at Sacra
mento, while Mr. Hills has come down in
connection with his mission work.
, He says the Immanuel is one of four
cars sent out over the country by the
Baptist Publishing Society of Phila
delphia, the society that sustained a
$700,000 loss by fire; Sunday morning, on
which there was but 400,000 insurance.
. The chapel in the Immanuel is filled
with a pulpit, organ and all the para
phernalia of a complete church. The car
also has a kitchen and all the other
auxiliaries of a home.
Chaplain Hills is enthusiastic about the
work that is being done by aid of the car.
"We go literally out in the highways
and byways," he said, "and preach the
gospel where . it would not be heard were
it not for the people who are sustain
ing us. .
"No collections are ever ta-ren up by us.
We have on board the car, in addition' to a
complete chapel, a library of more than
100 magazines and books, and people may,
at certain times, come aboard and read
them. '
"We : go to, places where theie are no
churches, as a. rule, and oftentimes have
as many as two or three sermons a day in
the car.
"Our object is to do all we can to aid the
church, and we are, in â  fact, a ; forerunner

us. They are in twelve different lan

was determined upon a full , investigation

AGAINST REFUNDING.
i -
j The American Socialists Denounce the
Proposed Bill for the Relief
of Huntington. â¢
l .
A small but enthusiastic audience as
sembled last night in Kohler & Chase's
hall on O'Farrell street at the weekly
meeting of the- Society of American Social
ists. The speaker of the evening was J.H.
Burke, who, it will be remembered, was
clerk of the Board of Supervisors in 1881.
He took for his subject, "A minute ex
amination of the rascalities of the South
ern Pacific Railway Company, with a.view
of ascertaining how much longer the Cali
fornia* public will tolerate it as a private
corporation.*' The eloquent lecturer drew
a most vivid word-picture of what he con
sidered the iniquities of the railway com
pany, and expressed a hope that it would
soon cease to be the octopus of the West.
At the end of the lecture Mr. Burke pre
sented a set of resolutions against the
funding bill. The resolutions having been
read Denis Kearney; rose and moved that
tney be amended so as to 'place the social
ists of California distinctly and unequivo
cally in favor of the Government owner
ship of all railways in the State. The
amendment was made as requested.
Another gentleman - protested against
the word "leg-pulling" employed in the
resolutions as describing the methods of
certain alleged railway politicians. The
objectionable expression was eliminated,
the chairman remark that it would
seem more dignified to "take the legs out."
Short speeches were? made by Denis
Kearney and others denouncing the
Southern Pacific, C. P. Huntington and
Mayor Sutro, after which the resolutions
were adopted unanimously.
JORDAN ON RICHARD ROE
He Discusses the Forces of
Heredity That Made the
Man's Character.
We Are a Mosaic of All Our Ancestors.
The Three Great Men of the
Century.
David Starr Jordan lectured last night
before the Veterinary Department of the
University of California, corner of Post
and Fillmore streets, upon "The Heredity
of Richard Roe," who as an ordinary de
scendant of the Anglo-Saxon race was
nsed by the speaker as an individual illus
tration of the way in which the character
istics of the ancestors are inherited by the
offspring.
During his discourse Dr. Jordan said:
Richard Roe's character was a mixture of
things brought to him from various sources.
Tbe individual is made up of diverse gifts
that have been used by others long before he
was born. Some people live in conventionali
ties and never do anything . except what their
ancestors did.
So-called double lives arc due to the fact
that certain tendencies are . not properly
united in the individual. The 'art of life is to
hold one's self together. Some people that we
call hypocrites are not hypocrites, but only at
times they are unable to bold their proper
character. * When an individual has succeeded
in bringing these discordant elements to
gether we think of him as an individual
whole. .
The ancestors leave the man a mosaic and if
be works the mosaic right he has a complete
picture. â¢. :.-â¢â¢â :.-â 
People are pretty generally good, because
man , for many generations has had pretty
good ancestors. MlJ || Â» | [ljlMlllH.Ul'J!lllJll.lixli-M-Ul
Every man has twice as many ancestors as
each of his parents had. The great majority of
the people of the United States, if they could
trace their ancestors back, would find that
they embraced the nobility of England. I
doubt if there is a single family that has not
through intermarriage at some time or an
other acquired blood from Italy, Germany,
France and other European nations.
Those things that his ancestors inherited and
those characteristics that they possessed were
inherited by Richard Roe.
; Richard Roe couldn't inherit all his father's
and all his mother's peculiarities, for he would
then have twice as many as each.
It is better to have a good thing yourself
than to have had an ancestor that had it.
The great question with scientists is: Did
Richard Roe's father give him what he was or
what he might have been? What a child
really inherits from his parents is what his
parents really were. â -, *. *
The secret of individual greatness, is the
ability to know how to make others great. The
fame that comes from large common-sense Is
real greatness.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financlal.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 6.â The financial J
markets were better to-day, the heavy subscriptions >
for the new Government loan having had a
strengthening effect on securities of , all kinds.
According to bankers, the good effect of this will 1
be reflected in a further improvement, not only at )
the stock exchange, but in the commercial world j
â¢swell. Already there is more disposition on the
part - of- banks to discount paper now that it is
known that the new loan Is a success. This de
parture on the part of capitalists will be welcomed
in business circles for the reason that the buying of
paper had been practically suspended for nearly a
month. - - .
The deposits of over four millions in gold at the
Sub-Treasury In connection with the bond sub
scription Induced purchases of stocks, for the rea
son .bat it clearly indicates that there will be little
difficulty in securing the funds to make tbe settle
ment with the Treasury Department. The pre- i
mium on metal was shaded a bit to-day. and fiom |
all accounts the first installment will be met by I
bidders without disturbance to the market. . Lon- I
don did not respond to the extent generally ex
pected, and this was a disappointment. This, |
' with some profit-taking, rather dampened the bull- j
ish ardor, and In the afternoon trading the early
advance of 1.4 to 21 2 per cent was partially lost.
The features of the speculation were the Indus- 1
trials, the grangers, Metropolitan Traction and
Southern lla 1 way. Sugar was again in sharp de- |

TRADE STEADILY: IMPROVING.
Cheerful Advices From the Financial
7 Center of the Country.
The circular of Henry Clews, the well-known
banker of Nfw York,* says: "The general condi
tions affect ii .g â¢ financial affairs are working into a
more settled and normal â  state. ..The widespread
process of liquidation that . has ', been in operation
for many months, Indeed ' for nearly ] three years
past, seems to have culminated. ''Foreigners have
ceased to return our securities; the scare and dis
trust of English investors has not only abated, but
Is succeeded by occasional 'spurts' of j demand j for
our stocks and bonds. Continental bankers are
understood to have shown a gratifying confidence
in American credit by important bids for the new
issue of Government bonds, thereby Intimating that
they take our currency derangements less seriously
than do the Anglo Saxons. * ,?; -- :. .^.-? -. '.*; ... 'â * >r J
"Our trade balance is getting into | a more whole-''
some shape. The excessive ; Imports that followed
the reduction â¢of < import I duties I are now ,- rapidly
abating. , Our exports, held back for four 1 months
following the harvest, are now going! out in much
larger volume,' and ; that in the face of ; advancing
prices ' for farm v products. '-'â  The extraordinary
changes Â« ln ; European politics and the dangers
thereby suggested are making foreign investors
more willing to consider the . merits of American
securities, owing to their exemption from the con
tingencies . now affecting . the > Olds World â  issues.
The foreign exchanges are turning quite decidedly
in our . favor, Gold . Is coming 1 from I London, and
although the arrivals are , rather due >; to subscrip
tions to the new loan than to ordinary commercial
'* ' -"- â¢ â  â â â  .- .--:â - -. :.-..". '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1896.
remittances, yet the bonds going out will help to
ease our balance! with Europe, and ; may possibly
reach the result of making the importation of gold
a paying operation. - -â¢â¢>-,: ' ; \ --.-*:.* *â¢*..'.'.:.;- .â¢' ;
- "The Item ' of i foreign ' balances resting here Is In
an unusually conservative position. < That balance
has perhaps never been - so low as it is to-day. Â In
deed, the process of ; liquidation has been so com
plete and radical that it is doubtful whether,' out
side of our securities | permanently held by foreign
ers, this country has for twenty years been so com
pletely out of debt to other nations as it is to-day. *
: â  "In trade circles there is an evident tendency to
ward ' better business. The : change <is especially
apparent in I the - iron and - cotton - goods markets,
and to some extent : also In groceries. $ The . trade
reports from* interior points show a better feeling.
But the high rates of : discount and some sensitive-,
ness about the outcome of large maturings of loans
at this juncture, have in some measure held large
operations in check for the moment."
IRON TRADE LOOKING UP.
The Iron Trade Review says: "Favorable signs
are more numerous in the iron trade and the last
fortnight has put a better aspect on , nearly every
department of the market. ':. The advance in Besse
mer pig iron and in steel billets noted" last week
has continued, .'. and lin : the case .of ' the ; latter
: amounts now to | $2 50 from the lowest point
1 touched in the '- holidays. -' Finished material shows
irregularities, but in nearly all lines there is a
firmer feeling with increased buying. In part \ the
larger demand is attributed to better consumption,'
In part to a desire on ; the part of buyers to antici
pate higher prices. The j disparity between ' cur
rent consumption and the capacity of rolling mills
and steel works is still a dominating element in
the situation; yet reports from all I directions indi
cate that the last week has brought a larger ton
nage to most mills than any preceding one in three
months-".

CAREER OF A GREAT SINGER.
An English .Woman Who Attracted the
Attention of Napoleon.
Early in 1794 ; Mrs. Billington left : Eng
land, ; accompanied by, her . husband and
brother. .7 She traveled â *> in : Germany and
Italy, and at Naples she appeared/through
the good offices of Sir.William.Hamilton,
at I, the *" San i Carlo, : where ; ' : her singing
created an extraordinary impression;". -
7 Here her husband died suddenly," not, as
it was alleged; without suspicion of poison,
and after a stay of over a year: she made a
sort of progress^through, ltaly; singing at
all 1 * the ** chief â  towns with unvarying J suc
cess. At Venice her recovery from a' se
vere , illness was celebrated by 3 the opera
house being illuminated for three nights.
At Bologna Napoleon heard ; her, and by
him she was introduced to' Josephine, who
was s then at i Milan. .:: Here ' she 'â -. met and
married her . ; second;; husband, M. (after
ward Count) Felissent,' a handsome young
Frenchman, who ; seems â  to have followed
the French aj-my in some unexplained ca
pacity;' : ; â ; //V -.'.'/. .â /â â â 
â â ;â â .. Scandal, ever ' busy " with -' all that " con
cerned r ~ her, re ported him ;to*l be an im
postor and a rogue, and! there â can*' be no
doubt that he treated her badly, probably
because he, was not content to occupy the
insignificant position which 1 had satisfied
James Billington. '; Tire pair were married
in 1799, and at first they settled at Treviso,
but two years had scarcely elapsed before
Mrs. Billington returned to London, where
she continued to sing until 1811.
- Her reappearance created a great stir in
the > musical .world. The managers of
both Covent Garden and Drury Lane
tried to engage her, and eventually it
was arranged that she should ap
pear :; alternately at both houses.
In the course of the year 1801 she is said to
have .made no less than Â£15,000, an im
mense sum for ; a singer to earn even in
these days, 1 and one which seems almost
impossible at that time. National Review

The Williams Building After the Storm â . Looking for the Dead and Injured.
"\" ' [Sketched by a "Call" artist,] â '.
a dead man and a baby girl lay. They
were almost side by. side, the silent corpse
a victim of one man's penury and an
other's greed, and the loud-voiced little
one whose lusty ; lungs proclaimed 'J in
shrieks her escape from serious injury. ,
It was at the gore of ban Pablo avenue,
Brush- and Twenty-second streets, where
R. J. and J. C. Williams, the grocers,
were having a $2500 building erected in
which to transact their business, and from
which they expected goodly returns in
rentals of the flats above.
Half -a dozen workmen were engaged at
the time in the building, either on the first
or the second floor, and without a mo
ment's warning the entire edifice toppled
over, lifted by the wind, and, smashed into
kindling on San Pablo avenue.
The only thing to be wondered at is that
poor Charlie Hurley was the sole victim to
give' up his young life, while others, in
what, might reasonably be expected to be
more risky positions, escaped with only a
few scratches and bruises.
Hurley, a lad not quite 22 years of age,
went to work yesterday morning helping
his father, who was nailing laths on the
lower floor of the building. â¢ They were
alone on that story and when 11 o'clock
struck | from a neighboring clock Charlie
spoke over to his father, saying:
"Dad, I wish it was dinner time; I'm
as hungry as a wolf."
Before noontime the unfortunate boy's
body was occupying a slab in the morgue.
In the second story of the building were
Tom Morrow, W. ,J. 7 McDonald, Andy
Pierce and William S. Judson, who were
laying the groundwork for the plastering,

building toppled over? and they were
cheering each other on \ in their work with
gossip and song, little thinking any possi
ble danger could befall them.

McDonald, limping from a much-bruised
limb, was around the ruins of the building
later in the afternoon. .
'. The unpainted five-facade cupola, which
loomed up so prettily when the sun peeped
over Mount Diablo, lay battered and
broken across the San Pablo avenue car
track. Ad a matter of fact the cupola was
the , only thing *â¢ in sight to relieve the
monotony .of the , big pile of debris i and
give the observer any idea that there once
was a building on the site covered with
broken lumber. â"?.-?'
"It was all so \ sudden," stated . McDon
ald.; "I don't know -how to describe it.
The wind was high, and while the build
ing- shook we never; thought of danger.
Suddenly we were lifted as if in a balloon,
and the next thing a crash. It was
' to quick to realize what was happening. I
was dazed, and; l crawled out of a pile of
lumber on top â of me? * There were hun
dreds .* of * people around by that time to
give ; a? helping \ hand, and - ; some of them
took me home.. I'm only slightly bruised."
McDonald's experience was - : similar to
that of his fellow-workmen. They all fell
together within an area of twenty feet
square, and none was hurt to- any * extent.
But on the other floor it was very?dif
ferent. 7 Poor young Hurley was up on a
ladder _*"< tacking the *?" laths. His ? was a
double fall, if such it might be called. He
fell from the building and the ladder, too,
and when his comrades dug him ; out :of *
the debris he lay unconscious with a sharp
corner *of one . of the scantlings forming
the ladder buried in his left temple?: That
is what killed him, although the other
bruises about him were sufficient to lay
him tip in bed for weeks, even if they did
not prove fatal. .' -
The boy's father, stunned by the weight
of debris breaking about and over him, lay
unconscious for half an . hour * after being

: rescued and carried to the Receiving Hos
pital, where he now lies seriously injured.
, But, while all the men and boys work
ing ; about , the building were â¢ bleeding,
helpless .or dead, there was one little
I cherub, Edna -j Matthiesen, a : pretty six
year-old little .""girl,' tucked securely away
at the foot of a brick wall 'two feet high,*
forming the building's foundation.? Above
her towered ten feet of lumberâ enough to
crush out a score of livesâ but riot a single
pound of it weighed upon the child.
:. .When the ; building was 'blown over,
Edna was amusing herself playing with
â¢the fresh mortar. between the bricks. She
was sticking chips of wood in the soft sub
stance, and became frightened only when
'the loud crash came and i she found herself
imprisoned in a niche, where she was safe
enough from all harm,' bufwhich shut her
away from the? outside world. .'Then? it
was : that she gave vent to her frightened
voice, and it did not take long for her res
cuers to find her among the wood.
. Fortunately about the time of the'catas
trophe Mrs.* Mary Ann Cronin, living on
Twenty-second street, near the scene of
the 'disaster, was. hunting her stray
cow. r. in this pursuit she passed near the
Williams . building and observed two little
girlsâ named Annie Kennedy, aged s? and
Lilly Jackson, aged 6â playing on the side
walk. Mrs. Cronin saw the building tot-?
tering, and - anticipating ."â . its fall she
screamed: _ r
-."Lilly 1 Anniel Come here, quick 1" ??
The children, frightened at the way they
were being addressed, ran as directed, and
a few seconds later the place where they
stood, was J covered with tons of scantling.
'.-. Mrs. Cronin had also observed little
Edna Matthiesen, and she was able to
direct the volunteer rescuing corps in
their labors, and j tho child was brought
forth with no injury more serious than a
self-inflicted bite of the tongue. .
;, 'Among the rescuing j par was D. H.
Matthiesen, the father of the child, who
had not the slightest ideaV'his baby was
away from her toys at home.
He grabbed his little one in his arms
and began kissing her, mingling bis tears
with hers, for the little one by this time
was more than ever? frightened because
she saw a little blood she had wiped from
her tongue. -7 . 7
. ."I won't do it again, papa," she sobbed.
"Don't take "me to the doctor."

They were - Messrs. \ McDonald, c Pierce,

one hurt was McDonald. The contract
price of the structure was $2000, and it was
being put up in a very substantial*manner.
i "The cause ;of > the accident as ' far/as I

work before the partitions were; in arid be

POLICE OFFICERS AT OUTS

: . Trickeryâ .
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 6.â Marshal
Lloyd and Constable Brotherton are â at
outs as the result of an arrest made by the
latter last evening. It seems that a well
dressed man giving the name of. Albert
Williams called at the house of the j con
stable and asked for? food. Brotherton
immediately arrested him and put him in
the lockup for the night. Marshal Lloyd,
upon hearing of the arrest, went ;to the
prisoner's cell and found that , he was the
same man whom he himself had helped
last ween, and believing him not Ito be a
common vagrant, but a workingman in
hard 7 luck, released . him. .*. Lloyd gave
Williams 50 cents? took him to a lodging
house , and instructed him to ; appear on
Shattuck avenue 'at a certain hour this
morning so that ,he might be seen by
Brotherton and Deputy Marshal Kerns. -
\Villiiams did as he was bid, but Brother
ton did not appear ' at that hour, and so
Williams went ; his way. -At about v 4
o'clock this afternoon the constable re
arrested him and took him to the County
Jail in Oakland; where he was given three
days for vagrancy by Justice Clift. ' Mar
shal Lloyd, when seen this afternoon, ex-
Dressed much indignation at the work of
Brotherton in .arresting and rearresting
Williams. The Marshal ; says that Wil
liams is not an ordinary tramp, but a re
spectable man "down on his uppers,'* and
that the only reason Brotherton* arrested
him was to secure the constable's lee. â¢ "
Lloyd says he will change the lock on
the door of the cell so that Brotherton can
no longer use the place for the j confine
ment of his arrests. He also says that the
lockup is not a suitable place to confine
prisoners for the night, as it has no ac
commodations whatsoever, not even a
chair or bench. "If Brotherton," said he,
"wanted to keep the man for the night he
should have taken him to the County Jail.
There is no reason in his actions with re
gard to this particular case." .?â¢ 7 > ,

pany, and in consequence there -is. danger
of the company cutting off j from the stu
dents any* further courtesies. It seems
that the manager 7of. the transportation
company . offered all college j'â¢ students
round-trip tickets between San; Francisco
and Ukiah at j half rates. Many : tickets
were bought, but hot a corresponding num
ber of collegians used them. It was after
ward discovered that some of the Berkeley
men had been transferring their tickets to
persons other than those entitled to them.
At this the decree was passed that if an
other transfer was detected the privilege of
half-fare Would be entirely cut off.'

7 : The Autopsy Not a Dissection. .
OAKLAND, -; Cal., Feb. 6.â H. Shep
ard, the pension attorney living in this
city, who has many, clients in the Soldiers'
Home at Yountville, says that the story of
old soldiers' bodies being used by medical
students has arisen rOm â¢a * misapprehen
sion of the medical report Of the home.- ;
"Such a story," said Mr. Shepard, "must
have grown out of the sentence referred to
in the report of the 'medical director.
Somebody has confounded an : autopsy
with Â»; the . dissection 'of a j body. It is the
custom in aIL soldiers' homes to h old au
topsies . in all cases where the cause of
death is not very clear. ' At the National
Soldiers' at Washington there used
to be as many as 100 autopsies in a month.
But \ bodies are never given to medical
students to dissect, and a report to the
contrary is preposterous. The regulations
require that every one of these old soldiers
when he dies. shall be buried -with the
honors of war, and bow could that be done
if the bodies were not there? No, there is
nothing ; in the stdry. If the:; soldiers in
the home believed any such thing I should
â¢hear of it from them immediately." .

A Woman's Exchange Trouble.
ALAMEDA, Cal.; Feb. 6.â The mem
bers of the Alameda Woman's Exchange
and Relief Society will give ' their annual
ball in Armory Hall next Tuesday even
ing, but this matter is not uppermost, in
their minds. Mrs. Carpenter, who was
the superintendent of the exchange for a
year or more, has a claim against the so
ciety for $119 for back salary. The claim
is outlawed, but many of the members
look upon the obligation as a moral one
and want to discharge it. â¢ Â»
- Mrs. Carpenter, who is a widow with a
little son and of frail build, is the adopted'
daughter of -.the late Admiral Porter. She
considers, therefore, that she has a claim
upon the Grand. Army of the Republic,
and when she realized that she was unable
to obtain any satisfaction from the Wo
man's Exchange she laid her grievance
before General Hooker Post. '
~ The post at once sympathized with the
lady and appointed a committee consist
ing of Colonel George ,C.Babcbck,C.L.
Metzger and E. B." Dunning to look into
the case. As a' result a call was issued to
the leading ladies of Alameda to meet the
committee in G. A. R. Hall this afternoon.
A lively meeting resulted, and it seemed
to be the opinion of a majority of those
present that ' Mrs. Carpenter \ should be
paid. ' No- conclusion : was reached, how
ever, and another meeting will be held
next Thursday afternoon. 'â¢ - 'â â 
It was during Mrs. Carpenter's superin
tendency of the exchange > that an event
took place which almost caused the so
ciety to disband. Mrs. Carpenter's admin
istration did not give satisfaction to all
the members. .* 7 ' * '' ' ' ' '
- She ; had her admirers, however,? and
there were soon two factions in the so
ciety. Mrs. George L. Birkmaier was then
. president of the exchange, and she sided
with Mrs. Carpenter. The society Was not
then ' incorporated . and a dispute -â¢ arose
over the ownership of the building,* which
was presented to th*Â» society by Captain R.
R. Thompson. % The dispute found its way
into j courts and the case was settled in
favor of the opponents of Mrs. Carpenter.

The Alameda Point Fire. *

St. Joseph's Church Musicales.
ALAMEDA, Cal.? Feb. 6.â A musicale
in aid of St.- Joseph's Church was given last
.night at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Car
pentier on Paru street and Sah Jose avenue.
It was one of the events of the year and was
attended by a fashionable crowd of society
patrons. The rooms of the Carpentier res
luence were tastefully decorated -and
everything was nicely arranged. A lengthy
programme of musical and recitative selec
tions was carried out. most of the talent j

A REPTILE FROM THE SEA
The, Queer-Looking Creature Was
Captured in Monterey
> ,\ Bay. /. ....
It; Is Nearly Five Feet ? Loneâ The
. First of , Its Kind- Ever 7 ..
7 7 7 Seen Here.,
All the fishermen who happened to be at
the water front, and/all the marketmen
along' "Washington street, looked critically
at the new specimen exhibited by Paladini,
and then they all declared in Italian that
they had never seen anything "\ just like it
before. -. * ' ; . .
This wonder of the day was a reptile of
some sort, and nobody knows exactly of
which sort. ' It is much like an alligator,
but a man who used ;to go fishing away
'down in Florida says it is not an alligator.
Very. much like a lizard, too,:, it is, but 'the
fishermen say that! nobody ever saw a
lizard so big a3 that. * -."â "" '':'-..
The verdict of the fishermen, as well as
a verdict ; could" be "obtained, was that, the
reptile is part alligator, part lizard and the
remainder crocodile. , "-;â : -7
It is a mugwump, probably, if there is
any, such' thing as a mugwump where the
crocodiles, alligators and lizards livei^JS^
Whatever the' strange" creature may be,
it was caught by Captain Camilo at.Monte
rey Bay on Wednesday. 7 Captain Camilo
is the fisherman at Monterey for Mr. Pala
tini, and while hauling in his nets late
Wednesday afternoon he discovered the
reptile in the.meshs*s.::He had never seen
that variety of ocean .product before, and
he and the other men of the- sua in the
Monterey region were unable to classify it.
Caotain Camilo carefully fitted^ out the
reptile for a voyage to this City, and now
there is a new curiosity .for the local fish
ermen to talk about.
; The alligator, or. lizard, or crocodile, or
all of them in one, is about four feet and
seven inches in length, and is otherwise of
about the ordinary lizard or crocodile pro
oortions. It is probably a huge sea lizard
pf some kind. > -.. â¢:..;â

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Disastrous Experience of the C.
C. Funk During the South-
Easter.
CREW FLED TO THE RIGGING.
Trouble Brewing Between the Ship
owners and the Boarding-
Masters.
The barkentine C. C. Funk, which put
in here yesterday in distress, had a disas
trous experience of it during the recent
storms. 'She * was on her way from De
parture Bay for Honolulu and : was dis
masted and almost lost. - In his report the
captain says: : .
While in latitude 47 deg. 55 mm. north,
longitude 131 deg. 20 mm. west and twenty
four hours after leaving Cape Flattery, encoun
tered a severe gale which lasted for three days,
starting from southeast to southwest and in
creasing to a hurricane, thereby, making an
enormous heavy and cross sea. Vessel labored
heavily from side to side and was con
stantly under water, breaking adrift water
caskets and everything movable above deck.
On the 31st day of January, when at her
worst and just turning dark, the crew hanging
in the rigging to save themselves from being
washed -overboard, she rolled the fore and
maintopma&t overboard, the wreckage hang
ing alongside, threatening to break up the
hull.
The crew worked forty-eight hours to repair
damage and rig up as much sail as possible.
Had the C. C. Funk not been a good vessel she
would have gone to pieces, for nothing
but a* good ship could weather a gale like that!
1 at first squared off for the Sound, but as I did
not have sail enough she filled herself up, and
as the seas were running like mountains and
most of the sails were blown, to pieces, I
therefore changed my course for San Francisco.
The Ship-owners' Association and the
boarding masters are at outs over a new
rule laid down by the association some
months ago. "â¢ In order to secure a share of
the shipping controlled by the concern
the boarding masters had to put up a $50
guarantee that they would stand by the
association when there was a strike, and
not only supply men when tbey were
wanted, but discipline the union men.
The boarding masters put up . the money,
but now that times are bad they are hard
up and .want it back again. The ship
owners refuse to give up the deposit except
on the understanding that the man who
makes the withdrawal' gets no more
chances of shipping men in the company's
boats. The relations- between the two
bodies are, consequently, very strained,
and a rupture may occurat any time.
The tug Sea King was .out on the bay
with an excursion party yesterday. She
hovered around in the vicinity of where
the City of Chester went down after her
collision with the Oceanic, and it is said
that the party was composed of experts
who were sent out to take soundings in
the interest of the plaintiff in the case
now pending before Judge Hunt? in order
to offset that taken by the defense last
Wednesday.
There was an exciting chase along East
street yesterday, and had it not Deen for
Fred Slocker, the starter for the Ferries
and Cliff House Railroad, the chances are
it might have ended in a suicide. A well
dressed man walked rapidly across' Market
street on East and a few moments later an
elderly woman came, running after him
shouting "Stop 1 Stop!" Slocker, thinking
the man was a thief, held him until the i
woman came up. She at once began to
cry, and putting her arms around the man,
she said: "You won't kill" yourself, will
you? I can't live if you do."
The man did not speak, but when a
young man who was apparently his son
came along a few minutes later he gave in
and went away with them. The last seen
of them they were in a Haight-street car
and as the husband and wife kissed each
other before starting the chances are the
trouble that led to a talk of suicide was all
forgotten..
The American ship Roanoke is probably
the only American vessel of her class that
has come to San Francisco with a negro
officer on board. William P. Callender,
the second mate, is the. man. He was
shipped at Rio de Janeiro and was formerly
second officer of the British ship Lord Ran
dolph. He is a full blooded negro and a
thorough seaman. He will remain with
the Roanoke until she returns to New
York. : mttLWrrmmNmam:^ .â â â¢*.--â¢ ---r? &â¢â â¢*
WATER FOR SHIPPING.
Harbor Commissioners Discuss
the Question at Their -
Meeting.
Later Bids for Work on the New
Ferry Slips Show a Great
Reduction.
The Harbor Commissioners held quite a
lively session yesterday. The new bids
for the repairing of the ferry slips were
opened, and the lowest proved to be just
$675 below the lowest offer made last week.
On that occasion Darby Laydon & Co.
offered to do the work for $2775, while yes
terday B. McMahon offered to take ' the
contract for $2100.
The bids were as follows:. San Francisco
Bridge Company, $27G5, last week's bid
$2800; Darby Laydon & Co., $2747, last
week's bid $2775; Pacific Bridge Company,
12380; James A. McMahon, $2755, old bid
$2384; K. W. McCann & Son, $2200; B. Mc-
Mahon, $2100, and Davis, Jackson & Co,,
$2580. The contract was awarded to B.
McMahon and the bond was fixed at $1000?
When the question of the water supply
for the shipping came up President Colnon
called upon â  Chief Engineer Herman
Schussler of the Sprine Valley "Water Com
pany, who said that company-was dealing
with responsible parties, . but as there was
no contract a change could be made at any
time. "If the Commissioners want to take
the responsibility, we will deal directly
with them," said he, "but as we will have
to spend at least $10,000 to. put >"n meters I
think we should have some guarantee. Wo
will supply the water at the rates fixed by
the Board of. Supervisors and then the
Commissioners can do as they please."
Colnon asked how many hydrants there
were along the front arid Schussler said
he thought about 125,' but Chief Engineer
Holmes said there were 150 and that
meters would have to be' placed; in all of
them. . . â 
Commissioner Cole said he did not think
the board wanted to go into the water busi
ness and argued against such a step. '
"I think it would be a very appropriate
thing to do," said the president. "This
board should supply the shioping and see
to it that the. water is charged for at the
lowest, possible figure. As things are at
present, the' Spring Valley Company sells
its water to a middleman for a lump sum
and the latter makes all the profit." ,;*.-*'
Cole asked if the president had any in
tention of making a profit out of the sup
plying of the ships, and Colnon answered,
"Certainly; not. -This is not a money
making institution."
. * The opinion of Attorney Stratton ; prac
tically ; settled < the â¢ matter. According to
him .the commission . has 'no more
right.' under .the * code, to \ supply shipping
with .water, than it has to peddle milk. All
the necessary facilities could' be provided,
but some one else would -to ; do:, the*
selling. ;' -.''..â ; '-'.*"* ! < :.';-â '.*
: President i Colnon. next referred .-to! the
fact - that Goodall, Perkins & Co. had i
charged the State $97 50 for water for the
tugs Governor Irwin and Governor Mark
ham, and said that the charge should only;
have been $34 82. "V* At this I Edwin Goodall
said that if the State had been charged by
meter and at the rates fixed by the Super
visors the bill would have been $365.:
"Then," answered Mr. Colnon, ; "the
Supervisors must have â  blundered terribly
semewhere when they fixed the rates. ,1
intend to have this thing, rectified, howÂ»
ever, and at the next meeting of the Legis
lature I will have a bill; introduced which
will give us the power to sell water to the
shipping." :'â *'*â  "â 'â¢ -'â 'â¢.'. ''7-
--: On the . suggestion 'of ' Chief Engineer
Schussler it was decided to mit a meter on
the hydrants where the Government fues
get their water/and a test of the actual
consumption will be made next month.
Milk Inspector; Dockerv asked for space
on the front between the Tiburon and
Sausalito ferries for an office. ; After con
sulting with Engineer Holmes ' a ' place
30x100 feet in area was allotted to him on
which a building in which the Marin
County milk will be tested is to be erected.
A communication from* Williams, Di
mond & Co. complaining : of the masters
of the . tugs Sea -: King and? Rescue for
placing their tugs? and scows? in such a
position as to prevent ' the American ship
Roanoke from docking was laid over until
next week.
A BIG SUIT COMPROMISED.
J. Q. Adams Has Received 920,000
From the Southern Pacific Company. .
The case of John Q. Adams against the
Southern Pacific Company for $207,000
damages for breach of contract has been
compromised. Adams securing $20,000.'
The case was tried before Judge Dainger
field last December and the jury disagreed
after being out over thirty hours. â ;. This
arose from the five years' contract which
Adams took to handle the coal supply of
the Southern Pacific. This contract was
rescinded by the Southern . Pacific after a
year, and Adams sued for what he esti
mated would have been his income had
the contract run out.
BUILDING TRADES UNITE
Another Powerful Organization
of Union Workingmen
Formed. â¢
The Objects Are Protection and Sup.
port for All Members of
. the Craft.
The Building Trades; Council was or
ganized last evening at 117 Turk street.
For munths past .a number of energetic
workers in the uniens of the building
trades have been agitating this movement,
and it received the hearty approval of all.
Since the latter part of November but
little has been done toward this end on
account of the election and installation of
officers in the unions, and the new officers
have only recently had time to take up the
matter again. ? v-T^lv;7 '
The object of this central union of all
the building trades is to draw the members'
thereof closer together for, protection and
support. It was found in the past that, no
matter how strong a labor organization
might-be, it was difficult, almost pos
sible, to accomplish anything by itself. It
required the help and support of its brother
unions. As stated in the meeting last
evening, it was not the intention to stand
out independent of all other unions, but to
take the initiative step toward uniting all
unions for the preservation of the Tights of
all organized labor by combining those of
one craft first.
In several of the building trades unions
the eight-hour day and the working-card
systems are now in force and the new or
ganizations will bring all under the same
systems. In this; way the weaker unions
will be as well protected as the stronger,
because an injustice to one is an offense to
the whole craft, and it will. be summarily
dealt with as such.
When the meeting was called to order
last evening delegates were present from
Carpenters' and Joiners' unions Nos. 22,
304 and ,483,- the plasterers, painters and
decorators, cornice-makers and the gran
ite stone cutters. The Amalgamated Car
penters' Union sent word that their charter
prevented affiliation with local bodies, be
ing an international body, but that the
rules and regulations of the, new Build
ings Trades Council will be observe*.! to
the letter by the local international body.
The delegates present represented 4000
labor union workingmen. Other unions
have promised to join the council.
The Building Trades Council was organ
ized- by the election of the following
officers: President, Henry Meyers ; vice
president, .' R. --Mel ver ; financial secre
tary, Alexander Murray; recording secre
tary, J. 7W. Rose; treasurer, John Mc-
Cartney. The other officers wiU be elected
late." In order to secure the affiliation of
the other unions in the building trades
the following were appointed as an organ
izing committee: McCartney, i Ãose, Mc-
Iver. . . ';â â '. â â  Â - -â :
Messrs. O'Brien, - McCartney, Smith and
McVica were appointed to draft a consti
tution and by-laws: These laws will be
compiled from the constitutions and by
laws of all the unions represented in the
council.
THE SALEM DEFAULTER.
City Marshal Hart Arrives and Identifies
Clarence Murphy, the Abscond
ing Teller.
City Marshal John W. Hart of Salem,
Mass., arrived by. last 1 night's . train from
the East and at once made his way to
police headquarters. He was escorted to
the City Prison by Detectives Silvey and
Crockett, and was delighted when his eyes
fell upon : Clarence Murphy, the 7 bank de
faulter, for whom < he had been looking for
over two years. ' Murphy's face broke into
a smile as the Marshal extended his hand
,to him. The two conversed earnestly for
a few minutes, and Hart handed -* Murphy
a letter from the latter's brother.* in which
he was advised to go back without ; any
fuss. / Murphy said he would tell his law
yer to drop the habeas corpus proceedings.

Oakland's safe-crackers are two boys.
Early this morning they were arrested as
they were returning from blowing open a
strong box on the water front.
Since being placed in cells they have
confessed, and their record makes one of
the most remarkable chapters ever fonnd
in the life history of boys of 1G years of
age.
â  The boys are Burt Willmore, 17 years of
age. and Abe Majors, If; years old. They
are . respectable looking boys, neatly
dressed, were well known in a large circle
of friends. Both lived with Mrs. Will
more, the mother of Burt. For six months
past various ugly stories have been told of
the affairs of the boys and the Will more
family, which consists of Burt, Mrs. Will
more and Ina, aged 13. These stories were
reported to the Chief of Police, but as they
were mostly , based on the testimony of
Abe Majors, and as he was not considered
veracious, the police did not verify them.

?'7....'AB__WWil^ PURE
Now it is believed that the stories of valu
able presents made to Ina by Majors were
true and 1 that the boys have been leading
a life of crime for a long time.
The lads were arrested about 5 o'clock
by Officers Kyte and Powers and Special
Officer Uoolan at Washington street, near
First. The officers thought i they were
newspaper carriers.
"Who are you fellows and where are
you going?" asked Powers.
"We are paper boys," i replied one of
them. ' * * 77
"Which way are you going?" was the
next question.
"We are looking for a paper route," was
the reply. . ..â¢-,-.â  /'// ]'
"You are looking for the man who has
â  the route, are you?"
"Yes," was the reply.
Then Kyte ordered the lads to hold tbeir
hands up, and as soon as he put his hand
in Majors? inside pocket he found sticks
of dynamite and a cartridge to which a
fuse was attached.
A further examination produced a 45
--caliber revolver, a jimmy, some small
fuse and a pocket full of coin. Willmore
was then searched, and on him was found
a revolver and some coin and some nitro
glycerine cartridges. The patrol - wagon
was called into service and the boys taken
to jail and put into separate cells.
For half an hour the prisoners refused
to say anything. They would not even
say yes or no to certain questions. After
Sergeant Hodgkins had tried in vain to
obtain' some information, Detective Wil
liams came into the room. Hodgkins then
said: "Now, I want you to settle a bet be
tween my friend Williams here and my
self. He claims that you did not go out of
the building when you blew up Girard's
safe, and I claim that you did." *
"We went outside," said Majors, taken
off his guard. Little by ; little they told
the officers of their long list of crimes.
They went from one store to another and
repeated their tale with as much indiffer
ence as if they were reading from a book.
They accounted for everything that has
been . done in Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley during the past months with but
three exceptions. _*??? .'
. For a time the officers were inclined to
doubt the story of the boys. They looked
so little like criminals and so much like
boys who think the dime-novel blackguard
a hero that it was thought the lads were
talking for the sake of making themselves
notorious. When asked where they had
hidden their plunder they told the officers
that in a tool chest in the rear of the Will
more house, at 1264 Webster street, was
the proceeds of the Girard robbery and of
the Sessions robbery in East Oakland.
Captain Fletcher and Sergeant Hodgkins
immediately proceeded out there and se
cured j the booty. The chest was packed
out to the street and a passing milk wagon
hailed, on which it was conveyed to the
City Hall.
When the chest was opened it was found
that it contained several sets of drills, a
number of articles of jewelry which had
been taken by the burglars from the differ
ent places that they visited, five big sticks
of dynamite, a bottle of chloroform which
they probably intended using in case they
found any person sleeping in the places
they visited, two boxes of pistol cartridges,
a charge of dynamite all fixed up with fuse
ready to use and two files. There were
five assorted drills and three ratchet
braces. Two of these braces were made
so that the shoulder could be used in hold
ing them up against anything, while the
third was the ordinary kind used about
machine-shops.
.When' the stolen articles of jewelry were
taken out of the chest by the officers the
young fellows told where they secured
each piece. Those which they said that
they secured from Girard's consisted of a
ladies' gold: watch, one gold bracelet, two
gold chains and two stick pins. There the
silverware taken consisted of five pearl
handled knives and a half dozen small
silver spoons. The ; young fellows main
tained that that was all that they got there
and they also said that they obtained only
$55 in cash instead of $400.
Two gold watches were also found in the
chest. One of these the young cracksmen
said they got at Mason's candy-store in
Berkeley and * the other at Hauch's
grocery-store in Alameda. ; At most of the
places they only secured a small amount
of cash.
Nothing at all was secured in any of the
safe jobs except that" at Girard's. '-' The
obtained at the latter place was
hidden behind a picture in the room occu
pied by the young fellows at the Willmore
residence. The "boys told the officers? of
this and it was found there.
During the day .W.G. Palmanteer, vice
president of the * Central Bank, called on
the lads with F. R. Girard, whose store
was * wrecked; Sunday 7 morning.' â¢ They
asked the ; lads about the missing bank
books and bank stock.- The boys assured
their callers that "i the papers had been
burned and Mr. Palmanteer said that he
thinks the boys told the truth.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1896.
Girard's Piano-Store, Which Young Willmore and Majors Wrecked With Dynamite.*
[Sketched by a "Call" staff artist.]
As Mr. Girard had stated that his safe
was robbed of over $400 in money and
$700 worth of. jewelry, there was quite a
little discussion between Majors and the
plane man.
"If you say I took more than the police
found in . my * room, you tell a lie," said
Majors. .-Mr' Girard said that the property
was his wife's and that he was not sure of
the . amount, but believed it to be more
than, the sum mentioned by the boys,
which was $55. ...
THE BOYS' STORY.
Calmly Chewing Gum, They Talk
Freely of Their Many Mis
deeds.
Majors gave.his name to the officers as
Ralph Ford, but this afternoon he was
identified as Abe Majors, a son of a man j
who was hanged in the County Jail about
ten years ago for murder.
Sheriff White called at the prison this
afternoon, and was the first to recognize
Ford.
* "Why, Majors, is this you?" said the
Sheriff. - *
"I guess it is," said "Ralph Ford."
"Well, I'm sorry for you," said the
Sheriff, who at once told Chief Lloyd of
his prisoner's identity.
Burt Willmore chewed cum as he sat on
a bench and talked to a Call man. The
lad was apparently unconcerned, and
smiled as he recounted his .many adven
tures. Not a suggestion of shame could
be seen, and neither did he seem proud of
his achievements. He simply talked
away as if it was the most natural thing in
the world that- a boy of 1G should arm
himself with a -huge revolver and dyna
mite and go forth and wreck safes.
."I first thought of leading the life of a
robber," said Willmore, "when I got out
of work some weeks ago. I did not think
it would be wrong, as I thought I must
make a living somehow, and Majors told
me it was a pretty good thing. I worked
for Mason & White, the candy men, since
1891. I worked there steadily until the
finding of the Blythe diamonds,' for which
Mr. Mason gave me his note for $100.' ' *
The diamonds, it will be remembered,
were deposited with Mr. Mason for safe
keeping several months - ago. One :, day
they were stolen from . the safe and Will
more found them in a dry-goods box out
side Kahn's store. . His story was doubted
at the time, but to-day he swore that it
was the truth? 7
"After Mr. Mason gave me the note,'
continued WHlroore, "I took $60 out in a
bicycle, and as I thought I needed a vaca
tion and as Mr. : Mason had me badly
scared I took a five weeks' trip into the
country. After I came back I again went
to work for Mr. Mason and had*', charge of
the Berkeley branch store. I injured ;my
hand about Thanksgiving and since then
I have not worked steadily. About Christ
mas Majors lost his job and he came over
to our house and stopped with us.
"It was he who made the first proposi
tion to go into this business. It looked
like a ; good thing the way he painted it,
so I consented. Our tools we got at differ
ent places. The dynamite we stole from a
quarry out New Broadway, and the other
tools we got at different places. He bought
them. One of. the drills he got in Ala
meda, I know, and paid $4 for it. The
other was purchased . in Oakland, I don't
know where, and cost $2 50. The fuse and
caps came from San Francisco.
."The first place we tackled was Mason's
branch store in Berkeley, the one in which
we had previously been employed?-Every
thing worked nicely and no one disturbed
us. ; We saw two men* outside for a minute,*
but we kept quiet and they did not see us.
We opened the safe and ; found 'â¢ $24 and a
gold watch, which we took. We went into
the barber-shop next/ door, but did not
find anything of value. -
"Then we went to Alameda. We went
over about 11 T o'clock at -night and went
through stores until nearly 5 o'clock in the
morning. During that , time we entered
nine stores, , ; but did not get much. We
took a gold watch, some shirts and a few,
little things. We ? walked ? from Alameda,
coming by way of Twenty-third avenue.
"Our next f , burglaries were those out on
San Pablo avenue. We worked nearly All
night but did not get much. / : i
if "We also robbed the millinery-store, the
coffee-store and "attempted to loot the shoe
store on Washington â¢ street. We used -a'
piece of crowbar to pry open the windows. â 
The papers Sprinted a list of nearly every
thing we â  took, all of which was of little
value.''
Abe Majors, when brought out, talked
very volubly about the Girard safe cracking?
."We began to work on the piano-store
about 11 o'clock last Monday night," said
Majors. 7 "We? walked around the Central
Bank building several times. 7 Only the
day before we decided there ought to be
money in the safe, and we decided to try
it. We walked around.looking for a lad
der, and found one padlocked in the rear
of a paintshop on . Fifteenth street. We
pried it off and stood it up against the wall.
"The first thing we did was to open the
door in the basement, and then we pried
open the door which led into the bicycle
basement. I went into the workshop, and
Ford ran upstairs and took the money
from the till. Afterward I went upstairs
and we monkeyed around for a little while.
Then we came down and opened the win
dow which led into the basement of the
music-store. The trapdoor was unlocked,
and we went upstairs. Ford bored the
holes in the safe ana put in the charge
while I peeked out the front.
"I don't know the force of .dynamite or
anything. Majors always did all of that;
he seemed to know, about it. It was about
half-past 3 when everything was ready.
We had not seen a soul, and worked all of
the time. Majors lit the fuse and we ran."
We climbed over the wall and were run
ning across the vacant lot when the explo
sion , occurred. We ran right on and
jumped over the fence of a house facing on
Franklin. We hid there until nearly 5
o'clock. Then I went out and took a walk
around the block, and looked in the front
of the store. ??w*
"Everything was all right, and I went
back after Ford. Then the two of us went
into the store again. Ford took a hammer I
and knocked the knob off ' the inside door
and put a little dynamite *' in. We only
went down in the cellar this time. After
the report we came upstairs and found $55
in a little drawer. There were two small
jewel-cases, which we took, and found in
one of them some silver knives and little
spoons, and in the other a watch, one
bracelet, a little chain with a blue locket,
two little stick pins and an earring. The
$400 must have been in Girard's mind.
When we read the papers we had to laugh
at the exaggeration." 7 7
"Last night's work was a neat job, and
netted us about $80.
'- "We went to the theater last night with
Mrs. Willmore and Ina," said Majors,
"and after we got home we pretended to
go to bed, and after we thought Mrs.
Willmore and Ina were asleep we started
out toward the water front. We came to
Butler's hay and i grain place down on
Webster street, and I forced the door with
my jimmy. I opened the two doors of the
safe and then broke open the little box /in
the inside. I didn't count what we got,
but think it was about $70 or $80.
; "After that we went over to the /coal
office on the wharf, and I forced a window
and we got inside. This . safe - was locked,
and in attempting to force off the knob of
the safe, I broke our wrench. We, then
forced a window *in the j back * office 1 and
were in there when we heard the officers
come in at the front. We got backing -the'
warehouse in the rear of the back /office?
and then forced a side .door and got â  out
onto Franklin-street wharf. 7., Â»
"We did not dare to come out upon the
street there and so ran to the .end of the
wharf., We saw a man there who appeared
to oe a watchman on a barge. We asked
him if there wa3 a spare skiff around,' tell
ing him we wanted to/go out to a' vessel iii
the stream. He showed us, a boat and we
got into it and rowed down below Broad
way. ; We crawled /upon the /wharf there '
and . hid until after 5 /o'clock. '"ll We then
started up Broadway, turning down First
to Washington. ;? / > ; â 
When we got to, Fifth street we saw the
officers standing on the/opposite; corner.
We turned diagonally across the street, and
as we did so heard the officers talking to
gether. They seemed . . to be ,' discussing
.whether they should stop us. Finally one â¢
called to us and we stopped. One of the
men asked us if we were paper boys, and
we told him, that we had been down to the
wharf trying to get a paper route. .
'â  ' "As tbey came over to us, I one of the
policemen had his pistol in his hands, and ;
when another commenced to search us, the /
second one drew /his' pistol. As soon as
they found our pistols they put the hand- j
cuffs on us. \' *- : Â»'â â </ â ": >-./;.' : '-" 'â  -./
"We intended to leave to-day for the â¢ in
terior of the county. This was to have
been our last job. ?7 7. 7 ? ?â â¢ . -
: ; "The first time I ever thought ;of safe
cracking was when I saw a story in a San
Francisco paper ? several \ weeks ago about
how to work safes. It had ;.- pictures of all
the tools necessary, and told how the most
expert robbers had * cracked ' safes, and ' _
read it carefully and thought it was not
such a risky job after all. After a talk
with Willmore we decided to try it, and
commenced at Berkeley about three weeks
ago." â '.;*â  â  ..
MRS. WILLMORE.
Was She Aware of What the Boys
Who Lived With Har Were
Doing?;-' '_.*,-
Mrs. Willmore is a devout church
woman and wa3 very much shocked to-day
when the officers visited her house. She
said she did not think the boys would like
any one â¢ taking away the tool chest. ? The
police can hardly believe that-all the raids
of the boys could have been undertaken
without her knowledge. ???*'?''
"The boys used to go to bed at the usual
time every night," said Mrs. Willmore to-*
night," and I never heard' them go out.
One morning, . about a week ago, I was
rather surprised to see them undressing in
their room early in the morning. I looked
in their window^ from the backyard and
saw that they had arranged the pillows
and bed-clothes so that if any one looked
in it would appear as though the lads were
in bed. ' â¢ â¢â ? './"/J ; '-
"When the officers came this. morning
the bed was arranged that way. 1 asked
the boys about it, but they did not give me
any explanation and I ; thought !no more
about it. After we read the piece in the
papers about the Girard robbery the boys
took us to see the place. I never saw any
guns or . burglar tools ;in the house and
never saw the boys with any money. The
whole thing is a mystery to me and I can
not believe the boys did such work."
Detective Holland can hardly believe
that the boys - did so much work without
exciting suspicion, and although he ! does
not think Mrs. Willmore really knew what
the lads were doing, he thinks she ; must
have seen enough to justify her in making
an inquiry. /
Abe Majors is the son of Mrs. Wagner,
who, after the death of Majors, married J.
Wagner. Three weeks ago Wagner was in
the Oakland Police Court for neglecting to
pay alimony. He has since disappeared.
To-morrow morning the furniture owned
by young Majors' mother will be put on
the : sidewalk ; by, the Sheriff for non-pay
ment of rent. When told of her son's dis
grace to-night " she went into hysterics,
and, as she has been a victim of nervous
prostration for several months, this last
shock will, it is feared, destroy her reason.
THE MOTHER ACCUSED.

Chief of Police Lloyd said late tornight:
"After a careful investigation of : all the.
facts in the case lam convinced that Mrs.
Willmore knew of all â  that was going on.
The family has /been * living .\ for three
months on little or no regular income, yet

THE HACKMEIER HOTEL.
George, Gruenig , Becomes * Proprietor
After Arranging for the '<Paymont
of Its Debts. 1 7; 777.
* The old \ and well-known Hackmeier
Hotel, on i' Eddy street, ? which 7 was -;con
ducted by Adam Hackmeier <: for some
fifteen years, has passed to other hands.
George Gruenig, a hotel man of consider
able experience hitherto, formally took
charge of it yesterday. Tho previous day
he saw that some $3000 or $4000 of debts
were adjudicated satisfactorily to :a v com
mittee of the creditors of J. the Hackmeiers.
> The old hotel has fallen into rough lines
in recent years. ft) So 5 long as ; _ Adam Hack
meier ran it it flourished and made money
steadily. He had formerly been in the
same business 'Â»â¢ on I Bush % street and after
ward was proprietor of the â¢ Eastern Hotel
on Pine street, opposite Goldberg, Bo wen
& , Lebenbaum's. 7 Many of the patrols
which Hackmeier had at" these places he
took with him to Eddy street.
r He added many more also and did a
large, safe and solid .business. But when
tne old man died some two years ago, and
his .'ons came into < the management,'dif
ferent modes of transacting business were
adopted and changes ';â 'â  un avoidably ; fol
lowed. The * hotel ;is large 7 enough to
accommodate over 2CO ; people. The
Rosenbaum brothers, the ... commission
merchants, are the owners of the building.
George Gruenig, the oew lessee, will, it
ii stated, make anumber of improvements,
but none in the way of building.

ODDS ARE MANUFACTURED
Poolroom Men Foil the Ingle
side People but Violate
the Law.
Prices Are Doctored Up in One "Joint* '
and Sent Broadcast as From
; the Track.
The keepers of the downtown poolroom
dens, despairing of getting the odds and
results with any degree of accuracy from
Ingleside track, hit upon a novel idea
yesterday, and the gullible public was
fleeced as usual. The . latest scheme of
these sharpers is an institution for the
manufacture of odds. The plant is located
in the poolroom of Henry Schwartz & Co.,
and as fast as turned out the quotations
were sent to the other rooms by means of
"pony wires."
To illustrate how the law is being openly
violated and the public buncoed a few
examples of yesterday's sharp practices
are all that is necessary. In the opening
race the "commission : joints" had Burns
up on Roselle, while in the actual race he
was piloted by Lamle. Zamar was carded
to be ridden by Shaw, while Garner
brought him in winner.' Coady was
chalked up on their boards to ride Viking,
while Chorn had the mount, and so on
with. the other starters. Of the eleven
jockeys posted up in the dens there were
seven errors. â . i
As another instance of how the credu
lous s are imposed upon, Ida Saver was
quoted in the rooms at 15 to 1 in the sec
ond race, while as a matter of fact the
mare . never starryd. the entry being
scratched. A repetition of this occurred
in the fifth event, when Ful'erton Lass,
who was also scratched; had 12 to 1 chalked
against her name. The latter entry was
scratched at the track four minutes after
3 o'clock, and the poolroom-keepers nosted
the odds opposite her name at 4:37 o'clock.
Â© Again, as a sample of a- flagrant viola
tion of the betting law the following will
instance: At 3:25 p. m. the rooms marked
up the "track odds against the starters in
the second race, With the result of the first
race not yet received. The first race at
Ingleside track was run at 2:37 p. m., just
two > minutes later than their "track bet
ting"was marked up on the second event.
At 3:05 P. ;m. the poolrooms posted ihe
prices â¢ against the starters in the third
race, while at Ingleside the judges did not
sound the bell allowing the bookmakers
to commence betting until 3:22 p. _Â a dis
crepancy of seventeen minutes.
The second event was not decided until
3:14 p. m., still these men who claim to be
simply conducting a commission business
laid odds and took coin on horses starting
in the third race nine minutes previous to
the time. The disparity in the odds laid
against the .different- starters disproves
the fact that they are getting any infor
mation from . the track. They are con
ducting |a : brace game, pure and simple,
and the tottering throne upon which they
stand is about ready to fall, for justice
cannot be hoodwinked much longer.

taken to the California-street station. Late
in the afternoon he ; was removed , with

Attorneys ?' Ed Corny and Thomas
Slattery were in the prison that night look
ing for clients, and they called out Oliver.
He told them he was a son of B. P. Oliver,
real estate dealer, who would piy them a
fee of $25 for their services. Goruynsand
Slattery w ent on his bond for *j;so<j and he
was released. He took them to the resi
dence of Mrs. Tibbits, 1045 Mission street,
where he said he lived with his father and
would get the $25 for them.
--; Oliver saw Mrs.; Tibbits.and said he
wanted to engage a room. .He had two
friends with him, -and she might allow
them to wait in the parlor. The landlady
invited the two attorneys into the parlor,
and Oliver asked them to excuse .him for
a few minutes. The attorneys waited pa
tiently for a considerable time, till finally
the landlady, who saw them still seated in
the parlor, told them that their friend
had gone Jong before, without engaging a
room!
The case was called .: in , Judge Conlan's
court yesterday morning. Oliver was not
present and the two attorneys asked for a
continuance, which was granted. All yes
terday they were making anxious inquiries
about Oliver, and the chances are he has
left the City and the bond will be declared
forfeited. ".â .''â .'..""'.':"

FUNERAL OF MR. LANSING
Short but Impressive Ceremony
Held at His Late Resi
dence.
HIS LIFE WORK IS REVIEWED.
Southern Pacific Officials Send Rich
and ; Handsome Floral
7? Offerings. â¢
The funeral of ('erritt L. Lansing, form
erly secretary and controller of the South
ern Pacific, was held from his residence,
1935 Pacific avenue, yesterday.
The attendance was very large, many of
those who had desired to pay their last
respects to the dead man being unable to
gain admission to the bouse. In a hand
some casket, covered with rich black cloth,
rested the remains. - ' The floral offerings
were many and of exquisite design. Con
spicuous was an elaborate mound of violets
and lilies of the valley, an offering of the
Lansing Literary Society, of which both
Mr. Lansing and his mother were mem
bers. The individual officers of the South
ern Pacific sent floral offerings of great
richness and beauty.
The funeral ceremonies were of the
simplest nature and did not consume over
fifteen minutes. It was conducted by Dr.
Horatio Stebbins, pastor of the First Uni
tarian Church. A â  brief, fervent prayer
was offered, followed by a short address
in which the life and character of the de
ceased were reviewed. Dr.* Stebbins re
ferred in a touching way .to the home of
Mr. Lansing, particularly of his tenderness
as a son and devotion as a husband and of
his career as a railroad man, and to the un- *
ceasing devotion to the affairs over which
he presided a brief reference was made.
With this simple address the benediction
was pronounced, after which the body was
taken from the house for burial in the
Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland.
The funeral party was conveyed by spe
cial boat across the bay. The pall-bearers
were Colonel C. F. Crocker, A. T. Smith,
W. G. Curtis, J. A. Fillmore, W. M.
Thompson, E. C. Wright, C. J. Wilder, E.
E. Holton, William Sproule and George
T. Klink.
The successor of Mr. Lansing is as yet a
matter of surmise, though the impression
prevails that the office will be divided and
that E. Wright will.be tendered the
office of controller. The officers of the
company say that the matter has not been
even casually discussed.
DE WINTER IS GUILTY
__ __ Â - â¢ . . - _ .*â **.*
The Verdict of the Jury Accom
panied by a Recommenda
tion for Mercy.
Convicted of Cruel and Brutal Treat
ment to a Sailor on the High .
Seas.
â¢ Captain John de Winter, the master sea
man, whose trial for cruel and brutal treat
ment of a subordinate while on the "'high
seas, has been in progress in the Urrited
States District Court for several days,' was
yesterday foundÂ«guilty by the jury in the
case.
The defendant will be sentenced on
Tuesday. He is subject to a fine of $1000,
or imprisonment for live years. â¢He was
recommended to the mercy of the court,
howeyer, and .there is a probability that
Judge Morrow may comply with the
wishes of the jury and give the offender a
light sentence. 7
Seamen generally have taken a great in
terest in the, examination of Captain de
Winter, and his commitment to prison for
a long period would greatly delight them.
He has been the first master of a ship to
be indicted at this port for ill treating
sailors under his charge for some time,
and the nature of the offense charged has
aroused public comment. The United
States Grand Jury returned â¢ two indict
ments against the accused captain.
Gus Waywod was. the complaining wit
ness. He charged Captain de Winter with
assaulting him with his fist and also with
8 revolver on the high seas on October 18
last. His statement was corroborated by
other seamen who were on board the ves
sel at the time.
A 300-year-old lawsuit came up the other
day in the Bavarian courts, apparently as
far from settlement as at the beginning.
The village of Burgeim, in* lower Franco
nia, which is now a part of . Bavaria,
brought the suit in 1595 against the lords
of Thuringan for 2,000,000 marks, the
value of a forest of oaks and beech trees
belonging to the community which the
lords had appropriated. Â
