2 he Protest Was J^ot as Popular as Given
Out.
HAVANA, Ciba, March 11, via Tampa,
Fla., March 12.â The protest against the
action of Congress being circulated In
Havana for the signatures of commercial
houses, presidents of clubs, corporations
and merchants generally has nearly
stirred up a riot here.
Many houses refused to sign and have
been threatened: others signed under
duress. The members of the Union Club
threaten to depose ihe president for sign
ing the name of the club. The editor of
La Discussion declined to sign the name
of his paper on the ground that he had no
authority during the absence of the di
rector, who is in Madrid. Given the choice
of signing or ceasing publishing, he signed.
General Weyler's last proclamation pro
viding for confiscation of the property of
those in active or passive aid of the rebel
lion is bitterly denounced by Cubans. It
is said to furnish the petty officials a
basis for extensive blackmail operations,
and also to wreak vengeance upon Cubans
generally. Under its terms the property
of any person failing to present himself in
fifteen days must be seized. Many are
compelled to flee to interior towns or to
the cities of the coast, and others who
have gone abroad, awaiting quieter times,
and left theii homes deserted or in charge
of servants, may lose all.
The elections ordered to take place April
19 attract little attention. The three par
ties will go through the form of holding
an election," all voting for the same candi
dates, who have not been named by the
parties themselves but by the Spanish
authorities. The mockery of the elections
will be apparent when among the candi
dates are found the names of Suarez
Valdez, now in command of troops in
Pinardel Rio; General Polavieja. who is
in Spain ; General Pendo. who is in com
mand of the second division of the army
here, and 'Romerd Robledo, who is in
Spain*, and whom all Cubans hate.
Just bow the voting is to be managed
while the island is a vast army camp and
a large portion of it in th hands of the
enemy has not been divulged. The wise
men at the palace have been at work for
days upon a proclamation covering the
elections which is awaited with much in
terest. .
A number of residents of Seiba del Aqua,
Havana province, have arrived here and
tell the following story:
A large party of insurgents appeared
near the town , Saturday. The Spanish
garrison immediately took from their
homes all the Cubans in town at the point
of the bayonet and compelled them to
stand in front of the garrison. They were
in mortal terror, as the insurgents ad
vanced to attack the town. The : invaders
seeing unarmed men standing in front of
the Spanish troops withheld their lire and
finally withdrew without j making any at
tack. After this occurrence the beat part
of the residents of Seiba del Aqua tied to
this city. â¢'â¢ Frank Clark.

council was held to-day, at which the
Queen Regent presided. Senor Canovas
del Castillo, Prime Minister, made opti
mistic comments on the action of the
American Senate on the Cuban bel
ligerency resolutions. He evidently be
lieved that the fact that the Senate had
not already agreed to the report of its
committee of conference and the com
mittee of the House of Representatives
means there is a good prospect of the
Senate not accepting the House resolu
tion. He added, however, that the warlike
preparations would be continued, the
Government being determined to be ready
for any contingency.
The Prime Minister announced that it
was intended to immediately reopen the
universities that had been closed on ac
count of the anti-American demonstration
of the students.
A special dispatch to the Imparcial from
Havana says that Maceo has re-entered
the province of Havana and is now near
San Nicolas. Gomez remains in the
province of Matanzas.
ARMS J-OR THE CUBAXS.
One Expedition That Left Philadelphia
Wan Successful.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., March 12.â The
vessel- which is said to have ieft ,this port
for Cuba a week ago with arms and am
munition is reported to have landed safely
at a small bay in the eastern end of the
island, and within six hours the entire
careo was placed in the hands of the in
surgent agents. One of the Cuban lead
ers who was instrumental in getting this
vessel away, is speaking of it, said:
â¢â¢So far as we- have been able to learn,
the ship with the munitions of war arrived
in Cuba on Sunday, and pot away all risjht.
If she had not done so, we certainly would
have bad an elaborate report of her seizure
or any other circumstances that would
affect the enterprise.
"There were not many men aboard, only
enough to handle the cargo and look after
it properly. The ship cleared from here
for Jamaica, and, after stopping at Cuba,
"ailed immediately for Jamaica, from
which place she will come to Philadelphia
with a cargo, and be ready again for an
other trip down with arms.' 1
"What about last night's expedition?"
"The only thing that I can say is that
the ship used is now on its way south,
but as to who is in command of her or her
name, I cannot say. Besides carrying
thirty-three men, she carried a number of
machine guns, cannon, about a million
rounds of ammunition and a large quan-
tity of improved rifles and machete?. We
have plenty of men down there at present.
What we really do need is arms and money
and these are coming along at a fairly
good rate.
"Should this ship escape the United
StatÂ»s revenue cutter? acting in concert
with the Spanish cruisers and pet her load
of war material safely landed it will put
the armies of Gomez on a remarkably pood
lighting basis so far as equipment goes.
As to discipline and field and skirmish
drill the Cuban troops have no equal."

RIOTS AT SAINT KITTS.
An Account of Disturbances on
the Island From a Consular
Agent.
Cane Plantations Burned and Several
Strikers Killed in One
Skirmish.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 12â The
State Uepartment has received from Leo
pold Moore, United States Consular Agent
at Saint Kitts, one of the British West In
aia Islands, a complete account of the re
cent disturbance. He says that six weeks
ago the laborers of the sugar estates struck
for higher wages, their pay having been
reduced, and set fire to the canes on the
estates whose proprietors refused to accede
to their demands.
Fortunately H. M. S. Cordelia had just
arrived and a force was landed. After a
skirmish, in which three of the negro riot
ers were killed and severa-l wounded, par
tial order was restored. The value of the
goods taken or destroyed by the mob is es
timated at $5000. Several attempts were
made to lire the town, but the marines ex
tinguished the flames. The warship will
remain for the present, as the blacks are
making threats to burn the town and mur
der tiie white people at the first opportu
nity. The island is now under martial law.

THEFTS CARRIED
ON MANY YEARS
Startling Confession Made
by the Junior Partner
of a Firm.
A HUNDRED THOUSAND.
That Sum Taken by a Clever
and Prolonged System of
Peculations.
KNOWN AS A "HIGH ROLLEH."
News of the Embezzlement Causes
Excitement in Cleveland's
Swagger Circle.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 12.â Chattel
mortgages were filed this afternoon against
Childs, Graft & Co., wholesale shoe manu
facturers, and ihe junior partner in the
firm, W. H. Huntington, has confessed to
peculations aggregating $40,000. A hasty
examination of the books, however,
showed a shortage existing of $100,000.
A business statement of the creditors of
the house was made Tuesday, and it wa3
then noticed that there was a discrepancy.
Huntington then astounded his asso
ciates by confessing that for over twenty
years he had been stealing from the firm,
and that the amount would exceed $40,000.
He stated to them that he had done this
through the bills payable and by carrying
a cash balance short.
What has been done with the money is
not known. Huntington says he has
lived it up, but so far as the members of
the firm had knowledge he did not live in
an extravagant manner, nor did he have
other habits by which he could make way
with so large a sum of meney so far as is
known.
He has for years enjoyed the entire con
fidence of the members of the firm and has
Berved as administrator of the estate of
the father of the present senior member
and was named in the will of Mr. Graff as
one of the executors of his estate.
Huntington is a young man and unmar
ried. He has been known as a "high
roller" and was a member of the Cleveland
Athletic Club, the Cleveland Yacht Club,
as well as the most prominent social clubs
of the city. He is the son of John Hunt
ington, one of the prejectors of the Stand
ard Oil Company and an early associate of
John D. Rockefeller. The news of his
embezzlement and confession comes as a
great shock to Cleveland's elite society, of
which the Huntingtons are prominent
members.
ROBBING THE TAXPAYERS
An Organized Band of Daring
Swindlers Discovered at
Chicago.
Warrants for Rebates Obtained Upon
Forged Receipts for Special
Assessments.
CHICAGO, 111., March 12.â For several
days the police and officials of the Con
troller's office, special assessment bureau
and law department have been investigat
ing certain startling facts which came
into their possession by confession,
and otherwise indicating the exist
ence of an organized band of City
Hall employes and men on the
outside, who, it is alleged, have
robbed the taxpayers of probably $10,000 by
means of forging receipts for special as
sessments paid with which the accomplices
not employed in the special assessment
bureau or Controller's office obtained
warrants for rebates due proper y-owners.
These warrants were cashed without ques
tion by the City Treasurer.
The first arrest in the case came to-night
when William G. Leonard, a prominent
city contractor and politician, was taken
into custody on a warrant from the city
prosecutor, alleging the forgery of special
assessment receipts. He was released on
bail, llisdesk at his office was searched
on a warrant yesterday, and it is alleged
some of the forged paper was found there.
William Madden, ex-chief clerk in the
special assessment bureau, is accused of
being the principal leader of the City Hall
men, and his return from New Orleans was
anxiously awaited this morning by the po
lice. It is alleged,* however, that Leonard
sent him a telegram i yesterday which
served as a tip, and it is known- that he
left the train in Mississippi for parts un
known. Other arrests are expected when
the Grand Jury gets to .work. râ .. v 7 . â

UNION TAILORS TO STRIKE
Ready to Assist in the Fight of
the Clothing Cutters and
Trimmers.
In Less Than a Week Nearly 30,000
Persons Will Be Out of
Employment.
CHICAGO, 111., March 12. â All the
union tailors employed in the city â will go
on strike to-morrnw to assist the clothing
cutters and trimmers who have boon strug
gling for several weeks to win against their
former employers. The decision of the
tailors -was reached by the joint executive
boards of the unions last night. The
tailors have been willing to join the 800
striking cutters and trimmers since the
first day of the strike, but have been kept
from doinjr so. It is estimated that there
are 7500 organized tailors here, hut when
this number quits work it is believed as
many more will join the ranks of the idle
the first day.
In less than a week it is estimated 25,000
to 30,000 men, women, boys and girls,
whose garment work depends on the
tailors, cutters and trimmers, will be af
fected by the strike. All t ho unions held
meetings to-nipht and ratified the strike
action of the executive board.
The Cutters' and Trimmers' Union re
ceived a setback to-day when fourteen
members who had been old employers of
Kahn Brothers returned to work. The
action of the men was expected by the
strikers.

WILLING TO PAY
ALL THE DEBTS
Collis P. Huntington Before
the Pacific Railroad
Committee.
EXPLAINS WITH EASE.
Very Few People Indeed Desire
a Foreclosure of Bond-
Aided Lines.
ASKED SOME DIRECT QUESTIONS
Of Course, He Replies It Is Only
Men With Grievances Who Op
pose a Refunding.
WASHINGTON, I). C, March 12.â The
House Committee on Pacific Railroads to
day heard President C. P. Huntington of
the Southern Pai-itie Railroad.
In opening, Iluntington said he was not
accustomed to miblic speaking, and would
ask the attention of the committee for but a
short time. The story of the Pacific rail
roads was an old one, hut he had jotted
down a few matters which he wished to
lay before the committee. The Central
Pacirin, he said, had complied with every
provision of the statute. It had performed
not only its contract with the Government,
but with individuals. The property had
been kept clean, and the Government debt
had not been embarrassed. The officers of
the company desire and intend to pay all
the principal and as much interest as
possible.
He did not favor Government ownership.
A great, many people in California wanted
this. A6 a railroad man he did not object
to it, but he did not think the Government
could do worse.
The provisions of the so-called Smith
or Frye bills pending in this Congress in
the main meet the approval of the officers
of the company. The officers of the com
pany think, in following this line, that
they could pay upon the principal of this
indebtedness for the first ten years the
sum of $.{OO,OOO per annum, for the second
ten years $400,000 per annum and the bal
ance of the debt at $750,000 per annum,
and with interest to be paid semi-annually
at the rate of 2 per cent.
To secure this indebtedness the com
pany proposed to pive its mortgage upon
all that property that it has, of every kind
and description, and is perfectly willing
that the most stringent provisions to se
cure permanent performance of the obliga
tion shall be inserted in any bill.
The question of the time of extension
was not specially material, so that the
debt was made safer, better secured and
in process of gradual extinguishment by
frequent payments on the principal and
interest on the deferred payments.
Boatner called the witness' attention to
the great opposition in California to the
settlement of Pacific railroad matters ex
cent by foreclosure and asked how he ac
counted for this.
Mr. Huntington replied that a large ma
jority of the people of California favored
the roads and wanted to see a just settle
ment made. There were a few, however,
who were against the roads. They were
bright, smart men. They had grievances.
What these grievances were he could tell,
but it would take a long time and they
were matters which the committee would
not care to go into.
Mr. Boat ncr then asked him to explain
how it was that the California delegation
in Congress, one man excepted, were
against the roads.
In. replying to this question Huntington
referred to the elections of several years
ago. He said that one man complained
bitterly to him when Congressman English
defeated him, stating that if the Pacific
roads had helped him a little be could
have defeated English. Huntington told
him that the roads were not in politics.
"Hew is it," Boatner asked, "that the
press of the State are against the roads!"
Huntinsclon replied that seven-eighths
of the press were in favor of the roads.
Boatner questioned Huntinzton very
closely about the motives df the Califor
nia press and people in opposing his
schemes.
Arnold of Pennsylvania objected, declar
ing that this was not material and that
local differences in California had
nothing to do with the adjust
ment, of the I'acific railroads' debts to
the Government. The matter was allowed
to drop for the time, but ju<Â»t before the
committee arose Boatner and Faris re
turned to their line of inquiry and insisted
upon Huntinqton giving an answer to
Boatner's question as to which of the Cali
fornia papers were opposing him.
Huntington complimented the Chronicle
and Pos* and said they were disposed to
be "fair." but the Examiner was against
him because it had been dropped from the
payroll. Huntington went on to explain
that when he became president of the
Southern Pacific the Examiner was on the
payroll of the company for $1000 a month,
and when he ordered this monthly pay
ment stopped the paper immediately be
uui to attack him.
Johnson asked him why he used the
word "w-ievances" in referring to objec
tions to the roads and wanted to know
what he meant by it and if it was not mis
leading.
Several members of the committee ob
jected to going into the matter and Hunt
ington replied that those who "had griev
ances" were those who had no business.
These, he said, were the class of people
who complained.
In reply to a question by Powers of Ver
mont the witness said lie was willing to
have the Southern Pacific, "a solid affair,''
guarantee the proposed extension bond?.
In reply to a further question he said the
roads could not carry out the proposition
advanced by the Keilly bill of last Con-
gress.
The committee adjourned until Monday
next.

FIGHT FOR BLOOD AT CHICO
Editor of the Chronicle-Record
Enters the Ring With
W. A. Morse.
A Fierce and Gory Battle With, the
Journalist Apparently Over
matched.
CHICO, Cat,., March 12.â As the result
of a challenge issued by Editor Woods of
the Chronicle-Record to W. A. Morse a
fight took place this afternoon. The affair
was kept as quiet as possible on account of
a fear that the police would interfere. The
seconds were promptly on hand and time
was called at 2 :.">'>.
First round â Morse, who appeared eacer
for action, started off with a quick left,
landing on his opponent's eye. The effect
soon showed. Woods was surprised at the
kid's science and went for a mix-up â
rough-and-tumole being the order â Woods
swinging wildly, missing more times than
hitting him. H â¢ then clinched and time
was called. Honors in favor of Morse.
Second round â Woods, rightinir savagely,
landed a terrific ricr'i t on Morse's eye, cut
tine to the bone. Morse pent his left with
nooil eflect on Woods' stomach. After a
lively struggle on tlie floor time was
called.
Third roundâ Morse Moored Woods with
a rifhton his jaw. Woods seemed dazed.
Woods clinched and forced Morse's bead
into a water trough, and but for Morse's
second the right would probably have
ended here. This round ended in \Yocds'
favor.
Fourth and last roundâ Woods deter
mined to end matters and went at his
youthful opponent, but found him game.
Morse landed a terrific right and left on
Woods' face, leaving it a sorry spectacle.
The kid forced matters, and Woods would
have surely been beaten, but the cry of
police came and tre spectators soon dis
persed, leaving Wooas, a pitiful sight, to
tinrt his way to some drugstore, where he
was attended by a well-known doctor.
It will be a week or more before Woods
will feel as well as usual. Woods is a
graduate of the State University and went
to West Point from one of the Congres
sional districts.

tween Adowa and AdiÂ°rat. Communica
tion with Kassala is still unbroken. Much.
anxiety is felt as t.i the fate of Adigrat,
which is very inadequately provisioned for
a siege. The Abyssinians have been greatly
emboldened by their recent successes and
will undoubtedly attack the Italians
whether they remain at Adigrat or at
tempt to reireaf. In either case, with the
ovrlwhelmini; numbers of the Abyssin
ians, it can hardly be doubted what the re
sult would be.
Italia pays that thÂ«* policy of the Govern
ment will hereafter lie strictly on the de
fensive in Africa, but it is difficult to see
how this could avert the threatened dis
aster at A dii; rat.
The people of Italy are not pleased with
the prospect of an Abyssinian campaign.
A'l over the country men who would be
liable to be called out for military service
are Hurrying away. Kvcry railroad train
into France is crowded with lugitives.
This stream has kept up for several days,
And there is no aigir of v decrÂ«Mf in tht
numbers.
According to the Agenzia dltalia 3000
Dervishes are investing Knssala, the town
which was captured from them some time
ago by the Italians. General Baratieri,
who was lately superseded in the com
mand of the Italian forces in Africa, in an
interview at Massowah on his reasons for
attacking the Abyssinians at Adowa, said
that information he tiad received led him
to believe that it would be easy to occupy
Mm positions Im assailed. He reckoned
that tne force of Abyssinians would retreat.
Instead of doing so they had inflicted a
defeat on the Italian army and he was
ready to submit to the consequences.
The Tribuna publishes an interview with
General Baratiera, in which he denies that
the Government urged him to attack tho
Ahyssinians. but he adds that all his gen
erals favored making the attack. A vic
tory for the Italians had been partially
won and was virtually assured, when the
native battalions became panic-stricken
and this produced disorder among the
Italian tr.xips.
General Baratiera declares that he has
nothing to reproach himself for, but con
fesses that in a moment of madness after
his defeat he was on the verge of commit
ting suicide. He remembered, however,
the piety of his family and wished to spare
them shame and pain.

SENATOR HILL
AS AN OBJECTOR
Opposed to Clauses in the
Resolutions Favoring
Cubans.
THREATS UNNECESSARY.
Exceptions Taken to the Lan
guage Contained in the Con
ference Report.
SHERMAN SPEAKS POINTEDLY.
Says There Never Was a Stronger
Case of War Than Now Exists
in Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 12.â The
conference report on the Cuban belliger
ency resolution was again up in the Senate
to-day, and two speeches were made upon
it. The first was by Hill (D.) of New
York announcing his purpose of voting
against the conference report, and stating
the reason which induced him to take that
position after having voted for the resolu
tion that passed the Senate. His opposi
tion was to the third clause of the con
ference report, which proclaims the pur
pose of the V cited States to he i>repared to
intervene in order to protect the legitimate
interests of the United States. He opposed
that resolution as being liable to misin
terpretation, and as being unnecessary,
and therefore uuwis-e. He thought it was
too much like a threat; too much like bun
combe, and that it was putting interven
tion on too low a ground. He could not
vote for it, and as a conference report is
not amendable he would have to vote
against the report.
The action of the Committee on Foreign
Relations and of the Senate conferrees was
defended by Sherman, aud then the mat
ter went over till to-morrow, Morgan of
Alabama bavins the floor. It was subse
quently stated that Sherman would ask
unanimous consent to-morrow to take up
the conference report, displacing tempor
arily the Delaware election case, and that
if objection were made he would move to
take it up, so that the matter would be de
cided by a majority vote.
After some routine business had been
disposed of, Sherman (It.) of Ohio gave
notice that he would from this time for
ward press for as early a vote as possible
on the conference report on the Cuban
resolutions.
The conference report on the Cuban
belligerency resolutions was taken up at 1
r. m. and Hill (D.) of New YorK addressed
the Senate. He said he should non-concur
in the conference report, because he
wanted to place the resolution in s-uch
parliamentary shape that the third resolu
tion, reading, "The United biate3 has
not intervened in any of the struggles
between any European Government
and their colonies on this continent,"
could be amended and made more clear.
All depended upon what interpretation
was put on the word "intervened. 11 We
had recognized insurgents in the past, and
that, iiilt contended, was intervention of
a certain kind. The resolution was un
necessary. If we mean that we have in
tervened with force of arms to assist any
one, that should be stated, but that, Hill
said, was also unnecessary.
The threat that we would intervene to
protect the rights of American citizens
was unnecessary, and unnecessaries were
always unwise. The language used by the
House was capable of double meaning and
might create trouble. It was unwise. It
was sufficient to let the future take care of
itself. This proposition looking to "inter
vention" and the statement that we shoula
be "prepared to protect American citi
zens" looked too much like buncombe.
If it was meant to be serious, the propo
sition should be seriously made; if it was
meant that we should increase our army
or our navy, that should be done by bills
requiring the signature of the President,
not by resolutions that meant nothing. I
was ndOseose to say that we were prepared
to protect the legitimate interests of our
citizens; no one presumes that we would
peek to protect their illegitimate interests.
Our interposition in this matter should,
Hill asserted, be placed on a higher ground
than that some of our people are losing a
few dollars by this, struggle. Interfere in
the cause of liberty and seek to save hu
man life and pravent suffering, but do not,
Hill exclaimed, draw the United States
into this matter because of some little
property that may be imperiled.
Hill said tliat he had received a number
of telegrams, one of them from a man nigh
in the commercial world, which he read.
It stated that the attitude of the United
States toward Cuba was seriously affecting
the commerce of New York. Merchants
of Cuba were, it recited, resolving to boy
cott American merchants and had cabled
the cancellation of all their orders with
New York houses '"and," exclaimed Hill
with intense feeling, "1 am asked to record
my vote on a great question of interna
tional right or wrong on the ground that
some of the Spanish merchants in Cuba
were boycotting the trade of some of my
constituents. With all due respect to
these gentlemen, I must say that we should
rest our action on more tenabie grounds
than this. If Congress is to do anything
it should be done without buncombe and
without threat."
He favored the other two resolutions
because they were substantially the same
as the Senate resolutions. He would not
retrace his action on those resolutions. He
favored those resolutions because they
expressed the opinion of Congress. He
was not deterred by recent events or any
MTitiinent that may have been brought
about.
He was not, he paid, to be frightened off
by the acts of a few Spanish students who
had stoned our Consulate and despoiled the
American flag. It was self-evident that a
.â¢-fate of war existed in Cuba. The news
papers were full of it, and Hill declared
there were some reliable newspaper cor
respondents, and their reports gave an
accurate account of the condition of affairs
in the island. Hill was willing to stand by
what these correspondents said. It had
been said by gome that the administration
was being embarrassed by these resolu
tions.
"if ihf- administration thought those
resolutions! were embarrassing to it," said
Bill, "someone here would have knowl
edge of that fact. 1 cannot believe the
administration would keep its own counsel
so close that no one . would know what it
desired."
In responseJlto a [query from Hoar (R.)
of Massachusetts, Hill* said be did not
believe a single Jaw would be changed by
the passage of a concurrent resolution
which didnot receive the signature of the
President. For that reason he believed
the resolutions in a concurrent form were
proper, and it was in that light that he
proposed to discuss them. Hill said he
was for the concurrent resolutions because
they only expressed the opinion of Con
gress and|.vere respectful not only to our"
own President, but to the Government of
Spain. He believed the President would
carefully consider the resolutions. They
would have a moral effect throughout this
country and throughout the world. "When
Jackson was President Congress passed a
concurrent resolution expressing its opin
ion not upon the question of belligerency,
but upon the greater question of the inde
pendence of a country. Such resolutions
were the only safe ones; thus far should
Congress go and no farther.
In conclusion Hill quoted the words of
Daniel Webster in 1823, when he made his
great speech in favor of the recognition of
Greek independence.
At 2 o'clock the unfinished business was
laid before the Senate and Pritchard (R.)
of North Carolina took the floor in Bup
port of the right of Henry Dupont as a
cenator fromJ)elaware. He yielded, how
ever, to Sherman (R.) of Ohio,;who desired
to speak on the Cuban resolutions.
Sherman said the extraordinary resolu
tion (to refer the matter back to the Com
mittee on Foieign Relations for investiga
tion) was unexpected. This action sought
to take the whole matter out of the hands
of the committee and defer it until the
middle of April.
"I am a very cool kind of a man," said
Sherman, "but this went beyond my cool- j
ness."
Sherman recounted the various stages of
the .proceedings, the passage of the resolu
tion through both houses, the large ma
jority in both branches and the reference
to conference. The Senate conferees
thought it wise to adopt the House resolu
tions, both meaning the same thine.
Referring to the failure to make tne
resolutions joint, Sherman said the com
mittee did not deem this wise. There was
no politics in the matter; the committee
sought simply to do what was best in the
premises.
Had the resolutions been made joint the
President would have been compelled, at a
critical stage of the war iv Cuba, to either
approve or disapprove them within ten
days. All that was wanted was an ex
pression of the opinion of Congress.
However they may differ from the Presi
dent on matters of domestic policy, no one
believed but that he would be active,
energetic and honest in his dealings with
foreign powers, and in case of war actu
ated by a strong American sentiment.
Sherman eaid he believed the Spanish
Minister was justified in makiug the state
ment he had. The Spanish Minister Baid
that Weyler's name was not mentioned in
the book from which he (Sherman) read
the other day in debate. Sherman called
attention to the fact that when the matter
was referred to in Havana the writer did
not deny it ; he simply said that at that
time he was but a lieutenant-colonel, and
was compelled to obey the orders of his
superior officers in the conduct of the war.
'â¢If there is no state of war in Cuba," ex
claimed Sherman passionately, "where in
the name of hell does war exist, for war is
hell."
There was never a stronger case of war
than that existing in Cuba, and many of
the victories achieved by those ignorant
leaders were brilliant. They were not
ignorant of all things, however; they were
wise enough to tight for liberty. It would
be better if the "better classes" of Cuba, if
there were any there, to join in, Sherman
said, and assist in giving Cuba the liberty
for which her sons were lighting.
Pritcnard (R.) of North Carolina then
took tke floor on the Dupont case and ad
dressed the Senate in defense of Dupont's
claim to the vacant seat from the State of
Delaware.
The following bills were taken from the
calendar and passed:
Senate bill creating the Art Commission
of the United States. It constitutes and
creates a body wnich shall be known and
designated as the Art Commission of the
United States, to consist of five persons,
one member to be named by the President,
two by the Senate and two by the House
of Representatives.
Authorizing the Kansas Northwestern
Railway Company to construct a railroad
through the Indian Territory.
Authorizing the St. Louis, Oklahoma
and Southern Railroad Company to cora
struct a railroad through the Indian Ter
ritory ana Oklahoma Territory.
Granting certain lands to Colorado
Springs, Colo.
For the construction of a revenue cutter,
to cost $150,000, for use in the Gulf of
Mexico ana tributaries.
To permit owners of claims to iron and
coal mines on forest reservations of the
United States to perfect their title thereto.
Empowering fourth- class Postmasters
to administer oaths in pension cases.
The programme as to action on the
Cuban conference report was brought
up by a statement from Gray (D.) of Dela
ware that it was the desire of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations to secure ac
tion to-morrow.
At 5:30 p. M. the committee adjourned
until to-morrow.
PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE.
1 no Interesting Contested Election Cases
Considered.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 12.â The
House to-day spent all of its time in con
sidering contested election cases. One of
them, that of H. Dudley Coleman vs.
Charles F. Buck, from the Second Louisi
ana District, was disposed of without de
bate by the adoption of the resolutions
unanimously reported by Elections Com
mittee No. 2 that Coleman (R.) wa3 not
elected and that Buck (D.) had been and
was entitled to his seat.
Debate upon the otherâ William F.
Aldrich vs. Gaston A. Robbins, from the
Fourth Alabama District â was begun and
contiuued for several hours under an
agreement that several hours should be
allowed for debate. In this case there
were three reportsâ two by the Republican
majority, agreeing that Aldrich was elect
ed and should be seated, but differing as
to tbe size of his majority. The minority
admit that the majority of 3736 returned
for Robbins should be reduced to 559 â
still amply sufficient to warrant their
recommendation that he retain his seat.
The majority recommendation was sup
ported by Moody of Massachusetts, Lin
ney of North Carolina and Royse of In
diana, and the minority by Bartlett of
Georgia. ____________

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
MINISTER WILLIS
IS COMING HOME
Soon to Leave Honolulu for
a Trip to the National
Capital.
MAY ETOT BE RETURNED,
There Has Been Constant Friction
Between the Diplomat and
the Dole Regime.
OSTRACISED BY AMERICANS.
The Hawaiian Legislature Makes an
Appropriation for Princess
Kaiulani.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, March 5.â
United States Minister Willis has an
nounced his intention of leaving this city
for the United States on the steamer leav
ing here on April 15, and the people of
Hawaii are very anxious to find out
whether he is going for good or not. The
United States representative will go first
to Washington to report to his superiors
and thence to Louisville.
Interviewed on the question as to
whether he would return to the islands or
not, the Minister said he was simply tak
ing advantage of the usual sixty days'
leave of absence which is accorded every
foreign representative of the United States
each year. Heretofore he had been too
busy to avail himself of any furlough. He
claimed that his departure from Hono
lolu had no political significance what
ever, but when asked if circumstances
might not arise which would prevent his
return to Honolulu.said : "Of course such
may arise and are not impossible. How
ever. I expect to return in two months. I
am going for a rest, of which I feel the
need greatly."
There are very few here who expect to
see Minister Willis back again, and they
have good reason therefor. He has never
been persona grata with the Dole Govern
ment since his doable dealing with the ex
queen was discovered, and he has virtually
been permitted to remain only on suffer
ance.
Throughout his stay here he has never
missed an opportunity to slight the Ha
waiian republic by ignoring: or squirming
out of attending its official function* arid
refusing to reciprocate the social civilities
of its officials. During the dark days of
December, 1894, when he was intriguing
with the ex-queen and her friends, many
Americans swore they would never darken
his doors as long ag he stayed here, and
they have kept their word.
A complimentary concert wa3 tendered
to General Warfield and the United States
army officers who are touring Hawaii
with him by the Hawaiian band at the ho
tel last night. After the concert dancing
was the order of the evening.
In the Legislature the Senate this morn
ing finished the main appropriation bill
for salaries and payrolls. Among the
items passed to-day was one of $4UOO, be
ing a bi-nnial appropriation for the
Princess Kaiulani. The special commit
tee, to whom the item was referred, re-
ported favorably with the announcement
that the committee had received private
assurances that the ex-heiress to the throne
accepted the situation and the new order
of things and that she would not take part
in or countenance any move looking to the
overthrow of the republic. It is under
stood that this assurance came from Theo.
H. Daviea, her guardian, and that,
bis ward will now return to Hawaii and
take the oath of allegiance to the republic.
After receiving this assurance from the
committee tnere was no further opposition
in the Senate and the item passed.
The item of $130,000 for military pay
rolls of regular troops provoked much dis
cussion and an effort was made to reduce
it half on the ground that the time had
gone by in which any necessity for a
standing army existed. The Minister of
Foreign Affairs Dromised a gradual reduc
tion of the force from this time on, and
with this understanding the Senate finally
allowed the item by a vote of 5 to 4.
It is likely an effort will be made to de
feat the appropriation in the lower House.
The amount of the appropriations passed
to-day for salaries and payrolls for the
fiscal period ending December 31, 1897,
foots up about $2,000,000.
The United States steamship Benning
ton sailed for San Francisco this morning
at 10:30.

if he insists on speaking where he was
originally invited to speak, his wishes as
to Wiliard Hall will be res-pected. Other
wise a theater or large hall will be engaged
for the unique affair, admission to which
will be free by ticket.

The case is an intricate one and involves
a number of fine points. The order of
Judge Caldwell was that a certain number
of crews should be employed for the run

many instances the number of trains has
not been reduced.

KELLY A COMMON SWINDLER.
Letters Telling of a Vast Estate in England
Caused Money to Be Freely Con
tributed.
NEW YORK, N. V-, March 12.â When
Henry F. Kelly, alias Henry Shenfield,
was arrested on Saturday for swindling
Frank Cox, a negro waiter of the Brook
lyn, out of $1 50, a letter written on black
edge paper, purporting to be from his
mother, Mary Jane Shenfield of Manches
ter, England^ was found in his pocket. It
announced that his uncle had died, leav
ing him Â£100.000, and that a lawyer was
on the way to him with Â£10,000 for his im
mediate needs. The letter told him to en
gage a New York lawyer, for whose pay
Â£5000 was provided in the will. This re
sulted in Kelly's cell in the Tombs being
flooded with letters from lawyers of this
city and Brooklyn offering their services.
Kelly confessed last night that he had
previously got money from a lot of law
yers by similar letters. He declared that
he never asked for money, but that sums
of from f25 to $00 had been given to him
by lawyers who say,- m him a rich client.
Kelly said his real name was Henry
Shibley, and that his mother lived in Nor
wich, England. A postoftice clerk has
identitied him as a man who often received
money from Norwich under the name.
Kelly, or Shibley, gave in detail what
purported to be a history of his life. Ac
cording to his statement lie has enlisted in
and deserted from various British regi
ments several times. This resulted finally
in his coming to this country, where he
eventually became a thief. He has served
four or five terms in prison. He will have
a hearing in the Center-street Court to
day.

The weather was fine for duck shooting.
The party killed between twenty and
thirty, of which the President claims a
good share. The President found good
shooting at the lower blinds, but, wishing

the steamer at 1 o'clock tot dinner, where
he met Dr. O'Reiily and Commander
Lamberton. They then shot che rest of
the afternoon from the main blind. The

the day's sport. He boarded the steamer
Maple at 5 p. si. to leave for Washington
at 7 o'clock. __
AN ARBITER OF FASHION.
President Cleveland Objects to
Middle-Aged Women Rid
ing Bicycles.
Many Members of Washington's Swell
Set Will Therefore Refrain From
the Pleasure.
BOSTON, Mass., March 12.â A dispatch
to the Globe from Washington says:
President Cleveland has not often posed
in the role of an arbiter of the social af
fairs of the administration, and, so far as
known, never before has been called upon
to express his opinion as to what the wives
ofthe members of the Cabinet should or
should not do. But if report be correct
Cleveland has placed an executive veto
upon the Cabinet ladies riding bicycles.
AS'ashington is such a paradise for the
wheel that the sight of a Senator, a mem
ber of the diplomatic corps, a Judge of the
Supreme Court or any of the most fash
ionable girls in the swell set astride a
wheel no longer calls for comment.
Recently some of the young members of
the swell set conceived the idea of getting
up a bicycle drill for charity, and some of
the wives of the Cabinet Ministers allowed
the use of their names as patronesses. It
is said that from being passive spectators
they manifested a tendency to become ac
tive participants in the affair.
This coming to the ears of the President,
it is said he plainly placed himself on re
cord as being opposed to women no longer
in their first youth riding the bicycle. He
does not object to the new woman or to lier
riding a bicycle if she is young, but he
draws the line when she approaches mid
dle ape, and it is for this reason that many
of the most prominent women in official
circles will not be seen riding for charity.
BOTH HANDS BLOWN OFF.
Dr. Henry B. Berghill Fatally Injured While
Experimenting With Some
Chemicals.
CHICAGO, 11t,., March 12.â While Dr.
Henry B. Berghill was experimenting with
some chemicals at 323 Center street late
this afternoon an explosion occurred, blow
ing off the doctor's hands and probably
fatally injuring him about the head and
face. He was taken to the Alexian Broth
ers' Hospital. The house in which the
explosion occurred waÃ badly damaged.
Dr. Berghill came here from Russia a
short time ago, having offended the Rus
sian Government through nihilistic asso
ciations. He is a Knight of the Imperial
Order of St. George and also wears the
Roumanian Iron Cross and the Russian
Cross of St. George. The latter was given
him for saving a number of lives during
a nihilistic outbreak in St. Petersburg.

Mexican revolution disturbance is a relic
of the past. Senors Chapa and Aguirre
are still in jail awaiting hearing before the
United States Commissioners. Santi
Teresa is still in Solomonville, Ariz.
The sensation was the result of over
heated imaginations at Nogales and Solo
monville, where Cbapa and A^uirre ran a
paper that abused the Mexican Govern
ment. Mexican Consul Mallen says a
revolution against the present Mexican
administration is impossible. The country
is too carefully watched.

one which is to be constructed near the
docks. T. P. O'Connor, member of the
Scotland division of Liverpool, objected to
the change on the ground that the loca
tion of the site of the new market would
lavor American and Irish cattle.
Hon. W. D. Broderick, Parliamentary
Secretary for the War Office, stated in
reply to a question asked by Dr. Tanner,
Nationalist member for Middle Cork, that
the War Office knew nothing of a report
that English military officers had offered
their services to Spain in the event of an
occurence of hostility between that coun
try and the United States. The penalties
of such action, he added, would be en
forced in accordance with a foreign enlist
ment act.
Right Honorable Walter Long, president
of the Board of Agriculture, in reply to
â¢interrogations said that seventy-two cases
of contagious pleuro- pneumonia had been
found in cattle imported from the United
State* and sixteen imported from Canada
since October, 1892. He had no doubt that
the disease was specifically infectious,
though the degree of infection was rela
tively small. Whatever view the Cana
dian and United States authorities might
take he could only say that it had been
conclusively proved here that the disease
was infectious.
In reply to a question on the subject Mr.
George N. Curzon, Parliamentary Secre
tary of the Foreign Office, stated that the
Government had no information of tlio
settlement of the Venezuelan difficulty.
Despite Mr. Curzon's statement a report is
credited in ministerial circles that Prime
Minister Salisbury has assented to the
formation of an Anglo-American commis
sion that will be authorized to settle the
dispute.
Thomas Gibson Bowles, Tory member
for Lynn Regis, asked if the Government's
attention had been called to statements in
the Spanish press that in "the event' of war
â¢with the United States Spain would fit out
privateers to prey on American commerce,
she not being a party to the declaration of
Paris of 1856.
A. J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treas
ury and Government leader of the House,
recommended that in view of the fact that
there had been no privateers fitted out in
any war since 1856, even by the powers
that had not acceded to the declaration of
Paris, and in view alÂ«o of the fact that the
principle of a neutral flag receiving general
acceptance, he doubted that Spain or any
other country would adopt the measures
suggested. Mr. Balfour held that there
was a general acceptance of the Paris
declaration by all the powers, though not
embodied in a treaty.

berlain as Administrator in Bech
uanaland.
LONDON, Eno., March 12.â Right Hon.

for the colonies, has appointed Sir Rich
ard Edward Rowley Martin as adminis

BAYARD TALKISG AGAIX.
" The Mother Country " the Theme of an
Address.
LONDON, Eng., March 12.â Hon. T.
F. Bayard, United States Embassador to
Great Britain, was a guest at ttie Hugue
not Society's dinner in London last even
ing. Mr. Bayard made a brief speech, in
which he said the most eloquent phrase
which ever expressed a man's thoughts,
namely, "The Mother Country," de
scribed the principal bond of union
between Americans and Englishmen ;
but an American who like himself
could claim Huguenot descent found a
new tie, which was scarcely less strong,
binding him to Great Britain, the tie
which connected those who for many gen
erations had cherished the idea of in
sistence upon their rights of individual
conscience. This tie, he said, would not
be forgotten at tnis time, when every tie
uniting the two great nations ought to be
recognized and, if possible, strengthened.
Mr. Bayard's remarks were received
with cheers.

FOR THE CURE OF DRVSKARDS.
Peculiar Proposition . Before the 3'ete
York Legislature.
ALBANY, Bf. V., March 12.â A peculiar
proposition to eradicate drunkenness was
introduced in the Assembly last night. It
is called "An act to provide for the cure of
the disease of drunkenness by the commu
nity in which the intoxicating liquor is
sold." The bill states that whenever a
person is convicted the second time in po
lice or other courts for being drunk it shall
be the duty of the magistrate to commit
the person to a "hospital for the cure of
drunkards, to remain there until cured of
the disease of drunkenness."
The bill further stipulates that any two
reputable citizens and one physician can
make affidavit that a man is a drunkard,
and that thereupon a magistrate must
commit the alleged drankard to the "asy
lum." The cost of such treatment is to
fall upon the community in which tna
drunkard resides, and is not to exceed $125
for any one case.

DEPRESS SUGAR PRICES

Unless the Cuban War Ends at Once
No Crop Is Expected From
the Islands.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 12. â1n re
gard to the cablegram from London to-day
in which it was stated that the United
Press learns that the American sugar trust
is endeavoring to depress prices because of
hayin-g to buy 500,000 tons of sugar in
Europe before the end of Angust, Secre
tary John E. Searles of the sugar trust said
to-day :
"Unless the Cuban war ends at once, the
sugar crop from the island will be practi
cally nothing. It is now very ripe and
must have attention at once or not at all.
Whi'e the insurgents agreed to permit the
milling of 200,000 tons of sugar by their
friends, the Spanish in turn will prevent
the milling of the crop of the friends of the
insurgents.
"The American Sugar Refining Com
pany will therefore be obliged to seek its
sugar elsewhere. It will obtain most of it
in the shape of beet sugar from Germany.
Of course, anybody in business would try
to get it as cheaply as possible. I can say
nothing more definite as to plans."

Mils to Grant a Charter for the Construe-
iion of a Canal.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 12.-In
the Senate to-day Hansbrough (R.) of
North Dakota introduced a bill to grant a
Federal charter to a company to be known
as the Maritime Canal Company of North
America. The company asks for no bonus
of any sort, but seeks authority to con
struct a canal connecting the great lakes
with the Atlantic Ocean through a channel
26 feet deep and 300 feet wide. The pro
posed canal connects Lake Erie with Lake
Ontario, and from the latter lake nn the St.
Lawrence River to Lake Champlain, and
thence to the water in the Hudson River.
The charter is lengthy, and provides for
the regulation of traffic and tolls by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, for a
rigid limitation of charges and an annual
report to the Government.
In discussing his bill Mr. Hansbrotigh
said be had been told that if our Congress
will not erant the required charter tiie
company is prepared to and will go ahead
in Canada.

A Sister of the Murdered Woman
Witnessed the Terrible
Tragedy
AND SAVED A LITTLE CHILD.
Sequel to an Unhappy Marriage to a
Man With a Most Violent
Temper.
DENVER, Colo., March 12. â About
noon to-day, in a jealous rage, Edward
Guy Ward sho/ and instantly killed hia
young wife, and then placing the weapon
to bis forehead, committed suicide. A
married sister of the wife was a witness to
the murder, and failing to prevent the
tragedy, she picked up the ;>-year-old
child and ran screaming to the neighbors,
while Ward quickiy ran out into the yard,
where he ended his own life. Ward evi
dently was of a violent temper and mucli
the inferior of his pretty wife. They were
married in Chinook, Neo3ha County,
Kans., five years ago, where he was known
as a fanatical member of the United Breth
ren church. He was a stonemason by
trade, but since coming to Denver he ba3
been doing nothing.
His wife was forced to leave him about
a year ago because of his violent temper
and cruelty, and she came to Denver to
reside with her mother, a Mrs. E. A. Perry.
Ward followed her here and soughi to
make up. but this the wife would not do.
An employe of the Windsor Hotel named
Grant Matthews had been calling on Mrs.
Ward, which fact aroused the most vio
lent passion of Ward, who repeatedly
threatened to kill both his wife and her
new friend.

ABERDEEN, S. Dak., March 12.â Jacob
Marty, aged 52, a resident of McPherson
County, while in a state of despondency,
dragged his sick wife out of bed and cut
her throat, nearly severing her head
from the body. He then cut his own
throat, both dying immediately. They
leave eleven children. Despondency was
caused, it is thought, by extreme poverty.

He will let the trouble grow and grow until

PLANS OF THE REPUBLICANS.
There Is a Prospect of Further Trou
ble Over the Unseating of
Members.
FRANKFORT, Kt., March 12.â 1n the
Senate this morning Jones (R.) offered an
amendment to the journal which made it
appear that the Senate had adjourned be
fore the report declaring the seats vacant
was considered.
The Senate voted down the amendment
and approved the journal as it stood.
Jomes and Walton, the unseated Sen
ators, were in the House when the Senate
was announced at the door, ready for the
joint session.
When the roll was called none of the
Republicans responded to their names un
til Deboe was called, when he responded.
Jones, Lay and Landes followed and all
the Republicans began answering to their
names. Neither clerk called the names of
the unseated members. No one attempted
to interfere with James and "Walton, who
still had seats on the floor.
Upon a parliamentary point the Repub
licans refused to vote and broke the quo
rum. The chair decided that no quorum
had voted and the motion was lost.
Carroll began to indicate silent members
ana forced from the chair the most im
portant ruling of the session. He declared
he would rule on all questions that seventy
members must be present "and voting."
â  removed the danger of the Demo
crats from the presence of James and Wal
ton, even if Duniap were also present.
. The chair demanded the rollcall for the
vote for Senator. The Republicans did
â not Tot" and the Democrats divided be
tween Carlisle and Blackburn in the usual
proportion.
The session then adjourned. It is agreed
that the chain's ruling that seventy must
be present and voting relieves the sitaa
i n. Nobody will now object to the
prt^ence of the unseated members and no
trouble is looked for.
The Democrats are jubilant over the
chair's ruling. They will get the seventy
votes necessary to elect before the Le~isla
ture adjourns on Tuesday.
In an interview to-night Hon. St. John
Boyle stated his belief that if he is not
cert .nobody will be.
"l^ a \,bole aim of the Democrats now,"
said I;?. " is to keep a Republican from
being elected, and they do not seem in
clined to stop at anything to accomplish
their aim; but Republicans are united to
a man and thoroughly organized, and it
just needs the opportunity to put our
.plans in operation and secure, my elec
tion."
Ihe plans of the Republicans are all in
the hands of M^\ Boyle, Attorney-General
Taylor and Senator Bennett, and none of
the other members know what is to be
the programme each day until the joint
Assembly is adjourned. The cue is given
Senator Bennett, whose name head 3 the
roll. He votes or remains silent when his
name is called, the others following suit.
By this means the secrets of tne campaign
are kept until time for action.
Late to-night it was learned authorita
tively that plans are effected for seating
Dunlap in the House to-morrow. Tw
matter is being kept very secret. Dunla^'s
presence in the joint assembly will be the
occasion for a Democratic storm. If he
votes so will Senators James ana Walton,
and in that event the Democrats will at
tempt to vote Kaufman, the unseated
member, also.
There is some talk to-night of a special
session being called for the consideration
of the revenue bills, but nothing authentic
can be learned.
CAMPBELL. JSOT A CAXDIDATE.
Ohio's Ex- Governor Talks of the Prob
lems of the Campaign.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 12.â 1n an
interview to-day ex-Governor Campbell
said any good man who wants it can have
the Democratic nomination for President
this year. He denied that he was a candi
date.
"Who will be the nominee?" '-.
"Whitney and Matthews would make a
splendid ticket if they would accept. New
York and Indiana are a good old Demo
cratic combination, and I don't know how
we would feel if the two States were not
both represented on the ticket."
"But I believe," he continued, "that the
next President will be elected by the House
of Representatives. There will be a fight
in both the National conventions between
the extreme gold men and the extreme
silver" men. Both are cranks. The two
parties as Democrats and Republicans
have really no difference on the money
question. The silver men will r,ot be sat
isfied with the Republican platform and
they will bolt and lose the party enough
States to throw the election of the Presi
dent into the House."
"What sort of money planks will the
National platforms contain?"
"That I cannot say, but this is the day
of straddles. The Republican party claims
to favor a gold standard, yet none of the
leaders will come out and declare for it in
bo many words. If McKinley has done it
. I have not heard of it. Therefore, a com
promise plank with the Republicans will
be a straddle."
"What are your views on the money
question?"
"I want international free coinage of
silver at the ratio of 15}Â£ to 1. : I consider
'ingle gold - standard advocates: as
much wrong on one .side as I be
lieve single silver standard men on
the other. I am opposed to our
country goincr ahead alone and coining
si.ver free. No one nation can do it and
surv.ve, but the United States,' Germany
and France could do it without England's
co-operation. With an international
agreement all troubles with the money
question would vanish, and I expect to live
to see such an ;!!Ta:ii:e:iient effected.''
."What about tne Ãepublican nomination
for President?" * i
"Well, theyfdon't seem to have arrived
at any understanding yet."
"Why, what's the matter with Mc-
Kinley?"
"Oh, nothing, only he'll find a great deal
of green goods in his grip when he unpacks
it at St. Louis."

city. She is a tall and graceful brunette,
with dark, dreamy eyes, and almost perfect
complexion, and is said to have the most
beautiful head of hair in Petaluma.
A del gation from the northern end of
the county surrounded the ballot-boxes
this forenoon and some very plethoric en
velopes were deposited, bearing the name
of Mis 3 Mamie Swain of Healdsburg. Miss
Swain is one of the prettiest of the many
pretty girls of Healdsburg and her win
ning manners and sunny disposition make
her very popular in the society of that so
ciable town. She is a plump demi-blonde
of medium height, with dark eyelashes
that fringe a pair of deep brown eyes such
as Fred Emerson Brooke writes of, and if
selected for queenly honors would be every
inch a queen.
The latest report places Miss Annie
Koch of this city in the lead. This popu
lar young lady was born and raised in
Santa Rosa and would make an ideal
queen. She has clear-cut, regular
features, sparkling eyes and is blessed
with that '"blush rose" complexion that
pure air and a tine climate give to Cali
fornia girls.
Many other candidates are being voted
for, and new names are coming in hourly.
The vote has not been officially an
nounced yet, and daily reports will not be
made by the election committee for several
days.
Professor Roncovieri, the leader of the
American Concert Band, will be present at
meeting of the directors to-night, and the
question of music lor the carnival will be
settled.
ILLICIT BHAXDI SEIZED.
Government Atje.nl* Make a Big Haul at
Henry BolU's Distillery.'
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 12.â An im
portant seizure of illicit brandy was made
near this city to-day by United States
revenue officers. For some time it has
been suspected that some of the wineries
and distilleries in tnis section were turn
ing out brandy that the Government re
ceived no revenue from, and the local
revenue officers have been on th*o alert.
To-day Colonel B. P. Cromwell, special
revenue agent, and B. M. lliomaj, his
assistant, arrived from San Francisco and,
on being joined by Deputy Collector lUick
ingh&in of Ukiah and United States
Gauger John AlcMinu Jr., proceeded at
once to the winery and distillery of Henry
Bolle, about six miles east of this city.
The distillery was first searched and
everything there found to be all right and
the party Â«t once proceeded to search the
big stone winery. This move on the part
of the officers was apparently unexpected,
for snugly concealed among the casks of
wine were about 600 gallous of illicit
brandy in packages.
The whole plant, including over GOOO gal
lons of wine and brandy, was at once seized
and placed in charge of an officer.
The Henry Bolle place consists of 544
acres of land, of which about 76 acres are
set in the very best resistant vines. The
buildings and improvements are all new
and up to date, and the entire place is
valued at |25,000.
FIR AT VAZ.T,KJO.
Hay Barn I>eatroy>-dâ Presumably the
Work of Tramps.
VALLEJO, Cal., March 12.â At5o'clocfc
this morning a large barn containing sixty
tons of choice baled hay, belonging to M.
Horan, wood anu grain dealer, was set on
fireÂ» presumsbly by two tramps, and to
tally destroyed. The building was insured
for $200 and' the hay for several hundred.
Several adjoining buildings were saved
through the exertions of the Fire Depart
ment and the ample supply of water be
longing to the city. The men were not
sleeping in the barn, and it is a mystery
how they could set the barn on fire from
the inside, as all the doors were padlocked,
and the place had not been opened the day
before.
ISDIAX KIDXAPISG.
Little Girl Twice Abducted Front the
Colville Retcrvntion.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 12. â Word
has just been received from the Colville
reservation that the little Indian girl
who was abducted some months
ago by a couple of Indians, who
took her to the mountains and
assaulted her, is again missing. After
weeks of search the men were found and
brought into this city and are now in the
County Jail waiting trial at the spring
term of the United States Court.
The girl has been living with her grand
father, and being a valuable witness for
the prosecution the defendants are said
to have connived to see that she
was taken away, and it â is charged
by a number of their friends
swooped down on the home of her grand
father and carried her again to the moun
tains, so that she cannot appear as a wit
ness against the two men. Deputy Mar
shals have gone to the reservation with the
hope of securing the girl as well as the
arrest of those who have carried her off a
second time.
H BATTLE'S MIBSIXG MAX.
Sothing HaÂ» Been Heard of George W.
Ly*le for Two Weeki.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 12.â Two
weeks ago Monday night, while suffering
from temporary insanity, brought on by
spinal trouble, George W. Lysle, formerly
a member of the firm of Lysle Brothers,
big Cincinnati coal dealers, escaped from
Fairhaven Hospital and has not been seen
since.
He is supposed either to have com
mitted suicide or to be wandering in the
dense forests back of Whatcom. His
friends incline to the former theory,
though his brother, John Lysle, a freight
clerk on the steamer State of Washington,
when seen to night said he still had hopes
that the worst had not happened.
Lysle sustained an injury to his spine,
from which he never fully recovered,
though able to conduct a more or less suc
cessful business, many years ago while re
siding in Cincinnati, where two uncles of
the late John \V. Lvsle, also members of
the coal firm, tooK up what is now known
as the Lysle donation claim in the city of
Fairhaven.
The missing man is 35 years old and has
a wife residing at San Bernardino, Cal. He
had been conhned in the hospital about
three months.

Gibson as a committee to go to San Fran
cisco and present Stockton's claims for the

Central Committee, in refusing to [ariici- :
pate in the effort to bring the convention I
to this city,
Mr. Gould absolutely refused to appoint ,

The friends of Governor Budd and Chair-

been for some time, and Jlr. Gouid'sop

LOVERS' QUARREL SETTLED.
Anselmo 7>. Jiittciieourt Agrees to Wed
Mary J. Bowen.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. March 12 -The
estranged relations existing between Mary
J. Bowen and Anselmo D. Bittencourt for
some time on account of the latter's refusal
to carry out his promise of marriage are
about to be patched up. Both part.ies are
Portuguese. About a month ago arrange
ments were made for a marriage, but at
the last moment Bittencourt backed out.
Miss Bowen then charged Bittencourt
with deceiving her under promise of mar
riage. His examination was to have been
held to-day, but as he agreed to keep his
promise the case was continued and will
probably be dropped.

carry out his promise an agreement was
tiled" in the Recorder's office this afternoon,
whÂ»rel)y he agrees to marry Miss Bowen
before June 1, 1896. In case of failure to
fulfill his part of the ngieement he agrees

QUEER SEDUCTION CASE.
The Mother of bight Children Sues a
Portland Lawyer.
PORTLAND, Or., March 12.â A 510,000
damage suit for seduction is attracting
much attention hereâ that of Fricilla
Girard against Edgar Grimm, a promi
nent married lawyer. The hearing began
this morning. Mrs. Girard said she was
29 years of age and that she had eight
children â seven by her husband, who died
in 1892, and one by the defendant. She
also claimed that her eldest child was now
17 years of age, which, if true, would make
her a mother at theatre of 12. An effort
was made to introduce in evidence the
child in dispute to show the similarity in
its features and those of the defendant,
but the court, probably realizing the error
in judgment liable to result from such
evidence, ruled the exhibit out.

JOKES' TRIAL AT CARSON
Inspector Mason Tells the Jury
What He Knows About
Bogus Melts.
Other Witnesses Testify as to the
Defendant's Transactions in
Stocks.
CARSON, Xev., March 12.â The morn
ing session in the trial of John T. Jones,
the alleged bullion thief, opened with
Andrew Mason resuming his testimony.
"The spurious melt," he said, "could
have been made from two to five ounces
short in weight and never have been de
tected. It would have been impossible to
make the bogus melt in February, 1893.
It must have been made by June, 1893.
It could have been made by taking silver
melts containing a little gold or adding a
little base metal. I account for the un
usual surplus of 1895 in silver to the trans
mutation of gold for silver in making
bogus melts.
Witness thought that every rich melt
miglit be bogus. It would be possible for
the refiner to substitute any metal and
send it to the assayer for assaying. The
only way to detect it would be for some
one to discover it. Inspectors were
present in the settlements of 1891, 1892 and
1893. Jones had told the United States
Attorney that he had probably $18,000 or
$20,000 he had made in stocks.
Detective Gallagher then took the
stand. He said he had a conversation
with John T. Jones at Bryson's saloon
and Jones had stated that he borrowed
$2000 and by stock transactions had made
$30,000. Jones seated that he knew he was
suspected and wished to assist all he
could in the investigation.
G. R. Chandler, clerk of Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s Bank of San Francisco, was the next
witness. He testified that he had exam
ined the records of Well", Fargo &, Co.'s
Bank. Defendant had stocks of several
mines â Con. Virginia and Overman. The
profit as shown by the books wa? $21 on
200 shares of Con. Virginia mining stock.
T. R. Hofer, Wells, Fareo & Co.'s agent at
Carson and cashier of the Bullion Banir.
was then called. He testified that lie had
ma<!e an account of Jones' transactions
with said bank and that the stuck trans
actions from September 23. 1891, to De
cember 6, I^)2, showed a loss of $280 22.
T. R. Hofer, cashier of the Bullion Bank,
and Colonel Ives of the San Francisco
Stock-brokers' Association, s-hqwed that
the defendant had lost money in stocks,
not having made in stock speculations the
large sums he squandered.
George McLaughlin was again recalled
to give expert testimony regarding the
stamping ot the spurious bars to s-how its
age. Witness jrave a detailed account of
his stamping of the bars and their differ
ent temperatures. The bar stamped hud
been placed in the custody of the clerk of
the court. The bar was produced in court.
It was one of the *x>urious bars. The
spurious bar that had been heated and
stamped w:is placed alongside the one that
had not been so treated, and the witness
showed the jury the difference in the
stamping and color.
They were very much interested in the
exhibit and crowded around the witness.
Theobiect of the testimony was to
show that the spurious bars were stamped
hot and therefore melted in 1893. Hot and
coW stamping had been done on the same
bar and tne jurors were shown the differ
ent appearance through a glass. The die
that stamped the bar in settlement had
been broken since the stamping was done
as a piece of the figure 4 was chipped out.
Chrii Zabriskie, a very important witness
for the Government, was expected to-day
but was delayed. He, will arrive in the
morning ana the Government expects to
show by this witness that Jones was short
in his accounts several thousand dollars in
the bank of Candelaria before he went into
the mint and obtained his position in the
mint through parties who wanted him to
make good his shortage and they com
pelled him to give up a certain sum every
month of his official salary.

THE LIEUTENANT
GOVERNORSHIP.
Will Jeter Be Retained in
the Office He Now
Occupies?
WHAT MR. BUDD* SAYS.
It All Depends Upon the Terms
of the Coming Election
Proclamation.
CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAW-
Knotty Points That Are Puzzling
Local Politicians and State
Officials.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 12.â There
seems to be a general impression among
local politicians and State officials .that
Governor Budd fully intends leaving the
office of Lieutenant-Governor out of his
election proclamation, which is soon to be
issued, and by so doing, retain Jeter in that
position. When interviewed on the'sub
ject by a Cam. representative, the Governor
said:
'When the time comes, if T interpret the
law to require a proclamation for the
election of a Lieutenant-Governor, I shall
probably issue one. The fact is. 1 am in
doubt about the construction of the law on
(his point, and will certainly consult with
the Attorney-General before arriving at
any decision. At the present time there
are several ways of testing Jeter's rights t'>
the position he occupies, should any one
desire to <lo so. For instance, the law
makes the Lieutenant-Governor a member
of the Board of Regents. Jeter now holds
a position in that capacity and if any one
desires to contest his rights as Lieutenant-
Governor, way do they not contest his
right to act as a State Regent? There is
absolutely no section of law which provides
that the President pro tern. of the Senate
shall ever become Lieutenant-Governor,
â  although he may become Governor should
certain exigencies occur; for that matter,
there is no surety that Jeter would not be
re elected to the position he now occupies
should I find it necessary to mention that
position in my election proclamation."
"Governor, suppose it possible that Jeter
should hold over, would he have the right
to appoint the various committees?" was
then asked.
"That matter rests entirely with the
Senate itself, as I understand it, and my
recollection is that when Waterman was
Lieutenant-Governor the Senate, which
was Democratic at that time, approved the
appointment of all committees, either by
the President pro tern. or by the body it
self, I forget which. At all events, if the
body be' Democratic and the President pro
tern. Democratic, then undoubtedly they
will allow him to name the committees;
if not, as I said before, the solution of
the problem will rest with the body it
self."
In speaking of the subject to-day one of
the Republican State officials said: "Gov
ernor Budd can retain Jeter in office if he
sees lit, there is no doubt. He can claim
to be supported by the law of 1880 regard
ing election proclamations, which law has
never been changed. The law is embodied
in section 1053 of the Political Code and
provides that 'at least thirty days before
a general election, and whenever he or
ders a special election to rill a vacancy in
the office of State Senator or member of
the Assembly, at least ten days before
such special election the Governor must
is-ue an election proclamation, under his
hand and the great seal of the State, and
transmit copies thereof to the Boards of
SK[>ervisors of the counties in which such
elections are to be held.'
'This law provides that the Governor
must issue a proclamation in cases of spe
cial election, where the vacancies to be
filled are those occurring in the offices of
State Senator or Assemblyman, but it says
nothing about Lieutenant-Governor or any
other State office. Special elections are de
lined by law to be such as are held to sup
ply vacancies in any office. It is plain,
therefore, that the Governor is not, under
the law, compelled to issue a proclamation
J>>r an election to fili the office of Lieuten
ant-Governor.
"Now, if Governor Budd wants to take
advantage of this omission in the law he
can do so. In the case of Kenfield vs.
Governor Irwin the Supreme Court de
cided that it is essential to the validity of
a popular election that the time at which
the same is to be held should be desig
nated in advance. Now, suppose the Gov
ernor claims that the law does not direct
him to put the office of Lieutenant-Gov
ernor in the proclamation when he same
is for the tilling of a vacancyâ or, ir other
words, is a special electionâ is it n<-t plain
that an election of a Lieutenant-G >vernor,
inasmuch as the people had received no
notice, would be invalid ? The case of
KenfieM vs. Irwin is the same as this.
"In 1875 J. W, Mandeville was elected
StKte Controller, and in February, 1876, he
died in office. Three days later, in con
formauce with a provision of the constitu
tion, Governor Invin appointed W. B. C.
Brown to J- II the office of State Controller
for the unexpired term of Mandeville, de
ceased. On November following there was
an election and D. M. Ken field and W. B.
C. Brown were rival candidates for the of
fice of Controller. Kenlield received the
majority vote cast, but the Governor re
fused to issue him his commission to the
orhVe for whioh he was elected on the
ground that he had issued no proclamation
for an election to fill the office of Con
troller.
"The Supreme Court held in this case
that Governor Invin was right in not issu
ing the commission, for the reason that the
ejection was nut proclaimed. This decision j
has been specially affirmed by subsequent i
decisions of the Supreme Court. The Gov- I
ernor, in my o; -inion, is anxious to retain ;
a Democrat in the office of Lieutenant-
Goverr-or. and I am of the opinion that he
will neglect to say anything about a va
caacy in that office when the time comes I
for him to issue his election proclamation, j
I do not see how it is to be helped, either, I
for the reason that you cannot mandamus j
him until he has refused to act, which he j
probably will not do until the proelama
tk>n has been issued thirty days before j
election, as t lie law requires.."
In his interview to-day Governor Budd
said: "There is a very curious proviso in
the law rt-latinj: to the Lieutensnt-Govcr- j
norship. For instance, if the Governor ,
dies the Lieutenant-Governor does not be
come Governor, antt therefore there is
no vacancy in* the office of Lieutenant-
Governor. By virtue of bis being Lieuten
ant-Governor the powers and duties of the
olh'ce of Governor simply devolve upon
hiii}. Should he die while exercising such
powers the President pro tern. of the Senate
shall act as Governor. In that case he
would be Governor of the State and Presi
dent pro tern. of the Senate at the same
time.
"The constitution provides that when
vacancies occur in either house the Gov
ernor, or the person exercising the func
tions of the Governor, shall issue writs of
election to fill such vacancies. You will
notice by this that when a Lieutenant-
Governor dies there is no provision of law
for any person to exercise his functions.
A vacancy simply exists which the Gov
ernor must till. If the Governor and
Lieutenant-Governor both die the Presi
dent pro tern, of the Senate will exercise
the functions of Governor."
It is claimed by prominent local politi
cians that while they do not entertain the
slightest doubt but that Governor Budd
will attempt to retain Jeter, nominations
for the position of Lieutenant-Governor
will be made on both tickets, no matter
what action the executive may deem tit to

SANTA CRUZ'S BAD BOYS
The Young Burglars Make Full
Confessions of Their
Crimes.
â  One of the Lads Is the Son of Hon
est and Industrious
Parents.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 12.â The !
boys who were arrested last night for com
, mitting all the burglaries which have
baffled the police of this city for many
weeks past have all made confessions to
night to the District Attorney. They were
j put in separate quarters in the jail where
I there was no possible means of communi-
I cation.
Archie Schenck told of his implication
in the robberies early in the evening, and
Claude Ranger, the colored boy, betrayed
himself by talking too much. The ring
leader, John Weinhurst, alias Howard,
I who is confined in one of the steel cells,
overheard a visitor to one of the prisoners
telling the story and listened attentively.
He heard the remark made that one boy I
| had confessed everything and the other j
I boy was about to do likewise, so when Dis- i
j trict Attorney Lindsay approached Wein- I
| hurst later he made a clean breast of the j
affair. He acknowledged entering the sev- i
eral places that were robbed arid obtaining
money from all but one. He said his only j
companion was bchenck. Schenck is. the
j son of an honest, industrious father, who
feels his boy's implication in the crime
moat keenly.
It is probable that the two young boys,
I Schenck and Wilson, will be sent to the
lone Reform School and that Weinhurst
will plead guilty, for ho has served thirty
days in the County Jail for vagrancy and
a term in a reform" school.
FiREBLtiS ABROAD.
Several Incendiary Attempts on the Out
skirts of Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 12.â Several
complaints have been made recently of
attempts to fire houses without the limits
of the city and beyond the reach of the
Fire Department. But no direct informa
tion reached Sheriff Besse until this
evening.
A farmer in Happy Valley named Duke,
reported that an attempt was made last
night to set fire to his house, and that an
employe of his friend fired several shots at
the incendiary and thought he hadhit one.
Another report was received that the base
ment of the residence of Mr. Bingbam, at
East Santa Cruz, was fired and that kero
sene oil was discovered after the fire had
been extinguished.
IMPORTANT TRIAL AT FRESy>
Canal and Irrigation Company Sued for
Heavy Itamages.
FRESNO, Cal., March 12.â The trial of
the suit brought by the Fresno Milling
Company against the Fresno Canal and
Irrigation Company was begun in Judge
Webb's department of the Superior Court
here yesterdday.
This suit, which in an indirect way
means a severe contest, where a large sum
is involved, has been hung up in the courts
here for more than two years without
trial.
The plaintiff claims heavy damages of
the canal company on the Vround " that
said defendant company failed to comply
with the terms of a contract wherein it
agreed to supply power to the milling
campany.
This city is, in equity, mixed up in this
snit, because it filled up the canal and
thereby deprived the defendant company
from complying with its part of the con
tract. Several Jeading lawyers are em
ployed in the ca?e.
Harry SherwooJ represents the Sperrv
Bros, as plaintiffs, while the defendant's
company is represented by E. B. Perrin.
The canal over which this suit originated
is the old Moses J. Church ditch, the first
irrigation canal ever made in this part of
the San Joaquin Valley.

EMIGRANT GAP, Cal., March 12.â E.
A. Curtis of Blue Canyon, while walking
on the railroad track toward Towles last
evening, found the body of an aged man
lying near the track with his head badly
mashed. From the description given it is
believed to be the body of Mr. Nichols, an
aged and feeble rerident of Shady
Run, who started from Towles this
afternoon to walk to his home,
a distance of four miles, and while en
deavoring to get out of the way slipped on
the ice and his head fell underthe wheels.
The body has not yet been brought in and
identity cannot be possibly established.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
WILL PREVENT A
FLOOD OF CHINESE
An Interesting Case Just
Decided at Portland,
Oregon.
QUONG SING'S PETITION.
An Acrobatic Celestial Who Was
Merchant or Laborer at
Pleasure.
JUDGE BELLINGER'S DECISION.
Danger of Opening a Loophole for
the Entry of Swarms of
Mongols.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 12.â United
States Judge Bellinger for the past two
days has been hearing the petition of
Quong Sing for aa order admitting trim to
registration. The case is an interesting
one, involving the opening of a loophole
through which steamer loads of Chinese
laborers might eventually creep in.
Quong Sing afiirms that he was for
many years a merchant at Salem, Or. In
1894 lie decided on a trip to China, and
took out a certificate naming him as a
merchant and entitling him to return to
this country, which latter course he took
in 1895. being landed by the Collector of
Customs at Tacoma.
On arrivine at Salem he found business
so depressed that he concluded to occupy
himself as a laborer until such time as
trade revived. This, under the act he
could not do with a merchant's certificate,
as the first Government officer that hap
pened to become apprised of his sailing
under false colors would land him in jail
for deportation.
Application was made to the customs
officials for a laborer's certificate, but these
officers could not see their way to grant It.
Quong Sing then filed his petition asking
the United States District Court to order
the Secretary of the Treasury to issue such
laborer's certificate in place of the mer
chant's papers he now holds.
Judge Bellinger this morning denied
the petition, claiming he had no juris
diction in the matter, in the first place,
and, in the second, the granting of such a
petition would mean the forming of a
precedent which would Mood the United
States courts with Chinese desiring sim
ilar ctianges, and of whom nothing could
be told as to whetn - the certificates of
fered were fraudulent or not.
TROUBLE AT MILL VALLEY
The California Construction Com
pany Is Ordered to Spare
a Tree.
The Mclnneses Prepared to Protect
Their Property at Any
i Cost.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March
perintendent Graves of the California Con
struciion Company, which is engaged in
the buildinc of ihe Mill Valley and Mount
Tamalpais Scenic Railroad, was served
with a notice yesterday stating that
the company would be held liable for
damages if they cut any trees or destroyed
other property fronting on the lands
owned by J. H. Mclnnes.
Not only did Mr. Mclnnes secure the
above notice, but he stationed two men,
M. Fitzgibbons and Ralph Antonella, near
the property with instructions not to al
low any trees to be cut.
It seems that the line of tne mountain
road runs for about 300 yards in Corte
Madera avenue, in Mill Valley, and in
lay ing out the route along this avenue
the Mountain Road Company thought it
best to run the track upon one side of the
avenue. By so doing the road will run
within two feet of the sidewalk, in front of
Mr. Mclnnes' property, and in so doing a
large tree just at the entrance of Mr. Mc
lnnes' house will have to be sacrificed.
The men were about to cut the tree
down, when the owner appeared upon the
scene and protested against any Buch
work.
When the notice wss served upon Su
perintendent Graves he said that if any
attempt to interfere with the work of the
men was made he would bring suit against
Mclnnes for damages on account of delay
ing the work of constructing the road.
Mclnnes took all the precautions neces
sary. "I have served the notice upon
them," said he, "and now I intend to
guard the tree and see that it is not cut
down."'
"Yes, and I intend to see that the tree is
not felled," his son, A. Mclnnes â also a
business man in Mill Valleyâ replied,
touching his hip pocket significantly.
All this afternoon some une has been
guarding the tree and if tne Construction
Company's men attempt to cut it down
there will be trouble.
Later this afternoon new measurements
were made along Corte Madera avenue,
and it in possible that the track will be laid
so as to avoid Mr. Mclnnes' tree.
Since the published statements in The
Call to the effect that the mountain road
intended to use locomotives on its line,
together with electric-cars, thÂ£ people are
complaining. They say that they do not
mind electric-cars running through the
valley, but they do object to steam en
gines, and it is probable that the people
will combine and tight the people.
This morning M. M. O'Shaughnessy, a
large land-owner in Mill Valley, instructed
Constable E. E. Gray to arrest any man in
the employ oi the mountain road or the
California Construction Company who at
tempted to plow up or in any way inter
fere with the road in front of his property
near Eastland station.
A meeting of Corte Madera avenue prop
erty-owners was held to-day in the office
of Mr. O'Shaughnessy in "the Crocker
buildjng in San Francisco, at which were
present or represented : George F. Marsh,
H. S. Bridge, Maurice Windmiller, If. M.
O'Shaughnessy, J. H. Mclnnes, P. S. Fur
person and others. A permanent organi
zation was formed and George F. Marsh
elected president and M. If. O'Shangh
nessy secretary. The organization is
known as tho Mill Valley Property-Own
ers' Association. At a previous meeting a
committee was appointed to obtain reliable
information from responsible attorneys in
regard to whether the Mount Tamalpais
Scenic Railroad had a right to occupy the
streets of Mill Valley without the consent
of the people residing thereon.
The committee reported that the attor
neys had said that the railroad company
had no right to taKe the streets without se
curing, the necessary rignt3 and privi
leges. ; rv<? ....;.
Immediately this information was tele
phoned to ; Mill Valley to I Mr. and Mrs.
Mclnnes, who had all the while been keep
ing the en fr"om plowing up > the r : streets.
This morning one of ttie men employed
by the Construction Company attempted
to run the plow over the road in front of
the Mclnnes property, when Mrs. ; Mc
lnnes ordered the man away. He re
fused to. go and started up. the horses,
with the intention of cutting through the
street, but Mrs. Mclnnes grabbed the
handles and overturned the plow. â 
"If you were a man," said the fellow, "I
would thrash you."
"Oh, no, you wouldn't," replied ; the
lady; 'If I was a man you would run
away." .
No attempt was made to-day to do any
more plowing, but the property-owners
have stationed an armed guard over the
roads, â  with instructions to stop : any
attempt on the part of the mountain road
people to gain possession. The guard-will
keep watch all night. A constable is also
on : watch with the necessary papers to
serve on the men if they commence work at
any time of the night.
The people are determined not to see
their prettiest driveway ruined when it is
possible for the road to run a few hundred
feet to the east, and avoid traveling on the
Corte Madera avenue at all.
Excitement is at fever pitch, but it is not
thought that any violence will be re
sorted to.
B AX RAFAEL'S ZEAVIXG QUESTION
Jiailroada Must Heduee lheir Hate of
Transportation.
SAN RAFAEL. Cal.. March 12.â There
was but one subject of conversation in San
Rafael yesterday, and that is about the
mass-meeting held Tuesday night to dis
cuss the question of obtaining lower trans
portation rates from the railroads.
While it is generally conceded that no
lower rates will be given, at least for the
present, it is said that the people are
satisfied with the results of the meeting,
for it has brought before the railroads
the feeling of the people of San
Rafael in regard to the important matter.
Every one is agreed that the town must
secure lower passenger rates before it can
hope to increase its population, and a
committee of fifteen citizens will wait upon
the directors of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad and those of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Road, and request them
to consider the matter of increasing the
train service and lowering the passenger
and freight rates.
Until thisAommitte returns its report
nothin i can to done in the matter.
There are rumors of an opposition rail
road running a ferry system to ;-an Quen
tin, and train from there to San Ra ael,
but no one appears to know anything about
the matter, and little stock is placed in the
rumor.
JAY GOULD AND HIS WIVES
Seattle Furnishes a Story on the
Dead Financier's Marital
Exploits.
Apropos of the Suit of a Woman
Claiming to Be the First Wife's
â¢ Daughter.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 12.â Apropos
of the story going the rounds to the effect
that Jay Gould was twice married and
that an action had recently been be un
against the Gould estate by a woman
claiming to be his daughter by the first
wife of the famous financier, Jason Gould
Corbin, a well-to-do farmer residing at
Auburn, King County, tells an interesting
tale.
Gould and Corbin, so the latter says,
were children together and grew up at
Roxbury, Delaware County, N. Y. Corbin
took his Christian names from Jason
Gould, an uncle of the late railroad mag
nate, and his aunt, according to the story
told, became the second wife of John B.
Gould, Jay Gould's father.
That which retards the suit from recog
nition by the executors of the Gould es
tate, us :ii U'u'fil in the story published in the
latter part of February, is the lack of proof
that Jay Gould and Jason Gould were the
same; and now comes Farmer Corbin,
who says :
"I do not know anything about Gould's
marriage to a first "wife; but I do know
that Jay Gould and Jason Gould were one
and the same man. We were born at Rox
bury, Delaware County, NÂ« V., and lived
on adjoining farms. His father's name
was John B. Gould, who was afterward
married a second time to mv aunt. 1 was
named after a brother of John B. Gould,
who was a threat friend of our folks. Jay
was named after the same man, but he
was always called Jason in those days.
"We never exactly went to school to
gether, Jason and I, but we grew up
together. I went to school just acrosy the
ridge and Jason went to the other one.
He was a few years younger than me, and
I think he would be about 65 now if he
were alive. I came West in '49, having
lost all track of Gould years before. We
were never good friends. I tell you lie
was always a rascal and ever looking for
some one to do up.
"In the sixties I occasionally saw Gould,
and then he was known as Jay, instead of
Ja^on. He was then controlling the Erie
Railroad with Jim Fiske, and was a big
man. I lived on the line of the road at
this time.
"I can swear," Corbin said in conclu
sion, "that Jay Gould and Jason (iould
were one and the same man, but I don't
know anything about his first marriaee,
for 1 must have been away then. Sa r ;ih
Brown was the maiden name of the alleged
first wife of Jay Gould."

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 12.â
Lieutenant J. M. Hetherington, now at

has been detailed to take charge of the
hydrogtaphic office here. No officer has
been in charge since Lieutenant H. T.
Mayo was ordered to the Bennington over

The steamer Bertha, owned by the Alaska
Commercial Company, sailed from here to
day, bound for Sitka.'lrom which place she
goes in the regular passenger and freight
business to Cooks Inlet and Prince Wil

Captain King and wife and all except
three of the crew of the British ship City of

be discharged by Saturday next. The ves

towed after a six-day fumigation.
Officers of the revenue cutter Wolcott
report that the present winter is undoubt
edly the most severe experienced in
Alaska since thirteen years ago. During
the months of January and February the
mercury was never above zero, and at both
Sitka and Juneau snow fell almost con
tinuously during that time.
There was a big auction sale here this
afternoon at the Custom-house of contra
band goods seized by inspectors during
the last two months. Everything went
cheap except opium, which brought $10 a
I)ound. The same brand has been sold
lere after importation for $9, and the sale
indicates that opium smuggling is no
longer successful on Pupet Sound. The \
buyer to-day was the famous h'eidback of

LOWRY TRIAL
AT LOS ANGELES
The Embezzlement Case Is
Finally Submitted to
the Jury.
EXPECTED TO DISAGREE
Ex-County Clerk Ward Unmer
cifully Scored by Defend
ant's Counsel,
BLAMED FOE THE DEFICIENCY.
Should a Verdict of Guilty Be Found
the Case Will Be Ap
pealed.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 12. -The
case of ex-Deputy County Clerk Frank E.
Lowry, on- trial for embezzling public
moneys, was submitted to the jury this
afternoon. At 11 p. m. no agreement had
been reached and !he jury was locked tip
for the night. The chances are they will
not agree, but no information from the in
side can be had to-night. The defpnse
stakes its hopes on a hung jury, and the
prosecution is not sanguine of a convic
tion.
Attorney E. A. Meserve, in his closing
argument for the defense, severely scored
ex-County Clerk T. H. Ward, now clerk of
the State Supreme Court. He admitted
that Lowry, who was Ward's chief deputy,
falsified his accounts, but said it was not
done to cover up any theft of his own, but
to shield the head of the office, who was
aware there was a dedcit and was himself
responsible for it.
The only crime Lowry was guilty of was
loyalty to his friend and benefactor, who
was now letting him shoulder the entire
b ame for the misconduct of the office.
Meserve appealed to the jury not to make
a scapegoat of Lowry and punish him for
the misdeeds of others. Ward was the
person most culpable, and if the District
Attorney would perform his whole duty a
complaint would be filed against Ward be
fore night.
Ward's friends are indignant over the
attempt to shoulder the blame on him. A
good deal of feeling has been aroused over
the charees made by the defense. On the
other band, Lowry has many sympa
thizers on account of the good reputation
he has always borne and his general popu
larity. Should Lowry be found guilty the
case will be appealed and a new trial
asked for.
THE SPAXISH GIRL, SHOOTER.
Mai lie Moreno Telia How She Killed the
Chinese Peddler.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., March 12.â The
Chinese vegetable peddler killed in Sepul
veda Canyon last evening was shot (acci
dentally it is claimed) by Mallie Moreno, a
good-louking Spanish girl about 18 years
old.
The story of the shooting, aa told at the
inquest to-day, was to the effect that the
Chinaman, who was on friendly terms
with the girl, complained to her that a boy
had called him bad names. He said he
would kill the boy if he repeated the of
fense and jestingly remarked to the girl,
"And me killee you, too, if you call me
such bad name."
The young woman, pretending to be
frightened at the threat, ran into the
house close by and reappeared with an old
army musket, which she pointed at the
Chinaman and pulled the trigger. She
thought the gun was not loaded, but it
went off and the bullet narrowly missed
the girl's mother, who stood between her
and the Chinaman, and struck the latter
in the right side, killing him almost in
stantly. The girl, who was horrified at her
act, gave herself up to Constable Roberts,
who still has her in custody.
The Coroner's jury returned an open
verdict, although the evidence tended: to
show that the snooting was accidental It
has not yet been decided whether Miss
Moreno will be prosecuted, althought it is
probable a complaint charging murder or
manslaughter will be tiled against her.
MRS. It ALT OX LOSES.
Wanted $20,000 from Capitalist field
for false Imprisonment.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 12.â Mrs.
Mary Jane Dalton. a restaurant-keeper,
has sued W. A. Field, a Los Angeles capi
talist, for $20,000 damages for false impris
onment, because Field caused her arrest
and incarceration in the County Jail for
three days last September on a charge of
petty larceny, which was afterwards dis
missed.
Field made the defense that he bad
"probable" cause for having her locked
up, and a jury in Judge McKinley's court
to-day decided in his favor and awarded
Mary June not a single cent to soothe her
wounded feelings.
Field has a building at Redondo which
he rented to Mrs. Dalton for restaurant
purposes. It had been previously occupied
by a man named Lancaster, who left some
of his furniture there.
Field did not like Mrs. Dalton as a
tenant, and soon ordered her to vacate the
premises. She prepared to do so, but as she
refused to pay some rent alleged to be due,
Field had her belongings attached. She
succeeded in having the goods released,
and then Field had her arrested for petty
larceny, alleging that some tableware
which she had boxed up preparatory to
moving belonged to Lancaster. She lay
in jail three days before her trial which
resulted in acquittal, as she convinced the
justice that the stuff was taken in mistake.
A damage suit followed with the result
stated.
Suit for Attorney's fees.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 12.â
Major Horace Bell, a veteran of the Los
Angeles bar, has brought suit against

ROMANCE FROM SEATTLE
A Cowboy's Reward for a He
roic Deed Performed Many
Years Ago.
How He Saved the Lives of the Wife
and Chid of a Cattle
Baron.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 12.â Seattle
has a romance in connection with James
Buchanan, a Duwamish River fisherman,
formerly a Texas cowboy, which rivals the
strangest tales of fiction.
By the will of a wealthy cattleman o
the Lone Shir State Buchanan, who is now
en route to Texas to claim a legacy, is to
receive $15,000. This bequest was given in
recognition of t fie heroic services of the
ranger many years ago in savint; the wile
and child of the cattleman from drowning
in a Texas river.
They were crossing a bridge which
spanned the stream, some half mile in
length. One section had been swept- out
by the high waters. The woman and child
were driving at a rapid pace toward the
break in the structure, while Buchanan on
his broncho approached from behind at a
breakneck speed, giving warning of the
danger. His cries were' unheeded, and as
8 last resort, when within a reasonable dis
tance the cowboy threw a rope and lassoed
the team in time to prevent the wagon and/
its contents of humanity from pitching
headlong into the raging stream below.
For this service Buchanan was given a
cash reward at the time by the husband
of the woman whose life, with that of her
child, had been saved, and he thought no
more about the matter until he was noti
fied, a few days ago, that he had been still
further reimbursed and to the extent of
115,000.
Tokio, the metropolis of Jar>an, has
a registered population of 1,141,455, inhab
iting 341,(308 houses.

AS STRAIGHT AS A STRING," "AS
â "â  bright as a dollar," "as strong as an
ox," is William Mycroft of 454 Minna
street. In the parlance of his trade he
"slings the hammer,' and right merrily
does the anvil resound as the sparks sput-
ter and rly and the great big beads of
honest toil fall down around and about the
| cheerful, healthful face of William My-
â¢ croft. I saw him yesterday. He stopped
| for a few moments and told me what he
thought of the treat Californian herb rem-
edy, JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPA-
RILLA. He told me how he had been
suffering; from a liver trouble, then pains
in his back, how he kept awake at night,
scratching, scratchingâ always scratching;
how he took a medicine with iodide of
potash; how the scratching became worse;
then he usrd the Californian herb remedy,
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA.
He mended from the first week. He got
better and better, was now weli. He said :
"I am glad I insisted on getting JOY'S
VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA. You
know some druggists always try to make
you take just what you dou't want. When
I went in for my second bottle I had to
talk an hour before I got it. You bet, I
get JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPA-
RILLA when I want a good blood purilier.
See â look at my hands and face. They
are not filled with blood blotches, are they?
Well, they were six weeks ago; that's be-
fore I began to use JOY'S VEGETABLE

the good man beat out on his anvil, JOY'S,

;
Some of the most prominent merchants
and capitalists of the City attended the
quarterly meeting of the Merchants' Asso
ciation at Beethoven Hall last night, the
announcement that the proposed new
charter was to receive important consid
eration having been the drawing card.
Among them were: George T. Gaden,
James D. Phelan, C. F. Crocker, Judge
Coffey, Judge Low, ex-Senator W. J.
Biggy, Chief Sullivan of the Fire Depart
ment, ex-Mayor Pond, George K. Fitch,
Postmaster McCoppin, M. Kohl berg,
Charles Bundschu.
After the meeting was called to order
Secretary Freud read the quarterly report
of the association. This showed the pres
ent membership to be 337, and the hope
was expressed that the number would
soon reach 1000. It referred to the work
of the association in endeavoring to ob
tain better streetcar transfer privileges,
its efforts in the interests of boulevards
and good roads, free public markets, a City
Hall directory and street-sweeping. In
conclusion, the report states that the i
province of the association is to further
the best interests of San Francisco, and
thereby prove Beneficial to the mercantile
community.
Chairman F. W. Dohrmann announced
that the matter of street-sprinkling would
be considered at a special meetine to be
called later, and then introduced the sub- |
ject ol the proposed charter. He spoke, in
] art, as follows: '
The Merchants' Association has been organ
ized to improve the material conditions of San
Francisco and insure its future welfare and
prosperity. Iv our determined efforts to ac- i
complish these objects it soon became ap
parent that no permanent reforms could be !
effecied nor beneficial results fully secured :
until they had become ft part of the .official
system of our municipal government.
The obstacles in the path of improvement
that confronted your board of directors were
owing to the defective system of the City j
government more often than to the short
comings of our public officials. .
Therefore the conclusion was inevitable
that the principal drawback to our City's I
progress is an improved system of municipal '
government, conducted upon lines similar to i
those of any successful business house. Thus !
ii m .that. our.' inquiries were naturally di- i
TtrteJ toward the proposed new charter, with j
a view of if-scervoiuing whether the changes ;
contained In it would work favorably to
municipal improvement. '
I .Careful study of this subject convinced your ;
board that the charter is decidedly superior to \
the existing government of San Francisco. To |
be certain, however, that this conclusion also |
met with the approval and support of our i
members the question of a new charter, to- I
gether with other questions relating to muni
cipal government, were submitted to all the i
members of this association and to a large i
number of our leading citizens and taxpayers.
Answers came from most of those whom we
addressed, and the result showed that 97 per
cent expressed themselves clearly in favor of j
the new charter for San Francisco. Under i
these circumstances we felt justified iv taking i
active steps for obtaining the new charter and
initiating a campaign in favor of its adoption.
In order that the new charter, which is
necessarily a long document, might be placed
properly before the public, a practical synop- |
Bis has been prepared by the secretary of this :
association. This synopsis will be distributed j
hereafter to the citizens and taxpayers of San }
Francisco.
The next step taken by us was to ask the
freeholders to be present here to-night and to
explain to you their views upon this docu
ment.
If this meeting approves of our action and
wishes the board of directors to continue to act
in this direction plans for a- thorough and |
active campaign in favor of the new charter j
will be made- We firmly believe that it is only |
necessary to have the new charter thoroughly !
understood by the electors of this City in order j
to insure its certain adoption.
Joseph Britton, chairman of the Tree- !
holders' convention, referred to the con- i
solidation act and its numerous amend
ments as a simple maÂ«? of unintelligible \
lore, uninterpretable by laymen, lawyer or [
court. "With this proposed charter," he <
continued, "you are given a fixed form of j
government with responsibility fixed some- |
â¢where. I stand in advocacy of the adop- j
tion of the new charter for this reason." 1
I. J. Truman, chairman of the Free- !
holders' committee on legislation, said:
"We are governed, or rather not governed j
at all, by our present consolidation act.
We do not in fact know where we are. If !
yen Were asked under what laws you are '<
.governed you would not be able'to tell. '
The consolidation act has been so twisted
and distorted that its author would not :
be able to recognize it to-day. The new '
charter can ' be divided into three distinct
branches, the legislative, executive and
judicial.
He then explained in detail the salient
features of the legislative branch and con- j
eluded as follows: "If we adopt the j
charter we shall know who is responsible
for our law.-."
Colin M. Boyd. chairman of the commit
tee on finance, revenue and taxation, was
unable to be oresent, but sent a communi
cation on the features of the charter for
which, he is supposed to be responsible.
In thin he said:
In the proposed charter the several appro
priations to be made constitute separate funds, j
and by this means prevent any expenditure I
being made or allowed in excess of the amount
provided for each fund. The unfortunate do
6itlon of the City and County by the consoli
dation of the appropriations in the general
fund resulted in 1893, owing to departments :
expending amounts in excess of their appro. :
T>riations. in an indebtedness of over $200,
--000, which still remains unpaid.
No such condition could exist if the pro
posed charter is adopted, as the limit of ex- i
penditure is bound by and cannot exceed the â 
amount provided in the fund, and no expendi
ture for any purpose other than what the fund j
is created"for can be paid therefrom. Thus j
there is a responsibility fixed and definite, and ;
v protection â  thrown around, guarding said I
funds, which is not now the case. ;
Another important feature is the limit of
taxation, which practically, as heretofore, fixes
the levy at not exceeding $1 on each $100 val
uation of taxable property for City and County
purpose*. it may be presumed, will lead i
This alone, it may be presumed, wll lead :
every owner of a lot or home, and every busi
ness man and merchant, to favor and support
the adoption of the proposed charter as the
only relief and protection from excessive tax- j
ation. - ' ' â¢" â 'â ' , ,
'1 he acquisition of water works, gas and elec
tric lighting plants, street railroads, etc.. are
ell provided for, and citizens will support the
charter who can appreciate the returns for
such enterprise to relieve taxation and in time
make tilt income fromrtheee sources mate
rially reduce it not wholly remove taxation,
except for some special purpose/
There can be no doubt that under the mu
nicipality the ordinary expenses can be largely
met by the revenue derived from these sources.,
Henry N. Clement, chairman of the
committee on judicial department, spoke

ciation.

)f the judicial feature of the charter, and
said the Freeholders found their hands tied
D reference to every court and law officer.
"The Freeholders." he continued, "desired
:o have the Police Judges appointed by
:he Mayor, but even in this matter they
Jound that the Legislature had prescribed
the election of these officials." In
speaking of the consolidation act, he
said it was such a jumble that
the Supreme Court has decided both ways
on nearly every question relative to the
powers conferred by this act. "In the pro
posed new charier,"" he said, "the powers
of the municipal government would be
distinctly divided into legislative, execu
tive and'judicial departments and would
not all be concentrated in the Board of
Supervisors as at present. The present
condition of things invites to corruption.
The politicians have conspired to perpetu
ate this consolidation act.'
He further stated that the proposed new
charter was the embodiment of all that
was good in the fundamental laws of the
most progressive cities in the L nited
States. "It has been pronounced a model
document of its kind," he added, "by men
who hare made Bftth matters a study.
If the Mayor is made a bossbyil we at
least have the power to chose who shall
be oar boss." ...
William P. Gibson spoke on public
schools ami libraries. Be asserted that the
provision that required that teachers in the
public schools must hare been educated in
the public schools of California re;erred
only to teachers of the primary and gram
mar classes, and did not apply to princi
pal- or teachers in special studies. This
clause, he said, was to protect the girls who
were graduated each year from the local
normal schools from those who came from
the E;i>:.
M. H. Hecht said : "We are growing too
big to be any longer governed by Sacra
mento. We do not claim it is perfect, but
every two years yon can offer any amend
ment you like. " One thing has been en
tirely overlooked in speaking of this char
ter to-night. It does away with the super
visorial boundaries. We do not any longer
have to go to the Barbary Coast or Tar
Flat for candidates. We can go where we
please for our municipal legislators."
In the provisions relating to the Fire
Department he said only two important
thines had to be kept in mind. One was
to establish a fully "paid lire department.
and the other was to take the department
out of politics.
Dr. J. A. Anderson said that during the
brief time allotted to him he preferred to
deal with certain attacks upon the
ciiarter, rather than to devote the
time to ttie Health Department,
simply remarking that this department
had been largely copied from the chart) r
of Brooklyn, Nl V.. which latter charter
was about" as perfect an instrument as it
was possible to formulate, and entirely up
to date in every particular. Pasting to tiie
opposition to the new charter he said :
The principal attack? upon the charter were
coining from politicians and socialists â a
rattier unusual combination.
The politicians are opposed to it because
they are not in politic* for their health and, of
course, anything which Interferes with the
spoils lystesa cai's forth their bitterest hatred.
A f-.-w socialists are making an attack upon it
because they claim it does not have certain so
called socialistic principles, such as the initia
tive, the imperative mandate and proportional
representation.
One of these gentlemen in The Call bitterly
denounced the charter because of the difficul
ties whk-h he alleges exists in the way of
municipal ownership of transportation, water,
gaÂ», etc. He doclares that the "associate vil-
i h ; nit-- '' have interposed such obstacles in the
way of obtaining control of these publio utili
ttea tnat It will be next to impossible for the
people ever to obtain them should the charter
be adopted.
This statement is simply misrepresentation
in every particular. In the first place I wrote
those provisions in the charter relating to the
requirements of these public properties, and
certainly I have been a humanitarian ail my
life. lam not rich and not employed in the
interests of the so-called "associate villainies."
Mr. Reynolds Rs^?rts that the three
members of the Board of Public Works
must consent before an estimate can be sub
mitted to the people. If he had read carefully
section 8 of Article VI, he would have discov
ered that it is mandatory upon the Board of
Public Works to prepare such an estimate at
least three montns before every election. They
have no choice in the matter at ail. They
must do this. This disposes of this assertion.
Further than this Mr. Reynold* declares tnat
!iiu> -Supervisors mutt consent befure it can
be submitted to the people. This is true; but
Mr. Reynolds fails to point out the fact that
the Supervisors under the new charter will be
elected at larze and there will not be the pos
sibility to combine in each district upon a.
certain corrupt or it may be weak person and
elect him because of the ignorance of the
voters in every other district as to who he is.
There will be under the new charter such
Boards of Supervisors elected as the charter
uiakers themselves; that is to say, representa
tive and well-known citizens from ali parties
and who can neither be bought nor cajoled.
Certainly Mr. Reynolds would not desire the
question of ownership of properties, involving
th<_- issuing of millions of dollars of bonds,
without the most ordinary business safe
guards thrown about the transaction. Nine
Supervisors will prevent "jobs" in this respect;
whereas, a mere majority would be much
more liable to be bought up than would the
three-fourths required. And in Mr. Reynolds'
further objection that it required two-thirds
ot the citizens of the City to adopt such a
question when submitted to them for their
votes, again, in such a grave matter to prop
erty-holders as the expenditure of millions
upon millions of their money, is it not wise
that the City should practically unite to de
mand them?
The charter, then, does provide in an intel
ligent, reasonable way for the acquirement of
all these public utilities, and with no more
safeguards than any person not a fanatic
would reasonably ask.
As to other points objected to by certain
so-called socialists, we may instance the refer
endum. This is now in actual operation in
this .State, and the charter also carries it Into
execution in the matter of amendments of it
self, and of acquiring the ownership of the
public utilities before alluded to. All of these
things must be referred to the people for final
indorsement.
The imperative mandate again is another
meaningless shibboleth. To remove, let us
sey, the Tax Collector of this City would re
quire a special election and enormous ex
pense, and the annoyance and delay nt-cessary
to such an event would throw the question as
to whether the officer was to be impeached or
not largely in the hands of the "practical poli
ticians." * Impeachment offers an easier,
cheaper and equally good method for remov
ing an offender. Under the charter, however,
the responsible heads of the government may
be removed in a day by the Mayor, so that this
chimera of the "imperative mandate" falls to
the ground.
As for proportional representation that
would be a measure of great usefulness to any
city or State or country that would adopt it,
but, thtinks largely to the efforts of these same
practical politicians, the Board oi Freeholders
mul but seventeen days in which to prepare a
charter, an J it was utterly impossible for any
one to introduce and elaborate it and prac
tically made to carry this into effect in such a
limited time.
In the communication received from J.
J. O'Bri'-n on "Civil Service and Its Prac
tical Application" that gentleman said:
I am heartily in favor of civil service and
would like to see it applied to every branch of
government. It is working with' much suc
cess in the National Government, and I am
sure our municipal offices would be much
more efficiently rilled if the incumbents had
to pass an examination and were certain of
their positions during good behavior.
To best put these principles into practical op
eration the new charter, which 1 had the honor
o* assisting in training, provides that the
Mayor shall appoint three persons devoted to
civil service reform and opposed to the system
of rewarding political parly service by polit
ical appointment, who shall be known "as the
Civil Service Commissioners and who shall
have charge of all examinations of applicants
for municipal positions.
In closing, I would say that the two great
Objections that I have heard urged against
civil service,' both of wl.ich arise from a misun
derstanding of the provisions of the charter,
are. first, that the heads of departments who are
required to give bonds have no control over the
employing of any of their subordinates, but it
will be found that provision is made in all
cases where money is nandled in an office that
tiie head has the appointing of his chief dep
uty and cashier or bookkeeper, and I should
think a n. wly elected head of a department
would consider it an advantage to enter an
otliee and find a trained corps of assistants, in
steid of having to break in a lot of green
hands.
The other objection raised is that in a com
peiitive examination tho>e who could not af
ford h university education would suffer, but
that such :s not the case is cleany known, as it
iÂ« expressly provided that the examination
shall be practical in its character, and any
young person with an ordinary education
should be able to meet all the requirements.
Irving M. Scott, writing of "Public
Works," said:
1 regret exceedingly that I cannot be with
you in r*rson, as I am in spirit, for I look upon
the adoption of this charter as the most im
portant event pending in San Francisco.
A glance at the prominent features of this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
charter will show that the framers had only
the best interests of the City's future upper
most in their minds.
In referring to the Department of Public
Works you will notice that the principle cover
ing its whole constiuetion is based upon get
ting intelligent men familiar with the duties
they are to perform in each department, and
it is so worded as to compel the selection of en
gineers, architects, master builders and super
intendents who are experts in their line, the
lack of which is one of the sources of evil that
we have in the present laws governing the
City.
It also provides for the improvements of the
â¢streets of the City, sweeping, sprinkling, open
ing of new streets, sewerage ana drainage.
Provides also thut the City parks shall bemain
tainejd in proper shape by placing them under
the control of Park Commissioners instead of
having them in the unkept condition they pre
sent at present while sufficient money is used
to put them in first-class shape.
It also provides for the municipal ownership
of water, gas, electricity, telephone and other
valuable franchises now granted free without
any beneficial results to the City, and it pro
vides a complete method for the acquiring of
them, which, while it eives a free expression of
the people on the subject, also guarantees
vested rights from being destroyed inrough
the spite or ill will of any faction.
Gustavo H. Umbsen sent in a paper on
"The Executive Department." In this he
wrote 8S follows:
Under the present system the Mayor, how
ever faithful and efficient, is merely a figure
head, and being without real power is of course
without responsibility for any misconduct in
municipal affairs.
By the proposed new charter he immedi
ately becomes the executive and responsible
thinking head and brains of the city's man
agement and bears the same relation to the
city's affairs that the Governor does to the
State.
An important power given the Mayor Is that
all ordinances or resolutions which maybe
passed by the Board of Supervisors shall be
tir.-t submitted to him for his approval, and
that new resolutions or ordinances shall not
be effective until they receive a three- fourths
vote of the Supervisors over his veto. This is
one of the best points in the new charter.
The following resolutions were then pre
sented and adopted:
Wmkkkas, The present system of government
of San Francisco is obsolete, defective and un
suited to the requirements of a progressive
city; and whereas, a new charter has been
prepared and proposed by a Bftard of
Freehulders, ejected by the people in accord
ance with the constitution of the State of Cali
fornia; and wherens the board of directors of
the Merchants' Associntion has decided upon
a vigorous campaign in favor of the adoption
of the proposed new charter, therefore be it
h'rsohed. That we, the members of the Mer
chants' Association, hereby ratify and indorse
the action of our board of directors in favor
ing the adoption of the new charter for San
Francisco.
}:f<ohtd. That we hereby tender them our
encouragement and support in their deter
mined efforts to Improve the present system of
government of San Francisco; to insure the
ratification of the new charter by the people
at the next election, and its subsequent apÂ»
proval by the Lsgislature of the State.
MR. REYNOLDS' LETTER.
He Declares That Mr. Freuds Did
Not Answer the Objection
Previously Raised.
John M. Reynolds further emphasizes his
views on the proposed new City charter,
claiming that its re-trictions would make
the task of acquiring public gas and water
works more difficult, in the following letter:
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In a
public letter yesterday morning, Mr. J. Rich
ard Freud writes that the interview with me
published in yesterday's Call contained "a
number of mlss'tatemen'ts and fallacies." The

warrant a reply. Let me state, however,
that no personal feelings actuate me, and it is
with sincere respect and goodwill. Although
he says that I have made misstatements, ne
does hot quote one single line. I challen?e
him to do so and to prove me in error. My
claim was that various limitations and restric
tions had been injected into the new charter,
wnich would enable those who now have fran
chises to hold them against the wishes of the
people. 1 pointed to article 11, section 64 ot
chapter 1 ; article VI, chapter 1, section 3; and
article XIV. .section 16, to prove that it re
onlrefl the nflirmfttive vote of all the Board of
Public Works and nine Supervisors before any
question of public ownership can be submitted
to the people. All of the hoard of Public
Wortts must aeree as to values and recommend
propositions before the Board of Supervisors
can act. Moreover, the clause which requires
the Supervisors tv take into account, the exist
ing plants, "if they can be acquired on reasou
abie terms," would enable the present monop
olies to dictate to the Boards of Public Works
and Supervisors, or to appeal to the courts to
enforce claims that they would deem
"reasonable." All of these limitations we
are now free from. Mr. Freiid acknowledges
that it would require a larger vote of the Sup
ervisors than is now necessary. He therefore
admits that point. Will he not also admit that
the Board of Public Works (all of them) must
approve and reiommend the cost and value of
any works? Will he not admit that if one
member of the Board of Public Works had an
exaggerated idea of the value of the Spring
Valley works lie could compel the others to ac
cept his views or obstruct all progress? Mr.
Freud and other advocates of the new charter
have persistently omitted the limitations above
noted in their quotations and huve thus mis
led the public. This seems tome a great wrong
to the public because, confiding in the intelli
gence and honor of an advocate, they would
drp.w conclusions, which, if the whole facts
were stated, might be different.
Mr. Freud quotes article VI, chapter 1, sec
tion 8, which says the estimates of the Board of
Public Works shall be the basis upon winch
may be 'Submitted" to the electors, etc., and
claims that a reasonable construction of these
words are tnat the estimates ''shall be sub
mitted." This is too absurd to be worthy of
comment.
For one to say (as Mr. Freud does) "that the
sincere advocates of municipal ownership are
now confronted with a splendid opportunity
of having their cherished doctrine carried out
in the successful adoption of the new charter,"
when the new charter contains these very
grave and serious obstacles that do not now
exist, is about as reasonable as to infer that
"may be" io the same as "shall be."
The law of 1889 which he refers to does not
contain the limitations of the new charter, ac
cording to his own reference and interpreta
tion of it. Neither does article XI, section 18
of the State Constitution, which he quotes. In
fact, the claim that the new charter is in the
interest of the monopolists is unassailed by
any proof to the contrary. It certainly does
surround the question of public ownership
with numerous restrictions and complications.
Mr. Freud will have to acknowledg this sooner
or later.
It also strikes a blow at the liberality and
grandeur of our school system by denying to
the graduates of eminent universities and in
stitutions outside of our State the right to
teach in our City. All leaders must be edu
cated in the public-school system of this State,
(article VII, chapter 111, section 4. This is un
patriotic and on-American and .shows an nston
lshing narrowness on the part of the Board of
Freeholders.
It also empowers the Board of Supervisors to
sell lands now or hereafter owned i>y said City
not dedicated or reserved for publicuse. How
do our single-tax friend Barry and his asso
ciates like that? It recognizes the contract
and franchise system which has been the
source of corruption in our municipal govern
ments. In fact, it is not a progressive measure,
but a scheme to hold the people of this City in
bondage to the monopolies of the present und
the future. Our friends may have committed
a mistake in taking it up hastily, but we hope
they will be candid and acknowledge the
points that are clearly against the adoption of
the new charter, among which are the limita
tions to public ownersip, whicn Mr. Freud has
not shown do now exist.
A daily paj>erâ not The Callâ in an editorial
to-day avers that it is well that mceased safe
guards are placed in the new charter to pre
vent the people from owning the public utili
ties. That paper evidently is not in touch
with the masses. The people of Lincoln, Po
mona, santa Kosa and Ventura, and
other places in the State during the past year
have decided to own their water service, al
ways by a two-thirds vote. Ventura's vote was
3<>O for to 45 against: Suisun's vote was 147
lor to t> against. .Such votes show how the
people feel upon the subject. Now. the afore
said daily paper would have us believe that
the people should b$ held back by re
strictions which will benefit the corporations
and give tnem a longer lease of license
to tax the peopie. The aforesaid daily paper
says it is well that the new charter requires
that nine Supervisors must be in favor of any
proposition looking toward municipal owner
ship. Yes, it is well for the corporations, one
of which (the S. V. W. Co.) extracted $1,707,
--234 15 last year, on an expenditure (operating
expenses and taxes) of $478,981 56. It is very
nice, for them, to oe able to pocket .f 1,200,000
annually, and the people will thank the afore
said daily pÃper for advocating the new char
ter, which will keep them iroru cutting off this
excessive tax. The people iike to be taxed by
private corporations in whose affairs they have
uo voice. The people like taxation without
representation and *vill increase the aforesaid
paper's subscription list, Decause it is trying
to keep them under the rule of the Spring Val
ley Water Works and other monopolies, by in
ducing them to sanction the greater obstacles
to public ownership tliat are imposed by the 1
new charter. The editor of that other paper,
not The (au,, evidently does not know that
public ovnership has always reduced the cost
to consumers of water and light wherever it
has been tried. He may not know how popular
the subject of public ownership is.
But to return to the subject oi the limita
tions. Note the influence that money and
"vested rights" had upon the Board of Free
holders. The new charter reads that "in mak
ing negotiations (for public utilities) they (the
Board of Supervisors) shall take into
account the acquisition of existing plants
in case the same are desirable and
can be acquired upon terms as reason
able as such works could be procured
by construction." That sounds very reason
able, out it has a sting. It is the last ditch to
which the corporations can retreat and dictate
terms of surrender. The Board of Freeholders
thought the corporation* should oe protected,
of course. The framers of our State constitu
tion protected them by requiring a two-thirds
vote before any debt could be contracted so as
to buy them. The State Legislature thought
the corporations needed more protection, so
they required by the law of 1889 that two
thirds of the Board of Supervisors must vote in
favor of submitting any proposition of this
kind. And now the kindly Board of Free
holders think the corporations need more pro
tection, so they provide in the new charter
that three-fourths of the Supervisors must
favor the affair, and that all the Board of Pub
lic Works must recommend the estimates, and
then, at last, that the existing plants must be
considered. We all know what that means.
Such points clearly show that money and
vested rights had many friends in the Board
of Freeholders, and that the common people
were of secondary consideration. Why, if
those men had any manhood or humanity
why, if they had any patriotism and love of
their countrymen, did they not provide that
the Board of Supervisors must consider the
interests of the unemployed rather than those
who already have too much wealth? At the
time they framed the new charter the unem
ployed were imploring an opportunity to work.
It is the old story, "men are cheaper than
shingles." Let the unemployed starve, but
consider the existing plants. "PlutocrÃcy vs.
Manhood." The charter against the people
will be the war cry this year.

STREETCARS FOR TUCSON
Charles F. Hoff Is Here to Buy
Supplies of Various
Kinds.
He Says Many New Buildings Are
Being Erected â Some Important
Bills for Arizona.
Charles P. Hoff of Tucson, president of
the Arizona Association of Democratic
Clubs and ex-clerk of the Territorial Coun
cil, is at the Occidental.
Mr. Hoff has just received from the city
of Tucson a iVyear franchise for putting
Charles F. Hoff. President of the Arizona Association of Democratic Clubs, Who
Has the Streetcar Franchise for Tucson and Is Here Buying Supplies.
I sketched by a "Call" artist. ]
in a streetcar system, and he is now here
to purchase supplies for it. He says he
will build about six miles of track. It is to
be a horsecar system. Mr. Hoff is already
manager of the telephone system in Tuc
son. He says the facilities are not great
enough. He will add about fifty telephones
to the 100 now in use.
"The fact is Tucson is gaining so stead
ily," he said, "that we have to be up and
doing. About $250,000 worth of new brick
and stone buildings are under way. Thincs
are different from what they used to be.
We have more money in circulation there
now than we have had for twelve or fifteen
years.
"It conies from the mines, farms and
cattle business. This has been a good year
â¢for cattle, and there has been a good deal
of money from this source. We have been
deve loping a good many gold mines, too.
Besides this, we are getting a good deal of
money out of copper.
"We are now trying to get a bill through
Congress empowering us to go in debt to
the extent of $100,000, in order that we can
build sewage and water systems. The way
it is now no town is allowed to go in debt.
Tucson, Phcenix and Prescott are all anx
ious for the passage of this bill. Each of
the others wants the privilege of contract
ing an indedtedness of $100,000 for various
improvements.
â¢â¢Tucson now has about 10,000 people,
Phoenix about 14,000 and Prescott 7000.
They are all pretty active. If we were only
admitted as a State we would have unal
loyed prosperity. If we can't get in as a
State we want home rule, and Delegate N.
0. Murphy, who is in Congress, is going to
try to have a bill passed giving us power
to do many things which are very neces
sary, and which cannot be done under the
existing territorial restrictions.
"By the way, The Call is being read by
almost everybody in the part ot Arizona
where I live. I think the circulation has
increased three oi four times over during
the last few months. You see it far more
than any other California paper."
Mr. iloff will be here probably for a
week.
SUING HER ATTORNEYS.
Mrs. Delia Boretta Claims She Was
Defrauded.
Delia Beretta is suing P. P. Benson and
W. H. Chapman to have set aside a deed
conveying to them some property which
she owned. She hired Benson to bring
suit for a divorce for her against her hus
band. Angelo Beretta. In the meantime
her husband had had her declared incom
petent, and there waÃ more litigation over
an attempt to have her restored to compe
tence. Chapman was hired by Benson,
the plaintiff says, without her authority.
The plaintiff claims she was told by tien
son that there had been a number of ex
pert witnesses necessary to establish her
case, both of divorce and as to her compe
tence, and she was asked to sign a paper
the contents of which she did not know, in
order to settle it. That paper was the deed
she wants set aside.
FERRER BIDS FAREWELL.
His Adieu Take* the Form of a Clasti-
cal Concert.
Richard J. Ferrer gave a concert last
night at Odd Fellows' Hall by way of a
farewell in anticipation of his departure
for Brussels, where he intends to continue
his studies.
He was assisted by the Press Club quar
tet; Miss JÂ«annette Wilcox, the well
known contralto; Frank Coffin, the tenor,
and Mrs. Adele F. Wightman, whose exe
cution on toe guitar is regarded as most
artistic.
The concert was certainly a complete
artistic success.

The extension of the transfer system on
the street railroads is now so nearly com
plete that it is possible to make three, and
in some cases four, changes of route on
the payment of a single fare. The latest
of the lines on which the transfer system
has been introduced are the Forty-second
street, Manhattanville and Bt. Nicholas
avenue road and the crosstown lines on
Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets. The
Canal-street and Grand, Cortland and Des
brossea-street ferry lines, and the line run
ning through One Hundred and Twenty
fifth street to and along Tenth avenue had
already adopted the transfer arrangement.
A conductor riding downtown yesterday
said to a man who was smoking on the
rear platform: "This transfer system is a
godsend to the working people of the far
East side. Some of them nad to go six or
seven miles to work. They had to take
two cars to do it, and 10 cents a day each
way, or $1 20 a week, is a lot of money to
come out of the wages of a poor man.
Now they save just half of that, which
pays a third or fourth of their rent.
'"'ln the summer time it's a great boon to
the poor, as last season showed, when the
Grand and Canal and One Hundred and
Twenty-fifth street transfers were estab
lished, and the open cars and butterflies
| were running. A family of poor toilers
! that are hived together in the filthy tene
ments where God's fresh air never entered
would hoard a Grand-street car at, =<ay,
Attorney street, ride across to the Bowery
!â nearly two miles â then get transferred
to an uptown Third-aveoue car and ride
to One Hundred and Twenty-rifth street.
where they got transferred to the Tenth
avenue cable cars and rode up to Fort
George, in all a distance of more than
fourteen miles. When they reached their
dingy homes afterward they felt as if
they had been on a trip to Europe, and all
for 10 cents both ways. It is the cheapest
ride in the world. '--New York Times.

FRIDAY MARCH IS, 1596
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.: ,
Russia will soon pocket Korea and have
a free hand to reach out for Armenia.
Cleveland has gone duck-shooting again.
Official life with him is only an episode.
The East will have tbe next President of
course, but the great West will name him.
The straighter a funding scheme is for
the railroad the more crooked it is for the
people.
The trouble with Kentucky is that she
can never be dramatic without being melo
dramatic.
Olney may have put the hen of adminis
tration patronage on his little boom egg,
but it won't hatch.
The Commercial Bank of San Jose will
resume at once. It seems that it stopped
only to take breath.
There is nothing shaky beneath Ito-
Kinley's feet in his own State. Ohio this
time is solid for keeps.
Tn solidifying for McKinley the Ohio
Republican Convention came very near
freezing out the Foraker crowd.
Kentucky had better put up her knife.
It is not worth while to carve up three or
four legislators to make one Senator
The Salvation Army will not run two
circuses under one tent, and Ballington
Booth will have to start a side show.
If State Democracy is wise it will steer
between Buckley and Rainey and allow
neither of them to get a hand in the
apple-cart.
As Senator Hoar accused the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations of being
sleepy, he probably jumped on it simply
to wake it up.
It is now reported that big discoveries
of gold have been made in British Colum
bia, and it begins to look as if the world
were full of it.
Between A ilison and McKinley at present
it is nip and tuck with even betting as to
which will be tuck and which will have to
console himself with a nip.
The thing that will grieve Cleveland
most in going out of office will be the loss
of a Government cutter to take him on his
duck-shooting and fishing trips.
In the absence of any other way of get
tins a Presidential candidate the Demo
crats might start a balloting contest at a
nickel a vote and turn the campaign into
a carnival.
The success of the Abyssinians has
stirred up the Dervishes to try to run the
Uritish out of Egypt, and before long
Africa may be carrying the war into
Europe for a change.
The lowa Republicans did well in adopt
ing the record of Senator Allison as a plat
form. There is no stronger one in this
country and it is broad enough for all
Republicans to stand on.
The anarchists of this City who are talk
ing of organizing have evidently overlooked
the fact that organization means harmony,
government and work, and when these are
established anarchy is destroyed.
Senator Hoar says Olney is a "generous,
pquare, honest, clear-headed, old-fashioned
Yankee," and on the strength of that puff
the Olney boom will begin to inflate itself
and sway in the air like a balloon.
"The way out of our misfortunes," says
Congressman Dolliver, "lies in giving
back to the workinemen of the United
States the opportunity to do the work of
the American people." To that doctrine
the whole Republican party says amen.
The action of the Khode Island Demo
cratic convention in adopting a platform
confined to State issues and ignoring
National affairs raises the question
whether there is at this time either a
National Democratic issue or a National
Democratic party.
It is pleasing to note that all California
Representatives in Congress are working
together for the passage of the mineral
land bill. The fight in the Senate is going
to be a hard one, and without unity of ef
fort on the part of Californians there would
be no chance of winning.
According to the latest reports the battle
of Adowa was one of the most destructive
in the annals of modern wars and may
prove decisive of the fate of Central Africa
for the rest of this generation. If Menelek
has sufficient statesmanship to profit by
his victory the independence of Abyssinia
is virtually secure and the white conquest
has reached the limit.
In his speech before the Republican
State Convention of lowa Congressman
Dolliver summed up the issue of the cam
paign tersely and accurately in saying,
"the demand of the hour is for somebody
who understands the everyday business of
the Government of the United Statesâ who
can read the account-books on both sides â
what we take in and what we pay out."
A dyinj* legislator was carried into the
Democratic caucus at Frankfort to give
the pany nomination for Senator to Blacki
burn, another dying legislator called the
pold-money Democrats around him and
urped them to vote against Blackburn,
aud it now looks as if there would be sev
eral other legislators dead or dying in
Kentucky before he ia either elected or de
feated.
INVESTIGATING JAPAN.
No more competent judge of economic?,
especially with reference to the effect of
foreign competition and of tariff laws, can
be found than Robert P. Porter, who is
now in this City on his way to Japan. He
! goes to the land of the chrysanthemum as
an individual student, and the result of
his researches will prove useful for pur
poses of comparison with the report of the
commission which Congress has authorized
the President to appoint for covering the
| same ground. Mr. Porter is an ardent pro
tectionist. It is not to be assumed that
President Cleveland's commission will run
contrary to the free-trade policy of the
administration, and hence Mr. Porter's
1 report will likely command more respectful
â¢ attention than the one which the coruniis
i sion may make. His experience as Super
vising Inspector of the Federal Census and
, as a member of the Tariff Commission
j qualifies him for exceptionally intelligent
! study in that field.
There recently appeared in these columns
a communication calling attention to the
fact that our alarm on the score of cheap
competition with Japan is based merely on
some extravagant boasts of an agent selling
Japanese buttons in San Francisco, and
that the pressure of competition has not
yet been felt. That may be true, but it in
no sense lessens the danger which the
' future holds. The conditions upon which
| the awakened industrial activity of Japan
j rest are the real source of anxiety.
1 Our people have no desire to compete with
manufactured articles produced by skilled
artisans to whom 25 cents a day is a
j munificent Biliary. In this City we have
' now a strike of painters in which one of
| the elements is the employment of Eu
! ropeans at $1 a day. The foundation upon
| which every trades union in this country
I rests is a demand for such wages as will
insure the ordinary necessities and com
forts of lii'e. It is the idea of protection
t brought home and enforced within the
bounds of our own social compact. No
member of a trades union can be consistent
who does not extend to foreign competition
the same principle which he raises against
his own people at home. A protective
j tariff is designed to assure to Americans a
j more geuerous scale of wages, a higher
J standard of living and a freer enjoyment
of individual rights, privileges and freedom
than are possible to the struggling and
poverty-stricken masses of Europe and the
Orient.
The start which Japan has made is
merely an indication of the destructive
rivalry which it will institute against us
unless we suppress the opportunity which
it now enjoys under a Democratic tariff.
It is the right and duty of Americans to
maintain their own standard of living, and
protection is the only means for securing
that end.
A GS.EAT BOULEVABD.
As the widest and handsomest residence
| street in the City Van Ness avenue is en
i titled to special attention. Not only has
; it these points of superiority, but it is
nearly level, extends from Market street
: to the channel, is a necessary link in
the grand chain of boulevards planned for
the City, and is the only one of a width
sunicient for a strip of trees throughout its
center. It is ths improvement that the
Van Ness Avenue Improvement Club is
now urging on the Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors.
The absence of trees in a city whose mild
climate permits of luxurious vegetation is
not a compliment to the taste and sagacity
,of the people. Trees are not planted sim
ply because their shade is not needed.
' Their value for ornamental purposes has
been a? hopelessly disregarded as the op
portunity for cultivating flower gardens of
; surpassing beauty. In the middle of a
1 wide street paved with bituminous reck
trees and flowering shrubs would be an ex
ceedingly pleasant ornament to the City,
and would interfere with no one's comfort
i on the score of excluding sunshine.
The question of expense is the only one
deserving consideration. This', with the
| co-operation of Golden Gate Park, would
] be smaller than in any other city. Sail
Francisco needs more variety, and surely
| no better advertisement of its mild climate
could be devised than the rich verdure and
flowers of semi-tropic regions.
HOAX AND THE CUBANS.
Senator Hoar's plea in the Senate for de
lay before further action on the Cuban
resolutions was a curious performance. It
was of course ably presented, for the Sen
ator is an able man, and yet the very vigor
of his argument served only to exhibit the
more forcibly the inconsistency of the pol
icy he advocated.
The first argument of the Senator was
that the Senate had undertaken to act
without due information concerning the
affairs of Cuba and that it should now
wait until information could be obtained
from the State Department. To this ar
gument he added the further one that the
Senate should not interfere with the func
tions of the State Department, but should
respect the burdens and responsibilities
borne by the executive. He added in con
clusion that all which the Senate has done
so far in the matter has never been seri
onsly intended to help the Cnbans, but
only to make material for use in the ap
proaching Presidential campaign.
Though these arguments were made to
appear strong by the force with which they
were uttered they are essentially weak and
futile. As Senator Sherman pointed
out, the Senate, so far from acting with
out due information, had received from
the State Department a full report of all
correspondence on Cuban matters, and
this document has been before the Senate
for more than two weeks. It is further
more a duty of the Senate to act with the
President on the conduct of such matters
as those under discussion, since the consti
tution expressly provides that it shall do
so.
The issue is one on which the Senate
should certainly decide promptly what
course it intends to pursue. The struggle
in Cuba is rapidly becoming a war of ex
termination. If our mediation is to be of
any use to either combatant it should be
offered at once and strongly enforced.
Delay in such case is of no value to us,
and it means death to Cuba.
OUR DRIED ISUIT TRADE.
Lyiuan R. Wing of Chicago has fur
nished The Call with some information
concerning our marketing of dried fruits
in the East, and it should receive the
most serious attention from growers. The
most valuable of his statements are that
by a fortuitous circumstance, for which
we deserve no special credit â namely, the
failure of the French prune crop â we have
virtually captured the prune market, end
can hold it; that some of our growers have
done all possible to injure the reputation
of the State for producing superior fruits
by crowding inferior products upon the
market, and that many of our growers are
so gulh.ble as to be deceived by the circu
lars of Eastern dealers not of the proper
kind, who make alluring promises, which
it is impossible to fulfill.
This does not mean to say that the ex
cellent fruits which we send out fall short
of tne best that Europe and the Eastern
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALIi, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, ISC6,
States produce, but that the poor fruits
which we ship are offered so cheaply (and,
of course, at a loss to the producer) that
they are readily bought, and serve largely
to establish the reputation of the State for
the quality of its fruit. Considering the
high rates of transportation there is
clearly no greater business folly than send
ing inferior fruits to the East. The grower
will be fortunate if he secures sufficient
from the sale to pay freight.' On the other
hand, good profits almost invariably re
sult from the marketing of prime fruits,
and always 80 when some intelligence is
employed in the selection of a consignee.
As a rule the preparation of our fruits
for the market is altogether out of propor
tion to the natural excellence of the fruit;
in short, much of our gooa fruit is spoiled
in the drying merely through lack of in
telligent attention. In a State of rainless
summers tbere is no excuse for this. The
growers who never complain of the fruit
industry are those who understand the art
of preparing it for market.
Mr. Wing's assertion that much of our
fruit is consigned to improper persons is a
serious matter demanding investigation.
It is the overshrewd grower who is gener
ally hurt by these delusive opportunities.
Those who adhere to the methods of the
organizations made to counteract all the
evils of which Mr. Wing complains are
those who secure the best returns. If
some growers are determined not to take
advantage of the opportunities which
their more intelligent neighbors have se
cured and are offering to all they might at
least take steps to ascertain the reliability
of the commission-houses to which they
ship.
No grower has the right to injure the
fruit business of the entire State by ship
ping inferior goods. It brings him no
profit and injures many others. If be can
not produce good fruit and market it in
telligently he is not made for the business
and should retire.
M'DONALD'S ACQUITTAL.
The prompt acquittal of R. H. McDonald
on another of the charges made against
him in connection with the wrecking of
the Pacific Bank was expected by those
who have watched the cases against Mm.
Meanwhile, the fact remains that the bank
was bandied in such away as to ruin it,
and the fault must be somewhere. The
outcome of the matter emphasizes the
necessity for enforcing the laws which
exist for the protection of those having
business with banks. These laws, besides
being ample in themselves, are re-entorced
by the general criminal statutes, and if
they have been violated in the case of the
Pacific Bank it is somebody's duty either
to enforce them or explain to the public
wherein they have not been violated.
The dosing of the Pacific Bank came at
the beginning of the financial depiession,
and nearly precipitated a run on all the
banks in town. One bank did suffer a run
and others heavy withdrawals, but prompt
co-operation among all these institutions
averted what migbt have been the most
terrible disaster in the history of San Fran
cisco. Meanwhile, the newspapers, fully
aware that there was no occasion for
alarm, threw all their influence into the
breach and helped to save the day.
One of the important duties of the Bank
Commission is to avert such panics by
maintaining a careful watch upon the
banks. Where a Dank is looted outright
and its records faisilied it is often impossi
ble for the Commission to discover the
true state of affairs in time to save the
assets, but in that event the criminal lawa
can be brought into play.
The Pacific Bank failure was the most
scandalous affair of the kind that ever oc
curred in this State. It has been believed
by many that whatever may have been
young McDonald's lack of suspicion or
shrewdness he was less guilty, if guilty at
all, than a number of others whose names
were freely used on the streets and in the
newspapers. The whole story of that re-
niarkable affair has never been published,
and it seems to have a curious faculty for
evading the searching process of the
courts. If the remaining charges against
young McDonald are dismissed he will be
in a position to tell the truth and see that
justice is done. If be does do so and has
the courage to push the matter he may
rely on the entire decent sentiment of the
community for support and sympathy.

but I'll surely be there, and General Howard
will be nominated. I was saying to my friend
Dodge a while ago that Dr. Brown had got so
well known now that he had better turn in
and speak for General Howard. Kverybody
now would come to hear him.
"Some time ago, when I first made the nom
ination of General Howard in a large audi
ence of religious people, Dr. Brown said I
ought to be locked up. But I went right on
with the campaign. I got out a lot of hand
bills after that, and have nuahed the campaign
till now it cannot be enued except by General
Howard's nomination and election.
"I had a vision about this. That's why I
know it is all right. 1 fasted seven days. For
seven days I didn't eat cr drink, and I held
out on the eighth, except to drink. The next
day I broke the fast. During this fast I had a
most wonderful vision, and was told to go
ahead with General Howard's nomination.
"I am going to see his son now, and arrange
for certain details of the campaign." Mr.
Deming meantime sent up his card. After
a while word came down that Mr. Howard was
not in, and the old gentleman withdrew. This
was not, hovever, till he had delivered some
parting words to different people about his cer
tainty of General Howard's nomination.
A SONG OF JUNE.
Jnne, by the sun ! June, by the ruddy rose
That leaus and yields her fragrance to the air;
June, by the drowsy hum
Of golden-belted bees, that go and come,
Draining the sww.s that lurlntr blossoms bear,
From odorous morn till balmy evening's close.
In other climes the blizzard Wares and blows,
The sleety Ice King lays his chilling hand
On mountain, mead and moor;
Through shivering trees the uncurbed north winds
roar,
And mocking March, deriding the spent land,
Flings far and wide his universal snows.
O land of sunshine! Valley of repose,
.My Sauta Clara! Blue your mountain* rise
This blithe and blest March day;
Thy snows are almond blooms, that uo<l und sway
With the warm breath of thy maternal skies.
Upon whose breast the nestling cloudlets cloze.
Jane, each new dawn! June, where tiiy sunset
glows
O'er redwood and madrona, fern nnd vine,
And wlldwood blossomings;
June, where the Rlad thrush from lhÂ« alder sings,
Ami where by banks ana tang.cd eglantine
Th' exulting brook with laughter leups aud flows.
Ye who strive with fierce, elemental foes,
The N.tvu.'i; storui-biasts and the lightning's
dread,
Haste hither, to our June!
Ply hither, where all nature is atune,
And winter, s'ummer-guised, flower-garlanded,
smiles ou the Land of the Hoso! \

cheaper goods to the consumer. During the

at the top to extend well over the shoulder,
forming a shallow yoke in front, to which the

Batiste with cuffs and collar of white linen
makes a very jaunty waist.
The new fabrics for shirt waists show some

are often made up with a plain color which
harmonizes for the cuffs and collar.
Very elaborately embroidered batiste In
natural colors is used, and the result is very

LIVES IN A WATER-TANK.
Thirty years ago Tom Higgins was one of the
best vaqueros in California. He had worked
all ovor the State and was known as a man
capable of doing anything to a steer that could
be done with a lariat and horse. Nothing was
good enough for Tom in those days and he was
just as ready to fight as to eat. .Now he makes
his home in an abandoned water-tank and
earns hts living by catching and selling frogs.
TomÃ last job was on the Lux estate in San
Mateo County, but the cattle business was
An Old Water-Tank Used as a House.
[From a sketch.]
abandoned there many years ago and he found
himself without an occupation. He made sev
eral attempts at other work, but did poorly.
Then he seemed to get discouraged and hung
around the old stables for a long time. At last,
they were torn down and he was without a
home. Then he disappeared for a few years
and at last came back and took up his resi
dence in a water-tank that in the old days
used to furnish water for his horse.
With all his misfortunes Tom is not unhappy
in his strange home. He says it is a comfort
able place and that he makes a fair living, with
little work, from the marsh only a few hun
dred ycrds from his door.
His "house" is located in an isolated spot. It
is not far from South San Francisco, but when
he sits at his door he can only see a blank hill
side in front of him. liy walking to the top of
the hill, however, he can get a magnificent
view of the surrounding country and that
compensates him, he says.
When he first came to the place he found the
ruins of the old windmill tower lying on the
ground ana with them made a very good roof.
Some old tar-paper and rags made it perfectly
watertight. After cutting a door and window
Tom put in a stove, a few cooking utensils and
a bed, and made himself comfortable. He does
not have to do much to make a living as many
days his net will bring him in $5 or $6. That
amount of money will buy provisions aud to
bacco for a long time, so that he can go to the
top of the hill and dream of bygone days.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Tite Ptblic Schoolsâ Subscriber, Chico. One
sect inn of the school law of thin Stale says that
"no publication of a sectarian, partisan or de
nominational character must be used in or
distributed in any school, or be made a part of
any school library; nor muxt any sectarian or
denominational doctrine be taught therein."
The Bible is not used as a textbook in the pub
lic schools of this State.
Nephew and Auntâ J. C. M., Los Angeles,
Crl. The law of this State prohibits the mar
riage of aunt and nephew, but that refers only
to the hue of consanguinity. The wife of a
man's uncle is only that man's aunt by mar
riage, but not by the relationship contem
plated dv the law; therefore there would not
be any objection if both parties were agree
able, to a man marrying his uncle's widow;
that is, from a legal standpoint.
Sleeping-carsâ P. O'D., East Oakland, Cal.
In some of the sleeping cars there are sections
which have double sleeping accommodations,
but as a general thing there are two berths in
one section , one above the other. The berths
are thrown up RgÂ«rinst the side and roof of the
car when not in use, and the car has all the
appearance of an elegantly furnished one.
The rules of the road do noi limit passengers
to the car in which his berth is: the traveler
is allowed to move from one end of the train
to the other, but for sleeping purposes is re
stricted to the berth secured. Cars are graded
into classes by the rates of fare charged, and
*.he accommodations are according to price.
Copyrightâ H. C, City. If A and B write an
opera, one writing the music and the other
tne libretto, each may individually copyright
his work or they may jointly copyright it.
Alter filing the title witn the Librarian of Con
gressand sending on the required fee thera
must be sent to the Librarian two complete
copies of the work within a reasonable time,
if not the copyright is void and a penalty of
$25 attaches. To have a work copyrighted in
any of the foreign countries in thecopyngni
union the work must be printed on the son oi
the country in which copyright is sought, ana
if it is to be issued in several countries besides
the United States the publication must be
simultaneous.
Two Tanksâ C. H. P.. Cornwall, Contra Cost*
County, Cal. If two tanks of different size but
of the same height are filled with water and
each has the same sized outlet the water will
escape from the one as fast as It does from the
other, but if one is built higher than the other
the pressure from tho higher one would be
greater than that from the smaller one. A
column of water 12 inches high exerts a down
ward pressure of .43 of a pound to the square
inch, a column two feet high exerts a pres
sure of about .80, or double that of one ioot.
To find the pressure in pounds per square inch
exerted by a column of water multiply the
height of the column in feet by .43. To find
the head multiply the pressure in pounds per
square inch by 2.31.
Valuable Coins and anonymous Corre
spondentsâg. J., Santa Cruz, Cal. Had you
complied with the rules of this department re
quiring the full name and address of the cor
respondent an answer by mail would have
bec-n sent you, but as you failed to do so, the
information asked cannot be given, for the
season that this department does not advertise
any business or individual. Correspondents
who hide their identity under "Subscriber,"
Constant Reader," "J. G." and the like should
not feel disappointed if their communications
are not noticed. A desire to obtain informa*
tion as to matters the inquirer wishes to be in
formed about is nothing that one need be
ashamed of, and therefore there is no reason
for concealing the name and address. Often ii
happens that the editor of this department
wishes to correspond with a questioner in
order to obtain a clearer idea or what is de*
sired, or to send a reply by mail when tha
question is not one of general public interest.
Desertionâ E. M., Oakland. Cal. The law of
California says that willful desertion is the
voluntary separation of one of the married
parties from the other with intent to desert;
that persistent refusal to have reasonable
matrimonial intercourse as husband and wife,
when health or physical conditions do not
make such refusal rea^onaDly necessary, or the
reiusal of either party to dwell in the same
house with the other, when there is no just
cause for such refusal, is desertion. There is
no limitation for commencing an action for
divorce except when the cause alleged la
adultery and the action is not commenced
within two years after the commission of the
act or after the discovery by the injured party ;
when the cause of action is for felony and
the action is not commenced before the expir
ation of two years after pardon, or the terain
at;on of the period of sentence; in all other
case 3 where there is an unreasonable lapse ol
tinre before the commencement of the action.
Unreasonable lapse of time is such a delay in
commencing an action as establishes the pre*
sumption that there has been a connivance,
collusion, or condonation of the offense, or a
full acquiescence of the same with intent to
continue the marriage relations notwithstand
ing the commission of the offense. A divorce
must not be granted unless the plaintiff hns
been a resident of the State for the period of
six months next preceding the commencment
of the action. The law does not require that
the plaintiff shall have resided six months in
one county of the State beiore commencing
the actibn.

Shirking his taxes is no new trick for Mr.
Huntington. In 1801 he was assessed at some

of poverty and asked reduction. His assess
ment was cut down to something over $6000.
Yet Mr. Huntington under oath before the Sen- j
ate committee said he was worth $1,000,000 at
that time. Which is the lieâ the tale of poverty
in 186il or the million dollars? You are a sad

victims in bed.
The striking painters have met with suc
cess little anticipated a week ago. Their
fight is virtually won, as only a few of the
boss painters have refused to comply with
the demands. So far not a single act of
violence has been ne;ird of.
The Painters' Union started into the
strike with a membership of 750. On the
first day â Mondayâ lso journeymen were
initiated, and to-morrow evening 200 more
will assume the union's obligation.
By Monday morning the union will be
1100 strong. So far as can be learned there
sre not over 150 men at work on the vari
ous contracts in the City.
This is the most correct count of the
painters in San Francisco evpr made.
Very few have come in from the outside
tn take the places of the strikers, and it
more should come their cases will be taken
up by the Building Trades Council, which
last night promised to stand by the strikers
to the number of 10,000.
One of the most prominent master
painters who is holding out is J. St. Denis,
who has the Parrott building contract. He
is making a waiting fight, and it is asserted
that he is waiting for the carpenters o get
through before he makes another attempt
to use non-union men. The carpenters
have threatened to strike if he tuts any
non-union painters to work while they are
in the building.
It is asserted that the superintendent of
the building ha? directed tt. Denis not to
delay the painting work any longer. If
he is forced to comply with such an order,
some change in the situation is likely to
occur very soon.
.business Agent Me Ivor said that he
looked lor the strike to end within a few
days. If by any chance it shou'd
last until April 1 it will involve the
entire building trades, for on that date
the Building Trades Council's card-system
goes into effect, and under that system no
union man can work on a job with any
craftsman who has no card from the coun
cil or the union of his craft. The painters
started the strite with 750 men. Of these
150 continued to work with their bosses,
who agreed to their terms. Since then
nearly all the bosses have given in, and
the men have gone back to work. At the
present time there are about. 350 men out
on a strike out of the 1100 union men.
President Rose says that the full force
is thus on a strike, but only 350 are out.
This is one of the most peculiar situations
that has ever arisen in a trades union
strike.
FALLING INTO LINE.
Bosses and Non-Union Men Accede
to the Strikers' Demands.
The most enthusiastic meeting since the
strike began was held yesterday afternoon
in the Temple. As usual the hall was
filled. The striking painters were in ex
ellent spirits over the success of thoir
committees, who reported from all parts of
the City that the boss painters were giving
in and the non-union men all anxious to
have their names on the union's rolls.
Several reportÂ« vrere made of the big bosses
giving in, which caused loud cheers on the
X>art of the strikers.
Two master painters in particular agree
ing to the union's terms weakened the
opposing force considerably. One was J.
J. Cooney at 141 rourth street and the
other was B. L. Brandt, treasurer of the
Master Painters' Association. The former
has fought the union most bitterly since
the strike began and vowed that he would
not accede to anything except the $3 rate
of wages. The committee labored long
and hard with him. but he remained
obstinate. Yesterday the committee again
visited him and explained the card system
in every detail. Cooney said that he had
not understood what it was before, but
now he regards it as perfectly fair and as
much a protection to the employer as to
the employes.
"Go right ahead, boys. lam with you,"
said he, "and hereafter no man can work
in my shop or on my jobs unless he has a
working card with him."
The committee gave permission for the
union men to return to Cooney's shop.
As stated in yesterday's Gall the City
was laid out in district*, with a committee
of ten men to each district. These men
have visited every boss, job and shop in
the City. The following additional reports
were made:
The chairmen of committees xsos.
1 and 7 reported that i-jpatuon, on
Geary and Mason streets, bad agreed to
recognize the union and accede to all de
mands. Nearly all the ot!:er jobs were
previously accounted for and remain in
the same condition. The reports of
Cooney's and Donovan's s.hops appear in
another part of this issue.
T>lcGavran, also of committee No. 1, re
ported thatW. H. Hamieman of 4_'7 Geary
street liad come to terms, llannenian at
first was willing to pay $3, br.t he ODjected
to the card system." Consequently all of
his men quit work. This caused tbe con
tractor great annoyance, as he had several
big jobs to finish. Yesterday, after tae
system \vas more fully explained, he came
out for the union, and the shop is now all
right.
J. Schoiield of 4 Bergoine place is finish
ing a job on Pacific and Leaven worth
streets. He has acceded to all demands.
Rhodes Bros, of 205 San Jo'-e avenue
Lave in to the card system. All the journey
men on Schaffer's job on Larkin street are
union men.
Upbam has a job at 1265 Vallejo street
on which are two men and a boy. The
foreman sent his application, and the two
nipn will do so as soon as possible.

avenue, favor the demands of the union.
Alexander, whose shop is on Pixley street,
near Union, has a job on Broadway, be
tween Gough ana Iranklin, on which non
union men are working, but the men were
absent when the committeeman called.
W. T. Beck also came into line and
promised ail that was asked. Johnson's
paper-hanger, Kreblau, refused to leave the
pb. At 1113 Broadway the plasterers said
that the painters on the job would have to
join the union or quit work. They agreed
to join. Meyer, at 701 Mission, said he
would give in to the union. J. Chaban of
Polk street agreed to the terms. T. A.
McCarthy, at 015 Natoma street, is willing
to accede to al! terms.
Committee No. 2, Parker chairman, re
ported that the Mission district is all
right, there being but a few small jobs.
Tne majority are tied up or working under
the card system.
Committee No. 3, Willis chairman, re
ported that at 227 Ellis street two men and
a boy are at work. One man sent in his
card. At 90S Ellis, Mrs, Dundberg's
house, the committee found a Chinaman
painting tne front steps, and was doing a
good job. The committee did not know
what to do, so did nothing. Several other
places were visited, but no extensive work
was beins done.
In the district covered by Committee 4
but little business was being dune. All
the bij shops a r e tied up or are working
under the union's rules.
Committee 6, Bohn chairman, reported
that he had been to the Children's Hos
pital. Beckworth agreed to all demands.
Two men on the job will join. Williams,
corner of Devisadero and Pine streets, con
ceded to all demands and will make bis
man join the union. Payne, '2126 Pine
street, also Rave in, and three men ap
plied for cards. Crow of 720 Haight street !
is with the union at all times.
Committee 8, Saurwine chairman, re
ported that James, whose shop is on Golden I
Gate avenue, declined to have anything to !

do with the union. Tom Welsh, 1313 Fell
street, favors the union. J. M Norman,
1034 Folsorn street, also favors the union.
Gerkin of Oakland acceded to all terms.
T. Vorath of 246 Ninth street also gave in
to all demands.
Committee 9, Kerrigan chairman, said
that there is a job at Green and Fill more
streets of which Charles Hoffman is the
boss. The latter said that he is with the
union. On Vallejo and l-'illmore streets
there is a house being painted by Edmun
son, the boat-painter; the men are work
ing eight hours, getting |3 and the boss
recotnizes the can} system. On one of
Hopps' jobs the men get $3, but they de
cline to go out for the card system.
Presidio committee reported having
visited the Government buildings being
painted by Kuss of 422 Sutter street. One
[nan declined to go out; an Oakland man
was also unfavorable; the third man was
undecided. Foreman Olney said that he
would act only under Kuss direction as to
recognising the union. On the whole there
was but little satisfaction obtained from
this job.
The polishers' committee visited the
Parrott building and found two of Kuss'
men at work. One of the men at work
last night walked out and joined the
union. BrusÂ»e, the contractor, is trying
all over the City to get men, but he can
not, as the polishers are standing out
against him and for the Painters' Union.
A large number of reports were made by
the striking painters who had gone out to
do committee work on their own account.
Their reports were in substance as follows:
Antonetti of 205 Powell street said he
would accede to all demands and hereafter
will keep a union shop.
T. J. Cramer & Son, 980 Pine street, also
accedes.
H. H. Inner of 1008 Powell street will
not take any. work until the strike is set
tled; when he will accede to all demands.
Strogen is willing to pay. the wages, but
will not recognize the card system. ... ,
William Armstrong of McAllister street
will hereafter favor the union and its de
mands." :
Burr & Shields on McAllister street are
heartily in favor of the union.
J. Thompson of 2019 Polk street has con- !
ceded to all demands.
W. Roberts of 1873 'â ; Mission street has !
given in to the union's demands.
A letter was received from Gustav Schhee,'

good -wages. ; \,
George Besthorn of 1105 Scott street i
agrees to the union's terms. '
A letter was received from \ Barney Brad- i
ley, 923 ; Mission street, 1 saying j that he la ;
paying $3. He would not agree to the card
.system. â < ''. ' .".A '..-. : ' â '- â  'Â'.'
'B. L. Brandt, treasurer of ; the ' Master
Painters' Association,: sent a note saying
he â  would ; agree t to â  all the demands : and j
wishes the union success.
The report, was : made that the firm of j
Hopps & fond on Pine street, near Kearny, ;
is likely to "Hop" at any time. 1 This idea '
was caused by the fact .that four of Hopps';
old foremen, who have been in the shop
for. many years, and who ; have . always de- r . '
clined to join a union; have sent in their ,
applications for membership. They would j
not have ; done so.it is believed, without i
the consent of their bosses. . !
While the reports were being made, there
was a commotion of enthusiasm : caused by ;
I). Taboas, a ; cornmitteeman, marching
into the hall at the - head of l live Italian j
painters,' who , he : had found at work. ; on j
Rae's -job con 5 Pine and I; Franklin 1 streets/: j
He had explained to them what the union i
proposed to do, and they, at once agreed to I
join .â  in the light. They were accorded ;. a j
hearty reception by the striking painters.
; ; It was announced that the Painters' and
Decorators' Union will hold a special meat
ing to-morrow Saturday evening, to initi
ate between 150 and 200 painters, who have
applied for membership in the union since
the strike began.
The painters will meet again to-day at
the Temple at 3 o'clock.
PROTECTED BY POLICE.
M. J. Donovan Sadly Worried by
His Son, a Striking
Painter.
M. J. Donovan, the boss painter, is
having a lot of trouble with the strikers.
That if, he thinks he is having trouble,
which is just as bad. From the first he
has declared that he would not accede to
any of the union's demands, that he would
pay what he pleased and hire any one he
chose. He would take a non-union man
as readily as a union man.
As has been announced, his union men
left him as soon as the strike was started,
and on the second day the visiting com
mittees induced his non-union men to lay
down their brushes and join the union.
Ever since bis .^hop has been tied up.
More than this, there is a mutiny in Mr.
Donovan's own family. His son James is
a painter, and lie is one of the most en
thusiastic workers in the cause of the
striking painters, being an active member
in the union. James argued with his
father, who enueavored to show the young
man the folly of being a striking union
painter.
Donovan, however, succeeded in getting
some non-union men to work for him, and
yesterday the your.g mun prevailed on
two of the men to strike and joir. the
union. His loyalty to his principles ha?
made him a great favorite with his co
unionists.
Yesterday Donovan was sorely troubled.
He had hired two men from San Jose and
two of this City to finish a contract on
Frank Sullivan's house on Mission street.
a short distance from Sixth, and adjoinine
the building wnere Noonan's furniture
store was partly destroyed by tire recently.
The work had to+ie done, yet the commit
tees were taking the workmen away as fast
as they went to work. At last Donovan
| decided to call upon the police for protec
[ tion. By representing that there was
1 likely to be trouble he secured the services
: of a policeman, who was instructed not to
let any of the committeemen enter the
premises to talk with the workmen. The
; policeman took up his position at the foot
lof the ladder. For ail his vigilance young
] Donovan slipped into the place and took
, out two of the men. Donovan Sr. was wild
i and the policeman greatly annoyed by
; what had happened.
His zeal to prevent the other two men
I from being taken away got the officer
| into a predicament that greatly amused
j the crowd that had assembled on* the street.
i Donovan suspected that two of the strikers
! were on the rooi talking to the workers
] and told the officer ot his suspicions. The
! latter started up the ladders after the
| imaginary strikers, while Donovan jumped
i into his buggy to go to another pinee which
he feared had fallen into the hands of the
j enemy. A minute later several strikers in
i a spirit of mischief concluded to have
i some fun with the arm of the law. The
ladders were removed from the walls and
when the officer returned after a fruitless
search for the supposed strikers he found
that his reireat had been cut off. He
stood on the corner of the roof and called
to those in the street to put the ladders
back in place, but no one moved to obey
the order until after a long wait, when a
friend came to the rescue.
EMPLOYERS TRICKED.
A Practical Joke That Caused Them
Much Annoyance and
Loss.
Buringr the last two days of the strike
the roaster painters who have held out
have been made the victims of Bom>thing
on the order of a practical joke, although
as a fact it was a part of the committee's
work. When it was known that men were
wanted on the "struck jobs" union men
would go to the contractors and ask for
work at the old wages or on easy forms for
that matter. Of course they would be put
to work. Within fifteen minutes the com
mittee would wait upon the working paint
ers and "induce" them to quit work.
The men would tell the employer that
they harl determined to join the union
and had sent in their application cards.
No sooner wire they out of sight than
another batch of applicant? lor work would
bfl on hand and they, too, would be in
duced to walk out. Occasionally a non
union man or two would get in with these
dummies and in nine cases out of ten they
would be carried into the union
before they knew it. though at
first intending to taKe the strikers' places.
In this way many recruits were carried
into the ranks and made good union men.
On some of the jobs four to eight vanes of
dummies struck and "joined the union,"
uniil the employers come to the conclusion
that the onion's committees were carrying
everything with them and that there was
nothing to do bat to give in.
This little piece of trickery has caused
the contractors not only annoyance, but
some loss. Many of their contracts were
fairly started and the buildings liberally
daubed with paint before the workmen
would be "induced" by the committees to
leave. At the present time there are a
dozen houses around town that have the
appearance of a half-shaved face â part
clean and part lather. The bosses tried
hard to protect themselves against this
trick, but a large number were caught.
ST. DENIS' PAYROLL.
Affidavit by Master Painters Who
Examined His Books.
There has been some controversy rela
tive to the amount of wagei J. St. Denis
& Co. have paid their painters at work on
the various contracts. Several members of
the Master Painters' Association have
made an examination of his books and
submit the following affidavit as the result
of their investigation :

LATHERS' STRIKE WON.
All the Employers Have Given In to
the Journeymen's De
mands.
The Lathers' Protective Union has won
its strike. Tiie men went out on a strike a
little over ten days ago for an increase of
wages and tied up nearly every lathing
contract in town, there being less than a
dozen lathers who are not members of the
union. Their demand was for an increase
of from 75 cents to $2 a thousand, and for
6 cents instead of 2 cents a yard for iron
lathing, and ei^ht hours a day.
Reports were made last evening by the
niembvrs that all the master lathers ex
cept two had acceeded to the demands.
One is C. Morehor.se, whose contract is on
Post and Larkin streets, and the other is
William W;itson, who nas a contract on
Fourth street. At both of these places
there lias been trouble, caused by union
men taking the places of otlu-r union men.
All of the other employers having ac
ceded to the demands the men have returned
to their work, \\hile the right has been
virtually won, the stride has not been de
clared off, nor will it be until the last mas
ter lather has acceded to the demands.
At present the lathers are not working
under the card system, as the Building
Tradns Council, of which the union is a
member, has not issued its cards and will
not until April 1. Then the lathers will
demand a recognition of the card.
Whether this will cause more trouble re
mains to be seen. ' At any rate the lathers
will be supported by the entire Building
Trades L'ouncii.
C. A. MARS' CONDITION.
His Family Say He Is Dyingâ Others
Say That He Is All
Right.
Several of the prominent members of
the Lathers' Union are much annoyed by
the statement made relative to the Post and
the Fourth street troubles. They claim that
the siories told by the injured parties are
Badly exaggerated in regard to the troubles
and the condition of the men. Or.c man
claimed that yesterday morning he met
Charles Mars on Montgomery street, ytt
the report is that Mars is in bed in a dying
condition from the injuries received in the
fight. The president ol" the union sent a
pliyaican to see young Peter Trade?, also
reported to be in a serious condition.
The members say that the physician
was refused permission to sec Trades, and
they openly proclaim that the two men
are feigning illn<ss in order tÂ£. keen the
men wno are charged with the assaults in
jail as long as possible. The Building
Trades Council have promised to take up
the matter in behalf of the prisoners, who
the delegates say are being unjustly and
unfairly prosecuted.
C. A. Mars, who was reported as being
seriously injured in the right with the
striking lathers, was reported by his family
to be in a dying condition last night.
They said that the, physician who had
been called to attend him had said from
the-lirst that there was no hope for him.
He was said to be suffering terribly and
admittance to his room was denied.
I'etor Trade, the other lather, was better
last bittht, according to the statement of
his mother. She said that paralysis from
the injury to his head had at first been
feared, but that the physician in attendance
had pronounced him out of danger.
".Mr. Mars' condition is very low," said
Dr. Cachot. who is attending the injured
man, last evening, "and it is almost cer
tain that he will succumb within the next
few days.
"He received a severe blow with some
blunt instrument behind the left ear
which has produced congestion of the
b:ain and partiaL paralysis of the left side.
His skull was not fractured, as was at first
supposed, but nevertheless there is but one
chance in a hundred that his injuries will
prove other than fatal."
LATHERS IN COURT.
Those Out on Bonds Are Ordered
Into Custody by Judge
Low.
Daniel Dunn, William Totes, Thomas
Devilliers and James Holmes, striking
lathers, appeared in Judge Low's court
yesterday morning to answer the charge
of assault to murder. The cases were con
tinued till Tuesday and the Judge ordered
Holmes and Devilliera, who were out on
bonds, into custody, as it was stated that
Peter Trade, one of the men assaulted, was
in a serious condition. Attorney Walter
Gallagher, who appeared for "the de
fendants, did not offer any objection.
D. J. McÃea and J. L. Peon, known as
"Oakland Jack," were arrested yesterday,
the complaining witnesses being respec
tively Walter Trade and Joseph Trade.
William Patee was al?o arrested yesterday
and Daniel Durn and James Holmes had
each an additional c arge placed against
him, trie complaining witness against the
three being (J. F. Mars.
C. F. Mars also swore out several more
warrants in Judge .Toachim.sen's court yes
terday. It was reported that his father
was dying from the injuries he received on
Tuesday afternoon at the hands of the
strikers*.
UPHOLDS THE STRIKERS.
Building Trades Council Will
Stand by Painters and
Lathers.
The Building Trades Council, repre
senting unions whose membership
amounts to 4000, met last evening. Dele
gate tk'Uthwick of the Lathers and Dele
gate Rose of the Painters and Decorators
made reports respecting the strikes of their
respective unions
A resolution was passed by the council
indorsing both strikes, and promising all
the support, that could be given.
Permission was gbrtu the members of
any union to cease work and strike if an
attempt was made to force theui to work
on a jot> with non-union men, trying to
fill the places of strikers.
The Lathers' and Painters' unions and
Carpenters' unions 22 and 483 indorsed the
council's by-laws and constitution, and inÂ»
dorsed the proposition of holding monthly
mass-meeting*.
A committee consisting of McCartney,
Zant and M elver was selected to wait
upon the City Uall Commissioners und ,
the Supervisors, and impress upon them
the necessity of complying with the law
which requires that eight hours shall con
stitute a day's work on all City jobs and
that none but union men shall be em
ployed.
It was decided that the council's work
ing-card system shall go into effect April 1.
I)ei(ga!e McCarthy of Carpenters' Union
No. 22 brought up the matter of the coun
cil helping the lathers who were arrested
out oi" their troubles.
He said that he was satisfied that th
complaints were exaggerations trumped
up by those who wanted to injure the
cause of the striker-. The lathers' dele
eates snid that the whole affair would be
exploited soon, and that the Lathers'
Union was looking after its members.
It was decided to hold a mass-meeting of
all the building trades on the evening of
March 31. The meeting will be held for
the pntppse of educating the laboring men
on the principles of unionism, and espe
cially the worKing-card system. Delegates
McCarthy, McAvoy and "O'Brien will take
charge of the arrangements for the meet
ing.
Labor Convention.
The labor convention will meet next
Sunday at 1159 Mission street, and hear
and discuss tne report of the organizing
committee. All of the unions will be pres
ent, as the meetine will be important.
The glaziers of this City are about to
form a traces union. At this evening's
meeting of the Trades Council the orean
izing committee will De asked by one of
the glaziers to organize the craft into a
union.
THEY ARE ANARCHISTS.
Five Score of Italians Enroll in Pietro
Gorl's Club.
Pietro Gori was heard again last night
in Apollo Hall, on Pacific street, by a
couple of hundred Italians. He expounded
hi? pet theme of anarchism with a view to
forming an organization in this City as a
branch of the Socialistic-anarchistic Fed
eration of Laborers in North America.
Mrs. B. Gaffe, the socialist, introduced
the s'ar of (he evening and asked that the
audience listen closely to his utterances
and abide by them.
Gori, in making his dec'arafion of prin
ciples, stated that all laborers were sub
jected to two forms of tyranny â one
financial and the other political.' The
financial phase came from the fact, as he
declared, that although the laborers pro
duced everything, they were swindled out of
the benefits of their labor by thecapita.ists
who owned the farms, mines and machin
ery of the country. As a result, those
who produced riches remained poor and
those who did nothing were rich.
"The political form of tyranny," said
Mr. Gori, "is but a phase ot the iinan.ial
one, because, with trie excuse of order and
the respect of law which is demanded by
the majority, governments fortify them
selves behind the judiciary, the police and
their armies. These, by fraua or other
means, are always made subservient to
capital."
At the close of the meeting nearly one
hundred men signed the roll.
A VISITOR FEOM PITTSBURG.
Police Captain Brophy of That City Is
Much Taken With San Francisco.
R. A. Brophy, a captain of police of
Pittsburg, Pa., who is makine a tour of
the principal cities of the West, arrived in
this City a few days ago, and has been do
ing the town under the guidance of Detec
| tive Cody. Since leaving Pittsburg Cap
| tain Brophy has visited Chicago, Denver,
j Salt Lake City and a number of otber
i cities, but in an interview yesterday with
j a Call reporter he* admitted that San
Francisco pleased him more than any
city he had yet visited. He is enthusias
tic in the praise of our police department,
I and said that he ha i visited the principal
; cities of the East, also of Europe, and in all
the places he has visited the captain said
that he never found a better organized nor
more capable police force. Of course, the
delightful weather and the climate came
in for warm commendation on Captain
Brophy's part. Another feature of the
City aoout which the gentleman spoke in
the nost enthusiastic terms was the clean
liness of the streets. He said that he never
saw as clean streets in any city in the coun
try that he had ever visited, and was so
impressed with the character of the work
that he inquired if it was done by the City
or by contract. On being informed that
the street-cleaning was done by the City
Street Improvement Company, he said that
they deserved unstinted praise forthe care
ful and painstaking manner in which they
did the work and keut the streets free from
dirt.
This commendation of the gentleman in
question in regard to the cleanliness of
the streets of this City is quit" in keeping
with that of all strangers vi- j here.
With regard to the same i er Nathan
Dohrmann, president of tue Manufac
turers' Association, was heard to say a few
days ago that the manner in which the
City Street Improvement Company cleaned
the streets was very satisfactory to the
association, and that as soon as a reform
could be effected in the manner in which
the streets are sprinkled there would
be little left to be desired in retard to
clean streets in this City.
The Fire Department.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday after
noon and accepted the resignations of John
Sullivan of Engine 27 and Frank McDonald of

BROWN'S TRIAL
NEARLY ENDED
All the Evidence Is Now in
Possession of the
Council.
WANT A VERDICT TO-DAY
Charges of Intimidation Strongly
Supported by New Wit
nesses.
DR. BROWN AND A YOUNG GIRL.
Incident of Long Ago Recalled by Her
Vote Against the Pastor
Recently.
The case for and against Dr. Brown
closed last night.
Every vestige of evidence of a substan
tial character which could be brought
against the accused man has been listened
to and carefully sifted by the represen ta
tives of the Congregational churches.
With equal fairness they have heard the
testimony offered by Dr. Brown, until now
his ecclesiastical brethren are in a position
to determine the truth or falsity of the
grave accusations.
No man can forecast the verdict, but
there is a prevailing opinion that it will be
nothing worse than unministerial conduct.
The scope of such a verdict will be gov
erned entirely by its wording.
The afternoon session of the council
was confined almost entirely to the intro
duction of eviuence relative to Dr. Brown's
attitude toward Mrs. Davidson following
the payment of $500 tiush money.
Deacons Hatch and Barnard were confi
dent that Dr. Brown had called on Mrs.
Davidson between the 4th and ISth of De
cember to speak at the Wednesday night
prayer meeting. Mrs. Evans and Deacon
Dewing were equally confident that if
.Mrs. Davidson had taken part in the ex
ercises she had done so voluntarily.
The evening session was devoted to hear
ing the testimony relating to the alleged
intimidation.
The council will meet this morning at
10:30, and at 11 o'clock Pastor Brown is
expected to make his concluding argu
ment.
POINTED TESTIMONY.
Deacon Hatch Swore That Dr.
Brown Asked Mrs. David-
â¢ son to Pray.
There was the usual crov;d of curious
church people in the dark, damp and
dingy basement of the church at the after
noon session.
Whiie waiting for the council to make
its appearance the crowd read The Call
and chatted and gossiped. Then, as the
hour of 2 drew near, they moved their
chairs closer to the Dlatform and prepared
themselves for the enjoyment of the usual
matinee as Sexton Pike lighted the gas
and caused the cellar microbes to scurry
to the dark corners of the room.
A group of young women not far from
the platform were gicgling over the re
cital of one of Miss Hattie Cooper's bon
mots. The story, as told by tho pretty girl
to whom Miss Cooper narrated it, was to
the effect that when she called upon Mrs.
Gordon of the Cnristian Co-operative So
ciety for certain information respecting
the church scandal Mrs. Gordon was at
first inclined to wash her hands of the
whole matter. Finally she said, with a
sincerity and solemnity almost ludicrous,
as she pointed to the portrait of a lady
friend hanging on the wall, "That girl's
mother sent her up here from Fresno for
me to take charge of her. What if 1 let
her go up to that there church to one of
them prayer-meetings â where would she
be now?"
Dr. Hoyt opened the proceedings by an
nouncing that Mr. Bickford had. brought
to the council the five-gallon coal oil can
and the vaiise in which he found theOver
man-Tunnell letters. Some of the letters
were addressed to Mrs. Tunnell under the
name of Fowler.
This is a corroboration of the fact an
nounced in a recent dispatch to the effect
that Mrs. Tunnell was in the Mexican
town of Ensenada. in Lower California,
under the name of Fowler.
The first witness of the afternoon was
Dr. Rae. He was asked as to the selection
of the choir for the Smith revival meet
ings in January and February. He told
about Mrs. Brown saying to him that if he
asked Mrs. Stockton to come upon the
platform Mrs. Brown and others would re
fuse to go there. Mrs. Brown gave no
leason for her request. She did not say
that she did not like Mrs. Stocktou's voice",
and she did not object to any one else.
It will be remembered that Mrs. Brown
testified that sne had objected to Dr. Rae's
selecting Mrs. Stockton as one of the cho
rus, because Mrs. Brown did not Jike Mrs.
Stockton's voice, and also that she (Mrs.
Brown) had objected to the selection of
others at the same time. The witness,
Rae, was positive that Mrs. Brown did not
object to any others.
Dr. Brown took Dr. Rae by the hand as
he was leaving the platform and greeted
him with, "God bless you, brother." Then
Pr. Brown turned f .o "some sympathizing
women sitting behind him and remarked
in a loud voice:
"That's the kind of witnesses we put
on. 1 '
Deacon Morse laid his hand on Dr.
Brown's shoulder and quieted him, and
Attorney Nagle sighed resignedly.
W. A. S. Nicholson, attorney at law, told
about the visit of Bickford to his ortice
with a proposition to sell the Overman-
Tunnell letters to Dr. Brown or his coun
f-el for $1000, and how he (Nicholson) in
dignantly spurned the proposition.
Some dispute arose at this point as to
whether Biekford's partner was named
Dowling or Darling, and the witness set
tled the matter by remarking that the
ladies called him "Darling," while the
men called him "Dowiing."
The moderator announced that it was in
evidence that Mrs. Tunnell had handed
BicJflord the valise containing trie letters
to keep for her, and that therefore Bick
ford could not have been guilty of bur
glary.
The witness said he would not believe
the testimony of any man who would do as
Bickfortl had clone.
Deacon Theodore Hatch, a mild-man
fcered. grizzly little man with short bean!
kin! an intellectual looking forehead, was
t tiled to the stand for the purpose of telling
ihout Mrs Davidson's presence at pxavex
meetings and her participation therein.
He was asked whether he remembered Mrs.
Davidson to have led in grayer or to bave
tnade any remarks by request of Dr. Brown,
md he .said that he did. It was in Decem
ber, about the middle of that month. Dr.
lirown said : "We are always glad to hear
from our sister Davidson." Ihe Witness'
oiemory was refreshed by the fact of her
irrest, and then he remembered back at
Hiit time that Dr. Brown had asked bister
Davidson to say something..
The importance of this testimony lies in
the fact that Dr. Brown paid Mrs. David
son $.500 in November, nearly a month
before he called upon Mrs. Davidson at the
prayer meeting as Sister Davidson.
The witness, on the cross-examination,
expressed himself as certain about the
date and about the fact that Dr. Brown
invited her by name to pray or make some
remarks. As near as he could remember
this happened on Wednesday, December
IS. He believed also that Mrs. Davidson
spoke and prayed at the meeting of De
cember 11. The witness was positive that
Dr. Brown called upon her by name, and
the cross-examination by Mr. Nagle failed
to shake him.
Dr. Brown took up the witness where
Mr. Nagle had dropped him and asked:
"Are you aware that five persons have
already testified before this council that I
not only did not call upon Mrs. Davidson
but that there was a positive look of dis
gust on mv face when she arose?"
The witness replied that he was not
present when that testimony was given.
Dr. Brown assured him that such was the
fact, but Deacon Hatch persisted in his
statement that he was confident that Dr.
Brown called upon Mrs. Davidson to
speak.
Deacon Dewing came next, and testified
that Mrs. Davidson took part in the
prayer-meetings during the month of
December at least once, but that he could
not remember that Dr. Brown called upon
her.
In reply to a question by Judge Advo
cate Woodhams, the witness replied that
he did not know of Dr. Brown having re
ceived a call to an Eastern church in the
latter part of November.
Dr. Brown, with an air of alertness, arose
to his feet and asked the judge advocate
what was the purport of the question
about the call to the Eastern church. Mr.
Woodhams replied that hÂ«? wanted to
know why Mrs. Davidson knew that he
had had a call to another church when the
deacons of the church did not know it.
Deacon Morse, Dr. Brown's right-hand
friend, took the witness-chair and told the
council that Dr. Brown had informed him
last November that he had the expectancy
of a call to a church ;n Philadelphia and
to another in Brooklyn, N. Y. Dr. Brown
had expressed himself in favor of accept
ins the call should it come.
Dr. Brown explained to the council that
Mrs. Davidson had only guessed about the
call from certain remarks that had been
dropped by him.
Mrs. Evans, an elderly woman, testified
that she was sitting in front of Mrs.
Davidson on the night of Wednesday,
December 18. and she remembered dis
tinctly that Dr. Brown neither asked Mrs.
Davidson to pray, nor commended her
after she had finished. It was this unusual
omission on the part of Dr. Brown that
attracted her attention to the fact that
Mrs. Davidson had not been asked on that
occasion. She added :
"When my daughter read the news
about Mrs. Davidson's arrest she said to
me 'That explains tee reason why Dr.
Brov/H had such a look of disgust on his
face that night when Mrs. Davidson was
speaking.' "
Deacon Barnard was recalled and swore
that Dr. Brown called upon Mrs. David
son on the evenings of the 11th and 18th
of December. On the last-named evening
the subject of Mrs. Davidson's remarks
was "Prophecy."
"You feel so sure, that the testimony of
othors to the contrary does not make you
waver in your belief?" asked Dr. Tenney.
"Yes. sir; I am positive that Dr. Brown
called upon her by name. On the evening
of the 18th of December she read some
thing out of the Bible."
"Are you as positive that he called on
her on the evening of the 11th as you are
that he called on her on the 18th," asked
Mr. Nagle.
"Yes; sir."
"Suppose it should turn out that she was
not here on the 11th, but that she was at
tending a meeting somewhere else?"
"If she was not there," replied Deacon
Barnard, "I would be mistaken."
Judt;e Advocate Wood hams asked Dr.
Brown as to the names of the witnesses
who had testified that Mrs. Davidson wa*
absent on the evening of the 11th of De
cember. Dr. Brown replied that he be
lieved that Miss Overman had so testified,
whereupon the faces of a majority of the
members of the council were overspread
with a smile like unto that with which
Bret Harte's heathen Chinee sat down to
the historic poker game.
The Judge Advocate read from a morn
ing paper copies of letters written by
Miss Overman to Mrs. Davidson, in which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 189(5.
1 letters Miss Overman speaks most fer
i vently of her friendship for Mrs. David
\ son. She also refers to Dr. Brown and
I to religious matters.
In the letter of February 20 Miss Over
' man asked: "What do you mean by say
i ing that Mrs. Brown seemed different at
' prayer-meeting? Did you mean differ
ent from herself usually or different from
the doctor?"
In the letter of March 17 she announced
i that Mrs. Tunnell was then on the way to
: visit her, and that she (Mattie) would en
; joy her visit very much. She also spoke
; of her belief that Dr. Brown was like a
I chosen vessel of the Lord. It was full of
< pious expressions, as were all the letters,
ami was signed "Yours, in Christ, Mattie."
In the succeeding letter Miss Overman
crows facetious over the tilt between Dr.
i Brown and Dr. Herron and remarks:
"The future smacks of herring (Herron)
not dried nor fried, but rather pickled for
â  use."
Among the letters was one'dated July 3,
j which Mr- Woodhams explained was one
I of the five which she had rewritten and
I changed. By request of Mr. Nagle. Mr.
I Woodhams read the preceding letter â
that of June 12, and the succeeding
one â that of July 10, for the purpose of
! showing the lack of harmony between
j them and that of July 3.
In the letter of July 3 Miss Overman an
nounces her intention of starting for San
Francisco within eight days. She adds:
"I am sure of a welcome from one at any
rate, dear (yourself). If I am making a
mistake 1 cannot suffer any more, but this
seems the only way for an advantageous
future and, perhaps, for a lesson to one
whom we know."
In the next letter, under date of July 10,
the writer says that she could not start for
San Francisco because she had not suc
ceeded in getting some money that she
expected.
In response to a question by the modera
tor, Mr. Woodhams explained that tho
letters had been given to him by the edi
tor of a morning newspaper.
There being "no further witnesses, the
council adjourned until 7p. m. for private
session.
THREATS OF SCANDAL.
Serious Charges Against Dr. Brown
Investigated Last
Niffht.
Only the favored fewâ the electâ such as
the defendant and witnesses on both sides,
were admitted to the council chamber
last night. It was a session from which
the public were excluded, ' but the
newspaper reporters were admitted
upon their pledging themselves not
to make public the names of
certain witnesses who were expected to
testify before the council. Half a loaf of
dry bread being better, than no sandwich,
the reporters took the pledge.
Rev. Mr. Vrecland, with much fervor,
opened the session with prayer, which was,
in substance, as follows:
We have prayed day and night, and our
hearts have gone out unto thee. Our thoughts
have been busy in all this tortuous matter,
and we pray again to-night for the light which
Thou canst give, the light of truth and love
and vindication and clearness, the light of
pureness and of innocence which shall ghiue
as from thy tace upon all those tilings.
We pray for clearness of thought, for ear
nestness of spirit, for strength and wisdom of
mind. We pray that those interests which
center here may be such, and their outcome
such, that here shall be clearness, praise to
thy name, gratitude of heart and new life for
this church and its pastor.
Dr. Brown responded "Amen!" with
great unction, and the decks having
thus been cleared for action the mod
erator announced that the council was
ready to take up the charge preferred by a
member of the church that Dr. Brown had
attempted to intimidate a young woman
member of the church to prevent her
from voting or acting against him.
The person preferring the charge named
his own condition as to the terms upon
which the witnesses would appear and
testify. They were that no one should be
present save the witnesses who were to be
examined upon that matter, the council,
one deacon to represent the church and
the newspaper reporters, who hart pledged
themselves as a condition precedent to
their being permitted to remain that they
would not publish the names of any of the
witnesses.
Deacon Morne requested that he be per
mitted to remain, but the young man pre
ferring the charges would not consent, as
he had already consented to Deacon
Vasconcellos remaining to represent
the deacons. i)eaoon Morse made a
touching plea, that is, it would
have been touching if it had touched
the right spot. He said: "The vounx
Jadv who is to appear on this stand is as
dear to me as my own daughter. She is
my righthand man, so to speak, in the
Sunday-school, and God knows I don't
wish to intimidate her by my presence,
and rather than have any discussion about
the matter I will retire."
Having thus metaphorically attired the
prosecuting witness in bloomers, Deacon
Morse, with a very dignified air, walked
forth into the outer darkness.
Then the judge-advocate remarked that
the person bringing the charges objected
to Lawyer Nagle remaining in the room.
Mr. Nagle rose, blushing with surprise.
"If you are willing, 1 ' he remarked, more in
sarcasm than in sorrow,"'that I should go
out and deprive Dr. Brown of the advice of
his counsel in this investigation, I shall do
so. I wish yon had told me this three
days ago, and you could have run this
thing yourself."
Mr. Nagle had bis hat in his hand and
was showing up a fine front as he almost
stumbled over Valley Brown, who was sit
ting under the piano, with his feet occupy
ing the path leading to the door.
Moderator McLean with a good-humored
smile remarked: "In that event the council
would have been happier."
"Perhaps they would," retorted Mr.
Nagle, defiantly* "and a good many more
peop!e would have b-en happier."
With this doxology Mr. Nagle melted
away into the unknown, but he did not
slam the door as Deacon Morse did.
The episode seemed to have put Dr.
Brown in good humor. He actually smiled
as his attorney went, leaving nim that
most helpless of beings in the eye of the
law â an orphan ad litero.
The young woman who had the griev
ance against Dr. Brown was sworn, and
read her statement from manuscript. Her
story was to the effect that on Sunday
afternoon, February 9, of this year, she
arrived at the church shortly before the
opening of her Sunday-school class. Dr.
Brown asked her for a private conversa
tion, and called his wife to be a witness to
it. Dr. Brown began by asking the young
woman whether she remembered coming
out of the big organ of the church
on a certain afternoon with the
.organ-repairer a year and a ' half
before that time. The statement at this
point went on to explain that on Saturday
afternoon, eighteen months before, while
Sexton Stevenson was in the church,
and while she was waiting for the
coming of several young ladies
engaged in decorating the church,
she inspected the interior of the
big organ with the organ repairer. While
so en^'aged Dr. Brown came in, and she
waved her hand at him between the pipes
and asked him if he could see her. He
replied yes. She remained in the organ
inspecting its various parta about fifteen
minutes, and that was all that happened
at that time.
Returning to the conversation with Dr.
and Mrs. Brown, the statement went on to
say that Dr. Brown recalled this circum
stance to the witness and announced that
he was in his study while she and the organ- i
repairer, a man of middle age and I
above reproach, were examining the organ.
He, Dr. Brown heard them talking for five
minutes, and that then there was silence
for about ten minutes. He said : "I have
told nobody but Mrs. Brown. Now, if
this thing should get into the newspapers
it would ruin you. ' r He then went on to
tell her that he had never been
seen coming from any lodging-house
with any woman, and that the witness nad I
no right to accuse him. The witness
asked, in surprise, as to what way she had
accused him, and he said that she had
done so by her action in voting against
him. He said: "I shall not give this to
the press, but should it come out your
character would never be clear."
She repeated this conversation to her
mother and to several of her friends and
jotted down on the same day her recollec- I
tion of it. A young gentleman friend of
hers called upon the doctor for an explana
tion, but the doctor brushed him oft with
the remark that it was not any of the
young man's affair.
On the Monday morning following she
and her mother called upon the doctor at
his residence for an explanation, and the
doctor repeated his observations, and
added that he did not even suspect that
the young lady harbored a thought of
wrong. When the mother of witness asked
! Dr. Brown on that occasion what he had
j against her daughter, he replied by asking
i what she would have thougnt had Bhe
j seen him and Miss Overman coming from
i the trapdoor of the organ. He then re
j peated the organ incident. Dr. Brown
j added in that interview, referring to the
I witness, "If she stabs me auain I snail not
â  keep quiet any longer." He insisted that
i her action would defeat his case in the
courts.
The witness asked in her statement why
had not Dr. Brown brought the matter up
eighteen months before, and why he
should have broached the matter just after
she had voted against him ?
One of the members of the council an
nounced that the witness was his niece,
j and for that reason he would request that
i he be excused from voting or lairing any
! other active part in the matter.
His reuuest was granted.
In answer to questions by Dr. Tenney,
! the witness explained that she brought
i the charges because she wished to defend
her sood name. She had been urged to
take this course by her family, and she
desired to lay tlie affair before the council
as a matter of duty.
"Did I say to you, 'I have you in my
power?' " asked Dr. Brown in the cross
examination.
"Yes."
"You are very sure of that?"
"Yes, I am sure of it."
"Did I not say that I would like you to
be as charitable in your judgment of my
conduct as 1 have been toward you for a
year and a half."
"You might have said something like
that. I have that in my statement.
"Did I ask you for your vote?"
"No, sir."
"How did I threaten you?'
"You said that you would give it to the
newspapers if I stabbed you again."
"Did I not say," resumed Dr. Brown, " 'if
this matter should get into the newspapers
would it not make a scandal?' "
"You said that," replied the witness,
"and you said that you would give it to
the press."
"Was not this what I said, 'That even as
innocent an act as yours if given to the
newspapers would be liable to misinter
pretation and scandal?' You admit that
I said that I hud no suspicion of any
wrongdoing in the organ?"
"You said that you didn't thmk there
was any cause for suspicion, but you did
not say that there was not," replied the
witness.
The mother of the young woman also
presented a statement, under oath, cor
roborating her daughter's testimony as to
the conversation had in Dr. Brown's
house.
Dr. Brown asked the privilege of giving
his version of the case. In a matter-of
fact way he told of the organ episode and
his later reason for requesting the young
lady to withhold judgment in his own case.
The pastor declared with much earnest
ness that he had not meant to threaten the
accusing witness, but merely to remind
her that she was under great obligation to
him for withholding from the public a pos
sible unpleasant event in her life.
Dr. Brown acknowledged the unim
peachable character of the young lady,
and failed to see why she should have
seen proper to misinterpret his remark.
The witness took occasion to refer to
the affidavit of Mrs. Lena Blanchard. He
said that no intimidation had been used
in this case, but that she told^her if she
failed to sign what he had sworn to the
previous evening he would consult the
Chief of Police. Mrs. Blanchard then
signed the document.
At the conclusion of Dr. Brown's state
ment Dr. Freeland moved that Attorney
Nagle De not heard by the council again.
E. 0. Williams promptly seconded the
motion, but before it could be placed be
fore the house Dr. Tenney made an amend
ment to the effect that Mr. Nagle be re
quired to apologize.
This precipitated numerous motions,
ending finally in Mr. Nagle's being ex
cluded from the deliberations of the coun
cil as Dr. Brown's attorney, and, further,
that the case of the prosecution and de
fense be declared closed.
Dr. Brown was instructed to be present
to-day at 11 o'clock, prepared to make his
argument, after which the council will go
into executive session.
, The council adjourned to meet at 10:30
o'clock to-day.
Joseph Leonard was arrested in New
York the other day tor stealing a door
mat. He told the Judge that he took it
because the word "Welcome" was on it.
HOW VOICES ARE RUINED
Frau Mauterna Describes the
Effects of Sioging Music
Drama.
WAGNER WROTE " BEL CANTO."
The Prima Donna Says Too Many Girls
Rush, Half Prepared, on the
Stage.
There are few women on the lyric stage
to-day who have oftener stretched out the
hand of good fellowship to struggling
young artists than Frau Materna. She is
always ready with a word of valuable ad
vice or whole-souled encouragement,
when her professional work brings her in
contact vith young and talented singers,
but woe betide the young person of slen
der talent and big ambition, who stumbles
across Materna's path, for she never flat
ters mediocrity.
Materna was asked yesterday to say a
few words of wisdom about Wagnerian
singing, and its effect on the voice, for who
is so qualitied to speak on the subject as
the woman who created the roles of his
heroines for Wagner himself? "Ach!
that is the thing I love most to talk of,"
said Materna in her genial frank way, for
there is nothing haughty or commanding
in private life about this terrible
Brunhilde, though she positively over
rowers one with her majesty on the stage.
When you talk to Materna, though, yon
forget that she is a celebrity. If she had
spent her life in Knitting'stockings and
concocting stews, you could not feel more
at home with her, or more assured that
she is the sort of woman who would sym
pathize with you if you were in trouble.
"I am so sorry that I speak not English
better," said tne prima donna apologeti
cally. 'â¢German is the tongue I have
always sung in, even when I was singing
'Fidelio,' 'Africanna' and the other operas
of the old repertory.
"You ask, 'Does singing Wagner music
wear out the voice?' I must answer 'no.'
Twenty-five years ago, when I began to
sing the master's music, all the people
said to me, 'Oh ! my dear Materna, in five
years you will have no voice; you will
have screamed it all away.' Well, that is
twenty-five years ago, and my voice is as
strong as ever and the high tones are
clearer. I was a mezzo-soprano when
Wagner first began to teach roe his roles.
His music wants very high and very low
notes. At first I would say, 'Oh, no, not
so high as that,' but he would say, 'That
must be sung, try,' and always I found he
knew best.
'â¢There is one mistake that many people
who try to sing Wagner's music make.
They think it is loud and strong, and that
so they must always practice at full voice.
That wears out their voices. I have always
practiced mezzo voce, for, if you can sing
a thing with the half voice, to yourself,
you can always sing it with the full voice
when yon are before the public.
"Much depends upon the conductor. A
man who knows and understands Wagner
subdues the orchestra so that the sound
does not overwhelm the singer. How
great poor Hermann Levy was for that.
It was a joy to sing 'Parsifal' to his con
ducting."
Materna was alluding regretfully to the
great Wagnerian conductor who is report
ed lately to have become insane and who
has been forced to retire from the conduc
torxhip of the Hof Theater of Munich.
"But anyway, a singer who produces her
voice properly can never force her tones,"
continued Materna thoughtfully. "If she
produces it so," and the disciple of Wag
ner gave a deep guttural roar, "her voice
must wear out very soon, for she is strain
ing the muscles of her throat: but if the
sound reverberates so," and this time JVla
terna emitted a tone that rang forward on
her palate, after which she added compla
cently, "that sort of production does not
wear out the voice."
Waener's great motto, according to Ma
ternaj was to make his artists sing as they
spoke. "No faces, no contortions, he
abominated all those unnatural things.
Oh! it is terrible to see the way some
singers twist their mouths out of shape,
when they might sing as easily and natur
ally as they talk if they would only try.
But I will tell you what is the iirst real es
sential for Wagner singing, and that is to
have the bel canto before you begin to
study the music dramas. All the time I
see poor girls going on the stage with only
three or four tones in their voices and they
sing Elsa and Eva and Senta. Poor little
things; they are almost children and they
have not studied half enough. In two
years their voices are gone, but it is not
singing Wagner that has ruined them ; oh,
no, it is because they began to strain their
voices in difficult parts before they had ac
quired enough school to know how to use
them. It i? terrible nowadays now many
unprepared young ladies go on the stage."
Frau Materna says that she attributes
her own success in the music dramas
largely to the fact that she understood bel
canto and could sing Mozart's ilorid arias
before she began to study Wagner's music.
She scorns the idea that there is no bel
canto in Wagner, however. "Elizabeth's
role, is that not all singing?" she asked.
"And Elsa, and above all Isolde. When
Tristan lies dead and Isolde sing? her
dying lament over him till her voice
grows fainter and dies away, who can say
that swan song is not bel canto?"
When the sinprer was asked for some
personal reminiscences of the master
whose music she had praised so much
tears welled up in her kind eyes and she
answered quickly : "No, I cannot talk of
him. Wuen I sing his music my whole
heart goes out into it, out when I think
that so good a man, so great a composer
is dead, then â excuse me." and Materna
tried to smile away some big tears and
hastily turned the conversation to her
pleasure at being in the golden California
sunshine.
MEETING OF THE JUNTA
Buckley Scored by McNab and
a Committee on War
Appointed.
Sam Rainey Lay Low and the Gen
eral Committee Was Har
monious.
The ijnterrified element of the Democ
racy, familiarly spoken of as the Junta,
under the marshal3hip of Gavin McNab]
assembled in general committee meeting
in Pioneer Hall last night. The rollcall
showed the presence of 370.
W. P. Sullivan called the meeting to or
der and made a few pertinent remarks rel
ative to the future prospect of the Democ
racy in San Francisco.
Mr. Sullivan was elected permanent
chairman of the committee without dis
senting voice, and he made a short speech
in acceptance of the honor conferred upon
him. l
After referring to the trials and tribula
tions through which the party passed dur
ing the last few years of Buckleyisiu, he
said that the party could not expect fair
treatment from the Republican press,
'liut, he continued, "the Republi
can press does not control the
political earth and the Democratic
party of San Francisco has an able and
poweiiul organ back of it iv tuia City. I
wish to make to you the announcement at
a matter of news that from -now on thÂ«
Democratic organ of this City will bacÂ«
this movement, and I hope thai in the
future you will all look to the Examine!
for the legitimate news of what is going
on in Democratic politics.
After a brief reference to the Fire De
partment and other branches of the muni
cipal government, he concluded by saying
that the slogan of the party should be:
"An honest government by honest offi
cials for all the people."
L. M. Manzer was nominated vice-chair,
man by Mr. Jacobs. His election was by
acclamation. JoÂ»'in F. McGovern was
elected secretary and I. Gutte treasurer
without opposition.
M. Doyle of the Thirty-seventh District
moved the appointment of a committee of
nineteen on rules and by-laws, to report
at the next meeting, and the motion was
adopted.
The appointment of a committee on
grievances was the subject of a motion by
Major Harney. The major wanted the
committee to consist of one member from
each Assembly district, to be appointed by
the chair.
Mr. Fentqn thought the districts should
have the privilege of naming their mem
bers on the committee.
An amendment providing a place for the
chairman and secretary on the committee
was accepted and the motion thus amended
was put.
The ayes were obviously in the majority,
but a call of the roll was demanded and
resulted 217 for and 73 against.
Clitu.s Barbour presnnted n resolution
providing for the appointment of a com
mittee of fifteen to go before the Demo
cratic State Central Committee next
Saturday, clothed with authority to ex
press the sentiments of the committee as
voicing the best interests and wishes of
the Democratic majority of the City.
Gavin McXab took the floor and deliv
ered a stirring address on Democracy
in general and the local party in particu
lar, taking Buckley as the target for )ii-<
withering sarcasm and bitins satire. Ho
said that the 'blind bo^s" and his fullo'.v
ing hud all but ruined the Democracy of
the State, but the moral element w;is too
powerful and has prevailed. He traced tli<>
dissension in the party from the time of
Pond's nomination, showing the demoral
izing effect of the Buckley element.

ONDRICEK AND MATERNA.
Scenes of Knthusiasm at I :i"i Night's
Auditorium Concert.
Very unlike a placid, decorous San Fran
cisco audience was the half-filled house
that greeted Madame Materna and Franz
Ondricek at the Auditorium last night.
Perhaps the reason for the building not be
ing crowded was that this City has had a
plethora of virtuosi lately, bat it is a long
time since the biggest hbu.se here has in
dulged in such frantic enthusiasm as WH9
aroused by the two artists last night.
It was Ondricek, the Bohemian violinist,
who first set the enthusiasm going.
At the close of Ernst's concerto Pathc
tico there was a frantic demand for an
encore, to which Ondricek responded by
playing Schumann's "Evening Song."
The succeeding numbers only confirmed
the good impression made by the artist.
The vocalist of the concert was
Materna, the like of whora has not been
heard in this City for years. It is all very
well to say that Materna has been sing
ing Wagner music for twenty-rive years,
and that before appearing in music drama
she sang the older operas, and as a
| very young girl she appeared in operetta.
j These' facts only prove Amalia Materna to
I be the greater artiÂ«t.
The difficult "Liebestod" from "Tristan
and Isolde" showed the wear and tear in
Materna's voice more, but soe rendered it
with consummate art, and won so deter
mined an encore that she finally hv^i to
piead fatigue in dumb show to escape ping
ing again.
Luckstone showed himself tÂ» be an ex
cellent accompanist, and his playing of
Liszt's Sixth Rhapsodic was much ap
! plauded.
The next concert will be given to-morrow
afternoon, and there will be a grand
popular concert on Sunday evening.
Manufacturers 1 Annual Meeting.
The Manufacturers' and Producers'Associa
tlon has decided to hold its annual meeting
March 25, or the last Wednesday of the month.
At that meeting the directors for the following
year will be elected.
Henry W. Sage, the benefactor, whose
birthday Cornell recently celebrated, has
given that university at different times
suras amounting fo $1,155,000. As the
Cornell Sun puts it, without Mr. Sage's
eift Cornell would not be a university at
all, but merely a polytechnio institute.
One of the most notable of his gifts is
Sage Hall, for women.

Clans Spreckels Has Gained
a Notable Vic
tory.
DEMURRER OVERRULED.
It Contained the Gist of the
Hawaiian Company's
Litigation.
RIGHTS OF FOREIGN COURTS.
When All Parties Are Citizens of
This State Suits Cannot Be
Brought Elsewhere.
The demurrer submitted by C. A. Spreok
els to the complaint of Clans Spreckeb has
hien overruled and bis motion to dissolve
the temporary injunction issued by Judge
Bahrs and to strike out certain portions of
the complaint have been denied.
The suit of Claus Spreekels grew out of
an action brought in the courts of Hawaii
by the Hawaiian CominerciaJ and Suear
Company, which is a California corpora
tion doing business in Hawaii, against
Claus Spreckels. The suit was for a decla
ration of trust regarding certain property
owned by Mr. Spreckels in the island of
Maui and for the conveyance of that prop
erty to the corporation." It was claimed by
the corporation that the land owned by
ilr. Spreckels had been acquired by him
while he was one of its officers and that he
hold it in trust for the corporation.
As soon as this suit wa^ brought to the
notice of Mr. Spreckels in this City he con
sulted his attorneys, Delmas & Shortridge,
and for him they began a suit here against
the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany and Russell J. Wilson, Moumford S.
Wilson, Charles S. Wheeier, Rudolph
Spreckels and B. J. Hoffacker, the direct
ors of the company, denying all of the
claim* of the company regarding the land
in Hawaii and asking for an injunction re
straining them I'rom proceeding in the
suit in Hawaii on the ground that the
suit there had been brought at the instance
and reqtiest of C. A. Spreckels, wh<>, it
was alleged, is the real controller of the
Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany.
It was alleged in the complaint that the
suit in Hawaii had been brought in fur
therance of a systematic pian by which C.A.
Spreckels has lor years annoyed his father,
Claus Spreckels. It was "further urged
that it was iniquitous for citizens of this
State to attempt to drag another citizen of
this State into a foreign jurisdiction to
answer to a suit which must ultimately be
determined by the laws of the place of
residence of all parties and wuere ail of
the contracts and obligations, if any, were
entered into by Claus Spreckels. It was
also alleged that Claus Spreckels could not
by any process of the courts of Hawaii
procure the testimony which would be
necessary in his defense to he given in the
foreign courts, and that all of the testi
mony rouid be given in the courts here.
< 'â ; 'November 21 Judge Bahrs issued an
injunction as prayed lor and then the de
fendants demurred and moved to strike
out various parts of the complaint and to
dissolve the injunction granted by Judge
Bahrs.
These motions raising, as they did, only
issues of law; were afterward very fully
argued by C. S. Wheeler for the defendants
and D. M. Delraas for the plaintiff. On
the part of the defendant it was contended
that as the land which was sought to be
recovered was in Hawaii the suit was
properly. brought there, and that section
3423 of the Civil Code of this State, which
declares that an injunction shall not be
granted to stay proceedings in another
court which have already been com
menced, prohibited the courts here from
enjoining the defendants from continuing
in their proceedings in Hawaii. . .
â¢ To this the plaintiff replied generally
that it made no difference where the land
in question was situated, our own courts
had the power to require citizens of this
State to do all things necessary to protect
the rights of other citizens of this State,
even to compelling the transfer of land,
and further that no citizen should in good
conscience be permitted to bring vexations
suits in foreign courts which could be
better brought and more advantageously
tried in the court! of this State. As to the ',
claim that the court was denied jurisdic
tion by the provision of the Civil Code,
the plaintiff urged that the constitutional
provision, which gives to the Superior
courts of this' State jurisdiction in all
cases in equity, was above any provision
which the Legislature could make; that
the constitutional provision had been ex
pressly declared by the Supreme Court of
this State to give the Superior courts ex
actly the same jurisdiction that was
exercised by the High Court of Chancery
in England at the time of the adoption
of the constitution; that the High Court
of Chancery had always restrained citizens
of England from prosecuting iniquitous
suits against other citizens in foreign
courts; that this practice had been 1
adopted by the courts of the United States
and of the various States of the Union,
and that on general broad equity prin
ciples the power was in the courts of this
State to protect its citizens from wrongs
on the part of other citizens, no matter
whether those wrongs were committed
here or committed elsewhere.
Judge Troutt in bis decision yesterday
morning decided that the plaintiff was right
in all of his contentions, and that the de
fendants as a matter of law had no right
â  to require him to go two thousand miles to
answer their alleged claims against him.
This means that the rights of the parties
to the suit will be tried here, where all of
the parties live and where all of the obli
gations arose,..

The plaintiff, Clans Bpreekels, seeks to ob
tain a decree of court enjoining the defendant
corporation (Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar
Company) and its directors from prosecuting
the corporation's action which was commenced
on October 1, 1895, and is now pending in the
Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit of
the republic of Hawaii. â â â :â . I, â , ,
The complaint substantially alleges as fol
-1 That the defendant corporation (created
and existing under the laws of California) be
gan its suit in the Hawaiian republic for the
alleged purpose of obtaining a decree of court
declaring said Claus Spreckels to be a trustee
to the said corporation's use of the fee simple
of about 6000 acres of land aituate . on the
Island of Maui, in said republic, and directing
him to execute and deliver to said corporation
a deed of said property, and also to account
for and pay over to it Â» * money received by
him as rent, issues and -profits thereof since
the time when he acquired title thereto.
Points in the Corporation' Complaint.
2 That a writ of injunction was duly issued
' commanding said Claus Spreckels to refrain
from selling or incumbering the aforesaid land.
3. That no process has been" served in said
4. That said corporation alleged in â  its com
(o"Tnat said Claus Spreckels in - 1878 made
an agreement with Hermann Schussler, Fred
erick Low, Wiiliam F. Babcock and Hermann
Bendel, all of San Francisco, to establish a
large sugar plantation on the aforesaid island
of Maui, and to secure the necessary land and
water supply, and to form a corporation under
the laws of California to own and to operate
such a plantation, and that about September
30. 1878, such corporation was formed by said
persons, under the name of Hawaiian Com
mercial Company, after said Claus Spreckels
had obtained, in pursuance of the aforesaid
agreement, certain grants and leases of land,
water franchises and contracts for the use and
benefit of said plantation.
The Director*' Resolution of 1378.
(b) That about October 24, 1878, said Claus
Spreckels executed a deed of trust declaring
that he held all of the property, deeds, grants,
leases, contracts and franchises of, concerning,
and connected with said plantation, to the
use and for tne benefit of said company, to be
conveyed to it upon demand.
(c) That on October 8, 1573, the directors of
said company adopted a resolution authorizing
said Clans Spreckels to lease, sell or exchange
any of said property upon such terms and in
such manner as he" might deem best, in his
own name and as his own act. and providing
that said company would accept from him as
and for a full and complete performance of the
obligations imposed on him by said deed of
trust, so much of the property described
therein as might remain in his hands when
demand was made noon him for a transfer,
together with all proceeds received by him for
any disposition of the property in said instru
ment described.
Six Thousand Acres in Dispute.
(d) That said Glaus Spreckels was at all
times the owner of a majority of the stock of
said company and the managing director
thereof, and had the entire direction and con
trol of the affairs thereof, and continued to ac
quire in his own name at the expense of said
company, and for its use and benefit, certain
other leases and grants of lands, rights of way
and water on the island of Maui, including
the aforesaid GOOO acres of land in dispute.
{() That on March 31, 1882, a new corpora
tion was formed under the laws of California,
under the name of the Hawaiian Commercial
and Sugar Company, and | the new company
duly purchased all the assets of the old com
pany, and received an assignment of the aiore
said'deed of trust.
(f) That by deeds of September 25, 1882, and
Feoruary 27, 1888, said Glaus Spreckels pre
tended to convey to the new company "all
and singular the lands, tenements, heredita
ments, rights, liberties, franchises, powers and
authorities then vested in or acquired" by
him, but in fact he failed to convey the afore
said 6000 acres of land.
What Clans Spreckels Refused to Do.
(g) That in 1894 it was ascertained for the
first time that said Clans Spreckels had failed
to convey to the said Hawaiian Commercial
and Sugar Company the aforesaid 6000 acres of
land and had failed to account for and pay over
to said company the moneys he had received
therefrom. Thereupon a demand was duly
made upon him that he should so convey said
land and account to said company and pay
over said moneys, all of which he then refused
and ever since has refused to do. -
The plaintiff then proceeds to deny specifi
cally all of the allegations in the company's
complaint in its Hawaiian suit concerning the
aforesaid 6000 acres of land, and he sets forth
ail the circumstances under which he ac
quired title to said land and claims that he is
entitled to hold the same in his own name and
to and for his own use, together with all
moneys received therefrom as rents or profits
or otherwise.
Allegation as to Right and Title.
And plaintiff further alleges that in January,
189-t, he sold his stock ana all his interest in
said Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany to C, A. Spreckels, aud said C. A. Spreck
els has ever since had the controlling interest
in said company; and that the directors of
said company ever since have been named by
him, and have in every way acted in subordi
nation to his wishes and directions, and have
exercised but nominal functions, and have in
fact, if not in law, delegated and surrendered
all their powers and the whole management
of the affairs of said company to C. A. Sprecfc
els. And that said C. A. Spreckels from 1878
to 1893 was perfectly familiar with all the
affairs of plaintiff and with every fact and
circumstance attending the acquisition by
plaintiff of the title in fee to the aforesaid six
thousand acres of land, and that he has always
well known that said company has never had
any right or title to said land either in law or
in equity, and that said C. A. Spreckels insti
gated and caused theboard of directors of said
company to authorize and direct the institu
tion and prosecution of the aforesaid action
against plaintiff in the courts of the Hawaiian
Islands in pursuance of a plan to harass and
annoy plaintiff and to place him at a disad
vantage in the maintenance of his defense to
such action.
Defendants Demur to the Action.
In support of their demurrer the defendants
most seriously urge as one. point that section
3423, subdivision 1 of our Civil Code is a bar
to plaintiff's action. -â¢ -
The subdivision of the section cited reads:
"3423. An injunction cannot be granted. - .
"1. To stay a judicial proceeding pending at
the commencement of the action in which the
injunction is demanded, uniess such restraint
is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of such
proceedings." . . . .
In response to this point plaintiff contends
that the Legislature intended in this provision
merely to declare that one court shall not
directly stay, by injunction, the official action
of another "court of co-ordinate jurisdiction,
and not that a court may not by injunction
restrain the personal act of a party to the ex
tent of commanding him to proceed no further
with his suit.
Authority of the Court in Foreign Land*.
To sustain this distinction plaintiff refers to
the following language in ''Story's Equity
Jurisprudence," (vol. 2, section 899.)
It has sometimes been made a question. whether
courts of equity have authority to stay proceed
ings in the courts of foreign countries. Nothing
can be clearer than the proposition that the courts
of one country cannot , exercise any control or
superintending authority over those of another
country. The independence, equality and sov
eritrnty of every country would repudiate any such
interference as Inconsistent with itnown supremacy
within its own territorial domains. But although
the courts of onÂ» country have no authority to stay
proceedings In the courts of another, they have an
undoubted authority, to control all persons and
things within their own territorial limits. When,
therefore, both parties to a suit in a foreign coun
try are resident within the territorial limits of an
other country, the courts of equity in the latter
may act in personam upon those parties and direct
them by injunction to proceed no further in such
suit. In such a case these courts act upon ac
knowledged principles of public law in regard to I
jurisdiction. They do not pretend to direct or con
trol the foreign court, but without regard to the
situation of the subject matter of the dispute they
consider the equities between the parties and de
cree in personam according to those equities, and
enforce obedience to their decree by process in per
lODam. Hence It is the known habit of courts of
equity to relieve in cases of contracts and other
matters respecting lands situated in foreign coun
tries. . ,
Jurisdiction to Restrain by Injunction:
The case of Engel vs. Scheuerman, decided
in 1869 by the Supreme Court of Georgia (40
Ga.,2ll)"is also cited. The court there says:
This bill is not filed for the purpose of restrain-
S ing the proceedings of the court of .New York; the )
courts of this *tate have ro jurisdiction to do that,
nor would the courts of this â¢ state have jurisdic
tion to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment ob
tained in the courts of New .York - oetween citi
zens of that State resident there. The question :
here Is. whether a court of chancery, in this State
baa jurisdiction to restrain the personal action of
a defendant so far as to prohibit him from enforc- i
in;; the collection of the judgment obtained in the j
courts of New York according to the facts of this i
case. There is a clear distinction as to the power
and authority of a court of equity iii this State to
restrain by injunction the proceedings of a court
in another Stuwi and the power and authority of
such court to restaln by injunction the personal
aci:on of a citizen of this State. In the one case a j
court of equity In this State has no jurisdiction in
the other; it has jurisdiction to restrain by injunc- |
tion the personal action of the defendant h'mself â 
from enforcing any nnconsclentious demand In an
other .State, whether that demand is reduced to
judgment or not, upon a proper case being made."
What Chief Justice Fuller Said.
Mr. Chief Justice Fuller of the Supreme
Court of the United States is quoted as saying
in 1890: â¢'
And the reason urged against the exercise of the
power (to restrain by injunction proceedings pend
ing in the courts of another state) was that' if the |
courts of one State should see Jit to enjoin pro
ceedings in another, the latter might retaliate in
like manner in enjoining proceedings in the first, j
and thus give rise to an endless conflict of
jurisdiction. But this reasoning lias not, com- j
mended Itself to the judicial mind, for the In
junction is not directed to the courts of the other
State, but simply to the parties litigant: and, al
though the power should be % exercised with care,
and with a just regard to the comity which ought
to prevail among co-ordinate sovereignties, yet its
existence cannot at this day be denied. 'â '
Authorities Cited by the Defendants.
Against this construction of. the statute de
fendants cite certain decisions of our Supreme !
Court, holding that one court cannot stay pro- I
ceedings in another court of this State, if of co- I
ordinate jurisdiction, by joining a party in :
interest from continuing with his suit.- An- j
thony vs. Dunlap, 8 Cal., 26; Rickett vs. John- !
son, 8 Cal., 34; Uhlfelder vs. Levy, 9 607; I
Crowley vs. Davis, 37 Cal., 268; Wilson vs. i
Baker, 64 Cal:, 475. .- -
, Upon an examination of these authorities I |
am satisfied that plaintiff's aforesaid interpre- '
tation of the statute is not the one that should i
prevail. . : ."- â  .:' . â¢' ' . 'â -. > "â  r ,
From another point of view, however, the i
question -presents itself as to whether or not j
the Legislature intended by the aforesaid I
section to deprive a court of equity of the '
power to enjoin a citizen of this state from j
taking, an unfair,; oppressive, inequitable ad- !
vantage of a fellow-citizen by prosecuting a
pending suit in a foreign country. ,
When the reason of a rule ceases, the rule
itself i should cease. S This is an important
maxim of jurisprudence. --_:-. .
California Laws for California Citizens'. .
To use the language of plaintiff's counsel,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
â 'When the Civil Code was adopted the Legis
lature established the law in this State for the
governance of the people of this State. It was
not concerned, in protecting the dignity or en
larging the jurisdiction of the courts of Ha
waii, of New York or of England. It was con
cerned in the protection of citizens of Califor
nia from wrongs threatened or carried on by
other persons, whether citizens or not. The
State owes this protection to its citizens in re
turn for the support which the citizens give
to it
"The old distinctions between actions at law
and actions in equity have been abolished, so
far as concerned the forum, by the constitu
tion in this State. Therefore, where all of the
Superior courts in California had complete
equitable jurisdiction wrong, or least con
fusion, would tiave resulted, if citizens sued
in one Superior Court haQ been permitted to
bring counter factious for equitable relief in
another Superior Court of concurrent jurisdic
tion. This rule had been adopted by the courts
of this SUite long prior to the adoption of sec
tion 34123 of the Civil Code, and that section
must be taken as merely declaratory of the
rule."
Foreign Judgments 3lay Be Reviewed.
In the case of Smith vs. Davis, decided in
June, 1891 (90 Cal., 32), the ooject of the
action was to obtain a decree directing the
execution ol a trust relating to certain lands
in Washington Territory. The Supreme Court
says: "If the parties are within the jurisdic
tion of the court an injunction will be granted
to stay proceedings in a suit in a foreign coun
try. Courts of equity have, as between parties,
reviewed the judgments of foreign courts and
even sales made under their judgments when
fraud or undue advantage was shown.
"A trust will be enforced pertaining to
realty, regardless of the situation of the prop
erty.
"The decrees of courts of equity primarily
and properly act in personam, and, at most,
collaterally only in'rem.'"
One Exception to the Doctrine.
Story says (Eg. Jur., Sec. 900):
It is now held that whenever the parties are resi
dent within a country, the courts have full author
ity to act upon them personally with respect to the
subject of suits In a foreign country, as the ends of
justice may require; and with that view to order
them to take or omit to take any steps and proceed
ings in any other court of justice, whether In the
same country or in any foreign country. There is
one exception to this doctrine which has been duly
recognized in America; and that is, that the State
cannot enjoin proceedings in the courts of the
I'nited States, nor the lauer in the former courts.
This exception proceeds upon peculiar grounds of
municipal and constitutional law, the respective
courts being entirely competent to administer full
relief in the suits pending therein.
We find the following statement in Pome
roy's Eg. Jurisprudence, Vol. 3, Sec. 1318:
The power to act in personam, through their
remedies, is still held by all courts of equity, even
in the presence of the foregoing legislation. Of
this nature must always he the remedies wheu the
subject-matter, either real or personal property, Is
situated teyond the territorial jurisdiction of" the
court in another Sta:e or country. The jurisdic
tion to crant such remedies is well settled. Where
the subject matter is situated within another State
or country, but the parties are within the jurisdic
tion of the court, any suit may be maintained and
remedy granted which directly affect and operate
Dpon the person of the defendant and not upon the
subject matter, although the subject matter is re
ferred to in tie decree and the defendant is or
dered to do or refrain from certain acts toward it,
and it is thus ultimately but indirectly affected by
the reiief granted.
The Regulation of Provisional Injunctions.
Our Code of Civil Procedure (section 76, sub
division 1) merely repeats what the constitu
tion declares, namely, that Superior Courts
shall have original jurisdiction in all cases of
equity. (Article VI, section 5.)
The Civil Code (section 3421) provides that
provisional injunctions shall be regulated by
the Code of Civil Procedure.
Section 536, Code of Civil Procedure, says:
An injunction may be granted in the following
cases :
1. When It appears by the complaint that the
plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded and
such relief or any part thereof consists in restrain
ing the commission or continuance of the act com
plained of either for a limited period or perpetu
ally.
â _'. When it appears by the complaint *** that the
commission or continuance of some act during the
litigation would produce waste, great or irre
paruhle injury to the plaintiff.

The Inherent and Constitutional Powers.
The equity jurisdiction with which our
courts are Vested under the constitution is
that administered in the High Courts of Chan
cery in England. (People, ex. rel. Deschen
| acher vs. Davidson, 30 Cal., 379.) See also:
Rosenberg vs. Frank, 58 Cal., 337; estate of
Hinckley, 58 Cal., 457.
The Legislature must not prescribe such
regulations concerning the exercise of juris
diction as may substantially impair ilie con
stitutional powers of the courts or practically
defeat their exercises. (Ex parte Harker, 49
Cal., 467; -Wilson. vs. Roach, 4 Cal., 3Â»>2; Wil
lis vs. Farley, 24 Cal., 500.)
As late as 1893 Mr. Justice Paterson, speak
ing for the court upon the subject of inherent
and constitutional powers of the court (in the
particular instance the power to punish ' for
contempt) said: "The Legislature â  may regu
late the procedure and enlarge the powers, but
it cannot, without trenching upon the consti-
I tutional powers of the court and destroying
! the autonomy of that system of checks and bal
j ances which is one of the chief features of our
| triple form of government, fetter the power
I itself." In re Shortridge, 99 Cal., 532.)
j Jurisdiction of the Chancery Courts. .
In 1890, in the case of Cole vs. Cunningham
(10 Sup. Court Reports, 272), the United States
Supreme Court says:
The jurisdiction of the English Court of Chancery
to restrain persons within its territorial limits and
under its jurisdiction from doing anything abroad,
whether the thing forbidden be a conveyance or
other act, in pads, or the institution or the prosecu
tion of an action in a foreign court, is well settled.
In Perm vs. Lord .Baltimore (1 Yes. Sr., 444), Lord
Hardwicke recognized the principle that equity as
it acts primarily In personam, and not merely in
rem. may, where a person against whom relief is
sought is within the jurisdiction, make a decree
upon the ground of a contract or any equity sub
sisting between the parties respecting property sit
uated out of the jurisdiction. * * * Perm vs.
Lord Baltimore is cited with approval by Chief
Justice Marshall in Massick vs. Watts (6 Crunch,
148), where a suit was instituted In the Circuit
Court of Kentucky to compel the conveyance by
the defendant of the legal title of land in Ohio oh
the ground that he had notice when it was pur
'â . chased of the prior equity of the complainant. The
j defense was that the lan 1 was beyond the jurisdic
tion of the court and within the State of Ohio.
This defense 4 was overruled by the court below
and its decision affirmed by this court. .
This court is of the opinion, said th* Chief Just
ice, that Â«i a case of fraud, of trust or of contract,
the jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery is sustain
-1 able wherever the person te found, athough lands
not within the- jurisdiction of court maybe Effected
by the decree. And in Pennoyer vs. Sett (95 >>. S.,
714, 723), it is said in the opinion of the court, by
Mr. Justice Field: "The State, through its tribu
nals, may compel : persons domiciled within its
limits to execute, In pursuance of the contracts re
specting property elsewhere situated, instruments
in such form and with such solemnities as to trans
fer the title, so far as such formalities can be com
plied with, Â»nd the exercise of this jurisdiction in
no manner interferes with the supreme control of
the property by the State within which it is
situated." in Lord Portarlington vs. Soulvy (3
Mylne & X., 104, 108), Lord Chancellor Brougham
reviews the history of the Jurisdiction to restrain :
parties from commencing or prosecuting actions In
foreign countries, and concluded: "Nothing can be
more unfounded of the doubts of the jurisdiction, j
That is grounded like all other jurisdiction of the
court, not upon any pretension to the exercise of
judicial and administrative rights abroad, but on
the circumstance of the person or party on whom
this order Is made being within the power of the
court."
I Can Restrain Those Within the Limits.
The case of Dehon vs. Foster (4 Allen, 545) is
a leadiug case upon the subject. Ii was argued
by eminent counsel on both sides and decided
upon great consideration. The Supreme Judi
cial Court of Massachusetts, speaking through
i Bigelow, C. J., points out that the jurisdiction
: of a court, as a court of chancery, lo restrain
i persons within its jurisdiction from prosecut
, ing suits upon a proper case may, either in the
courts of Massachusetts or in other States or
[ foreign countries, rest on the clear authority
| vested in courts of equity over persons within
i the limits of their jurisdiction and amenable
|to process- to stay acts contrary to equity and
! good conscience, and that, as the de
' cree of the â¢ court in such case is
: directed solely at the party it is wholly
i immaterial that such party is prose
, cuting hin action in the courts of another State
i or country. We only assert and enforce our
i own authority over persons within our juris-
I diction to prevent them from making uÂ«e of
means by which they seek to countervail and
escape the operation of our own laws in deroga
tion of the rights and to the wrong and injury
of our own citizen.
The Court Has the Power to Act.
By reasonably construing the aforesaid sec
i tion of our Civil Code so as to allow a court of
equity by process of injunction to restrain a
resident of this State, in a proper case from
continuing the prosecution of his action in a !
foreign country against another resident it
becomes unnecessary to consider either the
suggestion that the section in question should
not be permitted to control the provisions of
the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the sub
ject of injunctions, or the suggestion that the
section s unconstitutional in that it imposes
a serious limitation upon the equity powers of
the court as conferred by article VI, section 5,
of our constitution, and confirmed by the de
cisions of our Supreme Court.
Heingof the opinion that the aforesaid section
of the Civil Cede does not affect the power of
this court to grant the relief that plaintiff
seeks, it remains for the court to determine
whether or not the admitted facts justify the
issuance of an injunction to restrain defend
ants from continuing the prosecution of the
suit in the Hawaiian republic.
Personal and Real Property Involved.
The defendants by interposing their de
murrer, necessarily concede far the purpose of
disposing of all questions raised by the de
murrer, that all facts well pleaded in" the com
plaint are true.
The Hawaiian action concerns personal t>rop
erty as well as real property; for the plaintiff
therein seeKs to have Claus Spreckels account
for and pay over all moneys received by him
as rents, "issues and profits of certain land
since a certain time.
For the purpose of ascertaining whether or
not the facts alleged in the complaint are suf
ficient to entitle the plaintiff to the relief for
which he Drays, reference will now be made to
several well-known and interesting cases that
nptly bear upon the subject.
Precedents in the California Reports.
In the case of Le Breton vs. Superior Court
(6G Cal., 87), the petitioner prayed for the
issuance of a writ of prohibition against the
Superior Court of this City and County for the
purpose of arresting the proceedings of the
court in the case oi Barroilhet against said
petitioner. The Supreme Court in effect says:
It Is contended that the object of Barrollbet's
suit Is to reach personal property as well as renlty,
and that In such a case there is concurrent juris
diction created by law in the court of the county
In which Ihe defendant resides. The prayer of the
complaint against l<e Hreton is that an account be
taken of and concerning a certain trust and of the
advances of 1-e Breton's testator, and that the trust
be executed by selling land subject thereto, etc.
We find that it was a proceeding; to enforce a trust
on both personal and real property. The su't wai
brought in the country in which the administrator
resided, and we have no doubt the Superior Court
of that county had jurisdiction, as the plaintiffs
sought to reach personal property in the hands of
the trustee. And this, although the lands lie in a
foreign jurisdiction.
In Dinsmore vs. Nerenheimer(32 Sun., 204).
injunction was prayed for in New York to
restrain the prosecution of two suits that has
been brought in the District of Columbia, in
order to avoid the decisiou of the Court of Ap
peals of that State, and to take advantage of a
decision to the contrnry made by the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia. Injunction
was issued.
Location of Property Does Not Deter Action.
The court says:
The suits brooght in the District of Columbia
were commenced by a resident citizen of this
State tÂ«> enforce a measure of liability, which, un
der the facts as they had been made to appear,
would be Inequitable and oppressive and in viola
tion of the restraints contained In the contracts
voluntarily entered into and accepted. This sub
ject was very thoroughly examined In Dehon vs.
Foster (4 Allen, 545), and it was held there that
an Injunction ou^ht to issue to restrain resident
citizens there from doing :icts abroad which would
work wrong and injury tv others, and are, there
fore, contrary to equity and good conscience.
In Great Falls Manufacturing Company vs.
Worster (23 New llamp., 470), decided in
1851, the court says:
It would be a great defect in the administration
Of the law if the mere fftCt that the property wag
out of the State could deprive the court of the
power to act. As much injustice may be done in a
given case against the citizens of this state by go
ing out of the Jurisdiction and committing a wrong
as by staying here and doing It. The injustice does
not lose its quality by being committed elsewhere
than in New Hampshire, and hs the Legislature
has conferred upon the court the power to issue
injunctions whenever it is necessary to prevent in
jury, it is the duty of the court to exercise that
power upon the preservation of a proper case, and
when it can be done consis ently with the acknowl
edge! practice in courts of equity. As the principle
which is sought to be applied here has been recog
nised for nearly !2()u years, we have no hesitation
in holding that the court has jurisdiction to issue
the injunction prayed for.
That Are Exceptions to the Rule.
In Clafiin & Co. vs. Hamlin (67 How. Pr.,
294; the court says:
It has been held by this court that while, as a
general rule, the courts of this State will decline to
interfere by injunction to restrain its citizens from
proceeding in an action which has been com
menced in the courts oi a sister State there are ex
ceptions to the rule, and that where a case is pre
st-nted squarely constituting such exception ex
treme delicacy should not deter the court from
controlling the conduct of a party within its juris
illciiOn to prevent oppression or fraud, and that no
rule of comity or pnlicv forbid it. The affidavits
and papers in the CMC show that the suit brought
In Illinois wj\s not brought in good faith, but wuh
brought for the purpose of vexing, annoying and
harassing the plaintiffs in this action, and that
therefore the preliminary injunction granted should
be continued until ihe case can be tried.
As to the inherent general powers of courts
of equity our Supreme Court Bays CMerced Min
ing Company vs. Fremont, 7 Cal., 317):
In reference to the subject of injunctions the
same writer (Justice Story), after staling that they
"are now more liberally granted than In former
times," makes these practical and judicious re
marks: "It may be remarked, in conclusion, upon
the subject of injunctions, that courts of equity
constantly decline to lay down any rule which
shall limit their power and discretion as 10 the par
ticular cases in which such injunctions shall be
grunted or withheld. And there is wisdom in this
course, for i: Is impossible to foresee all the exi
gencies of society which may require their aid and
â SSUULBCe to protect rights and redress wrongs.
The jurisdiction of these courts, thus operating by
way of special injunction, is manifestly indisppnsa
bleforthe purpose of social justice in a great va
riety of cases, and therefore should be upheld by a
steady coliadenee."
It is the boast of the common law, as of every
other system of enlightened jurisprudence, that
the principles, when legitimately applied, will af
ford â  redress for every riubuautial injury. Ana
especially is it the distinguishing characteristic of
equity that while its rules art- certain its expansive
principles are ample enough to embrace all new
cases. The circumstances may be new, but there
is always some known principle or new combina
tion of known principles applicable to it. Law, in
fact, is but the roles Of com mot] sense, and the
principles of justice as applied to circumstances as
they rÂ«ally exist. And it is upon this .sensible
ground that courts of equity have wisely refuspd to
lay down any limits to their right to grant special
injunction. The right most be exercised with due
caution, but it must be exercised in proper cases.
Farts Assumed by the Court.
And now, in determining whether the de
fendant's demurrer should be sustained or
overruled, the court must assume, in the face
of the admitted facts, that the lasid in contro
versy is not held by the plaintiff in trust for
the defendant corporation, and hence that
there was no occasion for said corporation to
commence its aforesaid action against plaiu
tiff; and that in the light of all the circum
stances and facts as alleged in plaintiff's com
plaint, tne said corporation oupht not in equity
and good con.scie.nce to be permitted to main
tain and continue its aforesaid action in tha
courts of the republic of Hawaii.
The Preliminary Injunction Continued.
Hence, it is the opinion of this conrt that the
preliminary injunction heretofore granted
should be continued in force until by the trial
of the cause it shall have been determined
whether or not the facts established by the
evidence then adduced may justify the court
in permanently enjoining the defendant from
prosecuting the Hawaiian suit.
Accordingly the demurrer is overruled, with
leave to defendants to answer within ten days,
and the morion to dissolve the temporary in
junction is denied. James M. Trovtt, Judge.

MR. HERRIN TALKS ALL DAY
The Lawyer Battles Gallantly
in the Southern Pacific's
Cause.
MISTRUSTS ASSESSED VALUES.
He Considers Mr. Larue's Affidavit
Inadmissible and Incompetent
Evidence.
Attorney Herrin continued his argument
for the Southern Pacific Company during
yesterday's sitting of the United States
Circuit Court.
Mr. Herrin commenced by paying his
respects to the affidavit of Railway Com
missioner Lame relating to the assessed
valuation of the property in California
owned by the Southern Pacific Company.
He contended at considerable length that
the conrt could not take cognizance of Mr.
Lame's figures and strongly maintained
that assessment lists were incompetent
and unreliable as evidence of the actual
value of property assessed. Assessments
were made, he said, for the special purpose
of taxation, and in determining the ques
tion at issue he thought no court could
properly take them under consideration.
Having been prepared for one special pur
pose and with a view to one special end,
he did not see how any court could have
the right to make any use of them for any
purpose whatever other than that for
which they had been jirepared.
No attack, he explained, was intended
to De directed against the official honesty
of Tax Assessors. The statement was fre
quently made that property, both real and
personal, was seldom or never assessed for
anything near its market value. This,
Mr. Herrin said, might be true, but it
made no difference so long as the basis of
assessment was uniform and no unfair dis
tinctions were made between taxpayers.
He maintained that such distinctions were
seldom or never made, and denied that
corporations were the recipients of favors
greater than those shown to individuals.
The Assessor could not be attainted as
guilty of criminal negligence or bad faith
in office merely because he usually assessed
taxable property at a rieure below its mar
ket value. Still, this fact should render
all tax assessment-lists inadmissible for
the purpose of proving the real value of
property assessed, and hence be objected
to Air. Larue's facts and figures as evidence
of the value of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's property.
In relation to the transactions between
the Central Pacific Railway Company and
the Contract and Finance Company Mr.
Herrin maintained that while the road was
in process of construction the railroad
made no money. Every dollar received by
the latter-nanied organization from the
sale of bonds and other securities went
forthwith into the construction fund, leav
ing Mr. Crocker and the other members of
the concern without a cent of profit as in
dividuals.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Mr. Herrin commenced by reading an affi
davit made by VV. E. Curtis during the
Central Pacific investigation before the
Railway Commission. Mr. Curtis' state
ment dealt with the cost of laying and
maintaining the railway between Sacra
mento and Ogden. He named $30,000,000
as a conservative figure and gave an esti
mate of the running expenses and extra
ordinary disbursements, from which Mr.
Herrin "deduced the conclusion that the
company owning and operating the road
should be free to charge such transporta
tion rates as would yield a reasonable rate
of interest on the funds invested. Esti
mates of the cost of other Pacific Coast
railway lines were also cited to the same
effect.
"The result of the testimony cited," con
tinued Mr. Herrin, "is to show that in the
case of the Southern Pacific lines the cost
of laying and maintaining them far ex
ceeds the amount of their bonded indebt
edness. The California lines earned a sur
plus during 18fM of over $400,000, but in
the first half of 1895 there was a deficit of
over |800,000. This shows how the reve
nues of a railway may fluctuate. An ar
bitrary reduction of the company's trans
portation rates might injure the company
to a great extent.
"Now the Railway Commission has not
segregated the various Pacific lines, but
has treated them all as branches of the
Southern Pacific Company, regarding them
practically as a unit. However, some of
these lines are merely leased while others
are the property of other companies.*'
He contended that care should be used
in referring to the different lines, so as to
avoid danger of confusion and possible in
justice.
The case of ex-Parte Kohler, receiver of
the Oregon Pacific Railway, was cited as
showing that owing to the expense of
travel on certain portions of the road a
rate which might be considered high if the
travel were uniformly even and easy on
all sections of the line was sustained as
reasonable. Mr. Herrin reiterated bis ref
erences to the dictum of Judge Brewer in
the Day case as being in harmony with the
spirit of the Oregon Pacific case. Other
citations to the same effect wore com
mented upon at length.
Mr. Herrin was spirited and vigorous in
his contention that if complaint is
made that rates on certain lines are exces
sively high, the offending lines alone are
to be held subject to investigation, and in
case of an injunction issuing to reduce the
rates complained of this reduction ought
to effect the line or lines concerned, and
not all lines of railway owned, leased or
operated by the company owning the road
or roads whose rates are called in question.
At the same time, he said, the expenses of
running other lines owned by the same
company would have to be taken into con
sideration in arranging the schedule of
transportation charges.
"This circumstance," continued Mr. Her
rin, 'is peculiarly deserving of consider
ation in this case. The Southern Pacific
Company's lines are the links wbich join
California to the Eastern States. Now, the
transcontinental line is not a gold mine for
the company. The cost of hiving it was
enormous, while the expenses attendant,
upon its maintenance are enough to render
its gains exceedingly small. For profit- the
company depends mainly upon the reven
ues derived from its branch roads and
leased lines. Hence, in fixing the rates to
be charged on anyone or more of these lines
regard must be had to the general expenses
of the entire system of which the roads in
question forma part.
"The power of fixing transportation
rates is not an arbitrary, tyrannical one,
irresponsible in its natnre, with no other
object than the oppression of property
owners. It is a benignant power, whose
only end is the prevention of fraud and
extortion.
"The Railway Commission can have no
greater authority than ihe Federal Con
gress, yet that body cannot confiscate pri
vate property without allowing its owner
a fair compensation. The Southern Pa
cific Company is entitled to earn enough
money to run its roads and keep them In
repair, to pay the salaries of its employes
and the interest on its bonded indebted
ness, and to \ield its stockholders a fair
return for their funds invested."
Mr. Herrin read a large number of
citations, which were noted by the counsel
for the defense, after which he informed
the court that he would endeavor to close
his argument this morning.

TRUST IN LIGHT.
Contracts for righting Streets and Pub
lic Buildings May Soon Be
Awarded.
The committee representing the interests
of the San Francisco Gas Companj and
the Edison Electric Light Corporation
continues to make headway in the efforts
to form a trust. It is now regarded as
almost a certainty that the consolidation
will be effected. The stock of the San
Francisco Gas Company sold yesterday
at 82.
The Grand Jury is keeping in mind the
probability of an advance in rates should
the ''combine" be effected. It is an open
question whether the law does not pro
hibit the organization of trusts to advance
rates for commodities such as gas and
water. On this point the (Irand Jury may
seek the advice of the -District Attorney.
The fact has not escaped the attention
of the Grand jury that contracts may
soon be made by the Board of Supervisors
for lighting the streets and public build
ings of the City. The pooling of corporate
interests at this time is therefore regarded
as significant and the course of future
events will be closely watched.
CHILDREN AND CARS
A System of School Drills for
the Protection of Young
Pupils.
Superintendent Babcock Knows of but
One Accident to School Children
in Nine Years.
"The question of protection against street
car accidents should be agitated, but
more with a view to protect adults than
children. The teachers of the public
schools are extremely careful to guard the
children against the possibility of acci
dents from streetcar?," said Superintend
ent Babcock yesterday.
"Every day between 2:30 and 3 p. K.
33,000 children leave the public schools.
Most of the schools are on car lines. Con
sidering the number of children and the
number of streetcars, it is surprising there
are not more accidents. Duiing my nine
years' connection with the schools I have
known but one. That occurred on Eady
street a few months ago.
"A rule that teachers never fail to insist
upon is that children shall not cross the
street except at regular crossings, where
there are car lines.
"Yet these suggestions are good. Too
much care cannot be taken."
The Superintendent of Schools pro
duced th& following letter, which called
out his remarks, a practical one:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: In view
of the frequent accidents since the introduc
tion of the electric-car and the increased speed
at which the cable-cars are run, would it not
be well to have the children taught at school
to be more careful? In order to impress on their
minds ttie necessity of using more caution and
instill it in their minds, I would suggest that
something like the following be put in force:
1. Look both ways when crossing the street
or when alightingfrom a car.
2. Never try to cross the Rtreet when either
car or team is anyways near.
3. Don't get on'or attempt to get off car until
car stops.
4. Always get off on the right side.
My suggestion is that rules such as the above
should be posted in every kindergarten and
primary class room in the City, and that such
rules be read aloud to the class every morning
by the teacher, or perhaps, better still, by a
different pupil every day, taking them in regu
lar rotation.
In my Opinion it would oe but a short while
when children would, by such constant drum
ming, become mechanically careful and many
accidents would be avoided. As it, is now, a
very large proportion of our population, both
young and old, are getting so familiar with
danger that they are becoming more heedless
and take chances every dÂ«y that they should
not and would not take had they been taught
the foregoing simple rules.
The Queen Not Responsible.
The I'nited States Inspectors of Pteam Ves
sels yesterday took testimony in connection
with the collision of the Queen with the Brit
ish bark Strathdon in the bay off the Lombard
street wharf on February 25. As the Queen
had kept its fog-bell ringing almost constantly
aud came to a stop every minute, the board
exonerated the captain of the steamer from all
responsibility. The damage done to the bark
was estimated at $10,000.

WILL FORBID COURSING
Secretary Holbrook Says That
the Hares Shall Not
Be Chased.
NO CHANCE WITH THE DOGS.
The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals Will
Make Arrests.
Charles Hoi brook, secretary of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals, says that the coursing grounds which
are being made near the In^leside track
shall never be used while he is at the helm.
"I should like these people to know that
it is a waste of money and energy for them
to construct any such grounds," said the
secretary yesterday. "We shall never al
low coursing in this County. At the first
exhibition they give we shall have them
arrested and at each subsequent exhibition
they will be arrested. Coursing is allowed
in the county of San Mateo, but they have
<log fights and all sorts of things there
which we should never tolerate on this
side of the line.
"I know that the hare is a pest
in ninny parts of California and has to
be exterminated. But there is away of do
ing that without inflicting useless
cruelty. No true sportsman would pat
ronize the sort of coursing that I hear they
contemplate having near the Ingleside
track. The sportsmen go into the valleys
and start a hare that is fresh and fleet of
foot. Under those circumstances the crea
ture has a chance against the dogs;l>ut
what sort of sport, I should like to know,
is it to cramp up a hare for hours and then
turn it out, sick and terrilied, with scarcely
a chance against the dogs that pursue it?
Any man with an idea of fair play would
revolt against taking such an unfair ad
vantage of the hare.
"I have seen the sort of coursing I mean
in Ban Mateo, and it was patronized by
very low people. There was an inclosed
course, and the only chance of escape for
the hare was into the corners of the in
closure, where the pickets were wide
enough to let it through. I saw a sick,
terrified hare turned out on this course; it
did not know the ground, and had not one
chance in a hundred against the does. One
hare had its skin torn completely from its
back, and yet is was alive, and another was
torn in two by the dogs. Call that sport?
"VVhv, it was one of the most low down
exhibitions of cruelty I ever saw."
When asked about the coursing matches
in which so many sportsmen in England
participate, the secretary said that was an
entirely different matter. "The great
matches there are all run in the open," he
said. "As I understand it, the ground
near Ingleside is to be shut in, which
makes it an exhibition no true sportsman
would patronize. However, 1 shall see to
it that at the first exhibition given there
the people who give it are arrested. I
should not be surprised if a whisky-mill
were an adjunct of the coursing ground."
A FREE FRUIT MARKET
The Harbor Coinmiss loners Petitioned
on the Subject at Their Meet
ing Yesterday.
At an adjourned meeting oi the Harbor
Commissioners held yesterday afternoon
a strong resolution was received from the
Santa Rosa Grange, P. of H., No. 17,
favoring the establishment of a free fruit
market on the water front.
Many of the prominent organizations in
the large interior towns have long since
favorea the project, and at the present
time tne sentiment is growing very atront;.
A similar communication from the Cali
fornia Dried Fruit Agency, located at San
Jose, was read, and some time was given
up to a discussion of the subject by Com*
misÂ«ioners Cole and ChadDourne, their
colleague, Mr. Colnon, being absent.
What action may be taken, if any, was
not indicated by the order passed instruct
ing Secretary Keegan to reply to the com
munications.
An Old Man Kuu Over.
V. F. Bonner, an oid man who lives at 703

disappeared. Bonner was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where his injuries were at
tended to.

MAIL STUMER
RIO NOW SAFE.
Ran Short of Coal and Made
for the Hawaiian
Islands.
WOOD USED FOR FUEL.
Spare Spars and Deckhouses
Thrown Into the
Furnaces.
NINE DAYS TO REACH HONOLULU
After Taking In a Supply of Coal
Captain Russell Made An
other Start.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
City of Rio de Janeiro has at last been
heard from. She had not broken down, as
to! surmised, but was simply short of fuel
and had to run for Honolulu to replenish
her stores. Heavy -weather was. experi
enced from the outset of the voyage and a
heavy head sea was encountered from
February 6 fb February 23, but why a mail
steamer should runout of coal in that
short space of time is something the agents
of the vessel cannot or will not answer.
The Rio de Janeiro reached Honolulu on
March 3 and at that time the Alameda was
in port. Captain Russell at once began a
search for coal, out as the Pacific Mail
Company does not keep a supply at Hono
lulu he had to borrow from W. G. Irwin &
Co. Two days later she was ready for sea
again and sailed for Yokohama the same
day the Alameda started for San Fran
cisco.
The fight of the Rio against the elements
was a terrific one and was only abandoned
when Captain Russell saw there was no
hope of reaching Yokohama. He was then
only a thousand miles from his destina
tion, and it was over two thousand back to
Honolulu. It was blowing a gale in the
direction of Hawaii, however, and that de
cided the master. The ship was put about,
ail sail set and the Rio started oa a journey
that took her nine days to accomplish.
There were only 300 tons of coal in the
hunkers, and to eke that out doors from
staterooms, parts of the deckhouses, sev
eral spare spars and part of the mizzen
ma-t were used. Even with this assistance
only half-steam was kept on one boiler,
and had it not been for the gale that
howled behind her the Rio might still be
adrift in mid-ocean and out of the track of
all traders.
Among the passengers of the Alameda
w;i< A. Bodelson, a young man from Chi
cogo. He left here on the Rio to take a
r>-iti'">n in Yokohama, but in order to ob
tain it he had to reach his destination be
fore the end of February. When, there
fore, the Rio put into Honolulu on March
3 he concluded there was no use goingany
further, so he returned to San Francisco
and will go hence to Chicago and resume
business.
"The officers of the Rio were not a bit
worried," said he yesterday. "Captain
Russell knew what he was about, and there
was no uneasiness aniong the passengers
or crew. It blew a gale risr ht in our teeth
almosl from the first day we left San
Francisco and the old steamer made awful
slow time. The day we were due in Yoko
hama we were still 1000 miles away and the
coai had run out. Captain Russell and his
officers held a consultation and decided to
put about and run before the storm.
When they began to tear up the deck
houses for fuel we got scared, but it came
out all right. When we reached Hawaii 1
had got all I wanted of the trip, so I made
arrangements and came back here."
Besides a very valuable general cargo the
Rio had r.early a million dollars in
treasure aboard. She was well insured
and the underwriters were so scared
over her long voyage that 25 per cent rein
surance was offered on hull and cargo in
London yesterday. The Rio should reach
Yokohama about this day week, but the
full particulars of her adventures, as
Captain Russell will relate them, will not
be known here for some time.
FOR THE MILITARY ROLL
New Duties Imposed Upon the
Local Deputy Assessors
by Law.
Gatheiing Data for the Information
of the Adjutant-General of
the State.
Taxpayers are having their curiosity
considerably aroused by the questions that
are being asked by the deputy assessors
who are now engaged in making their
rounds preparatory to making out the reg
ular annual taxrolls.
These questions are asked in conformity
with the law passed by the last Legisla
ture, but which was not approved until
March 28, 1895, too late to be carried into
effect last year. It reads as follows:
"The Assessor or his deputies must, be
fore the first Monday in June of each
year, in counties and cities and counties
visit each house and place of business in
their districts, and enroll in a field-enroll
ment book, in such form as may be re
quired by the State Board of Equalization,
all male persons residing in said county
over 1Â£ years of age and under 60 years of
age on the first Monday in March ol that
year.
"On such field-enrollment book shall be
stated whether the person enrolled is lia
ble to military duty, where his residence
is, occupation, by whom employed, * * *,
State or county of nativity, whether nat
uralized or not. From such field-enroll
ment books the military roll as required
by Section 1897 * * * shall be made."
Heretofore the military roll has been
made up lroni the great register of voters,
but as many failed to vote or register the
data was always necessarily incomplete.
Under the present system it is expected
that a much fuller and accurate record of
the available military strength of the State
will be secured.
The additional work that has thus been
imposed on the Assessor of this City has
i.ecessitated the employment of 150 field
men this year instead of 100 men as in
other years.
No difficulty is being experienced in
eecuring the* required data, except in
places like the Union Iron Works or the
rolling-mills, where large forces of men are
employed, for whom it would be difficult
to stop work and give the required infor
mation. For this reason special efforts
are being made to secure all the data
possible at the residences of people.
It is expected to have the^e rolls finished
by the end of May. In this County the
roll will be turned' over to the Tax Col
lector, and he will turn it over to the
Board of Supervisors, who will forward it
to the adjutant-general of tne State
militia. In The interior counties the roll
will be sent direct by the Assessor to the
adjutant-general.
AN ART LECTURE.
Willbur A. Reater Describes Palntiug
in Paris.
An interesting lecture on "Art in Paris"
was given yesterday by Willbur A. Keaser
for the Chinning auxiliaryin the parlors
of the First Unitarian Church. The de
scriptions of localities in and around the
French capital were illustrated by some
clever sketches and paintings made by Mr.
Reaser.
A bright, chatty account was given of the
two salons and the men whose names are
most associated with them. Purvis de
Chavennes, one of the leaders of the new
salon, was alluded to in most enthusiastic
terras, though the hearers were told that
his name is hut iittle known in America,
or even outside of France. Quoting from
Theodore Child, Mr. Keaser said: "This
man has accomplished tranquilly, but not
uncombated, the grandest and most con
siderable work of the present century. A
great decorator, a grand colorist, he has
placed upon the wails of the public build
ings of France new compositions which
stand alone in the art of this century. A
tender, misty color approaching the wonder
of Corot's grays, stately symbolical figures,
at once human and yet above the petty
cares of life; dim, primeval woods, the
largeness of mother earth."
An amusing account of the peculiarities
of Whistler made ihe audience laugh.
The painter absolutely reiused to speak
of art with fellow-painters, but showed
every picture in his studio to his dentist,
bestowing upon him, as a parting gift,
a ticket to the> Vernissage.
IS THIS HER SECRET?
A Suggestion as to How Somno
lency Is Performed by
Anna Eva Fay.
Possibility That It Is a Combination of
Carbon Paper and a Very Re
tentive Memory.
Miss Anna Eva Fay, who has been doing
cabinet trick* and "reading other people's
minds" by mental telegraphy,* invites in
vestigation into the manner in which she
produces results.
In the part of the performance given un
der the title of "Somnolency "the announce
ment is made that any one in the audience
can write a siiort question, sign his or her
name to it and then put it away until
called for. Young men move through the
audience witli half a dozen paper-covered
boards that have the appearance of card
board. These are distributed to the au
dience with a small piece of white paper,
oue placed near the top of the board, and
when passed to the next individual the
other piece is placed near the bottom.
The person receiving the taolet usually
writes where the paper is placed.
After quite a number of questions have
been written ana signed and the bits of
white paper stowed away in pockets, the
young man and the tablets disappear and
a man comes on the stage and gives a per
formance that lasts half an hour. When
his portion of the show is over Msss Fay
appears, takes a seat, has her eyes blinded
with a colored handkerchief and she pro
ceeds to "read."
"I see,' she said the other night, "the
name Jacob P. Bogardus, and he asks,
'Can Miss Fay give me a test of her
powers?' The answer is 'yes.' "
Mr. Pingree, who acts with her, asked if
Mr. Bogardus was in the house, and if so"
to present his paper. That gentleman
arose and gave his paper to a messenger
who handed it to Mr. Pingree, who read:
"Can Miss Fay givÂ° me a test of her
powers? Jacob Ã. Bogardus."
The mind-reader gave a number of
names and questions, and each succeed
ing one was a repetition of the first in
manner or announcing and reading from
the paper, the names and questions in
each case differing, of course.
Suddenly Mr. Pingree makes the an
nouncement that Miss Fay does not un
dertake to answer every question, for if
each required only one minute it would
extend the seance too late into the night.
He adds that she usually answers about 40
per cent of the questions asked. He also
states that people may bring with them
questions written at home.
In explanation it is said that the boards
banded around have under the outer cover
a sneet of carbon paper laid on one of
white paper, and when an individual
writes a question it is transferred by means
of the carbon to the white paper, and, in
order that there may be no confusion, the
white paper handed to the individual is
placed, one at the top and the other at the
bottom, the tablet turned over and the pro
cess repeated, to there are four questions
and names on each tablet. Twenty tablets
so distributed would furnish no less than
eighty questions.
When the half-hour performance is given
by the man who makes up in imitation of
other people, Miss Fay receives the tablets,
tears off the outer covering, sees the ques
tions and names and, as they are all short
and simple, she has in that half-hour an
opportunity to memorize them and, of
course, has no difficulty in "reading other
people's minds."
Sometimes during th*e performance she
gives a question and name, but no one an
swering or producing the paper, Mr.
Pingree says: "It the party does not want
to make himself known we'll pass to
another, as we have no time to spare."
Sometimes Miss-Fay will declare that a
gentleman is thinking a question but will
not write it, and she will say, "The gen
tleman is thinking 'Wlio will be the
nrxt President?' I will tell him, William
McKinley, Jr., of Ohio."
Then Mr. Pingree asks, "Is there any
one who has been (hinting that question ?"
and one in the audirtice rises and says.
"Yes, and I just told the gentleman on
my right that it would be strange if she
could discover that my mind was running
on who would be the next President."
The explanation of this is that there are
always several in the audience who set
1 heir minds on so popular a topic, and
Miss Fay being a shrewd person, an
nounces such a topic, and irenerally finds
someone willing to admit that he had beer.
thinking some smch question. If a ques
tion written at home is not announced it
may be classed as one of the 60 per cent
the lady does not answer.
Another Cut in KnÂ«t lmuml Kntes.
In order presumably to meet the recent cut
on eastbound rates made by the Panama
route, John Rosenfeld's Sons, acting as agents
for the Dispatch line of clipper ships, are
quoting a rate of 25 cents per 100 pounds on
beans, mustard seed, canned fruit, salmon,
dried fruit, asphalturn, borax and ores, as
against the 30-cent rate put in a few days ago
by the Panama people. On brandy and wine
in wood, in lots of 500 barrels or more, a 3-cent
per gallon rate is quoted, and on lots of less
than 500 barrels 3Jj cents per gallon. The
Kdward O'Brien is now loadingand is expected
to be ready to leave on the Ist of April.
Infringement of a Patent.
The case of Earl ngainst Graham was decided
in favor of the plaintiff in the United States
Circuit Court yesterday. Judgment was given
for $1 and costs. The plaintiff brought suit to
enjoin the defendant, who is the local agent of
Armour & Co. of Chicago, from using a device
for refrigerator cars and patented by the
plaintiff.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Harbor Commissioners Object to
Vessels Discharging in Mis
sion Bay.
WANT WHARFAGE CHARGES.
The Ship America, Bark Skolfield and
Steam Whaler Orca Saved
Money.
For years paÂ«t lumber vessels and coast
ers have been discharging their cargoes into
lighters in Mission Bay, and in this way
saving wharfage. Almost every day in
The Ship America, Bark Skolfield and Whaling Steamer Orca, Saving Wharfage
Dues by Discharging and Receiving Cargo in Mission Bay.
the week a coaster could be seen at anchor
between Mission Rock and Channel street
discharging her cargo at a saving of from
$15 to $50 a day. )
Lately the deep-water ships have got
"onto the snap, and they have also been
saving dock' dues. A few days ago the
America got in from Nanaimo with a load
of coal. The steam whaler Orca is ready
to sail for the Arctic, and all that she was
waiting for was her coal. The bark George
Skolfield was also ready to sail for Alaska,
but she also was waiting for coal for the
canneries. As the America had coal to
disburse and the others were in urgent
need of it, all three vessels moved into
Mission Bay, and thus saved wharfage.
The America came to an anchor and the
Orca and Skolfield moved alongside of
her, and after the transfer had been made
the ship, bark and steom whaler were
moved back to their original berths. The
saving, in :^ time and money must have
meant at least $1000 to the various owners,
but the State authorities are out and in
jured.
Some time ago Chief Wharfinger Root '
was instructed to look into the matter of j
vessels discharging their cargoes in Mis
tion Bay without paying tolls, but he has
not as yet made his report. He finds that ,
at least a third. of the lumber brought into j
San Francisco is dischargad into lighters,
and that no wharfage is collected. The
Harbor Commissioners will probably take
some action in the matter in the near fu
ture. - % .
Captain William Diedrich, or , "Father ;
Bill, ' as he is known from one end of the
front to the other." celebrated his seventv
fifth birthday yesterday. He is still hale

day in breaking up a smokestack which
had outlived its usefulness. One of the
first tugboats ever run on the bay was |
commanded by . Captain Bill, and 'when

Twenty mules were being put aboard, but
before the job was completed two of them
got away, and it took the combined efforts
of half a dozen vaqueros to secure the

The British ship City of Madras sailed
for Capetown yesterday. When the ves

Griffiths made a search of the ship and
located two young men stowed away in
the forecastle. They had the gold ferer,
and wanted to reach Kimberley by hook
or by crook. Th*Â»y were at once put in a
Whitehall boat and sent ashore, lint vow

BEAUTIFYING THE AVENUE
How Van Ness May Be Con
verted Into a Splendid
Boulevard.
Street Committee of the Supervisors
Listens to Arguments on the
Subject.
H. E. Law, president of the Van Ness
Avenue Improvement Club, gave the
j Street Committee of the Board of, Super
> visors a glowing description yesterday of
the advantages of reserving a strip twenty
one feet wide through the center of Van
j Ness . avenue ,to be planted in trees and
shrubs. -He called attention to the [ fact
that in nearly all the large cities of the
I Union magnificent boulevards are main
tained, with ornamental trees and plants
growing on either side or in. the center, as
is proposed in the case of San Francisco's
wide avenue. â¢ ; .-.. ",'"'..;.
Chicago and Washington were mentioned
| as places where boulevards served to maue
the cities beautiful. 'P^tÃSÃfipHffiÃ
Supervisor Spreckels asked regarding
â  the expense of doing the work proposed
; by , the club and Mr. Law answered . that
Superintendent McLaren of Golden Gate
Park had told him that the improvement
would not cost over: $2500, and that the .
cost of keeping the plat in order would be
about $160 a month. Mr. Law stated that
as there were six blocks north of Green
street that had not been biturainized $6000
could be saved the City by reserving the
strip and placing the bitumen on the
sides. iraipri
Mr. Spreckels asked .who the club
| thought should bear the expense of beau
| tifying the avenue, : and Mr. Law ; replied
j that he thought it should be done by the
I City, as the people would all : be ' benefited
|by the change. ,'â¢."â  â ",..-.
"He said that he had seen General For
; syth, commandant at the Presidio, and the
military man had informed him;' that he
would .do s man v; things to* beautify the
| grounds at Fort Mason.'. Thus a drive to
! the -Presidio and from - there to the cliff,
| and return by way of Golden Gate \ Park,
j Golden Gate avenue and Van Ness avenue
I could ibe S made a trip of which any city
| might be proud. '
;â¢ The committee was evidently impressed
Iby the : arguments presented : : to ; them, but
Chairman Spreckels said that the propo
sition had been in the hands of the com-
I mittee so short a time that there had been
; no t opportunity to t give = it = proper : consid
i eration, and that a careful investigation
would be made before a decision was
i reached.

MINING COMMISSIONERS
Names to Be Suggested to Cleve
land When the Mineral Act
Is Passed.
SENATE AMENDMENTS TO BILL
Tirey L. Ford Has Wired for Instruc
tions â Gold Exchange Recognized
in the East.
Expecting tbe speedy enactment by
Congress of a law providing for the Gov
ernment examination and classification of
all mineral lands in California, the presi
dent of the State Miners' Association ap
pointed a committee of four yesterday,
whose duty it will oe to recommend to
President Cleveland men whom the Min
ers' Association consider able to act as
commissioners under the mineral act bill
that has already passed the House and
has been slightly amended by the Senate,
preparatory to being referrt d back to the
House for final approval.
At the last meeting of the Miners' Asso
ciation President Neff was empowered to
appoint a committee of recommendation,
which he has announced as follows:
Charles F. Hoffman, John M. Wright,
Edward Coleman and Charles G. Yale.
This committee met for organization last
night.
According to the proposed law California
will be divided into four districts and each
district will have three Commissioners,
one an actual resident and a practical
miner and the two others appointed from
anywhere the President may see fit.
Ex-State Senator Lirey L. Ford, who is
in Washington for the Miners' Association
in the interests of the bill, has wired for
instructions as to what course he shall take
regarding the Senate amendments as
printed in yesterday's Call in the tele
graphic dispatches from Washington.
President Neff sent him a return mes
sage last night asking for more details.
Speaking of the amendments Julian
Sonntag, secretary of the association, said:
"The Senate's amendment making a
Commissioner's pay $10 a day and allow
ing nothing extra for expenses I think is
a eood idea. For myself I believe in pay
ing men good salaries, but I think that
good, competent men can be secured as
Mining Land Commissioners that are not
looking just for the emolument. It ought
to be a means of attracting men of standing
to take an interest in the mining industry.
But the pay is not to be so much considered.
Think of the magnificent opportunity the
Commissioners will have in inspecting
mineral lands to strike something rich for
themselves. What is to prevent them
from getting a patent on a big mining in
terest if they come across it?
"As to the other amendments they are
not in any wav detrimental to the purpose
of the original bill."
A copy of Tirey L. Ford's speech on
March 4 before the House Committee on
Rivers and Harbors was received from
Washington yeaterday by the Miners' As
sociation.
He has aÂ°ked the Government to dupli
cate the $250,000 appropriation made by
California for the improvement of her
rivers and the removal of the debris. Af
ter reviewing the debris question in this
State, and asserting that it would be
cheaper to collect the debris washed from
the hillsides before it could reacn the rivers
than it would be for the Government to
dredge the rivers alter they had become
obstructed, he concluded by saying: *'I
would suegest the following item be in
serted in the river and harbor bill when
finally mads up: 'For the construction of
works for the protection of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers in California, $250,-

the direction of the Secretary of War and
in accordance with the provisions of sec
tions 23, 24 and 25 of the act entitled, l% An
act to create the California Debris Com
mission and to regulate hydraulic mining
in the State of California," "approved March
1, 1893.' "
The Gold Mining Exchange of San
Francisco, lately organized' in this City,
has been given a rating in New York
financial circles which is not only very
complimentary to the integrity of the
California enterprise, but could hardljf
have been expected at this early period of
its existence.
Application has formally been made by
the New York Mining Exchange for the
listing of the properties of the Gold Min
ing Exchange upon the New York board.
More than this, the New York Exchange
is willing to accept the action of the Gold
Mining Exchange in passing upon mining
properties. This will avoid the necessity of
having the owners and promoters go
through the routine of complying with
the requirements of the New York Ex
change.
A. B. Porter, president of the New York
Exchange, in a letter addressed to General
Turnbull, writes: "We feel tbat our ex
change can receive the action of such a
board as yours as baing prima face good."
MURDERED BY TURKS.
Pilibos OhnnneÂ§Â»lan Will Ask Govern
mental Aid to Recover His
Property.
Pilibos Ohannessian, an intelligent,
bright-looking young Armenian, from
Palou, has arrived at this City from the
north, and intends to go to Washington to
ask Government protection to go home
to regain property amounting to $35,000,
-which has been taken by the Kurds and
Turks during the massacre described in the
letter below. He -will then bring his mother
and sister, the only survivors oi his house
hold from that great massacre, over here.
Mr. Onannessian speaks English quite
well for a person who, has picked it
up during two years' travel in this country.
He is from the historic ancient city of
Palou, in Armenia, on the banks of the
Euphrates, not very far from Mount Ararat,
a city which, during the reign of Armenag
and Tigranes. the Armenian Kings, was of
great importance, with its strong fortifica
tions, the remains of which are still to be
seen, and are of great interest on account
of the many inscriptions. Palou, a few
years ago, had a population of more than
33,000. while now, the inhabitants do not
number over four or five thousand. Before
the great massacre, there were more than
3000 Armenians, while now hardly live or
six hundred are left. The letter referred to
is as follows :
Palotj, Jan. 26, 1896.
My Dear Son Pilibos: You are lucky indeed
that you are away in these times, for we are
having a most terrible time here. It was only
a few days ago that we had our comfortable
home life with <iear ones around us. It seems
like a dream, for now all are scattered in great
poverty, without home shelter and anythiug
to eat or wear.
Your brother (who was only two years ago
married) and your brother-in-law and their
children have been killed, and I do not know
yet who have been left and where they are. I
have with mr- only your sister, Takouhi.
Some three weeks ago once the Kurds attacked
two or three Armenian houses and killed sev
eral of the occupants. This caused a great fear
among us, but the Pasha assured us that noth
ing more of the kind will be permitted to oc
cur again. But a week after suddenly all the
Mohammedans rose up and killtd all the
Armenians they could get hold of. There was
hardly one out of ten Armenians left alive.
We all ran out of the house towards the
mountains. I and Takouhi were first to make
our escape. I know not what happened to the
others or where they are. Harroutune, our
neighbor, who' also escaped, told us that Ara
kel, your brother, and Bedros, her son-in-law,
were killed before petting out of the house.
1 do not like to write these things to you, for
1 am afraid you will harm yourself with much
thinking of us, but I could not help it, for we
are now destitute and want you to send us
money through the missionaries; otherwise we
will surely starve to death. I pray you. my
son, do not delay to scud help to us. Your
loving mother, Dallita.
CAPTAIN BUSHNELL DYING
He Was the Pioneer Comman
der of the Ferry
Steamers.
The Railway Company Shows Its In
gratitude Toward Its Old
Commodore.
Captain William Edward Bushnell, late
master of the ferry-boat Piedmont and
commodore of the Southern Pacific ma
rine fleet, is confined to his bed with a
fatal disease.
The name of Captain Bushnell is well
known by the masters and crews of the
coast and river steamers, who for years
have. loved and respected him as no other
man and officer about the City front, and
also by the hundreds of thousands of pas
sengers who have crossed the bay on ferry
boats commanded by him during tne past
forty years. It is said of him that in all
that time not one human life was sacrificed
through his carelessness.
On November 5, 1849, Captain Bushrlell
ran the Senator, the steamboat that plied
between Sacramento and San Francisco.
This was the beginning of his service as a
bay and river captain. Since that time
he has commanded the steamers Julia,
Antelope, Confidence, Wilson G. Hunt,
Alanieda, El Capitan, New World, Oak
land and Piedmont, the latter from the
time she was launched until the 16th of
December last, when he notified the South
ern Pacific Company that "he would lie
off fora day to rest.' r He has been "rest
ing" since and it is feared he will never
again take command of the Piedmont.
From the day that Captain Bushnell
notified the office of his desire to "lie off
for a day" until now not a single inquiry
has ever been made by any official con
nected with the railroad company. No
message of regret or sorrow has ever been
conveyed to Captain Bushnell. No in
quiry came from the office or the head of
any department under the control of (j.
P. Huntingtqn as to whether Captain
Bushnell's wife had sufficient or any
money to buy medicine, pay doctor's bills,
hire a nurse or get the necessary comforts
of life. His pay was stopped on the very
day that lie sent his mpssajre to the office
that he "wished to lie off for a day."
In tbe month of July, wben the
strikers had absolute control of the com
pany's engines, yards and sheds. The
steamer Piedmont newer fell into the
strikers' handsâ not that they did not
want it. for trial after trial had been made
at the Oakland mole to board the boat and
prevent it from making regular trips
across the bay. But this dying man, who
is now forgotten by the railway company
stood on ihe deck of his boat and pro
claimed, "that the first striker who stepped
aboard would be thrown into the waters of
the bay."
His determination and firmness suc
ceeded and the steamer Piedmont crossed
the bay at pleasure, with Captain Bush
nell at the wheel.

at Ingleside Yester
day. ,
CASPER A REAL GOOD ONE.
Gratify Gave Yankee Doodle an
Argumentâ The Corrigan Green
Twice in Front.
The talent had a great day at Ingleside
yesterday. Six straight favorites won off
the reel, aDd the big crowd left for home
at the conclusion of the last event in a
most enjoyable frame of mind.
By far the best performance of the day !
wa3 that of the fast youngster Casper in i
the two-year-old handicap. Although j
delegated to carry 121 pounds, he was a
4 to 5 choice in the betting. Key del
Tierra was next in demand at threes, with
the Hobart trio â Coupon (also carrying
1-1 pounds), M. Clicquot and Lovelightâ
the next fancied. Three others of lesser
prominence also started. The gate sent :
them away to a beautiful start. Swinging
into the stretch, Coupon, the favorite, and '
Howard fc> were on nearly equal terms, j
Casper gradually shook off* his company, i
winning very handily in 49*4 seconds.
Howard 8, who seemed to havethe place
won. tired the last few yards and was
beaten out a neck by Rey del Tierra. The ;
winner is by far the most promising two- '
year-old yet shown up in this part of the
country.

I 2 choice for the maiden . seven-furlong run
I that opened the day's sport, and after hit
! tin - the stretch second to Fond Hope went
j to the front and won very comfortably
with Little Jimmie in the place. Saga
more finished in the show, ridden by Stuf
flet.
Pat Dunne/s San Marco now appears
slated to go down the line. "SVith 'J9
pounds in the saddle he commanded first
call at twos over the very ordinary Jot in
the second race, a six-furlong selling af
fair, and passing The Judge and Brametta
before the stretch was reached romped
past the stand three lengths before Charles
A, who took the place from Ike L by a
narrow margin. Brametta was close up,
the finish between the three latter named
horses being a very close one.
Dan Honig's fast mare Charm came very
near upsetting the combination of favorites
la the fourth race at six furlongs. She
took the lead soon after the barrier was
raised, and stayed in front until within
ten yards of the wire, when Sloan on the
4 to 5 chance Olive managed to get up and
win by a nose. The ring laid 4% to 1
against the black mare. Red Glen, the
I second choice, was cut off in the stretch,
finishing unplaced.
Next came a mile selling dash, with
; Yankee Doodle ruling a 4 to 5 favorite.
! The one horse considered to have a chance
! to beat him was Gratify, who was well
\ played at 7 to 5. The second choice cut
j out the running until straightened away
I in the stretch, when Coady shook the
! favorite up. and drawing away won cleverly
by three parts of a length in 1:42 flat. St.
; Lee was ridden out to beat Fortuna for the
show.
The men on the block thought it hardly
' possible that Kowalsky could make it six
! straight and in the betting on the conclud
ing event, a six-furlong sprint, gradually
raised his price until 8 to 5 was offered.
I By the time the stretch for the wire was
! reached Garner on the first choice had
i passed all but Joe Terry, and he soon had
him in the rear, winning easily by two
lengths. Terry qnit^badly the lastjsixteenth
and was beaten out for the place by Ferris
Hartman.
Track and Paddock Items.
The Cambridge stable desired to have
Jones ride Sagamore in the opening race,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
but as Stufflet -was good enough to pilot
him a few days back, the judges concluded
he ought to do yesterday.
Starter Caldwell is having a streak of ill
luck with the starting machine. In the
second race Minnie I and Garcia were left
standing, and in the last event the field
was sent away with Artist and Morvenleft
at the post.
Howard 8 appears to be rounding into
form again. He ran a cracking good race
in the handicap. The ring laid 20 to 1
against him.
Joe Terry was a supposed good thing in
the last race, his odds being forced down
from 12 to 6to 1. He ran a very creditable
race.
NEW BICLORAMA.
Opening of the Old Panorama at an
Elegant Riding Academy.
Great interest was aroused among
cyclists yesterday by the opening of the
new Rambler Biclorama at the corner of
Market and Tenth streets.
The biclorama occupies the whole ro
tunda that was once the panorama, and it
is fitted up with all the comforts and
luxuries that the most exacting wheelman
or wheelwoman could demand. Ti:e riding
academies embrace the upper rloor of the
rotunda and they are well lighted by the
great glass dome, which yesterday was gay
with bunting. The outer circle is for the
use of wheelmen and the inner circle â
which is separated by a high partition
from the masculine gaze â is reserved for
the use of ladies.
The academies presented a gay appear
ance last night. They were brilliantly
lighted with electricity, an orchestra dis
coursed cheerful music in the band stand
and a number of expert riders gave an ex
hibition of their talents for the entertain
ment of the visitors.
Downstairs the new biclorama is fitted
up luxuriously. There are ladies' parlors,
charming little dressing-rooms and hot
and cold baths and shower-baths. The
same accommodations are provided for
gentlemen, and all over the building tele
phones, electric bells ana electric lights
are always to be found handy.
SHARKEY WAS TO STRONG
The Seaman Smiled and Seemed
to Enjoy Greggains'
Love Taps.
The Fireman Landed the Most Blows
and the Referee Declared the
Match a Draw.
The much-talked-of boxing contest be
tween Alexander Greggains and "Tom"
Sharkey at tlie Bush-street Theater last
evening ended in a draw. The Hawkins
and McGoldrich contest ended in the
middle of the second round. Hawkins
easily found a beautiful opening, and
planting his right list on his opponent's
jaw, Mr. McGoldrich of the Angel City
went to sleep on the cold, cold floor.
After some preliminary boxing and
wrestling bouts the event of the evening,
in the language of the master of cere
monies, Eilly Jordan, arrived. It was an
eight-round contest between Greggainy,
the political fireman, and Tom Sharkey,
the pride of the American navy. Sharkey
was the first man to enter the ring. He
was seconded by Danny Needham, Tim
McGrath and "Spider" Kelly. Greggains
next pat in an appearance. He was looked
after by Joe Kink, George Green and
Henry Pepper.
The referee was Ed Hoenian. The time
keeper were Billy Harrison for Greggains
and Billy Gallagher for Sharkey.
At 9:50 o'clock the contestants shook
hands and the sport commenced.
Sharkey appeared at least fifteen pounds
a heavier man than Greggains, but the
latter was some inches tailor and more of
an athlete in appearance.
Referee Hoeman, after giving the pugil
ists a few choice instructions regarding
the rules of Queenberry, ordered them to
shake hands and proceed to punching.
After considerable fiddling* Sharkey was
first to lead with ttie left on Greggains'
breast. Greegaina got home a few light
taps at long ranee on Sharkey's face, but
the receiver smiled blandly and kept send
ing home left jab? which failed to reach
their destination with force.
In the second round Greggains was the
first to land, a good, heavy left on Shar
key's nose, which made the navy chap
look decidedly serious; in fact, he lost the
greater part of his confident smile. Shar
key swung his right at Greggains' head,
but the latter easily ducked and thereby
avoided punishment. Unce again Greg
gains planted his left-hand glove on
Sharkey's nose and handsomely ducked
away from a sledgehammer swing which
spent itself on the smoky atmosphere.
In the third round Sharkey made a mad
rush at Greggains from his corner when
time was called, but he missed the target
by several yards. Greegains stopped
Sharkey a few times with straight left
hand stops, but in a ralley that followed
sharkey got in a few good punches on
Alexander's neck near the clo^e of the
round. No heavy blows were landed dur
ingthebout.
In the fourth round a short rally opened
the engagement. Both men landed on the
necE and face and Greggains missed a
grand opening which was given him to
put his right xiuke on Sharkey's jaw. The
latter forced the pace and smashed Greg
cains a few times on the face and neck,
which knocked considerable stamina out
of the fireman.
During the fifth round Greggains landed
straight left-hand punches on Sbarkey's
mouth, but the receiver did not seem to
notice the love taps, and continued to bore
in upon his opponent and compelled Greg-
Kains to break ground repeatedly. Up to
this time there were not more than half a
dozen good blows landed by either of the
contestants.
In the sixth round Sharkey played for
Lis opponent's stomach and while engaged
in this pastime the fireman was planting
his left glove on the seaman's face. It was
a kind of a nip-and-tuck game, neither of
the contestants' suffering any severe
damage to their respective anatomies.
Very little boxing was done in the sev
enth round. Sharkey and Greggains were
evidently reserving their strength for (he
final rally, and when time was called
Sharkey rushed like a wild bull from his
corner at his opponent, and, swinging:
his sledge-hammer right, he missed
the fireman's head and stumbled against a
post. Greggains was taken by surprise,
and met Sharkey as the latter settled him
self for a second bull-run rush. Some
sharp infighting followed, and it was a
matter of give and take until
the timekeeper called corners. Snouts
for Sharkev and Greggains followed,
but Referee Â£d Hoenum staled that the
match wm so evenly contested he ooaid
only give one decision, and that was a
draw. The announcement was received
with general approval and all concerned
seemed highly pleased wilh the contest.
iSot one thimbleful of b'ood was shed.
Newsboys* Club v Success.
The Newsboys' Club at 113 Powell street, is
proving a successful experiment.
The membership has reached seventy-five,
and the boys are showing a marked interest in
the games and entertainment, substantial and
otherwise, provided for them.
They are privileged to spend the evening of
every day of the week at the clubhouse, and
every Thursday evening an entertainment of
musical and literary exercises is provided.
Yesterday at noon the restaurant, by means
of which it is hoped to meet the expenses of
the club, was opened. The main restaurant is
tor the public, and it is aimed to make it a
first-class refectory. The boys' meals are
served in the annex.
The quarters are almost furnished by this
time and it is expected to arrange soon to pro
vide some of the boys with lodgiugb.
WELLS BEAT EDWARDS.
The Bay City Man Defeats the
Olympian in a Match
Race.
RACES HOTLY CONTESTED.
C. M. Smith and T. S. Hall Won tat
Amateur Events, Campbell the
Professional.
Last night at the Pavilion the California
Associated Cycling Clubs had charge of the
racing tournament on the indoor track,
and the races were conducted with a snap
! and vim which betokened old hands at
| the business. It was by far the best even
[ ing's entertainment offered during the
tournament, and that this waa fully ap
preciated was evidenced by the enthusiasm
shown by the large crowd present.
The management at the Pavilion has
fully decided to conduct the ladies' three
days' tournament, even though the asso
ciated clubs and the League of American
Wheelmen do not thoroughly approve of
the innovation. The dealers have ex
pressed themselves very thoroughly as
against the ladies' tournament, claiming
that the sport had received a splendid boom
by the amateur tournament, and they fear
that this will be dissipated and the sport
lowered in the estimation of the public by
the women racing.
On the other hand, the management
claims that the ladies are all good riders,
I who have competed before immense au
j diences in the East, the New York, Chi
cago and Minneapolis tournaments being
particularly successful. They are the
champions ol the sport in their branch,
and have oeen brought here at considera
ble exnense. They will b& dressed neatly
in modest riding costumes, and will pre
! sent a very natty appearance. Manager
Wikidel claims that his intention to bring
these people here was known to the Deal
ers' Associated Clubs and L. A. W. otti
cials long before the amateur tournament
started, and that had they then expressed
their disapproval he might have mionsid
ered the matter. Inasmuch as they are
here now, however, be proposes to run the
races Friday, Saturday and Sunday after
noons and evenings, and says he expects
large crowds and knows that the racing
will be exciting and will be conducted in a
manner that will meet with the approval
of the most particular.
As far as the Pavilion itself is concerned
the directors of the Mechanics' Institute
rented it to Manager Wikidel up to and
including next Sunday night to hold cycle
races. They cannot regulate the style or
classes of races he shall hold, and 1 there is
no likelihood that the racing board of the
league would say that no more amateur
tournaments should be held in the Pavilion
hereafter if the coming ladies' tournament
â was permitted. While this was done at
Madison-square Gardens, New York, re
cently, it is unlikely that any such snap
judgment would be" rendered "in the pres
ent instance.
As the matter now stands the dealers,
with but one or two exceptions, claim that
they will move their exhibits this morn
ing. The associated flubs and the League
of American Wheelmen will withdraw all
ijflicials and have no further connection
' with the tournament, while the manage
ment will go ahead and conduct the races
just the same, saying they will suffer
nothing by the Jack of support from those
organizations. The womeu are all fast
riders and the contests will at least be in
teresting from their very novelty.
The match race between J. E. PMward?,
Olympic Club Wheelmen, and G. S. Wells,
Bay City Wheelmen, was one of the draw
ing cards Jast night and the event v.as
worth going a long way to witness. The
pace for the tirst half mile was very slow,
the time being 1:24. Wells went to the
front on the sixth lap and was never
headed, though Edwards was hardly rive
inches behind at the tape. Wells' club
mates made the building shake with their
yells when their champion won, and the
applause waa deafening as lie was carried
to his dressing - room. The time was
2:35 4-5. This was slow, but in reality the
race never began until the sixth lap, when
it was a case of sprint for the tape, an
eighth of a mile.
William Yeoman of the Reliance Club
rode an unpaced mile, flying start, against
time, covering the first half in 1 :(J2 4-5.
He finished the mile in 2:16. Announcer
Knapp stated that both these times were
world's unpaced records for an indoor
track.
C. M. Smith, Garden City, rode a half
mile, standing start, unpaced in 1:07 2-5,
which lowers the best â  previous record,
held by "Walter C. Sanger, the Eastern
champion, of 1:09.
One of the prettiest rides of the evening
was the record trial made by Otto Ziegler
Jr., paced by J. S. Egan and J. P. Jaeg
ling, Imperial Club, on a tandem. The
oacing did not seem fast enough for Zieg
ler at any stage, and the time made was
not as fast as it might have been on this
account. He covered the quarter in 29 4-5
seconds, the half in 1:00 2-5, the three
quarters in 1:32 1-5 and the mile in
'2:07 1-5. The half-mile time was a world's
record, but the mile time has been bet
tered by other riders. Ziegler is in line
condition now and can be expected to
make a splendid showing on the National
circuit this year. He was greeted with
cheers by the audience, it being the first
tune he has appeared in California in
many months.
â Floyd A. McFarland of the San Jose
TToad Club, popularly known as the "Cali
fornia Zimmerman," rode a half-mile
against time, flying start, in 1:03, which is
one-hfth of a second slower than I'eoman's
record, made duriug the evening.
N. Ackerman of the San Francisco Road
Club rode a trial quarter-mile against time
in :29 4-5, paced t>y a tamden, the time
not being under previous records.
The one-mile invitation was run in four
preliminary heats and a tinal. The winners
of the four initiative heats were: 3N\ Ac
kerman, San Francisco Road Ciub, 2:30 2-5;
C. Birdsall, California, 2:36 4-5; Tony Del
mas, Garden City, 2:36 1-5; C. M. Smith,
Garden City, 2:41 3-5.
These four competed in the final heat,
the two Garden City men leading a!l the
way. Smith won in a pretty finish from
Delmaa in 2:36 4-5. iUrdsall was third.
Ti.e race created considerable enthusiasm.
The one-mile consolation race, open
only to winners of trial heats who have
not won a prize during the tournament,
was run in four preliminary heats, two
semi-finals and a iinai. The winners of
the preliminaries were G. H. Crafts, Acme,
2:13 2-5; Russell Cushing, Garden City,
2 :37 1-5; Ed Chapman, Olymuic, 2:31, ana
C. D. Bates Jr., Reliance, 2:40 2-5. T. is.
Hall Jr. was also allowed in the second
srmi-tinal on a protest, he claiming to
have been fouled by Barley, Imperial, in
the second heat-
Bates won the first semi-final in grand
style from Crafts and Cushing in 2:25.
He is oue of the most popular riders with
the audiences on the track to-day, and his
victory was loudly applauded. Cushing
was second.
The greatest of interest was manifested
when the announcement was made that
Oscar Ostm, Olympic Cyclers; J. M. Camp
bell of Portland and W. A. Terrill, Bay
City Wheelmen, would ride a mile pro
fessional race. It was Campbell's and
Terrill's initial entry into the professional
ciass. This was by all means the grandest
ruce of the tournament and excited more
enthusiasm than any event that has been
run daring the meeting. The men set out
at a terrific clip, and femght out the race
every inch of the way, much to the delight
of the spectators. In the sprint down the
homestretch Canrpbell had the inside, Ter

crowd them , both out. \ * The judges gave
the decision to Campbell, Terrill second;
Terrill protested the race, claiming Osen
fouled him and â¢Campbell by taking the
pole. The protest was withdrawn ;after
ward at the 5 suggestion of his * clubmates.
The time was 2:21. : Â.-â '. '
,Then came the match race between T.
A. 1 Griffiths,. Bay City "Wheelmen, and
George Tantau,- Olympic Club Wheelmen,
the distance being live mile?. "This was to
decide the question of superiority between
the two men, they having run a de^ad beat
in one of the heats of the ten-mile cup race
during the tournament. The Bay City, men
were very anxious to win this race, as their
man J Wells had r already defeated one
Olympic, and they felt that if they got this
event their supremacy on the track "would
beunquestioned. So they had brought their
prize mascot, a hugh white bull-dog named }
Mike, along to lend his sonorous bark to
their encouraging yells to Griffith a3 lie
sped around the* track. The Olympics
were therein full force "as -well, to cheer
Tantau along to victory, and the excite
ment throughout the race was intense.
The first mile was covered in rather slow
time, ; 2:49 3-5. ,;, Two - miles were i made in
5:32, which showed a slight increase in the
pace. ; Three = miles were passed and the
time was 8 : 14 2-5, showing a remarkably,
Steady rate of speed, . as the second and
third miles were ridden in. identically the
same - time, 2:42 2-5. - The four miles
were covered in ' 10:54 4-5, the fourth
having ; been ridden in ; 2:39 3-5, ! a
slight increase in the rate. On the sixth
lap of the tilth mile the sprint for home
commenced. Side by side they rode for
the last two laps, Tantau gradually draw
ing ahead at the finish, barely winning
the race in 13:26. The last miie was ridden
in' 2:311-5. " Then it was the Olympics
turn to yell, and they did it with a ven
geance. The Bay Citys did not mourn,
however, for they felt that Wells had fully
upheld their honors by his victory over
Edwards. >â¢ -
The second semi-final was competed by
Edward 5 Chapman. . Olympic, and T. S.
Hall, .Bay City.' ; The. former won by a
scant few inches in 2:20 4-5.
This brought Bates, Chapman and Hall
into the | final heat. They made a | pretty
finish. of the ride, Hall winning by half a

MAY GO TO COURT.
Charlea R. Detrlck Demands a Cer
tificate to Teach Classes in the
High School.
Charles R. Detrick has applied to the
Board of Examiners for a teacher's cer
tilicate fot High School classes. He asks
that he be given the certificate without
examination, under the law which permits
such a course when the applicant has
graduated from an institution of learning
of equal standing with the State University.
He is a graduate of Harvard, and comes
under the law in so far as the university
mentioned ranks with the State University,
but thus far has not complied with the
regulation that requires that the applicant
shall furnish evidence of pedagogical train
ing.
Until this is forthcoming his certificate
will not be issued.
Mr. Detrick intimates that unless he is
granted a certificate he will have recourse
to the courts to establish whether his de
mand is legal.

NEW TO-DAY.
A Human Shell.
AS YOU PASS AMONG YOUR FRIENDS
from day to day you often shake the
hand of a man who is a common shell.
His portly frame may give the appearance
of giant strength, but it is only the handy
veneering of nature, for the man is not
what he looks. Behind the walls of abun-
dant flesh there is no nerve, no reserved
vitality such as you would look for in a
large structured person.
Ask your friends about this â aye, ask
yourself. Every man knows himself in
this respect better than he knows his
neighbor. How well you know your own
weakness! You know that your nervÂ«
power is depleted, and that you would not
be able to justify the healthy opinion your
friends have of you. Your strong looking
frame is a shell, and the force of vitality
that should lie stored inside is gone, wasted
perhaps, in days when you did not know
what it was to feel like a shell, a nerveless
crust.
This was the condition Mr. L. L. Jac-
card, a jeweler in San Leandro, found him-
self in many years a^o, and he went about
feeling that he was not what he seemed
for many years. This is how he tells of it:
SAX LEANDRO, Cal., Sept. 17, 1805.
DR. A. T. SANDENâ
Dear Sir: It is seven months since I pur-
j chased your K<>. U Belt, and 1 can't help recom-
mending it. Certainly it is superior to any-
thing else represented to bo for the same pur-
pose. 1 had varicocele, and the weakness that
goes with it. 1 could not sleep. I had severe -
pains in my hack; in fsct, was gains; into gen-
oral nervous debility from my troubles, -which
had been growing on me since 18t>9. I got re-
lief at, once from the Beltâ ia a week the pains
were gone, Vnricocele was disappearing fast,
and my general uystem getting strouger every-
day. To lay lam about as strong as any man
of my age, 49. and inustsay your Beltia a great
Invention. 1 have already recommended your
Belt to several people, and ull speak highly of
it. Yours truly,
L. L. JACCARD,
Sau Leandro, Alameda County. Cal.
If you wish to be in fact what your
friends think you, get Dr. Sanden's Elec-
tric Belt. It will cure you. Bend for the
book, "Three Classes of Men, free." It
Will be interesting.

REV. ZEPHANIAH MEEK, D.D.
Eminent Methodist Divine Cured of
Nerve Trouble by Fame's
Celery Compound.
\ # Â«PasSt> w,v-;n^vWu'/t â \a i' SjftS'
Rev. Zephaniah Meek, D.D., is a house- !
hold name all over the South. Since 1867 j
he has owned and edited the "Central I
Methodist," tbe leading paper of the j
Methodist Episcopal Church in the South.
He represented hi 3 State at the general
conference.
He was one of the Kentucky Commis-
sioners at the Chicago Columbian Expo-:i-
tion. During his ministry in' the South
he has built and dedicated live chapels.
He writes from Catlettsburg, Ky., where
his home is, as follows:
"I have used several bottles of Paine's
celery compound for nervous troubles re-
sulting from overwork and with immediate
effect, as well as permanent benefit. It is
the best nerve tonic that I have ever tried.
It has also been used in my family with
great benefit."
Tired-out, half sick men and women
wed something more than a mere rest.
They need a positive unmistakable nerve
food; they must have a reserve of nerve-
force to draw from before their heads will
cease to ache and their nerves cease to
tremble with neuralgia.
It is estimated that there are over ten
million nerve fibers in the body.
So long as these minute tissues are kept
fully nourished one lives in blissful ignor-
ance of any such thing as neuralgia, head-
aches, or even a nervous system, but let
one become "run-down" and the nutrition
of the body get low and every one'of these
myriad fibers becomes a "live wire" within
the flesh. Headaches, neuralgia, rheuma-
tism and other forms of nervousness and
debility result directly from a famished
nervous system. Paine's celery compound
is able to correct this faulty condition. It
builds up the nervous system and sustains

it. The brain at once feels the strengthen
ing effects of the superb nutriment. There
are thousands of men and women to-day
who have been enabled to keep vigorously
at work, who must have given up but for
Paine's celery compouncu
Nervou3 affections are a warning to busy
people.
At the earliest sign of reduced nerve
force, inability to sleep, languor or a
trloomy habit of mind, every one should
look immediately to the nutrition of their
nervous system and to the purity of their
blood. Puine's celery compound will at-
tend to both of these urgent needs more
thoroughly and more speedily than any-
thing else in the world. Paine's celery
compound is not to be confounded with
the common preparations, thesarsaparillas
and nervines. Being tbe discovery of a
man of science, Prof. Edward E. Phelps,
M.D., LL.D., of Dartmouth College, it has
the supportof the best physicians. They
prescribe it universally, and the many
sick persons made well by its use proves
that that support is merited.
To tne great majority of business men a
vacation, to say nothing of three months
of complete inactivity, is out of the ques-
tion at this season, even when their brains
demand a complete rest and their nervea
ache and threaten them with prostration.
Now, there are hundreds of business men
and hard-worked professional men in this
city in just this condition. "What are they
to do? Those who sire tired-out, "run-
down" and debilitated at this trying sea-
son will do well to read some of the
straightforward and convincing state-
ments from the men and women who have
been cured by Paine's celery compound.
Nervous weakness vanishes before
Paine's celery compound as mist before
the strong, health-giving rays of the sun.
Convince yourself of the fact at once, if
your health is at all impaired.

curing the past twenty-four hours.
The pressure continues high over the Pacific '
Elope, but is slowly falling to a normal condition, j
An area of high pressure overlies the Liakotas and j
is probably moving eastward toward the lakes. A. i
trough of relatively low pressure is thus formed j
between tile centers of high pressure and an area J
â of low pressure may possibly develop over Wyo- |

fair weather on the Pacific Hope Friday. The !
temperature has remained about stationary over
California, Nevada, Ulan and Arizona. No rain
has fallen during the past twenty-four hours west
of the 105 th meridian.

NEW YORK. X. V., March 12.â The excite
ment in Tobacco subsided to-day, and the transac
tions In the stock were only 61,000 shares: the
price ranged between 78 1 * and 80yÂ±. The falling
off in business was ascribed to the fact that the
. short interest in the stock had been covered.
i General Electric was second in point of activity.
;Tlie stock first advanced to 38' â Â and then broke j
to 36 1 *. with a subsequent recovery to 3~3/ . The :
early advance was brought about by the reports
'that the company and its chief competitor, the
' Westtnfrbouse, had finally reached an agreement
as to territory, patents, etc The directors were to
session all ilay, but up to the close of the Stocc Ex- i
change nothing of an official nature was given

In the last hour, on rumors of a serious hitch,
Ihe stock dropped to 36V<n but near the close a
.rally to 37% ensued. There was little or nothing
Ito the general market, although the unaertone

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 12.â The cold wave as
a bull argument on wheat proved a failure this j
morning, and beyond a slight fractional Improve- I
ment of but temporary duration there was no cvi- j
dence of anxiety for the crops shown in the course j
of prices. Liverpool cables were a' disappoint- <
ment, their tone being on the average quiet and \
easy. Business was slow and hesitating, the active |
periods being short and far apart. Receipts were j
55 cars at Chicago, and 79,610 bushels were taken
from store. Northwestern arrivals were 850 cars,
agtvinsi 310 last Thursday and 273 on the corre
sponding day a year ago. The Cincinnati Price
Current summary had no apparent influence on
prices. Mall advices to Beerbohm published over
a week ago and which were received here this
morning reported that stocks of wheat in Russian
ports were 13.000.000 bushels more than at the j
corresponding time a year aero, and that inland I
points in that country hail 600.000 bushels more. \
The market yielded' to selling. Induced by these I
figures, almost a full cent decline taking place. j
The Daily Trade Bulletin furnished a favorable |
summary on the winter wheat crop. Export clear
ances were 206.498 bushels. Closing Berlin cables
were higher. Other Continental cables were un
changed. May wheat opened from 64 % cto 64 -i + c.
sold between 651-gC to 65V4C and 64VsC- closing at
64V8C, " 4 c to %c under yesterday. Estimated
receipts tor to-morrow, 45 cars.
CORN â Developed nothing interesting, traders
being content to regard wheat as the guide of their
action. An extremely narrow range Of prices indi
cates the character of the business. Receipts 293
cars, were 17 less than estimated. Withdrawals
from store were 18,526 bushels. Liverpool cables ,
were quiet and steady. Export clearances were
111 207 bushels. May corn opened at 30 Vic, de- j
i-l;ned to and closed at 30@30y B e.y B @Vic under |.
yesterday. Estimated receipts for tomorrow 280
cars.
OATSâ HeId practically steady, the tone of j
wheat and corn glvins some impression to the tone
at different times, but not causing any radical
nlteration in values. Receipts were 173 cars and
10,599 bushels were taken from store. May oats
closed a shade under yesterday. Estimated re- ;
ceipis for to-morrow 180 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady to dim. Cash, 89y 2 c; May,
90V"@8Â°^i c - Receipts were 13 cars.
PROVISIONSâ After recognizing a weak hog I
market by declining a little at the opening, pror
duce became steady and ruled so during the sub
sequent portion of the session. May pork closed
12y 2 c lower. May lard 6c lower, and May ribs 5c
to IYiC lower.

: ported the total destruction of his crop of Almonds, j

1 thirty days to fully, ascertain the damage by frost l

Wool is gloomy. Wool-growers have already com
menced shearing in the San Joaquin Valley, as
weather is favorable and grass hereafter uncer
tain. The state of trade In Boston and other East*
crn cities Is so dull and manufacturing interests ho
unsatisfactory that local dealers and speculators
are disinclined to talk business. There is, there
fore, no basis of values and no present' prospect
of active trade. Never in the history of California
Wool has the dealer been so Indifferent as be Is at

Vindicated the l.itw.
A friend of Representative Culberson of
Texas related the following incident:
''When Mr. Oulberson was Prosecuting
Attorney," he said, "there was a criminal
statute universally disregarded. The in
dictment of a well-known man for viola
tion of this law was secured through the
efforts of Mr. Culberson, who presented
the case with more vigor than almost any ,
he Dad ever conducted, succeeding in se
curing a conviction and sentence. to the
penitentiary. Then he left town and no
one knew where he had gone until he and
the prisoner, who had been taken to the
penitentiary, returned together. Mr. Cul
erson had gone to the Governor, ob
tamed a 'pardon and met the convict at
the .penitentiary with it. The law had
been vindicated and there were no more
violations of that statute in Jefferson." â

Oakland Office San Fbabcisoo Call,?
90S Broadway, March 12. \
Rev. James Alexander Smith, the man
who tells stones of coming fortunes to
confiding brethren and who always ex
hibits, in connection with his scheme, a
keen affection for some lady member of
the flock, has "worked" Oakian i and dis
appeared. By a curious coincidence his
disappearance was simultaneous with the
arrival of a constable from lone with a
warrant in his pocket for Smith's arrest
on the same old charge, telony embezzle
ment.
For two days Constable Fenton and De
tective Denny Holland have searched this
city for the Rev. Mr. Smith, but their
search was not rewarded, and to-night the
constable went home. He had been sent
to Oakland because of the information re
garding Smith published in The Call,
stating that he was in this city.
Last Tuesday night Rev. J. A. Smith
was billed to lecture at the Fourteenth
street mission. NVhen the hour arrived
when ne should have commenced the
speaker did not appear, nor has he yet ap
peared Denny Holland was on hand with
the cons:ab;e, but their man had evidently
heard something that caused him to
change his mind.
â¢This man Smith is one of the most re
markable men with whom we have ever
has to deal," said Constable Fenton. '"He
had made a practice for thirty years of
swindling people with whom he associated
religiously, and then clearing out after he
was in everybody's debt, and in some in
stances alter marrying some worthy
woman. In lone he appeared about live
months ago, and at once associated him
self with the people in charge of the camp
meeting. He was at once recognized as a
powlr for good, and he exercised that
power to its fullest extent, but not for
goÂ«id. After a few weeks he broached the
subject of a fortune that was coming to
him through the British Consul of San
Francisco. He said it was $40,000, and as
tie showed all his credentials his story was
believed, aivl several people were deceived
and truste i him.
"Mr. Sybold took pity on the wealthy
and old preacher and "took him to his
house. Smith said he was so anxious to
return Svbolu's kindness that he made a
will leaving the bulK of Jiis fortune to him,
also $5000 to his servant and $1000 apiece
to a numoer of nieces ana nephews. He
engaged a Justice of the Peace to go with
Mrs. Mary Fox-Pearson, Oakland's Favorite Sacred Singer, WhO3e Married Life
Was So Short

him to the British Consul to get the money
when it should arrive.
"About this time some one corresponded
with the Consul and wag told ihct noth- j
ing was known there of Smith. Then a
watch was kept on the rich preacher, but
Smith Boon discovered it. He told the â¢
man who was shadowing him that the
castor wanted to see him at a certain hour
at Bight As the pastor was only a few
feet away at- the time Smith delivered his
message the detective concluded- that all
was right and kept .the appointment.
That uieht Smith borrowed money from
everybody he could and was seen no more.
"While at lone he made love to a very
estimable lady who was moderately well
off. It is said'that he met with encourage
ment and I bat 8 wedding was only a ques
tion of time. Smith made some heavy
purchases and loans on the strength of his .
â¢-auzy fortune story and there are several
people ai lone and Sinter Creek that :
would like to meet him. After his de- ;
parture ire heard nothing of him till I
read in The Call that be was in Oakland.
Detective Holland was keeping his eye on
Smith, knowing his past record, but ; as
soon as I came with the warrant Smith
It was learned to-day that Rev. Mr. Smith
had followed exactly the same tactics in
Oakland that he pursued in other cities
during the past twenty years. He had i
ingratiated himself into the confidence of
the brethren, and stood off bis landlord
and borrowed en' the strength of ; his for
tune. He had also : made engagement
with a man named Smith to go: to tiie
British Consul next Monday ana get the
money. I
When Detective Holland saw Smith s |
victim to-day the man could not be per
iUaded to believe that the preacher was a
fraud, and still believes he will turn up and
I takei;t!:e trh> to the Consul's.
"Smith has left town," said Detective
| Holland to-night, "and several people re
i gret knowing him. He has been doing
this business for over twenty years and
always takes the same name. He cannot
i have gone far, and I expect to hear of his
arrest soon.
'â¢About two years ago he victimized sev
! eral San Francisco ministers and also
j Secretary McCoy of the Young Men's
I Christian Association. He married a
lovely woman and deserted her, and after
I that was arrested in British Columbia for
forgery. He waÂ§ only out of Folaom two

CENSURED THE COMPANY
A Coroner's Jury Declared the Booth
ISabiea' Deaths Were Due to
Negligence.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 12.â The in
quest was held to-night into the death of
the two little daughters of Frank Booth,
v.-ho were killed by an electriccar in West
Oakland last Monday night.
The evidence was the same as has been
published, and the jury found "that death
was caused by being crushed under car
No. 12, and we do hereDy exonorate the
motorman from all blame; and we do fur
ther rind that the said railway company is
blamable for not employing proper appli
ances on their cars for the protection of
human life."
Italo A. Beretta brought in a minority
verdict, which was the same in all re
spects to the other, except the last sen
tence referring 10 censuring the company.
REV. F. PIERSON'S DEATH
Mrs.. Mary Fox Pierson of Oak
land Left a Widow in
New York.
Their Brief Career as Evangelists Cut
Short by the Husband's Fatal
Illness.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. March 12. )
News has been received of the unexpected
and early death of the Rev. Frank T.
Pierson, who came to the coast less than
two years ago and married Miss May Fox,
one of the most popular church singers of
this city. The news that she had been left
a widow after so short a married life has
caused profound regret among her numer
ous friends in this city.
Rev. Frank Pierson has been engaged in
evangelistic work for many years and came
to the coast about three years ago, when he
sang at the revival meetings of Rev. B. Fay
Mills, for which the large tabernacle was
specially erected. He at once became a
favorite, ana before he returned East his
engagement to Miss Fox was announced.
About two years ago the Redding took
place, and the young couple went Last to
engage in evangelistic, work.
Mrs. Fox-Pierson's father dwells in this
city, and is connected with the school de
partment. His daughter gave early prem
ise of rising to distinction as a singer, and
after a musical education the hope was
realized. She went East to study in com
pany with Miss Beatrice Priest-Fine, and,
on their return, both ladies at once entered
on successful careers. Mrs. Fox-Pierson
became very popular as the contralto at
the First Congregational Church. There
was much regret manifested when it be
came known that she was to leave, although
everybody thought that there was a very
successful future ahead of the young
couple.
About a month ago Mr. Pierson was
taken sick and went to a little watering-
place, where it was hoped he would re
cover. The effect, however, was t.:e re
â 'â -â¢Â«â¢ of what was anticipated, and the
young wiie was left a widow. It is said
that fits. Kox-I'iersou will return to Oak
land to her father.

SYMPATHY FOR TENDERFEET.
Would Rather Be a Lawyer Than Be

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,?

Attorney Frances Lane, the lady who
was refused admission to the Alameda
Miss Frankie Lane, Oakland's Woman Lawyer, Who Says the Male Students Fear
the Enterprise of Women and Are to Bo Pitied Rather Than Censured.
County Law Association, has come to the
aid of her sister in experience, Miss Susie
K. Eubanks, who has just been refused
admission to the Associated Law Students.
In an interview to-day she handles the
male aspirants for law honors without
gloves. She said:
"To know how to live we should under
stand the law, because 'law is the rule of
action,' and to know how to live means to
know how to live justly. When these
'youngsters' are unjust it is because of their
want of the knowledge of law and justice â
because of their ignorance â and therefore
they deserve pity rather than rebuke.
"But. to be frank, I really think that
this association, under the fictitious name i
of Law Association, is a shame and a dis- j
prace to the legal profession. Men are J
known by their admitted principles, and 1
say what I do, knowing that every honora-
Die member of my Drofession will sustain
me; and I say, furthermore, that if it
were not for their ignorance they should
be considered by every honorable citizen
of this municipality as" men of dishonora
ble and contemptible composition.
"When the science of" law is viewed
through the classification of Justinian in
those illimitable precepts, 'Live honestly,
injure nobody and render to every one
their just dues,' we see that the lawyer
drilled in the principles of iieal citizenship
and in tne principles of state is the one
most competent of holding public trust
and of guiding our Nationafhelm through !
the never-ceasing tide of the incessant wave !
sweeping the deck of our ship of state. I
That s what I think of my profession. And j
as one who is interested in all those who are >
striving for knowledge, tho-e who are en- j
tering upon the investigation of the sci
ence of jurisprudence, those who are pre
paring for the great and glorious profes- j
sion of law, to those beginners, and
especially to the members of the Law |
Association of the city of Oakland,
I say that you can't make a true law
yer out of a narrow-minded man any more J
than the sculptor can make a marble ;
statue out of a log. The true lawyer has a
broad view of truth and has ever before
him the integrity of his character, and so
you see before we can be lawyers we most !
be men and women: but the* chief objec
tion to the admittance of Miss Eubanks to j
the Law Association seems to be the fact 1
that she is a woman.
"Now, for my part, I would rather be
Frances Lane than the greatest man in
the country, and I would rather be a
lawyer than queen of an empire. The }
fact" thai Miss EubanKs is a woman is a
fact to be proud of, and the fatt that a '
woman should desire admittance to their
asociation should he considered as a com
pliment by members of the Law Associa
lion.
"Am 1 in sympathy with (he idea of ,
Miss Eubanks in organizing- an association
for the study of Jaw? Well. I see no rea
son why an organization could nnt be
formed in fchJfe city, as an evening law \
school for the benefit of those students In i
Oakland whose h'W duties occupy them
during the day, and whose evenings could
well be devoted to the acquiring of a legal
education, which could eventually become j
the law college of California, where it
would be poa-ibie for any to obtain a thor- '
ough and comprehensive knowledge ot the
science of law. I think that would be the |
greatest beneiit that could be conferred \
upon the State of Californiaâ an ideal law j
college, with proper method, where stu
dents could not only learn what the law
is. but how to apply it: in fact, a easel
school. It is a necessity, and I see no !
reason why a lady with the high ability, |
courage and wisdom possessed by Miss \
Eubanks, why she should not. with the
sympathy uf the legal element, enter
upon and successfully carry out an enter
prise which would be" a benefit to the com- |
munity, and especially to the profession."

: basis as in other places. Some of the most
important municipalities and prices sub
mitted are as follows! Fresno, thirty-three
arc lights, 2000-candle power, burning

The gold fever is rapidly spreading in
Oakland, and on all sides one hears of
those who are going to leave for the
Alaskan gold fields. There are many men
giving up good positions to go into that
unknown territory and take their chances
of making or breaking on the result.
Already three large parties have departed,
and yet others are making up parties to
leave in the near future. A few of those
who have gone have been in the employ
ment of mining companies, but most of

LIFE-SAVING GUARD.
One That Has Proven Very Effective In
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 12.â Many ref
erences have been made duiing the past
week to the Clark guard on the Alamedo
and Oakland Electric Street Railroad as a
means of preventing fatal accidents. It is a
very simple affair and is said by those who
have seen it in operation to be the most
successful guard yet invented. It is the
invention of a former motorman named
Clark of that line, and it has resulted in
saving a number of lives.
The guard is a wire-net scoop attached
to the board fender that all cars have in
front of their trucks. It 13 fastened by
means of a number of inverted U's made
of steel, which make it yery easily pressed
down to the rail, but exceedingly difficult
to raise up, so that anything can go under
it. At the outer edge of the net are ar
ranged small wooden rollers, so that when
pressed to the ground they prevent dig
ging into the earth, but rather carry the
fender along so that any obstruction will
be picked up and thrown into the net. â¢
*- \V. M. Kank, manager of the electric
line, said he began to hunt for a guard as
soon as the road opened as, he said, there
would be many, accidents in running cars
as fast as that road does. "We have never
been notified," said he, "that an ordinance
had been passed requiring cars to have
guards. . By the use 01 this, one we picked
up the son of M. F. Tarpey, the capitalist
and politician, as he jumped from one car
in front of another. A smart young lad
attempted to run across in front of one of
our cars and. fell. He was gathered up
with only a scratched arm. An old gentle
man got between - the tracks and was
thrown by one car in iront of another and
gathered up unharmed."
The companies using the guard have to
pay a royalty to Mr. Clark and make them
themselves. It costs about $12 a pair to
manufacture them. It is said the Market
street system of San Francisco wanted to
use the guard, and that Clark demanded
$6000 royalty, which was refused. 'Later,
after they had paid $60,000 in damages,
they came back again, ready to pay the
price, but then he refused and raised the
royalty to $10,000, claiming the guard had
been thoroughly proven and shown to be
very successful, and was, therefore, worth
more than when it was an experiment.

The Youngest Kegent.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 12.â A peti
tion is being circulated among the students
of the State University asking for the ap
pointment as a regent of George D. Boyi,
86. Mr. Uoyd is a San Francisco attorney
and is a graduate of both Berkeley and the
Law College. He is declared to" be thor
oughly posted on university affairs and in

THE CO-EDS WILL ASSIST
They Will Beautify the Grounds

Flowers.
Photographing Perrine's New Comet.
The Stanford Team Will Not
Play Ball.
. BERKELEY, Cal., March 12. -The co
eds at Berkeley are to hive a hand in the
work of beautifying '. the university cam
| pus. They do not intend . that future
j freshmen shall give to the boys all the
praise and glory for making a garden spot
of the university reservation. Though the
young women students decided some time
ago that it would be unbecoming for them
to serve up coffee and sandwiches to the
"student labor brigade" ; that it was im
practicable for them to build a stone side
walk from North Hall to the library build
ing, and that a triumphal arch at the new
Center-street entrance would, be most too
much of an .undertaking, yet they were
': determined to have their names carved
' on the escutcheon of university benefactors.
! To-day, by a unanimous vote of their body,
it was decided to levy an assessment of 50
cents on each woman student in the uni
versity, to be applied" to the improvement
lof the ground around North Hail. Flower
beds will be planted, palms will be set out,
and, if the fund proves sufficient, grass
plats will be laid otf. Professor Hilgard of
the agricultural department has promised
to provide rncessary vines and to assist
in every way possible toward making the
! piece of work an artistic one. Before
the plants and vines can be set out, how
ever, it will be necessary to complete the
work of excavating around North Hall
and to refill the place with toft, pro-'
ductive soil. It is expected that
the student laborers, who will resume their
work to-morrow, will place the ground in
readiness for the plants, but if they do not
succeed in it the co-eds will probably pay
for the work remaining undone.
As announced in The Call last week the
plan of setting out garden plants in the
vicinity of North Hall was that of Regent
Reinstein, which he proposed to the co-eds
j when he found that the other plans for do
ing something toward improving the
campus could not be made to go through.
: All college work will be suspended to
j morrow and on Saturday, in order to give
the student laborers :an opportunity to
complete their half-finished task. /The
squads" for work will be organized on the
same plan as heretofore â under military
command. Work will be continued all day
and until Saturday at noon.

that her team will be glad to play the
Berkeley girls at any place that would be
agreeable to them. She prefers, however,
that the game be played on the ground or

stated in the letter that it will not be
possible for the cardinal wearers to play
the game before the first week in April,

PAID THE PRINTER'S BILL
Charles R. Betrick May Take
a Social Custom Into
Court.
WHO BUYS THE STATIONERY?
Allan St. J. Bowie's Erstwhile Brother
in-Law Threatens a Justice
Court Suit.
Unless the financial relations of Allan
St. J. Bowie and Charles R. Detrick, his
erstwhile brother-in-law, are settled ami
cably, there is prospect of the Justice
Court being called upon to determine
whether the social custom which insists
that the male relatives of the brld6 â her
father, brother or guardian â must foot the
bills for the wedding invitations, an
nouncements', eic, amounts to a legal
proposition.
The wedding of Mr. Detrick and Miss
Bowie was a social event in this City. The
position of the bride's brother as president
of the Western Light and Power Com
pany and as a clubman of note, as well as
the bride's beauty, accomplishments and
popularity insured a fashionable gather
ing, to do justice to which everything
must be in keeping with the importance
of the occasion.
The invitations, announcements and
wedding stationery generally were of the
finest kma the printers' art could produce.
The dainty missives were in great demand,
and those who \ received them considered
themselves exceedingly fortunate. Of
course the stationery hid to be paid for,
and Mr. Detrick says that he found the
necessary coin to liquidate the bill of the
printer.
He further says that it has been the
custom from time immemorial for the
male relatives of the bride to meet such
obligations, and that as a matter of fact
Mr. Bowie agreed to pay the bill, but being
without the necessary funds in his pockets
at the time the bills came in asked nira to
settle, saying he would refund the money
later.
Had the domestic relations of the young
couple continued pleasant it is possible
that the bill would never have been men
tioned between the brothers-in-law, but
they did not, and a separation, took place
after a child had been born to them. ,f Â
Since then the family relations have
been strained and the printer's bill has
come into evidence.
Mr. Detrick insists that Mr. Bowie shall
return him the money paid on the bill â
about $65â and proposes to get it if he has
to go to law. Of course under the circum
stances Mr. Detrick cannot personally ask
Mr. Bowie to pay, but he can have recourse
to a collector, and this he has done.
The claim has been in the hands of J. J.
Raver for some time past and if a settle
ment is not reached soon the complaint
that has already been prepared will be
filed.
Mr. Bowie denies that he owes Detrick
anything on the stationery or for any
other reason and scouts the idea that
Detrick has any valid claim against him.

Buhn Acquitted.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 12.â The trial
of Julius Buhn, who last week got into an
altercation with Hs employer. Henry
Sclmler, thn brewer, came up to-day be
fore Justice Morris and a jury. Attorney
J. E. Barker appeared for the
defense, and Attorneys R. B. Tap
pan and M. W. Simpson represented the
plaintiff. Considerable interest was mani
fested in the case on account of the promi
nence of the parties involved. The testi
mony introduced was rather amusing.
Buhn objected to being likened to a jackass
by Schuler, which caused the row between
t ne two. After some heated words it ap
peared Schuler absented himself from his
employe's presence, procured a revolver
and then came back to annihilate him.
He tried to discharge the contents of the
revolver at Buhn, but it only snapped.
Buhn then knocked Schuler down and in
the fall he got pretty well scratched up.
After being out for several hours the jury
returned a verdict of not guilty.

BURIED BY HIS FRIENDS.
Eddie Farreli Is Laid to Rest
in Laurel Hill Ceme
tery.
THE MOURNERS WERE MANY.
End of a Clever Practical Joker and a
Man of Good Heart, Nerve
and Wit.
The funeral of Eddie Farreli, the well
known rough-and-ready politician who by
bis wit, good nature and big heart m:in
aged tc make friends and keep them dur
ing his fifteen years in public life, took
place yesterday from the undertaking par
lors at the corner of Geary and Stockton
streets.
The political leaders whose rough work
he did when he tirst came into prominence
as a valuable man at the polls or in the
lobby of the Legislature were not in at
tendance. Bill Higdns, Mike Conroyand
Jim Gannon, who educated Farreli in the
kindergarten of politics, have long
beÂ«:n dead. Dick Chute, however, the
other member of the quartet, is still alive.
He did not put in an appearance to bid his
old-time servant good- by.
Nevertheless the dead man bad many
friends, and they crowded the rooms of
the undertaking estsblishment to view his
remains. Among them were: Ex-Senator
Tim McCarthy, Frederick Clough, James
Carr, Charles Stanton, W. P. Howe, Ben
jamin Jones, Dr. Simpson, Joseph Coch
ran, James Sullivan, Walter Bernard, J. J.
Fogarty, E. Bell, Robert Barton, John
Cole. Charles I'sner, William Titball and
Josenb Hoge.
Man}- friends of the dead man sent
llora 1 pieces, the two principal ones being
tokens from Miss Lizzie Dwyei and Mrs.
M. Scliulz.
The funeral cortege wound its way to
Laurel Hill Cemetery, where the remains
were interred, after the performance of the
religious ceremony by Key. Dr. Case.
The pall-bearers were John Cole, Joseph
Cocnran. James Sullivan, James Hynes,
â \\ alter Bernard and J. J. Fogarty.
The mourners represented nearly every
department of the political government
and of mercantile life, and they were
present to pay their last tribute of respect
to a man who when alive was without fear
and who drew no line Â»vhen it was possi
ble to do a good turn for a friend.
His disregard for the conventional was
proverbial, his aim apparently being to
always do something out of the ordinary.
He couid keep a straight face at ail times
under the most trying circumstances when
the risible faculties of tnose wno were
around him and knew what joke he was
perpetrating were uncontrollable. He was
an out and out practical joker and a creator
of bons-mots.
The expression "Colonel Mazuma'' is
from Eddie Farrell. ''Mazuiua' is a
Hebrew word meaning money or coin.
During one of the sessions of the Legisla
ture many years ago. when Eddie was in
the front line, and there was an important
measure before the Senate, Farrell was
looked to by the greedy and grasping for
the signal how to vote. He was not in a
financial position to settle their doubt,
and he kept them off telling them to wait
for the arrival of "Colonel Mazuma." It
would be all right when the colonel ar
rived he assured the legislators. Shortly
afterward Joseph Cochran reached Sacra
mento. Cochran, the lieutenant of Chris
topner Buckley in those days, was intro
duced everywhere by Farrell as "Colonel
Mazuma," to the latter's great annoyance,
and the title of colonel has stuck to him
ever Bince, and the name is still the
synonym of the money disburser of the
fctate Legislature.
One of the practical jokes by which
Farrell is remembered was related yester
day after the funeral by J. J. Fogarty, on
whom it was perpetrated.
Fogarty was quite ill with-pneumonia.
Farrell called on him and then went down
to Bill Mallady's undertaking establish
ment on Mission street. Tom Smith,
or "Smithy," who is the present deputy at
the Morgue, was in charge. '
"Who do you suppose is dead?" asKed
Farrell.
Smithy did not know.
"It's Fogarty, and there is a foreign un
dertaker after the job."
Smithy said he believed that his friend
ship of old standing with Fogarty should
entitle him to the job and he accepted
larrell's advice to hurry up to the house
with ail his lugubrious paraphernalia.
Farrell saw that Smithy got a spare
room to make his display, and then the
undertaker knocked at thestiuposed dead
man's room to have the people therein de-
Jiver him the corpse. Fogarty became so
angered that be jumped out of bed and
chased Smithy out of the house. I a
week he was chasing Farrell around the
town.
Poor Eddie Farrell, the merriest of hiÂ«
set, was Duried at their expense yesterday.
LIGHTING THE WINDOWS
Electric Lamps to Produce a
Moonlight Effect in St.
Ignatius.
Interesting Experiments by Electri
cians With Lights Prove Suc
cessful.
A series of interesting experiments with
electric lights has been made in St. Igna
tius Church on Hayes street, with the pur
pose of obtaining effects altogether original
for parts of the edifice. The last experi
ment almost attained just what was de
sired, and it proved quite satisfactory, as
the result was a suggestion of a moonlight
glow through the. grand stained glass
windows high up in the side walls.
Father Varsi, who has charge of the ad
ministration of St. Ignatius church affairs,
has made up his mind mat electricity
should superscede gas in the illumination
of the church, college and residence, and
â¢with a view of introducing the electricliglit
he is having estimates made of cost and of
comparative illuminating power of the
proposed new lamps;. The matter is still
in a preliminary stage, though the plan is
fairly well fined for incandescent lamps
throughout the Duildings and arc lights of
a special character lor the church.
In describing tlie experiments the elec.
trician said h â  hoped to pro-hie? an â¢ ffect
that might be retried as wonderful, and
possibly.- without an equal anywhere in
America.
â¢'There are two rows of magnificent win
dows at top of- the church." he said;,
"one on each side. These windows, were;
made in .Munich at aco-t of $30,000, but
owing to the construction of the church
their beauty is absolutely ; lo3t after dark.
Then they appear from below as big black
spaces up there in the walls.' Our experi
ments are directed! toward illuminating
those windows. We have blaced arc lamps
behind the windows in the hails or chapels
alongside the church and immediately out
side the windows. E^SBnÃÃ&HtttafÃÃ
"The lights were fixed behind each of the
windows about . ten feet back from I : the
glass, an.! in the chapels: By this arrange-'
we ;t y/e.have' pretty .nearly succeeLied^in
throwing divergent rays on the .glass, but
in the next experiment I propose to have
plain sheets of tin, unbent, and intended
to reflect rays without concentrating them,
so that the light may be diffused over the
â windows.
'The scheme is to have a strong arc lamp
behind each of these windows and throw a
white lisiht through them into the church.
This would bring out the colors and
pis-ture? in the beautiful windows aeamst
the yellow lij;ht from incandescent lamps
in the church. That wi \ be something
like a moonlight effect, and will, no doubt,
be striking, and a great improvement.
PAWNED HER WATCH.

Herbert Love, a "beauty doctor," was
arrested early yesterday morning at his
room, 218 Eddy street, by Detectives
Crockett and Fitzgerald and taken to the
City Prison, where he was booked on a
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement.
He had proposed marriage to Rebecca
Holmes, 19 Taylor street, and on February
24 got her to give him her gold watch to
get repaired. Since then she has been
waiting for the return of her watch, and
as Love put her off with various excuses
she notified the police.'
When Love was searched at the City
Prison a pawn-ticket for the watch was
found in his pocket. He had pawned it
for $10.
Love has been arrested and held to
answer for bigamy and for forgery, but in
both instances he was acquitted in the Su
perior Court.

MRS. SMITH'S INFORMATION.
She Used It for the Harrises, and Now
Bring* Suit Herself.
Mrs. Lillie F. Smith is suing the Sutter
street Railway Company for damages for
injuries received on the defendant's cars
on April 20, 1893.
A brewery wagon bad run into the car
upon which Mrs. Smith rode, and a man
named Harris was killed. Harris' rela
tives brought suit, and Mrs. Smith notified
the company that she would be a good
witness for it. She said she was on the
carat the time and saw the whole thing.
When the railroad company wanted her,
however, she was found to be a witness
for the Harrises, and she proved a good
one. Nothing was said of her own injuries,
however, untii the day before the time lor
filing suit would eJapse. Then she sued
for $25,000 for severe internal injuries and
great bodily pain and mental anguish.
The suit is now on trial.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
4< A Milk White Flag" Amuses
Baldwin Audiencesâ How
. John L. Spars.
Last Days of the Carleton Company
at Grover's Alcazarâ The
Athos Family.
"A Milk White Flag" at the Baldwin
Theater is appealing to the people who
want to enjoy a hearty laugh without
standing any strain on tne intellect or the
emotions. The play has the usual amount
of Hoyt. variety stuffing, but it is better
constructed than "The Black Sheep" or
"The Contented Woman," and even the
variety is good of its kind, indeed to judge
from the applause with which it is received
the audiences enjoy the specialties best.
Frank Lamson's whistling and his imita
tions of a railroad quite bring down th"c
house.
The prize-fighters who are adorning
"The Wicklow Postman" at the Columbia
Theater this week have almost overshad
owed tlie actors in the public estimation.
This is hardly fair, as Eugene O'Rourke is
a really clever Irish comedian, and several
other members of the company do good
work in their respective lines, particularly
Norman Campbell.
John L. Sullivan, however, is loved for
what he used to be, and as he frisks round
in an elephantine round of sparring with
Paady Ryan he is applauded to the echo.
The Carleton Opera Company is in the
last days of its engagement at the Columbia
Theater. For the rent of the week "The
Charity Ball" and "The Mikado" will be
performed.
"The Bailey Continuous Show" opens at
Grover's Alcazar at the Sunday matinee.
There will be vaudeville artists, Jerome K.
Jerome's comedy "Sunset," and a rattling
farce-comedy, "My Wife's Husbands."
An effective performance of "The Silver
King" is being given at the Grand. The
new recruits and the old members of the
company are all doing excellent work and
the staging leaves nothing to be desired.
"The Hoolah" is receiving a good ren
dering this week at the Tivoli. Carrie
Roma is proving, as before, a wholesome
addition to the ranks of the company.
Ferris Hartnian is always perfectly at
home in roles which give license to indulge
his fun-making propensities.
The Orpheum's bill is being greeted with
the usual crowded houses this week. Ward
has proved to be a clever singer and cari
caturist and the Athos family do some
wonderful acrobatic work.
Edward Milton Royle's new romantic
drama, "Captain Impudence," or "Mex
ico/ 1 will be produced at the California
Theater next Monday. The plot is founded
on some romantic incidents supposed to
have occurred during the Mexican war.
Suicide of John Jaggi.
John Jaggi, a milkman by occupation,
committed suicide Thursday evening by
cutting his throat with a penknife in his
room at 422 Third street. Jaggi and
Steve Hossli occupied the same room. Hossli
Kwoke last evening at about 11 :3O o'clock and
found that His friend was lying dead on the
bed and the blood streaming over the bed
clothes from a ragged wound in his
throat an<l a penknife in his hand with which
the deed had been committed. The Coroner
was notified and the body taken to the morgue.
Ji a ggi has been out of employment fur several
teen and through this became despondent
and took his life.

REPUBLICAN WAR
CLOUDS PASSING
The Executive Committee
Does Some Import
ant Things.
ANOTHER CONVENTION.
Resolved That Another State
Central Committee Meeting
Is Necessary.
A CONSTRUING OF THE CALL.
The Friends of John D. Spreckels and
Decent Politics Are Again
Victorious.
The executive committee of the State
Central Committee held ;i meeting at the
room* of the State Central Committee. 41!)
California' street, yesterday afternoon, and
took action which has great significance in
relation to the best interests and future of
the affairs of the Republican party.
The proceedings of the meeting consti
tuted a victory for the friends of John D.
Sjreckrls, who have joined in an effort to
bring about a condition of political affairs
most likely to reÂ»ult in harmony and party
Bncces*. But it was more a victory for all
elements of the Republican party in the
State, irrespective of factions or affilia
tion?, interested in seeing the political af
fairs of the party managed in the interest
of fairness to all elements the highest
good of the party, and in accordance with
Republican precedents and principles.
Those present at the meeting numbered
seventeen, as follows: P. B. Cornwall,
Irank McQuaid, J. EL Mahoney, W. W.
Montnjrue, Leon Dennery, John D.
Spreckels, Isaac Upham. A. B. Lemmon,
Am P. Wells, E. C. Palmieri. Wendell
Easton, H. P. Sonntag, Judge M. Cooney,
\V. H. Chiekering, A. Ruef, James Mc-
Nab, J. C. Daly.
The meeting was an executive one, be
ginning at S p. M.and lasting for over an
hour.
The first matter of Importance that
came up definitely was that of the mean
ing of the Wells amendment adopted at
the meeting of the State Central Commit
tee a week ago last Saturday. Ex-Gov
ernor Sheldon of Los Angeles, it may be
remembered, offered a loce resolu
tion, drawn by the clique of the ex
ecutive committee, which framed the call,
providing in its last paragraph that in
Congressional districts where no Congres
sional committees existed such commit
tees should be created by a committee of
five named in the resolution. This com
mittee of rive would have had practical
control of the Republican affairs of a large
portion of the State,
Mr. Wells of Contra Costa offered ver
bally an amendment providing t >at in
districts where no Congressional commit
tees existed such committees should be
created by The State Central committee
men representing those districts. After
the meeting several kinds of doubts arose
a? to the wording and construction of
Wells' amendment, and one of them con
cerned the right of the "at large" member?
of the executive committee appointed by
M. M. Estee to participate in the selection
of Congressional committees in the dis
tricts where they happened to reside. Such
a risrht has !>een especially exercised by
Chairman P. B. Cornwall, who resides in
the Fifth District.
Alter considerable discussion yesterday
it was with practical unanimity taken
to be the effect of Wells' amendment tliat
ouly n;<mhers of the State Central Com
miitee elected in ihe regular way as rep
resentatives of the various Assembly dis
tricts should have the right to vote on the
appointment of Congressional committees
in districts where such committees do not
legally e.\iÂ«t. This action was taken in
the intere-t of harmony, and it was a de
cision against the appointed members of
the executive committee to participate in
the selection <Â»r Congressional committees.
1 he iifxt and the chief matter of impor
tance which came up was a resolution of
feiwdby W. W. Montague.
In effect it declared it to be the sense of
the i .xecutive committee of the State Cen
tral Committee that, under the call
adopted by the State Central Committee at
its meeting* week ago Saturday, the du
ties and powers of the State Convcution. so
c.illed to convene in Sacramento, Slay 5,
were limited to the selection of delegates
to the National Republican Convention to
be held in St. Louis, June 16.
The resolution declared in effect that
the matters of the nomination of Presi
dential electors, the nomination of Con
gressmen from the various districts, the
nomination of a Lieutenant-Governor (if
the necessity for such a nomination should
appear in the future), the selection of a
new Staie Central Committee and other
party matters should be provided for by
the State Central Committee at another
meeting, which should be held in the com
paratively near future.
The resolutions declared that the duties
of the State Convention not provided for
in me call adopted at the meeting of the
State Central Committee ceased with the
selection of delegates to the National Con
vention.
This resolution was adopted by a nearly
1111811101011? vote. This action does not
definitely tall a second meeting of the
State Central Committee. The power to
call another meeting resides definitely in
the chairman and in a majority of the
committee if they unite in a call fora
meeting. The right and power of a major
ity of the executive committee to rail a
meeting of the State Central Committee,
regardless of the chairman, is a matter of
some doubt among leading Republicans.
But in the absence of v decisive construc
tion of rules and precedents it was taken
generally yesterday to be practically de
cided that another meeting of the State
Central Committee will and must occur in
the comparatively near future. The senti
ment and judgment of a very large
proportion 61 the leading Republicans
<>f the City and the State has a ready been
expressed in favor of this step in the in
terest of harmony, regularity and
party success, and the action of
the * executive committee yesterday
makes anotner meeting practically
certain. Such a proceeding is less con
trolled always by the action of an
officer or a committee than by a
public sentiment, and in this case
Republican sentiment has already
been expressed in favor of another

ABSOLUTELY PURE
meeting of the State Central Committee,
which, queerly enough, held a one-hour
stesslorj and adjourned after doing some
thing which has brought abut much con
fusion and conflict and without doing
certain things which the State Central
Committee was imperatively called upon
i to do.
It was shown yesterday, in support of
Mr. Montague's resolution declaring the
powers and duties of the State Convention
now called, that the call referred only and
1 specifically to the selection of del-
I egates to the National Convention.
j The call declares only this to be the
pantoâ of the call, and only this selection
of delegate* to the National Convention is
declared to be the duty and the purpose of
the Mate Convention, or rather, to be en
tirely correct, the aggregation of Congres
sional conventions called. It plainly ap
peared from :\ reading of the call
j that the State Cei.trai Committee had
i conferred no other powers on the State
Convention, and that a second meeting of
the State Central Conimittee is demanded,
not only by these circumstances, but by
the condition into which the party has
been plunged within the nast few days.
The only other important action taken
at the meeting was the election of a BOO
oesaor to Marcus D. Boruck, deceased.
who was, before his death, the member of
the State Central Committee from the
Fortieth District.
Tli is was the question that best revealed
the alignment of the seventeen members
of the executive committee present. At
this election the Mahoney-railroad element
cast seven votes and the Spreckels element
ten votes.
Sig Kettman was nominated by J. C.
Daly, and the nomination was seconded
by Leon Dennery, both of whom made
brief and vigorous speeches.
Then James McNab nominated Charles
A. Hug in a short and well-framed address
and a vote was taken. Tho3e voting for
Hug were the following: McQuaid,
Spreckels, Montague, Wells. Palmieri, j
Easton, Sonntag, Cooney, McNab, Upham.
Those voting for Bettman were: Corn
wall. Ma honey, Dennery, Lernmon, Chick
ering. Kuef, Daly.
After this action the committee ad
â  journed.
Fourth District.
The Fourth Di-trict Congressional com
! mittee appointed at the snap Mahoney
: Kelly meeting met yesterday afternoon,
Joseph S. Spear. lr. presiding. A commit
! tee was appointed to drait a call for a
primary election and an address to the
voters of the district.
There was appointed a finance commit
tee of seven to collect funds; also a com
mittee to prepare primary election blanks.
The regular Fourth district committee
I elected by the votes of seven of the eleven
j members will meet for organization at 2
I r. M. to-day at '6-7 Market street.

I last evening and elected Charles Berlinger

j of M. J. Donovan, representative of the |

pointed to draft suitable resolutions on the ;
death of Mr. Donovan.

RETURNED FROM GUIANA.
I . IV. Adams' Experience In a Land of
Gold and of liaging Fevers.
L. TV. Adams of San Jose, who for a year
past has been general manager of the New
York and British Guiana Gold Mining
Company in Gtiiana, is at the Grand. He
has just returned from that wild country
bordering on Venezuela and tells a story
full of interest.
There is lots of gold down there," he
said. "That was demonstrated to my sat
isfaction. The mines are on some of the
disputed territory, and 1 don't wonder the
British hate to give it up.
"I was mining in the Barima district, on
the Barima River, and went down there by i
way of New York. I sailed from there to i
Georgetown, the capital of British Guiana, !
by steamer. Georgetown has I*o,ooo peo
ple, a quarter of whom are white and the
others negroes, Indians and Portuguese, i
There is a strict Biitish rule everywhere, i
Even the negroes affect British ways. But
everything is slow.
"From Georgetown I went by steamer
up the Bariraa River to Mount Everard,
which is a day and a half's travel. Thence
we took paddle-boats or batteaus propelled
by negroes. The river is a large one, and is
navigable for steamers even above Mount
Eveiard. The negroes paddled for us six
days and landed us at the mines .
"It is a peculiar region. I judge the mm -
ing district is about 100 miles square, that
is its area is that great, and the ground is
good all over it. The alluvial mines are
rich beyond any I know of. To get down
â¦o the gold the miner has to go through
from eight to ten feet of clay, and the
whole country seemingly is a river bed.
"It is in the rounded stones and the
sand that the fold is found. It runs from
$2 to $16 a cubic yard. I saw lots of claims
that went 18 cents a pan. Of course it is a
lot of work, however, to get off this clay
or adobe.
"Ab for the quartz mines they are in the
mountains, as they are called, but the
mountains are really hills. None of them
are over 250 feet above the level of the sea.
These quartz properties are fine, too. They
average $30 to $40 a ton.
"Notwithstanding all this I wouldn't ad
vise Americans to go there. It is hot, fe
verish and thoroughly unhealthy. . I
buried several of my friends while there.
There is lots of malaria and biliousness
and many different kinds of fever. Ne
groes do most of the work. They get from
$1 to $1 25 a day and are very good miners.
"Wild animals, birds and reptiles
abound. There are tigers, leopards, moun
tain lions, boa-constrictors and other
snakes and the most beautiful birds I ever
saw. There are birds of paradise, exqui
sitjly colored humming-birds and you
might say all the beautiful birds of the
tropics.
"The Guatemalan Government gave a
concession to a German company for an
electric light works in the city, to be oper
ated by the overflow from the lake in the
mountains. In return for this privilege the
company furnishes the city of Guatemala
with light free of charge.
'The German company put up an excel
lent plant, all of which was imported from
Berlin.
"There is one good thing about the
Guatemalan Government. They have no
Chinese question there. Chinamen are
simply and positively refused a landing.
Lots of them are brought down on the Pa
cific Mail steamers, but they never come
ashore. This ha> raised the ire of the Pa
cific Mail people, aiwl out of revenge they
have raised the freight rates to Guatemala
fully 70 percent in the last few months. 'â 
Mr. Adams says his company, which
owns both placer and quartz mines, has
niude money from both and a good deal of
it. The average California miner, how
ever, he thinks ought not to go down
there.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1896.
THE FIFTH IS SETTLED.
Republicans Amicably Agree,
After All, on a Congressional
Committee.
ANOTHER SPRECKELS VICTORY.
Primary Elections in the Fifth Are
Referred to the County
Committees.
The Republican tangle in the Fifth Dis
trict was settled yesterday and the settle
ment was a decided victory for the friends
of J. I). Spreckels.
The eleven members of the State Central
Committee who represent the correspond-
ing number of Assembly districts com
posing that Congressional district met at
Redwood City in the afternoon and named
the Fifth -Congressional committee which
will control the political affairs of that
district as related to the Republican State
"Henry IV at Fontainebleau" â Marchetti's Great Canvas Which Will Soon Adorn the Mark Hopkins
Art Institute.
Convention called for the purpose of
naming delegates to the National Conven
tion.
There are eleven State Central Commit
teemen representing as many Assembly
districts in this Congressional district, and
in this district resides P. B. Cornwall,
member-at-large of the executive commit
tee of the State Central Committee and
chairman of that committee. Mr. Corn
wall on the start assumed a right to par
ticipate in the deliberations of the com
mitteemen from the Fifth District in the
election of a Congressional committee as
provided in the call, and he had further
called and superintended the first meeting
in San Jose last week and had postponed
the meeting from the date to which it was
adjourned on that day. Mr. Cornwall did
not figure in any way in the proceedings
of yesterday. He attended the meeting of
the executive committee in San Francisco,
which during its session ruled against the
participation of committeemen-at-large in
Congressional district affairs, and he was
not represented by proxy at Redwood
City. Those present at the meeting were:
P. A. Bergerot, Charles Manwarins, G.
H. Umbsen (by George Umbsen, proxy),
John H. Dawson, H. G. Fairchild. C. *A.
Hug, William fluff, San Francisco; George
C. Ross, Sun Mateo County; S. F. Ayer, J.
F. O'Keefe (by James Rea, proxy), J. L.
Anay (by George Koen, proxj-), Santa
Clara County.
The minutes of the two previous meet
ings were approved.
P. A. Bergerot, chairman at a former
session, called the meeting to order.
George C. Ross of San Mateo County acted
as secretary. On motion of Rea the tem
porary officers named were elected perma
nent officers of the meeting.
Chairman Bergerot stated the object of
the meeting to be the election of a Con
gressional Campaign Committee, to con
sist of seven members.
Aftei some discussion, on motion of
Aver of Santa Clara County, seconded by
Manwaring of San Francisco, the follow
ing gentlemen were unanimously declared
elected as the Congressional Committee of
the Fifth Conenssional District:
Robert Toplitz. John E. Richards, A. L.
Stetson. C. S. Laumeister, W. H. Law
rence, James Rea. William Moir.
George C. Ross of San Mateo county of
fered the following motion. It was adopted
as a seperate motion, although originally
intended to be passed as a "rider" to the
appointment of the "Committee of Seven" :
Resolved, That it is the sense of this commit
tee that the manner and supervision of the
selection of delegates to the State convention
should be left, in the hands of the county
committees of the several counties.
Rea said that so far as he was concerned
he should not be bound, morally or in any
other manner, by any action that this com
mittee should take. The motion was
finally carried, however, by a vote of nine
to two. Rea and Ayer only voting
against it.
But few besides the State Central com
mitteemen concerned were present at the
meeting which occurred In a room in the
Courthouse. County Clerk C. P. Curry,
Samuel Priest and John Martin were trie
only San Franciscans there besides those
who were members of the State Central
Committee from the Fifth District.
When the committee adjourned it ad
journed to meet at 2 p. m. next Saturday
in the office of John E. Richards in the
Crocker building in San Francisco.
A CALIFORNIA SINGER.
Mrs. Grace Geib FraÂ«er of San Franciaco
Highly I'i-Hlsf.l in Chicago.
Another California singer is acquiring
fame in the East. Intelligence comes that
Mrs. Grace Geib Fraser. who is studying
in Chicago with Mme. Boethe of the Chi
cago Conservatory of Music, has achieved
marked success. The Musical Times of
that city pays this tribute to the California
nightingale: "The grand aria. 'Tv che le
vanitu,' from Verdi's 'Don Carlos,' was
gloriously sung by Mrs. Grace Fraser of
Ban Francisco, a truly dramatic soprano,
powerful and rich. She is undeniably a
gifted singer, and gives promise of becom
ing one of the finest artists America haa
, ever boasted of on the Italian stage. The
ever favorite and popular duo, 'Deh! con
te.' from Bellini's 'Norma.' was most ex
quisitely sung by Mrs. Fraser and Miss
Harrison, whose voices blended beautifully
and most perfectly. Their precision, in
tonation and phrasing were remarkable;
rarely even in Italy's great theaters can
such unison be heard. Its performance
was the sign of an outburst of enthusiasm,
and this duo of artists were recalled again
and again."
THE BANE FORGERS.
They Refuse to Make Any Statement for
Publication, but McCluskey Says
He Is Innocent.
A. H. Dean and Joseph McCluskey, the
Nevada Bank forgers, felt refreshed after
their night's rest, although Dean com
plained about the discomfort of sleeping on
a mattress placed on the floor and wanted
a cot.
Dean refused to say anything about the
forgery for publication only that he would
have to stand what may be brought against
him. He iemarked that McCluskey hart
nothing to do with the case, and should
not have been arrested.
Reuben Lloyd, the attorney for tbe Ne
vada Hank, and Captain Hines of the Pink
erton agency hail an hour's consultation
witt. Captain* Lees yesterday afternoon and
they discussed the case in all its bearings.
McCluskey exprusse'i a desire on Wednes
day night to have an interview with
Captain Lees, and last night the captain and
he were closeted together for over an hour.
The captain said afterward that McClus-
key, although not positively denying any
complicity in the forgery, led that to be
inferred. * The captain referred to a story
published in a St. Paul paper in which
McCluskey gave the name of the third
man in the case who did the fine work, and
McCluskey said he had simply given the
reporter a "fill," as he treated him in un
ungetulemanlv manner.
The two men will be kept in the City
Prison for three. or four days yet before be
ing removed to the County Jail to await
their trial.
HE IS STILL AT LARGE.
There Is Absolutely No Clew
to Berthe Paradis*
Murderer.
The Unfortunate Woman's Funeral
Yesterday Was Largely At
tended by Friends.
Borthe Paradis, the unfortunate woman
who died at the h^nds of an unknown
st rangier last Friday morning, was buried
yesterday afternoon.
The people of her sphere flocked about
her bier and wept. They covered the cas
ket and they tilled the room with choice
flowers and floral pieces. Then, after fol
lowing the dead one to her grave they dis
persed. Each woman went back to sher
den.
So far as the police authorities are con
cerned there is nothing new in the case.
The murderer is still at large, and there is
no immediate likelihood.thathe will b*e ap
prehended.
Cfesar Chalbert, the woman's "protec
tor," was the chief mourner.
Among the magnificent pieces sent as
tributes of affection to the deceased was
one deserving of particular mention. It
was a large pillow of lilies, which upon
close examination displayed in violets the
last sentiments expressed by Gilbert, the
consumptive poet of the French revolu
tion, nearly 100 years ago. It read :
Au banquet <le la vie, infortune convive
J'appanis un jour et jemeurs;
Je meurs et sur la tombe ou lentement jar
rive
Nul ne viendra verser dcs pleurs.
Translated as near as it can be into Eng
lish, Gilbert's sentiment is: "An unfor
tunate truest at the banquet of life I ap
peared and died, and upon my grave no
one will come to shed a tear."
The result of the Coroner's inquest yes
terday resulted in a verdict to the effect
that the deceased had come to her death at
the hands of an unknown.
WANT PKIMARIES.
Republicans of the Thirty - Fourth
Assembly District Want to Name
Their Own Representatives,
Th<e representation to the State and Con
gressional conventions, soon to be held,
was discussed at length by the executive
committee of the Thirty-fourth District
Republican Club last nigiit. There were
but two of the nineteen precincts of the
district not represented, and all seemed in
favor of having the delegates to the con
ventions elected at primaries. A number
of speeches were made, and the following
resolutions were finally adopted by a
unanimous vote:
Retolvcd, That it is the sense of the executive
committee of the Thirty-fourth District Re
publican Club that primary elections should
be held for the purpose of selecting delegates
to the Stale aud Congressional conventions.
Fell Over a Balcony.
Mrs. Annie Dormer, 105 Stockton street, last
night fell over the balcony from rhe third to the
second floor. She was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where it was found that she hÂ»3
escaped with a contused back and an abrasion
of the left arm. She is a waitress in the Seattle
restaurant, 137 Fourth street.
TWO BEAUTIFUL PICTURES
Collection at the Mark Hopkins
Art Institute Further
Enriched.
H. 0. PLATT FOR PRESIDENT.
Slated to Succeed James D. Phelan.
He Is Said to Be Mr. Searles'
First Choice.
The collection of paintings at the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art has been en
riched by the gift of two more beautiful I
picturesâ one painted by the celebrated j
Italian artist, L. Marcbetti, and the other
by the French artist, Jean Anbert. Tbe
paintings arrived at the institute a few
days ago, but as the frames were damaged
in transportation the pictures will not be
placed on exhibition until March 31.
Jean Aubert's subject is "Love and
Spring." It represents a beautiful woman
I strolling among the blossoms of a garden,
i Three little winged cupids at her feet hold
j her gown to protect it from the dew.
The canvas of the Marchetti picture is
48x72 inches. The title of the painting is
MISS ELIZABETH U. YATES.
"Henry IV at Fontainebleau Before the
Tournament." It formerly held a con
spicuous place in the original Mark Hop
kins collection and went from this City
with other art treasures to the Great Bar
rington house. The painting represents a
courtly throng of many titled personages
richly arrayed. There are knights and
ladies of honor, heralds, musicians and
pages. The artist has pITOT the closest at
tention to detail in the handling of the
draperies, and the figures are so grouped
and placed that the whole scene is effec
tive. The picture was painted in 1878 and
first exhibited in Italy.
The annual election for directors of the
San Francisco Art Association will take
place at the institute March SL The an
nual meeting will beheld the evening of
that day and the newly elected directors
will then elect one of the members of the
board to be president.
It is hinted that the present board of di
rectors will appoint a nominating com
mittee favorable to the aspirations of
Horace Platt for the presidency. Mr.
Plan's second term as president of the Bo
hemian Club will expire early in April,
and should there be any slip in the art
school slate, there might be what the
statesmen call an interregnum in Mr.
Platt's career as president.
Many of the members of the San Fran
cisco Art Association have expressed an
opinion in favor of a resolute management
of affairs at the institution. There is at
present no bead or guiding spirit in the
tive or six teachers employed. It is ac
knowledged that there should be central
authority there. Many desire that a
director of superior ability should be ap
pointed to manage the teaching depart
ments of the institution.
As for president of the association one of
the members recently observed : "The in
stitution does need at its head a man of
firm executive ability, yet a popular and
progressive citizen who would seek
to interpret in the highest degree the
mission and purpose of the generous
endowment. Mr. Phelan has certainly
displayed ability, liberality and public
spirit in his administration, but his
case is exceptional. There is danger that
the association will get back into the old
routine of passing around the presidency
as swee.t incense to the dilettante of the
Pacific- Union Club. This year we might
have a good wholesome opposition
ticket, at the head of which would be
placed some prominent art-loving citi
zen of acknowledged public spirit
and personal energy, but word has
been passed Â» round in confidence that
Mr Searles desires the election of Mr.
Platt. The latter recently paid a visit to
Mr. Searles' home in Massachusetts, and
it is presumed that some confidences were
exchanged regarding the future of the in
stitution. Now, Mr. Searles' generosity
has done so much for the institute that no
loyal member would think of runnine
contrary to his slightest desire in the gov
ernment of the institution. From Mr.
Seailes' point of view he may not see the
institution in the light which one obtains
in San Francisco, but there is not the
slightest inclination among the resident
members to depart from his suggestions.
A MID-LENT LECTURE.
â¢â  . \ â .â x\--.:-:i: f ;â â 
Paul B. Hay Speak* to Borromeaif
Council of the Y. M. I. About
"Ben Hur."
Borromean Council No. 129 of the .Young
Men's Institute gave its friends a rare
1 treat last night in the shape of an illus
trated lecture by Paul B. Hay at the
Mission Opera-hall. Mr. Hay took for
his' subject Lew Wallace's famous book
"Ben Hur, or. a Tale of the Christ," ana |
interspersed his remarks . with | selected
readings from that fascinating work. ; The
lecture was rendered particularly inter
esting by the large number of stereopticon
views with which it was illustrated." Some
of these views are veritable works of art,
those representing the adoration of the
wise men, the flight into Eeypt, the vision
of the angels and the exciting chariot race
being particularly worthy of notice.
During the intermission between the
various parts of the lecture a choice pro
gramme of vocal music was given, Miss
Daisy Keene's rendering of Mi'lard's "Aye
Maria" and the song "Weep Not, but Tell
Me, Love," beine especially meritorious,
as was John H. Widman's singing of "The
Holy City." It is understood that Mr.
Hay will be asked to repeat his lecture in
the near future.

MARSICANO DID NOT PAY
He Satisfied His Bakers With
Promises for Eleven
Years.
NOW PLEADS THE STATUTES.
A Wealthy Merchant Whose Family
Ate $289 Worth of the
Staff of Life.
Patrizio Marsicano, millionaire and
owner of the prosperous Overland Pack
ing Company, admitted in Justice Car
roil's court yesterday that he had been
running a bread bill with Queviolo <fc Co.,
bakers, for eleven yearsâ from 1884 to
1895â Without paying for the staff of life,
and moreover that he did not intend to
pay any of it except the amount contracted
during' 1894 and 1895, about $65.
In 1884, when he first took unto himself
a wife, Marsicano looked around for a
baker to supply the family that was to
come. Queviolo <fe Co. suited him, and he
in-structed the tirm to supply him regu
larly.
When the bills were presented each
quarter, or year, as the case might be,
Marsicano told them to come again when
I payment would be more convenient to
him, and the obliging bakers complied
with his request.
So confiding was the firm that the bill
ran eleven years and amounted to $289 79
before the bakers decided to get their
money by any means that presented.
To their astonishment a peremptory de
mand for payment brought an offer of $65
as a settlement in full. Then the firm
I sued in the Justices' Court.
The examination of the millionaire by
Attorney Splivalo, who represented the
plaintiff, was short and to the point.
"What is your business?" asked the at
torney.
"Capitalist," answered Mr. Marsicano.
"Are you a millionaire?"
An objection was sustained.
"Please look at this bill of bread from
1884 to December. 1806, of which you have
a copy, and say if it is correct," said Mr.
Splivalo.
"Yes, it is correct."
"You and your wife and your children
got that broad and ate it?"
"Yes."
"Then why don't you pay the bill, which
amounts only to ?259 79 in eleven years?"
"Because according to the law I am
obliged to pay only for two years and I
huve offered $65 in full."
"Then you mean to say that these poor
bakers must stand the price of nine years'
bread for yourself and your family, free
gratis, for nothing, because they took your
word that you would pay. You are
wealthy and yet you play the baby act,"
said Attorney "Splivalo with, some spirit.
"I don't know," was all the capitalist
would reply.
The case WSfl then submitted and Justice
Carroll gave a verdict for the plaintiffs for
$65, saying that the statute of limitations
operated against all but two years of the
time specified in the bill.
The bakers gave notice that they would
appeal the case to the Superior Court.
An Cntnbpenaed Witness.
The most important witness in the Hefden
feldt case yesterday was Mrs. Lottie Roberts.
She came unsubpenaed. She had seen the ac
counts of the trial in the papers and thougnt
she could do Mrs. Heydenfeldt some good.
Her testimony was to the effect that she had
visited Mrs. Heydenfeldt in the Russ House in
the fifties and she had been Introduced to
Judge Heydenfeldt as Mn. Heydenfe<4' ,s hus
band. '
