PREMIER CRISPI
FORCED TO RETIRE
And With the Leader Go
the Members of His
Cabinet.
FURIOUS OVER DEFEAT.
Throughout Italy There Is Great
Anger at the Abyssinian
Slaughter.
AN UPROAR IN THE CHAMBER.
Statesmen Openly Insult the Ministers
and Will Attempt to Impeach
Them.
ROME, Italy, March s.â Reports from
every city ana town of consequence
throughout Italy show that the excite
ment caused by the Italian reserve in
Abyssinia displays no signs of waning; on
the contrary in many places it grows
greater as the meager details of the defeat
filter through the press from official
sources.
Prime Minister Crispi and other mem
bers of the Cabinet have been compelled
to retire from office, that fact having been
announced in the Chamber of Deputies to
day, amid a scene that can fittingly be
described as pandemonium. The situa
tion in Rome is so critical that the troops
have been confined to their barracks, a
measure of precaution t.iat will enable
them to be hastily dispatched to any part
of tne city should their services be neces
sary to quell disturbances.
The university has been closed, the
authorities fearing that the hot-headed
students would attempt to make a demon
stration which in the present condition of
the popular temper might lead to serious
rioting. Despite the precautions taken,
however, there were several disturbances
to-night, but the police were able to
handle the crowds without calling upon
the military for aid. A number of ar
rests were made for disorderly conduct.
The popular indignation is directed
against Signor Crispi and other Ministers,
who, rightly or wrongly, are held to be
responsible for the disgrace that has be
fallen tue Italian army. As a matter of
fact, however, Signor Crispi did not at
3r i arpro^e the country's embarking
upon the hazardous undertaking of con
quering the ADyssinians, and it was only
the pressure exerted upon him that
caused him to support the policy of ex
panding th 3 Italian possessions in Africa.
This fact counts for little now and the
Prime Minister's enemies, of whom he
ha<= a great number, took advantage uf the
popular feeling to incite the whole Italian
people so far as to pour out the vials of
their wrath upon Signor Crispi and his
colleagues in the Ministry. Their success
was marked, and it is feared now, that the
storm tney raised will assume such pro
portions that it will indeed be a hard task
for the King to secure any man to under-
take the formation of a new Cabinet. There
is a probability that his Majesty will be
forced to request Signor Crispi to again
assume office, in which event there will be
a further and still louder outcry against
him.
The calling out of the reserves of 1872 to
serve with the colors has also added to the
dissatisfaction, and in some instances has
been one of the causes that have led to the
disorderly demonstrations. These reserves
are the men born in 1872, and the calling
of them from their employment will cause
serious loss to them.
Naples, Brescia, Palermo. Catania, Flor
ence, Venice and Sassari were the scenes
last night oi disturbances growing out of
the feeling engendered by the army's de
feat and the opposition to having the
young men of the country forced to throw
aside their means of earning a livelihood
to take up arms. Many people argue that
in view of all the circumstances of the
case it would be foolhardiness for Italy to
further continue her attempted conquest
of Abyssinia, but it is claimed by others
that it is absolutely necessary for the
country to carry out the campaign and
restore her tarnished prestige. They be
lieve that if a decisive blow is not inflicted
upon the Abyssinians the latter will
eventually drive the Italians out of fcry
threa.
The scene in the Chamber of Deputies
to-day was one to be long remembered.
Long before the opening of the Cham
ber enormous crowds of people tnronged
the vicinity and practically surrounded
the building. As tirme went on the crowds
increased andrthe excitement of the popu
lace grew more intense. The streets in the
vicinity of the Chamber were patrolled by
troops, who experienced, difficulty in mak
ing their way through the packed thor
oughfares. The members of the Ministry
in proceeding to the Chamber evaded the
crowd as much as possible. When Signor
Baccelli. Minister of Public Instruction,
arrived in the Chamber he was hissed by
the opposition Deputies and cheered by
those who adhere to the Ministry.
The sitting of the Chamber was of the
wildest character, the uproar beginning as
soon as the Chamber was called to order.
Hignor Crispi announced the resignation
of the Cabinet and stated that the resigna
tions had been accepted by the King. This
announcement was received with pro
longed and passionate applause.
The membejs of the Extreme Left
shouted insults at Signor Crispi, but the
Premier preserved his temper, and when
he was enabled to obtain a hearing de
clared with great firmness that the Min
istry, until the nomination of their suc
cessors, would retain office and maintain
public order.
The members of the Extreme Left gave
notice of their intention to introduce a
motion demanding the impeachment of
Premier Crispi and the members of the
Ministry.
The uproar continued throughout the
sittiiig with more or less volume and the
acenes of excitement and disorder were re
The San Francisco Call.
newed when the President declared the
sitting ended.
Meanwhile the crowds outside were
shouting, cursing, cheering, hissing, howl
ing and groaning. Ten arrests were made
by the ixjlice of men who hissed members
of the Ministry as they came out of the
Chamber, but the hissing and howling con
tinued iust tne same.
The Ministers paid no attention to the
crowd, but escorted by police entered their
carriages and were driven rapidly away.
To-night the demonstrations against
Signor Crispi became more energetic and
the outlook was very threatening. Great
crowds gathered in the streets, and social
ists and radical orators mounting steps,
boxes or anything that would lift them
above the level of the mobs passionately
harangued them, pointing out that all
the evil which has befallen Italy came
from the maladministration of the present
Cabinet. The Prime Minister and his
supporters were violently assailed and the
crowds were worked into a condition bor
dering on frenzy. At this point the police
in force intervened and broke up the meet
ings, not, however, without great difficulty.
.Later a crowd marched to the residence
of Signor Crispi and made a demonstra
tion before it. Every opprobrious term in
the Italian language was hurled at him,
but no attention was paid to the crowd by
those in the house. Then the mob
marched to the offices of the newspapers
that support the Government and shat
tered the windows with stones, bricks and
clubs. In driving the rioters away several
policemen were quite severely injured.
A Milan dispatch to-night states that
there has been another collision there be
tween the police and citizens. The police
used their swords and wounded nine per
sons.
Further advices were received this
afternoon from the Italian headquarters
in Abyssinia. These show that large
bodies of troops who were supposed to
have perished in the rout of the Italian
forces last Sunday are now coming into
the Italian camp.
The Shoans did not follow in pursuit of
the retreating Italians. The troops at
tribute their stampede to the fact that the
Askaris (native troops), under General
Arimondi, turned in the face of the enemy
and rushed back upon their supports.
The Abyssinians followed them in such
hot haste that they became hopelessly
mingled with the Italians so that they all
became packed in a defile, neither being
able to deploy. The consequence was
that there was a general panic among the
Italian troops.
After Signor Villa, the President of the
Chamber, had quitted the chair, several of
the members complained of his abrupt
closing of the session, which had pre
vented the Marquis di Kudini and others
from speaking in accordance with notices
they had given. The sudden ending of
the sitting also preventer! the submission
to the House of the motion of the mem
bers of the Extreme Left for the impeach
ment of Signor Crispi and the other mem
bers of the Cabinet.
One hundred and fifty Deputies, belong
ing mainly to the opposition, later met in
a committee-room. Signor VilJa addressed
them, explaining that his action was dic
tated by a desire to avert disorders.
The members present impressed upon
Signor Villa the deep indignation of the
country against the Ministers and their
policy. They declared the position in
Northern Italy was most serious, and that
a rising was actively threatened in Naples.
Signor Villa promised to inform King
Humbert, and to urge upon him a most
speedy settlement of the existing crisis.
The motion of the members of tiie Ex
treme Lett also embraced a demand for the
recall of the troops.
DEFEAT WAS JORESHADOWEIt.
One Italian Journal Predicted Just What
Han Occurred.
ROME, Italy, March s.â The Esercito
Italiano recently published an article al
luding to the possibility of defeat by the
Italian forces. It said:
"In a battle there are always a number
of factors which cannot all be foreseen
even by the most experienced. On this
basis we must take into consideration the
possibility of a battle, even though fought
under the most favorable conditions, being
lost by our troops. If we won well and
good. But if we should be defeated? On
our side there are 26,000 men against 70,000
men. In the case of a defeat will our army
manage to effect its retreat on the forts
Adigrat, Adiugri, Halay and Sanganetti?
"There is even a worse eventuality to be
faced. Such a defeat could result in the
complete annihilation of our array. We
must count on the eventuality of our whole
army falling into the hands of the Abys
sin:ans. In such a case we must prepare a
second expedition much larger than the
rir>t. When people make war they should
provide themselves with the means of car
rying it on superior to the manner of the
enemy. This we have omitted to do. In the
event of a reverse another expedition
should be put in the field in hot baste,
comprising 40,000 men, 100 elephants and
10,000 camels, and that instead of 20,000,000
of lira, no less than 200,000,000 lira should
be demanded of the Chamber of Deputies."
MRS. JtAA'SiSy- INTERVIEWED.

BERLIN, Gkrmany, March s.â The Lo
kal Anzeiger publishes an interview with
the wife of Dr. Nansen, the Arctic ex
plorer, who, it has been reported, is re
turning from the north after haying dis
covered the pole.
S!:e is deluged with telegrams and letters
wiiich she is unable to nnswer. She un
derstood nothing about the question,
which she left to scientists.
Mrs. Nansen was cool and composed.
She declared that she was confident her
.husband would eventually reach the goal,
but she had no doubt that the recent story
that he had found the north pole was a
canard. Success, she added, could not be
effected so quickly and easily.
Moreover, the statements that had been
received were vague. There was nothing
positive or authentic about them.
In conclusion she said she derived the
greatest comfort and joy from knowing
the world's admiration and sympathy for
her husband.

TERRIBLE IS THE DILEMMA.
Trouble With This Country Further
Complicated and May Culminate
in War.
VALENCIA, Btttnr, March s.â Spanish
hatred of the United States continues to
break forth afresh.
Renewed demonstrations were made to
day and a mob stoned the United States
consulate in spite of the precautions of
the authorities and the alertness of the
police.
When the mob formed its objective
point was the consulate, and extra prepa
rations were made to guard against an
attack.
But almost before the police were aware
of it a flank movement had been executed,
and the howling, yelling horde had
gathered in the street.
Stones were thrown which smashed the
windows of the consulate. The police
made a strong charge and dispersed the
crowd.
THE It IL EMM A TERRIULE.
Senor Segaata Says It Meant War or Ae
gotiation.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 6.-Senor
Regasta, the leader of the Liberal party in
Spain, has sent the following cablegram
to the Journal:
"As things look to me, the dilemma is
terrible. It means either war or negotia
tion, but we cannot desire war, and we
cannot negotiate respecting the situation.
Under the present circumstances that
would be impossible and dishon
orable. However, we will not lose
hope. A declaration of belligerency
would bear the most serious
consequences. Many Cubans would take
the field who are now restrained there
from by the fear that the United States
might abandon the cause of the insurrec
tionâas they did the last time.
"A declaration recognizing belligerency
would lead to the most serious daily
conflicts, first, because we would not
recognize insurgent's as belligerents,
and, second, because Americans would
not observe neutrality. The United States
has not even a law forbidding the sale of
arms to combatants in foreign wars, and
such conflicts on this question would
daily place both nations on the verge of
war. Should war come we shall cer
tainly accept it and fight as no other
nation does. I would then uncon
ditionally help our Government with
all my power and all my party.
This Government ought to have begun
long ago negotiations with a view to
obtaining the views and possible attitudes
of the Europeans nations in such a possi
ble crisis as this.
"Fortunately (he Monroe doctrine,
greatly exaggerated as it is, has as
sumed such an offensive form that
all the European nations are
now interested in refusing to
tolerate the idea of the absolute prepon
derance of the United States on the Ameri
can continent. European trade would be
sentenced to death if such a dom
ination was ailowed. Therefore it
is to be hoped that European
powers will not leave Spain isolated. They
will help Spain; if not from sympathy,
then it will be from their own interests.
"A united protest from the leading Eu
ropean nations cannot fail to im
press the American Government. In
fact, even the knowledge that
the Governments of Earor* are
in common accord upon the matter will
make the United States consider the con
sequences of its hasty resolutions.

MADRID, Spain, March s.â The student
who burned an American flag here yester
day afternoon nas been ordered to close a
year's studies. He will also be criminally
prosecuted.
The other students who were ar
rested for participation in the disorderly
demonstration against the United States
will be handed over to the police courts for

CITY OF MEXICO, Mex., March 5.â C.
F. Meek of 807 Broadway, New York, this
afternoon purchased the Mexico City
street, railway lines, comprising about 1(30
miles, and resold the same to Henry But

that will be equal to the purchase money.

DENVER, Colo., March 4.â Judge Col

Atlantic and Pacific Railroad litigation on

roport of Special Master Marrol. The ex
ceptions were overruled and the master's

Hundreds of Shots Exchanged and the

BELLEFONTE,Pa., March s.â At Wood
ward, a small hamlet twenty-five miles
distant, William Ellinger to-day shot and
killed John L. Barnes and Frank Geist
white, constables, who endeavored to ar
rest him on a criminal charge.
Ellinger then barricaded himself in his
house, and is holding a Sheriff's posse and
a mob of citizens at bay with a shotgun
and dynamite.
At midnipnt the besiegers numbered a
thousand. Hundreds of shots have been
exchanged. John iiusser was shot in the
neck.
Threats are being made to burn the
house, but Ellinger's children are with
him, as also is the body of Barnes. It is
believed that Mrs. Ellinprer has been shot
and mortally wounded, if not killed. She
was assisting her husband in resisting ar
rest by throwing dynamite with burning
fuses from the windows. Just as she
struck a match a number of rifle shots
rang out, and the woman was seen to
throw up her hands and fall backward.
That was the last time she appeared.

HAVANA, Cuba, March s.â All the mer
chants of Cienfuegos have agreed to cancel
the orders given to their correspondents in
the United States, as a protest against the
action of the American Congress on the
Cuban question. The merchants talked of
hol'dins a demonstration, but Captain-
General Weyler prohibited it. The Cham
ber of Commerce met here to-day to con
sider the question of taking similar action.
General Weyler advised the chamber to be
prudent.
There is talk of stopping the exportation
of tobacco in bales and to permit the ex
port of only the manufactured product.
General Weyler has placed restrictions
on the sale of petroleum, and has pro
hibited its sale in the interior towns, which
the insurgents visit.
The following towns in the province o!
Pinar del Rio have been recently burned
by the rebels: Cabanas, Babia, Honda,
San Diego de Nnnez, Santa Cruz de Los
Pinos, Palacios, Pasco .Real, San Diego de
Los Banos, San uJan y Martinez and Quie
bra Hacha.
The gunboat Line, which was carrying
rations to Jibro, on the south coast of
Camaguay, found chains across the en
trance of the harbor. The vessel was fired
upon by rebels, and she replied with her
guns.
Word has been received to the effect
that 400 mounted rebels attacked a convoy
of ammunition near Gibara, province of
Santiago. The insurgents were repulsed
with a loss of twenty-five killed. The
Spanish loss was one lieutenant killed
and seven soldiers wounded-
General Lachambre reports that troops
have reconnoitered in the zone of Jara
hueca and destroyed the huts on the farms
used by the rebels. The troops had an en
gagement with insurgents. The latter left
two dead upon the field.
The manager of the estate, Bernardo
Dnarte. and several of the workmen, were
killed during the engagement, and one
woman was found dead after the fight.
The volunteers at Gibacoa surrendered
the fort there to the rebels. The insur
gents took all their arms and then released
the men. J. Frank Clark.
WHAT WILL CLEVELAND DO?
Washington t>tateÂ»tnen in the Hark at to
the Executive's I'htnt.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â What
will the President do with the Cuban reso
lutions should they ever emerge, from the
conference committees and reach him?
The fact that it was an open secret that
the President and Secretary Olney were
disposed to proceed in a very conservative
manner in regard to Cuban recognition,
fully appreciating the many difficulties
surrounding the question, was stated in
the United Press dispatches of February ,
28 last and has since been repeated and
confirmed from other sources. It is well
understood in Congress that but for a
knowledge of this fact and a consequent
indisposition to embarrass the executive a
joint resolution instead of a concurrent
resolution would have been adopted by
both houses. It is felt by leading mem
bers of the House that the President can
be depended upon to do what is proper,
and that the action of the two houses in
passing resolutions favorable to the Cuban
insurgents gives him the' indorsement of
those bodies should he deem it proper to
issue a proclamation of belligerency.
But will he take such a step? That ques
tion was put to-day by a United Press
representative to a number of prominent
Republicans and Democrats in the House.
The Republicans claimed to have no
knowledge of the executive's intentions
and said the only person competent to
sneak, with intelligence upon the subject
was Mr. Cleveland himself. The Demo
cratic leaders were equally uncertain. In
their opinion the President will study the
situation carefully, and if he should be
satisfied from the official correspondence
that Weyler proposes to inaugurate a
reign of terror in the island, he will in
cline more strongly to accord the insur
gents belligerent rights than would other
wise be the case. It is not believed that
under any circumstances he will act upon
the matter for several weeks, should he do
so at all.
It is asserted that the opposition to the
resolutions would have been greater in the
House had not an aye and no vote been
taken. One Southern Representative of
marked prominence said to-day that the
Legislature of his State had passed a reso
lution calling upon its members in Con
gress to support any proposition expressing
sympathy with the Cubans, and that he
voted for tbe resolutions therefor because,
as he expressed it, he did not desire to fly
in the face of his constituents.
Other members recall the promptness
with which the Spanish Government ex
pressed its regrets for the outrages in Bar
celona on Sunday last, their payment of
tbe celebrated Mora claim some months
ago, the protection afforded by them to
American property interests in Cuba and
other evidences of a desire to placate the
United States, and regret that circum
stances forced them to take a position
which, in their opinion, places this Gov
ernment in the attitude of embarrassing a
friendly nation already impoverished
financially and struggling in the throes of
a civil war.
On the other hand the friends of free
Cuba are emphatic in their assertions that
Spanish rule in Cuba must be ended at
any cost.
LIFE JJV MORRO CASTLE.
Experience of a Former Portland â  Gam
bler Who â¢ Was Imprisoned.
PORTLAND, Or., March 5. â Frank
Westernian, formerly of this city, writes
from New York to a friend here that he
has just been released from a Spanish
prison .in Havana. He says that after
leaving Portland in 1889 he went to Mazat
lan, Mex., remaining there until [ 1892.
There he amassed a considerable sum of
money ? ran J{ 'Â£ a gambling- house. In
1893. the v capital -of Cuba offering a great
opportunity to .sporting men, he went to
Havana, opening a gorgeous palace, in
which all manner, of games were profit
ably conducted. He . did so well that ; he
bought a half interest in a sugar planta
tion near Santiago de Cuba for $20,000.
His house became the favorite resort of
Americans, and later also for Spaniards
under military surveillance. There meet
ings were held unknown to him to further
the interest of the insurgents, and one
night in February, 1895, a file of soldiers
marched into his establishment and placed
every person in the rooms under arrest.
Westerman writes that he was confined
in a damp, vermin-infested cell in Morro
castle, and for the period of three months
after his incarceration he was not allowed,
to communicate with the outer world, and
until, then he â  remained ignorant of the
causes of his arrest. The food given him,
he says, was unfit to be placed before a
hog; he slept on a bunk without bed cloth
ing, and the malarious atmosphere in the
prison made him deathly sick, ; but he
could get no medical attention.
' "When I was arrested ,'* adds the writer,
"I was deprived of all the valuables I had
on my person, with the exception of a val
uable diamond ring which I wore on my
little finger,' and â¢ surreptitiously l thrust
into my mouth. 1 Early in May with that
ring 1 bribed a prison attendant who occa
sionally brought my swill food to convey
a message from me to Consul-General
Williams. Strangely enough, the fellow
proved loyal, and a month later the Con
sul was permitted to have a personal in
terview with me. I told him the truth in
connection with my caseâ that I was per
fectly ignorant of any revolutionary meet
ings have been held in my place, if such
were the case ; that I - was a â¢ neutral resi
dent of the city, having no further inter
ests there than my business, and that I
had no affiliation with either â  side of the
revolution. * Six months elapsed before the
Consul was able to procure evidence of
that nature f&r me, and not until the 20th
of January was I released.
! â¢ â¢â¢The night of my arrest I weighed 220
pounds, ana wnen I emerged from my
living tomb I couldn't tip the scales at
more than 100." â 
The writer concludes his letter with the
statement that when he was arrested on
suspicion of aiding and abetting the revo
lutionary cause he was worth about $50,000,
all of which the Spanish Government has
confiscated. This, he says, includes his
sugar-plantation inteÂ»sts. Notwithstand
ing that his release from prison was a tacit
admission on the part of the Government
of his non-participation in the revolution
still it refuses to make restitution.
Consul- General Williams has submitted
Westerman's claim to the State Depart
ment at Washington, and Westerman is in
New York, where he nas engaged lawyers
to press tiie matter as hard and speedily
as possible.

INSULTS TO THE WEST
All Attempts to Check the Mon

Made in Vain.
SUSTAINED BT THE CHAIRMAN
Laughter and Applause Greet the
Assertion That the White House
Needs a Missionary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 5. -The
dry routine of debate on the question
of fixing the salary of a Federal
Marshal was interrupted to-day by a
rather violent scene precipitated by a
speech from Hartman (R. ) of Montana
resenting President Cleveland's remarks
in his Carnepie Hall missionary speech
Tuesday night, in which he spoke of "cor
rupt and unsafe States and uudesirable
Territories" in the West. Hartman de
nied the right of the President, as he said,
to insult these sections of the country and
the citizens thereof.
He had not proceeded far when he was
called to order by Powers (R. )of Vermont,
who said he did so because there was no
body on the Democratic side related to the
President by affinity or consanguinity
who seemed sufficiently interested to act.
The chairman, Hepburn (R.) of lowa,
ruled that the speaker was proceeding
within the rules, and Hartman proceeded.
Inspired by Powers, Hartman's remarks
were loudly opposed by Miles (D.) of
Maryland, and Sulzer (D.) of New York,
but they could not tear nim off. Tne for
mer appealed from another decision by
Chairman Hepburn, ruling that Hart
man's remarks were not obnoxious to
objection under tbe rule requiring debate
to be germane to the subject under dis
cussion, but all the Republicans and some
Democrats voted to sustain it, the appeal
being overwhelmingly defeated.
In the course of the incident, Grosvenor
(R.) of Ohio, who was endeavoring to get
time in which Hartman could finish his
remarks, became involved in a colloquy
with Sulzer. The latter objected to Gros
venor taking part in the affair, because in
a speech the other day he had admitted he
had no religion, and therefore Sulzer con
tended he was not qualified to discuss the
matter.
Grosveuor responded by denyine that he
bad said he had no religion, but he be
lieved he would rather stana under that
imputation than not to possess the slight
est modicum of common sense. This was
greeted with laughter on both sides.
Hartman finally concluded his remarks,
resenting, both on behalf of the maligned
and slandered States, the President's
statements and asserting that they de
monstrated that the greatest need for the
schoolmaster and missionary was in the.
White House. The Republicans gathered
about Hartman's seat while he was on his
feet and applauded him loudly, while the
Democrats encouraged Miles and Sulzer in
the efforts to prevent him from continu
ing his criticisms upon the President.
The bill making National military parks
public fields for military maneuvers and
drill grounds for the regular army and State
militia, under regulations fixed by the
Secretary of War, was passed.
The rest of the day was spent in further
discussion of the fee and salary amend
ment to the legislative, executive arid ju
dicial appropriation bill, most of the time
upon the section fixing salaries of district
Marshals. But one change was made in
the schedule proposed by the committee,
that of the Marshal of the Eastern dis
trict of Michigan, being increased from
$3000 to $4000.
Dingley (R.) of Maine offered an amend
ment reducing the general maximum com
pensation of the field deputies from $i r )00
to $1500 with authority to the Attorney-
General to pay $2500 for certain special
cases.
Milnes(R.)of Michigan proposed as a
substitute for the section fixing the
salaries of district Marshals, a provision
that all Marshals should be paid a dniform
salary of $4000, except those of the dis
tricts of Connecticut, Delaware, Southern
Georgia, Idaho, Eastern and Western
Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, who
should receive $2000.
Before considering the substitute the
committee discussed various amendments
to increase the salaries proposed, none of
which was successful, except in the case of
the eastern district of Michigan, where
the amount was changed from $.TOOO to
$4000.
A substitute for the section offered yes
terday by Ogden (D.) of Louisiana was
read. It makes two grades of Marshals,
"members of one to receive $3000 and the
other $4000. Ogden's substitute received
but two affirmative votes.
Milnes (R.) of Michigan urged the adop
tion of his substitute in a brief speech,
which was followed by a sensational and
entirely unexpected incident.
Hartman (R.) of Montana, getting the
floor, made a formal motion to strike out
the last words and said: "On the third
day of March, in the city of New York, in
Carnegie Hall, at a religious meeting, the
President of the United States cave utter
ance, or is reported by the public press to
have given utterance, to language which is
on the clerk's desk to have printed in the
Record, but certain portions of which I
now read and bring to the attention of the
committee:
" 'But it is not only as your fcilow-citi
zen,'(quoting the President), 'km as t'..e
chief executive officer of your Government
that I desire to speak, for I am entirely
certain that I serve well our entire people,
whose servant I am, when I here testify
to the benefit our country haa received2
through home missionary effort, and j
when I join you in an attempt to extend j
and strengthen that effort. * * * It must !
also be confessed that removal from old j
homes r.nd associations to a new and more
primitive home h.is a tendency among hon- j
est and respectable settlers to smother sent- â¢
pies and indifference* and to breed tolera- I
iion of evils to christianizing and elevating
agencies. These conditions, if unchecked
and uncorrected, fix upon the new com- \
munitv by their growth and expansion a !
character and disposition which, while
dangerous to peace and order in the early ;
sta/res of settlement, develop into badly j
regulated municipalities, corrupt and un- j
safe Territories and undesirable States.'
"Mr. Chairman, whatever may be my
individual opinion of ths President of the
United States matters not and it would
not be proper for me to state it here. For
the high office of President I have a su
preme regard. The legitimate function
of that officer is limited in our constitu- â 
tion and law?. Under the constitution and j
laws 1 deny the right of the Chief Execu
tive to wantonly, in public address or ;
otherwise, insult any of the citizens of any i
State of the Republic over whom he has !
been called to preside. He has been ad- j
vised that a majority of the citizens of
certain Territories were antagonistic to his
peculiar financial and economic views,
and under the cloak of a supposed relig
ious address, before a religious organiza
tion and with gross impropriety, and for
the purpose of preventing the right of
Statehood to which they aspire and are
entitled, gave utterance, as Chief Execu
tive, to this unfounded slander against
those citizens and States of the Republic
whose interests he is sworn to protect and
uphold.
'The percentage of crime in these States
Territories," continued Hartman,
"will not exceed that found in the State of j
New York, where tne President seems to j
think all virtue resides.
"Mr. Chairman," said Hartman, "on j
behaif of the citizens of the States and
Territories thus slandered and maligned
by tne Chief Executive, I here and now
repel the insult and respectfully suggest
that the greatest need in this country for
the work or the missionary, the school
master and the statesman will be found at
the White House." [Laughter and ap
plause.]
Hartraan, however, was not permitted
to conclude without interruption. He had
spoken but two or three minutes when !
Powers (R.) of Vermont, in a halting, in
quiring fashion, looking toward the Dem
ocratic side, rose to a point of order, say- I
ing: "If there is nobody on this floor;
that is related to the President by ties of
affinity or consanguinity, social or po
litical â "
Hartman (impatiently)â Mr. Chairman,
I want the point of order stated. I don't
propose that my time shall be consumed
in this way.
Powersâ The point of order, Mr. Chair
man, is that it is not permissible here to
reflect upon a co-orainate branch of the
Government. The President is a co-ordi
nate branch of this Government and I
think the language of the gentleman from
Montana is not only
Hartman â I am not reflecting upon the
President, Mr. Chairman; I am reflecting
upon the sentiments which the President
utters, and I have a right, to do that.
Powersâ l want a ruling on the point of
order, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman â The chair does not feel i
that he is called upon to rule on that
point; that is to say that the remarks of
the gentleman from Montana come within
the rule. [Applause.]
Powersâ l do not propose, however, to
be classed as an administration man.
[Laughter.]
Miles (D.) of Marylandâ Mr. Chairman,
I make the point that the remarks of the
gentlemin from Montana are not relevant
to the matter pending before this commit
tee and I call for the reading of the rule
on that subject.
The chairman â The chair will state to
the gentleman from Maryland that in the
live minutes' debate tue largest liberty is
accorded to gentlemen to discuss questions
and they are not held rigidly to the rule
which he invokes.
There was much confusion at this point,
Republicans crowding about Hartmanand
some of the Democrats sustaining Miles,
who appealed from the decision of the
chair.
The question being taken the decision of
the chair was sustained.
The chairman â The gentleman from
Montana will proceed. [Laughter.]
Before Hartman had finished, the rive
minutes allowed by the rules had expired,
but he was continuing, nevertheless, when
the chairman rapped him to order and an
other scene, or rather continuation of the
previous one of confusion and disorder,
ensued.
Hartman â I ask unanimous consent for
one minute moro.
Several members objected.
The chairmanâ Does the gentleman from
Montana withdraw his formal amend
ment?
Hartman â I do.
Gfosvc-nor (R.)of Ohio â I move to strike
out the last two words, Mr. Chairman.
Sulzerâ l object, as there is another
amendment pending.
The chairmanâ The other amendment
has bpen withdrawn.
Richardsou (D.)of Tennesseeâ The gen
tleman cannot withdraw it without unani
mous consent.
Sulzerâ Can a gentleman withdraw an
amendment with unanimous consent? 1
object.
The chairmanâ To what does the gen
tleman object?
Sulzerâ l object to the gentleman pro
ceeding. He is out of order.
Grosvenorâ He is not going to proceed
out of order, I can assure the gentleman.
[Laughter.]
The chairmanâ The chair has said that
debate is in order.
Grosvenor â I think, eir, that mv friend
from Montana (Hartman) overlooks one
very important fact. When we get on our
feet in a deep religious frame of mind
[laughter] and it is a new field â when we
are plowing in virgin soil, aa it
were [Laughter.]
Sulzerâ l raise the point of order that
the gentleman is out of order, because the
other day on this floor he said that he had
no religion. [Laughter.] Having no re
lipion himself, I submit that he is incom
petent to discuss the question of the re
ligion of any otner man.
Grosvenorâ l never eaid that I had not
any religion; but I would rather be with
out a very large modicum of religion than
without tLe slightest intimation of com
mon-sense. [Laughter.]
Sulzerâ l am sorry fcr a gentleman who
has neither.
Grosvenor â It is always unfortunate
when a gentleman is possessed of
such a knowledge of his own fail
ures that he constantly advertises
them to the public. [Laughter.]
Now, Mr. Chairman, I have been diverted
from the serious argument that I was
about to present, [laughter] and I yield
the balance of my time to the gentleman
irom Montana.
Erdmann (D.)of Pennsylvaniaâ l object
to the gentleman from Ohio pledging his
lime.
Richardson (D.) of Tennesseeâ l believe
! it has never been donÂ© under the five
i minute debate.
The chairmanâ The chair thinks it is
: often done. The chair recognizes the
; right of the gentleman from Ohio to yield.
Hartman concluded and soon after the
: consideration of the salary sections of the
! amendment was ended. Several efforts
' were made, however, to change the pro
â  vision fixing the compensation of special
I field Deputy Marshals at a per diem for
! the time employed to a salary definite in
! amount, but they were unsuccessful.
Ding ley (R.) of Maine proposed an
I amendment reducing the maximum com
! penaation to be allowed these field Deputy
Marshals from $2500 to $1500, except in
certain special cases, where it may be
'â  $2500, but shall not in any event exceed
three-fourths of the fees received. This
was agreed to after some debate over the
opposition of members of the Judiciary
Committee.
The committee, without having com
pleted the bill, arose.
Cameron (R.) of Illinois presented from
the Committee on Appropriations a bili
appropriating $9(5,000 to reconstruct the
bridge over the Mississippi Kiver at Rock
Island. 111., and it was passed.
The House at 5:20 o'clock adjourned
until to-morrow.

cf the Church.
DENVER,! Colo., March 5. â Cardinal
Satolli visited parish schools, hospitals and
colleges and received calls and petitions
all day.and every moment from early mass
until a late hour this evening was

petition was presented by a delegation of
wealthy churchmen calling the attention
of the Cardinal to the troubles arising out
of the years of controversy between Bishop
Matz, his priests and members of the
church in Denver. The oarochial schools,
the complaints of the priests and the de
plorable financial chaos of the diocese
were all reviewed, and the Cardinal was
asked to make a decision that would effect
ually end all these difficulties. Cardinal
Satolli said that he would be in Washing

no time in examining fully the Denver
situation. He departs to-morrow for
Kansas City.

After fighting for eighteen years Rev. Jo
siah Fisk, an old and almost impoverished
litigant, has won a settlement of judg
ments against the city of New Orleans for
services during the reconstruction period.
He was virtually a law partner of Presi

appointed him a district attorney in New

to investigate and punish all outrages
brought down on him the wrath of the

SOUTH HOLLAND'S ZOBS.
Destruction of the Town of Asperon by
lire.
AMSTERDAM, Holland, March 5.â A
conflagration started last night in the
small town of Asperon, South Holland. A
strong wind was blowing which aided
greatly in the spread of the flames and
rendered fruitless the efforts to extinguish
the fire. The greater part of the town has
been destroyed and it is probable that the
fire will not be extinguished until the
whole place is destroyed. A large num
ber of cattle have been burned to death.
So far as known at present no human be
ings have Jost their lives.
FIRE AT S\ELLIS6.

an adjoining barbershop, was destroyed
by fire last night. The excellent work of
the fire brigade prevented the destruction
of the greater portion of the town, which
was at one time seriously threatened. The
total loss will amount to $6000, with 50 per
cent insurance. The origin of the blaze is
unknown.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
WOULD RISK WAR
WITH SPAIN
Chandler Favors Prompt
Recognition of the
Cubans. .
ACTION IS NOT TAKEN
Report Made Recommending That
the Senate Agree With
the House.
MORE DELIBERATION URGED.
Hawley Says the Nation Is in No
Condition to Enter a Conflict
With Europeans.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â ln
the Senate to-day the conference report on
the Cuban resolutions was presented by
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, the re
port being that the Senate recede from its
disagreement to the House resolutions and
agree to them as a substitute for its own
resolutions. The report was made a
special order for Monday next at 2 o'clock.
The fall text of the concurrent resolution
is as follows:
Resolved, By the Senate, the House of Repre
sentatives concurring therein, that in the
opinion of Congress a state oi public war exists
in Cuba, the parties to which are entitled to
belligerent rights, aud the t'nited States
should observe a strict neutrality between tht>
belligerents.
Resolved, That Congress deplores the destruc
tion of life and property caused by the war
now waging in that island, and believing that
the only permanent solution of the contest,
equally in the interests of Spain, the people of
Cuba and other nations, would be in the estab
lishment of a government by the choice of the
people of Cuba, it is the sense of Congress that
the Government of the United S(ates should
use its good offices and friendly influenco to
that end.
Resolved, That the United States has not in
tervened in the struggles between any Ku
ropean Governments and their colonies on this
continent, but from the very close relations
between the people of the United States and
those of Cuba, in consequence of its proximity
and the extent ot commerce between the two
peoples, the present war ia entailing such
losses upon the people of the United States
that Coneress is of the opinion that the Gov
ernment m Â«he United States should be pre
pared to protect the legitimate interests of our
citizens by intervention, if necessary.
In a bri&f discussion that took place
while the report was before the Senate,
Chandler (R.)of New Hampshire said that
in his judgment the resolutions were not
sirong enough, and that he was in favor
of action for the recognition and mainte
nance by the United States of the inde
dependence of Cuba "at the risk of war
with Spain."
Hawley (R.) of Connecticut, who had
voted for the Senate resolutions, intimated
that there were considerations which
should make Senators stop and think be
fore voting. Tne United States, he said,
had exposed itself to unfriendly criticisms
in Europe and it wa3 within the bounds of
possibility that this country would find
itself involved in war, not with one nation,
but with more than one. He ridiculed the
talk about an American army of five or
ten millions, and asked what those men
would do without coast defenses. Would
they march down to the sandy beach of
New Jersey and offer themselves as food
for the enemy's cannon? They could do
nothing else.
During the morning business Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska introduced a joint
resolution authorizing the President of
the United States to issue a proclamation
recognizing the political independence of
Cuba and asked unanimous consent to
submit some observations at this time.
"Let it uo over," Hale (R.) of Maine in
terposed.
The Vice-President asked whether there
was any objection to Allen's request.
Hale did not object, but hoped that the
Senator from Nebraska would not ask
unanimous consent unless there was some
distinctively good reason why he should
submit remarks at this time.
Allen warned Hale that if he objected
there would be no unanimous conFent for
anything Hale brought in this session.
A spirited colloquy, participated in by
Allen, Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire
and Hale, followed.
"1 could have delivered my speech in
two minutes," Allen finally remarked,
with an air of disgust. "I now withdraw
my request for unanimous consent."
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, present
ed the conference report on the Cuban
concurrent resolutions. The report is that
"the Senate recede from its disagreement
to the amendment of the House, and agree
to the same."
Hale (R.) of Maine inquired whether it
was Sherman's purpose to have immediate
action on the report.
Sherman disclaimed any desire to force
the report through to-day if Senators de
sired to debate it.- He had no objection to
the report going over, and he suggested
that it be made the special order for 2
o'clock on Monday next.
After further debate by Call (D.) of
Florida and Hawley (R.) of Connecticut
Sherman's proposition was agreed to, and
the conference report was made the special
order for 2 o'clock on Monday next.
During the proceedings in the House
early in the day the Senate's request for a
conference on the Cuban resolutions was
agreed to, and Speaker Reed announced
Hitt, Adams and McCreary as managers
on the part of the House.
ROUTINE OF THE SEA' ATE.
Poatponement of the Seating of JDupont
of Maryland.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 5.-In
the Senate to-day Mitchell of Oregon,
chairman of the Committee on Privileges
and Elections, continued and finished the
argument begun by him yesterday in sup
port of the committee's report declaring
Henry A. Dupont elected Senator of the
United States from the State of Delaware.
The matter went over till Monday next,
when Turpie (D.) of Indiana, representing
the minority of the committee, is to-pre
sent an argument on the opposite side of
the question. __
Allen's resolution declaring that United
States bonds and legal tender notes are re
deemable in gold and silver coin went
over until such time as he may desire
action upon it.
Hansbrough(R.)of North Dakota, ere- j
ating an art commission of the United
States was taken up, but objection was
made and the bill went over without final
action.
The Senate then proceeded to the pas
sage of unobjected biih on the calendar,
and passed about twenty-five of them.
Among the bills passed was Senate bill
to pay $43,858 to the heirs of the late John
Roach, for labor and material on the
United States gunboat Dolphin.
Also House bill to incorporate the Su
preme Council of the Thirty-third degree
of Scottish rite Masonry for the southern

D&AIXAGE OF TUE VALZEF.
Captain Gillette on Xavigttiion Along the
Sacramento Hirer.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â The
Secretary of War submitted to the House
in response to a resolution a letter from
Chief Engineer Craighill transmitting the
report of Captain C. E. Gillette on the sur
vey made of the Steamboat channel, and
from the junction thereof with the Sacra
mento River to the mouth. The river and
harbor act of 1894 provides for this pre
liminary examination with a view to the
improvement and enlargement of the
navigable channel and to increase the
capacity for flood discharge.
Captain Gillette considers that as far as
navigation is concerned Steamboat Slougn
is not worthy of improvement by the
United States, which opinion is concurred
in by the division engineer, Colonel Suter,
and by the chief of engineers.
Respecting the incapacity for flood dis
charge, Captain Gillette gives a resume of
the existing conditions and of the compli
cation connected with ttie problem which
involves the entire drainage of the Sacra
mento River Valley, and he states that the
problem is one that concerns the United
States, in that a solution adopted for drain
ace might be injurious to navigation, or
that works for navigation might be inju
rious to drainage, or the questions might
t>e solved separately at a cost greatly iv
excess of the amount required.
He considers, therefore, that further ex
aminations and surveys ana accumulation
of information will be necessary, and is of
the opinion that these investigations will
cost |8000.

THE VALUE OF SIGHT
A Millionaire's Offer to the Man
Who Can Cause the
Blind to See.
Will Give $1,000,000 to Anyone Who
Restores to Him the Use of
His Eyes.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 5.â "1 will
give $1,000,000 to any man who will re
store to me my eyesight. I will walk out
of the store and hand him the keys."
So said Charles Broadway Rouss, a
multi-millionaire, in the office of bis ten
story granite building at 551 Broadway to
day.
Mr. Rouss' eyes had been failing for
some time, and day by day it was with
greater difficulty that he could distinguish
objects. To-day he declared they had al
most totally failed him.
"The only thing visible to me," he said,
"are the huge pillars. I can just discern
the hazy outlines of two," pointing to the
supports immediately before him. "I am
in.total darkness, yet, as I still see a light
mist. But my doctors say that in a short
time all will be night."
He is paying -the" penalty of twenty
years of overwork. Mr. Rouss, whose for
tune is roughly estimated at $10,000,000, is
now 60 years old. He was born in Woods
boro, Frederick County, Md,, fought under
"Stonewall Jackson, and after the war
came to New York penniless. A goodly
portion of the fortune he amassed has
been spent in benefactions.

Coup d'Etat.
THE KING IN THE PLOT.
With the Crown Prince He
Entered the Legation and
Issued Decrees.
TWO MINISTERS ASSASSINATED
These Peculiar Acts of Murder and
Diplomacy to Cause Trouble
for Japan.
TOKIO, Japan, Feb. 18.â The coup detat
in the Korean capital on the 11th of Febru
ary was the most carefully planned and
thorough affair of the kina that has taken
piace in tnat peculiarly restless country
for many years. It. is impossible to sup
pose that its direction was Korean.
European bands and European brains
must have played a chief part. There is
no longer any doubt that the first act of
the drama was the provincial emeute of
January. Diligently represented as a mere
popular outbreak, due to the people's un
willingness to obey the Government's hair
cutting edict, the uprisings thioughout the
country are now seen to have been planned
for the purpose of drawing the troops
away from the capital, and thus leaving
the coast clear for the conspirators. So
quietly and craftily were all the prepara
tions made that not the smallest indica
tion of what was in progress reached the
Cabinet Ministers or the Japanese lega
tion.
Broadly speaking, it was an anti-pro
gressive coup, having for its leader Kirn
JPyong-si, the head of the Conservative
party. The King was easily persuaded to
associate himself with the affair, on the
ground that full vengeance would De
wreaked on every one connected with the
murder of the Queen. The Russian Charge
d'Affaires also must have been fully cog
nizant of the conspiracy, and must have
promised -to further it by protecting the
King.
During the night of February 10 a de

with them a field piece, entered Seoul.
The}- had marched up from Chemulpo,
having landed from two Russian men-of
war dispatched there a week previously.
There was no ostensible reason for the
coming of these soldiers. Everything, so
far as could be seen, was perfectly tranquil
in Seoul. But within a few hours of their
arrival at the legation the conspiracy
culminated.
The King and the Crown Prince pro
ceeded to the Russian legation. Secure in
that asylum, now strongly guarded, his
Majesty issued a proclamation declaring
that the country being perpetually dis
turbed by treacherous rebels, nothing re
mained but to seek the protection of the
foreign representatives. He also directed
that seven prominent statesmen, leaders
of the Party of Progress, be decapitated
and their heads exposed. Meanwhile,
orders had been secretly issued for tbe ar
rest and assassination of the Minister
President, the Minister of Agriculture, the
Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister
of War.
The first two, suspecting nothing, were
seized without difficulty and decapitated
immediately in front of the police head
quarters,whence their bodies were dragged
through the streets and finally burned out
side the city. The Minister of Home
Affairs and the Minister of War seem to
have effected their escape, but nothing is
known as to their whereabouts. A new
Cabinet was formed, the King issuing his
mandates from the Russian legation, the
compound of wnich was guarded, within
by Russian marines, without by Korean
troops. As for the every-day life of the
city, it suffered no disturbance. Only the
leading politicians ot the kingdom were in
volved.
Of the seven men whose decapitation
was ordered by the King, two were already
in Japan. How it fared with the rest re
mains to be discovered. Most significant
was the action taken with respect to the
provincial insurgents. The troopa dis
patched against them by the former Cabi
net were immediately recalled; proclama
tion was made that the people's true rea
son for revolt had been to avenge the mur
der of the Queen, and a general amnesty
was announced. Thus, within a few
hours, every adherent of the party of
progress, that is to say, the pro-Japanese
party, was driven from ollice, and the ad
ministration was placed in the hands of a
Cabinet headed by Kirn Pyong-si, the
leader of the conservatives, and composed
exclusively of anti-progre3sive, pro-Rus
sian politicians, the seat of Government
being transferred from the palace to trie
Russian legation. Strange to say, not one
of the proscribed politicians sought asylum
in the Japanese legation or consulates.
Neither was the coup d'etat accompanied
by rioting or anti- foreign demonstrations;
Russian co-operation averted anything of
that Kind.
The news of these events caused much
excitement in Japan. Unfortunately direct
telegraphic communication between Seoul
and Tokio was interrupted at the time.
The line runs overland from Seoul to
Fusan, and thence by cable to Japan.
Whenever an insurrection occurs in the
southern districts of Korea one of the first
acts of the rioters is to cut the telegraph.
They had done so several days before the
coup d'etat of the 11th of February.
Hence the only mean 9of communica
tion was by telegraphing first to Chemul
po, and then effecting a junction with
Fusan, 400 miles distant, by steamer. But
as one steamer only happened to be avail
able at Chemulpo her departure with the
first batch of telegrams created a break of
several days in the chain of communica
tions.
The House of Representatives in Tokio
had desisted from its daily sessions until
the 17th of February, being engaged in
committee work solely. But when the
opposition learned what had happened in
Seoul, they thought that they saw a chance
of striking a fatal blow at the Cabinet. It
is true that no accurate details of the
Korean coup d'etat were yet to hand, but
that did not seem to signify much. The
House met on the 15th of February, and
at once the opposition, by way of prelim
inary to introducing a resolution of want
of confidence, began to address questions
to the Government, accompanying them
by speeches of a moat uncompromising
nature. Their chief contention was that
whereas the war with China had been
undertaken for the explicit purpose of
securing Korean independence, as definite
ly announced by the Mikado'l NWript,
Korea did not now enjoy any semblance
of independence, her Kinjr and Crown
Prince Mtogj lodgti in the Russian lega
tion under the miard of Ru.-.-iau soldiers,
and her Cabinet gf!tÂ»ttttfl holding their
conferences under the shadow of the Rus
sian flag.
It was plain that II the debate continued
ana if the resolution of want of confidence
were introduced, the laiitfuaf;eof the oppo
sition politicians might very gravely com
promise the empire's foreign relations.
Accordingly, just as one of the most de
nunciatory orators was approachiug the
peroration of his speech, an, imperial re
script was handed to the President, sus
pending the Diet's session for ten dayt.
By the expiration of that period calmer
counsels will probably have prevailed,
and, at all events, full information will be
available.

The Colombian Cruiser Cordon* Meet*
With â¢ Vis imp.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 5.â A special
to the tribune from Perth Am boy, N< J.,
says :
While returning from a trial trip outside

the Mount Loretta Mission. Besides the
crew there were forty guests on board.
The vessels lifeboats were lowered and
the guests landed at the Mount Loretta
wharf. The Cordova is only two or three
feet in the imid, and it is believed that she
will float easiiy at biah tide. It i 3 ex

Comment of the â¢â¢ l.irhtinrj World" on
Dunrnren's Expulsion.
LONDON, Enc;., March s.â ln Us current
issue the Yachting World accused the
New York Yacht Club of having shown
viniJictiveness in the expulsion from mem
bership in the organization of Lord Dun
raven when it was well aware that his
Lordship had written and mailed to the
club his resignation.
The Yachting World expects, it says,
that the yacht societies of Great .Britain
will express their opinion of the action of
the New York club in no minced lan
guage, and insists that the Royal Yacht
Squadron, as backers of Lord Dunraven's
challenge for the America's cup, are
bound to take action in the matter. The
Royal Yacht Squadron, the paper declares,
cannot afford to have its leading member
dealt with in such a manner without in
dorsing his expulsion or loudly protesting
against it.

large number of the "sons of men" who
vitv larite numfx r <>i Ik* **Â«SJB *>1 niri â¢ >
know what the trite phrase "What a difference in
[ the morning" means by bard experience. Usually
: It refers to a 100 free Indulgence in the kind of
' beverages which produce that condition which has
! been so aptly described by "the Irishman" as be-
j lag "under the sweet Influence," and the great
army temperance workers scarcely seems to
! have reduced the army of '-moderate drinkers"
; to any extent.
Whether alcoholic liquors should be abandoned
entirely except us medicines is still a debatable
as well as a much-debated question, and all the
talk has resulted so far in leaving the average man
(he with a normal mmd i no farther ahead then he
\ was before. The more bitter partisans o* the
totul-abstiiience party attribute all the troubles
that we poor mortals sutler to "the demon rum,"
but it la fairly well established that this is goiug
much too lar. Take the experience of Mr. K. C.
Taft, for instance. This gentleman lives in Stowe,
Cal., and, although he has novcr been a hard
drinker or a licentious man, yet he came very,
very near to passing to that "bourne from which
no man returneth." Ho had the good fortune to
be treated by the noted specialists of the grand old
Hudson Medical Institute; and, although they saw
that his case was .serious enough, probably lie will
never know in what grvat danger he was. But Mr.
Taft is on his feet again, and while he does not
know of all that danger he is still conscious that
they did him an immense amount of good. Be

HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, San Fran-

and had cooled up that would leave me. Ou!aitiÂ«

praise for what they have done for me. I received
your circulars and will hand them around to
triends and surferers. : Yours very truly.
K. C. TAFT.
It Is gratifying to the specialists to see their
efforts warmly appreciated, and when they receive
hundreds of letters of this sort every week it is no .
wonder that they are impelled to do more and
more for all poor sufferers.
George U. Bent of Rochester, Cal., writes: "From
the way I am feeling now I aon't think I will need
to take any more medicine than what I have now."
Frank Minturn of St. Louis, Mo.: "I have not
felt so well in five years as I do now."
Robert Asburst Jr.: '-.My brain i 3 clearer and
my intellect brighter, and I would not take $500
to relapse into the state I was in before commenc-

'1 hese are just a few excerpts from the thousands
upon thousands that are filed away in the archives

BUSINESS MEN
Resolution of the New York
Chamber of Commerce
Sent Out.
"SOUND" MONEY SOUGHT.
It Is Urged That Future Pros
perity Hinges on the Single
Standard.
SILVEE, OF COUBSE, OPPOSED-
Pressure to Be Brought to Bear to
Influence the Big National
Conventions.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 5.-The
Chamber of Commerce's special commit
tee on sound financial legislation to-day
introduced in the chamber a resolution in
the form of an appeal to commercial and
business men throughout the L'nited
States, calling upon them to stand by
sound money in selecting delegates to both
National conventions. The resolution,
which was unanimously adopted by the
Chamber of Commerce, is as follows:
To the Commercial Bodies and Business Men
of the United States: The Chamber of Com
merce of the State of New York believes that
the time has now come for a movement on the
part of the commercial bodies and all men,
â whether engaged in farmfng, manufacture or
trade, who are lnierested in the commercial
prosperity of the United States to remove from
political agitation the question of the perma
nence of the standard of value upon which all
the business of this country is transacted. It
invites co-operaiion to this end in an effort to
create a strong public opinion in behalf of an
unequivocal declaration by the political con
ventions of both of the great parties in favor of
the maintenance of our existing standard and
of the elimination of all doubtful expressions
in respect to the reopening of the mints of the
United States to the free coinage of silver.
Tne time is past it it ever existed for any
halting or doubtful phrasing to express the
meaning of political parties upon this im
portant sulrjert. We must have no platforms
that can be interpreted to mean one thing in
one part of the laud and another in another
part of the land.
It is important to every busiuess man, pro
ducer and wage-earner to cut a stop to the
enormous cost to the Government and to all of
our people ret-ulting from the continuance of
the agitation in favor of the free coinage of
silver, which stands in the way of a revival of
confidence and National business prosperity.
Therefore we ask all citizens to unite in a
vigorous effort to urjje the selection of dele
gates to the political conventions of both great
parties who will advocate clear and distinct
platform utterances in favor of the main
tenance of the present gold standard of value.
The time is short and action ought therefore
to be all the more prompt and determined.
CO>G'f-JSSSIOSA.L CAMPAIGN.
Officers i\ fted by the Republican Com
mittee at the Capital.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â These
officers were elected at the meeting of the
Republican Congressional Campaign Com
mittee to-night to serve for the ensuing
two years:
J. W. Babcock of Wisconsin, chairman;
L. D. Apsley of Massachusetts, vice-chair
man; William B. Thompson of Michigan,
treasurer.
Execu.ive committeeâ J. H. Hull of
lowa, Joseph Cannon of Illinois, J. H.
Sherman of New York, Jesse Oveistreet of
Indiana, David Mover of Nebraska, and
senators Pritchard of North Carolina, Pet
tigrew of South Dakota and Mitchell of
Oregon.
Representative W. B. Hooker of New
York presided. Mr. Apsley nominated
Mr. Babcock for his former office of chair
man. In doing so he spoke of the ability
displayed by Mr. Babcock in the last cam
paign and ventured the assertion that a
large proportion of the Congressional dis
tricts that were carried by <he Republi
cans was the result of Mr. Babcock's
clever work.
Mr. Hull of lowa, in nominating Mr.
Apsley to succeed himself as vice-chair
man, was equally complimentary. He as
sured the committee that Mr. Apsley had
displayed excellent ability and that he was
entitled to share with Mr. Babcock the
honors of the campaign, addinc that dur
ing his four years' connection with the
committee the duties intrusted to these
officers had never been more satisfactorily
performed. f
Mr. At>sley in reply referred to the pre
dictions made by him during the progress
of the last campaign. He showed that
from the reports received by the coro
mittee he was enabled intelligently to
foreshadow the defea; of such veteran
Democratic leaders as Hoiman of Indiana,
Wilson of West Virginia, Blaud of Mis
souri and Springer of Illinois, and a)so to
indicate the election of Mr. Morton in
New York by a majority of more than
100,000.
Mr. Babcocli created some merriment,
after indorsing all that Mr. Hull had said
of his coileague on the committee, by con
cluding with the declaration that "the
best thing about Apsley is that the latch
strinK of his pocket-book always hangs
out."
Mr. Hooker of New York then renomi
nated Mr. Thompson of Michigan for treas
urer, improving the opportunity also to
show how creditably he, too, had dis
charged the duties intrusted to him.
Babcock and Apsley were then in-
Etructed to select an executive committee,
with the result as above announced, Mr.
Hull of lowa succeeding Senator Mander
son of Nebraska as Chairman.
Before the meeting adjourned Mr. Apsley
auain addressed his committee associates,
saying that tne political outlook at the
present time promises an overwhelming
Republican victory next autumn. He pre
dicted as a result of those elections a
Kepublican House, Senate and Executive.
ST. JOIIX BOYLE XAMEV.
Mmm the Choice of the Kentucky BepubU
cnnÃ for Senator.
FRANK FORT, Kv., March s.â St. John
Boyle of Louisville was to-night unani
mously nominated by the Republican cau
cus for United States Senator amid much
enthusiasm and within, the sound of the
voice of Senator Blackburn, who was re
sponding to a "call of the sound-money
Democrats. Shortly after convening the
caucus the rollcall showed sixty-three of
the (Mxty-eight Republican ; mem of
the Legislature present. Senator Dingus
asked that a few minutes be allowed for a
conference. The caucus then took a
twenty-minute recess.
On reconvening Dingns, in a short
speech urging party harmony, withdrew
the names of Senator Deboe and Judge W.
H. Holt, who received 32 and 29 votes re
spectively on the last ballot taken last
night.
At this instant every voice went np with
a shout for Boyle. For five minutes there
was a wild scene, and cheer after cheer was
given. St. John Boyle is a life-long Re
publican, and is a descendant of a distin
guished family, being a grandson of Gov
ernor Owsley and related to ex-Chief
Justice Mills.
The Republicans are enthusiastic and
claim that Boyle will be elected on to
morrow's ballot. The nomination was
within the grasp of Deboe, and his conces
sion to Mr. Boyle was for party interest,
as it is conceded Mr. Boyle will receive all
the votes of the party.
To-day's vote resulted: Blackburn 55,
Deboe 40, Carlisle 7, Hunter 4, and the rest
scattering.
ASII-McKISLEV MEM BOLT.
They beleet Deleaate* of Their Own to the
St. Louia Convention.
TALLAHASSEE. Fla., March s.â At
4:30 o'clock this morning, after an all night
session, the anti-McKinley element in the
Republican Convention, made up of friends
of Morton, Allison and other candidates,
bolted and held a convention of their own.
The bolt had been carefully arranged and
a hall provided for. The bolters carried
with them only seventy-nine of the 230
delegates in tne convention.
The regular convention, made np of
friends of the Ohioan, then selected the
following delegates at large to St. Louis:
J. E. Lee, J. G. Long, E. T. Skinner and L.
W. Livingston. Resolutions were adopted
in favor of the Government aiding in the
construction of the Nicaragua Canal. A
resolution of sympathy for Cuba was also
adopted.
The bolters selected the following dele
gates at St. Louis, who are for anybody to
beat McKinley: E. R. Gunby, H. W.
Chan-ller, H. S. Chubb and S. H. Coleman,
Tne fight for McKinley was led by Na
tional Committeernan John G. Long and
ex-Chairman Dennis Egan and Secretary
Joe Lee of the State Committee. Â£. R.
Gunby and H. S. Chubb led the fight for
Morton and were aided by the friends of
Reed, Allison, Quay and other candidates.
MVST FIGHT FAIRLY.
Opposition to the Methods of McKinley
M- it in Illinois.
CHICAGO, 111., March s.â Chairman
Jamieson of the Republican State Com
mittee of Illinois openly declared to-day
that the work of the McKinley people in
getting the delegates from the Seventh
Congressional District instructed for the
Ohioan would prove costly for the candi
date. He accused the McKinley agents
and editors of a breach of faith, claiming
the understanding with Major McKinley
when he was here recently was that no
delegates from Illinois were to be in
structed to vote for him, but if the votes
of Illinois were needed to nominate him
they would be so cast as a unit. Chair
man Jamieson asserted that from now on
McKinley would get no instructed delega
tions from lilinois unless he won by a fair
fight.
TO SUCCEED CAJUPBELL.
Dr. Jamieaon Will Be Chosen on the
Illinois Committee.
CHICAGO. 111., March 5.â A special
meeting of the Republican State Central
Committee has been called for next Mon
day in this city by Chairman T. N.
Jamieson on account of the sudden death
of W. J. Campbell, the National Commit
teeman. Dr. Jamieson is the choice of
the Republican leaders in the State, and
he will probably be selected to fill the
vacancy, while not relinquishing his posi
tion at the head of the State Committee.
The delegates to the National convention
from Illinois, who ordinarily choose the
National comniitteeman, are expected to
ratify the selection when they meet in St.
Louis, and Dr. Jamieson will then have
charge of the National and State cam
paign in Illinois.
HAD TWO CHAIRMEX.
One Convention in Mississippi Wound
!'/> in a time.
JACKSON, Miss., March s.â The Sev
enth Congressional District Republican
Convention here to-day wound up in a
row, as did the State convention last nipht
between the Hill and Lynch factions. Two
chairmen, one white and one black, were
selected and both rushed for the platform,
followed by their respective backers. Pan
demonium reigned, but both chairmen re
mained on the stand and organized and
selected two delegations to St. Louis. The
Hill delegates are J. M. Matthews Sr. and
George Granbury; Lynch delegates, J. M.
Matthews, nephew of the foregoing, and
T. E. Richardson.
The other districts have not been heard
frcni. No instructions were given, but
botn delegations are understood to be for
McKinley.
XO OPPOSITIOX TO HAIXER.
There Is Considerable Activity Among
JSebraska Politicians.
LINCOLN, . Is ebb,, March s.âCommit
teemen from the Fourth (Congressman
Hainer's) District met here to-day and de
cided to hold the Congressional conven
tion at York, April 9. There was no op
position to Mr. Hainer for renomination,
but his advocacy of Manderson as opposed
to McKinley was not indorsed, and the
McKinley men carried the day, directing
that the same convention which nomi-
nates a Congressman select delegates to
St. Louis.
Free silver Demscrats of the First Dis
trict to-day decided to hold theii Con
gressional convention at Lincoln, April 22.
The executive committee of the Prohibi

BULLETIN OF THE Z. A. W.
The Racing Board Asks a Co-operation
of thÂ« Wheelmen.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 5.â
Chairman Gideon of the L. A. W. has
issued the following bulletin:
In assuming charge of the racing interests of
the country, the L. A. W. Racing .board of 1896
ai-ks the co-operation and assistance of every
cyclist in the country. We promise absolute
impartiality in the enforcement of the rules,
both for and against the racing man and
the race promoter. Every honest racer, be he
amateur or professional, is entitled to our
protection and friendship. We shall enforce
the rules to the best of our ability, and hope
for an active season of clean, honest sport.
The new rules for the government of cycle
racing are being prepared as rapidly as possi
ble. The principal changes are in the abolition
of class B, riders formerly in that class having
been reinstated by the action of the National
Assembly. In the amateur class the acts that
formerly transferred to class B will hereafter
professionalize. No rider may compete for a
prize valued at more than $35 or more than
100 miles from home, except wiihin the limits
of his own division. Professionals may not
compete for a prize greater than .SIOO. except
by special permit.
Both classes are required to see that every
meet at which they ride is sanctioned by the
L. A. W. Changes have been made In the fees
for sanctions, $25 being the amount for Na
tional circuit meets. $10 for open meetings, $2
for athletic meetings scheduling but two
events. No fee is charged for closed club or
school meets, although it is necessary that the
same shall be f uliv sanctioned heretofore. L.
A. W. clubs are exempt from all sanction fees.
Chief consuls are requested to send in recom
mendations for handicappers for their re
spective States.

eran George Godfrey boxed a fifteen-ronnd
draw with Nick Burley of California at
Music Hall to-night under the auspices of
the City Point Athletic Club in the pres
ence of 4000 spectators.
The spectators declared the fight a fizzle.
On account of the strength of his oppo
nent Godfrey fought cautiously, but he got
in some good hard left and right nand
punches on Burley's jaw. Burley did not
reach Godfrey's face or body moie than a
dozen times during the fight. Neither
man did any effective work during the
last six rounds, and the spectators jeered
them to their hearts' content.
The referee declared the fight a draw.

FUNERAL OF A. PRELATE.
Cardinal Satolli Sends Condolence for
Kenricfc's Death.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March s.â Archbishop
Kain to-day stated that the funeral of
Archbishop Kenrick will take place at
the cathedral next Wednesday morning.
The body will be taken fiom the Arch
episcopal residence to the catheral next
Sunday evening, where it will lie in state
until Wednesday morning.
Archbishop Kain this afternoon received
a telegram from Cardinal Satolli, who is
now in Denver, which reads: "Under
present circumstances my visit will be de
ferred. Accept my condolence."
This is regarded as evidence that Cardi
nal Satolli will not be present at Arch
bishop Kenrick's funeral. Word was re
ceived from Archbishop Ryan of Philadel
phia stating mat he would arrive here next
Saturday night and would preach the
funeral sermon.

CALIFORNIA'S EXPOSITION.

This Scheme Has Been Denounced by
Prominent Men of This State
and City.
NEW YORK, N. V., March s.â "We
will hold the fair later in the year," said
Walter H. Wickes, general manager, to
day In speaking of the postponement of
the proposed California exposition ar
ranged for May in Madison-square Gar
den. "This blow came unexpectedly.
"It was the intimation that we would
meet with no opposition from Californians.
In fact, we have been receiving letters
from representative men in all parts of the
State, indorsing the proposition, pledginc
their aid and asking for space.
"Our idea of giving this exhibition was
to please both California and New York.
Trie people here are much interested in
the Pacific State, and the people of Cali
fornia are anxious to show their resourcea.
"They were not given the display they
wished at the World's Fair or the Atlanta
Exposition. Their own Midwinter Fair
did not draw the people they wished to
reach. This seemed the best plan to give
them satisfaction.
"After we had made all arrangements
for the May exhibit vre learned that the
San Francisco Board of Trade was to
have a fruit and flower exhibit
there at the same time. We tried
to come together in this matter,
but after some negotiations we could not
agree. I believe this is the cause of the
attitude of the Board of Trade, and that
the newspapers have been influenced by
that Dody."
Mr. Wiclces was one of the chief aids of
Mr. Burnbam at the World's Fair. He
was superintendent of construction. He
and his associates will lose a large sum of
money because of the postponement.
SUIT AOAISST A CASTOR.
Mis* Mulhern, an Ex- Assistant, De
mands Heavy Damages.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.. March 5.â
Miss Mary Mulhern wants $ 20,000 damages
from Rev. Dr. John L. Jackson, pastor of
the Fountain-street Baptist Church, the
largest, most fashiorablo and one of the
wealthiest churches in the city. The bill
has been tiled in the Circuit Court and sup
pressed.
The plaintiff was formerly assistant pas
tor of the church, but was dropped a year
ago and another woman put in. A few
months later she preferred charges against
the character of her successor ai;d against
the alleged relations which she asserted
existed between the pastor and his new as
sistant.
Dr. Jackson demanded an investigation,
and Roger \V. Butterfield was appointed
chairman of a committee to investigate.
The committee exonerated Dr. Jackson
and recommended that Miss Mulhern be
expelled. This was done, and she has now
begun suit for damages.

Remarks of a Judge on the Arrest of
Bucket- Shop Employe*.
CHICAGO, 111.. March s.â When the
persons indicted on the charge of maintain
ing and being employed in bucket-shops
were giving bonds yesterday before Jndge
Goggin.the Judge stopped court and ad
dressed every one in the room about as
follows:
"This thing of the Civic Federation, or
combination, or whatever it is, indicting
clerks and young women who are endeav
oring to make an honest livelihood by
their ski 11 is an outrage against decency
and civilization, if such a thing as civiliza"
tion exists, and I am beginning to doubt it.
"I shail relÂ«ase the ladies in this case
without bail and upon their recognizance,
and if thÂ«y have a lawyer in court to-mor
row I will quash the indictments against
them. I think the Grand Jury that in
dicted these young ladies should be itself
indicted."

SHOT AND KILLED
NEAR PASADENA
The Victim Was Enamored
of His Slayer's
Wife.
A FEUD OF TEN YEAES.
John A. Barker Was Distracted
by William Handell's
Persecution.
AND HAD FEARS FOR HIS LIFE.
Barker Surrenders to the Authorities,
Claiming Justification for
the Deed.
/
PASADENA, Cal., March s.â John A.
Barker, living near the Arroyo Seco, in
the outskirts of Pasadena, shot and killed
William Handell of this place this morn
ing shortly before 10 o'clock.
There had been a feud between the two
men for ten years. Handell had paid Mrs.
Barker some attention before she was
married and seemed possessed with the
jealous determination to break up her
family. He was vicious In all his meet
ings with Barker, and the latter has been
in fear of his life for years. Handell has
lately been thought insane, and several
months ajjo he so persecuted Mrs. Barker
with his attentions that her husband was
obliged to interfere.
Handell had on several occasions threat
ened to shoot Barker, and if Mrs. Barker
had not come between the two men the
deed would have been committed last sum
mer, when Handell drew a revolver on two
occasions with the purpose of shooting his
enemy.
Barker had Handell arrested for threat
ening hh life. Handell was placed under
bonds to keep the peace, and being unable
to furnish the necessary security he was
committed to the county jail for six
months. While serving tins sentence he
twice attempted to commit suicide, but
was discovered both times before he ac
complished the deed.
Last Saturday he completed his sentence
and on being released was at once arrested
on a minor charge pending when sent to
jail. He was convicted Saturday and re
turned to the jail Sunday. Yesterday he
made hia escape and evidently proceeded
at once to the house of Barker, who had
heard nothing of Handell's escape from
jaii.
This morning upon coming back to his
house about 9 o'clock after a walk up the
canyon Barker found hia wife and chil
dren crying. In answer to his questions
Mrs. Barker said that she had a short tima
before seen Handell pass the house and
she ielt sure he was there to make trouble.
Mr. and Mrs. Barker went out and looked
about to tind him, and after a time the
former became convinced from the tracks
that he was in the brush and watching for
him.
.Barker then went to the house and got
his Winchester rirle, and returning up the
canyon he soon discovered Handeil lying
in the brush where he could watch the
house, and believing that he was only
waiting for a favorable opportunity to kill
him Barker became excited and tired
twice, with fatal effect. He then returned
to his home and went to town, delivering
himself up.
Barker walked to the city from the
scene of the tragedy and was in quite an
exhausted condition when he arrived
here. He first called at the home of the
constable and finding that efficer absent
from home he went to the City Marshal's
office and surrendered himself to Officer
Buchanan, who at once placed him under
arrest and locked him up in the City Jail.
Officers then started for the scene of the
tragedy, which occurred in the Arroyo
Seco, about seven miles northwest of Pasa
dena.
A Call representative called on Mr.
Barker shortly after his arrest, but he re
fused to make any statements as to the
commission of the crime. He said he be
lieved he was perfectly justified in what he
had done. That he had done all in his
power to avoid trouble with Handell, but
that he had dogged him so persistently
that he could endure it no longer.
"Is Handell dead?" was asked.
"I have not consulted an attorney yet
and have no statement whatever to make,"
said Barker.
The body of Handell was found at 3
p. m. lyine in the brush on the canyon
side. He had been shot in the back, one
ball passing through the heart, the other
two inches below. Death was instantane-
ous. The body was brought to Jfasadena
and an inquest will be held Friday morn
ing. Barker was formerly employed as a
barber at the Hotel Green, but has been
ranching lately. Handell was a day la
borer and unmarried.
STORIES OF CRUELTY.
Investigation at the Protestant Orphans'
Home, Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., March s.âWil
liam F. Dunn gives an account of what he
alleges to be acts of cruelty on the part of
the managers of the Protestant Orphans'
Home toward the little inmates of the in
stitution. On investigation there appears
to be no foundation for the stories other
than the rehashing of some incidents that
have occurred in the last five years and
for which former matrons were dismissed
It was charged by Dunn that red pepper
was administered to the children as a
punishment. It was learned that this
possibly bad been done by a former
matron in cases that are difficult to de- #
scribe.
It appears that some of the children
come to the home in a state of unmention
-1 able depravity and the matrons have an
awful tune in endeavoring to control
these poor little wretches. In some cases
the effort has been made to cure them of
their inherited immorality by severe
measures, and the former matron, who
has long since left the asylum, it is
thought with some of tne worst cases did
use red pepper. The ladies of the direc
tory, however, exercise such a tireless
supervision over the control of the insti
tution that it is impossible for any abuse
to remain undetected.
JtUSH TO THE GOhD J-IELDS.
Hundreds of Miners Are Sailing Front
Port Toivnsend.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 5.â
The steamship Topeka sailed at noon to
day with the largest passenger list ever
carried north, made up of 300 miners
bound for the goldfieids o! the famed
Coofcs Inlet and Yukon country. Nearly
as many more have engaged passage for a
future trip. The steamship Al-Ki arrived
to-day, and already her entire accommo
dation has been spoken. The rush to the
north is unprecedented, and bespeaks un
told suffering, particularly as under a re
cent ruling of the Treasury Department
revenue cutters are positively prohibited
from carrying stranded miners south, as
has been the case in past years.
A PORTLAXJD LAWYER'S FLIGHT.
Indicted for Forgery, He Make* Hit
Escape to Chile.
PORTLAND, Ok., March 5.â A. F.
Groves, a lawyer practicing here for sev
eral years, is a fugitive from justice.
There is an indictment awaiting his return
charging him with the crime of forgery.
The indictment was returned against him
by the Grand Jury last Tuesday, but too
late to be of any avail in the effort at once
made to bring him to account for his
crimes. It was ascertained by the Deputy
Sheriff in whose hands the warrant of
arrest was placed that Groves, with his
family and what few personal effects he
possessed, had left for Chile, via San Fran
cisco, a week ago last Sunday.
The charge of forpery is based on fic
titious returns of summons in tne case of
Isaac Meyers vs. J. Smith et al. and the
fraudulent transfer of a number of pieces
of property in consequence of the decree
obtained through these false returns of
summons. The name of Sheriff Sears was
signed to returns that never reached his
hands and never passed through his office.
The sum involved in these forgeries ex
ceeds $30,000, but from which Groves
never profited a dollar, because of the
bungling manner in which the work was
done. This fraud came to light through
the attempt made to trade some of the
property obtained through this fraudulent
suit to Joseph Morris, a Washington-street
confectioner.

ing of the suit of Edward Andrew Barron,
the negro claimant to the Barron estate,
this morning Attorney Kerwin presented
affidavits showing that Attorney JVlontieth
was unable to appear on account of'illness
and asKed for a continuance. This was
objected to by Attorney Pillsbury.
Attorney Morehouse then filed the an
swer of George E. Barron to the suit of the
mulatto boy to establish heirship. The
answer denies tne claim of the negro and
asks that the case be abated until the trial
and determination of the suit of the de
fendant, George E. Barron. to have what
is purported to be the will of Edward Bar
ron set aside on the ground of undue in
fluence and mental unsoundness. It is
claimed that until the legality of the will
is settled a buu cannot be entertained to
establish heirship and for a distribution.
This altered things and Attorney Pills
bury, who has been vigorously objecting
to continuances, suggested that the case
might go over for a few days.
Judge Reynolds continued the case until
Monday, March 9.

NEWCASTLE, Cat... March s.â Rain be
gan failing this evening and has continued
throughout to-day. This will make the
air warmer, and consequently no more
frost is ftared. One of our prominent

grower, who at lirst stated that his crop
would not be injured, admitted last even
ing that he would have some loss, but
would not say how much it would be.
SET ERE FROST AT ST7ISUX.
But It Is Thought the Damage Will Be
Slight.
SUISUN, Cal., March s.â The snow and
rain of yesterday was followed last night
by a severe frost, which resulted in some
damage to fruit prospects, but from all re
ports received to-day and personal inter
views with many of the leading orchardists
of S lisun Valley it appears that the dam
age in that district thus far has been slight.
Ii nearly every orchard in the valley
fire were set at" 5 o'clock this morning
ano t he whole district was enveloped in a
cloud of smoke. It is generally thought
this obviated the greatest danger, but it
will take three or four days be f .it can
be definitely determined what ac ex
tent of the damage.
Almonds have been out of b â  i i from
ten to twenty days, but peaches &n i apri
cots are stili in bloom, rears ai prunes
have escaped entirely, and tin came is
thought of cherries. The apric- crop is
unusually large, and if half of it should be
destroyed there would be no material loss
to the growers, as at least that percentage
would have to be thinned.
Stork Dying in the iretyio Foothills.
FRESNO, Cal., March s.â The cold snap
of the past few days lias cono no appre
ciable damage to fruit trees in the vicinity
of Fre?no. Many orchardists in the rouuty
kept vigil last night with the view of light
ing fires in the orchards in case the frost
point was reached. Fortunately this was
unnecessary. To-night promises to be the
crucial test, however, since it is clear and
exceedingly chilly.
Almonds are in more danger than apri
cots. Thefoothilis on* both sides of the
valley are completely covered with snow
and the outlook is anything but cheerful.
Ltuck along the foothills, which have been
on short forage for some weeks, are said to
be dying as a result of hunger and cold.
The wind has ceased blowing and the
storm seems to be at an end.
f'aeaville's Bright Prospects.
VACAVILLE, Cal., March s.â The ex
citement of the past few days has been
somewhat quelled owing to ihe fact that
the warm rain which commenced yester
day afternoon continued throughout the
night, thus preventing the much-feared
freeze. Further investieation satisfies the
orchardists that the damage to their crops
is not nearly so great as was at first appre
hended. It is estimated the apricots were
damaged about one-half, the peaches very
slightly, other fruits none. The outlook at
present is better than former years. At
Winters the damage is slight and shippers
are making preparations to handie a
larger quantity of fruit than ever handled
there before.
Exaggerated Iteports J-'rom Sonoma.
S(Â»NOMA, Cal., March s.â The reports
of the damage caused by the slight fall of
snow in this valley on Monday, which ap
peared in some of the metropolitan jour
nals, were greatly exaggerated, and though
the earlier varieties of fruit which were in
blossom may have received slight damage
the benefit accruing to the grain-grower
and stockmen from the light covering of
snow that remained upon the ground for
several hours will more than counterbal
ance such small loss as may have been
sustained by the horticulturists. In the
extreme lower part of the valley the frosts
which followed the snowstorm are saia to
cave caused some damage.
Clear and Cold at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March s.â The
weather to-day was cold and clear without
an indication of rpin. Within two or three
hours previous to last midnight .37 of an
inch of rain fell, but within an hour after
midnight the moon and stars were shin
ing.
The rainfall for the present week aggre
gates 2:22 inches. Snow fell to the depth
of six inches on Ben Lomond Mountain
and eight inches at Felton. The fruit in
the high places only is damaged and
while exact results are not now obtainable
from the fact that the farmers are staying
closely at home it is evident the damage
will not be general or great.
Merced Is All Right.
MERCED, Cai,. March s.â While the
average temperature for the past four days
has been 39 degrees above zero the damage
to the fruit interests has been quite small.
The balmy weather in February brought
the buds forward very rapidly, especially in
the case of the apricot and peach, and they
appear to stand the cold wave all right so
far.
The fruit section on the Merced River
reports the same good fortune and claims
that frost will have to come good and
strong before that district is affected. Up
to the present our fruit has suffered no in
jury.
Cheerful Sexes Prom. Woodland.
WOODLAND, Cal., March 5.-Reports
received at Woodland to-day from the dif
ferent fruit sections throughout the coun
ty place the damage by the recent frosts
at a minimum. Winters is jubilant and
claims that the early fruit belt of Califor
nia never did present brighter prospects.
Orchardists throughout Capay Valley, as
well as other sections of the county, agree
that the damage reported after the first
frosts was greatly overestimated.
Oilrcy Cannot Estimate at Present.
GILROY, Cal., March s.â The full dam
age by the frosts to the fruii crop in this
vicinity cannot be estimated for a week.
Apricots and almonds are injured to some
extent. Prunes are late in budding, and
if any damage has been done it will in
crease the size of the fruit. The rainfall
for the storm amounts to 1.04 inches and
for the season 14.32 inches. Rain com
menced falling this evening, and the indi
cations are favorable for a steady down
pour.
Nearly Everything Gone at Chico.
CHICO, Cal., March s.âColonel Royce,
manager of the General Bidwell ranch,
ana B. F. Allen, the leadinc fruit-erowers
of Chico, make the following statement to
The Call correspondent of the condition
of the fruit crop:
The almond crop is gone, the apricot
crop is gone, the cherry crop is gone,
early apples are gone, pears are gone, and
on the Bidwell ranch the peaches are
all gone. There is a chance for the
prunes. The heavy frost last night
seemed to have killed everything in sight
in the way of fruit.
Difference of Opinion at Haywarda.
HAYWARDS, Cal., March s.â There
seems to be a marked difference of opinion
regarding the condition of the fruit crop.
Dr. KimDall, an owner of one of the largest
orchards in Haywards, believes that the
frosts of the past few days have entirely
ruined the apricots.
Cherries and late fruit will not suffer, as
the buds are not in full bloom. It is gen
erally conceded that apricots and almonds
are the only trees which will suffer.
Apricots Are Sadly Kipped.
AUBURN, Cal., March s.â The fruit
crop in this locality did not entirely escape
the recent cold snap. Saturday night's
frost did damage. As yet it is impossible
to ascertain the extent of the injury.
Apricots are injured quite badly, but
cherries are all right. Early peaches and
plums are hurt somewhat, but they gen
erally have to be thinned, anyway. There
was no injury whatever to orchards along
the American Rwer.
Apricot* Suffer at Hanford.
HAS FORD, Cal., March s.â Quite a se
vere frost occurred here Sunday night,
damaging the apricot crop probably 50
per cent. The damage is in streats, some
orchards not being hurt. The Royai vari
ety suffered most. The peach crop is little
hurt. No frost has occurred since, although
one is expected to-night. Many orchard
ists are prepared to smudge.
'lulare Sot Alarmed.
TULARE, Cal., March s.â The damage
to the fruit crop is greatly overestimated.
Pears and prunes are uninjured. Peaches
are damaged 25 per cent and will still re
quire thinning. Apricots and almonds,
our earliest fruits, are damaged 75 per
cent. The quantity of almonds and apri
cots raised tiere are insignificant. Citrus
fruits are uninjured.
Rain at San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March s.â The rain
fall to-day amounted to .25 of an inch,
matins a total of 9.81 inches for the sea
son. The rainfall to the same date last
season was 18.40 inches.
OROVILLE TRIAL ENDED.
W. G. Pearne, a Wealthy Wheat
Buyer, Is Convicted of
Manslaughter,
While Driving at an Unlawful Speed,
He Ran Over and Killed
an Aged Lady.
OROYILLE, Cal., March s.â The trial of
W. G. Pearne, one of the principal wheat
buyers of Butte county, for manslaughter,
for the killing of Mrs. Dogan, cf Biggs, by
running over her, commenced Tuesday
afternoon in the Superior Court of Butte
County.
County Clerk Harkness testified that
Ordinance 86 prohibited a team in un
incorporated towns of Butte county going
faster than six miles 'an hour.
County Surveyor McCoy produced a map
of Biggs, showing location of different
business places.
J. D. Adams testified that he accepted
an invitation to ride with Pearne from
Gridley to Biggs. Pearne was drunk and
whipped and ran the horses. When near
Biggs they came near running over Henry
Johnson, who jumped over a log to eet
out of dancer. They crossed the railroad
track to B street, Pearne using the whip
and driving with one hand. Pearne at the
same time leaned over the side of the
buugy to listen to some one who shouted
to him. Adams also looked back, and on
turning around again saw Mrs. Dogan just
ahead of the team. He tried to grab the
lines, .but was prevented by Pearne, and a
moment later they ran over the lady.
Henry Johnson testified as to getting
out of the way of the team, and that
Pearne appeared to have no control over
the horses.
Ed McCoy was sworn and said he saw
Pearne driving across the track, remark
ing, "Here comes Pearne and he is drunk."
Both horses were loping at about eight
miles an hour. As Pearne came up the
street the horses swerved to one side to a
hitching-post, but the driver pulled them
around and commenced using the whip.
The horses broke into a run and ran over
Mrs. Dogan, wno was crossing the street.
Several other witnesses were examined
without material change from the above
testimony, with the exception as to rate of
speed, some claiming that it was not over
six miles an hour.
To-day the jury returned a verdict of
manslaughter against Pearne. A light
sentence was recommend3d, which will be
passed Monday next.
SAS BERXARDINO SMASH-UP.
Evidence of Â« Deliberate Attempt to
Wreck a Train. '
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 5.â.
The Harlem motor was wrecked this morn
ing about 9 o'clock as it was leaving this
city for Highlands, but fortunately no one
was hurt, although several passengers
were on the train and a lively shaking up
was the result. Owing to the fact that the
train was just starting out it was running
quite slowly. The cause of the accident
was that a switch bolt had been drawn.
There is but little doubt that some mis
creant had laid plans to wreck the train as
it was passing through a rut near C and
.Second streets. Evidence 3hows that the
nut of the bolt was removed before the
late rain, as the threads were rnsty when
found. When the motor passed over this
point it took to the ties, dragging the cars
with it, and snapping the guard rails in
two. The motor was badly damaged.

PHCENIX, Ariz., March s.â Last night
while Lee Garrett, a contractor, was going
to his home near the suburbs of the city
h e was attacked by a man with a revolver
and ordered to throw up his hands.
Garrett did so, but broGght a re
volver from his hip pocket and fired
three times. The hold-up fled, leaving bis
cocked revolver in possession of Garrp tt,
who thinks one of the shots took effect
from the yells of pain emitted by the
feliow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
THE MINT STEAL
AT CARSON CITY
Progress of the Trial of
Melter and Refiner
Jones.
NOTEWARE'S TESTIMONY
Methods of Weighing Bullion in
Making the Annual Set
tlements.
THOSE TAGS STILL MISSING
The Books Show No Shortage, but
the Books and Bullion To
gether Do.
CARSON, Nev., March s.â ln the Jones
trial this morning the cross-examination
of Noteware by Woodburn was resumed.
Witness said that the same opportunity to
steal existed in the ingot melting-room as
in the refinery. If the spurious melt was
made in the night the watchman would
have known that operations were being
carried on. Harris had the same access 10
the vaults and books as Jones. The books
of 1895 show no Bhortage, and everything
was accepted by the superintendent as cor
rect up to that date.
Witness then gave the jury a detailed
account of the methods of weighing up
bullion in making annual settlements. lie
found no shortage in the books prior to
Melter and Refiner Harris coming into the
mint. It was Harris who discovered the
shortage in the metal soon after he went
into office, and it was Harris who reported
the shortage to the superintendent. The
defendant was his assistant at that time.
In the riscal year ending in 1893 there were
4702 ounces less came back from the re
finery than went up; in the year ending
in 1894, 3258 ounces less.
The internal record-book is in the hand
writing of Jones, Brown (the weight
cierk) and Charles Thompson, but most of
it was in the handwriting of Brown. The
weight clerk is supposed to keep the books.
The books are all balanced except for the
years 1893 and 1894. In previous years the
credits of the slum bullion make the
books balance.
He had no feeling but one of friendliness
for Jones. Their relations had always
been pleasant. Jone3 had received $5 58 a
day as weight clerk. As assistant melier
and refiner he received Â£2000 a year when
he first went in, but this had been reduced
to ?1500 since.
A small purse was then exhibited to the
jury and witness said that since the noon
recess he had put Bevera! small bars in the
purse worth $225. This evidence was to
show how the gold had been taken. The
abstraction of the leaves was from a place
in the accounts prior to any entries by
Mr. Harris. On December 17, 1894, there
was a deposit from the Savage mine only
three points difference in silver and the
same fineness in gold as the bogus melt.
Also on January 3, 1893, there was a de
posit of bullion by Charles Peters that
went 19J^ in gold.
Woortburn tried to show that the bullion
found in Pickler's yard was of the same
fineness as the spurious melt.
The court ruled it was not proper cross
examination, and Woodburn said he would
introduce the evidence later.
George Likens, employed in the refinery,
testified 10 the disappearance of the bul
lion tags. He said:
"The book and tags for the year
ending 1893 were taken away by some one,
but I don't know who. They were deliv
ered by Mr. Pierce to some one in the
melter and refiner's departmentâ l think
Mr. Jones, but am not positive, but that is
my impression."
Cross-examined by Woodburnâ l testi
fied twice in the Heney trial.
Witness was asked about the book, when
General Clarice stated that since the noon
recess the book had been found.
Witnessâ l don't know what became of
the tags in 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1893, but I
think they were all taken away at the
same time. Can't positively say who
asked for the tags, but it was some one
from the refinery. Think it was in June,
1893. Never searched for the tags until
quite recently. Other people have searched,
but they are still missing. Jones some
times accounted for the receipts to the
superintendent and sometimes to Za
briski. Jones was assistant melter and re
finer when Heney was there and also as
sistant melter and refiner up to his sus
pension. The operations practically ceased
at that time. The books show no shortage,
but the books and bullion together show a
shortage. It was necessary to assay the
bullion to discover the shortage.
GOVERNOR AT HIGHLANDS
Expresses Great Satisfaction at
the Management of the
Institution.
He Found the Patients in Good Condi
tion and Everything in Apple
Pie Order.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 5.-
The Governor and party to-day paid an
official visit to the asylum at Highlands to
investigate the running affairs of that in
stitution. Governor Budd was accom
panied by Senator White's brother, a tius
tee of the Agnews Asylum, and Mr.
Stephens, president of the Sacramento
Board of Trade and Secretary of the State
Board.
The party did not stop at San Bernar
dino, but went immediately to the asylum,
where they arrived about the time for feed
ing the patients. While the meals were
being prepared for the party Governor
Budd thought he would occupy the time
by seeinc how the patients were served,
and he immediately set out on a tour of
inspection. Every department in this line
was visited and the greatest satisfaction
wan Bhown by the Governor. The Gov
ernor is a great advocate of rice for the use
of patients, and conveyedh is ideas to Dr.
Campbell after a general |tour of inspec
tion throughout the building
The books of the institution were turned
to and a careful examination of them
made.
Here the Governor met with an agree
able surprise, and one which lie made no
efforts to conceal. He expected to find a
most extravagant account of expenditures,
but, to the contrary, he found that, as a
whole, it was the cheapest-run institution
of the kind in tne State, many of the
salaries being lower by several dollars. It
was found that the patients were treated
as wel' as could be" expected, they receiv
ing every care and attention.
The local trustees are jubilant over the
Governor's visit and its result, as they say
that all misrepresentations made to the
executive have been found without founda
tion. It was also found that there is still
much room for many more patients with
out overcrowding the departments in any
manner whatever.
XORTHESX PACIFIC AFFAIRS.
Hondholdera May Find Themaelvea in a
Pitiable Plight.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 5.â A promi
nent New York lawyer of counsel in the
Northern Pacific receivership fight said
yesterday in this city that if the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company had really issued
mortgage bonds without the consent of
Congress holders thereof would find
themselves in a pitiable plight, as they
could not under any circumstances be
construed as preferred claims, but must
necessarily hi considered along with the
lump indebtedness of the railroad, which
was, as everybody knew, so great that its
common creditors could never be made
anything like whole. Fuch a claim was
made recently in the Milwaukee Federal
court by filing pleas of the Wisconsin
Central Company and the Wisconsin Cen
tral Railroad Company to tne original
amended and supplemental bilis of the
Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, as al
leged, having been prohibited by Congress
from executing mortgages on its proper
ties save upon the express consent of Con
gress. This, it is charged, the company
failed to secure and mortgage bonds
to the amount of $50,000,000 are in conse
quence null and void.
EUREKANS ARE REJOICING
Damages for Families of Sea
men Drowned Through
Negligence.
Happy Outcome of a Case That Has
Been Before the Courts for
Years.
EUREKA, Cal., March 5.â A case in
which the people of this county were
greatly interested was decided in the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals a
few days ago, much to the satisfaction of
people hereabouts.
On November 15, 1889, the schooner
Fidelity, while being towed from the
Pacific Ocean into Plurnboldt Bay by the
steam tug Printer, was capsized on Ham
boldt bar. The captain and all hands
were drowned and the vessel was a total
loss. Suits were started in the Superior
Court by the widows of the captain and
cook of the Fidelity, charging negligence
on the part of the captain of the tug.
These suits were removed by the de
fendants to the United States District
Court. On February 21, 1894, Judge Mor
row of the District Court rendered a de
cision in favor of the widows, allowing
the captain's widow $7000 and the cook's
widow $5000.
An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court
of Appeals, and after having been sub
mitted for over one year and a half the
opinion of Judge Morrow was sustained.
The dec Uion meets with great public ap
probation here, where it is known that the
disaster was caused by gross negligence
and where great sympathy is felt for the
families of the drowned "men. The long
and unexplained delay in deciding the case
had caused much uneasiness among the
claimants, and during the interval the
captain's widow, Mrs. Christopherson, had
been foreclosed out of her home; but the
affirmance of the decision came when hope
was almost gone, and reassured the people
hereabouts that the poor are equally re
spected with the rich m the United States
courts.
Much credit is given the attorneys,
Messrs. J. F. Connant and James M. Gil
lett, for their perseverance and ability dis
played.
NOTES FROM PALO ALTO
Rain Prevented the Practice
Baseball Game of Stanford
at Santa Clara.
Preparations Are Being Made for Sev
eral Musical and Athletic
Events.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY.CaI., March
5. â The baseball grounds were too wet at
Santa Clara for a game to-day, so the Stan
ford nine, which had made preparations
to go down there for an afternoon's prac
tice, remained on the campus.
It has been definitely decided that next
Saturday the team will contest with an ag
erepation of ex-Stanford players on the
home diamond. As most of the ex-play
ers are first-class men it will be surprising
if the Varsity succeeds in saving itself
from a severe drubbing.
The elee and mandolin clubs are de
sirous of making a trip south during the
short spring vacation which hegins on
March 20. The proposed tour would take
the clubs throughout Southern California
and would necessitate a considerable fund
for expenses. The student body decided to
allow such trips upon condition that
enough money be put up by club mem
bers to guarantee the treasury against loss
on the venture. In order to raise suffi
cient money a concert toon place this
evening which was well attended and af
forded the first opportunity the students
have had to judge of the merits of Stan
ford's musical talent.
The student committee which has charge
of the arrangements for Stanford day at
the San Jose Rose Carnival are preparing
an elaborate programme. Already a spe
cial train has been arranged for and the
participants in the trade events and on
the stageâ numbering seventy-five or more
individualsâ will have a special car.
It is proposed to have an athletic track
exhibition during the day. There will be
fourteen events, and three prizes will be
given for the best men in each.
In the evening a grand concert and spe
cialty performance" will be given at the
theater. The glee, mandolin and banjo
clubs will all take part also the ladies'
mandolin club. After the theatrical per
formance a ball will take place. Alto
gether the affair promises to be highly
successful.

RAISIN INDUSTRY.
The Future of the Valley
Is Bright With
Promise.
PACKER MEETS GROWER.
Former Dissensions to Make
Way for One Harmonious
Union.
MIDDLEMEN TO BE CHECKED.
Plans Contemplated by the Combine,
Which Has a Capital of
$1,000,000.
FRESNO, Cal., March s.â From present
appearances the future of the raisin indus
try of the San Joaquin Valley is bright
with promise. Various packing and grow
ing factions, heretofore thought to be irre
concilable, are about to be brought into
one harmonious union, having for its ob
ject the good of all concerned. The dis
cussion of these matters by many leading
packers and growers before the Hundred
Thousand Club up to a late hour last even
ing has resulted in infusing new life and
hope into the subject.
Tne importance of this movement may
be realized when it is known that such an
organization can absolutely control the
raisin market of the United States, and
that many millions of dollars are repre
sented by the interests concerned. The
great difference between the price which
consumers pay for raisins in every part of
the country and that realized by the pro
ducers make the fact very apparent that
"the middlemen" have not only manipu
lated the market to suit themselves, but
have made all the money from the indus
try. This has not only caused business to
lag. but if continned will, as all concede,
ultimately destroy it.
At a meeting again this afternoon of the
packers the ground was gone over, and in
view of the fact that the co-operative
packers have about agreed to the plans so
far formulated, the way seems open to a
perfect organization that will insure im
mediate and permanent relief to this
greatest of California products.
Those attending the meeting last night
and again this afternoon were: Dr.
Washer, W. F. Forsey, E. G. Chaddock,
A. Albrecht of Fowler, G. B. Noble, Wil-
Jiam Noble, J. H. Kelly. Fred Nelson of
Fowler. John D. Gray, Lee L. Gray, A.
Gartenlaub, Thomas H. Lynch, W. M.
Griffin of San Francisco, W. F. Rowell of
Easton and J. W. Alexander. The organ
ization will be capitalized at $1,000, C00.
The plan contemplates holding raisins
for f. o. b. prices, entirely eliminating all
consignments. It also contemplates sell
ing through one central head controlled
by the corporation. The prices are to be
made subject to the approval of a commit
tee of three representing the growers' in
terests, to be appointed by and from the
managers or presidents of the several
banks in the raisin district.
It also contemplates a pooling of all the
raisins, based upon the grading from the
stemmers, which grading shall be under
the supervision of the corporation.
It contemplates further the pooling of
the money which the raisins brine, each
grower to have his proportionate share of
all sales, based upon his grade, quality and
the amount of raisins delivered, without
reference to whether they are first or last
sold, and the proportionate sharing of any
loss that might be sustained by the
failure to market any portion of the
raisins.
It contemplates reasonable advances to
the growers for picking purposes, either
on the delivery of the raisins or in cases of
special need, to be given in loans on proper
security before delivery of raisins, and
that at least 75 per cent of the output of
raisins (shall be in the pool.

The Wife of a Wealthy Brewer Finds
Her Sisler Conducting a Little
Restaurant.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 5.â
Two days ago the wealthy proprietor of
the Schlitz Brewery of Milwaukee arrived
in Santa Barbara with his wife, taking
quarters at the Arlington. The lady im
mediately began to make inquiries for a
sister whom she had not seen for twenty
years, and who was living, as she sup
posed, in one of Santa Barbara's many
beautiful houses. Failing to lind any
trace of the lady in the upper part of town,
she prosecuted her inquiries in the busi
ness portion, and to her surprise finally
found her with her hard-working husband
conducting a little restaurant on a side
street near State street. The visitors, who
are childless, had brought rich gifts for
their young nephews and nieces, and it is
probable that this meeting will prove for
tunate in more ways than one for the
relatives whom adversity had overtaken in
their years of separation.

that by the end of the week she will be in
readiness for steamine down the bay.
She is fully equipped for active service,
and is now alongside the wharf having
stores placed on board.

They Refuse Two Austrian Fishermen
Shelter From a Furious Storm.
VICTORIA, B. C, Marc 5. -Two Aus
trian fishermen named F. Melroso and
Frank Paveh, who left here on one of their
ordinary cruises on Sunday last, nad a
test of English hospitality under peculiar
circumstances.
After leaving the harbor the fishermen
found the sea too rough to proceed, and
when off Macaulay Point they endeavored
to run into Esqinmalt, but failing ran into
a little cove under the fortification works.
Here they disembarked and built a small
fire on the beach to warm themselves, but
according to their story they did not stay
long.
They were hurried away by the fortifica
tion sentinel. The men, cold and be
numbed, asked to remain until the sea
smoothed down a little, and to this appeal
the sentinel referred the matter to his
superiors. The latter, however, would
not allow the foreigners to stay. On re
ceiving orders, and taking their lives in
their hands, the fishermen embarked in
their frail little craft again and made off
for EsQuimalt Harbor.
They did not proceed far, however, until
they were capsized in the heavy sea run
ning. Melrose, being a good swimmer,
assisted Paveh, who was not, and tne two
were in the water nearly one hour before
rescued by the liehthouse-keeper.
FIRST EMERGENCY CALL
An Interesting Experiment That
Produced Satisfactory
Results.
State Troops Muster at Their Re
spective Armories in Quick
Time.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March s.â Some
weeks ago Brigadier-General M. W. Hol
ler, commanding the Third Brigade, Na
tional Guard of California, issued an order
notifying the troops in the brigade to liold
themselves in readiness at all times to re
ceive an "emergency call," and to re
spond to it promptly, in order that an idea
might be gained as to what dependence
could be placed on their rallying at short
notice in case of actual emergency. Since
that time the troops, realizing that the
call might come any day, have held them
selves in readiness to respond to it
promptly.
Colonel J. W. Guthrie, commanding the
Second Infantry, received a telegram at 2
p. M. to-day ordering him to issue the call.
The order was immediately transmitted
to the officers of companies in the city,
also to the companies at Chico, Colusa,
Nevada City, Marysville, Woodland and
Redding. They were also sent to the
Third Brigade Signal Corps and Trcop B,
cavalry.
At "o'clock more than tifty of the mem
bers of Troop B were in their quarters,
most of them being in uniform. Before
7:30 all the members of too Signal Corps
except three, who were not in the city,
were in uniform and ready for inspection.
Promptly at 8 o'clock Troop B filed into
the drillroom and two minutes later the
Signal Corps marched to their station,
both having been excused by the order
from appearing mounted. Company G
followed a minute later and took their
place in line, but it was twenty minutes

MR. JAMES L. BANKS.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal.
I just reached Santa Barbara, and 1 am glad of it, for really it is one of the best
little towns in California, and the people are ail praising Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla,
so that puts me in good humor. The gentleman whose portrait I send you is of a
retiring disposition and seldom allows newspaper men to interview him. It was my
great good fortune to speak to Mr. Banks when he was telling a friend how much eood
the native sarsaparilla had done him.
He told me that for several months past he had suffered from boils and anl im-
poverished condition of the blood. Did not understand why this should be. as he
takes much care of his health and is regular arid methodical: "However." said he,
"I have used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and I believe it is the best sarsaparilla that
I have ever used. I have used several other sarsararillas at various times, and I will
not say that they are no pood, but 1 will say that none of these sarsaparillas compare
with Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Yes, it is true, that the new idea of manufacturing
sarsaparilla is the "better idea. It used to be the proper thing to emulsify iodide of
potassium with sarsaparilla. Of course, iodide of potassium is a mineral drug that
irritates the stomach and 1 know it. I know it from experience. I know that using
the sarsaparilla with iodide of potassium brings out pimples and boils upon the face. I
know that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla contains no iodide of potassium, contains no
mineral drugs, because I used it. It did not irritate my stomach, it brought no pim-
ples on my face, it purified the blood and instantly dried up the jerupiions that were
on my body.
"I do not usually speak for publication, but any man would do as I am doing
nowâ recommend that which he knows to be good. I don't think that Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla would mend a broken leg, or grow hair on a man's head, but verily I do
believe that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla will put the stomach and Dowels in such good
order and the hlood in so pure a condition that the man of ordinary constitution will
certainly feel health and life in every nerve and fiber of the body."
I spoke to all the druggists in Santa Barbara md they reported wonderful sales for
Joy's Sarsaparilla. None of the druggists are substituting "something just as good"
for Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Santa Barbara is a small place compared to San
Francisco, and if the druggists resorted to cheap methods every one in Santa Barbara
would know it, and they would keep away from the substitutor. 1 am told that the
substituting druggists in San Francisco are having a pretty hard time of it. People go
into a drugstore now and ask for Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla and say that they want
it for some one else, so that now there is no more talk about "something just as good."

Mayor Sutro Asks the Property.
Owners If the Little Bill
Is 0. K.
The following, which speaks plainly for
itself, was received by President Hubbs of
the Richmond Property-owners' Protec
tive Association from the Mayor:
Mayor's Office, )
Pan Francisco, March 4, 1895.1
Charles H. Ilnbbs, SSO Vine street, Cityâ MY
Dear Sir: On February 24, 1896, there was
filed an a.Â«sessmeut in this office for $21,797 35
for building sewers, etc., from Fourteenth
to Twentieth avenue along Lake street by Wil
liams & Belser, contractors.
No objection has been raised to such assess
ment.
As the sum is a large one and embraces a dis
trict covering the territory in your club, the
Mayor. Hon. Adolph Sutro, has directed me to
no'ify your organization of the same, with the
request that if there be any valid objections to
the countersigning |of the assessment, at
the earliest practicable moment the same shall
be communicated to him, so he may determine
what to do therein. Very respectfully yours,
Taylor Rogers. Mayor's Clerk.
"The blocKs referred to," said Mr. Hubbs
yesterday, "are six in number, and arÂ«
each 240 feet long. This makes a total of
1440 feet sewered, and the $21,797 35 makes
the rtite $15 13 per front foot.
"How is that for sewer work? The
usual price for pipe work is ?1 40, and for
a brick sewer $3 per foot is considered a
big charge. Is it any wonder that
property-owners complain and kick at
street improvements? Take a poor man
out in Richmond district paying $800 for
his little twenty-five-front foot home.
Along comes a $15 front foot |assessmt-nt
for a sewer, and fifteen times twenty-five
make $37f>, almost half of the price he paid
lor the lot.
"You may be sure, the people on those
six blocks "along Lake street will kick
against any such a steal as that. It wag
considerate and honorable in Mayor Sutro
to call our attention to this imposition.
Is this not a street contractor ridden
town?"

FRESNO, Cal., March s.â This imperial
county, wnich lies at the geographical
center of the State, was, in'lÃs6, formed
from portions of the vast domain com
prised in the counties of Tulare, Merced
and Mariposa.
It is the central county of the great San
Joaquin group and contains 5606 square
miles â an area almost as great as that of
the States of Connecticut ana Rhode Island
combined.
The early gpographers designated the
San Joaquin Valley as the "Great Califor
nia Desert,"' and General John C. Fre
mont, who visited this region in 1844, and
â¢who gave the first reliable account of it,
quite agreed with these "men of science"
on this point. He designated it as a "bar-
en waste," wholly unfit for any other oc
cupancy than that which it then pos
sessed, namely, numerous herds of wild
horses, elk and antelope, which browsed
and fattened on the juicy grasses which
bordered its perennial streams and dotted
with bunches of green its vast slopes and
foothill ranges.
The possibilities of this immense terri
tory were not understood for nearly twenty
years after General Fremont had pub
lished his account of it. It has been within
three decades that this "desert" of former
years has been made to "blossom as the
rose." The days of the wild horse, fur

trappers and Indians in this valley are
easily within the memory of men then
grown to manhood's estate.
The stages of the transformation from
those primitive days to the present are
coni prised in three distinct eras, viz.: the
mining era, the cattle-raising era and the
present era of agriculture and horticulture
by means of irrigation.
The late A. Y. Kasterby was the modern
Aladdin who first made use of the means
in the territory now comprised within the
limits of Fresno County by which the pres
tnt day's macic work began. This magi
cian's lamp was that of experience only.
He had witnessed the wonderfully beneti
cent effects of irrigation in India and
Egypt He applied his experience and
observation to this great valley; that was
all. He diverted the waters from the
great streams which traverse this valley
at remarkably equidistant intervals, and
spread tnem out upon the broau. level
plains.
The surface of the land is composed of a
rich alluvial deposit, which, under Easter
by's system of moisture, yields to the hus
bandman most remarkable returns.
The colony system of irrigation, by
which the land has been divided up into
ten and twenty acre tracts, is probably
without a parallel in any other part of the
world in its extent ami the success which
characterized its adoption in this valley.
A few figures on this point will be
i highly instructive. It has been ascer-
THE COURTHOUSE AT FRESNO.
| tamed that there are 35,000 acres of rnisin
' grapevines in bearing in this county. This
! vast area is comprised in innumerable
I small tracts. Careful computations show
that there are 14,% orchards and vineyards
of from rive to forty acres each and about
300 ranging from forty to 100 acres in each.
Then there are nearly 1000 stock and grain
ranches in the county ranging from 1000
I acres down.
The grain sown last year was as follows:
I One hundred and fifty-six thousand acres
!to wheat and â¢_'!â¢, 000 acres to barley. Be
| sides these there were thousands of acres
j sown to alfalfa, which yielded the most
I gratifying results.
J Important as these productions are,

they sink into comparative insignificance
when classed with the culture of raisin
grapes.
The reputation of Fresno County raisins
is world wide. Nowhere else, perhaps, can
raisins be produced under so favorable con
ditions as in Fresno County. This is due
party to the geognostic character of the
soil and also to the hot, dry temperature
of the summer and early autumn months.
The almost total absence of rainfall
from the middle of April to the
middle of November of each year con
stitutes a condition whicii guarantees the
highest perfoction in the production and
curing of raisins. While this is true, the
almost unparalleled system of irrigation
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
assures all the water necessary to a perfect
and healthy growth of the vines.
Thus far as to ;the valley productions,
which, rare and Immensely valuable as
tney are, by no means exhaust the physi
cal resources of this great county. If we
look a little lurther we shall see that much
of great importance remains to be told.
For, it should be borne in mind that this
county, which, it has been shown, com
prises a greater extent of territory than
some of the States of the Union, is 128
miles in extent from east to west, while its
width varies from 35 to 70 miles. In the
eastern part of this vast domain the snow
crowned Sierra Nevada Mountains rear
their peaks to the hight of 14,000 feet above
the sea level. From these dizzy heights,
where the ice king holds perpetual sway,
the county stretches across to the west
until it reaches the Mount Diablo range.
The recent find of free gold in a ledge of
decomposed quartz near the base of
Quartz Mountain seems to emphasize the
importance of what was formerly almost
the sole occupation of the county s inhab
itantsâviz.: mining.
In the early days the pioneers worked
only the gravel deposits of this county
with great success, securing large quanti
ties of gold. These gravel beds were not
extensive, however, ana a few years suf
ficeil to exhaust the most promising, after
which placer mining became almost obso
lete.
During the past few years quartz
mining has supplanted the old method and
witli most gratifying results. Shafts and
tunnels have penetrated far into the sides
of mountains. These have opened up
many new ledges which show gold in pay
ing quantities. So much for gold mining.
Prospectors have reported from time to
time enormous deposits of high-grade iron
(ire crowning the Minarets. It is said to
be a great mass of almost pure iron. Its
location is far back into the mountains,
however, and therefore no attempt has
been made in the direction of mining it.
Among the foothills and mountains near
the western border of the county are to be
found many valuable deposits of coal, gyp
sum and asphaltuni.
FBEBNO CITY.
The year 1806 is destined unquestionably
to mark an important era in the history of
Fresno Cityâ an era characterized by great
and unprecedented activity and progress.
This year will witness the completion of
the San Francisco and San Joaquin Val
ley Railroad into Fresno; also that scarcely
less important enterprise, the plant of the
San Joaquin Electric Light and Power
Company.
The former guarantees a rate of trans
portation for the products of this valley,
which, it is confidently asserted, will in
sure a fair, not to say a generous profit, ou
every variety of soil production of which it
is capable.
The policy of the Southern Pacific Rail
road's management of "all the traffic will
bear" has retained in a kind of bondage
what otherwise would have been the most
prosperous and contented people on earth.
The completion of the last named under
taking insures motive power for manufac
turing 7>ur]>oses at a rate far below the
cost of steam. In view of this fact several
factory enterprises, of which this City
greatly stands in need, will undoubtedly
spring up; and not only this, but the ma
chinery and mills, already here, will be
furnished power far below the rate now
being paid, thus increasing the profits of
the operators and at thÂ« same time lower
ing the price to local consumers.
The material growth of Fresno has been
phenomenal. From the organization of
the county until after the completion of
the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1872 Mil
lerton, a small village about thirty miles
east of Fresno, was the county seat. In
that year the new county seat was decided
upon. The transformation which has
taiieii place from the time the town was
staked out to the present is best exempli
fied by means of the illustrations which
are printed in connection herewith.
Fresno's business blocks would be credit
able to a city many times its size. Many of
them are solid brick structures two and
three stories high. A splendid high-school
building of brick will soon be completed,
'I he city contains several very elegant
church buildings and others are soon to be
erected. It has a free public library, town
hall, a very substantial opera-house and
scores of . handsome dwelling-houses.
Many of its main streets are paved and it
has a complete sewer system.
The Republican of this city, in its splendid
New Year's edition for 1896, referring to
the growth of population and other
kindred subjects, said:
"When the era of irrigation began the
population consisted of the miners in the
foothills aud the cattle men, hugging the
borders of the rivers. In 1873, a year after
the county seat was removed from Miller
ton to Fresno, the vote cast at the general
election was, including the present county
of Madera, 762, which would indicate a
population of about 4000. At the present
time the city of Fresno and its additions
contain nearly three times that number,
while the last estimate shows the popula
tion of 34,860, located chiefly in a territory
now under irrigation, with a natural ca
pacity to furnish employment, subsistence
and competency for ten times that
population, uncTer conditions the most
comfortable, with a climate the most
genial that could he desired. The fertile
soil of the plains which constitute
nearly one-third of the county, its
wonderful richness and productiveness
enabling, under irrigation, the raising of
successive crops the same season, the
wealth of minerals in the mountains, the
abundance of water for irrigation, the hot,
dry but inoppressive atmosphere, giving
size, richness and sweetness to its fruits,
and above all its magnificent water power
now being harnessed to electricity to fur
nish light, heat and motive power to the
city and "the various mills, all indicate
that Fresno is yet in swaddling clothes as
compared with its possibilities of future
greatness.
"Besides all these are the coal, petro
leum, gypsum and sulphur deposits on
the west side, and the inexhaustible iron
mines and forests of the Sierras to meet
the demands of the thousands who may
populate the plain. Already two large
flumes, of sixty miles each in length,
bring lumber down from the mountains
one from the greatest grove of sequoias or
'big trees' on the continent, the other
from the forests of mammoth pines."

Trouble Arising From a Recent
Corporation Elec
tion.
Sidney V. Smith Wants to Get Into
the Board of the Donahue
Road.
There is trouble over the election of di
rectors of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad, held on January 20
last. At that election Antoine Borel, A.
W. Foster. A. Markham, J. B. Stetson,
George A. Newhall, P. N. Lilienthal and
John L. Howard were declared elected,
and now Kidney v". Smith,, Antoine Borel,
J. B. Stetson and John L. Howard are
asking that the election be set aside to the
extent of declaring Smith elected and P.
N. Lilienthal defeated.
There are 60,000 shares of stock in the
company, and there were represented in
the meeting 54,860 shares. When the vote
had been taken the plaintiffs allege that
the following was the result: Antoine
Borel, 52,844; J. B. Stetson, 52,845; John
L. Howard, 52,843; Sidney V. Smith,
52,843; A. W. Foster, 43,162; Andrew
Markham, 43.162; George A- Newhali,
43,162. and P. N. Lilienthal, 43,159.
Borel voted his own stock and also over
8000 shares belonging to Peter Gundecher
and G. E. Wagner. When these were
about to be counted Jesse W. Lilienthal,
who held one share, protested against
them on the ground that neither Gun
decker nor Wagner were bona-hde stock
holders and that they could not, therefore,
assign their proxy to any one. Besides, he
said, the proxies held by Borel had been
revoked by the death of Laden burg of the
firm of Ladenburg, Thallman & Co., the
real owners of the stock objected to. A.
W. Foster.who presided, heard tiie protest,
ruled it well taken, and threw out all the
votes cast by Borel as proxy.
It is further alleged that Jesse W.
Lilienthal and Andrew Markham, against
the protest of Smith, forged a ballot with
all Smith's stock distributed for him, and
cast the same. Tne ballot, the complaint
states, was as follows: For Arthur W.
Foster. 21,555; for Andrew Mark ham, 21,
--555; for George A. Newhali, 21,553; for P.
"N. Lilienthal, 21,553.
This ballot was counted, and Smith
claims his own ballot was thrown out and
this forged ballot counted. This caused a
change in the result as follows: J. P. Stet
son 11,417, John L. Howard 105, A. W.
Foster 64,715, A. Markhara 64,715, George
A. Newhali 64,715, P. N. Lilienthal 64,712,
Antoine Borel 54,844.
These directors were declared elected.
Tne whole matter was a conspiracy, the
complaint states, to secure for Foster the
uresidency of the board, the Anglo-Cali
fornia Bank as treasurer and Jesse W.
Lilienthal as counsel.
At the meeting it is charged that Jesse
W. Lilienthal acted as counsel for Foster,
and advised him to rule as he did.
MONEY FOR A SCHOOL.
Henry Cartner's Donation to Ten
Christian Ladies.
Ten philanthropic ladies of California
have received a handsome conditional
gift from Henry Curtner of Warm Springs.
Mr. Curtner owns some school property,
consisting of thirteen acres of land and
school and dormitory buildings at Irving
ton. The property has been utilized by
various religious denominations for edu
cational purposes, but without conspicu
ous success.
Hitherto Mr. Curtner donated the use of
the property, but now he proposes to make
a gift of it to the ladies of the Christian
church in the State.
The gift is conditional, however, upon
the recipients securing an endowment of
$2500. They have set to work to raise the
amount, are sending out circulars appeal
ing to the benevolence of tbe public and
have put a solicitor in the field.
Articles of incorporation have been filed,
wherein Mr. Curtner pledges a bond of
deed conditional upon the endowment.
The property cost the donor $50,000.
The officers are: Mrs. H. 11. Luse, pres
ident; Mrs. Ella i"\ Maguire of Saratoga,
vice-president; Mrs. Vera W. Durham of
Irvington, recording secretary; Mrs. Har
riet S. Kennedy, corresponoing secretary;

The school is to be known as the Henry
Curtner Seminary. Young women and
girls are eligible to entrance, and the en
dowment is to be for scholarships for
orphans. The institution is to be noa

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Pacific Mail Company's Expen
sive Manner of Docking
the China.
VAGARIES OF A REVENUE BOAT
Healy, Tibbitts & Co. Secured the
Contract for the New Pacific-
Street Shed.
The steamer China got in from Hong
kong via Yokohama and Honolulu yester
day a day ahead of time. She was up to
her dock before noon, but as the Doric and
Colon occupied one side of the wharf and
the Belgic and a sailing ship the other,
Captain Seabury had to stand on and off
until things were made ready for him. The
Doric was to sail for the Orient at 3 p. m.,
and instead of letting the China come to
an anchor and await her departure Agent
Center determined to work out a scheme
of hia own. He called in the aid of the
tugs Fearless and Active, and, after con
siderable delay, moved the Belgic out into
the stream and anchored her. Then he
moved the Doric from the east to the west
side of the wharf and then the wharc was
clear for the Cnina.
By this time it was after 2 p. m., how
ever, and by the time the China was se
curely in her berth the Doric was getting
ready to sail. There was not thirty min
utes of time saved and Uncle Collis is out
$300 for the hire of the tugs. From a finan
cial standpoint the scheme was a success â
for the tugs.
The China brought thirty-three cabin
and four European and thirty-eight Chi
nese steerage passengers. Of the Chinese
only eleven are for San Francisco, the
others being in transit for Havana. The
cabin passengers were: Dr. and Mrs.
Cantlie, child and maid, N. T. Cholmeley,
Charles Dunne, Rev. and Mrs. C. G. Gard
ner and child, Mrs. M. Ginsburg, Mr. ai.d
Mrs. Otto Heydenfeldt, H. R. Jofferds. A.

During the run from Honolulu First As
sistant Engineer H. H. Cooper went sud
denly out of his mind, and had to be con
fined in a straitjacket. He was appar
ently rational when the vessel docked, but
the chances are that it will be some time
before he fully recovers.
The captain of the revenue cutter Rash
had a great picnic docking his vessel yes
terday. From the time he arrived off
Main-street wharf it just took him three
hours to get the cutter alongside. Wmle
he was maneuverine the British ship
Monkbarns was moved from Beale street
and placed in the Merchant*' drydocfc.
The vessel was shored up and the dock
pumped dry before the first line was
thrown from the Rush. In order to give
the revenue boat plenty of room the steam
schooner Westport moved out, and after
the trouble was all over docked again in
ten minutes. Uncle Sam's revenue marine
may be good sailors, but they don't know
much about docking a ship.
Captain Dettmars made a very smart
run from Cleone in the steam schooner
Alcazar this last trip. His vessel looked
more like a raft than any tiling else as she
came up the bay. There was on board
5000 railroad ties and 230 piles measuring
from 50 to 75 feet for the Valley road.

The steamer Willamette Valley, which
broke her crank pin and hnd to put into
Ensenada in distress, arrived in tow of the
Bonita yesterday. She went dkect to the
Union Iron Works, where she will be re
paired and sail again in about a week.
The coast defense steamer Monterey ar
rived from Santa Barbara yesterday. A
few hours out from San Diego she was i
caught in a southeaster and lost some of ;
herboats. She will repair damages here
and will then proceed to Puget Sound.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
steamer Doric sailed for the Orient yester
day with twenty cabin and eu. ty Chinese
steerage passengers. Dr. Chapman, lare of
the Belgic, went out as sur. eon of the ship.
SUTRO AND THE MAILS.
The Mayor Could Be Indicted by the
United States Grand
Jury.
Replying to the question vhether steps
would be taken to punish Mayor Sutro
for violating the law against depositing
scurrilous matter for delivery through the
marils, Postmaster Frank MoCoppin yes
terday said :
"The subject has passed beyond my
hands. It has been referred to the In
Bpectors by the Postoftice Department, and
if they consider that the statute lias been
violated by Mayor Sutro they can present
the question to the United States District
Attorney, who may place the mutter be
fore the United States Grand Jury now in
session.''
The Postmaster was asked if be consid
ered the matter forwarded by Mr. Sutro as
scurrilous within the meaning of the law.
and he replied :
'â¢That is a question for the inspectors,
the District Attorney and Grand Jury to
determine. I regarded the matter as un
mailabie under the law and detained some
800 or 1000 envelopes. Some, however,
went through. The course pursued by
him might do for Barbary Coast corre
spondence, but the idea or sending sue li
comment as the envelopes contained to
the capital of the Nation and to represen
tatives of tho people i:i Congress was in
decent and absurd to say tto* least.
"It is not fair to censuie Mr. Cuandler,"
continued the Postmaster. 'He did writ.
at the bottom of one of the printed circu
lars that he was willing to receive a respect
ful communication from any citizen of
California, but he did object to receiving
scurrilous communications such as huu
beed incldfed and mailed to him."
The penalty under the statute for send
ing scurrilous or defamatory communica
tions through the mails is, upon convic
tion, a tine of not more $5000, or imprison
ment at bard labor not more than live
years, or both, at the discretion of the
court.
Half-Interest Swindle.
Eugene Aitken, a half-interest man, wns ar
rested yesterday on a warrant charging him
withobtalningraoney by faise pretep-e*. The
complaining witness is l'nilip A. Potter, a ro
ceut arrival from Providence, K. I.', living at
23 Kearny street, who alleges that he pur
chased for $75 from Aitken a half interest in a
coffee, tea and wine route and found there
was no such route.

FRIDAY MARCH 6. 3896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Clean politics wins.
Honest men to the front.
The railrogues are at it again.
In a straight fight straight men will win.
Now is the time for all loyal Republicans
to rail}-.
Republicanism is alert and trickery dis
comfited.
To uncovered rascality it is a mighty
cold snap.
Through open primaries is the way to
Republican victories.
Home rule is good rule for parties as
well as for communities.
The law cannot punish the forging of
proxies, but the people can.
Beneath the tent of the Kellv-Mahoney
sideshow there is only a "what-is-it"?
Be not deceivedâ Huntington is not
doing all of his fighting at Washington.
As a mass the railroad gang looks black
all over, but the individuals ore spotted.
Any rascal who puts his hand on the
Republican machine this year will get it
mashed.
The hand of the Kentucky company is
not always visible, but its work can be told
by the tools it employ?.
The Southern Pacific of Kentucky will
find that the Republican party is some
thing of a buzÃsaw itself.
Turn the cathode ray upon any kind of
political rascality and you will see in it the
bony hand of the railroad.
Congressional committees can best act
for the people by giving the people a
chance to act for them<Â«elves.
Any threat of a contest in the Fourth
Congressional District will turn out to be
only a minority kick, and no fight.
Now is the time for the Republican press
of the interior to speak ont for home rule,
open primaries and honest politic?.
Whenever a bad odor arises from the
bubbling pot of politics you may be bum
the Southern Pacific of Kentucky has had
a hand in the soup.
Turn the light on any dark place in cur
politics and the fat rats of the railroad will
be seen scampering for their holes.
If the monopoly had the power that
some people dread it would not have to re
sort to sneaking, trickery and fraud to
carry out its schemes.
Now that the campaign has opened and
the first battle ia near it is the duty of all
loyal Republicans to see that every traitor
is driven out of the camp.
To steal a man's proxy for the purpose
of betraying his manhood is a good deal
like trying to commit manslaughter by
the tactics of petty larceny.
The Republican party will win the first
battle for honest politics in this campaign
by lashing all rascals from ita camp and
putting honest men on guard.
The power of the monopoly is dead.
That which oppresses the imagination of
the timid is but a phantom. When the
light is turned on, it vanishes.
The politics of the Kentucky company
are now carried out in this State by Mar
tin Kelly and J. H. Mahoney. To this
complexion had it come at last.
The Republican party will never need
reform so long as It retains the old forms
under wnich it became the party of the
people and the enemy of bosses.
The power of the Southern Pacific Com
pany of Kentucky is only a poison fungus
bred of corruption. It sprang up like a
toadstool and will perish like one.
Republicans of every county should
watch carefully the play of the railroad
gang. They have always a card up the
sleeve to be played at the last moment.
All loyal Republicans have aright to a
voice in the election of delegates to the
State Convention, and if they are shut out
now they will be heard from on election
day.
Republicans are resolved that their party
shall stand as a great temple dedicated to
immortal principles, but there are some
tricksters who think they can use it as a
railroad machine-shop.
It is possible to do some kind of politics
on forged proxies, just as it is possible to
make some kind of an omelet out of bad
egee, but in the one case as in the other
the smell betrays the job.
it is certain the fellows who are trying
to betray the Republican party into the
hands of the monopoly are not working
for their health, lor it is about the un
healthiest job in the State.
In devising a scheme to take the control
of the election of delegates to the Repub
lican State Convention out of the hands of
the county committees the manipulators
of the Kentucky company flattered them
selves that they had successfully cheated
the people, but there are too many intelli
gent men in the party for trickery to re
main hidden and too many honest man for
cheating to thrive.
TEE POLITICAL SITUATION.
Under the force exerted by the near ap
proach of the time of holding the National
conventions of the great parties of the
country, the varied elements that, make up
the political complexion of the people are
being rapidly crystallized into definite
groups and forces. .Republicans, Demo
crats and Populists are organizing. Inde
pendents are separating themselves from
established parties. Good men are uniting
for the public welfare and bad men aTe
confederating for selfish interests. It is
a time when every political event must
be carefully studied by the people lest any
should be betrayed into joining the wronc
groupâ a time when the press should
sneak plainly that the people may know
the truth and see where honor and the
public welfare stand.
The forces crystallizing these various
groups have been very notable in the Re
publican party of California within the
last few days. They have been strong
enough to make already a well-defined
line of cleaveage between those true Re
publicans who would use the party as an
association of patriots to uphold great
principles of government, and those self
styled Republicans who seek to make the
party a machine to be operated for the
interests of individuals or corporations.
This line of cleavage was made clear im
mediately after the recent meeting of the
Republican State Committee. At that
meeting it was decided to follow the rec
ommendation of the National Committee
and place the election of delegates to the
party convention under the control of
Congressional committees. This was so
much of an innovation on the established
order of the party in California that in
many of t lie Congressional districts it was
found that no district committees were in
existence. It became necessary to pro
vide them, and in undertaking this, the
cieavage was Immediately manifest.
A minority of the State Committee
sought to take advantage of the new rule
to overthrow the local organisation of the
party and place all power in the hands of
a few bosses. To achieve that result they
proposed to appoint a State Committee of
five, clothed with authority to appoint
Congressional committees wherever they
did not already exist. That proposition
was promptly voted down by the loyal
Republicans of the State Committee, and
the bosses met their first defeat. Imme
diately after the adjournment of the State
Committee, however, they conspired
together and began to devise plans to ob
tain by indirection that which they had
failed to gain by the suddenness of their
first trick.
In this complexion of affairs it behoove?
all loyal Republicans to adopt a plan of
action upon which they can agree and by
which they can unite to save the party
organization from the manipulators who,
almost avowedly, are working for the
Southern Pacific of Kentucky. In urging
the adoption of such a plan Thk Call has
no new or cunning scheme to offer. It
simply invites the Republican press of the
interior to co-operate in advising all Re
publicans to demand of their Congres
sional committee the adoption of the old
fashioned plan of open primaries. That
old plan is the best plan. It is honest,
and honesty is what we wi-sh.
We urge the plan with the more earnest
ness because the Congressional committee
of the First District has virtually
adopted it. This proves it to be a plan
which commends itself naturally to Repub
licans. Moreover, we believe it to be a
plan which the rank and file of the party
demand with more than usual ardor at
this time. The issues of the campaign
are great. The convention will be im
portant. Is it not right that every loyal
Republican should have a voice in de
termining the issues of the one by the
free exercise of the privilege of casting a
vote in the election of the delegates who
are to represent him at the other?
A OEEAT TOUENAMENT.
The most important bicycle tournament
ever held in the West, if not in the entire
country, was opened la3t evening at the
Mechanics' Pavilion and is to continue for
a week. The wonderful progress of the
past year will be made evident, but more
interesting than that will bo the exciting
sport of the meet. Famous racers from
all parts of tne United States are in at
tendance, and every kind of machine will
be on exhibition.
It is idle to discuss the popularity of the
bicycle as a "fad." The superiority of the
typewriter over a pen is unquestioned, and
yet fashion has never accepted the type
writer for polite correspondence â it is still
"good form" to adhere to the crabbed,
laborious and illegible process of hand
writing. For that matter the quintes
sence of good form, especially in England,
is still the auill, for the reason that it is
older and less commonplace than tne
comparatively modern steel pen. There
is too much utility in the bicycle for it
ever to become very fashionable, and it is
not nearly so expensive and showy as a
carriage, horses, groom, footman and gold
mounted harness.
This means to say that the bicycle is dis
tinctly an achievement in industrial prog
ress, and the fact that it is used so ex
tensively for health and pleasure detracts
nothing from that assertion. That it is
employed in ways other than industrial
utility is proof that it is superior to all
mechanical devices which are employed
only for industrial purposes, including the
sewing-machine and the typewriter. It is
this peculiar feature of it that has so greatly
stimulated improvements in its design and
construction. Those who employ it for
health and pleasure alone belong to that
broad-minded and aggressive upper middle
class whose intelligence and independence
represent the spirit of progress that ani
mates the age. That this is so is shown by
the fact that they to-day are assembled in
one of the most powerful organizations in
the country and that their influence in
bettering the indHstrial condition of the
people is being so strenuously exerted in
securing good roads. That achievement
alone, due to the power which the bicycle
has created, will be among the greatest for
its value and comprehensiveness that this
country has ever witnessed.
Aside from the gentlemen riders are the
sporting fraternity to which the machine
has given birth. It Is a notable fact that
the records of professional cycling are sin
gularly free from scandal. Perhaps this is
explainable on the ground that the sport
is so wholesome and exhilarating as to
have an elevating effect on character.
LESSONS Iff CLIMATE.
i
An important task which should be
undertaken without delay is that of de
termining the probable reasons for a
strange feature of the prevailing "cold
weather" in California. It appears that al
though the "snowstorm" was general all
over the State it was attended with in
jurious results in certain restricted and
well-defined areas, and that the injury
was manifested in various degrees. Such
an investigation, corrected by tiie experi
ence of past years, might prove valuable in
determining what areas are immune and
why. This would cover the elevation, the
configuration of the contiguous topog

rnphy, the prevalent direction and force of
winds, the character of the soil and drain
age and the kinds of fruit affected.
it should be borne in mind that the won
derful productiveness of the soil, aided by
the climate, has been determined only by
careful and intelligent experiment, that
the best results are those based on an un
derstanding of the' conditions appertain
ing to the industry and that with every
succeeding year new and : important les
sons are learned. The variety of climates
id California is as bewildering as that of
soils, but the remarkable feature of the
climate is its regularity. If a frost damag
ing to one kind of fruit occurs at any
particular place it may be expected to oc
cur again, and if long observation haÃ de
termined the immunity of a particular
fruit from frost at any particular place it
is safe to assume that frost may never be
expected there. It is this element of cer
tainty, as well aa that of mildness, that
constitutes one of the great advantages of
the climate.
As might have been expected, the first
reports of damage have been arreatly
modified by later reports. This is always
the case. Except in a very few places it
will doubtless be learned when the reports
have been completed that the frost has
merely saved the growers a considerable
expense required every year in thinning
the fruit, and that this, taten in connec
tion with the abundant precipitation ac
companying .the light snowfall and the
retarding effect of the cold, will add ten
times as much to the total value of the
crop as the frost detracted from it.
One thing is positive. Whatever risks
may be run in widely separated years by
very early and very late crops on the
score of frost can never affect the great
bulk of the fruit crop, which is produced
in the rainless months. This accounts for
the perfection with which fruits may be
dried in the open air, for the high per
centage of sugar and for the superiority of
raisins and wine. Many other parts of
the continent have even a milder climate
than that of the California fruit regions,
but summer rains make all the difference,
and their absence in California constitutes
the unique superiority of the State.
FOE HONEST POLITICS.
The facts which the meeting of the mem
bers of the Republican State Central Com
mittee from the Fourth Congressional
District held upon Wednesday evening
uncovered to public view with reference
to the attempted manipulation of the poli
tics of that district in the interest of the
Southern Pacitic Company show that the
time has come for citizens who believe in
honesty in politics to carry tbeir belief into
action.
When a few professional politicians,
constituting a minority of their delegation,
have the boldness to hold a midnight
meeting, without notifying their fellow
members of the committee, and by the as
sertion of possessing proxies which they
do not hold attempt to appoint the com
mittee of seven persons who shall have
charge of the primaries held for the elec
tion of delegates to the Htate Convention
from that district and after such an infamy
openly boast of their cunning, it is time
that kind of politics should receive a
rebuke.
The meeting of Wednesday evening ad
ministered that rebuke. The majority of
the Fourth Congressional delegation em
phatically repudiated the action of the
midnight conspirators and proxy-forgers
and proceeded in a regular and orderly
manner to perform the duties intrusted to
it. Thus at the very outset of the cam
paign has one notable victory been won
fqj honest politics and the tricks of the
bosses been defeated in the interests of
the Republican party and the public wel
fare.
This incident must not go unnoted by
the interior press. What nas been at
tempted by monopoly bosses in the
Fourth District will be attempted in every
Congressional district in the State where
the loyal Republicans are off their guard,
or where there is the least chance for
snch tricks to succeed. On the other hand,
what has been accomplished here to
baffle the tricksters can be accomplished
wherever there are men vigilant, courage
ous and resolved that honesty shall be
upheld. The first struggle of the cam
paign carries with it, therefore, both a
warning and an encouragement. The
rank and file of the Republican organiza*
.tion will know how to profit by both.
The battle is on, but the result is not
doubtful. It is a contest between honesty
and corruption, and honesty will win.
KESTOBING THE RATES.
In spite of the labored telegram from
New York explaining that the restoration
of the old differential between the Panama
route and the Southern Pacific was not
evidence of any disagreement between Mr.
Huntington and the Panama Railway, It
is clear that the Panama Railway forced
Mr. Huntington to restore the differential
because that road was losing business, and
in doing so compelled him to reduce rates
on the Southern Pacific to the old figure,
at the same time forcing him to reduce
rates on the Pacific Mail in order to make
it possible for the Panama Railway to do
business.
The purpose of the contract between the
Southern Pacific and the Pacific Mail on
one hand and the Panama Railway on the
other was to raise rates for the benefit of
the three companies. This raise amounted
to 50 per cent. The adjustment between
the Southern Pacific and the Panama rates
was so ingeniously made by the Southern
Pacific as to reduce the Panama differen
tial, and the result was that the Southern
Pacific carried all the freight. This roused
the indignation of the Panama Railway,
which had been already stung by charges
that it had made itself Mr. Huntington's
tool. As a matter of fact it is a most in
dependent and aggressive company.
When it discovered how woefully it had
been tricked and how it had lost all its
business to the Southern Pacific it de
manded a return to the old rates, and that
is why California is now enabled to enjoy
the benefit of that reduction. The Pan
ama Railway would have withdrawn from
the agreement had not the reduction been
made.
It will be noted that the 50 per cent raise
in overland rates was made for the sole
benefit of the Sunset route of the South
ern Pacific. The Central Pacific received
none of the benefit, as the rate to New
York by way of the Sunset and Mr. Hunt
ington's steamers, even at the increased
rate, was still better for California ship
pers than the Central Pacific with its alien
connections offered. The value of these
facts lies in their bearing on the welfare of
the Central Pacific as the property which
owes the Government a debt that Mr.
Huntington does not want to pay. When
ever there is a chance to develop business
on the Southern Pacific to the prejudice of
the Central Pacific, and to depreciate the
value of the Central Pacific as a security
for the debt which it owes the Govern
ment, we may depend upon the genius of
Mr. Huntington to discover and apply it,
as thereby he hopes to make the collection
of the debt seem all the more ill advised
as a "business proposition."
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Among the many conspicuous persons who
may be seen at the Lick House, and who in
ono way or another are molded into the his
tory of the coast, is a large man with a full
brown beard, dark clothes and uglonsy top hat.
On most all occasions he is discussing with
one or more friends some feature of mining
experience or this or that gold mine. He
owns several properties himself, and is always
ready to hear anything of interest relative to
mining. The man with the brown beard and
the silk tile is A. Harpending, who built the
Harpending block in this City.
He is the owner of the Church-Union mine,
adjoining the Church mine, in El Dorado

ville. Gossips credit Alvinza Haywaid with
having got out a million or more dollars from
this mine. One day he got angry because the
nrine tilled with water, say these gossips, and
he threw it up in disgust, believing, any way,
that he had got the bulk of the ore out of it.
But not unlike some ofher old mines, it is
said that it now promises to give big returns.
Those who tala of Harpending's luck with the
Church-Union do not forget to mention Har
pending and George D. Roberts in connection
with the notorious Arizona diamond boom,
which occurred a few years ago.
Out of it were milled large nums, lawsuit fol

Alfred Rosenholm, a Swedish engineer and
chemist employed by the Union Iron Works,
who has boon â â¢ome years in this country, is
one of the familiar figures of the corridor?.
He has lately been making investigations in
reference to an underground conduit system,
and is working on the problem of getting elec=
tricity direct from heat. He said yesterday at
the Palace:
â¢'There are so many strange things in refer
ence to this subject that words almost fail to
tell them. When we descend into the solid
portion of the earth we find a rise of tempera
ture. This rise of temperatnre has no connec
tion with the sea level, but will be found
on the highest mountain. May wo not
trace this rise of temperature to be by virtue of
a condition of matter that all bodies possess a
difference of temperature from its center to its
surface, which varies as the weight of the
mass; it is a continuous battle between mat
ter and ether and, like the planets which are
spinning around the sun, it will never find
peace or rest.
â¢'This is somewhat analogous to combustion
when carbon unites with the oxygen; the in
stant the exchange of the atoms take place the
ether gets out of equilibrium, and unless its
change of motionis intercepted by doing work,
which causes a lower temperature, it disturbs
the wijole universe.
'â Tlie energy which drives our locomotives
and turns the turbine wheels at Niagara came
from the sun. The energy exerted by the sun
and rendered latent in each pound of the car
bon would be adequate to raise a weight of
ohe ton 5000 feet. How there can be so much
power in the gentle influences of the sunbeam
is one of the exeat mysteries of nature.
"I have devoted much time toa study ot the
laws of Mature and have been rewarded with
the most striking proof as to what relation
matter stands to energy. My object has been
to produce a device by which the energy of
heat can be converted into that of electricity
without the intermediacy of steam engine and
lynamo.
"I sincerely hope that the sunshinoof science
may fall upon the public, that they may realize

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
RIVAL, BATTLE-SHIPS. '
Efficiency of the Keabsaege and Majestic
. . \ Compared.
To the Editor of Vie San Francisco Callâ
I read in a recent Issue an article copied from
a Boston journal entitled "Still Ahead." The
method adopted by the writer of determining
the relative fighting efficiency of the two
vessels is to give tho weight of the projectiles
thrown by one dischargeof the guns. To make
his point he gives figures which are erroneous .
to start with, as he credits the Kearsarge with a
battery of twelve 8-inch guns, whereas she
is only to carry four. On the other side he
gives the Majestic twelve 12-pound rapid
firing guns, whereas she carries sixteen. Cor
rected, tne Kearaarge will : carry forty-eight
guns of various calibers, the Majestic > forty
four. The aggregate weight of one discbarge
of the Kearsarge will be 5266 pounds, the of
the Majestic 4828. ', â¢ " ..
If the ships in question could determine the
result by firing but one round the comparison
would stand. But it is absolutely certain that
two powerful armorclads would be engaged
much longer before a decisive result was ob
tained. Therefore the one-round method of
determining the fighting efficiency is valueless.
The surest and only feasible method of com
parison is to ascertain the aggregate weight of
projectiles thrown by all the guns in a period
of time approximating that of a probable en
gagement. Below this is done, and by it it Is
quite evident that the advantage of possessing
(to quote the article) "the all-essential charac
teristic of battery power," the pre-eminence
rests with, the Majestic and not with the Kear
sarge. .'. .
The apparent superiority of the Kearsarge
disappears after the firing {of the first round,
lost Dy the length of time requited to load and
lay the guns of - the Kearsarge as compared to
those of the Majestic, the latter possessing the
vast advantage of having an armament of
rapid-fire guns alone. Those' of tne Kearsarge
being rapid fire for the 5 ; inch and 3 and
I pounders, the 12 and 8 inch guns, being ordi
nary slow fire. '" '. \ -..-'â ' â¢â â¢â -
The gain lies mainly with the 6-inch Els
wich rapid-fire guns of the Majestic, capable of
being fired from eight to tnirteen times per
minute. In this comparison the period of
time set is thirty minutes. It does not alter
the result if a shorter or longer period is set
except that the longer the action the greater
tne advantage of the Majestic. .

SHE PEDDLES KITTENS.
A negro woman named Mary Fletcher, who
lives near Sacramento and Jones streets, makes
her living at one of the oddest of occupations.
It is that of raising kittens and peddling thf;m
from house to house. Most people would think
that there would be uo demand for the ani
mals and that such a business would not pay,
but Mary, as she is called by ncr customers,
has been engaged in it fox a long time and
says that she can sell more kittens than she
can raise. She says thai she always gets good
prices.
The kind of kittens that Mary sells are not
what would be termed fine breeds. In fact the
breed is a matter of little importance to her
customers, and the descendant of some
common nignt-howier would most likely be
selected in preierence to a nne, aristocratic
Maltese. Mary does not ask high prices for her
kittens, and under most circumstances will
take what she can get. The lirst time she calls
at a house she may say that she wants 50 cents
tor a tortoise-shell tubby. 2 months old, but
before she leaves she may part with it for la

"live" to play with. The kind of life thÂ«
kitten leads depends altogether on the dispo
sition of the child that becomes its owner. It
may grow up into a respectable house cat, but
the chances are that "something dreadful" will
happen to it, and the child will want a new
kitten in a few days.
Where Mary gets the kittens is a mystery, but
she says that she raises them herself and
guarantees them to be well behaved. When
she takes them from house to bouse she car
ries them in a large willow basket that looks
as if it was brought from New Orleans just
after the war. The kittens poke their heads
from beneath the cover whenever they ha^'e a
chance, but do not seem the least inclined to
escape. Mary always speaks kindly to them
and bÃndles them gently when oiferinjf them
for ?ale, but does not seem to have any regard
for them after the has sold them, and the more
that meet with disaster the more she can sell.
Most of Mary's customers live in the vicinity
of Pine and 'Leavenworth streets, and she
makes regular calls at certain houses where
she knows the children are numerous and
boisterous and kittens don't last long. If
Mary calls at a house when- she is well known
and there is no demand for kittens, .she asks
if she can have some "cold vittles," and gen
erally gets them.

CRUSHED UNDER A MAST
James Groves, a Rigger, Met
Sudden Death on the John
N. Ingalls.
WATCHES A COMRADE AT WORK
The Stays Gave Way and the Stick
Fell, Making a General Havcc
of Things.
Through somebody's carelessness one
life was sacrificed on the schooner John S.
The Schooner John N. Ingalls, Whose Mast Fell Yesterday and Crushed James Groves to Death.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist]
lncalls yesterday and two men were in
jured.
The foremast was old and rotten and an
attempt was made to instep it. When
the stays were loosened it fell und crushed
the life out of James Groves, a rigger, who
lived on Vicksburg street, near Twenty
fourth.
The accident was a peculiar one and
was due in a creat measure to the rotten
ness of the mast. J. J. Hairside, who had
charge of the work, had the shears with
which the spar was to be instepped erect
ed early in the day. The task was Con
sidered a risky one, bu: very little precau
tion was taken to guard agnnst Â»n acci
dent.
When everything was ready Gus Mali
trus, employed by Hairside as a rieger.
was sent aloft to adjust the stays in order
that th. mast might be unloosened at the
bottom. He made his way rapidly up the
mast while a crowd on the wharf and sev
eral people on the vessel's deck watched
his progress. Among the people on the
deck was Groves.
"When Malitrus was almost at the end of
his climb the stays gave way and the ma3t
fell with a crash. The rigger realized his
danger in an instant and sprang from the
foremast into the rigging of the main
mast. He lost his hoid, however, and fell
to the deck, sustaining a severe contusion
of the side and an abrasion of the leg. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
treated, after which he went to his home
in East Berkeley.
Groves saw the mast coming and tried
t> getaway, but was pinned to the deck
before he could make his escape. His
back and both legs were broken and he
died a few minutes after fcaving been ex
tricated. His body was taken to the
Morgue.
la its course the mast smashed one of
the boats into splinters and crashed
through the after deckhouse. Mate A. B.
Anderson was in the cabin and had a nar
row escape. He had resigned his position
and was packing his belongings prepara
tory to going ashore. He had just put on
his hat when the mast crushed through
the cabin and knocked it off his head and
gave him a severe scalp wound. He was
attended to at an adjoining drugstore, and
after getting his things ashore went away
congratulating himself on his narrow
escape.
The Ingalis seems to have been in very
hard luck of late. It is not long ago that
she arrived here from Mexican ports very
short of provisions. When off the Farail
oncs aJI that there was left aboard was
some flour and brackish water, and on
that the crew had been subsisting for over
a week. When she wa3 docked it was
discovered that her masts were dryrotted
and would have to be replaced before the
schooner could sail on another voyage.
While this was being done the fatality
occurred.
"TRUSTIES" GET DRUNK.
V. Veso, a Restaurant Waiter, Arrested
for Carrying Liquor Into the
City Prison.
V. Veso, waiter in a restaurant on Mc-
Allister street, opposite the City Hall, was
arrested yesterday morning by Captain
RobinÃOn and booked on the charge of
carrying whisky into the prison. He was
released on $300 bonds.
Captain Rouinson had been noticing for
some days that the "trusties" 1n the
prison were in a condition of semi-intoxi
cation, and one of them was so drunk on
Wednesday that he had to be locked up in
a cell. A search was made and several
empty flasks were found hidden under the
mattresses in the beds of the "trusties."
Several more were found in a cell where
buckets and other utensils were kept.
Suspicion fell upon Veso, who supplied
meal 6to prisoners able to pay for liiem,
and yesterday morning, when he entered
the prison with his tray, he was searched
and a flask of whisky was found in his
pocket. He confessed that he had been
hupplying the ''trusties" with the liquor.
He charged them a liberal commission,
eometimes 100 per cent. He will not be
permitted to supply meals to prisoners
any more.
PATIENCE REWARDED.
Mrs. Susan Coon After Nearly a Month's
Siege is Arrested.
Mrs. Susan Coon, 927 Howard street,
who in July last was sentenced in the Po
lice Court to six months' imprisonment for
cruelty to Elmer Johnston, a boy living
with her, has given the officers of the So- j
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to ;
Children considerable trouble.
She appealed to the Superior Court from
the sentence, and on February 10 the
judgment of the lower court was affirmed.
She was out on appeal bonds, and when i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
judgment was given she hurried home
and defied the officers to take her out.
Since then the officers have adopted all
sorts of devices to get her to leave the
house, but she was too wary to be caught.
Yesterday afternoon Officer McMurray and
Holbrook were gladdened by the sight of
her leaving the house, and 'they immedi
ately pounced upon her and took her to
the City Prison. She will now have to
serve tier six months' senttnee.
FASTIDIOUS ORB.
He Is Given a Change of Quartern
to the Alameda County
Jail.
Charles W. Orr made a successful plea
before the United States District Court
yesterday, asking tbat his quarters be
changed from the County Jail in thi3 City
to the Aiampfta jail. Orr is one of the
most cruel second mates who have ever
sailed into port. On March 4 he was sen
tenced to one month's imprisonment for
nearly beating to death a sailor named
J. W. Smith.
In his plea Orr claimed that the local
jail was filled with filth and murderers,
neither of which he cared to mingle with.
Then again he claimed his health was
being seriously impaired by the bad
sewerage.
JEWELER SCHMIDT GONE.
Locks Up His Store, at 1034 Mar
ket Street, and Departs
Secretly.
His Liabilities Are About $18,000, Half
of Which Is Due Local
Creditors.
Peter P. Schmidt, a jeweler who has
been doing business at 1034 Market street
for several years, is missintr, or, rather, is
absent, for there is no mystery regarding
the reason of his departure.
Creditors holding biLl<Â« amounting to
about $15,000 or $18,000 would like to
know more regarding his affairs.
It is not known just the date of Schmidt's
departure, but it is thought that he locked
up his store and left about the first of last
week. For some time his affairs have
been unsatisfactory to his creditors.
Efforts were made to get some kind of a
settlement, but no action was taken till
last Friday, when a Deputy Sheriff came
down on the place with a writ of attach
ment. Then he found that the jeweler
had plumed himself for flight and went
well loaded with the contents of the es
tablishment. The store was literally
emptied of everything of any great value.
Diamonds, watches and a large number of
other costly articles that were known to
hare been in stock had disappeared with
the disappearing proprietor.
It is not yet known how mnch Schmidt'B
liabilities are. but it is known that his
debts to local firms will reach $8000 and
that he owes Eastern jewelry firms an
equal sum. His principal creditors here
are: Carrau & Green, A. Green, A. Eisen
berg ft Co., A. I. Hall & Son. E. Hirsch
field & Co., Nordmann Bros., Armer &
Weinshenk, California Optical Company,
L. A. Giaccobbi, George Greenzweig & Co.
A member of the firm of Carrau & Green,
220 Sutter street, stated yesterday that
Schmidt's failure and flight amounted to
downright felony, as he carried away all
the valuable stock in his store. Warrants
will be sworn out for his arrest, and he
will be charged with defrauding his credi
tors.
Attorney A. Heyneniann, who represents
the Eastern firms, stated yesterday that it
has been known for some time that
Schmidt's affairs were not in a good con
dition, but it was not expected that he
would get away with the plunder and so
smoothly.
Take it all together it is considered a
remarkably successful clean-up, and it is
thought that the creditors will realize little
or nothing in the settlement.
SATURDAY'S GAME.
The Interest Still Growing in the Boys'
Brigade Football Content.
The game to be played at Central Park
on Saturday afternoon between the Boys'
Brigade Second and Fifth Regiment teams
promises to be one of much interest. The
teams have been practicing daily, and a
close contest is expected by the supporters
of both regiments. Many of the pro
fessionals about the bay will watch the re
sult with interest.
Bob Plater, fullback on the Stanford
team, says of Bishop and Davidson, half
back of the Fifth: "By the time they
reach college they will make Varsity men
in their first year." This speaks well for
the Fifth's boy p.
Middlemas, playing guard in the Olym
pics, will act as umpire, and W. B.
Hughson, who played tackle on the Mari
etta College team, will be the referee.
The colors of the Second Regiment are
blue and gold, and that of the Fifth Regi
ment red and gold. The First Brigade
band, B. ti. C, has been hard at work pre
paring for the occasion, and the grand
concert at 2:30 will be worth hearing.
Among the number of pieces selected for
the concert is the famous "King Cotton
March." At the Oakland Exposition this
band was Highly praised by the manage
ment, and especialJv for the perfect man
ner in which it rendered "King Cotton," it
being encored twice on this piece. Rain
on shine a large and enthusiastic crowd is
expected.
The Second Regiment team and the
band will arrive at the foot of Market
street at 2 f. h.
NEW EPISCOPAL MISSION
South San Francisco Is About
to Build Itself a
Church.
FIRST IN THE COMMUNITY.
At Present the Town Has No Place of
Worshipâ Tasteful Plans Are
Accepted.
Work will be commenced in the course
of the next few weeks on the first church
in South San Francisco. It will be an on.
pretentious but pretty building, resem
bling in general outlines the chapel at Cy
press Lawn.
For several years past efforts have been
made by different denominations to arouse
enough popular interest in the spiritual
needs of the town to result in a church
being built, but Rev. George Wallace of St.
Margaret's School, San Mateo, is the
clergyman who has finally succeeded in
getting together the funds and mating ar
rangements for erecting the first church
building within the limits of the town of
South San Francisco.
Some months ago Mr. Wallace was ap
pointed by Bishop Nichols to carry on a
mission in South San Francisco. Services
were held in Pioneer Hall, and before long
le Episcopal Mission Which Is About to Be Erected at South San Francisco.
a church organization was effected with
thirty members andaSunday-BChool num
bering over fifly pupils.
About six months ago Mr. Wai 'ace con
sidered that the time was ripe to take ac
tion toward establishing the mission in a
building of its own. An enthusiastic
meeting was held in Pioneer Hall and
temporary organization was effected for
the raising of funds. Rev. George Wal
lace was unanimously chosen to be presi
dent, E. E. Cunningham was made vice
president and George R. Sneath treasurer.
The new society adopted resolutions
pledging itself to raise fundsfor buildingan
Episcopalian church in South San Fran
cisco, and W. J. Martin, R. K. Patchell and
Charles Johnson volunteered to be a com
mittee to collect funds. Ever since the or
ganization there has been a great amount
of enthusiasm in the little town over its
proposed church. All denominations i^nt
a helping hand and subscriptions came
pouring in at such a rate that enough
money has now been subscribed to defray
the expenses of building.
The South San Francisco Land and Im
provement Company lias donated a lot 50
feet by 140 feet at the corner of Grand
and Spruce avenues, on condition that
the trustees build. The title deeds will be
delivered over as soon as the church is
completed. The same company has also
donated the sum of $150 toward the build
ing fund. George R. Sneath, W. J. Mar
tin and Herbert B. Maggs have been
elected trustees and the building, when
completed, will be held in their name.
The plans adopted resemble in general
effect the chapel at Cypress Lawn, but
there will be less stone in the building.
The length of the church will be 50 feet,
its breadth 36 feet ami its altitude from the
floor to the roof of the main building 40
feet.
At the side will be a spire, which will
rise to a considerabiy higher altitude.
The church will be placed in the middle of
the lot. There will be two entrances, with
a drive at tiie south side leading to Grand
avenue. Near the north entrance, some
little distance from the church, will be a
carriage shed for stabling the br.ggies of
the faithful who live at a distance from
the church. The carriage shed will be 18*
50 feet.
Wood and stone are to be the materials
used in the construction, and it is ex
pected that the building will cost from
$1200 to $IjoO, though if more money comes
in than is anticipated the church will be
made more costly.
South San Francisco has a population of
675 inhabitants and there is considerable
interest in the community over the tirst
church in the town. At present the Rev.
George Wallace is in the East, but worlc
will be commenced on the building im
mediately he returns.
WITH BRONZED NATIVES
Or. G. A. Le Fron'i Self-Sacrificing
Work at Delhi for the Moham
medans and Hindoos.
Dr. G. A. Le Fron of Cambridge Univer
sity, England, who has been seventeen
years at Delhi, Northern India, engaged
in educational and religious work, is at the
Occidental.
He arrived yesterday on the Australia,
broken in health, and is going home to re*
cuperate.
"There are forty of us over there,'' he
said, "including six bachelors. We carry
on a general religious and educational
work in Delhi and in different parts of
Northern India. We also have a large
hospital which we have recently com
pleted at Delhi and nave en extensive
medical work, which is carried on by
women.
"I have labored so long and so arduously
that now my health is broken. I had to
give it up in October last and I shall stay
in England till I recover.
"The Mohammedans and Hindoos have
quit the fighting which they carried on so
viciously some months ago, but they hate
each other just as bad as ever. They are
also about as superstitious as formerly. It
is hard to get them out of it. Rtill, our
people are getting alonsc as well as could
be expected in toe educational and reli
gious work. TakÂ« it all together, we are
yery well pleased."
Dr. Le Fron will only be here a few days.
He is anxious to get back to his home,
from which he has been absent so many
years. .^____________
SPARROW NOT A GYPSY.
The Mantle of Authority Falls
Upon the Shoulders of
His Son.
The Dead Chief Forsook Country and
Friends for His Gypsy
Bride.
The little gypsy camp on Fifteenth street
is in mourning.
Romany stoicism is not proof against
the loss of the patriarch and leading spirit
of the tribe, who lies on a sable bier in the
most pretentious tent of the settlement.
Even George Sparrow, next to the eldest
son of the dead chief, to whom all turn for
counsel, could not restrain his tears as be
talked of the dead man.
It is understood that unless the oldest
member of the family, Richard Sparrow,
who lives in New York, consents to come
West and assume those duties the mantle
of authority will fall upon the shoulders
of George.
Thus far all efforts to communicate with
Richard have been fruitless.
Mrs. Sparrow, the widow, went to Oak
land yesterday to make such business ar
rangements as were necessary for the
funeral. Friends and relatives watched
with the dead.
It was a romantic story that MrÂ«. Bath
sheba Warton of San Jose, a daughter of
the dead chief, tells of her father's life.
'My father was not a gypsy," she said
between her sobs. "He was an educated
man, and at several times in his life was
wealthy. He was mate on an English ves
sel running between Liverpool ana New
York, and on one of the voyages he met
my mother, who was coming to America
with her parent*. Though she was little
more than a child, he fell in love with
her, and shortly after they arrived in New
York.
"My mother soon tired of the confine
ment of city life. She longed for gypsy
freedom and persuaded my father to join
her in wandering with her tribe. They
had a handsome home just out of New
York, but she was never contented there
when they spent a few months there in
the interim of their travels. He lost that
with other of his property through specu
lation. He gave up business and all the
ties of the life he was used to to please my
mother, and they lived thus for forty
years. Mother was the first gypsy who
came to California, and I was the firstborn
here."
William Sparrow was a member of the
Church of England. W. A. M. Breck,
associate rector of tne Church of St. John
the Evangelist, was with him when he
died and will conduct the burial service.

DEVOTED TO THEIR FLAG
Communications to Corps Com*
manders of the Salva
tion Army,
SYMPATHY FROM CANADA.
Eva Booth Says Her Heart Is Broken
Over the Recent Trouble and
Calls for Prayers.
The Salvation Army officers are in fre
quent receipt of communications from
National headquarters calculated to con
firm them in their loyalty to the flag.
The captains of the several stations yester
day received the following circular letter
from Commissioner Eva Booth:
The Salvation Army National Head-)
quarters, 120-124 W . Fourteenth street, >
New York City, February 26, 1896.)
My Dear Comrade: Now that the general has
appointed me to the command of the United
States until the arrvial of the new^commis
sioners I hasten to place myself In your hands
in this season of deep and heart-rending sor
row to be of what service God can enable me
to push forward the salvation of souls.
It has piven me untold comfort in this ter
rible storm to receive assnrauces of loyalty
irom the brigadiers, divisional and field staff.
Every hour brings rue from all parts of the
field testimonies of the sorrow felt on the one
hand and of unswerving loyalty on the other.
1 will therefore confine my first letter to you
to expressing a few heartfelt feelings suggested
by the circumstances of the hour:
1. Do not be influenced to a final decision
on the whole case until the general's return to
England, when he has promised to fully con
sider and decide upon the issues involved.
2. Remember, that heavy and bitter as is the
blow that has lallen upon you, which 1 fain
would have shielded you irom had it been
possible, it cannot be as painfnl as for those of
his own lamily, who would gladly have laid
down their lives to avert ihe disaster.
3. Let me ask you to fix your mind upon the
principles at stake. Should the general make
one law for America and another for India?
apply one law to his son and another to his
brigadiers and field officers ? These questions
lie at the root of the present distress, and it is
to preserve the unity of the whole army that
the general has felt it right to decide and act
as he has done.
4. Be true to your pledges. The gaze of the
whole world is fixed upon America, and
especially on its officers, at this hour. I be
lieve in you. I believe it because of your past
faithfulness and devotion, because of struggles
through which you have lought and because
of the victories won for the cause in the past,
and because you know tne power as well as the
grace of obedience.
5. Stand by the army. It Is world-wide in Its
unity, benevolence and purpose.
6. Be careful to avoid encouraging any party
or personal feeling. Cultivate the gift of love,
speak evil of and think evil of no one.
7. Have faith in God! We shall overcome.
But we can only do so by fighting in the con
fidence that our principles are divine.
8. Give me your trust. I am alone. My
heart is broken. This command has been sud
denly and unexpectedly given me. I feel my
responsibility, and I want to bless you and
help you aud guide you.
0. Pray for me. Write me concerning your
sorrow. " I am a sharer of it, and with what
consolation I receive I shall give, and I am
tture I need not, ask you to continually remem
ber before the throne our beloved generalâ the
father of our movement. His spirit will be
tornâ his heart lacerated. Our prayers and
love must sustain him.
I pray that the God of all grace and peace
wilt fill you with consolation, and the power of
the Holy Ghost give you courage and desperate
faith, and while the waters of this grief beat
rudely around us unity shall be our strength
while y e stand 'neath the shadow of the cross
and the wave of the Salvation Army flag.
Kely upon me as your sister and comrade in
this holy war for God, America and the world.
Eva C. Booth. Commissioner.
The following, also, conveying the sym
pathy of tne army of Canada, signed by
seventy-eight officers, was received:

To- Chi r Comrade Officers of the United Statesâ
Dearly Beloved Comrades: We have learned,
with the profoundest sorrow, of the resignation
from the army of Commander and Mrs. Bai
lington Boo:h, who, until a few hours ago,
were your loved and successful leaders.
With tbe difficulties leading up to this we
have no desire to interfere. Under any cir
cumstances their withdrawal from us must be
a sad and irreparable loss.
We address yon now only to assure you of our
affectionate arid sincere sympathy iv the heavy
trial through which you are passing. We are
in the better position to sympathize with you.
because.we have passed through the same sort
of difficulties. W e have had the press and the
enemies of union arrayed against us. We have
had to combat the evil influences of misunder
standing and misrepresentation, but God has
ever and always come to our assistance and
vindicated us before the world.
We are now more than ever thankful that in
those hours of distress we stood by the old ring
aud fought for our world-wide principles. We
feel sure you will do the same. We are bound
together by ties of brotherly love and comrade
ship which the world knows nothing about.
VÂ» c pray for you as only those can pray whose
hearts have been welded together in the fires
of iiffcction and persecution, Tie not dismayed !
God will, we are sure, show himself strong in
your Deualf. Remember, there is a silver lin
ing to every dark cloud, and good may yet
come from the incidents of the past few days.
We are sorry that it Is not possible for us to
be by your sides to render that service which
our hearts yearn to do; be assured, however,
that we are with you in spirit, and that we
travail in soul for the great army of warriors
which, under the good hand of God, you have
been instrumental in raising up; that he may
preserve them from anything that would make
ii harder for them to serve God or support the
lofty principles in which we have all gloried
from the beginning.
CouLt on us to carry on the war in Canada
till we greet you with a shout in the morning.

The Panama Railroad Com

Latest Victim.
A MYSTERY IS SOLVED.
Why the Southern Pacific Is
Apparently Hostile to the
Pacific Mail.

Collis P. Huntington is again demon-
Ftrating that he is entitled to bis boast of
being "the man who has never been
thrown." His victim this time is the
THE LONG TRAIN OF TRUCKS WAITING THEIR TURN AT THE PACIFIC MAIL DOCK.
Panama Railroad Company. He has
that company underneath and he is in a
position to keep it there just as long as he
pleases, judging from the present outlook. I
On Tuesday last The Call published the j
fact 3 showing that a bitter and determined
rate war on eastbound business from this j
City to New York had been inaugurated j
apparently between the Panama Railroad :
Company and the Pacific Mail Steamship j
Company on one side and the Southern ;
Pacific Company and its railroad allies on j
the other. Recent developments, how
ever, show that the only sufferer in this
contest is now and is likely to continue to |
be the Panama road.
As the situation is now, with but a $2
differential between the all-rail route and ;
the isthmus route, not a ton of freight is
likely to be offered to the water-line car
riers.
From a shipper who is deeply interested
in through freight, it was learned yester- |
day that the Panama people have asked
their ally, the Pacific Mail, to put into
effect before the 7th inst., when the next ;
steamer leaves here, a 30-oent rate on east
bound business. The rate at present is 40 j
cents per 100 pounds. With a 30-cent rate '
in operation, there would be a difference
of $4 per ton between the rail rates and the !
steamer rates, and it is thought this will i
divert at least some small quantity of j
business to the water line.
K. H. Hinton, general agent of the :
Panama, confirmed the report that his j
company had asked fora 3o-cent eastbound
rate, but Manager R. P. Schwerin of the j
Pacific Mail said, late yesterday afternoon,
that he had not been officially advised of i
such a demand, and could not, therefore, j
tell what would be done toward putting j
such a rate into effect.
liut even if this rate is put in, the strain
in the situation will not by any means be
relieved, and before harmony is restored
there will nave to be a complete readjust- '
ment of rales. This can only be accom- ,
phshed by making rates that will give the i
steamship people a differential of not less |
than $5, as was the case prior to 1893, when i
the Pacific Mail had complete control of j
the Panama route traffic between San
Francisco and New York.
Considerable speculation has been in- '
dulged in touching the peculiar situation '
of affairs, which apparently places C. P. j
Huntington, president of the Southern !
Pacific Company, in direct opposition to j
C. P. Huntington, president of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company.
To the uninformed and disinterested ob- |
server it appears as if Mr. Huntington i
were using his railroad property to injure j
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and !
through it the Manama Railroad Company, j
But Mr. Huntington is tooshrewn a finan- j
cier and manipulator to indulge in any sucn I
unbusinesslike practice. He is, according !
to facts ascertained yesterday, simply try
ing to play a game of freezeout acainst the
Panama Railroad Company, and would j
have been completely successful but for !
the prompt and energetic action of the !
Panama people.
Shortly nfter the contract between the
Pacific Mail and the Panama road was
signed, last December, both rail and
steamer rates were advanced, leaving a
difference of $3 between the rail and water
routes, the latter, of course, quoting the
lower schedule. This differential, it was j
found, failed to bring business to the Pan- I
atna route and, despite tne fact that the j
recently signed contract provides that the
Pacific Mail should furnish a certain ;
amount of tonnage to the steamers of the j
Columbian line on the Atlantic side, the i
Pacific Mail failed to do anything to In
duce freight to move via Panama. This
inertia brought out % demand from the
Panama people for a reduction of the 60
--cent rate between San Francisco and New
York to 40 cents. After a correspondence
extending over two weeks the Pacific Mail !
finally acceded to the request of its ally
and announced such a rate to go into
effect on the steamer to leave on the 7th j
inst. All the benefit that ought to
have accrued from this action was pre
vented, however, by the prompt retalia-J
tion of the Southern Pacific, which put in j
a rate of 50 cents per luO pounds.
In a conversation with Manager ,
Schwerin of the Pacific Mail that gentle- j
man stated that the present misunder- '.
: standing between tiie railroads and the
I steamship lines which operate via Panama
i was caused by the impatience of the Pan
j &ma Company. He claimed that the 60
--j cent rate Had not been given a fair test at
i the time the Panama people insisted on;
the reduction to 40 cents, ana that this j
reduction had forced the railroad com
pany to strike its heavy blow cm Monday.
When asked whether the Pacific Mail :
was in position to handle freight for New
j York, Mr. Schwerin replied that on the
! steamer which left last for Panama be
! tween 400 and 500 tons of througu freight i
could have been carried, but that there j
was little movement at the present season j
in castbound freight. He added that the j
steamer to leave Saturday next would j
have been able to take 500 or (iOO tons of \
freight had it not been for the reduced
rates pin in by the railroad.
But shippers have a vastly different tale j
to tell. At no time for many months, i
they say, have the steamers of the Pacific !
.Mail been able to accommodate even the
bn&inesa between this City and Panama '
and way ports, let alone through business. !
How the merchants feel on the matter is j
clearly shown in the statement made yes- j
terday dv one of the largest s-hippers to j
Central America. This gentleman said |
the grievance of lack of shipping facilities j
afforded by the Pacitic Mail to Central
American ports was oue of long standing, i
He then continued:
The I'acific Mail has certainly undertaken to j
do more than It can accomplish wnon it offers i
to carry through freight to New York on its i
steamers that leave here. 'Why, the present !
service of the company is entirely inadequate [
to handle the freight offered now for Central
American ports alone. There are two reasons
lor this. One reason is that their steamers are
not large enough or they hsve not enough of;
them; ana the second Is the lack of dock ca- j
parity. The last two steamers from Panama |
brought through cargoes of New York freight, j
They were discharged at the Pacific Mail dock j
and their cargoes tookup the entire room on |
the dock. This prevented the steamers from
receiving Central American cargo until all
this freight was hauled away. The Central
American business reauires that freteht shall
be very carefully packed and that strict atten- !
tion be paid to all the details of shipping. I
There are long invoices to be made out in the I
Spanish language, and it requires a good j
week's time to prepare some of the Central
American shipments. By the steamers not |
having adequate dock room and not receiving j
freight until two days before sailing the mer- j
chants are greatly ' inconvenienced, because
their goods cannot be shipped in proper con
dition with these drawbacks. The necessary
papers cannot be made out for lacK oi time.
and to ship even what we do necessitates
keeping our offices open all night for one or
two nights before the steamer's departure.
In New Yorfc and other ports all steamship
companies receive freight whenever it is offered
to them and are only too glad to get it, but the
custom here is a most provincial one, requir
ing as it does that freight shall only be offered
certain days before a steamer sails.
Now as to the incapacity of their steamers.
On the steamer tbat leaves Saturday we de
sired to ship about fiOO tons of freight for
various Central American ports, but couid only
secure the privilege of shipping 800 tons. The
left over freight will only be tflken on subse
quent steamers, some of it not until the third
steamor after this one.
How in the face of this they can undertake
to handle any eastbound New York freight I
cannot see.
That the Pacific Mail Company has come
at last to a realization of its dockage in
capacity is shown by the application ithaÃ
made to the Haibor Commissioners for
the use of the Lombard-street pier for New
York freights. The matter was considered
by the Harbor Commissioners yesterday
anu the secretary was instructed to com
municate with 'Goodall, Perkins & Co.,
who now have the use of Lombard pier,
and ask them to have a representative
present at the next meeting of the board.
It is proposed to give the Pacific Mail the
use of one-half that dock if such an ar
raneement can be made.
This lack of dock facilities is also a great
nuisance and inconvenience to the dray
men who haul the freight for shippers,
and a visit to the Pacific Mail dock yes
terday showed a long line of trucks and
drays stretched outside of the wharf, each
drayman impatiently waiting a chance to
get "rid of his load. This continued nearly
all day long, and is a scene that occurs
every ten days, two days prior to the sail
ing of each" steamer for Panama. It is
further claimed by shippers that these in
adequate provisions for handling Central
American Dusiness is tending to drive that
trade in part to other ports.
All mystery regarding the apparent hos
tile attitude of Mr. Huntington's Southern
Pacific Company to Mr. Huntington's Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company disappears
when it is shown that the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company is in a position to
make vastly more money by being de
prived of through eastbound business than
by having to give up some of its space
to it.
And this can be readily seen to be the
case when it is known that Central Ameri
can business pays from $8 to $20 a ton, and
that throucb freight only costs, under the
present schedule, $8 a ton, 56 per cent of
which, or $4 40, goes to the Panama Kail
road Company. It is therefore a choice,
so far as the Pacific Mail is concerned, j
between carrying freight that will return j
it from $8 to $20 a tonor freight that will i
give it but $3 GO.
And Mr. Huntington is cleverly utiliz
ing his Southern Pacific Company in such j
a way as to prevent any possibility of Ihe j
Pacific Mail Steamship Company being
asked to accept any through eastbound j
business.
Meanwhile the Panama Railroad Com
pany's steamers on the Atlantic side con
tinue to sail from Colon with plenty of j
space for through New York freight which j
never comes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
DRIED OLIVES FOR FOOD.
People Can Live Well on This
Diet for Five Cents a
Day.
MAY PROVE A NEW INDUSTRY.
The State Board of Trade Is Preparing
a Novel and Attractive Wine
Exhibit.
Manager J. A. Filcher of the State
Board of Trade has received a communi
cation of rare interest from Southern
California regarding the raising of olives
for drying purposes.
If dried olives possess all the qualities
claimed L>y their advocate a new industry
may be developed in this State and eco
nomical persons be farnisbed with a food
product, palatable and hightly nutritious,
which will cost not more than 5 cents a
day.
W. S. Manning of Ballard, Santa Bar
bara County, has sent a sample of the
dried fruit for the inspection of the Board
of Trade. He contends that no product
on earth contains as much of the ele
ments of nutrition necessary for the sus
tenance of the boay as a ripe olive. The
dried fruit will of course contain all these
qualities, and all that is necessary to ren*
der it pleasant to the taste is soaking and
salting it.
The oil of the olive is equal to meat, and
the pulp is as good as bread.
"The idea o? drying olives originatedin
Europe," said Mr. Pitcher yesterday, "and
frugal people have lived on this dried
fruit in the countries of Spain and Italy
from time imm emorial.
"This is the first time, however, that the
industry has been introduced into this
State. The pickli ng of ripe olives origin
ated in California, and the superiority of
the ripe in preference to the green oiive
pickled is conceded by all who have eaten
them. People were highly surprised to
find the ripe fruit finely flavored after
being treated in the usual way.
â¢'Three or four years ago there were
only 300 or 400 gallons pickled in this
State. Now you can safely assert that
there are tens of thousands of gallons.
The demand has ever grown in rapid
increase over the supply, and to this time
the supply has not been large enough to
warrant sending to the Eastern markets.
Pickled olives sent there have met with a
warm reception. There is, in fact, an un
limited demand for the ripe pickled
olives."
Near Sacramento they are planting an
| olive orchard of 280 acres, and in Southern
California one grove of 300 acres is being
set out.
W. S. Manning is the pioneer of the dried
olive in this country. He has a large
orchard down in Santa Barbara.
He says he finds that a nickel's worth a
day seasoned with other fruit amply suf
ficient to nourish a man for a hard "day's
work. He finds people not fond of them
at first, but after eating them awhile
they acquire a taste which prompts them
to prefer dried olives to any other diet.
The fruit resembles dried prunes, but lias
a peculiar flavor.
The Board of Trade in installing its ex
hibit in its new quarters is preparing one
feature heretofore lacking by proposing to
make a strong and attractive exhibit of
California wines independent of the regu
lar county exhibit. The idea is Mr. Fil
cber's.
"No exhibit of California products in
my estimation," said he, "is complete
without wine being a chief feature. This
State produces 60 per cent of all the wine
produced in the United States. The inten
tion is to make this a very prominent and
attractive exhibit.
"Along the entire length of the rear end
of the room I have caused to be made
eleven large frames with plush on the
bevel and burnished gilt moldings. These
are 3 feet by 5 feet. In each one of these
frames one producer is given space to ex
hibit his bottled wines.
"Above the row of frames a series of
electric lights will reflect down on the
wines. A card on each frame will give
the name of the producer.
"The California Viticultural College has
promised to furnish us abundant aid in
the perfecting of this idea."
A dispatch was received by Mr. Filcher
yesterday afternoon from Charles J,
Brooks of New York City, which reads as
follows:
J A. Filcher. State Board, of Trade: Mark
Stone states proposed California State Exposi
tion closed its doors. Your article was effect
ive, beat letter to-day. Full particulars.
Charles J. Brooks.
"I sent a statement through Jeffreys,
A. D. Montague," said Mr. Filcher,
"which was published in the New York
Sun. I said in that article that no reputa
ble person and certainly no representative
body had any connection with this under
taking and knew nothing whatever about
it. The originators advertised that their
headquarters were at the Mills building
and that their agent was Wells, Fargo &
Co, but I made inquiries and found that
neither the Mills building people nor the
express company knew anything about
them.
"Letters have been flooding the State
about this tning and many people have
subscribed for space. Their whole scheme
was to sell space and they cared not a
whit whether there was an exposition held
or not. I bave telegraphed to W. H. Mills

MARRIED UNDER AGE.
Family of Rosie Oliver Nee Brady
Anxious to Find Her and
Her Spouse.
The big brother of 17-year-old Rosie
Brady is very desirous of laying hands on
one Emmanuel E. Oliver who procured a
marriage licence yesterday on the strength
of his oath that Rosie was 18 years of age.
Oliver is a man about 35 years old and
the family o f the girl declare they have
found out that he has been thrice married
in the past. His two first wives are deau
and he is divorced from the third.
Royie disappeared on the night she was
married and no trace can be found either
of horor of Oliver.
John Brady, her brother, reported the
case to Ollicer Holbrook yesterday morn
ing. He stated that Oliver was a contract
ing painter and that he had been under
Oliver's employ. Oliver had been stopping
at his mother's house, 143 Minna street,
for several days, and on Monday
Oliver, Rosie, himself and a young lady, a
relative, had gone to the Orpheum. After
the theater they had supper together.
The girl disappeared after this with Oli
ver. A marriage license was granted by
the clerk, and trie two were married by
the Rev. Mr. Fuendeling.
Ihe brother said that Oliver had been
told distinctly that Rosie was 17. He
thinks that Oliver came to their house
simply to ingratiate himself with the fam
ily trie girl.
The girl's family in following up the
record of the man claim to have discov
ered him to have been connected with the
abduction of a girl from Sacramento.
Oliver's headquarters were on Market
street, near the Jerries. A policeman tele
phoned to General McComb that he had
found a sign in that locality with Oliver's
name on it.
The family intend to prosecute Oliver
for perjury in swearing Rosie to be of a
marriagable age, and the brother swears
to make it otherwise unpleasant.for him.
FEWER CHILDREN DYING
Results of a Rigid Inspection of
. the City's Milk
Supply.. .
Arguments That Will Be Used by the
Board of Health on the
Supervisors.
Secretary Godchaux and Assistant Sec
retary Zobel of the Board of Health have
just finished the compilation of a mass of
figures tending to show that the rigid
system of milk . inspection established . by
the present board has largely decreased
the death rate < among children in this
City, and that Inspector Dockery's work
has been of vast, importance to the Health
Department.
. These figures will probably be used as
an argument to convince the Board of Su
pervisors that the additional milk inspec
tors which the Health Department desires
to appoint are necessary, and that the in
terests of the public health demand that
these offices be created.
The most prevalent diseases among chil
dren > that can be traced to an impure or
adulterated milk supply are cholera, en
teritis, marasmus and inanition, the latter
being traceable more to . insufficient
strength in milk than to any other cause.
Inspector Dockery has beeD in office
about five months, and a comparative
statement of the deaths among children
from the diseases, mentioned during his
incumbency and of the deaths for the five
months preceding his appointment has
been drawn. It is as follows:

The difference appears greater when it is
understood that the death rate from the
disease mentioned is naturally larger dur
ing the cold months of the year than it is
I in the warm season.
The scarcity of typhoid cases is also
noted by Dr. Parramore, who states that
the water used to dilute milk usually
comes from the ranch well into which ty
phoid germs are quite likely to find their
way from the tilth of the cattle pens. The
requirements of the new ordinance in re
lation to the; strength of milk has pre
vented the use of such copious quantities
of water as were formerly introduced into |
the milk. â ;:
PROTESTED TAXES.
The Trustees of Mrs. Fair's Estate
Want Some Money Bark.
The trustees of the estate of Theresa
Fair are suing the City and its Tax Collec
tor for the recovery of taxes, paid under
protest, on the personal property left by
Mrs. Fair.
The amount sued for is $28,445. and the
parties suing are John \V. Mackay and 11.
V. Dey.
The property assessed improperly, it is
claimed, consists of bonds held in New
York. These were 1855 $1000 bonds of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company of
Arizona, valued at $1,855,000, and twenty
seven $1000 bonds of the West Shore Rail
road Company of New York, valued at
$27,000. \\ hen the Assessor first inspected
the estate he was satisfied with including
only $3000 worth of household furniture,
owned by the estate, but the Board of
Equalization added the bonds afterward.
Subsequently, however, the assessment
was reduced $600,000 by striking off 600
of the bonds of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, leaving 1226 at a valuation of $1,225,
--000, and the $27,000 worth of other bonds.
The City tax rate for the year ending
June 30, iÃ9ti, was set at $1 56VÂ£ and the
State tax rate at 6&}>i cents, lhis made
the City taxes $20,0ttf 30 and the State
taxes $8781 70. These amounts were paid
into the Treasurer's office on November 19,
1895, and at the same time a written pro
test was filed, setting forth a variety of
reasons why the taxes should not be paid,
and notifying the Tax Collector that he
and the City would be made responsible
for the amount.
The points of the protest are made part
of the complaint. It is alleged that the
bonds taxea are not in this State, nor are
the companies which issued them located
in this State, and therefore they are not
liable for taxation here.

PILOT FEES DISCUSSED
The Committee on Commerce
Adopts Measures for
Economy.
FAT INCOMES OF THE PILOTS.
In the Interest of the Port's Pros
perity a Bill Will Be Prepared
to Reduce Them.
An interesting report on pilotage in this
port was read yesterday before the San
Francisco committee of commerce in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce. The
report came from a sub-committee and
was adopted, with its suggestions and rec
ommendations, for a new system that
would secure lower rates of pilotage in the
harbor."
Reviewing the subject the sub-commit
tee stated:
The amount of money which the pilots actu
ally collect and the amount which the present
law authorizes them to collect are widely dif
ferent. This is due to a system of discrimina
tions iv the collection of pilotage. One result
of the tiresent extravagant pilot monopoly is
that the pilotÃ seek to fortify their petition
and to head off and keep down opposition by
means of widespread preferences in the col
lection of pilot charges. A .ship-owner who
possesses political influence or who is known
as a vigorous man and likely to give trouble is
relieved from paying a large portion of the
pilot fees the law says he should pay. The
pilots Bimply do not collect the full amount.
A regular system of differentials has been thus
built up by which the powerful are favored at
the expense of the weak. It is unnecessary to
point out the evil of such a system. It would
be much better for the community if the pilot
fees were rigidly collected from all alike to the
full amount allowed by law.
In an investigation into the pilot charges
held by a committee from the State Legislature
in 1883 it was brought out from the books of
the Pilot Commissioners that the pilots col
lected for the year 1882 the gross sum of
$198,625, or nearly $10,000 for each of the
twenty pilots. During the same investigation
the system of discrimination practiced t>y the
pilots under the name of rebates was also
shown. Your sub-committee saw no reason to
conclude that the amount of pilotage collected
now was any less than the amount collected
in 1882. There had been no reduction in the
charges and no exemptions from pilotage since
that date. On the contrary, a certain class of
vesselsâ to-w it: coasting vessels under reg
isterâwhich were then able to avoid the pay
ment of pilotage have since been compelled to
pay. Your sub-committee, therefore, was led
to conclude that the amount of pilotage col
lecteU now was as great as in 1882, unlusÂ»the
commerce of this port had greatly declined
or the system of discrimination above referred
to had been greatly extended.
A request for information was sent to
the Pilot Commissioners last December,
and the following reply was received and
read yesterday:
Hugh Craig Esq., Chairman Sub-Committee on
Pilotage, Committee on Commerceâ Sir: To your
note of December 20 we reply. Some 01 the
information desired by the committee on com
merce in reference to pilotage we are unable
to furnish. However, all that could be gath
ered is forwarded you herewith.
The pilot-boats are owned by the pilots.
The Commissioners are expressly forbidden by
law from having any interest in the boats and
are only required "to ascertain that they are
maintained in a seaworthy 'Condition, and are
safe and suitable for the pilot service. Conse
quently the cost of maintenance of these boats
could only be ascertained from the private
accounts of the pilots. â 
No return is made of the nationality of the
ships or vessels from which pilotage is collected
or whether they are enrolled or registered.
There is no ; pilotage â  collected from any
American vessel sailing under an enrollment.
The number of pilots in the service for each
of the past eleven years was twenty. . .
The actual earnings of the pilots for that
period was $329 88 each per month.
The number of : pilot-boats in commission
for the same period was four, viz.: The Lady
Mine, costing $15,500; America, $18,000; Bo
nita, $19,000; Gracie S, $18,000.
There are employed on each boat five sailors,
whose wages are paid from the earnings of the
pilots.
The net and gross earnings of the pilots for
the last eleven years were as follows:

Yours respectfully, At Murphy, Secretary.
; The report continues :
An examination oi this ;.. statement of the
Pilot Commissioners reveals some striking
facts. First there is a remarkable shrinkage in
the amount of pilotage collected since 1882.
Between the amount collected in 1882 and the
amount collected in 1887 there is a difference
of $81,000. This difference is far too great to
account for upon the theory of a shrinkage in
commerce; and since there has been no reduc
tion in pilot fees, it is only reasonable to con
clude that the system of discrimination in the
collection of pilotage had been more widely
! extended. By such methods the pilots sought
; to maintain their monopoly. Alter 1887 the
amount of pilotage collected begins to Increase
and to betray a tendency to ret urn to its former
proportions.
The yearly average of the gross pilotage col
lected for the eleven years given in this state
ment is $145,879. The â  yearly average of the
net pilotage is $79,171, leaving the | enormous
difference of $66,708 for operating expenses
for each year. It does not mitigate this state
ment to say that some of this has been re
turned to vessels. There should be none re
turned. If the pilot charges are so high that
the pilots voluntarily return some of the
money collected, the rates should bo reduced
bylaw. It should not be left to a handful of
men^to levy toll upon vessels! passing the
Golden Gate or to remit that toll at their own
sweet will and for their own profit. This is not
what a pilot system is created for. Further
more, this $66,708 does not include the whole ;
of the subsidy in the form of rebate which the
pilots pay. . "... , .
But taking the. figures of the Pilot Commis
sioners themselves and accepting as true that
there is merely a yearly average of $79,171,
divided among the twenty pilots, the pilots
have " each received, according to the - above
statement, the sum of $329 88 for each month
of the eleven years covered. : After deducting
the enormous reb.ates and discriminations and
extravagant ' allowances for expenses, the
pilots still, according to their own statement,
pocket a clean little â  income of $329 88 â¢ per
month. When it is considered that the highest
wages paid to the | master of a coasting, vessel j
is $125 per month and that there are twenty
pilots to do the work which ten can easily do,
the compensation is seen to be out of : all pro
portion to the services rendered. -â¢ â â¢..-. .'â  â â  â 
In this connection it may be said parentheti
cally that there is a practical ': object lesson of
the overcompensation â¢of {pilots in the fact
that pilots Bell their commissions .at . irom
$3000 ;to i $6000 : apiece. Whenever,- for â¢ any
reason,' a pilot wishes to retire from the ser
vice, he ii able, by the aid of a little | political
diplomacy, to name his own successor, and for
so doing he invariably charges , from ; $3000 to
$6000 by way of compensation. , "'ilVilMllHfr'jl'
'â¢ Whether the whole of the amount remains
in the pocket of the retiring pilot or some of j it
finds its way into the pockets of persons sup
posed to have influence over the appointment
of pilots 5, is "â  not â¢ material ; the fact that the
money is paid shows that the returns from
pilotage a.re considered to be so much in ex
cess of : the v services t rendered ;asâ¢; to give the
position of pilot a market value ; of , a pretty
considerable amount. â  ;:;.;;; >^-
-' As compared with these extravagant: figures
your sub-committee has -made; an estimate of
the amount necessary to maintain, under
rational provisions of "law, a pilot service at
this port adequate for all the necessities of its
commerce. And. first, in this connection,
your sub-committee calls attention to the fact
that, under rational pilot laws, ten pilots are
enough to do all the work of the port. In
former years, when tnere was greater need of
pilots than now, the number was kept at
fifteen, and it was raised to the full limit of
twenty, allowed by law, simply to relieve the
then Pilot Commissioners from the nuisance
of being bothered by applicants for positions.
Ten pilots, selected for efficiency and not of a
superannuated age, can readily do all the
work actually necessary to be done at this
port.
Your sub-committee hoWs that $200 per
month is an exceedingly liberal compensation
for a pilot. The highest wages paid to ship
masters on this coast is $125 per month, and
the duties of a pilot require no greater skill or
intelligence than the duties of the master of a
first-class sailing vessel.
With this standard in view, your sub-cora
mitteu submits the following estimate of the
necessary expense of a pilot service for this
port per year:
3 0 pi: ots at r_'4oo per year $24,000
Cost of maintaining pilot-boats 18,000
Salary of Pilot Commissioners 3,600
Salary of secretary or clerk 1.200
Oilice rent and sundries 600
Total $47,300
Your sub-committee calls attention to the
fact that this estimate is #100,000 less than the
amount given in the statement of the Pilot
Commissioners as the average yearly amount
actually collected, and is more than if 150,000
less than the amount of pilotage collected in
1882. In estimating the compensation of the
Pilot Commissioners and their secretary or
clerk, your sub-committee has kept in mind
that under the provisions of the proposed law
submitted below the Commissioners would re
ceive a large sum from the fees for granting
special pilot licenses.
Your suo-committee believes that any meas
ure to regulate the pilot fees of this port should
take into account the fact that it has become
the custom for vessels passing through the
Golden Gate to do so in tow, and that when in
tow a pilot is altogether superfluous. The
masters of tugboats belonging to this bay are
as good pilots as the regular pilots themselves;
and where a vessel has secured the services of
one it seems to your sub-committee to be an
unnecessary burden to make the tessel pay
for both. In framing the following outline of
the proposed amendments to the State law
governing pilots your sub-committee has kept
this in mind.
It is also to be borne in mind that the com
petent master of a steamer regularly trading
with this port who has, upon examination,
shown himself thoroughly familiar with the
harbor, is much more competent to pilot his
steamer than is any regular pilot with equal
knowledge by reason of the lact that he knows
his own steamer best and can best handle her.
Your sub-committee recommends ' that
amendments to the pilot laws of this State be
drafted which will embody the following
features:
Firstâ For purpose of classification pilots to
be designated as general and special.
Secondâ The number of general pilots to be
reduced to a maximum of ten ; the reduction
to be brought about by the simple process of
not making appointments to till vacancies as
they occur.
Thirdâ The masters of all tugboats regularly
cruising the waterÃ of this bay and the ap
proaches thereto to be examined by the Pilot
Commissioners and licensed as special pilots.
Fourthâ The masters of all steamers and
steam craft regularly trading with this port to
be examined by the Pilot Commissioners and
licensed as special pilots.
Fifthâ The masters of all sailing vessels reg
ularly trading with this port to be examined
by the Pilot Commissioners and licensed as
special pilots.
SixthâAny sailing vessel or other craft in
tow, having as master a licensed special pilot,
to be exempt from all pilot fees, unless a gen
eral pilot be actually employed.
Seventhâ Steam craft under the command of
a master licensed as a pilot to be exempt from
all pilot fees, unless a general pilot be actually
employed.
Eighthâ Any sailing vessel under the com
mand ot a master licensed as special pilot to be
exempt from all pilot fees, unless a general
pilot be actually employed.
Ninthâ Every master examined by the Pilot
Commissioners and granted a special license to
pay a fee of $10.
Tenthâ A special pilot license granted to the
master of any tug, steamer or sailing vessel
shail entitle the holder to act as pilot for the
vessel for which the license is granted only;
masters duly licensed to act as special pilot for
one vessel may, however, have their license
transferred to act for another vessel upon the
payment of a fee of $L
Eleventhâ A provision making it a misde
meanor,with proper penalty, for pilots to make
any discrimination in the" collection of pilot
fees or to pay any rebates except such as are
expressly provided for by law.
Twelfth â A provision requiring the Pilot Com
missioners to make each year to the Governor
of the rita.e a full report of all the pilotage col
lected, with other necessary statistics.
On motion of T. J. Parsons, the sub
committee on pilotage was instructed to
employ a competent person to draft a bill
in accordance with the report for presen
tation to the next Legislature.
Captain Thayer was appointed a com
mittee to prepare resolutions suggesting to
tne Merchants' Exchange that a tide clock,
indicating the hours of high and low tide
in the harbor, be erected on the floor of
the exchange.
The secretary stated that Congressman
Loud had received a promise from the
Committee on Ways and Means that it
would recommend the appropriation of
money for surveys of tne more dangerous
rocks in the bay of San Francisco.
The report of the sub-committee on
finance showed that the total monthly
subscription to date was $2.">2 20. It was
adopted, and George Plummer. treasurer
of the Ship-owners' Association, was
elected treasurer of the committee.
TO REMOVE HOG RANCHES
The Supervisors Will Act on the
Bay View Petition
To-Day.
A Once Charming Dwelling Place Now
Rendered Uninhabitable by
Stench.
The hog pens at Bay View, South San
Francisco, still send fortn their stench into
the windows of the hundred or more resi
dents of that pretty little valley. The foul
refuse is piling up higher on the beach
day by day and increasing the danger of
epidemic disease.
The petition from the property-owners
there to the Board of Supervisors, for the
removal of this nuisance, will be acted
upon to-day by the Supervisors.
The petition contained some forty or
fifty names, headed by Mr. Piper, who
owns considerable land in that district.
The petition was gotten up hurriedly, and
aa a consequence contains about half the
number of names that otherwise would
have been appended to it.
The matter of the removal of these places
has been agitated for some time. Before
the advent of the hog ranches Bay View
was one of the moat charming spots for
residence in San Francisco. The purity of
the air and splendid view of the bay,
which then touched a beach as white is'
that near the (Miff House, made the local
ity particularly favorable for the building
of homes. Since the hog ranches moved
onto the beach the entire valley, the
greater part of the time, is almost unbear
able owing to the terrible stench arising
from the refuse thrown on the beach.
The residents assert in warm weather
they are frequently compelled to leave
their homes to escape the odor. They
claim that down near these ranches sick
ness is continually prevalent, and in their
petition they hold that it is extremely un
fair that four people should render the
homes of a hundred others uninhabitable.

FIRED INTO HIS MOUTH
John H. Peters, the Well-Known
Photographer, Commits
Suicide.
THE ACT WAS DELIBERATE.
His Family Can Assign No Reason
Why He Should Have Taken His
Own Life.
John H. Peters, the well-known pho
tographer, committed suicide yesterday
afternoon by shooting himself in the
mouth in the waiting-room of his photo
graph gallery at 914 Market street.
The gallery occupies the second and
third floors of the building, tne second
floor being used as an office and the third
as the operating and waiting rooms.
At noon Peters went out to lunch and
returned about 1 o'clock. His daughter
and an office-boy were in tne office. "With
out saying anything to them he went up
stairs. A few minutes later the report of
a revolver was heard and the office-boy
ran upstairs. He looked into the waiting
room and immediately ran downstairs
and out into the street, where he met Po
liceman Royston and said, "Come quick;
the boss has shot himself."
Eoyston followed the boy, and when he
entered the waiting-room he saw Peters
seated in an armchair in front of a mirror,
with hifl legs resting upon a settee. A re
volver was clutched in his right hand,
which rested upon his breast. Blood was
oozing out of his month, and he was un
conscious.
The officer rang for the patrol wagon,
and Peters was taken to the Receiving
Hospital. Drs. Bunneil and Rinne made
a hasty examination, and came to thn con
clusion that he could not live many min
utes. He bad fired into his mouth, and
the bullet had penetrated into the brain.
Peters expired about 3 o'clock, and his
body was removed to the Morgue.
An examination of the revolver, which
is a Smith & Wesson 32-caliber, showed
that fie had fired twice, but the first car
tridge had not exploded, and he then fired
again with fatal effect.
Peters was a married man, 62 years of
age, and a native of Germany. He lived
with his wife and four children at 2021
Howard street. The family was at once
notified of the affair and Eggert Peters,
the eldest son, hurried to the hospital.
"My father Jeft home as usual this
morning," he said, "and so far as we know
he was in his usual health. There was
nothing wrong either in his business
affairs, so far as we were aware. He was
doing a good business and his home re
lations had always been of the most pleas
ant kind."
Mrs. Peters also called at the hospital,
but she was in such a hysterical condition
that nothing could be learned from her as
to the cause of her husband's suicide.
Peters left no letters to his family that
would throw any light upon the matter.
It was learned from other sources that
business had been dull with him for some
time back, and for the past two or three
days he had been acting in an erratic
manner.

society, and that society will take charge

WANTS A DIVORCE.
Charles T. Cook Files Â» l\ill Against
His Wife v Emily,^AlUgliigU ;
Infidelity.
Walter H. Linforth, as counsel for
Charles T. Cook, filed a petition in di
vorce yesterday against Emily M. Cook.
Charles T. Cook is in the internal revenue
service, stationed at Port Costa. The
grounds for the divorce, as stated, are re
peated acts of .ntidelity, and the respond
ents named are several*
The couple were married on the 22d of
December, 1888, in this City.
The acts of infidelity charged are al
leged to have been committed on Thurs
day, the 20th of February, and on Satur
day, the 29th of February, "at that cer
tain place known as the 'Poodle Dog,' sit
uate on the corner of Bush street and
Grant avenue," with a man whose first
name is "Will," the second name un
known.
The first name of another respondent
is "Harry," his full name unknown.
With him the actions complained of took
place between the Ist day of March and
the Ist day of July, 1895, at San Jose, at
Livermore and at Mendenhalls Springs.
Tlie defendant is charged Â«vith similar
conduct on various occasions during the
year 1895, with one Percy Smith at Men

SURPRISE PARTY.
Night Raid on His Wife's
Apartments at the
Palace.
â¢
TOOK [AWAY HIS CHILD.
Has Brought Action for Divorce
in the Superior Court From
Mrs. Marceau.
J. H. MALONEY CO-RESPONDENT
â â â â
Review of the Military Union and
the Subsequent Animated Career
of the Marceaus.
The Palace Hotel was the scene of a sen
sational tumult at 2 o'clock this morning.
Loud voices, the slamming of doors and
hasty scampering in the corridors alarmed
the guests on the second floor of the cara
vansary. Instant investigation followed,
when it was discovered that Colonel Theo
dore C. Marceau, a well-known pho
tographer, had made a raid on his wife's
apartments and gained possession of his
b> >y, aged 2 yearsâ Theodore C. Marceau Jr.
The photograper, in his rush to get pos
session of the child, was so positive that he
saw in his wile's apartments one J. H.
Maloney, a horseman and eambler, with
whom his wife's name had been un
pleasantly coupled, that he went as soon
as daylight did appear to consult his coun
sel, Messrs. Patterson ft Rodgers. The
lesult of the consultation was the imme
diate filing of a suit for divorce and for the
custody of the child. The complaint dis
tinctly alleges the infidelity of his wife,
and mentions Maloney as the co-respon
dent.
The story told at the law office of Pater
son & Rodgers, where Marceau passed
most of his time yesterday afternoon, is
interesting, and may be accepted as the
injured husband's version of the marital
troubles.
When Colonel Marceau and Widow
Amanda J. Fiske of Fresno were married
in 1891 at the Sea .Beach Hotel, Santa
Cruz, the colonel's worldly possessions
consisted of available cash, and his bride's
property was chiefly lands and Fresno
city property heavily incumbered by mort
gages. So persistent were the creditors in
efforts to foreclose mortgages and secure
money by attachments that the colonel
had to put up as first payment $14,000.
He has since been paying out. to save his
wife s estate, until the payments now
aggregate $70,000. At various times he
sought for a settlement, and even agreed
to settle on the basis that she should
simply repay the money that he had paid
from his own personal estate. She re
fused to make any settlement, Dut held
fast to etil the property, which is supposed
to be worth $250,000.
About six months ago a serious disagree
ment took place and a separation ensued.
Friends, however, intervened anrt some
kind of a reconciliation was patched up.
The truce was not lastine, and so two
weeks ago the colonel left bis sumptuous
apartments in the Palace Hotel and estab
lished bachelor quarters in the Phelan
building, where he conducts the business
of taking pictures.
The colonel's absence from the domestic
circle in the Palace apartments did not
compel him to renounce all of his obli
gations as a husband, for he continued to
Tay his wife's hotel bills. As a measure
of precaution to avoid the payment of un
necessary extras he scanned the numer
ous items of the accounts and found that
a great quantity of champagne had been
consumed and a large number of cigars
smoked. The colonel, whose intellect was
then unusually clear, and whose per
spicacity was fully aroused, reasoned in
stantly that the consumption of such an
unexpected quantity of wine and cigars
indicated the lavish entertainment of gen
tlemen, and so his suspicions were excited.
About this time Mrs. Marceau's maid
brought him intelligence that his boy,
Theodore, was being neglected. Other
tidings were conveyed by the maid, Sophia
Brown, and her husband. It was reported
that Maloney 's attentions to Mrs. Marceau
were causing whimpers of scandal in the
hoiel. The colonel thereupon resolved to
rescue the child and rind out for himself
the true status of affairs at the Palace. As
cending witn the maid, the maid's husband
and two friends he visited the apartments
on the second floor of the Palace early this
i.iorning. He was admitted by a side en
trance and enabled to get the child. He
was sure that he saw for an instant through
the open door of his wife's apartments that
some one was there with her. Watch was
maintained until 10 o'clock this morning,
â when, according to the version of the
â watchers, Maloney emerged.
MARCEAU'S COMPLAINT.
Grounds Upon Which the Plaintiff
Seeks a Divorce and the Cus
tody of His Child.
Marceau's complaint is brief and
pointed. It is written with a marked ab
sence of superfluous legal verbiage. Alter
reciting that he was married to the de
fendant, Amanda J. Marceau. on July 9,
]-:ti.in Santa Cruz, he declares that on
March 5, 1896, the defendant was guilty
of infidelity, and J. H. Maloney is men
tioned as co-respondent. The complaint
then continues:
VII Plaintiff further alleges that by reason
of her ne gleet of, want of affection for and ex
treme cruelty toward said child and intempcr

person to have the care, control or custody of

VIII That said defendant is possessed of a

except, ornaments, curios, furniture and other
household articles. . . ..
Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment that
the bonds of matrimony existing between him
b. If and the derendant be dissolved, and that
the custody of said minor child be awarded to
the plaintiff.
PALACE HOTEL SCENE.
Mrs. Marceau'B Attorney Says His
Client is Innocentâ The Inva
sion an Outrage.
Mr=. Marceau declared last nij-'ht that
â¢he had absolutely nothing to say. Her
attorneys, she said, were cognizant of the
real state of aft? irs and she would leave
them the duty of relating what had hap
pened at her rooms. One direct state
ment she did maKe and that was:
"Mr. Marceau's charges are all false.
But you see Mr. McPike and he will tell
you everything."
After that Mrs. Marceau was dumb.
McPike had spent the greater part of the
afternoon with his fair client and ex
pressed himself in very strong language
in regard to her troubles.
"Mrs. Marceau is a good woman and has
been true to her husband,' he said. "The
charges made by Mr. Marceau are as in
famous as they are false.
"Mr. Maloney was with Mrs. Marceau
Wednesday evening. His attorney,
Charles Hanlon, and Mrs. Fisher, Mrs.
Marceau's mother, were there, too. They
spent the evening singingand with instru
mental music until shortly after 12 o'clock
when a servant was sent for an oyster
loaf.
"This fellow went to Marceau when he
was downstairs and told him that Maloney
was in Mrs. Mar.ceau's room. Marceau
immediately began to storm. He went to
the clerk and declared that there was a
man in his wife's room and that if the
hotel management did not see that he was
ejected he (Marceau) would break down
the uoor. Of course this occasioned con
siderable excitement. The clerk attempted
to temporize and then sent a messenger to
ask Mrs. Marceau if there was a man in
her room.
"By this time the party had completed
their" lunch. Mr. Marceau's impertinent
interruption came very unexpectedly ana
aroused considerable indignation. Mrs.
Marceau sent back word that not only was
Mr. Maloney in her room, but Mr. Han
lon was also there.
'"The gentlemen did not remain long.
The interruption marred the even tenor of
affairs, and, making their adieus, they left
the apartments. Mr. Maloney went "with
Mr. Hanlon. This both of them will swear
to. Mr. Maloney, Mrs. Marceau and Mrs.
Fisher will swear that Mr. Maloney did
not return to the rooms.
"Mrs. Marceau and the others of her
family retired about 1 o'clock. About 3
o'clock in the morning there was a noise at
the door. Mrs. Marceau awoke and heard
her maid cry out:
14 Oli, Mrs. Marceau, come here, quick.'
"Frightened at the woman's tone, Mrs.
Marceau ran to the door, asking:
"What is it? Who is there?'
" 'It's Mr. Marceau, and he wants to get
in!' was the answer.
" 'My God, what can he want at this
hour of the morning?' gasped Mrs. Mar
ceau.
'â¢For an answer there dame a violent
shaking of the door and a demand for ad
mission, accompanied by threats to force
a passage. This frightened Mrs. Marceau
very much, as her husband has repeatedly
said he would kill her, and she thought he
waÂ« about to execute nis fell designs.
"Naturally" she did not open the door.
Then there was the noise of tbe giving of
locks, and, overcome with terror, Mrs. Mar
ceau knew nothing more till she found
herself aione with her mother and her lit
tle boy.
"It was an outrage, sir, an abominable
outrage," declared Mr. McPike, earnestly.
"Maloney nor any other man was in Mrs.
Marceau's rooms. She was alone and no
one but a perjurer will say she was not."
"What will Mrs. Marceau's answer be?"
was asked.
"I don't know yet, I have not read Mr.
Marceau's complaint."
"It has the one charge of infidelity."
"That will be denied in whole."
"Will tnere be any counter charges?"
"That I cannot say now. I will tell you,
though, that Mr. Marceau will never get
the divorce from her.
"Mrs. Marceau is not a guilty woman,"
Mr. McFike added impressively. "She
may be a Mttle too voluble at times, but
she has done nothing wrong. She was in
discreet in keeping the servants she has
about her. I tola her so a month ago.
She declared tnat she had nothing to fear
from what they might say. Now, how
ever, it looks as if there might be danger
that they will be employed to swear to
lies. There can be no doubt but they are
false to her. Still, you may rest assured
that the only way Mr. Marceau can sub
stantiate his charges will be by perjury. 1 '
The utory of Maloney's acquaintance
with Mr. Marceau's pretty wife is a pe
culiar one. It was brought about through
a suit brought by Marceau about a
year ago to force the young horseman to
pay for some photographs.
It seems that Maloney was about to go
East, when Marceau had him held on a
charge of attempting to leave the State to
defraud his creditors. In order to get a
warrant Mr. Marceau had to give a bond
for twice the amount involved and Mrs.
Marceau went on her husband's bond.
The sum for which she was responsible
was some $3000.
The affair was arranged at the time, and
Malonev continued his interrupted jour
ney. He returned a few months since,
and was very wrathy about his detention.
He wanted to get even with the pho
tographer, and went to Attorney Charles
Hanlon and instructed Hanlon to arrest
and bring suit against Marceau and his
two bondsmen for having maliciously oc
casioned his (Malomy's) arrest and de
tention.
"I heard Maloney and Hanlon discuss
ing the matter one day," said Mr. McPike,
in speaking of the affair. "I at once pro
tested against their submitting Mrs. Mar
ceau to the humiliation and annoyance of
a suit. We talked it over, and I assured
them that Mrs. Marceau was an innocent
party to the suit, and Mr. Maloney agreed
that if he could be sure of that he would
not press the matter.
"I s:i\v Mrs. Marceau the next day,"
Mr. McPike continued. "I advised her
that it would be well for her to see Mr.
Maloney about the matter, and she did so.
The suit was stopped, and Mr. Maloney
afterward made several calls upon her, 1
understand. The last of these was on
Wednesday night, when he went to her
rooms to call upon Mrs. Marceau and her
mother, in company with Mr. lianlon."
MRS. MARCEAU'S WILL.
It Grieved the Colonel Because His
Name Was Omitted From
the Testament.
Colonel and Mra. T. C. Marceau have
been living apart from each other for the
past two months, and their society friends
have wondered whether they vrould ever
kiss and make up, or whether, in the near
future, a divorce suit of Marceau vs. Mar
ceau would adorn the calendar of the
Superior Court.
The wife occupied her luxuriously fur
nished suite of rooms in the Palace Hotel ;
the husband extemporized a boudoir of
almost oriental magnificence in one of the
rooms connected v:ith his photograph gal
lery several blocks away.
She has her meals served in her rooms
and is attended by her own French maid
and a colored girl. He has no French at
tendant, but his apartments are looked
after by a gentleman domestic whose native
place is separated fmm France by the
British Channel and the Irish Sea. In the
case of meals the mountain does not go to
Mahomet, and so the colonel dines, a la
grass widower, in the high-priced res
taurants uptown.
As a matter of fairness it must be said
that the colonel did keep his wife ever in
his memory. He continued paying her
bills just the same as he used to pay them
when he was basking in the sunshine of
her society, for she is a sunny creature
and well knows how to enjoy the good
tilings of life. Every month he put up
for the rent of her suite in the l'alace
Hotel, and about as milch more for her
board and that of her servants. Then she
went out riding almost every day and the
colonel paid the bills.
When she had company of an evening,
say a lady and gentleman friend, she
pressed a button in the wall and ordered
champagne, oysters and icecream brought
up, for hospitality is one of her most
shining graces. The colonel was not pres
ent to partake of these delicacies, but he
had the melancholy pleasure of paying for
them after they have been digested.
He made no murmur of complaint or

dissatisfaction, for that is the style in
which they have always lived. As her
husband, he is responsible for her living
expenses, even though he may not have ft \
share in incurring them. Her own separ- j
ate income, about $1200 per month, would
be aufticient to keep the wolf from the
door even should the colonel become an
anchorite and betake himself to some
lonely isle in the tropic seas, but as the
colonel is not an anchorite she is not
obliged to spend very much out of the in
come of her separate estate.
Hence she was in no hurry to institute a
suit for divorce. She said that she had
good grounds for divorce, but did not in
tend bringing an action.
The big obstacle which stood in the way
of an amicable divorce, however, is said to
be an indebtedness of between $26,000 and
$28,000, which the colonel insists she owes
him. This is said to be a balance due on
$'X), 000 alleged to have been advanced to
her by the colonel at the time of their
marriage, or shortly thereafter, for the
])urpose of clearing off mortgages on Mrs.
Marceau's property at Fresno.
Mrs. Marceau advanced as an offset the
claim that whatever money was expended
by her during their trip through Europe
some years ago should be repaid her by
the colonel, as he, being her husband, was
responsible for those expenses. This, with
some other offsets, it is alleged, would
wipe oat the balance claimed by the colonel
as being due to him.
For two months four lawyersâ two on
each sideâ have been trying to settle the
matter of property satisfactorily to Doth
parties, but they have not yet succeeded in
hreaking the deadlock. Some of the
colonel's friends say that he has been
shadowed by private detectives who would
be glad to catch him tripping lightly over
his marriage vows, in which contingency,
they add, the dispute nbout property ar
rangements would be settled very speedily.
But thus far they say the detectives
have had plenty of walking exercise and a
steady job, the colonel having conducted
himself as from time immemorial in a
manner befitting the head of a family.
Although it is only two months since
husband and wife have ceased to dwell
under the same roof they have not lived
together in all respects aa man and wife
since last September. In that month, it ia
alleged by her, be got drunk and beat and
kicked her, causing black and blue marks
to appear upon her arms and hip. These
marks she exhibited at the time to more
than one person, whose statements are
stowed away in a safe place to be produced
in the event of a suit to dissolve the bonds
of matrimony.
Her story is to the effect that when trav
eling in the East with Colonel Marceau
they stopped for a while in Cincinnati,
where the colonel has an aristocratic pho
tograph gallery. There he went on a glori
ous spree, and being very disagreeable in
his cups treated her so cruelly that she
took her children and came to San Fran
cisco without kissing him good-by. He
was very angry when he sobered up and
found that his wife had gone to California,
and when he arrived here he was in no
amiable mood.
But the thing which annoyed him most,
and which he said almost, broke his heart,
was the discovery of his wife's last will
and testament. One day while in their
apartments in the Palace he saw the end
of a sheet of legal cap sticking out of a bu
reau drawer. The paper was loose ana not
inclosed in an envelope or other wrapper,
and he glanced at it through curiosity.
He found that it was his wife's will. In
it she had provided for her two children,
one of whom was by her deceased hus
band, John D. Fiske, and the other was
Colonel Marceau's. The will was terse and
well drawn, Mrs. Marceau being a gradu
ate of Vassar College, but what was his
astonisnment and chagrin when he saw
that he was not even mentioned.
'â¢There was not even a solitary admis
sion that she had a husband at all," said
Colonel Marceau to a friend. "She aid
not leave me $1 or her love and affectionâ
just passed me by as if I never existed.
That was one of the roughest deals I ever
got from her. It almost broke my heart."
In trnth the colonel seemed to be more
cut up by this mark of a lack of affection
than ne had ever been before, even when
he thumped the drunken capitalist in
Santa Cruz on the night before his wed
ding, or when he had a row in Peters
burg with a handsome Russian Count.
It is believed also that only for the dis
covery of the will an amicable arrange
ment would have been mads before this of
the property dispute, and that if Mrs.
Marceau had insisted upon a separation
no obstacle would have been thrown in
the way.
Shortly after the military wedding the
colonel and his bride made an extended
tour of Europe, going as far as Peters
burg, and indulging in the festiv
ities of the aristocracy of that gay
capital. While there thocolonel made the
acquaintance of a dashing Russian fount,
well provided with both money and good
looks. The Count accompanied the
newly wedded coupie as far as Monaco,
from which resort came a report to the
London newspapers to the effect that the
wealthy American, Lieutenant - Colonel
Marceau, of the staff of his Excellency the
Governor of California, U. S. A., had gone
on a spree and had punched the head of
the wealthy nobleman from the frozen
Jand of the Czar.
There waa more scandal of the pugilistic
kind after the couple returned to this City.
On one occasion, while under the influ
ence of new champagne, the colonel ran
a muck in his apartments in the Palace
Hotel and literally "knocked the stuffing"
out of the plush upholstered furniture. It
appears that he was angry with his wife at
that time.
On another occasion he created a scene
in front of the Villa, near Golden Gate
Park, in the afternoon. He found his
wife's phaeton in front of the house, and
on making an investigation be became dis
pleased and very loudly, too, because his
wife was partaking of refreshments with a
friend.
Tne last time the colonel's name ap
peared in the newspapers was during the
Christmas holidays last year when a Christ
mas tree in his apartments in the Palace
Hotel caught fire from the lighted tapers
liung upon its branches. The tree was
thrown out of the window and the Fire De
partment was called out.
FAVOR MRS. MARCEAU.
Hotel Employes Declare That There
Was No Man in That Lady's
Rooms.
J. McDermott, the clerk at the Palace
Hotel, declares that Mr. Marceau did not
find Mr. Maloney or any other man in
Mrs. Marceau's rooms.
' The first I knew that there wa3 any
trouble was about 3:15 o'clock yesterday
morning," said Mr. McDermott. "Then
Mr. Marceau went out with Brown, the
servant, Mrs. Brown and the baby. He
stopped in the ollice and said there was a
man in his wife's room and he wanted him
taken out. He was Hushed and much ex
cited.
"I at once called the watchman and
Mr. Marceau repeated his statement. 1
sent the watchman at once to Mrs. Mar
ceau's rooms and he found no one there.
He is an experienced man, and if there
had been any one in the room he would
have known it. Mr. Marceau came back
later and I told him there had been no
one in the room."
Mr. Sawyer, the watchman, said he saw
Mr. and Mrs. Brown get into a carriage
with the Marceau baby. Knowing they
tvere in Mrs. Marceau's employ, he
thought it was all right. It was not till
he got into the office that he learned that
Mr. Marceau was in possession of the
cnild.
"Mr. Marceau told me that there was a
man in his wife's room and he wanted him
removed," Mr. Sawyer said. "I went
to â¢ the rooms at once. Mrs. Mar
ceau's mother told me that Mr. Marceau
had stolen away the baby and begged me
to stay about the rooms and see that no
one did them harm. I stayed about the
room all night. lam confident that there
was no one there."
Manager Kirkpatrick said he thought
Mr. Marceaa had made a big mistake.
"It is evident that he acted on the ad
vice of the servant." said Mr. Kirkpatrick.
"It is as evident that the servant made a
false report to gain the good graces of the
man who was paying him to play false to
his mistress. It is hardly probable," added
Mr. Kirkpatrick, "that Mrs. Marceau
would be so foolish as to receive a man in
the rooms with her mother, even if she
were inclined to be bad."
MALONEY LACONIC.
The Co-Respondent Makes a Brief
but Emphatic Denial of Mr. Mar
ceau's Charges.
John H. Maloney, the co-respondent,
had very little to say last night. That
little was to the point, however.
"The whole statement made by Mr.
Marceau is false and absurd," he declared.
"I have plenty to say, but I do not intend
to say it now. When the time comes I
will speaK more freely."
Mr. Maloney explained that he did not
wish to be discourteous. He was acting
on the advice of his attorney, Mr. Hanlon,
and he must, therefore, be excused from
speaking further. He intimated that he
could refute the statements concerning
himself, but refused positively to discuss
them.
A SENSATIONAL CAREER.
Chapter of Fresno HistoryâMar
ceau Military Weddlngr at Santa
Cruzâ Scenes In Europe.
During her career in Fresno as the wife
of J. D. Fiske, and since the traeic death
of her first husband and her sub
sequent marriage to Colonel Marceau,
the defendant in the divorce case has fur
nished the newspapers with a variety of
items.
She is a native of New Jersey and was
not more than sixteen years old when she
married Fiske. The story was told at the
time of the wedding that Fiske made love
to the mother, carefully concealing the
fact that the true object of his affection
was the daughter of "sweet 16." The
mother had property, and to allay sus
picion that he was seeking by marriage to
obtain her worldly goods Fiske advised her
to deed all of her property to her daughter.
The deeds were so executed by the credu
lous widow, and then Fiske married the
daughter and hied to Fresno.
Surely, Fiske did cut a wide swath in
Fresno and supplied the daily press of
that city with material for many sensa
tional articles. He owned the Fiske Opera
house and conducted what was known as
thÂ« "Water Tank Theatrical Circuit." He
engaged Eastern combinations of talent
to produce great dramatic attractions at
water-tank stations, and when the advance
agent came along and saw that the station
could not turn out an audience of more
than twenty people the engagement was
canceled. Fiske promptly claimed the
forfeiture of $100 for violation of contract
and was often successful in collecting
judgment.
Fiske and bis wife bad trouble iv Fresno. (
Once on a time Fiske, armed with a club,
Mrs. Fiske with a horsewhip and a negro
with the gun went to a newspaper oitice
and laid out the editor. Fiske used his club
with such effect that the gun and horse
whip were not brought into action. Fiske
had trouble with Barton, a Fresno capi
talist, and sought to compel him to pay a
large sum of money.
In this trouble Mrs. Fiske's name waa
unpleasantly involved. While the dis
pute wus pending and creating a great sen
sation in Fresno society, Fiske was shot
and killed on the street by Joseph D. Still
inan. The slayer was sentenced to a life
term in the penitentiary, and is still alive
and in prison.
On the death of her husband Mrs. Fiske
collected life insurance policies of a large
amount in the aggregate. She also came
into possession of a vast deal of incum
bered real estate. She soon had money
enough to gratify her luxurious tastes, and
by a generous use of her wealth attracted
the attention ol society and suitors.
Theodore Marceau, handsome, prosperous
also in a pecuniary sense, and holding the
exalted military rank; of lieutenant-colonel
on the staff of the Governor of the most
prosperous State in the Union, presented
advantages of a prospective husband that
a woman of forethought could not resist.
Marceau, thus equipped, entered the field
and won the greatest triumph ever
achieved by the National (iuard of Cali
fornia. The engagement was brief and
the wedding gorgeous.
The "nuptials were celebrated, 1 ' as soci
ety editors would say, at the rica Beach
Hotel, Santa Cruz, where John T. Sullivan,
the landlord, was at the zenith of his glow
ing career as a manager. Auspiciously it
happened that all of the troops of the
guard were encamped at Santa Cruz at that
time, so the display of gold lace, shoulder
straps, plumes and all the glittering para
phernalia of militia on a peuce footing was
indeed picturesque and astounding.
The wedding was Hashed up with the
most alluring headlines, and "among
those present" were many who had pri
vately telegraphed to San Francisco man
aging editors to have their names omitted.
The cause for this requested suppression
may now be stated. It appears that an
inebriated individual, whose name was
given to the world as "Hanscombe," made
himself conspicuous at the hotel by de
manding admission to the apartments
of the prospective bride. He would not
take her "no" for an answer. So Lieuten
ant-Colonel Marceau was advised of the
invasion and proceeded to repel the in
vader.
In doing so he blackened the eyes of
Hanscombe and then tumbled him down
stairs. This impediment being removed,
the marriage proceeded without further
obstacle. Some of the society ladies of
San Francisco who were willing to be re
ported as attending the wedding did not
want their names published as attending
the fight, so the wires were hot with pri
vate telegrams to the managing powers of
the press in this town.

JOHN F. FINERTY DINED
The Irish Nationalist and Orator
Entertained by His Com
patriots.
He Makes a Brilliant Plea for the
Union of the Race in the
Cause of Freedom.
The Hon. John F. Finerty of Chicago
was given a reception and banquet by the
Knights of the Red Branch at the hall of
the society on Mason and O'Farrell streets
last night.
Fully 500 Irish-American citizens were
present to testify their appreciation and
respect for the distinguished Nationalist
as well as their loyalty to the cause of
Irish independence.
Banquet-tables were extended about the
hall, which was appropriately decorated
with American and Irish National colors,
while a "Welcome to Finerty" in gilded
letters hung from the ceiling. The scene
was one of great animation.
Dr. P. J. O'Neill presided and on his
right was the gnest of honor.
Among those present were J. J. O'Brien,
Judee Cooney, Colonel O'Byrne, Super
visors Dimond tnd King, FranK T. Shea
and Captain Sheehy.
The toast to Colonel Finerty was drunk
with enthusiasm, and when tne orator
rose to speak he was cheered repeatedly.
He made an eloquent plea for the unity of
the Irish race in the cause of national in
dependence for the old land. He did not
believe that legislative methods would
ever accomplish the desired end for the
fatherland. That could only be secured
by resorting to physical force. This senti
ment was loudly applauded by the gather
ing.
Colonel Finerty went on to say that an
effort should be made to unite the Prot
estants and Catholics of Ireland in a com
mon cause for the absolute release of the
island from British control.
There were other speeches in a similar
strain, and the feathering adjourned at
midnight after singing "God Save Ire
land."
BLOOMER SMUGGLERS.
Arrival of the Bloomer Girls Who Were
Convicted in the Hawaiian
Courts.
Mrs. G. Rodriguez and Miss Annie Gon
zalves were the most interesting passengers
on the steamer Australia that arrived from
Honolulu last Wednesday night. They
were arrested in the island republic on a
charge of smuggling and were found guilty
of landing thirty-three tins of opium,
were sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and to
serve a month of hard labor "on tlie reef.' 1
Their companions in trouble were S. Mer
sich, the second messboy in the officers'
quarters, and a man named I. Bonni
antia, who lived in Honolulu. All re
ceived the same sentence, but Charles
Creighton, the attorney, took up their case
and carried it to the Supreme Court, secur
ing an acquittal.
Mr. Creighton was Attorney-General of
Hawaii under King Kalakaua and was a
long time an exile in San Francisco.
When pardoned he returned to Honolulu
and went into partnership with Paul Neu
mann. He has now resumed practice and
is doing well. His mother and sister
make their home in San Francisco.
Mrs. Rodriguez and Miss Gonzalves are
from Halfmoon Bay. The young lady was
said to be sick, and the trip to "The Para
dise of the Pacific" was taken on her ac
count. When they reached their destina
tion they walked ashore without question,
but some informer went to customs au
thorities, and officers were soon on their
trail. They were located at the home of
Bonniantia, and under his bed were
found two pairs of bloomers with
thirty-three pockets, in each of which was a
five-tael can of the best Hongkong opium.
The drug here is worth about $15 a pound,
while in Honolulu it readily brings about
$40, so that the smugglers would have net
ted $662 50 if their scheme had carried.
The defense made in the Supreme
Court by Messrs. Creighton and Neumann
was that there was not a tittle of evidence
to connect the prisoners with the bloomers
and the opium. The Judge took that view
of the matter and dismissed the case. The
women and Bonniantia lost no time in
taking passage for San Francisco on the
Australia, while Mersich is coming on
the barkentine S. C. Allen. Mrs. Rodri
guez and Miss Gonzalves will return to
Halfmoon Bay, where they will rest and re
cuperate after their adventures in Hawaii.
Both of them almost went into hysterics
on the wharf yesterday when questioned
about the bloomer episode.

EXPRESSED FAITH
IN THE PASTOR.
Some Insight Into the Feel
ings of the Church
Council.
DR. BROWN TESTIFIES.
Lays Great Stress on His Early
Home Life and Christian
Training.
SAYS MRS. STOCKTON KISSED HIM
Touches But Lightly on the Overman
Part of the Scandalâ New Wit
nesses to Testify.
RESOLVED, That it U the opinion of
this council that Dr. Brown haÂ» never
made appointments to meet ladies in the
church for Improper purposes, and that
ho ne?er walked the street* with any
lady, and that he was never seen to in
dulge in familiarities with any lady.
Such, in brief, is the startlingâ not to
cay the unexpected resolution introduced
by Delegate E. C. Williams last night and
passed unanimously by the council.
It was all done so quickly that few of
the members of that deliberate body and
ecarceiy any of the audience fully appre
ciated its full meaning and scope.
Mr. Nagle insisted on introducing testi
mony showing that Dr. Brown was never
Been in conversation with any other lady
than his wife. This was kept up for quite
a while, and when the attorney was about
to introduce additional similar testimony
Mr. Williams sprang to hid feet and ut
tered the words above quoted. Mr. Nagle
insisted that if such was the feeling of the
council it be expressed in some defi
nite way. Moderator McLean agreeing
with him. Then followed the adoption of
the resolution by the council, and the im
mediate retirement of that body into secret
session.
Dr. Brown was in the assembly room
when the council was called to order by
Moderator McLean at 2 o'clock. The pas
tor opened the exercises by a brief and
scathing attack on the press. He said
they had been utterly unfair to him, that
they had suppressed the facts favorable to
him, and had placed the worst construc
tion on everything that had appeared
against him. He cited some instances
wi.ere he had not been treated fairiy, one
being that he had never made use of the
expression, "I'm gone, anyway."
In spite of the announcement made that
Dr. Brown v^as ill and threatened with
paralysis, he never appeared to better ad
vantage or in better voice than when he
took the witness-chair. True, he was sev
eral times prompted by his legal friend,
Mi. Nagle, but in every other respect his
memory seemed faultless, and lie delved
into details of minor facts relating to the
rase with an acuteness which seemed to
deny any assumption that he was nearing
a mental collapse.
Dr. Pond occupied his usual seat just In
the rear of the witness-chair. He ap
peared tired and sleepy, but he woke up
once to ask Mr. Nagle if he meant the
church study when that gentleman asked
the pastor concerning some supposed visit
of Mrs. Stockton. Once or twice during
the afternoon he played the good Samari
tan by handing over to Dr. Brown, when
that gentleman seemed about to give way
to a fit of coughine, a few bronchial
troches. Valley Brown was not present,
nor was Miss Overman, the latter not hav
ing fully recovered from the terrible cross
examination administered by Mr. Tenney
at Wednesday's session of the council.
Dr. Brown in his statement to the coun
cil admitted a good many things which
some expected him to deny. He assured
his ecclesiastical judgss that he had never
kissed Mrs. Stockton nor, in fact, shown
any other than a friendly interest in her,
though he confessed that the winsome
widow had on one occasion made him the
victim of her osculatory ambition. He
admitted, also, that he had gone to Castro
Heights in company with Mrs. Stockton,
though his meeting with this lady was the
result of an accident, not of his own
making.
The pastor began his statement by eoing
back to the day of his birth. By slow
Btages he traveled over his childhood's
days, relating as he went that his father
was a blacksmith, and that he himself had
learned the trade at the age of 13 years. At
the age of 14 he enlisted in the war, but
was down on the payroll as a servant for
his father. Twelve months later he joined
the recular service as a bugler, continuing
in the field until May. 1865.
"In 1866," said the doctor, "I married
the good lady on my right. I want to say
right here that never at any time during
my college career was there the slightest
thing against my character. I was forced
to leave college because there was a rule
to the effect that all students marrying
should â withdraw."
Then in rapid succession the. doctor told
of his admission into the ministry, and of
his seve ral pastorates down to the period
of his connection with the First Congre
gational Church. Incidentally he re
marked that he had met Miss Overman
six months after reaching Tacoma, but
that he never saw her except in the pres
ence of his wife, he took a keen interest
in her because his wife knew her history.
He met Mrs. Stockton through a cordial
recommendation and introduction by Mrs.
Cooper. One morning after service this
young woman came up the aisle and
shook hands with Mrs. Cooper, saying to
him later on that she intended to join the
church.
Concerning the baptizing incident, the
doctor said that at the close of the evening
service he went to the study for his hat
and coat, .lust as be was turning to go
out lie saw Mrs. Stockton standing in the
door. She said that she had never been
baptized, whereupon he had called Deacon
Vasconcellos and performed the ceremony
in his presence.
Dr. Brown then told of the visit to Mrs.
Stockton before that lady's admission to
the church, and of the kissing episode
which followed. When he entered the
room he found the lady lying across the
bed. fully dressed, but with a light cover
ing thrown over her firm. After talking
with her a while he rose to go, whan the
widow threw her arras about his neck and
kissed him. This was his tirst experience
and caused him great alarm.
When however, Mrs. Stockton came to
him on the following Sunday anil begged
forgiveness for her unusual act be thought
it his Christian duty to let the dead past
bury its dead. He attributed her singular
conduct on that occasion to fever, though
he acknowledged that he bad some fear of
scandal, and for that reason had not
spoken of it. He could see now, however,
that it would been better had he
done so.
Coming down to the Turkish tea inci
dent the doctor denied that he ever had
any improper relations with Mrs. Stockton
or had met her on the street corners or
corridors os she had stated. He told of a
few occasions that he had met her, but
they were all accidental. He said that
never at any ime had he kissed her or
attempted to caress her and that her story
was false in detail and in fact.
The witness said that he regretted the
little interchange of harsh words between
him and Mrs. French. The story told by
that lady concerning the Turkish tea was
practically correct, except as to fcis intense
indignation.
The pastor then explained a remark
made some nights before when he stated
tiiat he had no sooner left Mrs. French's
door than he became aware that iMrs.
Stockton was a dangerous woman.
"We had gotten some little way down
the street," said the doctor, "when Mrs.
Stockton turned to me and asked what I
was going to do about it. 1 did not under
stand her and asked if she was crazy. She
repiied, 'You will hear from this again.'
Mrs. Stockton was in a perfect rage, and I
contend that she did then and there men
ace me."
Dr. Brown then told how Mrs. Stockton
had come to him for a letter of recommen
dation, wnich he had refused to give. On
that occasion she grew quite angry, and
repeated her former utterance that he
would hear from her.
Dr. Brown then touched lightly upon
his relations with Miss Overman. He told
how Mrs. Brown had arranged that she
should come to his home to do some sew
ing. He saw, however, that Mattie was in
ill health and he asked her to stay. Miss
Overman retrained in his home until De
cember 10, 18f>4, when she returned to
Tacoma, accompanied by the pastor. The
young lady had announced her intention
of returning home about that time, and
some days later Dr. Brown mentioned at
the breakfast table, so he said, that he had
engagements in Tacoma and Portland
which would necessitate his leaving San
Francisco about the same date.
Dr. Brown will be placed on ihe witness
stand again to-day, and he is expected to
tell what he knows of the Overman-Tun
nell letters.
The three new witnesses of Mrs. Cooper
have appeared before the committee on
charges. Mrs. Barton is among the num
ber, and her testimony promises to be of a
sensational order. She is expected to cor
roborate all that Mrs. Thuraton has said,
and in addition to this give a good many
details of Mrs. Tunnell's visit to Tacoma,
about which there seems to be so much
mystery. Her story has already been pub
lished in The Calb^.
James F. Pierce will also appear. His
testimony is mainly in the direction of
proving the existence of Mrs. Baddin.
John Bickford is the last of the new
witnesses. If what he has told the com
mittee on charges be true his testimony
will be valuable in throwing light on the
Overman-Tunnell letters. He is expected
to tell how they came into prominence,
and that he, on one occasion, saw Mrs.
Tunnell leave a larcre bundle of letters
at the home of Mrs. Buckland, 27)4 La
fayette street. This lady, however, stated
last night that bhe had never met Mrs.
Tunnell but once, and then at a restaurant
on Mission street. She was introduced to
ihe missing witness by Mr. Bickford. Mrs.
Buckland declares with great emphasis
that Mrs. Tunnell did not leave any letters
at her house, at least not to her knowledge.
The council will meet this morning at
9:30 o'clock, and Dr. Brown is expected to
resume the witness-stand. An adjourn
ment will then be taken out of respect to
Deacon Frank until 7 o'clock.
DR. BROWN'S STORY.
In Many Respects In Line With That
Told by Miss Over
man.
There was sunshine In the air when the
council came upon the platform at 2:15
o'clock. Immediately afterward Mrs.
Brown and Miss Ruby Rogers entered the
room by the west door, and a few mo
ments later Dr. Brown came in by the
east door and shook hands with half a
dozen persons while on his way to his seat.
After the usual preliminaries of opening
the council, Dr. Brown addressed the
council on a question of privilege. He
complained that with one exception the
newspapers had not treated him justly.
"I say it in all kindness," he added,
"but the newsDaper reports, with the sin
gle exception of The Call, have been un
fair."
Dr. Brown called attention to the omis
sion in the Examiner and Chronicle of the
questions which he had announced he
would have asked Mrs. Stockton had she
been on the stand for cross-examination.
These two papers containei only a bare
reference to the subject-matter of his re
marks on that occasion, while The Call
contained a tolerably accurate but brief
account. He wished to say also that the
testimony of Mr. Seymour had been slight
ingly treated, if treated at all. The doctor
continued :
That incident at the corner of Sixth and
Brvant streets was absolutely new and it was
never reported. Nor was it reported that on
Monday following the publication of the lodg
ing-house rumor 1 asked Mr. Seymour to go
with me to the lodging-houses on all the cor
ners there. I said, "I will spend a day with
you, sir, and will go with you into the pres
ence of every lodging-house' keeper on Sixth
street." I said also to newspaper men that
they could select two newspaper men to go
with mÂ« to every lodging-house on Sixth
street. These facts have been suppressed in
the newspapers. I cannot understand why
facts which are so material to my vindication
have not been published. lam told thai this
good man (referring to his friend, W. C. Pond)
made a speech in my favor last night and no
report was made of it. If it was against me
every syllable would be in the papers.
Moderator McLean remariced that the
press owed a debt to every man and
woman In the community to give as fair a
presentation of facts as they could in any
caw like the present. He had been in
formed by some of the representatives of
the press that the men who write the re
ports have no control of the matter which
they write after it reaches the hands of
the city editor. He suggested that it
would be in order to move that a request
be made to the newspapers to give a fair
report of both sides of the case.
Mr. Pond made the motion and it was
adopted unanimously. Dr. Brown added:
I want to say that I have it from authentic
sources that a discussion was held at the close
of the council of Friday evening of last week
between the representatives of two of the lead
ing dailies, and it was determined either In
this room or in the vestibule that the matter of
my remaiks regarding Mrs. Stockton should be
suppressed by them. It has been reported
here, and it rc'sched the ears of my dear, aged
father in Cleveland that when I severely criti
cized the council at one of its meetings I
lurried to my wife and said, ''We're gone, any
how." That rumor was false and has done me
very great damage.
The moderator expressed (he hone that
Dr. Brown's remarks would be given as
fully as the reporters could induce their
superiors in the editorial rooms to allow.
Lawyer Nagle then formally moved that
the testimony of Mrs. Cooper should be
stricken from tLÂ» minutes as being hear
say.
l)r. Brown called the attention of the
council to the te.timonyof Mrs. Eaton as
being not only second-hand but lUird-kaud.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1806,
DR. BROWN AS A WITNESS â FROM SKETCHES MADE IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER BY A "CALL" ARTIST.
"Her testimony is," continued the doctor,
"that Dr. Brown and Miss Overman said
to Mrs. Tnnnell 'lf you cannot stand by
us you had better go out,' and Mrs. Tun
nell told it to Mrs. Baton and Mrs. Eaton
told it to the council."
The moderator remarked that "for some
reason beyond the ken of the council the
presence of Mrs. Tunnell could not be se
cured. She was a witness of the utmost
importance, nnd any statements made by
her to a tnuhful woman like Mrs. Eaton,
whose evidence had not heen impeached,
was of weight and importance in the
present investigation."
Dr. Brown then took the stand and pro
ceeded to tell the story of his life from his
childhood up. In September, 1861, at the
age of l.'Vi years, he went to the war as
servant to his father, who was second lieu
tenrnt of Company C, Third Ohio Cavalry.
During ihe first year of the war he took
care of his father's horses and learned to
play the bugle. At the end of a year he
went to Oberlin, Ohio, where he studied
until December, iS'iS, when he re-enlisted
in the same company and regiment as a
bugler. There he remained until after the
close of the war and was discharged in
August, 18G5. On July 25, 1806, he was
married to his present wife and was de
barred from pursuing lÂ»ia college studies
by reason of a rule prohibiting the further
attendance of students who sot married.
The witness made a lengthy explanation
of the anonymous letter " incident at
Rochester, in" which he had mistakenly
charged Dr. Spencer with having been the
author of the scurrilous letters. After he
discovered his error he made ample
amends and publicly apologized. He,
however, by the aid of experts in hand
writing very soon afterward ascertained
the identity of the real culprit.
Six months after he began his pastorate
in Tacoma and about a year before he
came to San Francisco he found Miss
Matiie Overman at his table at dinner one
Sunday and Mrs. Brown introduced him
to her. Miss Overman was not a member
of his churcn and she did not afterward
become a member. She sewed in his
family threetimes. He believed that Miss
Overman was introduced to his wife by the
wife of an ex-judge in Tacoma.
The witness saw nothing of her except
in the presence of his wife. After his
acquaintance began with her he used to
see her in cliurch, but not often. She was
supplying the needs of her family with
the lareer part of her earning and was
studying in a Cliautauqiia course ne be
lieved. That attracted his attention to
her particularly and he remarked to his
wife that Miss Overman was working
beyond her strength.
In June, 1892, Dr. Brown was called to
his present pastorate, and he was intro
duced to Mrs. Stockton either in the last
week of August or the first week of Sep
tember, 1893. She left the church the first
week in May, 1894.
The introduction was by Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper. "It was at the closs of the morn
ing service," continued Dr. Brown; "I
stood by Mrs. Cooper's side and this young
woman came directly up the central aisle
and shook hands with Mrs. Cooper. Mrs.
Cooper said, 'I want to introduce to you
Mrs. Stockton, formerly one of my kinder
garten teachers. 1 Mrs. Stockton said,
'Yes, I am very glad to meet Dr. Brown,
because I am coming into his church.' "
Dr. Brown went on to say that Mrs. S.
E. Dutton, teacher of the infant class,
wanted to take a vacation, and he sug
gested to Mr. Ray that Mrs. Stockton, who
was used to little children, would be just
the person to take charge of her class
during her absence.
"It came into my mind when I was in
troduced to her. and 1 kept it up after
ward that I would rind out aer character,"
added the witness. "I told Mr. Ray that
I would write to her former pastor at Port
Angeles, Rev. C. E. Chase. He was then
in Sonoma County, and from that place
hia reply was received. I did not know
that he had one of her children with him
at that time. The first Sunday in the fol
lowing November she came into the
church with a number of others. I asked
those who were to be baptized to step for
ward, Mrs. Stockton did not step for
ward, but. she entered into covenant with
the church. I assumed that she probably
had been baptized in her infancy.
"At the close of the evening service,
after I had pone into my office to get my
hat and coat to go home, I saw Mrs. Stock
ton in my office. She said, 'Excuse me,
Dr. Brown; I don't feel satisfied with my
reception in the church because I was not
baptized.' I said, 'I think some of the
church membsrs are here,' and Deacon
V;isconcellos said, 'Let us get some water
and she can be baptized here now; I see
no impropriety in it.' She was accordingly
baptized then and there."
The next stage of the testimony was the
episode of the kiss, and it was explained
in this way by the witness:
Airs. Stojfckton's little girl brought him
a note one day from Mrs. Stocl ton con
veying the information that she was sick
and would like him to call upon her. He
railed at 514 Sntter street, and in response
to his knock Mrs. Stockton bade him come
in. He entered, and passing through a
portiere into an Jinner room, found Mrs.
Stockton lying, not in the bed, but on <od
of the bed fully dressed. He stepped up
to the bed and shook hnnds with her, ex
pressed the hope that she would soon re
cover, and was surprised to rind that she
had not special business with him in rela
tion to the church. He supposed that she
had sent for him for the purpose of learn
ing what would be required of her before
she could come into the church. Said the
witness:
I offered a prayer and turned to go. and as I
did so she sprang up in the bed, threw her
arms around me and kissed me. That was the
fim time in my life that 1 ever encouatered
any tiling of that kind.
At the same moment he heard the door
shut and saw a woman's dress disappear
ing.
I said to Mrs. Stockton indignantly in pro
test, "I cannot understand what this means'."
She said, "Oh, that was nothing; only someone
coming in to call on me." Then I immediately
left the room.
It was the very first experience of that kind
that I had in a ministry of many years, and I
was not a little ularmed for fear that the wo
man had designs upon me. but nothing trans
pired. Mrs. Stockton cirme to me the following
Sunday and said that she hoped that I woula
not lay that up against her ani that I would
forgive her. i was willing to do so, as the
Christian spirit calls for forgiveness, and as 1
thought she had done what she (lid thought
lessly and under the influence of the excite
ment of the lever under which she was suffer
ing. 1 greatly feared that if any word about
the occurrence should be spoken there would
result a scandal and I acknowledge that I was
greatly in fear of such a thing happening. Ten
days or two weeks went by before she came
into the church. I thought deeply about it;
whether it was not my duty to speak about it,
and I can see now that it would have been
much better if I had done so.
As the days grew into weeks and the weeks
into months I thought of it only as Â«i transitory
and foolish impulse. 1 wish to say here in con
nection with this matter that Mrs. Stockton
was modestly dressed when she was intro
duced to me on the first two months of our
acquaintance. It impressed me that she was a
struggling young mother trying to earn her
living and my sympathies were aroused.
She asked me once for assistance in adjusting
some trouble she had with a certain friead of
hers who had been helpful to her in the past.
At her request I went to see that man. He was
a friend of her father's in his youth
and he told me that he had ma
terially helped her from time to time,
but had become very much offended with her.
He said to me: "You may depend upon it if
she has made a determination to join thp
church thai she is sincere." All that I did was
to state that she was going to join the church
and lead a Christian life, and that she hoped
that this aged man who had been a frienu of
her father's would give her what assistance he
could.
Mrs. Stockton attended the meetings of this
church in perfect decorum at the morning
services and on Wednesday evenings fre
quently. She mingled with the young ladies
and commended herself to the esteem of crit
ical people like Mrs. French, who named her
first of all on her programme for lhe Turkish
tea.
Attorney Najjleâ l want to ask whether you
had any improper relations with Mrs. Stockton?
Dr. Brownâ No; no, sir (with dramatic em
phasis).
Nagleâ Did you in any way Decome familiar
with Mrs. Stockton?
Brownâ Not in a bad sense.
Nagleâ l mean in a bad sense?
Brownâ No.
Dr. Brown went on to say that weeks
afterward he and his wife called upon Mrs.
Btockton twice. On one of these occasions
she was not at home. He never went to
see her alone. One afternoon, between 4
and 5 o'clock, she met him on Sutter
street. She extended her hand for a warm
shake; they had a few moments' conversa
tion. Then he passed on down the street
and she passed on up the street.
He was having a pood deal of printing
done at Brunt & Co.'s at 535 Ciay street
and also visited Deacon Vasconcello* on
Washington street, between Sansome and
Montgomery. The deacon was treasurer
and the purpose of the doctor in calling
on him so often was to get nionjy from
him to dispense iv charity among the de
serving poor.
The witness declared that he was not
sure that he had never been in the sub
treasury buiiding in this Ciiy, bat he bad
a distinct recollection that business in the
early part of his pastorate had called him
into the sub-treasury building. However,
he would not be positive about tnat. He
never saw Mrs. Stockton in the building,
but he saw her one day coming out of the
building. He thought that he bowed as
she passed, that was all.
One day while he was walking on Mont
gomery street she came up unexpectedly
at his 6ide and walked along with him for
a few blocks to Sutter street, where she
left him and took a car. On another oc
casion she walked with him as far as
Market street. Both these meetings were
accidental and unpremeditated. On an
other occasion he was visiting an elderly
woman, one of his parishioners, on Castro
Heights. When he got into the streetcar
there was ju?t room left for one person,
and Mrs. trtookton, who happened to be in
the cur, moved up so as to give him a seat
beside her. He left the car on Alvarado
street, near Castro, and visited his parish
ioner.
Dr. Brown could not recollect any other
occasion on which he met Mrs. Stockton
outside of the church. He said:
I think that when Mrs. Stockton moved from
514 Butter c treet to the Suther'- "id, and while
she was in the miclstof boxesan. bales, I went
In there to call on another person.
He could not remember the name of the
person upon whom he was calling at that
time.
In the April following, Mrs. Stockton
came to the Brown home with Mrs. Brown
and took lunch with them, and she went
with Mrs. Brown to a meeting addressed
by Rev. Dr. Henry in Odd Fellows' Hall.
The witness also thought that it was
possible that after the Christmas enter
tainment of the infants, Mrs. Stockton
came to his study door and remained two
or three minutes. That was in the day
time.
Attorney Nagleâ Did you meet her in your
oftiee at any other time?
Dr. Brownâ l think not.
Nagleâ Did you ever in your office attempt to
kiss or caress her in any way ?
Brownâ No, sir.
Nagleâ Did you at any other time attempt to
caress that woman?
Brownâ No, sir; her statement is false.
Naglcâ Did yon ever have any clandestine
meeting with Mrs. Stockton at a*ny time out
side of this church?
Brownâ No, sir; I nm not a clandestine man.
I nm not bout that way.
Nagleâ Did you with any woman?
Brown â No, sir.
Dr. Brown recounted the Turkish tea
incident, and paid thÂ»t Mrs. French had
made two charges to him against a certain
member of the church, which, upon inves
tipation, had been found to be unfounded,
except upon false rumors.
On the next day after Mrs. Siockton'had
shown him and Mrs. Brown the letter
which she had received from Mrs. French,
he and Mrs. Brown met Mrs. Stockton
casually near the Lotta fountain at about
4 o'clock in the afternoon. Deacon Eaton
came up and they walked down Market
street together, talking about the Turkish
tea letter. Mrs. Stockton asked Dr. Brown
whether he was going to allow Mrs. French
to give the Turkish tea in the meeting
room of tiie church, and he replied that
Mrs. French had as much right to the use
of that room as he had, whereupon Mrs.
Stockton remarked, "You'll hear from
this again."
"She was in a perfect rage," added the
witness.
The next day Mrs. Cooper told him in
confidence that Mrs. Stockton was an im
pure and disreputable woman and that it
made her flesh crawl when she saw Dr.
Brown and his wife in the car in company
"with that awful woman."
The next time I saw Mrs. Stockton was when
Fhe came into this room convoyed by Mrs.
Cooper and her daughter, one on 'one arm and
the other on the other.
He next told about a visit made to his
office by Mrs. Stockton in company with
another woman. Bhe asked him for a church
letter. She said that she was going to
move to Chicago. He told her that he
would cut off his right hand before he
would give her a letter. As she went away
she said, "You will hear from me."
Nagle (innocently)â Did you hoar from her?
Dr. Brownâ Oh, yes, she has a way of making
her threats good.
Dr. Brown next told of the revelation
made to him by Lawyer George D. Gear to
the effect that Mrs. Stockton had made a
proposition to him to blackmail Dr.
Brown, and how Mr. Gear had nobly
offered to do what he could to assist the
doctor. He declined to act as the doctor's
attorney for the reason that it would be
unprofessional.
The visit of Mrs. Stockton and a lawyer
to the witness' house was next detailed.
The doctor ordered tbe man out of the
house, but afterward apologized to him
when he learned that the man had not
come on a blackmailing errand.
After Mrs. Davidson's arrest Mrs.
Cooper wrote the doctor a letter, he said,
in which she expressed sympathy for him.
and she continued in that strain of mind
until the time when Mrs. Stockton's name
was mentioned in connection with his.
Mr. Naglft said that the object of this
testimony was to show that Mrs. Cooper
was persecuting Dr. Brown. The witness
*m
then went on to say that the reason he
bud not 3poken concerning the revelation
as to Mrs. Stockton's character made to
him Dy Mrs. Cooper was because that rev
elation had been made to him under the
most solemn pledge of secrecy. He denied
having paid Mrs. Stockton $600 or any
other suns at any time.
The Miss Overman episode was then
taken up. When she came to his house to
do sewing he saw that she was in ill
health and he pitied her in his heart. He
and hi 3 wife asked her to stay with them,
and after Miss Overman had heard from
her mother she consented to do so. He
never went to the seaside or anywhere else
with Miss Overman. It was no unusual
thing, he said, for young people to live at
his house. At the time Miss Overman
came there t'nere was a young medical
student named Arthur Finch stopping
with the Browns.
The witness handed Mr. Woodhams a
letter to read which he had recently re
ceived from Mr. Finch. It expressed sym
pathy for the doctor in his trouble, and
when Mr. Woodhams read the following
sentence: "I think it is another effort to
bring disgrace onÂ» all our Protestant
churches, Dr. Brown interrupted Mr.
Woodhams with the remark that he re
gretted that expression. "I have special
reasons for regretting that this matter has
been brought in."
"Sh! Sh!" exclaimed Lawyer Nagle
warhingly. "That has nothing "to do with
this case."
Dr. Brown made a special request of the
reporters that they would not publish the
sentence in the letter that had shocked
him so much. x
The Tacoma trip was then detailed. It
corroborated Miss Overman's statement in
every detail. What was new in it was the
statement of Dr. Brown that Mr. Judab of
the Southern Pacific Company gave him
the half-fare rate for Mattie and himself.
The witness emphatically denied that he
had spoken of Miss Overman as his niece.
"When Miss Overman left this City with
me for Tacoma it was with my wife* kiss
fresh upon her lips," added Dr. Brown
impressively.
Here a recess was taken until 7 p. m.
THE EVENING SESSION.
Deacon Williams of Oakland Sug-
nests a Resolution Favorable
to Dr. Brown.
When the evening Bession convened
with a large crowd present Moderator Mc-
Lean was not present, but it was decided
to go on without him. Attorney Nagle,
who, with Dr. Brown at his elbow, occu
pied a seat in front of the platform, called
Mrs. William E. Aber, who in answer to
the attorney's questions said that she had
been a member of the church for two
years and knew Miss Overman, Mrs. David
son and Dr. Brown.
â When did you first meet Miss Overman ?
At a meeting of the teachers of the Sunday
school.
Did you have frequent conversations with
her? "â¦-,'.â ; :;â¢;, ' â  â¢. â  â -, â¢ .
I did.
Regarding Dr. Brown?
Yes, sir.
â  Did she express any opinion of him?
: Yes. She always spoke of him in the highest
terms."- She told me once that he was a man
who carried his Christian spirit into nis daily
life. ; : :â¢ ,â '' :â â .â . â r Â ; -.â  . - -- .-â â¢:
Did you have a conversation with her shortly
before she went to Tacoma?
Yes, we talked of her trip.
Did you give her any advice about It?
Yes, I suggested that she wait until the next
week before starting. r
Was Dr. Brown going north during the next
week that you mention?
So I understood. I thought she could wait
and ho could escort her.; .
; Do you know whether she took your advice?
I believe she went north at the same time
that Dr. Brown aid.' -
* Did you see her on hor return?
Yes, I met her in this room at the close of
Sabbath-school one day shortly after she re
turned. "
What conversation, if any, did you have at
that time? ; V '
- She told me that she had been very ill while
in Tacoma. I asked her if she was still stop
ping with the Browns, and she .said-no, that
Mrs. Davidson had asked her to come to her
house and that she was staying there for a
while. After. that I saw her frequently.
||l Mrs. Aber further testified ; : that shortly
after Miss Overman's return she told the
witness that she had made up her mind to
unite with the church, 'but that she had
never done, so, as : she waited for Mrs.
Davidson to join with her. ; She said Mrs."
Davidson and Miss Overman came to her
house to take tea with her on the 10th â of
last December, and to spend the evening,
and that after ten Miss Overman said s:.e
had : a 'very important engagement. ;. and
would have to leave. This caused witness
great surprise, as \ thÂ« visitors ? had V agreed
to sj/vuil the evening with her, She aitcx
ward learned through the newspapers that
th ; 3 appointment was with Dr. Brown and
Airs Davidson and concerned the black
mailing matter. In subsequent conversa
tions that she had with Miss Overman and
Mrs. Davidson each tried to injure the
other in the estimation of wants*, bhe
was asked to relate a conversation that
took place between her and Mies Overman
on a certain day, but showed a strong
disinclination to do so. On the sugges
tion of Mr. Nagle it was decided to hear
this testimony in private.
The following cross-examination, con
ducted by Mr. Kee, then ensued:
Do you remember Dr. Brown calling on Mrs.
Davidson during prayer-meeting since Novem
ber last? _ Â . .
The last time I remember Mrs. Dav.ason talc
ing part in the meetings was when Dr. Brown,
on there being a pause, said that the meeting
belonged to those present. Mrs. Davidson then
arose to pray. It was ti beautiful prayer. An
other time she got up and spoke and apolo
gized for doing so, and 1 think Dr. Bro-.vn
might have said something in answer to her
apology. Dr. Brown did not ask her to take
part.
Then Dr. Pond asked the witness if she
had read the testimony of Miss Overman
as published in the papers, and when she
answered that she had he asked her if she
still considered Miss Overman a Christian
woman.
Dr. McLean objected to this line of ex
amination, the question was withdrawn
and Dr. Pond desisted from asking any
more questions.
Mr. Nagle then called for Miss Evans,
Mr. Lovely and Mrs. Tyler, but none of
these intended witnesses for Dr. Brown re
sponded.
The testimony of Mrs. Halligan, the
landlady of Mrs. Davidson, and of Mrs.
Mevers, the former partner of Mrs. David
son" was then read, it having been pro
cured by a committee of councilmen, who
called oil these ladies in company with Dr.
Brown. Nothing of importance was con
tained in either statement.
Attorney Nagle then read the testimony
given by Detective Seymour during the
preliminary hearing of Mrs. Davidson be
fore Judge" Campbell on the charge of
forgery.
Deacon Vasconcellos, under the question
ing of Attorney Na;jle, related the circum
stances under which Mrs. Stockton was bap
tized in the office of Dr. Brown. He entered
Dr. Brown's office on a Sunday after
the morning's service, and was surprised
to find Mrs. Stockton sitting or leaning on
a lounge. A few moments later Dr. Brown
entered and asked the witness if he would
assist in the baptism of M r s. Stockton.
Dr. Brown explained that Mrs. Stockton
had not understood him when he asked all
those who had recently joined the church
to come forward and be baptized, and
wanted to be baptized then. Tne cere
mony was duly performed.
Deacon Vasconcellos also testified that
Dr. Brown had been in the habit of calling
at hia office on Washington street, be
tween Montgomery and Sansome, three
and four time 3 a week, generally between
the hours of 3 and sp. m. / He had never
seen Dr. Brown come to or leave the
church with any lady other than his wife
during all the time he has been pastor of
the church, and could not remember hav
ing heard Dr. Brown call on Mrs. David
son to take part in any prayer-meeting
after November.
No sooner had Deacon Vasconcellos left
the stand ti>an Deacon E. D. Williams of
the First Congregational Church of Oak
land rose from his seat and gave voi-e to
the sensation of thG evening.
"We are all convinced," he oaici, "that
Dr. Brown has not been unduly intimate
with any woman at any time or any place,
and I suggest that the council admit it. I
move it bs decided 'hat the council be sat
isiied that Dr. Brown is not in the habit of
meeting any woman in the church or on
the street or any place, and not let us
waste time in trying to prove what we
cannot prove."
There was a murmur in the crowd and
the people leaned forward in their interest.
The resolution meant a great deal to both
sides. Mr. Nagle was the first to break
the silence.
"If such a resolution prevails," said he,
"the* defense has no more testimony to
offer. Of course Dr. Brown will go ;On the
stand and make his stu.ement; he desires
to do so; but if this resolution bo passed
we have no more eviu^nce to submit."
Dr. McLean looked around for a second
to Deacon Williams' motion. The second
came indefinitely from one group of the
council members.
"You have heard the motion," said the
moderator. "Those who favor it will raise
their hands." Then, after a pause,
"Those opposed. The motion is carried."
There was not a dis3enti:.g hand raised.

of the motionâ in fact only a few voted at
all â but it was declared a unanimous vote,
and the audience drew a deep breath and
commenced to murmur ajrain.
The council adjourned then, but only to
resume session in a back room and free
from the presence of the people. There
were two witnesses whose stories were for
the council, not for the crowd, so to ac
commodate them a session for them alone
was ordered.
Testimony had been introduced to show
that Dr. Brown had been cordial to Mrs.
Davidson, even after the ?500 transaction
had taken place, that he had asked her to
speak in the prayer-meetings, and tnat he i
had spoken words of commendation and
praise and hope and encouragement after
Bhe had finished her prayer or said her
say before the prayer-meetings on Wednes- j
day nights. This testimony Noble Lovely â¢
and Mrs. E. M. Smedley had facts to con"- !
tradict, but Mrs. Sciedley would not speak j
10 the multitude, and seeing that she
would have to have an extra session any
way Mr. Lovely decided to secrete him
self with the council also.
Mr. Lovely was the hrst witness called
after the executive session opened. He
remembered quite vividly the praycr
meetinsr held on the "Wednesday evening
before Mrs. Davidson's arrest. i?he cave a !
lovely prayer, and he becoming interested j
asked his neighbor who she was. Nor
did she stop at the prayer, for afterward
she spoke to the meeting, uttering words
of comfort and cheer. But Dr. Brown had
sat through it all without a word; the
witness noticed tnat Jie looked sober and
distressed and annoyed. He remembered
it because Dr. Brown had looked sober
and distressed and annoyed â so different
from his usual custom. He looked serious, j
too, and bored, and so evident was the
doctor's discomfort that the witness com
mented upon it at home, and afterward
when he went to see Dr. Brown he spoke
of it, too. In the meantime Mrs. David
son had been arresied, and that explained \
the whole matter.
The members of the council were curious
to know how it was Mr. Lovely fixed the j
date of the prayer-meet ing. They wanted, I
too, to know the theme of Mrs. Davidson's
excellent discourse. The witness finally
decided that he fixed the dnte because
Mrs. Davidson had never prayed and ,
spoken at a prayer-meeting before, bhe ;
had prayea and she had spoken, but not,
before had she lifted up her voice under
both conditions in the rrayer-mcctintrs of
the church. As to the theme* the deacon
could not remember it, nor could sugges
tions from Dr. Brown that the themes be :
read for the witness to choose, nor the
probing questions of the councilmen or j
Attorney NaÂ«le bring the themes which j
*o interested him back to the witness.
Then Nagle asked:
Did you notice Dr. Brown : s attitude toward
Yes. lie never made any remark. He looked
very much bored and annoyed.
\\as his conduct such as to cause comment ?
Tli^en the witness tola how he had called
on Dr. Brown last Sunday and had spoken
ol the occurrence he had testified to. He
had told Dr. Brown what he had noticed
ami he had agreed to toil the council.
Mr. Sink asked why he was not willing
to make the statement in public, and he
said Mrs. Smedley objected, and he de
ckled she was right. Then Dr. Brown
asked :
I want .you to state if I led you at all when
you came to see meâ if I suggested anything or
any p*r' of theÂ«:ory to you.
Why. not in the least, doctor, rtplied the
IS. Vo'i were rather sick. 1 guew â¢!
bored you; I thought so after Heft the house.
More questions as to how he fixed the
date were fired at the witness, and then be
gave place to Mrs. bmedley.
Mrs. Smedley is Mr. Lovely'a cousin.
â¢10, vu at the prayer-meeting, and
she, tco, told thÂ« story that Mr. Lovely
had given. She, too. said Dr. Brown
looked sad and annoyed and did not Bpeak
after Mrs. Davidson was through. He
usually spoke after any one had talked
for any extended period, but this time Le
had not. Kis omission fixed the matter
indelibly upon her mind.
Then Mr. Tenney asked: "Are you sure
you have not attached the iook to Dr.
Brown's face since Mrs. Davidson's ar-
"Not thai I Knowof," said Mrs. Smediey,
and then the meeting adjourned.
Afterward the councilmen were called
together acain and they decided that after
the morning session to-day they will ad
antil half-past 10 on Tuesday
morning.
WHO IS DR. BROWN?
The Pertinent Investigation a Ca
nadian Postmaster Wants
Made.
The Federal Department is in receipt af
an odd letter from a postmaster in Canada.
The worthy official is anxious, as his com
munication will show, to know more
about the Brown-Overman scandal, and he
is not averse to asking for particular?, al
though he seems at sea as to the best butt
for his inquirj'.
This is his letter:
Melbourne, Canada, Feb. 22, 1306.
Dear Sir: I saw a piece in one of the daily
papers concerning a certain Rev. Dr. Brown of
your City who the papers stated had not acted
prudently and there was trouble. Would you
kindly describe the man to* me and note par
ticularly his expression of eyes and of his
hands. "Please let this be strictly private, and
oblige Postmaster, Melbourne. Box 103.
â  P. Â£. Kindly state also if he has a wife and
how many children. Please reply as soon as
possible G. W. S.
As there is no particular department in
the Federal Department here the duties of
which are to look utj the matters in ques
tion the Canadian postmaster's inquiry is
likely to go unanswered. The clerk 3
around the Federal building, however,
spent a few minute? each yesterday doing
;he best they could to satisfy the inquiry
by sending the inquirer clippings of Dr.
Brown and everybody else connected with
the case as illustrated in the daily papers.
They aid not even forget to send pictures
of band^ and sections of bodies foreign to
the subject as photographed by means of
the cathode ray.
BACK TO THE BOARD.
Bituminous Kock Specifications Will
Be Again Voted on by the
Supervisors.
The owners of bitumen deposits and
contractors interested iv bituminous rock
street work appeared before the Street
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday to talk over the proposed speci
fications for bituminous rock work that
were vetoed by Mayor Sutro some time
ago and sent back to the committee for
further consideration.
The Jordan bituminous rock representa
tives insisted that a provision allowing 10
per cent of sand to be mixed with the ma
terial should be put in the specifications,
while other owners objected, claiming that
rock that could not be used without the
mixture with sand was not fit for streets
whore heavy traflic was carried on. The
opinion was freely expressed that sand
destroys the life of bitumen. It was finally
decided to send the matter back to the full
board in its present form, and permit the
members to pass the measure over the
Mayor's veto or not as they see fit.
The streetcar companies that have failed
to obey the provisions of their franchises,
requiring them to keep the space between
their tracks up to grade and paved were
given a warning regarding the matter.
Property-owners on Washington street,
between Front and Davis, complained that
tne Ferric? and Presidio Company had
failed to keep the pavement in that block
in order and the Superintendent of Streets
was instructed to notify the company to
be^in the necessary work witniu three
days or the City would have it done and
assess the cost to the corporation. It was
intimated that unless the corporation
lives up to the provisions of its franchise
steps will be taken to have the same for
feited.
The committee decided to recommend
that no plank sidewalks be laid hereafter
in the City. The members agreed that in
lieu of piank sidewalks in the suburban
districts, the Street Superintendent should
require the laying of concrete or bitumen
to the width of at least three feet.
FATHER YORKE
TO REV. MR. ROSS.
Considers Quotations From
a Textbook on Canon
Law.
POPE'S TEMPORAL POWER
Further Charges of Mutilating
Authorities Are Openly
Made.
REFERENCE TO THE CHALLENGE
Relation of Church and State Ex
plainedâA Papal Power That
Is Dsad.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke, in his reply to Rev.
Donald M. Ross, presents the following
letter:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: Yesterday
I considered D. Ross' mutilation of Manning;
to-day I will examine his quotations from
Smitn's Textbook of Canon Law. I have al
ready shown trial this textbooic is nothing but
a textbook, snd that when Ko*s claims any
more authority for it than that of a textbook
he is aitiiisi with his accustomed aishonesty.
1 have also examined two quotations from it.
one concerning the authority to be ascribed to
modes oi civil procedure when used in church
courts and the other concerning that hack
neyed subject, the Bull Unam Sanctam. it is
not necessary, therefore, to examine these
again. I al.-o reserve all the extracts concern
ing marriage for a separate letter.
THE DEPOSING POWER.
Several times in this controversy I have ex
plained toe nature of the deposing power.
I'urine the middle as;es the Popes deposed eer
;>U!i Tue right was one given
them by the Christian constitution of Europe.
After the middle ages that practice passed
away, because the constitution of Europe was
fundeinentaliy changed.
Now Ross brings us this question of the de
posing power again as if it had never been
heard of before. He brings it up to prove his
contention that the Pope and the priests ought
to have dominion over temporal affairs. This
is his argument:
I quote now from the same work, volume 1, of
Ecclesiastical . Law, po?e 252. The head of the
page, in large letters across the top, reads,- "On the
rights of the Supreme Pontiffs in temporal affairs."
i hen under It there are lour different points. You
see? Peter C. Yorke can quote 1, and I can quote
2, and he can quote 3, and I can quote 4, and then
we can chew the air for the rest or the year and not
g-t near each other. Well, after writing a great
deal about it this conclusion is arrived at: The
first is untenable, the second is heretical, the
third advanced by Bellarmine " and â  others
maintains that the Pope has "jure dlvlno"
on y spiritual, but no direct or immediate tem
poral power: tUat, however, by virtue of his
spiritual authority he is possessed of power, indi
rect indeed, but nevertheless supreme in temporal
concern of Christian rulers and people: that he
may therefore depose Christian sovereigns should
the spiritual welfare of a nation so demand. Thus,
as a matter of fact, .Pope Innocent IV, in pro
nouncing-sentence of deposition against Frederick
11, explicitly says that he deposes the
Emperor "anctoritate apostoliea et vi clav
ium." The fourth opinion holds that the sov
ereign Pontiff has full spiritual authority over
princes no less time over the faith, to instruct
them in their respective duties, to correct and
inflict spiritual punisb-ment upon both rulers and
peoples, but that "jure diviDo" he has no power, as
asserted by Bellarrnine, whether direct or indirect,
in the temporal affairs of Catholic sovereigns and
peoples.' * â *.-* The third and fourth seem to
(lifter chiefly as to the deposing power of the PoÂ«es,
but agree in granting that the Roman Pontiff
hag an indirect power ill temporal things: both
may be lawfully held. -.- â â '.. â¢
â .That question is from volume 1 Of Ecclesl&stial
Law, page '-'52. r
Concerning this quotation, let me remark in
passing that it is t-o badly mutilated that even
with the original before me l had difficulty in
recognizing it. The opening words are taken
from page 252, then D. Ross skips back to page
251. He works slowly over to the top of page
252 again. Tfeeoce he dives into tne middle of
the paragraph and comes to a full stop.
CATHOLIC DOCTRINE,
However, this is immaterial. The point to
be noticed is that B.Ross evidently does not
understand the terms of my chal
lenge. When I called on him to produce from
Catholic publications these four propositions,
or the substance of them. 1 was careful to add
'â aÂ« expressions of Catholic doctrine or teach
ing." Now the term Catholic doctrine or
teaching has a very definite signification.
It means those things which Catholics are
bound to believe. It rulers to the dogmas of
the faith, the truths of revelation. Therefore
when D. Ross laments that there are two or
three opinions among Catholics on a certain
point he virtually confesses that neither of
these opinions is Catholic doctrine. The fact
that, they are disputed shows that the Catholic
Church doe* not teach one or the other. Hencu
opinions about the deposing power of the Pope
are as much Catholic doctrine as opinions
about the habitability of the moon or the
canals of Mars.
IND IRFXT TEMPORAL POWKR.
This indirect temporal power which gives D.
Ross and his fellow-patriots such concern is a
very simple matter and I cannot remember
now how rnanv ti::ies I have explained it. Per
mit me tc make a last effort to show what it
really mean?.
1. There are two powers which divide between
them the government of the human race â
church and Mate.
2. The state has its own sphere, namely, the
temporal or civil, and withiu that sphere it
is supreme.
3. The church hasitsown sphere, namely, the
spiritual, and in spirituals the church is su
preme.
4. The power of the sfnte is a temporal power
because it comes Immediately from a temporal
source and is concerned with temporal things.
5. The power of the church is a spiritual
power because it comes immediately from a
spiritual source and is concerned about
spiritual things.
<j. The power of the state does not touch
things spiritual because as in this country
the state has no right to interfere with re'-
ligion.
7. The spiritual power of the church is exer
cised upon men and upon such temporal
things as church buildings, societies and the
like.
8. Tn speaking of a government we often de
nominate its power from the object on which
it is exercised. We speak of the military
I power of the United States, not that we meau
I that our Government is founded on bayonets,
! but that the power is exercised over military
â¢ bodies. We speak of the colonial power of the
British Government, not meaning that the
colonies give power to toe British Govern- I
ment, but that the power is exercised over the
colonies.
9. Hence, as the spiritual j ower of the
Chord) is exercised over men and certain tem
poral things, we speak of that spiritual power
as an indirect temporal power. We do not
mean thereby that the Pope or the church
uoimiMOl civil or temporal dominion or sover
eignty, but that the spiritual power of the
church is exercised over temporal things.
Hence you will remark that Bellarmine is
careful to say that the Pope's power is only
! .spiritual, and that no matter how he may rise
it or on what he may use it, that power still
remains spiritual.
There is nothing in this theory, or in any
i other theory held among Catholics, to show
! that the Pops and the priests ought to have
I dominion or â DYenign authority over tem
i poral things. When the Methodist uhureh
j collects large sums of money for missionary
purposes are we to suppose that it is claiming
sovereignty over the United States? When
the Presbyterian kirk uses its authority to
promote the cessation of work of Sunday are
we to believe that Presbyterians are running
th* country?
The indirect temporal power of the Pope
means merely that he may use his spiritual
authority on temporal concern*. For instance,
i ii be thinks that the liquor traffic is a menace
! to good morals he might forbid the liquor
I traffic. But his prohibition would only be by
spiritual authority, and would be efficacious
only for those who" recognize that spiritual au
thority. We would speak of that spiritual
authority, however, as the indirect temporal
power, because it Is concerned with temporal
things, namely, the liquor traffic.
What menace is there to our ireedom in this
power? pearly all the Protestant churches
have exercised this indirect temporal power
in this particular case. Are we therefore to
suppose that they are seeking dominion over
temporal things ?

But it may be urged suppose the Pope should
declare it a menace to good moral? * â  "over

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH G, J896.
smile and a request not to indulge in absur
dities.
llowever, D. Ross, with true Scotch uncon
sciousness of the ludicrous, goes on with his
alleged argument:
But to return to the quotation from ecclesiastical;
law. "By what right was the deposing power ex
erted by the sovereign pontiffs?" That is a ques
tion that is taken from page 258 of the ecclesias
tical law, and is the heading. In other words, the
question is simply this: The Catholic church asks
by what right should the Pope of Rome = tell
rover Cleveland â  to step down and out of the
White House at Washington? By what right was
the deposing power of any: king exercised by the
Pope of Home? That is what . 1 would like -to
know: By what right? This Is the answer:.
There are "two opinions among Catholic, writ
ers." Now you know . Father Yorke would quote
one of these opiuions and' I , would quote. the
other and we would both be right. Tho most slip
pery business I over haa anything to do with is the,
business of sliding; around among these books, as I
have for the last three months. Bat It snys:
"There are two opinions among Catholic writers.
The one holds that it was exercised merely by vir- j
tue of the 'jus publlcum'â that means the public
right, the public defense as we would call it â the
medieval ages. The other that the deposing power
as exercised by Gregory V II and the; Other Pon
tiffs is inherent in the primacy, being included in
the indirect power of the Pope In temporal things. i
This opinion is thus expressed In our article on
Gregory VII published In 'Brownson's Quarterly
Review, # pril, 1875. 'The power itself (i. c., of
deposing Princes) In ra^ice we hold is inherent in
the Papacy, the power in action or its exercise de
pends on external circumstances.' " tfc
In other words, it you can kick him ; off tho
throne then it Is of course right to do it. but if you
cannot you bad better let him; alone,. But this is
significant. By what right was the deposing power
exercised by the sovereign Pontiffs of Rome? That
question is taken from the canon law of the Catno
lic church. By wb'at right did the â¢ Popes turn
Kings off their thrones? By what right did the
Popes of Home overturn Governments? By what
right did the Roman Catholic church depose sov
ereigns? We are told that he did it because the
right was inherent in the papacy. My friends, if
the right Is inherent in the Catholic church to turn
Presidents or Kings from their thrones or seats. is
it not true that the Catholic church teaches that it
ought to have dominion over temporal affairs?
And the Catholic church teaches that the right
to depose sovereigns, the right to overturn Govern
ments, is inherent in the papacy, and yet 1 am
asked and defied to iind in Catholic publications
any proof that the Catholic church teaches that it
ought to have dominion over temporal affairs. The
extract just read is taken from volume 1, pago
258, of the Ecclesiastical .Law.
I now read from the same volume, page 269:
1 1" Pope Pius -IX, in one of his' discourses, says
that the right of deposing princes has nothing to
do with the pontifical infallibility, neither does it
How from the infallibility, but from the authority
of the Pontiff. Of course a Catholic is bound, not
only by what the Pope defines ex cathedra, but
also to accept and obey what he otherwise com
mands." . ~ . ...
I know of nothing more dishonest, more con
sciously unfair than the above excerpt. Ross
informs his audience that the Pope has the
right to depose Cleveland, or to depose any
other ruler, mid he informs them that Cath
olics claim that such right is inherent in the
Papacy.
Yet the very opening sentence of the para
graph showed that the author did not recog
nize the "deposing power" as having any ex
igence now. He says, "This question is at
present of little consequence." It is a histori
cal question merely, and deals with the power
exercised in the middle ages.
Again, Ross makes it appear as if the church
haxi tne right to depose Grover Cleveland, yet
this very same opening sentence informed him
that even in the middle ages the deposing
power could be exercised only on Princes
"who are Catholics, not only as individuals
but as rulers; in other words, only those
Princes who are at the head of Catholic na
tions, where the Catholic religion is the only
religion recognized by law."
Moreover he goes on strumming the same
old string, the right is inherent in the Papacy,
the Pope claims the right of deposing the Pres
ident of the United States, yet this absolutely
honest man, I). Ross, had before his eyes this
sentence on page 259: "While therefore in
FORMER TIMES THE EXERCISE OF THE DEPOSING
POWSB WAS LEGITIMATE, IT WOULD NOT BE LEGITI
MATE AT PRESENT.' '
Ido not think, Mr. Editor, that any other
demonstration of V. Ross's dishonesty is
needed. No wonder he still refuses to submit
his authorities to three unbiased non-Caiholic
lawyers. No wonder he chose Sherman, a man
purblind with passion, to be his judge. Judas
Iseariot would deal gently with the slips of
Ananias.
THE INHERENT RIGHT.
Eut what is meant by the statement that the
deposing power is inherent in the papaiy?
Let us remember that all agree that the jus
rniblicum of medieval Europe recognized this
power in the Pope. Jus nuWieum does not
mean, as onr Latin scholar D. Ross says, public
defense, but it means practically the constitu
tion of Christian Europe. Just as the federated
States of thifi Union recoenize tUfi Supreme
Court as a court of last resort, so the Christian
States of Europe recognized tiie Pope as a su
preme court.
Sow the question arises why did they so rec
ognize him? We recognize the Supreme Court
because the Supreme Oourt has been created
for that purpose. Why did the European
powers recognize the Pope a3 their civil su
preme court since he had been created for
other purposes?
The answer is given in the quotation: "In
radice tlie power is inherent in the Papacy."
D. Ross quickly drops "in radice" and does
not seem to know whether it means house rent
or radishes. "In radice" means ''in the root."
and the whole expression signifies that the de
posing power conferred in the Pope by the nÂ«
tions had its root in the very idea of the
Papacy. That is to say, there is something in
the very nature of the Papacy which would
suggest to people in the middle ages, who were
anxious to constitute a Supreme Court, to se
lect the Pope for that office.
What, therefore, is that power In the Papacy
which the nations of medieval Europe consid
ered as good rea-on for making the Pope their
arbitrator? It is known as the power of the
keys. The Pope was supreme in spiritual mat
ters. He was the hea â¢: of the universal re
ligion; tlierefore when the European states
wished to erect a supreme court they naturally
looked to the Pope. They did this thu more
readily thatt.;e questions they wished to bring
beforettiis court were really religious ques
ti'<nÂ«i, namely, the moral titi.jss of their rulers.
Hence it is said thnt at the root of this depos
ing power lay something which is inherent in
the Papacy, or that the germ of the deposUig
power, as il existed in the middle ages, was to
be found in the very idea of a Supreme Pontiff.
How dishonest i*. Is to twist these words
around and make them mean that the Pone
teaches that he ought to have that power
again! I). Ross quotes from Pius IX to sus
tain his opinion, but let me finish the whole
quotation. I have already used it in my reply
to Dr..\Vendte, but it extinguishes the later as
well as the earlier ftaud:
This right of deposing princes without doubt has
been exercised by the supreme pontiffs from time
to time in extreme cases, but it has nothing to do
with the pontifical inlallibility, neither does it
flow from the infallibility but from the authority
Of the Pontiff.
Moreover, the exercise of this right in thoie
ages of faith which respected in the Pope that
which he la. that is to say, the supreme judge of
Christendom, and recognized the benefit of his tri
bunal In the great contentions of peoples and of
sovereigns, was freely extended by aid of public
jurisprudence and the common consent of nations
to the gravest interests of states and of their
rulers..
But altogether different are the conditions of the
present time from the condition of those aces, and
malice alone can confound things so diverseâ that
i* to say, the infallible judgment in respect to
truths of divine revelation with the ri*hÂ« . which
the Popes exercised in virtue of heir authority
when the<-ornnion good demanded it. They knew
.better than we, and everybody can discern the rea
son why such an absurd confusion of ideas is
stirred Tip at this time, and why hypothetical eases
are paraded of which no man thinks. It is lie
cause every pretext, even the most frivolous and
furthest from the truth, In eagerly caught at, pro
vided it be of a kind to give us annoyance and to
excite civil rulers against the church. .
To sum up then the deposing- power of the
Pope was a right given him in the middles
ages. That deposing power no longer exist*.
In fact, its. exercise would not be legitimate
now, yet D. Ross proclaims it to the world as
proof that the Pope and the priests ought to
have dominion over temporal affairs. Yours
truly, P. C. Yohke.
Curious Coincidences.
"SpeaKing of curious coincidences of our
everyday life, two little things happened a
short time ago that are, pertiaps, worthy
of repeating," said an insurance man to
another. "My wife has long wished for
an olive fork. We had used a table-fork
"and then substituted a pair of candy tongs,
but neither proved to be the right thing.
A few evenings before Christmas my wife
asked me to Duy an olive fork, but I wasn't
overburdened with money at the time, and
so, much aeainst my will, I was obliged to
ask her to wait a little. As I was about
to step into the office building the next
morning I saw directly in front of me a
small jewelers' box. and inside it there
lay the identical fork my wife wanted. I
sent .'i note to the jeweler, telling him the
owner could have it by calling at my
house. No one ever came, and at present
it is in active service on my dining-room
table.
"Sometime before this a young girl,
who had become encaged to a chum ot
mine, wanted a small, chased gold ring in
lieu of a solitaire diamond. In our quest
we entered a shop and in one of the cases
we saw a pretty rin -. When we looked at
it we noticed in the inside some engraved
initials, which proved to be those of my
chum and his affianced. The salesman
said that the ring hail been ordered sev
eral months previous, but had never been
called for. My friend never told the inci
dent to his betrothed until after their mar
riaee. Curious instances of coincidences,
were they not?"â New York Tribune.
EXTERMINATING THE CRAB
The Industry in the Bay Has
Grown to Threatening
Proportions.
PROHIBITORY LAWS NEEDED.
Fish Commissioners Have Become
Alarmed at the Wholesale
Slaughter.
The Fish Commissioners are deeply con
cerned over the imminent extermination
of the crab in and about San Francisco
bay, and propose to have a clause inserted
in the game laws at the next session of the
Legislature to save this edible fish.
It was only recently that the matter was
brought under the attention of the State
authorities. Then an investigation was
made into the condition of the crab-fishing
industry, with a view of ascertaining in
what measure this rumored extermination
was progressing. The facts gleaned were
a surprise to those interested in preserving
the crab and proved to be interesting news
for fishermen themselves.
It is well known that the crab lives almost
exclusively about the bay of San Fran
cisco, and that conditions, though ap
parently alike in other places along the
coast of California, are not favorable to the
crab. A test is being made at Monterey
and San Diego with transplanted crabs
from San Francisco, but for all practical
purposes at present the supply of crabs
must come from this bay. Consequently
the enormous catch is regarded with grave
suspicions, and it is held by those who
understand this fish that some protective
measures must be adopted.
Small and insignificant as the industry
of crab-catching may appear it is never
theless an important source of revenue.
At the present time there are about sixty
boats engaged in this industry in San
Francisco. The business is largely pur
sued outside the heads of the Golden Gate
and along the south shore. Each boat has
two men who work in partnership. Their
average daily catch is ten dozen craba to
a boat. Now this makes a total of 7-00 a
day, or 2,628,000 crabs a year, from which
figures it. is inferred that the crab cannot
last many years. The average price ob
tained from retailers by the crab-fishers is
50 cents a dozen, and at that rate the fish
ers earn above all expenses about $12 a
weefc each. These figures were obtained
at the wnarf from men who have watched
the fishing industry in all its phases. The
Fish Commission estimated that in 1892
the total amount received from crab fish
ing was $102,900, which, at the rate of 30
cents a dozen, would make the entire catch
for the year about 2,500,000.
President Murdoch of the commission
said there were well-grounded fears for the
future of the crab in these waters.
"There are more boats in the business
now than ever before," he said, "and it
has grown to immense proportions. The
female crab is taken witti the male, and
we nave found that millions, probably, of
spawn are thus lost. The female is a
sDiall, puny fish in comparison with the
male, which is far and away better for
food. Indeed, the female is hardly an
edible fish. But everything is fish that
comes into the crabcatchers' nets. By
protecting the female the crab may be
preserved for future generations. That
can be done by the fishermen dropping the
females back into the water from their
nets, and this we propose to niflke com
pulsory by having a law to that effect
passed by the Legislature."
The crabs caught tiore are shipped in
large quantities to Southern California, to
Sacramento and other interior cities, and
this being a new development of the in
dustry there is a strong temptation to ex
tend the business.

BELVEDERE IN DISPUTE.
Effort to Recover the Land
to the Govern
ment.
Innocent Purchasers Will Not, How
ever, Be Disturbed in the
Beautiful Suburb.
An important suit has been begun in
the United States courts to recover to the
Government a large tract of land alleged
to have been filched from it under the
fraudulent methods outlined in the peti
tion of Zach Montgomery published in
yesterday's Call.
The land referred to is included in the
Mexican grant known as the Corte Ma
deradel Presidio, adjoining Sansahto and
covering all the area of "beautiful Belvi
dere," and extends along the west side of
the bay toTiburon, ancl thence north and
east, including some of the finest land in
Marin County. Judge McKisick repre
sents the Government.
The proceedings, however, do not seek
to disturb the holdings of innocent pur
chasers of these lands, so that the dwellers
upon the bluffs over there need not worry.
It is claimed, however, that there are suf
ficiently large tracts still held by the orig
inal schemers or their heirs to warrant the
suit to recover.
The suit is entitled the United States
acainst John Reed and others. Reed is
the son of the original locator of the claim,
Juan Eeed. As located originally the
claim amounted to one sauare league,
which was surveyed by United States Gov
ernment Surveyor Matthewson and ap
proved by the Government In 1859. Reed,
however, did not takeout his patent but
waited until 1860, when Congress passsed
an act authorizing the surveys of con
firmed grants to be brought into the Dis
trict Court.
A man named Bolton, according to the
allegations of the complaint, finding this
grant had never been patented, made a
contract with the Reed heirs by which he
was to get half of all the lands lying out
side the Government survey if he could get
that survey set aside and a new survey
rande to include more lands.
Under the new act of Congress the sur
vey was brought into court and for the
first time the Reed heirs objected to the
Matthewson survey. Their protest was
disallowed, however, and the survey ap
proved.
Then in 1864 another act of Congress
authorized surveys of confirmed grants not
patented to be brought before the Com
missioner of the Land Office.
Under that act Bolton, or one Valentine,
who had become his successor, got the case
into the land office at Washington, and
with a perseverance that was remarkable
kept the matter alive before that office and
the Secretary of the Interior until 1885,
when the Secretary made an order for the
issuance of a patent to all the land claimed.
The patent included the magnificent tract
of 37,000 acres of public land lying'outside
of the Matthewson survey. This the Gov
ernment is nor: trying to recover, declar
ing that the Mexican Government never
granted thi3 land to Juan Reed.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures I
at station indicate maximum temperature for the â 
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of j
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and huDdredths. '
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid !
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or (lotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "huh" means nigh, barometric pressure and i
Is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low" j
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded and i
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" ;
usually first appear on the Washington coast. i
When the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north and
â outh along the coast, rain is probable; but when
the "low" is inclosed with isobars of marked curva
ture rain sooth of Oregon is improbable. With a
"high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these conditions will produce
in opposite result.

HEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., .March s.âDuring the early
trading at the Stock Exchange the market was in
the main firm. The improvement in prices ranged
from 14 to '_' per cent and was most pronounced in
the case of Tobacco and Burlington and Quincy.
The short interest in these stocks has assumed
large proportions of late and, as usual in a limited
market, speculators are nervous. It was but natu
ral for the shorts to rush into cover when the slocks
referred to began to give evidence of strength.
The bears, in their efforts to cover, putupTobac
co to 78 and Burlington and Quincy to 775/ 8.
'â Alien the demand from the short interest abated,
the market weakened. Baltimore and Ohio sold
clown to 15y 2 , the lowest point ever touched. '1 he
weakness of the stocK finally affected the general
list, and in he last hour the whole market was
heavy. The weakness of Baltimore and Ohio was
due to the general belief thai the stock will be
lieavily assessed in the proposed reorganization.
I It was announced to-day that President Fitz
gerald of the Mercantile Trust Company is to be the
Chairman 01 the reorganization committee.
August Belmont and Henry Budge have been
added to the committee.
I In t(;e industrials Sugar and General Electric
were strong and Rubber irregular. The resigna
tions of President Baunigan and Director llollins of
the rubber company kept this stock feverish. In
the closing hour the market was weak on realiza-.
tions. Net changes show losses of Vi@l cent.
Baltimore and Ohio, however, lost 35/ 8. Total
pales, 193,700 shares.
t Bonds were strong, sales footing up $1,472,000.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. 111., March s.â Wheat was in a
quiescent state to-day, moving but fractionally in
either direction and evidencing the lack of news
and aull business. The receipts In the Northwest
were somewhat lighter this morning, 310 cars ar
riving against 465 last Thursday and 381 a year
ago. The Cincinnati Price Current was a trifle
bullish In its tenor, but not enough so to encourage
traders to buy. Liverpool cables were quiet and
y a d higher.
Chicago received 50 cars and inspected out 66.
--403 bushels. The buying of a fair-sized line by a
prominent house was the only transaction of the
entire session that was at all worthy of comment.

Antwerp unchanged. Export clearances were fair
at 329,000 bushels. The close was firm, with early
sellers buying back their wheat. May opened
from 695.-8 Cto 67V8C. declined to &6%@86%c. ral
lied and closed at 67S' B e, Vie higher than yester
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 70 cars.

honors of inactivity. Wheat, little trading as there
was. was principally done by privilege holder* and
their returns were not particularly remunerative.
Receipts were 422 car?, about the number ex
pected. Withdrawals from store were 64,618
bushels. Liverpool cables quoted l/^d decline at
that place. Export clearances amounted to 377,
--381 bushels. May corn opened at 30S/ B e, sold at '
I 303,4 c, Closing at the inside V M c under yesterday.

j fluctuating inclination of prices being due to the
i absence of business. Receipts were 245 cars.

els. May oats closed a shade higher than yester- |
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 240 cars.

COALâ A circular for Australia says: "The ex
tremely light imports for the past thirty days have
served to materially reduce some of our Colonial
grades, particularly Wallsend, of which there is at
present very little stock and but a small quantity
to arrive in the next two months. The consequence
is this special grade Is in demand at full figures. if
already afloat. Some sales were made last month
of outside grades of Australian at seemingly very
low figures. Freights have since advanced Is IS
ton, and It is generally believed that producers will
mark up their output shortly, so that future con
, tracts will be at better figures; that is already as- 1
sured/as better offers are already being made with- \
out finding sellers. The recent' welcome rainfall
Insuring us a bountiful harvest, may later on lead
to an improvement in outward grain freights, and
will cause shipowners ' to seek this port for busi- !
ness. As 80% of the foreign material imported will j
be Coal, we may naturally expect liberal ship- i
ments about the last of the year. There is at pres- i
ent listed to load and now afloat for this port from I
Sydney and Newcastle over 100,000 tons capacity I

FILLS A SOLDIER'S GRAVE
Father Wood, the Old Salvation
ist, Will Never March
Again.
BURIED BY HIS COMRADES.
Whatever Was the Secret of His
Early Life It Has Gone to the
Grave With Him.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 5. \
"Father" Wood of the Salvation Army
was buried to-day according to the ritual
of that organization. Many members of
the army attended in uniform, and as the
solitary hearse proceeded from Wood's
room to the barracks, flanked on either
side by pall-bearers in uniform, it at
tracted more than ordinary attention.
There were no relatives present, as
Father Wood is not Known to have a
single one living. Very little is known
about the early life of Wood, and he never
confided that part of his history to his
comrades. It was generally supposed
that be had been at one time a man of
some standing in the world, as his man
ner gave evidence of some refinement,
but no one learned the secrets of his
past. It was understood that he had
:iever married, and that when the army
"picked him up" a few years ago, he was
in the gutter of degradation.
He was far from being an attractive
man when the woric of reformation
commenced. The evidences of dissipa
tion were painfully apparent, and in his
system the germ's of consumption had
found ready soil. But he lived long
enough to prove that he had stamina
enough to Keep from retreating. The old
man was 'gritty, and although the army
was pledged to support him he worked
wheneverhe feit able and preserved his
independent spirit.
When he had satisfied himself that the
Salvation Army intended to stick by him
he turned over to the officers a couple of
hundred dollars on the condition that he
should always have a shelter while he
lived.
The contract was only a verbal one, but
it was strictly kept. Father Wood did all
he could to help himself and the army did
the rest.
Thousands of people in this City are
familiar with the figure of Father Wood,
and will miss him from the nightly march.
He walkeii with a military bearing, and
gave evidence of having been an old sol
tiier.
The simple story told by Ensign Reid
over his coffin placed the worn-out old
warrior in the light of a man whose re
ward made his lot infinitely superior to
those who stood around the bier.
i A few frost-nipped roses and some
sprigs of fragrant heliotrope were placed
on the coffin. Rather than have the ig
nominy of a pauper's burial ca> on the
remains of their comrade, the soldiers had
subscribed for the simple funeral ex
pense?.
'â¢Father Wood is dead," said Ensign
Reid, "but his example of faithfulness
wiJiiive forever."
Another Trust Contest.
OAKLAND, Cal.. March s.â The for
tune of the Jr.te Elizabeth L. Cook, amount

case of Rachel Kimbail, a sister of the de

came up for trial before Judge Oeden to
day with the Public Administrator an in
terested party on the plaintiff's side.
Plaintiff claims as she is the only heir to
the property she should have it instead of
allowing Tripp to hold it as a trustee. He
in turn claims it was all given to him with
instructions how to dispose of it so that it
would not hare to go into probate.
He was estopped from proceeding by a
suit instituted by Public Administrator
Knight wherein the latter secured judg
ment for $10,000. The case is so tangled
that it will take months, if not years, to
settle.

DOWNES HAS DISAPPEARED
It Is Thought the Old Man
Committed Suicide in
Alameda.
Telephone Subscribers Protest Against
Nickel-in-the-Slot Attach
ments.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 6-.â Patrick
Downes has disappeared and it is thought
be may have committed suicide. He was
; a :naii not vigorous of mind, w*io floated
hither and thithc without aim or object
or consecutive effort. Four months ago
he was arrested for being a vagrant and
was held before Justice Morris. The
magistrate, instead & sending him to jail,
set him to doing chores about the magis
terial residence for his keep. Tor a time
all went well and then the old man began
I to grow restless again and to talk mysteri
ously of dying and ending his troubles.
Suddenly he disappeared, and now that
his peculiarities are remembered it is
thought he may have wandered away to
some secluded spot and ended his life.
Downes is the man who attracted atten
tion in San Francisco a year ago by throw
ing a cobblestone through one of the
large plate-glass windows of J. J. O'Brien's
store, claiming he did so to get shelter and
food tnrough arrest. In this he was but
temporarily successful, however, for a
sympathetic jury, hearing the story of his
woe, acquitted liitr. of the charge of mali
cious mischief.
Protest About Telephones.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March s.â The busi
ness men of Alameda are up in arms
against the action of the telephone com
pany in putting nickel-in-the-slot attach
ments on their telephones. The machines
only permit of forty calls during the
month, each one over that number costing
the subscriber 3 cents out of every 5
dropped* in the slot, and this discrimina
tion the merchants protest against. A
petition for presentation to the Sunset
Telephone and Telegraph Company is
Deing circulated by A. P. Smiley and James
A. Munroe, which reads:
Vie, trie undersigned, contract subscribers to
your telephone, request that the nickel-in-the
slot contrivance be removed from your tele
phones, and that our use of the said telephones
be not limited by said contrivance, but that
we be permitted to use the telephones in ac
cordance with the terms of our contracts with
you. In case this request is not acceded to, we
iiesire the removal of the 6aid telephones.
The petition already has a long list of
names attached to it. The merchants
argue that forty switches a month means
a little over one each day, which is en
tirely out of proportion to the amount of
cost of rental.
Funeral of Mrs. McLean.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 5. â The re
mains of the late Mrs. Mary Eliza Mc-
I Lean, the wife of the Health Officer of
Alameda, have been embalmed, and their

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
LETS HIS LIGHT SHINE
But It Is Always With the
Aid of a "Borrowed"
Stereopticon.
A RELIGIOUS KLEPTOMANIAC.
Remarkable Career of Rev. J. H. Scott,
Under Arrest for Embezzling a
Magic-Lantern.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. f
The latest natural curiosity to develop
on this side of the bay is a reiigious klep
tomaniac, with a predominating penchant
for stereopticon outfits, valuable ones re
ceiving the preference.
A few weeks ago The Call published a
story of how A. J. MacMurtry had been
swindled out of a valuable stereopticon
apparatus that he loaned the "Rev." C. H.
Scott some months ago. Scott represented
himself as an Arizona evangelist, and,
after establishing himself firmly in the
good graces of Christian people, he mani
fested a desire to borrow, always in the
interests of the work of religion. Recently
Scott was arrested in Los Angeles, and
MacMurtry has sworn out a warrant for
embezzlement. An officer was sent down
to-day and the "reverend" Mr. Scott will
have a chance to explain his actions next
week before Judge vVood in the Police
Court.
Since the publication of the story in The
Call evidences of Mr. Scott's borrowing
mania have been made known in various
parts of the country. He was first heard
of in 1893 in Canton, N. J., where he en
tered the St, Lawrence University to take
up a special course of study. He said his
home was in California, and that he was
a regularly ordained Congregational min
ister; that he had circumnavigated the
globe as a captain of a man-of-war: that
he had penetrated the ic3' north with the
pole-seeking Schwatka; that he had been
a missionary among the red rovers of the
plains, and that be was the owner of a
fine stereopticon which had become sepa
rated from him and lost.
At that time he had several sets of fine
magic-lantern slides, illustrative of polar
scenes, and he wanted to give a lecture on
Alaska. He learned that Professor Priest
had a fine double stereopticon, so he "bor
rowed" it, and a few days later the rev
erend lecturer and the professor's outfit
were missing.
"Rev." Scott next turned up at Nor
wood, Vt. He had Professor Priest's re
liable outfit with him, and when his iden
tity was discovered he was arrested and
taken to New Jersey. Upon his returninc
and paying the costs the charge was dis
missed and Scott faded from view in that
State. Shortly after he left news was re
ceived that he was wanted in Illinois for
"borrowing" a stereopticon from a minis
terial friend and skipping out.
After leaving Canton "Rev." C. H. Scott
made a trip to California on "borrowed"'
money, and tnen was heard from at Al
burg Springs, Vt., where he was kjiown as
Rev. Henry Clay Steele, and where he was
engaged to preach. He was a man of fine
appearance, eood address and much elo
quence, and his congregation raised the
necessary funds and sent him to Chicago
for his wife and child. After taking in the
World's Fair he returned with a plausible
story regarding his family and soon after
ward skipped witn missionary funds to the
amount of $160 and a lot of "borrowed"
books, besides forgetting his board bill.
A few months later he appeared at Mid
dletown Spring?, where he gave good satis
faction as a Baptist preacher.
The church authorities grew suspicious
andstaited an investigation when Scott
took a letter from the Postomce directed
to a deacon and containing charges
against him. He at once "borrowed' a
team and carriage and drove to the nearest
railway station.
He next appeared in Arizona and last of
all at Los Angeles, taking in Mr. Mac-
Murtry of Oakland e:i route.
"I intend to prosecute him to the full
extent of the law," said MacMurtry, "but
I expect it will be difficult to make a
charge of embezzlement stick."
CO-EDS PLANT GARDENS.
They Will Lay Out the Grounds
Around North Hall With
Flowers.
Duties of the Local Health Officer.
Higgins Wants to Sell Liquor.
News Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 5.- North
Hall, the oldest of the buildings at the
State University, and the one on three
sides of which extensive excavating has
been recently done by the student laboi
ersÂ», is soon to be surrounded with gardens
of roses, geraniums, shrubs, deciduous
trees, ivy and other trailing and twining
vines.
The co-eds are to do all this. The plant
ing of flowers and shrubbery and the beau
tifying of the grounds in close proximity
to the old wooden structure is to be their
part in the student labor movement.
Though they will not actually get out and
â¢ work with the ?pades and sticvels them
j selves, they will furnish means to pur
chase the plants and to pay for the labor
in having them set out.
Just whether grass will be sown on the
t:.ree sides of the hiill where the excavat
ing has been going dn is a matter of specu
ulation, but that its surroundings will be
made more assuming by the effort* of the
co-eds is assuied, so Regent lleinstein said
to-day.
The young Cornell of the university
lia"e been anxious to do something toward
beautifying the grounds ever since the re
cent labor movement was proposed by Mr.
Keinstein, but nothing has appeared to
them in so plausible a light as Hie plant
ing and rearing of a flower garden around
the recitation hall.
Nothing can be done in this new depart
ure until the work of leveling off the
ground in the vicinity of North Hall has
been completed -and the time for the stu
dent laborers to do this only depends
upon how soon the weather will permit.
Lnose who know of the new scheme
among the co-eds seem to think that it
will be much more productive of lasting
Kood than any of the others which have
been mentioned.
liealth Officer's Duties.
BERKELEY, Cal., March s.â Objections
have boen raised to the ordinance passed
borne months aco by the Town Trustees
creating a Health Officer for Berkeley. The
ordinance gives the Health Officer power
"to act upon, def.ne, determine and ad
judge what shall constitute a nuisance in
the town of Berkeley," and all per
sons who refuse to comply with an order
from the Health Ollicer to abate what he<
may have declared to be a nuisance shall
be deemed guilty of misdemeanor, punish
able by a tine of" $50 or more.
The arbitrary powers tii us given to tlio
Health Orhcer are declared to be contrary
to constitutional law, and liKely to result
in an abuse of power, and it is possible
that the Town Trustees will be asked to
reconsider their ordinance. No -charge
has been made that the present Health
Officer, Dr. Rowell, has been guilty of un
due exercise of authority, but objectors to
the ordinance call attention to the fact
that such unreasonable display of power is
a possibility.
To Establish Kates.
BERKELEY, Cal., March s.â The Mas
ter Plumbers' Association of Berkeley
held an important meeting last evening, at
which they decided to co-operate more ef
fectually for their preservation and sell
interests. A blacklist of "deadheads" was
made out for the use of all local firms, and
hereafter no work will be done on credit
for those whose names appear on the list.
The society decided to tender a recep
tion and banque; to the officers of the
master plumbers' associations of San
Francisco. Oakland ar.d Alameda early in
April. The date and place was left to a
committee composed of Sanitary Inspector
Frank Thompson. Byron Underwood, J. J.
Menjes ana Al Hawes.
Petition to Sell Liquor.
BERKELEY, Cal., March s.â lt is re
ported that a petition signed by every
saloon-keeper in West Berkeley will be
presented to the town board at their next
meeting:. The petition requests that the
board grant J. J. Higgins a license to sell
liquor providing he pays $50 of Ihe $160
license fees which he would have paid had
he taken out a license at the lime the
board granted him the privilege of so
doing. Higgins refuses to state who has
joined him in the petition, but it is under
stood that he has secured signatures of the
majority of the West Berkeley liquor
dealers.

versity for the benefit of the Rosewald
memorial aid fund at the university. The

Studeutg' Gateway.
BERKELEY, Cal., March s.â Regent
Reinstein states that a temporary wooden
gateway will be erected at the new Center
street entrance to the university grounds,
to be known as tbe "Students' Gateway."
This will serve for the present, it being
hoped that a more pretentious and sub
stantial one will be erected at some time
in the near future.
The regent says that the cash valuation
of the work recently done by the students
on the campus, together with the dona
tions of various kinds, will aggregate at
leasi $5000.

Up To-Day.
The attendance of the delegates to the
third day's session of the American Pro
tective Association was as gooc as on the
two previous days. The fact that so many
members of the Superior Council wished
to see Washington, D. C, next May, wnen
the Supreme Grand Council will meet
there, was an incentive to the Californians
to remain at the State Council and try
tbeir luck with their friends to get suffi
cient votes to secure the offices of dele
gates.
After the disposal of some routine work
and the adjusting of &dme committee re
ports the convention resumed the labors
of electing the balance of the State officers.
For the office of grand sergeant-at-arms
J. E. Ha!l of Stockton was awarded the
honor of the baton, after a sharp contest
with ihree competitors.
To attend to the inner door during the
session of tne Grand Council H. W. Honn
of Shasta was elected.
Joseph McNeil of San Diego will guard
the outer door against any of the unini
tiated gaining admission.
For the office of trustees the followiug
three gentlemen will euard the valuables
of the Grand Council and also attend to
the financial branch of the order: A.
Peterson of Santa Cruz, M. Laidlaw of
Oakland and W. D. Kingsbury of San
Francisco.
For delegates to the Grand Supreme
Council there were twenty-live nominees
placed before the convention. Out of this
number the following were elected: G. G.
Baker and B. F. Hudelson of OaKland by
virtue of their offices as past and present
State presidents; G. E. Hayes, San Ber
nardino; Joseph Waldorp, Sonoma; W.
W. Knickerbocker. Oakland; H. W.
Mathews and W. S. A. Nicholson of San
Franciboo; \V. W. Rodehaver, Auburn; P.
Pearsun, Redlands; L. W. All'im, River
side; S. M. Androus, Pomona; W. 11. Nei
mier and Governor L. A. Sheldon, Los
Angeles; J. L. Gilbert, Fresno; D. D. Bow
man, Santa Cruz; H. V. Swain, Stockton,
and C. H. Darling, Sonoma.
A recess wns taken at 4:30 for the pur
pose of receiving the following named
ladies, who represented the executive com
mittee of the W. A. P. A.: Mrs. M. E.
Richardson, president; Mrs. L. A. Gunn,
secretary; Mrs. lea Killenberger, treasurer:
Mrs. \V. F. Barnes, Mrs. L. P. McCarthy,
Mrs. M. E. Stahl and Mrs. L. Fenton.
After an introduction by President Hudel
son an hour's time was devoted to short
speeches and an exchange of congratula
tions between the newly elected officers
and the lady members of the woman's
branch of the order.
After disposing of the election of officers
the convention resumed the regular order
of business and took up the consideration
of amendments to the constitution.
The session will resume its labors at 10
o'clock this forenoon.
Caricaturing Kxplained.
Spedon, the caricaturist, gave his initial
entertainment in this City last night at the Y.
M. C. A. auditorium.
He amused his audience with rapidly exe
cuted and evolved sketches of individuals and
landscapes, and he talked entertainingly all
the while, telling humorous incidents or ex
plaining the illustrator's art, the impression*
isfs method and the caricaturist's attempt to
portr&y character by exaggerating with a few
bold lines the most noticeable features of the
individual.
A Cyclist's^Mishap.
The bicycle races last night sent a man to the
hospital. R. (i. Harvey Downing of the Garden
City Bicycle Club was leading in the ten-mile
race and just as he was finishing his last lap
be fell and was thrown violently on his face.
He was taken to the .hospital, where it was
found that his nose was broken. He received
several other bad cuts.
ANOTHER G. A. H. BATTLE
Lyon Post Declares That De
partment Commander Wilson
Is in Error.
HAS EXCEEDED HIS AUTHORITY
Deny That He Has Power to Order
an Inquiry Into Charges Against
the Directors.
Oaklaxd Office San Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. \
Lyon Post No. 8, Grand Army of the Re
public, has named as a committee to ap
pear before the court of inquiry called by
Department Commander Wilson the fol
lowing members: George A. Norton, com
mander of Lyon Post; Senior Vice-Com
mander Richardson, George S. Naismith,
G. Hoguet, Major E. W. Woodward, E. P.
Daniels, J. B. Colqnhoun, R. C. J. Adney
and John A. Robinson.
The committee met last night, with all
members present, when it was announced
that G. S. Naismith had declined to serve
so that ex-Judge Gibson could be placed
on the committee. Judge Talcott and
General Thompson were also present.
The subject considered was the right
and authority of the department com
mander to call a court of inquiry to inves
tigate the charges of malfeasance in office
against the board of directors of the Sol
diers' Home at Yountville. It was finally
decided to deny the right of toe court to
inquire into the truth or falsity of the
charges, on the ground that the court of
inquiry was instituted without authority
of the rules in the G. A. R. Blue Book. If
this should be overruled the committee
will insist on a continuance to prepare
their side of the case.
The committee searched the Blue Book
through, but in vain, for authority dele
gating the department commander power
to convene a court of inquiry to seek the
truth or falsity of the charges in question.
These charges, it was shown, had been
made not against individuals as members
of the order, but as managers of a soldiers'
home, supported in part by money con
tributed by the State of California.
Attention wa3 called to the fact that
the charges, which were based on allega
tions and beliefs, closed with a request
for the Governor to investigate ana that
the G. A. R. annual encampment act on a
proposition to turn the home over to the
State.
This being the case it is alleged that
Lyon Post has not offended against any
law of the order and that tlie department
commander acted in an unwarranted man
ner when he undertook to forestall the ac
tion of Governor Budd by instituting an
inquiry into the methods in which the
home has been conducted. In further
support of their view of the case the mem
bers of Lyon Post say there ifl nothing to
be gained by this illegal course, because
Governor Budd has already signified his
willingness to investigate, and it is be
lieved will do so as soon as he returns
from the southern part of the StÂ£.te, which
wiil be in about ten days.
The haste with which it has been sought
to bring on this G. A. R. investigation has
caused the Lyon Post members to feel
that it lias done more with the view to
gratify the wishes of the members of
Thomas and Lincoln posts in San Fran
cisco than anything else. It is claimed
that those latter have intimated that Lyon
Post will be driven out of the department.
If it is a desire to try Lyon Post on a
technical offense under the G. A. R. law
for publishing the charges referred to it is
believed that there might be some ground
on which to make such a point, but there
is no such offense charged in the sum
mons.
Should such a charge be made against
Lyon Post, however, it is more than likely
that a similar charge could and would
be made against Lincoln and Thomas
posts in San Francisco, from each of which
organization resolutions and other docu
ments bearing on the subject have ap
peared in the public prints. It was per
haps for this reason that Lyon Post was
not called to answer on that score.
The nearest approach made by Lyon
| Post to a direct charge against the
G. A. K. or any of the order, it is t,aid, is
| the expression of a belief that Thomas
Post of San Francisco "has usurped the
control of the Veterans' Home, having
had most of the commandants, all the
treasurers, all the secretaries coining from
| the Grand Army and many other officials,
: while posts that have labored faithfully
j for the veterans have practically no voice
I in the management of the home."
But this charge is not referred to in the
| summons either, and for that reason the
members, of Lyon Post say that Thomas
Post does not want any further reference
I to the charge, which it is alleged may
! be easily demonstrated to be the truth.
| They say further that all they want is fair
| play.
They claim this Is a matter in which all
! the people of the State, and not merely the
1 friends of the directors of the Yountville
; Home, are interested. The charges should
! tnerefore be inquired into by State offi
! cialsâ the Governor, or by a disinterested
! board which the Governor may name.
One of the most interested parties to the
controversy went to Sacramento to-day to
seethe Attorney-General regarding the
j State interests.
Two years ago General Barnes submitted
! a minority report OB the management of
| the home to the State encampment that
â  created a sensation, as it severely criticized
! those in charge, but it was not accepted.
"This report or any copy of it is not to be
found now; they have all been called in,"
| said the general to-day in speaking of the
| matter.
OBJECT TO PICNICS.
j Grand Army Men Want the Spirit of
Memorial Day to Be Preserved.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. f
A meeting of Grand Army men and of
the Women's Relief Corps was held to
i night for the purpose of securing a suita-
I ble observance of Memorial day. Thacel
i ebration will be under the management of
| the permanent Memorial-day committee

There is a desire on the part of the old
soldiers and their wives and of many citi
| zeus to prevent the day being devoted to
i picnics and sports, as has been the case for
! several years past. The committee is
working with the idea of having the day
j preserved for exercises in conformity with

sued to carry out their intentions.

A TRAMP KILLED.
Third Victim of the Berkeley Local
Trains Within the Past Seven
Weeks.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 5.-George
Barnestead, the third victim of the Berke
ley local trains within the past seven
weeks, was killed to-night by the north
bound train between Bristol street and
University avenue at about 6:20 o'clock.
He was a tramp, between the age of 55
and 60 years, and was supposed to have
recently come from San Bernardino. He
was drunk at the time of the accident, and
it is thought that, on account of this ho
lost his life. He was standing on the track
as the train approached.
The engineer whistled first when within
about 200 yards of the man. He got off
the track, according to the engineer, and
staggered back toward it as the train drew
near. The engine passed him and he was
struck by the brakebeam of the fhst car.
The entire top of his head was taken off
and both arms were broken. The other
parts of his body remained uninjured.
Late this afternoon he was seen in Henry
Ostermann's saloon and was recognized by
W. A. and J. J. Nash, who knew him
while in San Bernardino. Barnestead se
cured several drinks at the saloon and
called for more, but they were refused
him. He then asked the way to San Fran
cisco and was si-en later by the Nash
brothers and Ostermann staggering down
the track. A few moments later the re
port came that he was killed. He was
roughly dressed and bore all the appear
ances of a hardened tramp.
SOME STUDIO GLIMPSES
The Arts and Crafts Guild Will
Hold a Novel Exhibi
tion.
It Is Proposed to Show the Public
How Pictures Are Really
Made.
The Guild of' Arts and Crafts has decided
to hold an exhibition in April which will
be entirely novel in character. Instead of
banging framed and glazed pictures ready
to suspend in a room the exhibition will
partake a little of the character of a studio
â nearly all the exhibits will be unframed
and many of the sketches will be uniin
ished.
The desire of the guild is to hold an ex
hibition which will not clash with the
spring show at the Art Institute, and after
considering several schemes it was finally
resolved that a sketch exhibition would be
novel as well as instructive.
Another thing that has been resolved
upon is that there shall be no jury to ac
cept or reject pictures at its ottn will or ca
price.
The members of the guild say they do
not want anything or any one to "boss"
the coming exhibition, and in pursuance
of this plan, even committee work in con
nection with the affair will be curtailed as
much as possible.
Each artist belonging to the guild will
be assigned a certain space, and it will be
his duty to see that it is hlled. He may
hang his own work or any one else's he
pleases, but he will be considered respon
fciDie for the character of work exhibited
in his own section, and woe betide him if
on the varnishing day his space is iound
to consist of empty walls.
It is believed that the exhibition of
sketches will encourage artists to bring
studies, old and new, out of their studios.
If a picture is only just sketched it may be
hung, for people who are not in the habit
of painting themselves or visiting studios
wiii iearn from the sketch how artists set
to work to make a picture, and it is in
tended that the coming exliibhion shall
let the public nave a peep behind the
scenes of studio work.
There is an illusion, so say the artists,
among good well-meaning people who
know nothing about art, that all a painter
has to do is to think out a subject, sketch
it in, slap his colors on the canvas and
have a picture as the result of his labors.
The arts and crafts guild says it means to
show the public a thing or two about how
an artist goes to work to paint pictures.
Paintings will be shown and beside them
will be all' the drawings and studies made
to reach the final compositions. One art
ist will show an open-air picture and be
side it will be six months' preliminary
work, in the way of studies of foreground,
background, middle distance, trees, grass,
logs, etc.
More sketches will show how these
sketches were welded together till the de
sired composition was finally reached and
the picture itself was begun.
The members of the guild say that after
going to the coming exhibition no one
will harbor the delusion that pictures are
mere hand work, painted according to
rules learned at school. They pledge
themselves to show how much hard work
there is in a picture, arid they will also let
the public see that a good deal more paint
is wasted than appears on the canvas. In
fact, they have undertaken the task of
proving that a good picture means a good
deal more in labor and thought than the
paint on the canvas and the man's time in
laying it on.
In order that the exhibition may not be
too didactic there will be a number of
finished pictures in addition to the
sketches, and studies of half-completed
paintings, but the charm of novelty will
really lie in the exhibition of the unfinished
work. It is believed mat at the last some
of the painters will shrink from exposing
their uncompleted work to the cold criti
cism of the world, and for these retiring
ones a 100 Dhole of escape has been left by
allowing any artist to fill his space with
finished and framed work if he chooses to
do so.
At the same time there is a good deal of
talk about "yanking" the works out of the
studios by force, and hanging them, des
pite the owners' protests, it all the walls
of the exhibition are not fully covered by
the beginning of next month.
The place for holding the sketch exhibit
has not yet been fully decided upon,
though it will probably be chosen in the
course of the next week or ten days.
Suicide With Carbolic Acid.
Mrs. Celia Reci, living at 16 Rich street,
committed suicide last. night about 10 o'clock
by drinking carbolic acid. Her husband, who
was absent at the time, found her dead in her
room when he returned. No reason for the
act is known. She was 3U years old and a na
tive of New York. The remains are at the
Morgue.
Delegates Elected.
At a meeting of Mission Parlor No. 38, N. S.
G. W., held last night, after a sDirited contest
John Porchar. past president, Senator Eugene
F. Bert, Dr. James A. Black and Adam L. Karl

ANDREE AND HIS BALLOON.
Geographic Society Takes Steps to
Advise Northern Stations to Look
for the Air Ship.
The council of the Geographical Society
of the Pacific met yesterday afternoon at
the office of Professor George Davidson, its
president.
The business for which it was called was
discussed at length â that of presenting the
facts of the Jeannette relics, as they were
known to the members in San Francisco,
to the Royal Geographical Society of
Copenhagen. The council decided to in
trust the matter to Professor Davidson
and to Henry Lund. They will draw up a
paper reciting the facts and include with it
the paper concerning them by the Gover
nor of Greenland recently published.
The council also decided to prepare a
circular concerning the balloon expedition
to the north pole to be undertaken in
July by Professor Andree.
The circular will be sent to all the north
ern stations on the North Pacific coast and
to ail the Siberian ports that may be
reached by vessels from Pacific Coast
ports.
The circular will give advice as to the
character of the expedition and advise the
recipients to spread the news and ask that
a lookout be kept for the balloon, and if
sighted to afford assistance to the voya
gers.
Professor Davidson stated that he had
not received the papers from Washington
that he is expecting by every mail, and
was, therefore, not prepared to bring the
matter of the expedition to locate ibe
north magnetic pole formally before the
council. He will call a meeting for the
purpose as soon as his plans are in shape.
Adjuster Eckstein Arrested.
A. B. Eckstein, an adjuster and "spotter" on
the Market-street Railway, was arrested last
night on the charge of petty larceny. He lived
at 311 Turk street, ana was accused of stealing
his landlady's gold watch, handkerchiefs and
a pair of gloves.
Policeman F. B. Gibson found a pawn ticket
for the watch in Eckstein's pocket. The pris
oner was one of the defendants in the infamous
polltax swindles about nineteen years ago, and
the only one among them to be acquitted by
the jury. _____________

on the lookout for anything that tends to
improve the tone of this grand sport, has
had starting gates placed at all of the
principal starting posts, and some other
innovations will be introduced in the near
future.
The favorites played in what might be
termed "hard luck"'throughout the day,
but two winning purses. Most of the
winners, though, were well played in the
betting.
The opening event was a four-turlone
spin for tne two-year-olds, with Mary X
starting a 2 to 1 favorite. The filly
evidently did not like the going, for she
wad unplaced. Gordon at fives in the bet
ting made most of the running, winning
rather handily from Vevo. The second
choice, Ingleside, was third.
McNaugoton & Muir's bay colt Basso
again gave the talent a hard "throw
down" in the mile-and-a-quaner selling
event. A. world of coin went into the
books on him at 4 to 5. but aiter running
under restraint in fourth position until
Hearing the stretch Chorn made his ride,
but was unable to head the 10 to 1 chance
Collins, who led from the jump, and was
beaten a length in the slow time of 2:15^.
The *:rowd took another hard header on
the seven-furlone run. Ed Kearney was
the post favorite at 9to 5. Opening at Bto
5, Vinctor receded to 13 to 5, when he was
backed down atain to 2to 1. Followed by
Sir Vassar, the 100 to 1 shot Salisbury II
headed the field to the stretch, when Sir
Ya;?Bar took the lead and, ridden out, won
by two lengths from Wyomine. with the
favorite in the show. The winner was as
good as 8 to 1 in the betting.
The mile hurdle race added still more to
the discomfiture of the talent. At Red
Will's first essay some days ago over the
sticks he showed to be such a promising
candidate that after opening at 8 to 5 he
was backed down to 11 to 10. Later he
went back in the betting to 7 to 5 from the
force of a strong play on Uncertainty and
My Luck. The favorite was In the lead
up to the last jump, where he swerved
sideways and nearly fell. My Luck, who
was second, then took command and won
easily. In a drive Arundel headed the
first choice out for the place.
Five speedy sprinters went to the post
in the fifth event a six-furlong selling
sprint. Th 3 bulk of the money went in on
Major Cook, who closed an 8 to 5 choice,
and Gallant backed down from 6 to 4.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
Derfargilla and Mobalasca receded from
their opening prices. Derfnrgilla and the
40 to 1 shot Boreas headed the bunch
until nearing the stretch, where the pair
was joined by Mobalasca. Derfargilla here
had enough, and the Corrigan entry easily
outfooted the outsider, beating him out a
| couple of lengths. The favorite was a
good third.
Eighteen selling-platers lined up fora
five-furlong scramble that was next up for
decision. Shieldbearer looked the most
eligible of the lot, and wns backed down
from Bto 5 to 6 to 5. With Artist, the
second choice, at his heels the pair led the
field from the start, the first choice getting
past the wire first by a scant length.
The concluding number on the pro
gramme was another tive-furlonir dash
with eleven starters. Opening la the bet
ting at 8 to 5 Philomena recedei to threes
when she was backed down to 13 to 5, going
to the post equal choice with Pat Murphy,
whose odds had been forced from 5
to 1. The race was one of the prettiest of
the day. Philomena, Toano and Service
set a merry clip to the stretch, wnere Phil
omena cried quits. Below the furlong pole
Toano was beaten. Coady now brougrt
Pat Murphy along and in a drive won
from Service by half a length. Mt. Mc-
Gregor II came fast, finishing a good third.
Track and Paddock Items,
Nearly 3000 ladies viewed the racing yes
terday.
The board of stewards decided to reject
the entry of Carmel in future. The sulk
ing chestnut was left at the post in the
mile and a quarter event.
Riley Grannan started in the day well
by backing both Gordon and Collins, but
dumped the greater part of his winnings
back into the ring over the defeat of
Vinctor, which horse ran a most disap
pointing raco.
Hermann Brandt, who formerly owned
Braw Scot, has a number of fine-looking
Martenburst two-year-oldÃ in training at
Sacramento, o*ned by the estate of the
deceased millionaire turfman, Simeon G.
Reed.
The Westchester stable's geld'ng, Cole
man, a starter in the last race, experienced
one of his ugly moods and on the way to
the post started to run away with little
Reidy, finally ending it up by jumping
the outside fence and galloping up among
the stables. The field was dispatched
without i.ma.
When put up to be soli, Collins, the
winner of the second race, entered to be
sold for $200, was bid up to $!>OO by Book
maker Ed Games, his owner, Dr. H. E.
Rowell, retaining the brown gelding with
the usual $5 bid. The reason of the
"boost" it is.said dates hack to a trifle over
one year ago, when Dr. Rowell bid up and
secured the horse Figaro at the conclu
sion of his victory in the Peaboay Hotel
selling stake a*. "MemphÃ Term". The
racer was owned by "Billy" Barrick, an
inornate friend of the pencilers, who was
simply returning tit for tat.
Major Cook has either deteriorated or
else Borens is a preariy improved horse.
The favorite was rather easy game for the
outsider yesterday.
STATE MILITIA.
Sweeping Reduction in the Xmnerlca
Strength of the First Regiment.
Other Changes.
By the issuance of regimental order:
No. 6 from headquarters First Kccirnent oj
Infantry, N\ G. C, some of the effects o
the recent attempts at reorganization an
becoming apparent. This order discharge:
ninety-six members of the regiment fo:
various causes, which is more than one
twelfth of the numerical strength of thi
regiment, the heaviest losses being in thÂ«
consolidated companies, as follows: Com
pany A, made no of companies A and Â£
of the Third, losing eleven men; Companj
B, made up of companies B and D of th<
Tnird, losing eleven men; Company H,
made up of companies B and F of th(
Third, losing twenty-three men, and Com
pany M, made of companies G and H Oi
the Second, losing twenty-two men.
The order also approve* the findings and
sentence in the case of Private Walter E.
Cook of Company E, who was tried by
summary court-martial.
It is now stated that companies F and
X will remove from their present quarters
in the regimental armory on Pa^e street
to the armory on Ellis street, thus leaving
eight companies at the Page-street armory
and four at the Ellis-street armory.
Some time ago this announcement was
made and the captains of these companies
commenced to make.arrangements to re
move to the Eilis-street'arraory, but this
was stopped, apparently under orders from
headquarters, it beirn: announced that the
regiment would have to be concentrated
in one armory.
At the same time the companies located
on Market street received orders to removt
to the Page-street armory, and upon theii
objecting upon the ground of insufficient
accommodations, their otTicers were in
formed that there was ample accommo la
tion for all, and that they would have tc
comply, it being the intention of the board
of location to concentrate the command in
one place as soon as practicable.
The proposed removal of companies F
and X must therefore mean that either the
board of location has found it impractica
ble to locate all the companies in one
building, and therefore reconsiders its.in
atructions, or that these companies are at
tempting to carry out their original inten
tion of moving, which was only temporar
ily deferred, although the Signal Corps
was directed to move for the purpose o:
obtaining sufficient room to house tin
companies of ttie regiment.

GHASTLY DENS
IN CHINATOWN.
Where the Dying and the

Views of Some Chinese Under
takers' Shops.
Chinatown has a dark, tragic picture
upon which the white light ol publicity
has never before been Hashed. It is so
dark, so ghastly in its details that the
most daring Chinatown guide never dares
show it to bis best patrons, or to those

"On one ride was a coffin and on either side were trestle beds, one of which contained a Kick man, almost within touch of the corpse."
least inclined to be astonished by the ordi
nary shadowy pictures of the Mongolian
labyrinths.
It is that kind of a picture which de
â lands adjectives in its description, and no
adjective synonymous with ghastly, hor
rible, awful will be too strong for its de
tails.
It is the picture |of the dying and the
dead huddled side by side in one room,
and that a room of filth and gloom and
squalor, a room of ghosts and grinning
skeletons, of rotting human flesh ana tor
turing souls of men suffering more ago
nies before death than Dante conjured up
for the lost souls after death.
These are the Chinatown morgues, or
hospitals, and deadhouses combined. They
are little rooms at the end of long, foul
alley?, where those who are dead and
those who are dying lie together until
their friends ship their dry bones back to
China for burial. Tnere are several of
these places in Chinatown. Primarily
they are Chinese undertakers, but those
who are dying and poor are hauled there
as soon as they become helpless and left
alone in the chamber of horrors until they,
too, become corpses.
Aside from the gruesome horrors of
these dens, there is also a Banitary con
sideration involved. Christian people
will shudder at the inhumanity of the
spectacle, and perhaps steps will be taken
to lesson the tortures of the dying Chinese
pauper.
But if human sympathy and sentiment
should not be strong enough there is the
sanitary aspect of the case, which cries
aloud for the abatement of such a nuisance
as the Chinatown pesthouses. The Board
of Health should act, and doubtless will
when the whole truth is known to them.
The Call has had the matter carefully
and thoroughly investigated by one of the
best authorities on Chinatown in the City.
Highest of all in Leavening Power. â Latest U. S. Gov't Report
. â '"â¢â ' ABSOLUTELY PURE .
The gentleman is well known for his char
itable work, especially in the Chinese
quarter, and it is merely for the sake of
not retarding his usefulness in this direc
tion that his name is omitted here.
It may be obtained, however, by any
City official or member of the Board of
Health who doubt the correctness of the
facts as stated. Recently this pentleman,
accompanied by a Call reporter, made a
tour of Chinatown for the purpose of lo
cating and visiting these "Chambers of
Tranquility," as the denizens of the quar
ter call them. The report of their investi
gations is given in the former's words as
follows:
It is time the attention of the Board of
Health was called to those chambers of hor
rors on Pacific street, euphemistically called
Tai Peng Fongâ "chambers of tranquil
ity." Of all the abominations of pesti
lence-breeding holes in that malodor
ous quarter these charnel-houses, are
the climax. No wonder a Chinaman buries
his face in his sleeve and gets a move on
as he passes by at night. He smell ghosts.
We visited these ghoulish hovels a few days
ago. Passing down Jackson street we stopped
to watch a sick Chinaman being carried out of
a basement and dumped with ail his belong
ings into an express- wagon.
"Wha' fo' so fashion?"' I inquired of the
Chinese inmates, already beaming with satis
faction at having rid themselves of a disagree
able burden.
"Oh," said one fellow, "he alia same trump,
he no b'long my take care, send 'in to hospi
tal." We pondered awhile over this reply. A
hospital in Chinatown! Where could it be?
Whoever heard of such a place? The driver
whipped up his horse, and the wagon started
off at a quick pace, the poor wretch inside
vainly endeavoring to steady himself while
being rattled over the rough cobblestones.
Only a Chinese tramp.
Rattle lils bones over the atones,
He's only a pauper that nobody owns."
Curious to know where this so-called Chinese
hospital was situated, we started off on a run
to follow the wagon. It halted near the Chi
nese undertaker's, Man Fook On, at 724 Pacific
street. The poor dying heathen w<is yanked
out of the wagon and carried up a narrow
passage and into a room tn the rear of the un
dertaker's shop. The stench that greeted our
nostrils as the door opened was simply sicken-
ing. It was a smell suggestive of decomposing
human flesh and musty bones. The wagon
quickly deposited its burden and hurried off.
We pushed our way into the dismal den. A
mummy-faced object >ili.nkf><l in the light of
the open door and evidently objected to our
visit. The sick man wns Leung Ah Suey, a
Hoy Ping man. Mid this was the deadhouse of
the Hop 'Won Company. On one side was a
coffin and on either side were trestle beds, one
of which contained the sick man, almost
within touch of a corpse. We lighted a candle
that was on the table and lifted the coffin
lid with a flesh creeping Bensation. Inside
was a dead Chinaman, his face as black
ss a coal. The coffin was stuffed with paper
clothes and other articles supposed to be
needed by the deceased in the world of shades.
The adjoining room was filled with boxes con
taining tne bones of Chinese belonging to the
Hop Woh Company that had been exhumed in
different burial grounds, some having come
from the Eastern States nil scraped, washed,
sorted and labeled ready for shipment to
China, where they would receive proper inter
ment in the sopulcher* of their fathers, and
where those Buddhist and Taoist masses would
be said and sacrifices offered to 6ecure their
peace in the other world.
Some imaginative Chinese boys declare they
can hear these bones rattle every midnight.
Several other charnel-houses were in the same
alley, the one ne~t door south belonging to the
King Yeung Company and one next door north
belonging to the Kong Chan Company. These
other doors were locked, but judging from the
stench that poured through a broken window
of the Kong Chou ossuary worse horrors were
inside than those already described.
In the basement of the undertaker's on Pa
cific street was another row of these "chambers
of peace." Several coffins were here, and
amidst scenes of death was another sick man
groaning upon a bed. An old woman kept the
place, who made her living by waiting upon
the sick and acting as a professional wailer
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 1896.
over the dead, her lamentations being regn
lated by the amount of money paid her. Far
ther up the street, at 740 Pacific street, was
the deadhouse of the Van Woh or Hakka Com
pany, where a great hullabaloo was going on.
A dead Chinaman was being boxed up while
a Taoist priest was droning forth his liturgies.
On the floor surrounding the coffin were flam
ing wax tapers and several plates of sacrificial
meats, including rice, chicken and a crab,
offered to appease the dead man's ghost.
At 742 Pacific street was another deadhouse,
bearing the eign Tseng Yeonjj Bbo
or "Quiet Nursing Place" of the
?eonÂ« Wah Company. Here again was
the tame dismal hole of squalor, with
beds for the dying and coffins for the dead.
Dying Chinese who have no friends to take
care of them are invariably brought to these
horrible abodes to breathe their last breath,
lonely and forsaken. As long as a Chinaman
is likely to recover, his clansmen will provide
him with bud and food and medical at
tendance in the homes of the living.
But woe to the patient who is without
blood relations. When the native doctor gives
him up. the news spreads. The landlord and
fellow-tenants get alarmed and clamor for his
removal. The room of a dying Chinaman is
supposed to be filled with devils; the tables
and chairs and beds utter mysterious sounds,
which fill the superstitious mind with horror.
There arc certain ceremonies which are said to
drive oft' these diabolical visitors, but they
cost money, and no one will go to this ex
pense on behalf of a stranger. The landlord is
alarmed at the prospect of a general exodus of
his tenar.ts and an empty, haunted house on
his hands. A death happening in his rooms
is sufficient to put his house in ceremonial
quarantine for twelve months. Tne dying man
must be packed off. Where? No hospital in
San Francisco will take him in.
A few years ago the Chinese merchants
raised a lnrge fund to erect a hospital. Plans
were drawn up and submitted to the City
authorities, but for some reason the Chinese
were not permitted to build. Large sums of
money are subscribed by missionary societies
to erect hospitals in China, but there is
no place in the Christian City of San
Francisco where a sick and friendless China
man can breathe his last, except among
coffins and boxes of bones in a Chinese char
nel-house. In some cases they are dumped
into these hideous "chambers of peace 1 ' and
left to die unattended, except a peep now and
then to see when life is extinct. If money is
paid to an attendant to provide gruel for the
dying man it is safe to say that it goes
into the pocket of the hardened rasral, who
spends little time with his charge. Is tnis
stranee? What sensible human being would
think of living half an hour in sucli a death
laden atmosphere? And so the poor wretches
groan and gasp out their miserable lives un
attended and uncomforted. But a Chinaman
has his hopes. He Has no haunting fears of
the great unknown. Resignation is stamped
upon his face. There are good times ahead.
Already the fumes of roast pork and chicken
reach his nose, and soon his ghost shall feed
on the fat of the land. Neglected, and often
brutally treated while life is ebbing away,
his manes will be worshipped to-morrow.
Already the burial sacrifices, paper clothes and
money, are being got ready for poor Leong.
The Six Companies, with a benevolence
which we occidentals do not appreciate, pro
vide for these sacrifices. They cannot be ne
glected. When the unfed ghost of a dead
Chinaman goes on the rampage he simply
raises Cain. Smallpox, fevers and all sorts of
calamities are brought about by unpro
pitiated ghost;. So, after all, the dead pauper
car. be revenged in that sweet by-and-by when
he becomes a god. This is all very well for the
dead Chinaman, but meanwhile what can the
Board of Health do to protect us from pes
tilence while these fetid charnel-houses are al
lowed to remain in the heart of the City?

THE BATTLE FOR
CLEAN POLITICS
Defeat for the Railroad
Forgers and Tricksters
Appears.
MAHONEY REPUDIATED.
The Fourth District Committee
Will Meet and Organize
at Once.
MEMBERS ON THEIR POLICY.
The Victory of John D. Spreckels
Wins Him Many Adherents
and Congratulations.
The regular Congressional committee of
the Fourth District, elected night beiore
last by the votes of seven of the eleven
members of the State Central Committee
representing that district, will meet for or
canization to-day or to-morrow and will
then proceed to formulate a plan for the
primary election for delegates to the State
Convention.
Meantime, the executive committee of
the State Central Committee will hold a
meeting. A call for "an important meet
ing" of the committee to be held at the
rooms of the State Central Committee at 8
p. M. to-day, has been issued by Chairman
P.B.Cornwall. The specific purposes of
the meeting have not been stated, but it
is supposed that some measures relating to
the Fifth and Fourth Congressional
districts will be offered.
The machinations of the railroad politi
cians are becoming more clearly apparent
in the affairs of the Fourth District espe
cially. It was the railroad influence that
manipulated the underhand proceedings
which resulted in the snap meeting of Sat
urday night in the private rooms of
Senator J. H. Mahoney in the Baldwin
Hotel at which, wiih the aid of a forged
proxy, a Congressional committee pre
pared beforehand was named as the com
mittee which should represent the Repub
licans of the Fourth District, and control
the State interests of the Republican party
in that district.
This railroad Bcheme has already re
ceived its death blow by the revelation of
the forgery of the proxy of GusLave Mel
sing, which gave the necessary majority,
and by the attendant revelations of the
tricky manner in which the meeting was
called by Senator Mahoney and Martin
Keily. arid the cut-am 1-dried programme
which was carried through by a vote of
six to four.
A majority of the Republicans of the
City who have no sympathy or patience
with Martin Kelly politics, and who are
not ready to recognize the right of Martin
Kelly, Senator Mahoney and others of
their type to control the "party in the in
terests of the railroad company, have al
ready repudiated as far as they might the
snap proceedings of last Saturday night.
They recognize the legality, fairness and
decency of the meeting and action of a
majority of the State Central Committee
of night before last; the fact that the com
mittee then created is the only one which
has a legal standing in the party organiza
tion; that it is representative of the lie
publicans of the whole district, and that
it was appointed and will act in the inter
ests of clean politics, fairness to all Repub
licans and party harmony.
The disgraceful forgery of Gustave Mel
sing's proxy last Saturday night, an un
scrupulous political trick of the sort sol
<lom practiced in planes above the conten
tions of district primary politics, will uot
clown. The criminal trick was perpetrated
by men assuming initial control of the
National Republican political interests of
the Fourth Congressional District. The
fact that the majority necessary for the
appointment of a committee was secured
through this foreery is a clear-cut tiling
that will remain the chief feature of the
history of that snap meeting of Saturday
night.
Jacob Snaten, who was induced to attend
the meeting and vote the proxy of Mr.
Melsing provided for him, now vigorously
repudiates his share of the proceedings on
the ground that he voted the proxy inno
cently, accepting without knowledge or
question the assertion that it was all right.
He has since learned of the forgery and
yesterday declared that he was made the
victim of a small and dirty political trick,
and that he was innocently made the tool
of others.
The regular Fourth District Congres
sional Committee, composed of Nicholas
Ohlandt, Louis Pockwitz, George Rode,
C. C. Bemis, R. Rasmussen, F. Arata and
Henry Leffmann, will meet for organiza
tion to-day or to-morrow. Yesterday the
members of the committee received the
following notice of appointment signed by
Thomas C Duff, chairman of the meeting
of the members of the State Central Com
mittee from the Fourth District:
San Francisco, March 5, 1896.
You are hereby notified that at a regular
meeting of the members of the Republican
State Central Committee for the Fourth Con
gressional District, held on March 4, 1890, in
pursuance of the resolution of the Republican
.Slate Central Committee adopted at its regular
meeting on the 29th day oi February, 1896,
for the purpose of selecting the com
mittee of seven persons resident in said
Fourth Congressional District in whom should
be vested the powers and duties provided for
in said resolution, you were duly and regularly
selected and appointed as one of the said com
mittee of seven persons and in-vested with the
aforesaid powers and duties; and you are fur
ther hereby notified that the other members of
said commutes selected and appointed to act
and serve as your col leaeues thereon are the
following-named gentlemen, viz: Lonis Pock
witz, George Rode, C. C. Bern is, K. Rasmussen,
F. Arata arid Henry Lefferman.
C. 0. Bemis of this committee, well
known as a leadine Montgomery-street
real estate man, said yesterday that he
would accept the appointment.
"i consider it an honor to represent the
Republicans in 9ucli a capacity in a year
so full of hope and importance to tho
party as this one," he said, "and I shall
certainly perform the duties devolving
upon me with a spirit befitting the office.
"I certainly have no doubts about the
lepality and authority of the committee of
which I am a member, and few fair
minded Republicans whoso minds and
consciences" rise above the political
methods which have come to be caHed
'Buckley methods' could have any such
doubts. My only interest is to see the
affairs of the party conducted with fair
ness, decency ana succees, and I know
that such is the spirit of this committee.
"I shall be very much disappointed if
the committee does not rise a little above
the plane of petty political tricks and con
duct the affairs of the party intrusted to it
in a broad, honest and* dignified way
which will win the respect and confidence
of the community and conserve the high
est and best interests of the party."
Louis Pockwitz, another member of the
committee, has not recently been as prom
inent in political affairs as he was. some
years ago when he served several terms as
a member of the County Committee, but
he is an old, well known and respected
business man and Republican.
"I have not conferrea with any other
members of the committee," said Mr.
Pockwitz last evening, "and so can say
nothing as to any action the committee
may be likely to take, but I will say that
what I want to see is the party
harmonized and successful. The trouble
now is that a few men are trying to
run the party in the interests of the rail
road and boodle. They are getting Mar
tin KÂ«lly to help them. ' I've known that
man twenty-five years, and I know that
he has always been an unprincipled
loafer and a trickster. lam sure that this
committee will do anything it can do
honestly and fairly to produce harmony
and to give every voter in the party an
equal voice and vote in its affairs."
It was intimated yesterday by friends of
Senator Mahoney and Martin Keily that
the proxy of Supervisor E. C. Hughes,
voted by John T. Dare at the meeting
night before last at 850 Market street, was
not entirely regular itself. Mr. Hughes
put an effective quietus on those indefi
nite hints.
â¢'Yes, I gave my proxy to John T. Dare,"
he declared last evening, "and 1 am sure
he made proper use of it. All I know
about the proceedings of the meeting I
have learned from the papers, and Ido
not care to discuss the situation, but I cer
tainly would not give my proxy to any
body whom I could not trust to make
proDer uso of it. I gave my proxy in good
faith, I believe it was voted in good faith,
and everything is all right as Jar as I am
concerned."
The victory of John D. Spreckels in be
half of political decency and over the rail
road tricksters has won for him many new
political friends, many congratulations
and many new supporters of his political
leadership. On the other hand, many
Republicans interested in the success and
good name of the party have this week
renounced and condemned the factional
manipulators whose methods have been
so early exposed and who have started in
to drag the local party through the mire
to C. P. Huntington's feet.
Thomas W. Chandler of the Forty-fifth
district was one who yesterday reversed
his political affiliations, condemned the
methods of the railroad faction and gave
his adherence to the methods and prin
ciples advocated by John D. Spreckels.
IN THE THIRD DISTRICT.
Commltteemen Will Meet tn This
City Saturday to Decide on
Procedure.
Oakland Office Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. f
The new Third Congressional District
Committee will meet next Saturday in
San Francisco to decide whether or not
primaries shall be called or whether ward
clubs shall appoint the delegates. The
new committee was appointed by the
State committeemen from the various
counties, who concluded that there was no
Congressional district committee in exist
ence and so they appointed themselves.
There is rnnch doubt as to what became of
the last comm ittee. According to some a
resolution was passed at the last district
convention deciding that the chairmen of
the different county committees should
constitute the Congressional committee
for the purpose of preserving its existence
till itsiservices should be again required.
There was some doubt as to whether
this applied to the individual chairmen
or was intended to apply to their suc
cessors. Several of the county commit
tees were reorganized and the Congres
sional committee was lost sight of. Dur
ing his last campaign Hilborn appointed
an auditing committee, in accordance with
the purity of election law, and this was
the only committee known to be in exist
ence. This was ignored by the State Cen
tral committeemen from the Third District,
and they appointed "themselves. This is
the view taken by Editor Frank A. Leach,
but he is not certain of the meaning or
scope of the resolution appointing the
county chairmen.
.The new committee met after the State
Central Committee last Saturday and ap
pointed E. K. Taylor of Alameda as
chairman and Senator Guy C. Earl as sec
retaiy. It was decided not to discuss
whether or not a primary should be called,
as there was not a full attendance, so an
adjournment was taken to Senator Earl's
office, 532 Market street, when the ques
tion will De decided.
George Morrow, one of the com mittee
men, was seen to-night at Temescal. "So
far as we know," said Committee man Mor
row, "there was not any Congressional
committee in the Third District. If there
is one there is not the slightest possibility
of it making any opposition in the face of
the action taken last Saturday. There is a
difference of opinion about the calling of
primaries, some want them and others
do not. I favor open primaries
for this county, but I do not
know how my colleagues stand. Some
of the committeemen may desire that
the ward clubs appoint the delegates, and
it will probably be left to the discretion of
the State committeemen in each county.
There is absolutely no dispute as to the
legality of our existence as the Third Con
gressional District Committee. I might
say, also, that I do not think we shall
again nominate Mr. Hilborn."

Kiiring ray many years of public service I as
sure you I have never received any communi
cation which has afforded me so much pleas
ure and encouragement, and, coming from one
who has been so thoroughly identified with re
form work in our City as you, your words of
confidence in my administration aud the
effective aid you and yours have received from
the Police Department in your labors in rela
tion to the work of reform now in hand are
such as not only encourage an official in the
discharge of his duties, but they, moreover,
tend to smooth the roughness met with in the
paths of the journey of life.
In conclusion, I desire to assure you that my
endeavors in the future, whether in an official
capacity or that of a citizen, shall always be
on the'side of good* government; and at all
times do not hesitate to call on me for assist
ance in the work of you and your associates.
If at any time such assistance should not be
as effectual as should be desired, I will deem it
a favor if you will communicate with me, and
if it is within the possibilities the remedy will
be applied to your entire satisfaction.
Again thanking you for your kind words of
sympathy, confidence and encouragement, I
remain, very respectfully,
P. Crowlky, Chief of Police.

THE FAST CYCLE RACERS.
All the Speedy Men Compete at
the Pavilion Tourna
ment.
AN IMMENSE AUDIENCE.
Wells and Edwards Won the Mile
Events, and the Ten-Mile Was
a Dead Heat.
The great seven-days' indoor bicycle
racing tournament and cycle show opened
last night at the Mechanics' Pavilion, and
if the attendance at the opening night is
any criterion of the success of the meet, it
is assured. The stands and galleries were
packed with spectators, and in the aisles
and around the various cycle exhibits one
had to move slowly or not at all.
The races were run off witn a snap and
vim which reflected great credit on the
riders and the officials who had charge of
them.
Nearly all of the exhibits were in place
last night, and most of them are remark
able for the taste and elegance displayed
m fixtures and decorations. There are all
sorts of bicycles displayed, from a single
to a six-seater, the latter attracting as
much attention as a prize racer at a horse
show.
In the handling of the races there was
little to be wished for. The timing was
perfect, the starting and judging good, and
Announcer Knapp, with his immense
white "knapaphone," or speaking trumpet,
was vory much in evidence.
A great deal of enthusiasm attended the
running of the races. All the clubs were
there in full force, and as their respective
riders won a heat or a race they would
give their club yells with a vim which
insured sore throats this morning. The
Acme and Reliance clubs of Oakland, the
Bay Citys, Olympics, Garden Citvs, Cali
fornias. Imperials, Ban Franciscos, Libertys
and other smaller clubs were present en
masse and vied with each other in the
loudness of their calls ana enthusiasm.
There were a great many ladies in the
audience, all of whom seemed to have
favorites among the racers, and those who
did not chose the one most to their liking,
and applauded his efforts by waving their
kerchiefs energetically.
The first of several high-grade bicycles
offered by the management of the tourna
ment as gate prizes was won by the holder
of ticket 1875.
The first race of the evening was the
mile invitation, divided into four heats,
the first in each heat to qualify for the
final. The first heat came near resulting
in a great upset for the favorite, Charles S.
Weils, the 200-pound champion of the Bay
City Wheelmen. He had the pole up to
the sixth lap, when Russell Cushinsj, a San
Jose flyer, spurted to the front and it was
nip and tuck between them to the tape,
where Wells barely won, amid sjreat ap
plause, in the fast time of 2 minutes 32
seconds.
in the second heat Hardy Downing of
the Garden Citys, R. H. Long of the Bay
Citys and W. W. N'eedham of the Olym
pics started. They exchanged setting
pace all the way and fought it out at the
finish, Downing winning by several yards,
Long second, Needham third. Time, 2
mins. 35 3-5 sees.
T. A. Griffiths, Hay City; F. M. Byrne,
Imperial, and H. W. Squires, Accrue, start
ed in the third heat. There was a great
surprise in store for the crowd at the fin
ish, for every one familiar with the abili
ties of the men thought the race lay either
with Griffiths or Byrne; but Squires out
spurted tuem both at the finish, winning
handily in 2:24.
There were three men in the third and
last heat â William Yeoman, Reliance;. J.
E. Edwards, Olympic, and N. Ackerman,
San Francisco Road Club. The heat was
won by Yeoman, who barely beat out Ed
wards right at the tape. The time was
2:28 3-5.
There were over thirty entries for the
mile scratch, open, and the race was
divided into nine heats and three semi
finals, not more than three or four start
ing in each heat. G. H. Crafts of the
Acme Club won the first in 2:34. Frank
M. Byrne, the pride of the Imperial Club,
took "the second heat easily in 2:32 1-5.
The third heat went to E. Languetin, Bay
City. Time, 2:412-5.
There were four starters in the fourth
heath, and J. E. Edwards of the Olympics
passed his three competitors at the finish,
winning in 2:35 1-5. The fifth went to
Charles M. Goodwin, San Francisco Road
Club, in 2:24 4-5. He surprised the crowd
by beating C. If. Smith, Garden City, and
S. B. Vincent, Bay City, who were picked
for first and second places, respectively.
H. B. Freeman, Bay City, had tnings
about his own way in the sixth heat and
won it in 2:31 2-5. In the seventh heat
Tony Delmas of the Garden City Club
came first, but he had to work hard for it,
as his competitors pressed him hard at the
finish. The time was 2:43.
The eighth heat brought out a trio of
crack sprintersâ Wells and Hall, the Bay
City fliers, and Yeoman, whom the Re
liance Club men look upon as their best
man. They alternated pace all the way,
and in a beautiful sprint at the -finish
Wells won out, beating the others only by
inches. The Bay City contingent in the
grandstands went wild over their favorite's
victory. Wells' time was 2 :4l 3-5.
George W. Tantau, Olympic, took the
ninth heat in 2:40 4-5 after a very pretty
contest with T. L. Alborelle and N. Acker
man.
To give the riders a chance to rest, and
as a pleasing variety, the management
next put on two Chinese races, distance
unlimited and names of riders unknown,
though Announcer Knapp stated they
were One Lung, Hop Sine and Chew Gum
in the first heat. They were far from in
experienced, and thÂ« winner. Chew Gum,
made the mile in 2:45. The race was very
amusing, and kept the spectators in roars
of laughter.
There were two in the second race, Pitty
Sing and "Rain-in-the-Face." This heat
was, if possible, more amusing than the
first. One of the celestials had on a racing
suit and was mounted on a light wheel,
while the other wore his ordinary clothes
and his bike could not have weighed less
than fifty pounds. Though so heavily
handicapped, however, he made a game
race of it, and was only beaten a couple of
laps. Tinier Wetmore said the time was
3:oti 4-5, and the other timers concurred.
The next race, and one which Droved
the most hotly contested of the evening,
was the final of the one mile invitation,
those who had qualified in their heats be
ing C. 8. Wells, Bay City, H. Downing,
Garden City, H. W. Squires, Acme, and
"William Yeoman, Reliance. Downing did
most of the pace-setting, with Wells,
Squires and Yeoman trailing him in the
order named. Wells went to the front on
the sixth lap, but Downing would not give
him the pJace, and they fought it out to
the tape, Wells winning by barely a
wheel's length, Squires third, Yeoman
fourth. A blanket would have covered
the four as they crossed the tape. Wells'
time was 2:30 1-5.
The winners of the first three heats of
the mile scratch open were then brought
out as, owing to the number of heats, it
was necessary to run the race off in three
semi-final heats. Crafts, Acme, Byrne,
Imperial, and Languetin, Bay City, rode
the first, Byrne winning in 2:312-5, though
his lead over the other two at the tape
was only a few inches.
Edwards, Olympic, Goo.dwin, San Fran
cisco Road Cub, and Freeman, Bay City,
had qualified for the second semi-final.
They fire a fast trio of sprinters, and cut
out a lively pace from the start. Goodwin
stole a march on the sixth lap and secured
quite a lead, but the others soon overtook
him and he was Passed a few yards from
Jcratcb "by Edwards and Freeman in the
order named. Time, 2:33 3-o.
qSiffedVor the last semi-tinal, but igl
did not start, as he was somewhat tired
from the effort required jo win tepre
vious races. Tantau took first place, with
Deln.as close "up at the hmsh. lime,
~'\fter"a short rest the winners of the
three semi-finals, Byrne, Imperial, and
EdTards and Tantau, Olympic, started for
the linal of the one-mile scratcn open.
Referee Welch put a time limit on the race
of 2:30. Edwards set all the pace for tne
first six laps, anil beat the others out in a
pretty finish, the time being 2:30 4-o. me
victory was a very popular one, and &a
wards was roundly applauded.
The last race on the programme was the
ten-mile club cup race. This event is to
be run in five heats and a final, one for
each night of the tournament except Sun
day. The clubs and riders entered in the
first heat run last night were: Bay City
Wheelmen, T. A. Griffiths; Reliance Club
Wheelmen, A. M. Boyden; Garden City
Cyclers, Hardy Downing; Olympic Club
Wheelmen, George Tantau. The men
kept well bunched for the entire distance,
and negotiated the miles as follows : First,
3:07; second, 5:52 1-5; third. 8:26 1-5;
fourth, 11:48; fifth, 11:17; sixth, 1Â«:572-5;
seventh, 19:45 4-5; eighth, 22:34 2-5; ninth,
25:2.5 3-5.
The men livened up the pace consider
ably at about the middle of the last mile,
and a hot sprint marked the finish of the
race. Griffiths led the bunch for three
laps, with the others fighting out every
inch of the way. Downing slipped a pedal
on the last lap and was out of it, and Boy
den was also left behind. This left Griffiths
and Tantau, who tore down to the tape
side by side. The result was very doubt
ful ana the judges decided the race a dead
heat between the two. The time for the
ten miles was 27:57 1-5, which is phenom
enally last.
