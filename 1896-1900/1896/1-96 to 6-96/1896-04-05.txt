[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Esq., April 4.â Easter is a
cool season this year with vegetation some
three weeks ahead of the normal state but
with less sunshine and cheerfulness about
its holiday effects than usual. The exodus
. of Londoners to seashore and country, ac
cording to railway figures, is greatly in
excess of ordinary years, but one gathers
that people are coming back sooner than
they usually do. It is a preoccupied time,
and Parliament sets the example of eager
ness to get back to its place of business by
taking a mere hasty week's vacation.
Parliamentary recesses may mean all
sorts of things. They have a short one
here because the general outlook is trouble
some and there is important work to be
done. They take an exceptionally long
one in France, that is the Deputies of the
Chamber do, for exactly the same reasons.
Evidently France is to make large bids for
our undivided attention this summer.
No one can understand what is happen
. ing without laying hold of the fact that
' Bourgeois has suddenly become a striking,
impressive personality in the French im
agination.
"With the possible exception of Jules Fer
ry, whose fame was unpopularity, Bourgeois
gets more individual attention now than
, any French politician since: Gambetta.
When Paris heard a few weeks ago that
the people of the south were yelling
"Vive Bourgeois.'" whenever the Presi
dential junketing party halted, the thing
created some surprise; but cow Paris
itseir has caught the infection, and it is
Bourgeois everywhere. The growth of the
legend this past week has been peculiarly
gonrdlike. It seemed the merest, chance
j on Monday if his scratch majority of seven
did not vanish altogether. Four days later
he had a majority of ninety in the cham
ber to do with what he liked ; and when
he disclosed that what he liked was that
the Deputies should, adjourn for seven
weeks they trooped off in all docility.
leaving him absolute master of the situ
ation. â¢ |
Previous generations used tb laugh; at
the story of the man asking fa Parisian
bookseller for a copy of the French consti
tution and receiving the reply, "We do
not keep periodical literature," and the
joke may be revived now once more for
current use.
The Senate's session yesterday was the
opening scene of a new revolutionary
drama which will alter other things besides
the constitution before it ends. The
Senate spat in impotent rage at Bourgeois,
and he sneered in its face like a second
â¢ Robespierre, shrugged his shoulders and
went away with a hard smile on his lips.
The Senate is to meet again April 21, a full
month before the chamber, and will begin
war on the Madagascar treaty, on the
foreien policy, on everything else minis
terial which it can reach. After yester
day's events, however, its cartridges are
all blank. Bourgeois treats it as a settled
principle now that a hostile vote in the
Senate has no party significance, and will
go on as he has begun, ignoring all that
the Senate does, but meantime preparing
throughout France a merciless return
blow under which the senatorial majority
will reel. As with us, one-third of the
Senators retire at a time, and their suc
cessors are not elected by direct popular
suffrage. The municipal councils, to be
chosen the first week in May. will have
the selection of nearly 100 new Senators,
and those who are retiring are almost to a
man moderate Republicans or Monarch
ists.
Bourgeois and his followers are straining
every nerve, and the letter of the election
laws as well, to sweep their councils into
the radical camp, and from all one hears
of the provincial effervescence of enthu
siasm, it is very likely that he will do it.
In the battle royal between the rising
new savior of society and intrenched priv
ilege in the Senate, the Berthelot incident
has rather faded out of view. We know
now that he was thrown out at Russia's
behest. Ostensibly his fault was that he
announced a definite programme of in
ternational procedure for France without
consulting Russia first. Really he was put
aside because he was too candid and log
ically inflexible to suit Russia's' elusive
non-committal diplomacy. Like Baron
De Councel here, Berthelot fell and 'said
that France must settle whether she
wanted a quarrel with Germany or with
England and having decided, make friends
with the other. Russia's plan > for ' France
is that she should be friends with nobody
and yet be allowed to fight with nobody,
bit just keep all Europe anxiously run
ning up fresh bills for armies and navies
that it is afraid to useâ a process which'
mty bankrupt Europe, but brings only
grist to Russia's mill.
The Pall Mall [ Gazette's Paris corre
spondent is insisting that an Anglo-French
agreement has been arranged, but I do not
credit it, for the simple reason that Eng
land would not buy anything, since it can
do perfectly without it, and no French
Ministry could afford to make such a deal
without having a heavy price %in hand to
show. ' . â , ;'

is probably no ground whatever for the
openly expressed German suspicion that
the whole thing is a ; put-up job, but it is
conspicuously fortuitous, at least from
Cecil Rhodes' point of view, that he should
be given this ready-made opportunity to
rehabilitate himself and win a new set of
laurels off-hand as the rescuer of British
livesand property and the restorer of Brit
ish prestige. If one judged by, the violent
denunciation of the Government's new ed
ucation measure which fills the.' Liberal
papers, and echoes from the .Liberal plat
form*, a great and prolonged Parlia
mentary struggle might be supposed to be
impending. As a matter of cold fact this
vehement racket belongs to , the order of
political maneuvers known to us under
the general head of shelling the woods. I
doubt whether, when f the time comes,
there will be even so . much ;as a division
taken against the second reading.
The truth is the bill is shaped with great
adroitness. ' It does give apparently to the
advocates of voluntary : as against public
schools almost all ;- they have -been agitat
ing for, but the machinery by which this
is done provides so many loopholes for the
nonconformists to slip in and ; divert '; to
themselves benefits which are ostensibly
meant for the church that while the for
mer feel in duty bound to carry out the
measure they are secretly engaged already
in computing their possible gains under it.
The case of Wales is typical. The bill, by
giving county councils supreme authority
in distributing funds, will make it possi
; ble for the Welsh Radicals through their
control of these bodies .to scoop up the
whole educational grant â¢of i the principal
ity and turn it over to the Calvinists, Bap
tists or whoever they '- like. Therefore the
Welshmembers, though their loyalty to "â 
the party induces them to profess deep in
dignation at the bill, by no means intend
to vote against it. The same is true of the
numerous north English Radicals who
come 2 from â¢ districts where ' the "< Liberal
party is locally in i power, â¢ and when they
and the Welsh are : subtracted there is"
nothing left in \ opposition , but ' aâ¢â¢ score or
so of other \ English & Liberals and the
Scotch contingent, who, have "no practical

the past mail, that a Russo-Japanese war
is growing to seem really imminent. Many
reasons are given for this feeling, of which
the most' significant' perhaps is that Rus
sia has . suddenly chartered a number of
German arid Norwegian vessels to serve as
coal transports, a thing for which there
would be no need whatever unless she
assumed that the 'Japanese ports were to

happen in case of war. At the present

is more than hinted from Japan that Rus

we are likely soon enough to be forced to

After a year and more of rather shape

Russia is beginning to exhibit signs of in

It is now 'taken for granted by the reac
tionary classes: that the arbitrary powers
they obtained under the late Czar in the
ruling of ' the rural populations are to be
gradually,' revoked; and, indeed, a start in
this direction ' has j already been made.
Old absolutists like Prince Mestchersky

J , LONDON, 1 Eng., April 4.â The appeal of
France and Russia to the Egyptian mixed
tribunal against the decision of a majority
of the Egyptian Debt Commission to
grant . Â£500,000 ,' for the expenses of the
Soudan 'expedition, '; has been ' summarily
disposed of by a majority of the members
of tne tribunal declining to admit that
the tribunal has any jurisdiction in the
matter. . \ \
The Egyptian treasury has paid the
whole of the first draft.of Â£500,000, most of
which has already been expended. An
other Â£500,000 will' soon be required. ! :
M. Bourgeois, the French Prime Mm
is continuing his' negotiations : with
Lord Salisbury trying to get pledges limit
ing the, demands that will be made on the
Egyptian^treasury, and is also trying ; to
get information as to the plans of the cam
paign in the Soudan. / .
I Â£ The Pall Mall Gazette to-day asserts that
an agreement between France and Great
Britain on this question has been 'already
obtained. !: If so, :M. Bourgeois ': was easily
satisfied. Doubtless ; Lord'' Salisbury will
readily give assurances of the intention of
the British Government to limit the sphere
of operations as was announced in \ Parlia
mentâthat is 'to say, that the advance of
f the expedition would depend on the resist
ance offered by the Dervishes. -. J ;y â¢-â¢
The reason for his ; not hesitating to give
these assurances is that he foresees that
the time";. will come t when \i an advance of
the Mahdists will " give ' an opportune ex
cuse for the enlargement of the scope of
the war. Even now, according to the
Spectator, the Government contemplates
sending to Suakim, on the Red Sea, 10,000
troops from India to break up the forces
of Osman Digma and to threaten the rear
of 'the dervishes, who are fronting the ex
pedition that will proceed up the Nile.
That the design to advance from Suakim
on Berber' is entertained is obvious
from the orders that have been issued for
a resurvey |to be made of that part of the
Berber Railway that was constructed dur
ing the last campaign.
1 The progress of the Nile expedition is
not rapid.' The main part of the expedi
tion is still at Assoun, from which place
the newspaper correspondents accompany
ing the advance started only on Thursday
with the camelry on the long march along
the east bank of the Nile. The Maxim
batteries and : cavalry are being slowly
transported^ by steamers to Wady-Halfa, 1
from which place it will be impossible to
make a general advance before May. The
rumors that dervishes -are assembling be
fore Suarda are unreliable.

ONE ROBBER CONFESSES
Fred Townsend Describes the
Raid on the Street â  Railway
Carshops.
PLANNED TO LOOT A TEAIN
One of the Gang Weakened and
Betrayed ths "Jack" Harris
Was a Member.
SACRAMENTO, . Cal., April The
arrest of L. L. Callendine to-day by Police
Sergeant McManus ends the career of one
of the most dangerous criminal organiza
tions that ever operated on the. Pacific
Coast, and the story of the method by
which the gang was brought to justice by
Detective Max Fisher ana Policeman Pen
nish, with the assistance of Chief of Police
Drew and Sheriff Johnson, would make a
novel thrilling in every detail. . The, par
ticular crime which it is alleged these men
committed was the robbery of .the safe in
the carhouse of the electric street railroad
company last December.
That robbery is graphically described by
Fred Townsend, one of the main partici
pants, who has made a full confession to
the local authorities.
Townsend ' and a man' named Joe Oster,
whom he has been living with, engaged in
a drunken quarrel on Sunday. Weapons
were drawn, and Oster was slightly
wounded in the foot by the accidental dis
charge of a pistol. " r .
After the men had been separated
Townsend had Oster arrested. The latter
in revenge . intimated that should his
sister, whom Townsend , was courting,
desire she could tell a story which would
land Townsend in State prison. In .the
mean. time, Townsend and the woman
had quarreled, and this fact coming to the
knowledge of , Detective Fisher and Officer
Pennish, they visited her and persuaded
her to expose Townsend.
The . woman stated that Townsend and
L. L. Callendine had attempted to steal a
bicycle six weeks ago from 603 N street, in
this city, and that when discovered and
pursued .by L. C. Roberts and W. J. Hall
Callendine had turned on his pursuers and
fired several shots at them. Armed with
this information the officers placed Town
send, under '. arrest and charged him with
the crime. . The latter broke down arid
told the following story
"Last year I was discharged from the
employ of the street railroad company
because I used .to put my bicycle on the
car . on my last trip at night, so that I
could ride home. Shortly afterward I met
Callendine, who suggested that I ought to
get even with the company.. I asked how,
and he said by robbing the office. Then
Callendine said he would go to the car
office, under the pretense of searching for
work, for the purpose of ascertaining the
lay of the land and to find out where the
money was kept. He did that, and when
he came back he remarked, 'Now we will
go and hold her up.' " ' â¢;'
Callendine then said, according to
Townsend, that he had â¢ another man,
Harry Baker, whom he wanted to let in
on the job. Townsend did not like this
plan, as three persons could not keep a

secret as well as two. The job was a
dangerous one. Callendine assured him
that Baker was all rightâ brave and re
liable man. On the night that it was
proposed to commit the robbery Baker
brought a cart downtown at 7 o'clock, and
at 11 o'clock they drove to the vicinity of
the carhouse and hid behind a fence until
the workingmen had departed, leaving
the clerk and three warehousemen in the
office.
Then they rnshed into the offlce'throngh
a rear door. : Callendine carried a rifle and
compelled the men to throw up their
hands. Baker then searched the people
for weapons. Finding none, the rifle was
handed to Townsend, who stood guard
while his companions stole the money.
Baker tore the safe away from the wall
and opened it, and Callendine tooK the
Backs of money and placed them in the
cart. Then they all jumped in and drove
away. They went to Callendine's apart
ment and divided the money. It amounted
to $83 50 each, but Callendine, as leader,
claimed that he should have the lion's
6hare, so they each gave him $5 and sep
arated.
As soon as the officers learned Town-
Bend's story they went to the railroad
Ehops where Baker was employed and
placed him under an est. Sheriff John
son and Detective Fisher then left the city
for Auburn in order to effect the arrest of
Callendine, who was supposed to be resid
ing on his ranch, some sixteen miles from
that place. At Auburn they were met by
Sheriff Conroy with a team and left at
once for the ranch, but their night ride
through the foothills ended in failure, for
Callendine had taken flight. They fol
lowed his tracks and finally traced him to
Sacramento, to find that he had fallen
into the clutches of Sergeant McManus.
The former residence of "Jack" Harris,
who was killed by Callendine, the latter
having since married Harris' widow, was
then searched and a perfect arsenal of
firearms discovered. Rifles and shotguns
were secreted beneath the beds, in the
the closets and behind the bureaus, and
eventually the full history of the gang was
brought out.
Over a year ago it is claimed Callendine,
Ed Ray, "Jack" Harris (a son of the late
Detective Len Harris), Henry Baker and
another man banded themselves together
under a solemn oath with the intention of
committing a series of robberies. The first
scheme to be attempted was the robbery
of a Southern Pacific overland train.
This was to take place between Florin
and Brighton, ten miles south of this city.
At that time Townsend was not con
sidered worthy of being admitted into the
league; but Callendine sent him with a
horse and cart to his ranch near Auburn
to obtain a quantity of dynamite which
was to be used in obtaining an entrance to
the express car. The overland train did
not stop at Florin, and it was agreed that
Ray should go to Stockton, purchase a
ticket as far as Florin, and in this way
have the train stop at that place.
In the meantime the rest of the gang
were to remain in conspicuous places in
the city until the last moment possible,
and then drive to Florin and board the
train when it stopped. After it again got
under headway the express car was to be
detached, the engineer and firemen cap
tured and the safes blown open with
dynamite.
After all the arrangements had been
carefully made Raj' was given the money
to go to Stockton, but he got intoxicated,
and was seen by the gang in confidential
conversation with a policeman, and his
confederates, doubting his fidelity, de
clared the affair off. It was well they did
bo, as the railroad authorities got wind of
the intended hold-up and sent armed
guards on the train. Whether Ray proved
a traitor will probably never be known; at
all events he immediately left the State.
Numerous other robberies, it is claimed,
will be traced to the gang. They are be
lieved to have been concerned in the nu
merous streetcar holdups in this city. Of
the original organization, of which Callen
dine is claimed to have been the leading
spirit, but two are leftâ Callendine and
Baker â and they are in duress with, it is
claimed, sufficient evidence to laud them
in State prison.
-VOX A SPECIAL FUXD.
River Improvements May Be Delayed by
a Legislative Error.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April During
a meeting of the board of examiners in
the Governor's office this afternoon, called
for the purpose of passing upon routine
bills, Governor Budd, referring to the $250,
--000 appropriation by the National Govern
ment for the purpose of river improve
ment, said :
"This amount was appropriated upon
the condition that the State appropriate
the same amount. This was done, but
instead of being placed in a special fund
it was included in the tax levy and paid
into the general fund. Since then the
general fund has become exhausted, and
in my opinion it will be necessary for the
Legislature to make the appropriation
over again if the Government appropria
tion is to become available."
Should such be the case it will prove a
great source of chagrin aud disappoint
ment to the farmers along the Sacramento
River, who, since the publication of the
fact that the National appropriation has
been secured, have been jubilant over the
idea that, though the repairing of levees
and dredging operations, the bed of the
river would become so thoroughly scoured
that danger from floods and overflowswould
be avoided. The Controller, however, fails
to agree with the Governor in his,decla
ration and claims that a warrant will be
drawn asainst the general fund on de
mand for the $250,000 State appropriation.
The Controller holds that the general
fund often becomes exhausted even when
there are outstanding warrants against it
and that the latter are cashed whenever
the general fund becomes replenished, and
he considers this State appropriation in
the same light as an outstanding warrant.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 4.-The
cause of Cuba was the subject of consid
eration in the House to-day. There were
so many members desiring to sneak that it
was arranged to hold a night session in
order to give them all an opportunity to
be heard and to take the vote immediately
after the reading of the journal Monday.
The speakers to-day were: Adams (R.) of
Pennsylvania, Knox (R.) of Massachu
setts, Cockreli (D.) of Texas, Newlands
(Silver) of Nevada, Stewart (R.) of New
Jersey, Walsh (D.) of New York. Quigg
(R.)of New York, Wheeler (D.) of Ala
bama, Buck (D.) of Louisiana, supporting
the resolution, and Gillette (R.) of Massa
chusetts, Ellett (D.) of Virginia, Russell
(D.) of Georgia and Turner (I).), of Georgia
opposing it.
Mahany (R.) of New York stated he
would vote for the resolutions, but criti
cized the Foreign Affairs Committee for
bringing them into the House.
Before entering upon the consideration
of the Cuban resolution the House passed
a bill to pension John M. Thayer of
Nebraska, formerly a major-general in the
volunteer service, at the rate of $100 a
month.
The report of Elections Committee No. i
in the case of Robinson vs. Harrison from
the Third Alabama District in favor of
Harrison, the sitting member, was pre
sented and agreed to.
The report of the same committee upon
the case of Goodwin vs. Cobb, from the
Fifth Alabama District, unseating Cobb
and seating Goodwin was presented by
Judge Daniels, chairman, who stated that
he would ask the House to consider it on
the 13th inst.
The House was not long in getting to
work on the Cuban business the morning
hour matters being disposed of with great
rapidity.
Fisher (R.) of New York asked unani
mous consent for the present consideration
of a resolution directing the Secretary of
Agriculture to carry out the seed distribu
tion as formerly, but after the presenta
tion of a unanimous report of Elections

District, in favor of the contestee and the
majority report of the same committee on
the Goodwin-Cobb case from the Fifth
District in the same State, Hitt
of Illinois called up the conferenc
report on the Cuban resolutions, and
Adams (R.) of Pennsylvania, one of the
members of the committee, took the floor.
He denied that sentiment had changed
with respect to recognizing the belliger
ency of the Cubans since the passing of
the original resolutions in the House
of Representatives. He deprecated the at
tempt to create a race prejudice against
Cubans, and asserted that all the leaders,
except Maceo, were whites, and not . ne
groes and mulattoes, as has been reported.
He quoted from the correspondence sent
to Congress some weeks ago to show that
the best class of Cubans had joined the in
surgents. Spain had not kept the prom
ises which she made to the Cubans after
the last rebellion closed, and this was the
cause of the present uprising. He detailed
at some length the reasons why the
Cubans were entitled to a recognition of
belligerent rights, and explained in pass
ing that their capital was so impregnable
that the 6000 Spanish troops but six miles
distant had not attempted to capture it.
The Cubans, he insisted, possessed all the
requisites for recognition. He quoted
official authorities to show that Spain had
120,000 regular troops, with an auxiliary
force of 40,000 Cuban volunteers, and that
they were opposed by 50.000 insurgents,
30.000 of whom were well armed and
equipped. Notwithstanding this the
Spanish forces had not gained a foot of
territory, but had been driven back to the
very gates of Havana. ...
Adams thought the time had now come
when something should be done, and he
believed that if a recognition of belliger
ency, would help the Cubans the House
ought to adopt the pending resolutions.
Adams, in conclusion, sÂ»id Spain would
not conquer Cuba and that that country
would join the ranks of those nations
whose governments are dedicated to the
highest and best interests of man, where
white and black had the same civil and
religious rights, and which were admin
istered without domination from any Euro
pean power. Applause.]
Knox (R.) of Massachusetts said that a
state of war did exist in Cuba; that some
where among the fastnesses of the moun
tains of that island, the ancient strong
hold of liberty, there had been established
a government, founded upon justice and
equality of men. and that the Cuban army
had made marches, fought battles and en
dured privations which had challenged the
admiration of the world.
The duty devolved upon the United
States, where free government had its
highest development, to recognize the
belligerency of the Cuban insurgents, that
they might have their liberty and that
they might be as free as ourselves.
Gillette (R.) of Massachusetts opposed
the resolutions. He admitted that the
overwhelming sentiment of the House, as
manifested by the vote of several weeks
ago, probably represented public opinion ;
but this matter should ' not ;be decided by
public opinion, for the reason that public
opinion was not the law and right of the
case, but be considered . it only as an ex
pression of sympathy with the Cubans.
Granting belligerency to the Cubans, he
said, was not a function or prerogative of
the legislative power but of the executive,
and the passage of the resolutions would
be a usurpation on the part of Congress.
The motive behind the resolutions, Gillette
said, the reason why the Cubans desired
their passage, was that they would lead to
a war between Spain and the United
nnwinmiTin ii hi urn "i ii 'iim Pin in i i i i r

States. . Such a conflict, in his opinion, was
the only hope of Cuban independence, and
that explained why the resolutions were
here. ' -.*.** _â  â â  *
As to the second resolution, that favor
ing friendly . intervention by the United
States, Gillette said it was useless to hope
for any good results to follow.' Because
of what has been said in another body in
debate on this subject, the proud sensitive
ness of Spain had been wounded, so that
friendly intervention on the part of the
United States was impossible.
When Gillette had concluded, an effort
was made by Hitt to secure an agreement
to close debate and take a vote to-day, but
was . unsuccessful. . A great majority of
members present wanted to i vote at 4
o'clock, but a number desired to speak
and it was finally arranged to debate the
report the rest of the day, including a
night session, and take a vote on Monday
immediately after the reading of the jour
nal. , "'-â -... "".-â . ./-"*.**/
Cockreli (D.) of Texas earnestly advo
cated the cause of Cuba. If he had the
power, he would take Spain by the throat,
have her remove Weyler and free Cuba
and command her to keep her hands off.
[Applause.] ~' r \ - ' V/
Ellett (D.) of Virginia opposed the reso
lutions on the ground that the insurgents
had not yet reached that condition which
would justify extending belligerent rights
to them.
Newlands (Silver) of Nevada advocated
the adoption of the report. As to the ob
jection that the resolutions should not be
adopted because Spain was a friendly na
tion, he said nations were not really
friendly toward each other. They were
either at peace or war, but not friendly.
The same obligation devolved upon na
tions as upon individuals to aid those
struggling for life and liberty, and In this
case the obligations upon the United States
was the stronger because the struggle was
going on at its very threshold. Referring
to the terms of the resolutions, he said
Spain should understand that under the
velvet glove of friendly intervention there
â¢ was the iron hand of the United States.
â¢ Stewart (R.) of New Jersey, also favor
ing the resolutions, declared that the
United States should aid struggling Cuba
to achieve her independence.
Russell (D.) of Georgia asked why the
United States should interfere with the
domestic affairs of other nations. No
other nation had expressed the slightest
interest in our intention to interfere in
behalf of the Cuban insurgents. These in
surgents, over whom so many crocodile
tears have been shed, are what we used to
call bushwhackers and barn-burners, and
Russell asked what in the name of com
mon-sense there was to justify the demand
for intervention and granting of beligerent
rights to them. C^?-;-."
Walsh (D.) of New York occupied the
attention of the House, he said, for the
purpose of expressing his approval of the
resolutions and to defend Senator Hill of
New York of the charges made by Adams
that he was actuated by other than the
best motives in his treatment of them. .
Turner (D.) of Georgia argued some
what elaborately against the resolutions.
He said: "I yield to no man in my sym
pathy for any people struggling for free
dom, but it is not a Question of sympathy.
It is a question which affects our own"
interests and which relates to our duty as
a member of the family of nations. It
also deals with our duty under treaty
stipulations with other nations." '-
These, as Turner said, involved all the
reasons which he advanced for opposing
the resolutions. In the course of his re
marks Turner referred to the trying cir
cumstances in which the Southern States
stood during the reconstruction period
following the rebellion and called the
attention of the House to the fact that in
Cuba there existed a condition which was
not equaled in any Southern State. The
Anglo-Saxon race had the instinct of gov
ernment and no other race had it in nearly
so large a degree.
A contention for â¢ the mastery between
the two races in Cuba, Turner said, would
be Inevitable. Having had an experience
in reconstruction, he would not willingly
undergo it again, nor bring about a con
dition of things in any country that would
repeat there that experience.
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama favored the
resolutions, and Mahany (R.)of New York
said he â  would vote for * them, but under
protest. *
The last speaker of the afternoon was
Buck (D.) of Louisiana, who pleaded elo
quently for Cuban freedom. ,
The Cuban debate was interrupted near
the close of the session by Bartlett (D.) of
Georgia, who, under a privileged question,
made an explanation of the connection
with the now famous circular which formed
the subject of an acrimonious colloquy be
tween Gibson (R.)of Tennessee and Sulzer
(D.) of New York, in the course of the de
bate ,on the Bayard resolutions several
weeks ago. Bartlett disclaimed any con
nection with the use of the circular made
by Sulzer, which was without his knowl
edge or consent, the circular having
reached Sulzer's hands after being passed
around among the members of the House.
Gibson accepted Bartlett's disclaimer,
and withdrew any implication upon that
gentleman's connection with the incident
which reflected upon him in any way. He
would suggest, however, that in the fu
ture whenever Bartlett had possession of
any such paper he be very careful how he
exhibited it in the vicinity of the gentle
man from New York. [Laughter.]
The House at 5 p. m. took a recess until
8 p. "'ljlfflfll
â  There were but six members when the
House met to-night to consider further
the conference report on the Cuban resolu
tion. McCall of Massachusetts presided.
The public galleries were well filled.
Dockery(D.) of Missouri ; was the first
speaker. He was in hearty accord with
the resolutions. He said the strife in
Cuba rose above the level of mere guerrilla
warfare. If not why v were the armies of
Spain unable to ; repress â¢ the uprising of

strongly to the second resolution, although
believing that the. first resolution was
proper enough.
Baker (Pop.) of Kansas asserted that the
Anglo-Saxon race would not stand where
the Cubans have stood. He recited wrongs
they have suffered .at the" hands of Spain,
and said he would' be glad to vote for a
resolution _ recognizing their independ
ence. .'.- V' ..';." ";.'â¢. ' : '
Mahon (R.) of Pennsylvania evoked )fa
burst of loud applause from the galleries
in his denunciation of the cruelties prac
ticed by the Spaniards against the Cubans.
During our four years' civil war, he said,
no man lost his life except in battle. ,-. He
thought the Government had the right to
recognize any people who are . struggling
for liberty.
Otey (D.) of Virginia told a number of
humorous .stories, which created a good
deal of laughter in the galleries and on the
floor. He ; sympathized with rebelsâ he
was one himself, i. he ".. said. The United
States being free, wishes to see every other
country free. ,We have a right to express
our opinion about this matter and - Spain
cannot object. We express out opinion
about everything. We did . it recently
about Mr. Bayard, but he did hot resign.
We shall do it again about Cuba, and Spain
will not get mad nor will Cuba either.
MJlliken (R.) of Maine made an eloquent
appeal for the passage of the resolutions,
and was followed by Avery (R.) of Michi
gan and Talbert (D.) of South Carolina V
Pickler (R.) of South Dakota said the
United States should assist the Cubans
without fear of the consequences. He be
lieved in this case that the voice of the
people is the voice of God.
Tucker (D.) of Virginia said we are at
tempting a precedent which, if followed,
will return to vex us. He hoped the res
olutions would be defeated, because their
adoption means the beginning of a policy
of destruction to our old-time traditions,
unless the United States proposes to be
come the wetnurse of all the weak coun
tries in the South American colony.

cluding speaker. "When Spain," he said,

gave to her people at home, Cubans had a
right to rebel." -:v-\'- : ,V

PACIFIC ROADS' DEBTS
The Refunding Bill May Not
Receive Consideration
This Session.
Morgan and Maguire Will Get Their
Heads Together and Draft a
Substitute.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 4,â lt is
expected that the Pacific roads' refunding
bill will be reported to the full committees
of both Senate and House on Monday, and
that within a day or two the bill will be
reported to both houses.
There are various reports afloat as to the
disposition of the managers to consider the
bill at this session. Representative M aguire
heard to-day that one of Speaker Reed's
lieutenants had said the measure would
not receive consideration this session, but
Maguire said he has not verified the cor
rectness ot the report.
Powers, chairman of the Pacific Roads
Committee of the House, evidently expects
that the bill will be considered. He said
to The Call correspondent several days
ago that this was his understanding, and
to-day he expressed an opinion that Con
gress would not adjourn until the end of
June, contrary to general expectation that
it would adjourn about the middle of May.
It is the undertanding that Morgan's
resolution, providing that the whole ques
tion of the Pacific roads' debts shall be de
termined by the District of Columbia
Court, will be taken up in the Senate on
Tuesday, if Senator Morgan is able to beat
the Capitol. He has been quite ill. It is
understood that when he has sufficiently
recovered he and Maguire will get their
beads together and draft a bill to be
offered as a substitute for the refunding
measure. It is probable that the substitute
will be on the lines of Morgan's reso
lution, referring the matter to the courts. j
HYPNOTIZED FOR SIX DAYS
James Mahoney at Last Awak
ened From Sleep by
Santanelli.
A Most Remarkable Exhibition Wit
nessed by Physxians at Fort
Wayne, Indiana.
FORT WAYNE, fern., April James
Mahoney, the young man who was hyp
notized by tbe hypnotist Santanelli last
Monday night, was awakened to-night
at 10 o'clock by Santanelli. When he was
put to sleep on Monday night the hyp
notist said he would remain in that condi
tion until to-night without food or drink.
At that time Mahoney weighed ; 134%
pounds; his pulse was 78 and respiration
17. During the entire week Mahoney has
been lying on a bed in a local theater
under the surveillance of a committee of
medical students. They certify that he
has not been awake, and that he neither
ate nor dranK.
To-night a large number of physicians
were present to witness the awakening.
At 10 o'clock Santanelli ordered Mahoney
to rise from his bed and sit in a chair.
Mahoney, still hypnotized, obeyed the
command. Then five physicians, all strong
men, held him. Santanelli clapped his
hands loudly three or four times, each
time calling on Mahoney to awaken.
Finally Mahoney came to his senses,
stretched his arms and legs and tore away
from the five men, raising Dr. Schrader
off the floor with his right arm. He was
then thoroughly conscious. The physicians
noted his condition as follows: Weight
123%; pulse, 103; respiration, 28.

FIRED HOT SHOT
Telegrams and Letters Re

the Speech.
AN EMEMY OF TRAFFIC.-
Tactics of the Canadian Pacific
Cause It to Be a Commer
* cial Antagonist.
INTERSTATE LAWS VIOLATED.
Lives Off Its Subventions and Busi
ness Taken From United States
Railroads.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 4.-In the
recent discussion of the proposed subsidy
to the Oceanic Steamship line in the Post
office bill Senator Elkins made a speech in
regard to which he has since received
many letters and telegrams. It was in
advocacy of a measure he introduced some
time ago, and now known as the Elkins
bill, to place a discriminating duty of 10
per cent ad valorem on all goods imported
to this country in vessels not sailing under
the American flag.'
This proposition was incorporated in the
Massachusetts Republican State platform
last week and Mr. Elkins is urging its
adoption as a plank of the. St. Louis plat
form. In his speech Elkins paid his re
spects to the Canadian Pacific Railroad as
follows: â '.;-. '\, v
"Thia Canadian Pacific is the national
enemy of the transportation interests of
the United States and stands to-day as our
greatest commercial antagonist. It vio
lates our interstate commerce laws with
complacent indifference, it cuts rates and
it takes freights from our Pacific railroads,
in which the United States has a direct
interest. It hauls more cheaply from St.
Louis and other interior points in our
country by way of Canada to Oregon and
San Francisco than the Pacific ; roads can
do, though the distance is much shorter.
It is a sharp competitor now for business
with all the Pacific roads from and to
California. For 2000 miles the Canadian
Pacific traverses a non-productive country,
one not able to support a railroad. It
lives off its subventions and the business
it takes from the railroads of the United
States.
"To oppose this active, open and op
pressive hostility to American trade,
American steamships and American rail
roads by England and Canada is the kind
of Monroe doctrine" that I favor, and I am
sure it. will have better results to our
people and their interests than a dispute
with England over an obscure boundary
in a foreign country over 3000 miles away.
The United States, in my opinion, should
at once withdraw this bonding privilege to
the Canadian Pacific." . . â¢ .â¢
\ Mr. Elkins' time was short and he gave
notice that at some future day he would
again discuss the bill to impose these dis
criminating duties and give the Senate ad
ditional facts and figures.
BACKED BY PERKIXS.
Reasons Why This Government Should
Grant Larger Subsidies.
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 4.â Senator
Perkins is making a determined effort to
secure the adoption of his amendment to
the postoffice appropriation bill granting
$80,000 subsidy to the Oceanic Steamship
Company. He has enlisted the assistance
of Senator Elkins, who advocated the
amendment on Thursday. Perkins made
a strong speech in the Senate, in which he
said:
"Mr. President, the $60,000 which it is
proposed by the committee to add in the
form of a subsidy, as the Senator from
Wisconsin terms it, is for additional com
pensation for carrying mails of this Gov
ernment to the islands of the Pacific, New
Zealand and Australia. , This steamship
company has been in operation for some
eight or ten years. It has maintained a
successful line of steamers. . The ships
were built in the United States by Ameri
can mechanics; they are manned by
American seamen, and have been success
fully plying on the Pacific Ocean between
San Francisco and the islands of the
Pacific, New Zealand and Australia. They
are satisfied, because our Government
would do more, with the meager sum
which they received ocean portage,
which amounted to about $55,000 per
annum. . ,
, "They were bringing to the United States
the trade of the Australian colonies. The
line became popularized by our own peo
ple, as well as the people of New Zealand,
to such an extent that the colonies of New
Zealand have yearly aided them by mail
subsidies. This condition of affairs con
tinued until the completion of the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad across the continent.
The well-known enterprise of our British
friends was first manifest by subsidizing
steamers between Vancouver - Â and Japan
and China. They gave . a subsidy which
was equivalent to the operations of their
steamer and interest upon their invest
ment. They continued the i line, taking
away a part of the j business that was con
trolled by the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company and Occidental and Oriental
line of steamships; butt by the I action of
the transcontinental railroad in making a
through rate from China to New York and
Atlantic ports we have been enabled to
keep a part of that business. .
"Not satisfied with endeavoring to
monopolize the trade of the Orient, they
have "r/ow placed ; a line of steamers be
tween Vancouver, Australia and -New
Zealand.' The Canadian line between Van
couver . and Australia consists of ! two
steamships with . monthly sailing. They
receive a subsidy from the Canadian Gov
ernment of Â£25,000 per annum, and from
the Australian colonies a subsidy of Â£10,
--000 per annum, equivalent to $14,533 per
voyage. . -
"In addition to this the steamship line
is to participate in a subsidy granted, by
the Imperial Government to the Atlantic
connection of the great transcontinental
Canadian railroad. At the present time I
cannot state what that subsidy will
amount to, but certainly not less than and
perhaps ? far in excess of Â£10,000 per an
num, thus â¢ bringing up : the entire l pay
ment that < line will receive in subsidy
from Vancouver to Australia $18,750 : per
voyage.
"la addition to this they have their
.-â¢â --..-....
agents to-day in the Hawaiian Islands and
in the Society Islands asking those repub
lics and colonies to aid them with a sub
sidy. Wherever the flag is trade follows
it, and England with her well-Known mari
time and commercial enterprise is to-day
striving for the trade of the Pacific Ocean.
"The Oceanic Steamship Company, which
is the only successful rival, the only
steamship company that flies the Ameri
can \ flag - south of the equator on the Pa
cific Ocean, receives from our Government
the magnificent sum of $4615 40 per voyage
for carrying the mails of our Government
to ..those, colonies, while New Zealand
alone gives $5769 per voyage to this Amer
ican line of steamersâ one-third more than
our own Government is paying for this
service. I say '. it is ' a : ; shame it is
a reflection upon American patriot
ism, " when we sit idly by and
permit the British to come in and take
this trade away from us by subsidizing
their ships by mail subsidies, by commer
cial subsidies and by subsidies making
: them naval auxiliary ships. No private
company can compete with such competi
tion.; England is reaching out with both
bands with an avaricious grip upon the
trade of New Zealand and Australia."
The matter will receive further consider
ation on Monday, when Senator Perkins
expects to speak again.

WAS DIVORCED BY FRAUD
Therefore the First Wife of
Selim Grant Rosekrans
Wants the Estate.
Will Battle With a Younger Sister
for the Money Left by the
Capitalist.
CHICAGO, 111., April 4. â Elizabeth
Rosekrans, first wife of the late Selim
Grant Rosekrans, the Board of Trade oper
ator who died intestate at Orlando, Fla.,
March 31, leaving an estate of $530,000,
brought suit in the Circuit Court to-day,
alleging that Rosekrans obtained a decree
of divorce from her in Milwaukee in 1883
by fraud and without giving her legal no
tice. The suit is directed against the sup
posed widow, Margaret Victoria, who is
the younger sister of the first wife. The
successful widow will get the whole
estate as there are no children by either
marriage.
The complainant states that she was
married to Rosekrans in Pembroke, Ont.,
in 1872, and lived with him until she
learned of the Milwaukee divorce court
proceedings and his marriage to her sister
a few months later. She t alleged that he
induced some one to enter an appearance
in court for her, the decree being obtained
on the ground of desertion. The news
broke her health, and being without means
and intimidated by threats of sending her
to an insane asylum and denouncing her
as immoral, the complainant says, she re
mained in Pembroke while he married her
sister, who had lived at their Milwaukee
home for a year.
Almost at the time the bill was filed the
Rosekrans funeral services were being held
from the family residence.

FEATURES OF THE PAGEANT.
â¢ Unique and Handsome Floats Will Be

Races.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 4.â The carnival
of rose? to be held in this city May 6. 7, 8
and 9 will be a grand affair and promises
to surpass all former floral fetes on this
coast in magnificence and extent. Acres
of flowers have been planted for the carni- J
val and the whole valley will be a sea of
bloom wÂ£en the floral fete opens. Im
mense arches will be erected across the
principal streets and the town will be
decorated with vari-colored bunting and
flowers. The electric light tower, over 200
feet high, will be covered with vines and
bunting and be a feature of the decora
tions. The thousands of visitors to this
city during the fete will witness a sight of
grandeur and magnificence.
The exercises at the big pavilion at Ag
ricultural Park will be of a highly enter
taining and novel character. On Wednes
day afternoon, in the presence of Governor
Budd and staff, the pavilion will be for
mally dedicated with President David
Starr Jordan of Stanford University as
president of the day and orator. In the
evening there will be a concert by a band
of forty pieces, the music being illustrated
with stereopticon views.
On Thursday there will be a polo game
between Riverside and Burlingame in the
park and in the evening a grand dress
ball in the pavilion and musical selections
by the La Favonta Mandolin Club of fifty
pieces. Friday will be Stanford day and
the entertainment will be varied, while the
fun will be as fast and furious as a thou
sand students can make it. There will be
bicycle races on Saturday, and in the
evening the carnival will close with a
masquerade fete, including a grotesque
parade ending at the pavilion, where danc
ing will follow.
A striking feature of the fete will be the
vast display of flowers of unlimited va
riety and varied hue. The principal deco
rations will be flowers, and the floats, the
vehicles in the parade, the buildings and
the streets will all be resplendent with the
choicest blossoms of nature, and the effect
upon the visitor to this spot of perpetual
spring will be amazing.
The city will take on a gala attire. The
buildings will be handsomely decorated, i
and stringers bearing American flags and
carnival colors will be thrown across the ]
streets. The red, white and blue will be
floating everywhere. An official carnival
flag to be of immense size is being de
signed. It will contain the colors with a
great rose and the word "Welcome," and
will be displayed by all the prominent
- business houses.
A number of arches will be erected at
various points in the city that will rival in
size and grandeur anything of the kind
ever before attempted on the coast. The
"Arch of the Carnival" will be erected on
the Alameda,, just . east of the narrow
gauge depot. This will span that wide
thoroughfare and the pavements and leave
three openings. The design will be ap
propriate to the mammoth proportions of
the arch. Especial pains will be taken to
make the arches at the railway depots
effective in appearance, so that visitors
from abroad will receive a good impres- i
sion on their arrival in the city. That
across First street, opposite Bassett, will
be imposing in appearance. It will be
' called the ".Ladies' Arch of Welcome."
The background will be white, surmounted
by a beautiful female figure. The arch
will be decorated elaborately with 'fl Oral
wreaths contributed by the ladies of San
Jose. It is certain that a very novel and
beautiful effect will be produced. There
will be other arches on Third and Santa
' Clara, San Antonio and First streets, in the
business center of the city. There is to be a
pleasing variety in the forms and decora
" tions of the arches. Each will have a dif
ferent design, and the line of march will
be so arranged as to pass . under all of
them. ' Besides the floral decorations they
will be made brilliant with the carnival
colors, hags and lanterns. It is the design
â  to make the arches the important features
that they should be in the decoration" of
the city for the great fete.
The carnival will open on May 6 with a
grand floral parade over two miles long.
There will be over fifty floats in line, rep
â¢ resenting every feature of the county its
...industries, its schools and its natural re
\ sources. ' The parade will , consist of five
divisions, each headed by a band, and. in
addition, most of the delegations from the
surrounding towns will have musical or
ganizations with them. A feature of the
parade will be two troops of floral lancers,
the horses and riders being covered with
floral trappings. ;
Each rider will carry a floral lance.; A
large number of beautifully decorated
T-carts, dogcarts, coaches and other fancy
rigs driven by prominent ladies and gen
tlemen of the city will be in line. A num
ber of the ladies are already enthusiasti
cally at work. The horses as well as the
vehicles will be covered with floral orna

of San Jose.
mentation. One of the most beautiful ob
jects in this line will be the family car
riage of John R. Chace of Santa Cruz,
which will be magnificently decorated in
yellow.
All the public schools in San Jose and
the surrounding districts, St. Joseph's
School and the University of the Pacific
will have floats in the parade. All of them
will be original and beautiful, in design.
The Horace Mann School will have a spa
cious float in line, upon which a number
ol gayly attired children will dance around
a May-pole. The evolutions that they
will perform with ribbons of the carnival
colors will be Intricate and beautiful, and
no doubt this float will attract much ad
miring attention on the line of march.
The Sunol-street School, in Hester Dis
trict, is preparing a magnificent float at
great expense. An immense swan will be
harnessed to a floatboat. The float will
be drawn by six handsome coal-black
horses. Other schools are making similar
arrangements for splendid displays. An
idea of the extent of the floats that are
under preparation may be pained from a
consideration of the space they would oc
cupy if they were placed one after another
as closely as they could move in line. The
floats and horses would, under these con
ditions, make a line over a half mile in
length.
It is certain that the parade will not be
less than two miles in length, and it is im
probable that it will be kept within that
limit. It is scarcely possible to imagine
the effect from any given point of this
large and brilliant passing spectacle, to in
clude many beautiful floats and decorated
rigs, gayly uniformed and flower-bedecked
school-children, civic societies, companies
of floral lancers, bands of music and drum
corps, all intermingled with innumerable
flags and banners. There can be no possi
ble doubt that this will be the most mag
nificent parade ever presented at a floral
festival on the coast.
The 4000 school children in the proces
sion will wear uniforms consisting of caps
and sashes in addition to floral garlands
and wreaths. The caps are to have a
crown of white, red bands and blue visors,
thus making up the carnival colors. The
sashes are to be red, white and blue. The
children are also being drilled. . Girls in
vari-colored costumes are to be grouped in
the march so as to produce striking and
beautiful effects that will attract as much
admiring attention as the floats and other
features.
A magnificent exhibit is beinc prepared
by the Santa Clara County Floral Society.
[ No expense is being spared, and at least
15,000 roses of one variety alone will be
consumed in this display. The float of
the Board of Trade will be one of the most i
elaborate and beautiful spectacles in the i
line of march. .
It is intended to move the great parade I
at noon sharp on Wednesday, the opening j
day of the carnival. As it passes the
Courthouse, going northward towara the
Hotel Vendome, it will be viewed by the
prize committee. On the return the
ladies driving the finest appearing turn
outs will be presented with awards in the
shape of banners. The school children
presenting the best appearance in line will
also receive awards. On returning to the
Courthouse these on foot will leave the
line t and .' assemble â¢in St." ' James Park,
where they will be permitted to > view the
rest of the pageant as it encircles the park
and then disbands. The floats that can
be kept bright and fresh for two or three
days, or whose decorations are renewed,
will be kept on exhibition the rest of the
week at Agricultural Park.
During the carnival there will be a con
stant round of fun and amusement fur
nished by the entertainment committee.
The attraction for Thursday afternoon
the polo game in which the noted River
side and Burlingame teams will compete
will take place at Agricultural Park. The
grounds are now being prepared for the
game. It will attract a large number of
society people from San Francisco, Santa
Cruz, Oakland, Alameda, Sacramento and
other points.
On Thursday evening, when the grand
dress bail of the carnival is to be given at
the pavilion, the decorations of the Inte
rior are to bo especially elaborate and ex
quisite.
On Fridayâ Stanford dayâ the entire
student body of over 1000 persons will
come to the City on a special train, leav
ing â¢: the . station at Palo Alto ; about â¢ 9
o'clock. Upon arriving at San Jose the
students will form in procession, and
headed by the university band of thirty
five pieces, will march through the princi
pal streets. Features of the - procession
will be a unique float representative of the
university buildings, and carriages, drawn
by the students, containing Dr. Jordan
and other members of the faculty. The
afternoon will ' be given _up to athletic
events, for which training has already be
gun. There will be a regular field day, the
list of events being the same as at the
Eastern intercollegiate track meets. . This
will be participated -in by the Stanford
athletes and representatives from other
athletic organizations on the coast, and
will include a 100-yard dash, ; 220-yard,
440-yard, 800-yard and one-mile runs,
shotputting, hammer-throwing and pole
vaulting. Besides these there will be a 100
--yard: dash, open only to students from
academic schools,* and a 220-yard dash,
closed to Santa Clara County. A number
of the events will be handicaps, which will
add to the interest from a spectator's
point of view. .
Among the ' sports will be a game jof

baseball between picked nines of, Stanford
and the University of California. The ;
| festivities of the day will end with an en
i tertainment at the pavilion in the evening
by the Stanford musical organizations.
The Stanford Glee Club, the Mandolin
Club, the Banjo Club and the Ladies' Man
dolin â¢ Club will take part, this being the
first time that these organizations have all
united in one entertainment. There will
also be a typical college rush on the stage.
On the afternoon of Saturday, the closing
day of the carnival, there will be a blue
ribbon bicycle meet under the auspices of
the Garden City Cyclers. This will be the
grand opening for the season of bicycling
racing events, and all the crackajacks of
the State will take part. Seldom have
cyclers generally looked forward to a meet
with so ; much eagerness, and there is an
assurance that it will be the most notable
affair ever given under the auspices of the
Garden City Cyclers on their famous track.
The carnival will . close on Saturday
night in a fitting manner with a season of
mirth and mystery. There will be masks
and music, and pleasing spectacles will be
intermingled . with grotesque in a be
wildering manner. It is in contemplation
to have a burlesque Queen parade that
will furnish no end of wild amusement to
the multitude. There will be a number of
comical floats and characters., The line of
march will end at the pavilion, where will
be held the carnival mask ball. In this
manner the great fete will be mirthfully ,
closed.
The San Jose Turn Verein is taking an
active interest in the great festival. It will
take part in the parade and have a mag
nificent float in line. During the four
evenings of the carnival the Turners will
give entertainments at their hall. .
On Wednesday evening there will be a
grand vocal concert, in which three of the
glee clubs of San Jose, representing, with
the chorus, over 100 voices, will partici
pate. On the second evening there will be
a gymnastic exhibition by the classes un
der the physical director, Professor H. Bit
ter. On the j third evening a number of
farces will be rendered in English and
German by . the best: talent in the city.
Saturday, the closing evening of the carni
val, will be All Fools' night at Turn Ve
rein Hall. It will be a season of ' unadul
terated enjoyment such as has seldom or
never been experienced by the fun-lovers
of San Jose.
The big pavilion in which the carnival
exercises will be held is 125x200 feet in di
mensions. The : seating capacity in the
gallery will be 2400. The main, floor, ex
clusive of the space allotted to booths, will
seat 3500. This will " make a total seating
capacity of 5000, with good standing room
for at least 500 more. When- the pavilion
is used for a convention hall and the booths
are not occupied . and that space can be
utilized for seating purposes, the structure
will have a seating capacity of 7000 per
sons. This, with the standing room, will
give the hall ; a capacity for 7500 people.
The decorations in the pavilion will be
magnificent.. Evergreen boughs will form
the background of the decorations.
Immense quantities of the beautiful red
wood foliage will be used. Upon this. the
floral decorations can be changed daily.
This effect of | green as a background I for
the other colors is the same seen in nature
and could j not :be g improved * upon. The
pillars and other portions of the building
will be profusely decorated with roses on
the opening day. 3On the other days there
will be '* decorations ; of sweet peas, mari
golds and other flowers. - To make impres
sive effects there will be great masses of
the same kinds of flowers in all available
positions. ', Ban of \ flowers ; of ; gorgeous
hue like mangolds,' for , instance, will pro
duce striking. effects. :.. > , ...,.< â¢:
The great ceiling of the pavilion, 125x200
feet in size, will be a wide expanse of ever
green . and Â« floral display. : The effect can
be better imagined than described, and the
reality will far exceed all " expectations.
Around the great stage a beautiful sun-,
burst effect will "be produced with , flowers
of different colors.. ..

c HEALDSBURG, Cal., AjÂ»il 4.â With
over $2000 in sight the executive commit
tee of the Healdsburg Floral Association
met ;at the City : Hall % last night, and ar
rangements for the three days' fiesta took
definite shape. The various sub-commit
tees were present, all asking for big appro
priations to â  carry on the : work, and all
were pleased with the amounts allowed.
The decorative committee report was the
first . considered. The electrical display
this year is to Ybe unique. A huge five
pointed star will extend over the plaza in
the center of the business portion of town,
and blue and gold lightsâ carnival colors
will make the night bright as day. The
other floral decorations will be many and
beautiful. Standing exhibits will be shown
in the Wigwam Theater, while the opera
house will be used for dances and enter
tainments. â¢ i.- -^;;
The amusement committee has arranged
for a tilting tournament,' balloon ascension,
horseracing and athletic sports,' including
two days' bicycle meet. ; The new track at
Luce's Park will be ready in time and Sec
retary J. J. Livernash of the Healdsbure
Wheelmen has received the sanction of
the L. A. W. for the" meeting. Liberal
prizes are to be offered and it is expected
that all the fast riders of the district will
be in attendance. The tilting tournament
was a feature of last year's fiesta and will
attract much interest this time.
Bands in plenty will be engaged and not
less than four musical organizations are
to be represented in the floral parade.
The contest for queen is now on in
earnest, and until the close will be a battle

steamers between San Francisco and Stock
ton, and he seeks to secure cheap fuel for
the operation of these vessels.
Mr. Bostwick's principal object, howevei,
is to place himself in a position to be able
to supply coal to interior California towns,
and especially those along the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers.
Many schooners, which have been
driven off the rivers as freight carriers by
the successful operation of barges, Mr.
Bostwick says, will be utilized largely
this spring and 1 summer in transporting
coal from Washington to California, and
there will follow in consequence of the ad
dition of these carriers a general reduction
in freight rates between San Francisco
and Puget Sound cities.
The Stocktonian would ship ' his coal
from here in â¢ schooners, transferring in
San Francisco to barges, and thence up
the rivers into the interior of the State.
During a discussion as to the business
outlook in California and the fight that
State is makine to wrest itself from
Huntington's grasp Mr. Bostwick ob
served that San Francisco was los
ing -much trade and : business to Los
Angeles; that Huntington, by way of re
talliation for the fight San Francisco was
making against the passage of the fund
ing bill, was doing what he could to boom
the Southern metropolis.
When asited what he thought of the out
look for defeating the funding scheme,
Mr. Bostwick declared that it would be
much more favorable if there were not so
many Congressmen for sale.
CRAZED BY APORTLAXD CRIME.
The Widow of Murdered George Sayres
Sent to an" Asylum.
PORTLAND, Ok.. April 4.â Mrs. Maria
Sayres, the widow of ; George M. Sayres,
who was murdered by "Bunko" Kelly,
was committed to an insane. asylum to
j day. The cause of insanity is said to have
been the murder of her husband. The
death of her husband was a grievous blow
to her and unbalanced her mind. Â
â¢ She hears voices and â  says ; she is under
the advice of l spirits, and she is sleepless
and excitable. Mrs. Sayres has also wor
ried over the suit of the late George W.
Sayres against William 0. Allen, on ac
count of the Southern Portland Brick Com
pany, to recover about $8000.
It was to prevent Sayres from appearing
in the suit, that his murder was planned
and executed. Mrs. Sayres was the. main
witness upon whom the .prosecution relied
for the conviction of "Bunko" Kelly, and
now, should the assassin be granted a new
trial, his chances for light sentence would
be greatly enhanced because of the widow's
insanity. Lawyer X. N. Steeves. the chief
conspirator in this murder, is yet lying in
the county jail, pending a new trial,
Mrs. Sayres' .. insanity will . also aid .his
case. At . his i first ;. trial, â¢ Mrs. Sayres con
tributed * the preponderance of testimony
leading to his conviction of manslaughter;

Evangelist Adams at the Head
of a Unique Religious
Movement.
Preachers and Good Vocalists to Visit
Remote Sections of the State
in Wagons. *
SAN JOSE. Cal., April Rev. H. E.
Adams, an evangelist who resides in this
city, has inaugurated a new religious
movement, to be known as the Gospel
Wagon Mission. It will be similar to the
chapel-car work carried on by the Baptists.
Each wagon will carry two workers, one
of whom must be a good singer and able
to play on some instrument, and all needed
helps, as papers, Bibles, pictures, prints,
etc., will be carried along.
Mr. Adams estimates ' that there are
360,000 people living in sections of this
State that have no religious privileges,
and it is to reach this class that the wagon
mission has been organized. It is expected
that at least forty wagons will be touring
the remote sections of the State in a shore
time.
A meeting of those interested in the
movement will be held to-morrow even

. About four months ago Jones purchased
a team from P. H. Boggs in Stockton,
agreeing to pay for it in monthly install
ments of $20. A few weeks afterward
Jones went to Livermore, whence he sub
sequently sent Boggs $10 on account.
Jones sold the team to Washburn for $30
about two months ago and came to this
city. As soon as Botgs heard of the sale
of the team he began suit aeainst Wash

obtaining money under false pretenses.
He will be taken to Livermore on Monday.

the Attacks.
SEVERAL BATTLES RECENTLY.
Spanish Troops Hold Their Ground
Only Through Superior
Numbers.
HAVANA, Ctjba, April The rebels
still maintain their offensive attitude, and,
despite the announcement of Government
victories, they are the ones who make the
attacKs, though they are sometimes re
pulsed when they attack a superior force.
They attacked the town of St. Nicolas,
province of Havana, but were driven off
by the garrison there, which largely out- i
numbered them. They then marched to
Melena del Bur, in the same province,
which place they attempted to enter.
Again they were repulsed, but not before
they had set fire to a number of houses.
They then proceeded to Guanabo, twelve ;
miles east of Havana, and burned the vil- !
lage, after which they went to Hoyo !
Colorado.
During the attacks it is said that five
women, two children and three negroes
were killed. Thirty-live persons were
afterward found wounded. The rebel loss
is unknown. Altogether 132 houses and
huts were burned.
Various reports locate Gomez near the i
border line between Santa Clara and Cania- j
guey.
In an engagement between Colonel Vas- :
quez's column and 500 rebels, the insur- J
gents lost nineteen killed and three
wounded. The fight lasted four hours.
An insurgent band led by Zayas at
tacked the town of San Juan de las Yuras.
The garrison made an heroic defense and
repulsed the rebels who burned several
houses.
General Casco of the Spanish forces re
ports an engagement with Jesus Rabi, the
rebel leader, near Bayoma, in the province
of Santiago de Cuba, in which seventeen
of the rebels were killed. The Spaniards
had fifteen wounded. General Gaso also
reports that Rabi attacked a Government
convoy escorted by a force of 600 soldiers
under Colonel Ruiz, going in the direction
ot Jiguanli province of Santiago de Cuba,
and the rebels were repulsed with a loss of

followers as a prisoner. The Spanish
troops sustained no loss.

General Melguizo's Cowardly Atrocities
Meet Itith Royal Favor.
HAVANA, Ccba, April 4 (via Key West,
Fla., April 4).â Here is a detailed account
of the latest feat of arms of General Mel
guizo, for which the Queen cabled compli
ments. One hundred and twenty-five men
reconnoitering the farm El Desquito,
owned by Fernandez de Castro, near
Baino, Havana Province, last Saturday 1
met two scouts of Aguirre's band. â¢ They
captured one named Pedro Potrillo, 60
years and colored. Though shot, he de
fended himself, and severely,, wounded
with a machete Captain Feijos, and ODe
lieutenant and two soldiers slightly, before
being killed. ...
Aguirre's column of insurgents arrived'
and the soldiers retreated and joined the.
battalion at Baino, remaining intrenched
during the night.
The next day General' Melguizo ad
vanced, 1500 strong, crossed the Rico Hbjo|
farm and killed nine unarmed employes
with swords. They went . to the Garrido
estate, owned by Gertrudis Pedroso, and
killed eight employes, all unarmed, among
whom was one child 6 years old, and one
13 years of age, and an American citizen,
Crecencio Gobele and his mulatto I wife.
Rita. The head of the six-year-old child
was entirely severed from the body. The
troops fired the cane-fields for the purpose
of driving out any Cubans in hiding. They'
atso burned a- fine stone dwelling worth
$25,000. _
Melguizo's official report stated that
eighteen insurgents were killed, the Span
ish lost a captain, seriously wounded, and
a lieutenant and two soldiers., slightly
wounded. Melguizo is the same officer
who commanded the troops that com
mitted the Delgado affair. The Minister
of War at Madrid cabled on March 31:
Knowing with satisfaction the feat of arms
realised by. General Melguizo of the Gallicia
squadron, her Majesty and " the Government
compliment him, regretting the serious wound
of Captain Feijos, to whom her Majesty concedes

gestions. . 'V:

SWIFT CRAFT FOR ; CUBAXS.
Remarkable Steel Steamer That May Fly
the Single Star. -.'
CHICAGO, 111., April 4.â A Washington
special says: In the shipyard at Alex
andria, just across .the' river from Wash
ington, is a singular looking boat, on
which the agents of the Cuban revolution
ists have Dad their eyes for a considerable
length of time, and now that there is a
prospect of their securing recognition as
belligerents there seems to 'be. a good
chance that the curious-looking craft may
yet fly the single star of Cuba libre.
The vessel is the steel steamship How
ard Cassard, which has been laid up at ;
Alexandria for the last two : years, and'
which has been a constant source of specu
lation to all the travelers on the Potomac, '
and especially to the visitors to Mount
Vernon. The ship lies at the present time
out of water, and as seen from the river
looks like nothing else so much as a gigan
tic knifeblade, for it is high and long and
thin, and if one can judge by its lines
' ought to move through the water with the
ease and rapidity of a swordrish.
Some little time ago rumors were afloat
that the Cubans had seen in this curious
ship the beginning of their navy, but they
promptly denied the stories, and it is only
within the last few days, on the eve of the
passage of the Cuban resolutions by Con
gress, that the fact has been definitely
established that active negotiations are on
foot, and that an option has actually been
secured on the ship in the interest of the
Cubans.
The Howard Cassard is an exceedingly
curious bit of marine architecture. It is
the result of a theory of a Baltimore man,
who believed he could construct a ship
which would be particularly well adapted
to tbe carrying of ocean mails, and which
would reach a rate of speed not equaled
by anything of its size and engine ca
pacity. The vessel is 225 feet from stem to
stern and has a depth of hold of 18 feet,
drawing 10 feet in the mean. .
The singular feature with this unusual
length â equal to that of the old type of
lake propeller the steamer has a breadth
of beam of only sixteen feet, and for this
reason when out of the water, as at pres
ent, it looks like a tremendous knife blade.
At first sight one would say that when in
the water the ship would certainly tip over
if one of the sailors stepped to its side ;
but further examination shows that it has
seventy-five tons of lead built into the
xnifeblade keel, which renders it thor
oughly safe.
The deck is of steel, curved over some
what after the style of the whalehacks, and
there are no upper works at all, so that
when a sea is taken aboard it runs off like
water from a duct's back. Every sixteen
feet there is a complete water-tight bulk
head, bo that the ship is divided into a
number of compartments, as a. result of
which it could stand considerable shelling
from a man-of-war before it would actually
go to the bottom. The boat can be had
for $50,000. The negotiations have been
carried on by Congressman Woodham of
Chicago. '

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 4.â Gregor
Kransnow, a Russian nihilist who is al
leged to have been implicated in the plot
that resulted in the assassination of Alex- j
ander 11, Czar of Russia, sailed for Liver
pool this afternoon on the Belgenland.
He came here from Chicago, where he was j
known as H. M. Schyke.
At the time of the assassination he was
only 18 years old, and through powerful
influence was released on bail and after
ward fled. A brother, sister and three
cousins of Kransnow were also implicated
is the crime, and they were executed.
It is said he has a pardon from the new
Czar, granted in consideration of giving
information as to others who were con
cerned in his grandfather's death.
He was believed to have been dead, and '
thus succeeded in evading the vigilance of
the Russian police until recently, when he
became desirous of securing part of a for
tune of six million rubles lef,t by his fa- I
ther, and applied for a pardon, which was
given him with a position in the Russian j
secret service. .

ALARM AMONG
THE DIPLOMATS
Germany's Peculiar Policy
Is Causing Considerable
Uneasiness.
VACILLATION DEPLORED
._ Â«
Absolute Friendliness Toward
England the Latest Attitude
of the Emperor.
TANGLED TRANSVAAL AFFAIRS
Duels Declared to Be Nails in the
Coffin of the Existing Social
System.
BERLIN. Germany, April 4.â A recent
development of the Government's policy
has created a feeling of serious alarm
within the German diplomatic circle,
where the tendency of the policy of the
Government is best known, while Mar
schali yon Bieberstein, Minister of For
eign Affairs, is inspiring the Cologne Ga
zette and the Hamburg Corresponaenz
to declare that the Government policy re
mains strictly the same as it was recently
proclaimed in the Reichstag. Well-in
formed opinion outside of Government cir
cles can only discern a deplorable vacilla
tion instead of the firmness and decision
which the Government authorities affect.
The Emperor's telegram of congratula
tion to President Kruger of the Transvaal
Republic, which was supposed to be a dec
laration of an anti-English policy on the
part of Germany in South Africa, received
the spontaneous assent of all Germany.
Now the Government has adopted a line
of absolute friendliness toward England
and is supporting the Egyptian expedition
up the valley of the Nile, and also seems
to be doubtful in regard to affording pro
tection to the Transvaal republic against
British encroachments.
The Hamburg Correspondenz, as quoted
in the North German Gazette, says that
Germany does not desire any protectorate
over the Transvaal, and adds that if Presi
dent Kruger makes an appeal to the
powers against Great Britain's coercion
Dr. Leyds, the Transvaal Secretary of
State, is in a position to say whether or
not that appeal would be in vain. Every
body who reads would accept it as an
nouncing the fact that Dr. L?yds has re
ceived no assurance that Germany would
actively intervene in behalf of the Trans
vaal should Great Britain attempt coercive
measures.
The North German Gazette gives equal
prominence to an article reproduced from
the Hamburg Nachrichten, Prince Bis
marck's organ, saying that the notion of
war between Germany and England on ac
count of the Transvaal republic is a mere
bugbear to be set up before the general
world, the situation offering ample oppor
tunity for German diplomacy to thwart
the English attempts to obtain a monopoly
of South Africa without resort to fighting.
These uncertain pronouncements, how
ever, do not meet the approval of the
press generally. The Vossische: Zeitung
holds that an English policy of adventure
in the Transvaal would unchain the
tempest and would certainly result in the
intervention of the powers.
The National Zeitung says: -'Great Brit
ain must accept the German view of South
African affairs or face imminent danger."
The Lokal Anzeiger predicts that a coali
tion of the South African States will be
formed against England which will result
in the interference of the powers. The un
ceasing feud between Fieiherr Marschall
yon Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, and Dr. Mibuel, Prussian Minister of
Finance, receives further ; accentuation in
the renewed attacks of the Foreign Minis
ter's organ upon Dr. Miquel, denouncing
his recent speech in the Herrehaus in crit
icism of the resolution passed by the Reich
stag adverse to his financial policy. Dr.
Miquel's opponents accuse him of inciting
Prussian antagonism against the imperial
measure by describing, how seriously
Prussian interests are affianced thereby
while the adherents of Miquel charge that
Count Posadowski-Weinar, Minister of the
Imperial Treasury, and Freiherr Marschall
yon Bieberstein are endangering the re
lations of the federated States by meas
ures restricting their financial liberty.
The inner side of the conflict is the ques
tion which of the two Ministers will re
tain power through the Emperor's confi
dence. Dr. Miquel, with a scheme for pro
viding the money which the Kaiser wants
for the purpose of increasing the strength
of the navy, has the pull. 7 ; ,.
Lieutenant yon Kettleshodt, who killed
Lawyer Zenker' in a duel near Potsdam on
March 26 and was thereafter arrested .by
order of the Emperor, has been released as
the result of an official inquiry into the
circumstances of^the_ meeting. The lieu
tenant has not been permitted 'to return
to his post as second officer of the imperial
yacht Hohenzollern, but the Emperor will
permit him to join the corps of marine in
spectors. Public discussion cf the death
of Herr Zenker at the hands of Lieutenant
yon Kettleshodt has - not yet abated. At
' Bantzen a few days ago Colonel yon
wane wade challenged a doctor named
Rohr for writing articles against the new
Saxon electoral law. General Schulz and
Colonel - Steindorff j waited upon Dr. Rohr
and presented the challenge, but Rohr de
clined to receive it, saying that he could
not recognize Colonel yon Schwanewade's

, In the same town this week Lieutenant
Lindermann had his leg amputated as the
result of ; receiving therein a ball â  from Dr.

while Lieutenant . Lindermann is lying *in

The North German ; Gazette reaches the
conclusion, from a study of the situation
in Cuba, that Captain-General Weyler will
eventually find himself quite unable to
fulfill his promise to suppress the rebel

SCHAEFER DEFEATS IVES.
Brilliant Exhibitions of Difficult
Shots Given by Both
Contestants.
The Game Ends With the Score 600
. to 534 in Favor of the
Wizard.
NEW YORK, N. V., April The sec
ond meeting between the "Wizard" and
his former pupil was, if anything, fraught
with more interest .tl an their first
game on Wednesday night. In addition
to the keen rivalry that always exists be
tween Schaefer and Ives, the doubt which
Schaefer has expressed of Ives', ability as
an all-round champion; and the fact that
the "Wizard" had Wednesday's defeat to
counterbalance, all tended to intensify the
fervor of to-night's battle.
The tournament will be continued in
Boston, commencing on April 14. The
cushion-carom game will be played in that
city and Maurice Daly will join the trio,
making it a four-handed game.
The sanie to-night commenced at 8:30
o'clock. Alfred de Oro, the champion
pool-player, was the referee. ' Ives won tbe
bank and gathered in a neatly executed
bunch of 48 before he broke down on an
easy cushion shot. Schaefer contributed 1
and then missed, failing on a draw shot.
In his fourth inning Ives gave, an ex
ample of his skill as a billiardist. Gather
ing the balls along - the top rail, he gath
ered up the points with startling rapidity.
His easy touch and the accuracy with
which he drove the balls down the table
only to bring them back at his will
brought forth several rounds of applause
from the audience. A loud cheer greeted
the scorer's call, and then the failure of a
simple draw shot sent the youthful cham
pion to bis seat. He had passed ; his first
wire, and when Schaefer missed with 4 to
his credit the score read: Ives, 188;
Schaefer, 15. .._- â¢' â¢' ;
Ives passed his second wire in the next
inning with a pretty break of 34. 'The
"Wizard" registered zero.
Four ciphers from the ninth to the
twelfth inning caused a murmur of sur
prise among Ives' friends. : v " '.'.-V.'il
With the aid of 22 in the ninth and 2 in
the eleventh inning Schaefer passed- his
first wire and the. score read: Ives 234,
Schaefer 102.' . *i ; . :;;. '
Ives added 33 in the thirteenth and then
Schaefer â¢ gave an exhibition of j fine play
ing. 'With position play of wonderful
quality he tolled; up a very high score.
"Nurses," "drives." "masse s^ots" and
"draws" followed each .other with unerr
ing certainty. - r i.--
A loud- cheer greeted him when he
reached the century. Continuing, :he
forced 76 - more before he tripped and re
tired with the second highest run of the
tournament l76â to his credit.
The score now showed Schaefer in the
lead for the first time for the game, the
cards reading: Schaefer 278, Ives 267.
â¢The youngster started off in the fifteenth
inning with a deep-set determination to
swamp his rival's lead. He kept the balls
-together by" fine position -tactics, and
showed that the Wizard's wonderful break
and consequent lead did not unnerve him
any; ' 'â > -
He corralled eighty-three before a long
draw shot beat him; he had passed his
third wire and passed Schaefer attain, the
score reading: Ives 350, Schaefer 278.
. Once more it was Schaefer' shot,, and
notwithstanding the balls broke against
him at first, he continued to score until he
had made 159, when he tripped, leaving
, himself in the lead i with . the score: Ives

HOMICIDE AT
SAN ANDREAS
George S. Washburn Shot
to Death by Benito
Lopez.
KILLED FOR A TRIFLE.
Murder Follows a Petty Quar
rel Over the Digging of
a Ditch.
GALLED HIS NEIGHBOR A THIEF
The Accusation Answered With a
Pistol Bulletâ His Slayer a Des
perate Character.
SAN ANDREAS, Cal., April 4.â George
8. Washburn, an old-time and highly re
spected citizen of San Andreas, was shot
and instantly killed here at 4 o'clock this
afternoon by Benito Lopez, a Central
American.
The two men owned property fronting
on a Jane in the outskirts of the town,
where both lived. Lopez has a well in his
lot, which overflows and sends a stream
across the lane onto the Washburn place.
Washburn took a hoe this morning and
commenced digging a ditch to turn the
water away from his land. Lopez came
out of his cabin and asked Washburn
what he was doing. Washburn replied
that he wanted nothing to do with Lopez,
that he knew what he was.
"What am I?" asked Lopez.
"You're a thief, sir, thief," was the re
ply.
This led to bitter words, which finally
provoked Washburn, who has become ner
vous and excitable from long sickness, to
raising his hoe and striking at Lopez, al
though the latter was several feet away
and he could not have struck him even
though he had desired to. Lopez turned
and rushed into his house, when Wash
burn resumed his work. Soon Lopez came
out again, carrying a 45-caliber Colt's re
volver. When Washburn saw him com
ing he turned and walked away, not wish
ing to have any trouble.
"Oh, you go away now," Lopez shouted
at him.
"Yes," replied Washburn, "I want
nothing to do with you."
Lopez raised his pistol and fired. The
shot evidently struck, for Washburn stag
gered. A second shot was fired and Wash
burn fell to the ground.
Several persons were watching the two
men, but had no idea that their quarrel
would terminate as it did. They ran to
Washburn's side and tenderly carried him
into his house. A doctor was sent for and
when he arrived he pronounced the old
man dead. Later an examination was
held and one bullet was found to have
struck the back of the head, just above the
neclc, inflicting a fagged wound. The
other struck high up on the arm, passing
into the body and striking the shoulder
blade; thence it glanced downward and
evidently pierced the heart. j^.;r
â¢ After the shooting Lopez quietly walked
into his house, placed his revolver under
the mattress of a bed, emerged again and
locked the door and then started for town.
On the way he met Constable Masterson,
who came to arrest him. . '. . .
"Well, Lopez, what have you done?" the
constable asked. â¢
"Oh, I shot old Washburn," he replied
coolly and unconcernedly. .
"Did you kill him?"
:â â  "Well, I guess so; I shot to kill." â â â â . v ;
"What did you shoot him with?" ' ", -
\ 4 iA" pistol, and a big' oneâ l meant to
kill." : .".'."'. > ."."';'â ' ,';.';' V:.;. |
7 Lopez is t a hard character, .; always in
trouble of some kind. A year ago he cut
a man. very badly with â  a knife during a
fight and be is under bonds at the present
time to keep the peace. Although he is a
Central American he was living here when
the first white man came to the county in
early days, following mining and later
becoming a woodchopper. Of late ho has
lived off the Bint of a small house he owns
here.
Washburn came to this county in 1854.
For many years he conducted a meat mar
ket. Owing to sickness some years ago he
had to retire from active business and has
resided at his home ever since.
He was a bluff, straightforward * man
and well j liked. â¢:. His . long sickness made
him nervous and irritable, which would
occasionally cause him to lose his temper,
but he never meant harm to any one. He
leaves a widow and two children, a daugh
ter living here and a son in San Fran
cisco, who i conducts . the Davy Crockett
saloon on Market street. His wife is
almost frantic with grief. : She was in the
yard at the time of the -.shooting and wit
nessed the tragedy. â¢

DOCTOR SWEANY,
San Francisco's Leading and Most Successful Specialist.
WHY
Do the sick people of San Francisco and vicinity crowd his
offices daily ?
BECAUSE
They have been advised to consult him by their former physi-
cians and friends who have been cured by him. Because
FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS, and the wonderful cures he
has effected have created confidence and delighted the hearts
of those who had struggled in vain for years against the ravages
of disease ; because nearly everybody has heard of his fame,
which is being spread not only over the United States, but also
among the medical societies of Europe; because DR. SWEANY
is not only a physician, but also a Christian and a philanthro-
pist, and everybody, whether RICH or POOR, receives equal
care and treatment, and no suffering human being is turned
away.

That fully.SO per cent of: the unhappy and forlorn who fill our
MADHOUSES are victimsof SEMINAL WEAKNESS, NERVOUS
DEBILITY and their kindred DO YOU KNOW that out
of every ten cases of consumption five can be traced back and
the origin found in SEMINAL WEAKNESS? Take heed and se-
cure proper treatment before it is too late, before you are be-
yond' medical and human aid. If you are suffering from the
effects of this terrible disease, suffering from early indiscre-
tions, excesses and unnatural losses, which rob the blood of Its
richness and the body of its animating influences, which en-
feeble the constitution and result in IMPOTENCY, PARALYSIS,
SOFTENING OF THE BRAIN and INSANITY; If you are tor-
mented with morbid fear and your days are passed with dis-
tressing thoughts of your diseaseâ then cast aside all false
modesty and place yourself under the treatment of this noted
specialist. His experience in treating such diseases has been
world-wide; he has cured thousands of others and he CAN
CURE YOU. There are, however, cases of this character which
are beyond medical aid, but. there are many more given upas
hopeless, simply because incompetent physicians have failed
to effect a cure. It is therefore a part of judgment and sense to
seek DR. SWEANY first, instead of squandering away time and
money upon the uncertainties of patent ' medicines and pica-
yune specialists. ; ,: .' ';;'.â¢"-: ;*â¢â¢" 'â¢'â¢"â¢; Vi : .'f 'C

created a sensation when the complaint
was filed, may be brought to a sreedy
trial by an order of the court made to
day. The plaintiff moved for an order to

take the depositions: Fred W. Gregg for
Mrs. T. M. Parsons of San Bernardino,
James H. McMillen for J. A. Flemming of

babe.
Mrs. Parsons is asked to tell whether or
not that is true, and to tell what she
knows, if anything, regarding Mrs. Daw
eon's general conduct. She is asked to say
whether she believes Mrs. Dawson to be

intoxicated at the encampment at Olympia j
in the summer of 1594.
He is also called upon to say whether or
not there was an agreement between him
self and Mrs. Dawson whereby letters were
pent to her through him and delivered by
him to her. If he knew whom the letters
came from, he is asked to explain.

Dawson ever came home late at night with
male escorts. If so, who? Did he ever
see her in an intoxicated condition? If so,
did he talk to her, and if he did what did
she say ? Did he ever see her loiter about
the street in front of the Vendome. and see
her joined by a strange man? Did he ever

PORTLAND ROMANCE.
Florence E. Homer, Alias Mrs. Lillie Strauss.
Wedded to a Man Who Lately
Deceived Her,
PORTLAND, Ok., April 4.â A marriage
license was issued in Vancouver, Wash.,
yesterday to F. H. V. Andrews and
Florence E. Homer, and the couple were
married in that city. This ends an in
teresting romance that has been the talk
of society circles in this city for a few
weeks past.
Florence Homer is none other than Mrs.
Lillie Strauss, well known in San Fran
cisco, who about two weeks ago was sum
moned back here while en route to the
California metropolis by a bogus telegram
announcing that Andrews had shot him
i self with suicidal intent because of love for
; her.
Mrs. Strauss returned from San Fran-
I cisco more than a month ago, posing as
! the lawful wife of "Doc" Adolph Strauss,
i who, hearing of her contemplated visit to
I this city, immediately left for San Fran
' cisco, taking another "young woman with
I him. Since then Mrs. Strauss has made
I no application for a divorce; hence her
I marriage to Andrews caused a sensation
! here.
Gossip has it that either she never was
j wedded to Strauss or she has committed
; bigamy. During the time she lived here
with Strauss she was introduced in good
' society as his wife, and good society is now
greatly shocked.
HIGHLANDS ASYLUM CASE.
Continuation Granted in the Habeas Corpus
Proceedings to Secure Judge
Huse's Release.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., April 4.â
The habeas corpus proceedings for the re
lease of Judge Huse from the Highlands
insane asylum have been continued until
Tuesday, April 14, as Attorney F. F.
Gallardo wishes to secure important evi
dence from Santa Ana, Santa Barbara
and San Francisco in support of his claim
that Judge Huse is the victim of plotters
who conspired to secure his property.
From Santa Ana he wishes to get the
expert| testimony of Dr. Hollister as to
Judge Huse's condition, and as the doctor
is ill at present further time was granted.
The evidence from San Francisco is said to
be of a sensational nature, and deals with
the conspiracy part of the case.
Dr. M. B. Campbell was on the stand
this forenoon and testified that he be
lieved it would be unsafe for Judge Huse
to be released, as he was unable to care for
himself in any manner whatever, and was
also dangerous.
Dr. Dolan, assistant medical director,
yesterday testified that he did not con
sider Judge Huse dangerous. .
It is the opinion of many leading attor
neys who have been watching the case
that Judge Otis will grant the release of
Judge Huse.

TOO FRIENDLY TO HUNTINGTON.
Free Harbor League Concludes That
the Congressman Can No Longer
Be Relied Upon.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April The
harbor fight is still the absorbing topic of
public interest in this city. The friends of
San Pedro and Santa Monica are up in
arms and are making the welkin ring with
the oft- repeated arguments in favor of
their respective schemes. The wires are
kept hot between here and Washington
with telegrams intended to stiffen the
backbone of California's delegation in Con
gress.
The San Pedroites have about concluded
to throw Representative McLachlan over,
it being claimed by them that he 'has
turned his back on the cause of a free
harbor, and is exerting too great zeal in
choosing the ignis fatuus of a $3,000,000
appropriation for a deep-sea harbor for Mr.
Huntington at Santa Monica, while San
Pedro shall be content with a much
smaller sum for the improvement of her
inner harbor.
Another meeting of the Free Harbor
j League was convened this afternoon, at
j which "San Pedro or nothing" was the
; slogan, and after various well-known free
harborites had expressed their opinions,
! some of them reflecting severely on Repre-
I Tentative McLachlan, the following tele
! gram of thanks was ordered sent to the
I three Representatives Ãowers, Barham
j and Maguire â who have stood firmly for
San Pedro, Mr. McLachlan being pur
posely snubbed, as being no longer to be
depended upon for loyal support:
Messrs. Barham, Maguire and Bowers, House of
Representatives, Washington: The Free Harbor
| League, at a meeting held this day, adopted the
| following resolution:
Resolved, That the thanks of the league are
â  due to Messrs. Barham, Maguire and Bowers
for the stand they have taken upon the
| attempt of C. P. Huntington to defeat the will
' of the people for a free harbor at San Pedro,
1 and we earnestly urge upon you to maintain
i your present attitude upon the matter until
: the defeat of the pending attempt to divert
i any portion of the approrriation to the im
j provement of the roadstead of Santa Monica
! for the exclusive benefit of the Southern Pacific
j Railroad Company.
Senator White was telegraphed to exert his
] influence upon lie House committee in
j favor of San Pedro and to admonish Mr.
i McLachlan to carry out the bidding of his
I constituents and remain true to his ante
election pledges. I also decided to call an
i open air mass-meeting for next Tuesday
I evening to passed suitable resolutions in
I favor of San Pedro.
While the free harborites are doing all
this the friends of the Southern Pacific
I are not idle. The Evening press has
I thrown its columns open to the advocates
j for appropriations for both harbors. Judge
; R. M. Widnev has taken up the cudgel for
Santa Monica and in a two-column article
tells why the people of Los Angeles should
work to bring about the proposition tele
graphed yesterday by Representative Mc-
Lachlan. â  .; ." 3'V:Â®V

PHOENIX LAWYER'S DEATH
Sudden Passing of Ex- Attorney-
General Churchill From
Heart Disease.
He Was a Prominent Member of the
Bar and a Former Leader in
Arizona Politics.
PHC3NIX, Ariz.. April 4.â Ex-Attorney-
General Clark Churchill died in this city
very suddenly this morning at 7:40 o'clock
from heart disease. He had been warned
by his physician that he was liable to be
stricken at any time, as he was afflicted
with fatty degeneration of the heart. To
all appearances he was in robust health,
and th announcement of his death was a
great shock to his friends.
General Churchill came to Arizona in
1877 and located in Prescott, where he
built up an extensive law practice. He
was a man of great force of character and
a natural leader. He was appointed
Attorney-General by Governor Tritle and
wan an efficient and painstaking officer.

MULTNOMAH COUNTY
POLITICIANS CLASH
Republican Factions Indulge in
a Rough and Tumble
at Portland.
STRIFE AT A CONVENTION.
Harmony, Finally Restored by the
Withdrawal of the Anti-
Simonites.
PORTLAND, Or., April 4.â One faction
of the Republican party of Multnomah
County succeeded in holding a convention
to nominate city and county officials this
afternoon, while the opposing faction has
set Monday as the date for its convention.
The political situation in this city at
present is probably unequaled. The ex
citement over the riotous scenes at the
primaries on Thursday was renewed by a
bitter fight waged in the convention hall
to-day by the two factions. The Simon
wing of the party completed nominations
late this afternoon, as follows: For State
Senatorsâ O. F. Paxton, Donald McKay,
Benjamin Selling and Daniel McLaughlin;
for Reptescntativesâ A'. N. Smith Jr.. D.
L. Povey, F. H. Allison, George H. Hill,
A. L. Maxwell, J. C. Bayr, F. I. Nichlin,
George R. Shaw, J. N. Davis and Solis
Cohen.
City officials were nominated according
to the Simon ticket. Resolutions were
adopted declaring the candidates pledged
to pass laws for retrenchment and enact
an election registry law for the purpose of
putting an end to future disgraceful pro
ceedings at the polls.
When the convention opened this morn
ing two chairmen, representing the Hume-
Minto-Frank combination and the Simon
clique, held possession and were at logger
heads for hours. Free fighting was in
dulged in all over the hall, and the con
tention was so furious at times as to lead
to promiscuous smashing of noses among
delegates until the anti-Simonites left she
hall.
OREGOX POPULISTS.

SALEM,' Or., April 4.â The delegates of

We favor an amendment to our State consti
tution providing for the initiative and refer
endum.
We protest against the policy of the Govern
ment in patenting to railroad corporations
lands along their lines, by which in many in
stances mineral lands are patented to said
corporations, to the great injury of the miners
of our State.
Wherefore, we demand that all mineral lands
in this State be exempt from the grasp of such

Charles Ducommon Dead.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 4.â Charles
Ducommon, one of the oldest citizens of
Los Angeies, died this afternoon: after a
short illness. He was a native of Switzer
land and crossed the plains to Los Angeles
by the southern route in 1848, establishing
the first hardware-store in the city.
During his long residence here he ac
cumulated a great deal of property and
was rated as one of the wealtuy men of
the city. For many years before a station
of the Government Weather Bureau was
established here Mr. Ducommon kept a
careful and accurate record of the meteoro
logical conditions, his data proving of
great value to the Government in after
years. He was married twice, his second
wife, who survives him, being noted for
her charitable work, in which she was
aided by her husband. Several children
also survive him.
A Death at Visalia.
VISALIA, Cal., April 4.â S. Z. Curtis,

TAR AND FEATHERS
FOR A SANTA CRUZAN
Liveryman Mace Terry Attacked
at Night and Severely
Clubbed.
FOUGHT OFF HIS ASSAILANTS
Partial Success of the Effort to Cover
Him With Pitchâ His Enemies
Known. . ,
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 4.â at
tempt was made at 11 o'clock to-night to
tar and feather Mace Terry, proprietor of
the Excelsior livery stable. In the struggle
that ensued Terry was badly battered, his
assailants clubbing him in an endeavor to
render him unconscious. Not more than
two men are believed to have been impli
cated in the affair.
Terry and his wife occupy apartments
over the stable, and were aroused by one
of the horses running loose. Terry went
down to attend to the horse, and, suspect
ing that some one was in a dark corner of
the stable, started back to get a pistol.
He had taken but a step or two when he
was struck on the body and an attempt
made to pour tar on his head. He strug
gled and the tar descended on his hands
and one side of his face. Then he was
struck with some hard instrument and
knocked down.
Terry finally reached the sidewalk and
i yelled for help. Mrs. Terry came down,
and soon a crowd gathered.
Dr. Knight, Terry's father-in-law, was
called and attended him, but Terry de
clined to talk of the affair. He said he
knew who attacked him, but refused to re
veal their names. A bag of feathers and a
bottle of tar and a cheese-cloth mask were
found in the stable.
Terry will recover, and his father-in-law
offers $250 reward for the capture of the
assailants. '

THE MISSION IN EARNEST
Mass-Meeting Last Night Ad
dressed by Prominent
Speakers.
PARK AND HIGH SCHOOL SURE.
Attorney H. T. Creswell Says the
City May Legally Purchase the
Cemetery Lots.
The Mission people turned out to the
mass-meeting last night in goodly num
bers and with vast enthusiasm.
The hall was crowded, the Thirty-fifth
Assembly Republican Club attending in a
body headed by the California State Band,
which played during the interims of the
programme.
Those on the platform were: Judge F.
W. Van Reynegom, H. T. Creswell. City
and County Attorney; Supervisor Hobbs,
John T. Dare. A. B. Maguire, G. D. Shad
burne. John H. Grady. Judge Thompson,
Rev. D. E. U. Church, Calvin Ewing, G.
L. Center, J. T. Daily, John Bolger. C. T.
Spader, Charles Clauson, A. P. Van Duzer,
J. I*. Hodcton. H. Clausen. B. Kelly, C. H.
Hedernark, John A. Lennon, H. D. Bun
ker and Daniel Kelly.
Judge F. W. Keynegom explained that
the meeting was one purely of busi
ness. lie also congratulated the people oi ;
the Mission on the fact that they were j
awakening to the importance of interests
closer to their homes. Concluding, he in
troduced James Phelan as chairman of
the evening, who said: "I have a lively
interest in everything that affects this
part of the City, for the reason that I have
lived here for twenty years.
"When the mass of the people come
together and express a common want they
will obtain that which they ask for. The
Supervisors and tnose in power in this mu
nicipality will recognize that the people's
dearest interests are behind it all. There
is a demand here for a boys' and girls'
high school and we are going to have it.
Mr. Babcock told me in answer to a ques- j
tion of mine that our demand was by no
means unreasonable and that we fully de
served what we asked for. .
"We have here instead of a park a cem
eteiy. We are here to speak for the living
as well as for the dead. We should make
this path to heaven long and arduous.
The sight of the shade of death should be
banished from our eyes and in its place j
6hould be a garden spot wherein our chil
dren may play. We are only pleading for !
better things, and we only suggest to the !
Supervisors to take that extensive view !
which looks to the best interests of the '
pcoDle."
Hon. George D. Shadburne followed,
saying: "We have not gotten all we de- ;
tire, but as the old proverb has it, 'Ask
not and ye shall not obtain; seek not and
ye shall not find.' And now we propose
to keep on asking until we get that we so
much need. We have been sitting here
too long like the old man of the sea. We ;
have thought nature would do all we need.
We represent half the City's domain. We
must continue our present efforts with in
vincible determination and we shall suc
ceed."
Harry D. Creswell, City and County
Attorney, said that Supervisor Hobbs had i
been so persistent for a decision on the
question of legality in the City's purchas
ing the park that he had decided to tell
the people to-night what he had intended
to say some weeks hence.
"The act oi Legislature of 1889 regulates
the question," said he. "It is a question
that is deeply involved in the technicali
ties of law. Therefore I will not explain
my reasons for saying that in my opinion
the Supervisors can make terms with the
owners of these cemeteries, providing they
get for the city pood titles, and that they
may make a "special levy for the purchas
ing" of these tracts without a vote of the
people for that purpose."
This piece of information was received
with great applause by the audience, after
which Mr. Phelan rose to say that Au
ditor Broderick by a communication bad
promised to include the necessary sum of
money in his estimate for the next tax
lew.
John H. Grady, president of the Mission
High School Club, in the course of his re
marks said that the people of the Mission,
backed by such good supporters, would
surely get what they wanted, and that he
knew they intended to go farther than
pimply have a high school accommodation
in one of their grammar schools. They
intended to have a high school building,
and one as fine as any in the City.
Judge Van Reynegom read then the fol
lowing resolutions, "drafted by the com
mittee of arrangements, consisting of
Judge F. W. Van Reynegom, George Wal
rom, A. B. Maguire, Daniel Kelly and
John A. Lennon:
Resolved, That wo. the citizens of the Eleventh
V.'ard of sail Francisco, in mass-meeting as
sembled, do respectfully urge upon the honor
able Board of Supervisors of the City and
County Of San Francisco and the Board of Edu
cation the importance and necessity of estab
lishing in the Eleventh Ward a permanent
and suitably equipped high school for the
vropcr education 01 our children to fit them
for the higher duties of citizenship.
Resolved, That we further ask that the neces
sary steps be taken without delay to secure for
park purposes the two blocks of land lately oc
cupied by Jewish societies for cemetery "pur
{-. and bounded by Eighteenth, Twentieth,
liolores and Church streets. That said land is
the center of a large and crowing residence
district, now absolutely without any public
square or other park reservation where fami
lies can enjoy the benefits of such
breathing spots; that now is the only feasible
time to secure a public park in this portion of
Ban Francisco; that the place suggested is the
warmest and sunniest spot on the whole
peninsula of sat; Francisco; that it Is a place
where women and children can sit in the
â warm sunshine when all other parts of the
City are too foggy and chilly for the enjoy
ment of its public parks located elsewhere, and
that it is most picturesquely located for park
purposes.
Resolved, That in support of the foregoing
requests, we briefly call attention to the fol
wins; facts: That out of a total enrollment
Â«.i some 33,000 child:en in the public schools
â¢if San Francises, 14,000 would find a high
school at the Mission more accessible from
their homes than either of the high
school! north of Market street. That the
Eleventh Ward comprises two-thirds of the
whole area of San Francisco; that its popula
tion is above 70,000; that while this portion
oi San Francisco is paving taxes upon nroperty
assessed for nearly $100,000,000, it "has for
many years had less than 1 per cent!
of these taxes returned in the shape
of public improvements made in the ward.
Thai through the Eleventh Ward lv the only
outlet from San Francisco by land and, there
lore, it is in the line of necessary growth of
the City, and its great and growing im
portance demands present recognition in the
disbursements of municipal funds for the
development and improvement of the. City.
That the establishment of a high school and a
park, as above requested, will attract home
builders to their neighborhood and will bring
t d immediate increase to the revenues of the
City in taxes upon increased property values.
?.. totted. That copies of these resolutions be
furnished to the Board of Supervisors and the
Board of Education of the City and County of
him Francisco.
Supervisor Hobbs expressed himself as
being emphatically in favor of both high
school and park, and said the proposition
would never lack a supporter so long as he
had a voice in the matter.
John T. Dare said thai tbe people of the
Mission had been sleeping for thirty years
and it was now time that they awake.
"The Mission," said he, "is the location
favored by nature of thia City and deserves
all and far more than you ask for it."
Rev. E. B. Church heartily indorsed
what had been said and A. P. Van Duzer,
secretary of the Mission Defense Club,""- In
formed the people that they were going to
have the park and high school anyway.
"We raise cne-fourth of the children
here," he said, "and that alone demands
the privileges we desire."
Communications were read from Mayor
Sutro, Dr. C. A. Clinton, H. C. Henderson,
executive committee of the Folsom-street
Improvement Club, A. Compte Jr., E. R.
Barrett. Joseph I. Taohey, J. Richard
Freud and E. E. Taylor.
. T. A. Rottanzi. the eloquent leader of
tho Folsom-street Improvement Club, said :
"It is only by concentrated action that
you can get anything. If you are united^
and show your determination victory is
yours." _______________
OUT-OF-TOWN READERS PROTEST
! They Complain Because City People
Secured Most of Those low
Priced Dictionaries.
To say that the recent notable distribu
tion of the Encyclopaedic Dictionary was
a very great success is to speak entirely
within the truth.
It was originally inaugurated by the
Pacific Coast Newspaper Syndicate, to se
cure favorable publicity for the work by
placing 500 sets in that many cultured
homes, where they could he compared with
other dictionaries and encyclopedias.
Those dwelling at more remote points
were at a disadvantage, for by the time
letters asking for information had been re
ceived and answered, and before the final
application with remittance arrived, the
distribution had closed.
It is just these more remote communi
ties that the Syndicate especially desires
to reach, because the work, being at once
a dictionary and an encylopedia, has a
special value to those who do not enjoy
easy access to large libraries or reading
rooms.
Then, again, very many who have sent
in since the close of the distribution have
stated that if the Syndicate would still
furnish the volumes at the introductory
price of $1 down and $1 25 per month for
one year, the recipient would, take pains to
call the attention of others to the work.
Believing, therefore, that a further num
ber of introductory sets can be placed to
advantage, especially in somewhat remote
communities, the Syndicate has decided
to reopen the distribution for one week
only, and all orders sent in during this
time will be filled, it being necessary that
the application, if made personally, be not
later than 10 o'clock on Saturday evening,
April 11, or, if by mail or telegraph, that
the letter be postmarked, or message dated
not later than the day mentioned.
TO DIVIDE THE PICKING
Pleasanton Hop Company Will
Use Chinese and White
Help.
Experience in the Past Is Not Favor
able to the Exclusive Employ
ment of Either Race.
PLEASANTON, Cal., April 4. â The
Pleasanton Hop Company has entered into
a contract with Charley Fone by which the
latter is to cultivate and harvest the hops
on fifty acres of land lying adjacent to
this place and which is a part of the
Rancho del Valle. Fong is to have half
of the crop as pay for his work.
Last year the ladies of this place ob
jected strongly to Chinese help and offered
to furnish white labor if the company
made the change, which they finally con
sented to do. Labor Commissioner Fitz- I
gerald opened a labor bureau in San Fran- j
cisco and hundreds of , families were
shipped here. The result, however, was a
strike and the crop was nearly lost before
affairs were finally settled.
Charges were made against certain per
sons and there was an official investigation
held, occupying nearly a week, but noth
ing ever came of it. The company this
year decided to try two plans, for they
have also contracted with F. P. Earl and
H. R. Presbrey to - stake, hill, string and
cultivate seventy-five acres of hops for the
season at $11 50 per acre.

Petition. Being Circulated by the Web
ster-Street Business Men.
ALAMEDA, Cal:.; April 4.â The agita
tion of the Webster-street bridge question
has become general, and petitions in oppo
sition to tho abandonment of the pre sent
county bridge are receiving many sig na
, tures of the residents in all parts of Ala
i meda. The petitions are to be presented
I to Colonel Suter, the United States en
gineer, on Tuesday.
The chief arguments used by men who
are actively in opposition to the change of
route from Webster street to Alice street,
as already set forth in The Call, are that
enormous damage to] the West I End I busi
ness interests would result, and that the
construction of the new roadway to the
Alice-street , bridge would be â¢ a great ex
pense to the taxpayers.
There are many who openly advocate
the change from Webster street to Alice
street, but no action has yet been taken by
these.
Captain Chipman May Resign.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 4^â There has
been no settlement of the troubles between
Captain Chipman of Company G and some
of his enlisted men, and an investigation
will probably be made .â ": to-morrow by
Colonel Fairbanks of Petaluma and Major
Hays of Oakland, the latter being battalion
commander. ;â  As some of tbe men whose
terms of enlistment - will soon -. expire . are
sure to leave the regiment 5 if " the ; captain
remains, according to their own declara
tions, it is anticipated that Captain Chin
man will resign in order to prevent a dis
ruption, whether the assertions, in regard
to him are founded or unfounded. -

PRICE SENT TO PRISON
The Bookseller Found Guilty
by the Jury on Two
Counts.
BAIL REFUSED THE PRISONER.
___ _____
! He Sent Obscene Literature Through
ths Mailsâ Will Be S?ntenced
Tuesday.
j
Warren E. Price was yesterday found
guilty of sending obscene literature
through the United States mails on two
counts by a jury in the United States Dis
trict Court. The accused had been in
dicted on five counts by the United States
Grand Jury. His trial excited much in
terest, as Price had many friends who
made a hard light to save him, but the
evidence which Postal' Inspector Erwin
gathered against him seemed to at once
convince the Judge and jury of his guilt.
Price was remanded to the custody of
tbe United States Marshal and was locked
up in the County JaiL He will be sen
tenced on Tuesday next. Attorney Has
kell said that he would move for a new
trial and an arrest of judgment. Bail was
refused the prisoner.
The penalty of the crime for which
Price was convicted is from one to five
years' imprisonment and $1000 tossoooline,
or both, on each count within the discre
tion of the court.
. " Price took his conviction to heart. He
moved restlessly in his chair when the
jury came in and when the verdict was
read by the clerk he suffered a complete
collapse. He was " especially emotional
when a deputy marshal led him away to
jail. Price is rather a bright young man
and when on the witness stand he showed
an extensive knowledge of salacious litera
ture. The hooks he . sent to Postal In
spector Erwin in answer to a decoy letter,
inclosing a money order, and for which
particular offense he was convicted, were
of the vilest character and aroused severe
comment from Judge Morrow when he de
livered his charge to the jury.
Assistant 5 District Attorney Slessincer,
who conducted the prosecution of Price,
said "â  yesterday that it was not probable
that a new trial would be allowed by the
court. He said that the point raised as to
the sending of a decoy letter to detect vio
lation of the postal laws- had been upheld
by the United States Supreme Court as it
was the only means by which such crimes
could be detected. '

ATTEMPT ANOTHER GRAB.
The Southern Pacific Wants a
Pretty Big Slice of the
Water Front.
LAID TRACKS ON EAST STREET.
i
A Conflict With the Harbor Commis
sioners' Police Was Imminent
for a Tims.
The Southern Pacific attempted to make
another water-front grab yesterday. Act
ing under instructions, presumably from
Collis P. Huntington, a gang of men de
scended upon East street and proceeded
to lay railroad tracks.
The work was begun about 100 yards
south of the ferries, and nearly 30 feet of
the roadway was torn up before the State
employes discovered what was going on.
Then they descended upon the employes
of the octopus, and in a few minutes the
latter were put to rout They left a por
tion of the street ail torn up, however, and
Sergeant Jack Hayes of the Harbor Com
missioners' special police had to threaten
â¢ them with arrest before they would restore
the broken pavement.
In' the days of old the Southern Pacific
used the water front from Market street to
Mission 2 as a dumping ground for its
freight cars. The steamers brought them
from Oakland and the corporation used the
water front as a freight yard. When the
belt road was started the nuisance was re
moved, and the hay and lumber that used
to 'â  make East street hideous was moved
farther north. Latterly the Southern Pacific
has not had sufficient space in its yards at
Fourth ; street to handle all the freight
offering, and it came to the conclusion that
the cheapest way out of the difficulty was
to steal a portion of the State's waterfront.
Had it not been for the vigilance of â â  Chief
Engineer Holmes the chances are that the
scheme would have been a success.
â  As matters are at present the employes
of ; the ; railroad : are resting on their oars,
awaiting a chance to begin work. Sergeant
Jack , Hayes has a squad of men or the
scene, and they will remain on watch all
night, ' If ,an attempt ;is made to 'â â â . begin
work again all the workmen will be placed
under arrest and trouble will follow.
--â¢ "When ;I 1 asked the foreman of ; the job
what be was doing," said > Chief Engineer
Holmes yesterday, "he said he was re
pairing J the ? track. "; Now I know enough"
about railroad \ roadbeds to - know ' that be
I was telling me a > lie; The track that he
was ' at work ;on has ? not been > laid â  over
three months, and it was impossible for it
to be out of repair. : I told him he was go
ing to put in a switch, and finally he ad
mitted the truth of my assertion. - Then I
oidered him to stop work as ~, he .: ad re
ceived :no 7 permission â from 1 the ? Harbor
Commissioners. He ;â¢ refused and â  then I
called in ihe police. Of course, if permis
sion is obtained from the commission then
they can go ahead; but until that perm is-"
sion is obtained they cannot lay a rail on
East street or any State property.".
â  The Southern Pacific officials. deny that
they wanted to \ steal r any State j property,
but nevertheless, judging ', them by â¢ the
past. Chief j Engineer Holmes thought it
would be better to be sure than sorry."

IDENTITY OF THE
FRANKLIN BURGLAR.
Said to Have Been Jack
Dougherty, Alias "Pitts
burg Jack."
KLINE'S CLEVER WORK.
He Shows That Butler Frank
Miller Was Not a Party to
the Burglary.
ALLOWED THEM TO GO FREE.
The Burglar's Pals, "Dakota Slim" and
"Handsome Riley," Witnesses Be
fore the Coroner's Jury.
Harry Kline, private detective, and in
cidentally well known in Salvation Army
circles, thinks he has unraveled the mys
tery surrounding tho attempted robbery I
E.J. S. Riley, alias "Handsome Riley," One of tho Franklin Burglars.
I of the Franklin residence on the night of .
: February 14, when Frank Miller, the but
ler, killed one of the would-be marauders.
1 If Kline is right, then the police have
allowed to slip through their fingers two
; of the most dangerous criminals outside
! of prison walls.
! Tbe private detective claims that the
i man killed by Frank Miller was one Jack
: Dougherty, alias "Pittsburg Jack," and
further that his companions on the occa-
I sion of . the attempted robbery of the
; Franklin residence were Hayes and Riley,
the two men who attempted to implicate
j the brave butler. Kline contends that
i Miller had nothing to do with the robbery,
: and his manner of reaching this conclu
| sion is interesting, if nothing more.
: Captain Lees, it will be remembered,
' entertained the theory that young Miller
was playing â¢ a double game. When the
Corouer's jury concluded its investiga
tions, fully exonerating Butler Miller of
j any complicity in the crime, the venerable
| detective submitted to an interview, in
! which he expressed himself as follows:
"Now, I will review the whole case for you,
but I will preface it by saying that my private
opinion is that there is something wrong
about Miller. The questions I asked him when
i I caused the women to leave the Coroner's
! office indicate what I mean. Added to this, the
i fellow says he is only 19 years old, when, by j
| his own admissions covering J the time he j
i reached this country at 9 years of age he tray- j
; eled from State to State, he is more than 22
| years of ace.
He does not properly account for himself at
any time. It is a positive fact that on the
night of Tuesday, when he claims to have been
in bed in Franklin's house at 9 o'clock in the
evening, he was not there. The servant-girl is
positive of this fact, for she used Miller's room
in which to do her writing until late in the
! night, when she left because the place was too
â¢ lonely.
It was on this Tuesday night that the tramp
claims he met Miller on Kearny and Clay
streets, walked up to Dupont and down Sacra
' mento.
I want to say this about the tramp: His
statements have been corroborated in every
j respect. He and his friend Riley, another
j tramp, were begging on the street. Riley was
i half a block away from the other fellow, Hayes,
who was walking with Miller. When Hayes re
j turned he and Riley went to the saloon on
! Sacramento street where the tramps generally
I meet and get their soup and two glasses of
| beer for 5 cents. It was in this place Hayes told
i Riley and another man of the proposition
! made to him by Millerâ to go to the big white
! house at California and Baker: streets, where
j he was to sit on the back steps and get 'two
I bundles. .'.
This, remember, was told immediately after
I the conversation with Miller, and there was no
reason for this one tramp to lie to his friends.
1 He also produced Miller's note, which I have
; now, giving him directions how to reach the
i place. â¢
So as to make doubly sure that Hayes was
; telling a straight story 1 took two photographs
of Miller, one 1 got from Portland and another
'â  taken here. I mixed them with a dozen others
j of young - men who $ looted something like
i Miller and I asked Hayes to pick out the man
.who had offered him $5 and a suit of clothes.
He first picked the Portland picture and then
he picked the other one. - :
Better still, on the day I knew Miller would
go to the Coroner's office I had Hayes stand
around there to see if he could -.recognize
Miller when he passed. ; I remained fifty feet
away and watched the proceedings.: When
Miller came along Hayes knew him' at a glance
and gave me the agreed signal by raising his
finger.
At that same moment Miller saw Hayes and
was startled. ; He immediately drew his hand
j kerchief and wiped his forehead, covering his
I face from view... ;-. Â-.--, , --; ;â _,
As to the condition of affairs at the Franklin
house, I will say that llt is unsatisfactory.
There is no chance for any one to open that
kitchen door from the outride. L The hole made j
; in the wire screen and window would not ad
mit a child's hand. The carving of the 'other
kitchen door leading into the house â  was pur-
I posely done by an amateur, who cut it in a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1896.
bungling fashion and without any intent to
afford a means of reaching the lock.
The fellow Miller, in my judgment, must
have done all this himself and then tipped a
lighted candle over, so as to let the grecse drip
over the floor. Â
The remainder of the story can only be sur
mised. Whether Miller brought the tramp
there or not. whether he shot the tramp or the
tramp shot him must be solved by some one
else. There is one thing I believe, and that is
that, for reasons best known to himself. Miller
pinched the skin of his neck with his left hand,
drew it out and shot through it, so as to make
but a slight wound. The bullet went in and
came out within a space of a quarter of an
inch, touching nothing but the cuticle.
In making its exit, however, the bullet car
ried away the top of Miller's thumb. You can
see where the powder burned the skin and
face, which would naturally be the result if
the weapon is held close to the wound.
In the face of the doubts of the police
as to his honesty the Franklins retained
their confidence in the young butler,
and he returned to his work more in favor,
if anything, than before, and deservedly
soâ in the light of later developments.
He had been tested and proved himself to
be worthy of the trust. Of this Mr.
Franklin and his family were satisfied.
The body of the dead burglar was kept
at the Morgue for many days for identifi
cation. It was viewed by thousands, and
many times were visitors sure that they
could place the man, but in every case in
vestigation proved they were mistaken.
The body was finally committed to the
grave, and as far as the public was con
cerned the episode was forgotten.
There was one visitor to the Morgue,
however, who thought he recognized the
dead man. He had a friend who knew the
burglar, or a man very much like him, and
so the two repaired a second time to the
death chamber.
"Why, that is Pittsburg Jack," ex-
. claimed one of the visitors, and then the
two made a closer examination of the dead
I burglar, satisfying themselves beyond all
j doubt that the silent figuie was a tramp
known from one end of the country to the
other as "Pittsburg Jack." He was not
only positively recognized by the two men,
but also by his companions in the Frank
lin raid, both of whom stood before the
Coroner's jury, and under oath gave evi
dence that tended to discredit young Mil
ler before the public and his employer.
One of these was Frank Hayes, who tes
tified that Miller had on February 11 in
vited him to come out to the Franklin resi
dence on California street the following
evening, promising him $5 and a suit of
clothes. He produced a slip of paper on
which he claimed that Miller had written
directions as to finding the right place. He
was supported in his testimony by another
self-avowed tramp, who gave his name as
E. J. S. Riley, who testified that he had
been on the road since he was 15 years of
age.
While admitting that he had been under
arrest a number of times for vagrancy,
Riley claimed that he had never been
"pulled" for anything more serious. The
jury apparently placed little confidence in
the statements of these two men, and
i Miller was exonerate! by their verdict.
j Hayes and Riley went their ways un
i molested.
The details of the original identification
by the strangers and the two pals of
"Pittsburg Jack" were given to Captain
Lees, and on March 20 the facts and efforts
of the detective department to sift the
matter to the bottom were published. It
is now plainly evident, according to Kline's
statement, that Captain Lees and his as
sistants little dreamed that Witness Hayes,
whom they had found and fostered, and
bis compilable . companion were the
veritable two men on whom the searching
hand of the law was at that very time
eager to rest.
But Hayes, otherwise known as "Dakota
Slim," and "Handsome Riley," his com
panion, who had apparently been so
disinterested in throwing the light of their
accidental knowledge of the case and their
acquaintance with Miller, were partners of
"Pittsburg Jack," the unknown burglar at
the Morgue.
The police appeared to be utterly unable
to establish this or any other fact con
nected with the attempted crime.
Harry Kline, the private detective, en
countered no such difficulty. After weeks
of earnest, faithful labor, he is able to
prove beyond question that Frank Hayes,
alias "Dakota slim," and E. J. S. Riley,
alias "Handsome Riley," planned with
Jack Dougherty, alias "Pittsburg Jack,"
the man at the Morgue, to ; rob Banker
Franklin's home on the night of February
14. He is also able to show that these men
worked i successfully on many of. the rob
beries committed , in San Francisco during
the past few months.
; Dougherty, Riley and Hayes, according
to Detective Cline, were hard drinkers, and
for some ; time prior to the attempt to rob
Franklin's house found no little difficulty
in making - both Vends meet. Chinatown
stimulants were ; too frequently and con
tinuously indulged in to admit of. their
reaping the full benefit of , the many suc
cessful ventures which-- they made, and
they really were, as far as appearances and
visible means of support were concerned,
what they claimed to simply tramps.
â  , A successful < raid, . and consequent ' re
plenishment of funds, did not tend to im
prove - their personal appearance, i but
rather sent them a round : or two i further
down in the social scale. Flush and drunk
as long as the money lasted, and planning
a new raise when it was all gone, was the
routine of life with this trio.
. They were short of funds and ' in rather
hard lines just before the Franklin rob
bery and began to cast â  about for a good
place to strike. Besides Franklin's resi
dence was selected as promising good re
turns, and at convenient times the prem
ises were well surveyed, the obstacles] in
the way well noted and arrangements for
their removal made.
Hayes, as well as the other two, had
more than one opportunity of sizing up
Miller and the other occupants of the
premises whom they might by any mis
chance be called upon to face while at
their work. They were fully acquainted
with the habita of several residents of the
house and fully prepared on a line of ac
tion in case of interruption.
The history of the attempt and the fatal
ending for one of the party is still fresh in
the minds of the public. These plans mis
carriedâ"Pitts" died on the scene, Hayes
and Riley fled, but not far. They deemed
themselves safe in their usual haunts, and
it seems that they reckoned rightly.
While engaged in the preliminary work
the three men met and lost themselves in
the crowds that frequent Malloy's saloon,
on the water front between Mission and
Market, Forest's saloon under the What
Cheer House, on lower Sacramento street,
and the saloon at 637 Clay street, Their
going and coming was nobody's business.
Riley and Hayes called at Mr. Franklin's
office a short time before the burglary and
asked him for money, which they did not
get. These two generally dropped in at
the above-named places together about
dark and "Pitts" would afterwards join
them. The three were together in one or
the other of the places every day. When
the affair came off and "Pitts" did not
show up "any more his absence was re
marked by the habitues, and in answer to
a question from one of them Riley said:
" 'Pitts' has put up bis manicer for the
last time," meaning that he was dead.
Hayes, with an unexplainable foolhardi
ness or temerity, threw himself in the way
of the police with a story that seemed to
them plausible enough to' justify them in
attempting to incriminate Miller, and
offered Riley as collateral evidence. It
was a rather shrewd but dangerous way
to hide their own complicity in the affair.
But they were successful. Hayes was for
the while the hero of the hour a willing
witness, seeking to serve the ends of jus
ticeâwith Riley's help. The trial over
they hung around together some days.
Hayes showed up with $15 and a new suit
of clothes, and he declared positively that
it all came from Lees. Hayes finally be
came suspicious and concluded, as he ex
pressed it to a companion, to "railroad it
out." In any event he left the City and
has not since been seen. Riley left off go
ing to his old haunts, but still found it
convenient to remain in San Francisco.
Two days ago Riley became suspicious,
or in his own language, "leary of the
coop," and without notifying his friends
left for parts at present unknown. He left
with Detective Kline his . photograph,
which is here presented.
"Handsome Riley" has light hair and
complexion, is full-faced, 5 feet 8 inches in
height and weight about 170 pounds.
He was formerly quite well off and of
respectable connections, but gradually
went down until he became a confirmed
criminal.
Hayes, or "Dakota Slim," was an expert
cracksman. He served two terms before
coming to the coasts-one in Wisconsin for
burglary, and the last time in Nebraska
for robbery. His partner in crime, the
man who lost his life at the Franklin resi
dence, was considered a general all-round
man, his special business being to get rid
of the plunder. !
Summed up briefly the police force have
been grievously at fault in this particular
case. For some reason not just now appar
ent, .hey allowed two desperate criminals
to slip through their hands because some
one suggested the theory that Miller had
lured tne burglar to the Franklin mansion
in order that be might kill him.
WHAT FRANK MAYO SAYS
How He Came to Dramatize
"Pudd'nhead Wilson," His
New Play.
Speaks Highly of California, and
States That He Is a Victim
cf Dyspepsia.
"Well, sir, what is it you want to know
now?" said Frank Mayo, the celebrated
Californian actor, who arrived yesterday.
"I guess as regards my health, I appear
in pretty good condition, don't 1?" 'he
continued.
Certainly, towering upward in all his
six feet of magnificent manhood, his face
showing not a furrow plowed by old
Father Time, his large brown eves twink
ling as brightly as they did two decades
ago and his whole person enveloped. in an
atmosphere .of good natare and calm self
satisfaction, there didn't seem to be very
strong groonds for a coroner's inquest.
"But to be serious with you," he said,
dropping his bantering style, "though I
feel strong and well, 1 am troubled with
dyspepsia pretty badly, the result of too
many banquets.
"I am glad to be back in California
after years of wandering over the country.
California is the greatest State in the
Union.
"Pudd'nhead Wilson? Well, you know,
Mark Twain is one of my old California
friends. I met him in the streets of New
York about two years ago and said : 'Sam,
I want to dramatize one of your plays.';; -.;
" 'Which one do you want to experi
ment with, Frank?' inquired Twain.
" 'Pudd'nhead Wilson,' I answered.
" 'Go it!' he answered.
"The royalties were fixed and I started
forth. We have played in all the larger
cities of the Northern States and have
met with great success. I don't know
how it will take in San Francisco. I can
tell you after Monday evening. I hope,
though, it will be ; appreciated. Many
plays that have taken -well in the East
have utterly failed in this State.
"The 7th :of this month," interrupted
Mayo, "will ; be the first birthday of this:
play. My greatest success was in 'Davy
Crockett.' I played in that piece for
seventeen years. "When I quit and started
in on Shakespearian roles the public de
manded 'Davy Crockett' again."
At this - instant the ? conversation was
terminated by the entrance of Mayo's old
friend, Joe Goodman, who- is Mayo's
traveling companion.

BROWN CALLED
TO TACOMA
The First Church Pastor
Trusted by His Old
. Flock.
HE VIRTUALLY ACCEPTS
Surprising Outcome of a Vote
â  of Confidence and a
Protest.
BAY CONFERENCE MAY ACT.
The Reverend Gentleman at the First
Church Explanatory Tele
gram From Kalamazoo.
The following interesting dispatch was
received last evening:
TACOMA, Wash., April 4.â A secret that up
to the present has been well kept was the call
given by the First Congregational Church of
this city to its old pastor, the Rev. C. O.
Brown, who has a perilous time holding down
his charge In San Francisco.
A large portion of the congregation has
always stood by Dr. Brown durinsr the late
unpleasantness, and it was during the trial
that resolutions of confidence and sympathy
were drawn up by the church here and for
warded to him. This brought forth a vigorous
protest by telegram from J. W. Wallace, one of
the trustees, who was at the time in San Fran
cisco, and who urged that this action was pre
mature, and the council's verdict should have
been heard before such an action was taken.
This action of Trustee Wallace was taken up
by Dr. Hallock, and he threatened to discip
line Wallace for his utterances.
Nevertheless the resolution was sent, and Dr.
Hallock last Sunday morning , surprised his
congregation by handing in his resignation to
take effect at once, and claiming change of
climate was necessary.
Something had to be done, and Dr. Brown's
friends here, who are many in the church,
straightway proceeded to give him a call to
this charge, and he has a? much as accepted,
but just when he will commence is not stated.
Trustees and deacons all acknowledged to your
correspondent that such was the case.
Some 250 names have been secured to
the several petitions requesting the trus
tees of the First Church to dismiss Dr.
Brown. These petitions will not be for
mally presented until just before the
session of the Bay Conference, on April 14.
it 13 hoped between now and that time to
secure at least fifty more names.
It is practically understood that the
church officials will not take any action
looking toward the retirement of the pres
ent pastor, but as a matter of form a dupli
cate copy will be presented them.
The dissenting members look to the Bay
Conference for relief on the proposition of
whether the findings of the council raise
the question of Dr. Brown's ministerial
standing. This will be the issue, and is
not in any way dependent on the commit- i
tee on credentials bringing it before the
conference. Congregational usage admits
of any minister in pood standing raising j
the question, and several of the local cler
gymen have already signified their inten
tion of doing this very thing. They want
Dr. Brown's connection with the church to
be determined once for all.
The talk of Brown's resigning from the
pastorate of the First Church -seems to
owe its parentage to those who oppose
him. The minister has no intention of
leaving the chuch of his own accord, at
least not for some months to come.
"If Dr. Brown contemplated such a
move," said an intimate friend of his yes
terday, "I certainly would know it. Dur
ing the past two weeks some twenty-five
new names have been added to the church
roll. These people will not be formally
accepted until May, so it is safe to assume
that Dr. Brown will remain in charge until
after that interesting event. He would
not think of losing the prestige incident to
such a proceeding. Outside of this lam
sure that the reverend gentleman has no
intention of voluntarily leaving the
church because a few disgruntled people
wish him to. I anticipate that the Bay
Conference will take no action in the mat
ter and if it did it would be so much time
wasted. The congregation of the First
Church means to have Dr. Brown for its
pastor, regardless of the Bay Conference
or any other body."
Rev. C. O. Brown asks the publication
of the following telegram :
Kalamazoo, Mich., April 4.
To Rev. C. 0. Brown, 1703 Geary street; San
Francisco: Never heard a breath of scandal
against your name in any form while living
here. Lyman Gates.
David Merrill.
Dr. Brown said the dispatch was in reply
to an accusation in an evening paper con
necting his name with that of a servant
girl in . Kalamazoo. Mr. Gates was presi
dent of the First National Bank of
Kalamazoo and Mr. Merrill was head of
one of the largest flour-milling firms there.
Both were trustees of the First Congrega
tional Church, Merrill - having been presi
dent of the board for many years.
"A similar report regarding a school
teacher in Kalamazoo," added Dr. Brown,
"was published in a weekly while I was
residing there. It was disproved, partly
by my own efforts."
Dr. Brown will preach as usual at the
First Church to-day. Immediately fol
lowing the morning service he will organ
ize a Bible class, to be known as the
"Pastor's Bible Class." Future ministers
are expected to conduct this class on the
lines laid down by Dr. Brown.

The People's Home Bank. Director
Stoutly Denies Allegations of
Depositors Against Him.
Samuel K. Thornton, one of the direc
tors of the People's Home Bank, denies
the allegations against him in the resolu
tions adopted by depositors at a mass
meeting Friday night.
"The statement that I received certain
sums of money and retained the same
could only have been made by T. S. Wil
liams," he said.
"In regard to this money the facts are as
follows: After the board had held over
twenty meetings from their election in
July, 1894. to January, 1895. a resolution
was passed allowing each - director $5 per
meeting. The old members waived all
claims, myself among the . rest, to any
compensation prior to January 1, 1895, but
accepted compensation at $5 per meeting
for nine meetings, amounting to the sum
of $45. .
*. "This resolution was afterward re
scinded. I did not refund the $45 for the
following reason : I at my own ex
pense and time and for the information of
the board of directors visited the proper
ties owned and mortgaged to the bank in
the counties of San Diego, Riverside, Los
Angeles, San Bernardino and Tulare, and
had a map of a valuable tract in Fresno
County made for the information of the
board at a cost to me of $5. . .
"For the same services, less the map,
T. S. Williams while a director of the
board drew from the Dank the sum of
$108 25. I court the fullest investigation
by the Bank Commissioners or the Attor
ney-General of every act or vote of mine
in connection with the People's Home
Bank affairs and feel certain that I would
be indorsed as having done tbe best possi
ble for the interest of the depositors."
MARKET-STREET ROBBERY
W. J. Goring Held Up by Two
Men, Who Proceeded to
Rob Him.
Peter McGuire and Frank McCann
Arrested and Charged With
the Crime.
Peter McGuire and Frank McCann, tho
former stating that his occupation is that
of a laborer and the latter claiming that
his means of obtaining a livelihood is by
metal roofing, were arrested early yester
day morning at the instance of W. J.
Goring and detained at the Southern
police station on a charge of robbery.
Goring alleges that he was walking down
Market street on his way to his lodgings
when he was accosted by the prisoners,
who endeavored to engage him in con
versation. He says that he was paying no
attention to them when without a mo
ment's warning one of them sprang on
him from behind and held him while the
other proceeded to go through his pockets.
Goring shouted for help, and Officer
Cassin ana posse hurried to the scene and
placed the offenders under arrest. Wnen
searched at the police station nothing
whicti would point to the prisoners being
professional footpads was found upon
them. Upon being questioned by the sta
tion-keeper the complaining witness de
nied having lost any money, as he said
that he had none on him at the time of his
hold-up to lose.
The prisoners tell an entirely different
story from that given by Goring, and
claim that they were the assaulted parties.
They both say that the man who caused
their arrest came out of a saloon on Mar
ket street, and as soon as he caught sight
of them began to beat them with a slung
shot. Each man exhibits a black eye in
corroboration of his story, but as yet the
police are not. positive as to the truth of
these statements, and are looking for an
eye-witness.
Given Nominal Damages.
Justice Groezinger gave judgment for
plaintiff for $1 without costs yesterday in the
suit of T. H. Rood against Dr. E. J. Creely; the
veterinary surgeon. During the first excite
ment over Milk inspector Dockery's raids on
the milkmen Rood's name v.-as prominently
connected with the matter and he alleged in
his complaint that Dr. Creely had said that he
had talked of bribing the inspector. He sued
for $299 damages, but the court said in giving
judgment that he was only entitled to nom
inal compensation.
Thomas de Quincey is better known as the
"English Opium Eater." It is a painful
reference to the vice of which he was long
a victim.

NOW REPUBLICANS
WILL HUSTLE ON
One Busy Week, an Elec
tion Day and Then the
Convention,
KELLY-MAHONEY MOVE
These "Push" Politicians Talk of
an Opposition Steam-Beer
Primary.
THE PARTY GOES RIGHT AHEAD
The Iroquois Club Sends a Funding-
Bill Protest to Corgress
man Sulzir.
The coming week will be chock full of
Republican hustle and bustle. Many
more will take an active interest in district
and general party affairs throughout the
City, Republican club meetings will mul
tiply, and at various committee meetings
the important details of arrangements for
the primary election on the loth inst. will
be worked out.
It was largely a time of waiting with the
party until the issuance of the call for the
primary the other day. Now the gate is
opened for the rush. The primary is but
ten days off, and just a little ahead looms
up the State convention of May 5. The
life, vigor and interest that fills the party
and daily increases is both a sign of con
scious strength and a promise of success.
To-morrow evening the members of the \
County Committee from the Fourth Con- i
gressional District will meet to select poll
ing places, appoint election officers and at
tend to other practical election details.
The County Committee wiil hold a regular
meeting on Thursday evening, and after
that meeting adjourns the County com
mitteemen of the Fifth District will meet
to consider election officers. Election of
ficers and polling places will be named by
the committeemen for their respective dis
tricts, subject to approval by "the entire
district committees.
The district committees of the County
Committee will during the week hold
other meetings than those now set, it is
likely, and during the week the names of
election officers will be known, as well as
the names of most of the candidates for
State convention delegates from the vari
ous districts.
Since the issuance of the primary elec
tion call the Republicans of the City have
acquired increased confidence that the
election about to be held will be one of the
cleanest and fairest in the history of the
City. The voters, with the sole exception
of the small Kelly-Mahouey crowd, have
rallied to the support of the party's inter
ests, approved the policy which has been
strenuously insisted on by John D.
Spreckels and made a united local party.
It has now become indisputably evident
that at the coming primary all* factions
will stand on an equal footing, that excel- i
lent safeguards against fraud will be in
operation and thai the result will hon
estly snow the will of the Republican
voters in the various districts.
While in the Fourth District the mem
bers of the County Committee have acted
in perfect hsrmony, and while the re
spectable element there, the Republican
clubs, the aen of influence in the party
and the rank and file, are cordially sup
porting the regular party organization,
the proceedings on election day are likely
to be made more interesting by a rump
Kelly and Mahoney primary running
amid steam-beer glory from y a. m. until
6 P. M.
Martin Kelly and Jerry Mahoney have
. seen fall away from them most of the
friends inclined to travel with them on the
start, but they have decided to stay in the
ring and kick* up a little dirt anyway. The
Erimary will be run by Kelly and Ma
oney, assisted first by" Jack "iioev, Jake
Shaen and a few lieutenants of that sort
and second by that "Congressional com- I
mittee" created in Mahoney's hotel rooms !
at the snap Saturday night meeting which ]
Martin and Jerry rustled up in haste.
This Congressional committee was ap- !
pointed, it will be remembered, by the
votes of two of the eleven members of the J
State Central Committee of the Fourth '
District, one legitimate proxy and two j
forged proxies. On the strength of this I
action Kelly and Mahoney propose to I
assert that the primary called and regu- I
lated by the practically unanimous vote of i
the Republican County Committee and j
supported by practically the entire party !
is illegal, and they propose to hold a little
primary of their own and . send a contest- '
ing Keliy-Mahoney delegation to the State
Convention. Yesterday they began opera- i
tions. -â¢ . .-â¢-.-
Two friends of Martin Kelly' wen tout to '
Bee Registrar Hinton in the forenoon to
see about borrowing ballot-boxes. The :
Registrar consented on condition that the i
boxes be taken charge of by responsible '
citizens. That guarantee was given and a !
widely known citizen was called in and I
introduced to Mr. Hinton as the man who
would receipt for the boxes and look after
them. This widely known citizen was the j
notorious Jack Hoey of Brannan street
whose '-push" has for years run and dis- â¢
graced Republican primaries in one south- I
of-Market region. Great preparations are
being made for a steam-beer primary at
which Martin Kelly's old "push" will
vote as often as necessary.
WIRED TO SULZER.
The Iroquois Club Protests Against the sew
Funding Bill.
The Iroquois Club took another whack
at funding bill legislation Friday night.
During a discussion of the question of pro
hibiting the incorporation of family es
tates, participated in by President Charles
Gildea, Max Popper, Samuel McKee and
others, the funding bill was brought up,
and on a motion of Max Popper a tele
gram was ordered sent to Congressman
Sulzer of New York, who is the only Dem
ocratic member of the sub-committee
which formulated the new bill. The tele
gram sent yesterday was as follows:
Hon. William .Sulzer, Howe of Representatives,
Washington. I). v.: The Iroquois Club of San
Francisco beg you to earnestly oppose the
funding bill prepared by the subcommittee of
which you are a member. it threatens a fatal
blow at the prosperity of our State, perpetuates
the curse of a grasping corporation's rule and
it In direct violation of the platform adopted
by the Democratic State Convention of 1894
Lpon said platform we elected the present
Democratic Governor.
Charles Gildea, President,
I). M. Gordon. Secretary,
Max Poena, Chairman,
Resolution Committee.
On next Friday evening Max Popper
â rill address the club on "Good Govern
ment."
The Thirty-First.
The meeting of the Republicans of the
Thirty-first District will be held at Teu
ionia Hall, on Howard street, between
Sinth and Tenth, on Tuesday evening, in
itead of on Thursday evening, as was
irroneously stated yesterday.
The Railroad Blameless.
A Coroner's jury yesterday returned a ver-
diet of accidental death in the case of Patrick
Creedon, who was crushed between two South
ern Pacific cars on King street on March 28.
The jury decided that Willie Warde, the boy
who was killed on the Ocean and Railroad
train on Sunday last, came to his death
through his own carelessness.
CARVED HIS FACE.
George , Green, Well Known to the
â â -' Police, Has a Row With a
Woman.
George Green, a man well known to the
police, was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital at an early hour yesterday morning
with his face carved with cuts, one extend
ing from his ear to his chin. â¢
He refused to say who had cut him, but
it was afterward learned that it was a
woman who lives with him at 311 Grant
avenue. They had a quarrel, and the
woman drew a knife and carved Green's
face with it.
There is a case of carrying a concealed
weapon pending against Green in Judge
Conlan's court. A lew days ago he threat
ened to kill Policeman Webster for arrest
ing one of his friends, and went hunting
for the officer with a revolver in his pocket.
Policeman W. Dinan heard of it, and
meeting Green on the street arrested him,
and found the revolver in his pocket.
About a year ago Claude Lee, in a saloon
on Stockton street, had a satchel stolen
from her containing $7000 worth of dia
monds. Green was with her at the time,
and she accused him of the theft. The
following day, while the police were
searching for Green, the satcuel with the
diamonds was returned by some unknown
messenger and the case was dropped.
ALONG THE HER FRONT
Death of Captain William E. ,
Bushnell of the Steamer
Piedmont.
The Revenue Cutter Bear Breaks !
Down the Morning of Her
Trial Trip.
Captain William Edward Bushnell, the ;
well-known master of the ferry steamer i
Piedmont, died at his residence. 31 Fell J
street, early yesterday morning. For some
time past he suffered from cancer, ana all
efforts to stay the ravages of the dread '
disease were futile. He suffered terribly:
toward the end, and death was a happy :
release. Captain Bushnell was born in
Connecticut in 1822, and in September, !
1849, arrived here as second mate of the :
ship Harry Lee. A month later he took
commend of the Sacramento River steamer
Senator. From that time to a couple of
months ago he was master of river !
steamers and ferry-boats on the bay of San :
Francisco. The funeral will take place
under the auspices of the Society of Pio
neers, of which he was a member.
W. Hurley, a boatman, came near to I
' losing his life last Friday. When off â¢
i Mission Rock his Whitehall capsized, and !
I for nearly half an hour he hung to the â â 
j keel. Finally Chief Officer Charles Xeu
; green of the ship Falls of Halladaie saw
j his predicament and at once ordered a
boat lowered and manned. As tie was on
his way to the scene he hailed the San
Francisco Laundry's naphtha launch and,
senain>: his men back to the ship, went on
the launch to the. rescue. Hurley was
! about to give up when hauled aboard, but
! after he had been on the Falls of Ilaila
â¢ dale for half an hour he was as well as
ever. His boat was picked up, but he lost
the sail, mast and oars.
Captain Johnson of the schooner Pilot j
reports to the branch hydrographic office
lat Port Townsend that there is excellent \
'; fishing ground twenty miles north of Rose
j Spit, the northeast extremity of Graham
j Island; approximate position, latitude 54
, deg. 32 mm. north, longitude 131 deg. 35
j mm. west. Halibut can be obtained on
j these grounds during the whole year, but
I are more plentiful during, thesummer
j months. The fish vary in weight from 20
to 100 pounds.
John Wilson and Thomas Gillen, two
"sure-thing operators," were arrested by
Officers Shaw and Ellis of the Harbor po
lice yesterday. They were attempting to
bunco a farmer in a water-front saloon by
means of the old lock came and were ;
caught in the act. When searched a num
ber of counterfeit bills were found in their
pockets.
The sailing date of the Pacific Coast
I Steamship Company's Orizaba has been
; postponed from the sth to the 7th inst at
10 a. m. She will have an unusually heavy
I cargo and there will be enough left over
j to load the Coos Bay, which leaves on the
! 16th inst. " *Â
The revenue cutter Bear was to have
I gone out on her trial trip yesterday, but
when her engines were being turned over
the head of oue of her condensers blew out
and she had to be laid up. It will take
some time to repair the damage, and the ;
chances are that the cutter will not be able
to sail with the rest of the fleet.
In spite of all that can he said about the
: haidships attending a trip to the Alaskan
I goldhelds, the rush still continues. The
I barkentine Marion is now being fitted out, <
j and the 'tween decks look exactly like the
i 'tween, decks of the old '49ers, when the
I California gold fever was at its height, i
I The bunks are piled one on top of another, I
I and all in all 120 men are expected to find '
i accommodation. The fare is $50, and
every ojpe of the would-be miners expects
to make a fortune.
Private advices received by the Mer
i chants' Exchange report the" the loss of
l the well-known barkentine Modoc near
: Santa Rosalia. The crew was saved, but
j the vessel and cargo will probably be a
. total loss. The Modoc was from Port
j Blakeley with a load of lumber. She was
; built at Utsalady, Wash., in 1873, and was
| owned by S. B. Peterson of this City.
Mrs. J. Sohji, whose husband was a
. cabin passenger on the China March 14,
denies that he went to Japan to escape her.
According to her he went to see his folks,
and will return in about three months.
He will not bring back Japanese sailors,
and he and his wife never had any trouble.
They have been married two years.
CHOYNSKI COMES BACK.
The Doughty Young Boxer Brings His
Chicago Bride With Him to
His Native City.
Joe Choynski, boxer, wrestler and all
round master of physical culture, arrived
last night by the 8:40 train lrom Chicago.
He was met at Oakland â by his sister, his
brother Herbert and other members of the
family, Edward Greany, Mrs. Greany, and
a number of other friends. The chompion's
delight at seeing once more the hills of his
native City was most affecting. Standing
on the steamer's deck be supported his
lovely Chicago bride with one arm, while
with the other he indicated a number of
the City's landmarks which seemed most
endeared to bis memory.
On arriving in the City more friends
were waiting to receive him, and the young
high priest of the : manly art and his fair
iarty were escorted to" their temporary
quarters with every demonstration of wel
come. The champion now weighs about
162. pounds, and has , made 'quite a record
during his absence from ; home. One of
his last engagements was with Jack Doug
las, a powerful negro weighing 250 pounds,
whom he overcame in a' round and a half.
His successful contests' with Kid : McCoy
and Mike Boden are also among his latter
day contributions to the -fistic annals of
the country. On the 16th instant he will
meet Tom Sharkey at the People's Palace,
the engagement on his side being to down
bis adversary in eight rounds or less. The
contest is ; anticipated by sporting men
with much interest.

AFTER SKIMMED MILK
Inspector Dockery Is Rounding
Up the Creamless,
Cans Now.
Dairies Will Be Inspected Regu'arly.
Lawless Dealers to Be
Arrested.
The merry milk war begun months ago
by Inspector Dockery is still on, and the
dairymen who patronize the pump now
and then occasionally meet the official
with the tell-tale lactometer.
The objects of Mr. Dockery's close atten
tion just now are the skim-milk men.
They have contended that this fluid is not
adulterated, but is milk with the cream
removed and is sold as such. However,
the new milk ordinance reaches them, and
a number who are in this part of the trade
will be prosecuted. The wagon of Murphy
& Willie of the San Francisco cream depot
was overhauled yesterday with twenty
five cans aboard, thirteen of which were of
skimmed milk. The proprietors wiil be
arrested.
"Those skimmed milk cans have
caused us considerable trouble," said
Inspector Dockery last evening.
"When we found a load that
did not come up to the standard the milk
man would insist that the fluid was not
adulterated, but only skimmed. There
has been a great quantity of this weak,
almost warthless -stuff sold in the City.
There are several large ranches in San
Mateo County that skim most of their
milk, and they will find their business
running down, because I will turn every
gallon 1 catch into the sewer.
"Regarding the milk permits now being
issued by the Board of Health the object
is to get the real output and consumption
in this county. By this the entire busi
ness can.be regulated. For instance, if we
see by our books that a total of 70,000 gal
lons of milk is sold during a certain pe
riod, and also that 90.000 have been con
sumed it will not take the cathode, ray to
show up the 20,000 of Spring Valley fluid
peddled out in cans to the unsuspecting
public. V
"So restaurant and hotel keepers who
give their customers pure milk and who
desires to see the illicit milk business
broken up will fail to get their permit, es
pecially as it does not cost them a cent.
"But whether they do or do not the
Board of Health will not relax itsefforrs to
round up the thin milk dealers. lam out
about three nights per week, and will keep
it up indefinitely. Another piece of work
the board has mapped out is official in
spection of the dairies.
"Not a single sick or poorly fed cow will
be milked for the San Francisco trade if
we can help it. The dairies must be kept
clean and healthful and they will be con
stantly inspected."
The following-named restaurant-keepers
and grocers who have failed to procure
milk permits will be arrested next
Monday: S. J. Jancovich, restaurant and
coffee- saloon, 323 Washington street;
John Klunder, grocer, 101 Jackson street;
D. Swanson & Co., resiaurant, 8 Jackson
street; John Ekstrom, restaurant, 441 East
street; J. F. Offerman, grocer, 1421 Harrison

14 Sacramento street. S. Michaels, a dealer

A BUSINESS DIRECTORY.
How Numbers on Market, Street Will
Readily Be Located.
A curious feature of San Francisco,
and one upon which strangers in par
ticular comment frequently, is the pecu
liar manner in which Market street
is numbered. It might not , excite so
much comment if that street was not the
principal thoroughfare of the City, but as
many of the leading retail stores of the City
are located on this street, it is but natural
that curiosity and in many instances
confusion occurs relative to the manner in
which the numbers of the street are carried
out. Ordinarily ; the odd numbers are on
one side of a street and the even ones on
another and they alternate on almost
directly opposite sides: Not so, , however,
with Market street. For instance number
1026 is located on the north side, between
Mason and Powell, .while 1025, on the
south side, instead of being opposite, is a
block beyond, between Sixth and Seventh
streets, "in order to straighten out this
confusion in numbering F. B. Ges has de
vised a Market-street business directory,
wherein all the objectionable features of
Market-street numbering are overcome,
and it enables any one ;to readily locate
between what streets any particular num
ber on either side is located. This ' direc
tory will be much appreciated by .mer
chants doing business on this thorough
fare,'and it will ; no doubt make it a me
dium much in demand for the insertion of
business cards or announcements.

PARROTT BLOCK TIED UP
All Building Trades Men Re
sponded to the Call to
Strike.
OTHER UNIONS WILL FOLLOW.
The Council Instructs the Business
Agents to Make Another Effort
to Settle.
- The representatives of the Building
Council tied up the Parrott building
yesterday morning so far as tbe affiliated
unions were concerned. They took out
about 150 men on strike.
To-morrow about 150 more men will be
called out, the electrical workers, plumb
ers and cornice-workers having signified
their willingness to strike.
Hereafter every "struck job" will be
picketed.
The union painters deny that the Mas
ter Painters' list of those who refuse to
recognize the working card is correct.
THE DISTRICT COUNCIL.
Several Strong Outside Unions Will
Answer a Call to Strike the Par
rott Building To- Morrow.
The Building Trades Council held a spe
cial meeting last evening to hear reports
relative to the strike. The Shinglers'
Union and the Amalgamated Interna
tional Carpenters' Union sent delegates,
who said that their organizations were
ready to join in the strike.
The two walking delegates reported that
the Parrott building had been struck in
the morning and that every union man
connected with the Building Trades Coun
cil had responded to a man.
The electrical workers and plumbers at
work on the building toid the delegates
that they would strike the job if requested,
although their unions are not actually
affiliated with tbe council. There are
about 125 of these artisans employed there.
The business agents were instructed to
accept the offer and call these men out on
Monday morning; also to call out all
either union or non-union sympathizers
who will respond. This will leave, a wery
small force of workmen in the building so
far as can be learned.
The business agents and the grievance
committee were specially instructed to
use ever}' honorable means in their power
to bring about a speedy settlement of the
Parrott building strike"
The organizing committee was directed
to meet with the tinand |metal roofers on
Tuesday night, and with the tile-setters on
Wednesday night, at 115 Turk street, and
organize both trades, who will send dele
gates to the council.
The council will meet again on Monday
evening.
M. E. STANFORD SPEAKS.
i The Superintendent of the Perrott
Building Says the Strike Is
Unfair.
M. E. Stanford, the superintendent of
the Parrott building, as may be supposed,
is not pleased with the turn affairs have
taken. It was hoped to be able to open
the big compartment store within two or
three weeks, and the strike, he says, is
likely to interfere seriously with the ar
rangements. The Emporium Company's
manager, Mr. Feist, is no better pleased.
Mr. Stanford stated yesterday that there
were no union men at work in the big
structure. About 150 workmen bad re
fused to return to work. These were all
members of the unions affiliated with the
Building Trades Council. He stated that
the entire building was not tied up, be
cause about 200 men who did not belong
to. any union are still at work. Besides
those employed by Kuss, the painter, and
Bruschke of the furniture company.against
whom the strike was made, there was a
large force of laborers, ironworkers, elec
tricians, etc. The superintendent, in dis
cussing the situation, said:
It is a fact this strike will interfere greatly
with our arrangements. However, we will en
deavor to get along the best we can and finish
the work as we are able. I think the men were
not justified in striking the whole building
for grievances against two men. Now, take
Bruschke's contract. That is really furniture
work and fitting and has nothing to do with
the building trades or the construction of
building. If there had been any objections to
Mr. Bruschke the union people should have
protested in the start against the management
of this building letting out contracts to him,
but they never did, and although he has eight
contracts they waited until this late day and
ordered a general strike on the building.
MR. KERNS' POSITION.
The Contracting: Carpenter Says
He Is Neutral Upon the Ques
tion of Trades Unions.
F. W. Kerns, one of the contracting car
penters on the Parrott building, states
that his position toward the strike has
been misunderstood. His carpenters are
all union men/and when he learned that
the building was to be struck he simply
said that he would let his men withdraw,
because he knew they would do so whether
he gave his consent or not. - He will not
endeavor to resume work for a while, be
cause he is ahead of his wort to a great
extent, and if there should be any un
avoidable delay he could no doubt secure
an extension of time.
Mr. Kerns condemns the strike upon the
building and says that many of the men
who walked out have been actually de
pendent upon the work on the structure
to keep them from want during the dull
times of the winter. He further condemns
the order to strike the building because so
many friendly contractors who " employ
only union men are harmed for a griev
ance against two men in such a large es
tablishment. He added, "So. far as my
position toward the unions is concerned, I
will say I am neither for nor against the
trades unions." :3i|js|j^B4|fflfflg
THE PAINTERS' STRIKE.
President Rose Says the Master
Painters' List Is More Than
Half False. \*
. The union painters yesterday were much
surprised upon seeing the list of members
published by the Master Painters' Associ
ation as being opposed to the union's
working card. Committees were sent out
to personally investigate every shop and
learn .who are the enemies of the union.
Last night President Rose of the Painters'
Union said:
-President Black of the Master Painters' Asso
ciation published a list of bosses who, he said,
are pledged against the card. The list is false
with few exceptions. The article the bosses
signed was supposed by them ; to be an agree
ment relative to a scale of prices for materials.
That is, that the wholesalers should be charged
one price and the retailers another. Many
who signed are indignant that they Jhould
have been so grossly deceived as Ito the use to
which, their names were put.--. â¢â "..'â¢. â :â .-â 
J. J. Goosey, B. Bradley, J. ; \V. Luney and
others are ; particularly indignant, and some
have sent letters â to > that : effect to the : union.
Now this is the list of our friends whose names
were unproperly used in Black's list:
"' W. P. '/'Armstrong, W. T. Beck, M. J. Gallagher,
M. A. Maunder, William Noble. J.. S. Milton, T.

has not many left. We have another friend in

ARRESTED .FOR "GRAFTING."
Judge Conlan Proposes to Make It |
Interesting for Otto Kshn.
Otto Kahn, a waiter, has got himself
into serious trouble by "capping" around
the Police Courts, and Judge Conlan has
declared that he will make it exceedingly i
interesting for him.
Yesterday morning the preliminary ex- ;
amination of Harris Davis, C. A. Hobbs j
ank H. B. Skinner on the charge of :
burglary was to be held before Judge Con
lan. Â« The complaining witnesses in the ,
case are James Hill and John S. Tait, 126 !
Fourth street, and they had engaged At
torney Stephen O'Keefe to specially prose- j
cute the case.
O'Keeffe was having a conversation with I
Hill and Tait prior to the cases being
called, when Kahn interfered and told |
Hill and Tait not to employ O'Keeffe, but I
another attorney, mentioning his name. I
O'Keeffe at once drew Judge Conian's at
tention to Kahn's action, and the Judge
ordered Policeman Wagner to place Kahn !
under arrest for violating an ordinance of i
the Board of Supervisors specially aimed j
at "grafters."
MR. HOLBROOK IS FIRM.
Will Maintain His .- Stand
Against Coursing, the Board
Willing.
Says His Critics Dcn't Know What
They Are Talking Aboutâ His
Power Limited.
"They don't know what they're talking
about." '' - .
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
made the sweeping statement in a sweep
ing manner. He referred to the opinions
of Dorninick Shannon, J. H. Rossiter, John
Grace, A. Lorsbach, John Sammi and
others relative to coursing, published in
yesterday's Call. , - â¢.Â».
, "1 contend that coursing is brutal," the
gentleman continued, "and as lone as the
board takes that view I will arrest any one
found practicing it in the confines of the !
County. People who criticize my attitude |
forget that my jurisdiction is confined to j
the County of San Francisco.
"Coursing ha? never been tolerated in the |
County. Eighteen years ago some parties
tried to open a coursing park on Point
Lobos road, half-way between the old toll
gate and the Cliff House.. .They, were
promptly arrested, and promised to aban
don the plan. That was the first, last and
only attempt.
"Mr. Shannon talks about horse-racing, i
and asks whether I consider it humane j
sport. My answer-is to refer him to the i
court records for the case against Thomas i
Williamson and others, for unnecessary
cruelty in racing. His horse fell exhausted i
after he had gone under the wire. I prose
cuted Williamson, but Judge Low dis
missed the case.
"Mr. Shannon says I am mistaken about
greyhounds tearing hares to pieces while j
they are in a dying state. I can produce i
twenty witnesses to , prove it. He asked j
whether I think duck or quail shooting
brutal. That strikes me as a silly ques- j
tion. Ducks and quails have a chance for i
life. Hares have practically none. Be
sides everybody knows that the game he
mentioned is killed for the market.
"Rabbits are pests. Granted. So are
rats, but we arrested a gang of rat-baiters
at Haileck and Leidesdorff streets because
their sport was 'unnecessary cruelty.' Put
an end to pests, but do it in the most hu
mane way possible, I say.
"Mr. Hughes tells an "untruth if be says
I sent a deputy to stop the bluerock shoot.
My deputies are quite as intelligent and
truthful as Mr. Hughes and they will state
that they never received such instruc
tions.". >,! : .

1 STREAK OF LUCK,"
I A Mining Man FaCs Right on
His Feet in This State. j
â  Found Some Camps That Did Not
"Pan Out."
â
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS IX THB
world that will stand as landmarks as long
! as the English language is spoken, and not an
; Inconspicuous one is the typical Californian
; gold-miner. lie has fewer traits that leave a
disagreeable memory than most of the rugged
' types of the world; and he has more of the
i genuine manly spirit than most people who get
| lauded for their conspicuous bravery. Accus-
| tomed to face hard times as well as "the har-
j vest of plenty," he learns, without knowing It
I almost, to sympathize with the "weak and
I weary." And when things do not look par-
! ticularly roseate with nim he accepts the con-
j dition of affairs with a complacency that is
matchless as well as admirable. One of the
i younger men who to-day are to be found try-
i ing to carve out for themselves "name and
! fame" in the mines is Mr. A. Burton, who is
now In the great gold-bearing section of Grass
Valley. Mr. Burton is an honest, good-natured
: fellow. He has had nis share of misfortune,
\ too, and when a few months ago he was stricken
right in the middle of his work with a most
dangerous disease it seemed as though fate had
determined to "down him." But he imme-
diately "struck out" for the Hudson Medical
Institute, the institution which has become so
! famous on account of the wonderfully clever
; work of the specialists practicing there, and as
a result he is back at work again, and thank-
j ful for what has been done for him. He has
written as follows to the managers:
GRASS VALLEY, Cal.. Aug. 16, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute. San Francisco, Cal.â
Gentlemen: I have received three letters from
you which were sent to Downieville. I I have been
to Gold alley and to Nevada and through nearly
all the mining camps ever since, and that was the
reason that I did not set my mall before. The
medicine that 1 toot did mf lots of good, and I
Shall soon send for some more. Yours respect*
fully, A. BURTON".
So although Mr. Burton has not "struck It
very rich" in the mining camps recently ha
certainly made no mistake when he became
sick as to where to go. But every one has the
I same experience who applies to this "Mecca
for all the sick" for assistance. Thousands of
I testimonials bear out the absolute truth of this
assertion. For instance:
F. Minturn, St. Louis, Mo. : "I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the careful and
conscientious manner in which my case has
been treated by you."
S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles writes: "I now
feel as though I am a cured and a well nan."
K. C. Taf t of Stowe, Cal., says: "I am feeling
fine without a sign of disease now."
G. H. Bent : "By the time I get the medicine
taken that I have now I don't think that I will
need any more."
It is a satisfactory thing to see ell these, ex-
' presslons of good opinion and good will coming
In, as they ao, by the hundreds daily to the
physicians of the great Hudson Institute, af-
fording further proof that if you are suffering
from any curable disease there is no place
where you will get help so PROMPTLY and
SATISFACTORILY.

in the breeze at the close of yesterday's '
basket-ball game.
Stanford was triumphant.
' The girls in crimson sweaters and coquet
tish polo caps of tnat glowing color shouted
and cheered, embraced each other â yes,
and it must be confessed, cried with de
âwhen the score, "Two to four in
favor of Stanford," was announced. The
Palo Alto boys, who were modestly occu
pying corners in the hall and standing
just outside the entrance, tried to make
the welkin ring with their jubilation, but
the volume of sound wis so harsh and thin
compared with the unison of softer, sweeter
sounds: that they subsided into bashful
Silence, and contented themselves with
beaming admiration upon the fair athletes
aÂ«, flushed with victory, they walked with
free, girlish strides to the dressing-room.
The gallery of the armory at 25 Page
street was filled to the discomfort of many
of the spectators. Seven hundred tickets
were received by the smiling doorkeeper,
who welcomed all the beskirted repre
sentatives of humanity, but were inexora
ble to the trousered variety. All the
spectators wore Stanford crimson or
Berkeley blue and told. Perhaps there
was a fetching Norfolk jacket or golf cape,
a red wing in the bat, or a brilliant
Jacqueminot rose or spicy carnation, worn
toy the friends of Stanford, while knots of
flue and gold on hat or gown or wrflp
distinsuished the adherents of the Uni
versity of California. Then there were the
signalers or yell mistressesâ self apnoint
ed on the Stanford side, and Miss Marion
Whipple, Miss Lulu Finley and Miss
Olive Brownsill in the Berkeley arrayâ
who wielded wands gorgeously Bedizened
with the colors of the day. â¢
The armory was brave with its decora
tions in the respective hues, the railing of
THE NEW STANFORD CHEER.
the gallery supporting gay festoons. The
crowd beean to arrive at 2 o'clock and
a.te- pressing past tbe policemen on guard
and the doorkeeper, climbed to the gallery
and settled to its enjoyment. It waited
patiently until 3 o'clock, when the Berke
ley nine made its appearance.
The entrance of the nine finely devel
oped, blooming young women in white
sweaters bearing the mapic blue and gold
letteis "C. C." on the breast, dark blue
bloomers, natty gold belts, black stock
ings, shoes laced with yellow ribbons and
rosettes of blue and gold, was the signal
for a great outburst of enthusiasm.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! California! U. C. Berke
ley! Zip! Boom! Ah!" That was the
tuneful chorus, accompanied by a general
fluttering of gold and blue. The nine
â¢smiled its thanks and waited.
_ Miss Earn ham, the timekeeper, Miss
Celia Mosher, the Stanford gymnasium
instructor, Mrs. W. E. Maaree and Miss
Ada Edwards, who were to divide the re
sponsibilities of umpire and referee, and
Wo Stanford substitutes who were present
â . take the place of any crimson-wearing
sisters who might be "knocked out," filed
in and took their places.
There was that hush of expectancy the
novelist writes about.
The audience had time to take mental
notes of the ladies who were to discbarge
judicial duties. Mrs. Magee was slight
and blonde and alert. She wore a modish
blacc gown with a Persian collarette of
pink silk. She is the wife of Professor
Magre, director of the University ot Cali
fornia. Miss Edwards, who was to relieve
her of the duties of umpire the second half,
was ii black bloomer costume. She, too,
was keen and businesslike. Miss Mosher,'
who ia a good exeaplef of her art, wore a
comfortable gray gown, and, in honor of
the occasion, a red. quill in her gray â¢walk
ing-hat.
There was only time for these observa
tions before the Stanford girls entered.
They were not so tall as the Berkeleyites
the audience noted. The scales would
probably make quite a showing in favor of
the bine and gold team. But the wearers
of the crimson, were undeniably pretty
girls. Their agility showed in the supple
swaying of their bodies as they walked. |
They were also encouraged by a chorus of
cheers, the new rippling, "Tra-la-lal Tra I
la la! Tra! la! la! S-t-a-n-f-o-r-d," set to
an arpeggio gate a musical key to their
spirits.
Then the bearers of the crimson colors
did a graceful thing. The nine drew closer
together and upacomplimentaryshout
for the University of California. There
was a moment's pause and a bearer of
a blue and sold wand started the Stanford
yell. The students from the institution at
Palo Alto bowed a graceful acknowledge
ment. Mrs. Magee tossed the coin. The
Stanfordites won the choice of position
and the game began â the first game
played between feminine teams of rival
universities in the land.
There were twenty minutes for each
half and fifteen minutes intermission.
The playing began with a rush. There !
was no apparent saving force for a final j
spurt. A" well-directed throw sent the big '
ball toward the Stanford basket. Crimson j
and blue and gold mingltd in a wild rush j
in that direction. The audience held its
breath in anticipation of a football hurly- i
burly with resultant black eyes and bleed- |
ing noses. Not so ! The girls came out of the '
scrimmage cool and smiling. There was
no interfering. The rules prohibited any
personal contact or any running with the
ball. "When one side made a foul the
other had the right of a free throw. There
was consequently no loss of temper. One
girl spatted the ball out of another's hands
with what was mistaken for a pretty fem
inine show of auimus. But the rules per
mitted that.
Another looked a little resentful when j
she thought her rights in the mimic fray
had been infringed, but there was no re- i
semblance to the murderous expression '
seen in the eye of the victim of a football
"bunching up." In fact, the girls* held
their tempers admirably. Their faces
glowed with fun and ; exercise, but never
with anger. No locks . were disarranced
except by the vigorous movements of the
owner. The Stanford girls landed the ball
in their basket early in the first half. The
University of California girls took their
cue, and before the timekeeper announced
the recess they, too, had lodged tbe bulky
ball in its temporary resting-place. The,
girls of the blue and gold felt that the god
of games was against them. . ' ; ;
Three times the ball hovered over the
basket, then flew off on a tangent into the
arms or faces of the crowd. . Three fouls
were declared in the first half. | ' .; ' : , . t ,i. .
When tbe fifteen minutes' .respite came
the players hastened to their dressing
rooms. .'-â¢:;â¢>

battle was fiercely contested, every
inch of space being coin batted. Two fouls,
one on either side, were declared. Miss
Morley made another of her brilliant
throws. The ball rebounded from hand to
hand and found lodgment in the Stanford
basket. The battle was renewed. There
were fine plays on both sides. Captain
McCray and Captain Griswold directed
their forces keenly, and both sides rose to
the occasion. The situation was dramatic,
and the audience tense with interest
when â time was called.
Wild and prolonged cheerine from the
1 Stanford contingent, a dignified retreat by
the Berkeleyites.
While the dressing and chattering was
going on it developed that the two teams
had had practically the same amount of
training, except that Stanford had 'played
with other teams, while this was Berkeley's
first trial. '; . : ââ -.;. - .'.. . â  â  '>,:.
The bold, bad, curious young men were
in evidence occasionally during the game.
They tried to look through the glazed
windows, and once there was a hysteric
murmur that the armory boys were look
ing through the skylight, but.the police
men appeared and the boys melted out of
sight. Once a few. faces peered over the
half door leading into the gallery, but
were driven away by a" storm- of hisses.
. When the crowd broke up there was an
attempt to sing , the Stanford University
song:

AN UNEXPECTED VICTORY.
Fortuna a 40 to I Shot Defeated
the Hot Favorite Rey del
. . Bandidos. ; , .
CONTENTMENT WON EASILY.
Ted Slcan Threw Away a Race With
Sallie Clicquotâ Mt. McGregor II
a Fast Sprinter.
The racing at Ingleside yesterday was
interspersed with enough winning outsid
ers to suit the most exacting and' fastidi
ous racegoer. The wise brigade pinned
their faith to the favorites and they still
have their pins, while the once-a-week di
vision who delight in taking shots at the
moon went home with all kinds of money.
Of the seven first choices sent to the post
three only were successful in catching the
eyes of the judges first. Although a
windy and blustering day it did not deter
a big crowd from witnessing the sport.
- The biggest sort of a surprise awaited
the crowd over the result of the mile and
a furlong affair, when that semi-annual
winner, Fortuna, at odds of 40 and 50 to 1,
headed out the 7 to 10 favorite, Rey del
Bandidos.
The odds-on choice, closely accompanied
by Service, who was second in demand in
the betting, cut out the running to the
stretch, with Piggott on Fortuna trailing
them about three lengths away. Squared,
away for the' wire. Service dropped bacg,
and the outsiders began closing on the
Bandit King. A furlong from home, For
tuna was on equal terms with the big
chestnut and Slaughter drew his whip. In
the drive to the stand Peggott landed his
mount winner by a neck in the excellent
time for the distance, considering the un
favorable climatic conditions, of 1:55. Trix
was a distant third. There was a rambling
play on the winner, forcing his odds down
to 20 to lat post time. .
With the mount on the Bto 5 favorite,
Saliie Clicquot, in the seven-furlong han
dicap, Tod Sloan gave a repetition of his
stupid exhibition astride the odds-on
choice Mobalasca the day previous. Going
out in front with the Salvator man, Sloan
and his mount reached the stretch two
open lengths in advance of the bunch, the
nearest horse being the renovated Sister
Mary. While Sloan was enjoying a nap
Sister Mary stole up and in a drive won by j
a nose. The ring laid 8 to 1 against the
winner. 3Sk!Â§3N>(B3S
The two-year-olds were the first called;
eight of them going to the post for a four
and a half furlong dash. Rey del Tierra
was a pronounced even-money choice, but
only won after a hard drive from the 15 to
1 outsider, George Palmer, carrying the
Spreckels colors. Palmer hung closely to
the favorite from the jump, and as the
wire was reached was but a short head
away. The time, 55)' a seconds, marks a
fast performance.
. A five and a half furlong spin, run under
selling conditions, saw 'five fast sprinters
contest. There w as but slight difference in
the betting between Mount McGregor II
and Yankee Doodle, the former having a
very slight call at 2to 1. Toano was next
in demand, with quite a steady play on
the one-eyed Nelson. â¢ Â»
The latter got away well when the bar
rier was raised, setting a merry pace to
the bend for home. Below the furlong
pole he was passed by both the first choice
and Yankee Doodle. In a mild sort of a
drive Jones got the favorite to the wire
three-parts of a length ahead of the Doodle
horse. â¢" "â¢. ". ', â¢ V" - .- i ;
The fifth race brought together thirteen
selling platers \in a six-furlong sprint.
Doubtful was made an 8 to 3 choice, but
could never get to the front. In a hard
drive between Banjo and Don Juan, who
were always in the first flight, the "musi
cal horse" got the decision by a head.
The winner was backed down^from 7 to
4 to 1. .-,:::> :-i- Â£?
The 6 to 5 favorite, Bellringer, was badly
beaten in the mile and a sixteenth hurdle
event. Hello, the second choice, lea* over
the first three jumps, when he suddenly
became tired and Contentment, the only
horse in the race that was backed down,
took the lead and won easily.' Esperance
headed the favorite out for the place.
A six-furlong run concluded the : day's
sport. The 3 to 5 favorite, Goodwin 11,
led throughout and won : . driving by a
length from Paros, a 30 to 1 shot. â¢
Track and Paddock Items.
The Over . the Mountain handicap will
be run on Tuesday, April 14. The distance
will be six furlongs, and the nominator of
the successful ; horse will receive a first
class railroad ticket to the scene of the
racing operations in the East,
Among the novelties for the second
week's sport at Ingleside will be a revival
of heat racing.
There was a wild sort of a play on G. B.
Morris. From 100 to 1 his price was
rubbed to 10. He made a poor showing.
Had the distance been five instead of
four and a half furlongs, George Palmer
would assuredly have beaten Rey del
Tierra.
BRITISH SHIPS GIG RACE
Many Entries in a Race Over
the Long Bridge
Course. :
The Crew of the Ship Inchcape Rock
!i~f: " Is Victorious by a
. Length.
Seven gig. crews from the British ships
lying at anchor in the bay off Long Bridge
settled yesterday the much-mooted ques
tion of supremacy. For long they have
worried over the vexed problem .as to
which crew was the better oarsmen.
The race was held under the auspices of
the British Sailors' Institute and the Rev.
Mr. Pell acted as referee and starter.
The com se over which the race was rowed
was from the end of Long Bridge around
the bark Alexander, anchored off the sugar
refinery, and . back to a stakeboat abreast
of the Union Iron Works. All in all, the
course was about a mile and a half in
length.
Boats from the following ships took part
in the regatta: Arctic Circle, British Yoe
man, Cromdale, Ellesmere, Varajein,
Inchcape Rock and Balamere.
At the word "go" the gig crew from the
Inchcape Rock caught the water first and
got a slight start. The other boats started
off simultaneously, and a hot race ensued
to the turning boat, with the Inchcape
Rock crew a boat length in the lead, and
the others so well bunched that daylight
was invisible between.
A foul occurred in the race to the turn
ing point between the crews of the Vara
iem and Celtic Race, but little ground was
lost through it, and nearly all the boats
rounded the bark Alexander together, with
the Inchcape Rock crew still in the lead.
Coming home with the tide all the
crews redoubled their efforts, and a most
exciting finish was the result. But the
Inchcape Rock's gig proved the winner by
fifteen seconds, with the British Yeoman
second and the Cromdale third.
The other boats finished within half a
boat's length of each other. : â¢
A large crowd witnessed the race, prin
cipally friends of the apprentice boys and
of the institute. ' : : .v7'-' :^ : â ':â¢'.- â 'â ; â .'.'- .'â .
I On the bark Alexander, at the turning
point, was a crowd of the fair sex, who be
came very enthusiastic when the boats
started to torn and urged their favorites to
do their utmost to win. '
After the race was over the crew of the
Inchcape â¢ Rock boat was presented with
$10, and a sumptuous repast was spread
for them when they went aboard their
ship. ! â¢â â¢_--
The coxswains of the boats in the race
were officers aboard ship, and no j little
amount of interest was manifested, in the
contest. It has been one of the topics of
conversation around "lime juice" corner,
Battery and Washington, â¢ for the past
week.
The captains had their crews in training
nightly for the event, and quite a sum ot
money chan- ed hands on the result.
The outcome of this race will be another
regatta, to be held at Sausalito in- two
weeks, in which it is expected that the
crews from nearly all the British ships in
the harbor will take part. ' â¢ '
FOR THE NEW CHARTER.
The .Vigorous Propaganda That la
Being Carried On by the Mer
chants' Association. -
The Merchants' Association has decided
to request the Board of Election Commis
sioners to place the words "For the new
charter" or "Against the new charter" at
the head of each ballot during the coming
City elections. This plan, in the opinion
of the directors, will ; secure more certain
results than if the words are placed at the
bottom of the ballot. The charter issue
thus being made the first thing to meet
the voters' glance it is believed that more
of them will "scratch" either for or against
it. The adoption of the charter depends
on its obtaining a majority of all the* votes
polled, hence the solicitude of the associa
tion. Four thousand copies of Mr. Freud's
."synopsis'? have been distributed, and ar
rangements are being made by the associ
ation for the printing and distributing of
50,000 copies of the text of the charter.

Struggle for the Honor of Going to

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 4. )'
Senator Guy C. Earl has decided that he
will hold .primaries in the Fiftieth Assem
bly District. His reasons are clearly set
forth in the following communication
which he sent out to-day:
Oakland. April 3, 1896.
Messrs. John Mitchell, A. L. McPherson and
Frank Armstrong, th* members of the Republican
County Central Committee of Alameda Count)/,
representing the territory included within the B&
--tieth Assembly Districtâ Gentlemen: .As yon
well know, the Third Congressional District
Committee have decided that the delegates
from Alameda County to the coming Con
gressional district convention and State con
vention be not selected at a primary elaction,
but that they be appointed by the respective
State Central Committeemen representing the
Assembly districts in the county. By virtue
of this action, I, as State Central Committee
man, am authorized t. appoint the delegates
to said conventions front the Fiftieth Assem
bly District.. Recognizing that all power lies
with the people, it has been and still is my
judgment that the Republican party best com
mends itself by consulting the people in all
matters affecting the vital interests of the
party, and especially in the selection of those
wno are to lead in the contest against its po
litical opponents. , ;;*:*r, ? v â :â¢'â 
In the exercise, therefore, of the power to
select delegates conferred upon me by the Con
gressional district committees, I desire to rep
resent as closely as I can the wishes and choice
of the Republicans of my Assembly district, and
1 desire to obtain front them a definite expres
sion of their preferences as to the delegates to
be appointed. With that object in view I now
cordially invite you, the County Central Com
mitteemen, under whose control according to
party usage the primary election in the
Fiftieth Assembly District "should be held, to
meet me at my residence on Monday evening,
the Otn inst., at 8 o'clock, for the purpose of
acting upon this recommendation to call a pri
mary election in this Assembly district for the
selection of its delegates to the Congressional
district convention and the State convention.
There is nothing in the action of the Congres
sional district committee which in any manner
'. conflicts with this procedure and recommen
dation, and the National Republican Commit
tee has prescribed the test to be put at the pri
mary.
Furthermore, in the exercise of the power
given me, I will appoint the Republicans
elected at the primary election as the delegates
from the Fiftieth Assembly District, and will
accredit, them to said conventions with the
proper credentials. They will avoid any ques
tion as to their right and title to seats in the
conventions. This will have been chosen by
the Republicans of the Assembly district, and
they will also have all the ri.ht and title I, as
the State Central Committeeman, can. give by i
virtue of the action of the Third Congressional
District committee. ;â¢"..;-â¢
Trusting that this matter will. meet with
your hearty approval. I remain, yours truly,
Guy C. Earl.
The result of the meeting is being
watched for with much interest, as it is
not thought that the three County Com
mitteemen named are in favor of _ri
maries.
The Democrats are actively preparing
for the selection of delegates to the Na
tional Convention. There will be two del
egates from each Congressional district
and four at large from the State. In the
. selection of two delegates Alameda County
will certainly be given the choice of one,
while, owing to the big Democratic vote
polled at past elections, one of the dele
gates at large may also fall to this county.
The two candidates so far are M. J.
Laymance, chairman of the Democratic
County Central Committee, and Prison
Director It. M. Fitzgerald. Each repre
sents a different wing of the county Dem
ocraay, and the tight is lively though not
bitter.
The Populists of Livermore held a mass
meeting to-nicht and organized a cam
paign club. Sheriff "White and Professor
Adna Dennison from Oakland were among
the speakers.
SHOT BY HIS BROTHER.
The Lambert Boys Clear Others by
Confessing to Their Parents. ,'>â¢>.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 4.â Cassias Lam
bert, the 13-year-old son of C. M. Lambert,
who was shot in the arm Tuesday, has ad
mitted he was shot by his older brother
with a revolver they bad smuggled from
the house, as they left home under the im
pression that the boys who assaulted them
Monday might return.
The boys were so scared at the result of
their having the weapon and the wound
that they did not think of the conse
quence of such a story as they told. The
boys confessed last night to their parents, '
and the latter have been busy. to-day re
lieving the accused boys of the suspicion
wrongfully attached to them.
Mormon Choir Concert.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 4.â The Mor
mon Tabernacle choir special tram, in
which they come to Oakland this month,
will be made up of eight Pullman coaches
and one baggage-car. The train runs as a
special from Salt Lake to California ar.d
return, and in all its appointments will be
one of the handsomest the Southern. Pa
cific has ever run over its line. The choir
is the largest church choir in the world,
having 500 enrolled members, of which
175 come to California on the coming ex
curion. The parts are divided as follows:.
Fifty trebles, forty altos, forty tenors : and
forty-five basses. The choir will give one
grand concert here at the First Congrega
tional Church on Tuesday e/ening

Death of Oliver Hamlin.
- OAKLAND, Cal., April 4.â While un
dergoing an operation in the Taylor Sani
tarium yesterday afternoon Oliver Ham
lin, father of Dr. 0. D. Hamlin, suddeniv
expired. He was nearly 60 years of age
and for some years bad been suffering
from intestinal troubles.
His physicians, Drs. Dunn and Hamlin,
decided to perform an operation, and in
the presence of ten other physicians began
their delicate work. All was going nicely
when the patient suddenly choked and
despite all efforts to save his life expired,
ll.e doctors afterward ascertained that the
indigestible food had come up and clogged
the windpipe, shutting off his breath.
Returns and. Is Attached.. -
OAKLAND, Cal., April 4.â The missing
contractor, F.L. Hansen, returned home
to-day and was met by Sheriff White, who
attached his home for a bill amounting to
$6422, in favor of the Golden Gate Lumber
Company., He denies the story which was
circulated, claiming he left with only $12
ami that instead of making $10,000 to
$20,000 on his Presidio contracts he is
$20,000 out on the job. He claims that the
home is the property of his wife, being
built upon ground bought by her out of
the proceeds of the sale of . other property
thai was hers. .. : /
Complaint Under Advisement.'
â  OAKLAND, Cal., April The District
Attorney has : taken the application of
Albert G. Ainsworth for a warrant for the
arrest of Mrs. Alma A. Crowley upon a
char.c of perjury under advisement. He
thinks the truth or falsity of the allega
tion will, be proved at the time of the di
vorce trial, hence it would be unnecessary
to issue a warrant now.
left His Wife and Child.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 4.â Charles
Moone, a driver for the Sun laundry, left
his wife and little boy and decamped for
parts unknown yesterday. - He was short
$50 in his accounts as far as known, but as
he had large collections a closer search may
disclose a larger discrepancy.
No reason is known for his sudden de
parture. His employers believe he has
gone to Los Angeles.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5. 1896.
SCHOOL BONDS DEFEATED
Berkeley Citizens Vote Against
the Proposed $60,000
Issue.
PKEFERRED DIRECT TAXATION
A Special Election Will Probably Be
Called to Raise the Money
in Another Way.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 4.â The propo
sition to bond the town of Berkeley for
$60,000, to be expended in the erection and
equipment of certain new school-build
ings, was defeated to-day by a vote of 637
for to 423 against. The total number, of
ballots cast was 1065. As a two-thirds
majority was required to carry the elec
tion it was lost by seventy-three votes.
The loss of the day registers the second
defeat of school-bonding schemes in
Berkeley within the last three months.
Its defeat is attributed to the opinion
among many that the sum asked for was
too much, and that the plan of direct
taxation was preferable. J . :â 
The members of the Board of Education
are much dejected over the defeat, as they
have been working hard , to increase the
school facilities ever since coming into
office last May. Their only resource now ;
is to have a special election for direct
taxation called. Vi.- .. :
The day passed off very quietly, very
little demonstration on either side having
taken place. Only one polling-place was
used, the Kellogg School building having
been put into service for that purpose.
Following were the officials of the day:
W. H. Waste, inspector; Harry Greenough,
judge; J. Donohue, clerk. Â»It was 11
o'clock to-night before all the ballots were
counted and the result announced.
. Raymond John Rugs Play.
â¢:. BERKELEY, Cal., April The local
chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fra
ternity at the State University is ; making
elaborate preparations for the presenta
tion next Wednesday evening of a farce
comedy, written by Raymond John Russ',
one of their members.- The affair gives
promise of being a grand society event, as
1000 invitations have been sent out to the
various friends Jof- the swell college
brotherhood on both sides of the bay.
Many are expected also from the near-by
towns. The largest hall in Berkeley has
been secured for the presentation of the
production. The "D.E.K.'s" have been
practicing on the drama for the past two
months under the direction of Frederick
Belasco, and now all that remains to be
done before the play is put on is to look
after the 'make-ups." ' '
There was no stage, setting on this side
of the bay which would serve the purpose
of the performers, and consequently it had
to be brought from ; San Francisco. The
title of the â farce-comedy -is - the "Argo
nauts." Tne scene is local, San Francisco
being the central point of interest. ,:".,!;
This is not the first piece of play writing
which r Russ â¢ has â produced. -He wrote a
very successful i farce 'i for Z the junior day ;
exercises of the class of ',' '96, which were
held in '94. " Russ has shown himself to be
a literary man' of no mean ability along
lines other than that of play writing. ;
Five young ladies well known; muni-;
versity society will also take part in the
presentation of the farce/ " The play itself
will be somewhat in the nature of a satire
and some idea of its course may be gained
from the following synopsis: - "
John G. Talbot/ a wealthy , South African
mine-owner, unexpectedly returns to San Fran
cisco to look after his nephew, William Hub
, ard, who has hi come engaged .to the daugh
ter of his sworn enemy, the Â» late . Colonel Tre
lawney. His real purpose in returning, how
ever, is to look after his interests in the Clifton
will case. Clifton made two wills before
his deathâ the first leaving all his property to
his daughter, Margaret Clifton; the second dis
posing of his property to John G. Talbot. But
this secor.d will is thought to depend on the
position of a St. Lawrence river steamboat.
The mixing of matters in the will case
caused by Hubbard's impersonation of Borden,
the lawyer, the troubles of Talbot caused by his
masquerading as the late Colonel. Trelawney,
together with the financial love affairs of the
other characters, all of whom are directly in
terested in the outcome of the will case, "form
the settings of the dialogue. .- i < *< v' .
Following is the cast of characters:
William Hubbard (a college man), Willard D.
Thompson; John S. Talbot (a man of business),
Power Hutchins; Allen Borden (attorney for
botn sides of the Clifton will case), Howard P.
Veeder; the Rev. Demeritus Doremas'Sniyers
(a budding genius), Frank D. Stringham; El
liott Doolittle (a leader of germaus), George O.
Noble; Sir High Fitz Hugh Riley. Bart. Sterling
Carr; The late Timothy Trelawney, * 16th
Cavalry, U.S. A., Edward Blake; FitzpatricJi
Murphy (Riley's man), C. H. B. McLaughlin;
Mrs. Tielawney (an essentially modern
mother), Miss Agnes Duff; Dorothy (her
daughter), Miss Carmen Moore: Miss Clifton
(Mrs. Trelawney 's ward), Miss -. Florence
Green; Miss Eulalia Peabody (of the Peabody
Female Institute), Miss Lilian Strong; Mrs. W.

DEPEW AT THE
UNION LEAGUE.
The Great After â¢ Dinner
Speaker Appears at
His Best.
A NOTABLE GATHERING.
The Orator Blames Bourbon
Stupidity for Business
Depression.
LOOKS FORWARD WITH HOPE.
General Barnes, a One Time College
Chum. Is the Other Speaker
of the Evening.
Twojfecollege^ chums sat at dinner.to
gether,',in Maple Hall of the Palace Hotel
last evening. They were Chauncey Depew
and General Barnes. They were separated
by the portly form of Colonel Stone,
president of the Union League Club, and
radiating from them in the form of a dou
ble horseshoe sat 150 or more other Union
Leaguers. The dinner was given in honor of
Dr. Depew, and among the 150 were many
well-known San Franciscans who own
allegiance to the Republican party.
Given to the honor of Mr. Depew
himself, - the dinner was still a
political affair, for Dr. Depew's
active participation in politics, to the
point even ol more than once being
named for the Presidential nomination,
made it so. But the further fact,
of which he makes no concealment,
that ne is. in his present tour of the coun
try, championing the cause of Mor
ton, the choice of his State for
President, set the seal upon it, even
with the name of the Union League
left out. And-yet in this gathering of
distinguished Republicans at this
particular dinner the personality of
Chauncey Depew rose over and
above all. It was not Morton, but
Depew that brought them together.
"When Mr. Depew smilingly referred in the
course of his address to "the man that
I am shouting for" there was a general
polite burst of applause. But when
he referred to "Ohio bringing forward, as
she ought, the favorite of all," there broke
forth a lasting storm in the mere anticipa
tion of the utterance of McKinley's name.
With what political import there may
have been in this, the banquet of the year,
the deeper interest to those at the table
still lay in the fact that Colonel Stone had
the guest of the evening at his right hand,
while on his left there sat an old college
chum of this same guest in the person of
General Barnes.
Chauncey Depew was introduced as the
most distinguished American citizen in
private life. That was a thing very proper
to say. for Mr. Depew has long been so
recognized. ' i -;*; ;c;
His fame as an after-dinner speaker was
referred to â and that has stood up as a
monument in the land for many, many
years.
This is his first visit to the Pacific Coast,
and. therefore, it was natural that a deep
interest should attach not so much to the
dinner as the after-dinner speech of the
guest of the evening.
He fulfilled every expectation. Clear,
witty, pointed, full of ideas, flattering to
his hearers, and yet bold enough to trench
with graceful tact, however, upon doubt
ful ground, lie evoked a frequent and en
thusiastic testimony that he hud caught
his audience.
The delivery was graceful, easy and
free, . running with never an instant of
doubt as to the choice of a word, and with
no apparent effort at oratorical effectâ an
ideal after-dinner address.
He spoke for an hour, and while talking
sipped his first glass of wine of the even
ing.^
When he sat down the audience ap
plauded until it became weary, and then
rose to its feet and drank to his long life
and good health.
Then some one cried "Barnes," and the
cry ran round the tables.
"Let me make this introduction," said
Mr. Depew, rising ' again. "Forty years
ago, about, I went to Yale, a callow
youth with yellow hair falling over my
shouldersâ the very greenest man from
Peekskill.
"In the class just ahead of me, I discov
eren the shining light of the universityâ the
man who was to hold my attention, set for
me an example and show me the way. He
was already a recognized orator, and he is
one of the few men that in their college
days stand pre-eminent who fulfill their
promise in after life. 'â¢
"I refer"jto him who is now your fellow
citizen, General Barnes, my college mate
of forty years ago."
Then General Barnes rose up on the
other side of Colonel Stone and returned
the compliment in his own fashion. He
told the story of his friendship, ana how
he had come to the banquet this night
filled with eager curiosity to ; see
and hear the man who had been
his college . chum, and who, parting
with him at the college gate, had gone
into the world to become the most eminent
and representative of American citizens.
Then he followed over the path. that
Depew had taken in bis address, and. with
those strong, round poetical figures of his
quickened the pulses of his hearers until
the applause burst beyond all restraint,
and the audience .mentally said, "They
are a pair of them yet." -
General Barnes' address was one to
quicken the spirit of patriotism to the
uttermost, and his peroration brought the
audience to its feet perforce as it had risen
to Depew in cooler admiration.
The address of Mr. Depew was as follows :
Mr. President and fellow-members of the
Union League Club: Several of the gentlemen
as they came to-night into the reception-room
told me that they recognized me from my pic
tures. I wondered with the : vanity of a man
of my years if I , was like the pictures ln the
San Francisco papers. They certainly make !
me a contemporary of Noah a few days after
he had his photograph taken when released
from the art. _â¢; V* v - 'â¢
- Nevertheless I have had a beautiful time in
Sitn Francisco from the newspapers as well as
from every person in the town with whom I
â¢havecome in contact. It affords me infinite
pleasure to be here to-night as the guest of the
Union League Club. I belong to most every
club in which men of my size can be admitted,
â  but most of all I. value the . memrxT
ship in the Union League Club. I
belong to the Union League Club of
New, York, which I believe was the parent of
them . all. Some clubs stand for the social
element and others for other good things, but
MR. DEPEW AT THE UNION LEAGUE BANQUET. ; .
"This grand system of protection went on until we reached the time of our greatest prosperity.'
the Union League Club stands for nearly all of
those, and at least for some of them.
At least it stands for the principles of the
Republican party and good government. The
Union League Club as we have it organized is
the representative of no faction of the party,
of no machine which controls the principles of
the party, and of no boss. It stands every- :
where for principles which since the war
have made it what it is to-day, and which
makes it impossible for the party to secure the
nomination of a man unworthy to bear the
banner of the party.
Turning then to clubs in general. . Mr.
Depew remarked that Americans had now
become what he termed "a clubable peo
ple." Continuing, he said:
It speaks for the advance of civilization that
we have more clubs, in proportion to our popu
lation, than any other country in the world.
We are also a Nation of dramatic people, and
certainly there is no more dramatic country in
our landâ one that the great Irving might envy
for its magnificent stage propertiesâ than Cali
fornia. But, while you have here a sort of val
ley of paradise, you compel a visitor to get to
you through a worse desert than any by which
any other land is approacned.
After describing the physical inconven
iences suffered in crossing the Mojave
desert, he continued : Â«-* *
But when, at . last, I emerged into the coun
try where the verdure was upon the fields,
where the leaves weieupon the trees and where
the flowers were in bloom, in every bone of my
body I felt as if I had a' California boulder
which was not gold, and thereto open the pores
of the skin, which had become clogged during
our desert journey, a California mosquito got
in his work. But when I finally had become
clean and in my right mind, then I understood
what none in the Fast vet understandsâ
California is. â¢
He paid a glowing tribute to California,
its present and its future, and then refer
ring to the course of interviews to which
he was subjected, said :
I tried to rise to the local situation with such
possibilities as the English language affords,
and then for the first time I realized that there
are occasions where language is too poor and
wholly unequal to what a man wishes to
express.
Under the principles of government, that I
as well as the Union League believe in, Cali
fornia would drive Italy, Spain, Sicily, Algiers,
Africa, Asia and Europe out of prunes, lemons!
oranges, limes, olives, raisins and wine.* And
it would do more than that, it would bring the
people who are worn out with the climate of '
the East, and the nervous prostration of the I
East, back to health and vigor, With its ozone- |
producing air. And more than that, you would
eliminate one of the great dangers that the
medical profession most fearâ your seedless
navel oranges you have removed the possibil
ity of appendicitis. [Laughter.].
As I have said, California is unknown to the
rest of the Nation. You are a terra incognita.
I use that language for the benefit of mv old
Yale friend, General Barnes. He says he "talks
nothing else here. We know nothing about
you except your big trees, your big oranges,
nig bunches of grapes, big areas of land held
by some big men, big beets [Great laughter]
and deadbeats. But no one who comes
within your State anil sees what you have done
can do so without appreciating more than ever
the remark of Archimides, the great math
ematician: "If I could rind a fulcrum I could
move the world.'.'
The realization of that remark is probably
being demonstrated to-day in the vast forces
being gathered from the air and water in the
shape of steam and electricity. Yet as Arch
imides understood it, it was a fruitless re
mark. But the Californian can proudly say,
by paraphrasing the idea of Archimides,
"Give me water and 1 can feed and drink tne
world."
I never in my life have been anything but a
prohibitionist [laughter] in preaching and in
practice, â¢ except on occasions like this.
[Drinking from his glass.] I never before so
thoroughly appreciated the resurrecting pow
ers of good water. . The land that you | have re
claimed and the fields that you have made â  to
blossom and 'the ' hillsides that you
have brought into production by
the simple power of irrigation shows
what this State could, do under proper prin
ciples of government â under -proper protec
tion, [applause] and liberal appreciation at
home. [Applause.] Here. you arc as. large as
France, which is the richest ; nation in the
world to-day. notwithstanding her vast debt,
and which has 36,000,000 of 'people, while
California has on? 1,500,000. As I think
\ what you can be and look at what you are my
astonishment grows hour by hour that there
should be in this State any man with intelli
gence enough to be out of doors who is not a
red hot Republican. ' [Applause.] â¢' - 'â :.- d
It is singular how we not only roll around as
an earth, but how there are always cycles in
the affairs of nations and peoples and that the
remark is both trite and true that history re
peats itself about every so ten. It is given
to few people to make in proportion to their
ability in that line â fools of themselves. - I
would not have used that remark â¢ except that
I know you are all readers of Doestick. Â».<
Now. with us, we grow so fast and s our accu
mulations - are < so great that the experiences
of one generation are useless for the next.for
the next know, so much more than the one
which preceded it. And so it is that we have
twice in our history had a business experience
with the Government , which would . have
ruined any firm": and disgraced â¢ any manager
beyond the possibility of another job.*
The speaker then reviewed the financial
history of the country under the free trade
policy of the Democratic party in 1860 and
again in 1893, when, during periods of pro
found peace, the Democratic . administra
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL 5, 1896.
tion found it necessary to borrow money
in order to pay current expenses. Com
menting on this, he said:'
If there was an Individual or firm in busi
ness which had to borrow money to pay cur
rent expenses it would soon be in the hands of
a receiver.
As I look back at the experiment of the last
three years I recall the fact that this country
nas had the experience and Europe has had
the business. And as I think of my friend
Grover, who has created these conditions in
order to test the theory to which he is devoted,
I imagine in my mind that there will be ap
plied to him a stanza which came to me the
other day and which I believe was written to |
soothe a mother's sorrow. I will simply
change the name ''Willie" to Grover: : ; -
Little Grover from the mirror sucked the mercury
all off -. , .:.,>â -. â  -. ,
Thinking in his childish error It would cure his
whooping-cough.
At the funeral to ("rover's mother said Mrs. Brown
It was a very cold. day when the mercury went

We are not the people that we ought to be.
We have not the intelligence that â , we credit
ourselves with. We have not the education
which comes from a past . that is sufficiently
glorious. -i<i*.
Dr. Depew then' referred to tne'.pros
perity that . resulted- from the protective;
policy adopted by George Washington and
the protection Presidents, who j followed
him. lie spoke of the manner in which
Abraham Lincoln, by means of a protec
tive tariff, was enabled to carry, on the
Civil War to a successful conclusion, and
how the continuance of this policy
eventually wiped out the enormous; in
debtedness created during that trying and
costly experience. ,
All this he said" was accomplished with
out the necessity of laying one dollar of
taxation on the $70,000,000,000 of wealth in
this country. Continuing he said :
And so this grand system of protection went
on until we reached the. time of our greatest
prosperity. That time of prosperity was the last
year: of .Republican' administration ; and the
last year of Benjamin Harrison. [Applause.]
Referring again to Cleveland's adminis
tration, he said that it gave the country a
shaking up from which it had not yet re
covered, lie spoke in favor of reciprocity
as advocated; by Blame, and declared for
sound money on a gold basis so long as
the other great nations of the world were
onr creditors and declined to adopt a
double standard. Any other-course, he as
serted, would seriously injure the credit of
the Nation. He then continued as follows:
We are in a Presidential year, but the Union
League clubs have no candidates as individ
uals. They have preferences, but as organiza
tions they have no candidates. .
In the Democratic party the party, is chasing
the candidate, and the only man in sight is my
friend Cleveland.
But in turning to our side, what a wealth of
candidates there is! ; And the beauty is that
any one of them if nominated would be accept
able to the party. You can take. any one of
them. V."-
He then mentioned Cullom, Manderson,
Morton,. Allison,; Reed and McKinley.
While Morton,, Allison and Reed were
heartily applauded the name of McKinley
brought the banqueters to their feet, and
amid a wild waving of handkerchiefs the
applause became _ almost deafening and
wound up witn three lusty cheers for the
Ohio statesman.' Pausing until the noisy
enthusiasm nad died away the speaker,
with a touch of dry humor, remarked,
"We are all Republicans," and then con
tinued:
But it makes no difference whether it is . the
statesman you are ( now shouting for, or > the
statesman I am shouting for, or the statesman
lowa or New England is shouting for, we will
get there just the same.
Ana now, gentlemen, after two .weeks '-of
most enjoyable experience, both with the
natural attractions and with the hospitable
people of your State, 1 bid you hail and fare
well. â¢ . t . " ."" .. â-....

FOLLOWING BAD EXAMPLE
Why Louis Behrmann and Harry
* Steir Committed a
Burglary.
IMITATING THE OAKLAND BOYS
Behrmann Was Until About Two
Weeks Ago a Member of the ,
Salvation Army.
____________
Louis Behrmann and Harry Steir, the
two boys arrested Friday night on the
charge of burglary, blame their fall from
grace to a desire to follow the example of
Abe Majors and Bert Willmore, the boy
burglars in Oakland, which was engrafted
on their minds by the exhaustive reports
of their crimes that appeared in the news
papers.
They are both intelligent looking boys
and their faces do not give the slightest
indication of anything vicious, ; but rather
the reverse. Behrmann was a member of
the Salvation Army for seven months, and
it was ouly about two weeks ago that he
left the organization.
Steir's mother, a widow, has kept a
restaurant at Fifteenth and Mission streets
for several years. He is an only child ana
his mother has given him a fair education
and endeavored in every way to make a
good man of him. Her grief at seeing him
in a felon's cell when she called at the City
Prison yesterday morning \ was most af
fecting.
. .'â -â _ was born in this City," said Behr
mann last night, "nineteen years ago. My
father was a cooper by trade, and died in
1891, my mother following him two years
later. I attended the Longfellow Primary
School when I could, but since I was eight
years of age I have had to work and keep
myself. '.'-â 'â  â  t ..-- '
"About four years ago I answered an
advertisement put in the papers by Mrs.
Steir for a boy to help her in her restau
rant, and, got the position. I have been
working with her since then, except for a
few months when l was in the country, j I
got my meals at the restaurant and Mrs.
Steir paid my room rent. "
. "About a "year ago Mrs. Rodgers, who
keeps a lodging-house on Mission street,
not â¢ far < from the restaurant, where I
roomed,' blamed me for stealing, $15 from
her. I was innocent of the charge, and it
so preyed upon my mind that a few
months afterward I joined the Salvation
Army branch at 631 Commercial street.
"I remained there for seven months, but
two weeks ago last' Thursday, something
happened to discourage me, and I laid
down my cross and took up my evil habits
of smoking and drinKing again. ,
"Harry titeir had been reading all about
the boy- burglars in Oakland; and he sug
gested to me that we should break into
McCoy & Nesbitt's grocery, just to see how
.ye would feel. We had "both been drink
ing. Thursday night, when we decided to
break into the grocery, Harry got a chisel,
and we went to the rear door about half
past 10 o'clock. Harry forced open the
panel of the door, but he could not reach
th*Â» bolt, so I put my arm in and unbolted
the door. â¢
"We first went to the telephone box, ex
pecting to get some nickels there, but it
was empty. Harry went to the register
and opened it, but it was also empty.
Just then a. dog upstairs began to bark,
and we got scared. We grabbed ' some
packages .of chocolate and each took two
bunches of cigars out of a box and ran out
of the rear door. Harry went home and I
went to my room in the Winchester
House, on Third street. ;
"It is not true that there was $100 in the
register. There wasn't a cent. All the
cigars we took were the four bunches,
twenty-five in each bunch, and that wasn't
so very much. The police are trying to
blame us for other burglaries in the Mis
sion, but they are wrong. When I was in
the army money was stolen from the of
ficers' quarters, and they are trying now
to throw the blame upon me. 1 swear to
you this burglary is the only crime I have
ever been guilty of. I have always led a
"Christian life until now, and if I get out of
this trouble I shall never commit another
crime." - .. ~,' Y'/'-'- J
Ilarrv Steir is a round-faced, sturdy
looking boy of sixteen. He corroborated
what Behrmann said as to the causes which
led them to commit the burglary, and the
manner in which it was perpetrated.
"It was reading about the Oakland boys,"
said he, "that made me think of it. l'had
a dark lantern which I got two years ago,
and .'I- also made a mask, but we did not
take either of them with us to the grocery.
All we took was a chisel with which I
forced open the panel of the door. The
police found the mask and dark lantern in
my room after I was arrested."
"Did you intend to commit any more
burglaries?" â -'".-::, ~*V;v,
"No," said Steir, with a certain hesita
tion, which would convey the impression
that if he had not been caught he might
have tried it again. He does not seem to
take his arrest as seriously to heart as
Behrmann, and appears to" look upon it
more as a "lark" that anything else.
The police suspect that other burglaries
in the Mission have been committed by
Behrmann .-and Steir, notwithstanding
their denial, as the modus operandi was
the same but so far they have had no
means of verifying their suspicions.
SOME CITY DEATH TRAPS.
Hundreds of Girls Exposed to "Grave
Peril in Case of Fire. >
- The State Bureau of Labor Statistics is
kept busy investigating the grievances of
the working people. The last case to come
before it was that of a south of Market
street necktie ; factory, in which several
hundred girls and women are kent at
work in an upper story surrounded by in
flammable materials and with no mode of
entrance or exit save , a narrow wooden
staircase. The > bureau meditated taking
some action, if possible, for the placing of
fire escapes in â¢ the front and rear of the
building; but before making any advances
in the matter it was judged prudent to
consult the Fire Wardens: as to the proper
course to be pursued.
Yesterday afternoon Warden John Wells
called at the bureau and held a short con
ference with Commissioners Fitzgerald
and Dam. He regretted being obliged to
inform . them that the law ; gave the
wardens no control over buildings already
erected, but only over; those in course of
construction or improvement. 1 Hence in
his opinion the wardens were. powerless to
render any aid to thÂ«i commissioners in
the carrying out of their humane design.
; : "Never.mind," remarked Mr. Fitzgerald
after conference was over., -.'lt looks as
â though our project had 1 failed in this in
stance, but, after all, we may be able to dV
something though . : not ; perhaps Z all c we
would wish. At least we will publish a list
of places where human life -and safety are
allowed to remain in jeopardy by avari
cious employers. This necktie place is not
the only one we have our eyes upon. Per
haps the published list of deathtraps may
shame a few employers into some degree of
consideration for the lives which they hold
in their hands. , At all events it will warn
them that they are being watched. There
is one establishment downtown where sev
eral hundred girls are obliged to go. to the
upper i floor,- in elevators C without guards.*
.Two girls have met a cruel; death through
this criminal' negligence, but still there are
no guards. One is often tempted to wonder
whether some men have any consciences
at all." -v. â, ' -r:;.--rr.:rr- 'â ;-*â â ; '=_? â *â¢ â

INGTON AND LEAVE SOME TO GARRISON THE CITIES ON THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD.
IT is understood that though the pres- j
ent Congress is disposed to increase
the strength of the navy considerably,
yet, notwithstanding the earnest rec
ommendations of the Secretary of
War trie general of the army and the best
judges in the country of the matter, in
cluding many naval officers of high rank,
the army, which is most in need of
reorganization and increase, may be left
as it has remained for years. â¢ Yet should
Soain be so foolish as to go to war in case
the belligerency of Cuba were recognized
there is no doubt but Uncle Sam would
soon turn out an immense army of men,
and arm them, equip them, organize and
discipline them according to modern con
ditions, though the doing so would take a
matter of time. In case of Spain it would
not matter much, but against Great Bri
tain the thing becomes exceedingly seri
ous, for long before we would have this
army in a condition to do much damage
when thrown against English troops, we
would lose many seacoast towns, many
la_e cities, and much property would be
destroyed.
In such a case, many people have won
dered what the strength , arM manner of
organization of the American army would
be. It has all . been thought out, all
planned, and the officers are ready to take
marge of it all, should the occasion : ever
occur. â¢ It would necessarily be vastly
different from anything we have ever ex
perienced in the past wars, and more a_
proaching foreign armies than ever before.
It must be remembered that the magazine
rifles with which all modern armies are
armed have an effective range of about 2500
yards and a maximum range of 3700 yards,
and a continuous speed of fire averaging
at least twelve aimed shots per minute.
An assaulting force cannot move without
exposing a full-length target to this terrific
fire, while it cannot return such fire and
maintain its progress. The gun has, more
than any other one thing, been instru
mental in bringing about the changed con
ditions of modern war. This change is not
only on the field of battle, but exists in
the concentration of men forming the
armies, ana then again in the marches of
the army or armies to meet, the foe or to
retreat before him. Let us look at a few
figures of actual conditions, and instead of
their being dry they will be found in
tensely interesting. ,
The following table gives the normal
type of a modern American. army corps
and division, as decided upon by our best
modern military tacticians and strategists. j

From the above tables, we see that : the
normal- type of a corps contains something
over 43,300 officers and men arid a division
i over 12,700 officers and men. -It is not to
! over 12,700 officers and men- It is not to
j be understood that this is given as an in
\ flexible type, as many considerations may
! change the strength of the corps. But as a
i rule, while the strength of other ; subdivi
j sions varies, that of an army corps practi-
I cally remains the same. It is the strategi
i cal unit and is complete in itself, contain-
I ing as it does all arms of the service and
auxiliary subdivisions. It can, therefore,
[ at any time, be considered as the perfect
- ; lighting-machine, ready under any condi
j tions for service. How many corps shall
! , constitute an army is an open question.
The Germans in 1870-71 found more than
six corps unwieldy. Yet for extended
operations on a large scale less than three
1 are too few.
The War of the Rebellion brought out
â¢ army corps of from 12,000 to 40,000 men.
; General Sherman said no army corps
j should have less than 25.000 men, and in
[ 1864 five corps of the Army of the Poto
mac were consolidated into three, each of
â¢ ) this strength. But General Humphrey
i I said of this arrangement that five corps
: i each of 15,000 men would have been better,
. . since the country operated in was so much
I of a wilderness and with such poor and
j few roads that it . was often impossible to
j communicate with subordinates on an ex
j tended line of battle or on the march when
! hurrying troops up for battle. A modern
: : corps may have two, three or more divi-
I sions, called "infantry divisions," though
I each of them has a division of cavalry and
j a division of artillery. The corps has in
1 | addition an artillery force called the j
i "corps of artillery." " This is under the
command of the corps chief of arrtillery, !
; and includes the horse artillery batteries !
which operate with the cavalry divisions. |
Whether a corps should have two or j
more divisions has been argued and dis
puted both ways since the time ot, Napo- j
leon. But two divisions seem to work
1 well, and that is the number adopted by '
nearly all the great armies of .Europe. As I
against two divisions, it is said that the j
authority of the corps commander is neu- |
tralized unless both division commanders j
agree with him. With two divisions, the
corps commader must weaken one for ad
vance and rear guards. Also, this ar- i
rangement leaves the corps commander
without a proper reserve, since taking an
entire division for such reserve would be |
excessive, while if less than a division is |
taken, the command will be split, up into
too many fragments. If each division has
two brigades of two . regiments of three j
battalions each, then when any part of the i
division is detached less than a brigade
as becomes constantly necessary â the
brigade commander is left without any I
suitable command, thus often engendering :
jealousy -and' ill feeling. But while it
is true that with two divisions
the corps commander is obliged i
to detach regiments from brigades, or 'bri- ,
gades from divisions.it is better to trust
to the loyalty, subordination and patriot- I
ism of the officers concerned than to be
I obliged to depend upon an * inflexible -sys-
I tern hat will never J admit of any * change.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1896.
THE GREAT ARMY
UNCLE SAM
j number of small divisions was|a decided
J element of weakness and it is now held
| that if a corps is reduced to a -division, by
j casualties, or a division to a brigade, it is
! better to ; keep it independent under its
! proper commander, rather than attach it
| as a third division, or third brigade, to an
other corps or division. The English and
Americans have shown in all past wars a
preference for three divisions, also the
French, although: their normal: organiza
tion calls : for only two. As a matter of
fact in the army maneuvers of 1892 the
French experimented with three divisions.
The German army corps is commanded
by a general of infantry. His chief of staff
is a field officer Of the general staff. The
i chief of the corps artillery is a major-gen
| eral commanding the artillery brigade of
l the same number as the corps.' Thus, if
! we take for example the Third Army Corps,
j the major-general commands the Third
I Artillery Brigade. The chief of engineers
I is the major commanding the Third Pio
| neer. Battalion. The general staff of the
j corps commander consists of three general
I staff officers of any rank and four captains
I or - subalterns ' as aids-de-camp detached
I from regiments of the Third Army Corps.
j Then there are two adjutants, one each to
the chief of engineers and chief of artillery.
In the German army the, adjutants are
! not, as with us, officers of the staff, but
I rather officers who do the official and cleri
! cal work, and are Hike our chief - clerks of
I army and department headquarters.
The designation' of the; corps and its
| various subdivisions is peculiar in the Ger
man service, and 'consists in retaining,
under J all; circumstances, the same desig
nation, or one derived directly from it, as
the corps. - Thus we . have taken, for ex
ample, the Third Army Corps. ;It has two
infantry i divisions, the Fifth and Sixth.
They are - permanently assigned to this
corps. 1 Taking i up ", ; the Fifth Division, we
find â¢ its v commander ; to .. be a lieutenant
general.His staff consists of ne field officer
of the general and two aids. The
Fifth Division i contains the Ninth and
Tenth brigades, and ; the Sixth contains the
Eleventh and Twelfth brigades. The com
manding officer of the Ninth Brigade, for
example, is* a major-general. K He has one
aid. : The brigade has two regiments each
of : 'r three - battalions. ; These brigades are
numbered ; the Seventeenth and Eight
eenth. The , Tenth ; Brigade % has - also the
Third -Rifle Ãattalion. Each division has
for divisional artillery one division of four
batteries of the Third Field Artillery Regi
ment under, command; of ; a major. The
pioneers of: the division are the first com
pany of the . Third Battalion of Pioneers.
The corps artillery is commanded by a
colonel the 'commanding J officer of -the
Third Field 'Artillery; Regiment. :! It con-'
sists of the Third Division of the; Third
Field Artillery Regiment of four batteries
and the horse -artillery division of - the
same regiment," and the, third company of
the Third Battalion of Pioneers, 5 and -the
third â "â  corps 'ammunition column, ,
! under command of a ; captain, and the
third battalion ; of train troops, under a
major, and including five provision coir
umns, twelve field hospitals and. a horse
depot. Attached to the corps there is no
cavalry, after the old style of using it, for
the purpose of attack. It is due to inde
cision in opinions of tacticians that in
later years cavalry has been first assigned
to infantry divisions and then taken away.
Those even who favored divisional cav
alry were not agreed as to its proper; use,
, some holding that its proper ' sphere was
for aggressive tactics on the field, , and
others that it was wanted only as a secu
i rity and for gathering information. The
number assigned to a division is usually
1 from 500 to 600, but ,- has been .as high as
1000. In the-: German army corps one
regiment of cavalry forms an integral part
of each infantry division. In the new
German instructions for drill it is ; stated
that the chief duty of divisional cavalry is
to consist of reconnoitering work, although
when necessary a tactical use on the battle
field is not excluded. It is further decreed
that hereafter no body of troops down to
and including a single battalion shall be
without a few cavalrymen for reconnoiter
ing purposes, in order that infantry patrols
may be done away with.
The Corps and Divisional Artillery Du
ring the War of the Re hellion â â  each in
fantry brigade of four; or more regiments
had a battery of six guns. The corps had
in addition what was termed the Reserve
Artillery. - ; At present - the â¢ idea â  of "* the
proper use of artillery, is to -bring all and
as much as possible right at the opening
of a battle. - Hence each infantry division
has artillery permanently assigned to it. In
the United States corps there are four bat
teries.but in the German six and sometimes
eight. In addition there is another body
called the Corps Artillery, under the chief
of , artillery ; of .; the corps and corps com
mander. In our book; "Troops ;in Cam

guns called the : Reserve Artillery,-. but
which in war we shall, term and use as

operated with special skill. In all foreign
services there are special corps for this
purpose. ;' In this country the j length and
number of roads are so great and the offi
cials all so responsible, and having attained
their positions by long service and experi
enceâthat with their American aptitude
and \ executive ability, they are greatly
the superior of any similar body of men
in Europe so that we have no need of
special troops in the 1 army for such pur
poses.".. In case of war they would, in con
nection with a military railroad staff, sup
ply all needs, as they did from 1861 to 1866.
. Train Troops â In our organization. the
number of wagons of all kinds per corps
amounts to 1306, or about 40 per 1000 men.
This , includes the bridge train , ambu
lances, spare wagons, escort wagons, cais
sons, etc.* " They require altogether about
6000; mules.: The Germans have nearly
2000 wagons and use 6000 horses, and in ail
foreign armies there ''< are : regularly re
cruited men for the Train Corps, suitably
uniformed and equipped.. ( We depend on
men detailed from the line and on civilian
employes, and they are all placed in charge
of the 'Quartermaster or % . Subsistence De

r For campaign purposes there are used in
the wagon "transportation: the -six-mule
wagon, the two-horse and the ' four-horse
escort wagon and the packmule. ; The last
is not. used for the supply ; of a large body,
of troops," but only in marching .in : moun
tain or isolated regions, where . but ' small
bodies of troops would , go. The six-mule
wagon,' according to i condition of the
roads,' carries from' 2500 to 4000 pounds,
and the : escort wagons from ; 2000 to 3000
pounds. While the number of J wagons is

' ' A field- battery carries 231 rounds per
gun, or 42 in each limber and 126 in â¢ each 1
caisson. There are : ; 9 caissons. ,f ; The â ?â  re

an artillery officer of the Corps Artillery.
It is divided into four "sections,* one for
each division and one for the corps. It is
accompanied by a personnel of 250 trained
artillerymen. The supply train with forage
and rations is also divided into four.sec
tions, three for provisions and one for
forage. The army wagon in column occu
pies twenty to twenty-five yards, and it re
quires but" little calculation to show that
the wagon transportation for an army
corps occupies twelve miles of road. On
leaving the road, each section leaves
at the same time and is parked on
the side in rows with poles to the road.
The wagons on breaking park pull out
simultaneously. For every twenty- five
wagons there is one wagon-master, one as
sistant and twenty-nine teamsters. The

; Now a company of infantry .moving in
column of fours, the usual marching for
mation, takes up about thirty-three yards
of depth. A regiment of ten companies
would require 330 yards ...'A"; regiment of
twelve companies would require, with the
intervals between battalions, 420 yards. A
brigade of three regiments with usual in- i
tervals between regiments would - require
1320 yards. ; A regiment of ; twelve com
panies of cavalry, marching two abreast,
will require 1872 yards, while a t battery of
artillery of six guns will need 240 yards. ;'
ft Considering that all 'the ; baggage "is** at
the rear of the division or corps column,
we â¢ see next " that a division which : con
tains three brigades '* and - four batteries;
besides- ambulances, field hospital and
bearer companies/ will take up 1 5040 yards
of road or a distance of three and three
fourths miles," without -its baggage, '.while
an army corps of three divisions will take
three times this distance, and a great deal
more, since we have to add the cavalry di
vision, the corps artillery, the signal corps,
the engineers and the trains. L CV *' "
â "Adding * the exact amount of depth of
these other parts by giving fifteen yards as
the depth; of each vehicle and its teams,
we will have as the closest 'possible space
that' the army corps can close up to on a
road* 40,612 ; yards. -: But ; this Â£ does not
allow for any .of / the ; necessary intervals
i between ' different organizations ; and add
ing these,* which are computed at 360
yards we have an entire total of 40,972
yards, or a distance of twenty-three and a
half miles from front to rear of an army
corps on a single road. But it is impossi
ble for a column of this length to Keep
from stretching or "lengthening out," as
it is technically termed, and so the best
authorities make an allowance of 33 per
cent to the total, which added gives a
length of thirty-two miles altogether.
General McClellan says : "If I had marched
the entire army, 100,000 men. on a single
column instead of on Aye different roads,
the column with its trains would have
stretched out fifty miles."
Now, why must we add this 33 per cent?
If roads were all broad enough and in good
condition, columns could all march with a
far greater front and the depth be vastly
reduced. But in. this country, at least,
there are few roads where there is room
for a column of greater width than a set of
fours to move and leave sufficient space
for the unimpeded progress of orderlies
and staff officers, or for vehicles which
have to go in an opposite direction.
Now, having the data of an army corps
at hand, it is easy to compute that for
armies. A modern army consists of from
three to six army corps. More than six
are considered unwieldy for one com
mander. The Germans so found in 1870-71,
while less than three makes it hard for the
commander to ; retain a reserve in battle
and leave his corps intact. Therefore,
considering that in case of a great war.
such _ one as we might have with Great
Britain, we know that we would raise at
least five armies. These would operate as
follows: The first one on the extreme
northeast boundary, of three army corps;
the second one would operate on the
thickly populated part of Canada, the
neck of land that juts down between Lakes
Huron and Erie, and from where our
greatest danger would come. This would
be the largest army, and would consist
of 'at least five corps. It would be fol
lowed by another army to hold cap
tured places. This third army might
consist of independent corps, since
it would be designed to operate only as
garrison forces. The fourth army would
operate on the northwestern boundary,
and would' consist of three corps. The
fifth army would be the large one of six in
dependent corps, which would be kept
within striking distance of any seaport to
repel any attempted invasion or to assist
in any assault against an enemy's fleet or
landing columns. Thus we would have at
least fifteen army corps, a number of men
amounting to 650,000, and all these would
come at the first call for volunteers. It
would be a number of men that, compared
with all available, would hardly be no
ticed. It certainly would not hinder any
commercial, manufacturing, agricultural
or business pursuits. Yet it would be a
sufficient number to repel all the men that
Great Britain and France together could
transport to this country, and to capture
Canada and hold it, and to capture Cuba.
"If; these' men could all be put in one
column with their baggage trains they
would form a line nearly 500 miles in
length. : It is therefore not too much to
say that were all Europe united to attack
America the United States alone could
raise, organize and, given time, arm also,
4,000,000 men. This number would be
sufficient to have a single continu
ous line of) men touching elbow to
elbow, . and reaching .from the most
northern part of the coast of Maine clear
around to Mexico, then again from Seattle,
in, Paget Sound, another continuous lino
reaching out to the Pacific, and thence
down to San Diego. Or, to put it in . an
other way, they could be ranged along the
northern. border, beginning say at Port
land, Me., and striking the Canadian bor
der just to the northward of St. Albans,
*Vt., thence following the boundary line
by - the ) shores of the Great Lakes â  along
through Minnesota, 'Dakota,'? Montana,
Idaho and Washington to Puget : Sound.
And there would be of these, soldiers
even then over 200.000 left, while
there would still be 5,000,000 ' men' left
in the countryhot called out. And what is
more wonderful still is the almost absolute
belief among the better informed that this
immense mass of men, in case of danger,
would rise and act as one man, all actuated
with ; one" common impulse â the safety of
the country and the honor and fair fame
of "Old Glory.' â¢

THE
VILLEYS
OF SAN FRANCISCO.
SOMETIMES as I walk the streets
of this City my imagination plays
me a curious trick. As 1 glance
upward to where along some lofty
level the distant figure of a pass
in. pedestrian is silhouetted against the
sky, or a cable-car poises for its plunge
down the grade, the City seems suddenly
to vanish. The climbing streets no longer
stretch their gray } arallcls before me. The
tall buildings and countless houses disap
pear, and the busy clamor of life about me
seems to hush and die away. In place of
all these comes a vision of rounded hills

STORY
OF AN ENGINEER
HUNG up in a big frame in the |
â  ' ' I office of the roundhouse at the j
w I West Oakland yards of the South- j
Jl J j em Pacific system is an engrossed j
list of locomotive engineers em- I
ployed on the California division of Mr. !
Huntington's railroad, and that list is
headed by the name of Emile Frick, the
engineer who has been longest in the ser- i
vice of the company. He was engaged in j
running an engine between Oakland and j
Alameda when tbe latter* city boasted of j
the only ferry landing on the other side of
, the bay, and long prior to the time of the ]
absorption of that line by the Southern
Pacific corporation. Since 1864 he has been
in continuous service either between the
two cities mentioned or between East
Oakland and Oakland Mole. But even
' that early date does not represent the be
ginning of Fnck's experience in engineer
ing. He obtained his tuition in the science
of running a locomotive while in the
employ of the French banking firm of
Pioche & Bayerique, which, as old pioneers
will remember, constructed the first rail
road in the State of California the Sacra
mento Valley Road, from the capitol city
to Placerville. The Frenchmen sank loads
< of gold in their enterprise, but they lacked
the railroad genius that was soon after
their failure to build up the fortunes of
the Stanfords, the Crockers and the Hunt
ingtons.
Prick's engine on the old Alameda line
was the F. B. Atherton. He left the en
gine for another on a new route November
2, 1809, and just twelve days afterward the
Atherton collided with an overland, pas
senger train, and from the resultant
wreck sixteen dead bodies were taken.
The Atherton's history ended in the tale
of telescoped trains. Frick points with
pride to the fact that he has never met
. with an accident, of consequence in all
his years of life on the rail.
"lf I live till next November," remarked
Engineer . Frick, as he peered " from his
cab-window down the Seventh-street track
along which he was speeding, "1 shall
have completed twenty-seven years on
this line under Southern Pacific manage
ment. I haven't made very long runs nor
and green valleys, of stretch upon stretch
of soft dunes billowing clear to the hori
zon. , Nor smokestack nor sail is left upon
the bay, but the breakers dash white
against the rugged walls of the Gate and
| channel, and within the harbor the long,
j slow waves creep up toward a circling line
j of untrodden beach. The impression is a
j strangely vivid one and is almost as fascinat
: ing in its suggestive wonder as the City it
j self, which now stretches proudly over
j what must have seemed to the earliest
| comers a most unpromising site for a place
i of any size or importance.
very fast, runs, but I have averaged eight
hours a day and at least 3000 miles a
month during all that time."
In November Mr. Frick will have trav
eled a distance of 972,000 miles, dating
from 1869, and his mileage during the five
years preceding that date, even if he were
making only 500 miles a month, would
bring the total up above the million mark.
In other words, he has easily completed a
distance equal- to two round trips to the
moon, and with enough miles to spare to
circle the globe a few times in addition.
It will be noted that Mr. Frick has made
(necessarily) slow time on his runs. If it
be assumed that tbe moon is 240,000 milts
distant from the earth, a train ing at the
rate of a mile a minute would complete
a distance equal to that of the round trip
between this sphere and the silvery orb of
night in 333% days.
To some it may sound rather absurd to
speak in commonplace about the earth's
silvery satellite; but Camille Flammarion,
the eminent French astronomer, insists
that it is really a terrestrial province. Its
distance is but thirty times the diameter
of our globe, so that thirty earths joined
together , side by side on . the same line
would form a suspension bridge sufficient
to unite the two worlds.
Flammarion declares that the distance
is scarcely worthy of an astronomical
title. Our satellite is, from all points of
view, the first baiting place on a celestial
journey. Now, if we can imagine a bridge
of globes, why not imagine also a train
crossing the bridge? Leaving . the dearth
of atmosphere out of the question, or sup
plying the train-folks with some Yankee
contrivance "â¢ by which . they could avail
th- mselves of air to be continuously
pumped along the track ; from : the earth
(so that the lunar investigators might be
as well off as divers who breathe from the
bottom of the sea), what a glorious scheme
is unfolded for the reyealment of wonders
in the domain of our next-door heavenly
neighbor.
What a picnic Engineer Frick might en
joy if he landed, for instance, in the vicin
ity of the Sea of Serenity and r Lake of
Dreams. . There is no water in these > seas.
The accompanying drawing, 'reproduced
from : Flam marion's : Popular Astronomy,
shows clearly,* on the one hand, the sandy,
wrinkled, undulating nature of thosoil of
tbe lunar seas, and on the other; hand the
crateriform nature of all the mountains.
The walls of the seas of ! Serenity, Rains
and Humors form the longest series of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1*96.
It is worth while, now and then, to stop
and consider what has been done to render
San Francisco possible upon this penin
sula. There is inspiration in such con
sideration and hope for the accomplish
ment of the wonders that must and will
be achieved ere our City is that noble
thing which is her "destined end and
way." It is not enough that the ground
on which San Francisco stands has been
wrested from the sea and redeemed from
the fastnesses of the mountains. She is,
and must ever remain, a city set upon a
hill, which cannot be hid, and she must
asperities on the lunar soil, chains of i
mountains like the Carpathians, the Ap- |
pÂ« nines, the Caucasus and the Alps. The
moon is covered with a solid crust. If the
satellite could be reached from the earth,
that crust might be pierced with the ex
plosives and the internal gas of the lunar
orb be piped down to the earth in such
quantities as to make light and heat so
outrageously cheap as to extinguish the
oil trust and drive electricity out of the
illuminating field. '
In the moon the novel state of affairs
would be presented wherein trains could
run over the surface of the seas which no
ships could sail on.
It the Rocky Mountains had been simi
lar in structure to the mountains of the
moon, the railroad company could have
tunneled them with great facility. The
lunar mountain is all holiow, and the sides
of the mountain, which surround each
amphitheater, are cut out almost to the
peak to a depth which varies . from 10,000
to 13,000 feet. And what a bonanza the
moon would offer for the colonizer, if he
could prove its inhabitability and secure
its accessibility. The surface of the hemi
sphere which we see at full moon is 1,182,
--500 square leagues. This could, of course,
be reclaimed to a great extent by irriga
tion, the water to be either forced up from
the Pacific or obtained by boring into the
interior of the moon.
The time is hearing when all the land

make herself ready for the scrutiny to
which, in . the years to come, she will be
subjected.
The hills of San Francisco are a never
failing wonder and delight^ but not less
interesting are the valleys that once lay
between them, nestling in their hollows
and forming what are now the City's level
stretches. Mere names, most of them are,
now, identifying tracts wherein lie, as any
real-estate dealer will swear to you, -."the
most desirable residence sites in the City."
In some instances even the valleys them
selves have disappeared. .
How many of this generation know that
Spring Valley once lay between Mason
and Taylor, Clay and Washington streets,
and gave its name to the company, that
now supplies San Francisco with water?
A great sprin.y, boggy hollow, sixty feet
deep, was Spring Valley, and from the
springs there coming to the surface it was
supposed that an adequate water supply
could be obtained for the City. So a com
pany was formed, but it got nothing buj a
name from the valley. The water supply
was a delusion and a snare, so runs tradi
tion, and later J. B. Haggin filled in the
valley, and the City crept over . it, as over
many another unmarked and long-forgot
ten grave.
'Washerwoman's Valley and Washer
woman's Lagoon are still traditions of
North Beach. The lagoon lay at the foot
of Gough and Octavia, where Greenwich
and Filbert streets now pass. Here, thirty
years ago, so young is our City, the Mexi
can and Indian womenâ "the natives," in
the parlance of the time- -came flocking
from the Mission, from the hills and their
isolated homes along the beach bearing
upon their heads great bundles of clothes,
the family wash, lor cleansing in the clear,
fresh water of the lagoon. They used to
dry them on the sand and among the
on the earth will be appropriated, and the
moon will then be a still more excellent
field for speculation. Perhaps it is better
that there is no bridge of globes, and that
trains can't be run to the moon. England
would then want to make it a province of
the empire, and that might plunge Grover
Cleveland or his successor and the Ameri
can press into another war in order to
make Salisbury or some other Premier
prove that he never intended to infringe
on the Monroe doctrine, and would never
insist on flying the Union Jack on the
moon while fair Diana was smiling on the
American side of the world.
But we have almost forgotten that the
moon is here an altogether secondary con
sideration. Literature is too full of these
unnecessary diversions. Writers nowadays
introduce many irrelevant matters, to the
detriment of their main stories. We have
fallen into the same error, and let us has
ten back to Engineer Frick as he is.
"When I was given charge of an engine in
1864, I was 18 years of age," continued Mr.
Frick., "I started in young at railroading.
No, lam not a native. I was born in Eng
land, of French parents, and am an Amer
ican by adoption and preference. Look
young, do I? Well, take a look at my
fireman there. He's 25 and bigger than
his father, but he's my son. I was on this
same run before he was born.. I have run

[From an old-time sketch.]

I scrub oaks and furze bushes that tangled
through that whole section, and while the
t garments bleached in the sun and fluttered
in the strong afternoon wind the washer
women chatted and gossiped in the val
ley that still bears their name. What
would they have thought, one wonders,
had some imaginative prophet told them
of the homes that would one day rise
where they were even then dipping in
their brawny arms and rubbing their gar
ments free from soil? How they would
have laughed as they gathered up their
wash at- night and went home over the
"plana road" to the Mission to tell the
joke to the men.
Gone is the lagoon, gone are the washer
women, gone the days "when . sleep was
known as the California fever," and it is
sometimes to be .questioned whether we
who have succeeded them are .: greatly
wiser than those- simple soulsâ whether
we are apt toaccept with any greater seri
ousness or wuh a consideration beyond
probable increase in land values predic
tions for our City's future.
The scene. of Washerwoman's Bay, long
ago filled in and built over with factories
and business buildings, is reproduced from
a photograph taken in 1856 by San Fran
cisco's pioneer photographer, C. E. Wat
kins. It is the only comprehensive view
of that part of the City extant, and has
never before been reproduced in book,
newspaper or magazine. In this connec
tion it maybe observed that Mr. Watkns
possesses a collection of treasures in the
shape of views of San Francisco prior to
1860, and these he contemplates some day
incorporating in a work which will be of
historic value. Mr. Wat Kins was the
earliest outdoor scenic artist, in the West.
St. Ann's Valley is another almost
buried memory of early days. St. Ann's
building stands as a sort of monument to
the name, but even the traditions of the
valley seem lost. It lay along Eddy street,
west of what is now Powell. Yet scarcely
forty-five years have passed since the
Bowie cottage was built where Sutter
street now crosses Stockton/and a home
was established in the wilderness, out of
sight of the City or any human habitation.
Out, that way ran the road to the Mission,
through soft sand into which a horse's
feet sank deep and made no sound, wind
ing among the scruboaks that tore a
rider's clothing and scratched his hands
and his face, so narrow was the road,
over toilsome dunes dotted here and
there with charcoal-burners' huts,
winding in and out where Ellis, O'Farrell,
Geary, Post and Sutter streets have since
cut the sand wastes, and on through
em Pacific Company. 1

STORIES Of WHIST.
Tbe Game Has Sometimes Played a Se
rious Part in Public Affair..- r; .
: Many strange stories are told of whist
playing,' but none can excel this: '
Some years ago there was a whist club in
Somersetshire, England,' composed mostly
of j ministers. 1 They met every . Sunday
I Hayes Valley, where Colonel Tom Hayes,
agriculturist, politician, duelist and good
fellow, lived upon his ranch. Four blocks
west of Larkin street, along Hayes,
stretches Hayes Valley that once deserved
its name.- There is no hint in the pha
lanxed gray buildings stretching their un
broken fronts along those uptown business
blocks of the time so few years ago when
fresh fields and pastures green invited the
foot and rested the eye, wearied with the
sight and feel of toilsome sand. And yet
there is something delightfully reminis
cent in the name that still clings to the
district and brings a purer breath in its
very sound. We may forget Colonel Hayes
âwe probably shallâ but to call even the
most prosaic street a valley is suggestive
of better and more beautiful things. One's
imagination need not linger along the
street. On the impetus of that word val
ley it may swing out to the hills that it al
ways implies and gain freedom.
Beyond Hayes Valley, to the south, lay
the Mission Valley, broad, fertile, well
watered, perfectly sheltered, smiling in
the sunshine, chosen ' as were all the sites
chosen by those wise old padres, with an
unerring instinct. They knew where to
locate, and they knew how to build, those
earnest, single-minded Spanish priests.
We have followed them faithfully in the
first, locating where they have shown us
desirable places. Would we had been
wiser still, and had builded as they showed
us how, with perfect adaptation to the sur
rounding landscape. Do you suppose it
is an accident that none of those old
Spanish buildings and bouses are the un
sightly blots upon the country that most
of our modern structures are? The same
creek that watered Hayes Valley flowed on
into the Mission. Moat of us still remem
ber how it used to meander through
Woodward's Gardens.
The names given to the districts south
of Market street are suggestive of what
those localities must have been in early
days. They were settled upon and built
up much later than was the section to the
north and nearer the beach, yet they have
been the first to yield" to the encroach
ments of business. Happy Valley lay to
the south- of Market street and east of Sec
ond. The first settlers there were such as
found the wild life at "The Cove" too tur
bulent for them, and they went to Happy
Valley to rest in narrow, grassy homes,
borne thither by their fellowsâ and of those
who there lay down none have yet awak
ened. . '' * '
Â«It was fire drove, later settlers into
Happy Valley. One, twice, thrice the
City was burned down, and then those
evening in the back parlor of a barber.
Four of these were one time acting as pall
bearers at the funeral of a reverend brother
when a delay occurred, owing to the grave
being not quite ready, and the coffin was
set down at the chancel. By way of w till
ing away the time one of them produced a
pack of cards from his pocket and proposed
a few hands of whist. The rest gladly as
sented, and they were deep in their game,
using the coffin as a table, when the sexton
came to announce that the preparations
were complete.
Goldsmith tells of an old lady who, lying
sick unto death; played cards with the
curate to pass the time away, and after
winning all his money; had 'just proposed
when the revolution broke out in Paris re
peated and frantic messages were sent to
Charles X. informing him of the state of
affairs. The Kin. was engrossed in cards
however, and not to be disturbed, and
each time the reply came, â¢'His Majesty
is playing whist."
Another cool whist-player was Lord
Slijro. When the news arrived that his
magnificent residence was on fire :be
stopped only a moment to ascertain
whether or not his presence could be of ma
terial service on the scene of the conflagra
tion. Finding that it would not, he calmly
took up the hand .which had* been deal,
him while he was talking with the messen
ger and resumed play.
Unless Espartero and â¢ his foe, Marota,
are much belied, their quarrel was settled
by a game of cards in a farmhouse at Ber
gara, where they met to I arrange a truce
between their respective forces. â > No sooner
did Espartero enter the > room than the
Carlist chief challenged him to a game of
tresilio, -a â  challenge the Chris ti no com
mander accepted with alacrity. Espartero
who desired security went over south of
Market street and built homes the first
real homes the . City had . in any num
ber. It is interesting to note how they
builded in those days. The houses' that
circle South Park shoulder each other as
though they feared a breath of air might
find its way into that once aristocratic
quarter. They built in blocks, with deep
areas, taking New York City houses for
their models, and one thinks feelingly of
what must have been the dampness of
some of those basements. Along Harrison
and Bryant streets and up and down the
Rincon they did better. There is still an
air; of stateliness and leisure about
some of those old garden-surrounded
houses, now for the most part
sheltering the philantropies of that
section, and having a curiously stranded
air amid the business that has crept up all
around them. As a locality for the more
luxurious homes of. a great city Happy
Valley was well chosen. It was accessible.
It was sheltered. It looked out upon a
beautiful marine view. It was not too
hilly for people not yet accustomed to the
idea of exertion. in California, and no one
could have predicted . the changes that a
score of years would bring, or that the
inexpressible folly of the "Second-street
cut" would ever" be sanctioned by a Bane
people. But the business portion of the
City spread rapidly, and, following the
"line of least resistance," poured , into
Happy Valley almost before the com
fortable homes were built, and their own
ers fled, disconsolate, to Nob Hill, to * the
Western Addition and to North Beach.
Beyond Happy Valley, from Folsom
street to Brannan, from Third street to
the water, lies Pleasant Valley, once sug
gestive of its name, now as pleasant as
grime and smoke, the hum of machinery,
the clangor of engine bells and steam
whistles and the human flotsam and jet
sam of a seacoast city's water front can
make it. .
The valleys of San Francisco! Safe,
sheltered, beautiful spots they once were.
Will they ever be beautiful again? Or
shall the spreading City make of those not
yet fully surrounded places, like unto
these? Islais and Laguna Honda, Merced
and Mountain Lake still remain to us,
almost unhurt. We ought to consider, as
the City creeps out toward them, whether
we must really build and grow in such
fashion that some future chronicler shall
be moved to relate with wonder .how the
wild flowers bloomed, birds sang and clear

hours Marota had paid his debt, and the
fierce Carlist war was at an end.
A Yarborou go hand is a hand in which
there is no card above a nine spot. The
name given to this hand is derived from a
certain Lord Yarborough, who used to of
fer the , attractive but very safe wager of
Â£1000 to Â£1 that a hand of this sort would
not be dealt. His lordship may have
worked out the chances, or he may. not,
but the fact is that such a hand occurs
only once in 1827 rounds, although Pem
-1 bridge says he has held three Yarboroughs
in a single evening. His lordship's wager,
to be quite fair, should have been Â£1827 to
Â£1. It is said that he won his wager many
thousand time3.';sfÂ§gÂ§Â§ggS6Â§
According to a recent report a young
lady at a whist party held ten of the thir
teen trumps. Such a hand is exceedingly
rare. As for the chances of holding a thir
teen-trump hand they are calculated to be
160.000,000,000 to 1. ;â _ ,
At the Union Club of Boulogne some
years ago the dealer dealt the twenty-six
red cards to himself and partner and the
black cards to their opponents. When we
come to realize that the odds against such
a round of hands are 8,000,000,000 to 1, we
must admit that this was a very remarka
ble deal. â  ;. , ..â â â¢. â¢ Â. . - r -

of the RIVAL
THERE was a time when the arri
val of an ocean vessel in San
Francisco harbor was a matter of
much more importance than it is
now, when the whole world is
covered with telegraph lines and the com
ing of trains from the other side of the
continent are matters of daily occurrence. i
As soon as the American flag was raised
in Monterey in 1846, and people from the
East began to come to California, San
Francisco at once became an important
seaport, and the entire new population
took an almost vital interest in the arrival
of every vessel. It meant, in most cases,
the arrival of perhaps the only mail for j
months, and a few words from those whom |
the hardy adventurers had left on the At- I
lantic side of the country were almost be- I
yond value. In the very early days, men !
have been known to walk along the beach, !
near where the Cliff House now stnnds,
for days and weeks at a time eagerly scan
ning the horizon for the sight of a ship
that would most likely bring them news
from home. And when a vessel did come
the people seemed to go wild with joy, for
it was almost sure in some way to affect
every man in town.
It was this feeling that led to the estab
lishment of ship exchanges at a time when
the City had only a few thousands of
people. The early records were unfortu
nately destroyed by the fires of ISSOand 1851,
and all: the knowledge to be obtained on
the subject at the present time is from a
few copies of those records and the memo
ries of some of the men still living who
were in the prime of life in 1849 and took
an active part in the early history of the
City. S^ri
The first exchange established in San
Francisco was on Washington street, near
Montgomery. It was opened by- E. E.
Dunbar on September 10, 1849, and was
maintained by . the subscription of mer
cantile people. It was also a sort of read
ing-room and the repository of all the ship
news. : Of the fate of this institution there
is no record, but as it was in the heart of
the district burned the following year, it
must have been destroyed by fire and
never re-established.
The next exchange was started in 1850
by Wills & Gower. and it survived a num
ber of years. It was only a small room in â¢
a place known as Wards court, just off j
Montgomery street, in the vicinity of

Drive Them Out.
Among those who arrived here a few
days ago on the steamer Australia from
different parts of the Pacific was Miss E.
L. Crosby, who for the past ten years has
been a missionary in the Caroline, Gilbert
and Marshall islands. Miss Crosby has
had many singular experiences and wit
nessed many remarkable scenes during
the long period since she first went among
the queer Pacific islanders.
The lady has been making her head
quarters at Kusale, in the Caroline group,
the central station of the missionaries of
the American Board of Foreign Missions
of the Congregational church, which she
represents. The island of Kusaie is about
twenty-five miles in circumference and has
mountains reaching to a height of about
2000 feet. Kusaie is in the easternmost
group of the Carolf Islands.
There is a training-school there for
the young men of the Gilbert group,
and also one for the young men of the
Marshall Islands. Besides these there is
a training-school there for the girls of the
two aforesaid groups. These schools are to
train the young natives to become mis
sionaries. A missionary family has charge
of the Marshall Island training-school,
another missionary. family and an assist
ant has charge of the Gilbert Island school,
and two young ladies have charge of the
girls' school.
According to Miss Crosby the mission
work is progressing pretty well in the
main, but there are some hard problems
to solve. Just now the natives all over
the islands have been overcome by a fit of
dancing. The dance is infectious and has
spread everywhere. It is worse than the

Clay. In the same year Troyon & Hurl
burk opened an exchange on Clay street,
between Montgomery and Sansome. '.'â 
Neither of these institution? made much
of an effort to get news, they simply i
"posted" it when it came to them and fur
nished a meeting place for business men;
where they could discuss the arrival or
non-arrival of a vessel in which they were
interested. The fate of Troyon & Hurl
burk's Exchange is a matter of doubt, as
there is no record of its failure, and the
memories of old residents vary on the sub- j j
ject. It is known that Sweeney. & , Baugh j
established an exchange in the same lo- !
cality on Clay street in 1851, and it is
thought by some that they bought out the j
old firm. Several men, however, insist
that Troyon <fe Hurlburk failed and that
Sweeney & Baugh simply took the same j
building.
In any event Sweeney & Baugh began
to make things "hot" for Wills & Gower. i

ghost dance, which raged among the
American Indians some years ago. The
natives have been dancing for nearly eight
weeks. They dance all night and in the
daytime, too, till they fall down from
sheer prostration and weariness. , No one
knows how to account for the singular
dancing which has spread' for thousands
of miles through the queer archipelagos
along the equator. ;:...'/*;:â¢:â¢."â¢
"I had a strange . experience in the
island of Ruk, one of the Carolines." said
Miss Crosby. "This is the scene of the
farthest station occupied by the American
Board of Foreign Missions. Ruk is a
mountainous island, or rather group of
islands, around a lagoon. The mission
work there is carried on in the same way
as in the other islands, but the difference
in the people is enormous. ,
"The Rukites are people with clear-cut
features, bright intelligent faces â¢ and
slender lithe figures. Their every move
ment is full of grace. Altogether they are
of a higher type of manhood than I found
in any of the other groups.
"However, their heathenism and .' de-
Fravity surpass everything with which
had previously come in contact.. I
thought the Marshall Island people were
bad enough. The Gilbert people were
wilder and more lawless, but the Ruk
people of the Caroline Islands surpass im
measurably all of them in wickedness.
Their heathenism is indescribable. The
Ruk people are the only ones in any of
the islands who use paint. I saw -a little
child, scarcely 4 years old, whose little
body was reeking with dirt and cocoanut
oil. Its bright eyes looked up at me from
a face made hideous by the yellow paint,
or tak, as it is called. : ' .
"Around the child were many of i the
savages, all daubed with paint. \ It was a
remarkable sight. [â */".'(>:
"The ruler of these savages is a powerful
witch doctor named Levi. It seems that
when Mr. Logan, the earliest missionary,
arrived there Levi was very friendly to
him and gave him land for the mission at
Wala. He afterward professed to be con
verted, but it appears that his ideas of
what was to come were far-fetched. He
expected that when the missionaries were
settled he would live with them and they
would have everything in common. .When
he found out this was not to be he threw
up his professions of Christianity and
friendship. Now he goes around bragging
that he introduced the missionaries and
their religion to the island and says he
will drive them out.
"This witch doctor I found was a tall,
slender man with masses of coarse, tangled
hair, caught up by a skewer at the top of
his head. His thin, cadaverous face was
fearfully daubed with the yellow paint.
There were immense apertures in . his
ears, and they were filled with strings of
heavy ornaments cut from tbe cocoanut
shell and dangling to his shoulders. His
clothing consisted of two strips of native
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALI., SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1896.
They engaged a boatman named "Billy'
Elison and erected a wharf at the foot of
Dupont street, just in front of where the
Eureka House now stands. They kept a
man out at Bakers Beach to watch for
vessels and ride to town with his report as
soon as he saw one and made out what it
was. i They started correspondence with
other parts of the world so that they al
ways received some important shipping
news with every vessel that came to port.
Nor were they content with simply get
ting the fact of the vessel's arrival. Their
boatman at once started in his "Whitehall
and often rowed half way out to the Far
allones and got the ship's papers and all
the news. Tne exchanges frequently had
this a couple of days before the vessel
came to anchor as it was difficult work get
ting across the bar when the wind was ad
verse.
Sweenev & Baugh pleased their patrons
so much "that in two years they were able
to move into the new exchange building
on Battery street. How Wills & Gower
managed to keep afloat is a mystery, but

cloth thrown over the . shoulders and
caught together at the back and front. It
was profusely ornamented with broad
bands of native beadwoik. The remainder
of his body was entirely nude, except for
its' coating of yellow paint done in oils. A
more repulsive-looking creature j I have
never seen.
"He is theruling spiritof the island, and
all the people stand in awe of him. He is
a formidable opponent to Christianity on
the island of Ruk, because the people there
are afraid of him "arid because he uses his
power in the line of their inclinations.
. "There are a few rays of flight on Ruk
Island, however, notwithstanding what I
have told you. There is a school there in
charge of two missionary women, attended
by twelve native girls. There is also a
training-school for boys, which was started
by Mr. Logan. Besides the schools there
are a few native Christians here and there
which with the new missionaries who went
there last year promise in time to redeem
this strange island of the Pacific. . We need
some new J missionaries, and I hope we
shall have them before long. ,
"I suppose there â  are about 10,000 people
on Ruk Island. It is properly made up of
six small islands which circle round a
lagoon. The curious clay which the
natives use as a paint is brought by them
from Mortlock Island, between Ponape
and Ruk. Levi, the, medicine man, who
rules Ruk, is between 39 and 40 years old.
It is a hard matter to tell the exact age of
these people. Â ;?!"''.".*
'.'The Ruks 'speak a language of their
own. It is very different from that of the
Gilbert ' or Marshall Island, natives, but
more of a language. The , hair of the
Ruks is very straight, black, coarse and
long. I have seen a half-dozen yards of
strings of cocoanut shells dangling from
the ears of the natives. These people tat
too themselves in blue in a fantastic way.
They tattoo the lower part of their faces
and extremities. The chiefs tattoo, only
the upper part of their face and forehead.'''

Her health has been poor in the islands
lately, and after remaining in California
awhile she will go East. .
An Old-Time Minstrel.
An old man with a white beard, walking
with difficulty and', supporting himself
on a oane, was seen on lower Broadway
the other day. He was "Billy" Birch, the
old-time minstrel, and he had gone out to
look for the store which now occupies the
building in which the San Francisco Min
strels appeared first las v an S organization.
Somebody had told ' him Â§ that | the ring
which marked off- the â¢ parquet seats was
still to be seen there, â¢ and j he j had i gone
down to look : up this scene of his
earlier successes in New York. â¢ ; Birch
is old and disabled from the effects
of â¢a ; stroke of 'j apoplexy, t but he man
ages â - to ii* get around -to 'the ': variety
theaters, and -he 'â  takes the interest of
a philosopher in observing the differences
in the performances of to-day and those of
a time in - which he was active. He is the
one surviving founder of the old company,
and he has no means to show as a result
of so many years ( of work. He lives mod
estly on Seventh avenue, at times kept in
the house for ( several days. > He is = rarely
seen outside of his home, -unless it be at
the* theaters, without the society of a faith
ful dog, which keeps close; to him indoors
and ; out. Many Â» years â  ago '; Birch -was % a
figure in 'i a â¢ very - different â  phase of > New
York life. ~ He owned fast .horses,' and no

days with * keener enjoyment or apprecia
they did ; for a number of years and their
place was always crowded with business
men, most of whom, however, it is said,
paid no dues. ; They always had the news
shortly after Sweeney & Baugh,- although
they made little effort to get it. It is true
i they were at small expense and the owner
of the building put the rent very low so as
to keep them there and make the neigh
borhood lively. But in spite of all advan
tages the Wills & Gower Exchange died a
natural death about 1860, and Sweeney &
Baugh had things their own way. Bat it
was this that caused their ruin. .-'â¢â 
â '.' During the years of the war, when ship
ping was at a low ebb,; the news obtained
was not of so much importance to mer
chants as to the general public, and the
subscribers did not pay much attention to
the . way . the institution was run. But
when peace was declared again and ship
ping became lively the men who sup
ported the exchange became dissatisfied
at certain ."arrangements" that Sweeney
& Baush were said to have made. Hav
ing things all to themselves they could do
as they pleased with certain .bits of infor
mation. They generally knew to whom
it would be the most valuable and sold it
for all they could get, often to the great
disadvantage of their other patrons.
They also refused to improve their service
in any way, as the patrons thought the in
crease of business demanded.
In the latter part of 1865 matters reached
a climax when a number of merchants
banded together and started the fond for
the present Merchants' Exchange on Cali
fornia street. j The most active workers in
the enterprise were: William C. Ralston,
R. J. S neath, Joseph A. Coolidge, Thomas
H. Selbv â  and Alvinza Hayward. The
present building was put up "in 1866 and
then the real rivalry of the exchanges
commenced. Business methods had be
come such that it was not a matter of
simply getting 'the news, but it was a
matter of getting it first.
The new exchange fitted up a house for
boatmen at Meiggs wharf, and sent to
New York for Bob Martin, a then famous
marine reporter. They employed an army
of men and put semaphores on alt the
hills around San Francisco. A man' with
several fast horses was stationed as far
away as Pigeon Point. From that posi
tion he could see a vessel when it was
nearly a day's journey from San, Fran
cisco. If the weather was clear he used a
semaphore to signal a man on Mission
hills, who in turn signaled to a man on
Telegraph Hill in the City. From that
position it was sent to a man in the tower
of the Merchants' Exchange, who in turn
sent the news to the crowd in the' hall
below. In those days the principal thing
to look out for was steamers, and as soon
as word came that one was in sight
crowds flocked to North Beach. If the
weather was not clear, the man at Pigeon
Point would ride to San Francisco as fast
as possible, changing horses as often as
necessary.
This vigorous fight of the new exchange
was felt by Sweeney & Baugh at once and
they made an effort to fight back, but not
having kept up with the rimes they could
devise no plan of their own. To offset

Billy Elison, the first boatman em
ployed by Sweeney, & Baugh in 1851, was
still with them and put all of his energies
into the fight. Billy is still alive, although
not as strong as he was forty years ago.'

A . PAYING INVESTMENT.
Values of the Properties Enhanced by
Village Improvement.
"The property-owners of a village can
not make a better paying investment than
in the -maintenance of --a well-organized
improvement society," writes John Gilmer
Speed in .April Ladies' Home Journal.
"Through such a society the value of every
piece ot property in a village, and the
neighborhood thereof, may be enhanced
in value; village life may be made to take
on new interests and new dignities; stag
nation may be kindled into an exhilarat
ing, activity. Let the, people become in
terested in a village improvement society
and they will soon begin to discuss plans
and policies with a gratifying alertness.

sure ito have the other fellows near us
somewhere. When a ship came in sight,
it was a race I can tell you. I We pulled as
hard as we could, and the man who got
there first got the news. The worst of all
was the efforts of the second man to catch
up with the other on the way home.
Sometimes he would, but more often he
wouldn't, for we were well matched, i
'â 'â '.-;' "I don't, remember the name of the man
who pulled the â¢ boat â¢ for the" Merchants'
Exchange then; but he's dead, anyhow,"
continued Billy, 1 after a reminiscent pause.
"So are all the other boys, I think. It
used to be a fair race as long as it was con
fined to rowing all 1 the way home, and I
tell you we made some record-breaking
time. But ; ; after awhile the Merchants'
Exchange got to sending horsebacic riders
out along shore and as : soon as their man
got the news he pulled to the nearest land
and handed sit over to the .man, who gal-,
loped to town with it. Our people tried
the same thing, but, of course, both got
the papers \at nearly the Â£ same - place and
the race back to town was a killing one on
the horses. The riders were nearly all old
cowboys . and they, galloped through the
streets like lightning. Sometimes they
knocked people over, and a few months of
this work used up a band of horses."
According to Billy's story there was
some excitement every day and all the
people in town were interested in the out
come of the fight. ; During the three years
that the fight lasted Billy and Bob Martin
were lost in a fog outside on several differ
ent occasions. ' Once they got caught in a
gale and did not get home for days- They
were kept on tbe jump and had scarcely
time to eat or sleep. It was their business
to always be on the lookout for ships and
as soon as they had reported one to go and
look for another.
The awful strain and excitement were
telling on everybody, and Billy Elison
was about to give up his job when he was
told one morning in May. 1 1869. that
Sweeney & Baugh had quit the fight and
sold out to the Merchants' Exchange.
Since then he worked at his old business
until he became too feeble, but says he
never had as much fan as he did when the
rival exchanges were running. .

survivors of the days of the rival ex
changes. He is now in ' his eighty-second

York has proceeded toward the realization
of one of its . inevitable improvements

from the Harlem River to Mosholu park
way. It will be a grand drive and prome
nade connecting the park systems of the
metropolis. This enterprise, -when real
ized, will surpass even the famous boule
vards of Paris. '^iv : VâT;'
; It is to run . for four and a half miles
along the river, dividing the Hudson River
and Long Island Sound, beginning at the
intersection of One Hundred and Sixty-first
street and Mott avenue, its northern ter
minus being, Mosholu parkway, just east
of Jerome avenue. No streets will cross it
at grade, but ail will go beneath it, a result
that is particularly practicable by the nat
urally elevated situation of this unique
highway. Its cost is to be about $20,000,
--000, $3,000,000. of which, it is estimated,
will be required for the acquisition of right
of way. * The time allowed for its construc
tion is three years. Within a year, accord
ing to the engineers in charge, the work
will be well under way. The last Legisla
ture gave the city authorities in charge of
such improvements all the law needed to
condemn property, make preliminary sur
veys and perfect arrangements for prose
cuting , the | work, which is to be unique
among the famous streets of the earth. -
' A glance at the \ plans . prepared shows
that the width of the concourse will be 182

utilized so as to make the thorougfare at

to each sidewalk will be an ordinary drive

DISCUSSED THE CHARTER
American Socialists Speak For
and Against Its Adop
tion.
Eloquent and Able Addresses by
Messrs. Clement, Scott, Rey
nolds and Others.
There was a large attendance at last
night's meeting of the Society of American
Socialists in Kohler & Chase Hall, on
O'Farrell street, and the merits and de
merits of the proposed ! new City charter
"were thoroughly discussed.
Morrison I. Swift opened the meeting
with a few words of welcome and an invi
tation to non-socialists present to join the
ranks of the society. The central thought
now, he said, was not that monopolies and
trusts should be broken up, but that they
should be taken in, hand by the people
and managed by the people's representa
tives for, the public benefit.
. This political work would not preclude
members from joining other parties and
voting on the old lines, provided that tbe
candidates voted for promised to work for
the good ends held in view by the Social
ist party.
â  "If you are foolish enough to remain in
the old parties after you join with the
Socialists," he remarked, in conclusion,
"you may do so; but I believe you will
soon tire of trying to make professional
politicians walk straight, and when that
time comes we may hope to see the dawn
ing light of a new 'Government-ownership
party' which will 'renew the face of the
Republic."
Referring to the discussion of the even
ing," Mr. Swift said the new charter doubt
less had 'its good ; and bad points, and
called upon 'H. N. Clement for a word in
its favor.
â¢ Mr. Clement commenced by stating that
he was one of the framers of the new char
ter, and was conscious that it was not
perfection. Still he considered it prefer
able to the consolidation act under which
the City is at present governed. It should
be remembered that â¢ however good the
consolidation act might be, the new char
ter might â¢be better, and j however faulty
the new charter might be- it was possible
that the â¢ consolidation act might be far
worse. â¢ â  .
' ' "This consolidation act," pursued Mr.
Clement, "was framed in 1856 by an old
lawyer, Horace â¢ Hawes by name, and
would have been good enough for a large
village. : But it was only a makeshift for a
charter, and had' no sooner been adopted
than it was found to be radically defective.
Then commenced a reign of trickery
and intrigue. Supervisors, city officials
and schemers,, seeing that special legisla
tion was, so to speak, kept on tap at the
State capital," combined to carry on jobs of
all sorts I until the scramble for power,
favor and boodle rendered the California
State Legislature a scandal to the country.
The consolidation act as framed by Hawes
covered thirty-one pages. If it were to be
published in . the same volume with the
special enactments which have grown out
; of *- it 1160 pages -at the least calculation
would be required." ''"."'"
Mr. Clement then proceeded to outline
the features' of the new charter which in
his conception would remedy the evils
mentioned. With '.' laborious and * pains
taking care he instituted a vigorous com
parison between the ' two documents, and
arrived at the conclusion that the new
charter would : be a -better- power to rule
the City v than the ; Board of Supervisors,
which be characterized as "a corrupt and
venal ' body,* \ notorious , for its constant
grasping after power."
; J. E. Scott * took exception to Mr. Cle
ment's ';. view. : r Ho . said what . the City
wanted was a charter for the people and
not for the classes.' He made an eloquent
appeal for the laborers and the poor, who, 1
in nis opinion, would 'â  not be benefited g by
the new charter. - : " Â \
; ' John : M. Reynolds was ' also opposed to
the charter, and denied that the con so lid a
i tion *- act - was ' at * the â¢- bottom 'of ' existing
San Francisco July 31, 1846, in command
of Captain Atkins." The first warship of
which there is any record is the English
frigate Herald. She was here in August,
1846. The first American frigate men
tioned is the Portsmouth that arrived
September 21, 1846. The Independence
arrived March 19, 1847. Mr. Coolidge's
records show that the first steamer in San
I Francisco was the Rainbow, built in Sitka,
i Alaska, by an American. She was brought
down here on a ship and put into service
on the rivers.
â¢ There is one rather astonishing state
ment in the records. It is that on April
12, 1849, there were only thirty-three ves
sels in the harbor, and that on April 17
there, were 360!
Mr. Coolidge thinks that the success of
the Merchants' Exchange was due to origi
nality. In all the fight of three years Swee
ney & Baugh never sprang a" new thing.
Whatever the new exchange did they were
content to follow, until the pace got too
fast for them and they had to give up.
"The races on the water were always
mighty exciting," said Mr. Coolidge when
speaking of the matter, "but they were
nothing to the horseraces through the
streets. The pavements then â¢ were not
what they are now, and dozens of horses
were rendered useless by falling. Riders
were often hurt, but generally, they man
aged to look out for themselves. But we
have the telegraph now, and there would
be no need for such things ever happening
again even if there were a dozen rival ex
changes." â¢
When Sweeney & Baugh sold out they
turned all their books and records over to
the Merchants' Exchange. These are com
plete as far back as 1851, and the records in
the possession of Mr. Coolidge give a com
plete list of all arrivals and departures of
vessels in this port since California has
I been a part of the United States.
municipal evils. The new charter would
be no better, he thought, since it would
not do away with boodling, franchises and
special contracts. - ', '
He contended the main trouble lay with,
the Supervisors, who were too easily in
fluenced in favor of rich and powerful cor
porations. â â '-;',*â "-â  , .;;;... r .
Other members discussed the charter
from both standpoints and it was decided
to continue the consideration of the sub
ject at the club's next meeting.
NO SAFE REALLY BURGLAR PROOP
Give Burglars Time and They Can Get
Into Any Safe, Says a Maker.
A reporter of the New York Sun asked
the manager of one of the biggest safe
building concerns in the world whether a
safe had ever been built that was abso
lutely burglar proof ?
"There never was," he replied.- "Most
big safes are called burglar proof, but they
are not. No man can build a thing that
some other man cannot unbuild. Now,
there's a safe," he said, leading the re
porter to the back of the store, "that is aa
near burglar proof as any made." s\v >V..
The safe he pointed to looked like a
solid block of steel, with. two enormous
hinges in front and a steel lever that ran
across the block diagonally. The door
was round. .".','
"That safe," said the manager, "is al
most what it appears to be, a solid block,
but a properly equipped burglar could get
into it nevertheless, provided he had time.
It is this question of time that makes it
possible for us to be more or less truthful
when we speak of the safe as burglar proof.
It requires so much to get one of them
open that before the work can be dona
it is almost certain that somebody will
come around and then the jig is up.
By the way, it is a mistake to talk about
blowing a safe open. Most people
have an idea that a burglar comes along,
punches a hole in the safe, and throws in
a lot of dynamite, which he touches off.
What the burglars do is to drill a hole in
the door near the combination, and then,
by exploding a small quantity of Dowder,
or sometimes only a cartridge, smash the
combination. This enables them to work
at it with their fingers, and the opening of
the safe is not so difficult a though ex
plosions of; this kind have been known to
lock safes tighter â¢ than they were locked
before; so- tight, in fact, that they could
not be opened without a second explosion
and the use of a largely increased amount
of powder.' Burglars will not, as a rule,
take chances on that, for, I don't care how
nervy they are, the noise of the first ex
plosion never fails to frighten them half to
death." .

SOCIETY
THE clanging of the joyous Easter j
bells is the happy signal for the
reawakening of society. Never '
before has the world of fashion so I
rigorously observed the peniten- |
tial season. "While society has always j
tabooed dances during Lent, each previous
season has been marked by many delight
ful inlormal entertainments and numer
ous recherche dinners and luncheon par
ties.
The mid- Lent was always more or less
gay, in decorous fashion, of course, Hut
this year society yielded not to precedent
and decreed Lent a season of penitence,
fasting and abstinence from all social
festivities. The decree was obeyed to the
letter and the resultâ too dismal to dwell
upon.
Now that the forty days have passed
there is to De a brief period of gayety and
then society hies itself to pastures green,
the beach, etc.
A number of the wanderers who have
been collecting curios and otherwise en
joying themselves abroad are signaled for
home. Mrs. Low and her charming daugh
ter, Miss Flora Low, are reveling at pres
ent in the Paris shops, but are expected
home for the National holidays. So are
Mrs. Delmas and the Misses Delmas, who,
by the way, have been devoting them
selves to serious studies during their so
journ in the gay capital.
D. 0. Mills has declared his intention of
passing the summer at his place at Mill
brae, and with his son-in-law and daugh
ter, Mr. and Mrs. Wnitelaw Eeid, who
have been passing the winter in Arizona,
is expected here shortly.
Miss Romie Wallace has returned from
New Orleans, where she had a delightful
visit with Mr. and Mrs. Richard Sprague,
and Mrs. Henry Jerome has decided not
to return to New York just yet, but to
remain in California for the summer. Mrs.
Jerome, with her guest, Miss Catherwood,
is at present at Coronado. They will work
this way by easy stages, stopping at Santa
Barbara for the floral show. Then they go
to Yosemite for a month, then to Alaska,
and will pass the end of the summer at
Del Monte. By the way, the charming
gowns of Mrs. Jerome and Miss Cather
wood are at once the envy and delight of
the Southern ladies. They affect the New
"York fashion of wearing white eowns and
the results are picturesque and more than
satisfactory.
There are some new babies in town and a
corresponding number of delighted parents
and grandparents, who are already busily
mapping out brilliant careers for the won
derful infants. Mr. and Mrs. Robert Cole
man (nee Simpkins) are rejoicing over the
advent of a son, as are also Mr. ana Mrs.
Elliott McAllister (nee Decker).
The Yosemite will doubtless be very gay
this season. All the cavalry have been
ordered to the valley and Colonel Young
will go in command. Wherever the
gallant soldiers _o there is sure to be a
number of fair followers and Yosemite
accommodations are already in great de
mand. Captain Rodgers and Lieutenant
Benson while they are stationed at
Yosemite will have their respective families
at Wawona, about forty-five miles from the
valley.
There is to be another picturesque cot
tage at Burlingame. It is to be built for
Mrs. Frank Carolan, after plans made by the
late Page Brown for his own villa. The
cottage will cost $30,000 and is the gift
of Mrs. Cardan's father, Mr. Pullman.
Mrs. Carolan left during the week for
Chicago, where she goes to attend the
wedding of her sister, Miss Pullman, and a
young Chicago lawyer. .'
Apropos of this wedding a pretty little
story is told that reads like a patriotic act
in an American drama.
Prince Bernstein was one of the heiress'
most persistent suitors, and his marked at
tentions to her were freely commented
upon by the public. With the density
characteristic of foreign nobles, the Prince
arrived at the happy conclusion that to ask
was to receive, in America, and he deter
mined to ask for Miss Pullman's hand.
Now. the Prince being closely allied by
consanguinity to the ruling powers,
crossed the deep blue sea to gain the con
sent of his relatives, the Emperor of Ger
many and the Emperor of Austria. These
noble gentlemen, keenly alive to the favor
an American lady confers when she ac
cepts the name and fame and fortune of a
Countess, hesitated not for a moment, ana
the return steamer landed the Prince on
America's shore.
Then straightway to Papa Pullman did
he go, with the valuable noble '-permits,"
all decorated with the stamps and seals of
state. "So they have given their august
consent, have they?" queried the million
aire, with characteristic brevity; '-bat,
young man, has it occurred to you that to
gain my consent was a different matter?"
And the eagle screeched and the stars and
stripes fluttered on the breeze.
Since the opening night of "Captain
Impudence" there Las been much merry
badinage at the Presidio. On that au
spicious evening Colonel Young invited
a party of twenty-six army friends to at
tend the theater with him and conceived
the delightful plan of taking his guests to
the theater in the Presidio ambulance.
There was a merry start and all went
well until without the reservation at the
Central-avenue gate. The road was
muddy â soft mud and deep mudâ the
ambulance sank to the hubs in the mire.
Officers in full-dress uniform braved the
darkness and tbe mud in a wild search for
planks to raise the vehicle, and after a
generous spattering of mud a second start
was made.
Three blocks were covered safely and
then one of the mules, the leader, neatly
rolled under, while the hind mule, the
"wheeler," lightly stepped over his pros
trate form. More consternation. Lieu
tenant Smedberg was on the "box" seat
and distinguished himself by the graceful
manner in which he held the reins. The
ladies, like true soldiers' wives and lassies,
behaved like stoics' and when the reclin
ing mule had gained his natural posture
everybody dismounted. Colonel Young's
party went home from the theater in the
cars.
The board of directors of the Woman's
Exchange have decided to serve tea and
other refreshments from 4 to half-past 5
o'clock, and will hold their inaugural tea
on Thursday afternoon, April 9, at their
rooms. 26 Post street. Miss May Hoff
man, Miss McKenna, Miss Morgan and
Miss Laura Bates will assist Miss Mc-
Kinstry to wait at the tea table. The
hours will be from 4 until 5:30, and all are
| most cordially invited.

GOLDEN WEDDING SURPRISE.
Mr. and Mrs. P. F. Keith Celebrate Their Fif
tieth Anniversary at San Jose.
Last week Mr. and Mrs. F. F. Keith returned
to their home on the Meridian road, San Jose,
after a visit with triends in different parts of
the State. During their absence their nieces
and nephews, including Mr. and Mrs. F. K.
Bartholomew, Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Bartholo
mew, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Porter, Mr. and Mrs.
J. P. Trapet of San Francisco, and J. B. Collins,
made arrangements to give them a surprise
on Tuesday, March 24, the fiftieth anniversary
of their wedding, and issued invitations for an
'â¢at home" on that day.
The apartments haa been transformed into
bowers of floral beauty. Poppies, marigolds
and yellow roses, intermingled with cedar,
palms, ferns and smilax, banked the mantels,
concealed fireplaces, wreathed the pictures
and brightened every nook and corner.
Refreshments were served on tables decor
ated in green and gold, and during the recep
tion hours, from '_ until 5 o'clock, a great
number- of friends called to offer their good
wishes to the popular host and nostess.
Mr. and Mrs. Keith were married in New
York State in 1840 and in 1850 Mr. Keith vis
ited California, and since that time both he
and his wife spent several winters here until
three years ago, when they determined to
make their home in this valley, and have since
resided on the Meridian road, near Hamilton
avenue.

OCEAN VIEW PROGRESS.
Old- San Miguel Transformed
Into a Handsome Suburban
Section.
A New Engine-House and an Abundant
Supply of Water Make the
People Happy.
Ocean View, with its 3000 inhabitants, is
especially happy now that the Supervisors
aye erected a $5000 house for quartering
an engine and hose cart for the protection
of its property.
This substantial structure has just been ,
completed, and will be occupied by a brand
new engine and hose cart to-morrow. : This, 1
with a water main t lately run from Lake
Mercea, gives the people an abundant sup
ply of water for ail purposes. A Catholic
and Congregational chuch, with a meeting
house .* for the Episcopalians, accom
modate such of the faithful - as may desire
to attend divine worship. In addition to
all these a fine public school is located in
the center of the village, if such it may be
termed.
Notwithstanding all those attractions
and .* improvements, "Frog Pond" ; still
stands in the center portion of the settle-;
ment. This pond has in the past supplied
the French colony, with frogs' legs.' It
was the attractions of the nice, fat batra
chians that made San Miguel I the favorite
resort of the unfortunate frog-catcher,'

SNOW SHOE
TRAVELLING
IN THE SIERRAS
p=srips^HJ_ Sierra Nevada Mountains are
i California 'B greatest winter at-
THE Sierra Nevada Mountains are
California's greatest winter at
â  traction, not for invalids, but for
i__ healthy and robust people. Few
know this, because until this win
ter practically no one visited the moun
tains. This State, too, is one of â  the very
few States of the Union in which snow
shoeing on Norwegian snowshoes can be
enjoyed. In many other States and Ter
ritories, iv Alaska particularly, deep snow
renders the use of snowshoes imperative
for foot travelers, but Canadian snowshoes
are, I believe, nearly everywhere else used
because of the difference in the conditions
of the snow.
Those who visit Truckee and Lake Tahoe
in deep-snow time will certainly set a fine
glimpse of the winter king in his sterner as
pects and a vie of the lake, the size, depth,
nearly absolute purity, and high moun
tain setting of which alone would stamp
this State as being one of great wealth in
scenic mountain attractions. But one
must climb to the summits of the Sierras,
3000 to 4000 feet west of and above Lake
, Tahoe, to know best what the Sierra Ne- 1
vadas really are in deep snow and to be
hold mountain scenery in the time of its
most striking characteristics, of utter isola
tion, sternness and profound beauty inter
mingled, and of immeasurably its greatest
wilclness and frozen adornment.
About twenty years ago, led by my
friend John Muir, I had a summer trip
afoot from Summit Station, by way of
Andersons Peak and Squaw Valley, to
Lake Tahoe. On that trip we were for
two days high up on the range, 2500 to
3000 feet above Tahoe, the lake having an
elevation of 6200 feet. That was a fine and
most inspiriting mountain ramble. I
have just made this same trip on snow
shoes, reversing the route. Accompanied
by three mountaineers and fine snow
shoers, Robert Watson, James McXutt and
George Honsucker Jr., I left Lake Tahoe
at Wards Creek, and went through the
canyon of the same name and over a low
pass into Deer Park Canyon, where snow,
rain and murky weather detained us in
Mr. McNutt's house for thirty-six hours.
On the second day we ascended the range,
on a glorious bracing winter' morning,
with superabundance of '"â ' white every
where, in wealth of sunlight and snow
glitter, but with strong contrast of color
also from the coniferous woods, the color
of which, always somber, became almost
black a soft and velvety blackâ by com
parison with the sun and snow.
The ascent was to me very slow and tire
some work, but it abundantfv repaid one for
the effort. Starting at night, we reached
the summit, at an elevation of 9000 feet, at 1
o'clock, on a great plateau entirely treeless,
because of naked granite surfaces in sum
mer time, but now richly embossed in
white. Surrounding it were trees, but not
the noblest in point of height and girth
the elevation and exposure were too great
for that; but the trees were eminently
hardy, and, therefore, noble specimens of
their species. But the view the wonder
fully varied panorama, rater â what
made the scene worth any price of | money
or effort. : It was one glorious succession
of scenic pictures, never .to: be forgotten.
The views embraced widespread snow
fields, high mountainsâ at one point four
teen summit ridges were in; sight thickly
strewn, deep woods, by their 4 shade dark
ening and hiding the snow; ; canyons,
wide opening in some cases and in others
closed :in as ' narrow, defiles calm, in
tensely blue skies, frequently fleeced with
drawn-out white . cirrus clouds, and ; such
vast vistas as to suggest boundless dis
tances and a boundless land.
These were , the main features ,- of the
high mountain, sub-Arctic-like scenes
through which .we passed. The main
summits were 1000 to 1500 feet above us.
The vast succession of i plateaus, canyons
and ridges j showed the details which "go
to - make up â¢ mountain structure. Lake
Tahoe, with â¢ its ' liquid i floor-level,: lay far
off ' eastward, and at â ; that ' distance ap
peared black, its blue was so intense. The
eastern â¢"< summits ' of . the Washoe â  range
showed up, not in pointed ridges, but in
long and graceful outlined contours, while
Squaw Valley was a great wide depression
in the mountains intensely somber from
thick and dark-colored woods. : .'.,-"
One blessed feature of the scenery west
and south of and, far above the lake was
that the accursed ax had cot laid a single
tree low; that here still was the "forest
primeval.- The valley into which we were
about to descend was one of the most at
tractive features of a scene that was really
indescribable .in its pure and _to human
eyes unusual beauty. ; Grand : it was be
yond description, but more beautiful than
grand, and that is /saying very much.
But, indeed, both elements . were
so mingled that they ' blended,
rather than contended for supremacy.
Emerson said that one needed to
be new j born ' and rebaptized with a
higher than earthly baptism, to be worthy
to walk in his winter hills. How much
more true this is in those high mountains
and in their far ampler ether and higher
and vastly purer ana therefore diviner air.
And over all of this amphitheatric scenery
was the glorious sun, reflecting a light no
where in the world more clear, pure and
intense; yet all of these features were not
so acceptable as the intensity of the still
ness, for it was a calm morning. This still
ness I have frequently noted in my annual
brief snowshoe trips. It is delightful, but
in some respects it is painfulâ so much
glory with so much silence, such wild
grandeur and such widespread beauty with
neither fuss nor noise.
We skirted the base of Andersons Peak
and gradually worked down into the nan
yon of the north fork of the American
River, to the Summit Soda Springs, where
we were received by a fine fellow in charge
of the springs, whose name I have forgot
ten. He was alone, and yet not alone, for
he had as a companion a large noble shep
herd dog whose owner last winter in going
on snowshoes from the springs to Truckee
broke his leg and died there. â¢ But for the
dog his corpse would not have been found.
He barked as we approached but his bark
was really one of welcome. .
We reached the springs, crossing the
range on the way at 6 p. m. after nine and
a half hours' snowshoeing over steep
elevations and descents, traveling in from
six to eight feet of snow only, which is not
nearly enough to level depressions or cover
up all young trees and shrubs. The deeper
the snow the safer and better the snow
shoeing. â¢
The night at the springs was one of deep
rest and enjoyment in a log cabin. The
moon was quarter grown, the sky sparkled
with the most clearly burning stars; the
snow alone would have lightened the dark
ness, while the somber forest formed deep
contrast with the prevalent sky and snow,
light. The springs are by the north fork
of the American River. Falls of about
fifteen feet occur in the river there. There
not being even a breath of wind nothing |
disturbed, the peace profound but these i
falls. They created music to the physical I
ear, but to the mental sense the fall of the
water was at once music, lullaby and ben
ediction. _' ; .- , . : ..
The next morning was one of the finest
I have ever seen in the Sierras. There are
few more beautiful spots in the range
than the Summit Soda Springs. The
view was up steep slopes covered by snow.
It had frozen during the night and these
slopes were consequently glazed with ice.
They glittered as they ran upward in the
clear sunlight. - The morning was so calm
that the â¢ conifers, seemed to be immov
able pillars. The chorus of singing water
falls and birds was continuous. The far- j
off eastern summits, towering away above
and beyond where we were, capped and
crowned the picture.
How many such ' elevated mountain
gardens of Goa we * have in the Sierra
Nevada and how few r ever visit them in
their winter, flowering time â flowering
time, not in the botanical, but meteorolo
gical sense! Each cry. of snow â their
number innumerableâ is a starli_e flower
of | the most â¢ wonderfully varied pattern,
invariable as to the number of its petals.
These flowers are not evanescent, either,
until the heat of - early summer and
nature's call for other flowers, liquefies the
snow into our mountain â  streams and
rivers, ' not surpassed in ; the world for
purity and beauty the sun when he shines
upon them, gilding these ''pale streams
with heavenly alchemy." These moun
tain streams descend rapidly and are
broken over rocky channels. They are
thus fully aerated and when aerated are
whitened into cascades composed of water
and air â as it were made visible. When
air and water are thus mingled they are so
greatly beautified as to be almost spiritual
ized, the water vanishing in one sense as
water, that it may be uplifted into air. A
day at the Summit Soda Springs, in the full
glory of winter is worth & month in
summer, with full remembrance of how
glorious the verdure, the mountain flowers
and the forest then are in the latter season.
We set out the next day for Summit
station, climbing on the trip to an eleva
tion of about 2600 feet above the springs,
although the altitude of the springs is
only 1000 feet less than that of the railroad
crossing over the summit. But in going
from the first to the last mentioned place
it was necessary to climb over the back
bone of the range, where the . streams
divide, some running eastward to the
Truckee River and the State of Nevada
and the rest westward to the branches of
the American River, and finally to their
salt sovereign, the Pacific. On the back
bone named, always wind swept, and,
therefore, naked as to trees or shrubs, we
encountered a very strong wind. In a

MRS; NETTIE HARRISON,
DERMATOLOGIST, '
40-43 GEAJR, ST., ; Â San Jbranelsco. I
snowstorm below freezing point one would
freeze to death speedily at that point.
Some of the slopes we encountered in
descending the mountains were over half
a mile in length, ana', were excessively
steep. Even our best men had to sit down
on their snowshoes in the descent, while I,
less experienced and far more awkward,
used my heels for brakes. One of these
slopes was so very steep as to be dancer
bus to any one but a good suowshoer. The
sliding snowshoes rush down hill, and are
the real delight of that form of .exercise,
and are full recompense to those who can
make them properly -for the long, slow,
'â  heavy-breathing ascents of the summits.
Having only a week a year at snowshoe
ing, and going at once from the level of
the sea to elevations* of 6000 to 9000 feet,
one cannot be a real expert on the shoes
or do more than maintain half the pace of
a man experienced at the business and
living constantly in the rarefied air. But
the fine fellows I had with me were always
willing to give me time and the beat pair
of snowshoes for the immediate work in
hand. They knew that I was willing to
pay the full price for the labor and fatigue
involved in -getting:. away up into the
mountains in deep-snow time, which is so
far ahead of any other season in beauty
and sparkling magnificence of both snow
and sky that there can be no possible com
parison between them. No one can under
stand the superiority or far greater fascina
tion of the mountains under winter's glit
tering and glorious rain but he who nas
himself visited the highest portions of the
range in both summer and winter."
I have claimed with Mr. Watson a series
of snowshee trips from Summit . station
southward for next winter. The late 11. B.
Redding, who had been often there, once
told me that a wagon road with very easy
grades might be built from the summit
southward for a distance of fifty miles.
One may thus keep at the highest eleva
tions continuously without experiencing
the fatigue 1 did of alternate steep ascents
and descents.
Speaking for myself and with strong
love for various kinds of physical exercise,
I can say that not one of them approaches
snowshoeing in tbe keen air one breathes,
the elevations attained, the glorious sights
seen, the health and strength acquired,
and the sense of pride that follows indulg
ence in this manly kind of open-air work.

OVERCAUTION and a stupid un
readiness to recognize the possi
ble truth contained in a fragment
of manuscript which has lain un
heeded in my desk these many
days explain my long withholding of a
auggestion that is as wonderful as terrible.
But when the circumstances of my secur
ing possession of the document are related
there may be found some palliation of my
stupidity. It came about in this wise:
One day while I was seated at my desk |
an uncouth middle-aged man slouched
into the room and handed me a card on
which my name had been written and
asked me if I was the person indicated. I
answered affirmatively. The man, regard
ing me with a manner that suggested fear
and loathing, fished out a tattered parcel,
handed it to me and was quickly escaping
when I had the presence of mind to halt
him.
"Who are you," I asked," "and who
Bent me this?"
The fellow spoke English very lamely,
but it was evident that he feared me and
dare not try to evade my questions. He
was a Portuguese sailor. A few years be
fore his advent in my office he had been
cast away on an island in the South Paci
fic There he was taken care of by a white
man who spoke many languages, but
whose nationality could not be deter
mined. All the other inhabitants of the
island were the native savages of the place,
and they regarded the white man with a
sentiment composed of awe, fear and
veneration. -The sailor remained upon the
island nearly a year, serving the white
man, and then, being no longer able to
bear the life which he was compelled to
lsad, he stole one of the primitive boats
us-d by the natives, and with a blanket
for an improvised sail left the island. To
his great astonishment he found the white
man waiting for him on the beach the
night of his escape, although he might
have known that nothing could escape
the knowledge of this extraordinary per
son. The white man, to the sailor's sur
prise and delight, made no demur to the
servant's desire to leave, but on the con
trary gave him some gold and precious
stones, informed him what general course
to take in order to fall in with trading ves
sels, and handed him the manuscript and
the card bearing ray name, with the
solemn injunction to seek me out in San
Francisco and deliver the manuscript to
me, whether that might happen one year
or twenty years thence. Should the sailor
neglect this duty he would be visited with
terrible penalties from unseen sources, and
would never have good luck until the mis
sion had been accomplished.
In all this the narrator, a man of primi
tive intelligence, had an unmistakable air
of sincerity, but it puzzled me greatly to
observe that he feared me thoroughly and
was eager to leave my presence. Seeking
to take advantage of this I demanded to
know what he had seen so terrible on the
island, what the name of his white master
was and why I had been selected as the
final custodian of the document. I was
led to this by the discovery that the manu
script had been so badly worn by the
sailor's care as to have lost its beginning
and end and so to have become utterly un
intelligible. The remaining part of it read
like a delirious tale of impossible things.
My aggressive attitude threw the poor
fellow into the most distressing and help
less confusion. He called upon the Sacred
Mary to witness that he was an honest
man and had done his duty, and that
never of his own will had he harmed a
living soul. The things which the white
man had compelled him to do woujd
Burely be forgiven by the good God in
heaven, for he had prayed humbly and
long to the holy Savior for his interces
sion. Thereupon my visitor broke down
and wept piteousiy. An ague of horror
and contrition racked all his bones and I
was forced to let him go, believing that
his mind had been sadly weakened by
some dreadful experience and that to tor
ture him further would be murder. Since
that visit I have not seen him to this day,
but I trust that good fortune attends him.
With the greatest care 1 studied the
manuscript and all the circumstances at
tending its delivery. The man's honesty
could not be doubted. The writing on the
card was identical with that of the manu
script and hence both had been written
and sent to me by the- same person. Evi
dently the manuscript in its original form
contained a full explanation of its appar
ent absurdities and impossibilities, and
certainly the writer had furnished his
name. Either he knew me personally or
had sent the manuscript as a friendly act,
or had seen my name somewhere and de
sired that I should make literary or sci
entific use of the paper which he had sent
me. A vague impression haunted me that
there was a familiar aspect in the penman
ship, but 'the most careful reflection did
not enable me to recall a person of my ac
quaintance who could tit all the require
ments of the case. As these failures on
my part rendered the fragment worthless,
and as the document itself lacked a neces
sary explanation it would have been idle
for me to publish it.
A recent combination of circumstances,
including a careful review -of works on
anatomy, physiology and surgery, and
a comparison of the penmanship of
the document with that of all my
old correspondents, suddenly 'filled the
strange production with a ' semblance
of light. The result, if I have
guessed anything like the truth,' is so
startling and terrible and suggests, a
criminal possibility of so overshadowing
magnitude that I deem a full exposition
of the matter right and timely. - I shall
premise an introduction of the fragment
: with the assertion that the author in my
opinion is none other than Dr. Entrefort,
whose astounding and miraculous achieve
ments in medicine and surgery are already
familiar in part to some of my readers.
That I did not at once guess him as the
author of the writing discloses a grievous
stupidity on ;my part, for not only is he
my old-time friend, and not only has he in
the past furnished me with material for
some of the most gruesome things that I
have published, but he is the only man in
all the world having the originality and
daring to conceive and carry out the awful
experiments with which he unmistakably
has had so marvelous success. And lam
the only person to whom he would have
sent the account of his labors. Happily
for him he is operating in a part of the
world where he is free from the danger of
punishment.
. The fragment, which I shall follow with
my own explanation of its meaning, is as
follows, although a considerable margin
must be admitted for errors arising from
the sadly mutilated and blurred condition
I of the writing:
The Fragmentary Document.
* * * than at the beginning. At first
the very greatest tact and patience were
required to convince the natives that the
changes which were coming over them
were to their advantage. During the
earlier experiments I had not learned to
specialize the functions of the gland, or to
regard that obscure organ as a complex
mechanism capable of differentiation.
Moreover, the means which I then em
ployed for stimulating it into morbid ac
tivity were crude and the results indeter
minate by prognosis. 1 have measurably
overcome those difficulties and uncertain
ties by the means which I have already
described, and can now proceed with
reasonably exact expectations.
I had already ascertained beyond doubt
that the monsters known to the civilized
world as giants were the product of a spon
taneous abnormal activity in the gland,
and that acromegaly, the greater enlarge
ment of one side of the body than the
I other, was a variation of that activity.
Those two facts taken together were suffi
cient as a suggestion of the possibilities
residing in an artificial stimulation con
ducted with a view to produce definitive
variations from the uniform enlargement
resulting in a symmetrical giant.
This race is puny, the result of unintel
ligent feeding. Hence I would take a
native not yet grown and by general
stimulation and excessive feeding of the
gland, combined with the administration
of abundant wholesome food, he would
rapidly develop generally into, a symmet
rical giant, attaining in three or four years
a height exceeding that of the average by
from two to four feet, with a correspond
ing excess of weight. As the natives
never before had seen creatures of such
size they were terrified and ; sought the
good graces of their gods. It was impos
sible for me to conceal my agency in the
matter, and so I had to assume the role
of chief god and convince them that their
transformation into giants was proper and
for their own good. This does not mean
to say that I did not stalk amidst perils
for a long time before I came to exercise
this moral power. It would require much
space for me to narrate the entire history.
My success among them in the practice of
ordinary medicine, and surgery was the
greatest source of my influence, but you
rrinst not infer from this declaration that
it by any means covers the most: interest
ing feature of a truly wonderful and com
plex experience. ..-'â ,.
. A great aid to me in the advanced exper
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1896.
iments which accompanied and followed
my discovery of a means for developing
special functions in the gland was the ad
vent on the island of a shipwrecked Por
tuguese sailor. This man, though of alow
order of intelligence, judged from the Eu
ropean standard, had a mind vastly supe
rior to that of the natives, and his grati
tude to me for my kindly treatment of him
and my ability to utilize his religious char
acter through his fears made him devoted
to my service. It is by the hands of this
man that I am sending to you this hur
riedly written account of my work. It has
been pitiful to observe the horror and re
pugnance which ray experiments excited
in his uneducated mind. At last he lias
prepared to escape from me and from the
terrible things which he sees and which he
aids me in bringing about, and although
he thinks that I am unaware of his inten
tion I shall meet him on the beach and
forward his effort to get away.
This Portuguese is a powerful fellow.
Hence his strength is often useful, as some
of the work which I do is excessively pain
ful to the subjects, and the sailor is very
clever at tying knots, making tourniquets
and inducing unconsciousness by tracheal
or carotid pressure with his fingers. I
trust that the skill which he has acquired
SOME HAD ARMS SIX FEET LONG.
in these arts under my instruction will not
cause the appearance of a maniacal strang
ler when the fellow shall finally land at
San Francisco.
Another factor which appeared in aid of
my enterprise was the kindness and gen
tleness of disposition discovered by the
giants whom I produced. At first these
prodigious creatures had so formidable a
look that they filled the people at large
with terror, but presently, when it was
learned that they were really very decile,
had enormous strength that was useful
on occasion and ; generally died young,
they became quite acceptable. Among
the ways which the native ingenuity found
to utilize them was the fording of deep
streams with others on their backs, the
extermination of huge snakes which swal
lowed infants, and the plucking of fruits
growing above the reach of ordinary men.
Now comes the most interesting part of
the accountâ the; specialization of the
glandular functions. Acromegaly; had
given the clew to that possibility.*: The
problems presented for solution were these:
1. Did acromegaly indicate that the
gland, instead of being a homogeneous
body, was divided into hemispheres, each
hemisphere attending to the nourishing of
a side of the body?
2. As each side of the body is composed
of many and unlike parts and as they in
some instances were unevenly developed,
how could it be assumed that each hemi
sphere of the gland had a homogeneous
constitution?
3. Assuming that the gland was a very
complex mechanism; having a special
function supplying building, material
for each distinct? part of the body, how
might each =or any number of these func
tions be stimulated separately for the pro
duction of such definite results as the en
largement of one or more particular parts
selected for that purpose?
You will thus see that the study was ex
ceedingly difficult, but I am happy to an
nounce that I have mastered the begin
ning of it. That is to say I can produce a
man, otherwise normal as to shape,' with
one arm a yard longer. than the other, or
with an ear of dimensions so ample that
he can wrap it about his head for a cover
ing.
It will at . once be evident to you that
there must be a corollary of excessive arti
ficial stimulation, namely, an atrophied
. result. Thus, â in the case of a man for I
whom I produced an arm ; six feet long, I
exercised such an influence on the func
tion determining the size of his other arm
as to cause it not only to cease growing in
infancy, but actually to dwindle to an in
significant and. useless appendage. A curi
ous and unexpected result of this experi
ment was a shifting of the normal arrange
ment of the thoracic bones, so that the
long arm seemed to issue from the center
of the chest, the palm upturned, a' natural
conservation of the feeding habit.
The general anatomical characteristics
of these people are similar to those of
other races. This means that rudimentary
hair covers the body, as with us, and that
the coccyx in embedded. You may infer
the extent to which I have carried the dif
ferentiations of the gland's functions when
I inform you that by proper treatment I
can restore the original simian abundance
of hair and cause the coccyx to emerge
and form a true tail. An embarrassing ac
companiment of the caudal experiment is
the eventual ossification of the joints. You
are aware that in infancy the coccyx is
jointed and flexible but that in time it be
comes rigid, forming a bone of continuous
structure. The result has been followed
exactly in the cases of those for whom my
treatment has induced a tailâ the appen
dage in time becomes rigid, and in that
condition is exceedingly annoying, re
quiring the wearers, in the absence of 'am
putation, to carry about with them a
sharp-pointed stick, with which they make
a hole in the ground for the reception of
the tail before sitting down.
1 have not time to set forth further de
tails of my experiments. The formula;
which I send herewith might be sub
mitted for test to some competent physi
cian of your acquaintance in order that the
truth of my discoveries may be proved.
You will be aware, however, that a general
knowledge of these , matters would be ex
ceedingly
Thus the fragment abruptly ends, with
nothing explained. Entrefort does not
even say, so far as this writing goes, that
he will ever return to civilization and clear
up the mystery.
I venture with much hesitation to sug
gest that the gland to which he refers is
the pituitary gland, that- obscure little
organ which lies on the under side of the
brain at the point where the optic nerves
cross on their way to the visual centers.
This, is merely a guess. ' Possibly some
person more scientific than I who may
happen to read this will.be able to sugeest
a better explanation. I will add this
I much only: That I know Entrefort to be
an extraordinary man and honest in what
I he says, and that if it was really he who
i wrote this account it is entitled to respect
ful attention.

MURDERED HER BABES.
Verdict of a Coroner's Jury in
the Tragedy of the Deuss
Family.
THE WOMAN WAS INSANE.
Owing to the Ncn- Arrival of a Brother
cf the Woman the Cremation
Is Delayed.
H. O. Deuss retold the story of his
domestic troubles to Coroner Hawkins and
a jury yesterday, : and the jury decided
that his wife was insane when she killed
her children and herself in her Guerrero
street home on Monday night.
The first inquest was held on the mother.
Deuss, who has somewhat recovered from
the shock of the tragedy, testified that he
last saw his wife and children alive at 8
o'clock on Monday evening. Mrs. Deuss
seemed to be in good spirits at that time.
She was subject to fits of insanity and
several times charged him with unfaith
fulness. One evening, about four weeks :
ago, she followed him, and when he re- â 
turned home later she declared that she
had seen him in the company of a blonde
woman. Since the tragedy he had learned
that his wife had visited a clairvoyant,
who had told her that he (Deuss) was un
faithful to her and was in the habit of con
sorting with other women.
- He was certain that as a result of her
visits to the medium her mind had been
upset, and attributed her actions to this
affliction. On one occasion she called at
his place of business in the Thurlow block
on -Kearny street, and charged him with
having a woman closeted in the place. She
was insanely jealous of him, and as a
result of her temperament they had several
quarrels. He upbraided her for her care
lessness in not correcting the children
when they did wrong, and wrote her
brother at Chicago that her conduct was
driving him crazy. His wife said to him
one day that if he died she would not live
after him. She loved him very much, and
they were happy in their domestic relations
except for her jealousy.
Henry Fricke, a grocer, testified to
knowing Mrs. Deuss in ncr lifetime. She
had asked him several times the name of
the woman with whom her husband kept
company. He had told her that he had
never seen Deuss in the company of any
woman.
The verdict of the jury was to the effect
that Gretchen, Freda and Charles Deuss
"came to their death at .09}. Guerrero
street, on March 31, from asphyxiation by
illuminating gas," and that "they were
murdered by their mother, Olga Deuss.
while temporarily insane," and that "Olga
Deuss committed suicide." ';.:;>
The mother and three children will be
cremated Tuesday morning. A brother of
the dead woman, George Krieger, was ex
pected to arrive from Chicago yesterday,
and owing to his delay the cremation was
postponed.

Enigmatic Menu Cards to Stimulate
Mental Activity While You Eat.
. Enigmatic menu cards, writes Laura
Douglas in an article on "Easter Menu
Cards," in April Ladies' Home Journal,
are important factors to the enjoyment of
guests at a dinner. On such cards blue
points may, masquerade as "Cerulean
dots" or "Colored angels." The shaddock,
which is so often used for the first course,
has been hidden under the phrase, "Fish
and low. 1 " duck). Soup is described
according to its kind, as "Make-believe
terrapin" (mock-turtle), "Love-apple
broth" (tomato), or a dozen other names
which Will occur after a few moments'
thought. For fish the antique joke of
"Poison" (poisson), or else it is described by
its kind. Shad is known as "Bones," smelts
as "Refines," salmon as "A scriptural
character." cod as "A fashionable wrap"
(Cape Cod), and trout as "Giraffes" (spec
kled beauties). "A character in Ivanhoe"
can hide "F. de Beef," the. initial repre
senting both "Fillet" and the gigantic
"Front." "Our National bird" will dis
guise not the eagle but the turkey. "So

back" the canvasback variety. Salad
appears as "Nothing but leaves," or in
case a mayonnaise of celery is used as
"Below stairs-v" (cellar-y). Cheese is
called "Slang,'* from "Cheese it," or is
ignored with crackers, which are others
wise called "Favors," from the children's
fancy crackers. Dessert is hailed as "An
arid plain," with icecream as "An oasis,"
"Frozen milk-tops" or "A mockery king

BUXDAY?. APRIL 6, 1896
THE CALL .PEAKS FOR ALL.
! Easter morning is with us.
Every bonnet has a beauty in it.
The churches will be full of loveliness
to-day.
Consider the lilies, how they blowâ they
don't need trumpets.
There is such a thing as striking too
hard and making the iron too hot.
There is but one woman question this
morning: 'Is my bonnet on straight?"
Europe occasionally buries the hatchet,
but the never washes off the war paint.
Some of the noise of the coming month
will be politics, but a good deal of it will
be picnics.
Cheer up, cherries are ripeâ a carload
has already gone East to cheer them up
over there.
We may as well admit that no spring
ever raw more sweet tilings in milliner}*
than this one.
The Republican campaign in this City
la now fairly under way and the emphasis ;
is on the fairly.
Even those who live in debt in Califor
nia are in a better state than those who
live anywhere else.
The new bonnet is necessary to illumi
nate the church, but any old hat will do to
take op the collection.
This is a good day to remember that
there is sometimes as much virtue in old 1
clothes as in new ones.
The cause of liberty may be truly said 1
to be in the air of Cuba, for the climate is i
death to the Spaniards.
It looks more and more as if a part of
onr political campaign this year will have
to be fought for tree Cuba.
Ten chances to one the Easter parade in
the stormy East will be ruffled by a bliz
zard or froze out with a cold snap.
Woman exults in her millinery and
adorns her church with a radiant loveli
ness of style, out as for man, he isn't in it.
Eos Angeles has about arrived at the
conclusion that it would be better to have
two harbors in her hand than none in the
bush.
Mr. Depew predicts such a glowing
future for our wine industry there can
hardly fail to be something of a profit in
bis talk.
As Weyler c">i__.Â« to be well satisfied
with the progress of the war in Cuba it is
evident he has not undertaken the job by
contract.
The best country to mediate with Spain
for the surrender of ber American colo
nies would be England. She knows how
it is herself.
â¦
Now that Redwood has a big new clock
on the tower of her High School building
.he can count on having a high time
always in sight.
Between the Senate and the Chamber of
Deputies in Franco there is a gap big
enough to dump a dozen Cabinets in with
out tilling it up.
Â«
There must be something wrong some
where, for while this is decidedly a bad
year for strikes we are getting more of
them than usual.
The British invaded Matabeleland in the
expectation of finding gold, but as they
found none it seems they must be holding
on to it just for spite.
Takins money from the people of Cali
fornia to contribute to Tammany cam
paign fund is Huntington's latest way of
showing he has money enough to burn a
wet dog.
The carload of Solano cherries which has
already started East will be something
more than a surprise party to the natives.
It will astonish them and make them open
their mouths.
The beauty of the weather is making
everybody impatient for the festivals to
begin, and the one that opens first will
have a big show of visitors from all the
country round.
Â»
The office-holders' faction of the Demo
cratic party demands gold, while the out
siders are willing to stand up for silver,
but all of them are out for the stuff in one
way or another.
â  >
The New Hampshire squabble may now
be considered settled, and in the New
England band at the St. Louis convention
there will be none but Reed instrument*
laying in harmony.
It has been discovered that Dean Hole's
book on his tour in America refers to our
first President as George Augustas Wash
ington and there seems to be no way to
make him take it back.
Eastern whitecaps are playing in bad
luck this year, for three times in as many
months in different parts of the country
have their movements for reform betn met
with bullets and badly crippled.

EASTER IN CALIFORNIA.
One is tempted to believe that a special
sun is sent to rise in California on Easter
morning, were it not that the same sun
appears on Christmas day ana the Jewish
New Year, and is known to be a sun for
all that makes for goodness and comfort
and prosperity. Undoubtedly the same
sun shines for all the world, but not with
the genial mellowness that it sheds in the
making of such comfortable aids and such
gorgeous fruits and flowers as serve to
proclaim its glories in California. There
is no penitential season for this persistent
guardian of our happiness. Its whole
course is a round of Fat Tuesdays, with no
succeeding Ash Wednesdays, no forty
days of penitence. And it fabricates a be
coming Easter bonnet for all of its chil
dren every day in the year.
To the earnest multitudes for whom a
Lord is risen this day, Easter Sunday
comes with a special and noble grace. The
commemoration of so touching and fruit
ful an event in the history of the world is
made with a serious spirit of gladness
which typifies an emersion from suffering
to ease, and from sorrow to that chastened
happiness out of which individual content
and community sympathy are born. Tho
beauty of it all is the universal value of
the ideas which the day represents. This,
although the proportion of the people for
whom it has most direct interest is not
comprehensive, may be taken to explain
the respect which it commands far beyond
the limits of its immediate pressure. It
is almost as regnant as Christmas. The
principles for which it stands will operate
for the good of the race so long as error
prevails, human reliance upon unseen
and all-controlling forces is acknowledged
and the need of humility and companion
ship are manifest.
The fitness of the day to the natural con
ditions aiding its effectiveness is a con
spicuous quality of its advent in California.
Though it is proper that our worldly ener
gies should have been kept in partial
slumber for the more serious contempla
tion of possibilities lying beyond this life,
it is equally proper that, having laid aside
the penitential spirit, we should face with
rejuvenated vigor the earthly problems
that await our solving and that bear bo
close a relation to any conception of
eternal happiness. No good thing can be
adequately enjoyed unless it has been
earned. No ship may be expected to come
in that has not been sent out. Sitting in
patient idleness at our doors is the great
problem of discharging the trust which
we accepted when we made, our homes in
California. We and we only know what
high and lasting benefits may accrue to
the race from our earnest and intelligent
discharge of this obligation, and the
knowledge that we alone are aware of our
responsibility to ourselves and mankind
should not cause us to avoid a duty for
the performance of which no outsiae pres
sure is brought to bear. Here we must
establish the American center of intelli
gence and here plant the storehouse of our
Nation's integrity and wealth.
FOSTERING THE SUBURBS.
The people of Belvedere have given the
railroad to understand that any curtail
ment of the present service will be met by
an independent line of ferry steamers be
tween that place and San Francisco and a
connecting electric road to San Rafael.
An interesting feature of the matter is
that those who have submitted this ulti
matum have abundant Capital to make
their threat good, and doubtless would
find the investment profitable. Unfor
tunately this is rarely the case. As a rule
city and country improvements made on
the basis of what is assumed to be a per
manently established service are com
pletely at the mercy of transportation
companies, and must suffer whatever losses
may result from a change in the service
or its total abolition. In the good time
coming it may be deemed proper to require
that transportation companies should
share the risk with those whose invest
ments have been determined by an exist
ing transportation service. It is hardly
right that the matter should be entirely
one-sided.
The whole region contiguous to San
Francisco has claims as strong as they are
varied. The corporate body of the people
has never opposed the use of this region
by the resident** of the City for transient
or permanent out-of-town homes. From
Menlo Park, on the south, all the way
round the eastern shore of the bay to San
Rafael on the north, thousands of the
wealthiest residents of San Francisco have
established country homes or temporary
resting places, and these suburban resorts
constitute one of the most valuable attrac
tions of the City.
San Rafael, Sausalito and Belvedere on
the north, Berkeley, Oakland, Fruitvale
and Alameda on the east, and the beauti
ful settlements lying between Belmont
and Palo Alto on the south attest the
elegant taste and a true appreciation of
California's rarest charms on the part of
San Francisco residents. By a fortunate
circumstance all these places except those
on the north enjoy a perfect service by
reason of the fact that the Southern Pa
cific Company has an interest in main
taining the service. A class of people
similar to those served by it live in the
northern settlements, and they are show
ing their grit and independence by an
nouncing that the conditions upon which
they based their investments shall be
maintained. It is encouraging to observe
this spirit in Californians.
Belvedere is unique as well as beautiful.
The island is bathed â¢in sunshine when
San Francisco is wrapped in fog, and yet
it enjoys every one of the comfortable and
inspiriting features of the coast climate.
A few miles back in the mountains nestles
San Rafael with a totally different set of
climatic conditions. These are identical
with those of San Jose, where coast and
interior influences are blended in perfect
proportions. As a result Belvedere and
San Rafael have large numbers of wealthy
residents whose financial interests are
centered in , San Francisco, and they will
be doing the City a valuable service in see
ing that adequate transportation facilities
are maintained.
WORKING SOUTHWARD.
The hauling of the first carload of grain
over the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad last Friday was the begin
ning of tho new era for the southern half
of the great interior basin of California.. It
was only a short haul and the "train" con
sisted merely of a locomotive and one car;
but they were of the best and latest de
sign, they were drawn over a track com
bining the most recent achievements in
constructive engineering, and the load of
grain was laid down at tidewater, where
barges may take it cheaply to Port Costa to
be loaded into deep-water ships for Liver
pool.
That is an eloquent story, though
short. ; The function of the northern ter
minus of the Valley ro_d ceases at Stock
ton. There water â¢ competition and low
rates are encountered. ;. This is an advan
tage which the San Joaquin Valley has
never had an opportunity in the past to
enjoy. The only benefit that tidewater at
Stockton has ever brought to those parts
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1896.
of the valley remote from Stockton was se
cured by hauling produce in wagons over
terrible roads. Even that expensive and
laborious course has been pursued with
profit for many years. The Valley road
will abolish that grievous practice neces
sary to profitable farming in the valley.
The road has been completed to the
Tuolumne River, contracts for finished
construction have been let' to Merced, and
the grading contract for a distance of
twenty-rive miles beyond has been signed.
All legal difficulties concerning rights of
way through incorporated cities and towns
having been settled by the Supreme Court
in favor of the new road, it is now only a
matter of rapid construction and the secur
ing of necessary material. The few con
demnation suits for right of way over pri
vate properly will not operate as a hin
drance. Visalia is happy over the an
nouncement that the first of the lines to be
constructed between Fresno and Bakers
field will pass through that city.
Had this great enterprise been launched
on any factitious principle, it would not
have been so eagerly welcomed as a deliv
erance from the burdens which have pre
vented the proper development of the mag
nificent empire which it traverses. Not
only is it the work of strong capitalists
of enterprise, energy and independence,
but it is peculiarly fortunate in two other
particulars. One is that the road traverses
a region sufficiently developed to give it
an immediate traffic, which, under ordi
nary competition, would insure a profitable
return at the start, and the other is the
fact that it is eagerly w-lcomed as a de
liverance from a .ruinous monopoly, and
hence will receive far more than the ordi
nary share of traffic. The financial fore
sight which led to this undertaking was
an uncommon manifestation of business
acumen on the part of Californians, and
everybody will rejoice in the prosperity ,
that must attend their enterprise.
A MASSACHUSETTS INCIDENT.
There has been recently a little transac
tion in Boston that will be of interest to
this coast. The people of that city have
been engaged for some time past in an ef
fort to bring about the erection of a larger
and more commodious railway station
than they now possess, and a good
deal of negotiation concerning it has
been going on among the citizens,
the t State authorities and the rail
way officials. The president of one of
the roads interested, being about to leave
Boston for a trip to California, was re
ported to have said in an interview that
the roads have done all they intend to do,
and that "it now remains for the public to
say whether or not they will accept our
proposition."
Such a statement from a railroad official
in California would hardly occasion re
mark. In Massachusetts, however, it was
regarded as an insult, and promptly taken
up. The Boston Journal, commenting on
it. said:
This reads a good deal like what is called in
the diplomacy of nations an "ultimatum."
But, if Mr. Clark and his associates will pardon
us ior saying so, the Journal believes that the
ultimatum is the privilege not of the railroad,
but of the people of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts, acting throu.h their Legisla
ture. The legislature is not likely to rest con
tent with a ''take it or leave it" from corpora
tions which owe their existence to its acts.
Mr. Clark is essentially a Massachusetts man,
but possibly his recent years of familiarity
with the legislative methods of Connecticut in
cases involving railroads has caused him to
forget the quality, the spirit and the sense of
public obligation of the. Legislature of Massa
chusetts.
"When President Clark read that editorial
on his westward trip he hastened to tele
graph back an explanation and a partial
denial, which the Journal accepted with a
warning to the railway men that they
were acting too independently anyway,
and that it was time for them to under
stand that the settlement of all questions
of the new depot which Boston needs de
pends not upon the officials of the roads,
but upon the people of Massachusetts.
President Clark, on his arrival in Cali
fornia, will be shown many things of
which we are proud and which, no doubt,
will impress him greatly. He will find
here a delightful climate, a fertile soil and
a land fruitful of prunes and railroad ulti
matums. Much that he sees will doubt
less entice him to forswear Boston and
make his home with us, but let us hone
that he will see nothing in the whole wide
domain of California that will lead him
"to forget the quality, the spirit and the
sense of ", public obligation of the Legisla
ture of Massachusetts."
FOS GOOD CITY PAVEMENTS.
Within the next year San Francisco will â 
in ail probability witness a reformation in |
the condition of its street pavements that
will result in their being a pleasure and a
pride to our residents instead of a nui
sance and a disgrace, as many of them
now are. '
Some of the most powerful forces of
the community are now engaged in
the attempt to bring about the
change from streets paved with cob
bles, ruinous alike to vehicles and tem
pers, to those properly treated with
bituminous rock. While the use of
bituminous pavements was in its ex
perimental stage, there was much outcry
against its wearing qualities, but the
tests it has undergone for the past ten
years have shown that when laid accord
ing to approved methods it is by far the
most economical and satisfactory roadway
that has been devised for city streets.
How important and desirable the trans
formation of cobbled streets to bituminous
is considered may be readily gathered
from the simultaneous agitation, with
that object in view, now being carried on
by two of the most influential factors in
terested in public improvements â the
Merchants' Association and the wheel
men. While the one is almost wholly,
interested from motives of pride in the
appearance and condition of the City, the
other's interest is, while perhaps more
personal and selfish, no less a proper and
commendable one. In the face of this move
ment, which has now gathered good head
way, and which is bound to gain in
strength, it is difficult lo see how, in
making its appropriations for the next
fiscal year, the Board of Supervisors can
fail to provide funds for prosecuting this
work of giving San ' Francisco more good
roads. * â

century would enjoy most.

OBSERVATIONS AUD REFLECTION
Crossing the bay the other morning I
was not a little interested in watching a
man feeding the seagulls. Having thought
fully provided himself with a loaf of
bread, he crushed, bits of it into little
pasty balls and tossed them at the birds as
they passed, and soon had a spirited
throng m the , wake of the ferry-boat.
Some of the birds, in their eagerness, flew
quite close to where ..this good Samaritan
was sitting, perilously balanced on the
rail, and some, but not all, became quite
expert in catching the dainty morsels on
the fly, while others, missing again and
again and: having to descend each time to
the water to scramble for what j they got,
soon learned their proper sphere and re
mained on a lower level, content to get as
best they could the little which' escaped
the vigilance of their more capable com
panions. They knew their place and kept
it. Very pretty . were these little ships of
the sea and the air, tossing and tacking
and performing evolutions which Uncle
Sam's white squadrons might imitate in
vain, but the inequality in capability was
about as apparent among these feathered
bipeds as among those other bipeds clad
in worsteds and mohairs up in the strug
gling City. . .
There is now and ever has been - more or
less discussion relative to the natural in
equality of the sexes, and from this time
on to next election day California is likely
to hear much of it; but there is, at least,
one particular in which it must be con
fessed that the wives and mothers of this
great American commonality manifest an
easy superiority over their husbands and
brothers, and that is in their, ability to
handle hot dishes without physical dis
comfort. "What! do you call that hot?"
a woman will ask, in derision, as she takes
from your agitated fingers a dish which
has fairly scorched them, although you
have done your best at shifting it from
hand to hand and finger to finger; "why,
I could hold that dish all day." "Pity
moveth the heart to love," is an old
proverb, and it may have been a true
proverb in some time or place, but the
pity your wife feels for you when she finds
you dancing about, snapping your fingers,
after having tried to adjust a lamp chim
ney set awry, or to take from the stove a
hot-handled frying-panâ that sort of pity
moves their heart to derisiveness of spirit.
It must be admitted on behalf of women
that they enjoy unrivaled good fortune in
being able to keep out of jail. Vital sta
tistics compiled from the last census re
turns show that for every ten thousand
men in America 23.6 of them were peep
ing from behind bars, while of each ten
thousand women in our country only 2.10
are restrained of their liberty. Why should
a class of beings so little restrained of
their liberty be so solicitous for yet greater
liberty? Do they expect to keep altogether
out of jail? .-â â -â 
I encountered a group of four or five
men the other day standing interestedly
about a little, shallow pool of water which
had oozed from an adjacent hillside watch
ing a little hair-like, writhing object which
one of the party had suspended on a lead
pencil. There was much discussion as to
what the object was, some averring that it
was an infantile reptile; but at least two
of the party asserted, and offered to back
the assertion with good, hard coin, that
the little object was not yet a snake but a
horsehair turning into a snake. Straight
way my mind went back to my old swim
ming days when I, too, was boyishly cred
ulous and thought it possible for horse
hairs to turn into snakes; but even in
those days I proved the falsity of the popu
lar belief by plucking hairs from the tail
of my pony and bottling them in water,
putting them in watering troughs and
watching them day by day for weeks and
weeks, yet not one of them ever turned
into a snake or anything at all, though
watched never so closely. These grown
up men certainly ought to have known
that spontaneous generation is an ex
ploded idea and that dead things do not
turn into live things to live and wriggle, as
this little object unmistakably did, but
there was not one in the crowd who was
so confident of this that he dared accept
the proffered wager. Of course the wrig
gler was nothing but a little brother earth
worm, gordius by name, whose larva* find
a home within the bodies of spiders and
other insects, but the incident serves to
show that men are but boys of a larger
growth, not yet so familiar with science as
to altogether escape boyish credulity.
I was brought up on breakfast, dinner
and supper and so were most Eastern and
Western people, and these people are
everywhere attended with dyspepsia.
Farther south there are some people
who were Drought up on breakfast, lunch
and dinner and dyspepsia among them is
not so nearly universal; while in England
and on the Continent, where all live by
breakfasting, lunching and dining, dys
pepsia plaeues the people little. Are these
facts coincidences or correlated incidents?
Is it all in the names applied to our
National meals which gives us our National
disease, or do we eat our principal meal at
the wrong time of day? I have reference
to our great, home-living commonality
and not to those who live at clubs and
restaurants and so follow the English
fashion. Expert testimony on this point
is in order, but no Grahamite or vegetarian
need apply. I refuse to believe in that
gospel which teaches us that all good
things to eat are bad to eat and all dis
tasteful products wholesome.
What becomes of all the people when
times get hard? Did the reader ever notice
how quickly "to let" notices appear in the
windows of dwellings, storerooms and
downtown offices after a panic : has fallen
1 upon the country? What becomes of all
the people who formerly occupied those
dwellings, stores and offices? Are there
not just as many people in the world be
fore a financial crisis as after? The late
financial disaster was national * and even
international in its j scope, but so was the
phenomenal appearance of "to let"
notices. And when good times come
again how quickly all these vacant dwell
ings, stores and offices fill up and how
soon others are required to be built!
Where do all the people come from who
require them? Do they hibernate when
business is bad and come out of their holes
again only when business revives?
That happiness is a matter of relative
and not absolute condition I wish to prove
by introducing the testimony of ; a farmer
friend, who for several years j and with
varying success has been ranching down
in the San Joaquin. "If I can get a good
crop this year," he declared last fall after
sowing his grain, "I shall be able to pay
off the mortgage on my ranch, and when
that is once paid I shall be perfectly
happy." But the ' rains held off, the
weather became cold and the prospects
darkened. "If I can get even half a crop,"
declared my farmer friend, "l shall be able
to meet my interest, square up some scat
tering bills and put in another crop, and I
shall be happy." Dry weather set in, the
wheat dwindled and the. season ; waxed
late, but ray farmer friend still insisted, "If
I can get my seed and feed back I shall he
able to put in another crop next fall, my
J creditors will wait for their interest and
bills, "and I shall be happy." Then a
norther struck that part of the valley, and
blew his struggling crop all ; out of the
ground or covered it deep with sand, leav
ing my farmer friend with his labor for his
pains, but, meeting him, he said: "After
all it will not cost me so very much to put
in a crop next fall, for there being no crop
of stubble in the way. I can put it in with
Randall harrows, and so long as my good
old wife does not dry up and blow away or
the mortgage blow off the ranch, defraud
ing my creditors, I shall be happy." This
man is certainly not a calamity howler.
A stranger within our gates preached in
our church a little while ago and I went
to hear him. He was an eloquent man
and spoke with much earnestness, but he
murdered our good American tongue more
flagrantly than is the wont with an" aver
age Western Congressman, and I said to
myself: â¢ "If this man only possessed the
advantages which culture alone can confer
he would be a power in the pulpit," A
week or two later another stranger came
within our gates and preached in our
church. All that culture could do for a
man culture had done for him. His hair
was parted in the middle and his every at
tribute was in harmony therewith. His
grammar was faultless, his diction ex
cellent and his enunciation so perfect that
not a single syllable was slurred over, but
each sound was given its proper valuation
and that without apparent pedantry, his
manner was easy and his gestures appro
priate, but for the life of me I can scarcely
remember what the sermon was about,
though it might appropriately have been
something about "Art for Art's sake
rather than for the salvation of a human
soul." The perfection of manner absorbed
the attention almost to the exclusion of
the matter of the discourse. Surely there
is poor encouragement for preachers when
excess of culture is as destructive of re
sults as the want of it.
A group of tourists was recently viewing
admiringly a pretty winter home belong
ing to a noted Eastern manufacturer of
spool cotton when one of the group,
thrusting his thumbs into the armholes of
his vest, delivered himself as follows:
"The owner of this property is a talented
and cultured fraud, and he owes the pos
session of this beautiful cottage to a fraud
committed upon every seamstress and
housewife in the country. Each spool of
his thread is warranted to hold out 200
yards, but it does not. It lacks twenty
yards of it, and so he steals enough thread
from each ten spools to make an eleventh,
and the eleventh spool thus filched yields
a sufficient sum in the course of a year or
two to create this vision of beauty which
now excites our admiration and envy."
This explanation had a semblance of prob
ability, and we believed, ail but one, for
there was a doubling Thomas in the party
who had the curiosity to go a store, pur
chase a spool of this man's cotton thread
and measure with exactness. It overran
the 200 yards alleged on the end of the
spool by just thirty feet. The dapper lit
tle gentleman clad in spotless linen, gray
and aging, but alert and honest as one of
his own spools of cotton, had not obtained
bis fine property by the disreputable de
vice suggested. The incident furnishes
evidence to show that the opinion that
there is nothing in the world of business
but cunning and deceit is too commonly
received and unthinkingly entertained.

A DISCARDED CURIO.
On the corner of Gold and Montgomery
streets there is ah enormous # piece of petrified
wood . lying close to the curbstone. -At one
time it was considered a great curiosity, but
now the owners are unable to give it away.
It is about twenty-five years since the petri
faction arrived in San Francisco. It was sent
as a present to the Pioneers by Sam Brannan,
who obtained it from the calcedony forest near
Calistoga. It was with' great difficulty that it
was brought to this City, as it had to be hauled
for many miles over a country where there
were no roads. The work of getting it from
the forest was no small job, as men and toola
had to be sent there specially for the purpose.
I When the curio reached San Francisco it was
put on public exhibition and nearly everybody
| in town went to take a look at It. The officers

ot the Pioneers had a place bnilt for it in the
old hall where everybody was at liberty to see
it, and it remained there until the time of the
moving to the new quarters, about eight years
ago. By this time the piece of petrified wood
was no longer a curio, as travel to the forest
had been made easy and hundreds of speci
mens of the same kind were in the City: At
any rate the Pioneers did not think that it was
worth moving and left it behind them. The
new occupants of the building did not want it
in the way, and so had it carried out to the
sidewalk, where it has remained ever since.
The abandoned curio has exactly the appear
ance of a piece of wood, but it weighs over 300
pounds. It is of the calcedony formation. It
forms a blcck about three feet long and two
feet wide at one end, tapering almost to a point
at the other. : One end, where it was broken
from the large piece in the forest, has the ap
pearance of stone, but the other portions re
tain the most minute details of the original
material, each bit of fiber and every knot hole
showing perfectly.

The Bearâ J. R., City. The screw propeller
Bear, now in the revenue service of the United
States Government, was purchased in 1884
from Greive <_ Co. of Greenock for the purpose
of sending her north in search for A. W.
Greely, the Arctic explorer, and his party. It
was the Alert that was presented to the Gov
ernment to be one of the vessels on the expedi
tion. The Bear was built in Dundee, Scotland,
by A. SteDhen <_ Son for R. Steele in 1874.
Her length is 190 feet, breadth 29:9 feet and
depth 18:8 feet. Her tonnage is 714 tons.
She is now rated as a first-class ves
sel, carries four guns and was transferred from
the United States navy to the revenue service
in the latter part ot 1885 and reached this
coast in 1886. She carries eight officers and
forty men. When the Government decided to
send a relief expedition after Greely , the
Secretary of the Navy made arrangements for
the purchase of the Bear and the Thetis, both
vessels having been specially built â¢ for the
whaling business in the Arctic seas and con
structed to meet ice floes and run into ice. At
the same time the British Government offered
the Alert without conditions as a gift to the
United States, it being understood that
she was to be used as one of the ves
sels of the expedition. The Bear was
on the voyage from Greenock to St.
Johns, Newfoundland, when the offer to pur
chase her was made. She was the sister ship
of the Proteus that carried the Nares expedi
tion in search of the north pole. She was pur
chased for $100,000, was delivered in New
York February 11, 1884, and was at once taken
to the Brooklyn Navy-yard, where she was
strengthened. Captain Ash, who brought her
from St. Johns, was named her ice pilot. She
was the first of the vessels of the expedition to
leave. She tailed April 23 with Lieutenant
W. H. Emery as commander and wiih a crew of
thirty-four. She reached the spot near where
Greely and the other six survivors were dis
covered and rescued by the party that was on
board of her. After the return of the Bear the
was turned over by the Secretary of the Navy
to the Revenue Department and she has been
in that service ever since.
A FANCY SILK WAIST.
The Marie Antoinette fichu is one of the ac
cepted accessories in waist trimming. It is'
especially liked for theater and evening waists
and for house dresses. A perfectly plain dress
is made into quite an elaborate affair by the
addition of a soft, graceful fichu. Andsnch.a
plain waist should be owned by every woman
who likes variety, and especially those whose
income does not allow of the many extra
waists which are such a comfort. A simple
trimming of ribbon may be made adjustable
by taking one strip for the center front; this
is joined to the ribbon collar and the ribbon
belt, which are both finished with enormous
bows at the back; two other pieces of ribbon
four inches longer than the shoulder seam, are
sewed to the collar at the shoulder; the other
ends are laid in points, which extend over the
sleeves. This trimming, of ribbon may bo
made very elaborate by sewing bright spangles
on ail the edges. Or mark ends, with a spool
for a guide, down the center, and outline these
with spangles or beads.
- Another mode of trimming is to have re vera
and a sailor collar made removable. A black
satin or crepon waist may be made very useful
in this way. Have collar and revers of & fancy
silk in bright color., with an edging all
around of black chiffon. â  . .
The ribbon trimming may be of geranium
velvet ribbon with black spangles or of black
aatin ribbon with bright blue or green
spangles. *.
A fichu may be of the black crepon edged
with pleating, of yellow china silk or use a
bright china silk with ruffles of mousseline de
soie. â  - "

EARNEST ARTHUR GARDNER, I
I jM. A., formerly director of the Brit
ish School ot Archaeology at !
._k_=__ff Athens, has contributed to the
series of "Handbooks of Archaeol- i
>gy and Antiquity" a valuable work on J
"Greek Sculpture." He expresses the belief !
that, while there are several histories of |
3 reek sculpture, the need of a handbook on
a smaller scale and of a somewhat different j
icope has been widely felt, and he has j
endeavored to give a general outline of our j
Knowledge of Greek sculpture, distinguish- j
ing as clearly as possible the different
ichools and periods and giving typical in- j
itances to show the development of each.
He has not made any attempt at a com- |
plete or exhaustive treatment of the sub- j
iect, but has selected from the great
accumulation of available examples only i
mch as seemed most useful in illustration. I
The first. volume, which has just been re- I
;eived, contains the introduction and the !
History of Greek sculpture down to the ;
time of Phidias. The second part will j
emprise fifth and fourth century B. C. j
Hellenistic and Grseco-Roman sculpture j
md full indices to the whole work. The !
rest of the handbook will appear some '
time during the present year. The author
divides the history "of Greek art j
.nto six periods, each of which is
the subject of a chapter in his
took. There are three chapters in '
tach volume. The first considers the j
influences prevalent in Greece and the
neighboring countries during the period .
rhich immediately preceded the inde- !
pendent existence of Greek sculpture, and
the circumstances that surrounded its ori- !
rin are observed. The author also seeks i
'or the germs which contained in them- I
lelves the possibilities of so glorious a :
..growth. In the second chapter are seen
the earlier stages of development of Greek ,
iculpture itself, from the rude and un- I
couth images which seem little better than
the work of children or savages up. to
; those last struggles with the technique of
-. i difficult art that precedes a perfect mas- j
tery over the material. This period fitly ! ,
ends with the date of the battles of Sala- I
this and Platiea; as the Persian invasion j
and repulse not only supplied fitting [
â¢ themes for the artist, but actually left an ,
.pen field for the exercise of his art by de- i
Straying the work of his predecessors. J
The third chapter deals with the age of ]
highest attainment, when the sculptor, j
already competent to express his thoughts j
in bronze or marble, or in yet richer ma- ,
terials, is also inspired by the noblest
idealsâ the ace of Phidias and Polyclitus,
when the Greek conception of the highest
tods found most perfect embodiment, and
the form of man was rendered in its most
periect type. Thus concludes the volume
at hand. "The part yet to be published will
â¢how how a greater delicacy and more re
fined beauty, with a skill in rendering
carious passions and moods, mark the
period of Scopas and Praxiteles, while
academic study and care of execution dis
tinguish the school of Lysippus. 'Then
will come the Hellenistic age. which owes
its character to the conquests of Alex
ander, and which begins at his death, 323
B.C. The Roman age begins about
the time of the sack of Corinth and con
tinues to about the time of the foundation
of Constantinople (324 A. D.). The Byzan
tine age is beyond the scope of the work,
and so also is the monumental sculpture
and portraiture which is especially Roman
m character. By Groeco-Roman work is
meant that produced to meet the demands
:f the Roman market for Greek sculpture,
while the taste was in fashionâ or at least
produced under the influences to which
that demand had given rise. [New York:

TOETRY BY THE BUSHEL.
Carsner B. Jean writes to The Call that
tic is about to publish a volume of verse,
and he considerately forwards a number
of sample effusions dashed off at odd times
nnder various inspirations, as a sort of
forerunner to the book which he threatens
lo print. Carsner has been writing poetry
â¢ince before the war, and has great wads
of the stuff stowed away ready to be bun-
Sled to tne, publisher as soon as ever the
press shall have decorated him with the
bardic wreath. Here is one of the touch
ing stanzas from his "Harp of America":
Sweet harp of America In mourning awake thee,
".'.honored, unheard, thou hast slumbered too
long.
May never the bard of the future forsake thee,
But glvÂ» to thy glory one tribute of song.
Mr. Jean's general merits as a poet may
be very safely estimated from the loregoing
stanza. His" other verses, it may be ven
tured, are all equally soul-stirring and
beautiful. If Tom Moore could see that
stanza he would be overcome with sorrow
st the thought that ever he framed a
melody like the one that runs:
li'.-vr harp of my country ln darkness I found thee:
'J he cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee
long. . ;* *: '-
when proudly, my own island harp, I unbound
thee.
And gave all thy chords to light, freedom and
song.
No criticism could do justice to the poetic
work of Carsner B. Jean ; and there is no
law which could be invoked in the prem
ises, either.
ROBERT ATTERBURY.
Thomas H. Brainerd, author of "Go
Forth and Find," has written a new novel,
"Robert Atterbury," which deals with the '
problem of marriage. One of the lessons
which the story is intended to convey is
that, as a rule, marital infelicity results
from the fact that couples enter the mar
riage state without due or proper appro
ciation of the seriousness of the step they
are taking in a matter of lifelong import
anceâwithout that perfect understanding
: between the parties which should precede
the assumption of the marriage relation.
The hero of the story witnesses the de
plorable results of go many matrimonial
anions that when Cupid's arrow at length
finds lodgment in his breast he pauses for
a time with fear and trembling, undecided
I whether or not to risk the fate of two lives
on matrimonial uncertainty. For instance,
i lie runs across an old Harvard chum, who
was valedictorian of his class, and of whom
1 the president of the university had said:
i "The world will hear of himâ he will have
j a place among the coming men." This
! old chum looks world-weary and old. He
: startles Atterbury with this advice, "If you
[ wish to accomplish anything in the world,
don't marry! Don't marry unless you
I are so rich that you don't have to think
! of money, or so poor that the town takes
i care of you." Yet, among Atterbury's
| own family connections there appear two
â  prominent instances of marriage for
j money, and both are fraught with un
! happiness from the beginning, and end in
| separation, not unattended by pain and
: misery. Atterbury had acquaintance with
â  another couple who never quarreled, but
: always treated each other with the utmost
; formality. They had not learned how to
j love. Atterbury is a Boston inn, and a man
jof character and education. On a trip
\ through California he meets his ideal
I woman, Sarah Gardner, a Yassar graduate,
j living with an aunt at Santa Cruz. Sarah's
â  father is a wanderer on the face of the
earth. The father provides for her, and
I in his letters he advises her never to
marry, as the tendency of educated women
;is to remain single. Sarah, however, falls
rapturously in love with Atterbury. The
girl's father, however, thinking himself at
the point of death in Japan, writes a fare
well letter to Sarah, revealing a story that
drives her nearly crazy â the story of her
insane mother. Sarah's mind is made up
instantly. She sends the explanatory cor
| respondence to Atterbury and immediately
| departs for Japan. Meantime, Atterbury
;is taken ill in Boston, his life is
despaired of, he resolves to give up
Sarah, and sails to the South Sea
Islands. At Apia, he receives the letter
with Sarah's story. His health has im
proved, and, without delay, he embarks
for Japan, where Mr. Gardner is recover
ing, and where the devotion of two
hearts overcome a father's scruples against
his daughter's marriage. Father, daugh
ter and Atterbury return to America,
where success in the literary world awaits

I MARRIED A WIFE.
This is the rather happy title of a rather
happy novel by John Strange Winter, who
relates some of the matrimonial experi
ence of Derrick Lipscombe, "officer in
her Majesty's Black Horse." Derrick is
made to tell his own story in a manner
that is both fresn and rich with humor.
The present novel will not detract, by any
means, from the reputation of the author
of "Booties' Baby." Derrick meets his
charmer in the person of Miss Geraldine
Brodie, "one of the nicest girls in Lon
don." He lays siege to her heart. He
discovers that Geraldine is brimful of
charity for the poor and downtrodden, and
she becomes dearer still to him on that ac
count. He even smiles encouragingly on
the blessed work, and she is constantly
pestering people for money to aid the nu
merous "societies for the welfare of chil
dren" in which .he is interested. Slum
ming is Miss Geraldine's fid-fad. She
takes Derrick around to see various of her
patients in hovels of poverty, and
Derrick regards Geraldine as nothing
short of an angel withont wings.
Derrick's siege 'is successful. Miss
Geraldine is the" wife he marries. They
become identified with the official Society
of the Black Horse Regiment, and Ger
aldine resumes her fid-fads in the army.
Her kindness of hsart gets her into trouble!
Her maid has a beau in the regiment, and
she' tells Geraldine how inhumanly the
fellow is treated, how ill-fed and tyrannized
over generally. The man deserts and a
rumpus is threatened over the affair. The
maid prevails on Geraldine to visit her
home, where the officer's wife sees the
deserter and hears his story. At the
entreaty of her maid, Geraldine vows never
to reveal what she has seen or heard re
garding the escape. How* ver, she lets out
part of the story in an effort to excuse the
deserter's conduct to Derrick; but Der
rick's demand for more information is
met with refusal. She finds that her
promise has put the interests of a iraitor
against the interests of a husband. The
police will be certain to find out about the
visit of an officer's wife to the hiding-place
of a deserter. This, coupled with sworn
secrecy, would precipitate a scandal. To
, prevent any unpleasantness, Derrick
' quietly sends in his papers, and Geraldine,
1 having got safely out of a scrape, makes
a solemn promise to give up slumming
forever. The story closes with the inex
pressible haopiness that necessarily accom
panies the announcement of twins. [New

LIVES THAT CAME TO NAUGHT.
This is the title of a new book by Gar- (
rett Leigh, author of "The Burning Mist." '
The pain and deception that follow
an ill-advised marriage find treatment
in the story, and the title is well
borne out by the tale. Edith Loveret is in
clined, from her own experience, to the
view that the only real love to a woman is
of "the dog-in-the-manger type, when it
apes self-sacrifice it reveals its unreality."
Edgar Brownrig and Gerald Watson "are
close personal friends. It appears that
Edith, after her marriage to Edgar,
discovers that she had made a blunder in
the analysis of her own feelings, and she
has resolved thereafter to feign a love
where love had no place. Gerald was the
man to whom her heart went out in
reality; but he could not be hers, and,
rather than he should be to any other
woman. what he might have been to her,
she would tear the heart from her own
breast. Death comes to Brownrig, and
Edith is free once more. Gerald has
never married, and the widow receives
him with rapture when they met. But
the rapture is brief, for Gerald has only
come to say farewell. He discloses to
Edith the secret that Miss Wilberforce, the
woman who was believed to love Gerald,
and of whom Edith had been jealous, was,
in fact, in love with Brownrig, and that
Gerald had pretended to love Miss Wilber
force only to protect the good name
of Edith and himself. His ideal
of marriage, however, is too high
for him to use the death of
his dearest friend as a glad escape, and to
make falsehood a link to such a union as
Gerald and Edith. And so they kiss and
l partâ Gerald becoming a martyr to his
j ideal of right and honor, and Edith, in her
woe, acknowledging the justice of the pun
ishment. The Stoic philosophy of Brown
rig gives zest to the early chapters of the
book. The author is quite epigrammatic
at times. The illustrations are by Ida
Lovering. [New York: Macmillan ft Co.

A NEW CALIFORNIA BOOK.
On the 15th of this month an Eastern
publishing-nouse will bring out a volume
of short stories by Frank B. Millard, who
is one of the ablest newspaper men on the
coast, both as an editor and as a writer.
"In the Black Horse there was not an
officer more contented than Derrick
Lipscombc"
[From " 1 Married a Wife," a novel by John
Strange Winter.]
The title of the book will be "A Pretty
Bandit." Those who have read some
of the tales and sketches that Mr. Millard
published a few years ago expect a great
deal of the coming volume. They expect
to find in it keen dramatic interest and
literary excellence. The tales will be not
only interesting, but well told, and Cali
fornia will boast of another author who
will, if the signs fail not, take rank among
the producers of what the world calls
"good literature." The publishers are J.
Selwin Tait & Sons, 65 Fifth avenue, New
York. . .
WIT AND HUMOR.
"Bill Nye's Sparks" and "Nye's and
Riley's Wit and Humor" are the names of
two volumes just issued in Neely's Popular
Library. Each volume contains a biograph

(Bill Nye). "Sparks" is a collection of Nye's
characteristic stories, about thirty in num
ber, and every story is warranted to bring
out a number of healthy laughs. The
other is a series of : poems , and . yarns by
Nye and Riley, and contains some of the
best work of each of them. ; [New York:

CHARLES WARREN STODDARD.
Walter Lecky, a New York literary I
man, pays the following tribute, in a re
cent number of the Catholic News, to a
widely known and popular California au
thor and poet:
The news that the Catholic University will
confer on Charles Warren Stoddard an LL.D.
will afford pleasure to his admirers, and they
are all those who love an English style that
catches the shifting forms of sky, nature's
coloring and the words and melodies of men.
He is a type of that rare but noble class of j
authors who neither peddle their own I
wares nor found cliques to manufacture spu- I
rious fame. The coming century will have a
herculean work to perform in cleaning from
the shelves marked "Fame" the trash auda
ciously put there through the agency of syndi
cates, cliques, yellow books, chap books, and
other means too numerous to mention. Mr.
Stoddard has written one volume that will find
room on the cleaned shelves. I refer to that
book which Mr. Howells has declared Is one
"of old memories of delight, graceful shapes,
careless, beautiful, with a kind of undying
youth in them."
My first introduction, in one of the Isles
lying off Venice, to this book is one of the
memories that haunt my soul. Of it I have
written in "Down at Caxton's." I lav down
on the green sward under the beneficent shade
of a huge palm, wrapped in the odors of a
thousand flowers that sleepily nodded to the
music of tho creamy breakers on the rocky
shore. Books have their atmosphere as well as
men. Deprive them of it and many a charm is
lost. I drew the little volume from my pocket,
and there in that atmosphere akin to the one
ln which It was begot. I read of life in summer
seas, life that floats along serene and
â weet as a bell - note on a calm,
frosty night. Since, those days I have re
read' the volume in the lumber shanties
of the Adlrondacks with pleasure not a whit
abated. I have given the book to others, men
and women of the highest cultivation, and
their criticism was summed up in the word
"delicious." Robert Buchanan, a critic to be
reckoned with, has chided America for its
apathy to such a man of genius as Mr. Stod
dard. Rudyard Kipling declared that the
reading of "South Sea' Idyls'' made him
anxious to roam again. A book that can draw
from critics so diverse as Buchanan, Kipling
and Howells such whole-hearted sympathy
breathes in its pages what Hazlitt calls the
"silent air of immortality." Such a book has
no need of the minnow critics who bite at
everything that falls in their pool. When such
authoisas Mr. Stoddard go a- fishing they dis
dain such fry. ".\.:- -"':_;'.'*

You build a sonnet on about this plan
Your first line (-round out, take the next one â so!
And make It rhyme with this one, just below,
Then, next, you match the first line, if you can,
Don't hurry the machine. The lines must scan.
With steady motion turn the crunk. You know
'Tls not a sonnet if It limps. Oo slow.
Now find the rhyme for '-scan"â for instance, man,

LARGEST AND SMALLEST ROOKS.
Professor Max Muller of Oxford, in a re
cent lecture, has called attention to the
largest book in the world, the wonderful
"Kutho Daw." It consists of 729 parts in
the shape of white marble plates, covered
with inscriptions, each plate ; built over
with a temple of brick. It is found near
the old priest city of Mandalay, in Burmah,
and this temple city of more .than 700
pagodas virtually makes up this monster
book, the religious codex of the Buddhists.
In accordance with the three parts of
which â¢it is composed, generally called in
a figurative sense "baskets," the whole is
often termed "the three baskets," and con
stitutes a library larger than the Bible and
Koran together. As the Jews figured out
that the Old Testament contained 59,493
words and 2,728,100 letters, so the Bud
dhist priests have computed that the
"Tipitaka" contains 275,250 stanzas
and 8,808,000 syllables. This' monster
book- is. written in Pali, Rather
strange to say it is not an ancient produc
tion, but its preparation was prompted by
the Buddhistic piety of ; this century. It
was erected in 1857 ; by the * command of
Mindorain, the second of the last Kings
of Burmah. As the influence of the tropical
climate has â¢ already marred the inscrip
tions, a British official, Mr. Farrars, pro
poses to have these ;, 729 " plates carefully
photographed, and asks that the Govern
ment/or some friend of science able to do
so, make provisions for this. , Professor
Muller urges that this be done in order to
preserve at least the pictures of this unique
temple-city book.
: A noteworthy contrast to the Kutho
Daw is furnished, according to the Literary
Digest, by a recent German literary jour
nal v describing '-:â¢ what is probably the
smallest book in ; the world. < This is a
"Konversationslexicon," published in Ber
lin and prepared * by. Daniel Sanders. The
volume occupies the space "of only six
cubic centimeters (.366 cubic inch al
though it is claimed to contain : 175,000
words. The book must be read through a
microscope especially prepared for it.

MAGAZINES.
Godey's.
Godey's Magazine for April is a
"Bicycle Number." No less than a round
dozen of articles are devoted to the differ
ent aspects of the wheel. Its praises are
"sung in song and told in story"; in fact
this month's Godey's is an epitome of the
art and science of cycles and cycling.
Major-General Nelson A. Miles opens
the ball with some observations on the
use of the bicycle in warfare. He remarks:
"The French Government has found the
! bicycle so practicable and useful that it
I has adopted it as one of the appliances of
I war, and any Government or commander
â  utilizing this means of transportation and
putting a large, or small force upon the
cycle would compel an opponent to do
likewise, or else have him at great disad
vantage. In the Uniied States army at
the present time there are nearly 5000
i officers and soldiers who use the cycle,
j either in service or for recreation."
F. A. Egan, in "The Evolution of a
! Sport," relates the history and origin of
the cycle. It is learned from this that as
far baclr as 1868 j "velocipede receptions"
were nightly occurrences. It is recorded
at one of these receptions that, "among
the gentlemen who gave proof of their
skill was Charles A. Dana, who is an ex-
. pert rider." "1 -xC": f
Isaac B. Potter discusses "The Work of
Wheelmen for Better Roads,," taking oc
casion to compare American with French
roads, to the disadvantage of the former.
Mr. Potter thinks the cyclist of to-day is
in much the same position as Balaam's
ass, in so far as he protests against the con
dition of the king's highway.
"A Cycle Show â¢in Little." by Marma
duke Humphrey, is written to show some
of the curiosities and anomalies of the
cycling trade. This article is a very inter
esting one to the ordinary everyday world.
Bicycling for women is well discussed in
several articles, and the magazine is well
to the front with its usual departments,
"The Bookery," "Fashion, Fact and
Fancy," etc.
The Strand.
The Strand Magazine for the coming
mouth is full of good reading matter.
Principal among the articles in this issue
is one by James Walter Smith, who treats
of the American literary colony in Lon
don. Even as far back as the days of Ben
jamin Franklin London appealed to
the American writer as a good field for his
labor. The number of American journal
ists and playwrights is being constantly
augmented by young men and women,
who find in London fame a singularly
sweet and inviting prospect. v
Among literary Americans resident in
London are mentioned the following: B.
F. Stevens, Bret Harte, Henry James,
Mrs. F. Hodgson Burnett, Robert Barr,
W. L. Aldcn, Gertrude Atherton, M. D.
Conway, H. J. W. Dam and Poulteney
Bigelow. "Between the Acts" is a story
of the Franco-Prussian war translated
from the French of M. de Blowitz, the
well-known Paris litterateur and corre
spondent of the London Times. Charles
Knight has a lengthy article descriptive of
gymnastics in the British army. Mary
Spencer Warren shows the German Em
peror at home in her story entitled "The
Palaces of the German Emperor." "Some
Peculiar Entertainments" by Framley
Steelcroft illustrate to what a remarkable
extent the modern showman will Igo to
entrap the elusive shilling from the pub
lic. Several other stories and descriptive
articles, well illustrated, go to form a very
attractive number of the Strand.
The Pall Mall.
The Pall Mall Magazine is very prosy,
not to say insipid, this month. While it
is well illustrated and handsomely printed,
it appears to depend upon the prestige of its
aristocratic editors and makes no pretense
of publishing interesting, popular or di
gestible j reading matter. An exception
might be made in the case of Zangwill's
"Without Prejudice,'.' ..but even the Ghetto
word-painter tails to come up to the mark
this \ month. A dainty etching, "A Diffi
cult Question," is bound up with the
April Pall Mall.
LITERARY NOTES.
Professor Frederick Nicholas Crouch, the
aged author of "Kathleen Mavourneen,"
is suffering from an attack of heart trou
ble, aggravated by poverty and want, and
it is thought that his death is near at
band. His home is in Baltimore.
Bishop John F. Hurst of Washington/
while on a visit to Geneva, Switzerland,
in 1890, discovered ;an J bought a manu
script volume which proved to bo the auto
graph journal of Captain William Pote, of
that part of Falmouth, Me., now known
by the local name of Woodford's. The
journal was kept by Captain Pote during
his captivity in the French : and ' Indian
war, from May, 1745, to August, 1747. It
will be printed by Messrs. Dodd, Mead &
Co., in the exact language and spelling of
the original manuscript. ,'
the Rev. S. R. Crockett's new novel will
deal with life in Holland, and he has gone
to that country to get the local color. ;
. Macmillan & Co. have ;in : press an ex
ceedingly interesting work, ' which, under
the title "Brother and Sister," comprises
the ; letters . that passed - between Ernest
Renan and his sister Henriette during tbe
crucial period of Renan's life.
The April number of the magazine
"Romance" contains articles upon the
mysterious New Ray, and one upon Man
Flight, the latter giving interesting pho
tographs of Lilientbal as he appear, while
soaring through tbe air with his duplicate
set of wings. ; r-
Max Nordau has in the April number of
"Book Reviews" an article on Alfred
Austin, whom he declares to be the most
perfect incarnation of Anglo-Saxonism in
literature. '
Albert Tournier, librarian of the Ministry'
of Public Instruction in .France, has
written a book on Vadier, president of the
committee of public safety, arch-enemy of
Robespierre.
An extended history of the British navy,
under the editorship of W. Laird Clowes,
is announced by Sampson, Low & Co.
American writers .'will contribute to it.
The first volume will bring the record
down to Elizabeth.
Stephen Crane's first book, "Maggie, a
Girl of the Streets," was never refused by
a publisher, because it was never offered
to one, says the New York Critic. He
printed it himself, and had no thought at
any time of asking any one to publish it
for him.
The May Harper's will open with an
article on Mark Twain by his old friend
and neighbor, the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell.
It abounds in anecdote, and is embellished
with a frontispiece portrait, engraved by
Florian from the latest photograph of Mr.
Clemens, and with pictures of his Hartford
and Elmira homes by Childe Hassam.
The London Athenaeum has this to say
of the author of "The Raven": Ad
dicted as Poe was to mystery and to mys
tifying his audience, lor himself he at
tempted to demonstrate there was no
mystery. He, he would prove to us, had
ganged the universe and could assay its
value. Calmly and scientifically, if we
will only submit to the glamour of his
wizardry, he will explain the inexplicable.
Creation is a riddle which he can ex
pound. Death and eternity are but prob
lems he will solve for us but cryptograms
he can unriddle for our benefit. Only
resign ourselves to his guidance and,
though he lead us through the Valley of
the Shadow, it will be as a guide who
knows the route and with whom we can
not go astray.
Questions have always been raised as to
the discoveries made by Sebastian Cabot,
son of John Cabot. In Henry Harrison's
"John and Sebastian Cabot" the work
performed by each is distinctly traced.
The volume is described as "a chapter of
the maritime history of England under
the Tudors. 1497-1557."" .
According to Zangwill, the "new men of
'95" are Grant Allen and George dv Man
ner. "To wind up," he says, "it is not at
all improbable that the new man of '95
may have been altogether omitted from
this or any other catalogue, for without
friends on the press a new writer may in
the rush and crush of books escape the
notice of even the most impartial spec
tator."
It is announced that the first volume of
Victor Hugo's still unpublished corre
spondence will come out June 1. The let
ters will be (1) those written to his father at
Blois in 1820; (2) the poet's love-letters to
his fiancee and to his young wife; (3) the
epistles to Academy of Floral Games; (4)
the bulk of the correspondence referring to
"Hernani," "Marion* Delorme" and "Le
Rois'Amuse"; (5) a big bundle of letters
to Lacretelle and Victor Pavie, with fifty
;to Sainte-Beuve. The series, which reads
' like a novel, is edited by M. Theodore
; Michael's, who intends eventually to give
them the form of an English translation.
Macmillan & Co. announce that a ninth
volume will be added to the new edition of
Pepys' Diary, which they are now pub
lishing under the editorship of H. B.
Wheatley, containing various appendices,
additional illustrations and a copious in
dex. The seventh volume has just been
issued.
The next volume in the Century Science
Series will deal with the work of James
Clerk Maxwell.
England is not as bad off in material for
future poet laureates as one might think.
Mr. Zangwill writes: "We have a plethora
of poets able to give every satisfaction in
their work and ready to celebrate any
thing and everything with neatness and
dispatch."
According to reports the effect of bad
literature, the smut school, on juveniles in
France is shown by an increase of 16,000
criminals in thirty years. The criminol
ogist refers this increase to "bad books
and journals."
James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier
poet, is now editing a semi-religious
monthly journal known as the Orphan's
Bouquet. -,-.:.:..
Shortly before his death Alexandre Du
mas fils wrote a preface to "Miremonde,"
a short novel by M. Henry Rougon. The
book is to appear in April. It has been il
lustrated by M. G. Mendez.
An autobiographical paper, by Elizabeth
Stuart Phelp3, in McClure's for April, re
vives the tragic history of the burning of
Pemberton Mills â a casualty that fur- :
nished the basis of one of Miss Phelps' i
most effective stories; and also tells how, i
moved by the mourning that filled the
land at the close of the war, she wrote
that enoch-making book "The Gates Ajar."
William Morris, the English poet,
dramatist and socialist, nas a paper in the
April Forum on "The Present Outlook of
Socialism in England." In the same num
ber Brander Matthews, the critic, novel
ist and dramatist, has a delightfully enter
taining essay entitled "On Pleasing the
Taste of the Public."
FAIR WILL CASE.
Or. Mare Levin gston as Executor Is
Master of the Situation.
In the Fair will case Dr. Marc Lev
ingston's position remains unassailable.
He is the executor under what is known
as the Craven pencil will, and is therefore
master of the situation.
Rumors have been flying thick and fast
that he had been offered $300,000 to sur
render his advantage, but had demanded a
half million in cold coin to retire from the
field ; but these reports cannot be traced to
trustworthy sources.
Dr. Levingston, guided by the advice of
his lawyers, Messrs. Delmas & Shortridge,
is saying nothing, and the lawyers, exalt
ing the advice by example, say nothing
themselves. â â ' , . "
Samuel Shortridge. being asked yester
day if he could not cast some ray of light
on the subject, said: "I simply decline to
be interviewed at present. Later in the
day, after I have had a certain conference,
I may have a statement to make."
- Old and half-forgotten romances hinting
that Mrs. Craven might produce proof of
a certain contract marriage to Senator
Fair have been resurrected .to embellish
the recent news, but nothing has been ad
duced to indicate any weakness in Dr.
Levingston's position.
SHE WAS TIRED OF LIFE.
Mrs. Gluslflni Albera Takes a Fatal Dose
of Strychnine While Despondent.
Mrs. Giusifini Albera, aged 60 years and
a native of Italy, took a dose of strychnine
in her room, at 835 Pacific street, at 12:40

effects. She was despondent and tired of
life. Her husband ; had suffered reverses
in New York some years ago and she has
been brooding over the loss ever since.
Yesterday, morning her husband went out

THE season of penitence and ashes
being past, theatrical managers
are vying with one another in
attractions for Easter Monday.
The California will break out into
farce-comedy headed by Peter Dailey, and
of such is the variety show, coupled with
large receipts at the box-office. The Co
lumbia announces a Mark Twain-Frank
Mayo play, with the statement in paren
theses that both writers were good old-tim
ers in California, and that other old-timers
should rally to their standard. The Grand
has imported â  new leading lady from the
East for Easter, and she intends to im
prove the occasion by appearing in a pur
pose play, the object of which is to prove
that divorced people should not be pro
hibited from marrying again. The Tivoli
lias a home-made extravaganza, which it
defies any one to prove inferior to those
manufactured in the East, ami the Alcazar
gives the quietus to its continuous variety
show, and. returns to the path of comedy.
The Orpheum has added new vaudeville
stars to its bill, and last, but. not least, the
Baldwin says James O'Neill is quite good
enough Faster attraction for any one.
Â¥ Â¥ Â¥
It is with trembling anxiety that the
male portion of the population awaits the
new styles in Easter bonnets, and worse
still, Easter hats, which to-morrow will
give to the world. Will they be monu
mental, or trifles light as air? Is there
any hope that tbe male bipeds will be able
to get an occasional glimpse of the stage,
or will their sole business at the theater be
to "pay," and then sins into harmless ob
scurity behind a mass of spring millinery !
An ominous sign is that for some weeks
past the "women's pages" in the daily
press have given illustrations of new spring
bonnets, constructed on the principle of
a garden parterre, with nodding roses,
lilies and lilacs standing upright, in a brist
ling and defiant attitude. It is all very
well to say
Tlip flowers that bloom in the spring, tra! la:
Have i.i it li in. to do with the case.
They have a great deal to do with it
when the flowers bloom directly in front
of your line of vision at the theater, and it
is on that account that male admirers of
the drama are awaiting in fear and trem- i
bling the advent of the spring bonnet.
Baldwin Theater.
â¢ James O'Neill will close his first week at
the Baldwin Theater to-night with his
well-known interpretation of Dumas'
"Monte Cristo." To-morrow night the
actor commences the second and last week
of his stay with "Virginius." This piece
will be presented for the last time on
Friday night. "The Courier of Lyons," in
which O'Neill appeared so advantageously
last Wednesday night, will be given on
Tuesday and Sunday nights and at the
matinee on Saturday. "Monte Cristo"
will be seen for the last times on Wednes
day and Saturday nights. "Hamlet" will
be the bill on Thursday night.
On Monday night, the 13th inst.. Richard
Mansfield, accompanied by the New York
Garrick Theater Com pan y, 'will inaugurate
a three weeks' engagement at the Baldwin.
During that time he will bring out at least
two plays that are entirely new to this
City. He will also appear in a repertory
of productions which are identified with
his name. Mansfield's company includes:
Beatrice Cameron, Eleanor Carey, Jennie
Eustace, Johnstone Bennett, Norah Lami
son. Alice Leigh, Grace Gaylor, Charlotte
Walker, Harriette yon Ganahl, May La
vine, D. H. Harkins, E. D. Lyons. Orrin
Johnson. A. G. Andrews, W. N. Griffith
Louis Dutton, Herbert and Passmore.
California Theater.
At the California Theater to-morrow
night Peter F. Dailey commences a two
weeks' engagement in his latest laughing
success, "The Night Clerk." The comedy
drama is from the pen of John J. McNally,
who was responsiole for Dailey's former
plays, "A Straight Tip" and "A Country
Sport. Among the members of the com
pany are Jennie Yeamans, Miss Gertrude
Ford, Raymond Hitchcock, John Sparks,
Rita Emerson, Freda Depew, Bertio Dyar,
Ida Rock, Eva Butler. Hugh Mack, Charles' 1
?turgis. Lawrence Shcehan, If. J. Sulli
ran, William Keough, Peter Randall, Rene
Siretti and the Olympia Quartet.
"The Night Clerk" is said to be free
from all coarseness and to abound with
romedy and fun. It has received an ex
pensive setting and the way in which the
ast act is put on the stage is worthy of a
.hristmas pantomime.
Roland Reed follows Dailey at the Cali- i
'ornia Theater. He will be seen in "The I
Politician" and other plays.

delia.
The latest amateur whose dream of a
dramatic career seems about to be realized
jis Miss Portia Knight of Oakland. Fred
j crick Warde telegraphed to her last week to
j join his company in Tacoma and assume
| the role played in San Francisco by Miss
j Gillette, the leading lady, who has with
' drawn from the company.
In ' Miss Knight's sudden promotion
from the amateur stage of the San Fran
| cisco Lyceum of Expression, where she
has been studying under the guidance of
Mrs. Edna Snell Poulson, to the serious
business of impersonating â¢ Cordelia in
"King Lear," there is evidence that Mr.
Warde has great faith in her intellectual
and dramatic powers. Miss Knight's like

Her instructors believe she has a great fu
ture as a tragedienne.
THE CHEVALIER CRAZE.
New York Audiences Neglect the Thea
ters to Hear Coster Songs.
New York has simply gone wild over
Albert Chevalier, the London "coster"
singer, who is warbling at Koster & Bial's.
Since his arrival, the theaters have been
doing a poor business, for Chevalier has
monopolized the patronage.
He was fortunate from the time he ar
rived and was interviewed. Chevalier is a
diplomat, and he, struck an entirely new
subject as the theme of his remarks to the
reporters. "The difference between an
American and an English bar," Chevalier
is reported to have said, "is that in Eng
land they give you whisky, and allow you
to mix it with all the water you want,
while in; happy, free America, they give
you water, and allow you to mix it with
all the whisKy you want.'' "He has made
his appeal short, but direct, and he has got
there,'.' says the Journal. "His whisky dis
covery has knocked all the hackneyed 'I
love dear America' and 'I dote on the dear
Americans' sayings into cocked hats. It is
a stroke of genius. MaxO'Reil never said
anything five-eighths as bright; while Paul
Bourgetâ well. Paul Bourget never said
anything bright at ; all. Chevalier, in less
than a week, has discovered the ineffably
subtle charm of the whisky allusion. Yet,
he has : never seen; an American farce
comedy. He has never assisted at a seance
of American wit.: He has never listened
to the tinkling whisky and poker jests ut
tered behind the footlights. He is an in
spired genius and that is the long , and
the short of it. ...
"I should like to hear his impressions of
American audiences.- They must be singu
larly droll. What are his ideas about a
seething assemblage of people, who ap
plaud him lungily and handily before they
have ever heard him ? What ; has ;, he *to
say on the subject of a pre-cooked reputa
tion? "
"In the case of Chevalier, however, the
" - 'â â " ' .. . .
before was justified by the afterward. He
is an artist of the purest and most limpid'
water, and his character sketches would
convince an audience of savages. â  Such
songs might be vulgar and slummy, and
even smell-y. As he sings them, however,
they are gems, both of diction and melody-
Chevalier is the finest music-hall artist
that America has heard in the last decade'
i vette Guilbert is a stupid and incompre
hensible fad compared with Chevalier,
who gives us human nature as it is, not
only in the slums of London, but in tbe
alleys of the whole world."
Some of the New York papers, however,
express ineffable disgust at the Chevalier
craze. The Recorder says: ; -
" "What an unmitigated set of hypocrites,
or, worse still, of fools, must Chevalier
think us, and when he returns home,
what a laugh will go round the London
clubs at the expense of the American
public!
"Chevalier said America staggered him
â¢ the first day of his arrival. That audience
at Roster's must have staggered him on
the first night. .
"Now 'that he has regained his com
posure, he estimates its laudation at its
true worth.
_ "The same scenes have been gone
through each succeeding night in- the
week, until I haven't the slightest doubt
I hat Chevalier was thoroughly disgusted.
"On Friday night it seemed to me that I
could detect on his face a latent expression
of profound contempt for the insensate
mob pounding its hands together and
shouting itself hoarse over something it
didn't understand."
, The World goes with the multitude to
admire the "coster" singer, for it says:
"Chevalier is a music-hall artist. That
causes much drawing aside of fur coats
among our young 'dress-suit' brigade of
â¢ matinee favorites. But let them not for
get that Chevalier is an individuality. He
, is not one of a dozea or of a hundred, but
l one all by himself. He would have been a
great actor had he stayed in the theater,
but he preferred to step aside and create
' his own characters and win his own pecu
i liar and individual fame. The result is
i that there is no player in England to-day
. that can be compared with him as an art-
1 v. ' ** c never misses. He always produces
the effect he intends. And he is as great
, to the few as to the many."
, â  Chevalier is no stranger, by name at
â¢ least, in San Francisco, for his coster bal
lads are favorite ditties with local warblers
of comic songs.
James O'Neill's Hamlet.
BY WILLIAM GREER HARRISON.
No one of Shakespeare's creations per
mits of such varied interpretation as the
character of Hamlet. Its infinite com
plexities, its presentation of such varied
changes in the mental processes, admit of
many independent conceptions.
Shakespeare presents a man gifted with
great intellectual power, born out of his
time, at war with his environments, doubt
ing yet believing, desirous of advancing in
the lines suggested by his reason, yet halt
ing at every critical point in the face of an
opposition born of his own introspective
analytical conjuration. The great master
presents to us a vivid picture of an internal
conflictâ the battle of reason against a
faith founded on superstition the eternal
rebellion of the strong soul against the in
equalities of life, the arbitrary domination
of apparent trifles over the noblest of pur
poses.
The very complexities of Hamlet's na
ture produce and justify a varied inter
pretation. In reviewing, therefore, the
work of the individual Hamlet we must
first discover what the actor's own con
ception of the part is, and we must meas
ure his skill by the way in which he sus
tains that conception. â *-"**â¢-"
It is folly to compare one Hamlet with
another except where the second is merely
a replica of the first. We may prefer one
I actor's conception as better meeting our
own than that of another, but the com
parison stops there. There are so many
views of Hamlet that :T think it improba
ble that any single actor can present all of
them. ': We i have a right to expect from
each actor playing the role a consistent pre
, sentationâ that is,- he must play the â¢ part
after his own conception of the character
with a consistency that shall give to it a
harmonious color.
No actor will, however, be tolerated who
strains for an interpretation obviously not
intended. Only where the master is silent
or ambiguous is the actor permitted to de
â¢ part _ from the -plain reading of the lines.
Nor is he at liberty to conceive meanings
foreign to the text, or give expression to
ideas not natural' to or not legitimately
suggested by the context for the sake of
mere theatrical effects.
The language employed by Hamlet is so
delicate in its texture that even the light
est inflection or the least perceptible deflec
: tion changes the motive of the line and
may color a whole passage. ->'*
Ignoring this many actors have pre
ferred to follow some accepted standard
Hamlet and thus avoid the risk of criti
cism as applied to a newer conceptionâ
but the Hamlets which hold a permanent
place in our esteem have not feared to
clothe their own ideas with flesh and
blood and submit them frankly and fear
lessly.
Every presentation of Hamlet is more or
less influenced by the nature of the actor.
Even his physique has its influence not
only upon the audience, but upon the actor
himself. His views of life, his own an
swer to the everlasting iteration of the
question of existence and of a hereafter
; will color his conception of the character.
i The measure of his intellectual strength is
' the effect which he produces.
Mr. O'Neill's conception of Hamlet is his
i own and he is consistent and harmonious
, throughout. He gives quite a number of
, new readings, but these are legitimate
without being startling and there is not at
! any time a sacrifice ol the lines and their
obvious meaning for | the unworthy pur
i pose of creating a dramatic surprise. His
reading of the lines is musical and his
presence always gracious. He is entirely
l free from mannerisms and his delineation
; is in harmony with the lines. His soul
ascends or descends with a cadence natu
, ral to the situation. 1 say his soul ascends
because I do not mean his words, which
, would be a repetition of the statement
that his utterances are musical. What I
suggest is that Mr. O'Neill is able to give
to his utterances not merely a body but a
quickened, living soul, and this is why he
is enabled to hold his audience as by a
spell while they are with him, sending
them away with a feeling in their hearts
of having suffered loss by the abbreviation
of the performance.
Mr. O'Neill regards Hamlet as being
richly endowed intellectually and mor
ally, as the possessor of mental qualities
which would have made him great under
most circumstances, but looks upon him
as a genius born before his time, sub
jected to cruel misfortune, attacked
through his natural love, crushed finally
by an overwhelming combination of cir
cumstances. He does not portray the
long-haired bookworm which sometimes
does duty for Hamlet. He gives us a real
man, clothed with all that makes for
manhood, and he gives us a strong man
made weak by his own strength. He
shows us a Hamlet assuming madness,
but never mad â a philosopher always pre
senting the question of life and its coil,
but always unable to solve the mystery.
He shows us a man, a great man, suffer
ing, dejected, at times resolved, at times
in doubt, yet always with an unaccom
plished purpose,- a man in the hands ot a
relentless fate.
Mr. O'Neill is true to this conception ;
avoiding "artifice he gives us art, with a
finish and refinement, with an intenseness
and keenness of perception entitling him
to be ranked with the greater Hamlets
and with the effect of increasing our
pleasure in the fact that he has returned
permanently to the legitimate.

SINGERS, OLD AND YOUNG
Six Hundred - Voices Will Be
Lifted Up in the; Mormon
.. Choir.
A Famous Organization That Will
Be Heard Here Next V
Wednesday. ,
This week San Francisco will be visited
by a unique body of singers, the largest
church choir in the world.
One hundred and fifty picked singers of
the famous Mormon Tabernacle choir left
for the coast yesterday. They will give a
sacred concert at Sacramento this even
ing, a concert *at San Jose on Monday,
Oakland on Tuesday, and in the Metro
politan Temple of this . City on Wednes
day, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
They will leave for their return trip to
Zion on Saturday evening and arrive on
the following Monday, thus consuming
ten days on the trip. .. >j ;
This body in its entirety . comprises
nearly 600 singers. Nine-tenths of its
membership consist of young men and
women who have been reared, as it were,
in the present director's classes. The re
mainder are the fathers and mothers in
Israel who thirty years ago copied their
own music, and carried candles in their
coat pockets to their rude places of re
hearsal, and held the flaming dip in one
hand and their music in the other while
they sang. It requires no. little tact and
judgment to muffle such ' threadbare
voices by enveloping them in the mass of
rich young voices of their children, and in
some . cases children's children. Their
conductor succeeds in the task, however, if
the enthusiastic praise: of Paderewski and
Sousa go for aught. These famed lumin
aries of the musical firmament lifted up
their lights upon Utah's musical horizon
and shone resplendent. The fixed stars in
the Utonian sky did not pale in compari
son. Sousa is said to have declared that
Evan Stephens, the director, is the best
chorus conductor in the United States,
and Paderewski declared he had never
heard a finer chorus than that which is
heard in the egg-shaped tabernacle on
Sunday and in the massive neighboring
temple on occasions oi special solemnity.
There is much musical talent in Utah. !
It is rare indeed to find any one of the
dominant faith in the young State who
does not sing and there are some rare
voices among them.
More than one tuneful young Mormon
has gone into the outside world bearing a

trustees of the churcn in which she was
engaged had resolved upon retrenchment
in the choir expenses. Accordingly they no
tified her that her salary was to be reduced
$10<". She did not remonstrate, but on
the following Sabbath her solo was one of
unusual power and sweetness.' So thrilling
it was and so tender that it sank into the
hearts and even to the pockets of the
trustees, and the next day Miss Pratt re
ceived a polite note by which she was in
formed that, instead of a reduction of her
salary, it would be increased at the rate it
had been prooosed to decrease it.

Evan Stephens is sometimes referred to
by the older saints as "Our Shepherd
Boy." 'Some one with musical- discern
ment and a kind heart "discovered" him
when he was an ungainly boy living in
one of the humble settlements. He soon
attracted attention at the Boston Conser
vatory by his genius, and in his six years'
leadership bas transformed the choir.
Willard Weihe, the violin virtuoso who ac
companies the choir, was a protege of Ole
Bull. The great Norwegian violinist, took
the dreamy, fair-haired little fellow on
his knee and gave him his first lesson in
the use of the bow.
Several daughters of Brigham Young
are among the singers who will come to
the coast. Indeed every member of the
organization represents some phase of the
religious romance whose pages have been
scanned with keen interest' by a curious
world.
The choir is strong in oratorio, but its
repertoire includes compositions by the
leader and other Utonian composers. The
favorite, "Hosanna!" anthem by Evan
Stephens is used in the dedication of all
the Mormon temples and its choruses
are most impressive. "O Mv Father" is
a beautiful hymn written by Mrs. Eliza R.
Snow, an inter-mountain poetess, sung in
almost every Mormon assemblage.
This is the second pilgrimage of the
choir, the first being to t c World's Fair,
where it won a prize. It carried off the
first prize at the Eisteddfod held at Salt
Lake City in October.
The Mormon singers will travel in a
special train.

ON MARE ISLAND.
THE prettiest lighthouse in Cali- i
fornia is the one on the southern
end of Mare Island. Nature has
done her best in the way of beau
tiful surroundings, and the build
ings put up by the engineers are harmoni
ous in outline. The two women who have
been the keepers of it have so improved
the work of the builders that the place
looks like the suburban home ot some
prosperous business man. The exact loca
tion of the lighthouse is at the meeting of
the waters of San Pablo Bay, Carquinez
6traits and Napa Creek. The lighthouse is
on a hillside that faces the south, getting
all the sunshine possible and being well
sheltered from wind and fog.
There was an urgent demand for a
lighthouse on the southern . portion of
MISS McDOUGAL AND ONE : OF THE GUARDIANS OF TUE LIGUTHOLSJ
Mare Island as far back as 1855, but the
Government did not put one there until
1874. Previous to that time the fleet of
ships and river steamers had to get along
the best way they could, and from all ac
counts the navigators did remarkably
well without it, as there have been very
few accidents in the vicinity.
When the light was first t>ut up it was at
the suggestion of the Navy Department, and
its location has been so wisely chosen
that it can be seen by all craft going up Or
down the Sacramento or San Joaquin
rivers, and also by vessels entering or leav
ing the navy-yard.
To reach the Mare Island Lighthouse it
House and Weight-Derrick for Fog-Bell
B Machine.
[From a sketch.] â 
is necessary to first go to the navy-yard
and from there travel over the hills along
the shore for a distance of two and a half
miles. It is a pretty road that. leads up
through the shipyards, past the big foun
dries and along under the trees to the offi
cers' houses. A" little further and the
hospital is passed, and the road goes out
into the open country. Up hill and down,
past the powder ma.azine and then a
steep climb almost to the highest point on
the island. Down the bill on the other
side and a sharp turn brings the light
house into view. '*.*.:._
At a first glance nobody would take it
MARE ISLAND LIGHTHOUSE.
[Sketched f a a the wharf.]
for a lighthouse. Flowers bloom on all
sides and vines climb over the roofs of the
different buildings. Oak trees, beneath
which there is a soft growth of velvety,
grass, cover the hills in the vicinity and
form a background for the pure white
buildings, bringing them out in strong
and pleasing contrast. Everything about
the place is as orderly as possible and
most suggestive of comfort and rest.
The interior of the keeper's residence is
all that taste and refinement can make it.
A dainty parlor filled with all sori,s of
pretty bric-a-brac occupies a _ corner of the
house where the sun pours in and fills it
with a gentle warmth. The decorations
are bright and pleasing and numerous
pictures adorn the walls.
The light tower is built into the resi
dence and really forms a part of it. A
stairway leads up from the lower hall to
the second floor, where there are a number
of cozy sleeping - rooms. The tower is
entered on this floor and another stairway
leads to the lamp-room above, where ail
extra material is kept and the cleaning
and trimming done. The lantern is di
rectly above this room and is reached by a
spiral stairway.
The Mare Island light is of the fourth
order.- The lenses are of the usual pattern
and.were made by Sautter & Co. of Paris,
France. . They are evidently very much
older than the tower in whicn they are
placed, but unfortunately there is no date
on them nor any record to show where
they, were used before. Portions of the
internal mechanism have been changed,
evidently to adapt the lamp to burn min
eral instead of lard oil, which was once in
general use. Tbe lamp used is of the
Haines pattern and will develop fifty-eight
candle power," which is increased by the
lenses to 598. The light is over seventy
five fret above high tide and ct>n be seen
twenty-five miles. It does not cover the
whole horizon, but a portion is "cut out"
by means of refracting glasses that turn
the rays of light toward the sea instead of
allowing them to be wasted against the hill
side behind the tower.
FFogs are not frequent in the vicinity of
Mare Island, but provision has to be made
for them when they do come. The fogbell
machine is located about thirty feet below
the lighthouse and on a wharf built for
the purpose. The machine is a new one
of the latest pattern, and is operated by a
500-pound weight that is suspended from
a rope that passes over a drum on which
it can be wound. As the bell is near the
water the weight would not have room to
drop so as to run the machine for any
length of time, and to obviate this a der
rick is constructed outside the house over
which the rope passes. The bell has a soft
and pleasing tone, but cannot be heard
very far. | It was made in Philadelphia in
1855, but there is no record to show wh<re
it was used before being placed in its pres
ent position. ". . â  t â 
Mare Island Lighthouse has never had a
man for a keeper. When- the light was
first built it was in charge of Mrs.' Watson,
widow of Commandant Watson. She held
the position for eight years, and on her
retirement it was put in charge of Mrs.
McDougaJ, widow of the late. Captain Me-
Dougal, who still holds it. She has seen
fourteen years ,in "the service and thor
oughly likes t .c work.
Mrs.McDougal is given no assistant by the
department, 1 but does all the work herself.
She always lights 1 the lamp at sundown
and' changes it at midnight. The lamp
really requires no attention, but it is nee
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 5, 1896:
essary for her to stay awake and be on the
lookout for fogs. But they seldom come
up during the summer, and during the
winter are of short duration. To start the
fogbell is really the only unpleasant part
of , the work, . as* it is necessary to go out
side, and in the darkness pass down the
wet and slippery stairs to the wharf. To
start the bell it is only necessary to touch
a small '. lever and it will keep tolling for
three hours without being wound up. In
addition to her duties as lightkeeper, Mrs.
McDougal has done all her own ', house
work and raised a family of four daughters.
The one objection to Mare Island Light
house as a place of residence is a serious
one. For some mysterious reason the
crevices between the rocks along the shore
are filled with rattlesnakes, and constant
care must be exercised to avoid treading
on them. During the last ; fifteen years
over sixty have been killed, many of them
being over four feet in length. Nobody
about the lighthouse has ever been bitten
by one of them, possibly for the reason
that they are so careful not to disturb
them. W9V_)9ffiÃ--183l
TWO RACING BUILDERS.
Fleet-Footed J. W. Lucas Beats
Charles Dunlop Around a
Block.
A Fast Greyhound Who Was Pacing
Dunlop Fhw the Track to Chase
a Cat.
Yesterday the great footrace between
J. W. Lucas and Charles Dunlop, the two
fleet travelers.; of the Builders' Exchange,
came off, with the former athlete the win
ner. The contest was for $50 a side and
the Exchange medal, and the course was
around the block bounded by Tenth and
Eleventh avenues and California and Lake
streets. '*...'
Lucas is a lightweight runner, tipping
the scale in his racing harness at 253
pounds, while Dunlop carries about 100
pounds less avoirdupois. The distance
around the course was 577 yards, and Dun
lop had agreed to cover this twice while
Lucas went around once.
The locality was chosen by Referee J. A.
Wilson because there were no buildings on
the block, and consequently the racers
would be in full view of the spectators all
the time. This would prevent stealing
across lots, as it was confidently expected
that one, if not both, of the contestants
would try to do.
For three weeks the , flyers have been
practicing with John Adams. Walter
Lucas, Harry Williamson and A. J. Dono
van all (200 pounders) as pace-makers.
Dunlop, however, sneaked in a greyhound
with which he practiced in the absence of
Lucas and his friends. It was reported

Points to Consider.
. .When you buy an Electric . Belt you want the best made,
and it is well to understand, first, that the value of an Electric
Belt is in the strength of electricity it gives into * your body.
This depends on the battery used. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is
made strongly, almost indestructible, and it is. POSITIVELY
GUARANTEED to generate a current of Electricity that you
can feel every time you charge it for one v year. > With care it
lasts five years. It has eighteen powerful elements, is perfectly
insulated and possesses what no other Electric : Belt made has, a
regulator, so that you can regulate it while it is oil the body. .
Consider how slight is the cost of on.- of these wonderful
Belts ; consider the fact that it cures you while you rest at night ';*
does not interfere in any way with your daily duties ; that it has
a regulator which makes it mild or strong : while it is on your
body then be true to yourself ; get it get it to-day.

that the fat man was being paced by a
steam pavement roller, but the story was
was not verified. ; - ..-.
At 10 o'clock yesterday morning the
Exchange took a holiday, and all went to
the race. The two ' men c. were already
there, having been on the ground since 8
o'clock. They were so anxious to get away
that their trainers could hardly hold them
back. Only by herding them in a barb
wire lot adjoining the course could they
be controlled. Â....,â 
At 11 :20 o'clock, the gang having arrived,
the signal to "go" was given by Referee
Wilson slapping a piece of rustic board
down on the sidewalk. It was the hare
and tortoise race over again. .â  Charley
Dunlop darted away with the speed of
light, bis greyhound pacemaker.' thinking
it was all a joke, biting playfully at his
flying heels. Lucas pulled out in good
style, beating the ground ; so heavily, with
his feet that the artificial-stone pavement
upon which he ran was cracked every
jump.
â¢ . By the time Dunlop was at the finish of
his first lap he was pretty well blown and
was down to a walk, with the greyhound
across the street chasing a cat that had
ventured out to see the fun. Lucas was
also down to a slow pace, and the rest of
the race was a walk lor both men. Before
Dunlop could make his second round his
253-pound opponent had, like the tortoise,
walked in and won the money and medal.
The lo.er and his friends were satisfied,
but say that the wide cracks in the pave
ment, made Iby Lucas' "little footsteps,
soft and gentle, bothered Dunlop in his
second turn around the course. The
friends of Mr. Lucas say that Adams, their
champion's pace-maker, put up a job with
the greyhound to get Dunlop in first, and
that the scheme only failed because the
dog left the course to interview the cat. â¢
The great interest taken in this speed
contest has encouraged the sporting mem
bers of the Builders' Exchange to get up a
fat-man race in the near future. â¢

APRIL, the fourth month of the
year, is our guest.
Daisies crown her brow and
the flash of many diamonds daz
zles our eyes as she waves her
hands in merry greeting, while above and
all about her hover and crowd her fairy fol
lowers, a vast army of dancing, prancing
sunbeams, and gently rapping, tapping
raindrops.
April, a tickle maid Is she,
But one we're very glad to see.
On account of the changeableness of the
weather during this . month April has
been treated in song and story as the type
of inconstancy.
The name April is from the word Aper
ilis, meaning the opening, or the time
when the earth opens its mouth, as this
season is the birtbtime of the plants and
flowers and living things of spring.
Hark to the bells as they chime out peals
of joy from every church tower in the land :
'Tis Easter day, they sweetly say,
O'er valley, hill and mead. _ ./ , - -
'Tis Easter day, they sweetly say,
, For Christ has risen indeed.
How beautiful is Easter! Fair, goddess
of the spring, decked with lilies pure, her
face aglow with hope and promise, she fills
our soul with love and gladness.
The brilliant diamond and the modest
daisy (days-eye), both emblematical of
innocence, are the stone and flower chosen
by fickle Miss April with which to enhance
her charms.
The diamond is a very interesting stone,
and I wish you would find out at least one
thing about it for yourselves and let me
k.iow what it is.
Faster Lilies.
Long ago, as Easter emblems.
Bloomed the lilies, tall and white,
Pure and stateliest of flowers,
Gleaming with celestial light.
Wan, as If with prayer and fasting,
i'ale with watching by the dead.
Near a garden tomb they lingered,
Low before it bowed the head.
For the angels' silent lingers,
As they softly waited there.
Touched the sweet, the mystic lllle*
Lovingly, with tender care.
While the world m solemn stillness
Watched the coining of the day
Of tnat first, that ancient taster,
When the stone was rolled away.
And when morning dawned resplendent^
And on earth its glory shed.
Pealed the lily-bells in triumph,
"Christ is risen from the dead!"

and her light steps fell in the chamber of
death like a sweet dream 'or the delicate
fragrance of the lotus flower. One day she
wandered farther from her father's people
than ever before through field after field
of waving mustard. Suddenly her heart
leapt with joy for growing at her feet was
a flower like a golden cup. Hastily draw
ing her jeweled dagger she knelt and care
fully dug the pretty flower from the
ground, when lo ! at each fiber of the root
was a tiny pebble of gold. In an ecstacy
of delight she clasped it to her bosom,
and with her own rosy lips kissed its dewy
petals breaming her pure lovely spirit
into the flower and drinking from its
balmy odor. the consolation of sleep. Thus
dwells the ; spirit of the Indian maiden

Mishap on a Corner!!*. ,
There is an old story about a boy who
was hoeing corn one hot day in his father's
field. He didn't feel like hoeing, and so
he burrowed his bare brown " toes in the
warm soil and watched for stray toads. He
had already killed four or five, and it was
much more fun than hoeing corn. Sud
denly he saw an unusually large one wrig
gling almost at his feet. He struck it a
hard blow with the hoe, and the .next in
stant he was curled up on" the ground,
howling with pain. He had mistaken his
big toe for a load and cut it almost off.
The story was called to mind by the
accident that happened not long ago to a
little girl who lives in Southern Illinois.
She was playing around her father's corn
crib one afternoon, when she conceived
the idea of climbing to the top and seeing
what the crib roof was like. So up she
went, using the logs in the crib roof as
ladder rounds. When she was almost up
she found difficulty in getting over the
eaves, so she thrust her arm between two
of the logs, clasping it as far around as
possible. Then she raised her head.
Within tyro inches of her nose she saw
several snakelike objects crawling toward
her from between the logs. With a shriek
she let go, and down she fell to the ground,
bumping her head and spraining her wrist.
And the snakelike creatures she had seen â
she was very much afraid of snakesâ were
only her own little black fingers reaching
around the crib log.â Chicago Record.
A Boy and a Millionaire.
One day not long ago a boy who has
worked for four years in Marshall Field's
store asked for a raise in salary. He was
getting $4 a week and he thought he
ought to have more. So he asked his su
perintendent and the superintendent re
ferred him to the manager and the mana
ger leaned back in his chair and said:
"You must see Mr. Field himself. He
regulates all raises in salary."
After a week of disappointments the boy
succeeded in gaining admittance to Mr.
Field's office. With shaky voice he asked
for a raise in salary.
"How long have you worked here?"
asked the millionaire.
"Four years."
"And how much are you getting?" â 
"Four dollars a week."
"How old are you
â¢"Fifteen years old."
"Why," returned Mr. Field, "when I
was your age I was working for $2 50 a
week and I thought I was well paid. What
do you think of that?"
"Perhaps you weren't as valuable a boy
as I am," was the respectful reply.
It isn't chronicled what was next said,
but the boy got his Chicago Record.

The Ffocks of Spring.
When winter is done and April's dawning
Shatters the dar_ of the year.
And the rain-fed rivulet under the bridge
Again runs clear,
And the shepherd sun comes over the hill
To let out the flocks of spring,
With laughter and light in the pastures of air
The flocks take wing.
They scatter every lingering wind,
The perfume and the bee,
And the whispers of the jostling grass-
Glad to be free.
The minstrelsy of the shining pools,
The dancing troops of the hours.
And over the sod In a sudden rapture
Flame the flowers.

the old folks indulge in foolish jokes and

The observance of this day is a very old

to tell you about it I found that not alone
is it observed in England and America,

. A Cat's Own. Story.
I was born on the 18th day of February,
1896, at the bellhouse on Angel Island,
and until a week ago had never heard any
thing but the tolling of the bell and the
sound of the waves as they dashed on the
rocks, but within the past week 1 have
seen more than most cats of my age.
I shall try to relate the story of my ad
ventures so that it will give pleasure to
my childish readers.
On last Thursday afternoon I was awak
ened from my afternoon nap by a young
man dressed in blue, who took me up care
fully and placed me in a basket and car
ried me ever so far away from the big bell,
that I had grown so used to, to a large
house, where there were lots of other
young men dressed the same as he was.
Here I was given a saucer of warm milk
and put to bed for the night.
The next morning the same young man
took me from the basket and gave me
more milk. After I had drnnk the milk I
was put into a box with a lot of holes in it
and taken down to a little boat and put
aboard, and thus my journey began.
A few moments later the boat began to
move and 1 commenced to cry, but 1 soon
THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ADMIRED THE KITTEN.
found out that my crying was of no use, as
the boat kept on moving.
After a long time the boat stopped, and
I was carried to another boat that was a
freat deal larger than the first one. Here
cried as hard as I could from fright, as
I saw animals that had the same number
of feet as I had, but did not, look like me
at all.
By and. by I was carried to what I after
ward found out were cars and placed on
the floor under a seat. A few moments
after two young ladies dressed in black
with white bonnets sat down on the seat.
This frightened me so that I began to cry,
when one of the ladies said, "My gracious,
sister, there must be a cat under the car; I
hope that the poor thing will not get hurt."
I rode a long time, 1 and \ when ' the car
stopped the young man took me up and
carried me a short way until he came to a
large house, where he was very warmly
erected by a young lady, who said, "Oh,
Will, you have brought my cat."
: I was taken into the house and Jet out of
my box. The moment I got out I looked
around and saw a fine -.. room with two
young people in it; one was the young
man who brought me and the other was a
very pretty young lady, who took me into
another room and gave me , some â  milk.
After I had drunk the milk I was allowed to
play in the room where the two young peo
ple were. I could not understand, much of
what they were talking of. but I heard the
young man say: "Lulu, I think that you
had better call the L cat, 'Fred' after me.
But this did not seem to suit her and she
said that I was to ;be called "Malty," so
here I am started out in the second stage
of my life with the name of Malty.
If this pleases my young readers I shall
from; time to time let them know how I
am getting along. For the present I shall
say good- by. . .... . Malty..

Oakland, Cal., March 27, 1896.
Dear Editor: I will write a letter on the
poppy, the State flower of California. A poppy
has a little cap called calyx, which is cadu
cous. This means when the poppy begins to
open the calyx falls oft
When the calyx falls off some yellow leaves
appear. These yellow leaves are called petals.
The petals form the corolla of the poppy.
Corolla means crown. --'I ' V:
In the middle of the poppy are little things
called stamens. On top of each stamen Is a
'little case, which holds powder, called pollen.
The little case that holds the pollen is called
the an then. Â -.;., . â\
There are twenty-five stamens; in the middle
of the stamens are the pistils. . If you pull off
the petals and stamens, and leave nothing but
the stem something funny will happen. ; .
Break the stem at the top and open it and
you will find a little cradle called the ovary.
Break the ovary and . you will find some
poppy seeds in it. So the plants that will be
here next year are in their cradle fast asleep.
And a nice long sleep they will have I am
sure. When they wake up .they will not be
seeds, but little poppy plants.
Please print this in the Sunday paper. Your
little reader, â  . . ' -

Dear Editor: As you expressed a wish in
Sunday's Call for the boys and girls to write

flower, the California poppy, l thought I would
write you as much as I know about it.
The poppy's favorite place of growth is Cali
fornia. :It flourishes best in ; the sum There
are single and double poppies. . A poppy is
about the size of an ordinary-sized rose. â¢:. The
double poppy is shaped like a pink, and varies
very little in color from the single one.
The poppy has four petals, which are shaped
like the petals of a rose, but are " much larger
and . thinner. There are different colors of
poppies, namely, white, 'pink; crimson, etc.':
The double : poppy . does , not bear '- seed, * but
grows from the seeds of the single one. -.;. .
When it is going to seed the petals drop off,
leaving a bulb containing the seeds. The bulb
is round, "similar to a scent-bag that is tied
with a ribbon. ' Opium is obtained from the
inspissated juice of the poppy. Your little

speck of black at the base. On the top
of the stamens are the anthers that hold the
pollen and the threadlike supports are called
the filaments. When the flower was in the
bud there was a tiny cap on it, the shape of a
cone, but as the bud grew larger and tho cap.

California think ours a very happy choice for
the State flower. I do not quite understand
about this selection. Perhaps Mr. Editor can

teeth, is not that funny? My little brother
likes me better than my sister, she only makes
him cry. My brother talks a funny language
than I do. He thinks I could understand him.
What do you think of the cheek of my little
brother to slap us. at his age, he thinks that
we have to mind him. Whenever I come home
from school he holds out both his little hands
for me to take him, when I come home for
my lunch he cries to come to me.

PIGEONS TOE THE NAVY.
Construction of Lofts Along the Coast
Will Be Begun at Once.
For several years past a number of of
ficers in the navy have been interesting
themselves in the training of homing pig
eons over the water, and from time to time
have made efforts at the Navy Department
to have an appropriation made for the es
tablishment of this service on a large scale
along the coasts of the United States; but
I not until last week have the various recom-
m endations which have been made by su
perintendents of the Naval Academy and
other officers been favorably considered.
Secretary Herbert, at last, convinced by
the practical results which have been ob
tained during the last few years with the
pigeons from the Government cote at An
napolis, that "the carrier pigeon as a mes
senger between ship and snore would be
a valuable addition for strategic purposes
in time of war, has approved the idea, and
has ordered a detailed plan to be prepared
by the officers interested.
This plan will be finished within two
weeks, when the work of building the
cotes, after the pattern of the loft already
established in the tower of the boathouse
at the Naval Academy, will be begun, and
they will be placed at first at seven or
eight of the important strategic points and
navy-yards along the Atlantic Coast. When
these lofts have been established the sys
tem will be gradually extended until there
wiil be a complete chain of stations along
the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The stations
proposed for the main lofts are at Ports
mouth, N. H. ; Boston, Newport; New Lon
don, Conn.; Brooklyn, Philadelphia,
ington; Annapolis, Md.; Norfolk, Va. ; Port
Royal, S. C.and Key West and Pensacola,
Fla. Secondary stations are proposed to
be established at Portland, Me. ; Cape Hat
teras or* Wilmington; St. Augustine, |Fla. {

SCIENCE,LITERATURE
AND
ART.
COLONEL W. H. BELL, at present I
Commissary officer for the Depart
ment of California. TJ. S. A., is the
inventor of a new intrenching tool
or shovel that will very likely soon
be introduced into all branches of the ser
vice. The new tool is simplicity itself
and seems to fill all the requirements of
such an instrument.
It is several years since Colonel Bell
started to work on his invention, and he
had the full benefit of nearly four decades
of active service to tell him what was re
quited in the tool. As it is completed it is
difficult to see how it could be improved
upon. The tool could of course be made
in any size, but the one that is finished is
the same size as the regulation army can
teen â seven inches across at the widest

place. The general shape of the blade of
the tool is that of a shallow bowl, with
portions knocked off on two sides of a sec
tion that comes to a point. Two handles
are placed on either side of it and it is
ready for use.
It is the details of the tool, however,
that make it so valuable. The bowl shape
permits it to be placed over a canteen
where it is held in place by a chain that
stretches from side to side. A ring slips
over the neck of the canteen to avoid jar
ring, and the position of the handles is such
that they will not get in the way when a
man wants to drink. The total weight of
the tool is only nine ounces, and thespace
it occupies is practically nothing.
It is the intention to make the tool of
steel, but in order to keep the weight low
the bowl must be very thin. This would
of course be quite weak and liable to
break when put to heavy work. To over
come this Colonel Bell basso constructed
the frame of the tool that it bears all of
the strain and pressure, and the bowl sim
ply acts as a receptacle for the loosened
earth or rock.
About a year ago the War Department
had a test made" of several kinds of in
trenching tools at Fort Snelling, Minn.
They were put to the most severe trials
and Colonel Bell has just received the of
ficial report. His tool is given the prefer
ence over all others. It stood the most
H intrenching Tool Attached to Canteen.
[From a photograph.]
severe strains and handled more soft earth
than any of the others. One tool was sub
mitted "by Captain Zalinsky that stood
most of the tests, but failed when it came
to digging in frozen gravel. Colonel Bell's
tool not only accomplished this, but also
took several large stones out of the sub
stance and at the end of the trial was not
bent in the least. The report says: "The
tool went back on the canteen perfect,
and only a few scratches on the sharp
point showed that it had been put to any
use."
Not only is the intrenching tool likely
to be put to use in the regular army, but
the New York militia has made tests and
resolved to adopt it as soon as the State
makes the necessary appropriations. It
lias been ascertained that the tool can be
made in larga quantities for a little over
30 cents a piece. If sold at a moderate
price there is no reason why campers
should not use it, as every one knows

After 84,000,000 Sunken Gold.
The Amsterdam Gazette mentions that
a company has been organized for the
raising of a treasure sunk with the ship
Lutine, which was lost almost 100 years
ago off the Dutch coast. This boat sailed
from London in 1799 for Hamburg, there
being on board a very large sum in gold,
which was intended for payments of Con
tinental accounts by English merchants.
It is believed that there was $1,000,000 in
cold in iron coffers aboard the Lutine.
The vessel was sighted off the Dutch
coast, and that was the last ever seen of
her, and she was never heard of again.
Several attempts have been made to find
the wreck in the last ninety years, but all
efforts were fruitless until recently. It
seems that the hulk of the old vessel has
been located, and a company organized
to raise the prize has gone to work. At
last reports four guns had been raised,
but so lar no coins have been discovered.
The work of salvage is carried on by ex
perienced divers, who have succeeded in
clearing the hulk from sand by means of
great pumps. The wreck is located not
very far from the island of Vlieland, on the
Dutch coast.
An Electric Cane.
John Jacob Astor, the multi-million
aire, is an amateur electrician and de
signed the fixtures for the illumina
tion of his new palace on Fifth avenue.
Incidentally, says the New York World,
he has invented an electric cane, for
which, in years to come, many people
will call him blessed. A storage bat
tery is confined in the heart of a black
thorn stick. In the end of the precious
crystal handle of the walking-stick is a
small bnt powerful incandescent lamp
shining through a crystal lens. The light
is turned on and out at will.
It will be found useful for finding key-

house numbers, reading address cards and .
100 other purpose*.
The idea has been patented. Mr. Astor's
own cane ,is a thing of beauty. Cheaper
canes with tbfe light equipment will soon
be on the market designed for their
utility.
Edison's Latest.
The wonderful fluorescent screen, behind
which a man stands while the operator is
looking through the flesh and examining
the bones, recently "invented by Mr. Edi
son, is fully described in the New York
Journal :
"Here," said Mr. Edison, pointing to a
great box-like structure the size of a door,
"that is my screen. I will have a man
step in front of that, put four or five
Crookes tubes behind him, and you or I or
a surgeon will look through him as clean
and as clear as though he were made of I
gauze. We can look through his eves into
his skull and see everything that is to be I
seen there. A physician may diagnose his
case in an instant. He will simply put his
hand before the screen and then penetrate
him through from head to foot."
The fluorescent substance used is tung
state of calcium; in other words, tungstate
and lime. Tbe two substances are fused
in a furnace, and at a proper degree of
heat form little crystals, perhaps one
eighth the size of a French pea These
crystals are glued to a piece of paper by
means of collodium. a transparent cellu
loid paint.
The screen is made in the shape of a
monster mill hopper, standing on end.
'1 he face on which the crystals are applied
will be about eight feet high and four feet
broad. â  To this face will be fastened sides
that will slant inward to a sharp point. At
this point there will be left a slit just large
enough to see through with ease. This
slit will be protected by means of a rubber

flap, in such a way as to exclude all light
when the eye is applied to it. The
screen will be set up so that the side on
which the tungstate of calcium has been
glued faces a row of four or five Crookes
tubes, set one above the other at an equal
distance. The person to be examined will
then step in between the screen and the
light, and he will be instantly penetrated
and become visiWe to the eyes of the ex
aminer at the screen. Every defect, every
organ will be laid bare to the physician or
other person who is making the examina
tion. It will not be necessary to go to the
trouble of disrobing, as the clothing worn
will be penetrated as if it were the flimsiest
mosquito netting.
How . the Megatherium Looked.
Some idea of the proportions of extinct
mammals, birds and reptiles may doubt
less be gained from their skeletons prop
erly restored and mounted in museums,
but the* impressions thus acquired are
neither accurate nor distinct, and must
prove unsatisfactory, when we attempt,
aided by our fancy, to use them in bring
ing before our mental vision the real
stature and bulk of the animals in the
flesh.
There are two reasons for this, says J.
Carter Beard in Popular Science News.
Skeletons are considerably smaller than
the forms of which they are the frame
work, and objects the size of which are fa
miliarly known to us are wanting for con
trast. A skeleton in a glass case, or set up
by itself on a platform, has this in com
mon with most illustrations in popular
books of natural historics â there is seldom
anything very near it by which the size of
the animal represented can be immedi
ately grasped and recognized.
Size is so much a matter of comparison
that it is only by observing the proportion
one object bears to another that we can
form any idea at all of magnitude. If we
could put on glasses that magnified the
objects we saw about us twenty diame
ters we would soon become so accustomed
to the apparent size ot everything that
unless we took off our spectacles, they
I would not seem to magnify at all. Indeed
J it can truly be said that no two persons
I see alike in respect to the apparent mag
nitude of what they see, so that if one per
son could look t i rough the eyes of an
other, he might, as long as the impression
remained of things as he had formerly
seen them.be surprised at the different
size they now assumed. Truly, however,
if the reader could be transported back to
some of the geological periods through
which our earth has passed he could easily
imagine he was looking through some
medium that greatly magnified the objects
upon which he gazed.
Among mammals in the quarternary
period he might possibly encounter one re
sembling nothing even in the wildest fan
cies of poets or painters (so much stranger
is truth than fiction) that has ever been
imagined as a form of life.
This is the megatherium, literally great
beast. He is seen in a grove of American
agaves or century plants, upon which he
feeds, and as he fears his huge form aloft
he overtops them all and rivals in height
the lofty flower stems of those in bloom:
indeed he far surpasses in size and bulk
the largest existing elephant, being no less
than eighteen feet long. His comparatively
small head and the apparently dispro
portionate length of his fore limbs make
him look even larger than he is. He rises
to his full height and stands erect upon a
tripod formed of his hind legs and his

{ enormously thick, conical-shaped tail, his
I fore limbs, which grotesquely resemble in
shape the arms of a human being, embrace
the trunk of a well-grown tree.
He settles himself firmly upon his
caudal support and the outer edges of his
I hind feet, for he does not tread with their
j soles, and prepares to wrestle with his
vegetable prey.
In order that the reader may properly
appreciate the enormous size of this long
I deceased mammal an illustration is given
on this page showing his megatherium
ship on a visit to a â¢ quiet street in the
suburbs, with a horse near by to empha
size his great proportions.
A Dog Mourn a for a Cat.
A dog and a cat belonging to the same
master were the best of friends in the
world, says l'Eleveur, and spent their time
in frolicking together. One day while
playing 'us usual the cat died suddeniv,
falling at the dog's feet. The latter at first
id not realize what had : happened, but
continued his play, pulling, pushing and
caressing his companion, but with evident
astonishment at ber inertness.
v After some time he appeared to under
stand the situation, and his grief found
vent in ; prolonged howls. . Presently he
was seized witn the idea of ; burying the
cat. He pulled her into the garden; where
he soon dug a hole with his paws, and put
in it the body of * his former companion.
He then refilled the hole with dirt, and,
stretching " himself â¢ out on the grave, le-
sumed his mournful howling. The idea of
burying the dead cat was extraordinary.
Whence came the thought?
Could it be imitation, or, which :is a
better explanation, did the dog have a I
vague idea of concealing the event, which
might possibly, be imputed to him? But j
then it would'seem unreasonable for him I
to call attention to the fact by installing
himself on the grave and howling. How- j
ever, even human criminals are sometimes
equally inconsistent. It is difficult to form
an : exact idea of what gave rise to the
dog's conduct in this case.
A Volcano for Sale.
People who would like to buy a volcano
may now do so if the advertisements in
some of the London dailies are bona fide.
Among other advertisements of auction
sales the island volcano situated in the
Liparian Archipelago, is announced for
sale to the highest bidder at auction dur
ing the next month. The crater on this
island has been slightly active for a num
ber of years past, though no immediate
danger of an eruption is feared.
A New Hand Camera.
M. Joux has lately perfected a new form
of hand camera, which has been used for
several months, and which, it is said, gives
excellent results, says the Paris Photo
graphic Journal. One of the principal im
provements is what he terms the "block
system." By this arrangement it is im-

possible to expose the same plate twice,
since the shutter cannot be released until
after the exposed plate has been changed.
The mode of changing the plate is very
simple, the construction of the magazine
being such as to permit of its turning com
pletely into the box after a plate is
changed, and there is no lost space, the
whole camera being very compactly built.
As shown in Fig. 2, the changing of the

plate is effected by pulling on the handle
at the lower part of the side; in this way
the size of the magazine (one of the sides
of which is shown extended) is increased,
and the extended magasine draws out
with it at the same time the stack of plates
with the exception of the one situated at
the top. This one, held Dack'by two

falls to the bottom when it is no longer
sustained by the rest of the pile. When
the magazine is pushed back the pile of
plates slide over the fallen plates at the
bottom, at the same time bringing a fresh
plate at the top into position for the next
exposure.
The magazine contains eighteen plates,
and an indicator moving automatically
always shows the number of exposed
plates. A clear finder with a cover folds
down into the thickness of the box, when
the camera is put into its carrying-case.
The objective with an iris diaphragm is a
very rapid Zeiss, F-8; the front part of the
box is moved back and forth by means of

A Transparent Mirror.
A transparent mirror waÂ§ brought from
Germany to this country a few months
ago by a New York firm and the
perplexing qualities, of the glass excited
much curiosity. It was at once in demand
for. many purposes and I the same ] firm ' is
now engaged in importing it in large quan
tities. *
The coating is placed on one side of the
glass just the same as the silvering on the
mirror and has the same properties of re
flecting the rays of light and color. .The
difference, however, is that v when : looked
at from the back: the coating is entirely
transparent. To one . sitting ; indoors the
view without \ is " not f obstructed:; in ; the
least, but â  a 'â â  pedestrian ' peering into s the
window or doorway would be greeted by

largely in lieu of screens where privacy lis
desired without obstruction of light from

The method of ; securing this effect is
described in a recent number of the
American Druggist. It is as follows:
Dissolve one part by weight of silver ni
trate in ten parts by weight of water and
label No. 1. Prepare another 10 per
cent solution of silver nitrate, but in
larger quantity; to this add ammonia
water, drop by drop, stirring carefully
until the precipitate formed at first is com
pletely dissolved, and label No. 2. Now
add solution No. Ito solution No. 2 until
the odor of ammonia is no longer recogniz
able and tlio liquid has again become very
turbid. Now add 100 parts by weight of
distilled water for every part of silver
nitrate originally used in solution No. 2,
and filter until clear.
Label this No. 3. Prepare a reducing so
lution by dissolving 0.9 part by weight of
Rochelle salt in 384 parts by weight of dis
tilled water, boil, and to the boiling solu
tion add gradually a solution of 3 1 parts of
silver nitrate in 10 parts by weight of dis
tilled water, and filter when cool and label
No. 4. ,
Clean the glass to be coated thoroughly,
lay it on a perfectly level surface in a room
at" a temperature of about 25 degrees C.
(77 degrees F.). Mix equal parts of No. 3
(the depositing fluid) and No. 4 (the re
ducing fluid) ; and pour over the glass.
The class may, if preferred, be dipped into
the solution. /:
The time required for the deposition of
the layer of silver of just the correct thick
ness has. to be determined by the judg
ment of the operator in each case, and
this may be aided somewhat by observing
a piece of- white -paper below the
plate of â¢ glass. When > a; sufficient
deposit of ' silver â  has â¢ been made, and
much less is required than for an
ordinary -mirror, ' pour off f the ; silvering
liquid and rinse thoroughly with the | dis
tilled water, and stand the mirror on edge
to dry, coat the silvered side with â  a solu
tion of colorless shellac ;â  in â  alcohol '. and
finally frame the mirror with a backing of
clear glass : to protect the mirror surface
from being scratched. ';
Solace for a Scolding.

Â«â  â *â -^ ASTER Sunday at last! How
I A much that means, in more senses
Cthan one. -but on the beautiful
Christian understanding of this
season I must not dwell, for to
me belongs the discussion of all the love
liest, freshest and daintiest of spring and
summer apparel, for were our stores ever
quite so attractive as they are just at
present? Downtown a very brief tour of
inspection will reveal the fact that the
prettiest of capes and mantels, the most
ethereal and artistic of lawns, mulls and
organ the choicest and most beautiful
of silks and the most chic bonnets and
hats are to be bad in this City, which can
not be said to be lacking in well-groomed,
stylishly clad women.
Naturally the past week has been ex
tremely quiet from a social standpoint,
but the coming days, until the exodus be
gins, will be well tilled. Many teas and
receptions are announced, several dances
and the usual number of card parties.
Too bad, is it not. that several delightful
affairs have had to be "indefinitely post
poned."
I understand that one of our belles has
no superstition concerning the month of
May, as her wedding will take place on
the"_oth.
Little Sausalito is to be gay this sum
mer, and its rival, "beautiful Belvedere,"
is to be a favorite resort, some of our most
delightful people having secured cottages
for nve months, so "the Night in Venice"
will, it is predicted, be a more brilliant
success than ever. The usual set will be
seen at Monterey, Santa Cruz and Castle
Crags.
As most of us wear corsets, they are a
generally interesting subject, and at the
present moment embroidered batistes are
the favorite materials used. They come
in rose pink, blue, silver gray and helio
. trope, which are all embroidered in a silk
of the same color, and there are also white
batistes with colored designs upon them,
and black batistes similarly treated. Bro
cades are always used in the manufacture
of these useful adjuncts to our wardrobes,
but those most liked exhibit the choicest
of patterns of Louis Seize type, and pink
roses on a pearl satin ground is a combina
tion always dainty and desirable. Corsets
are being made with special care for ath
letic women. Bicyclists have their stays
made short in front and long in the back
for riding. The short French corsets are
always worn, and now many slender
women are wearing them altogether.
Smartly gowned New York women declare,
many of them, that to go through the
season it iB necessary to have at
least a dozen pairs, with petticoats to
match, which is the correct thing now
adays, and the florated designs are pe
culiarly adapted to tins purpose, botn
light and dark colors being used. The
corset should be finished with lace and
three rows of beading, through which
narrow satin ribbons are run. I
am glad to be able to announce
that the correct corsets are short on the
hips and low in the bust, which gives a
more natural figure, as those which lace
down the hips, making the flesh bulge out
lower down, are in decided bad taste.
Petticoats are, if possible, more lovely
than ever, and â¢ are most carefully fitted
over the hips, the fullness all being carried
to the back. A deep Spanish flounce,
finished by a narrow ruffle, gives the ne
cessary width around the bottom. A
good silk must be used which will stand
out well, and a very narrow steel tape
run through the beading of the ruffles
gives the necessary flare. A very recent
bride had one of her pairs of "stays" made
of a heavy silk, tight blue- in shade,
covered with blurred pink Dresden roses
and dotted with white. A petticoat of the
same silk has a little niche-like ruffle of
lace around the bottom of the Spanish
ruffle. For evening wear her skirt and
corsets . are of white watered moire
covered with clusters of buttercups.
These charming things are all very well
for those who can afford them, but most
of us have to have our corsets cleaned and
done over, and are thankful if we own a
new pair and two others in good condi
tion, even if only of'coutil. But I have
friends who declare that they prefer to
have every year a pair of silk or satin
corsets from one of the best makers/even
if they have to do without a new dress;
and there is good sense in this sometimes,
when, for instance, : one has a very
difficult figure to manage, or when there
are any defects that must be carefully
hidden. Then even the most expensive of
corsets must, if necessary, be procured;
but when a woman has a figure like a
broom dandle she certainly can find plenty
of corsets for *5 or $7 that will answer
every purpose; and all corsets will lose
their shape if worn too long, so it is best
generally to have three or four pairs in
stead of one, only one of satin or silk.
There is a fad now for having underwear
THE LATEST
FASHION
GOSSIP
for Women
And
Men
I made by hand, many women ordering all
:of theirs from charitable institutions,
where the sewing and embroidering is ex
quisitely done. This idea is an i-xcellent
( one, as certainly it is more satisfactory to
; 1 aye hand work, and, besides, in New
j York alone it means bread for many
| starvine women and young girls; so most
I brides are now ordering at least one or
two sets of underwear to be made by
hand.
Those who imagine they can tuck in a
piece of material in front and have a
lovely vest effect are sadly mistaken and
usually look hopelessly dowdy. One end
I of the stuff is certain "to be sticking out,
or the whole arrangement, in spite of de
taining pins, slips around and gets
crooked, so I have come to the conclusion,
from observation, that to successfully
make a vest it must be fitted on a perfectly
tight lining of silt* in preference, and the
lining once secure, the variations are
easily managed under skillful amateur di
rections. A white silk lining fastened
down the back, supplied with small
sleeves, will do to begin with. The front
can then be adorned with pleated tulle
and the neck may be finished with a stock
of Dresden ribbon or any new and pretty
ribbon, or with soft filling of tulle or lace
used as a cravat, and when weary of these
arrangements try grasslawn, striped with
cream-colored lace, making the pointed
collar to turn over a broad band of white
satin ribbon. These pointed collars are
extremely narrow, measuring at their
widest point only about one and a half
inches. Vests of black tulle, net and
chiffon, with an applique of cream lace,
are excellent, as is also one of white lisse,
with cream lace applique; and a sensible
vest I have just seen is of plain white
tucked muslin, overhangine. a belt and
fastened down the front with tiny pearl
studs.
1 have been inspecting the newest mo
hairs and alpacas ana find that they ap
pear under every imaginable aspect â
plain, shot and embroideredâ but I prefer
the plain ones, finding them the most
economical, as well as the most attractive.
More than one stylish girl is going to
have a white mohair skirt made over
white glace to take away with her this
summer, with which she will wear, per
haps, a dozen different waists, ail of which
wiil be fashioned out of quaint and charm
ing fabrics composed of silk, most of them,
or of mousseline de soie, or chiffon. For
morning wear, in the country, one belle
has had two creamy skirts of batiste made
up, with which she will have one waist to
match, with bright green ribbons, over
which is ; arranged some fine French
batiste embroidery; then she has a waist
of palest blue organdy covered with buff
roses and trimmed with creamy lace. A
thick waist of light-sprigged pale lawn has
a stock and waistband of ribbon which
match the batiste.
All of these will wash perfectly, and be
fresh and sweet all summer. I know
some of you will say, Why, alpacas, mohair
and batistes have been worn for two
years, so this is nothing new, for by na
ture we are critical. However, lam quite
aware of this and only make these sug
gestions, as among the multitudes of pretty
summer things offered us this season it is
no easy matter to decide which are best to
select, and before making purchases I ad
vise you ail to carefully examine last sum
mer's garments, as frequently with a little
care and management we can have a very
beautiful outfit at a trifling outlay. I re
peat, that grass linens are to be very com
mon.
Last year they were in such great vogue
that well-dressed women no longer con
sider them. Their day is passed for those
who are up to date, but naturally the
market will be flooded with them, the
plain ones, the dotted, the striped and
those adorned with cross lines and squares,
beside there are those ; that come done up
nicely in boxes with fronts, collars and
cuffs and white embroidery over a color.
Do not be tempted by theseâ they are
not for you â that is, if you wish to' be at
tired stylishly. An odd sort of robin's
egg blue is to be had in both : duck and
denim, but I, for my part, prefer the duck,
as it has an underthread of black, and it

I commend to your admiring'considera
tion the organdies and lawns just uncased.
Young girls are to have numerous tulle
frocks, and "Malines tulles" are to be had
in every possible shade. They will be
trimmed with lace, and all and every kind
of lace, provided it is good, is in demand.
Irish point is a great favorite, as is also
Honiton. Paillettes and sequins play an
important part in the newest embroideries.
East and in Europe gauzes are in great
demand, being of most unusual beauty.
Transparent materials over silks will be
universally seen, . and loose-fitting fronts
are no longer considered the latest for
bodices.
The latest innovations in silks are the
shaded effects, in which the blurred color
ings fade into one another, as in a rain
bow. There is a novelty in moiresâ
"moire velours" â which comes in white,
with green, pink and white blended, or any
other coloring, and is sometimes accom
panied by white stripes. Matrons con
tinue to use stamped velvets for dinner
gowns, the colors now being spring-like
and delicate.
A deeper cream, tones of green, many
of them revived from the forties, rich and
pale violet, royal blues, the beautiful
geranium pink, a. new shade of vieux rose
and straw-yellow, are all fashionable
colors, and in everything do we see an un
expected touch of black.
Matrons will use for some of their new
est gowns many yards of the black lisse
now in such vogue, which has white lace
sprays let in at intervals and uniting into
consecutive patterns by deep gold pail
lettes, which are also introduced onto the
lace; but newer is a "white lisse ground
with alternate black stripes, both worked
in tambour stitch, with pretty running
sprays. The contrast of black and white
embellished with soft embroidery makes a
beautiful skirt front to the season's silks,
and in this case the black embroidery is
emphasized by white paste stones scat
tered over it with a liberal hand.'' Very
effective also is a trellis work of silver
thrown on black.
A few days ago I observed a pretty slen
der woman attired in a gown made of
cornflower blue facecloth, which had a
bodice of silk to match it and a belt of
gold galoon on which jet motifs were
shown at intervals. A toque of corn
flowers was made very attractive with a
bow of green and white tulle.
The Parisian evening gown I illustrate
to-day is "made in one of the new and
beautiful chine moire veloutines, with a
short lace bolero jacket, embroidered with
[ paillettes and foiming two battlemented !
I tabs over the large sleeves, which are j
! caught up with a bunch of flowers. This
: gown is laced at the back and a beautiful j
piece of jeweled embroidery borders the
top of the bodice and the front."
The other design should be carefully !
noted, as the sleeve is an original design
well worthy of reproduction. It completes I
a "fetching" gown.
A princess costume fresh from the hands
of a leading dressmaker is in a diagonal !
I cloth of the new blue gros; it has the
fronts outlined with black silk ruching ;
I and small barrel buttons with little chains :
j attached to them. The sleeves have the j
| purled part striped with the ruching.
A costume of canvas cloth of a warm !
â¢ cinnamon tan which highly commends it- 'â¢
I self to me is described as "having a plain
skirt finished on the bottom with a wire. !
j A round bodice entering the skirt has a
j back of canvas cloth, drawn smoothly over
j a tight lining, while the front is a blouse
lof accordion-pleated cerise and green
changeable taffeta and fastens on the side.
Three half-pointed oval bands of canvas
cloth, fitted over the blouse, so as to show
the silk in spaces between, are sewed into
the bodice seams on the right and hook
across to the opposite side. On the upper
end of each band, close to the bodice, six
Bmali pearl buttons are sewed close to
gether, for ornament. Gigot sleeves/long
in the arm of canvas cloth with a
small crescent cut out of the mate
rial of the upper arm, near the
waist, showing a bit of the silk under
neath. At the end, near the seam, there
is a finish of three small pearl buttons.
The pointed canvas girdle has a row of six
small buttons on each side, in front. The
choker is of canvas cloth, a wide band
with two square tabs twining over and un
der the ear, where the band ends, and is
finished with an upright row of five but
tons. Fine white silk cord laces these but
tons together over a white batiste and lace
bow, formed of two plisse fans, edged with
lace. These tabs are covered with batiste,
edged with narrow lace. Batiste and lace
cuffs to match finish the wrists of sleeve.
Vogue advises an ivy-green straw hat,
trimmed with scarfs of gauze, one of
brown ana one of a lighter shade of tan.
A lovely la France rose is to "upstand
above this bow with foliage." Tan suede
glove and a parasol of taffeta silk of two
shades of green complete . one of
the most artistic and charming toilettes
imaginable for a stylish young woman.
At most of the large balls given this sea
son in Paris the dresses nave had low bod
ices held up with shoulder straps of dia
monds, flowers, spangled galore, or ribbon
bows. Balloon sleeves appear to have
been given up for such occasions, being re
placed with cascades of jet falling from
the shoulder-straps or loops of satin rib
bon falling on the arms. The skirts are
cut round and have godets at the back.
Flowers are much used on evening confec
tions and are gracefully arranged round
the low neck, as shoulder straps or
bretelles, and also round the bottom of
skirts, they are put on straight or fes
tooned, or a spray may start from a bow
and extend down the sides of the tablier
and fall artistically on to the hem of the
skirt.
Pompadour silks and satins are being
used by Felix for ball and evening toilettes,
and for bodices he frequently utilizes tulle
or velvet, and almost without exception
they are made pointed. The dressmakers
may prevail on us to let them trim the
skirts of our evening dresses, but they will
not succeed yet awhile in persuading us to
have our street and calling dress skirts
adorned ( ?), as our leaders of fashion have
pronounced ideas of their own, and are as
independent as their forefathers, and, as
one writer says, "It is becoming somewhat
difficult to predict ' what the American
woman will accept in the way of styles,"
as she fully realizes that she "has quite as
much taste as her Parisian sister, although
as yet I doubt if she can utilize every scrap
of lace and every bit of silk with quite as
good results, but we are not dependent
on the French any longer ' for our
fashionsâ the New York women set the
styles in this country. - 1 have just read an
I article which states that "great dressmak-
I ers are" great personages in Paris and are
i recognized as having great talent. ? The
press extols them and discusses their crea
! tions," but in this country no such fuss is
j made over them ; and our press does not
constantly relate ' their triumphs. How
ever, it is dawning on most people that
I our ideas and conceptions are excellent
and worthy of imitation; indeed, many of
them have been adopted in England, and
| in no country : are the children so beauti
fully and appropriately garbed as in
America. ;â 
Immense spreading collars, a la Medicis,
are being tried experimentally, but I doubt
that they will be favorably received. ;
The general effect aimed at this summer
will be puffy, and voluminous, especially
with the capes, in light materials covered
with ; ribbon. ' sequins, â¢ laces, â ', frills and
flounces, ruches and flowers, and no spring
PARISIAN EVENING GOWN.
toilette can be considered complete with
out one of the delightful short mantles
which are enjoying such great popularity.
One I greatly admired is of black velvet
with gores of white satin, with an ap
plique of white lace flowers traced with jet
and steel. A white satin lining peeps be
neath the hem of this, elaborately frilled
with white silk-edged chiffon. Another
little mantle has a yoke and vest cut in
one, and tight-fitting, of green miroir
velvet, and beneath a ruche of black satin
ribbon is gathered a cape of glace silk cov
ered with black lace, embroidered in many
colors with tambour stitch, interspersed
with flowers formed of narrow ribbons.
This mantle is of an especially good shape,
pointing as it does over the elbows.
_ A novel material is used in the composi
tion of one of the latest spring cloaks,
which extends to the hem of the dress.
The material is named "chine brocatelle,"
and is in-many colors on a black ground.
The yokels of mulberry hued velvet, over
which there is a chine flowery design
traced with jet and colored beads. A vel
vet collar turns down at tbe neck and dis
plays a- facing of guipure embroidery.
A chic coat of glace silk, shot with green,
dark red and dull gold, is accordion |
pleated, with epaulettes of gold thread
traced with jet and outlined with a silk
edged kilted frill of black chiffon.
Slender women who are fond of close
fitting gowns will do well to consider one
of brown face cloth, which has a bodice of
brown velvet relieved ,by an open waist
coat composed of white cloth embroidered
in shades of violet. A hat of a darker
shade of brown in a fancy straw should be
trimmed with scarfs of creamy white and
light brown tulle. Flags in two shades
of violet give the necessary color. *
Face cloth, or a lightweight Melton
cloth in any of the new shades will make
a stylish gown with a sacquelike coat with
simple black satin bands and tabs. A
smart tailor gown is of a fine green Melton,
which is run ' with a tiny under thread of
white. It has a triple collar, and turned
back cuffs are of white cloth, covered with
an applique design in green silks.
For a young girl a very simple and styl
ish gown is of a fine, soft, gray cloth, ta'lor
made, over a changeable silk, with a waist
coat of drab cloth embroidered in small
blue or red figures. This costume will be
useful on so many occasions that it pays to
have It made by the best tailor in the city
of the finest goods. Dark blue or brown
cloth would be also stylish, but neither of
these colors is so youthful or becoming as
gray, provided the maiden has a clear skin
and a good color; besides, dark shades look
very untidy if in the least dusty.
Now we all feel a keen interest once
more in evening toilettes, so I am sure we
will like to hear how one of light lavender
satin was made. The back breadth was
kilt-pleated, and over its entire length fell
kilt-pleated tulle, scarfs of the same drap
ing it from the back to the side breadth.
The low bodice of lavender satin had a
deep ruche of chiffon, embroiaered in tiny
beads in a design of wistaria. The sleeve
were of the satin covered with the kilted
tulle, and consisted of a long puff which
started from the shoulders and covered
the point of the elbow. They were fin
ished with a twist of pearl white satin
ribbon, over which was a wistaria vine.
This ended in a small bow. A large and
remarkably pretty bow of this with long
wide ends adornad the back of the waist and
fell to within two or three inches of the
bottom of the skirt.
Felix has just completed a very satis
factory frock. The skirt is of pink moire
con nee, striped with blue. The blouse
waist is low and ' has a full round basque
flounce in pink silk muslin. The sleeves
are double bouillonne. The pink muslin
is seen through the opening of the corselet,
which has deep-pointed fronts fastened
with graduated bows in blue satin. Bows
also appear on each shoulder. One of
Worth latest would suit â¢ a bride very
nicely, although there is nothing espe
cially new in the style. The skirt is as
usual godeted ; it is of white tulle over a
foundation of white satin, and is trimmed
with two sets of fire rows of satin ribbon.
The tablier drapery is looped up on either
side - ith a tuft and trail of roses. The
same flowers adorn the low-pointed bodice
and rest on the left reveres in the soft
folds of the tulle, which is also used for a
baretta and for the short sleeves, "a mass
of diaphanous flutings." On the should
ers are loops of the satin ribbon.
Speaking of simple ; summer dresses for
young girls, I have seen as good results
produced by having- for mulls, organdies,
etc., a well-fitted silk foundation. The
waist must be most carefully fitted and
lined, and the skirt should have several
ruffles of silk and laces, one of which
should be wired, as though each dress was
made over its own lining, which would be
very expensive. There is no reason why
one's maid should not tack the thin
dresses to the silk slips in such a way that
they: would set perfectly. It is well to
have several silk shirts and waists of be
coming shades, if you- expect to spend
your summer, or even a few weeks,' at any
fashionable resort, as you will want to be
cool and comfortable, as well as correctly
clad. . .:â :â¢ *
A creation for a matron is composed of a
soft gray miroir satin, with a black velvet
for trimmings,' over which are bands of
Honiton insertion."; These bands < begin on
the shoulders and are carried down the
fronts, and, finish i with ; a bow, which is
placed slightly below the waist line. The
skirt is full and absolutely plain, and with'
a shot violet silk. *' â¢

Some of the most admired gowns for
bridesmaids, which will be worn ere long,
are of white satin, lined with pink glace.
With these gowns will be seen rose pink
chiffon fichus, and great picture hats of
white straw, trimmed with clusters of la
France roses; the same roses wiil form the
bouquets.
When Mrs. Astor's grandniece, Miss
Ethel Kingsland, is married this week the
pathway to the altar will be strewn with
roses by two maids of honor, who will be
attired in true Marie Antoinette costumes,
and will wear the hats in vogue at that
period.
So many of the old Southern homes
have fallen into decay that it reads like a
page of an old romance, the description of
the wedding which took place about two
weeks ago at Buckland, the picturesque
and spacious manor of Dr. Richard C.
Smith of Gates County, North Carolina.
In this old home is a historical Colonial
staircase, and as a writer in Vanity says:
"A subject for a superb picture was
formed when, to the strains of Men
delssohn's march, the beautiful bride de
scended the famous Colonial' staircase,
preceded by a dainty little girl scattering
flowers, while the old colored mammy,
who has been in the family forty years,
carried the long court train, her head
aloft with dignity and pride, increased by
the joy of wearing a rich red silk turban.
It was a typical Southern country wed
ding, and Southern hospitality was dis
pensed generously and luxuriously." 1 - i
Next autumn in New York a "series of

worthy of consideration.

HOW TO BE HAPPY ON EASTER
â¢â¢Till Morning's Joys Shall End the
Night of Weeping"â Read the
Rest.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 31.â Good
Friday had gone by, the children had
been told the meaning of the hot cross
buns, and somebody's baby , had been
rapturously kissed because she said, bang
ing her rosy little fist on the table, "I
wouldn't hurt the Good Man, and I'd kill
the naughty people who did it." Then
came Saturday, and there was a quiet
over all the house as if some one we loved
had said good-by to us forever; and yet,
there was a hope. Saturday evening
found three women meditatingâ we
belonged to that faith which values, most
of all, quietness and meditation, and
which teaches that the greatest sermon is
preached by one's own heart.
At last I was left alone. Because the
night was chilly there was a bright fire,
and as I looked at it I raised my eyes to
the clock above it, and saw that it was the
eleventh hour of the night. The chime
rang out softly a3 if in the presence of the
dead, and I fell into my own comfortable
chair and looked at the fire; in it seemed
to glow in letters of deeper fire and deeper
red, "And the sea gave up the dead which
were in it; and death and hell delivered
up the dead which were in them ; and they
were judged every man according to his
works." "
My heart repeated the last line, "Ac
cording to his works." And then there
came over me a great awe, siva I saw all
the world standing before the Maker of it
to be judged. And some trembled and were
frightened; and many hoped; and some
acted as if they cared for nothing, but
as they separated and each went toward
the great = white "throne, alone, to stand
before God and be judged according to his
works, there came a horror like unto
nothing that I can describe. " And some
one standing near me said, "I am not
afraid to be judged before the whole world,
but oh! the awfulness of that time, alone
with God, with only my sins to face me."
. And the man went by me, one whom I
had known as kind-hearted, pleasant and
of whom nothing worse was said than that
he was his own worst enemy. Some one
asked himâ could it have been the Judge?
âin a rich, beautiful voice, "Where pre
the gifts that were yours?" Where is the
great talent that was given unto you?
What have you done with that ability to
speak and persuade men to do the right?
Buried it under the sins of the flesh; killed
it by gluttony and lust?" And the man
passed on with drooping head, and I saw
him no more.
Then came a woman. The world knew
her name as a leader in great charitable
works.
, The church knew her name as one ever
ready to pray, and of her it was said that
she led what was called a strict life. And
the voice demanded: "Where are the
little children I put into your arms? I
gave them to youâ soft, loving and pure;
in return they have come to me women
hard of heart, full of vanity and despising
everything that bears the nameof religion.
They are men who joy in having no
belief, and who count life as of no worth
except for the pleasure to be trained from
it. This is your work. You taught them,
not the love, but the vengeance of God,
You taught them, not the gentleness but
the severity of that Father to whom they
had a right to turn in their hours of sad
ness or gladness. They asked you for
motherly love and sympathy; you gave
them a hurried answer, and reminded them
of your duties to the outside world. You
were eager to save the souls of the
heathen in far off lands, and you gave no
thought to those young creatures who had
been put in your charge. You lived a

3Vt. _BÂ»_Fl.__3XJi_. : cfc SON,

wicked life, you were an unkind mother,
an unloving wife, and I see no page in the
book of your lif â¢ that can make the judg
ment waiting for you any less severe than
it is." And this woman looked around for
her children, but they were strangers to
her. And she looked for the societies over
which she had presided, but there were
none. Every man was trying to care for
his own soul, knowing that he would be
judged according to his works.
And there was another. One of whom
the world . had said that harm was not in
him. But he was reprimanded for indo
lence, for lack of thought and reminded
that at ease with himself he never allowed
himself to be troubled about the sorrow of
any one else. Then I looked at the skies
above me and they were blackest over
those men who. had wronged women and
little children, over those women who
had been hard of heart and cold of speech,
but they were also daik over those who
had wronged the weak and hurt the dumb
animals who couldn't speak, and yet who
were so loyal, ' And some claimed that
they only had little sins.
The little sins collected together seemed
to make a huge black ball ready to strike
them and send them into darkness. An
other woman I knew went by me and
caught my skirt, saying she was so afraid.
And the Voice said to her, "You thought
of nothing while living but that which
made you more attractive in the eyes of
the world. Here your jewels and your
velvets and your silks do not hide
the black heart tbat they, cover. Tha
little pink tongue that shows between
those deceitful lips has 'liar' writ
ten upon it. and the white hands are
marked 'dishonest,' for instead of using
your beauty for some great pnrpose you
made fools of men with it. "i ou stole
away their brains and made them misuse
the talents that came to them from
heaven.'" And as she went away some
thing awesome came about. Under her
beautiful clothes could be seen her body,
and on it burned in letters of fire the sins
of which she had been rightfully accused.
All at once everybody disappeared. But
where men and women had been I saw
troops and troops of little children hurry
ing as fact as they could, the tiniest ones
tumbling over each other in their eager
ness to get ahead. And I stopped one and
asked her what it all meant; and in the
voice of a child that I knew, of a child who
had gone to sleep long ago, she answered:
1 "We are the little children going to plead
for our mothers." And the Voice said:
"There ara women wicked enough to kill
their unborn babies, and yet these chil
dren are, so many times, their salvation.
Baby hands have led many a woman in
the way she should go. and to a woman
whose heart is loving even a dead baby
means much, for it is one who kneels at
the throne and never ceases to pray."
It is a wonderful story this of the resur
rection of the dead â none the less wonder
ful because it is true. Isn't it beautiful
that we women can think that the last to
give a tender thought to the Christ Man
were women â the mother who bore him,
and the woman who had sinned and been
forgiven. And it is more beautiful to
think that they were the first to hear the
wonderful news that he had risen from
the dead, and become the first fruits of
them that slept.
God bless everybody on Easter morning!
God give them a happy day and make the
year to come a better one better, because
in it there may be buried those sins tbat
seem so little, and that means so much.
Again, I say, God bless everybody on
Easter morning ! All that I can remem
ber; all that is imprinting itself on my
mind, are the last lines of the Easter
hymn: 7:7:7777
Till morning's Joy shall end the night of weeping,
And life's long shadows break in cloudless love.
A dream? Yes. But I believe in dreams;
and it seems to me that special one came
to teach some of us to live, that when we
.die and have to spend those few minutes
alone with God, though we may be afraid,
still we need not fear that we will be judged
too harshly, for in the verdict there will
be considered the temptations and the en
vironments as* well as the prayers of the
little children, who are pleading for their
mothers. I believe it. Believe that the
dream was meant as a lesson to yon and
your neighbor, and Bab.

leading issues touched the best figures of the week.
The strength of the market In face of the an
nouncement of a probable shipment of one million
gold hv Tuesday, attracted attention. So far as
th*> shipment is concerned, it is stated that the
geld will not be put on board until the last mo
ment, and if there should be any material increase
In the supply Â°' bills Monday the shipment will
be canceled.
If the gold is forwarded it will be for the ample
reason that the exporters are unable to procure
the bills needed to make their settlements abroad.
The comparative!-- heavy decrease In the bank
reserve, which brings the amount held in excess
of 25 per cent required by law down to $17,000,
--003, had no influence. In fact, operators were dis
posed to look upon the bright side of things, and
were quick to take advantage of the favorable de
velopments of the day. Among these may be
noted the splendid traffic relations of the St.
Paul road and the advance of 25 cents per ton In
Iron made by the Tennessee Coal and Iron Com
pany. "
Manhattan was quite a bull card, rising from
107s/s to 109% on report- tbat the company will
secure Important privileges from the city in con
nection with the Brooklyn bridge traffic. Metro
politan Traction, on the other band, fell from
1051/4 to 102" _ on the talk about a strike of the
company's employes in this city. Among the
Western railways, St. Paul, Rock Island and Bur
-1 ington and Qulncy were in the best request, on re
ports mat Corn is' moving more freely. St. Paul
rose to 76*4 : Rock Island to 72*. and Burlington
to 78Afc. Union Pacific and the shares of the sub
sidiary lines were more prominent, and sold at
higher figures than of late on the belief that the
outlook for the reorganization had improved.
Alton and Terre Haute advanced 2*4 to 60*4 on
the official announcement that the road' bad Been
leased to the Illinois Central for ninety-nine years
from October 1, 1896, upon a guarantee of 2V_ per
cent per annum on the common stock. Among
the coal and iron stocks Tennessee Coal Jumped
about 2 percent to 30% and Illinois Steel 2*54 to
69%. The last named closed at 70 bid. Specula
tion closed strong. Ket changes showed gains of
i/4 to l'/g per cent. Tennessee Coal, however,
: gained 1% per cent. Total sales were 86,750

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. April 4.â Wheat was boomed
to-day on a rumor that the Ohio State report
showed a condition of 57 cent. The report,
however, will not be issued until Monday. The
same rumor was in circulation on Thursday, and
i caused firmness in prices on that day. The initial
trading this morning was at firm figures, a falling
off in the Argentine shipments last week to 685,
--000 bushels being the strengthening consideration.
The shipments from both coasts forthe week were
light at 1,693,000 bushels against 1,244,000 bush
els last week. There were no French or English
cables, those countries still enjoying a holiday.
Berlin quoted V* mark advance. Receipts in the
Northwest- were 477 cars. Chicago had 13 cars,
and inspected out 78,829 bushels. Atlantic ex
ports for two days were light at 69,540 bushels.
May wheal opened at 636/ B e. advanced to 645 8
64 3 4 c, where i; closed ly 8 e higher than Thursday,
mated receipts for Monday 10 cars.
CORNâ Obtained benefit from the strength of
wheat, but was not unusually active. A quiet
business was transacted, which was principally
local and scalping, privilege holders operating a
lot with a view of securing profits on their Invest
ments. There were no Liverpool cables. . Receipts
were 179 cars. No corn was inspected from store.
Export clearances were 174,628 bushels. May
corn owned at 296/ B e, sold between 29i_@29"j 8 c
and 298 /4 c, closing at 29' 4 c, y 8 4 c higher than
Tnursday. Estimated receipts for Monday 175
cars. â¢ ,
OATSâ Were fairly active, traders displaying a
disposition to Invest, relying on the strength of
wheat to assist prices, which it did. Receipts
were 139 cars. Withdrawals from store amounted
to 50,453 bushels. May oats closed V B c higher
than Thursday. Estimated receipts for Monday
165 cars. WHIWB
FLAX- Was steady. Cash. 88i/_@BBy a c: May,
86y 4 @B6*_c: June, B7*j4c; September, 90t_c.
Receipts were 35 cÂ«rÂ«
PROVISIONSâ Were generally easy. A weak
hog market was the basis of the feeling. The sen
timent in the market continues adverse to im
provement, to-day's trade demonstrating that
fact. May pork closed unchanged, May lard 2*,_c
lower, and May ribs 2" __;5c lower.

ANCIENT ORDER WORKMEN
Nineteenth Annual Meeting of
the Grand Lodge of
California.
DEGREE OF HONOR GRAND LODGE
The Representatives to Both Bodies.
Important Matters That Are
to Be Discussed.
The nineteenth annual meeting of the
Grand Lodge of the Ancient Order United
Workmen of California will be held in
B'nai B'rith Hall, commencing on Tues
day morning *?ext.
This -'ill be an unusually interesting
and important session to the members, as
it will discuss a great many matters that
are of vital interest to the members of the :
various lodges. Two hundred and twenty
three lodges will be represented at the
meeting.
William Yinter, the present grand fore
man, will succeed D. J. Toohy, the
present grand master workman.
The grand master workman has ap
pointed as committee on distribution: G.
H. Garthorne of Occidental Lodge, T. A.
Farless of Fidelity Lodge and us Pohl
man of Burns Lodge; committee on cre
dentialsâWilliam Tugcey of Unity Lodge.
Frederick B. Winter of Mount Hamilton
Lodge and C. S. Hoffman of Memorial
Lodge.
Among the matters to be brought up for
discussion will be one to provide for
county instead of lodge representation as
at present, the subordinate lodges to send
one delegate to the Grand Lodge for each
100 members. An effort will be made to
have the offices of guide, inside and out
side watchman, made appointive instead
of elective.
The Grand Lodge will be informed of the
work performed by the beneficial commis
sion that held its meeting last month in
tbe office of the supreme recorder in
Meadeville, Pa., and of which commission
David S. Hirshberg, the grand recorder of
the California Grand Lodge, was an active
member. â¢-:..â¢'
The scope of inquiry of this commission
was very broad and embraced almost
everything that is known in fraternal
organizations.
At the meeting papers were prepared by
the different members on subjects assigned
them, for special study at the meeting in
Chicago in June last. These papers covered
the subjects of classified assessments,
emergency fund, .the relict law (including
level maximums), the age limit (including
both minimum 'and maximum), classified
beneficiary certificates, admission of
females and statistics. All of these sub
jects were exhaustively discussed in the
several papers. In addition to these
papers the commission had collected a
mass of valuable matter relative to the
experience of other societies, including
the friendly societies of Great Britain. It
had also compilations of the statistics of
ten jurisdictions of the order, showing
their admission, mortality and lapse ex
perience from the beginning of the order
to the close of the year 189-1.
After digesting and arranging this great
fund of information as fully as the com
mission felt able to do it and putting it
into form for professional consideration,
the commission decided to refer it to com
petent actuaries for further advice, and
submitted inquiries which, when pro
fessionally answered, will enable the com
mission to present to the Supreme Lodge
in June, 1896. a most thorough review of
the situation from the standpoint of both
experience and theory, which will enable
that body to determine if any defects
exist in the system of Workmanship, if so,
what they are and also the remedy.
The following is a list of the grand offi
cers and of the representatives from the
subordinate lodges:
Past grand master workman, J. W.Ward;

FOUGHT FOR THE WASHING.
A Laundry man's Failure to Pay Rent
Causes a Small Blot.
Â§everal dozen residents of the vicinity, of
Stockton and Vallejo streets are mourning
the loss of 'the family washing, and; about
as many more are j congratulating them
selves on having* secured a fine assorted
lot of linen for nothing. . 7' ;>â '"â â¢
Up to Â« yesterday afternoon Wah Kee oc
cupied the building at 1416 Stockton street
as a laundry, but latterly failed â¢to pay
rent.- '-. .., ; - ,: '- â ;';.. *."''..â '
So Deputy Sheriff ; Radford and a couple
of assistants appeared at the laundry yes
terday and ordered Kee to vacate.,", This
order was obeyed instanter. â¢
The orders had been: to clear the house
of everything not belonging to the estate,,
and the deputies had no alternative 'but, to
put the numerous bundles of wash left by
the laundryman on the sidewalk.- The
news of the eviction had spread through;
the neighborhood; and a big crowd of men,!
women and children were on the sidewalk
when the, first bundle was tossed out. . A
dozen eager hands seized it almost before
it touched the pavement, and in an instant
the crowd had' closed iin and an exciting
struggle over socks, shirts and underwear
took place. â  ;'ll_tj^fy_fl il,^fÃ!_fl_H? t, y t B
Hardly a shred of the washing went to
the rightful owners. Wah Kee. is safe in
the mazes of Chinatown.

A VINDICATION AT LAST.
An Old Indictment Against
Charles Montgomery
. â  , Dismissed.
Remarks of District Attorney Barnes
and Judge Bahrs in Open
Court.
In Judge Bahrs court yesterday, on
motion of District Attorney Barnes, the
indictment against Charles Montgomery
was dismissed. This indictment was pro
cured twenty-two months ago through the
Grand Jury of which Sidney Mi Smith
was foreman, and all efforts of the defend
ant to obtain a trial of the case have since
been unavailing.
In moving yesterday for the dismissal of
the indictment District Attorney Barnes
spoke of .the high character, the integrity,
public spirit and benevolence of Charles
Montgomery. It was the judgment of the
District Attorney that the ' indictment
should not have been fonnd, and he there
fore moved for its dismissal in the interest
of justice and for the vindication of ' the
accused.
Judge Bahrs in granting the motion of
the District Attorney dwelt upon the in
just ice which Mr. Montgomery had suf
fered. The court regretted that the vindi
cation could not be made more ample and
complete.
; In an interview yesterday Mr. Mont
gomery said to a Call reporter: "
''This indictment was found twenty-two
months ago by the Grand Jury of which
Sidney Smith was. foreman. At that time
I was one of the directors of the People's
Home Savings Bank, having been chosen
for that position a short time before the
receiver was appointed. I went on . the
board at the . request \of 200 depositors to
protect ' their interests. In my official
capacity I voted to ; return the Swan berg
securities, and did so on the advice of my
attorneys, Delmas ' & Shortridge, and Dr.
.Taylor. ' For this action four of ,; the - di
."rectors, myself among the number, .were
indicted. The securities returned belonged
to Swanberg and not to ; the bank. My
career in San ; Francisco as a business man
was well known' to the jury," continued
Mr.Montgomery, "and it was known also
that my character as a man and a Chris
tian was without a stain, yet some influ
ence was exerted to cause the jury to in
dict me. .1 have waited a long time for a
, vindication and now it has been made by
the District Attorney and the Judge in
open court." '
Readers may call to mind that, the in
dictment against Mr. Montgomery was
found at r. the time certain men, ambitious
to gain control of the -bank, were going
ahead regardless of consequences to gain
their ends. Then it was quite an easy
matter to influence the public against all
who ban been connected with the bank
under McDonald, /tnd so Mr. Montgomery,
whose innocence of wrong-doing has been
clearly 'established, was accused 'along
.with the guilty in order to help the cause
of the Bchemers.'__SMÃ_o_Hb_H|
