SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.â Bossism I
in San Francisco was downed to-day. The I
dirty finger prints of Keilyism will be no i '
longer permitted to sully the fair throat of
Republicanism ; the clammy, unclean
Democratic paw of Raineyism was
brushed from the shoulder of Republi
canism in the metropolis, and thuggery,
ballot-box stuffery and the thousand and ;
one named and unnamed political in- !
iquities which have discraced not only
the Bay City but the entire State, have
been swept away.
it was a hard battle to fight in the face
of the combined power of all that is low,
unscrupulous and selfish in human
nature; but decency, the cause of good
order, of clean government won the battle.
There was one man who had the pluck,
the indomitable courage, the strength of
character, the will power, to lead the hosts
of decency against the myrmidons of cor
ruption. That man, John D. Spreckels,
triumphed against all the combinations
and all the odds that hud been arrayed
airainst him, and he did it with the help of
the honest, the respectable and the loyal
Republicans of San Francisco, backed by
the decent Republicans of the entire State.
The calumnies which had been heaped
upon him and shot at him from ambush
in darK corners fell broken and useless for
harm against the armor of the justice of
the cause of which he was the champion
The Republican party of California to-day
is dominated by no boss. It does not need
one. It has wise and able leaders, and
among them John D. Spreckels is far from
being the least wise or the least able.
The Republicans of the State were not
ungrateful to the man who had done so
much for the party, for Mr. Spreckels was
this evening elected National Republican
Committeeman from California to succeed â¢
M. H. de Young.
As an evidence of the -completeness of
Mr. Spreckels' victory the fact is empha
sized that out of a total vote of 635 in the
convention to-day he received 565, lack
ing only seventy votes of being elected t
unanimously. Mr. Spreckels, in an inter
view given in another part of this issue,
said that he was thoroughly and com
pletely satisfied with the result of the
convention, and that he would faithfully
carry out the wishes of the Republicans of
the State of California.
The victory means much that is pood
for the State. In the clearer atmosphere I
after the shower, the bluer sky after the
clouds have melted into rain, may be seen
the peaceful augury of Republican success
in the great battle that must be fought
when the leaves have turned into the sere
and yellow of the fall.
In the convention proceedings to-day
there was a pleasing variety of features.
George A. Knight and Senator Spencer
furnished the tragedy, with the Minneapo
lis convention as the stage setting, and an.
imaginary rusty knife blade as the deadly
weapon. Colonel Kowalsky, A. Ruef and
Tom O'Brien supplied the opera bouffe
part of the entertainment and hoarsely
sang their disappointment over the dis
agreeable and unexpected turn of the po
litical tide. Mr. Taylor of Alameda gave
a clever imitation of walking for the cake,
when he, at the suggestion of the chair
man, arose from his seat in the Alameda
delegation, followed by Ruef and the re
mainder of his colleagues, and marched
with a bold front out of the convention.
Joseph Spear of San Francisco made a
good second, but Mr. O'Brien took the
cake. He was too mad to eat it, however.
Mr. Spear's political acting is of the
florid or old Bowery style. The gergeous
ness of his McKinley banner yesterday
and the silence of the hurrahs he expected
to receive were of about the same degree
of intensity. The convention was wiliine
enough to cheer for McKinley, but it did
not see why it should cheer for Mr. Spear.
His acting to-day was not quite so florid.
It was rather of the subdued or intense
French school, where the actor does not
strike any attitudes, but walks along un
ostentatiously, as though going to see a
man between the acts. He walked out
after Mr. Taylor and Mr. O'Brien by the
left lower entrance and did not return, the
act being necessarily very brief.
The last desperate attack of Keilyism
was after the reading of the report of the
committee on credentials by Ruef and
others, but it fell short and died in the
jast ditch.
Three of the planks placed in the plat
form this morning had been and are ad
vocated very strongly by The Call,
namely the anti-funding resolution, the
plank on the free coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1 ana that on woman's suf
frage. It is the consensus of opinion here
to-day that The Call has achieved a great
victory.

Regularly Klected Delegates Bested

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.-owing
to the fact that the committees sat up
after midnight last night, and that the
committee on CTedentia!s did not con
clude its labors until after 4 o'clock this
.morning, the delegates were slow in
at the pavilion, and Chairman
Arthur's gavel did not rap for order until
half-past 10.
It was being buzzed about on the floor

Convention and Named as California's Representative on the

of the convention that George A. Knight,
a proxy from Butte, was to create a sensa
tion by leading a fight for an instructed
delegation, and that Taylor and Ruef
(proxy) of Alameda, were to make
speeches of protest against the report of
the committee on credentials, and that a
lively session would be the result.
The first mix-up occurred when the re
port of the committee on credentials was
read; but it did not last longâ just long
enough to enable the chairman to request
the Ruef-Taylor delegation to retire from
their seats to make way for the set of
delegates elected at the Alameda prim
aries.
The report of the committee was to the
following effect:
In favor of seating the delegates elected
at the Alameda County primaries.
Against the contestants in Sacramento
County and in favor of the delegates reg
ularly appointed by the County Central
Committee. This is regarded as a defeat
of the A. P. A. primary ticket.
In favor of the delegation in the Fourth
Congressional District elected at the
primaries held in that district April 15,
known as the County Committee delega
tion.
Against the contestants in the Forty
first Assembly District of the Fifth Con
gressional District and in favor of the reg
ular primaries delegation.
Against the contestants in the Thirty
seventh of the Fifth and in favor of the
regular primary delegates.
In the Thirty-third of the Fourth the
committee decided that the protest alleg
ing acts of fraud by the contestants was
clearly proved, and recommending that
delegates to all conventions should be
elected at primaries or caucuses regularly
called by the Central Committee or County
Committee, and that none but such should
be seated at any of the conventions here
after.
Taylor of Alameda was on his feet in a
moment, and excitedly demanded that the
report should be taken up seriatim.
The chair put the question and the noes
had it, but Ruef and Taylor demanded a
rollcall.
When Chairman Arthur announced that
he would grant the request for the call of
the roll Taylor clapped his hands and
shouted "Good boy!" with so much sten
torian earnestness that the convention
! was convulsed with merriment.
The vote stood 97 ayes to 477 noes, and a
motion was made to adopt the report as a
whole.
Taylor took the platform and made a
vigorous plea in behalf of the appointed.
He explained that these appointed dele
gates had been recognized by the State
Central Committee and the Third Con
gressional District Convention. In fact,
they had assembled and elected district
delegates to the National Convention.
They had chosen two delegates pledged to
William McKinley, "and now," said Mr.
Taylor, "you do not want the seats of
these McKinley delegates at St. Louis
contested."
Taylor waxed eloquent and animated.
He declared that the committee on cre
dentials had seated the appointed dele
gates from Sacramento, and then, by an

unheard of process of reasoning, had
ousted the appointed delegation of Ala
meda. He cried out: "Oh! consistency,
where is thy jewelry?" [Laughter.]
When the announcement was made a
dozen delegates shouted at once for the
chair's recognition.
H. I. Kowalsky, holding a Mendocino
proxy, came to the front with an ill-timed
speech, which aroused some resentment.
He began by saying:
"If this is a eag convention belonging to
one man I want to say something. I have
attended every Republican State Conven
tion in California since I became 21 years
of age. This time I came here as the
guest of Mendocino County. [Laughter.]
I do not want carpet-baggers to come here
and usurp the rights of others. There are
men on the Forty-third District roll of
delegates which the report proposes to
seat that were never heard of before. And
such a committee of credentials never
before existed. Talk of lead pipe cinches
and the Dutch Justice of the Peace who
refused to bear but one side of a case, and
you cannot get a marker to the committee
on credentials."
Kowalsky 's attack on the committee was
resented by delegates in many parts of the
house. "Time" was shouted and points
of order raised.
The chair ruled that Kowalsky could
not speak further without the consent of
the delegates, as there was no question be
fore the house.
Kowalsky was then suppressed.
An appointed delegate from Alameda
tried to speak, but Chairman Arthur ruled
that the primary delegates had been seated,
and, therefore, he could not be heard.
Meanwhile, the declared bona fide pri
mary delegates, who were standing in a
group hard by, were invited to come and
get their seats.
Reluctantly the displaced appointed
delegates arose "nd tiled out in the aisle,
Taylor leading the column. At the cen
tral gateway leading from the convention
circle down the broad passageway to the
main pavilion entrance the outgoing dele
gates were hailed and greeted by the
turned-down machine gang of the Fourth
Congressional District of San Francisco.
A gre^t uproar arose, which lasted for sev
eral minutes. Tom O'Brien, the clerk of
Campbell's court, with a far-away, deep
down and all-ni^ht-up voice, hurled epi
thets at the committee on credentials and
the convention. He shouted that the
delegates in their seats were the Mafia
and the banditti of California, who had
formed an A. P. A. council.
His parting roar was something like
"To hades with the A. P. A. and hurrah
for McKinley!"
O'Brien was at length compelled to move
on with the rest of the machine. Order
was then restored and the business of the
convention proceeded.
The reading of the report of the commit
tee on platform and resolutions by Frank
L. Coombs was attentively listened to and
greeted with applause. All the planks
were cheered, but the one on the free coin
age of silver evoked the greatest enthu
siasm.
Tha following is the platform in full :
The Republican party of the State of Cali
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
forma, In convention assembled, at Sacra
mento, on the sth day of May, 1896, hereby
adopt the following platform:
Resolved, That this convention favors the
proposed amendment to the constitution of .
the State of California whereby it is sought to
extend the elective franchise to all citizens of
the United States, both men and women.
That we indorse the course of Hon. George
C. Perkins in the United States Senate in be
half of the people of the State of California and
their varied interests.
WÂ« indorse the work of the National League
and the efforts of the young men of our party
to make it a potent factor in prosecuting a
vigorous and successful campaign in this State.
We favor the free and unlimited coinage of
silver at the ratio ot 16 to 1, and the making of
silver as well as gold a legal tender in pay
ment of ail debts, both public and private.
Realizing that good roads are a necessary
element in advancing the prosperity of any
community, and recognizing the practically
universal demand for the same, not only in
our State, but throughout the United States,
the Republican party of California pledges it
self to the enactment of legislation looking
toward improved and scientifically con
structed highways, on the most economical
basis.
We demand such National legislation on the
subject of foreign immigration" as will effectu
ally keep out of the country all contract labor
ers, criminals, paupers, diseased persons, and
the classes whose professions and teachings
are calculated to disturb social peace and
order, or are inimical to the best interests of
this country, and such changes in the natural
ization laws and their enforcement as will pre
vent unfit foreign-born person.? from becom
ing citizens of the Republic.
Our prisons and asylums contain many
people not citizens of the United States. We
believe that every nation should provide and
care for its owa demented and criminal
classes, and that all future treaties and con
ventions with other nations should provide
for sucn a reciprocal deportation of said
classes as would in time make each nation
care and provide for its own, and at its own
expense of deportation.
While we recognize the right to establish
schools through private enterprise, we de
mand that none but non-sectarian free public
schools shall receive public aid.
We heartily indorse the proposition that the
farmer of the nation, by whose labor the staple
agricultural products of the country are
brought to market, should receive a just
measure of protection for himself, his labor
and his products, inasmuch as the price
of these products is regulated by the
amount paid for them in the world's
market centers, less the cost of trans
portation from the place of production
to such centers, and as owing to the great de
velopment of staple agricultural products in
many of the cheapest labor countries of the
world the prices realized by our farmers have
of late been unremunerative, it is our duty to
endeavor to change this state of affairs. Hence
we approve of this plan that the Government
of the United States should reduce the cost of
transporting these staple agricultural products
from American seaports to foreign seaports
to the end that the prices of these prod
ucts should be advanced; and for that
purpose, inasmuch as an export can be pro
tected in no other manner, we pronounce our
selves in. favor cf the use of a limited portion
of the receipts of the United States customs for
such purpose and pledge out must earnest ef
forts to have this measure engrafted upon tho
laws of the land, to the end that the American
protective system shall benefit all classes of
the people, aid the farmer against the oppres
sive competition of the cheap labor
countries of the world, and by so doing
assist in maintaining that steady demand for
labor in manufacturing centers, so essential to
the labor of our country.
The Republican party of California is
pledged to such legislation as will thoroughly
protect the dairy interests and the public from
imposition in the sale of dairy products.
The mines of California, -with their annnal
output of many millions of dollars, have been
our financial bulwark in times of adversity;
they maintained the National credit during
the dark days of the rebellion, and they form
the basis upon which this grandest of com
monwealths, California, has been reared. The
mining industry of our State should receive
such aid and protection as will Insure its per
manence and prosperity, and for that pur
pose we favor such aid and protec
tion as will relieve the miner from
unnecessary burdens, enable him to
obtain and develop his mining
property, and will promote and encourage the
business of all kinds of raining, Including that
Known as "hydraulic mining," whenever and
wherever the same can be carried on without
injury to the other interests in the State.
We believe a revision of the tariff laws upon
the basis of the American protective system to
be the foremost of National legislation, and
have full confidence In the National Conven
tion soon to assemble to deal more fully with
this question. We condemn the policy of the
Democratic party for the last four years, re
sulting, as it has, in destroying every barrier
to American protection, and charge such
policy with the responsibility of degrading
labor and impoverishing every interest dear to
the American people.
We believe that we should adopt a system
calculated to give us the most protection in
weakness and strength, which exalts life and
promotes human happiness, and that such
system rests upon the basis of the American
protective tariff, as advocated by James Q.
Blame and William McKinley.
We commend the course of our delegates in
Congress in opposing the proposed funding
schemes of the Pacific railroad companies,
and demand that the companies be compelled
to settle their Indebtedness in some reasonable
and businesslike way, or that the Government
shall foreclose its claims upon and take
possession of the properties.
Resolved, That the Republicans of California,
while recognizing the eminent worth and fit
ness of each of the distinguished statesmen of
their party whose names have been mentioned
as aspirants for the Presidential nomination
at St. Louis, and while pledging in advance
the electoral vote of the Golden State to the
Republican nominee, whoever he may be,
hereby declare that the emphatic sentiment of
California is in favor of the nomination of that
wise and able statesman, that pure and unsul
lied patriot, that true and loyal American,
that peerless champion of protection, William
McKinley of Ohio, and the delegates from thia
State are hereby directed and instructed to
work and vote for the success of said William
McKinley as long as there Is a reasonable pros
pect of his nomination.
After the reading of the platform Prank
H. Short of Fresno addressed the conven
tion. Mr. Short is one of the owners o!
the Fresno Republican and a leading man
in his district. He began by saying that
it is sometimes as great a fault to omit
saying somp thing that should be said as to
say something that should not be said.
The resolution which he was about to
offer he desired not to be construed as any
reflection upon the committee on plat
form. He added:
'â¢The question is whether this convention
shall voice the well nigh unanimous sen
timent of the Republicans and the rest of
the people of this State and indorse the
action of their representatives in Con
gress or whether they will not. I pre
sent this believing that it will receive the
unanimous indorsement of this conven
tion."
Mr. Short then read a resolution com*
mending the course of our delegates in
Congress in opposing ihe proposed funding2
system of the Central Pacific Railroad and
expressing the sense of the convention
that the railroad companies be compelled
to settle their indebtedness in some reason
able and businesslike way, and that the
Government should foreclose its lien upon
them and take possession of the roads.
He asked whether there was anything in
that that was wrong or that was not ex
pressive of the will of the people of the
State of California.
Judge George A. Nourse of Fresno sec
ended the resolution. He said that the
people were not willing to put themselves
for the next fifty or one hundred years
into the hands of the railroad corporation.
Dr. Pardee of Alameda followed Judge
Nourse in an earnest speech. He said tftat
if there ever was a time when a Republican
convention snould speak to the people for
California now was the time.
"We are in favor of the railroad com
pany paying its just debts," he said, "upon
maturity, dollar for dollar, interest and
principal. Therefore it would be a polit
ical, commercial and moral mistake should
this convention refuse to indorse the sen
timent of the people of this State upon
the funding bill. I second the amend
ment."
Mr. Short's resolution was carried with
a shout, there being a few noes from the
lobby near the southeast corner of the
hall."
George A. Knieht of Butte. ignoring the
fact that the McKinley piank in the plat
form instructed the delegates to vote for
and use their best endeavors to secure the
nomination of McKinley, ascended the
platform and in a rather nourishing man
ner announced that he had a substitute to
offer. Then he said that the only thing
he feared was that the supporters of Me-
Kinicy back East might think that the
Republicans of California had cold feet and
did not like him. He remembered how
at Minneapolis in 1892 the supporters of
that grand old man, James G. Blame,
bowed their heads in shame when nine
Californians drove a rusty knife blade into
his heart.
This remark of the gentleman from
Butte, passionately made, was greeted
with considerable hissing and groaning.
He thereupon came to a sudden stop and
read his resolution, which resolved that
the Republicans of California, while
recognizing the eminent worth and
fitness of each of the distinguished
statesmen of the party whose names
have been mentioned as aspirants for
the Presidential nomination at St. Louis,
ani while pledging him in advance
the electoral vote of this State, declare
that the emphatic sentiment of the
people of California is in favor of the
nomination of that wise and able states
man, "William McKtnley of America, and
the delegates from this State are hereby
irect ed and instructed to work and vote
for the success of McKinley as long as
there is a reasonable prospect of his nom
ination.
Many of the delegates laughed at the
dramatic way in which Mr. Knight read
this resolution, which, although turgid
and verbose,, was not one whit stronger
than the plank on the same subject al
ready in the platform. It was apparent
that the colonel from Butte had written
the resolution before he knew what was
going to be put in the platform, or else
that he desired to entrap some of his po
litical enemies into a declaration that
the existing plank covered the case, in
which event, it was believed, he would
charge the objector with bein; opposed to
the nomination of McKinley.
But if such were his object, it was deftly
foiled, and the convention quickly saw
that such was the case when Colonel E. F.
Preston made for the platform almost be
fore Mr. Knight had stepped off it. Colonel
Preston was greeted with cheers, not from
a few delegations but from all parts of the
house. He said that the convention nad
just listened to worda of thrilling elo
quence from one of the leading standard
bearers of the Republican party, and there
was nothing that Mr. Knight could say
about that grand apostle of protection,
James G. Blame, before which the head of
every Republican would not most rever
ently bow. This remark was cheered
lustily.
"There is no Republican who reads the
handwriting on the wall," added Colonel
Preston, "and who is abreast of the cur
rent of the times, who does not feel and
know that upon the shoulders of William
McKinley has fallen the mantle of the
great James G. Biaine. He ia to-day, par
excellence, the exponent of those great
principles whicn are so dear to every Re
publican heart and which we regard not
only as the shibboleth of our party but as
essential to the success of every industrial
interest of the United States."
"No Republican," continned Colonel
Preston, "no man who believes in lighting
the furnaces; no man who wants to hear
the whirr of the wheel and the clang of
the hammer; no one would hesitate to
support McKinley for President of the
United States. As a lifelong Republican,
training with Republicans, marching un
der the banner of Republicans, believing
in Republican doctrines, I rise to second
trie amendment of Mr. Knight."
This speech brought forth a burst of
hearty cheering. It was hailed as a fit
ting reply to the false rumors that had
been circulated to the effect that John D.
Spreckels would not pledge himself to sup
port McKinley.
Senator Spencer of Lassen, who will be
remembered as the stalwart champion of
the woman-suffrage amendment at the last
session of the Legislature, made his way
to the platform with an expression of
countenance betokening considerable agi
tation and indignation, and when he faced
the convention his fierce glance in the di
rection of the seat occupied by Mr. Knight
of Butte County was interpreted to signify
a declaration of war.
In tones vibrating with anger he said
that he Â«vas one of the nine Californians
who voted for the nomination of Benja
min Harrison for President of the United
States, and he could not sit in the conven
tion and listen to the charge made by Mr.
Knight that he and his eight colleagues
had thrust a rusty knife into the political
heart of James G. Blameâa roan whom
he loved better than any other man in the
world. Then, warming with nis subject,
the eloquent Senator added, "Permit me
to answer the slang that is hurled at the
nine men who were true to their pledges
at Minneapolis."
He explained that an attempt nad been
made at that time to pass a resolution
pledging the delegation to vote for Blame,
and he had said that if the convention
thought that he (Spencer) could not obey
its will without being tied to it the con
vention should not have sent him to Min
neapolis. He attended a caucus in which
512 delegates had said that they were un
alterably and positively in favor of Ben
Harrison for the Presidency. He went to
the other men of California and said to
them: "Gentlemen, don't you see that
Mr. Blame cannot receive the nomination
at the hands of the convention? I love
that old patriot and statesman more than
any of you do, but in the name of all that
is good don't drag him out here to be
butchered before a Republican conven
tion."
"They brought him out there," con
tinued Senator Spencer, "And set him up
TIIOMAS O'BRIEN ENERGETICALLY DENOUNCING THE CONVENTION ON BEHALF OF THE KELLY-RAINEY CROWD.
before the people. They shouted and
hurrahed for him and then voted for some
one else.
"Who was it that thrust a rusty knife
into James G. Blame and butchered him
before the people?" demanded the speaker
in ringing tones.
'â¢Who was it? My hands are clean, my
conscience is clear. You cannot instruct
a man if he is not already instructed by
the will of this convention."
The chair put the motion on Knight's
amendment and it was carried by accla
mation.
After this more or less thrilling episode
there was a funny one. Cutter of Yuba
furnished it. Cutter was very savage dur
ing the last session of the Legislature in
his attacks upon the woman suffrage
proposition and the old sore broke out
again to-day. He got upon the platform,
and in a manner, the excitability of which
seemed altogether unwarranted by the
sweet and gentle nature of the subject, de
clared that he did not think it wise that
the Republican party of this Sate should
force upon the women of the State a con
stitutional amendment and a privilege lor
which the majority had not asked and did
not want.
The gentleman from Yuba was getting
well into his theme when he was inter
rupted by derisive lausjhter and cries of
"order, 1 from every direction.
Miss Anna Shaw, D.D., Mrs. Neliie Hol
brook-Blinn and other prominent repre
sentatives of the woman suffrage move
ment seemed to be as much amused as
anybody else.
The chair reminded Mr. Cutter that he
had been allowed to speak only by cour
tesy, whereupon that gentleman declared
that, being obliged to vote for the plat
form as a whole, he desired to be placed
on record as voting against the woman
suffrage plank. He added that he would
vote against the amendment if the wife of
his bosom desired him to do so.
These episodes, the one savage and the
other humorous, opened the way for the
nomination of delegates-at-large to the
National Convention at St. Louis. The
first to open the ball was I. B. Dudley of
San Diego. He felt it an honor, he said,
to place in nomination the name of a rep
resentative citizen of Southern California,
one whose home upon the hills overlooks
the bay beside the silver gate, a man
whose means have been expended gener
ously in building up a metropolis and in
developing a splendid system of irrigation.
He was to name a man of lofty ideals, free
from self-seeking aggrandizement or
ostentatious display. In every part of the
Golden State, added the speaker, wher
ever the name of the hero of Appomattox
was revered there also would be honored
the worthy son of Ulysses S. Grant.
The nomination of U. S. Grant, he
added, would record the return of the
great Republican doctrine of protection to
American industry. He had no doubt
that as a delegate to the National Conven
tion young Grant would confer great
luster and prestige upon the fair name of
California, and would awaken the enthu
siasm of the loyal in the National Con
vention in St. Louis.
Senator Simpson of Los Angeles fol
lowed and proposed the name of Lionel
A. Sheldon of Los Angeles. The Senator
expressed his pride that Los Angeles
had a citizen whom she loved to honor,
and he named General Lionel A. Sheldon.
Senator Spencer of Lassen spoke for the
northern part of the State and presented
the name of Senator J. M. Gleaves of
Shasta.
Colonel Preston of San Mateo was re
ceived with cheers when he arose to pre
sent the name of John D. Spreckels of
San Francisco. In gracefully- worded
language he said that the name of
Spreckels was identified with the great in
dustrial enterprise which foreshadowed
the industrial prosperity of the State, a
name which has done service in the coun
cils of the Republican party, a name
synonymous with honesty, fearlessness
and loyalty.
"The name of Spreckels," continued the
speaker, "means loyalty."
Herb Colonel Preston was interrupted
by an outburst of applause, and after it
had subsided, he proceeded, "The name of
Spreckels means fearlessness, it means
Republicanism, it means Californianism
for Californians."
The nomination was received with
j cheering.

N. A. Mncquarrie of San Joaqnin named.
ex-Congressman James A. Louttit, and
spoke of him as a man whose loyalty to
California had never been questioned and
whose record while a member of Congress
stood second to none, and who was a
loyal follower of McKinley.

for loyalty and Republicanism.
Cutter of Yuba placed David E. Knight
of the Marysville Woolen Mills in nomina
tion Martin Stevens of San Francisco
nominated Irving M. Scott. Davie of Ala
meda seconded the nomination of George
A. Knight.
Judge Nourse of Fresno seconded the
nomination of John D. Spreckels, and
mentioned him as a square business man,
a stanch Republican and one of those men
who had done a vast deal in developing
the material resources and the vast in
terests of the State.
Arthur Levinsky of San Joaquin made
a brief speech in seconding the nomina
tion of Irving M. Scott.
Wild applause greeted the app arance
of General Barnes on the platform, many
rising in their enthusiasm tc cheer him.
He spoke as follows:
"There is not a State in this Union
which will cast a majority for the nominee
of the St. Louis convention which would
not be proud if it could send among the
list of the delegates Ulysses S. Grant.
[Applause.] Fome of the gentlemen who
have addressed you have sa; 1 we have no
need 10 look at the past, our eyes must be
upon the luture. I don't agree with them.
There are subjects of thought that will
live in the future and that few cast their
bright and beautiful light down through
all the centuries until the very world itself
shall end and that li^hl and glory shall
stream all through the ages, I believe,
through those of eternity. Was that great
man and soldier, upon whose deeds we
have hung with tender and anxious care,
to be forgotten?''
Then with eloquent fervor he brought
most vividly to the minds of his hearers
the iilu-trious career of him who during
the war was the first general.
"I see Grant before me now. I see him
at the battle of Belmont. I see him at the
capture of Fort Henry and of Fort Donel
son. I see him in combat at the battle of
luka. I see him in the desperate struggle
at Corinth. I see him at the siege and cap
ture of Vicksburg. I see him fighting above
the clouds in the battles of Missionary
Ridge and Lookout Mountain. 1 see him
in the bloody forty-one days of battle from
the Wilderness to Cold Harbor. Then I see
him in Virginia forcing the enemy back
John C. Lynch of "San Bernardino, Nominated for Lieutenant-Governor
j from its own intrenchments and see him
I triumphantly entering Richmond. Then
! I behold him at Apponiattox making a
treaty of peace with the thoroughly de
feated enemies and giving terms such as
were never before seen on a like occasion
and will probably never be seen again.
This man has a son, a resident of your
State, who aspires to go to St. Louis, and
I want this younc; man who has taken up
his abode with \is to be treated as is the
son of that illustrious man who was our
I President during this period of conflict. I
! want him treated as was the son of Abra
ham Lincoln by the people of his State.
We can in this not only honor one who
bears the name of his father whom we
all revere and honor, but one who also
i bears the very given name of Ulysses S.
Grant. I want him treated thus for his
father's name; and that father to whom
we all owe so great a debt of gratitude will
look down from his place in heaven, and
even to him upon the battlements above
the scene will be viewed with deepest and
purest joy. Let's send him."
Great applause followed, and the elo
quent speaker was congratulated on all
sides when the morning session came to a
close. It is generally conceded to be the
great speech, brief asat was, of the con
vention.
Short of Fresno also seconded Grant's
nomination in a few well-chosen words.
Senator Simpson of Los Angeles took
the Uoor and raised a wave of murmurs of
surprise by stating that on the part of the
south he seconded the nomination of Sen
ator Gleaves. Adjournment was taken
until 2 p. m.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.â lt was
2:30 p. m. when the gavel rapped for the
resumption of business. Watson Green of
San Joaquin in an eloquent manner sec
onded the nomination of James A. Lout
tit, who he said was the only man men
tioned from the great central portion of
the Statt, and a man who represented the
great and fertile San Joaquin Valley.
Then came the rollcall for the ballot on
delegates.
Alameda was first on the list, but the
chairman of the delegation asked for fur
ther time, as lhe members had not yet
agreed upon their preferences. This
caused some delay. Finally Alameda de
clared itself in readiness to go on record.
Just as the chairman, however, was about
to announce the result one of the delega
tion asked that the delegation be polled.
There being no dissent the request was
granted. This was the only county that
did not do its voting through its chairman.

When Mr. Spreckels, who was ttie first
to pass the winning mark, had enough
votes to his credit to elect him there were
cheers and applause, and at frequent in
tervals the announcement of the solid vote
of some county for Mr. Spreckels or one
of the other favorites elicted applause, and
when the announcement of the figures of
the ballot was made by Secretary Ryan
the applause was most enthusiastic and
was repeated as thfl name of each success
ful delegate was given to the convention.
As will be seen from the table of the bal
lot, Alameda gave all four of the success
ful candidates a good start and paid
Spreckels the honor of a solid vote, this
gentleman being the only one so distin
guished.
Placer's nine delegates had the distinc
tion of distributing their favors to every
candidate before the convention.
San Francisco's entire strength went to
Spreckels without a break, Grant, Shel
don and George A. Knijsht, however, get
ting a goodly portion of it.
Santa Clara exhibited its loyalty to the
memory of Grant by going in a body to
his son. It paid a similar compliment to
Spreckels.
All the northern counties, of course, went
to Gleaves.
But the most extraordinary fact shown
in the table is that Spreckels received 565
votes out of the total of 645 cast, and thus
lacked but seventy votes of receiving the
unanimous indorsement of the convention.
There were cries of "Knight" from vari
ous parts of the house, and that gentleman
promptly responded and addressed the
convention. He created a laugh by de
claring in his very first few words that he
knew it would be all right, and then as an
apology for some indiscreet words he had
used on the day preceding, he said :
''Republicans sometimes do a little bit
of talking, but they don't mean everything
they say on an occasion of this kind. It
affords me a great deal of pleasure that
the Republican sentiment is not ft myth.
It will do me more good to say to the peo
ple of the Eost that California has not
forgotten those who made the Republican
party what it is to-day and < ied that the
Republican party might live."
This reference to the compliment paid
U. S. Grant in choosing him to represent
the State at St. Louis evoked applause, for
which a pause had been conveniently
made by the orator. Then continuing he
said :
"We may well feel proud that we have
honored the name of U. S. Grant. Those
of us who are elected may speak for our
selves, but if there is anything in Repub
licanism, if there is anything in the Re
publican party of this Nation, it ought to
be accredited to this great State of Cali
fornia. It has shown itself not unmindful
of what it owes to the great man who is
now dead. The Republicans never before
were in better fighting trim than now;
never before have we gone before the peo
ple with such a united front and oue that
is to bring peace and prosperity to Ameri
can homes. I say to you that when Igo
to St. Louis together with the others who
have Dcen honored with this great distinc
tion we will act for unity, for the best in
terests of the Republican party ; and I say
that it will be for the best interests of the
people of this great commonwealth."
Then referring to the campaign, he said:
"And when the fight is over there will be
no six hundred and sixty-six million in
jury done to the livestock interests of the
country, nor will there be ten millions
pocketed by the Morgan syndicate at the
expense of the poor. Protection will be
our warcry and we will be a united and
happy people under the banner of the
free."
Calls for Mr. Spreckels were many and
strong and that gentleman came modestly
and gracefully forward. As he ascended
the platform cheers, hand-clapping and
stamping rent the air, hats were waved
and the greatest enthusiasm that had yet
been exhibited in the convention blazed
forth. His words were few, but to the
point. He said:
"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention: Doubtless you are well aware
that lam not a speech-maker. lam a Re
publican and will work for the best inter
ests of that party. I know what your in
structions have been, and it will be my
aim to carry out the wishes of the people
of California." [Applause long con
tinued.]
When order was restored Chairman
Arthur read from an interview with U. S.
Grant, published in the Los Aneeles
Times of May 5, just before his departure
for the East. In this the San Diego dele
gate to St. Louis expressed his admiration
for and intention of supporting McKinley
and protection. Applause followed the
reading.
The election of alternates was then de
clared in order. A motion was made to
elect the defeated candidates for delegates
at large by acclamation as alternates. Bat
before the motion could be put Cyrus
Jones of Ban Jose and George Stone of San
Francisco, president of the Union League,
were placed in nomination. This was,
however, declared out of order and the
motion was about to be put when Judge
Dibble announced that Mr. Scott had de
clared his willingness to withdraw in favor
of Mr. Stone. The original motion was
amended to cover this change and was
then adopted as amended.
Nominations for Presidential Electors
were declared in order.
Cutter of Yuba too* the platform and
epoke as follows :
"I have had the pleasure of presenting
the name of one gentleman for an honor
withiu the gift of this convention whom
the majority saw fit not to indorse. lam
now going to present the name of a man
for whom every man will gladly vote. He
is a native son of this State and an honor
to the order of that name. He is a gentle*
man born in this city."
At this point the assemblage showed a
â¢estive disposition, and soon there was â¢
rail of "Name your mar. and cut it short."
rhis had Us desired effect, and Mr. Cutter
:ame right down to business by saying,
'I name for the position Colonel Charles
F. Crocker of San Francisco." On motion
further nomination speeches were dis
pensed with.
W. P. Harrington of Colusa and Irvin g
M. Scott of San Francisco were the only
others nominated.
Harrington was withdrawn and Crocker
md Scott were elected by acclamation.
Chairman Arthur next asked for nomi
nation for Lieutenant-Governor. Judge
Spencer piaced John C. Lynch, Speaker of
the Assembly, in nomination, and he was
sleeted by acclamation.
A resolution was adopted authorizing
the executive committee of the Republi
can State Central Committee to appoint
the finance committee as required by the
purity of elections law.
The convention then proceeded through
the respective Assembly delegations to
name members of the Republican State
Central Committee. The following were

them. His daughter bad to read the papers
to him in the evening. His face was sal-
low and jaundiced. His system seemed
all out of order. - Being given a small sam-

effect was on the bowels. He then bought
a bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
and began taking the medicine regularly.
After using half a bottle be noticed his
face was not quite so sallow as it was, and
that he could walk longer with small sense
of fatigue. He continued to use the re-

REGARDS IT A TRIUMPH.
Mr. Sprockets Expresses His Pleasure
Over the Result of the Conven
tion's Work.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.â John D.
Spreckels was called upon this evening in
his room at the Golden Eagle Hotel and
asked by a Call representative to give his
views on the situation. With considerable
reluctance he consented and spoke as fol
lows:
"I cannot conceal a feeling of pleasure
over the result of the convention's work. I
regard it as a triumph all along the line.
My purposes and objects were known to
my friends for months vast and in time
became known to the delegates throughout
. the State.
"The great vote cast for me would seem
to indicate that the people of the State
understand and approve my position. I
am a Republicanâ a plain Republican â
and as I said this afternoon not a speech
maker. I believe in Republican principles
and hope and shall work for the success of
the Republican party. As a delegate to
the National Convention I shall. do the ut
most in my ability to carry out the wishes
of the Republicans of my State as ex
pressed in their platform.
"The results of the convention are to me
most gratifying. The convention was
made up of free, independent, thoughtful,
earnest men. California, I am sure, will
cast her electoral vote for the Republican
nominee. I have only to add that I thank
my friends throughout the State for their
support and encouragement."
MEETING OF DELEGATES.
John D. Sprockets Elected as Califor
nia's Representative on the Xational
Republican Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.â ln the
Golden Eagle Hotel to-ni^ht -there was an
important meeting of the delegates, dis
trict and at large, elected to represent
California in the Republican National
Convention at St. Louis.
Organization was effected by the election
of Hervey Lindley of I^os Angeles as
chairman of the delegation, A. B. Lem
mon of Santa Rosa as secretary and Frank
D. Ryan of Sacramento as assistant
secretary.
Then S. M. Shortridge nominated John
D. SprecKels to be California's representa
tive on the Republican National Com
mittee, to succeed M. H. de Young, and
the honor was unanimously conferred on
the gentleman amid great enthusiasm.
The next order of business was the ap
pointment of a committee on transporta
tion, which was made to consist of J. D.
hpreckels, O. A. Hale and Dan T. Cole.
This committee will taKe charge of ail
arrangements for the trip of the delegation
to St. Louis, having been empowered to
look after every detail, and in connection
with which matter they were given carte
blanche.
It is understood that the committee will
provide a special train to carry the dele
gates and alternates and their families and
friends to St. Louis, leaving San Francisco
on the 10th of June.
A. B. Lemmon was elected treasurer,
and will receive and dispense all moneys
in connection with the journeyings of the
delegation.
This new distinction gained by Mr.
Spreckels is generally viewed as another
laurel â wreath placed on his brow for his
aid in securing so thorough a victory in
behalf of pure politics against the corrupt
and powerful adverse element that has
been in power so long that it considered
its intrenchments impassable.
IN THE FOURTH DISTRICT.
; Samuel M. Shortridge and TV. W
: ;â  Montague fleeted Delegates to
the National Convention.
'â¢ SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.âChair
man J. M. Chretien called the Fourth
Congressional District convention to order
in the Senate chamber at 1:45 p. M., and
announced that the meeting was for the
purpose of electing two delegates to the
Ft Louis convention and two alternates,
and such other business as the convention
might decide to take up.
Thomas D. Riordan in a very orief speech
placed in nomination Samuel M. Short
ridge, and C. F. Curry performed the same
service for W. W. Montague. Both were
elected by acclamation.
Thomas D. Riordan and D. K. McMur
ray were then elected alternates by ac
clamation, and adjournment was taken
subject to the call of the chair.
TO UNDO CROOKEDNESS.
Organization of a Genuine Convention
in the Third Congressional
District.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., May 6.â The ac
knowledgment of the State Convention
that forty delegates elected by the prima
ries were the real' representatives of Ala
meda County changes the whole front of
the situation in the Third Congressional
District.
The election of Eli S. Denison of Oak
land and A. Hockheimer of Willows to
the National Convention will be set aside
in all probability. Perhaps Mr. Hock
heimer will be one of the delegates elected
by the genuine convention.
The Alaraeda delegation constitutes a
majority of the Third District Congres
sional Convention and will not abide by
tne move which was done yesterday in the
spurious convention over which Geary of
Contra Costa presided.
The rawest work ever done in California
politics was done in that convention when
Chairman Geary applied the gag law
to George Davis and would not even enter
tain a protest aeainst delegates voting on
questions where their own seats were in
volved.
Immediately after the recess of the State
Convention to-day the new and genuine
Third Congressional District Convention
met and organized by the election of Dr.
Pardee as chairman and Mr. Laidlaw as
secretary.
Judge Davis said the question to consider
now was the extent of the power which
the convention should exercise. Its com
plete authority had been recognized. He
remarked that if other delegates to the
National Convention that Denison and
Hockheimer were chosen the local fight in
Alameda County would be transferred to
tit. Louis.
Delegates Parker, Knickerbocker, Wil
liam Schmidt, Babcock, Farnham, Bel
shaw, Geary, Klein, Pierce, Freud, Ander
son and others discussed the question
whether the delegates should organize
themselves into a Congressional District
Convention. It was asserted that the elec
tion of primary delegates was a movement
of reform sustained by 12,000 Republican
â voters of Alameda, and the delegates
would be unworthy of their confidence if
they did not do all the work which they
were elected to perform.
The point was raised that no call had
been issued for the meeting of the conven
tion.
It was explained further that the spuri
ous convention had adjourned sine die,
and its action could not be reconsidered.
A motion was finally adopted to organ
ize a new convention. The temporary
officers were then made permanent
officers.
Dr. Pardee, the chaiaman, then, on
motion of the meeting, after hearing
delegates from Solano and Contra Costa
counties, appointed as a committee on
order of business, organization and reso
lutions, the following: Farnham, Irving,
Belshaw, Anderson and Jones.
The convention then took a recess until
the first adjournment of the State Con
vention.
This afternoon the members of the Third
Congressional District convened in the pa
vilion and the names of C. M. Belshaw of
Contra Costa and W.B.Parker of Vacaville
were proposed as delegates to the Natfonal
Convention ; they were elected by a unani
mous vote, Judge A. J. Buckles of Solano
and William Ash of Colusa being chosen
aÂ» alternates. H. A. Powell of Oakland
was unanimously elected as Presidential
elector. The delegation then proceeded
to select a Congressional committee, to
consist of one member from each Assem
bly district of Alameda and one from each
county in the district.
Those from Alameda are E. K. Strow
bridge in the Forty-fourth, E. A. yon
Schmidt of the Forty-seventh, H. A.
Powell in the Forty -eighth, J. A. Sands in
the Forty-ninth, Guy C. Earl in the
Fiftieth, and Robert Edgar in the Fifty
first.
Contra Costa County will be represented
by E. I. Hutchinson, Solano by F. P.
Wineman, Lake by Philo Ogden, Glenn by
George D. Dudley, Colusa by E. W. Jones
and Yolo by C. I. Richmond. A resolu
tion was adopted declaring in favor in the
selection of delegates to the State Conven
tion by primaries and caucuses.
SUTRO IS TOO LATE.
Bat Nevertheless the Anti-Funding
Plank Was Inserted In the
Platform.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 4.â Mayor
Sutro came up on this morning's train to
give his entire time and attention to the
matter of securing an anti-funding plank
in the platform of the convention, but the
Southern Pacific's train was not speedy
enough to bring him here in time to use
his influence in this creditable cause. He
came to the convention pavilion, however,
and enjoyed the fag end of the proceed
ings with a pleasant and self-satisfied smile
on his countenance. He occupied a seat
with the members of the staffs of the vari
ous City newspapers, just in front of the
platform.
When asked what he thought of the ac
tion of the convention on the railroad
question he said be was perfectly satisfied
with the plank, and then continued:
"Well, you know it is the unanimous sen
timent of the people of the State, and in
deference to this sentiment the conven
tion could do no less than it did. lam
glad that the Republican party has stood
by the people so well."
JOY AND HIGH JINKS.
Ulad Shouts of Delegates and Others
Who Celebrate the Outcome of
the Convention.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.â The
streets of Sacramento rang to-night with
glad shouts of delegates and others cele
brating the outcome of the convention.
The McKinley League rooms were the
stage for a grand high jinks, where con
gratulations were extended to the Repub
licans on the happy outcome of the con
vention.
Major W. A. Anderson presided over
the festive gathering with his usual
unctuous bonhommie and his corusca
tions of wit were almost Hibernian in their
brilliancy. It was an olla podrida of mu
sic, song, patriotism and humor. The
music was furnished by the mandolin
club. Governor Budd was present as an
invited guest and made a speech of bo
hemian flavor.
The Call was toasted, and the toast was
responded to by John Paul Cosgrove of
The Call staff.
Samuel M. Shortridge had a mascot dur
ing the convention named Herbert Nobie.
Herbert is a colored boy 12 yeara old. He
was discovered by a Call reporter and in
troduced to Mr. Shortridge and ever after,
like Mary and the spring lamb, wherever
Samuel went the mascot was sure to go.
Chairman Arthur was complimented by
the delegates at the close of the conven
tion on the able manner in which he bad
presided over the deliberations of that
body. For a young man Mr. Arthur ac
quitted himself with the presence of mind
of a veteran.
GRANT FOR McKINLEY.
The Popular Delegate-at-Large Is
Now on His AY ay to the
East.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 6.â After
John D. Spreckels and George A. Knight
addressed the convention there were re
peated calls for U. S. Grant Jr. Chairman
Arthur announced that Mr. Grant was
on his way East, but in passing through
Los Angeles last Monday was interviewed
by the Times. To the representative of
the Times Mr. Grant said :
"It seems to me it is not possible that
McKinley should be defeated. lam not a
politician myself, but everything seems to
point to hib nomination on the first ballot.
As a fact the Republican party is well sup
plied with good men. There is no lack of
pood Presidential timber, but McKinle7 is
the best of them all."
RETURNING SCENES.
Cheers for William McKinley, John D.
Spreckels and George A.
Knight.
In the hnrry to reach the depot from the
Pavilion a lone line ol carriages filled with
delegates was soon in motion. The crowd
at the depot was immense. When the first
section of the train was ready to pull out
more than a hundred delegates and spec
tators were in line awaiting a turn to pur
chase a ticket. As the gong sounded to
indicate that the train would go in five
minutes many broke from the line and
boarded the cars, preferring to sacrifice
the special excursion discomfort rather
take the chance of getting left.
The conductor rallied the deserters by
telling them that a second section of the
same train would go in a few minutes.
Among the passengers on the first sec
tion were Eli Denison. Stephen Gage,
Geprge De Golia, George Stone, If, R.
Higgins. L. E. Mother, H. C. Dibble, D.
W. Hitchcock, W. D. Sanborn, Cornelius
O'Connor, J. F. Sheehan, Samuel Thorn
ton, Paris Kilburn, A. J. Martin and quite
a number of the appointed Alameda dele
gates of the Third Congressional District.
Eli Denison was consoled by his friends
and supporters who told him that he would
be seated at St. Louis.
The railroad people took the exclusion
of the appointed Alameda delegate very
much to heart. Hopes were expressed,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
however, that the dissension in the ranks
of Alameda Republicans may be healed
before the time comes to nominate a Con
gressman.
Eli Denison did not say much about his
future course. He simply remarked: "If
I conclude to go to St. Louis you may
wager that I will be seated."
The train did not make a stop between
Port Costa and Sixteenth street, Oakland.
The speed attained was very much beyond
the ordinary.
The boat that brought the main body of
delegates and spectators to San Francisco
was well crowded. Just before landing on
this side the vast crowd forward on the
boat cheered and cheered for William Mc-
Kinley, John D. Spreckeis and George A.
Knight. The cheering began by some one
proposing three cheers for William Mc-
Kinley. They were given with a great
shout. Then there was a call for "three
cheers for John D, Spreckels," which was
responded to with great enthusiasm.
Then some one proposed "three cheers for
George A. Knight," and the eloquent ora
tor was cheered.
John D. Spreckels' brief speech in the
convention was the topic of much admir
ing comment. The simple and direct
manner in which he said that he under
stood the desires of the convention was all
the assurance that the most ardent sup
porters of McKinley desired. It was ac
knowledged by many leading Republicans
that Mr. Spreckels had gained immensely
in personal popularity by the manner in
which he conducted the contest at Sacra
mento.
WILL GO TO ST. LOUIS.
The Kelly-Mahoney "Fash" Has De
clared Its Intention of Keeping Up
the Hopeless Fight.
A portion of the distrusted, disgruntled
and altogether disorganized Kelly-Ma
honey combination straggled into the
Baldwin last evening and hurried to their
rooms in the ones headquarters to escape
the reproachful looks of the horde of stut
ters who bad not been able to raise the
price of the trip to Bacramento.
Kelly and Mahoney were not with the
"push," and it is said that they may not
come home even to-day, but wiil remain
awny until the atmosphere clears a little.
The suave and oleagenous Kowalsky
headed the ranks of the routed renegades,
but he had lost the conquering-hero-comes
look that he carried to Sacramento, and
he turned the '"dead eye" on most of
those who came to otter blasphemous
words of consolation.
Indeed the colonel's answers were
couched in language entirely unfit for pub
lication, and when he was invited intothe
billiard room to tell the awful tale of de
feat to a select coterie, the air about the
party became absolutely blue.
Expurgated, his story was to the effect
that the Kelly-Mahoney gang does not
intend to give up without a further strug
gle, and that the fight, if such it can be
called, will be carried to St. Louis and
even on the floor of the National Con
vention.
Before the "push" separated in Sacra
mento it was partially decided that Kow
alsky, 6pear, Sontagg and E. J. Baldwin
will go to St. Louis and try there to get
recognition for the stuffers of the Fourth
District.
Kowaisky's manner indicated that he
thought the struggle a hopeless one, and
his hearers were not wildly enthusiastic,
though they murmured words intended to
cheer the defeated warrior.
Among other rumors which have been
received from Sacramento is one to the
effect that several active members of the
"push" are stranded and cannot get home.
Indeed, it is even hinted that Kelly and
Mahoney have refused to help their fol
lowers out of the distressing situation.
O'BRIEN'S LOUD ROAR.
Figures in a Series of Disorderly Scenes
From Sacramento to
the Bay.
T. B. O'Brien, the roaring clerk of Judge
Campbell's police court, was the central
figure in asuccessionof discreditable scenes
from the convention pavilion at Sacra
mento to the San Francisco ferry depot.
He could be arrested for disturbing the
peace in every county from the Capitol to
the Bay.
when the "push" delegation from the
Fourth Congressional District saw the last
hope of recognition vanish in the conven
tion, O'Brien raved and roared until he
was pulled away from the pavilion by his
friends.
At the Golden Eagle Hotel he showered
epithets on everybody within hearing of
his roar. Leon Dennery interposed to
silence the enraged clerk and a fistic en
counter was only prevented by the inter
ference of outsiders.
POLITICS IN THE EAST.
Indiana Republicans Indifferent
as to Instructing Delegates
at Large.
Ex-President Harrison Accepts an
Invitation to Address the
State Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., May 6.-On the
eve of the Republican Btate Convention
the question of whether or not the dele
gntes at large shall be instructed for Mc-
Kinley is somewhat in doubt, largety be
cause it seems to be a matter of indiffer
ence with the delegates. Left to them
selves, they would probably instruct, and
Chairman Gowdy of the State Committee
is doing what he can to have the instruc
tions put through, yet leading Republi
cans talk against it on the ground that
McKinley is safe anyhow, and there is no
use of stirring up bad feeling in the State
by forcing through instructions.
This evening the committee on rules
and permanent organization of the con
vention sent a sub-committee to General
Harrison's home with an invitation to ad
dress the convention, and this invitation
was accepted.
What effect his presence and talk will
have upon the proposition to instruct is
problematical. General Hairison received
numerous callers at his home, and almost
without exception they begged him to at
tend the convention and address it.
Two McKinley conferences of delegates
were held to-day, one this morning "to feel
the pulse" and one at 4 o'clock this after
noon to "make a count of noses" and check
up how the delegates in each county stood.
This could not be done very thoroughly,
for only about two^hirds of the counties
were represented. Wkey did, however, ap
point a committee from each district to ar
range to capture the committee on resolu
tions at the district meetings to-night.
A committee composed of J. B. Kenner
and Frank M. Dice of Grawfordsville was
apported to prepare the resolutions of in
structions. This they did and it was ap
proved by the afternoon meeting in the
following form :
We believe in a revenue system that will
realize sufficient money to defray the ezpens
of the Government.
We also favor the protective tariff system
which, while it produces the necessary reve
nues of the Government, at the same time pro
tects and fosters the laborer and manufacturer
and agriculturist of America against the cheap
and underpaid labor of Europe.
The man who prominently represents this
system of revenue is the Hon. William McEin
ley of Ohio. We, therefore, direct the dele
gates-at-large selected by this convention to
cast their votes for him in the St. Louis con
vention for the office of President of the United
States as long as there is a reasonable hope for
his nomination.
it was agreed that If the committee on
resolutions couid be captured this should
be inserted as a part of the platform, and
if not it should be offered as a minority re
port from this committee.
The financial plank of the platform de
clares for sound money, with an added
clause pronouncing flatly against the free
coinage of silver. While it does not men
tion the gold standard, it does not waste
many words about bimetallism and an in
ternational agreement.
MUNICIPAL REFORMERS.
Annual Conference of the Xational
League in Session at Baltimore.
BALTIMORE, Md., May 6.â Many well
kno^vn political reformers engaged in an
effort to improve the present methods of
governing municipalities met in the as
sembly-room of Music Hall this afternoon
and opened the annual conference of the
National Municipal League. The sessions
will continue until Friday evening. Dele
srates from all parts of the country were
present.
James C. Carter of New York, one of the
country's leading jurists, presided over the
sessions to-day. He is an enthusiastic be
liever in the organization and predicts
many Deneficial results in the near' future.
The first address of the day was made by
Secretary Woodruff. He reviewed the
year's work in municipal reform, and pro
duced statistics showing that to date there
are 267 enrolled bodies, with New York in
the lead. It has 49 municipal reform or
ganizations within its borders, New Jersey
following with 28 and Pennsylvania with
17. Ohio with 15, Illinois with 13, and Wis
consin and California with 12 each. In
diana and Colorado have 10 each, and
Massach usetts, Maryland and Minnesota
9 each. '
"Continuing, he saia: "In the far West
a decided municipal unrest is everywhere
discernible apart from the financial unrest,
which has given rise to Populism.
"The Western communities have de
voted so much time and energy to terri
torial expansion that they have neglected
to provide adequately against the evils of
machine politics ana corruption, although
they are in the* lead of their Eastern
sisters in testing remedial legislation.
"While there has been no conspicuous
event during the past twelve months,
there has been a continuous growth in
numbers and influence in the reform
ranks. The friends and advoeJftes of re
form in Tacoma, Wash., are rejoicing over
their splendid victory of last month, after
a long and arduous campaign, whereby
they secured the adoption of a new
charter, including, with many other ad
mirable provision?, stringent civil service
regulations. Over 60 per cent of the votes
were cast in its favor. This fall the citi
zens of San Francisco will have the op
portunity of placing that city abreast of
her sister communities by giving her a
modern charter in place of its present an
tiquated system, dating from the consoli
dation of 1856."
Mr. Woodruff's report was well received
and he was liberally applauded at its con
clusion.
Charles Morris Howard, secretary of the
Baltimore Reform League, made a very
interesting address on the recent revolt in
Baltimore, its results and its lesson.
"The work of the Ohio Slate Board of
Commerce" was the subject of a paper by
Tom L. Johnson, secretary of the Civic
Federation of Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. John
son criticized the custom which had grown
up of enacting laws to fit certain condi
tions contrary to the constitution of the
State.
Mr. Merritt Starr read a paper on
"Chicago since the adoption of municipal
civil service reform. " giving a description
of the workings of the law. After quoting
from the report of the Chicago Civil Ser
vice Commission at great length, Mr. Starr
continued: "Much has been achieved by
the Municipal League and the civil service
law.
"These two factors together were of more
importance than any other factor in the
last municipal election, when twenty-one
of the thirty-four candidates elected for
Aldermen were indorsed, and in some in
stances originally nominated by the
league."
At the close of this afternoon's session
the delegates were entertained at a garden
party by the members of the Arundel
Club at Walbrook. The feature of to
night's session was the annual address
macie by James C. Carter, president of the
league. He called attention to the re
markable growth of interest in questions
of municipal government; to the vigor
and universality of the movement, and
asserted that the outlook for municipal re
form was more encouraging now than
ever before.

BEN BRUSH THE
DERBY WINNER,
The Game Son of Bramble
First by a Short
Nose.
BEX EDER IN THE PLAGE
Thrilling Struggle Between the
Pair When Straightened
for the Wire.
RACE AS THOUGH HARNESSED.
Jockey Sims Outrides Tabor and Lands
His Mount in a Terrific
Finish.
LOUISVILLE, Kt., May 6.â Great is
Ben Brush. To-day at Churchill Downs,
before one of the greatest crowds that
ever assembled at that world-famous track,
in a finish that tried and showed his mettle
to the very last grain, the homely looking
but honest king of all three-year-olds
bobbed his head first under the wire in as
bruising a finish as was ever witnessed on
a racetrack.
This was the twenty-second Derby that
has been run over the Louisville course,
and it proved one of the best in the his
tory of the club. The crowd was more
than the commodious grand stand could
accommodate, the space in front of the
stand being black with humanity and
enough in the infield to fill a large theater.
The betting on the big event opened with
Brush the favorite at 1 to 2, the price vary
ing from this to 2 to 5; First Mate was
second choice at 4to 1, Semper Ego and
Ulysses next at 6 to 1 and the others rang
ine in price from 10 to 50.
Ben Eder was the first to appear from
the paddock, followed by Parson, Ulysses,
The Winner, Ben Brush, The Dragon,
Semper Ego and First Mate in the order
named. After a delay of about twenty
tiye minutes, caused by the crankiness of
First Mate and Semper Ego, they were
sent away to a good start, with Semper
Ego in the lead, Ben Eder second and The
Winner third.
Passing the stand First Mate had as
sumed command, with Ego second. First
Mate held the lead to the stretch, where
Sims on Ben Brush and Tabor on Ben
Edercame to the front, and the struggle
between the son of Bramble and the son of
Fonso began. They came down the stretch
at lightning speed, their field beaten off,
and nodding their heads together like a
piece of machinery, whalebone and steel
being plied at every jump. Seventy-five
yards from the wire it looked as though
Ben Eder was the winner, but Sims called
on his mount for a last effort, and the
game brown whirlwind came again and
won his race by a short nose, he and all
the others in the race being all out at the
finish.
The fractional time was: :13, 25, 85,
49^, 1:02^. 1;15^, 1:28%, I:42}Â£, 1:55,

JOSE'S THE
FETE OF FETES,
Fair Lillian's Capital City-
Decked by Myriads
of Blossoms.
HER MAJESTY CROWNED
Civic Rule Ends and a Season
of Revelry Is Proclaimed
From the Throne.
MARVELS OF THE PAGEANT.
Fantastic Designs Displayed in a Pro
cession Three Miles in
Length.
EAN JOSE, Cal., May 6.â lf there are
any ready to say that the Santa Clara
County Rose Carnival, opened at San Jose
to-day, is not the most spectacular festi
val that California has ever given, they
must produce strong testimony. When it
is said that the festival is the product of
perfect organization by the strong men
and women of the county, who appreciate
the value of the resources at their com
mand and the wisdom of utilizing them
to make known the resources and attrac
tions of the county, one beeins to dis
cover what intelligent co-operation may
attempt and accomplish. The great fea
ture of to-day's display was the absolute
perfection of its mechanism. Those hav
ine the arrangements in charge were men
and women of that fine order of intelli
gence which realizes the value of harmony
in purpose and execution. Every con
ceivable detail of the opening day had
been worked out beforehand with so per
fect elaboration that the smallest error or
the slightest hitch was rendered impos
sible.
Many months had been given to this
preparation. The local gardens, burdened
with their wealth of bloom, were spared
the invasion of the decorator, and in order
that the beautiful city might still bear its
name of "Garden" over 100 acres were
planted in flowers for carnival uses. As a
consequence the home gardens retained
their glowing integrity, and the display of
flowers lor decorative purposes surpassed
comprehension.
One must travel perilously far into the
millions to estimate the number of any of
the principal flowers used in the decora
tions, such as callas, roses, marigolds
and carnations. In this procession of
wonderful floats and private carriages
more blossoms were used than all the
Eastern and Middle States could produce
in a dozen years. It was all a riot of bloom,
dazzling and bewildering. Out of this
magnificent confusion of color was evolved
a marvelous order of arrangement and
effect. Every part of the gorgeous pro
cession was finely adjusted to its fellows
and to the whole, and the effect of the gen
eral scheme was an intelligent comprehen
sion of much that has made the fame of
tnis wonderful valley.
It is not easy to depict the pride and en
thusiasm of the residents or to estimate
the number of unaccustomed visitors.
How the many thousands of strangers
who presented themselves found accom
modations is a question that the commit
tee charged with housing visitors is doubt
less able to answer with ease: for under
the perfect system of management no one
needed to have gone without comfortable
bed and board. This will be the rule
throughout the week, from to-day's splen
did parade to the masked procession and
ball of jolly and reckless King Cole Satur
day evening. Almost every hour of each
day in the interim is set apart for Borne
special diversion.
Some of the conspicuous features of to
day's exercises were the co-operation of
all parts of the county and tie extraordi
nary prominence of the public and pri
vate schools. It was pleasant to see the
crowning of the gracious and beautiful
Queen and to hear the speeches accom
panying that ceremonial. It was edifying
to inspect the great carnival building and
the numerous booths which various dis
tricts have decorated with incomparable
beauty. It was inspiring to observe the
many thousands who packed the streets
and observation stands and to take pleas
ure out of the dainty summer fabrics
which the generous climate permitted
numberless girls and women to wear.
But above all these things appeared
something none the less pleasing and far
more instructive, and that was the interest
which the people take in their schools.
From every part of the county came pu
pils in distinguishing dress and with hand
some floats, depicting some ideal which
they cherish. From the training-school
and brownies of the State Normal School
to the laboriously constructed float of a
remote district there was a hearty emula
tion based on a friendly rivalry to excel.
Even the wonderful float of the Santa
Clara County Floral Society, with its bank
of clouds drawn by butterfles, and even
the splendid floral ship of the Women's
Club, failed to eclipse the plory of the
Longfelinw School, with its pretty young
Queen sitting under a gilded dome, or the
artistic presentation made by the High
School.
How many thousands of school children
were in the procession a tedious regard to
arithmetic would be required to say. A
prettier sight than their white, pink, blue
or canary costumes, their dainty caps,
sashes and parasols of colored paper, and
the exquisite taste with which these
colors were combined and the precision
with which the pupils marched, could not
be imagined.
A special Providence seemed to guard
the weather conditions. One of those days
of wide and glorious sunshine that lends
to San Jose its luxurious color was abroad
and regnant to-day, and ail things having
life, color and fragrance partook of its
warmth and generosity.
A wonderful change of color came when
darkness fell. Where the splendid efforts
of the sunshine ceased human ingenuity
came into play. Uncountable electric
lights of all colors sprang forth from un
expected corners, and many thousands of
Chinese lanterns blinked mildly every
where. St. James Park was aglow with
these soft mystical lights from the Orient.
The concert and dance in the evening had
their crowds.
There are other good things on the Hat
for to-morrow, and splendid fireworks for
tbe evening. But San Jose, it is feared,
will go wholly mad Satuiday evening when
that most irresponsible of creatures, King
Cole, assumes supreme authority.

QUEEN LILLIAN CROWNED.
Thousands Cheer the Ruler of the
Floral Pete.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 6.â Very early in
the morning San Jose was astir, and very
early too the genial sunshine streamed
down npon the city, bringing gladness to
the people. The streets were alive with
strangers and townsfolk while the bright
morning was still struggling against odds
in the form of overhanging clouds, and
while a perfect day was heralded at that
hour, white dresses and carnival colors
transformed the whole city.
It was long before the time for begin
ning the formal reception and coronation
of the Queen, yet everybody was expec
tant and prepared for the grand carnival.
Even from the night the streets nad
grown more beautiful. Every house was
decorated with bunting, flowers and ever
greens. Into most of the decorations roses
and palms and lilies entered extensively.
At short intervals the principal streets
were strung across with banners of vari
ous designs and colors; flags, especially
Old Glory, were displayed on every con
ceivable spot, and in addition to all this
the architectural lines of many buildings
were covered with evergreens.
Green festoons, strings of Japanese lan
terns and floral festoons lightened the
effect in places.
In all its lavish carnival garb San Jose
presented a really impressive spectacle,
which was not wholly conventional. The
floral arches were refreshingly original,
the general scheme of decoration combin
ing some meaning with display. For in
stance, there is one arch that was finished
this morning â the arch of welcome at the
broad-gauge depotâ a white structure with
graceful proportions. The secret of its
story is told in evergreen wreathoa that
cover the surface.
Street-cars, vehicles, bicycles, all were
decorated like the streets, and with the
beginning of a delightful warm day they
all jostled in the general tnrong that
wÂ«nde<l its way to the carnival pavilion in
Agricultural Park.
Here the ceremony of crowning the
Queen of the carnival was to be performed.
More than 5000 people packed the build
ing. The gallery balustrades were com
pletely hidden under mosses, evergreens
and flowers, while some light drapery fell
upon them. Overhead were suspended
red, white and blue bunting in such pro
fusion, yet with much grace, that the ceil
ing was hidden.
The stage was hung on each side with
tricolored drapery, which formed The side
walls of a room, at the end of which was
the queen's beautiful throne. A slightly
elevated platform, covered with white and
surrounded by a festoon of roses upon
cream and gold supports, was the spot re
served for royalty. There was a back
groundâa mosaic of roses of many colors
fading away into evergreens and palms.
Then there were cream and gold pillars on
each side, surmounted oy gilded crowns,
and over all a white-net canopy, suspended
from a great crown of marigolds and
snulax. Immediately under the floral
emblem of royalty was the throne, with
seats for the maids and pages.

STREET SCENE IN SAN JOSE DURING THE MAGNIFICE T FLORAL PAGEANT.
covieri's orchestra there arose a murmur
through the house. The Queen had
come â the Queen, a lovely girl in gorgeous
robes, her long train borne by little at
tendants. Her ladies in waiting, dressed
with exquisite taste in white any carrying
bouquets, followed. H. V. Morehouse,
the Prime Minister, led her Majesty to
the throne, where she took her seat, sur
rounded by attendants. Popes, Countesses
and vassais. The Hon. B. D. Murphy,
president of the day, opened the cere
monies with an appropriate speech,
saying:
Ladies and gantlemen: When you want to
! see the highest type of civilization you must
look to the West. This great Western Nation,
washed by the Pacific and Atlantic oceans,
over which waves the stars and stripes, Is the
hignesttype of civilization. \VÂ© of San Jose
I are a conspicuous part of that civilization.
I Placed in the midst of a valleyâ the loveliest
jon earthâ we represent the intelligence, the
morality and the culture of the State of Cali
fornia.
But, my friends, it is necessary for every
body, however cultured, to have rest ; and with
this object in view the enterprising citizens of
this county, under the leadership of J. H.
Henry, have inaugurated the carnival of roses.
It is a singular thing that San Jose vu the
first city in all California. Other settlementa
had been madeâ San Diego, Santa Barbara,
San Luis Obispo and Montereyâ but these were
under the jurisdiction of the missions, and
their government was religious rather than
civil. San Jose was the first city constituted by.
the Spanish Government, 119 years ago, under
the name of La Pueblo de Sau Jose de Guada
loupe.
It is but proper that we should take part in
the great floral procession which is now tak
ing place all over the country, and let me as
sure you that no pains have been spared to
make the carnival a (toriotu â tirnoii. This
carnival will rival and eclipse all other festiv-
QUEEN LILLIAN IN HER REGAL GOWN.
I ities that have taken place on the Pacific Coast.
B. A. Herrington, the District Attorney,
! said :
We have been in a condition of humble ser
; vitude. To-day we select for ourselves a queen
i of mirth and peace and happiness. It it with
. greatest pleasure I crown this lovely Queen
j who hascome to reign over us during this fes
i tive occasion.
With a golden crown he adorned the
1 fair brow of her Majesty, who bent upon
one knee to accept the token. The strains ;
of "America" burst from the band simul
taneously with the applause from the audi
ence. Then there came from the gallery a
melodious chorus of 500 voices, under the
direction of Professor J. H. Elwood.
Mayor Koch conferred the freedom of
San Jose upon the Queen and her court j
and welcomed her. Minister More house
responded extending to the people greet
ings from her Majesty.
William T. Jeter, Lieutenant-Governor
of California, declared that her Majesty
would hold sway, not only over the Santa |
Clara Valley, but over all California. He j
asked the people to unite and be neigh
bors upon this festive occasion, and that
they be obedient to her gracious Majesty
in everything. President Jordan of Stan- 1
ford University delivered a brief oration |
on the carnival, and the coronation cere
monies were brought to a close with ap- â 
propriate music.
THREE MILES OF BEAUTY.
San Jose's Pageant the Crowning
Glory of All Festivals.
BAN JOSE, Cal., May 6.â From all over
the Santa Clara Valley they came, even
while the Queen of the Carnival was re
j ceiving homage in the pavilion. From Los
Gatos and Saratoga, from Panta Clara and
Palo Alto they came â the subjects of Queen
Lillian. They came in four-in-hand, in
! tandems, family carriages, bu gies, on the
' trains, on horseback and bicycles, and
some afoot. All were bent on the same
purposes. They were in holiday attire
and fully prepared to take part in the
' grand floral parade. This of itself was a
i privilege one might be proud of enjoying;
for the parade was certainly one of the '
most picturesque and most beautiful j
pageants ever seen in California.
For exquisite taste this feature of the ;
carnival won lauiels from its competitors.
It took about an hour And a half to pass a
given point and as it moved slowly it is
reasonable to infer that its length was
tnree miles or thereabouts.
Tuink of it. Three mile* of beanty, of
children in carnival dresses, of one <
wonderful float after another and glitter- I
ing pageantry all typical of the lovely
flowers.
There was apparent a wholesome rivalry
! for the honor of prizes and- beyond this
motive a deep sympathy witn the carnival
I spirit. The ladies gave evidence of their
j thought and fine conception of beauty in
color effects. The allegorical floats showed j
also how delicate this conception was, even
when harmonized witu inventive faculty,
which accomplished marvelous results in
more than one instance.
A grand stand had been erected opposite
the courthouse on First street for a block,
but it was packed with people an hour be
for the procession moved. Directly oppo-
I site, in St. James Park, the judges occu
pied a stand nnder high spreading palms.
It was well on in the afternoon when the
Chief of Police rode down First street,
past the grand stand mounted on a
horse all bedecked with roses. A few yards
behind him came a platoon of his men
and then Grand Marshal H. W. Wright,
with yellow sash flowing in the breeze.
Immediately after him rode a gay caval
cade headed by Chief Aid C. C. Derby.
These riders were handsomely mounted,
with wreaths of roses ana marguerites
upon their horses and white saddle-pads
bordered with gold.
They were: Dr. I. A. Frazer, A. J. Stal
der, William Gallagher. Geurge Dunlap of
Gilroy, D. R. Pender, William Ryder, L.
A. Sage, George Bollinger, Gus Lyon.
Gcorce Ballou, F. C. Banford, George
Keffel, C. Argues, J. E. Kennedy of Camp
bell, A. L. Shaw of Berryessa, Frank
Towne of Mayrield, W. A. Pepper of Los
Gatos, J. D. Beggs of Los Gatos, C. W.
Gertridge, Charles Leitch of Alviso, J. T.
Donovan and A. M. Barker.
The first division of the pageant was led
by P. P. Austin as marshal, who, with his
aids, preceded the band. The Fourth
United States Cavalry, under Colonel
Young, passed in platoons of twelve men
abreast, and received applause along the
line of march. Company B, Fifth Infan
try. In. G. C, followed in commaud of
Captain H. L. Partridge, and then the
heralds â boys on horsebackâ with tri
color hats and uniforms, each one carry
ing a small flag on his lance.
Queen Lillian was escorted by these
floral lancers in her gorgeous chariot. She
sat high up on a throne in the rear by her
prime minister. On the next step in front
sat the pages, and atill further in front her
maidaof honor Â»nd flower girls in the
center. The Queen was surrounded by
palms and lilies, while a canopy leading to
a dome was overhead. Garlands of flow
ers were drawn around the columns, giv
ing the whole a fantastic effect. Her cha
riot was drawn by six coal-black steeds,
each led by a richly-uniformed Nubian.
The second platoon of floral lancers
looking like the first, brought up tho rear.
The Knights of Pythias Uniform Rank
Phil Sheridan Post, G. A. R., and John
Dix Post, G. A. R., were given a place of
honor.
Probably the most unique and artistic
desien in floatsâ the Santa Clara County
Floral Society's emblemâ was next in line.
This was the chariot^ Queen Flora, who
sat in a golden car canopied with flowers.
Butterflies were harnessed to the fairy con- !
veyance, and all rested upon white clouds !
that had the appearance of rolling in great ]
gray massesâ an effect reached with cotton
and white roses and peas. Little fairy girls \
rode the butterflies as outsiders. The San I
Jose Hussars made up the rear guard.
Spectators called Flora's chariot a
"dream."
The second part was led by Marshal T.
F. Morrison with three aids, after whom
came the Capitol City Drum Corps, making
a prodigious rataplan on their drums.
A peculiarly interesting section of the
pageant came upon the scene after the
| drummers. San Jose High School was
first in this. Its boys marched post in
! white suits and purple hatbands, followed
i by the g'rls in white muslin â dres3eÂ«, lav
ender hats and lavemier and white para
i sols. More High School boys were in line,
1 wearing dark clothes and white and
j purple hats. Their float wa3 drawn by
four gray horses. It was pyramidal in
form, allegoric of Education. Lavender
colored pea blossoms and white flowers
were used exclusively in it. Ten girls in
costume posed amon â  floral easels, globes,
etc., represented Learning. The teachers
were behind in carriages.
Horace Maun Grammar School float,
drawn by four black horses abreast, was
an ideal of May and Carnival. Upon a
green platform, festooned and framed in
roses, a number ot little children in gay
dresses performed the Maypole dance,
twisting colored ribbons around the pole
as they romped and sang in unison with
the music of violins and mandolins in the
hands of young ladies who occupied seats
| on an elevated platform. Among them
was the May Queen, crowned with roses.
The May float was applauded continu
ously. Girls in whits and pink with pink
butterfly hats, and boys in white shirts
with parasols and pink sashes, alternating
with companies of girls in like colored cos
tumes, represented the Mann school.
The Lonefellow School made a creditable
display. It had a drum corps, followed by
regiments of boys and girls in white, with
flowing yellow sashes. The girls wore
yellow hats. Their float that followed was
"Beautiful Santa Clara, the Land of Sun
shine, Fruit and Flowers." Six white
horses in yellow, trappings drew the float â
a temple of Romanesque design in the
center of the platform, all in white and
gold ; a cornucopia emblematic of the
orchards; a shell seat, in which sat Miss
Jennie Owen (Beautiful Santa Clara), her
pages â Gladys Page and Bess Baconâ at
her feet. Sunshine (Elia Taylor) sat in
the front, wearing a dazzling costume of
gold. Lulu Jutb, adorned with white
roses and marigolds, represented Flora.
Six little figures, callas and poppies, sat
near the Queen. Ruth Bennett as Ceres
was a classic goddess, and Nellie Donnelly
appeared as Pomona, goddess of fruit.
Following this float were still more Doys
and girls in the delicate colors of the
school.
Tne Dowdeil Grammar School was in
the fourth division. Its float rested upon
ferns and represented a bower of exotics,
where musicians and tiny tots amused
themselves. Standard-bearers at the cor
ners floated the colors of the school, which
were worn by children on foot â white,
pink and pale green â in hats and sashes.
Grant Grammar School typified Music
in n float of considerable beauty. To this
end lavender and white, two of the most
airy colors, were selected with which to
decorate not only the float but the school
children in the parade. Miss Libbie Ham

ilton was the school Queen, seated under
an airy canopy in the rear of the float.
She was attended by Ethel Burchard,
Edith Cole, Majorie Heaviside and Hazel
Herndon, her maids of honor. The float
contained an orchestra of Grecian-,
maidens, who were among floral musical
instruments. Boys and girls of the school
walked behind, all in white and lavender.
Washington School's float was the
crowning of the Woodland Queen in tropi
cal woods â a garden scene of palms, exo
tics, ferns and flowers, with the Queen Â©n
a mound surrounded by her subjects,
dressed in white and green.
The next float was the rose garden from
the Lincoln School. The Queen of Roses,
surrounded by her court, sat enthroned
beneath a canopy of roses. Eleven little
girls, representing popular roses, were em
bowered in a forest of palms. The pre
dominant color of the float was white,
with pink trimmings.
The San Jose Parlor Native Sons of the
Golden West led the fourth division. The
float represented the seal of California, in
which Minerva was impersonated by Miss
Louise Carto. The Observatory Parlor
float, representing Lick Observatory, with
a bear as the astronomer peering through
thfc telescope, came next, and Palo Alto
Parlor was also represented.
"The Progress and Education of San
Jose"â the Women's Clvb â was repre
sented in the parade by an allegorical
float, on which was seated Miss Mary Wal
ter, representing San Jose sitting in the
midst of plenty, with a wnite dove resting
on her head, her waist encircled by gar
larnds of grapevines, fruit blossoms and
grains.
In the prow of the boat stood the "Her
ald ot Prophecy", Miss Sue January; in
the stern, Justice, Miss May Livingstone.
The pedestal was upheld by Art, Miss

Can Youth
Be Restored?
Has the Spring of Perpetual Energy
Been Discovered? Here is a Let-
. ter From a Well-Known Jeweler
of Los Gatos, California, Who
Has Found a Means of Renewing
the Vigor of His Younger Days.
Is there a means of preserving the
vigor of youth? Why is it that while some
men lose their vital powers in middle age,
others retain it to three score and ten?
Have these old men found a way to keep
up the fires of animal vitality? Evidently
tney have. Here is an old man who came
near dying, but if you will read his letter
yon will conclude that he has found the
spring which boils forth youthful energy.
LOS GATOS (Col.), May 5, 1896.
DR. A. T. SAXDEKâ Dear Sir: Your Electric
Belt, which I have now worn one month, is
the most wonderful thing that has ever been
invented, on account of its having so remark-
ably improved the deplorable condition" that I
was in before I wore it. At that time Dr. R.
A. Urquhart of Los Gatos said that I was
threatened with softening at the brain. I
could remember but very little of anything,
and could not converse intelligently. Now
my memory and reasoning powers are* as good
as ever. I previously had pains which actual ly
drove me out of my mind. 1 felt liKe a mad
dog chained to a post at times, they made me
suffer such intense misery. They would twist
my muscles in powerful spasms, first one part of v
the body, again at another, especially intense â 
in my breast. This has all disappeared now.
I cannot describe to you how happy I feel that
I do not have to drag out a miserable existence
for the rest of my life. Further, my sight was
so poor for years that I could hardly read with
glasses. I can now read very well without
them. My appetite is greatly improved, and â¢
whereas before I could walk but a few steps
without being fatigued, I can now walk miles
with pleasure. I swing dumbbells and Indian
clubs with ease, though when I commenced
to use the Belt I could hardly lift one. In fact
it has saved my life, as I felt before I used it
that I could never recover, and all my friends
thought that I had not long to live. I can now
jump for joy and gratitude at the great change
it has worked in my health and spirits. My
sexual powers first commenced to leave me ten
years ago. I have now regained them again.
I cannot say too much for the great benefit I
have derived. Yours gratefully,
J. A. J. MORSE.
P. S.â This is the first time in four years that
I have been able to write my name.
Almost Beyond Belief.
Mr. Morse has been a jeweler in Los
Gatos foT many years, and his condition
has been known to nearly every one in that
town. Those who meet him on the street
now hardly recognize in him the decrepit
old man who a month aero was believed to
be on the verge of the grave. It seems
almost impossible to believe, but when,
one looks back ten years and considers the
remarkable progress which has been made
in Electricity in that time it is not strange.
Electricity has accomplished wonders in
mechanics, and it is accomplishing greater
wonders in medical treatment. But owing
to the prevalence of quackery and the
many cheap, poorly made articles which
have been foisted on the suffering public,
many people are slow to acknowledge the
curative value of Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt. Many cures almost as remarkable
as this one are shown in the little pamph-
let which Dr. Banden Bends free of charge.
If you send now you . may save yourself
much suffering and expense for future
doctor bills. Address

Following came the Schuetzen section,
San Jose Turn Verein, the float an old
German castle, with a representation of
the fable, "A Sleeping Beauty." Next
came the A. O. U. \\\, with a float show
ing characteristics of the order, and the
A. O. P., with a float representing a wood
land scene with Foresters.
In the fifth division, under Marshal E.
W. Conant, the Palo Alto band furnished
music. The town of Palo Alto had an
appropriate float with a tall tree. Its
school district a!so had a floatâ a floral
school-house that was much admired.
Then followed a bicycle clud in doubles;
hoys wreathed with flowers; the Franklin
Cadets and Franklin School float, repre
senting the Queen of Peace and Plentyâ
an angel and a cornucopia. Following
was a pyramid float of girls in light
dresses, the East San Jose float. Queen of
the Marigolds, Gardner float, and Hamil
ton float, the latter a huge calla lily of
calla lilies, with an angel inside.
I lOrchard School district was in the pa
rade with a boat of roses and sweet peas,
forming a platform from which rose
leaves were winnowed over the streets.
This was a "floral shower."
Hester School district bad a handsome
float drawn by six black steeds. The idea
was pretty, with two great swans drawing
a boat of marigolds full of little girls in
white. Another float had fully 100 chil
dren under a canopy on an immense
wagon.
Santa Clara had the sixth division to it
self almost, with its band and its town and
school floats. Santa Clara float was a fairy
scene, with children as butterflies, and
after it a chariot typifying American his
tory. Ladies on horseback followed, and
presently the Willow Glen district float,
"Music," was in line.
Resting upon the bed of the float was an
immense scroll, and upon this "Music" was
portrayed and a croup of six young peo
ple with a lyre. The side of the float had
measures of music work of flowers, in
which the notes of the staff spelled out
"Willow Glen."
Saratoga float was a trolley car. The
next was the Alviso steamer, propelled by
unseen power and apparently sailing along
t&e street â a pretty floral ship. Los Gatos
had a magnificent floral float carrying
ladies under a canopy. Campbell's float
was a camel of white roses, ridden by a
child. Pala had a great barge â Cleopatra's
barge â in white and yellow flowers, that
was admired. Morgan Hill and Dayfield
â were also represented with pretty floats,
and there were funny brownies and fairies
here.
There were interesting features in the
seventh division, St. Joseph College float
portraying an old mission in flowers â
Santa Clara Mission reproduced â and after
it the old place transformed into a classic
structure.
Notre Dame College had a beautiful
Egyptian float in white and gold repreÂ«
senting Liberty and Faith. Gates Ajar
showed Justice crowning Virtue. The
University of the Pacific float was a work
of art, the Parthenon with its ruined
columns and a representation of Apollo
and the Musea on Mount Parnassus.
Santa Clara College float represented a
modern art building, open on all sides and
affording glimpses of the sciences and
Flora on the throne. The figures upon it
were all in classic parb.
In the eighth division were grouped the
.following equipages: Burlingame County
CJub coach : the Misses Clark of San Jose,

FOR STANFORD DAY.
Students at Palo Alto Making Great
Preparations.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
6. â Great preparations are being made here
for the celebration of Stanford day at the
San Jose Rose Carnival. Special rates to
the students have been made, and be
tween 500 and 800 will leave the campus
on Friday morning to attend the festivi
ties. An elaborate float has been pre
pared at Palo Alto, which will be drawn
by students a-wheel.
The Stanford baseball nine is to be met
at the depot by a band and will be escorted
to the carnival grounds, where the third
and final intercollegiate game of the series
is to be played. The game will be most
interesting, as Stanford will play as she
has never played before. The team is
anxious to wipe out the record of Satur
day's defeat, and the men are practicing
steadily, though handicapped by lacking a
second team to play against.
At 2:30 p. M. the field events are to take
place on the track. Nearly all of Stanford's
best athletes will enter the events, and some
record-breaking should ensue if condi
tions are favorable.
The hop takes place in the evening.

VIVA LA FIESTA
DE HEALDSBURG !
Northern Sonomans Bend
the Knee to Queen
Alice.
RULES A GAY POPULACE.
Vassals Assemble by Thousands
to Rout All Care at Her
Command.
CROWNED BY PRETTY MAIDS.
A Season of Revelry Proclaimed From
the Throne â KiDg Cook's
Invasion.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., May 6.â Viva la
Fiesta! With the blare of trumpets and
the beat of arums commenced the reign of
her GraciouÃ Majesty, Queen Alice, tbe
Fair. Loyal subjects have assembled from
all quarters of the county to do honor to
La Rein a. All work has beeu suspended;
the city is transformed.
Heaidsburg is fair enough in her every,
day dress to dazzle the eyes of her guests,
but in her carnival fineries she is costumed
as in rainbows of many hues.
The streets are avenues of brilliant col
ors both day and night; for when the
sunshine fades from the tossing sea of
bright bunting the electric lights flash out,
sparkling like gems in every direction.
Since early morning the Healdsburg,
Cloverdale and Windsor bands have dis
coursed music. The streets have been
thronged all day with merry-makers.
The stores and principal buildings have
been decorated with bunting and flags
and flowers.
Below the billows of bunting was the
clear green of the cedar, reaching out in
graceful sweeps and curves, at once a foil
and an intensitier to the wanner colors
above and about. In and through and over
all this, as a last necessary touch and to give
dignity to the whole, were the National
colors, the flag of freedom, the colors that
mean so much to us as a Nation, and
without the protection of which no fete
would be complete. Many of the faces
seen in the streets are strange, and the ra
diant faces of storekeepers and hotel men
prove that the 'â¢tenderfoot" is within our
gates.
The coronation of the Queen, Alice
Haigb, took place shortly after 1 o'clock.
Marshal Norton and his aids escorted the
Queen from her residence to the grand
stand in the center of the plaza. The or
der of procession was as follows: Mar
shals, pages, Queen, maids of honor, flow
er girls, knights, committee. On arriving
at the scene of the coronation E. M. Nor
ton Esq. read the herald's notice, which
concluded as follows:
In the Queen's name, and in the name of the
city, l had bid you one and all a hearty welcome
that her rule may be so far from restraint and
her scepter so lightly wielded that all may find
within her realm that form of pleasure which
to you is most agreeable.
Then came tbe coronation of Queen
Alice by her two maids of honor, Misses
Zane and Biddle. After the coronation
came the declaration by Dr. C. W. Weaver,
the delivering of tbe keys by the Mayor,'
"God Save the Queen" by the band, the
appointment of a Prime Minister and the
conferring of the honor of knighthood
upon J. R. Miller by the Queen. Prime
Minister Miller read the proclamation,
and a band played "Long Live Queen
Alice."
Tho tilting tonrnament between Dry
Creek and Heaidsburg in the afternoon,
resulted in favor of Heaidsburg.
The formal entry of the Calithnmpians
was made at 4 o'clock. Frank E. Cook
was crowned their King. Tbe Calithum
pians were out in full force. Their antics
were not intended to be taken seriously;
it was a huge farce from beginning to
end â a good natured token that the festi
val season had arrived and that for the
rest of the week the city would be en fete.
With all their crudities, their attempt* at
fun were appreciated by the assembled
thousands.
In the evening there was an open-air
concert by the bands, and at the opera
house a concert by San Francisco artists.
The Veteran Firemen of San Francisco
arrived to-night. The pioneer fire laddies
were met at tbe depot by the local
department and are now comfortably
quartered. The incoming night train
brought many other visitors, over 100 cy
clers being aboard. The floral paiade and
bicycle meet will draw thousands to this
place to-morrow and accommodations for
every one have been secured.
SUFFRAGISTS AT MADERA.
Opening of a Vigorous Campaign for the
Right of Women to Wield the
Ballot.
MADERA. Cal., May 6.â The Women
Suffragists of this county will practically
open their campaign of education on the
ballot question by a meeting in this city at
Athletic Hall to-morrow evening.
The open espousal by The Call of the
cause of equal suffrage has done much in
this county to awaken a general interest
in the movement, and the meeting to
morrow night promises to be the largest of
its kind ever held in this part of the val
ley. A number of the best-known orators
in this section have consented to speak on
tne question of woman's suffrage, and
many of these speakers are well known
throughout the State. So far as Madera
County is concerned, the movement is
calling out the best and most earnest men
and women in public life. Among the
speakers to-morrow night are: Judge O.
T. Redfield, Judge W. T. Searles, Judge W.
F. Fowler, W. H. Larew, R. L. Hargrove,
W. E. Wolf, Professor W. H. Williams, F.
W. Taft, Thomas CosÃrove, Superinten
dent of Public Instruction B. A. Hawkins,
ex-State Senator G. W. Mordocai and Dr.
F. R. Brown.
Tbe meeting is held under the auspices
of the Madera Equal Suffrage Club, the
officers of which are: President, Mrs. Ella
McConnell; vice-precicleni, Mrs. W. B.
McElwee; secretary. Mrs. Carrie McFall;
treasurer, Mrs. W. H. l^arew; correspond
ing secretary, Mrs. Maggie Vincent.
It is expected that this meeting will be
the beginning of a very active and aggres
sive campaign on the part of the club, its
members and its many friends in this
county.
YOLO COUNTY FIREBUGS.
Two Conflagrations Started by
Incendiaries Within an
Hour.
The Eureka Schoolhouse and a Ranch
Barn Are Burned to the
Ground.
WOODLAND, Cal., May 6.â Fire fiends
were in evidence in this county last night
and early this morning. At 11:30 o'clock
the Eureka schoolhouse, an exceptionally
fine country building, was burned to the
ground. The loss will reach about $2000.
About 12:30 o'cloot the commodious barn
owned by John Wohlfrom.on the road be
tween Knights Landing and Blacks, was
disco vered to be on nre, and b'fore the
names could be extinguished the build
ing and its contents were a total loss.
The fact that there were two fires within
an hour and that the property destroyed
was within a radius of two miles, has re
sulted in no little excitement among the
residents in that vicinity. That it was
ihe work of incendiaries there can be no
doubt, but no one has the least idea who
the guilty parties are. The ofneers are
making a careful investigation.

SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 6.â A

The man has been placed in the County

patients. A further examination will be
made to-morrow by consulting physicians
and the result will be awaited with
anxiety.

CASTING BALLOTS

Election of Officers of the
Grand Court of
Foresters.
VELLAGE CHIEF RANGER
Grand Secretary Bremer Will
Continue to Serve His
Brethren.
GROWTH OF THE FELLOWSHIP.
New Lodges Instituted and a Gratify*
ing Financial Advancement
Reported.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., May 6.â The sec
ond day's session of the Foresters of
America opened at 9 o'clock this morning.
The forenoon session was taken up princi
pally with the reading of the reports of
the grand ofneers and action on a partial
report of the law committee. The report
of the supreme representatives was ap
proved and a vote ot thanks tendered for
their labors at Cleveland, Ohio, last fall.
The reports of the various grand ofneers
â particularly that of the grand secretary
â show that, although the order has not
gained much in membership, it has made
a large gain in finances. During the year
the subordinate courts have increased
their cash on hand $15,870 90. Since the
last Grand Court meeting eleven new
courts have been instituted, with a total
charter membership of 353. There are
now in this jurisdiction 147 courts, with a
membership of 13,750, and when the past
year of financial depression is taken into
consideration tbe fact that there has not
been a loss in membership, instead of a
slight gain, is remarkable.
The great fundamental principle of this
order â benevolence and assistance in sick
ness and distressâ is well illustrated by
the fact that during the recess of the
Grand Court the sum of $97,978 66 has
been paid for sick and funeral bills and the
relief of distress.
In the consideration of the partial re
port submitted by the law committee at
the morning session, nearly all of the
amendments submitted by various courts
were defeated. The question of biennial
sessions, which bobs up every year, was
defeated, after a very long and heated de
bate, by a vote of 125 to 49.
An amendment somewhat similar in its
nature â that is, in the line of economy â
namely, that mileage be allowed to but one
delegate from each court, and providing
that in the absence of the several delegates
one should be ailowed to cast their votes
by proxy, was under discussion at i,he time
of the noon recess.
At 2 o'clock the selection of the place of
meeting of the next Grand Court was the
first order of business taken up. The vote
resulted in the selection of Marysville,

We could have no objection to such methods if they didn't adopt names

WASHINGTON, . D. C, May 6.â The
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
this morning reached a compromise on the
Spalding and Scrymser bills before it for
the construction of a cable to Japan by

cable between tbe United States and Japan
by the way of Hawaii and the Midway
Islands. It is stipulated that the
price shall not exceed $160,000, to be

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
All hail ! McKinley.
The platform suits the people.
Harmony is the watchword now.
The convention did its work well.
Â»
As goes California so goes The Call.
111 1 was a victory for straight politics.
The delegation is one the State can be
proud of.
We asked for a stem-winder platform
and we got it.
Sacramento was a storm center, but San
Jose is an aurora borealis.
There is no uncertainty about the money
plank. It means business.
There are no complaints heard in these
days of ''nothing in the papers."
McKinley, protection and free silver
coinage make a good combination.
Martin Kelly has been dropped into a
cavity, but he never will be missed.
Every step toward woman suffrage is a
step toward purity at the ballot-box.
The platform is broad enough and strong
enough for all loyal Republicans to
stand on.
The woman's suffrage plank is first in
the platform, and will not be last in the
campaign.
The voice of the Senate is the first in
peace, the first for war and the last for
coast defenses.
San Jose might as well make Queen*
Lilian's reign a permanent thing and be a
paradise forever.
Indiana is evidently willing to give Har
rison a chance to guess again on the Presi
dential conundrum.
The full report of California's gold prod
uct has never been told. We are richer
than the records show.
The action of the convention will uncork
Republican enthusiasm, but it will prove
a corker to Democracy.
The campaign lor protection should
make Californians more earnest in sup
porting California industries.
Politics and festivals make a combina
tion sufficiently stimulating to give the
whole State a cocktail atmosphere.
The second Mrs. Harrison knows no
reason why sbe should not be the lady of
the White House as well as the first one.
Cleveland has already become something
of a back number, and public attention
turns away from him for the coming man.
Neither those who see the Healdsburg
fete, nor those who see the San Jose rose
carnival will envy any other crowd in the
State. _
Auburn is not straining herself for a car
nival, but she has gladdened her people
with one of the best flower shows of the
season.
We can count on the delegation to ad
vance the interests of California at Bt.
Ix)uis, and maintain the cause of the
Greater West.
Kruger is making the British telegraph
lines not only score diplomatic victories
for him, but furnish him with evidence
for gaining more.
Judging from the comparative degree of
public interest in the two events the Chi
caeo convention will hardly be a sideshow
to that at St. Louis.
What each nation would like mon just
now is to see two other nations get into a
naval war and put the modern battle-ship
to a test before any more are built.
The motion for an investigation of the
bond deals moves slowly, but it may yet
reach the White House in time to find
Cleveland out by finding him at home.
There was, of course, a good deal of
seeming discord at Sacramento while the
party instruments were getting into tune,
but now comes the triumphant harmony.
Senator Pettigrew expressed a wide
spread public sentiment in saying the
bond deals seem "rotten, dishonest and
corrupt to the core, and therefore ought
to be investigated."
Really we might as well arrange a mid
summer festival in San Francisco, just to
return our compliments to the interior
and show a willingness to get into the
State procession and be a good fellow.
â  â  Â«
Between silver monometallism and gold
monometallism, there is a broad safe road
along which the Republican party
marches, but the Democrats of both fac
tions have become bewildered and taken
to the woods.
It should need no argument to convince
anybody that the ferry depot which is to
be the grand entrance gate to the metropo
lis of California should be constructed of
California stone and be a monument to
her resources and her workmanship.
WORK WELL DONE.
The Pacramento convention has done
its work well. While the action taken
may not as a whole be in accord with the
wishes of any particular individual, it will
be in the highest degree satisfactory to the
party generally. The platform ia a strong,
ringing declaration of principles, dealing
courageously with every issue before the
people. The delegation to St. Louis is
made up of able, earnest and loyal men,
and while we beliere they could accom
plish more effective work hr.d they been
left unpledged, yet they are men of such
eminent ability and influence that even
with the restrictions UDon them there is
no doubt they will be able to do much to
advance the interests of California and
maintain the great cause of bimetallism.
The marked characteristic of the con
vention was the earnestness with which
the members engaged in the work before
it and the orderly manner in which all
was accomplished. Differences of opinion
existed among the delegates on many sub
jects, and there were many contests for
seats to be decided. These, under man
agement of less skillful leaders and organ
izers, or left to the arbitration of men lesa
devoted to tbe great principles or less
loyal to the welfare of the party, might
easily have occasioned excitements that
would have resulted in antagonisms and
bitterness. They were, however, dealt
with in the right spirit and settled with a
true political 'Xisdom. Every step taken
tended to the establishment of a satisfac
tory basis of agreement, and the result is
a harmony in which the whole party is
united.
The instructions given will place the
California delegation among the support
ers of McKinley as long as there
is a chance for his nomination. In
taking this action the convention un
doubtedly intended to voice the gen
eral sentiment of the Republicans of
the State, and none can question its right
and its ability to declare what that senti
ment is. To tbe expression thus made all
California Republicans should give a will
ing approval. There must be harmony and
unity of action in this as in all things else.
The highest authority of the party in the
State has spoken, and while there is a pros
pect of his nomination at the National
Convention California will cast her vote
for McKinley.
Out of the proceedings of the conven
tion, as out of every other political event
in these times, auguries can be drawn
bright with promise that the Republican
party will achieve in the coming campaign
the greatest political victory of this gen
eration. There is harmony in the party
everywhere. There is energy, enthusiasm
and unity in the rank and file. The cry of
patriotism, protection and prosperity
thrills every heart, and it is with ardor the
grand old party waits the day when it
shall overwhelm it* foes at the ballot-box.
THE PLATFORM.
The Sacramento platform vindicates the
claim of the Republican party to be not
only the party of the people, but the
party of liberal ideas, of progress and of
reform. It does not content itself with re
affirming the principles of the past, but it
goes forward to new things. It asserts
with an undiminished fidelity its devotion
to the policy of protection and bimetallism
and then proceeds to carry the cause of
American advancement further yet by
declaring for woman's suffrage and the
direct assistance by the Government of the
great interests of shipping, mining, dairy
ing and farming.
The strong declarations in favor of pro
tection to all forms of American industry
were of course expected. This will consti
tute the chief issue of the campaign, ana
the attitude of the Republican party
toward it is too well knorvn for any great
interest to be felt in the renewal of its
declarations of loyalty to the principles of
complete protection. The salient features
of the Sacrameoto platform therefore
will be found in the planks supporting
woman's suffrage, the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, the
restriction of pauper, criminal and con
tract immigration, Government aid for the
transportation of agricultural products,
the encouragement of hydraulic mining
where it can be carried on without injury
to other interests, ard the commendation
given to the efforts made by our delegation
in Congress to defeat the funding schemes
of the Pacific companies.
It is not to be expected that the Na
tional Convention will adopt or accept all
of these California ideas. Nevertheless
their oresentation at St. Louis will have a
marked influence upon the platform to be
adopted there.
It is the progressive and courageous
States that in the end rule the coun
try. It is because there were such things
as New England ideas and Southern ideas
that those two sections for so long a time
divided with one another the control of
the Government. It is time now for West
ern ideas to be put forward and California
is charged with the duty of asserting them.
Our State platform, therefore, is none too
radical. It is suited to the time and the
problems of the time and should be sup
ported with vim and vigor.
THE NAPA VINEYARDS.
Every grape-grower in the State is deeply
interested in the new vine disease that has
appeared among the vineyards of Napa
Valley. Intelligent growers who have in
spected the affected vines are of the opin
ion that the trouble arose from the fact
that the Kiparis, a native vine immune
from phylloxera, has a habit bf keeping
its roots near the surface, and that the
long hot spell of last summer in the Napa
Valley, combined with tbe porosity of the
loamy soil, caused the heat to injure the
roots. This seems to be a rational con
clusion, as the Lenoir. another resistant
stock, sends its roots deeper and escaped
injury. This is true also with non-resist
ant vinea which are perfectly healthy.
Tbe assumption is strengthened by the
fact that in those parts of the State where
the climatic and soil conditions were un
like those at Napa, the Iliparia was unin
jured.
The value of these considerations is ap
parent when it is reflected that they point
away from any assumption that the
Riparia has developed a specific disease.
If it has done so the situation might be
regarded as serious. It is difficult to
imagine how Bucb could be the case, as
the vine is growing in its native habitat,
and the rule in the domestication of wild
plants is that care and cultivation im
prove their quality and strengthen their
vigor. It cannot be expected, however,
thai a wild plant will thrive if tbe condi
tions which heredity have fixed upon it
are severely strained. A plant accus
tomed in a wild state to a moist soil will
have difficulty in growing in a dry situa
tion.
If the theory advanced to explain the
damage at Napa is correct the simple rem
edy is surface irrigation in the case of
vineyards already grafted to Riparia stock
when a long, hot stretch of weather oc
curs, or, in the case of new plantings, the
use of vines which send their roots deeper.
As the Riparia is an excellent stock, it may
I be expected to thrive in soils and climates
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
which approximate those to which it is
accustomed in its native state.
Of course the vineyards of Napa repre
sent but a very small proportion of the
area in the State demoted to vines, and
hence the damage to the State is too small
for consideration. At the same time the
condition of affairs there demands the
most careful study. No threat to any of
the vineyard and orchard interests of Cali
fornia has ever arisen but that means were
promptly found to avert it. This will be
the case with the Napa vineyards.
A GREAT VICTORY.
The Republican party of California in
convention assembled at Sacramento did
a mighty work for itself when it wheeled
upon Martin Kelly and the would-be
bosses of the party and routed them
horse, foot and dragoons. Those men
traveled to Sacramento for the one pur
pose of carrying away the district ma-*
chinery of the party in their pockets, but
they did not carry it away. In fact, they
were not permitted to touch it. And the
squelching of them was undertaken with
so much determination and the work was
so thoroughly done that the party may be
assured that no little or bie rings will at
tempt to put on the robe of dictator for
awhile. It was a great victory for the
party over an element that has no loftier
purpose than what "boss" and "the spoils
of oftice" stand for.
Although this good work was accom
plished by the splendid generalship of
John D. Spreckels, it must not be forgot
ten that he was seconded and loyally sus
tained by men as determined as himself
to save the party from the ward boss and
the for-revenue-only politician.
The professionals were sanguine of vic
tory an hour before they were vanquished.
Their plans had been carefully and adroitly
laid and they already had begun to strut
about and with condescension permit sug
gestions to be made to them. But their
self-sufficiency so blinded them that they
did not see the host of indignant and deter
mined Republicans moving down upon
them to smite them hip and thigh, and
when they were struck they fell like autumn
leaves all withered. It was a great victory
for Republicanism in California, and it is
the kind of a purification that will make the
party healthier and stronger every way.
Besides, the fact has been emphasized that
there is no room anywhere in the Republi
can party of this State for "dictator,"
'boss" or office broker.
THE TRANSFER NUISANCE.
The transfer system at the junction of
Market and Powell streets has been in
operation sufficiently long lor an estimate
of its value to be made. In all fairness, it
should be considered that as yet the peo
ple are not thoroughly used to it; that the
hardships and inconveniences arising from
It tnay be mollified by time, and that the
human family has a happy disposition to
submit to evils which there is no earthly
power to correct. Under no circumstances
of habit or custom, however, can the system
be otherwise than exceedingly annoying.
This is how the matter must always be
regarded from the citizen's point of view.
There is another side to the storyâ that
of the street railway company. The sys
tem was established for the alleged reason
that passengers approaching the junction
with no intention of pursuing their jour
nay beyond it took transfers and gave
them outright to the newsboys assembled
at the junction. The boys then gave
away the transfers to purchasers of papers,
so that two persons were enabled to travel
over the company's roads on one fare.
The company pretended to have made a
careful estimate of the number of trans
lers thus fraudulently imposed upon it,
and arrived at the conclusion that it would
be cheaper to maintain four or five trans
fer agents at the junction and compel the
City to furnish a number of policemen at
its own expense to prevent outbursts of
anger over the impossibility of the transfer
agents to handle the business. It will be
observed that the main point in the mat
t er was not taken into account for a mo
ment by the company. That was the con
venience of the public. Tbe scenes of
crowding, scrambling, swearing, hustling
and bruising of women and the tearing of
their clothes, to say nothing of the confu
sion and errors and loss of money on the
part of the people who had not mastered
the intricacies of the system, found no
place in the consideration of the company.
That the revenues of the company have
been largely increased by the new arrange
ment cannot be doubted. Aside from the
extra nickels it secures through errors and
misconceptions on the part of the passen
gers, there are undoubtedly many who
would rather pay an extra fare than enter
the scramble for a transfer ticket at the
junction. That is the whole case as it
stands at present. The one great princi
ple involved in it is that the people, either
individually or in municipal organization,
have not the least word to say in the prem
ises. That is the one serious feature of
the matter.
USE HOME MATERIAL.
In holding up the bands of the Harbor
Commissioners in their purpose to use
Colusa stone for the new ferry depot, the
Manufacturers' Association indorse the
sentiment of the people of California gener
ally. It is freely admitted on all sides
that Colusa rock is as well adapted for that
use as any foreign stone : besides, the ferry
depot is a State work, and certainly ma
terial that is the product of California
should be used when it is as good as the
best that could be obtained elsewhere.
There is another aspect of the question
of where the stone shall be procured that
is to be considered". If Colusa stone is
used the money paid for it will immedi
ately enter our own channels of trade and
be carried to home dealers in merchandise,
provisions and other articles of commerce,
while on the other hand if the money is
paid to an outside stone company it will
be carried beyond our own trade circles,
and California would then be a party to
building up foreign quarries and mer
chants at the expense of her own people.
It is not the business of a commonwealth
to do anything of the kind with money it
expends on public improvements for which
the people are taxed.
On general principles, therefore, home
stone quarries, home merchants and home
wage-earners should have all the benefit
possible from the construction of this
public work. In fact, it would be a reflec
tion upon our business sense and capacity
to do business to go away from home for
material that is no better, at least, than
we have at our door. Besides, the ferry
depot is an enterprise of the State and at
the expense of tbe State, and in all reason
tbe people of the State ought to have the
benefits accruing from this expenditure of
their own money.
The Detroit Tribune in defending the
funding bill and Huntington's reputation
for honesty says: "The courts in Califor
nia are open for business every day in the
year. They stand ready at all times to
try criminals of all sorts who come within
their jurisdiction." Exactly so, but the
Tribune forgets that Huntington has been
wary enough to get a Kentucky franchise
aud escape California's jurisdiction.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
George A. Pteele of Portland, who for years
has occupied a high place in the politics aud
finances of Oregon, is at the Grand.
He is one of the alternates to the Repub
lican National Convention at St. Louis, has
been Treasurer of Multnomah County, Post
master at Portland, Deputy Collector of the
Port, member of the State Senate, and was
chairman of the Republican State Central
Committee which went out of office at the
time of the State Convention just held. He
had been Chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee before.
Mr. Steele has lived in Oregon thirty-three
years. He went there by way of San Francisco,
from Ohio, when but 16 years old. Since then
he has acquired large property.
He is president and superintendent of the
East Side Electric Railway, a road which he

thinks is the best and longest on tlte Pacific
Coast. It reaches from Portland proper, over
the Willamette Rivet and through what used
to be East Portland, to Oregon City, and it
also has a line to Mount Tabor, the entire
length being twenty-two miles. Said Mr.
Steele:
"I think it is the finest electric road on the
Pacific Coast, and we take a good deal of
pride in it. It is very solidly built, aud alto
gether it is a splendid electric system.
"In regard to business in Oregon it is fair.
It is picking up a little. It can't be any worse
than it was for a time, and 1 think now that it
will gradually improve till we get back ou tne
good basis we were a few years ago. It has
been a delightful winter there, except in
April, when it got quite unpleasant.
"In Oregon we are for what is called sound
money. We arc not for free silver coinage, or
approaching it, as the Republicans fire here.
Only the Populists are for that there. We
want protection there more than auything
else, and unless the country gets it, in my
judgment, we are going to see very hard
times. With it we will gradually come out of
our financial difficulties.
"I only came down for a brief stay. I must
get btclc soon to fix up tbe road between Ore
gon City ami Gladstone, the latter being a
mile and a half from Oregon City. There
is a magnificent grove of fir and otner
trees there, capable of accommodating 50,000
people. It is there that the Cbautauqua Asso
ciation meets. An egg-shaped auditorium has
been built there which holds 3000 people
aloue, and besides this there is an enormous
platform capable of accommodating large
numbers."
Mr. Steele was Postmaster of Portland for
nine years and served in the State Senate four
years. He is one of the solid representative
men of Oregon, and is known to almost every
one in the three or four Northwestern States.

AN ELEVEN-GORED SKIRT FOR
SILKS.
The most satisfactory way of making the
handsome skirts of silk and satin now so much
worn is with several gores, so that each gore
can be cut out of one breadth of the material
in one piece. Where fewer gores are used they
are of necessity wider, aud the silk or satin
must bo pieced out to get the width.
A skirt which is six and a half yards round
the foot and has eleven gores Is shown above.
It U designed especially for silks and narrow
fabrics, none of the gores measuring more than
twenty-two inches at the widest part. It is a
delightfully graceful skirt, and looks equally
well in any fabric, and never gets out of shape,
as the gores are cut with a straight edge to
meet a bias one at all the seams, excepting in
the back, where the gores are straight through
the center, with a stay at each seam.
A skirt of Dresden silk in reseda green with
bright colored flowers and leaves in sbadowy
outlines, and narrow stripes of black satin at
intervals of two Inches, was worn with a black
satin coat of the Louis XVI style. This had a
vest of chiifon which harmonized with tho
skirt, having the same design of roses and
leaves woven in. A bright green satin stock
with four larger loops at the back finished the
neck, with a belt of the same at the full vest
front
A skirt of white taffetas with narrow black
stripes had two-inch bands of black satin ribbon
down each seam. This was overlaid with a
heavy white band of lace not quite so wide.
The effect was chic in the extreme, this being
worn with a waist to match.
A skirt of black grenadine lined with tender-
leaf green silk, had a piping of the silk at each
seam.
A black satin skirt had a h andsome applique
design in jet and green spangles, which
crossed the foot of the front breadth, and
reached to the waist in a graceful tapering
design over the seams of theirom breadth.
Some of the new skiits are trimmed with
narrow braid at the foot, set on in straight
rows, or forming a small design at each seam.
Four of the eleven gores in this skirt are
gathered at the back, or may be laid in box
pleats.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Early in June San Francisco will have an op
portunity of judging whether Ellen Beach Yaw
is one of the most remarkable singers of this or
any other age, or whether she is only a vocal
freak. Papers all over the country have de
voted columns and columns to Miss Yaw. The
immense range of her voice has been heralded
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and there is
no disputing the fact that musical history does
not record anywhere a range that equals Miss
Yaw's, for she can sing E above the high E.
This girl, who hails irom Los Angeles, is said
to possess a unique personality. She is slen
der, graceful, a decided blonde, with a classic
face and clear blue eyes. There is something
spirituelle in both her appearance and her
voice. She is said by those who know her to
be unassuming, and not anxious for the many
"puffs" which her press agents have thrust
upon her. At the close of her present tour
Miss Yaw will probably make a long visit to
her mother in Los Angeles.
A Florentine newspaper tells of an exploit
achieved by a pianist which is remarkable
though the virtuoso might have devised better
means for employing his time and talent. It
says: "Camillo Baucia of Cuneo proposed to
play forty-six hours consecutively, only taking
three rests of ten minutes each. A jury was con
vened to mount guard over him, and on Satur
day at 4 o'clock M. Baucia commenced his
feat by playing the 'Royal March,' after which
he gave selections from 'Faust,' 'Carmen,'
'Mignon,' etc., as well as sonatas by Schubert
and a number of ballabilli, all the time talking
to visitors without any apparent preoccupa
tion. During the whole of his tour de force,
he took nothing more solid than the yolks of
eggs, though he drank a good deal of Marsala
and coffee. On Sunday morning he felt out of
sorts and was twice obliged to take ten min
utes' rest, but he set to work again, confident
that he would accomplish his task. The citi
zens crowded to see him, especially in the
afternoon ol Monday, when at 4 o'clock Baucia
completed his forty-eight hours' record. His
health was good and his pulse regular." The
pianist has succeeded in getting himself a
good deal talked of, but art has certainly not
benefited by his feat.
German singing, and German singers seem
to have Deen getting the cold shoulder lately.
The Damrosch Opera Company, brought into
sharp contrast, as it was, with the Abbey,
Schoeffel & Grau Company in New York,
called down the maledictions of the critics on
the s.nging of the principals, for their "school"
contrasted very poorly with the finished vocal
ization of the singers of the French and Ital
ian schools, aud now a wail is heard from Ger
many that even Bayreuth, the temple of Wag
nerian opera, is rapidly being invaded by for
eigners whose school of singing is not of the
German variety. Kordica reaped s good many
laurels there, and it looks as if the De Iteszke
brothers were going to take more glory from
acknowledged Wagnerian singers. Some of
Ihe German newspapers are waxing wrathy
and pathetic over this Invasion of foreigners
into the very citadel of German art. There is
a very simple remedy, however. If the rising
Alvarys, Klafskys, etc., would study the art of
singing, instead, of relying on their magnifi
cent natural voices and their acting, there
woula be no need of foreigners at Bayreuth.
Under the title of "Music in Prison," Le
Menestrel is giving an interesting series of
articles showing how many distinguished pris
oners have whiled away the weary hours of
imprisonment by singing and playing. "In
the study which we have given to this sub
ject, which was before the Napoleonic crazo
Miss Ellen Beach Yaw, the Los Angeles Singer Who Will Be Heard Here Next Jnn*.
broke out in the libraries and the magazines,"
says Le Menestrel, "we have found by investi
gation that the First Napoleon enjoyed a dilet
tantism for music which has generally been
denied him. During, his captivity at Saint-
Helena he devoted a small portion of each day
to the study of music, but could not spare
much more, for he had to defend his glory,
and death did not even leave him time to do
that. When his health began to give way he
suffered from attacks of delirium, but during
these attacks he sang incessantly a number of
arias, and always in the Italian language, for
before the end he turned again to the language
of his youth." It seems that the Third Na
poleon was helped to support the incarceration
which followed the disaster of Sedan by listen
ing to the music of Offenbach, of whom in his
days of prosperity he had been one of the
warmest patrons.
The day following the death of Ambroise
Thomas the directors of the Paris Grand Opera
resolved to raise a monument to his memory
at their own cost. The work was entrusted to
the sculptor, M. Falguieres, and that gentle
man has just submitted his model. It repre
sents Ambroise Thomas seated on a rock, no
doubt in memory of his great affection for his
rocky island of Iliec, where he composed so
much of his music. At the foot of the rock
Ophelia, in white marble, is holding him a
bunch of flowers. The work is effective and
artistic, but one would like to see Mignon
figure there, too, lor if "Hamlet" is the most
popular of Thomas' works with artists,
"Mignon" is the opera which made him popu
lar with the masses.
Catulle Mendez, a well-known writer of
French stories, many of which are seasoned
with vice, recently gave a lecture in Paris at
one ol the Colonne concerts on Berlioz and
Wagner. He commenced by wandering off to
an address on the Apochrypha, and the
audience, which was waiting to hear about
Berlioz, made such a disturbance that the
police forbade him to continue till after the
concert. A great many people stayed, and in
a relative calm Mendez talked about Wagner,
whom he compared, without mincing matters,
to the Divinity. This gave great offense to the
listeners, particularly as most of the audience
were impatient to hear Berlioz praised.
American pianos are generally supposed to
be the most brilliant in the world, and it is
partly to intensify this brilliancy that they
are frequently pitched so high. If singers
realized the strain that the very high pitch
puts on their voices we should hear some
thing in this country of the agitation which
has been going on in England in favor of tha
adoption of a lower pitch. The agitation has
been lost in England, a*, to adopt a lower
pitch would mean a great outlay in purchas
ing new wind instruments for the bands. In
private homes, however, there is no need to
adopt a pitch which makes vocalists sing the
music of some of the older masters a semi
tone higher than it was written.
A society has been formed in London for the
suppression of useless noises in the street. It
aims especially at "tne most costly and the
most useless of noises," which is, according to
the well-known definition, the noise of music.
The strains of hand organs and German bands
which infest the United Kingdom are to be
regulated or suppressed by act of Parliament,
if the society can get its way. A law to that
effect is now being framed, and It will be pre
sented next session.
A Florentine newspaper, LoStaffale, tells the
following rather extraordinary piece of musi
cal news: "An original idea of the maestro
Giordano has been carried out in bis opera
'Andre Chenier,' which has met with a favor
able reception in Milan. The work from the .
first to the last note is all written in the same
key." If Lo Staffale is correct in its informa
tion "Andre Chenier" must be a very monoto
nous cpera.
EIGHTY THOUSAND FRIENDS.
That Is the Number Gained by "Tne
Call " on Woman Suffrage.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
In saying that The Call has gained eighty
thousand friends among the Populists of Cali
fornia by openly and earnestly declaring for
woman suffrage I am certain it is a conservative
statement, and I shall refer to the Populist
votes polled next November, every one of
which will be for the proposed amendment to
grant the elective franchise to woman, as proof
that my statement is conservative. Populists
themselves believe that their whole conten
tion as a party is based on simple justice, and
no argument is needed to convince them that
justice demands the right of the elective fran
chise for women as well as men and on exactly
the same terms. There is no other party, there
has never been another pur'.y, that has at one*
accepted woman suffrage as a matter of course,
and the explanation is found in the fact al
ready intimated that the whole plea, purpose
and spirit of the People's party find expression
in tne demand for social justice.
The bitter experience of the People's party
in Colorado on the suffrage question was
naturally a good deal taken to heart by Popu
lists all over the country. It is assumed that
the readers of The Call and especially Miss
Anthony, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,
Miss Severance and other noble women who
are especially enlisted in the advocacy of this
plain measure of justice, are familiar with the
fact that the Populists of Colorado gave women
the right to vote and that noble old Roman,
Governor Waite, affirmed the action of the
Legislature with his official signature. It is
equally certain that it could be demonstrated,
if this were the plate for it, that the women
thusenfranchised "turned down" the Populists
at the next succeeding election and returned
the party to power which for thirty years have
refused the ballot to women. While this is a
bitter experience and is somewhat exasperat
ing, I think I am safe in saying that it has not
changed a single Populist vote in opposition
to woman's claim to political equality with
man at the ballot-box. If this should seem
incredible to some readers^ they may find a
basis for credulity In the intense feeling
ever present in the heart of a true Populist
that there is no hope for the future of the Re
public except in a return to the rule and
actual practice of social justice by the Govern
ment of this country.

THE BREWERY TROUBLE.
Boss Becrmaken Will He Asked to
Show Their Colors.
Within the next few days the brewery
workmen's unions' fight will reach a
point where decisive action must be taken
by all parties interested. The workmen
demand a recognition of their union, and
the trouble over this point has draeged
along over four years. Since Joseph
Walters has been in the position of secre
tary he has worked hard to bring about an
amicable settlement with the boss brewers,
but so far without any perceptible results!
The matter has now gone into the hands
of the San Francisco Trades Council, and
yesterday the executive committee of that
body met with the executive committee of
the union. A special committee of three
consisting of Thunnan, McArthur and
Walters, was appointed to visit every boss
brewer and learn from him his attitude
toward the union. Those who express
themselves favorable to the union will be
called upon to declare themselves, and a
declaration of sentiment will be reauired
of those against. If the difficulty can be
settled all well and good, but if not the
committee will start the fight by declaring
a boycott upon one of the breweries where
a workingruan's boycott will do the roost
barm.

WOMEN MAY SIT
IN CONVENTION,
The Episcopalian Committee
on Credentials Accepts
Them.
SECRETARY EOOE TALES
He Says When the Ladies An
swer the Rollcall They Will
Be Seated.
A CATHEDRAL IS TALKED OF.
Bishop Nichols and the Standing Com
mittee Empowered to Advance
the Scheme.
The usual number of clergy and of male
lay delegates answered the rollcall at the
second day's session of the Episcopal con
vention in Grace Church yesterday, but
iEV. M. D. WILSO>, TUE NEW SECRETARY OF THE EPISCOPAL DIOCESE.
Jhe lady delegates again refrained from
answering to their names. The commit
tee on credentials has passed on all these
lady delegates and has accepted them, the
decision being that when any lady dele
gate answers the rollcall she shall be
seated on the floor with the other dele
gates.
Speaking on this subject yesterday,
George Hook, assistant secretary of the
diocese, and a member of the committee
on credentials, said :
"The statement in The Call of to-day is
perfectly correct. According to the amend
ment of the canon, made last year, ladies
are entitled to vote. The committee on
credentials which passed upon the dele
gates accepted all the ladies, and resolved
that if they answered the rollcall they
should be seated upon the floor.
"Any opposition which might be caused
by this act would call for a vote of the
convention as a whole. The ladies are not
officially here unless they answer the
rollcall, and so far but one of them
has brought the question to an issue by
doing so.
"I do not think there would be any de
cided opposition if the ladies were seated
among the other delegates. There mieht
be a few protests here and there, but I be
lieve the convention as a whole would be in
favor of accepting them, as the committee
on credentials has already done. No one
questions the fact of woman being now
entitled to vote for vestrymen, etc., and
sooner or later the convention will have
to face the question of whether the right
to vote entities to a seat in the convention.
The situation may not have to be faced at
this convention, but it will undoubtedly
come up before very long."
It is Mr. Hook's opinion that the ques
tion will not have to be faced by this con
vention. Questioning among the delegates
revealed the fact, however, that it may
come up to-day, for W. C. Ambroise, a dele
gate from St. John's Mission Church, Tu
lare, who is a delegate from the same mis
sion, will be pre .en t to-day and intends to
answer the roilci 11.
A good deal of business of interest .to
the diocese was transacted yesterday. The
morning session, after motions, opened
with the report of the special committee
on a T>lan of assessment for diocesan ex
penses. For the last three years the vari
ous churches have been assessed a certain
percentage on their incomes, derived from
pew rents, offertories and pledges.
The substance of the minority report was
to give this plan a longer trial. The ma
jority report of the committee of seren,
appointed by the last convention, was pre
pared by Rev. F. J. Mynard, Rev. J. A.
Emery, Rev. F. H. Church, H. C. Davis,
William Van Bokkelen and Rev. W. H.
Moreiand, and this report proposed to
assess each parish or mission upon the
basis of its current expenses.
William Van Bckkelen. who presented
the reoort favoring the latter plan of as
sessment, said the sliding-scale was less
iiard on poor parishes, and that it made
the rich parishes bear their share of the
burden better. He added that for the last
three years the finance committee had
been ignoring the canons and lightening
the burden on the poor parishes.
Rev. Robert R. Richie spoke against the
proposed new system, saying that it would
hamper parish benevolence. Rev. John
Emery said the old system was an unjust
one, as a number of parishes raised their
incomes by other means than offertories,
pew-rents and pledges. On a motion be
ing put to the house both reports were re
jected, but William Van Bokkelin moved a
reconsideration of his report and this be
ing carried, Rev. Dr. Spaldinc amended it
by inserting the statement that in assess
ing each parish or mission according to
current expenses, these expenses were not
to include money paid on mortgages or on
permanent improvements. The amend
ment was accepted and the report was
adopted almost unanimously.
TvÂ« Bishop's annual address, which con
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
eluded the morninc session, contained a
number of suggestions of great interest to
the diocese. The need of a cathedral was
especially dwelt on. Bishop Nichols urged
some immediate steps bcine taken toward
securing one. "A cathedral organization
should interpret the best interplay of cleri
cal and lay functions in our American
church life, and find right adjustment to
noble work loi Christ's poor and Christ's
riob. A cathedral building should be
typical of the best architectural genius
and of the consecration of outpoured
riches for its cost.
"There may be approaches to the
cathedral idea, especially from the side of
its missionary agencies, and I would
recommend that the Bishop and standing
committee be designated as a permanent
committee, to consider the matter of a
cathedral and report from time to time
anything bearing upon it, with power to
take any stg*>a toward it that in their
judgment may seem wise." In the after
noon this hint was acted upon, for, upon
motion of Rev. Dr. Foute, the matter of
taking steps toward securing a cathedral
at some future date was referred to the
Bishop and the standing committee for
future action.
Other matters touched upon in the
Bishop's address were the need of a clergy
retreat and of an archdeacon for mission
ary work. A tribute was paid to the gen
erosity of the Jate George W. Gibbs, and
the suggestion was made that the question
of arranging a division of the funded en
dowments between this diocese and that
of Los Angeles be left for adjustment to
the special committee which had already
been acting.
The afternoon session opened with the
consideration of the reports presented by
the committee to arrange for an equable
division of the trust funds of the two dio
ceses of Los Angeles and California.
Before the reports were discussed Henry
E. Highton made a motion that the
division of the funds, between the two
dioceses, be referred to the finance com
mittee, consisting of W. B. Hooper, D. M.
Kent, S. V. Smith and L. M. Ringwald,
supplemented by Rev. John Bakewell and
A. W. Drown. This being put to the vote
the committee was empowered unani-
I mously to settle the matter with repre
sentatives from the diocese of Los Angeles.
The rest of the afternoon was occupied
with special reports and missionary ad
dresses.
Rev. R. B. Snalding, in his report of the
committee on Christian education, strongly
decried the pomilar idea that the church's
work is limited to parishes and missions.
He said that even the building of hos
pitals and sending out of missionaries are
not sufficient, for the church's work is
educational. "And yet," he asked, "what
is our cburch doing to-day to fulfill the
need that is actually pressing upon
her for the training of the young? Indi
vidual efforts there have been for the
cause of education, but the church as a
body would seem to be slumbering on.
"Your committee Delieves that in a
church as practical as our own tb<; need of
organization is pressing; that we have
reached a time when individual effort
should be guided and controlled and
schools should be established and organ
ized as best to meet the demand upon us."
The report concluded with the state
ment that not one of the church schools
in the diocese could at present be made
the nucleus of a future provincial system,
as not one is incorporated. "Youf com
mittee believes that our present schools
should he incorporated at once."
Rev. A. L. Brewer reported for the
Church Divinity School of the Pacific that
the work is steadily growing. He also re
ported tbat St. Margaret's School at San
Mateo is doing good work as well as St.
Mathew's School for boys and the Irving
Institute. A prosperous year was also re
ported for Trinity School.
The annual report of the board of mis
sions was read by Rev. John A. Emery.
Certain financial changes were recom
mended as a necessary result of the di
vision of California into two dioceses. The
need for a missionary archdeacon was also
dwelt upon.
Rev. William Lncai, dean of the Ban
Joaquin convocation, and Rev. F. J.
Mynard, dean of the San Francisco convo
cation, read their reports, and the report
of the convocation of San Jose was read
by the dean, Rev. C. O. Tollatson.
Rev. de Wolf Cowie of San Mateo being
called upon by the Bishop to give a mis
sionary address, responded by outlining
the history of Episcopal missions in this
country. As an instance of the results
achieved by missions he alluded to a con
vention which is shortly to be held in Lon
don to celebrate the thirteen hundredth
anniversary of the landing of Augustine
and his monks in Kent to convert the
Saxons to Christianity.
As an outcome of the seed planted by
three monks 1300 years ago there will as
semble in London next year bishops from
the United States. Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and Africa.
Rev. C. M. Hoge of Monterey in the
course of an address on missions said:
"The spirit of union is spreading from de
nomination to denomination." Rev. J. S.
McGowan of Fresisy Flats also made a
missionary address.
The report of the committee on church
charities, made by Rev. Edgar J. Lion,
showed St. Luke's Hospital to be in a sat
isfactory condition, but the Old Ladies'
Home was stated to be in some stringency
for want of ready money. The other char
ities were all reported to be flourishing.
After the reading of this report the con
vention adjourned to meet at 10 a. m. to
day.
The Bishop of California and Mrs. Nich
ols will hold a reception at the Occidental
Hotel this evening from 8 to 11. At this
reception it is expected that the Bishop of
Los Anceles will be present. Ail the mem
bers of the convention, all visitors and all
chinch people of San Francisco are cor
dially invited.

SINGLE TAW
HEAVY ARTILLERY.
The Pledge Now Pleases
Manufacturers and
Ship-Owners.
BOOM WOMAN SUFFRAGE
Demand Free Pilotage for Ships
Entering and Leaving
the Harbor.
WARM PRAISE FOR "THE CALL."
Attorney Leggett Heartily Commends
Its Stand on the Woman Suf
frage Question.
The sirgle-taxers have brought their ar
tillery to the front and firing is going on
all along the line. There have been meet
ings of boards, committees and other busi
ness bodies, and much work, importarvj
as regards the propagation of the doctrine,
has been carried out.
Besides there has been renewed activity
in the circulation of the petition sent out
by the National Single-Tax committee,
and the leaders of the movement in Cal
ifornia have most favorable reports to
make.
At the last meeting of the executive
committee of the San Francisco Single-
Tax Society the pledge for voters to sign
was slightly modified.
"Singie-taxers were well enough satis
fied with the pledge a? it read," said At
torney Joseph Leg.gett, National Coni
mitteeman from California, "as they ex
actly understand the meaning of the
phrase, 'which will open the way to single
tax legislation.'
"But its meaning is not so clear to many
others who are as much in favor of amend
ing article XIII as the single-taxers
themselves. The obstacle in the way of
securing such exemptions as are desired
by the Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation is precisely the same as that
which hinders the single- taxers."
The modified pledge reads as follows*
"I hereby promise that 1 will vote only
for such candidate? for the Senate and As
sembly as are pledged in writing to sub
mit a constitutional amendment giving to
the Legislature full power over the subject
of taxation."
Mr. Le^'gett then spoke as follows in ex
planation and elucidation of the subject:
"If full power over the subject of taxa
tion is given to the Legislature the manu
facturers and ship-owners can by the
passage of an act of the Legislature secure
at once such exemptions as they desire
without waiting two years for an oppor
tunity to submit the proposition to a vote
of the people.
"In all their efforts to secure such ex
emptions they can confideutly rely upon
the aid of the eingle-taxers. The modified
form of the pledge is equally satisfactory
to the single-taxers, because it will open
the way for such advanced legislation as
they may be able to induce the Legisla
ture to enact.
"The single-taxer's method is to lop off
a tax on industry or a fine on enterprise
and thrift wherever he has a chance, and
he is ever ready to co-operate heartily
with any one who is willing to take a step
â however short â in that direction.
"The pledge was modified with a view
to secure the co-operation and assistance
of the manufacturers and ship-owners in
circulating it and in getting it signed. If
the pledge is properly handled in this
City, there will not be a single member of
its delegation in the next Legislature who
will dare to vote against the proposed
amendment to article XIII.
"The single-taxers may be relied on to
do their share of this work, and it is to be
hoped that the manufacturers and ship
owners will not fail to do theirs. The
patent absurdity of seeking to protect
manufactures and commerce by Federal
legislation, and at the same time doing
our best to cripple and destroy them by
State taxation, ought not to be longer per
mitted.
"The first thing to be done to secure a
just and rational system of taxation is to
give jurisdiction of the subject to the
Legislature. With that point attained,
the battle will be more than half won.
"To accomplish that there oueht to be
an effort on the part of all who are seek
ing to build op the State and its enter
prises."
Attorney James L. Reynolds spoke in
the same strain. When asked what the
single-taxers would strive for to benefit
San Francisco in case article XIII should
be amended, he answered :
"What would we strive for? Why, for
the abolition of all taxes on personal prop
erty, of course. That is, primarily. But
there are many special things in the exist
ing state of affairs that tend to hold San
Francisco behind in the race for pros
perity, and we would attack these first.
"For instance, ships are obliged to take
a pilot on board and pay a high price for
his services when they enter this port
whether they wish to or not. They have
to do the same thing on leaving. Then
there is wharfage to pay and a host of
other things that tend to discourge com
merce.
"Do you know, it is my firm belief that
if the tax were taken off men's business
the condition of affairs would soon be so
prosperous that the revenue arising from
the enhanced value of ground property
would not only suffice for the expenses of
running the municipality, but would give
a large enough surplus to pay for pilots to
conduct ships in and out of the harbor.
All other expenses would be done away
with as well.
"Then ships laden with the spices of the
Orient, craft filled with the products of the
tropics, and, in fact, vessels bearing the
product^ peculiar to all countries, would
flock here as they never did before. It
would mean a revival of commerce, a rush
in business, and steady, enduring pros
perity. This is the object ."ingle-taxers
have in view in their struggle for the
amendment to article XIII."
"What is the attitude of single-taxers
in regard to the enfranchisement of
women? Does it vary with the man or
are Bingle-taxers a unit on the question?"
"As to that,'' said Attorney Leggett
with a broad smile, "I think I can answer
for all of us. Now," waxing earnest,
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
"single-taxers cannot consistently with
their principles be opposed to woman
suffrage.
"Any one who comprehends and accepts
the fundamental doctrines of the single
tax philosophy must recognize the right
of women to vote. And as a matter of fact
I believe all single-taxers are woman
suffragists, or iv apter phrase, equal
suffragists.
"When a single-taxer is asked if he oe
lieves in giving women the right to vote,
he says it is not a question of right. He
recognizes the truth that every woman
who has attained her majority has as
much right to vote as he has. Let us stop
depriving her of the right.
"Hair-splitting distinctions between
natural and artificial rights are wholly un
profitable and begging the question. She
is bound to obey the laws equally with
man; she is equally interested with him
in the welfare of society, whicn is insured
by good laws; and she is compelled to bear
equally with him the calamities and mise
ries that follow in the train of bad laws.
"The single-taxers of California take a
deep and earnest interest in the progress
of the movement in favor of the equal
suffrage amendment, and will, I believe,
to a man vote for it election day.
"All the single-taxers of my acquaint
ance are greatly delighted with the noole
stand taken by The Call on this ques
tion."
"EXPLORING THE AIR."
A Lecture Last Night by Forecaster
BlcAdie Before the Geograph
ical Society.
Weather Forecaster McAdie lectured
last evening at Union Square Hall before
the Geographical Society of the Pacific
upon "Exploring the Atmosphere." He
illustrated his lecture with excellent
stereopticon views of the different phases
of the air. Regarding kite observation he
stated that with a number of the Malay
kites flown in tandem an aluminum ther
mograph weighing two pounds had been
kept at an elevation of 2000 feet for two
hours and it registered a much higher air
temperature tban tbat at the g:ound.
On the subject of clouds he spoke in
turn of the iracto-uimbus thundercloud:
The water in these airy billows may be
cooled below the lreezing point and not
frozen. A snowflake or ice-crystal falling into
it m4y suffice to start a sudden congelation
just as we see ice needles dart in all directions
when'the chilled surface of a still pond is dis
turbed. We liken this monstrous cloud to a
huge gun loaded and quiet, but with a trigcer
so delicately Bet that a falling snowflake would
discharge it. From an electrical standpoint,
the thunderstorm aud the snowstorm are
almost identical.
We are living between the coatings of a
great condenser or Leyden jar, the upper
coating of which is the sky, the lower coating
the earth, and the air the dielectric between.
Ordinarily and happily for us the speaking
distance is too great, still in the United States
nearly 200 lives are lost by the lightning
strike.
BOOTH-TUCKER'S KISSES,
They Were Laid on His Con
valescent Wife's Lips
in Public.
Arrival on This Coast of the New
Commander of the American
Salvation Army.
Booth-Tucker, commander of the Ameri
can forces of the Salvation Army, successor
to Ballington Booth, walked upon the
stape at Metropolitan Temple last night
shortly after 10 o'clock and kissed his wife,
whose illness had called him across the
continent. It was not as warm a kiss
| either as the audience expected and the
commander immediately turned and
apologized, laughingly of course, saying
that he had been separated from her for
three weeks, which was awful; that he was
glad of the circumstances that had given
him an excuse for getting away from New
Yorfc and making the run out here to join
her.
He then turned and said, "How are you,
my darling?" and she smiled and nodded,
indicating that she was as well as she
looked to be. The audience applauded.
Then be turned and resumed, or rather
becan a fifteen minute Salvation Army
address.
It was not what the audience expected.
Metropolitan Temple was crowded and
the services for two hours had been in the
nature of a curtain raiser preliminary to
the arrival of the commander, who was ex
pected not later than 8:30.
His train was tardy and the consul, his
wife, ill, as 3he was compelled to speak
twice. Brigadier Keppel employed a great
deal of time recovering a snorta^e in the
collection; a baby was dedicated to the
cause by the consul under the united flags
of the array and the United States in a
very pretty ceremony; Major Lewis
made a most effective address; Major
Malan, t!ie singer, followedâ and the
audience all the time waiting for the com
mander to come and greet his sick wife.
And when be came he apologized for
kissing her â which he did not do wiih half
: the fervor which the audience, trained to
! blood and fire ideas, absolute sincerity and
I disregard for appearances in the face of
any number of people, expected him to do.
Booth-Tucker, however, has a winning,
smiling face of evident sincerity and earn
estness. He is above 50 in appearance;
thin, gray-haired, but full of active vital
ity.
He came directly from the train and
came up on the stage, as he said, "just as I
am, without one plea." He made no refer
ence in bis talk to the affairs of the army,
except to say that he had told the general
he wished some other had been made
commander here; but having been ordered
to this post he expected greater victories
than ever before. He had taken out nat
uralization papers and expected to be the
next best citizen of the United States to
the consul, who would be the best.
To-moirow afternoon he will meet the
Auxiliary Army at 3 o'clock; to-morrow
evening another and the last public meet
ing of the series will be held in Metropolitan
Temple, and Friday morning he will meet
with the officers of the army â to the ex
clusion of othersâ and talk of army af
fairs.
CHINESE AS GLAZIERS.
Mongolians Take the Places of White
Menâ Railway Kmploye*.
At a meeting of the glaziers last evening
several grievances were laid before the
union by its members. One report was
that two large sash factories are eraploy-
I me Chinamen to do their glazing in pre
ference to white men. Another report
was that a contractor employed a China
man to do the glazing work on a new
building. The union's delegates to the
Building Trades Council were instructed
to lay the matter belore that body tor in
vestigation and action. Efforts will be
made to unionize all the shops in the City.
Several new members were initiated.
At the meeting of the local American
Railway Union la^t evening the following
officers were installed: President, G. W.
West: vice- president, O. P. Waldon; sec
retary, C. J.Deseda; treasurer, D. Scnafer.
The annual report of the secretary showed
that the union is in a better condition
than it has been since the strike. The
treasury is in a good condition and the
membership is muc i larger than is gener
ally supposed by the railroad companies.

side yesterday. San Mateo, who repre
sented the richest strains of American
thoroughbred blood through his sire, Bal
vator, once king of the turf, came out on
top, but only by a narrow margin. As
t lie wire was passed the stubborn little
Englishman nt his side, who had gamely
stood a drive for one quarter of a mile un
flinchingly, was catching him at every
stride, and had the distance to travel been
twenty yards further, the victory would
have been his.
The match was the result of a banter be
tween the two younp millionaire turfmen,
vValter liobart and W. 08. Macdonough.
Mr. Macdonough gained fame in the world
of turf as the man who had the temerity
to pay $150,000 for a horseâ Ormonde, the
pride of all England.
Orestes, his son, is the first of the get of
this equine monarch to face the issue on
the American turf, and Mr. Macdonough
is very proud of the finely chiseled
yotutcstor who is sometimes referred to as
;i miniature lxtgan. On bothjocrasions of
his appearance before the public Orestes
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, 'THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
was unfortunate in beginning slow and
was unplaced at each trial. On May day
he finished fifth in a four-furlong dash
won by San Mateo. He had shown high
trials in private, and Owner Macdonougn,
confident that his colt could do better, of
fered to match him against San Mateo.
Aft-r some beating about the bush the
youngsters were matched at four and a
half furlongs for $1000 a side, the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club giving $1000 additional.
The major portion of racegoers thought
it a mere cake-walk for San Mateo, and in
the betting at the track yesterday the ring
held him at 2 to 5, with worlds of 2 to 1
offered against Orestes. In the grand
stand aristocratic-looking Orestes was the
favorite with the thousands of the fair sex
who graced "laaies' day" with their pres
ence, and they "rooted"' hard for the little
Englishman. George Miller piloted San
Mateo and Joe Piggott was up on Orestes.
Both youngsters were applauded as they
gayly pranced to the post.
The start was with the flag, and, as ex
pected, San Mateo outfooted his rival at
the ntart. Sailing away at a great clip.
Mr. Hobart's colt struck tbe stretch four
lengths to the good, and Oresle9' chances
looked about as good as Martin Kelly's of
being Governor.
But under Piggott's urging he answered
every call of his rider, and as the pair
flashed by the wire was beaten out but a
long neck in 5t5 seconds. George Miller
was tcnaercd an ovation as he returned to
the stand with the victor, and Orestes
made many friends by his fine showing,
and as he is of the improving sort will un
doubtedly be heard from in the future.
It was again an unfortunate duy for the
first choices, all of the six favorites, ex
clusive of San Mateo, being toppled over
in the dust. Fourteen bookmakers
handled tbe coin in the big betting rin^,
the wagering being the liveliest of the
meeting. .
Cireyhurst at post odds of 11 to 5 was ex
tensively backed to pull off the opening
four-furlong scramble for two-year-olds,
and after leading until within a lew yards
of the tape was beaten out the last "jump
by Dura, who dropped from the clouds.
George Palmer was third.
Another of Sam Hildreth's string. St.
Lee, set all of the rudimentary elements
of the "dope" book et defiance by taking
the mile handicap in a drive at odds of 8
to 1. Cabrillo shook Puke Stevens off
down the backstrctch and led to within
forty yards of the finishing point, when
Ike Johnson, on St. Lee, came with I great
rtish and snatched the race by a nose in
1:42> 4 . The favorite, Wheel "of Fortune,
trtm third.
The mile and a half hurdle event ended
in a big upset. Silvenulo was backed down
from Â«i to 5 to it to 10 as though it wa; all
over, but finished no better than third.
IsaÂ«sanio, at one 3la>;e of the betting 16 to
1, came strongly after taking the last jump
and in a drive bent Templemore a length.
Fifteen telling plutero started in the
fifth race, a cheap five and a half furlong
scramble, with Jennie W the post favorite
at odds of 3to 1. She ran unplaced. Com
ing from next to last position at the start
Model threaded her way through the
bunch and at the end won easily a length
before tne outsider, Isabelle. The winner
went to the post 5 to 1.
The mile and a sixteenth event, decided
under selling conditions, resulted in
another exciting finish. It was a most
open betting affair, there being no pro
nounced choice. Around post time Miss
Brummel and Babe Murphy at threes
were the most fancied, with All Over at 4
to 1 the next fancied. Miss Brummel,
closely attended by Walter .1, set the IMMM
until neanng the stretch, where the mare
began pulling back.
Straightened away for the wire. All
Over passed Walter j and Perseus, and at |
the finish won ridden out, a lenntlj in ad
vance of Scimitar, who came from the far
rear. Perseus was third.
The last event on the card at five and a
half furlongs, was captured l>y Circe, a 4
to 1 chance, with the 11 too choice Ruin
art finishing in the place.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Over 4000 ladies viewed the racing.
Carelessness on tbe part of bbjelds lost
the race for Greyhurst. The grey was
only beaten at the last jump.
Ike Johnson is one of the most improved
jockeys at the track. He put up a crack
ing good ride astride St. Lee.
Scimitar appears to be an unfortunate
colt. The majority of the boys that pilot
him let him pell so far out of it at the bo
ginning that he would have to be a Hin
doo to win.
The stable was not over pleased with the
ride Snid er gave Miss Brummel. The boy
explained to the judges that the mare was
merely galloping to the stretch, but when
ne called upon her she cried quits.
Cadenza was played for a "killing" by
her stable, the ouds being swiped from :V)
down to 7. Very little coin was taken by I
the books, however, at the former price.
Sweet WillUm ran a very creditable
race and with a rider up that could have
kept him straight would have been well
inside the money at the end.
Norman Brougu, wno will ofticiate in
the capacity of judge and handicauper on
tlie Montana season this summer, received
a telegram from Manager Tipton yeMer- '
day stating that the Great Northern Hail- â¢
road w;ould give the horsemen naif rates!
over its line, and intimating ttiat he i
thought the other roads would fall in line !
Mat Storn, Sam Hildreth and Hoag and
Little are a few of the local horsemen that
have an eye on the rich purees to be huna
up in that section of the country.

The Veteran Firemen of this City started
yesterday for the floral fete at Healdsburg
and presented a very attractive appear
ance as they marched from their head
quarters at tne Pioneer building on Fourth'
street to the ferry. About 150 of the
veteran firefighters, all attired in red shirts,-.
helmets, etc., started out at 3 o'clocit
with the old veteran hand fire en
gine in tow. This engine is a pioneer
on this coast and many years ago
â¢when it was in Sacramento it was called
}be Young America. The old engine has
recently been repaired ana repainted in a !
most artistic manner.
In addition to the fancy touches of the
artist, several pictures of the firemen of
former tunes have been added to its deco
rations. _On one side is tne P -"re of
Charles D.Kohler, the first chief of the
Volunteer department and on the other

DOGS HAVE THEIR DAY
Pacific Kennel Club's Fifth An
nual Show at Mechanics'
Pavilion.
THE MAJESTIC ST. BERNARDS
Canines That Won B'ue, Red and
White Ribbonsâ The Judging
Wi 1 End To-Day.
The fifth annual bench show of the Pa
cific Kennel Club opened yesterday at the.
Pavilion.
The benchinjc of the dogs is much the
same as last year, with the exception of the
lordly St. Bernards, which are housed by
themselves at the east end of the hull and
in such a very comfortable manner as to
reflect credit on the ft. Bernard Club and
E. H. Williams, who superintended the
construction of the benches.
The riiiÃ wherein judgment is passed
upon all breeds of uocs is situated at the
west end of the Pavilion and the floor is
of rough boards, on which several inches
of sawdust lies.
During the last show given by the Pa
cific Kennel Club the handlers frequently
came to grief when giving their charges a
little quick exercise before the judge. The
floor was then as smooth at glass, and as
â¢logmen are not as a rule "crackajacks" in
skating they went flown before his honor,
who, however, left them off with a slight
reprimand and a caution not to indulge
again. Sunerintendent Williams has the
thanks of the handlers for providing on
ti> is occasion a good foundation for the
gallopers.
Home of the kennels are handsomely
decorated in aivers colorÃ, but generally
upeuking the decorations oi last year were
much prettier, but then there is ample

James Mortimer, the judge, who arrived
yesterday, had barfly time to change his
traveling costume and jump into a "ring"
suit when he was culled upon to put in an
appearance at the Pavilion.
The dogs, which showed unmistakable J
â tgni of anxiety when Mr. Mortimer hove j
in sight, manifested theft pleasure and
approval at seeing the venerable gentle- |
man once again by s nding up a mixed
chorus which startled the spiders that j
were webbed to the rafters and caused the
big bell overhead to sound the arrival of !
the great canine judge.
It was 2 p. m. when the judging com- |
meticed. The mastiffs were tirst to appear t
before the critical eye of the man who has
passed judgment on thousands of aogs of
all breeds and colois.

This closed the judging for the first day.
Mr. Mortimer will start in early to-day to
judge all other classes and he expects to
complete the task at an early hour this j
afternoon.
The cocker spaniels and the fox terriers
are well represented. They are a high
class lot of dogs and cannot fail to attract
considerable attention.
Danny Need ham has a very pretty wire
hair BoMeh terrier on exhibition.
A kennel of collies the prop rty of O. J.
Albee Lawrence is one of the principal j
attractions of the exhibition.
The Griffons-French sporting dogs at- !
tract much attention also. They are cer- [
tainly far from being handsome; but, j
nevertheless, they are admired by mini- i
bers of people because of their shaggy and
wild appearance.
The English and Irish setters are much
admired by sportsmen. Taken altogether,
the show of dogs <o first class and well
worth seeing. The Irish water spaniels
are a high-class lot of dogs. Irish Dnke
and Nora \V are much admired for their
beauty.
Judge W. P. Law.or feJt very much dis
couraged yesterday when he" gazed list
lessly upon an empty bench in which
should have been resting his favorite fox
hounaTasso.
The Judge lost the dog about seven
months ago, but found the much-looked
lor bow-wow last week. He immediately
entered hia charee in the show, but oh
luesday last Tasso concluded to take a i
little constitutional all by himself, and up |
to last evening the Judge has not beard a
word from him.
"If the person who has that dog will
return him to me to-day, or before Mr. !
Mortimer has an opportunity to pass on
â ?i f Â° xhou nd 9." said Judge Lawlor, "I
will handsomely reward him or her. I
snow that Tasso can easily beat every
hound in the show, and that is the reason
why I am so deeply interested in his im
mediate return."

PEEPARING FOR THE RACE.
Her Engines Worked Perfectly and
the Ship Will Win Golden

Just as the gray dawn of yesterday
crept over the hills back of Oakland, the
windlass of the Oregon creaked and rat
tled as the big battle-i-lnp was brought to
her anchor. She was to start training â
training for a run against time â and her
engines had to be loosened up and her
boilers well heated before the time of trial
comes.
The floating fortress must be trained for
her run as carefully as a record-breaker
trains for a r*ce. Her valves have to be
set so as to gfve most advantageous ser
vice, the bearings have to be turned to
wear smooth and true, her pipes and
boilers must be blown out clear of all ob
structions, and her plates must be free
from barnacles and seagrass. When she
was on the dock some days ago, she was
cleaned and painted â now she is trimming
her engines to do the most work with the
steam supplied from the boilers.
Leaving her anchorage, the Oregon
steamed up the bay until off Hunters
Point, and then she was "swung" to rec
tify her compasseÃ. These being satisfac
torily adjusted, she headed for Red Rock.
On her decks were Henry T. Scott,
president of the works ; Admiral Beardslee,
who will be president of the olricial trial
board; Lieutenant Stoney, United States
Navy ; Chief Kngir.eerWil?on, United States
Navy; Lieutenant A. F. Fechteler, United
States Navy; Nelson E. Whitaker of the
Whitaker Iron Works of Wheeling, W.
VÂ».; H. C. Mechlins of New York, William
R. Eckart, consulting engineer of the
Union Iron Works; Robert Forsythe, who
was in charge of Â«the engines and ship
generally ; Captain C. M. Goodall, who was
captain and pilot; Dr. Joseph Soper, W.
11. Harris of the Hongkong and Shang
hai Bank, Robert P. Foreman, John F.
Merrill, Lieutenant Thomas F. Rulin,
naval constructor, and several others.
A- -he passed up the bay, ships that be
fore seemed large dwindled almost into
insignificance beside her ponderous bulk.
It is not that the Oregon is large in dimen
sions, although she is ample in beam, j
length and draft, but in every curve and j
line from the truck of her military mast
down past her frowning guns and armored
turrets to her keel strength and power
speak as plainly as the roar of her siren. I
As .-he stands to-day she weighs 9600 tons;
fllieo she makes her record she will be '
over 10,000 tons ; she is H4B feet long, Â«9
feet o*4 inches beam, and she draws 24 feet
of water aft and about 23 feet forward.
She will get $50,000 for every quarter knot
she will make over rifteen knots.
As she plowed up the bay on her way to
Red Rock steamers saluted* her on every j
side. Stie was not running fast, the en- j
gines will be gradually worked up to the
supreme test, but even at half speed evi
dences of her motion disturbed the water
on every side.
Curling away from her bows a seething
foaming wave reached for a hundred feet
on either side. Her heavy lines forward
seemed to pick up the water as she went
on, and throwing it ahead of her churned
it again and again into a wall of white.
Just above where her keen cutwater
divides the waves the fiat end of a torpedo
tube threw the lifted water out into a
great fan, and it gave her whole stern the
appearance of being buried in a bank of
fcnow. Along her sides the bow-wave was
thrown out ayain in a second line of white,
and behind ncr she left a wake of swirls
and eddies bubbling up from the thrust of
her powerful screws.
Twelve knots and over was her best rate
yesterday, but she did this at "half
speed" and with an ease which augurs
well for her run for wealth and fame.
This does not mean that at full speed the
Oregon will cover twenty -four knots in an 1
hour, but it does mean that sixteen knots,
one knot over the extreme speed she is
expected to make, is within her grasp.
Far down in the bowels of the ship,
however, where the engines throbbed and
beat, and where forty nrenien peered into
as many raging furnaces, was where tue
real work and worry and watchfulness
were concentrated.
Like the strokes of a pendulum the con
necting rods threw down and up, over and
back, the heavy castings on the screw
shafts. Wherever one piece of steel rubbed
on another there was a man with an oil
can, and spraying down on the mam cranK
bearings were jets of cold water. As the
cranks spun around drops, like rain, were
thrown around the engine-room.
Without a sound almost the main en
gines swung up and down, with only the
uiss and groan of the steam, like the
heavy breathing of a toiling laborer, to
tell of the power they wielded. They
were making 110 revolutions a minute,
with 165 pounds pressure and 8500 horse
power represented the thrust of their right
arms. They can do more â much more â if
only Forsythe would open wide the valve
that stops the flow from the boilers; but
down in Santa Barbara Channel the chance
will come, and there is *no expert who has
seen the ryhthmic beat of that living
steel but says that they will nobly avail
themselves of it.
But the engine-room was not silent, for
the cogwheels of a condenser jarred and
clattered so loud as to make conversation
difficult. The condenser is of Government
pattern. The builders wished to put in
one of local deÃign, which at least had the
virtue of silence, but the Government in
sisted, and so the engine-room that would
otherwise be silent is made to.resound.
Forward of the engine-rooms nearly
fifty furnaces, each witn a man attending
it, hissed and crackled and consumed coal
at a rate almost inconceivable. There
was just a good draft onâ not the real
forced draft which shrieks down into the
firerooms from the blowers with the force
of a gale at ten, but just enough, the fire
men said, to "keep her going." It was
not hot â that is, lor a fireroom. Not much
over a hundred was all a tnermometer
could show, but the proximity to the
fierce heat of the furnaces and the flames
that leaped and played around tiiedoors
whenever they were opened gave a sug
gestion of the temperature within and
made it seem hot, anyway. The firerooms
will be hotter under forced draft, but they
are not expected to go above 120. To a
marine iircman. it seems, this is but like a
warm day in summer.
Charles Miner Goodall was in command
of the Oregon as sue picked her way up
and down the roadstead. The import
ance qf his position may be imagined when
it is known that olten there was no more
than four or five feet under the vessel's
keel. It is not often that a ship of twenty
four feet draft is sent up and down the
bay ou a trial trip. The course was be
THE OREGON AS SHE WAS MAKING OVER TWELVE KNOTS AN HOUR ON HER PRELIMINARY TRIAL IN THE BAY.
tween Red Rock in the Narrows to off |
Hunter's Point, ana Captain Goodall kept
the deepest water, but often when down j
at the southern end of the course, big
clouds of mud would come to the surface,
and stretch behind the ship in turbulent
red-brown wake. The bottom is too near
the surface in San Francisco Bay to give a
boat like the Oregon a fair trial. She
wants creen water with miles' upon miles
in every direction, and the mud fathoms
deep under her keel.
She is quick to her helm, once the rud
der takes hold, but she needs a careful
hand at the wheel. Down by the drydock
at Hunters Point she turned in less than
200 yards. A line drawn from her course
down the bay to her new course, back
! again, would be less than 200 yards long,
and beyond it wnuld be a semi-circle of
foam. This was with only 20 dee. of
helm, and the Oregon's wheel is "hard
over" at 40. Once swinging to her helm
she turns rapidly, and it seems, almost
upon her keel, but it takes a strong hand
to meet her when her heavy body comes
around, and the hydraulic gear creaks
with the strain as she is brought to her
course. Her steering-gear is the heaviest,
ever made, but a glance at the vessel
shows that she needs it.
As the battleship is now she needs but
her secondary battery and her stores and
ammunition to make her ready for sea.
It is almost impossible to describe her ap
pearance, except to say she is the personi
fication of force and power. She passed
the Comauche, the little old monitor lying
off Folsom-street wharf, every time she
came to the southern end of her run, and
her Dest description lies in a comparison
between the original turret ship of '63 and
the latest addition to the United States
navy. The Comanche is not over 200 feet
long. She has one 80ft iron turret, two
puns of obsolete pattern, and under water
she is like a tank â all open and every sec
tion connected with the other. She has a
single screw and a single engine, and she
looks like a board upon the water. The
Oregon has six turrets, all of the hardest
steel. She has sixteen big guns and over
thirty small ones. She has two
screws and two engines, and each engine
is compounded to thrice ils old - time
power. She looks like a destroying angel.
Frowning high over her superstructure is
her single mast and her two yellow smoke
stacks. Then comes her bridge, then her
superstructure deck, then her main or gun
deck. Below that is her berth deck, then
her orlop or protective deck, then the
"upper platform," then the lower plat
form, and then below the double bottom is
the keel. She slopes from her smoke
stacks down to stem and stern, her thir
teeu-inch turrets easing the line down to
her low decks fore and aft. She has twelve
feet of free board, but the waves
may beat over her if they will,
for she moves forward as if nothing
on earth could stop her. At her beak is a
ram, in her nose is the mouth of a tor
pedo-tube; peering from all sides are her
guns, and wailed around her are plates of
steel so hard and thick that no shot made
by man or propelled by powder can reach
her vitals. She is divided into over 200
water-tight compartments, and it needs
but the closing of a door to rob the deadly
torpedo of much of its terror. She cost
$3,000,000 for hull alone; as she floats she
is worth $5,000,000. Her builders expect
her to drive the foam and spray ahead of
her at over sixteen knots an hoar, and
when she shows her teeth in the name of
the tricolor at her stern there is nothing
afloat she need be afraid of.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Narrow Escape of the Barken
tine C. C. Funk Near
Mile Rock.
SAVED BY THE TUG VIGILANT.
The Homer Will Be Replaced on the
Coos Bay Run by the Fast
Steamer Czarina.
The barkentine C. C. Fank had another
j narrow escape lant Saturday night. The
1 captain refused a tow when it was offered
I him by the tug Vigilant because he con-
I sidered $75 more than the regular
i charge. Four hours later he was only too
i glad to pay n. great deal more in order to
get out of h's dangerous predicament.
The Funk was bound in from Kahului,
H. L, with a cargo of sugar. She had
I made a fair passage of twenty days and
las the wind was fair Captain Challeston
determined to sail in. Captain Randall of
the tug Vieilant spoke to him and offered
to tow the barkentine in for $75. Captain
Challeston offered $50 and Randall re
fused. Soon thereafter the vind fell light
and the sugar boat began to drift down on
Mile Rock. Rockets were fired, the an
chors let go and preparations made to
abandon the vessel. The anchors only
held for a few hours and when the full
force of the ebb tide struck the barkentine
I Bhft began to drift attain.
More rockets were sent up. but there was
no response from the life-paving station.
Just as the crew was preparing to leave
the vessel the Vigilant once more hove in
sight, and Captain Challeston was only too
glad to pay $175 for a tow to a safe anchor-
I age.
In talking about his narrow escape Cap-
I tain ChalleÂ»ton said: "We arrived off
port Tuesday night, and about 8:30 p. m.
we were so close to Mile Rock that I had
to let go both anchors. There was a strong
ebb tide and no wind to speak of, and rec
ognizing tnat we were in a dangerous po-
I sition I sent up some rockets. The life
saying station took no notice, and we
might all have gone to the bottom for all
the life-savers cared. We had the boats
provisianed and over the side, expecting
every minute to have to take to them.
Luckily, at the moment of our greatest
peril, the Vigilant hoVe in sight and pulled
us off."
The Funk put in here in distress on
February 6 last. She was on her way from
Puget Sound to Honolulu with a load of
! coal and was caught in a southeaster. She
I sprang a leak and nearly foundered. After
repairing she proceeded on her way. At
Kahului she was to-red to sea by the
steamer Claudine and there was more
trouble. The towing line parted and the
recoil struck Mate Holmes and Seaman
Bob Robinson. Holmes was laid up for a
week and Robinson had both his legs
broken. Captain Challeston is beginning
to think there is a hoodoo on the barken
tine.
The work of raising the Blairraore is pro
gressing. Nearly all the standing rigging
has been cut away and yesterday the
lighter Catalina was taken out to receive
the debris. The mast? will next be re
moved and placed on the lighter and then
the real work will begin.
It will be very difficult to get the hull on
an even keel, but when that is accom
plished Captain Whitelaw does not expect
a very hard task in raising the vessel.
Japtain Burns, who represents the Eng
lish underwriters, is on the scene every
day, and is well satisfied with the progress
being made.
Harbor Commissioners Cole and Chad
bourne are expected here from Sacramanto
this morning, so the usual weekly meeting
of the board will be held this afternoon.
In regard to the making of I beams for
the new lerry building by the Carnegies,
about which bo much has been written,
President Colnon said in substance yester
day: "There is no mill on the Pacific Coast
that can turn out a 20-inch steel I beam,
and, to the best of ray knowledge, there
are only two in the United States equal to
the task. Whila lighter beams could have
been made here, the weight and price
would have been HO per cent greater.
"The whole matter was fully discussed,
and the representatives of the rolling
mills had several consultations with us.
The only feasible plan submitted by them
was that of intermediate columns, hut
owing to the extra weight our engineer
did not think it practicable. Now you
have all there is to the matter."
The steamer Homer, which has been
carrying Beaver Hill coal for some time
past, is going into retirement. The
Czarina, purchased in Peusacola by J. D.
Spreclels, is expected here in a day or Â«o,
and she will at once go on the run. Cap
tain Drisko, Mate G. W. Seaman, First
Assistant Engineer Charles Blum and
Purser F. Iff. Bucklin of the Homer will
go over to the Czarina, much to the delight
of the traveling public.
Henry Miller, the boatman, thinks his
boat is a hoodoo, and be is willing to sell
her for a song. About a year ago he saw
three Chinese in a Whitehall drifting to
ward Goat Island in a southeaster. He
went to their assistance, but only saved
the overturned boat. He had the white
hall fixed up and went into business. Dur
ing his first trip he got into trouble with a
sailor and was shot through the hand.
Next he was capsized off Pacific-street
wharf, and yesterday the wash from the
battle-ship Oregon turned his boat over
a.am and Miller drifted around for over
half an hour before he was picked up. lie
has about come to the conclusion that the
spirits of those three departed Chinese are
still pursuing the boat.
SUFFERS FROM APHASIA,
A Young Man Who Appears Not
to Know His Own
Name.
His Peculiar Case Is Puzzling the
Physicians at the Receiving
Hospital.
The physicians at the Receiving Hospital
are puzzled over the case of a youne man,
and he is being Kept there for "observa
tion," as it is expressed on the register.
Early yesterday morning Policeman
Jerry Dinan was attracted by the peculiar
actions of a well-dressed young man on
Bush street. He seemed to be under the
influence of liquor, and Dinan accosted
him, asking his name. He got no reply,
and further questions met with the same
stubborn silence.
Dinan rang for the patrol wagon, and
the you*g man was taken to the California
street station. There he also refused to
answer any Questions, and was booked as
"John Doe.' f
Yesterday morning he was taken to the
City Prison. There he also refused to an
swer any questions. When asked his
name he looked in the desk sergeant's face
with a broad grin. And so it was with
I other questions.
About 10 o'clock he began to talk to him
self, and another attempt was made to
learn his name. He stopped talking and
looked blankly at Sergeant Lindheimer,
who several times asked him his name
without eliciting a reply. It was de
cided to send him to the hospital, as the
prison officials were afraid that something
had happened to turn his brain.
"I think the young man," said Dr. Bun
nell yesterday, "is suffering from a form
of aphasia, which in plain language means
a loss of memory. He can speak all right,
but he does not seem to remember any
thing. It is a peculiar case.. No, I don't
think he is simply stubborn, or ttat he is
suffering from delirium tremens. The
latter supposition may prove the correct
one, but that will soon be developed."
There wore no |>apers in the young
man's pockets which migot lead to his
identification. In fact, his pockets were
empty, and the police think it probable
that he had been drugged and robbed and
is still suffering from the effects of the
drug.
He is in a padded cell in the hospital
and keeps continually mam bling to him
self. Unless there is a change in his con
dition this morning he will likely betaken
before the Insanity Commissioners.

QUEER MIDGET CANINE,
Only Five Inches Long and
Rides Inside Mr. Mo
Lure's Vest.
BIDS DEFIANCE TO ENEMIES.
Is a Great Traveler and Has Been All
Over the Worldâ A Fighter
From Away Back.
J. Y. McLure of Troy, Ala., who has
been on a visit to Cuba, Venezuela and
Guatemala, is among the arrivals at the
Grand. Mr. McLure has a strange travel
ing companion, in a miniature canine,
only about five inches long, which occu
pies a coign of vantage next to bis shirt,
on the inside of his vest.
In this position, with his head thrust
over the top of the vest, the small dog
bids defiance to enemies of whatever sort.
His bark has scarcely more volume than
the notes of a canary ,'though it is, as may
be supposed, pitched in a different key.
Many a huge mastiff has had his curios
ity aroused by the defiant challenges
hurled at him from some unknown quar
ter by the Lilliputian canine.
Mr. McLure secured the prodigy in an
obscure town in Alabama. It is of a light
ish dun or somewhat yellowish color, and
the hair is as fine and soft as that on a
mole. The little fellow is perfectly formed
in every way. The eyes are bright and
saucy and tlie teeth are as white as ivory.
Mr. McLure has been offered plenty of
money for the canine, nut no money can
get it of him, for in the long years that he
has traveled he has become attached to
the midget and the latter to him. It
would be like trying to buy a child of a
parent.
The dog has plenty of pluck, but. despite
the air of bravado which he assumes from
time to time, he is so little that any one
would think a Norway rat in a free tight
would throttle him to death. This is the
opinion that numerous persons have en
tertained of his prowess. However, in a
real battle the dog is said to spread terror
to beasts much larger than himself.
"This little fellow has been over a good
part of the world with me," said Mr. Mc-
Lure, "and he knows as much about me as
any man alive â knows all my whims,
when 1 am sad and glad, and governs him
self accordingly.
"It is needless for me to say I wouldn't
sell him. I have been offered large sums
at different times, but none of them were
any temptation. It is too valuable a dog
for me to sell. Afwr all, there are things
you don't want to part with for money, no
matter how much you get."
Mr. McLure was here about a year ago
and had the dog along then. The gentle
man will be here a few days, and will then
proceed to his home in Alabama. He
travels for a large picture-house in which
he is interested.

A DAY OF GLORY FOR THE WOMEN.
Their Congress Hails With Joy the News of
the Indorsement of the Suffrage Bill.
MISS ANTHONY CHEERED
On the Wave of Republican Jus
tice the Movement Rolls
to Success.
HISS SHAW IS ELOQUENT.
Miss Yates of Maine and Rev. Dr.
Voorsanger Are Amon; the
Evening Speakers.
Rich, warm shades of red enlivened the
stage of Native Â£ons' Hall at yesterday's
sessions of the Woman's Congress. Deep
Jacqueminot roses, California poppies,
wine-tinted chrysanthemums and flaming
gladioli, set off by garlands of smiJnx and
half hid by filmy veils of maidenhair ferns,
formed a magnificent setting for the grouD
of cultured ladies whose words of elo
quence and convincing logic besieged and
took hy storm ihe minds of those to whom
they v;ere addressed.
The day's tone was "Woman," and that
mysterious idol of the masculine heart
was considered as a myth, a fact and as a
social factor. She was pursued through
realms ot religion, poetry and fiction, and
thoroughly analyzed as she was, as she is,
as she is said to be and as she will be in
earnest when she gets a chance.
Miss Cordelia S. Kirtland of Chicago,
111., was accorded the first place on the
programme of me morning, and her paper,
"Woruun as a Popular Myth," was in her
absence read !>y her fnend, Mrs. Louise
HumDhrey-Smith. The treatment of the
subject was as follows:
The subjects of ancient myths had one great ad
vantagLâthey were not obliged to live tip to their
later biographies. Hercules would fiud his method
of stahle-cleauing interfered wltti to-day by riparian
rights, and the employment of a professional
trainer by C'acus miittu reverse the issue of his
pucilistlc encounter with that pent!eman.
But woman, less fortunate modern woman, has I
to walk Hide by side, day In and day oui. with a I
fiincy portrait dressed in her ciothes and labeled '
with her name, for which neither ;she nor her
creator is in any way responsible. Men have
worked for age* at this picture; painters, poets,
dramatists and especially novelists have success
ively deepened the lines and hei^h . ned the colors
as suited their inner consciousness, with appar
ently no reference whatever to the living Maries
and JcnniiS under their eyes. - .
Indeed, tiie Imagination works on deductive,
not on inductive, lines; so, when a man wants a
heroine, instead of looking for her in his daily
walks he retires to his back-brain, where are pre
served a number of archaic feminine images, as
lifelike as those poor old scarecrows now- in West
minster Abbey, which used to be carried in royal
funeral jifocessions. These ladies of the mind
are labeled -it good woman,", "a bad woman." -a
coquette," "a prude" and so on. From these he

Hut how about the women writers, wi:o are now
among us in such overpowering numbers?* Do
they not understand their own sex? They do
naturally, but for along time they, too, were sub
ject to the example of talse art. given by the men,
who occupied the field so largely. Hear Frau
Hansen, a kÂ«-en critic from Â»cÂ«ndinavia. She says:
"Formerly women's writings were, for the most
part (cither directly or Indirectly) the expression
of a great falsehood. They Were so desirous to be
Impersonal that it was quite comical to see how
they lmliatea men's models, both in form and con
tent. ethers (who wro:e as women) had no con
nection with literature at all; iney merely knitted
literary stockings. Besides, the nerves have a bet
ter memory than the brain, and women mostly
wrote with their nerves." "
But readinK-aad-wrltlng man really loved the
ideal he portrayed and recognized. This concep
tion was formed when the romances of chivalry
first snatched woman from the unblushing bru
tality of the dark ages, and each budding mascu
line reader hoped to find the old beautiful, snsceo
tible, dependent, untruthful creature among his
female acquaintances. .
When I was a child my elder brother had one
period when he was absorbed by Miss Susan War

the one called -Queechy/' The Fleda of that

remark plaintively, -Why. can't you be more like

To the Editor of THE CALLâ Dear Sir: Your courageous and manly stand for
woman suffrage is indeed inspiring to those laboring for human rights. Give us every
liberty that does not infringe upon the equal liberty of any one else, male and female
alike. That is the natural law under which we are created and under which we should
live. Every step toward the abolition of human laws antagonistic to that natural law
is a step forward in the march of human progress. Man has no special legislative
privilege bestowed on him by the Creator. Say on, and God speed. Yours for equity.

SINGLE-TAXERS WITH THE MODERN MOVEMENT.
Single-taxers cannot, consistently with their principles, be opposed to woman
suttrage. Any one who comprehends and accepts the fundamental doctrines of the
single-tax philosophy must recognize the right of women to vote. And as a matter of
fact I believe that all single-taxers are woman suffragists, or, in apter phrase, equal
suffragists. A single-taxer, when asked if he is in favor of giving women the right
to vote, says it is not the question of giving. He recognizes the truth that every
woman who has attained her majority has as much right to vote as he has. Let us
stop depriving her of her right. Hair-splitting distinctions betweeen natural and arti
ficial rights are unprofitable and begging the question. She is bound to obey the laws
equally with man. She is equally interested with him in the welfare of society, which
is insured by good laws, and she is compelled to bear equally with him the calamities
and miseries that follow in the train of bad laws. The single-taxers of California take
a deep and earnest interest in the progress of the movement in favor of the equal suf
frage amendment, and will, I believe, to a man, vote for it on election day. All the
g i e "^\T S Â° f my acc l uaintance are greatly delighted with the noble stand taken by

Is a brief summary of past social conditions affect
ing womuu's position. Now for a glance at the !
piÂ»-sont and future.
I iit-re are three definitions of "society" to which I
I wish to call yourattentlon. First, "An entire civ
ilized community with common Interests and
alms"; second, -"Society specifically, the morel
cultivated part of a community in its social and |
intellectual relations. Interests and Influence"- I
third, "Those collectively who are recognlied as '
taking the lead in fashionable life." Now, yon
find women in all these definitions. She is half of
the '-entire civilized community." She is also, i
specifically, a fractional part of "the more culti- I
vated pan of the community." She is the whole i
of "those collect'vely who are recognized as tak- !
ing the lead in fashionable life"â for Instance. I
when the newspapers tell us that "the season is
over and society is returning to town." they do
not mean the "entire civilized community." So
ciety as McAllister found It means an oilgarchy
the supremacy of a few, mostly women, as dic
tators of social form and ceremony, and i
a competitive struggle for personal appear- !
anc* and social prestige among women,
has kept pace with the competitive struggle in the :
business world. "When two women meet," says a '
male critic, -*each regards the otner in the light of '
an enemy and discovers a: a glance if an unsuita
ble color has bfen chosen or a bow put ou in the
wrong place." Huch asocial standard fosters so
etaj cruelty, and social hostility among women is a I
deplorable fact. WÂ« all know that much of |
women's possible social utility, giving this pbrase
its broadest meaning, is loet to the world because '
ot our standard of dress.
Here is an instance of other social limitations:
Recently thÂ» San Francisco A reonaut had an edi
torial on "Wes Benjamin Krankfln a Gentleman?"
baaed noon or inspired by the fact that a Mrs. John
Kint; Yum kensselaer and other colonial dames In
Philadelphia decided be was not because his father
was a soup-boiler and a tallow chandler. Hence Ben
jamin Franklin's descendant, who sought a<lrcli
slon into the -society of colonial Dames" on the
strength of Franklin's social prominence and use
fulness in coonial times, was refused admission j
because of the plebeian occupation of his father, :
and i he Concrusion Is inevitable if Benjamin Frank
j lln was no gentleman ou this account theu the ap
plicant was no lady. But the society finally recou- ;
bide red this decision, and the Argonaut says ;
"American democracy obt-iiii'-'d a new lease of i
life " But alas, that sonnl equality und ability |
should be a question of ancestry and of occupa- i
tiO .âyea, even of dress.
Here. Is another illustration of the narrow inter
, pretation given to society which limits it to 400:
Not long auo the Francisco Chronicle primed
OU Its first page, crowded iv among important
".As^oclalea Press Dispatches." a picture of Mrs.
John Jacob Astor with the headline, or scan-line,
"The Probable Queen of Gotham Society," and j
went on to warn us that "society was wavering be
tween the Aston ana Vanaerbilts, but that young
Mrs. Astor's undeniably brilliant future may well
give pause to thosÂ» who think of giving their alle
giance to the Vauderbilts, as every one admits I
tli<r- will be a permanent split in New York so- ;
Clety." Just why .'San rrnni'isco and the entire
country should be warned oi this impending social
cataclysm In New York is not apparent. No won

ate and is a National jone. Tt Is too much the
truth that out maidens, who are to oe the mothers
of men, get no adequate training for future social
responsibilities. To enter "society" as a "bud"
and then to get married anJ live happily ever after
ward, as t tie romantic novel has it, is too often the
limit of their aspirations- but they live to learn by

Do try to be more up to date.
Now the condition of things up to date, ln this
economic chance world, is that women are repos
sessing the industrial world, or "invading the
sphere of men to the necleit of tlielr natural vo
cation, as the "remonstrants" say, and it is also
possible that even If the uirls do wait and wait
aud wait, they may never be as fortunate as the

The facts are told in figures by Carroll D. Wright,
Ijiiiea States Labor Commissioner, who says in
J8Â»O, out of 369 groups oi industries, in" only
twelve were there no women or children em
ployed.
Now the chance ln the social condition of
women as the result of their readvent into the In
dustries and the evolution which has taken placs
ln the domestic life has made women freer. The
tendency is not now to resirict thorn, but they
could lake their full share' of thepublic life of the
people, if society would take on a broader mean
ing and embrace "the whole civilized community
with common interests and alms"; If it would be"
and not seem to be a democracy.
BÂ«Â» woman, Â»Â« Â» social factor Â»tlllâ "walketh

powerâ slow advancing, halting, creeping comes
the woman to the hour/ As mother she loves and
cuddles and croons over Infancy as it lies on her

strength of her understanding, the sharpening of
her powers of thought; the acquaintance with facts
and discuovon of methods which shall make soci
ety safe and helpful for her babe, has not been an
emphatic part of her education.
It is said women have no sense of public duty
no sense of the correlation of social and National
concerns. Herbert spencer says, "The compara
tive greater impulsiveness of women would make
ncr<-ase of influence an injurious factor in
legislation, and that religious fanaticism has
been carried further by women than men "
and that she Is, in fact, the potentiality-
Of several kinds of fanatic. Furthermore, it is
said, and not by Sponcer, that women constitute
a self-llmlud society, that their social duties are
so lightly held, that they are whimsical and no
man can pretend to comprehend a woman (neither
do they always some tliincs of their own creation
âthe "new churter," for instance, is subject to as
many Interpretations aa the "new woman')
vÂ» omen Iv fiction a'so have for the most part been
portrayed as capricious, irresponsible, lovable,
childishly egotistical, as Mrs. Makely, for instance,
In Howells "Altrurian"â "who seemingly had a
conscience light as air and bragged herself up at
â¢omen do when you make concessions to them."
n is too often true that women "sink down in the
sort circumstances of their lives" and make the
nervous woes of comfortable people, or the total
aepravity of domestic hÂ«lp, the theme of iher talk
to the ignoring of questions of larger social import.
io neglect and stultify the original all-around
usefulness of women Is a/soclal defeat. They have
an intuitive sense of affairs and sufficient execu
ne ability, but shut out from the rational and
natural play of | n tell?ctual forces they have de
eiopea the morbidly emotional find an exag

strength and knowledge experience alone can

>ow, we did not start that way ln the begin
ning, "when Adam delved and Eve span." Nature
said if you would eat you must work, if you would
preserve your offspr.ngyou must invent the ways
ana rrean< of doing so, and woman as mother was
found equM to the emergency. Now that eco
nomic conditions have broken In upon social tradi

ambition. It is not good torÂ«he health of the so
cial organism to educate woman merelvas woman.
A human creature is your state, and to be human
is more great thku even womanhood."
Ibe responsibility of woman's inefficiency as a
social factor rests upon society as a whole: neither
stjx alone can be adjudged guilty. Ii is the "effect
oi her previous condition of servitude." However,
the social status of women has generally
risen, as the more intelligent peoples feel
the pressure of the social and economic
changes which are steadily forcing the
realization in thought and deed of the spirit of
co-operation. The competition of sex against sex
will fall with that of man against man. The high
est political economy of the future will demand a
sexless suffrage as the chief social safeguard.
At the present time women acceptably fill
placea of responsibility, and just so far as woman
is self-released from artificial social restrictions
and put ln natural relation to tbe body social and
body politic, she will adapt herself with that ever
lasting and eternal adaptability inherited from
Eve.
Professor Grigss said: "Nothing Is understood
unless studied in the light of Its origin, and nothing
is understood if studied only in the light of its
origin. "< It is the evolved condition which explains
the earlier. If the origin of society was mother
and child, its spirit was even then altruistic, tbe
good of others. The past but prophesied of a
future wherein altruism should be recognized as
the ";ie that binds" in the social life as it does in
the family life. "
This family trinity Is the democratic social
unit, nnd Brvce says: "Democracy cannot stop as
defining men as male human beings." There is
j no escape from this principle. The pillurs of
society are not men alone, or women alone, bnt
men and women. But Lester F. Ward makes the
startling statement -that the broad recognition of
social equality of tho sexes has never yet bi-ei; dis
tinctly and practically made." "Â» ou see we have
prated of equality and freedom when there was
j neither freedom nor equality of rights, duties, dress,
I education nor opportunity, and the genuine basis
ot' association has been obscured. Bnt as co-ope
ration began In the home so it must extend to iha
body of society. The serial and political llfÂ» of
America has passed out of its single cell stale into
the larger organic life. Let woman have an abid
ing sense of her responsibility as a social factor
and come out of her cell state, the shadow land of
the past, into the sunshine of a wide and brilliant
social efficiency. "It is not woman," said Margeret
Fuller, 'it is not woman, but the law of right, the
law of growth that speaks in us. 1 must beat my
own pulse true ln the heart of the world."
Mi9s Severance had a few remarks to
launch forth after hearing this sister. She
said:
"Woman is not a social factor. She i%
the social factor. There is no society with
out her.
"When the Pilgrims came to this coun
try they brought their women with them
and founded society in America, but when
the early gold-seekers came to California
they brought no women, and you know
the social conditions that first existed
here. There can be no perfect social condi
tions without woman and her influence."
The Rev. Eliza Tupner Wilkes, who was
to have spoken on "Woman as a Social
Sufferer," is, unhappily, a sufferer herself,
being confined to her bed by a sudden at
tack of illness, and her address, not hav

'Enthusiasm at the Morning Session of the Woman's Congress Yesterday.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Woman In Fiction and Woman In
Poetry Portrayed With
Rare Fidelity.
The Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean of Oakland,
| president of the Pacific Theological Sem
j mary, was to have opened the afternoon
: session with a paper on "Woman in Re
; ligion," but ac he is engaged in searching
: for one of his seminarians, whose mysteri
! ous disappearance, noted elsewhere in
j The Call, has caused him much anx-
I iety, he felt unable to appear, and the
; opening essay on "Woman in Fiction"
1 was read by Mrs. Lovell White. She
I treated her subject in the following terras:
A history of woman Id fiction would include a
history of thf> human race, for in ihe earliest
legends of mankind woman has always appeared
by the side of manâ a neccs-sarv pan of the order
, of the universe. But my time" is limited. In the
-National ep cs originating in the early civilizations
j of all countries woman is observed to be an im
portant figure. The gods on Olympus were accom
: panied by goddesses almost their equals in power.
I Â».i A Btor . v ' -tell cr, essaying to picture life, be;rays
l His race, environment and the degree of the de
; velopment of his own mind aa wall as that of the
; universal mind about him. The female charac-
I ters in fiction are therefore onllnari' j colored with
I the writer's beliefs concerning the station and
function of woman, ana save in rare instances she
is treated by both male and female authors as beine
suoordinately related to man, or rather as an ad
junct to man.
Women without a flaw of character do not exist,
jor do wholly depraved women exist, and In tic
| tlon saints and devils are an impertinence, re
! ,PsÂ°*s, P sÂ°*sÂ° lD S <he author of nature. The heroines of
' the older English novels are namhy pambv crea
tures, excellent only in domestic virtues and pos
j sessing no opinions or originality of thought.
Mrs. Lovell White of San Francisco, Who, as an Enthusiastlo Snf fraglst, Spoke
of "Women in Fiction."
Revolt and rebellion were forbidden them. They
were made to submit to the decrees of fate and to
nnd eupport for their disappointments in the conso
lations of religion.
Women were not deemed necessary to the un
folding of the plot of the story. They were foils,
that the power and wickedness of man might be
seen to greater advantage.
Witness Fielding's Amelia, distinguished for her
conjugal affection and tenderness, whom even
Thackeray admired. Pamella, or "The Reward of
Virtue," Richardson's masterpiece, caused a sen
sation in itÂ« day. These two women were created
for the glorification of patience, setf-saenhee, self
effacement, as ln Chaucer's Griselda. Perennial
sweetness, constant martyrdom weary the modern
reader, and he turns with relief from these lay
figures of respectability and negative virtues.
The characteristics of the heroines found in the
novels of that time are in strong contrast to the
distinguishing features marking the heroines of
our times. The nerves of the hothouse creatures
posing as women in these books were tense, their
pallor extreme, their health at all times precari
ous, and fainting was the fashion and considered
but one of the forms of good society. They were a
sighing, mincing, husband-hunting" breed, "and lit
erature is to be congratulated upon theirdlsappear
ance from its pages: and mankind is to be con
gratulated upon the fact that, the woman to-day
does not exist who Is ashamed that the piano has
legs and who takes pride in the fact that she is an
abnormal and silly being.
In spite of the fact mat the women of to-day are
taller, t better formed and sounder of body than
women were at that time, learned 'men. in essay
after essay, tell us that the higher education now
given women unfits them lor the performance or
the duties pertaining to wife and mother and that
physically there is observed a marked deteriora
tion. : .
In the early part of this century there appeared
a noted company of novelists, headed by Dickens
and Thackeray and comprising many others of
minor qualltv, who all succeeded in individualiz
ing their female characters more distinctly than
had tnur predecessors. Dickens' popularity may
te passing, but his hand was skilled in drawing
and bis gallery of portraits, whom we all recognize
is next in extent only to that of Shakespeare and
many of his portraits and caricatures are destined
to remain as works of art for long to come
Thackeray permitted no prejudices in 'favor of
conventionality to stand between him and his art
and it has beet, affirmed that his reputation suffers
from his Indiscretion in having created Becky
Sharp, As well might it be said that civil iza-iou
suffers from having created the women who served
as models for this reproduction â  " v

the house, a happy conclusion approved by the
family aptl society.
Charlotte Bronte ln her "Jane Eyre" was among
the first, to utilize the governess as the central
fik'iire in fiction. This personage, whose vicissi
tude* of fortune extending from the snubs and hu
miliations accompanying her daily life up to the
glory attending her marriage with a lord was ft
favorite characterisation with writers at that
period and later.
There now appeared the first great woman novel
ist, George Elliot, of whose choice delineations
none appeal to the heart so strongly as the ill
fated "Maggie Tulliver and none dwell so
tenaciously in the memory.
Ot the latter school, composed of Mrs. Ollphant,
Ward, Grand and the host of others, English an<l
American novelists, none thus far have succeeded
in creating characters bearing the stamp of per.
petulty. Josiali Alien's wife is recognized by the
down Easterners as typical of women in certain
localities in Yankeedom. These are provincial
types, appealing to the few only, and must soon, bo
forgotten.
The reasons why wora."n novelists have not
generally succeeded In creating types or in paint
ing nature ar^ obvious. In life women are for
bladeu by circumstances to contact with the world
in its greatness; custom enjoins that they shall be
1 shielded and protected from all but that which
relates to domesticity. Knowledge la said to take
from their personal charm, that charm being
necessary to their success in life, which means
marriage. Men drop the tone of their conversa
tion to meet the requirements of the smaller im
mature, untrained, feminine mind.
.â Women are taught to regard their weakness and
inability as fascinating powers, recommending
them to the kindly consideration of the stronger
sex. Thus ill-equipped for her task, when one at
tempts to write she cannot In her first fright es
cfrcte. disadvantages attending her prescribed
To-day our best women writers, rather than at
tempt to portray life as viewed from their re
stricted standpoint, waste their powers in the pro
duction of novels with a purpose. As a work of
art a novel showing no vestige of Its mechanism
and wholly free from the idiosyncrasies and indi
vidualities of the craftsman gives delight tofts
readers. A book tilled with automatic being*
strutting through its pages, who at the turning of
a screw mouth their stilted doctrines and forcln?
their ethics at every turn, is not a novel, though
it bear the name. Kvadne and Marcella, whose
sayings are but the echoes of Mrs. Ward's views,
are tedious beings, neither real nor Ideal.
The women in literature who will succeed must
be one with life,- then forgetting their own person
ality permit their creations to live and act in their
own way irrespective of ethics, as did the men and
women of Shakespeare. Shakespeare's genius
transcends environment and his women are veri
table realities to-day as they were in the past, and
must ever be. Imogen, Beatrice. Isabella, Cor
delia, Portia, Jessica, Ophelia, Rosalind, Desde
moua, Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth and Juliet all are
necessary to the plays In which they take an Im
portant part. These women are strongly vitalised
and breathe the breath of life. Thty are moved
by love, by hate, by great ambition, by Jealousy,
by all the ' passions whioh agitate the human
breast. Shakespeare drew from life with a broad
vision and with broad lines, therein differing from
the novelists who have produced characters to suit
their own preconceived Ideas of woman's place la
the family, the church and the state.
"I have been asked," observed Professor
>aphtaly Herz Imber, the cabalist, open
ing the discussion, "to state the position
01 oman according to Cabala. Moses ex
cluded women from active participation in
religious and civil matters. At the time
of the second temple tbe rabbis practically
shut out woman irora membership in the
synagogue. The Cabala, on the con-
I trary, stands for equality between them
! both."
Miss Severance was the next to discuss
the paper. {She said: "Truth is often
; stranger than, fiction and good fiction is
i crystallized truth.
j "The women of 'Walter Scott's novels
were just the women of the frontier.
: "The women of Dickens were very good
! sort of women, but narrow as a rule.
" It seems to me that fiction should have
a purpose. Harriet Beecher Stowe has
I written fiction that has had the created
force in < the novel of to-day. Fiction
should embellish truth and make it agree
able and presentable to thepublic."
Mrs. Haight had some thoughts on the
novel, bhe said:
â¢'The purpose of the novel with a pur
pose lies in one place, with the author.

Miss Thompson of the City school
department dwelt upon the necessity for
women to work together in order to gain
the noble end which equal suffragists are
laboring to attain.
"I am much obliged to you, Miss Thomp
son," rejoined the lady president, "for the
fine introduction you have made for this
message which has just arrived. Listen to
it! 'Woman suffrage indorsed. Now think
for victory in November. Anthony, Sar
gent, Shaw.' "
Cheer upon cheer resounded through
the hall. Handkerchiefs wera waved and
kid-eioved hands clapped lustily for sev
eral minutes. After the applauding ladies
had grown tired and quiet in some degree
was restored the second and last paper of
the afternoon was announced.
Miss Dorothea Roth, a student of the
University of Michigan and member of the
National college society of Kappa Alpha
Theta, had taken for her subject "Woman
in Poetry." She thus refers to the women
of Shakespeare:
We must judge of his ideas largely from the
characters he has now most sympathy lor. We
know so little about the lives Of BOOM pofta that
no hint comes to throw ilijht upon their poetic
creations. But. as beautiful laeals shine through
every one of Shakespeare's admirable women, we
may well apply tin 1 a posteriori method of reason
ing. There is Cordelia, the devoted daughter;
Uesdemona, the loving wife; Ophelia, the loyal
sweetheart: Miranda, the gentle maiden; Volum
nia. the courageous Roman mother; the intense
Juliet, aud the bewitching Rosalind â and where
'stop?
Each one is true to the main lines of her char
acter: any one might have been the poet's ideal.
The essential characteristic of all is that in
definable quality we all recognize us genuine
womanliness. I venture to say this appealed
most to Shakespeare. His Portia is to my mind
the best-rounded woman to borcow as a far
reaching prophecy. in the varioiA stages in the
development of her character she Is at once the
most typical woman of the past, the best repre
sentative of the loftiest womanhood of the present,
and who knows, perhaps, the fifth act of her life is
a prophecy of the peace that may grow out of this
discordant present?
Portia is in every sense, in my opinion, one of
the most charming, best balanced women in
poetry. She is an entertaining, a sensible, a capa
ble and a loving woman from first to last. When
her husband has gone on that grievous errand,
where she i* so intimately concerned, she wastes
'no time in sighing over her loneliness, but exer
cises the splendid gifts with which she is endowed.
That line, quick mind which can discern and dis
< riminate by a natural intuition comprehends in a
flash what the situation requires, and she succeeds
i;. her undertaking. That was inevitable. She is
a clear-headed and a brave woman, She has a
cause at heart and is not seeking se f-aKt-randize
tnent. She does not hesitate in uoubt- aud i>- r
plexity. And now .an this professional world, in
which she has covered herself with glory, hold
Uer? By no means. Her work Is done; with nil
spied she flies back to Beimontâ to where she
foela her nature has the greatest scope for useful
activity.
Miss Roth's paDer, from which die fore
going paragraphs are only a brief extract,
was warmly applauded. 1 -
Mrs. Alice Cooley, introduced by Mrs.
Cooper as "Fanchon the Cricket," had. this
to say about the new woman :
"She has taken advantage of me, ana
now wants me to say something. The new
woman it seems to me is the same woman
1 have known in the past.
"If the new woman should ao what
Shakespeare's heroines did in arraying
themselves in masculine attire, they would
be arrested.
"In Shakespeare's day, Juliet proposed,
and women can't do that to-day, ana there
are not so many marriages as' there used
to be."
. Before the adjournment the president
announced that the following message
would be sent in answer to the dispatch
from Sacramento if agreeable to the
congress:
- The Woman's Congress sends joyful, reverent
â and grateful greetings to Susan B. Anthony and
all other workers and to the convention In these
hours of victory- Sarah B. Cooper,
President of Congress.
The message was indorsed and cheered
to the echo, and the afternoon's session
ended with its being taken to the nearest
telegraph station.
EVENING SESSION.
The Largest Assemblage of Women
Ever Seen in the History of
the Pacific Coast.
"I come to you to-night victorious !"'
This was the Rev. Anna Shaw's greeting
to the thousand* who crowded every nook
and cranny of Native Sons' Hull last night
at the evening session ol the woman's con
gress.
i: Ladies and gentlemen," continued
Miss Shaw â 'or I should say, 'pentiemen
and ladies,' since that is the way in which
our chief, Miss Anthony, says ladies should
address a mixed audience â the men of
California have made us the happiest
women on earth. By indorsing woman
suffrage tt'ey have earned the gratitude of
every true woman's heart."
Cheer after cheer greeted this announce
ment. Ladies of high social standing rose
to their feet and hurrahed themselves
hoarse, waving handkerchiefs the while,
until the hall seemed to have been in
vaded by a fluttering of snow-white doves,
but for the mighty volume of sound.
Never since the opening of the congress
have so many been turned away from the
hall on account of its being physically im
possible for them to effect an entrance.
According to the unanimous assertion of
the leading spirits of the congress last
night's session was the largest gathering
of women ever seen on the Pacific Coast.
"Woman as She Was and as She Is"
was the topic considered in the first paper,
read by the Rev. Dr. Voorsanger. Along
with other good things he said:
A little ovpr a year ago a few Innocent remarks
of mine on the subject of woman's present status
In society procucd quiie a tempest in the teapot
of the Women's Press Association.
Homewhereâ l cannot recall the publicationâ l
lave seen a suggestive caricature of the woman of
tne twentieth century. The new woman is in all
respects the opposite of the woman of the past.
Her position and her relations to man are com
pletely reversed. She haÂ» become masculine, he
f'tniuine. she assumes the responsibilities of life,
he is the clinging creature who inspires a sense of
protection.
Khe determines the relations of society, the
weighty affairs of State, the ponderous intricacies
of business and economy, while he is reduced to
the low status of a piece of baggageâ that differs
from other chattels only in the fact that it will be
difficult to raise a mortgage upon him. Now, this
picture is what Is commonly called a caricature.
A caricature is a reduction ad absurdum of a large
number of facts oddly put together, but each of im
portance sufficient to cause speculation
The new woman, as she is called, is caricatured,
but there is no caricature ever conceived that is not
based upon some facts that deserve and demand
treatment, and that In themselves, standing upon
the single merit of being facts, indicate the neces
sity of reviewing the relations they represent.
And that is virtually the story of thi; new woman's
birth. The new woman is a symptom of coming
changes in society; he who disregards It Is ob
livious to the race. After all Bhe will bo the mother
of coming races and as such deserves the most
considerate treatment.
The main sentlmemof woman'to-day Is of dissat
isfaction. When cold history occupies the rostrum
and poetry and Imagination have adjourned the
while, it will be sepn that the two conditions abso
lute were violated in ancient civilization. Equality
was the expression of manly courtesy, but at no
time a fact. The woman was the domestic genius,
the minister, the sacred priestess of the lares and
peoates, the mother of men. to whom nerialned
. love and loyalty, respect and obedience. Hut she
was not strictly the equal of man. J here must be
no disparity in the relations of man to woman.
There must not be law tor the one and license
with the otherâ a standard of morality for man
and anotner for woman.
To-day the women speak out In meeting and
they are telling thÂ« old story In new words. It is
the story of inequality and a violation of the law of
mutuality. Who can nonestly say they are in the
wrong? Who dares to say that when a sensible,
educated woman puts her wrongs. If she have any,
In that light she is either a crank or an anarchist?
They are riÂ«ht enough, lÂ»od knows. If theie be
wrong in society it may be to the interest of the
one sex to perpetuate it, but nowadays the other
need not remain silent on that account. And the
wrong* done to womanhood are palpableenough.
You know with what easy confldei.ee men jus
tify extra-matrimonial relations, exacting from
women the most rigid, Dnsrtllled purity of act and
sentiment and thought. You know that men jus
tify their Reeking of social entertainment else
where, leaving the cares and burdens of the do
mestic establishment to their wives. Yon know
that men will gamble a.vay ihe very substance of
their children without so much as affording
woman an opportunity to give them warning
tgairist plunging headlong into the pool
of sptculation, You know that when a man
lavishes his gold upon won.nn he merely Indulges
her. Dutin big heart of hearts he does not believe
her to be his equal In all things.
Women know this and they begin to clamor for
the equilibrium of conditions. They are ri^ht,
even if the right cannot be vindicated to-day. The
new woman exists because man has not kept hit
vows, hit pledges, his contracts.
"The proper study of mankind is
woman," began Mii-s Elizabeth U. Yates
of Maine, who delivered the second ad
dress-, a ready, extemporaneous effort, on
"Woman as She Is Said to Be." She said
in part:
Poets, philosophers, sages, saints and prophets
have said and written much about women. The
much-marciitd Solomon and the unmarried l'aui
differed greatly in their estimate of the sex. But
both of them and "11 the wise and good men of
the world eoulu arrive pt no proper understanding
of what we <â  ill the ru w woman.
For myself 1 have never boen able to satisfy
myself as tn what kingdom she belongs, whether
to the nrumiil, vegetable or mineral, she has the
ferocity of a wild beast, a face of brass, and springs
up Hie Â» mushroom.

when a man says to her. Wilt thou? she wilts,
jiiroat laughter and applause.]
As the woman of to-day stands in full possession
of the beatitudes of all her powers the loaf is not
burnt nor is the babe neglected. We of to-day
see* for force which shall lead to results. Hence
we seek, even in poor, neglected woman, a power
lor good which may, perchance, have been ne
glected and ignored for long, dreary centuries.
And now this great StHto has avowed its need of
tins sweet, stronÂ« power of American womanhood
As Max <> BÂ«n once said: â¢â¢It I were to be born
again and had my choice of place and condition
and country I would pay: Let me be an American
woman. So say we all of us, [Great applause. J
'2 en tne ghid message came from
Sacramento," said Mrs. Cooper, "a dear
lady said, 'Let us sing hosanna.' Now we
have Alfred Wilkie with us, and he will do
our singing for us."
Mr. Wilkie gave a splendid ronderins of
Gounod's "Uosanna, Praise Be Thine."
â The Rev. Anna Shaw was then intro
duced amiu much applause. Her subject
was "Woman As She Will Be," and she
spoke extemporaneously as follows:
I have always refused to pose bb a prophet, and
yet to-night 1 am in the position of a prophet.
And vet I trust I shall be more nearly a prophet
than the correspondent of the Examiner who tele
graphed that there was not a woman suffragist in
Sacramento. It is not Uiiticr.lt to discuss man : but
the moment we begin to discuss woman we begin
to think of her as mother, as daughter, as bister,
but not as part of man.
WImB we consider man's usefulness in this world
we never stop to think that he is in any wÂ»y Hum
pered in his actions by the care of children: he is
free to do es he pleases. But when we think of
women it is always said tliat her home duty will
not permit of her doing anything else.
If you went across the continent, from the Pa
cific to the Atlantic, you would not liud a physi
cally normal woman, unless you found her among
the savages.
Before we can have the best and most perfect
womanhood anywhere woman must be pei^
niltted to develop normally. The new woman
must lirst of all be the gracefully developed
normal woman.
Kveu your youna university girls cannot ap
pear in gymnastic cos.ume tor tear of spoiling the
lender virtue oi your boys. What nonsense! The
maecnllne or feminine "virtue which needs such
careful guarding Is surely not worth mucii.
We want a well developed womanhood. What
if woman has four ounces less of brain than mini ?
Quantity, it seems io me, is of less Import, in this
connection than quality; and if woman does her
best to develop the few ounces of brain with wnlen
Ihe creator has endowed her, man will need his
extra four ounces.
It U suid that motherhood Is woman's highest
glory, but I deny this in toto. We know that back
of motherhood exist circumstances which are any-
"thins but glorious. I contend that goodness la the
crown of womanhood, as well as of manhood. â â â â - :
I must disagree with the rabbi's magnificent
paper in that pact which asserts that the men of
old respected woman.
They did respect the women who belonged to
them, but they were witling enough to degrade
women who were the property of other men, ami
to drag 'her virtue and their beauty through the
mire of beastly passion.
Nowadays we look tor something better. The
time Is nearly here, and men will be compelled to
respect her as her humanity deserves:
At this juncture Miss Anthony entered
the hall. She had just come from, the
train, but despite the fatigue consequent
upon her work at the Capitol and her tire
some trip from Sacramento, she addressed
a brief but stirring oration to the great
audience. Amid a veritable storm of ap
plause and the waving of countless pocket
handkerchiefs she said.
â¢ This looks almost as it did up at Sacra
mento. I don't like to break off Miss
Shaw's speech right in the middle."
â¢'Go on with it," prompted Miss Shaw,
"I'm glad to have you."
"My tirst lieutenant here," continued
Miss Anthony, "has just expressed senti
ments with which I heartily agree."
Then Miss Anthony called forward one
alter another of her co-workers and lieu
tenants at Sacramento and introduced
them to the immense throng of women.
"This is the tirst time in history," said
she agaiu, "that a dominant party has
passed a resolution favoring woman suf
tr;if.'P. By so doing to-day the Repub
licans have so pledged themselves that
their newspapers must ptand for the abso
lute political equality of men and women
in California.
"Third parties and fourth parties have
done this before, but never one of the great
parties.
"But we are not done, as 1 told the Re
publican. In two weeks we are going up
to Sacramento, where the People's party
has promised to put on its banners,
'Equality for all, injustice to none.' And
a week after we are going to Stockton to
the convention of tbat little party, the
Prohibition party, and receive its support.
Later we shall go before thajt other great
party, the Democratic party."
Miss Shaw then resumed her address:
There were four of us in one room at the hotel in
Sacramento last night, and Miss Anthony was one
of us. Twice she woke me and asked me If the
grand news was true. Would the convention
regard our wishes? I said it was true and we wouia
lind it so in the morning.
And, sure enough, only one voice was raised
against us, and thut voice came from a man who
was so good a husband that he could not vote (or
"wote," as he called it) in opposition to the wishes
Of the wife of his bosom. But Muss Anthony found
out that the same woman wanted most earnestly
to vote, and her husband's statement was founded
upon a thought less remark made by his wife
twenty years before. The memories of men are
wonderful.
But I must get back to my subject. We have
considered woman developed physically and intel
lectually. Now let us take a look at the mother.
The Kngllsh system, which gives the ballot to
widows and spinsters, seems to me to be at fatiit.
Ihe mother should have some right to protect her
child. And now lam going to make a point
which 1 have made before and for which I have
been roundly scored:
The woman is guilty of a crime who allows
another child to be born until she can have the
right to protect that child.
As for mothers, not all women are called to the
duties and the honors of physical maternity. I
doubt if any where a grander mother could be
found than Susan B. Anthony. [Great aoplause.]
Now, a word about the convention at Sacramento.
1 have been In many conventions iv many States,
and never have 1 seen a more orderly and court
eous assemblage. Men were polite to each other
and polite to us. Throughout the grand Capitol
placards were posted bearing the words, "So
smoking allowed in this building." 1 could not
wish to go to a more exemplary meeting than the
.Republican Convention at Sa> ramento.
If you will pardon my meandering I must give
woman one last word, since she regards it as a
right peculiarly hers, Solomon gives us the pic
ture of a valiant woman. Kead It on the pages of
inspiration and find Solomon's Ideal woman and
mine. For once 1 am clad to a?ree with a wise
man in his estimate of woman.
Great applause rewarded Miss Shaw's
eloquent words.
Dr. Voorsanger, however, took excep
tion to the reverend lady's views. He
.said :
"1 want to address a word to the men of
California to outline my position. The
question of suffrage of women is just an
incident in the great main question of the
recognition of the equality of se*es. If the
Republican partÂ»r is willing to put such a
plank in its platform, I am willing that it
should do so.
"I am willing to see every party eive it a
fair trial. If it be a mistake it will cer
tainly not be the first one. Suffrage has
not been a success everywhere. In some
places it has not been an unqualified auc
cess.ttries ol 'Where? where?']
"I believe tbat the great fault is tbat
women are not persistent enough in quali
fying themselves for their own success,
particularly in reaching for that physical
perfection Miss SI aw mentioned.
"If we could produce the result of 100
years of women not wearing corsets, of
women able to climb hills, to swim, of
women not putting poison paint on their
faces or dye on their hair, then not a man
wauld object to the absolute recognition of
woman on a basis of equality with them
selves.
"Ladies, I want now to tell the electors of
California that the school system of Cali
fornia iÂ« all wrong; there should be better
physical training in the schoolrooms.
"We are perfectly satisfied with Dr.
Voorsanger," rejoined Miss Shaw, "and
we will welcome his glorious type of
woman when she conies. I wonder whÂ«re
she will find a man worthy to walk be
side her through life. But this glorious
woman can never be evolved in her ful
ness and completeness until woman is
free. The day is come. VVe live in great
times anj I am glad that women are
in 'em."
It was announced tbat Miss Anthony
and Miss Sbaw would be in attendance
durintr the remaining sessions of the con
gress, am; amid a prolonged chorus of
ciiee.B an adjournment was taken until
to-day.

"THE STATE."
Mrs. Mary Praar Delivers a Lucid
and Learned Address
Thereon.
Mrs. Mary Prag, now and for the last
twenty years a teacher in the Girls' High
School of San Francisco, was one of the
most effective speakers on Tuesday's pro
gramme, and with a well modulated voice
and clear enunciation discussed "The
State" as a social and political institution.
She spoke as follows: ::.- 'â 'â 
The main governments of the world are of Aryan
origin, and the state in Its highest form is found
among them. While Semitic and Turanian races
have passed through similar forms of organization,
still it Is the state of the Aryan nation which has
had most to do in the formation of the civilization
of the world.
starting from its original ! spring In the valley of
the Uxus and Jaxartes. sending its Celtic, Teutonic,
Greco-Latin and Slavonic streams through Eu
rope to form its lakes and seas of government:
sending its clear rivulets and then Its mighty
rivers across the Atlantic to overflow the Western
continent, it may be destined some day, perhaps,
to flow together and form one great universal state
as broad as humanity and as deep as its Creator's
love, carrying on its bosom equality, liberty and
fraternity.
In glancing over the field of the world's history
to see what is the origin of the state we discover
first the '-family"; the family Increases and be
come the "gens"; the gens unite and form tribes,
the main ties being blood and religion, the leading
kinsman becomes the chief of the. tribe, finally for
various reasons of convenience the tribes unite and
we have the "state" of ancient history with the
king as its bead. The Idea of the state means
more than the mere reunion of tribes for defense
or attack; it conveys more than the mere idea of
kinship; although that is still strong, it means a
union, a political and, civil union, a union for
government.
The next theory is that of "original law," that
is, the binding together of one people into a
government by means of the law given them by
one man. The Hebrews had their Moses; the
Athenians their Solon; the Spartans their Lycur
gus; the Komans their XumÂ»; the Arabs their
.Mohammed.
Another theory is the "theological," which
regards the state as one of the direct creations of
the Almighty; it forms the foundation for the
belief in the divine right of kings. Ciod created the
state and anointed its ruler. This theory is true
only In so much ilia: the growth of 'the state was
spontaneous and based upon instincts implanted
in man by his Creator.
The state is LOt the result of agreement, con
tract or convention among men; it is a natural or
ganic development and is the only condition in
which man can achieve all he is capable of achiev-
Yam, /
Man is social being; he cannot exist socially
without government. and this government attains
us fullest perfection in Hint called civil society or
the state. This state Involves government of a
highly organized form.
In the state we have two great general forms of
government, the popular and the hi -o'.iae. each
claiming for its existence a basis o; reason and
nature.
But if the power be vested in the people, if they
enact the laws: settle questions of public policy
and choc s" oUlcers to carry them out, then we
have a democracy.
The government Is either good or bad according
to whether the object is the good of the governing
power or of the governed. In order to understand
the modern state it is necessary to know the an
cient and the medieval states In tbelr successive
periods of development. We find In the civiliza
tion of the ancients the one great thought of unity,
we see it in their literature, their manners, cus
toms, institutions. This idea of unity is the funda
mental idea of the state. The state signifies unity.
It is the unit In our civilization, the very word
civilization is derived from civltas â the state.
The last step in the evolution of government
was the modern state with its constitutional gov
ernment, a government based upon a written con
stitution which clearly defines the powers and
duties of the governing body, and the rights and
privileges of the people. The next development :
was the separation of the government into three
great departments, the executive, legislative and
judicial, coexisting, but with the jurisdiction of
each clearly outlined. All of these exist by and
at the pleasure of the people. The government is
the creature of the governed, Its duty to guide and
direct but no; to dictate.
The people express their will and their rulers
must see that the will thus expressed is carried
out. uuce more the people are the state. I
"What constitutes a state?
Men wno their duties know,
But know their rights, and knowing dare main
tain." ;:,Â°.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Guatemala Indians Exhibit Their
Skill in Music at the
Columbia.
A Great Spectacular Performance of
"Virginius" Seen at the
Grand.
"The Strange Adventuies of Miss
Brown" has been a little unfortunate in
being sandwiched in at the Baldwin be
tween two such strong attractions as Rich
ard Mansfield and Augustin Daly's com
pany. The farce-comedy is drawing â¢well,
notwithstanding, and tne absurd whimsi
calities of Eddy Foy and the rest of the
company are nightly greeted with hearty
laughter.
Primrose & West's Minstrels are filling
the California Theater and their jokes and
songs receive plenty of applause. There is
a great deal of sameness about all minstrel
shows, but the Primrose & West organiza
tion has done its best to infuse novelty
into its performance and there is a good
deal of genuine talent in the company.
The Morrison production of "Faust" is
drawing fairly well at the Columbia
Theater, the spectacular display in the
Brocken scene being evidently the
strongest feature in the performance from
a popular standpoint. "Faust" will be
given ior the rest of the week.
Yesterday afternoon the Guatemala In
dians gave an interesting exhibition at the
Columbia or their skill in playing the in
strument called tbe marimba.
The familiar strains of "The Chimes of
Normandy" continue to afford satisfaction
to Tivoli audiences. Next week there will
be a revival of "Fra Diavalo."
The good old tragedy of "Virginius" is
proving entirely satisfactory to patrons of
the Grand. The play has been acted in
this City many a time, and oft with famous
actors in the title-role, but it has seldom
been better staged.
"Our Boys," under its ridicuious situa
tions and comical characters, is arousing
plenty of laughter at Grover's Alcazar.
Leonard Grover is thoroughly in his ele
ment as Perkyn Middlewick, the retired
butterman, and tbe rest of the cast is
good.
John A. Ransome's impersonation of
"Boss" Croker of New York is still the
attraction at the Orpheum. Charlotte
Parry is a bright performer, but she is
scarcely gifted with Yvette Guilbert's pow
ers. The rest of the programme is up to
the Orpheum's standard.
That gifted horse, Sultan, and his fellow
equine performers continue to draw large
houses to the Auditorium.

The directors and trustees of the Young
Men's Christian Association building reported
at a meeting last Monday evening that $94 .
000 of the $150,000 indebtedness on the new
building bad been raised. The report also
states that the total amount of 594.000 was
given by Just forty-eight people and the great
mass oi j>eople has not been reached. Two
benefit entertainments will be given this
week In the building, an orchestral concert
to-night and a lecture by Rounsvelle Wild

WITHDRAWAL OF THE BROWNS
The Meeting Last N.ght the Last
That Will Be Held in the Old
Sacred Edifice.
The old First Church, for more than a
score of years the recognized leader of
Congregationalism on the Pacific Coast, is
to be sold at auction to the highest bid
der.
At least so much was decided on by the
trustees of the church and society at a
meeting held Tuesday night. The result
of this star chamber proceeding is seen in
the followine resolution, which was read
to the congregation last night. It was
not that they were expected to ratify it,
but the step was a mere formal notification
that^he place of worship which they had
known for so many years would be closea
to them forever:
Wiikhkas, The present financial condition
and future financial prospects of this church
and society offer no promise of improvement
with the church building in its present local
ity, therefore be it
Jicsolved, That it is the opinion of the board
of deacons, the standing committee and the
board of trustees that the church building be
at once closed and all expense-; discontinued,
except for a janitor to take care of the build
ing; and that the church building be sold
with as little delay as possible and the pro
ceeds applied to the erection of a new build"
iiii F in a more favorable location; and to this
end be it
Jirsolvid, That the trustees of the church be
requested to dispose oi the property on the
southeast corner of Post and Mason streets
Immediately, and with the proceeds purchase
a lot at some more eligible location to be de
cided upon by conference with the members of
the cnurch and society, and erect a suitable
building thereon, to be completed at such cost
as will enable the cuurch to commence wor
ship therein free from all debt.
Deacon Morse read the resolution with
as much concern as though he were refer
ring to an event of every day occurrence.
At the conclusion he proceeded, with tears
in his voice anrf a merry twinkle in his
eye, to tell his listeners something about
the church, its record and hia connection,
with it. He regretted sincerely the neces
sity which forced such a step, but was sat
isfied that all serious minded people would
concur in the action. Mr. Morse failed to
say, however, why such a step was neces
sary, though he'ereated the impression
that it was due to the financial condition,
us expressed in the resolution. Later Mr.
Morse said that if Brown had been left in
peaceful possession the First Church would
have prospered almost beyond human
conception.
He endeavored to create the impression
that his unfrocked friend was the only
minister, in good standing or bad, who
could have brought order out of chaos.
The action of the trustees in determining
to sell the church property shows that
Brown shorn of all Congregational rights
is as strong in one quarter at least as
when he first appeared as pastor.
Deacon Morse led the prayer-meeting
last night. There were a lew prayers and
hymns, and then he read the resolution
passed by the trustees in secret confer
ence. The question was not submitted to
the church. They accepted it without a
word of protest except from a most unex
pected quarter. Attorney Nagle, Brown's
close friend and adviser, made an abortive
attempt to have the church remain open
until tbe sale was perfected. Some argu
ment ensued, and then Morse put the mo
tion of Nagle. It was promptly voted
down. There will be no more service?
unless legal proceedings are adopted in
the First Church so long as it remains on
the corner of Post and Mason streets.
The senior deacon read the following
communication asking for letters of dis
missal:
Sax Franctsco, May 6, 189 G.
To the First Congregational Church of San
Francisco: We, the undersigned members of
this church, desire letters of dismissal and
recommendation to any evangelical church to
which in the providence of God we may be di
rected. Yours in tho bonds of Christian fel
lowship, Charles O. Rrown, Mary X. \V. Brown,
Valentine C. Brown, Vinoent W. Brown.
Morse then read what purported to be
the resignation of Deacon Vasconcellos,
filed with the board April 29. immediately
after Brown's official decapitation. It was
laid on the table, taken up again by
Brown's friends, and then, in spite of the
feeble protests of Mr. Vasconcellos, was
definitely and finally sat upon. Mr. Vas
concellos is still deacon in the First
church.
With the disposition of this piece of
business and a few more prayers, the
meeting adjourned. Sexton Pike is now
without an occupation and the pastor's
study door is padlocked inside and out.
It is probable that when tbe trustees
come to make the sale Ithey will find a
stumbling-block in their way. James
Neason gave formal notice of protest by
inquiring into the right of the trustees to
take any such step. Tbe church is in
aebt $6000, and the property is estimated
to be worth $130,C00.

Communications were received from the
Merchants' Association and the Van Ness
and Mission Improvement Clubs stating
they had not yet had time to appoint dele
gates.
George R. Fletcher, president of the
Point Lobos Improvement Club, cabled the
meeting to order with William P. Johnson
acting as secretary. In a brief but pointed
speech Mr. Fletcher stated the objects of
the organization. Chief among these he
declared to be the securing of a 2% cent
streetcar fare and a more just and logical
transfer system.
On motion of John Rafferty it was de
cided to postpone permanent organization
until the next meeting and that the officers
then acting continue to serve during the
meeting.
On motion of A. B. Maguire a commit
tee to act as a temporary executive com
mittee was appointed as follows:
L. J. Dwyer, Nuevo Potrero; Dr. T. F. Ford,

Addition; J. G. Maloney, Richmond; N. C.
Weanholz, Holly Park.
Dr. A. T. Rotanzi of the South Side Club
stated that the object of the club he rep
resented did not desire to enter the
political field, but they recognized the
necessity of haying the City government
in the hands of tax-payers instead of the
tax-eaters. "We should all together," he
said, "work for the good/ of the entire
City. Our club will always give earnest,
active support to any measure for the
good of the City."
~ James Bowian of the Western Addition
spoKe in favor of a 2VÂ£-cent fare on Sutro's
road in the Richmond district. James
Smith, in behalf of Mayor Sutro, explained
that the Sutro road incurs no more ex
pense in carrying a passenger from the
Cliff House to the ferries as from the Cliff
House to Central avenue.
He has only the Richmond district to
draw from. Major Smith explained, and
his road while it improves Mayor Sutro's
property also improves all the property in
that vicinity. "That road." he said, "is
being conducted on a losing basis and the
only hope it has of its paying is that it
may attract sufficient residents to the
district to put the roau on a paving basis."
Dr. Rotanzi suggested the propriety of
obtaining for San Francisco the location of
Wilmerding School.
J.Cx. Maloney of the Richmond district
said that the Improvement Club of Rich
mond was proud of Mayor Sutro and his
road.
P. H. Cahill of Folsom Improvement
Club No. 3 thought the people in San Fran
cisco could be carried as cheaply as postal
cards. "They load themselvs and they
unload themselves." he said. "I think we
should have a 2^-cent fare and the right
to transfer either way."
Numerous other members expressed
themselves in favor of the 2^-cent fare.
Dr. Salsfield made a motion, which was
carried unanimously, that it was the sense
of the meeting that the Wilmerding School
be located here.
The temporary executive committee will
meet a week from to-night to make ar
rancements for the second meeting of tne
federated rlubs, which will occur a week
from nest Monday.
FAILURE TO PROVIDE.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of \V. G.
Hughes, the Well-Known Build
ing Contractor.
A complaint was sworn to in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday for the arrest
of William G. Hughes, the well-known
building contractor, on the charge of fail
ure to provide.
The complaining witness is his wife, who
is now living at 2113 Webster street. The
couple separated about five years ago,
Hughes taking the two older children and
Mrs. Hughes the two younger. Hughes
agreed to pay her a monthly allowance for
the support of herself and the two chil
dren, and he was prompt in his payment
till last December.
"Since last December/ said Mrs.
Hughes, "my husband has only given me
50 cents. He has treated me most shame
fully. He is spending his money on other
women, and refuses to support me and the
two children. Even the two boys be took
at our separation are uncared for. One of
them is in Los Angeles and the other is
the prey of evil associates here. Ido not
want my husband sent to jail, but I want
him to live up to the agreement made
when we separated."
Hughes is now attending the Republican
convention at Sacramento, and will not be
arrested till he Returns to the City. His
friends say that 'he always gave his wife
money when he had it, and stopped his
payments only when he ran short of funds.
THE BOTTLED WILL.
Ottig Parsons' Ileira Claim Forgery
and Will Press for Dis
tribution.
The petition of the Jennie Parsons and
Ottis Parsons heirs for a final distribution
of the estate filed by Messrs. Gunnison,
Booth & Bartnett opens a new chapter In
the sensational bottled will case.
The will offered for probate by Mrs.
Brooks of Chicago a year and a half ago,
it will be recalled, was claimed to have
been found floating in a bottle in 1875 and
laid in concealment among other papers
in a bureau drawer for twenty years.
Mrs. Brooks died a few months ago and
E. C. Parsons, Talcott Parsons and Mrs.
V. Wheaden, the sole surviving heirs of
Ottis Parsons, who was drowned at the
same time his wife, Jennie, lost her life in
the foundering cf the steamer bound for
Portland in 1875, intend to push the peti
tion for settlement and brush aside all op
position.
The claim will be set up and urged that
the bottled will is a forgery. The attor
neys for the heirs say that even though
tbe forgery cannot be established, the will
does not comply w,ith the requirements of
an olographic will.
The Rich Le Koi Gold .'An*.
James F. Wardner, the widely known mining
man who has been operating in the Trail
Creek and other northern districts, who is
now in San Francisco, has received definite
figures showing that the product of the Le Roi
gold mine for the last three months has been
$100,000 over all expenses. The Le Rol is a
new mine, but Mr. Wardner thinks it is one of
the greatest properties probably that has been
discovered in the West. "The mine is owned
by W. R. Peyton, Judge George Turner, W. N.
D. Turner and J. R. Henley of Spokane," said
Mr. Wardner. "They are all lawyers, and I
think they have got a big thing. The ore is
what is called an auriferous sulphide. It is 4
per cent copper, 30 per cent sulprurets, 50
per cent iron and the remainder silicate and
coarse gold, averaging $00 a ton.
Wanted to Die.
Ella Gorman, who lives with a man named
Franks in Pollard Place, attempted to poison
herself yesterday afternoon. She swallowed a
wlneglassful of what she believed to be car
bolic acid. She was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol wagon and it was found
tlint the carbolic acid bad Lcen ao diluted that
she was in no danger.
SPIRITUALISTS
IN CONVENTION,
A Two Days' Mass-Meeting
to Be Held in This
City.
THE DATE NOT YET SET.
President Barrett of the National
Association Will
Preside.
PREPARATIONS IN PROGRESS.
Many Leading Speakers and Mediums
Will Be Presentâ Object of the
Meeting.
A two days' mass convention of all the
spiritualists in the State will be held in
Golden Gate Hall, Sutter street. Harrison
D. Barrett, president of the National
Spiritual Association, will be present and

prominent speakers, such as Dr. C Grat
tan, Mrs. C. Ellsworth and Dr. A. T. Hud
son, of Stockton, and T. H. Parker and
Dr. Bonestell, of Santa Cruz, will take part
in the convention.
The National Spiritual Association was
the result of a convention held in Chicago
in 1893 at the close of the Parliament of
Religions. It is an incorporated religious
body, with its headquarters at Washing
ton, D. 0. There are now in the United
States 2000 incorporated spiritualistic so
cieties, many of which own fine property.
In this City it is estimated there are about
5000 spiritualists. There will probably be
upward of 8000 people in attendance in
the State convention.
The date of the meeting has not yet been
set, but preparations are actively going on
to make the event an auspicious" one. AH
the leading mediums of the State will be
present and all phases of mediumship will
be demonstrated. New societies will be
organized and the principals of the order
thoroughly inculcated in the minds of the
membership and the public in general.
The authorities have prohibited the nse
of boric acid as a meat preservative. It is
said to be used largely by butchers and
rish-dealers.

years, a pound plug a week. 1 used two boxes of
A'o-To-Bac and have had no desire for tobacco
since. I gave two boxes of No-To-Bac to a man
named West who had used tobacco for forty-seven
years and two boxes to Mr. Whlteman, and neither
of them have used tobacco since, and say they have
no desire for it. Over fifty that I know of have
used No-To-Bac through my influence, and I only
know of one case where it did not cure, and then it
was the fault of the patient.
I was 64 years old last week. I have â  gaiped 17
pounds In flesh since I quit the use of tobacco.
You can use this letter, or any part of it, as you
wish. Yours respectfully,
C E. Hoi/brook, P. M.
You say it is wonderful. Indeed it is. No
To-Bac cured over 300,000 cases just as bad
You can be made well and strong by Ko-To-Bac
Your own druggist guarantees a cure. Get ooru r
booklet, "Don t Tobacco Pplt and Smoke Your
Life Away," written guarantee of cure and free
sample, mailed for the asking. Address The
Sterling Remedy Co., Chicago or New York.

Explanation.
The arrow flietwith the wind. The top figures
at station -indicate maximum temperature for the
days: tho^e underneath it. If any, the amount of
ralnrall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, conntct points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dcited lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiÂ«rh" means hiKh barometric pressure and
Is usnully accompanied by .fair weathur: â¢â¢low"
refers io low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weuther'and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Whm the pressure is high in thÂ« interioi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the â¢â¢low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "hUh" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
Weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
miil produce an opposite result.

1 NEW YORK, N. V.. May 6.-There was a mod
erate increase in business at the Stocic. Exchange
* to-day, but the market Is still under the control of
the professionals. - Outside interest, much to the
regret Of llie commission-houses, Is at very low
ebb, an<l the changes that oc:ur In prices from
day to day simply reflect the opinions of a half
dozen or so room trader*. At the start the ten
dency of prices was downward, i he comparatively
heavy withdrawals of roM from the sub-treasury
$2,300,000, the bulk of which Is for export, and
rumors that President Cleveland Intended to send
m warlike message to Congress on the Cuban ques
tion has assisted local bears In their work of de
pressing prices.
As of hue, the greatest' impression was made In
the industrials. These issues broke anywhere
from Ito â¢.â â¢â 5 4 per cent. Bay state Gas. Laclede
Gas, Tobacco. Sugar. General Electric and Rubber
common sqiTered the heaviest losses. The rallwav
list yielded only Vs to 1 per cent, notwithstanding
the pressure brought to bear by a well-known
operator. It is alleged that this trader nold nearly
6000 shares of the stock during the day. At the
afternoon session a firmer tone prevailed, the re
sult of covering of shor: contracts. Washington ad
vices indicating an enrly adjournment of Congress
led to the closing, up of contracts by certain bears.
The afternoon , rally, was equal to V4@- 8 per
ceu . Speculation closed about firm in tone. Net
changes show losses of Ys@% cent In the ral I
wny list and *4@1% in the industrials. In the In

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ilt_, May 6.â lnteresting features
either in the way of news or business were de
cdedly few In the wheat market to-day. The
only information aside from the usual statistical
Bgana and cables was that contained In the
Orange-Judd Farmer, which made its appearance
about noon. It made the condition or winter
wheat 88.4 against 87 a month ago. Private dis
patches from winter wheai points were equallt
satisfactory and encouraging. In the Northwest
showers still interfere with seeding, causing some
apprehension. The foreigu demand continues
light and clearances are small. The market
opened and remained tlrm daring the morning,
the retarded spring wheat seeding bring the main
Influence. The public announcement of the
OnÂ»nge-Judd Farmer report brought about a tem
porary decline later. Liverpool cables were
steady. Receipts were moderate, Chicago having
but three cars. The Northwest bad 238 cars
against 307 last Wednesday and 247 a year ago.
Local withdrawals from store were 136.200 bush
els, and Atlantic seaboard clearances of wheat
and flour aggregated 228,052 bushels. Along
toward the end of the session it win stated that the
Ohio stale report gave a material reduction In con
dition. This caused prices to rally ironi a weak
position taken when the Orange-Judd Farmer re
port was announced. Closing Paris cables were
unchanged for flour and unchanged to 10 centimes
lower for wheat. Berlin was l Vi@2 marks higher,
and Antwerp unchanged. July wheat opened
from 6Ji 8 c to 625/* c sold between 61" 8 c and
625 / i,@ti-23 / ic. closing at 62Vic. Vie higher than
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow ten
cars.
CORNâ Progress was of a negative sort in corn.
There was some slight enhancement In values
early, but It came about through the speculative
relationship with wheat, and not through any new
development or special merit attached to corn.
Business was slow and unimportant. Receipts
were 1-0 cars and 247.608 bushels were withdrawn
from store. Liverpool cables were quiet. Export
clearances amounted to 635,080 bushels, the larg
est In a long time. July corn opened at 29V&C,
sold at 2'.tr. (3..".t.- 4 c. closing at 39Mc bid. a shade
over yesterday. mated receipts for to-mor
row 1 bO cars. â â¢ :
OATSâ Were inactive, dull and featureless. The
market dragged throughout the session, even the
sympathy with the other markets having an in
different and indistinct effect. Receipts were 83
cars, and 129,000 bushels were withdrawn from
store. July oats closed a shade higher. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 128 cars.
FLAX â Was easy. Cash. b6c; May, 82V,c-
July. 843Â£ c; September, 86V*@87c Receipts were
23 cars.
PROVISIONSâ On strength conveyed from the
hog market provisions made a moderate gain at
the opening, but trade degenerated Into inactivity,
the lack of vim preventing any further advance.
July pork closed a shade higher, July lard and
ribs each a shade higher.

goods and steady for others to-day. Stocks were
well cleaned up, and receipts were moderate.

HAPPY WOMEN,

Champions Their
Cause.
A SUFFRAGIST COUNTY.
Great Growth of the Movement
Since the Campaign
Opened.
MRS. VROOMAN'S PLAIN WORDS.
She Says Every Woman in California
Should Be Proud of " The
Call."
Oakland Offick Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 5. )
Alameda County has long been given to
Woman suffrage, and when The Call an
nounced in its columns that it would help
the women of California thousands of
lovers of equal rights shouted a political
hallelujah.
Miss Moilie Conners, editor of Saturday
Night, devotes a large portion of her
paper to the various aspects of thesuffraga
question and is the secretary of the Ala
meda County Political Equality Society.
"It is the most gratifying tribute that a
great newspaper could pay to the women
of this State," said Miss Conners, "to help i
them obtain their rights at the ballot-box.
In this State, the proportion of women
property-owners to small owners is per
haps greater than that of any other State, i
and it is only a matter of time when the
Buff rage will be given them.
'Women's suffrage is bound to succeed,
for not only are there many arguments in
its favor, to prove that it is right, but now
society has taken it up, Mias Anthony has
been entertained by social leaders, and it
is now almost regarded as a virtue to
champion the cause."
Mrs. Henry Vrooman said, "I am proud
of The CA*LL*for the side it has taken, and
shall do all I can to aid it in this cam
paign. Women should vote because it is
right, and the right always triumphs.
"A candidate, in order to get the
women's vote, will use honest and moral
means (for the moral women outnumber
the immoral women), and should any
question of Jiorality be voted upon, the
women would carry it."
Mr.-. Lloyd Baldwin said: "I am very
much pleased with the way The Call is
working for us. I take an active interest
in this movement, and shall do all I can
in furtherance of it."
M rs. Sarah C. Sanford, secretary of the
â¢Humane Society, is a very pronounced ad
mirer of The Call's support. Mrs. San
ford is the wife of the County Treasurer,
and she was greatly disappointed that his
majority was not one more at the last
election.

Campbell, Mrs. Eliza Tupper-Wilkes, Mrs.

Bunnell, president of the Ebell Society,
and hundreds of other ladies prominent
in social circles are a unit in declaring
that The Calls stand is the right one.
It must not be thought that the women
are alone in these ideas, for such leaders
as W. R. Davis, Rev. Dr. Coyle, Rev. Dr.
McLean, Fred R. Stratton, Professor
Meads, Assemblyman Dodge, Rev. Philip
Graif, Rev. C. H. Hobart, Mayor Davie,
Councilman Bassett, City Attorney Peir
sol and numerous others have frequently
- stated their views in favor of equal rights.
The Political Equality Society of Ala

Hoon, but as all the ladies were attending
the Women's Congress in San Francisco
the meeting was postponed.
CAMPUS BEING IMPROVED
University Workmen Putting the
Grounds in Order for
Commencement.
They Don't Want Any Bondsâ Dr.
Watson Lectures Againâlnter
e sting News Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 6.â Carpenters
and gardeners are at work improving the
university building and grounds in prepa
ration for commencement. The depres
sions in the earth about North Hall are
being filled in with fertile soil in place of
the heavy clay which was excavated by
the "student laborers." A huge palm, the
expense of the purchasing and planting of
which was defrayed by the young lady
students, has been set out in front of
North Hall as a token of the interest taken
by the co-eds in the student labor
movement.
Just across the new rustic bridce, on a
gentle slope at the entrance to lovers'
lane, a huge "U C" in the form of a mono
gram is being planted by the university
gardeners. Yellow flowers are being used
in the makine of the letters and blue ones
will be set out later to form the back
ground. A general improvement in ap
pearance is being made on all parts of the
reservation.
Election of Firemen.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 6. âA meeting
of the Peralta Fire Company was held
last night, when the following officers
were nominated for the ensuing six
months: President, E. J. Lough; vice
president, William J. Miller; secretary,
C. E. Boag; treasurer, Bernard Gold
smith; foreman, D. J. Keane; assistant
foreman. Lawrence Heggerty.
. The proposed choice of a chief fireman
of all the companies in the town was dis
cussed, and it was decided to call a general
meeting of firemen to consider the matter
of consolidation as suggested. Street
Superintendent Guy H. Chick and Deputy
Superintendent J. W. Striker were present
at the meeting and made speeches favoring
the proposed union of fire companies. If
the plan should be carried ont the chief
fireman would probably be appointed by
the Town Trustees.
Four new members were proposed for
the Peralta company last nicht. Governor
Budd was elected an honorary member in
recognition of his exploits as a fire-lighter.
Doesn't Want Bond*.
BERKELEY. Cal.. May 6.â At the
meeting of the West Berkeley Progressive
Club last night W. J. Schmidt, a new
member of the club, made a speech in
opposition to the club's programme of se
curing the call of another bond election for
$iOO,OOO for schools and a wharf.
The club has appointed a special com
mittee to work against the direct tax that
â is to be voted upon on the 16th of this
month, with a view to holding the pro
posed boud election, and Mr. Schmidt's
vigorous opposition to any bonds created
something of a stir.
It was announced by J. T. Renas of the
committee in charge of the petition for
the election referred to, that signatures
were being readily obtained in all parts of
the town.

Glee Club Concert.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 6.â The Uni
versity of California Glee Club is malting
extensive and elaborate preparations for
their final concert of the term,
which will be given in Stiles Hall
next Saturday evening. A peculiar
interest attaches itself to the concert be
cause of tbe fact that such prominent
membors as H. P, Veeder, C. K. Morse,
Power Hutchins and Raymond Russ will
appear in the club for the last time before
graduation from college. Thomas Rick
ard and Miss Ardella Mills will be tne two
soloists.
The students believe that the concert
will be a fitting climax to the festivities of
class day and already several of the Greek
letter fraternities have made preparations
to entertain their friends at dinner and to
escort them to the concert hall.
The next time the club appears in pub
lic it will be entirely reorganized.

FABIOLA LADIES EXPLAIN,
Indignant at the Charge That
They Do Not Dispense
Charity.
The Rai' road's Patients and Business
Were Nearly Transferred to
Sacramento.
Oakland Office S att Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 6. j
The ladies of Fabiola Hospital met this
morning and they were very indignant at
the many unkind things which they claim
have been said about that institution in
connection with the recent fete.
Mrs. John Yule, president of the institu
tion, referred to certain letters that have
; been published saying that the hospital
was only patronized by people who could
! pay for their wants and men sent there by
the railroads. The opinion seemed to pre
vail that the best way to disprove the
charges would be to make Â» public state
ment of the amount oi charitable work
actually done by the hospital, but others
stated that the best course might be to let
! the matter rest.
Mrs. Yule made some statements that
created much surprise. She said that if
the railroad had not decided to make their
hospital headquarters here they would
have sent that much business to Sacra
mento.
"I think if any one investigates the mat
ter," said Mrs. Yule, "they would rind
that we take in a large number of charity
patients. As for our receiving the rail
road's patients, the head of the depart
ment said ii the injured men could not be
sent to Fabiola they would have to go to
Sacramento. By receiving the men at
Fabiola nearly a thousand dollars is
spent among Oakland tradesmen every
month for supplies nece.Â«sary for the in
jured men, most of whom reside in or near
this city.
"The charges recently made by persons
in the newspapers are not only unkind,
but unjust and unreasonable. There is
no reason why we should not receive the
injured men and every reason why we
should.
"The railroad men are more than
pleased to be at Fubiola. They tell me
that they were never so comfortable or so
well cared for in any other hospital, and
they are all delighted" with the place."
Mrs. Paul Lohse followed Mrs. Yule, and
supported all thai she had said. "If any
one cared to investigate the hospital rec
ords," she said, "they would find that we
took any number of charity cases irrespec
tive of religion or race. The institution
is carried on in the most broad-minded
manner possible."
The president, Mrs. Yule, informed the
ladies that she thought $l>oool > 000 would be
cleared from the fete for the hospital.
The late executive committee is winding
up its business as fast as possible, and
with the proceeds from souvenirs, conces
sions and tickets it is thought that Mrs.
Yule's estimate will be abdut correct.
DAVIE IS PUZZLED.
Wants to Know AVhy the Board of Edu
cation Aftkcd for a 817. 500
Sarplug.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 6.â Mayor Davie
thinks that the recent action of the Board
of Education regarding the closing of the
high school two weeks ahead of time is a
scheme to make hissl tax levy unpopular.
"I heard some time ago," said the
Mayor, "that the educators who wanted
more money in the school fund said they
would do something -to kill the $1 tax
levy, and this is their move."
The Mayor is much puzzled about the
extra $20,000 asked for by the Bosrd of
Education in its estimate. He said: "I
cannot see what was wanted of the $17 500
for they are only $2500 short. It could not
have been wanted to improve the high
school grounds, for a short time ago the
Board of Public Works passed a resolu
tion granting the high school committee
permission to use the park gardeners for
that purpose any time it wanted them and
I suppose the offer has never been ac
cepted."
THROWN FROM HER HORSE.
Miss Annie Swords of Temeical If Seri
ously Injured by ihe Fall.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 6.â Miss Annie
Swords, daughter of P. Bwords of Temes
cal, was thrown from her horse while out
riding last night. The accident occurred
at the corner of Grove and Sixteenth
streets and will probably prove to be very
serious. The young lady was conveyed to
her home in the patrol wagon, and when
a physician was summoned he found that
she was suffering from concussion of the
brain and thought that her skull was
lractured.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
HOW TO CLOSE A BRIDGE
Part of a Highway With an
Electric Road Running
Over It.
CONTROLLED BY A RECEIVER,
If the Street Superintendent Acts He
Will Be in Contempt of
Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 6. l"
A very remarkable state of affairs exists
regarding the Eighth-street bridge. It is
a portiou of one of the only two highways
between Broadway and East Oakland, and
has been placarded for months as unsafe.
The Street Superintendent has been in
structed to close the bridge, with the ex
ception of that portion used by the electric
road. That portion is sacred, as the road
is in the hands of a receiver and to inter
fere with it would be contempt of court.
Now comes the difficulty, for teams would
use the tracks as well as electric-cars and
cannot be prevented from so doing.
The bridge will be fenced in outside of
the tracks only, if the Mayor will sign the
requisition for the necessary lumber. He
says he will not as there is no necessity to
close the bridge, as the needed repairs can
be made without interfering in any way
with traffic.
The receiver of the road, J. C. Johnson,
said to-day: "I would not care if they
did cut oft the tracks. For my part it can
be closed as' well as not. I will not give
my consent to blocking up our track,
however."
E. P. Vandercook, the superintendent
of the road, considers the action of the
Council very arbitrary.
'"Why," he said, "that portion of the
bridge over which our cars run is perfectly
safe. The planking on the sides may be
\Â«orn out, but that has nothing to do with
our cars. There is not one rotten pile
under the bridge at the place where our
cars run. I have had the opinion of an
expert to the effect that the structure is
entirely safe for a number of years to
come. It would serve the Council rignt if
every road in town would refuse to run
cars, and then we could get some decent
treatment from them."
Since the Eighth-street electric line was
built, which was the first road to cross the
estuary, two other lines have been opened,
as they both come in to the upper end of
Broadway, whither business is fast going,
they have drawn a large portion of the
Eighth-street patronage. This is probably
why the receiver does not care much
whether they cut off the road in the mid
die or not.
Sabbath Observance.
SAN LEANDBO, Cal., May 6.â There
was a largely attended meeting at the
Presbyterian Church Monday evening, in
the interest of Sabbath observance. Tlie
Trustees came in for severe criticism for
granting one of the public parks for a ball
ground, when they were luily aware that
the principal games were to be played on
Sunday, and in the face of the protest of
the citizens in the vicinity. The matter
has aroused much feeling and will be
made the subject of further action.
Carnival Fever.
CENTERVILLE, Cal., May 6.â The
Centerville Athletic Club will open their

again later and had to pay double the tine
for his trick.

WILSON'S FIGURES.
They Are a Few Thousand Smaller
Than the Estimate Hade bj
the Mayor.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 6.â City Engi
neer Wilson looked through the Auditor's
books this morning for expenses con
nected with his office, and said: "I find
that I have been charged by the Mayor's
statement to the Council with something
over $2000 too much.
"Wnere the Mayor pets his figures is
more than I know, bat these I made from
the books of the Auditor, whom I consider
the city bookkeeper. The Mayor says I
spent $8399, I believe, while I find that
$6426 is all I have drawn.
"To compare these fipures;with the ex
pense of running the office in the past.it
is but fair to deduct tbe expenses now
attached to the office which were not at
tached to it before. Those are: $!XX> a
year for rent, $<50 lor janitor service, $33 70
for fuel and fOQO Â»* m y pay for beinj: a
member of the Board oi Public Works,
which formerly cost the City $2400. Taking
this money off, the engineer's office has
cost $4820, which is lower than Morgan's
was for 1894-95 or 1893-94. Those years
cost respectiveiy $5558 and $7660. In
1592-93. the Mayor says, the office was run
for $24*0. He completely overlooks a suit
for $1970 which Morgan now has againnt
the City for fees which he did not collect
that year, because of his failure to get his
bill in in time."
EXEMPT FIRE COMPANY,
Alaineda Willing to Assist in
Fighting the Appeal of the
Oakland Council.
E ectric Poles Not Yet Erected.
Parade of City Water Carts.
Two Accidents.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 6.â The Exempt
Fire Company met this evening in the
City Recorder's courtroom to consider
what action should be taken in reference
to the appeal to the Supreme Court ques
tioning the law under which exempt fire
companies came into existence.
In Oakland Mayor Davie appointed the
trustees of the relief fund in conformity
with the law. The Council, however, in
fixing the tax levy made no provision for
the creation of a relief fund. A claim for
relief was passed by the trustees and ap
proved by the Auditor, but has never been
paid. Mandamus proceedings in the
Superior Court resulted in a decision to
uphold the law. The city of Oakland at
once gave notice of appeal, and it is with
reference to this that the local company
decided to co-operate with the Oakland
company. The committee appointed to
look into the matter repovted that
Alameda's assistance was co'/dially wel
comed. W, W. l'oote had offered his
services as counsel, G. de Golia would
attend to tne drawing up and service of
the papers, so that the cost at present as
far as could be seen would not exceed $25.
Should it go beyond that the Oakland
company would be glad of such financial
assistance as the Alameda company might
by willing to contribute.

The Poles Not Up Yet.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 6.â Delanoy's
electric poles bave come. They ought to

age was found to be cheaper than haulage
by rail. The plans were changed and the
water route chosen for economical reasons.
Late last night Mr. Delanoy sought his
legal adviser to know what was to be done.
He had seen the City Marshal and asked
him what his intentions were. "Simply,"
said the Marshal, "to arrest every one and
any one found interfering with the public
highways without a permit."
"The poles will be here by daylight, and
what are we going to do about it?" asked
Mr. Delanoy.
"Why, just go right ahead and provide
yourself with bondsmen," replied Counsel
liruner.
The question now is whether the com
pany will not be bonded before it is incor
porated. So far no poles have been
erected. To-morrow morning, however, it
is authoritatively stated ground will be
broken.
What It All Meant.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 6.â Pedestrians
this morning were astonished to see a long
cavalcade oi painted carts in toe seven
primary colors, driven by men in top hats
and white-lisle gloves. The children
thought it was a new kind of circus come
to town, while some of the older folk
guessed it must be the first cargo of poles
Tor Delanoy's electric plant. Others more
astute maintained it was a parade in honor
of Colonel Babcock's primary delegates
being seaied in the Si ate Convention at
It turned out to be the nine city water
carts, driven by the teams of Lubben
Bros., who have just been awarded the
contract for street-sprinkling. The parade
was to mark the commencement of the
new order of things. In future saltwater
pumped by the city's light plant will be
used to lay the du^t and a considerable
saving to the city De effected.

JOKED IN AN ORDINANCE.
An Additional License Imposed
on Hundreds of Salcon
Men.
IT CANNOT NOW BE REVOKED.
â¢The Supervisors Introduced It Very
Quietly â A Mild Sensation When
It Was Discovered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
%8 Broadway, May 6. \
An ordinance poes into effect to-morrow
that will increase the licences of over
three hundred saloons in cities and towns
of Aiameda County $30 per quarter.
Although the result of the new law is
probably the result of an oversight on the
part of the person who drew it up, it is not
within the jurisdiction of the Supervisors
to correct it, in view of the opinion ren
dered a few days ago by the District At
torney in the Bornian liquor case.
For several years tne liquor-license tax
has been collected by an appointed License
Collector, but recently the Supreme Court
decided this to be illegal. This caused the
board to pass a new liquor-license ordi
nance, whereby it was to be made the
duty of the County Tax Collector to col
lect this tax. The board requested the
District Attorney's office to prepare and
submit the new ordinance. After (several
weeks the matter was reported back and
adopted. In it the following sections ap
pear;
Section 6. The license tax under this section
of said ordinance shall be as follows: For
every person, firm or corporation engaged in
the business of selling, or givinc away, or in
any manner furnishing in any saloon, bar,
â tand, or in any other place of business, or in
any public place in the county of Alameda,
and for every person, firm or corporation who
sells or offers to sell, or keeps for the purpose
of sale, within the said county of Alameda, aiiy
spirituous, malt, or fermented liquors or wines
or any admixture thereof, $30 per quar
ter, payable in advance, to the tax
collector of the county of Alame
da, at the office of said tax collector,
at the Courthouse of the sr.id county of Ala
meda; provided that druggists and apotheca
ries shall not bo required to obtain a license
under the provisions of this ordinance for fur
nishing liquors upon the written prescription
of a regularly licensed and registered uhysi
c an, such liquor in no case to be used ordriink
upon the premises, nor for supplying alcohol,
or preparations containing the same, for sci
entific, mechanical, medical or medicinal pur
poses; provided further, that no spirituous,
malt or vinous liquors shall be sold or fur
nished more than once on any one prescrip
tion of such physician, and that no physician
shall prescribe any Intoxicating liouors as a
beverage to any person addicted to the inordi
nate use of intoxicating liquors.
Section 16. Every person who shall, within
the county of Alameda, keep or assist in keep
ing any saloon, bar, store, dramshop, tippling
place, stand or any other place where any
spirituous, malt or fermented liquors or
wines, or any admixture thereof are sold or
given away, without having first procured the
permit and license required therefor by*the
provisions of this ordinance, or who shall sell
or give away withiu the county of Alameda
any spirituous, malt or fermented liquors or
wines, or any admixture thereof- without first
having procured the permit and license re
quired by the provisions of this ordinance, or
after the came may have been revoked by the
Board ot Supervisors as in this ordinance pro
vided, and any person who shall conduct or
carry on any business, occupation or calling
for which a license tax is required by the pro
visions of tnis ordinance without having first
procured the license required by this ordi
nance, shall be deemed guilty of a misde
meanor.
The document was a big one and very
little attention was paid to the reading.
Several asked if it was any different from
the old ordinance except in making the
collections a duty of the County Tax Col
lector ana they weie assured that it was
not. The ordinance was adopted and
ordered published as required by law. It
goes into effect Friday and at the same
time repeals all ordinances in conflict with
its terms.
It was- discovered to-day by interested
liquor dealers, that in drawing the ordi
nance the words "outside of incorporated
cities and towns" had been omitted.
Whether this was by design or whether it
was done sÂ« as to collect a license from all
liqaor dealers within the corporate limits
of the towns and cities of the county is
not yet known, but it has created a sensa
tion.
The District Attorney, in an opinion to
the Supervisors regarding their power to
revoke a liquor license that it was con
tended had been granted illegally, after
quoting the Supreme Court, says:
As the granting of the license would be the
final act of the board upon the petition for a
permit the jurisdiction of the board would be
exnausted upon such action being taken; con
sequently, under the above rule, laid down by
our Supreme Court, it would be impossible for
the board to take further or any action in
this proceeding, and the only remedy in the
premises would be an application to the courts
either to review by certiorari, or by an equit
able action to set aside the proceedings of the
board.
Now if he holds to that decision there
will be a mad set of liquor-men. At pres
ent there are in the city of Oakland 220
liquor establishments that will come under
the law, in Alameda 23, Berkeley 17, Hay
wards 20, San Leandro 16, Pleasanton 13
ana Livermore 27; total 33(3. This would
be an annual income in addition to what
has heretofore been received by thecounty
from the liquor-men of about $40,320.
On the other hand, if it was the inten
tion of the Supervisors to impose a county
license upon the city dealers they were
very careful to keep the matter a profound
secret. At the time the ordinance was
passed Supervisor Church said to a re
porter: "There is no change in the ordi
nance whatever except the provision to
provide for their collection." Supervisors
Pelouze and Johnson made similar state
ments.
LIBRARY AFFAIRS.
Heading Room* Mast Be Closed One
Month if Funds are Not
Forthcoming.
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 6.â The trustees
of the Free Public Library have replied to
a recent communication from the Mayor,
as follows:
Hon. J. L. Davie, Mayor of the city of Oak
landâDear Sir: Your communication is re
ceived, suggesting that this board should send
in lists of supplies used in the library and
readme rooms, in order that bids for furnish
ing the SMine may be advertised for by the
Board of Public Works.
The Board of Free Library Trustees has no
connection with other departments of the city
government. It has obtained bids annually
for furnishing supplies, and the Board of
Public Works could not legally advertise for
them. We shall always welcome any sugges
tion from the Mayor and other city officers
concerning the conduct of the free library and
reading rooms, as we will also from any citizen
interested In their welfare.
The following resolution was also adopted
as showing the condition of affairs and the
intention of the board if relief wag not
afforded :
Resolved. That owing to the deficit which
wouid otherwise occur, all reading-rooms be
and the same ure closed from June 1 to the
beginning of the next fiscal year (July 1, 1890),
unless sufficient funds be obtained from the
City Council by transfer to maintain the read
ing-rooms.

driver was thrown to the ground, narrowly
escaping serious injuries.

WANTS TO SUE A CONSUL
Miss Stevens, an Heiress, Says
He Borrowed Money From
Her and Forgot It.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 6.â Mrs. Annie
Stevens of Washington street, who has
been notifi-d that a fortune awaits her.in
SusÃex County, England, told her story to
day.
She claims that she will institute civil
action against the estate of the British
Vice-Consul Mason. She claims that she
and her husband met Mason shortly after
their marriage and when she had money
and he did considerable business for them.
Mason came to them and wanted to bor
row $1000 on a personal note. This was to be
used in erecting his country home in Sau
salito. She claims she advanced this
money, which he agreed to return on de
mand. She bougnt a ranch in Sonoma
County, but soon found that money was
needed. She applied to Ma^on, who did
not have the cash, but offered her a pair of
diamond bracelets and a diamond ring to
square the account, which was'refused as
the cash "was needed. The farm was
mortgaged, and when that fell due an
other appeal was made to Mason to pay
up, but he died before the matter was
settled.
Stevens lost the note from his pocket
about this time and the couple returned
to Oakland penniless and shortly after
j Stevens died, leaving the widow in pov
erty. In speaking of her troubles to-day
she said:
"You know the 'Johnny Bulls' stick
close together, and on account of Henry's
friendship with Mason we let him have
money. We have never received any in
terest on the principal, which now
amounts to $1200. If he had paid this we
should be on the ranch yet, and my hus
band would now.be alive. I suppose if
Mason had not died so suddenly we
might have been paid the money, but
after Henry lost the note they refused to
do anything for us.
"An uncle of Henry's In Sussex has left
his fortune to me. All I know about it is
that the amount is big, and before his
death Henry was always expecting it. He
was the only surviving heir, and now that
he is gone I am the one entitled to the
money.
"Henry used to say quite often, 'If that
o'A fool would only die we might live In
luxury,' but I used to tell my husband
that he might die first, and sure enough
he did.
"I do not know what this uncle's busi
ness was, but I am sure he lived in a big
castle in England. I guess he was a duke
or knight. The Consul has written to Eng
land for me and we expect word in a short
time. When I get the money I will sue
for the amount Mason owed me and then
build me a nice home."
Intellectual Idealism Defended.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 6.â lnterest in
the course of philosophical lectures, which
is being Riven by Dr. John Watson of
Queen's University before the Philosophi
cal Union of the State University, con
tinues with unabated interest. To-night
he gave the third of the series of five dis
courses at Stiles' Hall, taking for his
topic "A Defense of Intellectual Idealism."
At the close of the lecture a discussion
was held on Dr. Watson's wort on
"Compte, Mill and Spencer,'' w. ich book
tne union has been reading during the
past year.
The lecture was of a purely technical
nature and the audionce, which consisted
of about 200, was confined chiefly to mem
bers of the union. A continuation of the
same lecture will be made to-morrow
evening at the same hall.

HE HAS BUILT
HIS OWN COFFIN
W. B. Bradbury Completes

Several Years.
HAS SEEN THAT IT FITS
Designed After the Style of Gar
field's Casket, but More
Substantial.
REFUSED AN OFFER TO SELL
Made Three of a Kind at Reduced
Cost, Solid Bronze, for Him
self and Wives.
W. B. Bradbury, who lives in a mansion
at the corner of California street and Van
Ness avenue, has just completed three of
the finest coffins ever made in this coun
W. B. Bradbury and the Coffin He Has Built for Himself and the Mausoleum, Built of Solid Concrete in
Which He Will Rest.
try. One is for himself, the other is for
his wife, and the third is fora former wife,
who has been dead some twent3'-eight
years. The body of the first wife is, so to
speak, the first to enjoy the new and hand
some bronze. It has been disinterred, and
inclosed in the casket has been placed in Ms.
Bradbury's mausoleum on the hill in the
Masonic Cemetery. The otner two coffins
are there also, awaiting the coming of the
other two.
The coffins and the mausoleum have
been several years under construction,
and have in a measure served as a diver
sion to Mr. Bradbury, who, one time a
prominent contractor and millman, re
tiredfrom business several years since.
This work of preparation for the inevita
ble is by no means prompted on the part
of Mr. Bradbury by any feeling of the im
mediate need of a coffin. There are not
many sturdier, healthier or happier men
in the City.
Certain misfit coffins, certain imposi
tions by undertakers on weeping survivors,
certain shallow pretenders in the matter
of digging graves, certain shocking ingrati
tudes and weeds and small marking stones
where should have ripen monuments, have
chanced under his observation in his life
time and caused him to swear by the coffin
of Mahomet as well as by the coffin of
Bradbury that such things shall not occur
in his case.
So he went and had himself measured
and drew the plans, and gradually as it
went along became so fascinated with the
work of making his own coffin that he
finally not only wrought out what he con
siders the very handsomest in the land,
but made three of them.
He has made a nouse for the coflms

that he is willing to wager has not a
counterpart in the country and above all
will not leak. All the others leak-
Flood's and Fair's and Baldwin's and
Colonel Frye'sâ all of them, he says, be
cause they are made of granite. Granite
has crevices, and he has made his of con
crete, a solid block; used such a propor

unheard of in ord inary construction ; care
fully selected the granite chips, broken
them to proper size, and now as he looks
into the mtie house he is satisfied it will
never leak.

the catacombs or shelves for the caskets,
are amply big, for he remembers the case
of Millionaire Garratt who had prepared
his own grave, but had taken no thought
of a possible growtn in girth afterward,
and bo when his body was brought to
burial it could not be lowered into it. The
mausoleum is a security against weeds,
too, and with an absolute deed to the lot,
the title of which was made sure after
weeks of patient searching and correcting
of the records, Mr. Bradbury declares he
has "the dead cinch on the future," that
there can be no hitch in his funeral cere
mony, no plundering of his widow by un
dertakers, nor can his grave suffer greatly
from neglect.
"I'll tell you how I came to get into
this thing." said Mr. Bradbury yesterday.
"I had a friend, W. H. Mills, a land specu
lator, a lawyer and a Mason. He had ac
cumulated a fortune of some $200,000,
which, when he died went to his son, a
young man about 22 years of age. The
boy was away East when his father died,
and the train that brought him back was
caught in the snow. The body was en
balmed and lay lor two weeks before the
boy got here. When he arrived I discov
ered him to be completely broken down
with grief. A suggestion that the funeral
take place on Sundav â he arrived Satur
day â shocked him. I prevailed, however,
and we rushed things a little, for nothing
had been done. I took him to a casket
works and he picked out a coffin. 'What
was the price?' '$375,' said the man, who
toad found out that the deceased was worth
money.
" 'Is'nt that rather dear?' asked the boy.
" 'It is tue last service you can render
your father,' said the man.
"That made me hot and I turned loose
upon the coffin-maker. I told he should
not rob this boy simply because he had
lost his only relative and was grief
stricken.
"1 told him that this funeral must be
conducted properly and must not cost too
much either. I asked the price of the cof
fin adjoining the other and which was ex
actly like it, except that the molding had
a little different curl to it. It was $125,
instead of $375. Then I inquired about
the balance of the bill. The embalming,
lor instance, was cnarged $2o for tue first
injection and $100 for a second that was
deemed necessary.
" 'What professor of chemistry did you
have to do this work? 1 I asked. 'None?
Certainly not; one of the hands at $6 or
$8 a week did this work. You injected a
little arsenic into the veins. Just scratch
that $100 off the bill.' And he did it with
out a word.
"Now that is the first chapter; but, by
the way, I might as well end the story of
Mills. Shortly after the death of the
father this young man married and six
motnbs after that he died. His bride we
had great trouble with. We thought she was
Koing to die of grief. She fainted and had
hysteria at home and out at the grave she
fell upon the coffin ana fainted again. It
was really very pitiable.
"By the young man's will all the for
tune that old man Mills had labored for
and won fell into her hands â a stranger.
"The father and son were laid side by
side. Some of us were out at the Masonic
burying ground some time after the
funeral, and we noticed that the work of
building the monument which had been
proposed was not yet begun, and one of us
said he would call upon the young widow
in the City and see about it.
"He did so. 'Well,' she said, 'yes, I did
think of building a monument for the two
of them ; but I guess a couple of markero
will do. I'll put up a couple of markers.'
"You Know what markers are? Those
little headstones just peeping above the
ground. That was several years aero, and
a couple of markers Is all'that is there
to-day.
"Then I bad another friend, W. T. Gar
ratt, the iron-founder and pump-man. He
undertook to make provision against death
and burial. He bought a lot in the ceme
tery, and became so incensed at the
way it was neglected, and the weeds
allowed to gather there, that he paved the
surface of it with basalt blocksâ just ex
actly like that street there. He said he
would fix it, so that the weeds, at least,
had no chance. He also prepared his
grave, had the hole dug and walled up.
His body, when he died, was taken to the
receiving vault, and when it waÂ« deter
mined to bury it the question arose among
the few friends gathered there as to bow
the body should be conveyed from the
vault to the grave. Some one suggested
that it be pat in one of the cemetery carts.
'No.' said another, 'the body of Garratt
shall never be put into a cart.' So they .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1896.
telephoned to the City for a hearse, and
j the body was properly hauled to the side
of the grave. But when they undertook
to lower the coffin they found that it was
much too long for the hole.
"Garratt had grown much stouter after he
was measured for his grave, and the un
dertaker, not wishing to make a short,
dumpy coffin, had lengthened it out in
proportion until it was too long for the
frave, that, as I say, nail been walled up.
t could not be stretched and so it became
necessary to postpone the interment, and
the body had to be taken back to the re
ceiving vault. We looked around for the
hearse. It had been dismissed and was no
where to be seen. There was no alterna
tive; we had to put the body of Qarratt
into a cart to haul it back to the vault.
"Then there was the case of young Mc-
Pherson, who sold his family's mauso
leum, took out the bodies of his father and
mother and others of the family and
buried them in $10 graves.
"These and a few other incidents of the
kind taupht me the propriety of making
ready for death and making ready right.
"At the time of the Garratt incident I
had not so much as thought of buying a
burial lot. My wife said to me 'Let us stay
here and look about.' We did so. We let
the carriage go to town while we went up
on the hill. Colonel Frye's mausoleum
has a beautiful view all over town. We
found that the adjoining lot was not taken.
My wife liked the spot. I bought it. I
spenl weeks correcting technicalities in
the records and so on, so that the title
would be perfect. Then I decided to build
a mausoleum. I saw that the others built
of granite aJI leaked, as I have said, and 1
made mine of concrete â one solid block.
"I did a good deal of nosing round the
cemeteries during the progress of the
work. I looKed through those little peep
holes in mausoleums and saw that the
caskets made of iron were often rusted
away. There was one 1 noticed had lain
there for twenty years, perhaps, and there
was a heap ot iron rust on each side â
probably ha.d holes in the top, I could nnt
see. Well, I determined that that would
not do. I must make better arrangements
than that. I went to seÂ« the coffin-maker
and asked him the price of a coflin â a
good one. He named $5000. I told him it
was too much. 'Who is your undertaker?'
he asked. I told him I nad none. 'Then
you can't get a coffin,' be said. 'I'll go
somewhere else,' I said. 'But you can't
get a coffin anywhere in the United States
unless you have an undertaker.' he said.
'Why not?' 'There is a big combine cov
ering the whole country.' 'But the coffin
is for myself. I don't need an undertaker
for a little while,' I said. 'Ah. that is dif
ferent,' he admitted.
"I had him take my measure with olentv
of room. Then I said^ 'The combine cannot
prevent my making a coffir. for myself, 1
guess?' He agreed that it could not.
"Then I went to an undertaker whom l
knew, and I said, 'What Is the handsomest
coffin you ever saw ?' He said that of Pres
ident tiarfield.
"He brought out a book and showed me
the picture of it. I borrowed the book, and
at my home I made detail diawings of the
same thing. I took my drawings to a one
time engineer friend of mine and for $125
he madeDatterns.
"Instead of paying 4 cents a pound for
iron I paid 25 cents a pound and got
bronze. Garfield's casket is a sort of sheet
bronze neatly put together. Mine is cast
in solid pieces. Garfield's cost $1200. I
made three caskets and they cost me al
together ?1000. I went East and stopped
at Cleveland and saw Garfield's casket.
Mine is as far superior to it as Garfield's is
to an ordinary c ftin.
"The three caskets were in the mean
time sent round to the undertaker's and he
put them on exhibition. When 1 returned
he said to me, 'I have an offer for one of
tnose caskets. I can sell it for as much as
all three cost you.'
"Now," said Mr. Bradbury, "I am a
business man and have been accustomed
to turn an honest dollar when I could, but
I draw the line at this.
"I said, 4 No, I'll be hanged if I'll traffic
in my own coffin.' I refused.
"The mausoleum was complete. I went
out with my wife and we had the gaskets
placed. She said, 'You can lie there and 1
will lie here, and you can place the other
there on the other side.' So I did. I had
my tirst wife disinterred and placed in the
new casket in the mausoleum, and the
other caskets are there ready.
"Now, why ain't that nil right? I tell
you, I have seen so much of this work
about the dead and about cemeteries. I
have seen more shams and frauds there
thau anywnere. There is a cheat about
nearly everything they put under the
ground. I have done mine myself, and I
know how it is done. Better than most I
assure you. Why not cremation? No, I
never had much fancy for either fire or
water. When Gabriel blows his trumpet
I want to be there; I want to know where
I am at.*'

THEIR POWERS LIMITED,
Fx-Judge Garber Attempts to De
fine the Commission's
Authority.
TO EEGULATE CHARGES ONLY.
Counsel for the Railroad Says the
Validity of Its Leases Cannot Be
Attacked Collaterally.
Ex-Judge John Qarber yesterday con
tinued his argument for the railroad in
the intervention suit.
As on the previous day much of his
speech was directed to explaining why the
Pacific railroads constituted one system.
Judge McKenna seemed to take a special
interest in this proposition and frequently
asked the speaker questions.
The gist of Mr. Garber's argument
was as follows:
"The commission had no authority to
inquire into the validity of these cases.
The constitution says that the said Com
missioners shall have the power and
authority to establish rates lor the trans
portation of passengers and freight by
any railroad and transportation company.
According to the construction of the con
stitution given by the Supreme Court of
the State of California tue commission
was held to be partly judicial, and this
construction I maintain must be taken by
this court as final. The Supreme Court of
this State has decided the organic law of
this State to say that by fixing rates is
meant fixing just and reasonable rates.
"Those constructions of the constitution
of California are binding on this court.
The answer given to this contention is
that those constructions did not refer to
this identical provision. It is the declara
tion of a principle in relation to a pro
vision between which and the one under
consideration I maintain the most acute
metaphysics cannot draw a material dif
ference. Doesn't it follow necessarily that
when the same point arises in regard to a
railroad commission it will receive ex
actly the same decision? The Supreme
Court of California was justified in saying
and was compelled to say that these
bodies were judicial bodies. Then I take
it as a clear question that the Railroad
Commission must decide the question be
fore them on its merits.
"Is it true or is it not that in fixing the
rates to be followed by any railroad com
pany they must consider the validity of
these leases and their title to the property
which they held? Can you believe that
the constitution intended that when a rail
way commission wished to determine a
rate it must go into these nice questions of
ultra vires, public policy and other mat
ters I have been arguing? They had to do
with some one who was actually running
a road. They are simply to determine
what is a fair and reasonable rate between
the parties running the road and the pub
lic with which they are dealing. It was
not the intention to give to this commis
sion the right to decide this question of
title. They couldn't decide it. They have i
no machinery with which to pass upon
such question. If the railroad commission i
can't decide anything in regard to the va- j
lidity of this lease how can this court on j
an appeal by that body go further and de- ;
cide this question?
The Commissioners have to exercise an;
honest and reasonable judgment, and they |
must fix a reasonable rate. How are they
to fix a reasonable rate? They can't go j
into the question of title. What is the
test? Isn't it the effect of that rate on the
whole extent and earnings of the whole
road? They must make it reasonable with
respect to that piece of property which
tney are operatine. It may be that the
Legislature of the State of California can
make pome legislation by which some kind
of action in rem could be maintained
against a certain road. But we are here to
consider what has been done, not wp.at
niicht have been done. The power of (he
State has been put into effect only to the
extent that somebody who is running the
road is to be regulated, not somebody who
ought to be running it.
"It was not the intention to give to this
commission not only the enormous power
of regulating the rates of all railroad
companies operating within their limits,
and also the multifarious duties of regulat
ing these corporations in every regard.
The other departments of the State are
ample for this. These through proper
judicial channels by the wisdom of ages
have been always found sufficient.
"I say the commission had nothing to
do with the lesser companies. They found
the Southern Pacific Company in charge
of a certain line and they called them be
fore them and regulated their rates.
They did not attempt to regulate any
other company. How could they regnlate
the charges of a company which has no
road and isn't making any charges? The
thing is absurd.
"The intention in forming this commis
sion was not to furnish a substitute for
mandamus and other well-known proceed
ings. It was not calculated that they
should listen to lawyers talk learnedly of
ultra vires and public policy. They were
to be plain business men and citizens
called together to decide on a business
proposition.
"The commission, as previous commis
sions have done, acts upon the Southern
Pacific Company and upon no other.
How is this company going to comply
with the mandate of this Board of Com
missioners? The rate as now fixed is un
constitutional if it deals with the roads as
a system. When they regulate the system
as a system how can you say that you are
going to support it on a principle recogniz
ing the system not as a system but as in
dividual constituent roads?
"The Southern Pacific says this action
is confiscatory. The State's position is
like that of a trespasser who destroys
property without any warrant of law. You
propose to impose upon us penalties that
will destroy the company and plunge it
into bankruptcy. Do we become outlaws
because ten years after the event some
one discovers a new point that the State
has never insisted upon to take away our
property? The rules of equity don't go
that far. They protect the apparent pos
sessor. They do not regard the apparent
claims of third parties. A court of
equity as much as a court of law will pro
tect the rights of parties.
"The Commissioners cannot go beyond
the letter and the warrant of their author
ity. All that hns been given thÂ»Â»m is the
power to control the company in posses
sion. They don't go intotne question as to
whether the company ought to have the
road, but whether, having the road, it is
charging extortionate prices. The consti
tution and the statutes say, in so many
words, that you may regulate the charges
of the company. Unless there is relief in a
court of equity the penalties must be paid
and the results must ensue. This company
certainly has a right to complain it the
regulation is unlawful. Why will you
deny them relief? On the ground that this
is an unlawful system? That they have
not a good title to their property? If this
system is invalid how can the commission
regulate it as a system? This regulation
presupposes and must stand or fall with
the validity of the system within the State
of_ California, for it cannot be complied
with by any company acting independ
ently."
Judge Garber will continue speaking this
morning and will probably be able to fin
ish his argument to-day.
