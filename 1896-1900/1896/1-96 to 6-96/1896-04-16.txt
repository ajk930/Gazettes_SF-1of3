SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 15.â
"Where does the dust come from?" in
quired a Frenchman who to-day witnessed
â¢what is an unusual feature of the carnival
season.
"From the Mojave desert," a humorous
native replied.
"Why do they not go out and water the
desert?" was the second question pro
pounded by the foreigner.
The day has been dusty and the wind
has blown incessantly. That has made
little difference, as the programme has
been of indoor entertainment, but it is the
prayer of the natives that the accustomed
calm and pleasant weather be restored to
morrow. The parade and the battle of
flowers would not be improved by the
healthful breezes. Weather experts pre
dict that the wind will not blow.
Santa Barbara is to-night a bewildering
city, with 10,000 more inhabitants than it
had a weak ago. The streets are almost
laden in decorations. Every material that
grows in California in flower-beds, in
fields, in forest or on the distant hills has
been brought into service for the adorn
ment of the city.
Six large loads of hay. being hauled for
decorative purposes, were counted on State
s'r et yesterday afternoon. That gives
an idea of the extent of the decorations,
with a suggestion of the Santa Barbara
citizens' versatility. Hotels are over
crowded, the homes of the people are
filled with guests, but accommodations
will be provided for those who come. The
success of the carnival is assured, the man-
apers say. .. , ..;.. . .. s -p-\
The floral parade will begin at 2 o'clock
to-morrow, to be followed by the battle of
roses. The concluding event of Friday
evening will be the carnival ball.
The Spanish musicians played valiantly
in the further end of the pavilion this af
ternoon, the roof of the large tent-like
structure was kept in furious motion by
the wind that has blown all day, and the
flags and bunting streamers were in con
stant laborious flutter.
Among the roses and the rarer flowers
which were arranged on tables all over the
crash-covered floor, six hundred or more
ladies sat in the movable chairs and con
versed with the escorts for whom no seats
had been provided. In a general way the
scene was that of a fashionable and flower
bedecked audience waiting for a society
circus to begin, but it was in reality ten
circuses that the people were waiting to
see, for there were just ten babies in the
baby parade.
The Spanish band began an old Cas
tiilian lullaby and; that audience arose as
suddenly as if the playful Southern breeze
had succeeded in its attempt to take the
roof away. Every woman said something
endearing and every man exclaimed,
"Twins."
G. E. Sawyer is the postmaster at Santa
Barbara, but as a greater distinction still
he is the father of those twins. The white
carriage that contained the babies had
been built for two. It was richly decor
ated with roses and white ribbons, and in
their floral vehicle the babies, face to face,
were sound asleep. The chubby tots are
Wilbur and Rebecca. A pretty thought
was in having the carriage wheeled by
twins of a decidedly larger growthâ two
pretty little girls from Montecito.
The twins were at .the head of the little
procession that went around the audience
a dozen times or more. All the babies
were near the age of 2 years, and if it had
been the duty of the judges to decide
which was the most beautiful the task
would have been far more difficult than
that of deciding which carriage was the
most prettily bedecked. It was the car
riages that were placed in competition for
the silver cup and the babies, like the
roses, were ornaments.
Edessa,. the daughter , of Mr. and Mrs.
W. H. Arne, nestled in her rolling bed of
white roses and cooed at everybody. Mr.
and Mrs. Hey Is' baby, Maud, was stately
and quiet. The carriage seemed to be
made of roses. Pink and white roses
formed the bower in which was Helen.
The baby son of Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Ja
quithâGeorge Russell Mitchellâ a
manly looking infant, and the pink roses
were like the color of his cheeks. Mr. and
Mrs. Bean were patriotic enough to send
two babies to the show. They had no
child of 2 years, so they sent one of 3
years and another of 1 year, which made
the average all right. Daniel Bean was
the younger and Raymond the elder.
Emma Bean and Mary Bean, two pretty
little girls, propelled the carriages, which
were decorated with lilac, cloth and wild
flowers that corresponded in color.
The carriages were in tandem, connect
by lilac ribbons. Francis, the pride of
Mr. \ and Mrs. Frank j Maguire. was in a
glorious and nice carriage of nasturtiums.
He sat erect, and the dark brown eyes be
neath his almost golden hair, seemed full
of interest in the proceedings. Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Streeter's baby (Violet) was
among roses of white and pink, and was
too happy to care for the opinion of the
judges. The pretty girls in white who
propelled the carriages, in addition to
those mentioned, were Fern Andrews,
Ethelin Heyl, Helen Nichols, Grace Staf
ford and Mamie Doty.
As the little procession moved in its con-
The San Francisco Call.
tinuous circle the Spanish orchestra re
tired from the stage, and the red-coated
bandmen from the flagship Philadelphia
worked their way through the audience.
"Play something for the babies" suggest
ed an elderly man with a blue badge, and
the leader of the band answered with an
assenting bow.
The stern men of the navy may not be
expected to know all about babies; they
do not dream of sea fights to the music of
the lullaby, but yet they do not shrink
from army duty and the bandmaster's at
tempt on this occasion was as graceful as
he knew how to make it. He played the
famous"'Eleventh Infantry March" and
to the music of the naval band the babies
in the roses moved along, and then a final
circuit was made and on the carriage of
the nasturtiums was placed a trophy, on
which was worked "The Winner."
Baby Maguire was happy, but his
mother was happier and it's a wonder that
the carriage, baby and all were not crushed
in the rush of congratulations. When six
months old this infant won the prize at
the Santa Barbara County baby show.
Nobody would tell who the judges were.
It was not easy to decide which the pret
tiest carriage was. Those covered with
roses were as exquisite as can be imagined,
but, of course, the nasturtiums were gor
geous and made Baby Maguire's buggy
especially prominent. No second cup had
been offered, and that was well for the
judges; but the ladies all said that the
Postmaster's twins deserved a prize. The
baby parade was so entertaining that it
was repeated at the opening of the even
ing concert.
Visitors to the pavilion to-day did not
know whether to marvel most at the won
drous perfection or remarkable variety of
flowers on exhibition. Growths from the
tropics elbowed the homeliest and dearest
of native plants. Wild flowers from the
hills and canyons mingled their fragrance
with the breath of tender exotics; rare
ferns from the islands of the Pacific nodded
in a friendiy way to roses and carnations
bred in European nurseries, and curious
growths from the barren land of Terra del
Fnego stood side by side with the prodigal
yield of our own California gardens.
The Southern California Acclimatizing
Associationâ that interesting organization
of which Dr. Franchesci is the most active
representative, and which is Bound soon
to lead to the establishment of botanical
gardens hereâ was represented in a unique
and most fncinating exhibit. For several
years this association has been busily en
gaged in importing from all parts of the
globe valuable and beautiful growths
which it was believed would adapt them
selves to the climate of Southern Califor
nia and thrive vigorously out of doors.
This work has been of necessity experi
mental; but these experiments have
yielded many notable successes", and as a
result Santa Barbara has added to her
wealth some hundreds of shrubs and
plants which have never before been
grown in the United States. A careful
selection of the interesting and attractive
specimen plants was introduced in yester
day's exhibit.'
Along with these the director presented
a number of native plants and shrubs
which deserve a wider appreciation and
culture. Buddleia Madagascarensis, a
climber from Madagascar, has glossy,
pinnated green leaves, with very long
bunches of bright yellow flowers. It is
especially desirable on account of its being
a winter bloomer, flowering all the season.
Another winter bloomer comes from India,
and is called the Hexacentis Mysorensis.
It is also a climber and bears brilliant
scarlet and yellow flowers. A Bignonia
recently brought from England and wholly
new to this country is a climber with
rich, dull purple leaves, exquisitely veined.
The bamboo has taken so kindly to this
soil and climate and lends itself so mar
velously to decoration that many looked
with exceeding interest upon a new species
never before grown in this countryâ
Bainbusa Pubcscens, with velvety stems
and foliage. A tiny plant with the pre
tentious title of Adiantum Cristitum
Veneris is a recent impoitation from Great
Britain, and is a new species of maiden
hair fern, greatly strengthened and de
veloped.
The most bewitching plant in this ex
hibit, however, was a little native of the
Arizona mountains, known by the sug
gestive name Henchera Sanguinea. It
would almost seem as if we of the Pacific
Coast must go abroad to learn the value of
our own possessions, for it was not until
this plant had made a great sensation
throughout Europe some four or five
years ago and was industriously sought
and cultivated by European florists that it
was heard of in this country, It is a
dainty growth, sending up slender, arrowy
shaft from a cluster of broad- veined leaves
like the saxifrage, and this shaft is
crowned with delicate drooping trumpets
of a vivid coral tint, opening in a 'five
pointed star. Baron i Megastigma, an
Australian plant with exceedingly fra
grant flowersâ yellowish brown flowers re
sembling the Fritallarias â was unfortu
nately out of bloom, and only its pretty
leafage could he seen.
A small specimen of the Lyonothamus
Floribundis, that remarkable tree found
only on Santa Cruz Island, and which is
so alien to all of the known growths of the
world that a new order had to be especially
created for it, \ attracted much attention.
A larger specimen now growing in the
grounds of the association is expected to
bloom this season. This tree attains a
growth of from fifty to sixty feet, has ex
quisite, fernlike foliage and bears great
clusters.
A California chestnutâ that curious cac
tus vulgarly known as the devil's pincush
ion, which snared the clothing of more
thtn one venturesome spectatorâ and a
rare species of cactus, the Eehinocactus
Lecontei Fiavisbimus, with yellow spines,
first found in the Mohave desert last year,
together with the quaint pitcher-plant,
native to this State, attracted much atten
tion.
Nothing in the entire pavilion, however,
saving and except the baby show of the
afternoon, could vie in fascination with
that strange growth known as the old
man cactus, or Pilocereus Zenilis. This
extraordinary freak of vegetation was com
pletely draped in long, hoary fibers, and
its knoblike structure causes it to bear the
most absurd likeness to an old man's head
seen from the rear. When the fibrous
growth becomes dingy it has to be washed,
like the genuine article.
The cactus exhibit of Dr. Lorenzo G.
Yates included many rare and unusual
plants.
Two of theseâ the Cereus speciossimma
and Philocactus feastiiâ were brilliant with
bloom, the foimer bearing a magnificent
vermilion pendant, bell-like blossom, its
white stamens hanging in an immense
tassel from the center; the latter bearing

a great rose-colored flower, with a golden
center. The Rhipsalis paradoxi, branching
in a queer, twisting, triangular serpent
like form, was also in bloom, a rare and
interesting sight, for the little snow-white
flowers were precisely like strawberry blos
soms. The Aloe varicosa, its fleshy dark
green foliage studded with minute
white dots, sent a tall spike of blood-red
blossoms, each oddly tipped with green.
The . Antherium scherfczeranum, or fla
mingo plant, streamed its brillant scarlet
petals like a tropical bird in its green set
ting. yy.y-.s--. ..;,...._â¢,.,<'!
There were a number of rare ferns grow- i
ing vigorously with delicate foliage and
curious markings, and among these was
one about which Dr. Yates tells a good
story on himself. Fifteen years ago he
imported this fern from New Zealand at
considerable expense, but after he had
carefully cherished it for some time he
was aghast at learning that this very
species, the Osmunda Struthiopteris,
Japonica, which he had sent across the
ocean to secure, was also a native of North
America.
Ranking everything in diversity and
unique character was a collection of plants
entered by Mr. Gillespie of Montecito. A
rare palm from Brazil is vulgarly known
as the monkey's dinner bell, owing to the
fact that the fruit splits open with a loud
report, whereupon the monkeys, which
are themselves unable to open the fruit,
always rush for the nuts to secure a feast.
A royal palm of Cuba included in this
exhibit, some nine feet in height, with
leaves like the date palm, is flourishing so
luxuriantly that the possessor seems to
have demonstrated its successful growth
in the open air ot our climate, although it
has heretofore been regarded as a hot
house plant. The most beautiful feature
of this exhibition and one of the most be
wildering sights in the pavilion, always
excepting the babies, was a clarodendro, a
climber from Brazil, covered with bloom,
its curious snow-white calyx closing uoon
the flower in the bud like a tiny, triangu
lar balloon, which bursts open to form a
floating background for a velvety, crimson,
star-like flower. Mr. Gillespie also ex
hibited a small cocoanut tree; a rare sago
palm, the Encipilatos lehmanni, from
South Africa; a specimen of the divon
eduli from Mexico, with sharp cut comb
like leaflets, and numerous interesting
foreign growths, chiefly grown for orna
mental purposes. ,
To the Misses Jennings and Master John
Edwards the public is indebted for the
charming collections of wild flowers which
appeared as fresh as if just brought from
their homes in canyon and on hillsides.
Here were the Brodiaeas, Minor and Capi
tata, the former a lily like growth of deep
blue, veined with purple and nodding on a
slender stem. . -
Dainty golden violets lifted pansy faces,
and delicate Mariposa lilies curved their
pink-tinted petals to disclose their butter
fly markings. 7 Many, who looked through
this collection for the first time made the
acquaintance of the Piatystemon Califor
nica, a true California poppy, although it
resembles nothing so much as a wildwood
anemone of New England forest, albeit
lacking the pink flush of the latter and
having its fragile stem furred.
This da inty flower fairly carpets the mesas
of the channel islands in springtime.
Wild mustard and the bright yellow of
wild rape; the gay little yellow daisy,
with its white-tipped petals, known as
tidy-tips; the blood-red blossomed, slen
der-throated and star-mouthed pink, the
Silene Californica; dwarf Gillias, the royal
white blossoms of the Clematis Lasiantha,
the brilliant colors of the painter s brush,
sweet wild roses, gorgeous spikes of lark
spur, the magenta blossoms of the hum
mingbird flower, brilliant little sunflowers,
the fuschia-like red sprays of the wild
gooseberry, the homely, old-fashioned red
clover and the pure gold of the poppy
combined to teach that our native wild
flowers, if -: properly cultivated and nur
tured, would rival any flowers in the land.
Among the cut flowers, Mrs. Dr. Halt's

table led in beauty and variety. Roses,
carnations, and other popular blossoms,
were here seen in their utmost perfection ;
but interest centered upon a few rare and
curious flowers. A Solanum from India
was notable for its great leaves, shaped
precisely like those or the white oak, but
bronzed underneath, its starry white
flowers, with peaked <olden pistil, 1 clus
tered about the heart of the plant. â .; f
A. traveler and a botanist remarked that
he saw here for the first time in this coun
try the flowers of the Robinia Pseudo
Acacia, or pink locust, which originated in
Paris a year or two ago, as well as the
Robinia Hispida, with blossoms of a deep
rose and furry stems, which give it its dis
tinctive name. A choice shrub from Mex
ico, the Choisya Ternata, has blossoms
which, in aspect and perfume, bear
a remarkable resemblance to ' the
orange, and the plant is now being
extensively grown in Paris as a substitute
for the latter on account of its easy culti
vation. A small but vivid yellow flower
proved to be a Barberry, a native of Terra
del Fuego, which has borne transplanting
from that frigid land to Southern Califor
nia with wonderful equanimity, flourish
ing here as well as in its native soil.
Miss Blake's table had few rare plants,
but displayed a wealth of common culti
vated flowers grown to perfection. Her
pelargoniums and carnations and roses
were of marked beauty. Double esch
scholtzias, sprays of the cedar of Lebanan
and a great flowering spike of the classical
acanthus were the unique features.
Mrs. Neal of Montecito exhibited a large
variety of garden flowers of great perfec
tion and beautyâ carnations, roses, helio
trope, double petunias, pelargoniums,
gaillardias, calliopsys and an exquisite
wild flower from Santa Cruz Island,
Erigerium maritium, marigold, scented,
with a whirl of golden stamens and fine
aster petals of lilac tint.
Mrs, Neal is known as one of the most
successful growers in this vicinity, and a
couple of specimens ;of John Sievers*
famous rainbow rose, exhibited by her
to-day. far surpassed any that have ever
been seen at San Francisco floral shows. *
Joseph J. Perkins, a prominent citizen
of Santa Barbara, offered a charming ex
hibit from his own garden, including some
fine navel oranges, which took the first
prize. The Misses Tierney and Mrs.
Charles Woodbridge had collections of
roses of exquisite form and j coloring, and
Mrs. Sexton presented an interesting dis
play of wild flowers from Ventura County.
John Spence had a large display of su
perb flowers and plants occupying . the
center stand. Professor T. N. Snow dis
played many fine roses, not named, and a
remarkably pretty collection of cinerarias.
A small exhibit of fruit added variety to
the programme. "..'.
Although this is the poorest season of
the year for fruit a considerable variety
was shown. : y .y. .''.'".
The Messrs. Shepard Bros, of Mountain
View ranch, Casitas Pass, made a veritable
sensation with specimen strawberries of
the scarlet chiefâ enormous, bright red
berries. J. E. Shepard exhibited Eureka
lemons in all stages,- from the tree to the
final curing. A single specimen measured
13 inches by 14'_ inches in circumference.
F. J. Barker had golden dates and some
tremendous citrons of commerce. Joseph
Sexton exhibited -Araona Cherimoias or
custard apples. William Ferl showed some
fine limes and bananas from his pictur
esque plantation in Montecito. I. B. Pierce
exhibited sweet-rind lemons and the
Misses Tierney showed fine specimens of
this fruit, as wall as some superb speci
mens of grape fruit.

CENTRAL CITY, Colo., April 15.â
city was the scene of intense excitement
this morning, caused by the death of one
man and the serious wounding of two
others, one of whom will probably die. At
10 o'clock Sam Covington and Noah Driver
went to the law office of J. M. Searight.
Searight had been trying to collect a bill
from Covington. When Covington en
tered the lawyer's office he' drew two re
volvers from his pockets and leveled them
at the attorney, demanding that he make
out a receipt for the bill without receiving
any money. The attorney demurred and
two shots were fired, neither of them
taking effect, both passing through the
floor.
The authorities were notified and the
the City Marshal, M. F. Keleher, hurried
to the 3cene as rapidly as possible. Upon
entering the room he was immediately
shot by Covington, who started away and
ran downstair., meeting at the street
entrance ex-Mayor Dick Williams, who
endeavored to stop him. The revolvers
were brought into play again and Wil
liams fell wounded. Then the desperate
man started for the hills.
As rapidly as possible a posse was or
ganized to i 'low him. About halfway
between this city and Nevadaville he was
overtaken by Henry Lehman, who shot
and killed him instantly upon his refusal
to surrender.
The ball has been removed from Mayor
Williams' body and there is a fair chance
that he will recover. Marshal Keleher'g
wounds are considered fatal and a tele
gram was sent to Denver for Dr. John G.
Boyce, who will come here on a special
train to attend the wounded men. Cov
ington'has been a resident of this place
only for about a year and had always been
considered a quiet, well behaved citizen, '
not at all given to drinking. His body lies '
at the Coroner's office.
HAND-TO-HAND BATTLES.
Sanguinary Encounters in Which
Very Few Are Killed or
Wounded.
Guerrillas Captured by Insurgents.
Spanish Officers Are Promoted
for Valor.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 15.â Colonel
Pintos reports that his command had a
fight with a party of insurgents under
Maceo near Pozo Recondo in Havana
province. The engagement terminated in â 
a band-to-hand encounter in which the 4
rebels fought desperately with machetes, j
The result, according to Colonel Pintos* '
reports, was that the rebels lost ten killed, ',
while the Government force had only one
man wounded.
A party of guerrillas, while foraging near |
Matanzas, encountered a superior force of i
the enemy, and a battle followed in which
six of the guerrillas were killed and one)
was wounded. The column commanded]
by Lieutenant-Colonel Navarro came toj
the assistance of the guerrillas, and the]
combined Government forces routed tho]
rebels.
A band of fourteen guerrillas, while on a-j
foraging expedition in the vicinity of Las]
Vegas, Province of Havana, was surprised]
by a party of rebels 1000 strong under the]
leader Castillos.
They made a brave defense, but only;
three of their number escaped, ten being!
killed and one wounded. \
It is said that Lieutenant-Colonel Debos*
and Captain Crebe have been promoted fori
their valor in the recent battle near]
Lechuza.
It is reported that some of Maceo's
forces made an attack upon the trocha
near the south of the line yesterday, but
were compelled to retire by tho gunboat j
Almendares and the launch Dardo, aided:
by land forces.
A IXIBASIKOUS DEFEAT.
Spaniards Admit That They Suffered a
JCepulae at Lechuza.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 15 (via Key
West, Fla., April 15.)â The Spanish ad
mit that the Lechuza affair was one of the
most disastrous battles of ths war.
The actual loss is still unknown. Maceo
had been encamped upon the hills around
Lechuza, fifteen miles west of the trocha,
for eight days. Weyler had 30,000 men
along the trocha awaiting a rebel attempt
to cross, with 10,000 others in reconnoiter
ing columns under General Incian.
Colonel Debos was ordered to operate. a
combination attack upon Maceo. Debos
attacked, relying upon others to support
him.
Incian arrived after Debo3 had been
driven thirteen miles, surrounded by
Maceo's men and under a constant fire of
seven hours.
Debos made a last stand at the stone
sugar-house, on the shore of Cabanas Bay.
General Incian, aided by a gunboat, saved
the remnant from annihilation. Colonel
Sanchez Echavarria was ordered court
martialed, owing to his failure to arrive ia
time.2
CONVENTIONS
AND PLATFORMS
Nebraska Politicians Are
for McKinley All the
Time.
THE POLITICAL MOSES
A Free Silver Plank in the
Platform Is Carried With
a Shout.
PLUCKY COLORADO DEMOCRATS
Will Vacate Their Seats at Chicago
Should the Silver Question Be
Ignored.
OMAHA, Nebr., April 15.â The action
of the Nebraska Republican Delegate Con
vention held here this evening must be
taken as meaning the repudiation of the
McKinley-Manderson compromise and the
acknowledgment by the Republican party
that Senator John M. Thurston is its most
popular son. General Manderson s name
will not be mentioned at St. Louis and
Nebraska will send a solid delegation to
the National Convention pledged for Mc-
Kinley first, last and all the time.
The action of the convention on the
financial question was foretold in The
United Press dispatches sent out yester
day. The matter created a great deal of
dissension, and much personal feeling was
shown before the Question of inserting a
silver plank or not was decided.
The convention was called to order at 8
o'clock by John T. Mallalieu, acting chair
man. W. P. McCreary of Hastings was
introduced as temporary chairman, and
during the course of his address said :
"There has never been a time since 1865
when the people were so serious and so
much in earnest over campaign issues as
to-day. The question was the American
home and family on one side the European
homes and families on tbe other. The
people are now. as in 1865, seeking a Moses
to lead them out of the difficulty which
surrounded them, but that no machine
politicians were looked to to acomplish
this. The people of the State have de- j
clared by their votes that they want the |
great protectionist of Ohio to lead them in !
the presidential fight. [Applause] What j
the people want is the demonetization of !
Democracy and the free and unlimited j
coinage of Republicanism."
J. M. Gillam of Omaha was made ter- j
porary secretary. Senator Thurston moved j
that a committee of seven be appointed |
on resolutions, and that all resolutions be i
referred to this committee without discus- '
sion, which motion caused a fight between
the radical free-silver men and the conser
vative wing. Ex-Governor Crounse be
lieved that this move was a scheme to I
eliminate all discussion of a free-silver \
plauk. The motion, however, was carried j
with a shout.
The following platform was adopted:
The Republicans of Nebraska, In convention '
assembled, congratulate the country upon tne |
certain return of the Republican party to |
power and rejoice that our land Is to be speed- !
ily redeemed from the disasters and sufferings j
of Democratic incompetency, error and mis
rule.
This Is the year of the people, and the people j
demand that their great champion, William j
McKinley, shall be nominated and elected
President of the United States.
We reaffirm our loyalty to the declared prin- I
ciples of the Republican party and to those of '
the great American policies for which our
party always stands.
We pledge ourselves in advance to the plat
form ot the forthcoming National Republican
Convention, believing that it will declare
against the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver and tor the currency of gold, silver and
paper, "as sound as the Government and as
untarnished as its honor," and for that Ameri
can system of protection and reciprocity of
which William McKinley is the best living ex
ponent, ana under which our people attained
the greatest National and individual pros
perity.
We assert that the Republican narty stands
for the supremacy of the constitution of the
United States, the maintenance of law and
order, the protection of every American citizen
in his right to live, to labor and vote; a vigor
nous foreig nolicy.the enforcement of the Mon
roe doctrine, the restoration of our merchant
marine, American markets for American
products, the Governmental supervision
and control of transportation lines and
rates; the protection of the people
from all unlawful combination and unjust ex
action of aggregated capital and corporate
power; a pension policy just and generous to
our living heroes and the widows and orphans
of their dead comrades; coast defense against
foreign navies, pauper immigration and the
products of cheap foreign labor; a rigid ob
servation of our naturalization laws.
We extend our sympathies to the struggling
patriots of Cuba in their heroic efforts to es
tablish a Government of the people, and we
demand the recognition of their rights as bel
ligerents by the National administration
We remit all presentation of State issues to
the convention called for the nomination of
State officers, pledging ourselves to support its
nominees and assuring the country that Ne
braska is a Republican State.
The chair appointed a committee on
resolutions, with John M. Thurston as
chairman.
Enemies of the Senator and .Manderson's
followers introduced a resolution reflecting
upon the manner in which Thurston had
attempted to dictate to the Republican
party in Nebraska. Responses made to
his alleged ambition to become Vice-Presi
dent or obtain a seat in the Cabinet were
loudly applauded, while sentiments derog
atory to his character were hissed, and ul
timately the resolution was .tabled amidst
great confusion.
A motion by Thurston, that three of the
four delegates at large be chosen by accla
mation, carried, and the names of Peter
Jansen of Fairbury, T. B. Kennard of Lin
coln and Johu L. Webster of Omaha were
selected.
COLORAIiO DEMOCRATS.
They Have But One Resolutionâ trie
Coinage of Silver.
DENVER, Colo., April 15.â The dele
gation selected by the Democratic State
convention held in this city to-day to
represent the party in the National con
vention in Chicago carry with them but
one resolution, that being a demand for
the restoration of the coinage of silver.
The chairman of the delegation, Hon. C.
S.Thomas, after being nominated by ac
clamation, declared in an impassioned
speech that unless this issue be accepted
he would immediately resign his seat in j
the convention. This sentiment met !
with such a heaity applause that it is sup- j
posed Aat the other members of the dele
gation will feel oound to do likewise.
The routine work of the convention was
without incident and there was no trouble
in securing a unanimous report from the
committee on resolutions.
After C. S. Tnomas had been elected
chairman of the delegation, and had made
his position clear to the convention, trou
ble arose over the selection of three other
delegates at large. The Arapahoe delega
tion, which had been instructed by the
county convention yesterday to vote as a
unit upon all questions, refused to abide
by this rule, and the convention could not
decide the matter to its own satisfaction.
In the midst of the discussion a recess was
taken to 7:45 o'clock. The. resolutions
were as follows:
The Democracy of Colorado in convention
assembled declare:
Firstâ unwavering devotion to all the
principles of the Democratic faith, as laid
down by Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jack
son.
Secondâ That the evils that now oppress the
people are a direct result, of a â¢ departure from
the true principles of Democracy; that thp
policy inaugurated by the Republican party
for the contraction of the currency and for
many years continued by it to the gradual and
certain impoverishment of the people in the
face of steadfast opposition from the Demo
cratic party, but adopted and approved by the
present administration, has resulted in the
creation of an enormous bonded debt in a
period of profound peace, visiting a deadly
blight on every industry, and carrying dis
couragement and dismay into the household
of every wealth producer in the land; that
there never can be a condition of general wel
fare until the volume of a sound and stable
currency is equal to the demand of industrial
and commercial pursuits; that the first step
in this direction should be the immediate
restoration of silver to the place it occupied
in tha currency of the world for centuries
previous to 1873. r>
We therefore favor the Immediate restora
tion of the free and unlimited coinage of gold
and silver at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1,
as such coinage existed prior to 1573, without
waiting for the aid or consent of another
such gold and silver to be a full legal tender
for all debts, public and private.
Hon. C. S. Thomas has been a member
of the National Committee for many years,
In his speech to-day he stated as to his
personal conviction that, no man can be a
Democrat and be opposed to the free coin
age of silver, and until that question is
settled there is no room for the considera
tion of any other question. "I will go to
Chicago," said he, "to do all in my power
to see~that this principle is crystallized in
the National platform for the coming cam
paign. If that convention shall say that
the policy of J. Pierpont Morgan and John
Lherman is the true Democratic policy,
then my duty compels me to say that" I
shall withdraw from it. They might as
well declare by resolution that the McKin
ley tariff is a Democratic principle. And
though I withdraw, I shall still believe I
am a Democrat of the Thomas Jefferson
kind.
The delegates at large are T. I. O'Don
nell, Denver; Adai I. Wilson, Durango; B.
0. Sweeney. Trinidad. Congressional dele
gates: K. W. Snear, Denver; E. J. Mc-
Carty, Leadville; H. H. Seldenridge, Col
orado Springs, and E. J. Hallett, Aspen.

nd for President,
Never before was a convention better or
ganized previous to being called to order,
never before was a convention more of one
mind and never before did a convention
follow more absolutely the lines marked
out for it by the managers.
Governor William J. Stone proposed the
indorsement of Richard Park Bland for
the Democratic nomination for President
I for it by managers, him by ac
jvernor William J. Stone proposed the
>rsement of Richard Park Bland for
Democratic nomination for President
the convention indorsed him by ac
clamation. The deiegat-s did no t know
until the last moment this would be done,
as Mr. Bland has repeatedly said that he
' would not allow it. but when they saw
that it was in the cards they acquiesced
with a cheer.
There was no wild scene such as some
times marks such conventions, but never
theless, a strong sound of applause.
Everything went as every one knew it
would go. A handful of sound-money men
caused a little ripple in the silvery stream
by announcing their position, but that
was all. The resolutions were adopted as
they came from the committee on resolu
tions, and they are strong enough to satisfy
the most enthusiastic silver man who ever
shouted for 16 to 1.
Fifteen hundred persons were crowded
into Woods' Opera-house, with a seating
capacity of 800, when the Democratic State
Convention to elect delegates to the Na
tional Convention at Chicago was called to
order by Chairman Maffitt at 12:35 o'clock.
Hon. William M. Hatch was named as
temporary chairman ana made a speech
in. the interest of free silver. His ref
erences to the services of ex-Congressman
Bland were received with tumultuous
cheers. The first business of the conven
tion was the calling of delegates by Con
gressional districts. The call showed that
the only "sound money" delegates were
from St. Louis and the convention began
an animated discussion as to whether
their credentials should be recognized.
After the appointment of the usual com
mittees the convention took a recess till
2:30 p.m.
While the committee on resolutions was
being appointed one of the most sensa
tional scenes ever witnessed on a public
platform was enacted.
j Of the fifteen members of the committee
I Isaac H. Lionberger of St. Louis was found
to be a gold bug. On a motion that the
1 committee be ratified by investigation,
I Delegates Lionberger, Devoy and Frost
I pleaded for the former's recognition. Dele-
I gate Devoy read a long instrument in be
half of Lionberger. He warned the con
vention that they could not afford to
Devoy read a long instrument in be
of Lionberger. He warned the con
ion that they could not afford to
I trample on the minority. He warned
' them that they could not afford to lose
many more Democratic votes.
A storm of hisses followed this implied
threat. Catcalls echoed and re-echoed
all over the house. During this scene a
dozen men were on their feet. Colonel
Nicholas M. Bell was among them. He
demanded to be allowed to be beard.
Chairman Mafhtt, who was sitting on the
stage during Bell's efforts to be heard,
yelled, "Sit down !"
"Oh, you keep cool," Bell shouted back.
Maffitt shook his fist at the silver leader
and said, "You turncoat, you."
In an impassioned speech Colonel Bell
explained the manner in which the fftee
silver delegations were elected in St. Louis.
From his view of the case Delegate Lion
berger had no right on the committee.
Just after Mr. Bell finished sneaking he
stepped up among the press tables to get a
glass of water. Maffitt walked over to the
edge of the platform and, lean over,
said something to him. Bell bad the glass
in his hand, full of water. He let it fly in
Maffitt 's face. The latter said nothing,
but wiped his face with bis handkerchief
and moved back. Some of the water hit
Chairman Hatch and Secretary Pollard
and wet the records. After this scene Bell
left the hall.
The convention reassembled at 4:15 p. m.
A number of resolutions of instruction to
the platform committee were offered, but
the chair ruled that they could not be of
fered regularly until a permanent organ
ization was effected.
Short addresses were made by "silver
tongued" orators, when Governor Stone
came forward with a set of typewritten
resolutions indorsing Richard P. Bland
for President. The Governor was received
with tumultuous roars. He said the
resolutions set forth Mr. Bland's ser
vices to the cause of free silver, the belief
that this will be the leading issue in the
National campaign, and the personal
qualities of Bland, which it is supposed fit
mm for the Presidency. Governor Stone
said that as a personal friend of Bland he
took pride in offering the resolutions. He
hoped and believed free-silver delegates
would organize the Chicago convention
and nominate Bland, "the foremost free
silver advocate in America, for President."
A rising vote was taken and every one
rose except Graham Frost of St. Louis and
one or two others. The applause which
greeted Bland's nomination was much

less than that accorded Governor Stone
himself. Showalterof .Lafayette offered a
resolution instructing the Missouri mem
ber of the National Committee to vote for
no man for temporary chairman of the
Chicago convention not known to be a
free-silver man. 7-7
This was aimed at ex-Governor D. R.
Francis, who is said to have been slated
for the place named. There were but five
votes against the resolution, all before
from St. Louis. -' .â¢:"â â¢ y
When the chairman announced that the
order was tbe selection of four delegates at
large to the National Convention Bland
came to the platform. He did not attempt
a speech, but simply said that the people
had instructed the delegation to vote for
four delegates to the National Convention,
of whom he was one. He said that the
convention in its partiality had seen fit to
honor him with an indorsement for the
nomination ' for President, and that in
yielding against his judgment' to the will
of the people of the State he would make
the fight for the nomination, and that it
would therefore be impossible for him to
serve as a National delegate.
Vest, Cockrel) and Stone were then
named as delegates at large by acclama
tion, and George W. Allen, ex-Mayor of St.
Louis, was chosen as the fourth delegate.
KESTVCKI ItEI-ÃBZICAXS.
The Bradley forces Capture the Organi
zation of the .State Convention. .77'
LOUISVILLE, Ky., April -.. 15.â The
Bradley and McKinley forces locked horns
here to-day for the control of the State
delegation at the St. Louis National Con
vention. When the convention met at
2:30 o'clock the Bradley forces at once
captured the temporary organization, and
when the various committees gave the
Governor a majority the McKinley men
gave up all hope of tending a delegation
to the St. Louis convention instructed for
the Ohio man.
In the evening session it was evident to
everybody that the convention would go
over to a second day. The committee on
resolutions remained in session till a late
hour and adjourned until to-morrow at 8
o'clock without agreeing upon a report.
Promptly at 2:35 this afternoon Chair
man John W. Yerkes called the Republi
can State Convention to order. In his ad
dress to the convention Mr. Yerkes said
that after thirty years of hard labor and a
display of heroic courage the Republicans
of Kentucky had obtained control of the
State government. They had overcome a
boasted Democratic majority of 40,000.
He referred to Governor Bradley as. the
man who had done most in Kentucky for
the party, and thought him entitled to all
the honors the victory afforded.
"There are many Republicans in Ken
tucky who prefer Mr. McKinley for the
Presidential nomination," said he, "and
while favoring him they are still true to
Governor Bradley."
When the name of McKinley was uttered
by Mr. Yerkes the applause for nearly five
minutes was deafening. There was also
considerable applause for Governor Brail
ley. Mr. Yerkes concluded by saying that
he was authorized by the State Central
Committee to name Judge T. Z. Morrow
of Pulaski County lor temporary chairman
of the meeting.
Hon. Oliver W. Root of Newport nom
inated Judge George J. Denny of Lexing*
ton as the McKinley representative. Then
the great fight for temporary organization
began. A call of counties was taken, dur
ing which the greatest commotion pre
vailed, amounting in fact to a perfect up
roar, and it was with great difficulty that
the secretary could proceed. When the
name of Jefferson County was reached
and the chairman of that delegation an
nounced 122 votes for Morrow and 73 for
Denny there was a scene which almost
rivaled pandemonium.
Instantly voices from all parts of the
ball challenged the call and demanded
changes in the vote. The rollcall then pro
ceeded with numerous outbreaks whenever
a contesting county was reached, and it
was not for hours that the call was com
pleted and the secretary announced the
result â Morrow 833, Denny 742.
Judge Morrow then took the chair and
the business of organization was continued.
The usual committees were named and at
6 o'clock the convention adjourned until 8
p. M.
When the convention met at 8 o'clock
the committee on permanent organization
reported and recommended Charies Bland
ford of Breckinridge County for chairman
and Fred Roberts and D. Elliot Kelly sec
retaries. Lyons of Newport nominated
George Denny Jr. for chairman, but con
sideration ofthe report was postponed un
til after the report of the credentials com
mittee, which announced it would not be
ready for an hour and a half.
During the interval Judge Denny de
livered an impassioned speech, which
called forth repeated applause from the
AlcKinley supporters. Wood Dunlap
again explained his position and was in
terrupted by Lyons of Newport, who
called in question some of his statements.
At 11 o'clock the committee on creden
tials reported seating the contesting dele
gations of Jefferson, Logan and Warren
counties, a compromise being effected
between the McKinley and Bradley mem
bers, each taking half of the delegations.
The report of the committee on per
manent organization was then adopted,
attempts to nominate Judge Denny and
Oliver Boot for chairman being ineffectual,
and Charles Blandford took the chair.
The committee on rules reported at 11:1 a
and the report was finally adopted and at
12:10 a. m. the convention adjourned until
9 a. m.
TILLMAN AT DEXVER.
The South Carolina Senator Addresses a
Multitude on Silver,
DENVER, Colo., April 15.â Never was
the Broadway Theater so jammed with
people as to-night when Senator Tillrn an
of South Carolina delivered bis political
address to the State Democratic conven
tion. The foyer were packed to suffoca
tion, the stage held 500 people, every aisle
was filled and several thousand disap
pointed citizens failed to get as near as tho
main entrance.
The boxes were occupied by prominent
citizens of all political opinions. In the
foyer on the main floor the crush was
simply awful, and it required a great dis
play of good nature to prevent a panic.
When Senator Tillman entered the stage
he was received by a mighty outburst of
cheers, while the band played "Dixie."
Secretary Newell read letters indorsing
the silver sentiment from the Governors
of Missouri and Virginia, Senators Vest,
Call and others until the impatient
audience howled down the secretary and
Senator Tillman was introduced. In his
introduction he referred to the presenta
tion of the silver and gold pitchfork last
night by a young lady as a hew and
proper emblem of the Goddess of Liberty,
as it is now the emblem of agriculture.
He reviewed historically the Democratic
party, handling the subject seriously and
earnestly, then warming up he attacked
the present administration in plain words
and without a delicate choice of language.
He soon had the vabt audience wild with
â excitement. The mention of John Sher
man brought forth a storm of hisses,
which stopped the speaker lor a moment.
His main effort was to convince his audi
ence that the capitalists control the Na
tional Government and both political
parties, and he sought to array the com
mon people against the great centers of
wealth. He touched at some length upon
the silver question. ' 'â â¢â¢â 'â ,

. FARGO, N. Dak., April 15.â The Re
puolicans of North Dakota, in State con
vention to-day, "turned down" Senator
Hansbrough, instructed the delegates to
vote for William McKinley. for the Presi
dential nomination and declared for
"sound money." -
The proceedings of the convention were
"cut and dried" at a caucus held early
this morning in ihe Hotel MeUopolo. The
personnel of the caucus was all anti-
Hansbrough, and it was voted unanimously
to stand by their action in the convention.
The sound-money men carried the conven
tion 350 to 140. Colonel Robinson of May
vilitj will succeed Senator Hansbrough as
Rational committeeman. The result of
the convention is regarded as a serious
blow to Hansbrough's hopes of succeeding
himself as United States Senator next
winter.
At 10:45 a. m. the convention was called
to order and E. C. Gearey, an anti-Hans
brough man, was elected temporary chair
man; the nomination being seconded by
Hansbrough. At 2 o'clock the conven
tion not being ready for action, an ad
journment was taken to give the commit
tees on credentials, permanent organiza
tion and resolutions an opportunity to act.
The committees were not ready to report,
and a further adjournment was taken to
evening.
7 Senator Hansbrough's men concede de
feat and Hansbrough will have neither a
place on the delegation to St. Louis nor be
National committeeman.

procity; in favor of the election of Sena
tors by direct vote of the people ; denounces
the Democrats for increasing the public
debt; expresses sympathy for Cuba, and
on the financial question says:
The Republicans of North Dakota are united
in their demand for honest money. We are
unalterably opposed to any scheme that will
give to this country a depreciated or debused
currency. We favor the use of silver as cur

FAVORS CHIEF CLARENCE.
The Honduras Government Is
Scheming for an Advantage
Over Nicaragua.
Questions Agitating People Who Take
an Interest in Central Ameri
, can Affairs.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 15.â A Times
correspondent in Kingston, Jamaica,
writing under date of April 7, says:
The Bonilla Government of Honduras,
in sheer hopelessness of effecting any sort
of permanent alliance with Nicaragua, is
initiating a scheme looking to the freeing
of the Mosquito territory from Nicaraguan
control and restoring Chief Clarence, who
was deposed about two years ago. under a
Honduras protectorate. The idea is to
deprive Nicaragua of the free access to the
Atlantic that the possession of the Mos
quito gives and thus confine her to the
San Juan outlet, which will be monopo
lized by the canal if that project is ever
carried out. The effect would be practi
cally to make Nicaragua as essentially a
Pacific state as Salvador, Ecuador, Peru
and Chile.
Chief Clarence, who is here, "knows
nothing of the project." Of course, this
may be so. While not inferring any doubt
of his honesty of purpose and faith in the
ultimate justice of the compensation that
Great Britain owes him. and will doubtless
pay, still it is to be remembered that even
if he did or does not know anything about
the designs of Honduras for her own im
mediate and his incidental benefit, he is
not likely to say so. Any hope of infor
mation must be given up.
Meanwhile, presuming that there is any
truth in the rumor, it is an interesting
matter for speculation whether the British
Government would allow Clarence to re
sume his chielship. That might bring her
into collision with Nicaragua. On the
other band, is Clarence virtually a pris
oner here and unable to take his chances
if Honduras invites him to do so? These
are questions that are being discussed
among the small section of people here
who take any interest ,at all in Central
American politics.
SHOT BT HIS WIFE.
lias Running a Female Sprinting Show
and Neglecting His Family.
BOSTON, Mass., April 15.â Mrs. Jose
phine A. Andrews of 4 Congress street,
Chelsea, is under arrest in this city,
charged with shooting her husband, James
H. Andrews, late last night in Dunn's
Nickel Odeon on Hanover street. An
drews had been managing a female sprint
ing match at the Nickel Odeon; is the
owner of a sprinting-macbine, and has
been very intimate with one Kittie Collins,
who was ostensibly his partner in the en
terprise.
Mrs. Andrews has kept a boarding-house
in Chelsea for tome time and has supplied
her husband with money, which she claims
he has spent upon the Collins woman.
Finally she became jealous, and purchas
ing a revolver started for Boston with the
purpose of shooting both her husband and
the Collins woman. As she entered th?
Nickel Odeon her husband saw her coming
and attempted to bar her progress, but she
quickly drew her weapon and fired, the
bullet takine effect in Andrews' back.
The wound is not considered necessarily
fatal. Mrs. Andrews was locked up. The
couple have been married thirty-one years
and have seven children.
DEMOLISHED WITH AXES.
Kansas Officers Destroy the Property of
a Resort- Keeper.
WICHITA, Kans., I April 15.â Chief of
Police Frank Burt and several police offi
cers to-night made an example of John
Wiggins, whose resort is known as the
"Coney Island Place," by entering his
place armed with axes and demolishing
his furniture and fixtures and destroying
his stock of liquors, because he could not
pay his fine and would not close up. Sev
eral jointists who had failed to pay their
fines were notified to-day to pay or close
up, and the threat was made that if they
continued to sell in defiance of the order
their stock and fixtures would be destroyed.
After the demolition of the "Coney Island"
the delinquent jointists made haste to pay
their fines. This unprecedented action of
Chief Burt has caused great excitement.

CARLISLE TALKS
AGAINST SILVER
Thousands of People Listen
to the Secretary of the
Treasury.
MOSTLY WORKINGMEN.
Says Free and Unlimited Coin
age Would Be a National
Calamity.
A POPULIST INTERRUPTION.
An Inquisitive Gentleman Hustled
Out of the Hall by Two
Policemen.
CHICAGO, 111., April 15.â Every one of
the 5000 seats in Chicago's great Audi
torium was filled to-night with people who
came to hear the address of Secretary Car
lisle on currency and finance. Several
hundred people stood through the entire
address and several hundred more went
away, being unable to gain admittance.
The Secretary received a hearty welcome
and was loudly cheered upon entering the
hall. Said he:
Labor cannot be hoarded. The idle day has
gone forever; lost wages are never reimbursed,
and therefore steady employment and good
pay in good money are essential to the com
fort and happiness of the American laborer
and his wife and children. He will be unfaith
ful to himself and to them if he does not insist
upon the adoption and maintenance of such a
policy as will most certainly preserve the value
and stability of all our currency and promote
the regular and profitable conduct of all our
industrial enterprises.
The naked proposition is that the United
States shall coin at the public expense for the
exclusive beneflt of the individuals and cor
porations owning the bullion all tne silver
that may be presented at the mints into dol
lars containing 371% grains of pure silver, or
412% grains of standard silverâ intrin
sically about 51 or 52 centsâ deliver the coins
to the depositors of the bullion, and compel all
the other people in the country to receive
these coins at a valuation of 100 cents each in
the payment of debts due them, except only in
cases where the prudent capitalist has taken
the precaution in advance to contract for pay
ment in gold or its equivalent.
To say nothing of the gross partiality and
manifest injustice of such a policy, its imme
diate effect would be to contract our currency
to the extent of about $620,000,000 by stop
ping the use of gold as money, and putting a
premium upon the coins of that metal
equal, or about equal, to the difference
between the intrinsic value of the gold
dollar and the intrinsic value of the
silver dollar. Gold coins would at once become
a commodity, and would be bought and sold
by speculators in the market just as they were
during the war when we had a depreciated
paper currency. The value of the silver dollar
would fluctuate from day to day, mov
ing up and down with the rise and
fall of the commercial price of the
bullion contained in it as the Mexican dollar
does now and tne premium on the golden dol
lar would of course fluctuate to the | same ex
tent, thus affording an opportunity to bullion
brokers and speculators to buy and sell it at
a profit It would cease to be used as money,
because no man would pay his debt in gold
dollars or in paper redeemable in gold dollars
worth 100 cents when the law permitted him
to pay it in silver dollars worth only 51 or 52
cents each.
The sudden withdrawal of $625,000,000
from the volume of the currency in the coun
try would undoubtedly produce a financial
and industrial disturbance far more disastrous
to the interests of labor than has ever been ax
perienced in our history, and no man who has
a particle of sympathy for workingmen and
women and their dependent families can con
template the possibility of such a calamity
without feeling that it is his duty, whether he
occupies a public or private station, to employ
every honorable means at his command to
avert it. .
The attempt to maintain what is called the
double standard of value, that is, the attempt
to keep the legal-tender coins of the two
metals, gold and silver, in use as money at the
same time, upon a ratio of value fixed by law,
has repeatedly been made by kings and parlia
ments in every civilized country in the world,
and it has failed in every one of them; and it
requires no gift of prophecy to foresee that it
must continue to fail so long as self-interest
constitutes a controlling factor in the business
affairs of men.
The secretary then concisely and briefly
recounted the experience of the United
States Government and Congress with the
silver experiment and the return to the
gold standard and limited coinage of
silver. Continuing, he said :
We have now about $620,000,000 in gold and
$413,000,000 in full legal-tender silver, besides
$78,216,677 in subsidiary silver coins, which
are legal tender in payments not exceeding
$10, aud the real question for the people to de
cide is whether they will continue to use the
coins of both metals or adopt a monetary sys
tem which always has and always will drive
one of them out of the country.
All the mints of the United States, operated
to their full capacity and doing no other work,
could not coin into standard silver dollars
two-thirds of the annual production of
silver in our own country, but notwith
standing this it is seriously proposed to
offer free coinage to all the silver, in
the world at a legal valuation almost double
Its commercial value in the markets of the
foreign countries where it Is produced. We
should descend by a single step from the high
est standard of value to silver monometallism
with a contracted and at the same time a de
preciated currencyâ a financial experiment
which has no precedent in the monetary his
tory of the world.
In the general confusion and disorder result
ing from such a radical change, what will be
the condition of the American laborer? Will
he be benefited or injured by the reducing by
one-half the value of the money in which his
wages are paid, and at the same time increas
ing the prices of the commodities for which
his wages are expended?
The great body of employers, a vast majority
of the men who have embarked their capital
in industrial enterprises and are relying for
success upon their skill and energy in the
prosecution of their business, do not want the
present standard of value overthrown, because
they know that the establishment of silver
monometallism would be ruinous to them and
to all who are dependent upon them lor em
ployment, or for the supply of commodities at
reasonable prices. .
At the close of Mr. Carlisle's address
Colonel J. C. Roberts, a Populist leader,
arose and attempted to ask the Secretary
if he, in 1878, did not denounce the de
monetization of silver as "the most gigan
tic crime of this or any other age."
Before he could finish his question, the
colonel was seized by a couple of police
officers and ejected from the hall.

GLASS COFFINS.
A Device Calculated to Revolutionise the
Undertaking Business.
CHICAGO, 111., April 15.â Local under
takers are interested in the proposition of
an Indiana company to manufacture glass
coffins on a large scale. In an interview
George F. Kimball, the plate-glass manu
facturer, stated that the idea is en
tirely practicable, and that coffins can be
made from glass much more cheaply than
from wood.
Kimball said that such coffins could be
constructed in the cheaper grades for not
more than 50 cents a running foot. Coffins
made from glass would be much more
durable than metallic caskets, and their
extreme cheapness would cause their adop
tion extensively in cases where death is
due to contagious diseases, in which the
law requires an hermetically sealed cas-
A new method of manufacturing glass,
whereby it is made to so closely resemble
the most costly wood that the eye cannot
distinguish the difference, will enable the
manufacturer to lend infinite variety to
his product.

ATHENS, Greece, April 15.â The Olym
pian games were closed to-day with the
distribution of prizes to the victors in the

Olympia, and laurel wreatns were given to
the winners of second prizes.
The Stadium band then played the Na
tional air of each country represented in
the game-;, to which music all the prize
winners paraded.
After the parade the games were de
clared to be ended.
The total number of athletes who re
ceived crowns was forty-four, of whom
eleven were Americans, ten Greeks, seven
Germans, five French, three English, two
Hungarians, two Austrian., two Aus

residence of the Crown Prince and arranged
for the holding of the next games in
Athens in 1898.
Banquets in honor of the victors are still

SLUE'S BITTER ARRAIGNMENT.
A Keeley Cure at One End of the Insti
tution and a Beer Saloon
at the Other.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15.â
old fight against the re-election of General
W. B. Franklin as a member of the board
of managers of the National Soldiers'
Home and against the retention of Colonel
A. J. Smith as governor of the home at
Leavenworth, Kans., was renewed in the
House to-day, occupying nearly all ofthe
session, and will rage until 3 o'clock to
morrow. It came on when Hull, chair
man of the Committee on Military affairs,
called up the joint resolution reported
from that committee providing for the
election of Generals Franklin and G. W.
Steele, representatives from Indiana, to
succeed themselves as members of the
board; of General T. J. Henderson, an ex
member of Congress from Illinois, to suc
ceed General John C. Black, ex-Commis
sioner of Pensions, and of General G. L.
Beal of Maine, to succeed General Fessen
den of the same State.
Blue (R.) of Kansas moved to strike out
the name of General Franklin and insert
that of General O. O. Howard, and there
upon addressed the House for two hours.
He bitterly arraigned General Franklin's
administration as president of the board of
managers, declaring that he was virtually
the board, dominating its policy and ac
tion. He charged, he said, from the record,
that General Franklin was either grossly
negligent, grossly incompetent or was not
honest. He held that he was responsible
for the retention in office of Colonel Smith,
whom he accused of drunkenness, frequent
and continued up to the present time â
"vomiting, crawling drunk" â and of bru
tality to the inmates of the home under
his charge.
General Franklin and Colonel Smith
were defended by General Curtis (R.) of
New York, a member of the Committee on
Military Affairs; Poole (R.) of New York
and Henry (R.) of Connecticut, and these
officials and the board of managers by
â¢General G. W. Steele (R.) of Indiana, a
member of the board.
Mahon (R.) of Pennslvania proposed an
amendment to the joint resolution provid
ing for a Congressional investigation of the
criarges of drunkenness and brutality
against Colonel Smith, the officer to be re
moved by the board of managers should
a majority of the committee find the
charges to be well founded.
Blue (R.) of Kansas desired to discuss
the resolution in order that he might pre
sent affidavits charging General Franklin
and his man Smith, for whom he was
responsible, with brutal and oppressive
treatment of inmates of the Leavenworth
home. He thought that the House would
hear what he had to say in behalf of the
2000 Kansas veterans incarcerated in that
home.
Hull had suggested that the debate be
limited to two hours, but after Blue' state
ment he said that he would consent that
it go on without limitation at present.
Before beginning the discussion Blue
moved that the name of General Franklin
be stricken out of the joint resolution and
that of the "splendid soldier and noble
Christian, General O. O. Howard," be in
serted. It had been charged, he said, that
his opposition to Franklin and Smith was
based upon personal grounds. This he
denied, saying that his fight against them
was born of a desire only to relieve the
men from the oppression of the drunken
and brutal governor and secure for them
such treatment as should be accorded to
men who gave their best services in de
fense of their country, and he proposed,
he said, to lay bare the facts, let the con
sequences be what they might. He de
clared that Smith, the governor, had been
drunk a hundred â "vomiting, crawl
ing drunk."
Steele (R.) of Indiana did not know this
and did not believe it, as he was the head
of the National Keeley League.
Blue said he was in the Keeley League
for profit, and asserted that what most
people did not know about these homes
would fill a very large volume.
Blue then read affidavits, letters and
telegrams, approving his fight against
Franklin and Smith, and to show that
Smith was at the present time, or in the
very recent past, indulging in intoxicating
liquors.
Blue read from the report of the in
spector-general, which showed that the
beer saloon in the home paid a profit in
the last fiscal year of over $13,000. Reply
ing to questions as to whether he had any
charge to make against General Franklin's
personal character, Blue said that Frank
lin was either grossly negligent, grossly
incompetent or not honest, and that he
had in his hands Government funds that
ought to be paid over to the treasury.
In connection with this last statement,
Blue asserted that when Congress sepa
rated the officers of president and treas
urer of the board, which Franklin then
held, he (Franklin) took up his man Fri
day and made him treasurer, and he
(Franklin) controlled the funds of the
board as he formerly did.
Morse of Massachusetts desired to know
if the matters complained of at the home
were not due to the existence of a beerhall
in connection with the institution, and if
this ought not first to be shut up.
"Yes, and it is needed," exclaimed Blue,
"also to shut up the mouth of the beer
guzzler who presides over it."
Curtis of New York, reviewing Blue's ar
raignment of Governor Smith, General
Franklin and, indirectly, the board of
managers, explained that there was given
to the selection of the new members all
tlie dignity and deliberation that would
attach to the election of a President of the
United States.
General Franklin, he said, had been for
a long time a member of the board. The
charges against him were old and had been
thoroughly investigated. He regretted
that the report of the officers making the
investigation had not been laid before the
House.
General Steele (R.) of Indiana followed
General Curtis. He asked if the House
was to destroy the reputatious of as good
soldiers as ever did battle for the Union
and throw them to the winds because it
won't hear but one side of the case. All
these charges had been investigated by the
board of managers and suD-committees of
the board.
While discussing the matter of the beer
saloons at the homes Steele was asked by
Milnes (R.) of Michigan if it were the
policy of the managers to run a saloon at
one end of the home and a Keeley cure
at the other.
Steele replied that it was the policy to
manage the home for the best interests of
the inmates. The practical question was
whether the homes should have the profits
of the beer sales or the saloons outside,
where the old soldier was not only made
drunk but robbed. The experience at
Marion, his own residence place, showed
that the policy of letting the saloons out
side have the trade was not to the advan
tage of the home. t
Mahon (R.) of Pennsylvania offered an
additional section to the joint resolution,
providing for an investigation of the
charges of drunkenness and brutality
against Colonel Smith by a joint Con
gressional commission ; if the charges be
sustained by a majority of that commis
sion, the board of managers to be directed
to remove him from his position.
Blue said he would reserve a point of
order against that amendment.
On motion of Hull the House at 5 o'clock
adjourned until to-morrow, an agreement
having been reached between him and
Blue that the vote on the joint resolution
should he taken at 3 o'clock.

The Dupont Election Case Still Unsettled.
Bills and Resolutions Passed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15.-It was
made pretty clear from an incidental re
mark in the Senate to-day that the pre
diction as to an early adjournment of
Congress is not likely to be verified. The
slowly moving Dupont election case had
been taken up and Gray of Delaware was
in the act of beginning an argument
against the right of Mr. Dupont when the
chairman of the Committee on Appropri
ations (Allison of Iowa) made an inquiry
as to the time when the election case
would probably come to a vote. Mitchell
of Oregon, chairman of the Committee on
Privileges and Elections, said that there
were at least half a dozen more speeches
to be made upon it, and that therefore he
could not fix any time for the vote, al
though he was very anxious to have the
case disposed of.
He consented to let the matter go over
when Gray should have finished his
speech, so as to make way for the Indian
appropriation bill, the naval appropria
tion bill and Peffer's resolution for an in
vestigation of the recent bond issues.
"That practically means," Gorman in
terposed, "that the Dupont case is not to
be disposed of until after the Ist of June."
Bills were passed as follows : Senate bill
for the protection and preservation of
burial-places of soldiers and sailors of the
war of 1812; House joint resolution rela
tive to the medals of honor awarded
under the joint resolution of 1862 and
1863; amending the act providing for the
protection of the salmon-fisheries of
Alaska; to provide for the private sale of
public lands in Missouri; regulating the
incorporation of medical and dental col
leges in the District of Columbia; joint
resolution authorizing the wearing of a
rosette or knot of ribbon in lieu of medals
of honor awarded by the acts of 1862 and
1863. y^xyyyy
Gray occupied over three hours in the
presentation of the case against Dupont's
claim to the vacant seat from the State of
Delaware, and had not finished his speech
when the Senate, at 5:30 p. m., after an
executive session, adjourned until to
morrow.
IX EXECUTIVE &ESSIOX.
Treaty Between the United .State, and
Great Britain Ratified.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April After
a discussion of little more than half an
hour the Senate this afternoon in execu
tive session ratified the treaty between the
United States and Great Britain providing
for the appointment of a commission to
assess the damages alleged to have been
sustained by Canadian sealers whose ves
sels were seized by the Government of the
United States for alleged illegal sealing.
The treaty provides that each Government
shall appoint one commissioner, and if
they cannot agree the Presideut of the
Swiss Republic is to select a third. .7 ; * l
The commission as provided for in the
original treaty was to sit at Vancouver,
but an amendment was inserted that the
commission shall also be allowed to sit in
San Francisco.
The only other amendment of an im
portant natureâ and even that is said to
be unimportantâ is the expunging of the
word "award" from the text of the con
vention where reference is made to the
proceedings of the Paris tribunal, this
Government contending that the Paris
tribunal did not make any award on the
question of damages, that it went even
further and refused to consider that ques
tion at all. Otherwise the treaty is as
signed by Sir Julian Pauncefote and Sec
retary Olney.
When Senator Sherman called it up this
afternoon, there was a disposition on the
part of some of the Senators to postpone
action until the return to the Senate of
Senator Morgan, but this was deemed to
be impracticable, owing to the uncertainty
as to when Morgan would be able to re
sume his duties. Sherman notified the
Senate that the State Department
was exceedingly anxious to have the
matter disposed of at the earliest
opportunity, and he further stated that
if the Senate intended to ratify the
convention at all, it might as well be
done now as at any other time, and thus
obliterate the idea that was held by some
that this Government was trifling with the
subject. Briefly he explained the pro
visions of the treaty.
Pugh of Alabama, although he favored
the treaty, thought it would be better to
await the return of Mr. Morgan. Other
Senators appeared to be content to accept
the judgment of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, *y.'7
The text of the convention was then
read at length, but little attention being
paid to it the Senators, other than mem
bers of the committee, occupying the time
in writing letters. Mr. Sherman indicated
the character of the amendments and then
moved the ratification ofthe instrument as
amended. The ratification was agreed to
without the formality of a vote, and with a
unanimity that was unexplained. Mr.
Sherman frowned down a suggestion to re
move the injunction of -secrecy from the
treaty, and it will be printed and filed
away among the secret archives of the
Senate. â  â  " . .

SANTA ROSA'S
FLORAL COURT
Mrs. Burris Announces the
Attendants of the
Queen.
â _ _____
SAN FRANCISCO HONORED
Miss Suza Crooks Chosen as Maid
of Honor to Her
Majesty.
LADIES-IN-WAITING SELECTED.
The Fairest Buds of a Half-Dozen
Cities Will Surround the Win
some Ruler.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 15.â Mrs. L.
W. Burris, Queen of the Rose Carnival,
made public this evening some of her ar
rangements for the parade. The plans
mapped out by the Queen contemplate a
spectacle of unusual elegance, and will
more than fulfill the expectations of her
friends, who declared all along that
should Mrs. Burris be selected Queen she
and her retinue would surpass all previous
efforts in this line.
The attendants of the Queen will include
one maid of honor, nine ladies in waiting
and eight pages in Fauntleroy suits.
During the parade the Queen and her
attendants will ride upon a magnificent
float, which will be constructed after de
signs furnished by her Majesty, lt will
be drawn by six coal-block horses.
The Queen's maid of honor will be Miss
Suza Crooks of San Francisco, the beauti
ful niece of William T. Baggett.
The ladies in waiting selected by Mrs.
Burris are from San Francisco, Oakland
and Sonoma County towns, including
Sonoma, Sebastopol, Petaluma, Healds
burg and Cloverdale. From Cloverdale
will come Miss Lena Brush, daughter of
the president of the Cloverdale Bank. She
is a decided brunette, and one of the most
beautiful young ladies in the citrus belt.
From Sonoma the carnival is to have Miss
Bertha Campbell a beautiful and stately
blonde, and one of the belles of that historic
town. Petaluma will send two of her fair
est daughters to add to the beauty of the
carnival, in the persons of Miss Dacy Fair
banks and Miss Henrietta Cantell. These
young ladies are daughters of two of Peta
luma's most prominent citizens, and are
both of the blonde type. Miss Anna Mc-
Lain of Healdsburg, a petite blonde of
winsome manners, will represent Santa
Rosa's northern neighbors, whose proud
est boast is of her lovely maids and
matrons. Miss Sadie McMullen, the chosen
of Sebastopol, is a charming brunette, and
a popular favorite in the society of social
Sebastopol.
From Oakland will come Miss Caroline
Frear, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Frear and
a sister of Mrs. E. F. Woodward of this
city. Miss Frear is a graceful demi-blonde,
whose beauty is enhanced by charming
manners. She is well known in Santa
Rosa society. ;â¢'.-Â« â¢ .J'
From her own town, her Royal High
ness has made a most happy selection of
three young ladies. They are Miss Edith
Brooks, a daughter of Elmont Brooks;
Miss Kate Lewis, a daughter of Postmas
ter George Lewis, and Miss Lillie Hill.
Miss Brooks is a dark-eyed brunette of
medium height. Miss Lewis is a tall,
slender and graceful blonde and Miss Hill
is a petite demi-blondeâ any further
attempt to describe . these three flowers
from Santa Rosa's beauty-garden would
be a waste of words.
FRESNO CONTEMPT CASE.
Lawyer Grady Fined for Assailing Judge
Carterâ Must Pay or Go to
Jail.
FRESNO, Cal., April 15.â W. D. Grady,
a former District Attorney of this county
and erstwhile Democratic politician of
considerable note, has been having several
tilts of late with Judge Carter of the Supe
rior Court here. Two days ago the Judge
took exception to some sarcastic flings of
the doughty lawyer and fined him $10 for
contempt. Grady . responded with more
insulting remarks, when Judge Carter
raised the fine to $50. This was no, new
experience for Grady, who neither paid
the fine 'nor attention to the court. The
Judge informed Grady that he would give
him until to-day to pay the fine or go to
jail for thirty days.
When the contempt proceedings came
up in court this morning Grady asked the
court to dismiss the case. The Judge was
inexorable, however, and informed Grady
that neither the fine nor any part of it
would be remitted, but that it must be
paid in full, with the alternative of his
being the guest of the Sheriff. Ten days'
extension was given in order to allow
Grady to choose between the two alterna
tives.

SAM JOSE BANKER DEAD
James A. Clayton, a Pioneer of
the Golden State, Passes
Away.
His Demise the Result of Injuries
Sustained in a Runaway Acci
dent a Year Ago.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 15â James A.
Clayton, one of the most prominent citi
zens of this city, died at the residence of
his daughter, Mrs. Carroll W. Gates, in
Los Angeles, at 3:30 o'clock this morning.
His death resulted from an injury received
in a runaway accident in May, 1894, in
which he suffered a bad fracture of his
left arm. Last July he was obliged to
have the arm amputated at the shoulder,
and he never fully recovered from the
shock of the operation.
Mr. Clayton was born in Derbyshire,
England, in 1831. In 1839 he came to
America with his parents, who settled in
Wisconsin. In 1850 Mr. Clayton, in com
pany with his brother, Joel Clayton,
crossed the plains to California and arrived
in San Jose on August 25, 1850. He re
mained here until February, 1851, when
he went to Placerville and engaged in
mmm.- until November of the same year,
when he went to Australia and followed
mining.
Tn August, 1852, Mr. Clayton returned to
California, residing for a short period in
Stockton, but came again to Santa Clara
County in January, 1853, being employed
as clerk in Santa Clara until he perma
nently settled in San Jose in 1859. Here
he purchased a photographic gallery lo
cated on Santa Clara street, near Market,
removing later to Spring's Corner. This
establishment Mr. Clayton conducted
about thirteen years. In 1861 he was
elected County Clerk of Santa Clara
County and he was re-elected in 1863. In
1867 he established a real-estate office, con
tinuing in that business to the present
date. A few months ago he was elected
president of the First National Bank.
Mr. Clayton was married to Miss Anna
L. Thompson, a native of Indiana, in 1860,
and is survived by her. Seven children
resulted from their marriage, as follows -
Mary E., wife of C. W. Gates of Los An
geles; Edward W. and Willis S., partners
of their father in the real estate business;
John J., also connected with the real
estate business; Grace Elizabeth, who
died in infancy, and Ethel,' Willis and
Florence Clayton.
Mr. Clayton was a large property-owner,
and leaves an estate valued at over $400 -
--000. He was a member of San Jose Lodge
No. 10, F. and A. M., also a member of the
Methodist Episcopal church since 1857
and a trustee of the University of the Pa
cific; was a lay delegate to the Methodist
Episcopal general conference in New York
in 1888. He was a stanch Republican and
one of the alternate delegates for the State
at large to the National Republican Con
vention at Chicago in 1888. His body will
be brought to this city Friday evening.
SACRAMENTO'S MURDERER.
Physicians Are Passing Upon the Sanity
of Simon Ratan. ;,
SACRAMETO, Cal., April 15â trial
of Simon Ratan was this morning con
tinued until to-morrow, and in the mean
time a jury was empaneled to determine
if the prisoner is in a suitable condition of
mind to proceed with his defense. Dur
ing the investigation this evening Dr.
Hoisholt, assistant physician at the Stock
ton Insane Asylum, testified that he could
not positively pronounce Ratan insane,
but from all indications he considered
him so. Hoisholt detailed the reasons on
which he based his opinion, and the in
vestigation was continued until 11 o'clock
to-morrow, y:
Santa Cruz's Fatal Accident.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 15â Bert
Waterman, the young man who was in
jured in a runaway yesterday, died this
morning shortly after daylight. There
was no chance for his recovery, judging
from the fracture of the skull. It was con
sidered remarkable that he lived as long
as he did, for when he was picked up after
the accident it was believed that he was
already dead. The funeral will occur to
morrow afternoon. ,ây,
SANTA BARBARA SENS ATION.
Seamen of the Cruiser Philadelphia Ar
rested for Drugging Two
Girls.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 15â
An arrest of a highly sensational charac
ter was made here yesterday, when J. M.
Ramsay and James Collins, seamen at
tached to the flagship Philadelphia, were
taken into custody, charged with an at
tempt to poison two girls, Alice True and
Sarah Calderon, waitresses in a State
street restaurant. When the merry tars
marched down the street yesterday on pa
rade in their icecream uniforms the girls
stepped into the street and identified them
as the men who had attempted to drug
them. The sailors were permitted to pro
ceed down the wharf -and to return to the
ship, where they were afterward arrested
at the instance of the local authorities.
They were not permitted to give bail, and
spent- an " uncomfortable night in the
county jail. â7 7 ; 'yy
Upon their examination in the Police
Court to-day Ramsay was discharged, the
evidence being regarded as insufficient to
hold him, but Collins was retained in cus
tody.
: ; Although local officers were permitted to
go aboard the ship and make this arrest,
some nice questions of jurisdiction bid fair
to arise out of the affair, for it has gener
ally been conceded that a battle-ship was
subject to j naval rule only, and never to
civic authority. ;7 j
BASEBALL AT STANFORD.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
15â On Friday next, which is to be a holi
day, the juniors and freshmen will match
a picked nine against a combination of
seniors and sophomores. All the best
players in college will take part, and the
match will be one of the most interesting
seen on the diamond here for many a day.
As a general rule these interciass games
evoke far more enthusiasm than matches
with outside athletes or preparatory school

After all arrangements had apparently
been made for a collecting expedition to
Kamchatka the enterprise has fallen
through and Stanford may be unable to
send a party to that little-known portion
of Siberia for some time to come. Dr. Jor
dan was endeavoring to arrange for the
passage of two students and paraphernalia
on one of the sealing vessels, but no satis
factory terms could be reached. Timothy
Hopkins had kindly consented to pay the
cost of the expedition, but matters are all
off now, with no prospect of a visit to Kam
chatka. Expeditions will be sent out
however, during the summer to various
points along the Pacific Coast.
SANTA. ROSA EXAMINATION.
John Mize, the Would- Re Suicide, Is De
clared Insane.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 15â The sec
ond examination of John Mize, on a charge
of insanity, was held here to-day. Mize
was declared insane a few uays ago, but
the Judge refused to sign the commitment,
as Mize had a charge of criminal assault
pending against him in this county, and
was at the time out of $5000 bail. Drs. M.
M. Shearer, J. W. Clark, F. H. McNeel of
this city, District Attorney Bell and At
torney Colwell of Napa County and Dr.
Gardner of the Napa Insane Asylum were
present during the inquiry. '
From the testimony it was shown that
Mize had made no less than five attempts
to commit suicide, his latest effort in that
iine being made on Saturday last, when he
swallowed a dose of morphine. Two years
ago the demented man shot himself in the
forehead and has carried the bullet ever
since. His relatives say that since that
time he has been more than usually vio
lent, requiring constant watching. On
this showing the Napa County officials
were satisfied as to the insanity of the un
fortunate man. The criminal charges will
be dismissed and Mize will be sent to an
asylum.
SEEK WESTERN IS HANDS.
Scheme to Send Unmarried Women to
Western Canada.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 15â
Mayor of Vancouver has received a queer
letter from Toronto, written in the inter
ests of the young women in Toronto and
other Eastern Canadian cities. In this
unique epistle the writer states that, ac
cording to statistics, there is a shortage in
the female population in the Northwest
territories and British Columbia amount
ing to about 40,000, and there is in Eastern
Canada a corresponding overplus of un
married women, in order to equalize
matters, it .is proposed to send young
women of good health and moral charac
ter west, to be distributed where the de
mand is greatest, and for this purpose it
is sought to establish a home at Vancouver
for the reception and distribution of the
young demoiselles for British Columbia.

LOS ANGELES
STREET AFFRAY.
Edwin N. Brown Punished
for Insulting a
Woman.
HIS EYES, IN MOURNING.
Given a Severe Beating at the
Instance of Mrs. H. C.
Andrews.
SENT HER INDECENT LETTERS.
He Is Pointed Out to the Woman's
Husband, Who Proceeds to Se
cure Satisfaction.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 15â Edwin
N. Brown, an insurance agent, received a
sound thrashing to-day at the hands of an
Irate husband in the most public place in
Los Angeles. It was at the crowded corner
of First and Spring streets that H. C.
Andrews and his wife met Brown. "That
is the man who insulted me," exclaimed
Mrs. Andrews, and immediately her hus
band sailed into the insurance agent and
would have made him a subject for the
hospital but for the timely interference of
Officer Singleton, who placed both men
under arrest, but not before both of
Brown's blue eyes were beaten black and
he was otherwise disfigured.
Mrs. Andrews had some correspondence
with Brown on business matters, and she
alleges that he sent insulting letters. She
says his language was such as to make
him culpable for sending obscene matter
through the mails, and she proposes to
have him arrested for it by the Federal
authorities.
Mrs. Andrews is identified with many
secret organizations. She has held the
office of chief companion of the forest in
the Woman's Auxiliary to the Foresters
of America. She is also connected
with the Woodmen of the World.
She is a woman of great business
capacity and made the circles of
Forestry a great success in this State. She
is also one of the best woman speakers in
the city, and is always chosen to repre
sent the women on the platform in the
various societies she belongs to. She is
decorated with many emblems of the
orders she belongs to. Andrews, who de
fended his wife's honor so gallantly, is a
motorman on one of the electric roads.
HUNTINGTON'S CHANCE.
Can Buy a Section of the Atlantic and
Pacific if He Pays Enough.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 15.âRe
ceiver C. W. Smith and the bondholders'
committee of the Atlantic and Pacific
road, who are making a tour of inspection
of the property, arrived here by special
train at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon. The
party is chaperoned by Superintendent A.
G. Wells of the Atlantic and Pacific, and
consists, besides Receiver Smith, of: Fred
eric B. Jennings of New York, counsel of
the Atlantic and Pacific; J. D. Probst of
New York; William Basset of Boston;
Francis S. Bangs, president of the United
Stales Trust Company of New York; Otto
Bannard, president of the Continental
Trust Company of New York; Henry L.
Sprague ano J. G. McCullough, vice-presi
dent of the Erie Railroad and formerly
Attorney-General of California.
Receiver Smith and Counsel Jennings
proceeded to the chambers of United
States Circuit Judge Ross, where they had
a consultation concerning the foreclosure
proceedings. At 4 o'clock the entire party,
with the exception of Receiver Smith, left
for Santa Barbara. Mr. Smith went to
Santa Monica this evening to visit his
family.
With reference to a recent dispatch from
New York, stating that Judge Collier's de
cree of foreclosure in the case of the United
States Trust Company vs. the Atlantic
and Pacific Railroad was but a preliminary
step toward the sale of that line, Receiver
Smith said the decree covered only that
part of the line in New Mexico, but he be
lieved decrees would also be shortly issued
covering the property in Arizona and Cali
fornia. In reply to a question as to whether
Huntington had secured control of that
portion of the road between The Needles
and Mojave, Mr. Smith said:
"No, but if Huntington wants it he can
hnve it. We are more than willing to sell
it. because we can build a parallel line to
fill the gap for 30 per cent less money than
it will cost Huntington. The Southern
Pacific built that portion of the road origi
nally, but Huntington does not control
the bonds. He probably would like to.
If he wants to buy the* road let him put

Declares He Has Secured the Nevada
Southern Railway.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April Mayor
Carlson of San Diego is in the city, having
just returned from Denver, whither he
went to get possession of the Nevada South
ern Railway. He says that he succeeded,

about the little matter of the $200,000 lieu
on the road, but declared that would be
all right, and that he would explain his
plans to-morrowâ the last day in which to
redeem the line. If he fails it will be sold
by the Sheriff of San Bernardino County,
unless Mayor Carlson can devise some
legal hitch to uelav proceedings. It is be
lieved thai this is his scheme, and that an
attempt will be made to stop the sale by
means of an injunction or some' such
method.
The Nevada Southern extends irom

cured title to the road, bin the Sheriff of
San Bernardino has been operating it
under attachment for debt Carlson pro
poses to make it a link in the projected
railroad between Salt Lake and San Diego.
ALASKA INDIAN JUSTICE.
Natives Refuse to Prosecute a Man Who
Settled for a Murder.,
PORT "TOWNSEND, Wash., April 15.-
The steamer Topeka from Alaska brought
news of the acquittal of Chum Lung and
another white man, charged with the
murder of an Indian policeman at Sitka
last December. This murder aroused con
siderable excitement at the time, as the
Indian policeman was very popular and
his tribe threatened revenge. It is said
that since the murder was committed the
friends of the murderers made peace with
the tribe to which the policeman belonged
by paying the price set on his body by his
family. Then, in accordance with tribal
customs all over the Northwest, the In
dian witnesses refused to testify against
the murderers.

MOURNING AT CARSON
Thousands Follow the Body of
7 the Late Governor Jones
to the Grave.
Eulogies Pronounced Over His Bier
by th 2 Pasters of Four
Churches.
CARSON, Nev., April 15.â funeral
of the Jate Governor John E. Jone3 took
place from the capitol building this after
noon. Thousands followed the body of
the popular executive to the grave. Gov
ernor Jones was a Mason and also com
mander-in-chief of the Nevada State
militia, and Masons and guards attended
in numbers. The funeral was conducted
under Masonic and military rites.
The ceremony was one of the most
peculiar ever witnessed in America, inas
much as it was also carried out by four
different religious denominations. The
late Governor expressed a dying wish that
each of the religious denominations of this
city be allowed five minutes in which to
express its sorrow or pronounce eulogies.
The Masons arranged, as he had wished,
and the four pastors of this city delivered
short addresses over the body. Rev. Mr.
Nash spoke for the Presbyterians, Rev.
Mr. Wilson for the Methodists, Rev. Mr.
Eddy for the Episcopalians and Rev.
Father Gartland for the Catholic frater
nity.
Professor Stubbs of the Nevada State
University also delivered an eloquent
eulogy, which brought tears to the eyes of
the hundreds of listeners. Mr. Hanford,
the late Governor's private secretary, fol
lowed the professor, sneaking for the Ne
vada Press Association, and bade farewell
to the man he had served and loved. Dur
ing the exercises four choirs â from
each of the religious rendered
music.
When these services were ended the
Masons toot charge of the body and held
their solemn rites. As the procession
started for the cemetery minute guns were
fired from Battery A. Four companies of
militia were in line, as were 200 cadets
from the State University. The procession
extended nearly from the town to the
cemetery, a distance of two miles. Thou
sands of citizens went to the burying
grounds, and it was impossible for a third
of them to get within hearing distance of
the grave. The sen-ices at the cemetery
were performed by the Masons, and as the
last word was spoken three salutes were
tired over the open grave by the State
militia. , "j irvi â  y

THE TRAGEDY AT LATROBE
Walter Freeman Slain Because
He Won in a Wrestling
Match.
Slabbed Without Warning While
"Pleasantly Conversing With
His Opponent.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., April 15.â Later
information from Latrobe tends to prove
that the killing of Walter Freeman by
George Roberts yesterday was a cold
blooded crime. It was developed at the
inquest that young Freeman was not
drunk. The young man belonged to a good
family. The Coroner's jury in its verdict
characterized the act of Roberts as a "cold
blooded murder." All the eye witnesses
declared that no provocation existed.
A short time before the affray the two
engaged in a friendly wrestling match and
Roberts was thrown. Afterward Roberts,
withdrawn pistol, entered the saloon of
James Harm, where Freeman was with
about ten others, and was promptly dis
armed. Later he was seen with Freeman
in an apparently pleasant conversation.
He smiled as he took a large knife from
his pocket, opened it leisurely so as to
excite the suspicion of neither Freeman
nor his friends, and then instantly plunged
it into the necK of Freeman, severing the
juglar vein. â¢

HE GIVES THE BRIDE AWAY.
A Pretty Ceremony, Viewed Only by
Relatives of the Contracting
Parties.
STOCKTON, Cai*. April 15â Edward W.
Hulse and Miss Ollie I. Neill, niece of Gov
ernor Budd, were married this aiternoon.
The wedding took place at tbe home of the
bride's mother on Channel street at 1:30
o'clock and the ceremony was performed
by Rev. E. D. McCreary ofthe Central M. E.
Church. The wedding was what is called
EDWARD WILLIAM HULSE AND HIS BRIDE (FORMERLY MISS OLIVE INEZ NEILL)
a home affair, as only the relatives of the
contracting parties were present, besides,
of course, the officiating clergyman.
Notwithstanding the fact that only rela
tives were to be present elaborate prepara
tions had been made for the event, and it
was a very charming wedding. The deco
rations were remarkable for their beauty
and for the taste displayed in their ar
rangement. Flowers had been sent from
different places, some of them having
come from the Capitol grounds at Sacra
mento. The front parlor, where the cere
mony took place, was in white. Pretty
festoons of smilax extended from a center
piece to the picture molding on
the wall, , and a marriage-bell of
orange blossoms and white roses hung
in the center. Roses of the same color
were banked at intervals about the room.
The back parlor was in pink. The sliding
doors had been thrown back and those
present witnessed the ceremony from that
room. Smilax was run on the lace cur
tains and the door leading into the apart
ment from the hall was banked with date
palms. Behind the shrubbery a harpist
played the wedding strains.
The bride .entered the parlor and took
her position ainderneath the wedding-bell,
attended by her sister, Miss Lulu Neill.
The groom was supported by Marion H.
Wright. The willowly figure of the bride
appeared to good advantage in a gown of
white alpaca silk, which was trimmed
with silk lace and pearl ornaments. The
bridesmaid was attired in a pink gown of
a plain pattern. The groom and the best
man wore the regulation full dress suit.
Rev. Mr. McCreary performed the cere
mony impressively, and Governor Budd
gave the bride away. At the wedding all
repaired to the . dining-room, where a
sumptuous repast was served, and the
couple received many hearty congratula
tions. The presents were numerous, and
were sent from different parts of the State.
Th_ bride and the man of her choice are
both well known in this city and in so
ciety. Mr. Hulse came here four years ago
from San Jose, and during his stay in this
city has made many friends. The couple
will leave on this evening's train for Santa
Barbara, whence they will go to Los An
geles. They intended to go with the Gov
ernor and party to attend the fiesta, but
that arrangement could not be carried
out. 7 â _- â

CLEVER COLUSA BANDIT
Robs a Stage of Its Mail Pouch
Without Disturbing the
Driver.
The Theft Not Discovered Until the
Loot Is Found Two Months
Later.
COLUSA, Cal., April James Cropp
and Thomas Anderson found a mail pouch
filled with letters and papers that never
reached their destination. They were
opposite the Kilgore ranch, two miles
from Sycamore, when Cropp noticed some
thing on top of one of the stringers under
a bridge. He at first thought it was a coat,
but upon examination it proved to be a
United States mail pouch. It had been
cut open, the contents rifled and then
replaced. An investigation resulting from
the find reveals the singular fact that the
stage robber who secured the mail was not
detected, nor did the driver or the post
office clerks discover their loss. The con
clusion the authorities have reached is
that he placed an empty sack in the stage
after securing the filled pouch and left his
victims none the wiser.
Cropp brought his find to Colusa and
delivered it to Sheriff E. W. Jones, who
upon investigation found that it contained
the mail from Marysvilie to West Butte
and Kent. The letters were dated and
postmarked Marysvilie, February 6 and 7,
1890, which shows it must have been taken
over two months ago. The Sheriff im
mediately telephoned to the Marysvilie
postmaster and also to the postmasters at
Kent and West Butte asking them if they
had ever failed to receive a mail pouch.
Each said ho had not; that his books
showed the mail had arrived on time
every day. Frank Myers, the stage-driver,
was questioned and said that he handles
only three pouches between Marysvilie
and Colusa and had never missed carrying
and delivering them on time.
One of the recovered letters was from
Warden Hale of San Quentin to W. J.
Wilbur. ' -Â»-\ \"

BRIGADIER KEPPEL IN ERROR.
Indignent Denial of the Salvationist's
Statement Minimizing the
Defection.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 15.â The state
ment made yesterday by Brigadier J. J.
Keppel to a Call reporter that the San
Jose defection in the Salvation Army
ranks had been "headed off" is ridiculed
by tho leaders of the Volunteer movement
in this city, who declare emphatically that
their forces were never in better condition
nor more hopeful of final success than at
the present time. Yesterday advices were
received from Commander Ballington
Booth at New York stating tbat the new
post was duly sanctioned and recognized
as the pioneer organization on the coast.
The standard will be sent at once and a
large supply of the Volunteers' organ, the
Gazette, will be on hand for sale by the
local members the coming week.
It is expected that San Jose will be made
a district headquarters and a well-known
field officer in the old army on the coast
will soon take charge as adjutant of the
district. The local workers are busily en
gaged in canvassing for funds to support
the new work and are meeting with splen
did success, all classes of society rallying
to its aid. As soon as arrangements are
completed the new hall already selected
will be opened and the work pushed vigor
ously.
A telegram was yesterday received from
Colonel Fielding of Chicago, lately in
command of the northwest division of the
old army, giving important counsel to the
local corps. Either the commander, Mrs.
Maud Booth, or Colonel Fielding will
shortly visit the coast in the interests of
ihe new organization. '
Besides the San Jose organization two
other posts are already being organized
and will be announced soon and other
places are in communication with the San
Jose workers. The statement made that
the ringleaders had returned to the old
army is pronounced by the local Volunteers
as untrue. Last Sunday Major Halpin
and wife visited San Jose, accompanied by
Captains William Day, Fong Foo Sec,
William Bourne and wife, and held a num
ber of meetings in an endeavor to stop the
hegira toward Ballington Booth. In the
morning a soldiers' council was held in the
barracks, to which the Volunteers were in
vited, and an attempt was made to explain
the differences now agitating the army.
At the meeting the resignations of the
Volunteers were accepted, with the assur
ance that all who wished would be at lib
erty to return to the army by simply
signing the articles of war anew. At this
time the fact that Bailington Booth would
organize on the coast soon was not known,
and as a consequence a few of the Volun
teers, fearing the possible miscarriage of
the movement, returned to the army. The
publication of Ballington Booth's state
ment the following day in the press of the
State, however, at once revived their inten
tion to stand by him and his work, and all
but three of the soldiers signified their in
tion of joining his organization as soon as
it was perfected. Others, on reading the
statement, have expressed their determina
tion to enlist, and the new army will be
gin its work shortly with a strong force,
backed by substantial moral and financial
support in the community.
The following statement made by Adju
tant Wood in the San Francisco papers is
severely criticized in San Jose, as its facts
are obviously incorrect:
"Furthermore," said the adjutant, "these
people leaving the San Jose camps count for
little anyway. They were grumblers and are
better out of the army. I have recently re
turned from San Jose and know the facts. The
officers who have left are only non-commis
sioned officers, bearing about the same relation
to the army that a deacon does to a church."
Captain W. Thompson, in charge of the
local corps, being shown the article de
clined to give it his sanction, expressing
his astonishment that the adjutant should
have made such a statement. The fact
that the doors of the army were thrown
open last Sunday to all Volunteers who
were willing to return to the old organiza
tion robs the statement of its force, while
the presence of regular commissions in
the hands of nine local officers who have
resigned disproves effectively the other
allegations ascribed to the adjutant in the
article quoted. , .

toria, on the west coast of Vancouver
Island. Interests there include the man
agement of a large salmon-packing
station. As there is no telegraph line
near by, and but comparatively little com
munication with the place otherwise,
Mr. Magnesen's experiment will be
watched with interest. His scheme is one
which also affects shipping-men, for it is
not over two months ago since the United
States cutter Corwin discovered a partially
starved shipwrecked crew not over thirty
miles distant from the place.

UPRISING OF INDIANS.
Canadian Redskins Resent the Attempt
to Suppress Potlatches.
VICTORIA, 8.C., April 15.â There are
indications of serious trouble with the
Indians of Northern British Columbia on
account of the steps taken by the Do
minion Government to suppress pot
latches. On the upper Naas River a mus
tering of natives is reported to be taking
place.
Just as the steamer Danube, which ar
rived her 6 to-day, was leaving the north
from 600 to 700" natives had gathered to
hold a pow-wow to determine what action
should be taken toward resisting the en
forcement of the law. All are determined
to maintain the old custom. Not only
does dissatisfaction exist, but it is reported
that disorder prevails and the police
authorities are meeting with much trou
ble in Keeping peace.
The report brought by the Danube says
that the officers of law are watching the
Indians and imprisoning all who become
particularly often So serious is the
trouble regarded that bloodshed is antici
pated at almost any moment, for tbe in
dignation of the natives is common to
nearly all the tribes.

Ladies' Day Was as Popular as
Ever at Ingleside
Track.
FAVORITES FINISHED IN FRONT
The Handicap a Canter for Cabri
Olive Captured the Heat
Race.
Ladies' day passed off with the usual
gusto and eclat at Ingleside yesterday.
Unmindful of the chilling wind that
brought a ruddy glow to the cheeks and
caused the male portion of the crowd to go
around buttoned to the ears in their top
coats, the fair sport lovers of the opposite
sex filled the grand stand and scanned the
horizon for tips. When ladies' day was
first introduced, some of the more daring
of the pretty young maidens would slip
down the stairs leading from the grand
stand to the asphaltum walk in front of
the betting-ring, "just to take a peek" at
the ring and the horrid men that wagered
their wealth with such reckless abandon
ment.
Like the apple tree that was the source
of such great perplexity to Eve, and
caused her to suffer from disturbing
dreams until she had tasted of its fruit,
the race-going members of the female per
suasion grew bolder, and yesterday many
of them were seen mingling with the men
just back of the bookmakers' boxes, and
the management will soon be compelled
to put up a sign "Keep off the grass."
California has not yet voted female suf
frage, and racetrack folk do not admire
the new woman.
It was the closing day of the two weeks' i
meeting, and as a number of the Eastern
horses were making their last appearance
prior to departing for the scene of racing
operations in the East, a large crowd I
turned out to see the sport. The card was
one of rare excellence, and some very j
pretty finishes resulted.
The favorites had things nearly their I
own way, five out of six passing the stand i
in advance of their fields. Slaughter car
ried off the jockey honors, riding three of
the winners.
A six-furlong selling affair, with eight
facing the starter, was tbe first event up
for decision. Sam Hildreth's Alvero held â¢
sway in the betting, becked from 8 to 5 to I
13 to 10. and ridden out, he passed the j
wire half a length before the 12 to 1 shot, j
Meadow Lark, ridden by Flynn.
The Nevada stable's chestnut horse \
Uncle Giles proved somewhat of a surprise !
in the mile selling run that was next on
the card. Don Caesar opened an 8 to 5 !
choice, going back to twos. He wheeled
When the barrier was raised and the book- j
makers kept all that coin. Little Bob I
went to the post a slight choice at 9 to 5.
Uncle Giles opened in the ring at 6, was !
played down to 4 and again receded to 7 to j
1. Until the stretch was reached there;
was little to the race but Boeder and All
Smoke. Macklin now brought Uncle
Giles up and in a drive to tne wire beat I
Little Bob out a head. All Smoke finished
a good third.
The betting over the mile and a six- :
teenth handicap was very open, but it !
proved a very tame contest. Of the five
Matters Cabrillo was a slight favorite over '
Logan, St. Lee and Kowaisky, going to the ;
post 13 to 5. Jones sent the first choice !
out in front as soon as the field was sent
away, and, always in the lead, won, eased
up, two lengths before Logan. Third place
was taken the last jump by Collins.
All scratcnedoutof the rive-furlong heat
race but four. Olive was a 3 to 5 chance
and captuied the first heat cleverly by a
head after Gold Bug and Levena C had
made the running. Gold Bug finished in
the place. The books now held the favor
ite at 2 to 5, and in a drive she placed the
next heat and race to her credit hv beat
ing Dungarven out a head. Gold Bug was
thrown on the backstretch, her rider, ;
Piggott, luckily escaping injury.
The hurdle " handicap at a. mile and j
three-sixteenths also resulted in a victory i
for the Corrigan colors. Contentment and i
Silverado carrying the green with white j
sash, coupled in the betting, went into the |

IN REALMS OF MYSTERY.
Professor Francis Angell on
Hallucinations and
Illusions.
Planchette-moving, mind-reading, table
turning and spirit-rapping were among
the subjects touched upon by Professor
Francis Angell of Stanford University dur
ing his lecture on "Illusions and Hallu
cinations" delivered last night in the hall
of the Academy of Sciences.
"There are undoubted facts," he said,
"which science is unable to explain. If
we were asked to say what we perceived in
this hall after leaving it to-night there
would be a vast difference among the de
scriptions given. Some would be faithful
and others misleading. We know that
some artists have so perfect a faculty of
mental imagery that they can paint a per
fect portrait from one sitting. An in
stance of sound memory is that furnished
in the case of Mozart, who after one bear
ing reproduced in written score the famous
'Miserere' sung by seven distinct vocal
parts.
"We have many things in mind which
have no present place in consciousness.
The ticking of a clock may be in our
minds, but we are not conscious of it until
it stops, as a general thing. Another
point is that the things which we have in
mind always tend to come into the realm
of consciousness. The question suggests
itself why these hidden thoughts of the
mind do not assume reality. I answer that
sometimes they do. We often keep them
down, and resist them, when they strive
to come to the light of consciousness; but
when we are free from conventional re
straints, as in dreams, in sleep, under
hypnotic control, or under the influence
of hashish, or opium, they become start
ingly real.
"Many of the tricks of so-called magi
cians are attributed to sleight of hand, but
without sufficient reason. The mental im
pression caused in the beholder by the
looks and acts or the performer seems to be
completely overlooked. The secret con
sists in the magician impressing the idea
of what he feigns to perform. The idea of
motion is incipient motion itself. This
principle being admitted, much light will
be cast upon the operations of the plan
chette."

CHANGES NEAR THE PRESERVES
A Big Creamery and Special Milk
Train May Be Established for
Drake's Bay.
The dairy region of Marin County, from
Tomales Bay to San Kafael and within
easy distance of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad, is capable of supplying daily
with fresh milk and cream the entire
population of San Francisco. The railroad
people are willing to put on a special milk
train early in the morning, to run from
Point Reyes and connect with the bay
ferry service, so the product of the milk
ranches may be delivered in the City at
the proper hour in the morning.
J- B. Stetson, the president of the com
pany, and William F. Russell, general
freight agent of the line, can show to the
milkmen in that region that a creamery
enterprise at Point Reyes would be profit
able to both the farmers and the railroad,
but the milkmen yet prefer to adhere to
the old and safe plan of converting the
milk into butter. In order to get the
traffic the company may decide to pro
mote the establishment of a creamery at
Point Reyes and buy all the milk that can
be bought there, and, if necessary, make
the surplus into cheese of the finest quality
known.
Recently a company has been incor
porated to establish a creamery near an
estuary of Drakes Bay. where water power
is available, to handle dairy products by
what is known as tbe Russell process. Dr.
Burdell, Mr. Abbott and others are en
gaged in the enterprise. If plans in view
are carried out, milk and cream may be
sent by water, using tugboat service from
the landing near the creamery to the
San Francisco wharf. Tempestuous
weather during the winter season might
interfere with the transportation of the
dairy product, but evidently the promo
ters of the enterprise have taken such
chances into account.
A report has gained currency that the
preserves of the Country Club would be
cut up into sixty-acre tracts and leased for
milk ranches. The rumor in this respect
is misleading. Fred R. Webster, one of
the directors of the club, was seen yester
day, and said it was not the purpose of the
institution to so allot its preserves. Facts
which he submitted show clearly that
the club is in a prosperous condition. It
owns clubhouse, stables, kennels and
lands adjoining valued at $30,000, and is
not in debt. Its possessions or preserves,
over which it holds long leases, cover 76,
--000 acres of land. The hills and forests
abound in game. The many lakes and
streams are stocked with trout, and the
stock is replenished annually with 100,
--000 to 300,000 fish.

the Country Club are many Swiss and
Italian farmers. They. are famous for suc
cess in dairy farming, and since Marin
County is a favored region by reason of
the great number of its springs, streams
and lakes, the dairy industry thrives. The
ocean fogs bear moisture in the summer
months, and hence there is no season of
the year when the grazing cattle cannot
find green grass. y\ \
The leading representatives of the Coun
try Club may decide to open its member
ship to other than members of the Pacific-
Union Club. , As the rule stands now only
members of the Pacific-Union are eligible
to the Country Club. ' To belong to the
City institution an initiation of $200 and
annual dues of $120 are required. Then
to join the Country Club there is another
initiation fee of $150, as well as annual
dues of $100, so the cost of initial mem
bership in the club reaches $570. Of the
100 members belonging to the institution,
that number being the present limit, per
haps not more than twenty-five take an
active interest in fishing and hunting, and,
indeed, all of these are not enthusiasts in
the sport.
It has been suggested that other young
men of the City, who would make excellent
members and fully comprehend the spirit
and purposes of the organization, should
be admitted to membership without first
joining the Pacific-Union.
KELLOGG'S UNKNOWN PEIENDS.
Result of tbe Publication of a Fake
Story Concerning Her.
Clara Louise Kelloyg's occasional ap
pearance at a modest downtown table
d'hote a year ago gave rise to the story
that has gone the rounds of Western
country papers that her once large for
tune had been lost in business speculation,
making it necessary for her to live in the
cheapest fashion. This story was pub
lished in a freak New . York newspaper
first, and the poverty of the famous singer
was described with much pathos. Once
started, the story traveled rapidly,
to the amusement of Miss Kel
logg's friends, who knew that several
hundred thousand dollars stood between
her and the poverty so graphically de
scribed. Not long ago the farmers' papers
of lowa published the story, and as a re
sult Miss Kelloge received "a tribute that
has pleased her. It was a letter from an
lowa farmer and his wife asking her to
make her home with them. The letter re
ferred to Mies Kellogg' alleged poverty,
and the writers said that they hadn't much
money themselves, but that if " Miss
Kellogg would share it with them
they would be pleased. If she
hadn't car fare, they offered to send
her money enough to pay her ex
penses. In explanation of "their offer
they said that a iew years ago they had
heard her sing in Chicago. Miss Kellogg
wrote to her lowa admirers that she ap-
Ereciated the kindness of sheir invitation,
ut that she had not been reduced to
poverty. She told them that she occa
sionally went to cheap table d'hote din
ners to get special dishes that she en
joyed, and to see the people who fre
quented them. Miss Kellogg wrote as
nice a letter as she knew how, and the old
couple acknowledged it, and replied that
they were pleased that Miss Kellogg was
not reduced to poverty, and at the same
time disappointed because she could not
accept their hospitality. â Pittsburg Dis

DID HOT REMOVE WEAVER
A Deadlock Still Exists in the
Board of Health Over
the Matter.
THE FINDINGS WERE ACCEPTED
Mayor Sutro Is Given a Week to
Look Over the Testimony
Before Vol ing.
Three members of the Board of Healthâ
Drs. Hart, Morse and Fitzgibbonâ strove
yesterday to oust Superintendent Weaver
from his position at the Almshouse, and
the remaining two Mayor Sutro and Dr.
Williamsonâ succeeded in defeating the
project. After a mass of routine business
had been disposed of the findings of the
committee appointed some time ago to in
vestigate the Almshouse management were
presented and a motion made that they
be accepted.
The report found that there were seven
teen separate reasons why Mr. Weaver
should be removed, including mismanage
ment, incompetency, inhumane conduct,
untruthfulness and other matters.
Mayor Sutro objected to the acceptance
of the report on the ground that he had
not been given an opportunity to look the
matter over and decide how he should
vote. He offered an amendment provid
ing that he should be given a week's time
to read the testimony. and gain abetter
understanding.
The amendment was lost, and then the
report was accepted on the votes of Drs.
Hart, Morse and Fitzgibbon. Then the
report was taken up count by count and
accepted in that manner. Mayor Sutro
and Dr. Williamson declining to vote. Dr.
Fitzgibbon | made a motion that the posi
tion of superintendent be declared vacant,
but it was finally decided to postpone the
matter for one week to give the Mayor a
chance to read tne testimony and findings.
â¢ "All right," said the Mayor. "You
can't come games on me."
It is not probable that the meeting at
which the Mayor will announce his de
cision will be productive of anything new.
Mayor Sutro has shown an inclination to
befriend the Weavera, and with the back
ing they have received from prominent or
ganizations and individuals in the City,
will probably adhere to his intention of
refusing to vote for their removal. Dr.
Williamson is still less likely to change
his mind, and without either of these
votes Weaver cannot be removed.
Milk Inspector Dockery made a startling
report at the close of the meeting regard
ing the cows and milk at the Almshouse.
He stated that out of a herd of thirty-four
cows nearly all were suffering from tuber
culosis and that the inmates ofthe institu
tion were fed on skim milk. The report
was accepted and placed on file.
The Journeymen Bakers' Union sent in
a communication asking that the board
appoint an inspector of bakeries. The let
ter named half a dozen bakeries that were
said to be in a filthy condition, without
ventilation and totally unfit for the pur
poses for which they are used.
The communication also stated that
there were a large number of baKeries that
use tainted eggs, or in lieu of even that,
poisonous coloring matter in the baking of
cakes. The board will consider this mat
ter.
A petition was presented by the em
ployes of the Health Office, asking that the
waiting-room for patients desiring to be
taken to the City and County Hospital be
removed from the rooms of the depart
ment to some more suitable location.
They declared the room to be a nuisance
and a menace to the health of those who
were compelled to work near it. The com
munication was placed on file.
Dr. Stahie, the Superintendent of the
City and County Hospital, sent in a com
munication denying that the meat at the
hospital is bad. He asked that the board
satisfy itself thoroughly on this point.
Professor Wenzell, the chemist of the
board, reported against the use of forma
line in the preservation of milk and canned
foods. He said that it was detrimental to
health and should not be permitted.
The Bank of England has 1160 officials
on its payroll, which amounts to about
Â£500,000 a year, and 1000 clerks. If a clerk
is late three times he receives a warning;
the fourth time he is discharged at once.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
An unpledged delegation is the thing.
Perhaps Holmes thought his confession
was "just killing.'"
It rained yesterday, but the spirit of the
primaries was not dampened.
As a work of political art the Kelly and
Mahoney combination will figure only as
a bust.
The creation of Cleveland's that will live
longest is probably the Venezuelan Com
mission.
Whenever a Democrat sees a brick he
throws it whether he sees a head to throw
it at or not.
Santa Barbara took the lead in starting
California festivals and has a very pretty
show of keeping it.
Spain may get a considerable revenue
from Cuba, but it is not enough to defray
the cost of keeping it-
California is opposed Io none of the
great leaders of the Republican party and
should not appear to be so.
In scattering all over the country many
Democrats are deluded into the belief that
they are spreading themselves.
People who have as a rule the least sym
pathy with Populist fads would like to get
an imperative mandate on Grover.
Eastern editors of all shades of political
opinion have about agreed that the man
who wrote of balmy spring was an idiot.'

AN UNPLEDGED DELEGATION.
The Call favors an unpledged delega
tion from California to the St. Louis con
vention. It is not opposed to McKinley,
Reed. Allison, CuUom, Morton or any
other leader of the party. It has can
didate. It seeks to advance no one Repub
lican leader at the expense of another. It
is opposed to none of the great men who
have been named for the high office of
President of the United States by the Re
publican party. It will support loyally
and vigorously any one of them who may
receive the nomination at St. Louis. For
that reason it stands to-day and will stand
all the time in favor of California sending
an unpledged delegation to that conven
tion.
The arguments in favor of an unpledged
delegation are many. A National conven
tion to nominate a President of the United
States should be a deliberative body. This
is true in all cases and under all circum
stances, but it will beparticttlerly so at the
St. Louis convention, since it is evident
that the man nominated at that conven
tion will be the next President of the
United States. The men who are to taKe
part in his nomination should be left free
to weigh the merits of ail the candidates,
to consider which is the most available,
which is the most likely to serve the inter
ests of the whole people, and in our par
ticular case, which will be the most likely
to serve the interests of California and the
Pacific Coast.
California has no interests opposed to
the Nation, but she has interests peculiarly
her own which are unknown to the Nation
at large, and which must, therefore, be
advocated by her own people. It is for
that reason that her delegation to the con
vention at St. Louis should be unpledged
to any particular candidate and left free to
advance her interests as best tbey can.
It is clear that if our delegation should
be sent with its hands tied, pledged to
some particular man, it would be re
garded as antagonistic to every other can
didate before the convention. California
does not wish to appear in that aspect to
the Republicans of her sister States. She
wishes to appear to stand as she does stand,
pledged to any candidate who may be
nominated at the convention. It is to her
advantage, therefore, and due to her posi
tion in the Union to send to St. Louis a
delegation pledged to nothing beyond the
great principles of the party and a cordial
support of its chosen leader.
California should have a delegation of
strong men, men of resource, men of
ability, men of brains, men who know her
interests and will defend them, and make
them recognized at the National Conven
tion. It is such a delegation as that whicii
The' Call supports, and we urge the co
operation of Republicans throughout the
State to assist us in the work of sending
to the St. Louis convention a delegation
pledged only to the Republican party and
whichever leader it nominates for the next
President of the United States.
ENFORCE THE LAW.
That the Southern Pacific Company con
tinues to operate its trains through the
City of San Francisco in utter disregard
of the laws and lives of the people is not
to be wondered at. At intervals, frequent
enough to have aroused the people of
almost any other community to a state of
riot long before this, is its list of victims
added to. Some are slightly injured, some
are made cripples for life, some linger in
suffering and agony until death comes as
a welcome relief, some are killed outright
with scarcely a mark to show the canse of
their sudden taking off, while others are
so horribly torn and mangled as to be al
most beyond recognition.
In every instance where death results
there lie three distinct causes of action â
two criminal and one civil. There is a vio
lation of the municipal ordinance prohib
iting trains from running faster than eight
miles an hour within the City limits; man
slaughter has undoubtedly been commit
ted, as the killing resulted from a willful
violation of a law, regardless of any other
circumstances, and damage has resulted to
the surviving heirs. An occasional civil
suit for pecuniary damages is brought, but
who ever heard of a criminal prosecution
of the Southern Pacific Company for vio
lating the eight-mile-an-hour ordinance,
when it is a notorious fact that their trains
are sent rushing through' the City at a
speed exceeding thirty miles an hour a
score of times a day; in fact, their pub
lished time-card on the coast division pro
vides for this deliberate violation of the le
gally expressed will of the people.
For each such offense there is a prescribed
penalty, which, if imposed through the
efforts of the regular authorities, would
probably put a stop to such sad scenes as
the one witnessed by two young girls on
Tuesday, when C. H. Green was struck
and killed by the San Jose express at Day
street. As described by the two witnesses
mentioned, "the 'train came whizzing
around the curve," at a point where the
law requires it to move at a race no faster
than eight miles an hour. But should the
infliction of the legal penalties for viola
tions of the law prove to b â¢ without suf
ficient deterrent effect, the prosecution on
a charge of manslaughter, not of an en
gineer or a conductor, but the highest of
ficials of the Southern Pacific Company,
who are really responsible for the fast run
ning of trains and the consequent fatali
ties, might prove more efficacious. Here
is a good work for the Grand Jury to take
up. yyy-r â â 
A TKICK AND A FRAUD.
The people of California are warned that
the men claiming to have been elected at
the so-called Republican primaries in San
Francisco on Tuesday are parading under
false pretenses" when they set themselves
up as representing that element of the Re
publican party of the Fourth District that
favors the nomination of ' McKinley.
Neither the men who claim to be elected,
nor the bosses who arranged the farce, noi
the Bluffers who stuffed the ballot-boxes
are in any sense the friends of the Ohio
statesman. They are using his well
deserved honor among Republicans to
gain a factitious popularity and prestige
for themselves.; It is the old story Of the
jackdaw and the peacock's plumage, the
old masquerade of vice trying to shine as
virtue, the old effort of corruption seeking
to delude honesty by assuming to be in
the service of a noble man.
In the conduct of primaries in this City
there has been played again and " again
every form" of offensive trick known to
American politics. Some have been farces
some have been frauds and some have been
downright outrages. That which was
played out on Tuesday under the bossing
of Martin Kelly and Jerry Mahoney was
about the sum of all these villainies. The
scheme began 7 with, a trick sprung in the
State Committee, was carried on at a mid
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1896.
night meeting at which forged proxies and
cunning lies were used as a means, and
was completed by stuffing ballot-boxes at
a farcical primary. To cover the villainy,
the indecency and the futility of all this,
the great name and honest fame of William
McKinley is now used in the hope tbat
under that cloak some loyal Republicans
will be deceived into accepting the rascal
ity and giving it support.
It has been just such offenses as these
perpetrated in the past that have made the
primary elections in this City the sources
of a thousand forms of evil to the State
and to the municipality. If they are to be
carried on with impunity it would be well
for loyal Republicans of the interior of the
State to pay no attention to delegates who
go to State conventions from such prim
aries. What kind of men are they who,
when the facts have been brought to their
knowledge, will accept an election from
ballot-boxes manipulated by the push and
the pull of Mahoney and Kelly? Whom
do these people represent? Does any sane
man believe the Republicans of the Fourth
Congressional District accept Mahoney
and Kelly as their leaders? Is any good
man willing to affiliate with forgers of
proxies, midnight tricksters and the stuff -
ers of ballot-boxes?
The vote cast at the general Republican
primaries which took place yesterday is an
emphatic answer to the challenge thrown
down by the bosses. In them the loyal
members of the party found an oppor
tunity to cast an honest vote and have it
honestly counted. Against the record of
those primaries the Kelly and Mahoney
gang will rage in vain. The friends of
William McKinley are not going to be de
luded into raking chestnuts out of the fire
for such apes as these. Rascality in poli
tics in the Republican party of this City
is no longer possible. The true leaders
have come to the front and have found a
loyal support from the great mass of the
party. The corrupt old district bosses
may forge proxies and the petty poli
ticians who follow them may stuff ballot
boxes at bogus primaries, but in the end
they will gain nothing. Honesty has won
the battle, and corruption stripped of its
old armor can rind no cloak beneath
which to hide itself from the scorn of men.
THE FIRST QUESTION.
Shall California send a pledged or un
pleaged delegation to the St. Louis con-
vention? That is the first question of the
campaign to be decided by the Republi
cans of the State. The Call, favors an
unpledged delegation, because it believes
California Republicans are not antagonis
tic to any of the men who are likely to be
candidates before the convention, and,
therefore, the delegates should not be
pledged to one to the exclusion of others.
It is the mission of The Call, however, to
speak for all, and to that end we invite
leading Republicans in all parts of the
State to make use of our columns in dis
cussing this question, so important to all.
We published yesterday among our "Let
ters from the People" a communication
urging a delegation pledged to McKinley.
That letter represented one phase of
the sentiment of the people. There
are other loyal Republicans who would
like to see the delegation pledged to
Reed, or Allison, or Morton, or Cul
lom, or Quay. Each of these great
leaders has a personal following devoted
to him, and in that following there are no
doubt many persons who would like to see
the California delegation bound to. their
favorite from first to last against any other
candidate whatever. The question there
fore comes: Is that the best way to con
duct Republican politics at this time? It
is a question that presses for an immedi
ate answer, as the State Convention for the
election of the delegates will soon assem
ble, and for that reason we invoke an
earnest but dispassionate discussion of it
at once.
It should be clearly understood at the
outset that an unpledged delegation would
not signify antagonism to any leading
candidate. Because some of the friends of
McKinley have been advocating a delega
tion instructed to vote for him exclusively
a belief has grown up in some quarters
that all who favor an unpledged delega
tion are opposed to him. That belief is
founded in error. Many of the stanchest
friends of McKinley are in favor of unin
structed delegates, believing that by being
free such delegates could have more influ
ence in supporting the man of their choice
than they would have if it were known
they were bound to him absolutely. To
the friends of McKinley therefore, as
to the friends of Allison, Reed, Morton
and the rest, the question of an instructed
or an uninstructed delegation is an open
one. It is an issue that can and must be
debated without reference to particular
candidates. To that discussion, we repeat,
The Call opens its columns and will lav
before the people what the earnest men of
the party think would be best for Califor
nia Republicans to do in order to make
their influence most potent at the National
Convention.
THE CHAMBER'S APPEAL.
The letter addressed by the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce to Speaker
Reed ofthe Honse of Representatives' is a
firm \nd dignified reminder of that states
man's duty with respect to the Nicaragua
canal bill. It calls the Speaker's atten
tion to the fact that both political parties
have indorsed the canal scheme, that the
subject has been before several Congresses
and is now thoroughly understood, and
that he bears the responsibility of action
on the bill pending in the House of Repre
sentatives. He is given politely to under
stand that he is expected to give the
House an opportunity to vote on the meas
ure. The most interesting part of the let
ter is this:
"The development of our commerce, our
industries, our international influence, our
political and military safety, all demand
Its prompt construction under control of
our Government. It will no more injure
vested interests than the Erie canal or the
St. Mary's canal, both connecting the
Great Lakes. On the contrary, like them,
it will create a rapid development on the
west coast of the United States,' which
will aid inland transportation interests.
It will rapidly increase our merchant
marine and open the Pacific Ocean to the
Mississippi Valley and to our Gulf States."
The obvious meaning of this paragraph
is that the overland railroads, which con
trol the opposition to the canal bill, are
fighting it in fear that by crippling the
monopoly which they enjoy the canal
will decrease their earning capacity. The
fallacy of that fear is clearly indicated in
the letter, and the statement - therein
made has always been the contention of
progressive Californians. It stands to
reason that a cheap and slow route to the
great markets of the world for low-grade
products and those in which haste of ship
ment is unnecessary would stimulate the
production of articles requiring haste in
forwarding. It is on these latter that the
best profits are made by all connected
with them producers, transporters and
dealer?. As it is, without any such outlet
as the Nicaragua canal, the overland roads
have to carry all the ' grades, and as the
freight charges on low-grade products are
above a figure that encourages i their pro
duction, great industries which would be
developed by lower freight charges remain
undeveloped, and along with them those
which could afford to pay high rates.
lv short, the railroad companies have
always fought competition on the sole
ground that it would divide the traffic,
persistently ignoring the fact that the in
crease of production to which competition
gives rise more than offsets the loss com
ing from a division of the traffic. It is a
safe prediction that the Southern Pacific
Company will gain more from the stimu
lation of development which the Valley
road will create in the San Joaquin tnan
it will lose by competition with it. More
than that, there are products naturally
suited to water transport as there are
others best served by railroads; and no
country or section having the opportunity
to employ both these lesources can reach
its highest development without their
employment.
OUR NORMAL. SCHOOLS.
At the joint meeting of the trustees of
the three Normal Schools maintained by
the State, President Childs of the San Jose
institution made the surprising assertion
that there is a demand for 800 new
teachers in California every year. Of this
number the Normal Schools furnish -225
and the rest come from county examina
tions and immigration. The importance
of this statement lies in the fact that in
some quarters opposition toward the Nor
mal Schools exists on the assumption that
they are turning out more teachers than
are required, and that their presence is an
inducement to young men and women to
learn a profession which they will not
have an opportunity to pursue. The fact
is that the Normal Schools, numerous and
largely attended as they are, cannot sup
ply the demand.
The efficiency of our Normal Schools
has been greatly raised within the last
decade. Time was when there was a
prejudice, against teachers turned out by
these institutions. This was largely be
cause of their youth, but lack of confi
dence in the institutions was also a factor.
On the occasion of the National conven
tion of teachers held in this City a few
years ago the visitors freely expressed
their astonishment that -mere boys and
girls were so largely in evidence as teach
ers, the Eastern idea being that teachers
of more mature years were more efficient.
But experience has demonstrated to the
country and district boards throughout
the State that the enthusiasm of the young
teachers produced in California has a
special and superior value. As the Normal
School authorities tak^> a particular in
terest in the welfare of their graduates,
extra exertions are made to secure posi
tions for them, and this gives them a dis
tinct advantage. The fledglings remain
for a long time under the moral influence
of the Normal Schools, and so a double
good is accomplished. A certificate of
graduation from any of our three schools
for teachers now commands the highest
resoect. ...
The teachers who come from other States
are a sufficient leaven to keep our educa
tional system in close touch with the meth
ods of the outer world. Their influence is
observable in the State conventions held
every year, and this is amplified by the
presence of eminent instructors in the
Berkeley and Stanford universities. It is
difficult for one not intimately associated
with the educational machinery of the
State to realize the perfection of its work
ing and the importance of its results. In
no other part of the country is toe move
ment so earnest and virile. -While we are
absorbed in contemplation of the indus
trial ! and commercial achievements and
possibilities of the State, we are in danger
of overlooking the value of a factor which
is silently working for the achievement of
those tangible. results. Out of such an ed
ucational system, public and private, as
that which is nurturing the intelligence of
the people will come a solution of the
problems that are vexing us. California

for its fruits, flowers, climate and gold
mines. It is eminently fitting that this
engine for the advancement of our fame
and prosperity should receive the most
generous support of the people.
A FAVORITE SONG.
James Whitcomb Riley has addressed the
following verses to Professor Crouch, the dying
author of "Kathleen Mavourneen":
Kathleen Mavourneen , the song is still ringing
As fresh and as clear as the trill of the oird.
In the world-weary hearts It is sobbing and sing
ing.
In paLhos too sweet for the tendereat word.
Oh, have we forgotten the one who first breathed lt?
And have we forgotten his rapturous art?
Our meed to the mas: er whose genius bequeathed it ;
Oh, why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart?
Kathleen Mavourneen, thy lover still lingers,
The long night Is waningâ the stars pale and few.
Thy sad serenader, with tremulous fingers.
Is bound with his tears as the lily with dew.
The old harpstrings quaver, the old voice is shak-
Ing,
In sighs and in sobs moans the yearning refrain,
The old vision dims and the old heart is breakingâ
Kathleen Mavourneen, inspire U3 again 1
A VERY PRETTY WAIST.
. The long shoulder seems of the 1830 period
have had a decided effect on the modes of this
season. One of the most charming models is
shown here. ' The effect is best when two
materials are usedâ for the sleeves and the
under-waist, another for the body. Or the
sleeves may be of the goods like the body if
preferred, using contrasting goods only for the
under-body, which is visible at the top in V
shape both back and front. If one fabric is
used, braiding, embroidering or a design done
in braids, spangles, or both, is rich and effec
tive. A very rich- waist of royal blue velvet,
to be worn with a blue crepon skirt, was made
in this way. The embroidery was in multi
colors, the design being field flowers. A waist
of green cloth, on the mignonette shade, had
sleeves and under-waist of a rich China silk to
match.- An edge of sable finished the edges of
the cloth body. A ruff of green ribbon four
inches wide was gathered into the top of the
collar, in a novel and extremely stylish way.
A waist to be worn with a black satin skirt
had sleeves and V of the black satin, the body
of ox-blood red cloth. This was edged with
Persian lamb fur, and \ was well covered by
small black spangles sewn on irregularly all
over the surface. A ribbon of black and red
stripes was used in the same way, as shown in
the illustration, over a black satin collar.
A brown crepon dress had a plain skirt, the
waist being entirely of crepon, excepting the
Vs, and these were of blue velvet. The trim
ming on the edges of the crepon was sable. â¢
Another home dress had Vs of black satin,
with a fancy braiding on the upper edges of
the cloth bodice. ...^ . - -

MUSIC \ AND , MUSICIANS.
The Italian papers are publishing some in
teresting particulars respecting Leoncavallo's
newly produced opera, "Chatterton." It was
the first work written by its author, having
been composed before "I Pagliacci" and "I
Medici." At that epoch the young musician,
as well as being completely unknown, was far
from finding himself in a flourishing financial
condition. Having no hope of meeting with
an impresario willing to produce his opera he
sought out a music publisher at Bologna
named Trebbi and offered him the score for
little more than the price of a few meals.
Trebbi was intelligent and honest. Seeing
that the composer was pressed by want he re
fused to take advantage of the situation, but
on the contrary aided Leoncavallo as much as
possible and kept the opera till a good oppor
tunity should present itself for having it per
formed. The opportunity did not come, how-
ever. Trebbi died, and the composer, forgot
bis work. Tedeschi, the successor to Trebbi,
happened to find the score and remembering
the success of "I Pagliacci" and "I Medici" he
thought it only fair that the public should
hear "Chatterton." Leoncavallo was begged
to revise the work, and, as already stated in
Ths Call, it was recently presented to the
critical Roman public with immense success
at the National Theater.
Everything comes to him who knows how to
wait. There is Mozart, who died before Haydn,
Schubert or Beethoven, yet these composers
have for a long time had their statues in the
good town of Vienna, while Mozart has had to
content himself, with a little, insignificant
monument, placed in the house which he in
habited on the Rauhensteingasse, which, since
its reconstruction, has borne his name. At
last it has been decided - to inaugurate, at
Vienna, a monument worthy of the great mas
ter, and it is the j Emperor Francis Joseph who
will preside in person at the ceremony, which
is to take place at the end of the present
month. The hofkapellmeister of Joseph 11
will thus receive a posthumous honor of which'
no other Austrian musician can boast, for even
at the inauguration of Beethoven's monument
the Emperor did not assist in person. After
the unveiling the Imperial Opera, for three
consecutive nights, will play "The Marriage of
Figaro," "Don Juan" and "The Magic Flute,"
and the Vienna Conservatory will give a grand
popular concert, devoted exclusively to
Mozart's works. The monument will be placed !
just outside the Imperial Opera-house.
Le Menestrel says : "We have already told
how the dean of militant pianists, Antone de
Kontski, left his home in Buffalo to take a
concert tour of the world. We now learn from
the Singapore Free Press that De Kontski has
been giving concerts at Singapore, and has
astonished every one by his vigorous and bril
liant playing and his marvelous memory..
Nothing betrayed that the pianist was an
octogenarian, even when he played the sonatas
of Beethoven by heart. The old man won a
marvelous success, and at the end of each con
cert he was obliged to play his celebrated
piece, 'The Awakening of the Lion,' as well us
his charming 'Pompadour Gavotte.' Our
Singapore contemporary states that De
Kontski is going to India, after which he will
visit Siberia and will tour in Russia and other
European countries. De Kontski, the con
temporary of Beethoven, Field, Mendelssohn,
Chopin, Thalburg and of Liszt, playing In
Paris in 1897 would be an apparition of no
mean interest.
People are just beginning to realize how
much Eduard Grieg owes his wile for making
his songs known to the public. If some day it
should come to De universally recognized that
by the side of the two long-honored kings of
song, Schubert and Schumann, Grieg, too, is
entitled to a throne, to Mrs. Grieg will be
largely due the honor of having hastened the
advent of his recognition. Nothing is easier
than to criticize her singing. Even in its best
days her voice must have been of a somewhat
uneven quality, lacking in smoothness and
sweetness, as in thorough training, yet no

singing seems to make a greater impression on
the hearers. j A hysterical actress used to say
of a certain scene in a drama where the hero
ine goes mad: "All the other actresses tear
their hair, but J tear my soul." - Mrs. Grieg is
anything but hysterical, but of her it might
with truth be said that she sings with her soul.
j lt appears that the political administration
of Crispi has left the Italian Government very
little surplus money for the encouragement of
the fine arts. A communication made to the
press by the Minister of the Interior shows a
strong/ desire to save in that direction. The
Minister announces a Government competition
for a requiem mass, to He executed at Turin on
the 7 2& th of next July, to celebrate the anni
versary of. King Carlo Alberto's death. The
last paragraph runs: 'Tor the said mass the
Minister offers a prize of 900 francs, leaving to
the composer all the cost of performing it, both
in duplicating the orchestral and vocal scores
and in securing executants." That is to say,
for a prize of 900 francs expenses to the ex
tent of several thousand francs will be imposed
on the successful composer.
Mancinelli is just putting the finishing
touches to an opera entitled "Hero and Lean
der," for which the well-known poet, Arrigo
Boito, has written the libretto. The work will
first be played at the coming Norwich festival,
and afterward it will be seen at Coveut Garden
Theater, London, during the season of 1897.
At Norwich Mme. Albani and the tenor, Ed

Emile Saver, one of the few pianists who can
in any way hold his own against Paderewski,
has discovered a novel way of stilling the en
core fiend. Saver believes that when people
ask too much they should be taught a lesson
by receiving encore pieces of such intermin
able lengths that they will have time during
the performance to repent of their greed. It is
said that if other performers would follow his
example the encore would soon become a thing
of the past.

half a hundred men have made up their
minds to tempt fortune in the far north,
and the work of getting quarters ready for j
them is rapidly progressing. As the j
schooner was formerly used as a sealer,

The barkentine Archer arrived from
Honolulu yesterday with her foretopmast
gone. She was short-handed, and the
men had so much to do during the passage
that they all deserted assoonasthe'anchor
was dropped. There were only three men
iv each watch, and as one of the trio was
at the wheel the vessel had to be thrown
up into the wind whenever sail had to be
made or shortened.
Leaving Honolulu the Archer ran into
a head sea and a gale of wind. Before
anything could be done the foretopmast
snapped off and the forecastle and cabin
were flooded. There were two passengers,
Miss Eva Elliot and I. F. Thrum. The
latter was very seasick, and was washed
out of his berth and nearly drowned. Miss
Elliot was a good sailor, and stood the
blow out with Captain Calhoun on the
quarterdeck.

The question of raising the Blairmore is
still in abeyance, lt is generally under
stood that the successful bidder is not at
all anxious to take the job of raising the
sunken vessel, and Lloyd's agents are just,
as far from reaching a decision as they
were on Tuesday. Captain Hawkins, one
of the owners of the sunken ship, is now
on his way here from England, and the
chances are that nothing will be done
until his arrival. In that event the wreck
will be sold as it lies, and the highest bid
der will have to take all the risks entailed
in raising it. This is the course favored
by the underwriters, and it will probably
be followed.

How Retail Fruit-Dealers Intend to Pro-
toct Their Interestsâ No Pay
No Fruit.
People who habitually neglect the little

This decision has just been taken by a
new organization known as "La Societe di

secretary, who will . see that collecting
agents visit the delinquents and try to col

If payment is refused the debtors will be

SHARKEY AND CHOYNSKI
Heavy-Weight Pugilists Who
Will Box Eight Rounds
This Evening.
To Win the Long End of the Purse
Choynski Must Stop His '
i Opponent.
The great fistic controversy between Joe
Choynski and Tom Sharkey will be de
cided this evening at the People's Palace.
The betting on the contest was very
spirited last evening. Choynski was a
strong favorite when the pools opened at
2 to 1, but before the wagering was brought
to a conclusion the supporters of Sharkey
appeared to be quite numerous in the bet
ting ring and the pools closed with
Choynski a favorite at slight odds.
Sharkey is resting now and will be in
magnificent condition this evening when
he will toe the scratch a.ainst his formid
able opponent. He has very little to say
regarding his chances against Choynski.
but there can be no gainsaying that he has
great confidence in his ability to stand off
the man who made such a game battle
against Goddard, "the Barrier champion,"
and other noted pugilists whom Choynski
as met in the past five years.
"I know that there are many people of
sporting proclivities who actually believe
that 1 will prove a chopping-block for
Choynski," said Sharkey, when asked
what he thought his chances of success
would amount to against California Joe.
"I know that those wise men who think
that I am not a fit subject to meet a good
second-class man put their money on Sul
livan when he met Corbett, and squealed
like pigs when they lost. They said the
same of Corbett as they say of me now, but
I think they will be fooled again. I
whipped every man I met so far, and I
think my chances of keeping Choynski
guessing lor eight rounds are good.
"I do not pretend to say that I can whip
Choynski, but I have all the confidence in
the world of fooling a whole lot of those
fellows who think that I am the Kind of a
man that Choynski can do with as he
pleases. After ths right is over there will be
many know-it-ail sports who will have
good reason to cuss their luck for betting
against Sailor Shark."
Choynski cannot venture an opinion as
to what the result of his contract with
Sharkey will amount to.
"I have never seen my next opponent
box," said Joe, "therefore I cannot pre
sume anything. My manager, Parson
Davies, informs me that Sharkey is a
dangerous man; that he is as strong as a
carthorse and unquestionably game. I
put him up as being a second Goddard,
but on a smaller scale.
"If he can stand the same kind of pun
ishment that I gave the Australian he will
surprise me very much indeed, but I will
fight Sharkey on different lines, as I have
a contract on hand to stop him in eight
rounds or less. yfyj
"Of course I expect to stop him. If he is
unguarded in his attack and gives me an
opening I think I can take advantage of a
shot at a bullseye. You can rest assured
of one fact, and it is this, that I will not
leave an opportunity pass if 1 can help it.
I expect to win because there is nothing in
it for me to lose, and that's all I can say to
you on the subject."
Fighting Over Property.
Charles L. James and Anna F. Ingler are su
ing for possession of some property held by Isa
belle A. Rogers. Henry Dayton Rogers, ;the
defendant's husbaud.willed the property to the
plaintiffs, but he had previously deeded it to the

STEVENSON MONUMENT
New Design by the Guild of
Arts and Crafts Is
Presented.
SIMPLE PEDESTAL OF MARBLE.
â _.
The Money for Its Erection Nearly
All Subscribedâ Supervisors
Must Be Consulted. ly : y
The committee chosen by the Guild of
Arts and Craftsâ Mrs. Virgil Williams,
Horace Piatt and Bruce Porterâ design a
monument to Robert Louis Stevenson for
the Plaza, concluded last night in favor of
a simple pedestal surmounted by a ship.
Recently the committee submitted vari
ous designs to the Supervisors for ap
proval, and they were rejected for various
reasons. Since then the designers have
been working on something new. All
through the proposition to retain the ship |
idea was respected, and so there is a i
bronze vessel, conventionalized, of course, i
as a dominant feature of the monument.
The scheme is for a simple classic pedes
tal rising from the plainest kind of a
molded base that is set upon broad flags,
without any special basin for water from
the drinking fountain.
There is a bold, substantial plinth large
enough to afford space for the whole of
the central quotation from the Christmas
sermon, often quoted in connection with
this monument.* Near the baseline of the
plinth is a spigot with bronze dolphins
forming a I owl beneath, where the thirsty
may find water to drink while reading the
sympathetic quaint words of Stevenson.
The bronze ship rests on dolphins, fash
ioned to serve as consols and lending a
picturesque character to the monument.
This ship, of course, presents in a pecu
liarly appropriate way the character of the
The New Design for a Stevenson Monument Proposed by the Arts and Crafts
Committee.
novelist's work, its adventure, and, in a
large measure, suggests much of the man's
own life.
The monument is intended to be twelve
feet high from the ground to the top of
the bronze masts, and the proportions
have been carefully considered, so that this
simple pedestal reverts to the original idea
of a shaft.
It is intended to use Californian marble
of a light color, and to have the ship in
green bronze with gilded sails.
The cost has been estimated at $1000, and
only $300 is needed to complete that
amount. The Guild of Arts and Crafts is
satisfied that the balance will be con
tributed : immediately, and it finds new
satisfaction in knowing that James D.
Phelan has interested himself in the
monument and promised to support the
efforts of the committee, in having it
erected. ' â -" '~ -~ â¢

PAGE IS CONVICTED.
The Jury in the Case of the Kx-DiÂ»trict
Attorney Returns a Verdict In
Forty-Five Minutes.
The trial of James D. Page, the ex-Dis
trict Attorney charged with embezzling
$4000 from thÂ« estate of Louis Lichneker,
his insane ward, was given to the jury last
evening who in forty-five minutes returned
a verdict of guilty.
The case opened and closed during the
morning. Ex- Judge Levy was called to
testify to having appointed Page guardian
of Lichneker's estate.and Judge Slack told
how he discharged him for not obeying
citations to show where the missing money
was. Detective Anthony told how he
brought the fleeing attorney from New
York, and then the citations of the courts
ware read to the jury. This closed the
prosecution.
Counsel for the defense moved for a dis
missal. This was not granted, and the de
fense closed without testimony. The case
was argued during the afternoon, the con
tention of the defense being that no one
authorized to do so demanded the $4000,
consequently it was not embezzlement.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Last Performances of "Pudd'n

Columbia Theater.
Richard Mansfield Meets With the
Reward of M rit at the
Ealcwin.
Richard Mansfield's finished impersona
tion of the title role in "Beau Brummell"
is giving pleasure to large houses at the
Baldwin Theater, "Beau Brummell" will
be presented during the remainder of this
week. Next Monday night Mansfield will
inaugurate the second week of his engage
ment with the first production in this City
of his new play, "The Story of Rodion,
the Student."
The California Theater is still enjoying a
prosperous season with Peter F. Dai ley
and his very amusing farce, "The Night
Clerk." The last performance of the piece
will be given on Sunday night.
Roland Reed brings his new comedy to
the California Theater next Monday night.
The piece is a satire and is called "The
Politician." It is the joint work of the
late David D. Lloyd and Sydney Rosen
feld.
To-morrow night an unusually large
house is expected, as it will be the occasion
of the benefit tendered Manager E. Rosen
baura by Rich & Harris and Peter F.
Daileây. A programme has been arranged
which includes, as well as the regular per
formance of "The Night Clerk." a charac
ter specialty by Charies E. Eldridge; also
acts by Tom McGrath, the Nawns, the
twin brothers, George and Charles Wiener,
and others.
There is no falling off in the size of the
houses at "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the
Columbia Theater. Frank Mayo's fin
ished impersonation of the title role is one
of the best things ever seen at the pretty
little Powell-street theater, and quite de
serves the popular reception it has re
ceived.
"A Pair of Kids" opens at the Columbia
Theater on Monday night.
"Michael Strogoff" is drawing well at
the Grand. The performance is an un
usually good one, and the scenic attrac

CARPENTERS ON A STRIKE
Eight Union Men Leave the
First and Market Streets
Job.
They Positively Refuse to Work With
P. N. Kuss' Non-Union
Painters.
The carpenters at work on the big build
ing on Market and First streets went out
on a strike yf sterday morning rather than
work on a job with non-union men. The
objectionable workmen were a lot of
P. N. Kuss' painters. The union men are
determined to maintain and uphold the
working-card adopted by the affiliated
unions, and they were prepared to strike
as soon as Kuss' painters went to work
rather than violate their obligations.
William Grant, the contractor, has been \
particularly unfortunate with this piecj \
of work. He made the contract some time
before April 1, when the card system went
into effect. He sublet the lathing contract
to a man who used non-union lathers, and
the council declared it to be an unfair job
This was without any prejudice against
Grant, who is recognized as one of the
best friends the union possesses. In time
the lathers got away and the job was
unionized at once by the contractor.
It was understood that there would be
trouble .again because Grant had let the
painting contract to Kuss long before the
Ist of April, and before the painters'
strike, when Kuss came out openly ana
declared that he would conduct a non
union shop. When the painters went to
work yesterday morning Grant was pow
erless to prevent trouble, because lie had
already let the contract, from which Kuss
would not release him.
When the union contractors objected to
the presence of the non-union gang he ex
plained the situation to them and said he
was sorry to see them go, and that if he
had been able to prevent the trouble he
would have done so. The best of feeling
exists between the union men and Con
tractor Grant. There still remains con
siderable work to be done by carpenters on
the building, and eight men could find
employment therein for at least three
weeks. An upper story and a large hall
way remain to be finished.
It is probable that Contractor Grant will
be obliged to put on a new lot of non
union men to finish the work on time,
much as be regrets to do so.
The carpenters are making active prepa
rations for their picnic, which will be held
at Sunset Park on the 26tn inst. Among
the features will be a tug-of-war contest
for a prize. The heavy-weights of union
483 have b?en selected, with R. W. Smith,
the heaviest man in the union, as anchor
man. This team will compete with a
team picked from unions 22, 304 and the
amalgamated union. The former team
will meet at 115 Turk street this evening,
and make arrangements to go into train
ing.
The painters' picnic will be held at the
same park on May 17. A large attendance
is expected, as there will be a number of
striking novelties introduced.
Librarian Thoma Will Retire.
J. G. Thorns, one of the most popular of the
attaches of the German' Hospital, will retire
from his position as librarian and sever his
connection with the hospital May 1. His long
and confining service had the effect of break
ing down his health, and a change of scene
and an occupation less confining was necessary.
At a meeting of the hospital committee of the
German General Benevolent Society, held on
the Oth, Superintendent Brown spoke of Mr.
Thomas resignation and expressed great re
gret, as his services were deemed almost in
valuable. Thomas position as guard and
librarian brought him into contact with all
who came to the hospital, and his cheering
words and kindly manner made him a general
favorite.

Case.

â¢ ."-v."" â â â¢â â  Private Talk.
Still achieving, still pursuing, Attorney
Hayne keeps on arguing in the Southern
Pacific case before Judge McKenna of the
United States Circuit Court. He shows no
sign of weakening or tiring, and will prob
ably not conclude before the end of the
week, if indeed then. Yesterday he read
an extract from the late Senator Stanford's
testimony in relation to the combination
between the Central Pacific Railway and
the Southern Pacific Company. The testi
mony was to the effect that the combina
tion had "all the advantages of a pooling
contract," and that its main or rather its
only purpose was the staving off of any
thing like competition between the two
roads. \
"Are we children," asked Mr. Hayne,
"that we should now believe this combine
to be a simple lease when the president of
the company testifies under oath that it is
not?"
The case of the San Diego Water Com
pany against the San Diego Flume Com
pany was cited to show that a merely par
tial restraint of business competition may
be permitted, in case that the combination
whereby the restraint is brought about be
not formed for the purpose of unduly in
creasing rates paid by the public for a
commodity or privilege of a public nature.
The decision, he contended, was not ap
plicable to the case at bar, and should not
have been cited by the counsel on the
other side. The present case, he said,
deait with a combination, not, as in the
San Diego case, to furnish water or any
thing else to one city, but to control the
entire railway traffic of an entire State.
"I believe!" interposed Mr. Pillsbury,
"that there are about twenty railways in
the State which are not owned. by the
Southern Pacific Company."
"Yes," rejoined Mr. Hayne, wheeling
about and facing his interlocutor, "and
fine railways they are, aren't they? Per
haps you refer to lines like the' Marin
County affair; and then some sawmills
have railroads of their own. But these
are not worth mentioning or taking into
account in this case. If they were the
Southern Pacific Company would have
.wallowed them up long ago.
- "Now, as to unlawful combinations," re
sumed the eloquent barrister, taking leave
of Mr. Pillsbury with a crushing glance.
"A combination may be unlawful either
by reason of its purpose or by reason of
the means which it employs to achieve a
purpose in itself lawful. The Southern
Pacific Company, by a mere agreement
among its head officers, has no right to set
itself up before the public as the manag
ing board of a hospital, of a church or of
anything else than a transportation com
pany." ; V
"Couldn't it run a cemetery?" inquired
Mr. Pillsbury.
"I concede that point," answered Mr.
Hayne. "The railroad kills a great man
people, and there would seem to be a cer
tain propriety in" its having a place to put
them after it had finished them.
"Now, returning to the matter of un
lawful combinations between corporations,
I contend that the testimony in this case
and the decisions which I have cited form
a mine of facts from which we are forced
to deduce that the combine between the
Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific is
unlawful in its ends and purposes and ut
terly unlawful in its methods.
"As to the California business of the
company, it is not rash to state that the
Caliiornia traffic yields the railway fully
80 per cent of its annual earnings, the
transcontinental traffic bringing in a very
slim .0 per cent. Now the railway folks
say that the transcontinental traffic does
not pay to any appreciable extent, and in
many Stages it does not pay at all. Hence
they essay to raise rates in this State in
order to recompense themselves for loss
incurred in other parts of the country.
This is a most unjust and iniquitous at
tempt. If California is to be responsible
for the expenses of traffic in other States,
then she ought to be able to have some
thing to say .boat the matter. Otherwise
one State would have the right to pay its
debts and discharge its obligations by put
ting its hands into the pocket of its neigh
bor. If the company wished to build a
road to Alaska, surely we in California
ought not to be obliged to pay its ex
penses."
"I would like to ask," intemosed Judge
McKenna, "what would . become â¢of Cali
fornia if she did not share in the expenses
of the transcontinental railway. If the
through line were discontinued our .State
would be isolated from the remainder of
the Union. The railway is not altogether
a State affair, since it passes through a
number 'of States. May it not be consid
ered as a whole and t its rates calculated
from the earnings of the entire system?"
"If that principle were recognized,"
answered Mr. Hayne, "where would it
take us?"
"ft is I who am asking the question,"
said the Juuge. "We have to decide this
case in accord with the principles of law.
I only ask how you think an interstate
railway can be operated unless its rates be
calculated upon the earnings of the whole
system? Could it pay its expenses? Could
it be run at all?"
' 'There are too many railways now," re
joined Mr. Hayne. "A railway should
not be built unless it ' can pay on the
places through which it is to pass. One
State ought not to pay the railway fares of
another."
A long discussion between his Honor
and the mercurial barrister ensued,
wherein each displayed a strong desire to
find out what the other was driving at,
but the effort on both sides met with only
indifferent success. Mr. Hayne read a
Jong extract from an opinion of Justice
Deady, contained in " the Twenty-third
.Federal" Reporter; which he contended
had a direct bearing upon the case before
the court. A compromise between him
self and the Judge was at length . effected,
neither side yielding a point, and his
Honor promising to read the decision
quoted and find out for himself what it
really decided.
Mr. Hayne concluded by saying that it
would not be right to go out of the State
in order to calculate local rates for Cali
fornia. However, in case external busi
ness were taken into account in estimating
rates charged in California, the entire out
side earnings would have to be taken into
consideration. The steamship lines, leased
and otherwise, the Mexican Central Rail
way and all the other paying ventures of
the Southern Pacific Company should at
least aid California in bearing the burden
of recompensing the company for losses
incurred in non-productive sections of
country.
The argument here rested for the day.
The Judge summoned Messrs. Hayno and
Garber to the bench, and Biter a brief
whispered conversation announced that in
questioning Mr. Hayne he had not in
tended to cast any' reflection upon the
propriety of thft attorney's position, but
only to ask f'^'information as to certain
specific points touched upon. Nobody
seemed willing after the adjournment to
say what the little talk dealt with, Mr.
Hayne, in answer to a question, saying,
"Oh, it was only a small private affair
between the Judge and myself."
CHANCE FOR MARSHALL. !
Another Murderer Respited From the
Rope by the Supreme
Court.
Charles Marshall, who was convicted
and sentenced to death for the murder of
Frank Hamilton, has been granted a new
trial by the Supreme Court.
Marshall was convicted of killing Frank
Hamilton in Riverside on April 8, 1895-
In instructing the jury the trial court said
that when the killing was proved it rested
with the defendant to show any cir
cumstance in mitigation to excuse or
justifyâ that is, the killing being proved,
it rested with the defense to make out a
case in mitigation. This was afterward
qualified by the instruction that at all
times the burden of proof rested on the
people.
The Attorney-General admitted that the
instruction wa? erroneous, but pleaded
that the people's case was so conclusive as
to rob the instruction of any harm it
might otherwise have done the defendant,
also that the general instruction on the
burden of proof relieved the first error.'
The Supreme Court holds differently, how
ever, and the order denying a new trial is
reversed.
To give contradictory instructions, the
court says, is to commit error, and it is
almost always impossible to say whether
the jury has the erroneous instruction or
the correct one.
MENACE TO DRIED FRUITS
Growers of the Northwest De
plore Indiscriminate
Shipments.
Say Fruits Are Thrown on the Mar
ket at Prices Ruinous to Ship
pers and Dealers.
Secretary Lelong of the State Board of
Horticulture received yesterday a letter
from a prominent firm of St. Paul, which
inclosed a protest from the Northwestern
Grocers' Association against the indis
criminate selling of dried fruit to unquali
fied agents of that section of the country.
The letter explaining the protest states
that the jobbers of that association dis
tribute upward of 1000 cars of dried fruits
a year and are the legitimate buyers of
dried fruits and canned goods from Cali
fornia, and they forward the protest be
cause some growers and shippers send
from this State goods to people who can
not handle them intelligently, thereby
rendering the business of buying dried
fruits hazardous.
.Â« . * V.J ....... _WU.. .......
The protest reads as follows:
St. Paul, Minn., April 11, 1896.
To the Fruit- Growers and Dried Fruit Dealers
of Californiaâ Gentlemen: This association,
representing as it docs all the wholesale gro
cers doing business in the great Northwest,!
protests against the present demoralized con
dition of the dried fruit market, growing out
of the indiscriminate shipments of dried fruits
by the fruit-growers of your State to the farm
produce and green fruit dealers in this section
of the country.
The principal effect of this is that such ship
ments are thrown on this market by such farm
produce and green fruit dealers at prices ruin
ous to both the original shippers and to the
legitimate dealers in dried fruits, and such
shipments are sold without regard to their
value at whatever prices may be offered for
them. The goods are used as baits to increase
the sale of oranges, lemons and farm produce,
and the principal object sought to be gained is
the commission to be earned, without proper
regard to the interests of the shipper. Such
sales establish a fictitious price and depreciate
the real value of every pound of like goods
which we may be at that time carrying in
stock. Our market is thus kept in* uncer
tainty and . legitimate handling of such goods
is made unsatisfactory and hazardous.
We feel that the interests of the California
fruit-growers, the legitimate handlers of dried
fruits in California and the jobbers in grocer
ies (which Include dried fruits) in this market
are identical, and none of them are benefited
I by the slaughtering of goods in the manner

"There has been no concerted action on
the part of many growers in shipping
fruit," said Mr. Lelong, "and | these ship
ments mentioned by the protest are from
people outside the numerous exchanges
and associations throughout the State. In
fact, in some instances, they are working
directly in opposition to the exchanges.
The importance of such protective organi

THE SAN FRAS CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1890.
THE PRESBYTERY AT WORK
A Prosperous Field Laid Out for
Rev. R. W. Reynolds in
the Park Station.
SOME ENCOURAGING REPORTS.
An Amendment to the Church Rules
by Which None but Members in
Good Standing May Vote.
The session of the presbytery was held
in the parlors of Calvary. Presbyterian
Church yesterday, the Rev. F. R. Farrand,
moderator, in the chair.
Tbe labors of the brethren were princi
pally devoted to receiving the report of
REV. R. W. REYNOLDS OF HOLLY PARK PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
standing committees and recommending
to the General Assembly certain amend
ments to the church and session char
acter. Among the principal changes'sug
gested is one by which only church mem
bers in good standing shail oe entitled to
vote for a minister. Heretofore every
member whose name appeared on the roll
of membership could come in nt an elec
tion for a new minister irrespective of his
standine in the church.
The Richmond district was added to the
Holly Park ministry, to which charge the
energetic young minister, R.W. Reynolds,
has just been assigned, as a home mission
district.
The debatable question over the French
and Italian home missions, in which there
seems to be some misunderstanding be
tween two of the leading congregations,
did not come up for discussion, as was an
ticipated.
The reports of the various committees
as presented to the presbytery shows the
church under its jurisdiction to be in a
healthy and prosperous condition. The
increase in members and finance was re
ported to be more than encouraging, as
compared to previous sessions. This, with
J. K. Inazawa and J. Okuno, Who Were Ordained Presbyterian -Ministers by the
San Francisco Presbytery.
the large class of students in theological
seminaries under the jurisdiction of this
presbytery, who are expected to receive or
dination in the near future, gives renewed
encouragement to Presbyterianism on this
coast. 7 77
Prominent among those present were
Rev. J. K. Inazawa and Rev. J. Okuno,
who were ordained the previous day.
TWO HOMELESS INFANTS
One Babe Only a Few Days Old
Abandoned in the Bitter
Cold.
The Child Found in a Hand-Satchel
Monday Dies at the Orphan
Asylum.
Another abandoned baby has found a
home in Mount St. Joseph's Orphan Asy
lam. This time it is a baby girl, well
developed and healthy. -7
Mrs. Stewart of 16Â»_ Oak Grove avenue,
a small street running from Harrison to
Bryant, between Fifth and Sixth, opened
her front door about 6:30 o'clock yesterday
morning to go on an errand, when she
nearly stepped upon a baby which was
lying on her front step nude and exposed
to â¢ the bitter cold weather. There was
a piece of flour sack under the infant, but
there had been no attempt to cover the
body with it.
The child was blue from the cold. Mrs.
Stewart tooK it inside and placed it in a
warm oven. Then she bathed it in warm
water and wrapped it in flannel.
After doing all that was possible for the
little one. Mrs. Stewart notified Policeman
O'Connell, who summoned the patrol
wagon. The baby was placed in a fruit
box and taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where it met with a motherly reception
from Matron Kane. A few hours later it
.was sent to the orphan asylum in the
ambulance.
Dr. Weil expressed the opinion that the
baby had not been born more than twenty
four hours before it was discovered by
Mrs. Stewart. .
Policeman O'Connell has been detailed
to find if possible the inhuman parents of
the infant, and he will be assisted by the
officers of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children.
The boy baby found in a satchel in the
vacant lot on Twelfth street Monday morn
ing died at the orphan asylum yesterday
.afternoon. Every effort is being made by
the police to trace the parents of the boy,
and Captain Lees said yesterday that he
was not without hope of finding them
soon.
OUR APRIL ALL.
Weather Clerk Hammon Assures the
Drenched Unfortunates That It
Was "Purely Local."
The dark clouds that gathered over
head so suddenly yesterday afternoon in
a sky that but a few minutes before seemed
unalloyed blue were "purely local" accord
ing to the words of Weather Clerk Ham
mon. ' 'yMy.
"While the rain and hail were pouring
down over the City," said Mr. Hammon,
"the sun was shining on the bay and
across the straits.'' There was nothing
particularly remarkable about its sudden
ness. It was simply an April squall, but
the precipitation of hail is very unusual.
This hail came down from the higher
layers of air, and those layers of cold are
not so very high cither; you would not be
obliged to ascend many feet above the top
of the Mills building'to find the freezing
point. There i. snow on the mountains in
many parts of the State. During the last
thirty-six hours there has been a general
cooling of the air west of the Rocky Moun
tains.
"The air is heavily charged with mois
ture, and it is owing to this fact that so
few heavy frosts have been reported. The
conditions are the same as during the first
part of March.
"I got a special at 2 o'clock this after
noon from several stations in the interior
saying if the clear sky continued there
would be severe frosts in those localities.
"At Suisun last night had the weather !
remained clear two hours longer than it
did considerable damage would have been
done. But it clouded up and the danger
was averted. lam inclined to think the
extended dancer will be very small. The j
cold snaps will occur only in spots. No, !
the climate of California will, I think j
never lose its genial and almost continual
warmth. These little squalls and snaps
are only accidents, as it were."
ALEXANDER BOYD'S WILL.
He Leave* a 870,000 Estate to His
Widow.
The will of Alexander P. Boyd, dispos
ing of an estate valued at $70,000, has been
filed in the Probate Court. The petition
for its probate is directed to Judge Slack,
and it sets forth that the estate consists of
land in San Benito County valued at $6000,
some small lots in San Francisco, a twenty
foot lot on Third street valued at $10,000,
some land in Santa Clara County, notes
and mortgages to the amount of $42,000
and shares of stock in various companies.
Th? entire estate is left to the widow by
the following will: ji7y
I. Alex P. Boyd, do make and publish this,
my last will and testament, thereby revoking
all former wills by me made. I bequeath all
my property, real and personal, wherever the
same may be, to my beloved wife, Mattie Boyd.
I appoint my said wife the executrix of this,
my last will and testament. My will is that
my said wife shall not be required to give any
bonds or security to the Judge of Probate for
the faithful execution of the duties of the ex
ecutrix.
I have hereunto set my hand and seal this
sixth day of May, eighteen hundred and
eighty-two (1882). Alex P. Boyd.
He leaves a widow and a daughter, Miss
Grace Boyd, who live at 1919 Devisadero
street.
To Discuss Irrigation.
A large number of horticulturists and vitl.
culturists in the northern part of this State
have arrived at the conclusion that while
fruits, grapes, cereals and other products grow
well without water, they will do hetter with
irrigation. That fruits especially attain a
larger size and a better flavor and make finer
preserves where irrigation is pursued has been
repeatedly demonstrated. Furthermore, there
is hardly a valley or plain in this section of
the State but what can be watered at very lit
tle cost. .This mutter has been looked into ex
tensively by a large number of people who are
interested in the subject, and on next Tuesday
afternoon "Irrigation in Northern California"
will be exhaustively discussed at a meeting of
the California State Board of Trade, at 16 Post
street. B. M. Lelong, F. Maslin, N. B. Chipman
and others will read interesting papers upon
the subject. : . ; -, Â«yiy,,y

WHEN LAWYERS AGREE
Counsel in the Martin Case Con
cur in Closing the Trial
Tc-Day.
EVIDENCE THAT WAS BARRED.
The Railroad Amends Its Answer as to
Simple Negligenceâ What a
Boy Thought.
The Martin case will, by mutual under- [
standing between the counselâ the first }
understanding that they have come to in ,
all the two weeks of the trialâ be brought ;
to a close to-day so far as the taking of
testimony ,is concerned. The â¢ case will
then go over until Monday, when the argu
ments of counsel will be made.
Yesterday the interest wabbled some,
and at no time was superinductive of pal
pitation of the heart among auditors. As
many of these crowded . the courtroom all
the day as at any time during the trial.
The morning was devoted to medical
testimony. A number of physicians testi
fied as to locomotor ataxia, the complaint
which the plaintiff was suffering from at
the time he was put off the train, and
which, through the rough handling to
which he was subjected at that time, he
claims to have been aggravated and ren
dered incurable. â¢
A good deal of skirmishing between
counsel was occasioned by the character
of this testimony or the character of that
sought to be secured from the doctors.
.General Barnes, for the railroad, inter
rupted the proceedings to amend his an
swer, charging negligence on the part of
the plaintiffâ not contributory, but simple
negligence, in not having properly iden
tified himself to the conductor when he
might have done so.
Delmas objected. He said it was rather
late in the proceedings to introduce new
elements. This was a complete shifting
of the attitude of the defense.
"The defendants," he said, "have an
swered our complaint with ten pages of
type-written matter, in which they set up
that the plaintiff was playing a game upon
them ; that he deliberately planned a fraud
and a deception and ' declared their ability
to prove it. We confronted this without
fear. Now they propose to change base.
They wish to hold that if the plaintiff was
guilty of negligence he is not entitled to
damages. Hitherto they have admitted if
the company made a mistake they were
liable."
The court said it could not see that any
burden was added to the plaintiff by the
move it was simply taking the view of
the court that negligence should bean
element in the case.
"Is that the court's view of it?" inquired
j Delmas. "The two propositions are as
| widely separated as the shores of the
i ocean. Certainly the defendants had no
I thought that there was such a pos>ible
view to be taken under tbe law. They
have taken the suggestion from the court."
"It does not matter where the sugges
tion came from," said Judge Daingerfield.
"It was made some time ago, and both
j sides had the benefit of it. As I say, it
i adds no new burden on the plaintiff, and
| I will allow the offer."
This settled the most strongly disputed
â¢ point of the day.
In the afternoon several ticket-scalpers
, were heard. One of them testified that
! Martin had visited him and offered to sell
; his ticket, or at least asked what would be
given for it.
A Pinkerton detective named Morrison,
â  from Sioux City, was called to show that
the plaintiff was not only in the commis-
I sion business there, but that he "ran" the
' Bijou Theater, a place where drinks were
1 sold and where there were "women box
: workers." This line oi inquiry was shut
off under objection.
Then there was a good deal of inquiry
i about a woman named Rogers, but she was
j not brought definitely into the case, as the
i objections were sustained.
Then a youne man named Hathaway
i undertook to explain on the stand that an
affidavit had been filed by the plaintiff re
cently during a real estate transaction de
claring that he (Martin) was not now and
never had been married, despite the fact
that he had declared on the stand that he
was and is married. r Â»7 7
Delmas said he was perfectly willing to
meet this evidence if it came properly be
fore the court, but the memory or hearsay
of this boy was not the thing.
General Barnes said a certified copy of
the affidavit was in tbe mail and on the
way. It would arrive to-morrow. It was
decided not to admit the testimony. If
the affidavit arrived in time it would be
considered.
Ail these witnesses were sharply cross
questioned as to how they came to be wit
nesses here and the fact was developed that
they were supplied with passes by the
order or William A. Pinkerton of Chicago.
The last-named witness hart brought his
wife along on such a pass, The detective
had been supplied with funds for his ex
penses. The others paid their own ex
penses, they said.
To-day the defense will close with the
evidence of the brakemen on the tram, and
the plaintiff will put in his rebuttal.

______
A REMARKABLE DEFICIT.
It Is Shown in the Statement of
the Operations of the
Pacific System.
PERTINENT FIGURES COMPARED
Those of Last Year Show a Difference
in Net Results of More Than
Fcur Million Dollars.
Comparison of the official figures of the
operations of the Pacific system of the
Southern Pacific Company for the years
ending June 30, 1594. and June 30,1895,
respectively, shows a difference in net re
sults of more than $4,000,000 in favor of
the earlier period. For 1893-94 there was
a net surplus of $3,804,445 36, while for
18944)5 there was a net deficit of $276,202 70.
In view of the desperate efforts of C. P.
Huntington to secure the passage by Con
gress of a bill re-funding the debt of the
Central Pacilic Railroad Company to the
United States Government and the deter
mined battle of the Southern Pacilic Com
pany in the United States Circuit Court to
prevent the California State Railroad
Commission from reducing rates in this
State on the various lines of the company,
more than usual interest attaches to the
financial statement of that corporation for
the year ending June 30, 1895, which
should have been presented to the stock
holders at the annual meeting last week.
Only a brief condensed report could be
made, as all the data and figures had rot
yet come to hand from the Atlantic
system of the Southern Pacific Company
nor from the Texas roads, which within
the past year have been incorporated as a
part of the Southern Pacific Company.
; Controller Mahl is now devoting all his
time and that of his assistants to get
ting the full report in shape at the earliest
time, but. even without any unexpected
delays it will not be out of the printer's
hands and ready to be given to the public
short of three weeks. Mr. Mahl expects
to conclude his labors in about two weeks,
when lie will leave for New York, allowing
Mr. Wright, the newly elected secretary oi
the corporation, to loot after the minor
details of the report.
Among the most interesting matter
usually embraced in the report is the ad
dress of the president to the stockholders,
reviewing the past year's operations and
outlining more or less definitely the work
ahead and the future prospects of the cor
poration. This has not yet been begun, as C.
P. Hunting: . -a imi.^t necessarily have the
full report before him before he can intel
ligently discuss the affairs of the company
over whose destinies he presides.
From the advance sheets of the report
the following important figures covering
the operations of the Pacific system of the
Southern Pacific Company, that in which
the people of Califoruia are most inter
ested, were obtained, covering the year
ending June 30, 1895:
Total income $31,496,080 44
Total expenditures .. 31,117,516 33
Net Income $378,664 11
Betterments 609,700 _8
Expenses of land department- 45,126 53
Netdefieit $276,262 70
From this it will be seen that while
there has oeen an actual net income of
$378,564 11 the report shows a deficit of
more than a quarter of a million. But
this deficit is not a loss. In order to create
it $609,700 28 were expended in better
ments, which are an asset and in reality a
profit and not an expense, as generally
understood among bookkeepers, and con
sequently the "deficit" really represents
improvements to the road.
For the year previous the Pacific system
ofthe Southern Pacific Company made the
following showing:
Total Income $37,209,365 03
Total expenditures 33,163 759 48
Net income $4,045,605 65
Betterments 241,160 19
Net surplus 1 $3,804,445 86
A comparison of the figures for these
two periods shows a remarkable difference
between the results of the operations of
the company during 1893-94, a year when
there -were neither Federal nor State au
thorities seeking to bring the company to
book, and the year 1894-95, when the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad is seeking to evade
the payment of its honest debts to the
United States and the Southern Pacific is
battling with the State Board of Railroad
Commissioners to prevent a reduction of
rates to what is considered a reasonable
figure by the constituted authorities.
During tbe period first named there was
a net surplus of $3,404,445 36, and during
the latter there was a deficit of $276,262 70,
or a difference of $4,080,708 06.
There were a number of elections yester
day of some of the minor inner corpora
tions of the Southern Pacific Company,
which resulted in the choice of the follow
ine officers and directors:
Southern Pacific Railroad Company of
Californiaâ Charles F. Crocker, president;
H. E. Huntington, vice-president; I. E.

SUFFERED FOR HIS LOVE.
Striking Feature in the Court
ship of Fred Potter and
Hilda Lind.
The Girl's Mcther ani Brother Attack
Her Lover With a Loaded
Cane.
Fred Potter of 12 Salina street has found
out the truth of the saying that the course
of true love never runs smooth.
He and Hilda Lind, who lives next door
to him, have been keeping company for
some time. Hilda is 16 years of age and
Fred is 21. Last Monday, while the lovers
were walking along the beach at the Cliff
House, Hilda rushed into the breakers
and was pulled ashore in a bedraggled
condition by Fred. She was taken to the
life-saving station until the patrol wagon
arrived, when she was driven to the City
Prison and taken charge of by Mrs. Gil
more, the matron.
Hilda explained that her reason for
peeking a watery grave was because her
mother and brother objected to her keep
ing company with Fred. On Tuesday
morning she had become more sensible,
and on giving her mother a promise that
she would not again attempt to end her
life she was taken home.
Yesterday morning Fred appeared in
Judge Low court with bumps all over his
head, and swore out warrants for the ar-

Fred said that as he was passing the
Lind residence on Tuesday night Mrs.
Lind and her son rushed out and attacked
him furiously. Irving Lind beat him over
the head with a loaded cane, and Mrs.
Lind struck him with her fists and kicked
him. Then they told him if he dared to
fpeak to Hilda again they would make it
more interesting for him, and left him to
nurse the rising bumps on his head.
As he thought of their treatment of him
his choler rose and he hurried to the Cen
tral police station. He wanted to know
if he couldn't get an officer to go with him
at once to arrest Mrs. Lind and her son,
but he was advised to wait till morning
and swear out warrants against them.
Opium Ring in Chinatown.
Revenue officers yesterday found an account
book In the store of Wong Ling in Chinatown
that may lead to the discovery of an opium
ring. The accounts show that large quantities
of opium had been handled by Chinese during
the year. Thewclewill be followed up by the
officers and the ring hunted down if possible.

. THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1896.
OLDEST NATIVE DAUGHTER
Jesues Miramontez, Born at the
Presidio in 1815, Died
Monday.
SHE LIKED THE "DOOMSWOMAN"
Her Sister, Also Born in California
in 1806, Died at Santa Clara
April 3.
Jesues Miramontez.
Born December 27. 1815.
Died April 14, 1896,
Aged 80 years, 3 months and 17 days.
This is the simple record given in the.
old family Bible of the birth and decease
of one who has seen the struggle for the
possession of California, viewed with
anxious eyes the invaders' triumph and
the American flag floating proudly over
the conquered land, saw the victorious
generals march up and dnwn tho land in
all the pomp and pageantry of the con
queror, became resigned to the change of
of government and "lived happiiy ever
after."
When one of the pioneers leaves the
scenes of his earthly exploits the fact is
i duly given to a sympathetic public, but
here is one who had attained womanhood
I in the land of the Golden Fleece ere the
I Jasons came in quest of it.
The 27th day of December, 1815, out in a
building of the old Mexican fort, which
stood where the Presidio is now, in what
I is now used for an armory, Jesues Her
i nandez was ushered into the world. Her
! childhood's years were spent mostly in
j the company of her brothers and sisters,
'of wnom she had eleven. Her only tutors
i were her godfather and her godmother.
j Of the broader knowledge which comes of
i travel and much reading she had ac
! quired none, but of the events which are
1 ever interesting to the Californianâ the
troublesome times of the Mexican War, the
excitement following on the heels of the
discovery of gold in 1848, and life in gen
eral as it was lived in Yerba Buena and
vicinity her mind was a vast storehouse.
She was both christened and married in
the old Mission Dolores Church, which
still stands on Dolores street, between
j Sixteenth and Seventeenth. Her marriage
to Vicente Miramontez occurred in 1837,
and about three years thereafter the couple
moved to the corner of Sacramento and
Dupont streets.
"There used to be an old well in the
region of the old City Hall," said Jose M.
i Miramontez, the oldest surviving son,
j "and I have often heard my mother relate
j how the Spanish families, living in the
; vicinity, used to congregate round this
well and discuss the occurrences of the
j day. It was about this time that the In
| dians up on Russian River began to give
j trouble, and my lather, who was an officer
in the Mexican army at the time, was
ordered up there. They met the Indians
and defeated them in the region of the
present city of Sonoma. As they were
returning, before the men embarked in
their small skiffs at Tiburon for this City,
! ray father's musket was discharged wiiile
he was leaning on it and his hand was dis
figured forever." ' .7;
"Yes," chimed in Mrs. J. L. Kercheval,
granddaughter of deceased, who has come
down from Walnut Grove, Sacramento
County, to be present at the funeral; "and
grandmother has told me so much of the j
flurry that was produced in the surround- â 
ing country whenever an American shin j
arrived. The whole water front was lined '
with people. You know at that time the |
bay came up as far as Montgomery I
street."
Here Jose launched forth on a tale of
how the receding waters at low tide used
to leave a small lake near the foot of Clay
street, and how he and the other boys used
to get boards and paddle round in the pool
against their parents' strict injunction.
Shortly before her death scenes from
Gertrude Atherton's "Doomswoman" were
read to her, and she said they were true to
life.
To-day the body will be taken from her
son's home, at 723 Montgomery avenue, to
Halfmoon Bay for burial, and to-morrow
all that is.mortal of Jesues Miramontez will
be interred in the ground over which
tramped the pioneers in their search for
riches.
Her sister, Tomasa Gijenne, died at
Santa Clara the 3d inst., having passed the
ninetieth milestone in life. Thus depart
two of California's oldest native daughters.
Great grandchildren survive them both. â¢
THE RICHMOND DISASTER,
Mrs. Slume, Grandmother of Fritz
Krasmy, Dies From Her Injuries.
Mrs. Catherine Blume, aged 70 years,
who jumped from a window during the
progress of a fire at 118 Thirteenth avenue
on Sunday night last, died from tier in
juries yesterday. In this fire Fritz
Erasmy , aged six years, was burned -to
death. When Mrs. Blume was aroused
from her slumbers to find the house on
fire she was greatly excited and leaped
from a second-story window. She was
severely injured and it was not thought at
the time that she would recover. She was
the grandmother of the child who was
burned to death.- The death was reported
to the Coroner yesterday, but as the death
was solely accidental -it is not probable
that an inquest will be held.
DEMOCRATS THEIR FOES.
Ladies of the Republican Club Loyal to
the Woman's Party.
The Woman'#State Central Republican
Club held its monthly meeting at the Bald
win Hotel last evening.
There were addresses on Republican
principles and woman's share in the propa
ganda of the same by Mrs. J. Murray
Bailey, Mrs. Gregory, L. B. Leavitt, George
W. Owens and G. Powers. Mr. Owens ad
vocated the organization of women's com
mittees in every Assembly disirict.
Mrs. Whittonham opposed affiliation
with any party and thought women should
limit their efforts to the campaign for suf
frage for their sex. â  Mrs. Addie L. Ballon,
the president, reminded the lady that this
was not a woman suffrage association, but
a woman's Republican club. Mr. Leavitt
added with a good deal of spirit that he
didn't know a Democrat in the State who

did not think that women should stay at
home and attend to their business. Tbe
Republican party is the suffrage party he
declared, Mis. J allou emphasized the
statement.
It was decided that a special meeting
would be held in {the Baldwin parlors in
two weeks for the purpose of effecting an
organization of Republican women in each
district. . .
BUT ONE MORE CHARGE.
R. H. McDonald Jr. Is Again
Acquitted in the Superior
Court.
His Bail, Reduced to Two Thousand
Dollars on the Last
Action.
R. H. McDonald Jr. is within touch of
freedom. He has been acquitted of what is
recognized as tbe last charge against him
and the end of his prosecutions will prob
ably be on Saturday.
The charge upon which he has just been
acquitted is for doing away with a note for
$40,000. signed by Henry W. Westphal and
indorsed by C. O. Swan berg. It > was de
posited iv the People's Home Savings
Bank and in return McDonald was given
a letter of credit on the Pacific Bank. The
Pacific Bank failed, however, and as the
letter of credit was useless the note was
returned to Westphal. For returning this
note McDonald, in common with A. L.
Jenkins and others, was indicted for em
bezzlement.
J. E. Farnham, manager of the People's
Home Bank, and L. E. Phillips, its attor
ney, were the only witnesses on the stand;
They told the story of the disappearance
of the note on direct examination, and on
cross-examination they explained the
transaction. When this aspect of affairs
had been shown Carroll Cook, McDonald's
attorney, asked that the Judge instruct
the jury to acquit, as it had been shown
that the transaction had taken place on
the advice of the bank's attorney and with
out criminal intent. The Assistant Dis
trict Attorney made but little opposition
to the motion and finally agreed that the
court deliver such an instruction.
It was not exactly an instruction to ac
quit. The court auvised the jury that the
transaction was not in any way criminal,
but he said it rested with the ]uors to say
whether or not they would hear the re
mainder of the case or render a verdict at
once. They prelerreu to find at once, and
a verdict of not guilty was rendered ac
cordingly.
Cook then asked the court to dismiss
the two indictments for embezzlement
which are now hanging over McDonald.
They were both defective, and others were
filed in their places. Upon these substi
tutes McDonald was tried and acquitted.
Cook wanted the court to dismiss them.
The Assistant District Attorney demurred,
however, aud. the court therefore laid them'
over until Saturday. Judge Bahrs said
McDonald could plead an acquittal in
each case should he be tried on the indict
ments, and he therefore dismissed the bail
attaching to them. . 7 j7y 7'.-v
The only other charge now pending
against McDonald is one of perjury for
swearing to a false annual statement. This
was tried once before Judge Murphy and
the trial resulted in a disagreement. It
will come up on Saturday to be set. The
District Attorney is not very sanguine as to
the result should it ever come to trial. The
bail for this charge was reduced to $2000,
and that represents the amount of bail
which now separates McDonald from lib-
ertv.
McDonald is not troubling himself about
his bail, small as it now is. "1 am not
looking for it," he says. Some one of my
friends may come forward now and put it
up, but at this moment I have not thought
of the matter. I don't suppose that any
thing will be done until Saturday anyway."

HERE FROM THE WASATCH
Odd Things About Gold Mines,
Politics and Business
in Utah.
NO MORE BOOMS ARE WANTED.
J. M. Bariatt Tells of the New Slave's
Thrifty Conditionâ The Famous
j Ontario Mine.
"We have no boom and we don't want
any," said J. M. Barratt of Salt Lake yes
terday at the Palace. Mr. Barratt is man
ager of the Garfield Beach bathing resorts
at Salt Lake owned by the Union Pacific
Railroad. "We had one boom," continued
the gentleman, "and it was sufficient to
last us for all time. Every one knows now
that any boom is bad, and all we want is a
healthful condition of trade and that
natural progress which is incident to it. .
"This we are now getting in Salt Lake.
Business has improved a great deal during
the last several months. There has been
nothing sudden about it, but it has been
in such a way that we could notice it.
Salt Lake is now getting on a very good
basis.
"The new mining district at Mercer,
which at first a good many people thought
wasn't of much consequence, is developing
some good mines. It is about twenty
m iles from Salt Lake. The cyanide pro
cess has been introduced there, and by
this means the ore is paying quite well.
It is a gold ore. It is all gold about there.
"Then, .in the Tintic ; district, which
almost joins the Mercur, there are some
very handsome developments. Among
the big mines there is the Centennial
Eureka, which is paying handsome divi
dends. For several months it has been
paying $1 a share a month to the stock
holders. There are 30,000 shares, and
three or four men own all the stock c xcept
a very few shares. The owners are all
men over fifty years old. s They've got
enough and would just as soon retire, so the
mine is' for sale. I understand they ask
$3,000,000 for it.
"The Bullion-Beck mine, in Tintic, is
paying dividends, too. There is a lot of
work being done in and around there.
"The famous Ontario mine, at Park City,
is paying so well that there has been a
great change in tbe price of the stock. Not
long ago it was worth from $7 to $7 50 a
share. Now it is $J3 and $14. The On
tario paid a dividend not long ago. The
Silver King, also at Park City, is paying
dividends, too.
"There is a new railroad being projected
from Salt Lake to the Deep Creek coun
try and south. It is the Utah and Pacific,
and it is the intention to begin work on
the road soon.
"We have had our new State clothes on
for so short a time that we hardly know
yet how they fit. However, we are doing
some work that will be of value. Ihe first
Legislature which met in January closed
its session on April 6, after passing some
needed laws. Utah is all right now. We
feel that we are in good shape to go for
ward in a very prosperous way."
With Mr. Barratt are several friends,
also from the Wasatch Valley, among
them M. N. Walker and M. J. Cheesman
of Salt Lake. They are all here on a
pleasure trip, and will remain probably a
month. __ __
REDISTRICTING SCHOOLS.
Deputy Superintendent Stone Wants to
Promote Harmony Among Principals.
Deputy Superintendent Stone has begun
the arduous task of redistricting the City
for school purposes.
He believes it will promote harmony
among principals and teachers, con
venience of parents and children and gen
erally avoid confusion if the lines that
divide districts be more closely drawn.
To that end he has issued circulars to the
principals asking them to state the boun
daries of their districts as they understand
them to exist.
Wherever the interests of schools seem to
conflict he will call a conference of the
principals and adjust the difference as far
as possible for the welfare of all. He
pointed out to a Call reporter yesterday
that some of the schools, notably the Pa
cific Heights, Pacific Ay nue and South
Cosmopolitan, are far from the center of
their districts. This works a hardship to
some of their patrons.
Mr. Stone . will so , re-establish , the
boundaries, conforming those of the dis
tricts of the primary to the grammar
schools, that the primary shall act as di
rect feeders to the higher-grade schools.
Wants the Insurance.
Alice Knars-ton and Viola Knarston, by her
guardian, the widow and child of John 11.
Knarston, are suing the Connecticut Indem
nity Association for $5000, the amount of a
policy held by Knarsto.i at the lime of his
death. Knarston was killed by a Southern
Pacific local train at : Seventh and Market
streets, Oakland; on December _, 1305.

POINT LOBOS MASS - MEETING.
The Improvement C Ã¼bs Are Strongly
Unanimous f>r the Two and a
Half C?nt Rate.
The action of the Railroad Commission
at the meeting of Tuesday afternoon in
adopting a resolution calling upon all the
street railroad companies of the State to
Chairman George U. Fletcher Calling the Richmond District .Mass- Meeting to Order.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
make reports regarding their respective
business, does not quite meet the desires
of the Ashbury Heights Improvement
Club. They are the fathers of the now
general movement in favor of the street
car-fare reduction to " cents and for that
purpose called upon the Railroad Com
mission to consider the matter. Attorney
Andrew J. Clunie of the club, in present
ing the petition of his clients, cited the
attention of the Commissioners to the fact,
that the constitution of the State empow
ered them to regulate the freights and
fares of all transportation companies, not
withstanding a subsequent, Legislature at
tempted to limit the scope of their consti
tutional authority by excepting street
railroads from their jurisdiction.
Mr. Clunie, in his argument, requested
the Railroad Commission to proceed di
rectly through a few preliminaries to the
reduction of streetcar fares from 5 to 3
cents. The refusal of the Market-street
Railway Company to obey the order of
the Commission would take the question
to the Supreme Court, where the constitu
tionality of said order would be tested.
Railroad Commissioner La Rue was of
tbe opinion that the constitution of 1879
gave them authority over all transporta
tion companies, whether in city or coun
try, notwithstanding the fact that the
Legislature of 1880 excepted street rail
roads in its attempt to define the powers
of the constitutional enactment. He was
also of the opinion that the best and
quickest method should be adopted to
bring the matter before the Supreme
Court. *i :
"If that body decides eventually that
the law of 1880 is unconstitutional," said
Mr. La Rue, "then we will bave the right
to regulate the tares of street railroads
and I will favor an immediate investiga
tion of their reasonableness to determine
whether 'in justice to the public they
should be reduced. While i believe a
streetcar corporation should receive a fair
interest on its investment, I can also
readily understand that the public has a
right to demand from it reasonable trans
portation charges."
The discussion ended by the adoption of
a resolution offered by Commissioner
Stanton calling upon all the street rail
roads in the State to submit reports to the
commission by the .'slst of next month.
The Commissioner stated that the pur
pose of the resolution was to gain correct
information regarding the reasonableness
of fares, and also should any company re
fuse to make such report the commission
can test its authority in the courts. A
resolution was also adopted asking the
Attorney-General for an opinion on the
authority of the commission in the matter,
to be given not later than May 31.
"While I believe that the commission
really desires to deal justly in this matter,"
said Mr. Clunie yesterday, "I think the
better way would have been to go directly
ahead taking testimony ir view of reduc
ing the fares. _ Or course, the Southern
Pacific-Market-street Company or what
ever it may be called- -would have refused
to come down from the nickel, and by
mandamus the whole thing would go be
fore the Supreme Court. That body would
have decided, and the Federal courts
would have been bound by that decision.
"Now the Market-street Railway Com
pany, which, as everybody knows, will
deny the right of the Railroad Commission
to make any inquiries into their books,
accounts or business. They will simply
pay no attention to the order and the case
will go into the courtâ not the Supreme
Court. There it may stay for years, and
where is the immediate relief that th-
Ashbury people pray for? We want this
matter settled just as soon as possible and
tbat can only be done by a direct appeal
to the Supreme Court, by the Commis
sion going ahead under the presumption
that it has the right to regulate streetcar
fares. Then let the Market-street Railway
Company enjoin the commission from
carrying out its order to reduce the fares.
"We don't care whether the streetcars
of Santa Rosa. Marysvilie or San Bernar
dino can stand a reduction, because that
does not go to the meat of the matter;
neither do we want to learn whether the
Market-street Company will send in its re
port or not, because we know itavill not.
We simply want to hear the Supreme Court
tell us whether the Railroad Commission
can regulate streetcar fares or not. Then
we will learn all about the business of the
Santa Rosa, Marysvilie and San Bernar
dino streetcars, if we care to do so. How
ever, we are not settling the fares of any
of the transportation companies except
the Market-street.
"This going to the Attorney-General for
advice and to the street-car companies for
reports appears to be giving ti.e Market
street Railway the benefit. of the doubt.
For heaven's sake, give the people the
benefit of a doubt sometime! J_et us con
clude just this once that the people deserve
some rights, and act on Â»that assumption.
The Market-street Railway Company is
more merciless in its methods than its
sister-cuttlefish, the Southern Pacific. It
has gobbled up whole streets, paying not
one cent for trie privilege. It has snatched
all the entrances to Golden Gate Park, and
if a resident of San Francisco wishes a
little fresh air in that great recreation
ground he must pay tribute first to that
tyrannous corporation. It has grabbed all
the competing lines, except the Sutro,
Sutter and Presidio, and practically owns
all the passenger transportation business
of the City. Should it gobble up the Sut
ter where would Sutro be?
"Now suppose the fare was cut to 3 or
2J_ cents, you would see three , persons

Suppose tne railroad company sold tickets
ten for 25 cents wouldn't everybody be
riding in the cars? Let the company
knock out the transfers if the public can
get two rides for the nickel or for the 6
cents.
"Since the action of the commission last
Tuesday the Ashbury Heights people are
more determined than ever that the obli
gations due from the railroad company to
the public shall be kept. They realize
that the Market-street Company is simply
a branch of the Southern Pacific* Company,
and that the two have everything in com
mon. The Railroad Commission seems to
be in doubt on the street-railroad question.
"There are other interests owned and
I operated by the Southern Pacific Company
! over which the Comissioners have abso
j lute jurisdiction. One of these is the
Â regulation of charges in the Pullman cars
j and the Wells, Fargo & Co.'s express. We

i tainly all transportation companies and
1 tne Railroad Commission has never taken
; them in hand. Moreover the action of
i the commission against rates of the

portions of the routes of such franchises

of its tranfer system."
RICHMOND AROUSED-
Fire and Police Protection Wanted.
A Federation of the Clubs.
A mass-meeting under the auspices of
the Point Lobos Improvement Club was
held in Richmond district last evening,
for the purpose of advocating cheaper and
better streetcar service and more fire pro
tection. The meeting was called to order
by Chairman George R. Fletcher, who
stated the object of the gathering.
"In the matter of car fares," he said,
"the club will advocate the 2Â»_ cents reduc
tion, and as Richmond is never backward,
where there is any work in improvement
to be done, the Point Lobos Club will be
found going ahead.
"The question is, Can we better afford to
pay 2y cents for two rides and take our
time or the 5 cents and be limited as to
when and where we take the rides? Now,
in regard to the fare and the two trans
lers there are comparatively few who use
so many transfers. In fact there are not
more than 20 percent of the patrons of the
streetcars who use transfers at all. Many
object to the 3-cent proposition, as that
would bring copper coins into circulation,
and we haven't got down to the single
cent basis yet. â  ._' -Â£
"The transfers sooner or later will dis
appear anyhow, as the railroad companies
are not obliged to give them, and those
corporations are not in the habit of giving
things away to any great extent. Some of
them have been stopped already. 7 I heard
a car employe say that the Market-street
Company was â¢ in favor of a reduction.
Then, I say, in heaven's name give us the
redaction, for that is what we are yearning
for. ' - ; ' : Â«yVyVy;.-:v7-7-7
"I have.heard that the wages of the car
employes will go down with the fares.
How the corporations love to appeal to
the workingmen when they are driven
into a corner. There will be no such cut
in wages, as there is an old law which says
they cannot be put lower than 21 cents a
trip, I believe. There will be more pas
sengers to carry at 2'_ cents a fare, and
more cars to accommodate them."
_ S. X. Darbee, president ofthe Richmond
District Improvement Association, said
that the club was in favor of 2}_ cents, but
not 3 cents. \ * ~
Dr. Rottanzi of the South Side Improve
ment Club stated , that his locality would
get all it asked for in the way of improve
ment, because the residents fought for it.
"I think it about time," said he, "that
the taxpayers, and not the i taxeaters
should rule this City." *
J. H. Dever of the Presidio Heights Im
provement Club advocated the iy, cents
reduction. - ; ,y
Secretary Maloney of the Richmond
District Improvement Club made a motion
that all the clubs of the City send five
delegates each to meet the officers of the
Point Lobos Club to take steps to form a
federation of clubs. It was adopted, and
the first Wednesday evening in May was
chosen for the meeting.
Alaloney also offered the following reso
lution:
li hkreas, During the disastrous fire of Sunday
evening, April 12, in this district two homes
were laid in asnes and made desolate on account
of the poor fire facilities and worse mode of giv
ing fire alarms, and, whereas, the shocking
death oi an innocent babe and the maiming
and subsequent death oi an aged lady was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL. 16, 1596.
principally due to the fact that there is no po
lice oflicer on duty, at night in that portion of
the I district .to give >an alarm, and
that the keys to the fire-alarm boxes' are
hard to obtain, as at that time causing
a delay of nearly half an hour bciore an alarm
was given or before assistance arrived, be it
Resolved, That we petition the Board of Su
pervisors to provide an engine for the outer
portion of the district and also for more fire
alarm boxes, and that keys be furnished to
three or four property-owners living near each
box; and also that a mounted police oflicer be
detailed for night duty in the district west of
Twelfth avenue.
Resolved, That we extend to the bereaved pa
rents of the innocent victim of that unfortu
nate occurrence our earnest sympathy, and
that we also appeal to all Richmond residents
to aid and assist us in making our homes and
families secure by day or night, and make im
possible in this district the repetition of the
unfortunate affairs of April 12.
Resolved, That we believe that the Board of
Supervisors.Fire and Police Commissioners will
grant our request when our needs are stated;
be it
Resolved, That a copy cf these resolutions he
forwarded to each body.
Quite an animated discussion took place
over the lire facilities of the district and
the difficulties of setting engines over the
badly paved streets, especially during night
alarms. '-:--"/â¢; &;'.Â£;
J. H. Dover, who is foreman of Engine
2G, said that it was dangerous to drive at a
rapid rate through unlimited and unim
proved streets. It was the sense of the
meeting that the district must have more
alarm-boxes and a general improvement
of the fire system throughout the locality.
Months ago the Fire Commissioners had
been asked for such simple things as more
boxes and keys and no heed had been paid
to their request. They also wanted better
police protection, but so far had not been
able to obtain it. y >'
After all the questions had been dis
cussed at length the meeting adjourned.

ALL FINE CHORUS SINGERS
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir
Gives an Excellent
Concert.
'â  ; yy'y /%>
FIRST TIME IN THIS CITY.
In Technique and B .lance the Body
of Sweet S'ngers Created a
Favorable Impression.
, An artistic success was scored by the
Mormon Tabernacle cho'r in Metropoli
tan Temple last night. The public
heartily applauded the visitors from Utah
and in several instances induced them to
break through their commendable reserve
in the matter ot encores.
The organization brings a number of
soloists, but its real strength lies in the
choir itself. The large body of singers
shows the effects of long and regular
choral practice, which is an absolute requi
site to success in choral singing. The
parts are evenly balanced and the voices
pleasant in timbre, with a good round
volume of tone in the forte passages.
The shading was very satisfactory,
though the listeners would not have had
to strain their ears even if the piano pas
sages had been a little softer.
As for the attack, it was excellent, par
ticularly in the- opera work. In the Mor
mon hymns there was a slight tendency to
slur, but this was evidently done ad
visedly, in order to enhance the ecclesias
tical character of the music. The final
chorus in the "Traviata." which was the
gem of the whole concert, was sung with
splendid attack, as well as with crispness
and dramatic expression, while the volume
of sound was full, penetrating and sweet.
In this number Miss Lizzie Thomas Ed
ward did excellent solo work. y
Judging from last night the Mormon
choir possesses remarkable versatility for
FLINTS NEW AIAII.CAR.
it performs opera, oratorio and Mormon
hymns. The last named may be very in
teresting in the Tabernacle, but they
seemed dreary and dirge-like in the ears of
gentiles as concert music. The way in
which hymns were rendered showed people
that the choir must be capable of doing ex
cellent oratorio work and one was tempted
to wonder why the singers had not come
afield prepared to give oratorios in their
entirety, when their remarkably good ren
dering of the "Traviata" chorus revealed
them in a new and unexpected light, lor
there is a very wide step from the solemn
strains of a Mormon hymn to the tuneful
sparkling music of "La Traviata."
It had been intended to end the pro
gramme with the "Hallelujah" chorus,
but the organ at Metropolitan Temple was
found to be so out of repair that the con
ductor, Evan Stephens, very wisely de
cided to dispense with its services." The
great chorus from "The Messiah" was
therefore abandoned, and the "Traviata"
chorus substituted in its place. The ac
companiment of a piano instead of the or
gan must have been a drawback to the
choir, but it is stated that by to-night the
organ will have been repaired. â¢ .
Several of the Mormon hymns were
written by E. Stephens, the conductor of
the choir. The "Mother's Lullaby," which
the ladies' chorus sang, was by the same
composer, and the ladies kept well to
gether in the number and sang sweetly,
but they were unaccompanied and there
was a tendency to flatten. A male chorus
sang La Moth's "Breezes of the Night"
well. ;.;
Nellie Bruce Pugsley, the soprano who ;
did most work, is possessed of an exani- i
sitely sweet and flexible liquid soprano j
voice, though her selections were, not cal
culated to show off its best qualities. The
miserere scene from "II Trovatore," for
instance, demands dramatic soprano, and
though Miss Pugsley sang the music with
remarkable sweetness, something m the
style of the waltz from "Mirella," or an
aria for light soprano by Rossini or Bel
lini would have displayed her unusual vo
cal powers to better advantage.
The tenor, George D. Pvper, was very
satisfactory in the "Trovaiore." R. C.
Easton. another tenor, sang. "Annie
Laurie" with rather an overdose of ex- j
pression; he was heard to much better ad
vantage in the quartet from "Rigoletto,"
the other artists in the number being
Miss. Edward, Miss Allison and H. S. En- >
sign, all of whom sang well. Willard E.
Weihe is a satisfactory violinist, though '
he was scarcely able to compete with the
technical difficulties of Ernst's "Airs Hon
grois." As an encore he played a "Ber
ceuse" by Sauret.
To-night's concert promises to be un
usually interesting on account of the pre
ponderance of operatic music. The pro
gramme is as follows:

FLINT'S NEW MAILCARS
Railway Postal Clerks to Be
Housed in Pullman-Like
Coaches.
Designed by the Division Superintend
ent and H s Assistantâ Ready
for Service.
One of the finest mailcars in the United
States left Oakland pier last evening and
is speeding toward Ogden over the Central
Pacific.
It is a pity that so handsome a niece of
rolling stock should have only the numer
ical title 40*38 inscribed on its side. It would
seem that the beauty and luxury merited
a more poetic title. However Uncle Sam's
mail service officials lay no claim to poetic
fancy, no matter how many effusions of
that nature are handled under their direc
tion daily, so 400'S was the gilded inscrip
tion on the gloss y side -of the car that is
making its first trip.
It arrived with rive duplicates from Day
ton Ohio, three days ago and stood in the
yards until yesterday.
The new cars were designed chiefly by
Samuel Flint, superintendent of the Paci-
fie Coast division of the mail service, and
H. Lewis, the assistant superintendent.
While the United States Postoflice Depart
ment prescribes the plan of the frame
work of its cars, it leaves to the division
superintendent and his aides the designs
of the interior ana the adaptation of the
structure and size to the needs of the road.
The specimen ofthe half dozen addi
tions to the train service, which is on
the road to-day, is G8 feet in length from
platform to platform, and 9 feet in width.
It is 04 feet 4 inches in length from the
front to the rear vestibule and its weight
85,300 pounds. It has the same running
gear used in Pullmans and has the same
metallic framework, backed by rubber
about the doors. It is twice as heavy as
the mail cars formerly used on this line
and offer, the same resistance as a Pull
man.
The advantage of this as a precaution
against loss of life in a disaster is obvious,
since the mallear is always next the en
gine and receives the brunt" of the force in
a collision.
The new cars are lighted by means of
three Pintsch gaslight tanks, each having
a capacity of 57 cubic feet. The ten lights
thus furnished make it possible to de
cipher the faintest lines in a slovenly
superscription. The wood employed in
the interior furnisbings of the car is cherry
and the effect is neat and pleasing.
From the heavy floor of seasoned oak,
with iron above" and below, to the appli
ances for cooking the hasty meal of the
clerks, the car is complete in its provisions
for safety ana facility, and is simply de
signed to carry its share of the 30,000
pounds of mail that crosses the desert
every day. yy
The letter-boxes have wire bottoms,
hus enabling' the distributor to see at a
glance whether in the long rows of boxes
one letter may remain. Further facility
is obtained by larger boxes for the accom
modation of the larger envelopes, and
boxes ranged along the floor for the re
ception of packages of letters.
No feature of the new car is more ac
ceptable to the employes than Dewitt's
cinder-guard, which is attached to the
opening through which the mail is
thrown, and affords complete protection
for the eyes of the clerk.
Hall's lock safe occupies a convenient
nook, and is a safe receptacle for registered
goods, yiy

WINNIPEG. Manitoba, April 15.â A life-
time's slavery at the end of this century is al-
most beyond belief and yet it is true. In
Poyntz & Co.'s drugstore on Williams street
yesterday was discussed the remarkable de-
liverance of George Gaffield, a prominent
farmer and one of the oldest settlers of .-i.
Charles District, when he himself entered the
store. His step was firm and elastic, his eye
i bright, his bearing that of manly vigor, so that
the reporter hesitated to ask if he had just
been released trom a terrible bondage, but Mr.
Gaffleid was only too pleased to tell his story
for the good of humanity: "Yes, lam glad to
talk of it, because it may lead those who are
tobacco-spitting and smoking their lives away
to find a cure in N'o-To-Bac. 1 was a heavy
user of tobacco for over forty-five years, an in-
veterate smoker and chewer, using a frightful
amount ol tobacco and spending so much
money that it was ruinous to me financially.
Not only this, but the habit was disgusting to
all I came in contact with. Did I try to stop?
1 should say so: dozens of times, but I had be-
come such a slave to the weed that I couldn't
Jive without It. A year ago Povntz recom-
mended No-To-Bac to me and my wife urged
me to try it and so I bought a box. Prom the
day I took a No-To-Bac tablet I have not tasted
tobacco. I used three boxes of No-To-Bac and
was not only cured of the tobacco habit, but re-
gained my healtn and strength and was bene-
fited in more ways than one. The truth is that
No-To-Bac made a new man of me." Druggist
Povntz, who had listened to this wonderful
story, said: The Sterling Remedy Company
of Chicago, New YorK and Montreal are so fair
and square that it's a pleasure to do business
with them. They authorize every druggest to
sell No-To-Bac : under the absolute guarantee
that if three boxes fail to cure any case of the
tocacco habit the money. will be refunded, and
tbeyrefunait too." Get the booklet "Don't

A tittle Literary Story,
It may be true, and it may not, says
the New York faun, but the story goes
that when , Mrs. .Frances Hodgson Bur
nett's "Through One Administration"
was meandering its way through the
Century Magazine, she one day appeared
in the editor' 3 office with her last in
stallment of copy. "Look here, Mrs.
Burnett," said the editor, "you haven't
ended this thing happily, I* hope. Be
cause, if you have, it s absolutely fatal,
you know. The only thing you can do
with such a set of characters is to kill 'em
all off. every one of 'em, right and left."
"But," said Mrs. Burnett, "that's iust
what I've done. I've ended it happily."
"Then you'll have to write it over," said
the editor, "and kill .'em all oft. I tell
you, it's the only way to make such a book
popular." So poor Mrs. Burnett had to go
to work and write her last chapters all
over again, so that the characters would
be "killed off," and the book become
popular.

saw Wheeler meet and cdeck the advance
their anxiety was turned to joy and Gen

WITH FOUL PLAY?
Pretty Maud Morse Mys
teriously Disappears
From Home.
STARTED FOR A BAKERY
Then She Borrowed Ten Cents,
Bearded a Streetcar and
Lost Herself.
A WOMAN WITH A HISTORY.
Though Only Eighteen, Has Traveled
the World Overâ She Is
Highly Educated.
One week ago to-day pretty Miss Maud
Morse- of 3013 Buchanan street left her
home to go to the bakery half a block
away. From that moment until the pres
ent time Mr. and Mrs. Bowers, with
whom she was stopping, have not seen
her, and they fear that she has either
committed suicide or met with foul play.
When the young woman did not return
home Thursday night Mrs. Bowers be
came uneasy and made a hurried visit to
the bakery. There it was learned that
Miss Morse borrowed a dime under the
pretense that she was ill and must consult
a physician at once.
Miss Morse boarded the Union-street
car, and waving a friendly adieu to the
baker's wife, who stood m the little shop
door, started on her journey. Days passed
-MISS MAUD MORSE, WHO DISAPPEARED LAST THURSDAY.
and the young woman did not return.
Tuesday last the matter was reported to
the police, but all efforts to trace her
movements after leaving the car have so
far resulted only in failure. The physi
cian on whom the missing girl said she
intended to call was seen, but he declared
that he had not seen herâ in fact did not
know any such person.
Miss Morse is a dainty young girl of per
haps 18 years of age. She is dark of eye,
with features very much on the Spanish
type and altogether more than ordinarily
prepossessing. In addition to these facial
beauties she has a charm and grace of
manner which indicated that she had
been accustomed to walk in .the higher
circles of society. In fact, Miss Morse ap
peared to be a young woman with a his
tory, though Mrs. Bowers was able to
glean only bits of it here and there.
On the last day of March Mrs. Bowers
advertised for an assistantâ one under
standing general housework, at the same
expert with the needle. The next day-
April Iâ Miss Morse rang the doorbell.
She wanted a home at once, so it was easy
to agree on the remuneration.
"She was of a gentle and confiding na
ture," said Mrs. Bowers yesterday,
"though I was never able to learn much
about her private life. She was evidently
well born, and had been highly educated,
speaking French and German as fluently
as she did her native tongue. On one oc
casion she told me that she had traveled
all over the world France, Germany,
Italy, Asia and the Hawaiian Islands. At
another time Miss. Morse told me that she
was born in San Francisco, but had moved
to Baltimore a number of years ago. She
returned to this City some months ago,
and for a while was with the family of a
Mr. Tucker on Green street.
"You see she left everything she had,"
continued Mrs. Bowers, as she showed
the room formerly occupied by
Miss Morse. "All of her clothes, pictures
and little trinkets are just as she left tbem.
I fear she has committed suicide, though
why she should do such a rash thing I
cannot understand. She seemed happy,
and to far as I knew did not have any
gentlemen acquaintances. I shall leave
everything just as it is until she comes
back, which I know she will do, if alive."
In Miss Morse's room was found a; num
ber of photographs, one bearing. the signa
ture on the reverse side "Your friend, Mrs.
Gertie Levey. San Francisco." On the
table lay a little silver watch, and near it
a lady's purse, containing only a laundry
list.
The disappearance of the young woman
is peculiar, to say the least, and so far the
Police Department has signally failed in
tracing her any farther than from the
bakery to the boarding of the streetcar.
A MYS ERIOUS SHOOTING.
F. W. TTig-rt ii Found Unconscious on tho
Kailroad Near the Cliff.
F. W. Wigren, a barber, aeed 30 years,
living al 152% Steuart street, was found
lying on the railroad track, near the sig- j
nal station, at 7:30 o'clock iast evening.
The engineer in charge of the Cliff House
train noticed the body on the track and at
once stopped the train.
Wigren was taken in charge by the
signal-service men, and later was removed
to the hospital. Ail-that he would say
was that he had been shot. There were
several holes in his face, and the blood
flowed from the mouth. It is thought
that he in a fit of despondency shot him
self. A letter addressed to Mina Menen,
and written in Russian, was found on his
person. â¢ ; y r
OBSTACLES TO HAPPINESS.
Lecture of Victor E. O'Brien to the
Socialist Labor Party.
A good-sized audience listened to an ad
dress on the above subject at 115 Turk
street under the auspices of Liberty Branch
of the Socialist Labor party. The meet
ins; opened with a brief address ny the
chairman, P. Ross Martin, who introduced
the young lecturer as an earnest and zeal
ous student of sociology.
The lecturer, Victor L. O'Brien, graph
ically portrayed "the obstacles and im
pediments to human happiness under the
present system" and spoke of the augury
of peace and plenty under the reign of
socialism and justice that the coming
change in the evolution of economics has
in store for mankind.
Under socialism the lecturer claimed
the present wearisome and unchristian
struggle for supremacy and success will
give place to a more generous and fraternal
rivalry for the accomplishment of com
mon efforts for the welfare of all mankind.
Short speeches by the following mem
bers of the Socialist Labor party followed:
Theodore Lynch, Leon Gasser, Henry
Warnecke, Max Leiterns, G. B. Ben ham
and George Speed. The meeting closed
with the singing of the "Marsellaise."

Edward McDermott Arrested for "Graft-
ing" in the City Hall.
Edward McDermott, a carpenter, was
arrested yesterday morning by Policeman
Wagner for violating the ordinance a_ainst
"grafting" around the Police courts.
K. O'Connor, a stonecutter, was arrested
on Clay street Tuesday for being drunk.
He had $8 20 in bis pockets, and yesterday
when he was discharged McDermott, who
was with him when arrested, was waiting
for him and accompanied him to the prop
erty clerk's office.
O'Connor told Sergeant Moran that Mc-
Dermott wanted the half of the $8 20. be
cause he had been the means of getting
him discharged by Judge Joachimsen.
The sergeant took O'Connor through the
detectives' room and notified Policeman
Wagner, who found McDermott waiting
patiently for O'Connor in the corridor.
BOCKS ROUND HIS NECK.
i Desperate Suicide of an Un
known, Believed to Bs a
Sailor.
Ghastly Find of the Crew of the Bay
Schooner Pike County Near
Baden.
An unknown man, fairly well dressed
and having every appearance of being at
least in comfortable circumstances, found
death in the bay some time between Sun
day and yesterday morning, and his body
is now awaiting identification at the
Morgue at Redwood City. When the crew
of the bay schooner Pike County, that was
lying at the wharf opposite the XL dairy,
about two miles from Baden, in San Mateo
County, began its labors yesterday morn
ing it discovered the body of a man be
neath the vessel, and after an ineffectual
attempt to extricate it sent for the Coroner
and the police authorities.
When the body was taken out it was
found that a small sack containing a quan
tity of rock was fastened about the neck,
and a place on the side of the head ap
peared to contain a bullet wound.
At first the case was thought to be one
of murder and Deputy Sheriff Fred Disa
rello began an investigation, but . soon
came to the conclusion that the man had
committed suicide. A Coroner's jury,
consisting of H. A. Potter, Richard Con
ley, J. F. Cody, N. Jones, J. F. Horn, A.
Wilber and J. B. Wales, was called, and
after bearing tho evidence and viewing
the corpse rendered a verdict of suicide.
The body is that of a man about 45
years old, with gray hair, dark complex
ion, and bears evidence of having been a
sailor. On his arm is the tattooed image
of a brig. On his right hand, near the
forefinger, is a star, and on the left, about
the same place, is an anchor. His clothes
were of fairly good quality and in the
pockets were found $1 05* in silver, an
open-faced watch with the case number
2171 and a private number 5574 M, a knife,
silk hanclkerchier, three keys and a busi
ness card of P. Flanagan, a furniahine
poods dealer of 152 Sixth street. An Odd
Fellows' pin was attached to his vest.
A copy of The Call of Sunday last, also
found in his pocket, showed that be must
have made his fatal plunge some time
subsequent to Sunday morning.
It is supposed that' he tied the sack of
rocks about his neck and leaped off the
wharf where the body was found.
Inquiry at the business house, whose
card he had, failed to elicit any informa
tion that would lead to his identification,
though the proprietor remembered that
on Saturday fast two men, whom he took
to be either sailors or miners, called at his
place to make purchases and before leav
ing took his card. y
If a bicycler falls, and has Mitchell's Magic
Lotion, he can ride his bike home. *
The following strains of blood are said
to be united in young Prince Edward of
York: Norman, Flemish, Scotch, Saxon,
Spanish, French, English, German and
Danish..
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1896.
The Handsome Church of St. John the Evangelist on Fifteenth Street and Julian
Avenue, Where Was Celebrated Last Night the Fifteenth Anniversary of
Key. E. B. Spalding's Rectorship.
RECTOR FIFTEEN YEARS
Celebration of Dr. Spalding's
Long Connection With
St. Johns.
HE IS POPULAR IN THE CHURCH
Last Night Marked the Appreciation
by the Parishioners of His Guid.
ance of Affairs.
The fifteenth anniversary of Rev. E. B.
Spalding's rectorship in the parish of St.
John the Evangelist was celebrated last
night at the handsome church on Fif
teenth street and Julian avenue.
The parishioners assembled in mass in
the church to give to their beloved pastor
a reception worthy of the occasion,
In the early part of the evening a praise
service was held in the body of the church
by Dr. Spalding and his assistants, with
the full choir. Afterward the congrega
tion retired to Guild Hall adjoining,
where it was joined by Bishop Nichols and
the following clergy : Rev. G. E. Walk,
Rev. H. B. Collier and Rev. E. Lyon, with
Senior Warden Judge Van Reynegom and
Junior. Warden F. H. Eichbaum.
A varied programme of music and sing
ing was offered preliminary to the even
| ing's reception and presentation of the ad
dress to the pastor on his fifteenth anni
versary.
Bishop Nichols spoke feelingly of the
sterling qualities of mind and heart of the
Rev. Dr. SDalding and the wonderful
success he had accomplished in his fifteen
years' ministration of his duties as pastor.
Dr. Spalding being introduced by
Judge Van Reynegom, spoke of the able
assistance rendered him by the members
of his parish, particularly the two wardens
who stood by him for the good of the
parish. The ladies also came in for their
share of praise in their labors of love and
devotion for the welfare of those depend
ing upon their moral support.
Junior Warden Eichbaum read the fol
lowing report of the committee, giving the
statistics of the parish since 1881:
Your committee appointed to take suitable
' action to mark the filteenth anniversary of Dr.
.; Spalding's rectorship of this parish, feel that in
congratulating him we have equally if not
greater cause to congratulate ourselves upon
this happy occasion.
The records of our parish, gathered through
these many years of Dr. Spalding's rectorship
and summarized herewith, speak for them
' selves. They will compare favorably with
those of sister parishes of our own and other
dioceses, and should be a cause for devout
thankfulness. Such results, humanly speak
ing, however, could only have been obtained
through wise leadership. Through a wise guid
ance and by personal sacrifice as unusual, per
l haps, as are the statistics of our parish, has its
v work during these fifteen years been accom
, plished.
1 Long rectorships are, as a rule, the exception
. in the history of our church in this country
r Many reasons might be assigned for this. Here
at the West, especially, is a constant change
i and fluctuation in parish life that often hin
r ders deep and lasting attachments, and not in
frequently encourages differences and even
1 partisan strife. There is also an increasing de
, mand for financial support for God's work in a
, new country like our own which is not always
cheerfully recognized, and oftentimes tempts
â¢ our rectors to flee away ana be at rest. It is a
. cause for congratlation for us that in these
i years differences have been almost unknown
among us. With a united front as a parish
' we have gone on from our little church, the
memory of which is so dear to our older mem
, bers, to our present beautiful building with
' our Holy Innocents' Chapel and prospering
â¢ Good Shepherd's Mission in peace ana har
mony.
It is hard, to realize the growth from that
little building of fifteen years ago, with its
congregation all scattered and its few mem
, bers, to our present conditionâ united.we trust
In love for God's workâ nearly 700 com
municants. Indeed, if today, those baptized
and confirmed in these fifteen years should
gather at our church door our present build
ing, large as it is, could not contain them. We
may well say, as we look back on this spiritual
harvest, "What hath God wroueht."
Financially we are not a wealthy parish
Our location is in a poorer Dart of this growing
City; and yet we have been able in these years
to do for ourselves and assist in general church
work in a way that {as we examine our sta
tistics), it should be a matter of honest pride
to reflect upon and think how much has been
done. To accomplish this our rector has been
an important factor; without his self-sacrifice
it could not have been done. When we could
not have afforded it, he has provided assistants
lor large and growing parochical needs. Other
generous sacrifices of Dr. Spalding's have
been made; some to assist in meeting current
expenses, some to beautify our church
Nor have his labors been confined to our
parish interests alone. His gratuitous services
aided the self-denying efforts of those ladies of
our church in this City, to whom is due under
God, ihe resuscitation of St. Luke's Hospital
His voice has ever been raised earnestly for the
support of missions at home and abroad The
Del Monte chapel, an artistic and substantial
church building in the magnificent grounds of
the Hotel Del Monte at Monterey, stands as a
monument to the untiring zeal of Dr Spald
ing; Doth the building and the lot on which it
stands having been secured to the church
chiefly through his efforts. mmm
That the value of his ability and services has
been recognized in honors and position in the
dioce*>e has been a mailer of pride to us his
parishioners, and on this, the fifteenth anni
versary of his long and successful rectorship
with warm esteem we pledge him our hearty
support in his efforts as rector for this work of
the church, and pray that our present rela
tions with him may long remain unbroken

cated, while the attendance at all services in
the parish was 47,743.
During the fifteen years ending at and in
cluding Easter, 1896. the total amount of mon
eys received from all sources was $142,112 71,
the total amount paid for parish expenses and
parisn work was $127,787 82; the total amount
expended for mission work outside of the par
ish was Â¥10,643 91. *
Besides the total amount paid for parish ex
penses, as above stated, $4070 86 was ex
pended for charity from the communion alms,
$57,000 approximately was expended in ac
quiring land and the erection of church build
ings thereon, some $40,000 of which was paid
from the proceeds of the sale of the old church
lot on the corner of Valencia and Fifteenth
streets. During the time stated over $3000
has been contributed from the parish for St.
Luke's Hospital, in addition to the above-men
tioned amounts. The entire receipts of the
parish for the year ending at and including
Easter, 1896, were $7593 63, of which $566 57
was expended for mission work outside of the
parish.
Judge Van Reynegom then presented
his pastor, on behalf of the congregation,
with a handsome gold watch, ana to Mrs.
Spalding a vase of maidenhair ferns was
the offering of the ladies.
On behalf of himself and his wife, Dr.
Spalding again thanked his faithful and
loving parishioners for their kind remem
brance of him and his wife.
Refreshments were served in an adjoin
ing hall to those assembled, where a gen
eral jubilation of good fellowship were ex
changed between clergy and laity.

THAT WORD EXPRESSES AGONY. THOSE WHO HAVE
â *â  been so unfortunate as to have suffered from it in an aggra-
vated form say that they often feel that they had been afflicted
IjgSg&gL with the horrors of the damned. The terri-
' qpIMIS ble dragging, intense pain which extends
j||?Â§Â§F from the small of the back down through the
'^m -||^ hip and back of the thigh to the knee is
f^' im^L sometimes impossible of description. This
Â§MA is a nerve pain, arising from congestion at
%^|^pSÃj|pl ie base of the spine. It is somewhat akin
VfcBl^pp?3Bl to Lumbago, an( i they are frequently in com-
R3S|flEp pany in torturing tho poor sufferer. Of all
ffiSJaSjjflSft the remedies applied by physicians in the at-
felÃ^^S tempt to cure Sciatica or Lumbago, none
Ilfl^^^^ have ever been successful except Electricity.
''.Wf^ The most certain cure is Dr. Sanden's Elec-
ts' jÃSjf trie Belt, which is made with a direct object
If mm oJ reac^i n o the sciatic nerve, into which it
& r M MM infuses a healthy, life giving current of elec-
fllf fill tricity, which quickly decomposed the con-
Mil mm gested matter, relieving the nerve of the
_Jl_ p*? painful pressure, and at the same time gives
rt^^_**'___L aji, to *** new strength with which to support the
Ul-rf**" Â§Â§__uÂ»* g *' weight of the body.
Electric Belt gives a powerful electric current through the body.
The patient feels it all' the time, and it has; a patent regulator
which turns the current on mild or strong at any time.
Recent Cures.
"I want you to know what your Electric Belt has done for me. I have been a sufferer from
Sciatica for rive years or more, and it just did me up at times. When 1 would stoop over I
would be unable to get up again without great pain, and suffered a great deal from it. I got
relief in two days from your Belt, and my back is now as well as ever. It has done me much
good in other respects also, and I know it to be a good thing. I believe that people who need it
ought to know of its value. I wouldn't part with mine for any consideration."â S. D. VALEN-
TINE, of Francis Valentine Co., Printers, 517 Clay street, San Francisco. ...
"You can refer to me as an example of what your Belt will do. It has saved me from going
to the hospital. I have been a great sufferer from Sciatic Rheumatism for several years. Last
fall I was in the hospital two months, and saw nothing to save me from it again till" I got your
Belt. I got the Belt just as the trouble was coming on again, and lam pleased to say that the
Rheumatism has been completely knocked out, and I am now enjoying good health."â H
KRUGER, 3281 Central avenue, Alameda, Cal. J J â¢ .. â¢
"When I got your Belt three months ago I had been a sufferer for two years from Sciatica
Had pains in my legs and knees. I had tried other remedies, but found nothing to help mc till
I got the Belt. In six or eight days after applying the Belt the pains left me and have not
come back since. I feel better than I have for 20 years."â K. KNOX, Mare Island Navy
Yard, Valiejo, Cal. J

FATHER YORKE TO SPEAK
IHe Will Deliver a Series of
Lectures in Metropolitan
Hall.
LIBERTY TO BE HIS THEME.
The American Women's Liberal
League Has Arranged for the
Whole Course.
Arrangements have been made by the
American Women's Liberal League for a
course of five lectures to be delivered un
der its auspices by the Rev. Peter C.
Yorke, chancellor of the diocese, in Metro
politan Hall. These discourses are to be
on civil and religious liberty. They have
already attracted considerable attention in
circles where Father Yorke is admired.
The purpose, it has been stated, of these
lectures is to give people an opportunity
of hearing both sides of the question
treated.
The first lecture will be delivered on
Monday night, April 20. on "The Nursing
Mother of Republics." Thursday, April
23, "The Dragon's Teeth" will form the
subject of a discourse, ana "Man's Inhu
manity to Man' will be discussed Mon
day, April 27. The fourth lecture will be
given May 8, on the "Day-spring on
High," and the series will be concluded
Tuesday, May 12, with a lecture on the
"Noontide of Freedom,"
The American Women's Liberal League
has taken this means of carrying out the
aims of its existence. It stands for abso
lute tolerance in religious matters. In
brief form its principles are declared in the
following manner:
We declare that liberty of conscience is not
only a privilege, but a sacred right in these
United States, and that freedom of religious
worship has been guaranteed to all citizens by
the constitution.
We assert that the experience of over a hun
dred years has demonstrated that religious in
tolerance is incompatible with the best civili
zation, and that persecution or proscription on
account of race, color or creed is a menace
to the country's welfare and the country's
good.
We denounce any attempt to array one class
of citizens against another on the score of race,
creed or color as un-American and unjust.
We condemn as violators of the constitution
those who seek, either openly or in secret, to
make a religious test a qualification for any
office of public trust.
We believe that no organization should be
permitted to render null and void, under any
pretext, the guarantees of religious liberty
contained in our organic law and to the end
that "no religious test should ever be required
as a qualification to office or public trust under
the United States," and that Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise and
enjoyment of religious profession, and that
worship, without discrimination or preference,
shall forever be guaranteed in the United
States. We hereby subscribe our names as
members of the American Women's Liberal
League.
The league has concluded to charge 25
cents admission for each of the lectures, or
$1 for the course, and double that sum for
reserved seats. These tickets are for sale
at the league's headquarters. 03 Donohoe
building.
The Study of Prophecy.
Lectures to facilitate the study of Bible
prophecy are to be given on successive Sun
day afternoons, in Scottish Hall, Larkin street.
This is an undenominational movement and
the lectures are to be free to the public. Dr.
P. Brett Morgan of the Reformed Episcopal
Church is expected to give the first of the
series next Sunday, having for his topic "The
Prophetic Outlines of Church and State. :

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. Y\, April 15.-The railway
and miscellaneous share market was strong
throughout, although the trading was on a smaller
scale than yesterday. â¢ The transactions were 150,
--900 shares. Probably the best feature of the
market was the increased interest taken in the
railroad issues by commission and foreign houses.
The buying by London firms was confined ma'.nly
to St. Paul and Louisville and Nashville, while
local commission brokers were moderate buyers of
the Grangers, VanderbOta and Consolidated Has.
There were also some investment buying of rail
way mortgages for both home and foreign account.
The advance in sterling exchange had no influ
ence on the market, and it is believed that gold ox
ports are not likely under existing conditions, un
less European bankers should elect to pay an extra
commission.
The gam in prices at one time was equal to 11,4
to is;, per cent, and was most pronounced in
Sugar, Lake iore. Louisville and Nashville, the
Grangers, Western Union, Manhattan, Consoli
dated Gas and Big Four. Sugar sold up to 1-3%,
the highest yet reached, and brokers with msiae
connections bought 4000 shares. Tobacco sold at
71 to 68 and 683 , ex dividend of 2 per cent cash
and 20 per cent scrip, and at 34 to 85^_ and 62U,
cash. Last nitht the stock in the regular wav
closed at 84. There was considerable talk about
enjoining the payment of the scrip dividend, hut
it was olHi'inllv stated that the company had not
been notified of any suit about this matter.
General Electric was rather weak and closed
fractionally lower on ihe day. The annual report
which is expected to-morrow, will show, as already
stated, a balance of 9800.000. It is understood
that no dividend on the preferred will be paid at
tins time. In the closing dealings the Industrials
were inclined to weakness, hut the railway list was
decidedly strong. The market as a rule closed
firm. Net changes show gains of VgtgilVfe per cent -

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 15.â Volume of trade
in wheat was noticeably smaller to-day than it has
been for some time. The shyness of the outside to
take a hand is plainly apparent, the market de
pending on scalping and local operations for Its
action. There were reports in California to hand
this morning, on which prices managed to appreci
ate slightly at the opening, but the news and
weekly weather bulletins of the other states gave
a more encouraging account of crop conditions,
and the early gain disappeared on the intelligence.
Receipts at Chicago were eleven cars, and 97,933
bushels were withdrawn from store.
The Northwest had 349 cars against 314 last
Wednesday and 194 a year ago. Liverpool cables
were quiet ana steady. Closing advices from the
Continent did not show much change from yester
day. A rally took place In the latter portion of the
session, some wheat being covered at the time
presumably for the account of Pard ridge, who is
very ill. Export clearances were light at 176,608
bushels. May opened from tiSVJc to 65V_c, sold
ween 04. r . 8 and 656/ c, closing at 65y_c. 2 (a,
$_c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow 20 cars.
CORNâ Dullness was the most noticeable attri
bute of the corn market to-day. Commission
houses were doing but little and the pit traders and
scalpers found scant opportunities for turning a
fraction. Moderate fluctuations corresponding in
direction with the movement of wheat prices took
place, though the amounts traded in were ex
tremely light. Receipts were 112 cars and 181,999
bushels were withdrawn from store. Liverpool
cables were V_d higher. Export clearances were
240,133 bushels. May corn opened at 30ygC, sold
between 30c and 30Vi@303 / _c, closing at 30* _@
30 1 _c, a shade over yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to- morrow 170 cars.
OATSâ Were stagnant through most of the ses
sion. Occasional short periods of Indifferent ac
tivity were en, a rally or break In whe it seem
in-' to awaken traders from the stupor of dullness.
Receipts were 117 cars and 145,535 bushels were
taken from store. -Jay closed unchanged from yes
terday. Estimated receipts for io-morrow, 190
cars.
FLAXâ Was firm. Cash, 92c; May, 895.4 c; July,"
92c bid; September, 9HV<_@9oS_c. Receipts were
15 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The receipts of hogs were large
this morning, over 6000 more than expected arriv
ing. This could have but one result on prices at
the yards and, in the natural order of things, on
product. An easier tone and a decline were noted
at the opening. Tbe closing strength of wheat
helped product to some extent. May pork closed
-'V_c lower, May lard unchanged and May ribs
2i/_c higher.

UNION STOCKYARDS, 111., April 15.âRe
ceipts of cattle were moderate to-day. The demand
was good and prices recovered 10c of the recent
loss. The arrivals of hogs were away above the
expectations, and under the circumstances prices
declined 5(o>10c. The demand was fair. Heavy
receipts of sheep resulted in a decline of 10c in the
market-

Rev. Marshall Law Meets
With Opposition in
His Church.
LADIES UP IN ARMS.
Treasurer Reed Resigns Because
the Pastor Made a False
Statement,
HE ALWAYS GOT HIS SALAEY.
A Vestryman Says That the Pastor
Has Been Indorsed â Given
Leave of Absence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
90S Broadway, April 15. J
The fashionable Episcopal Church of
the Advent resents its pastor's statements
that they have the dirtiest church he ever
saw and thai they do not pay him his
.alary regularly. Many prominent fami
lies worship at the handsome East Oak
land church, including J. J. Valentine,
president of Wells, Fargo & Co., and they
do not feel pleased at being told from the
pulpit that the "best thing to do with the
church carpet is to send it to Japan to
wipe out the black plague with." The
ladies, particularly, resent the charge that
their sewing circles are gossiping socials.
A. J. Reed, the treasurer of the church
and -one of the vestrymen, has resigned be
cause he says the pastor stated that which
Was not true.
"I have resigned as treasurer," said Mr.
Reed, "but shall remain a vestryman. I
know just how the finances of the church
have been run, and I know that Mr. Law
has been paid every cent of his salary.
Every attempt is being made to cover up
this trouble temporarily, but it will not
down, and I expect it will result in a
change of pastors. There is much to come
a light, but the matter is not yet in such
to form that action can be taken. The
church certainly cannot hold together very
long under the present circumstances."
Mrs. William Frederickson, who has
been for eight years at the head of the St.
Catherine Guild of the church, is very pro
nounced in her opinions.
"There is trouble in the church," she
said this afternoon, "and it is growing
rapidly. Fully two-thirds of the member
ship is disgusted with the present condi
tion of affairs and is anxious to have Mr.
Law's resignation, but he believes he has
a right to dictate to every organization in
the church. In his statement at the
parish meeting recently he said he should
have, more salary, and that the church j
could not force him to leave by refusing I
him enough to live on, for he had no right !
to leave bills unpaid. He should resign
when he sees that he is not wanted, in- j
stead of fighting to hold his place. I hope j
the Bishop will take the matter up.
"I have been the head of the St. Cather
ine Guild for over eight years and have j
now thirty-five members who would have !
left the church had not I kept them to- '
gether. The Ladies' Aid Society is ready
to disband owing to his actions toward
it. He attacks members from the
pulpit, for he knows they cannot reply to j
liim. I gave up my pew some time ago
owing to his actions, and many others |
have held them together in the hopes he
would resign. We strongly object to be
lnff called gossipers."
The Ladies' Aid Society met yesterday
and the members were so incensed at the
remarks of the pastor that they would
have disbanded had it not been known
that the pastor was sending them a com
plimentary letter.
Rev. Marshall Law said to-day that the
trouble arose from there being too many j
bosses at the church.
"Treasurer Reed is at the bottom of this
trouble," said the pastor. "He is a very
small, flexible man and has no judgment.
He is not a suitable man to be treasurer
of the church, and the position gives him
come importance and he does not know
how to cany it. So far as any trouble I
had in Japan before coming here is con
cerned, I -may say that L had no more
trouble than any man would have during
three years' school and missionary work
there. I fear nothing that may be
brought to the attention of the Bishop. If
1 had not a clean record I could not have
entered Bishop Nichols' diocese. Ido not
understand what some people mean. Some
of the ladies want to run the church,
and because they cannot do it they are
raising a row. Reed is one of seven vestry
men, and consequently has a vote, but he
does notcut much of a figure in the vestry."
"There are some dissatisfied ladies in the
church." said Vestryman Pope, "but they
are in the minority. The whole of the
vestry has been elected within the past
two weeks, and they have indorsed the
pastor and have agree- to grant his request
for a two months' leave of absence. We
now have money in the treasury for the
first time in ten years, and the membership
is increasing. "
. Treasurer Reed's position would seem to
be well supported by Mr. Pope. It is only
a week since the pastor complained of his
salary, and Reed declares the best proof
Etich a statement is not true is the fact that
there Is $200 in the treasury.

MARY YAHUE-BUUER
Charges Her Sister With Having Cut
Off Her Monthly Allowance.
OAK LAND. Cal., April 15.â Lady Mary
Leilah Yarde-Bull.r. daughter of the late
General Ralph W. Kirkham, has filed a
claim for a monthly allowance from her
father's estate. She claims the estate is
worth upward of 1500,000 and an annual
income of 122,000, or thereabouts. She
says she received prior to her father's
death from $350 to $400 per month, and he
directed that his widow should make such
provisions for their children as she should
see fit.
Tne widow, Kate Edith Kirkham, con
tinued the allowance to the petitioner of
$333 per month for her support, and that
of her two sons, aged 19 and 16 years,
but since she became incompetent and
Mrs. Kate Kirkham Wheeler was appoint
ed her guardian the allowance was sus
pended, and now she asks that it be re
newed and $1696 for arrears be Daid.
On her last visit to Oakland Lady Mary
Leilah created a flutter by applying for
letters of guardianship upon her mother,
who she alleged was incompetent. There
was quite a family fracas, which was finally
settled by granting her a regular monthly
allowance, and she hastened back to Eng
land evidently much to the relief of the
relatives left" here. Later her sister
secured letters of guardianship on account
of alleged incompetency of the motuer to
handle the large estate.
THE FINDS SHORT.
High School May Have to Be Closed
Two Weeks Early.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 15.â The condi
tion of the High School funds has been the
subject of some figuring by Superintend
ent McClymonds, and he has discovered
there will be a shortage of about $2400 at
the end of the year unless some provision
is made to avoid it. There has been ex
pended ud to April 1, for the maintenance
of the school, $34,980 54.
The salaries ior April, May and June
will amount to $10,650, and other esti
mated expenditures will pc $1300, making
a total for the year of $46,930 54. The
total allowance for the school for the year
was $44,494 13, which will leave a deficit of
$2435 91 to be met.
Chairman Friend of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Education said to
day that there were three ways to settle
the matter. First, the schools could be
closed a couple of weeks before the end of
the term; second, it might be kept open
and the teachers asked to donate their
salaries for the two weeks; and third, suffi
cient funds might be transferred from the
grammar school fund to meet the deficit.
CIRCUS AND CONSTABLE
A Great Hippodrome Attached
and Chased All Over
Town.
The Driver of a Wagon, Loaded With
a Show, Arrested and Released
en a Bond.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 15. J
There was a circus performance given in
the city to-day which was not on the bills
; and to which a large audience was specta
tors, although they paid no admittance
] fee. The leading men were trades people
i who attempted to get their money from
1 Howe & Allen's "three great shows com
bined" circus, which came to the city the
first of the week with a flourish of tinsel,
j a brass band and a .Newfoundland dog on
a float.
Collector John Stewart secured an at
tachment in Judge Cliffs court this morn
ing for a $30 bill for advertising and, as the
people were ready to leave for San Fran
cisco, the constable took charge. The
whole outfit was found on a dray of a local
firm and was at the foot of Broadway
ready to take tbe boat when the constable
arrived. When he claimed the load the
driver telephoned to his employers notify
ing them of the state of affairs.
The delay caused the driver to miss the
creek boat and he went to lunch. The
constable put a keeper in charge and re
turned to court. Later in the "afternoon
the teamster and the circus management
returned and carted off the goods, keeper
and all toward the pier, where they would
take the regular boat for the City. Seeing
he was not being honored, the keeper
rushed to a telephone and notified the
constable of what was being done.
The officer rushed to the rescue and
caught the party on Seventh street, near
Wood. He stopped them and ordered the
driver to leave his wagon, as it was under
attachment. The driver again appealed to
his principals by telephone and received
orders to go ahead. With that he mounted
his seat and started his team once more
for the pier.
With this the constable jumped on the
wagon, arrested and handcuffed the driver
and hauled him to the nearest police
patrol-box and attempted to ring in for
the patrol wagon. The officer did not un
derstand the mechanism of the affair, for
he stood for more than an hour awaiting
the patrol, which never came. Meanwhile
a large crowd bad gathered and amused
themselves in ridiculing the outfit. Wil
liam Leslie, the prisoner, took it all good
naturedly, and when the constable failed
to work the police alarm he told him that
if he did not know his duty better than he.
did the working of the box he had better
resign.
The express company meanwhile rushed
out, secured a bond and went after the
wagon and its contents, but left the driver
to be taken uptown on a charge of resist
ing an officer. -y .â¢<â  .-â¢â¢'.,; y,.
William Long, the West Oakland
butcher, also became an unwilling par
ticipant in the impromtu performance.
While the constable was turning round
the dray on which the circus was packed,
the tent poles swept through Mr. Long's
buggy and smashed it, and also broke
some of his harness, as well as frightened
his horse.
Now all the parties concerned are won
dering where they will come out. The
constable has to pay the butcher's bill,
the Doliceman had to endure the jeers of
the small boys while he tried to work a
patrol-box, and it looks very much as if
the officials carried off the honors of
clown between them, while the circus man
made a passable knave.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 1896.
RETURNS WITH LAURELS.
Professor Rhys R. Lloyd Left
Wales a Modest Little
Collier Boy.
BRAVE FIGHT AGAINST ODDS.
A Story of Success That Shows What
Can Be Accomplished by Per
severance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 14. (
Professor Rhys R. Lloyd, one of the
best Greek scholars in the country and a
member of the faculty of the Pacific
Theological Seminary, has just left for a
visit to his old Welsh home.
For the first twenty-three years of his
life he was a worker in tbe coal mines,
Professor Rhys R. Lloyd. Who Left Wales a Collier Lad and Returns a Noted
Professor.
i first of Wales and later of Pennsylvania.
When he left Wales he was known as a
very sleepy little messenger-boy who had
to be woke up by the colliers every time
they wanted him to fetch their tools. He
returns a Greek professor, and the story
of how he acquired his education and
fought his way to fame is worth pre
serving.
An incident happened when he was 10
years old that shows the character of
young Lloyd better than any other in his
career of perseverance. One day while in
the mine he tried to keep awake by pour
ing grains 0 powder from a keg into his
cap. While doing so twenty-five pounds
ignited, and with face and hands terribly
burned young Rhys was carried home.
One scar on his forehead and some en his
hands are still visible, but the worst one,
where the flesh for a space as large as his
palm was burned from his elbow, was over
a year healing.
Part of that time the boy went to school
and blessed his burns. The doctors said
the arm, held in a sling for eighteen
months, would always be stiff. For a long
time it was, but they did not reckon on
the determination of the lad. He worked
with his arm all the time. Sometimes he
fastened it between 1 the pickets of a fence
and moved his body backward and for
ward. Now the arm is stronger than the
other one.
Books were a luxury to hira, and he did
not really get any chance to study
till the great strike of 1870 at Pennsyl
vania. Lloyd went to school and finished
three grades of six months in three
months. He had to work in the mines
til he was 23. At 20 he married, and he
had a son a year old when he entered the
academy at Marietta. Ohio, in 1879. In a
year and a half he had graduated from his
classical course, supporting himself and
family in the meantime by acting as
janitor. After a summer spent in preaching
in Ohio young Lloyd entered the Chicago
Theological Seminary and from that time
he has forced his way upward.
For four years after graduation Mr.
Lloyd was pastor of the California-avenue
Congregational church in Chicago. While
theic a $37,000 church was built, and the
young Welsh minister, only four years I
out ot the mines, opened a most successful
career. By advice of others he decided to
enter the professional field, and took the
degree of M.A. from Hartford, Conn.
While in California he has received very
flattering offers, and has -written several
books that have brought him fame.
The professor and his wife have now
gone to travel for six months in Europe.
They will visit his old home, which he left
when he was fourteen, it is feared that
he will be weaned away from the Pacific
Theological Seminary while abroad, and
there are many who think his good-by may
be a farewell.
THEEE-COBNEKED DEAL.
Which Would Result in Bringing the
Valley Road to Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 15.â 1t has been
reported that there is a movement on foot
to combine the interests of F. M. Smith,
the borax king, and of Mr. Treadwell and
his associates in the Corral Hollow mine
railroad with those of the San Joaquin
Valley Railroad. If this is accomplished
it would no doubt expedite matters in
closing the gap in the Valley Road be
tween Stockton and Oakland without
great delay.

OAKLAND. Cal., April 15.â Mrs. Mar

times to drive her husband's _uesis from
the house and even threatening to burn it.
When Mrs. Sturman was given chance
to defend herself, she claimed that she
had acted as she did because her husband
had brought women home who were dis

bad been brought there for improper pur
poses. '
Mrs. Sturman is about 70 years of age
and her husband is about the same. She
was discharged.

WHISKY FOR ROAD TAX
It Was Seized by a Deputy
Who Was Glad to Re
turn It.
The Victim Drove Off With the Of.
fleer's Buggy anl an Exchange
Was Effected
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, April 15. J
John McCoy is a Deputy Road Tax Col
lector at Haywards, and he believes in en
forcing the law to the letter. When his
victim will uot produce the $2 McCoy
seizes on anything in sight. Yesterday
afternoon he called on Dick Vagts, who
keeps a saloon in Castro Valley. Mr. Vagts
did not produce his road tax, and an
nounced his intention of not doing so.
This did not suit McCoy, and so he
pounced upon a case of whisky and rushed
j out of the store. Vagts gave chase, but
j was unable to overtake the agile McCoy.
i The saloon-keeper returned to his place of
j business, and later in the day he went
I towaid Haywards, and great was his sur
â  prise when he saw his case of whisky in a
I buggy, which he recognized as McCoy's.
Vagts jumped into the buggy and
I drove off. McCoy rushed out of a house
i and started after the buggy. Vagts kept
j just far enough ahead to prevent McCoy
! reaching him and kept up a parley all the
| time. Finally McCoy became tired out
and offered to capitulate. Vagts was will
ing and a treaty of peace was agreed upon.
Vagts was to be driven home with his
whisky and McCoy was then to get his
buggy. The terms were faithfully carried
out, and after the saloon was reached Mc-
Coy paid for the drinks, and Vagts "prom
ised to pay when the collector called
again.

ment.

DENIES THE MEAT IS BAD.
Dr. Stahie Defends the Food at tho
City and County Hospital.
Dr. Stahie, superintendent of the City
and County Hospital, denies that the meat
furnished the institution under his charge
is unfit for use, as charged by the hospitals
committee of the Grand Jury.
"It is absolutely untrue," said Dr. Stable,
"that the beef is not of the best quality.
The meat is inspected by myself and the
steward. We are paying over 2 cents more
for beef than was paid previous to my
administration. The same contractor
supplied the beef last fiscal year. His
price last year was 4.21 cents a pound.
This year he receives 6.65 cents a pound
for first quality beef. The meat has always
been of the best, and I cannot understand
where such charges originated." .
Convicted of Battery.
Attorney Charles G. Nagle was convicted in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday of battery

ister Outâ Griggs to Lecture.
Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 15. â Rev.
George B. Hatch, pastor of the First Con
gregational Church of Berkeley, has been
the cause of no little comment among his
flock anu others who regulariy sit beneath
his hearing from Sunday to Sunday, by
the bold position which he has assumed
with regard to church music and those
who conduct it. He vigorously denounces
the custom in vogue in many of the large
metropolitan churches of employing pro
fessionals to sing, "Many of whom," says
he, "are wholly irreligious." He main-
ins that if a church body is careful in the
selection of those who are to preach, it
should likewise be careful whom it per
mits to sing the Gospel, and even more so
in the latter case, "for," says Dr. Hatch,
"song often goes much further than writ
ten or spoken words."
The chief cause for comment among his
flock is the sermon he preached last Sun
day, in which ho said: "In a thousand
churches brilliant musical performers
bring the woridliness into their perform
ance a"nd make the choral part of their
service an abomination and an offense.
The church has descended to this infamy
in order to fill its vacant pews, hoping to
attract with worldly song those whom it
failed to reach because it was not faithful
in the fulfillments of its high duties.
Next to preaching the truth of Jesus
Christ there is no work so sacred, no privi
lege so hieh as the work of making music
in the house of God. So sacred is this
work that in the organization of Israel a
whole tribe was consecrated and ordained
to perform it, and was placed under special
obligations of purity and holiness.
'"Ihe time will, come again I hope,"
said Dr. Hatch, "when the church willde
mand consecrated men and women to per
form the holy service of song in the house
of the Lord." The remarks of Pastor
Hatch are construed by certain of his con
gregation as being a direct hit at some of
the San Francisco churches in which pro
fessional singers are employed.
Will Have Their Bourdon.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 15.â fresh
man class at the State University has at
last decided to celebrate the completion of
their algebra and elementary English
courses by the time-honored pyrotechnic
display and the burning of "Bourdon and
Minto." When the matter of giving the
celebration was first brought up it was de
cided to do away with the accustomed
"burial" and to substitute for it a dancing
party in the "gym."
The. sophomores, their natural college
rivals, believe that this substitution was
due to the fact that the freshmen received
at their hands so severe a trouncing in the
last annual rush. The freshmen hearing
that the "sophs" held this opinion de
cided not to be bluffed, but to make a
game fight to carry out their performances
despite the expected resistance from the
second-year men. The "sophs" say that the
"ireshies" will be permitted to go about
town with their procession, colored lights
and fireworks, but they will not be al
lowed to reach the campus, the place
where the speeches are ordinarily made
and the coffin burned. Secret committees
of arraugemets have been appointed bj
the freshman president and collectors are
going the rounds gathering in the assess
ment for the celebration. The date of the
"burial" has not yet been set, but it is ex
pected that the freshmen will announce it
for some time next week, as the weeks fol
lowing will be given up to examinations.

ALAMEDA REPUBLICANS.
Large Attendance to Discuss the
â¢ Question of Prima
ries.
Justice Morris' Buggy Stolenâ An
Resident Stricken With
Paralysis.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 15.â 1t is diffi
cult for the Republican voters to know
just where they "are at." E. K. Taylor,
chairman of the TMrd Congressional com
mittee, has refused to recognize the re
sults of either open or joint club prima
ries. At the Republican meeting in Lin
derman Opera-house this evening he stated
that his appointees to the Congressional
Convention in Sacramento would be E. B.
Mastick, Henry Sevening, Joseph R.
Knowland and W. H. Davis.
He said that of the eighty-three dele
gates forming this convention no less than
fifty-three would be appointed, the remain
ing thirty being elected by primaries. He
claims that three methods of selection
have been in vogue in the past: First, ap
pointment; second, direct election; third,
selection by a convention, the members of
which are elected by primaries. He has
been in favor, and is still in favor, of elec
tion by primaries if a common working
basis could be arrived at. When he and
W. Morrison declined to vote any longer
with Mr. Earl, they did it to relieve the
deadlocx existing, and on the distinct un
derstanding that each committeeman was
to be responsible for his appointees, and
not the committee as a whole.
He was quite willing then to allow the
Republican clubs to select the delegates
and he would have confirmed their selec
tion if they could have agree on a common
working plan. This he would have done
to relieve the hiatus and keep a harmony
among the clubs. But he refused to allow
any one club or committee from it to
dictate who should be the delegates at the
expense of the others and then shoulder
the responsibility. Therefore as no fair
system had been arrived at he had ac
cepted the inevitable and appointed these
gentleman.
E. B. Mastick belongs to no club, Henry
Sevening and Joseph K. Knowland are
members of the Republican Club, W. H.
Davis is attached to the Regular Republi
can Club and belongs to the Veteran Re
publican Club. Mr. Taylor also said that
the persons elected by the primaries on
Saturday would not go to the convention
in Sacramento, but only to Oakland to the
county convention and this convention
would select the delegates to go to Sacra
mento, "y-^. r : -y.'-:'ji'
At last night's meeting about 100 were
present, and the Hon. G. R. Miller was
selected as the fifth nominee.
A motion being made that the selection
be approved, Mackie objected, but his ob- j
jection was overruled. The matter being
nut to a vote, the ayes and noe3 were
found to be equal, and no decision was ar
rived at. Some desultory talk ensued,
which ended in Mackie's moving that the
club instruct the executive committee to .
make arrangements to hold primaries.
Mr. yon Schmidt made a plea for union
among Republicans.
I. P. Allan was opposed to anything like
a centralization of power, ami recom
mended calmness and deliberation.
Mr. Hunt contended that there was no
necessity for the holding of primaries, see
ing that the regulars had withdrawn. He |
moved that the club indorse the nominees.
A point of order raised by Mr. Mackie
was overruled, and Mr. Hunt's motion
carried without a dissenting voice.
Henry Koppitz Stricken.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. April 15.â Henry
Koppitz, an old resident, was stricken

DEATH OF S. A. HOWARD.
A Wealthy Woodland 3lnn Passes Away
at the Grand Hotel. ,
S. A. Howard, one of the early residents of
Woodland, died about 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon at the Grand Hotel, in this City.
Mr. Howard, about two weeks ago, went
from Woodland to Highland Springs, Lake
County, for treatment.
He did not get any better there, though
he had careful medical attention ail the
time. It was decided, therefore, to bring
him back to this City and also to try and
get him home. It was believed that once
at home he would improve. Joseph Craig,
the proprietor of Highland Springs, and
Dr. W. Kellogg, who lives at tne springs,
came down with the ailing man. He was
able to ride to the hotel in a streetcar and
walked in, almost as well as any one appar
ently with the exception of what appeared
to be a temporary weakness.
Mr. Howard, however, had a complica
tion of ailments and he rapidly grew
worse. Dr. J. O. Hirschfelder was* called
in and everything possible was done, but
nothing could save him. Mr. Howard was
a leading Democrat and long prominent
in the politic.' of Yolo County. He was
the owner a l*rge ranch a few miles east
of Woodland. Ho also was a grower and
dealer in livestock. He was about 70 years
old. E. T. Clowe, a relative, came down
from Woodland last night and will take
the remains home to-day.

They will in the convention determine
whether in their judgement such a market
is advisable. If such a proposition is coun
tenanced steps necessary for its establish
ment will be taken.
The convention will be addressed by able
speakers, thoroughly versed with the sys
tem of public markets. All commission or
other merchants dealing in perishable
products are urged to be present.

A PRIMARY THAT
BROKE A RECORD.
This Time It Was the
Record of Honesty and
Freedom.
TWELVE THOUSAND VOTE
At the Regular Kepublican Elec
tion Yesterday Voters Had
Their Way.
CONTESTING TICKETS FAILED.
For Once the Best Elements of the
' Party Flocked Forth to Vote
at a Primary.
Nearly 12,000 Republican votes were
polled yesterday at what was unmistak
ably the cleanest primary ever held in San
Francisco.
The election of yesterday marks new
era in San Francisco Republican politics,
in that no preceding one has ever been so
free from the domination of corrupt bosses
or has so fairly, freely and honestly ex
pressed the wisnes of the voters.
There was another distinctive feature to
the primary of yesterday. It was the un
usual number of men belonging to the
solid business and professional elements
of society who came to the polls to vote.
Primaries of the past have often re
pelled these elements by the character of
the men who controlled them and the cer
tainty that a vote against the "inside"
was thrown away.
Yesterday in every district and especially
in the Western Addition men who never
touch practical politics except on a general
election day formed long lines at the poll
ing-places ana waited for the privilege of
exercising at the fountain of political
power and destiny the most important
privilege of citizenship.
These results followed naturally the en
forcement of the broad, wise and honor
able policy which has been declared by
John D. Spreekels, and in support of
which the county committeemen and all
the strong party influences have com
bined.
The primary of yesterday illustrates the
difference in results between the leader
ship of a man of strong chaiacter, moral
worth and executive ability, who has no
petty selfish ends to serve, and the leader
ship of scheming bosses, who manipulate
only that their selfish and corrupt ends
may be served.
The election passed peacefully, bringing
no disgrace to party or party powers.
Tbe interest was intense, but the ballots
rapidly dropped from 1 to 7 P.M. at the
thirty-six polling-places, unchecked by
rows or high-handed proceedings.. When
night fell there were no loua protestants
crying "frand."
There were contests in three or four dis
tricts, and in these districts the interest
was naturally much intensified, but in no
case did the contesting tickets develop
anywhere near the strength they were ex
pected to show. This result evinced how
fairly the various clubs and factions had
been recognized in the naming of delegates
on the regular tickets.
The tickets elected in all cases bore the
names of loyal supporters of the leader
ship of John D. Spreekels.
The delegates chosen yesterday number
122, the number to which San Francisco is
entitled. Of these 67 are from the Fourth
Congressional District and 55 from that
portion of San Francisco lying within the
Fifth District.
The delegation chosen yesterday is one
of exceptionally high character, and it
will fittingly represent the Republicans of
this city in the work of naming delegates
to the National Convention.
This delegation is the first one to go from
this City to a State Convention in many
years not as the creation of a boss and
created in a back room, but one named in
fact by the people of the districts.
Home rule in district politics is a new
thing, but John D. Spreekels has this year
succeeded in bestowing it. The delega
tion elected yesterday proceeds directly
and wholly from the people, and back of
it is massed more than ninety-nine one
hundredths of the local party.
The provision of two polling-places in
each district was found to have been a
necessary one to accommodate the vote
that became so heavy, not through
stuffing the ballot-boxes, bat through the
provision of a machinery which gave
every voter confidence that his vote would
be honestly counted.
The votes cast aggregate 11,927. The last
returns were received at Republican head
quarters at 11 o'clock last night.
The returns from the polling-places of
the Assembly districts in the Fourth Con
gressional District were canvassed by
County Committeemen John M. Chretien,
Forty-second Assembly District, chair
man; P. J. Walsh, Forty-third, secretary;
Albert Houston, Twenty-eighth; J. N.
Browning. Twenty-ninth; Charles Ber
liner, Thirtieth; Charles C. Clear, Thirty

the Assembly districts in the Fifth Con
gressional District were canvassed by
County Committeemen Charles W. Man
waring (chairman), Thirty-sixth Assembly
District; John Jackson (secretary),Thirty
fourth District; J. 11. Thompson, Thirty
fifth; James Alva Watt, Thirty-seventh;
Grove Ayers, Thirty-eighth, Jesse E.
MarKs, Fortieth, and C. G. Clinch, Forty
first Assembly District.
The returns so canvassed are to be certi
fied to the Congressional committees of
the respective Congressional districts, and
thereon credentials to the State commit
tee will be issued to the delegates elected.
In the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,
Thirtieth, Thirty-first and Thirty-second
districts there were no contests and a
heavy vote was peacefully polled.
There were lively times at the two poll
ing-places of the Thirty-seventh Assembly
District, caused by the appearance of a
ticket in opposition to the regular one.
The second ticket was largely the creation
of Ned Donnelly, and was backed by quite
a large element in the district.
At polling-place No. 1, on Gough and
Fell streets, the fun started early in the
day by the appearance of a long line of
voters. Nearly every vote for a time was
challenged, which engendered much bad
blood. While peace was preserved by the
police at the polls, there were several
rough-and-tumble fights in saloons and
alleys near by.
The same condition of affairs prevailed
at polling-place No. 2, on Oak and Devisa
dero streets, but with less violence. About
3 o'clock, the opposition practically with
drew from the contest. One of the most
amusing incidents of the day occurred
early in the forenoon. The opposition
lined up a long string of voters together
and their ballets began to drop. After a
large number had voted the leaders made
the mortifying discovery that they had
been handed the tickets that they had
intended to defeat. This was a sad blow
to the opposition, as it caused them great
loss.
It was in this district that the voting of
the best elements of the party was
especially noticeable. At the noon hour,
ana especially at the close of business
hours, long lines of business men from
downtown were formed and kept up.
James Alva Watt, the county commit
teeman, had mailed 1000 ballots to voters
and a majority came with their ballots
ready to be dropped. The opposition
poiled but 132 votes.
In the Thirty-eighth Assembly District
there were two tickets in the field, the one
known as the opposition being championed
by S. I. Jacobs and Barney Fromberg.
Jacobs desired to be placed upon the regu
lar ticket, but failed to accomplish his end.
At first he resolved to run independent,
but this being impracticable he secured
the names of Dr. H. L. Curtis, Barney
Frombe.g, J. R. McLean, Peter Jordan
and A. McElroy. In addition to bis own
name he put on the names of E. H. Aigel
tinger and Gas Pohlman, who were on the
regular ticket. It was expected that From
berg, who is a gripman on a Hayes Valley
car line, would poll a large railroad vote,
and Jordan, who is a laborer, would draw
the workingmen's vote.
Jacobs worked hard at polling-place No.
1, at Gough and McAllister strests, all
day, but the regulars were tco strong. At
No. 2, at 1703 Eddy street, the opposi
tion practically gave up the light before 5
o'clock.
Contrary to expectations peace and har
mony reigned in the Thirty-ninth Assem
bly District. The polling-places presented
much the same orderly aspect as they
would upon a regular election day. There
was not even the faintest suggestion of a
contest at either place, but it was remarked
often during the afternoon that the voters
were mostly seen at a primary election for
the first time in San Francisco. Large
numbers of representative, respectable
men cast their ballots.
Voting continued without intermission
of more than a few minutes during the
afternoon. The vote was heavier at Hayes
and Polk streets, where the box was filled.
At the polling-place at 1019 Larkin street
many professional gentlemen dropped in
and cast ballots while inquiring about the
results in other places.
ln the Forty-second District there was
no contest, and yet remarkable interest
was manifested in the election. An ex
ceptionally large vote was cast. At 209
Ellis street, polling-place 1, the line ex
tended around the corner of Mason street
at 1 o'clock, and when the waiting crowd
had voted, business men from the neigh
borhood began to vote. They visited the
booth all day long and voted.
While the voters downtown hurried
away to their business, leaving but a few
loiterers at the polls, a different condition
prevailed at the other end of this district
at 1339 California street. There a large
number of Republicans met and spent the
time in discussing probabilities.
The primary election in the Forty-third
District was distinctively a business-like
matter. Just as soon as the polls opened
voting began, and a stream of voters
passed through the booths until night.
At 128 O'Farrell street a very large num
ber of voters gathered at 1 p. m., the hour
for dinner, and again after working hours
those who could not leave their business
before voted. The polling-place in Cali
fornia Hall, Bush and Powell streets, was
well patronized, and a heavy vote was cast
there.
The Forty-fourth Assembly District was
a surprise to the inhabitants thereof. It
is the usual order of things to have more
or less opposition to every ticket, but pre
vious to the call, County Committeeman
G. Bacigalupi and others made strong and
successful efforts to secure harmony, and
there was no opposition to the regular
ticket. A larger vote than usual was cast,
many going to the polls who heretofore
have taken but little interest in primary
elections.
The Forty-fifth showed no contest, but
instead of it a strong feeling against Super
visor King and Tom O'Brien, which in
creased the vote. County Committeeman
Chandler. William Bates and others con
ducted affairs.
The delegates elected and the vote by
both Assembly districts and polling dis
tricts are as follows :

ST. PAUL IN THE GLASS.
Two Magnificent Windows for
the Chancel of St. Mary's
Church.
The Most Elaborate and Artistic Ef.
fort Ever Made HereâBeauti
fying the Interior.
The Paulist Fathers have begun the reno
vation of St. Mary's Church on California
street, and expect to so completely trans
form the external appearance of the old
building that it will be an ornament to the
City.
For the last two or three days a force of
men have been at work on the two large
chancel windows. The old plain glass
windows hav<s been removed and frames
adapted to stained-glass lights placed in
the open spaces. Already a magnificent
window, presenting a historical picture, is
being erected on the Dupon t-street side of
the chancel, and it is hoped that both the
new windows will be in place by Sunday
next.
These windows are said to have the larg
est single stretches or stained glass with
figures ever made in San Francisco. The
subjects represent on one side the conver
sion of St. Paul on the road to Damascus,
and across the chancel St. Paul preaching
in Athens. In the tirst window the cele
brated painting by Rubens has furnished
the motive, while tor the latter the equally
well-known masterpiece of Raphael has
been chosen. While the grouping and at
titudes of the principal figures have been
carefully preserved the landscape and
other accessories have been freely treated
to conform with the requirements of
stained-glass art.
Tne windows each measure eight feet
across by twenty feet in heigut. They are
divided into three compartments by nar
row mullions. Each center compartment
measures four feet four inches in width in
the glassâ much beyond the usual width
of stained-glass windows. The work has
all the appearance of having been executed
in the best style of modern stained-glass
art. It certainly is a long stride forward
for California, for nothing like it was ever
before attempted here. In the older win
dows of tbe European cathedrals color ef
fects alone were regarded, while at present
the drawing and design are as carefully
studied as in an oil painting. Such care
has been bestowed on the two windows for
the chancel of St. Mary's. The whole
work has been executed in San Francisco,
in the works of John Mallon, by a resident
artist trained in the schools of France, and
been produced under the supervision of
Bryan J. Clinch.
In the picture of St. Paul preaching the
background has been changed from an
Italian .village to the Acropolis of
Athens, the classic outlines of which
harmonize, well with the group of
life - size figures in front. St. Paul
stands erect, with one hand raised, and
around him are gathered the Athenians,
whose expressions and postures are elo
quent of attentiveness, mingled, perhaps,
with curiosity, while something approach
ing awe, or at least a gleam of realization,"
is depicted on more than one of those up
turned, eager countenances.
The Paulist Fathers purpose at an early
date to fill all the windows of their church
with stained glass presenting subjects of
equal merit. These subjects will be drawn
from the missionary history of the Catho
lic church, and one will be used for each
window. At present the subjects selected
are: St. Patrick preaching at Tara, the
seats of the Irish Kings; St. Boniface
preaching to the pagans in Germany, St.
Louis Bertrand as a missionary among the
Indians of North America. St. Francis
Xavier in HinOoostan, St. Augustine, the
illustrious Bishop of Hippo, St. Francis de
Assisi. Other subjects of a similar char
acter will be represented in the remaining
windows, but they have not yet been fully
determined. y~;yyyy
The Paulists are also preparing for the
renovation of the exterior of their church.
All the weather-worn, decayed stone work
will be replaced with galvanized iron, and
the cleaning and painting process will be
extended to the brickwork. This will prac
tically make the time-worn edifice a new
and handsome church building.

BLUSHING BESIDE
MARTIN AND JERRY
Kelly â¢ Mahoney Delegates
. Shamed by the Farce
and Fraud.
RESIGNATIONS LIKELY.
Few Reputable Republicans
Want to Be Tools for Two
Corrupt Bosslets.
LOCAL POWER IS THE GOAL.
The Contest in the Fourth Is the
Effort of Kelly and Mahoney
to Break In.
Kelly and Mahoney's own Congressional
committee of the Fourth District has
before it a job not provided for in the
election call it issued.
It will have to make appointments to
fill several vacancies in its delegation to
Sacramento before convention day, accord
ing to indications that began to appear
yesterday.
There are among the men who were put
on the ticket by Martin and Jerry many
reputable Republicans, who are now
blushing to see their names paraded as
tools of two disreputable tricksters whose
record is so completely infamous. They
wince, too, at the programme of going to
Sacramento as creatures of the most stu
pendous primary fraud ever perpetrated
in any city.
Knowing that not more than 300 legiti
mate votes were cast for them at the rump
primary on Tuesday, they do not proudly
stand forth as representatives of the Re
publican party in its highest work and
hold up to view the seven thousand and
more votes with which the returns were
openly stuffed. Three hundred legitimate
votes and 7000 voted by Martin Kelly and
Jerry Mahoney do not afford the. sort of
credentials that some of these self-respect
ing gentlemen are ready to take and play
that the two politicians who have most
disgraced the party in recent years may
accomplish their own ends. Kelly and
Mahoney raw do not stay on many Re
publican stomachs just now.
The fact that the whole movement was
born in fraud and was given its start by
two forged proxies in the hands of Kelly
and Mahoney is another thing that lessens
the pride with which some of these men
view their position.
Then Kelly and Mahoney placed on I
their ticket several names without consult
ing the men who bore them. One of these,
Dr. J. E. Artigues of the Forty-fourth
District, discovered this use of his name
after the ballots were printed and ordered
his name scratched from the ticket, which
was done on election day.
Republicans yesterday were generally
too much interested in the regular primary
to bestow much thought on the farcical
one of the day before, but comments were
usually accompanied by a laugh and the
opinion that the amazing extent of the
stuffing and the boss-ship of Martin Kelly
and J. 11. Mahoney would relieve the con
testing delegation from being taken very
seriously at Sacramento.
The most interesting fact connected with
the Kelly-Mahoney primary is the one
that the world's election-stuffing record
was broken. In Mahoney's (Forty -second)
district the sixty votes tallied by the aid
of a few repeaters were openly increased
when the noils closed to over GOO, and by
the same simple process of chucking in
enough ballots to make the box look full,
and tallying the desired number of votes
in all the eleven districts, the 7000 was
easily proclaimed.
The delegation with which it proposed
to go to Sacramento and institute a con
test in the Fourth District is wholly the
creation of Kelly ana Mahoney, and this
fact will not be forgotten. Neither will it
be forgotten that the entire motive of
these worthies is to get hold of something
in municipal and legislative politics which
they can use, and their use of politics is of
one weir known sort. Martin Kelly is
now out in the political cold. He has no
patronage to dispense, no officials to tax,
no Supervisors to sell and nothing to
swap with. He is on short grass, being
financially "busted."
Now Kelly is playing about the skirts of
the party trying to get recognized. Even
partial success in the State Convention
would give him prestige, political cred
itors and other sources of strength by
which he would try to get a hold on the
local political machine.
Senator Mahoney likewise makes poli
tics his business, and like Kelly he wants
something to do business with.
Martin Kelly, forlorn but ambitious,
busied himself about *'ie meeting of the
State Central Committee a few weeks ago
in partnership with Mahoney, who was a
member of the committee. On the night
of that day a meeting of the State Central
Committeemen of the Fourth District was
called by Mahoney and Kelly for an hour
or two after the call was sent out. at about
8 p. m. Kelly and Mahoney had their wires
and plans all laid and a Congressional
committee fixed up by Kelly and Mahoney
was nominated by Mahoney.
This committee was appointed, accord
ing to the record, by five of the eleven
committeemen. This was a minority;
but three ot the five votes were proxies,
and two of these, secured and handed to
Mahoney by Kelly, were afterward found
to be forged. Affidavits to this effect were
made by Gustave Melsing and John Mar
tin, whose names were used.
,By this fraud, perpetrated amid the
trickery of a meeting hastily called at
night, the Kelly-Mahoney Congressional
committee which conducted the primary
of Tuesday was created.
Three or four days later a majority of
the State Central Committeemen met and
appointed the regular Congressional com
mittee which delegated to -the County
Committee the conduct of the primary of
yesterday.
The fraudulent committee has been
wholly dominated by Kelly and Mahoney,
and the delegates were named by them.
There has not been even a pretense that
the delegates named represented anybody,
any element or anything, * -.**
The primary and all the machinery at
tending it was wholly a farce and the dele
gation has been as truly appointed oy
Kelly and Mahoney as though the dele

WILDERMAN REPLIES.
He Sends a Communication From Ne
vada City Explaining His Re
'.'JX.'.-'."â  cent Operations.
G.W. Wilderman and P. J. Ayhens, first
and second vice-presidents, respectively,
of the World's Christian Co-operative So
ciety, make the following joint-written
statement, from Nevada City, Cal., relative
to an article which appeared in . The Call
of April 12, tinder the beading "G. \V.
Wilderman's Deal" :
. G. W. Wilderman came to Nevada City Feb
ruary 6 to expert a mining claim purporting
to be owned by John and J. K. Tilton of San
Francisco. On arriving at Nevada City G. W.
Wilderman called at the County Kecorder's
otlice and learned that both properties had
been sold for the taxes and bought in by the
State. â¢ y. â 
Upon further investigation they learned of a
mine superintendent, who had superintended
the last work done on the mine seven years
since, that both properties were forfeited to the
United States Government and were open to
location.
Consequently G. W. Wilderman went out
with two other men as witnesses and located
both claims for said World's Christian Co
operative Society and sampled the ore of the
same. He made nine tests of the ore ana failed
to find a color of gold.
Wilderman also contracted a deed in
escrow for a valuable gravel mine near Ne
vada City; consideration, $12,000. Paid
$000 on same in stock of the corporation, the
balance of the payment to be made from 10
per cent of the gross earnings of the output of
the gravel mine. The deed of escrow was
placed in the Nevada City Bank. Wilderman,
Knowing the present directors were wholly
insolvent and inexperienced in mining, and
three of the directois being women, and the
directors having already voted and advertised
to move the general otlice of the corporation to
Nevada City, on March 30, requested five of
their number in San Francisco to resign and
elect five competent and experienced men in
Nevada City in their stead. This they refused
to do. Consequently G. W. Wildsman tendered
his resignation as president, and director and
organized a corporation of Nevada City and
Grass Valley miners and mining superintend
ents, styled "The Peoples' Co-operative Invest
ment Company."
We claim no property with the aforesaid
corporation here, for we have no connection
with it in name or property: and as to tile
deed here in escrow the owners want it re
turned to them or complied with.
if the Sat, Francisco corporation would only
attend to its legal business and had any
money to do so it would be much better for
them. They are only making a laughing-stock
of said corporation.
Vice-President P. J. Ayhens came up to Ne
vada City, paying his own expenses, to inves
tigate on the same, line as they propose to
have Attorney Collier do. He found every
thing honest and legitimate so far as President
Wilderman whs concerned.
The statement as to Tilton representing the
Cleveland mine as being worth $3,000,000 is
a wild assertion. The property has been the
laughing-stock of tliis county for seven years.
What Ii Depended On,
One day Tom Logan, an Oregon lawyer
and an inveterate wag, was arguing a case
before Chief Justice Greene of the Supreme
Court of what was then the Territory of
Washington, says the Northwest Maga
zine. Opposed to hitn was a backwoods
lawyer named Browne. Logan continu
ally referred to the counsel on the other
side as if his name were spelled "Browny,"
to the evident annoyance of that gentle
man. At last the Judge interfered, re
marking:: y".^.y ' . ""
"Mr. Logan, this gentleman's name is
spelled B-r-o-w-n-e, and is , pronounced
Browne, not Browny. Now, my name is
spelled G-r-e-e-n-e, but you would not pro
nounce it Greeny, would you?"
"That," replied Logan, gravely, but
with a merry twinkle in his eye, "depends
entirely, on how your Honor decides this
case." ;, -..' -jyj'j-y

LOTTERY BOND SWINDLE
One Million Dollars Extorted
From the People of This
Coast.
The Business so Manipulated That the
Victims Can Have No Re
course to Law.
One million dollars' worth of foreign I
bonds at a low estimate are held by the ]
small storekeepers, working girls, clerks j
in stores and others of limited means on
this coast through the false attractions of
a lottery attachment, which is made a
prominent feature in consummating their
sale.
Every bond sold by the agents of these <
firms, several of whom have their head- 1
quarters in this City, returns a net profit |
of 300 per cent, though the purchaser is |
given the impression that he is paying no
more than the face or market value of the j
same. The bonds handled are usually i
those having their money value expressed j
in francs and florins, and the victims are
people who have no knowledge of the 1
monetary difference between the florin j
and franc of Europe and the dollar of this j
Europe.
These bond 3 are sold in groups of four or !
five, comprising as many different securi- j
ties, and the purchaser, in order to induce
him to fall a readier victim, is permitted
to pay for them on the installment plan,
the amount paid each month ranging !
from $2 50 to $20. according to the aggre
gate amount of the purchase.
The bonds are the legal issues of cer
tain Governments of Europe, who find it
necessary to resort to this questionable
means of lottery bonds to raise money
enough to meet the emergencies of the
present, and the payment of them is de
termined by a monthly drawing. The
bonds drawn each month are at once paid
off, the holder receiving their face value,
and perhaps an additional sum as a prize,
the later feature having been incorporated
by the respective Governments in order to
bring about the sale Of the securities, as
these seldom bear interest, or if they do
the interest rate is a very low one, and the
interest-paying bonds offer less attraction
in the shape of prizes.
Groups of these bonds are sold for
amounts ranging from $50 to $1000. A
sample group that is quite commonly sold
in this City is made up as follows: A Ser
vian bond, with a face value of 100 francs,
whose actual market value on the Vienna
Exchange is 34 florins; an Austrian red
cross bond, with a face value of 10 florins
and a market value of 18 florins and 65
kreuzer; a Holland white cross, face value
2 florins and market value 5 florins; an j
Italian red cross, face value 10 lire and
market value 11 florins 50 kreuzer; a Ser
vian bond of 1888, face value 10 francs and
market value 4 floring 25 kreuzer.
These have a total face value of $28 80,
figuring the florin at 40 cents and the franc
and lire each at 20 cents, a liberal allowance
in each case. On the same basis the market
value of these five bonds is $29 36. This
group is Bold for $115. on installments of
$5 a month, thus netting the agents $85 64,
or nearly 300 per cent profit.
In order to effect the sale a plausible
story is usually told to the effect that the
drawing for the bonds sold is soon to take
place and that the holder is almost certain
to win a prize. But the waiting to some
stretches away into the weary months,
and when they are in a discouraged mood
over what they believe to be their bad luck
they are approached by a new emissary of
the bond-dealer and in most cases are
induced to exchange their bonds for secu
rities which are represented to be more
desirable, either by reason of more fre
quent or larger drawings, or by having
larger prize attachments, the victims, of
course, paying an additional sum for the
[ new bonds, and this process is carried on
until they are drained dry or realize that
I they are being swindled.
1 Here is an instance that occurred in this
1 City, the victim only awaking to her mis
fortune when she attempted to reconvert
her holdings into cash. About four years
ago a young lady typewriter purchased a
$00 group of bonds. These &he was subse
| quently induced to exchange for a $"00
I 0UP ' P ay , in of coarse - the difference,
I lhen she became the possessor of a $500
group. The actual cash value of her hold
ing to-day is about $100. Recently she was
in need of a sum of ready money and at
tempted to negotiate her bonds with the
agent who had sold them to her. The best
she could do was to obtain the offer of a
1 loan of $70 on them. Herealter her sav
ings she says, if put into bonds, will buy
Uncle Sam 3, even if they bear only 3 per
j cent, and are devoid of lottery attractions.
Another imposition on the unwary is
worked through the club certificate scheme.
Ten or twenty persons are induced to
purchase jointly as many groups of bonds
as there are members in the club, a certifi
cate being given to each to the effect that
; he is entitled to a one-tenth or one-twen
Â« tieth interest, as the case may be, in the
I entire number of bonds. It is represented
that the chances of winning a big prize is
I thus increased for all interested, and for
I this advantage an additional premium is
: placed on the bonds.
In fact, however, the chances are no
| greater in proportion than if each had pur
chased his group separately. Then any
I member of the club may withdraw hiÂ« in-
I terest from the club by paving up the full
; amount of his share of tne joint holdings
j and thus deprive the other members of
â  tne club from any participation in what
he may chance to win.
i Not an infrequent resort of these pitiless
imposters is to induce the bondholder to
exchange his securities, which still repre
sent some modicum of value, for a lot that
! is almost without any.
