WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9. â The
House bond bill 'with the free roinage sub
stitute for it reported from the Committee
on Fin.ince was to have engaged the atten
tion of the Senate to-day, but a half- hour
speech by Baker (R.) of Kansas in favor of
an application of the Monroe doctrine and
an hour and three-quarters speech by
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada on the financial
question prevented the taking up of the
bond bill until ?o iate an hour that Jones
(D.) of Arkansas preferred to withhold his
opening speech upor. it till to-morrow.
Baker's speech (his first in the Senate
Chamber) had for its text and groundwork
a joint resolution introduced by him de
claring that the extension by any Euro
pean power of its territorial limits on the
Western Hemisphere, wnether by war,
treaty, purchase or otherwise, without the
consent of the United States, will be re
ias an unfriendly act. In his speech
he declared that that position would be
maintained by war if necessary. The
joint resolution was referred to the Com
miitee on Foreign Relation*.
The presentation by Cnllom (R.) of
Illinois of a petition from Chicago on the
subject of naphtha launches was the origin
of a colloquy among Senators, in the
of which Frye (R.) of Maine, chair
man of the Committee on Commerce, to
which the petition was referred, stated
that he had no idea that the committee
would report a bill to bring small naphtha
launches within the requirements of the
::g law as to lights, boats, inspection
of boilers, etc., but that it would report a
b:!l to bring within the requirements of
the iaw naphtha launches engaged in the
transportation of passengers or freight.
\ i as (D.) of Wisconsin introduced a
bill, which wa? referred to the Judiciary
Committee, withdrawing from tbe Su
preme Court of the United States jurisdic
tion of criminal cases not capital and to
transfer them to the United States Court
of Appeals.
In presenting sorre petitions, some favor
ing appropriations for coast defenses.
Daniel (D.) of Virginia expressed the
opinion that tne public apprehensions as
to the danger of the bombardment of
American seaports were overstrained, but
he also expressed the hope that the coun
try would prepare itself for whatever
emergencies might happen. He favored
the passage of Squire's fortification bill.
Chandler (R.)of New Hampshire offered
a resolution, which was agreed to, instruct
ing the Committee on Immigration to in
quire whether legislation is necessary to
prevent the introduction into the United
States of Â»Hens imprisoned in penal insti
tutions of European nations established in
their American possessions.
Baker (R,) of Kansas introduced tbe fol
lowing joint resolution and addressed the
Senate in support of it :
Rctolicd, That the United States of America
will regard it as an unfriendly act for any for
eign power without our consent, by war,
treaty, purchase or otherwise, to extend its
territorial limits in the \W>.-..,- n Hemisphere
on either of the American continents, or to or
over any of the Islands sdjacen i thereto which
this country deems necessary or proper for its
âºelf-preservation. And the United States of
America reserves the right to be the sole judge
of this necessity.
Revived, That the principle herein enunci
ated is founded upon the law ot seli-preserva
tion, which from necessity adheres In and
belongs to every civilized nation as a sover
eign and inalienable right; and this principle
is attested by Washington's farewell address
and President Monroe's ever memorable mes
sage of December 2, 1823.
In closing his speech, the first made by
him in the Senate, Baker declared that the
United States would maintain the position
announced in his resolution by war, if
necessary, in order that peace might come.
"We shall not, he said, "invite or pro
voke war. The justice of our cause will
challenge and command the admiration
of the civilized world ; but if it does come,
we will triumph in a cause which history
will bles?. and when the shock of fierce
iing armies shall be heard no more,
then we shall behold greater America!
united, prosperous and free, still the won
der and marvel of the worM, matchless
uiconquerable."
The joint resolution was sent to the
tttee on Foreign Relations.
At ir> Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada took
! addressed the Senate on the
financial question in general, but par
ticularly on the Elkins and Butler resolu
forbidding the issue of bonds under
private contract. Stewart sharply criticized
the proposal for a popular loan, and said
that bonds had been offered under impos
sible conditions. Htewart ridiculed the
emergency tariff bill as something got up
by the politicians to distract the people, to
muddy tl, (: waters; and he declared that
no amount of trade protection would do
the country any good until silver was ad
mitted to the mints on the same terms as
Bold. The people were crying for work,
not for charity.
"Give the people money," he cried,
"start the wheels of industry, and they
will accumulate wealth beyond parallel."
Stewart spoke for an hour and three
quartera,and then on motion of Jones (D.)
oi Avka-.sas, the public bond bill with the
ver substitute, reported from the
Fiuance Committee, was taken up.
Chandler (K.) of Kew Hampshire asked
The San Francisco Call.
Jones wnether he would not prefer to
make his openinc speech in favor of the
substitute to-morrow.
Jones admitted that he would, with the
understanding that the bill shall come up
to-morrow as the unfinished business.
The Senate thereupon proceeded to ex
ecutive business. At 4:10 the doors were
reopened and the Senate adjourned.
JIDVA If CM O X OUTPOSTS.
Livingston Introduce* a Pointed Reso
lution in the House.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.â For some
reason not apparent en the surface, the
Committee on Kulos did not to-day report
the changes it proposed to make in the
code of the Fifty-first Congress, under
which the House has so far been operating,
although their work has been completed
and is in print. Henderson (R.) of lowa
gave notice that he would make the report
to-morrow.
Livingston (D.) of Georgia asked unani
mous consent for the consideration of the
following concurrent resolution:
ThÃt the President of the United States is
hereby requested to forthwith ascertain
â whether Great Britain Is advancing her out
posts on the territory in dispute between her
colony of British Guiana and the republic of
Venezuela, or is re-enforcing posts heretofore
established with troops, police or ordnance,
and should the President become cognizant of
the fact that a British military or police force
is advancing to invade or re-enforce, or since
ihe 17th day of December last has invaded or
re-enforced posts formerly occupied within said
disputed territory, he demand the immediate
withdrawal of said soldiers and the reduction
of the police force in said territory to a not
greater number than occupied the British out
post on the aioresaid 17th day oi December
1895.
Boutelle (R.) of Maine objected and the
resolution went to the Committee on For
eign Affairs.
Henderson (R.) of lowa Btated that the
Committee on Rules had concluded its
work and would report the new rules to
the House to-morrow for its consideration.
Rising to a question of privilege Bruram
(R.) of Pennsylvania read from a Philadel
phia paper an analysis by its Washington
correspondent of the House vote on the
bond bill, in which it was said that Brurum
was not present and tie was classed as a
dodger. Brumm explained that he had
been called away suddenly that day by a
telegram announcing the probable fatal
illness of his son, hence his failure to vote.
Blue (R.) of Kansas, from the Commit
tee on Appropriations, reported the gen
eral pension bill for the year ending June
30, 1597, and gave notice that he would call
it up after the report of the Committee on
Rules had been disposed of to-morrow.
At 12:25 o'clock the House adjourned
until to-morrow.

ALL. FOR ARBITRATIOX.
Correspondent Korman Obtain* the View
of Stutettnen.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.-Henry
Norman, the special correspondent of the
London Chronicle, cables his paper to-day
as follows:
"The sentiment for arbitration is a ball
wbich once set rolling among a civilized
people cannot be stopped. I take it for
granted that in some manner arbitration
in the Venezuelan dispute is now certain.
Therefore my work here is done. But
that this temporary evil may prove the
germ of a great >;ood. I have desired to
add a fresh impetus to the wider move
ment. Now President Cleveland and Mr.
Olney preserve absolute silence, deeming
their official positions incompatible with
unofficial speech.
"Who, after them, represents the
weightiest influence on American foreign
affairs? Obviously the members of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
and the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs. Accordingly I have been at pains
to-day to learn the opinions of these gen
tlemen, and the results I have obtained
will, I feel assured, be equally gratifying
and potent in England. One member of
the Senate committeeâ Roger Q. Mills of
THE CITY OF DELAGOA AND THE BAY.
! Texasâ l was unable to find; but,
with this single exception, I can pre
sent you with the views of the entire
committee.
"To each member I put this question:
'Would it, in your opinion, De well for the
Governments of the United t-tates and
Great Britain to endeavor to agree upon
the constitution of a permanent court or
tribunal of arbitration to wuich all ques
tions at issue be'wâ > the two Govern
ments, not involving .lationai autonomy,
or honor, should be submitted for decision
when diplomatic negotiations fail?'
"First of course, I called upon Senator
Sherman, the veteran chairman of the
Senate Committee, a man whose career
( and personality have won the profoundest
' regard of bia fellow-citizens, and whose
! words shouid receive deep respect in Eng
land. He replied: 'Yes, you may quote
me as strongly as you like in an aflimative
reply. 1
"When I requested his own words for
publication, he said: 'I am in favor of
the principle of arbitration for all questions
that, do not involve the autonomy of either
of the two countries. I hope that the two
Governments will agree upon such a mode
of settlement for all controversies.'
"Senator Sherman added that in his
opinion Parliament should pass a resolu
tion requiring the Ministry to take steps
in that direction. Then, in turn, I called
upon every member of the committee.
The following opinions wcrp given me by
each, with authority to publish them:
Senator William P. Frye of Maine:
'Two Christian nations so closely allied
and speaking the same language surely
ought not to resort to arms for the settle
ment of any differences involving any
thing less than their sacred national
honor. lam decidedly in favor of arbi
tration.'
"Senator C. K. Davis: 'I should approve
of a convention between the two countries
to the effect that all controversies not in
volving the honor of either or the estab
lished policy of either should be referred
to a tribunal of arbitration, to be consti
tuted by the parties as the controversies
arise so far as the personnel of that trib
unal is concerned, the convention provid
ing, in a general way, that such tribunals
should be established for each particular
case, as the occasion for it might present
itself.'
' 'Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania :
'The principle of arbitration is both wise
and humane, and the adoption of it by
the two great English-speaking nations of
the world would have great influence upon
other civilized nations. It would be well
:at,in:s particular time ior both America
and England to consider the subject seri
ously and practically, and I hope this will
' be done.'
"Senator Shelby M. Cullom: 'The time
has come in the history of the world when
! great nations should settle all contro
versies between them by arbitration and
| not by war. I should rejoice if practical
j steps were taken by both Governments to
; this end.'
"Senator Henry Cabot Lodge: 'I am of
course in favor of settling the Venezuelan
question by arbitration and believe equally
' that all questions which can properly be
| disposed of by arbitration should be dealt
I with in that way by two such nations as
the United States and Great Britain, and
, if possible by some general arrangement.'
"All the foregoing are Republicans; the
| following are Democrats. Senator John
|T. Morgan of Alabama: 'I am in favor of
the principle of international arbitration
in the settlement of disputes that properly
i fall within the purview of that method of
settlement.
"I am in favor of the organization by
consent of what I may call the Christian
powers and of all other powers that ran be
i induced to enter into the agreement of a
| court or board of arbitration to whom the
j Governments would agree that questions
of this sort indicated should be submitted
! after the failure of diplomatic efforts to
settle them, the personnel of such a board
to be selected on each occasion that arises
\ by agreement between the two contending
powers, and failing at such agreement they
i siiould agree upon a neutral power, with
j authority to name the members of the
j board.'
"Senator George Gray of Delaware re
ferred me to bis words which I recently
cabled as covering the question, adding
the assurance of his entire sympathy.
"Senator David Turpie of Indiana: 'I
think the constitution of a tribunal mutu
ally appointed and agreed upon by the
Governments of the United States and
Great Britain, to which disputed questions
between the two powers other than those
relating to their autonomy and national
sovereignty would be of great service, not
only to the two nations interested, but
also that mankind would accept such
action as a model to be followed and
example to be imitated.'
Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia: 'I
would regard it as a great achievement
and in harmony with the aspirations of
the two peoples, their mutual interests
and their closer friendship. All my mind
goes forward to the belief that it would be
well to create such a machine.'
"Except for the accidental absence of
Senator Mills the foregoing are the senti
ments of the entire Senate committee.
"The House Committee on Foreign Af
fairs consists of nine Republicans and six
Democrats. The time at my disposal, the
House having adjourned early, did not
permit me to see each member personally.
Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, the chairman,
is a veteran diplomatist, having been sec
retary of the American embassy in Paris
and for years the Assistant Secretary of
State here. I found him most sympa
thetic. Replying to the foregoing ques
tion, he said: 'It would be the best thing
they could do for the two nations ard for
mankind, and it should, if possible, be
made to imply, if not pledge, their en
deavor to settle all the disputes they have,
not only with one another but. with all
other but with all other nations.'
"I asked him if I might regard him as
expressing the sentiment of the commit
tee, and he said: 'Not onl}' of the com
mittee but of the whole House of Repre
sentatives. For the wise search for right
results we are agreed here. 1
"He told me also how General Grant, the
greatest righting President America ever
had, and whom he accompanied officially
during his European trip, never lost an
opportunity to urge crowned heads and
Prime Ministers to adopt arbitration in
stead of war. President Grant was keenly
interested in the treaty of Washington of
1871, by which all outstanding differences
were arbitrated, and it was chiefly owing
to his zeal that this treaty was brought
about.
"Tne foregoing represents the weightiest
and most important body of opinion that
could possibly be secured in the United
States. In it there is not a single dissent
ing voice. And these are the men to
whose consideration any question between
England and America would be first sub
mitted, and by whose decision the Senate
and House would probably bo guided. It
is impossible to believe that British senti
ment will not be moved to respond to such
rrmarkable unanimity and such en
lightened utterances. If not then the
world will see that America is ahead of
England in the most striking character
istics of a civilized people.
"I must add that the expression of
opinion at the Capitol toward the Chron
icle's work in explaining American senti
ment were of such a cordial nature that
you would not desire me to publicly re
peat them.
"It is cabled to-day tkat the British
Guiana police have occupied the extreme
limits of the territory claimed by Venez
uela. The American Government has
brought heavy pressure to bear to prevent
the Venezuelan Government from com
mitting any overt act and thus precipitat
ing a hostile situation. Therefore it is im
peratively necessary that the British Gov
ernment instantly deny and repudiate
such a monstrous and fatal act as the
armed occupation of territory while the
question of arbitration is pending. My
work here is done. I propose to leave
Washington at once. Tie Sehomburg
line is now abandoned. The English pub
lic, understanilin the American attitude,
has changed its own attitude, and nothing
blocks the way to a prompt settlement,
not only of the Venezuelan, but of all other
matters â and they are numerous â now
pending and creating international discord,
and thereby placing our relations upon an
amicable footing for the future.
"My last words shall be, and they must
surely express British no less than Ameri
can sentiment, that the nation desiring

NAVAL PREPARATION PEOCEEDS
Instructions for Ccmmissioning of TorÂ«
pedo-Destroyers and Mobilization
of Land Forces.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 9.â Dispatches
from Cape Colony continue to dribble in,
but the freshest of them received to-day
was two days old, showing that the tele
graph and cable companies are either
clearing up the accumulation of old busi
ness, or that the Government still refuses
to allow the transmission of news disÂ«
patches.
Much interest is manifested here in the
receipt of intelligence that will show the
attitude of the Hon. Cecil Rhodes, lately
Prime Minister of Cape Colony, who is
strongly suspected of having much to do
with the dispatch of Dr. Jameson's force
to the Transvaal. But until the normal
condition of the telegraphic service is re
sumed, nothing on this point can be stated
definitely, and nothing but speculation
canjbe indulged in.
On the Continent it is openly charged
that not only was Mr. Rhodes fully cog
nizant of the movements of Dr. Jameson,
but that the British Government was also
aware of what was going on. Had the
raid been successful Great Britain, accord
ing to the belief in Europe, would have
stepped in and occupied the country,
ostensibly to protect her subjects, but
really to establish an occupation similar
to that in Egypt, which is tantamount to
the annexation of the country. Aa the
raid resulted in a most miserable fiasco the
British Government is accused of attempt
ing to forestall condemnation by emphat
ically denying any prior knowledge of the
matter and of taking measures to prevent
the departure of the expedition after it
knew it had departed ana nad resulted in
a failure. Of course, these statements are
denied here, and the Government news
papers insist that Mr. Chamberlain, the
Colonial Secretary, has acted throughout
with clean hands.
At any rate it can be said, so far as the
Transvaal is concerned, that the Govern
ment had done everything in its power to
prevent the raid from affecting any more
than possible the relations between Great
Britain and the South African republic.
But that the troubles have affected the
British foreign relations, more particularly
those with Germany, there is no denial.
Since the fact became known that Em
peror William had, before the Jameson
raid, decided to intervene in the Transvaal
the feeling against Germany has greatly
increased in bitterness. The naval prep
arations now being made meet with the
fullest popular approval, and the more
fiery among those who are in favor of war
declare that the time has come for Great
.Britain to assert herself in her might and
teach Germany that she will brook no
interference with her suzerainty in the
Transvaal.
Those of calmer blood hold that court
interference against any hostility toward
Germany will be sufficiently powerful to
prevent an outbreak, but court interference
does not and cannot control the popular
demand, which is decidedly in favor of
warfare.
A dispassionate view of the situation
leads to the belief, however, that the ex
citement will soon die away and matterg
resume their normal condition.
Tne naval preparations, however, are
proceeding apace. In addition to the
flying squadron, which has been ordered
to be put in readiness, instructions were
issued to-day for the immediate commis
sioning of twenty torpedo-destroyers.
All these preparations, together with the
mobilization of the land forces, do not
necessarily mean that there will bÂ« war.
In well-informed circles it is believed that
they simply mean that the Government is
on the alert against any emergency that
may arise, and, should conditions demand
it, it will be ready to strike a swift blow
against any enemy.
The best criterion of the situation is to
be found at the Stock Exchange, where
the tone and prices respond to every touch
of fear or hope. This morning the mar
kets displayed a sanguine tone and consols
advanced from yesterday's closing prices.
Later there was a slight decline, but on
the whole there was an advance as com
pared with the values of yesterday.
Altogether it can be said that there ap
pears to bean improvement in the situa
tion, and unless new and unforeseen^dira-
culties arise it is thoug ht the pending
questions will be settled diplomatically
and not by war.
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State
for the Colonies, nas sent the following
telegram to President Krueger of the South
African republic:
"I have received the command of the
Queen to acquaint you with the fact that
her Majesty has heard with satisfaction
that you have decided to hand over Dr.
Jameson and the other prisoners to the
British authorities. This act will redound
to your credit and your honor, and con
duce to the peace of South Africa. The
harmonious co-operation of the British
and Dutch races is necessary to South Afri
ca's future development and prosperity."

The Novoe Vremya in an article discussing
the Transvaal situation says:
"The attitude of the British Government

tion to po to war. The Transvaal question
will only acquire serious importance if
fresh developments occur which force the
German Emperor to act in conformity

Only Two Thousand Hand Men Yield Vp

LONDON, Exg., Jan. 9.â A dispatch
from Pretoria cays: The Government is
discontented at the reluctance displayed
by the Rand men to disarm. Thirty
thousand of the latter have been armed
and only 2000 men have yielded up their
weapons. The armed Boers in the field
are also impatient.
The Boer leaders have the utmost diffi
culty in restraining their men and the sit
uation at Johannesburg is critical. A
proclamation has just been issued calling
upon all the Rand men to disarm before ii
o'clock on Friday evening on pain of pros
ecution. Those complying will be par
doned, except the leaders of the revolt.
There is a feeling here that the Rhodes
charter will be canceled to prevent further
disorders.
A Johannesburg dispatch to the Times
confirms the report that sympathy with
Dr. Jameson makes the U itlanders re
luctant to disarm, but as it is estimated
that there are 20,000 armed Boers around
the town there is no fear of further rebel
lion. "The shops are reopening," con
tinues the Times' dispatch, "and business
is resuming its normal course."

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.â A special
cable to the Sun from London says:
Great Britain has determined to make
the greatest display of fighting power the
world has ever seen. The fleet will be the
strongest ever assembled under one flag.
Its full composition is not known, but
already seventeen battle-ships or cruisers
and sixteen torpedo-boat catchers have
been ordered to join it. The purpose of
this demonstration may be to resent Em
peror William's recent action or may be a
declaration of England's "come one, "come
all" defiance against the world. It is a
measure which may work for peace or it
may work for war.
Conservative men still regard the mobil
ization of this great fleet as a precaution
ary and political measure rather than es a
war! measure. Germany herself so re
gards it, for the news of its preparation
has not created the sensation in that coun
try it would have otherwise done. It is
doubtful, however, if each day's addition
to the extensive war preparations being
made by Great Britain will any longer be
received with equanimity by the continen
tal countries.
It is now known that orders have been
given to the British naval stations for the
instant equipment for sea of a large num
ber of warships which would not other
wise be read}' for service until .spring.
Every available man in the construction
departments of the great naval stations at
Portsmouth, Chatham and Sheerness is
employed every hour he is able to
work. This, of course, indicates more than
a mere intention to demonstrate by a
naval display England's power and invul
nerability.
TAKI\G AMPLE- MEASURES.
England Proceeding to Reorganize the
Military force.
LONDON, EÂ»G., Jan. B.â The Daily
News will record the activity that is being
displayed by military officers, and will de
clare that certainly complete measures are
being taken to organize the military force,
even to the nomination of a general to
command and the provisional selection of
a staff. It will add that urgent haste is
not being shown, and that only prepara
tions are being made for a possible emer
gency.
The Post will say that one torpedo-boat
destroyer will be allotted to each battle
ship and cruiser belonging to the Channel
fleet und the living squadron. The paper
remarks with significance that Germany
has the stronger flotilla of torpedo-boats,
it being believed that she possesses 112
against Great Britain's 95.
The Post will also say it understands
that the Cabinet has been summoned to
meet on Saturday.
APPLAUDED J-V THE REICHSTAG.
Attitude Assumed in Defense of German
Jntcrestn.
BERLIN, Germany. Jan. 9.â The Reich
stag resumed its sittings to-day after the
holiday recess. Freiherr Yon Berlepsch
made a brief speech introducing the Gov
ernment bill to prevent illegal transac

in any form.
In the course of the debateon the Bonne
bill Count KanitE-Podenzew (Conserva

WELCOMED IN DELAWARE.
Congressman Maguire Made an
Interesting Address on the
Single Tax.
For Two Hours He Told of the Burdens
Caused by Monopoly of
Land.
WILMINGTON', Del., Jan. 9. - Ex-
Judge James G. Maguire of San Francisco
finished his winter tour of lectures on the
single tax in Delaware last night by ad
dressing an audience of 1500 in the opera
house at Newark. The meeting was one
of the most successful he has addressed
here, and was an" encouraging termination
of the series of lectures he has delivered
throughout the State since October. In
fact Judge Maguire was so highly pleased
with the warm reception he received that
he took occasion to refer to hi 3 recent tour
down the State, and expressed his highest
approval of the hospitality of Delaware
people.
During his address on the practical side
of the single tax the main aisles of the
theater were crowded with men, women
and children who were standing. He
spoke for more than two hours, and ex
plained with telling effect the burdens cast
upon the people by land speculation and
land monopoly.
Newark is a manufacturing town, and
the major part of the audience that assem
bled to hear Maguire composed the work
iugmen of the town and farm hands from
adjacent districts. They listened with
earnest attention to his arguments, and
expressed their approval of it by vigorous
handclapping.
At the conclusion of his address the i
chairman of the meeting announced that
Maguire would be glad to shake hands and
talk with any person in the audience. As
a result of this announcement fully half of
the audience flocked toward the stage and
each exchanged greetings with him. This
public reception delayed Mr. Maguire so
long.that be missed the 10:30 express for
Washington, and was compelled to wait
until after midnight to catch a train. The
midnight express from Philadelphia was
stopped at Newark purposely to take him
aboard.
In an interview lie said that his. Con
gressional duties were of such a pressing
nature that he doubted whether he would
be able to come to Delaware to take part in
the single-tax campaign until late in the
spring: or early summer. He expressed sat
isfaction with his reception and said he
felt assured that Delaware would swell
into line for single-tax. The single taxers
having the campaign in Newark in charge
are much encouraged by last night's meet
ing.

j The Story of an Arrangement
With a Syndicate Denied

MR. CARLISLE ACTED WISELY.
In a Letter to Senator Caffery Cleve
land Related His Views on the
Bond Issue.
i
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan, 9.â Senator
Caffery of Louisville to-night made pub
! lie a letter of the President to him which,
! had opportunity presented since Monday,
:he would have incorporated in re
marks which he intended to make in the
i Senate on the bond bill. It reads:
EXECUTIVE Mansion', ) j
Washington, d. c, Jan. 5, 1896. \
My Dear Senator: I have read to-day in the
i Congressional Record the debate in the Senate
! on Friday concerning the financial situation
and bond issues.
I am amazed at the intolerance that leads 'â 
â  even excited partisanship to adopt as a basis
| of attack the unfounded accusations and asser-
tionsof a maliciously mendacious and sensa
tional newspaper.
No banker or financier, nor any other hu
man being, has been invited to visit Washing
ton for the purpose of arranging in any way or
manner for the disposition of bonds to meet
the present or future needs of the gold reserve.
No arrangement of any kind has been made
for the disposition of |such bonds to any syndi
cate, or through "the agency of any syndicate.
No assurance of such a disposal of bonds has
been directly or indirectly given to any person.
In point of fact, a decided leaning toward a
popular loan and advertising for bids has
been plainly exhibited on the part of the ad
ministration at all times when the subject was
under discussion.
Those charged with the responsibility of
maintaining our gold reserve, so far as legisla
tion renders it possible, have anxiously con
ferred with each other, and, as occasion per
mitted, with those having knowledge of finan
cial affairs and present monetary conditions
as to the best and most favorable means of
selling bonds for gold.
The unusual importance of a successful re
sult, if the attempt is again made, ought to be
apparent to every American citizen who be
stows on the subject a moment's patriotic
thought. The Secretary of the Treasury, from
the first moment that the necessity of another
sale of bonds 6eemed to be approaching, de
sired to offer them issued to the people by
public advertisement if they could thus be
successfully disposed of.
After inll consideration, he came to the con
clusion, to which I fully agree, that the amount
of gold in the reserve, being now 920,000,000
more than it was in February last, when a sale
of bonds was made to a syndicate, and other
conditions differing from those then existing,
justify us in offering the bonds now about to be
issued lor sale by popular subscription.
This is the entire matter, and all these par
ticulars could have been easily obtained by
any member of the Senate by simple inquiry.
If Mr. Morgan or any one else reasoning
from his own standpoint brought himself to
the belief that the Government would at length
be constrained to again sell bonds to a syndi
cate, I suppose he would have a perfect right,
if he chose, to take such steps as seemed to him
prudent to put himself in condition to nego
tiate.
I expect an issue of bonds will be advertised
for sale to-morrow and that bids will be in
vited not only for those now allowed by law
Dut for such other and different bonds as Con
gress may authorize during the pendency of
the advertisements.
Not having had an opportunity to confer
with you in person since the present session of
Congress beean, and noticing your participa
tion in the debate of last Friday, I have
thought it not amiss to put you in possession
of the facts and information herein contained.
Yours very truly, Gkover Cleveland.
To the Hon. Donaldson Caffery.

IVniza. Consul-general of the republic &
San Salvador, received a cable message
this evening announcing the failure of
General Antonio Ezeta to iand what he
contends was the most formidable expedi

General Peraza said that he did not be
lieve that there would have been much of
a revolt even if the filibusters had landed,
as their failure to reach this port showed
plainly that they had very few, if any,
sympathizers in Salvador.
It was learned that General Ezeta had
with him a party of over a hundred Mexi

DISAPPEARANCE OF A BROKER.
Benjamin Johnson Short in His Accounts

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 9.âBenja
min Johnson, resident partner of the New
York banking and brokerage firm of Ken
dall & Whitlock, which has an oflice at
Third and Chestnut streets in this city,
has beer, absent from his office since Tues
day and an examination of the books
of the Philadelphia branch developed the
fact to-day that there was something seri
ously wrong with his accounts.
BTue presumption is tnat unfortunate
speculation was the cause of Johnson's
disappearance. W. B. Kendall this after
noon swore out a warrant for Johnson's ar
rest, charging him with embezzling up
ward of $10,000. Johnson suppressed the
true statement to the firm's customers and
kept a private set of books.

MAY GET THE BONDS.
Morgan's Syndicate Expects
to Secure the New
Issue.
TO TAKE ALL OR NONE.
Will Make an Offer So Advanta
geous That Others Can't
Compete.
BUT THE PRICE IS TO BE HIGH.
An Extra Supply of Over Thirty Mil
lions in Gold in Exchange for
Greenbacks.
NEW YORK, X. V., Jan. 9. â From a
subscribing member of J. Pierpont Mor
gan's bond syndicate the following facts
have been obtained:
The syndicate expects to secure the en
tire $100,000,000 4 per cent bonds which are
to be sold by the treasury on February 5.
Mr. Morgan will bid for the entire issue,
and expects to be awarded the entire
$100,000,000. It will take all or none.
The reason for Mr. Morgan's confidence
of entire success is that he will make an
offer so advantageous that no other propo
sition can stand in his way.
This offer is to purchase the entire
$100,000,000, paying principal and premium
in gold, and in addition furnish an amount
in gold equal to one-third of the issue, or
$33,333,33.'} 33 In exchange for greenbacks.
The Government gold reserve will thus
not only be brought up to the recognized
limit, but will have a large surplus for its
protection.
The price which the syndicate will offer
is not exactly known by any one except
Mr. Morgan. It will be considerably more
than ?t 04..., paid last February. This low
premium was paid because of the pro
vision in the contract compelling the syn
dicate to protect the treasury ieserve. No
such contract will be made this time.
Therefore, a higher price will be paid.
The ligure is believed to be $1 OS.
The syndicate is now accumulating gold
from every available source. Members of
the syndicate will be at liberty to make
individual bids beside the syndicate bid.
This is the state of affairs to-day. The
position will probably hold until February
5 without any change of important details.
The President and Secretary of the Treas
ury have no agreement, private or public,
with the syndicate. They Know, however,
what are Mr. Morgan's intentions and
knew them when the public call was
issued.
C Alt 1,181, E JS COXFJIHZXT.
Thinks the. Sew Jiond Issue Will Be a
Stir cess.
WASHINGTON, I). C, Jan. 9.-Secre
tary Carlisle expressed the opinion to-day
that the new bond issue will be a success.
He did not intimate whence the gold would
come, but he spoke with a full knowledge
of the number of inquiries for blank forms
for bids and the informal offers already
made. The mails to-day brought in quite
a number of inquiries for blank forms on
which to make bids, and in some cases
persons desirous of subscribing stated the
amount wanted and the price they would
offer. The figures, of course, are with
held from publication. The bids are re
garded as informal, and where possible,
those making them will be communicated
with and blank forms will be sent, so that
they may comply with all the require
ments and make their bids in regular
shape. A circular letter of instruction to
prospective bidders was issued to-day. It
aays:
The subscriber should state plainly the
amount of bonds desired, the price which he
proposes to pay and the place where the bonds
i should be delivered, which may be the sub
scriber's home or any other more convenient
place.
He should at the same time state whether he
desires to deposit trie amount of his subscrip
tion at the Treasury Department in the city of
Washington or at one of the following sub
treasuries, viz. : New York, Boston, Philadel
phia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, St.
Louis, New Orleans, or San Francisco. Deposits
at said places riust be with exchange on New
York. The bonds will be issued in the follow
in? denominations, viz.: Coupon bondsâ sso,
$100, $500 and 1000; registered bondsâ sso,
$100, Â£500, $1000, $5000 and $10,000.
The blank forms of answer reads:
I hereby propose under the terms of your cir
cular of January 6, 1890, to purchase United
States 4-per-cent thirty-year bonds described
in said circular, of the face value of â¢ dol
lars, and I agree to pay therefore at the rate
of ' and accrued interest per $100. I fur
ther agree upon due notice of the acceptance
of this subscription to deposit the amount
thereof in gold coin or gold certificates with
the United States Assistant Treasurer at
in accordance wtth the terms of said circular.

FOR COAST DEFENSES.
An Expenditure of Tirelre Million Dol-
lars Is Urged.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.â At a
meeting to-day of the Senate Committee
on Coast Defenses, of which Senator
Squire is chairman, it was shown by state
ments made before the committee by offi
cers of the Bureau of Engineers that there
is immediate need by the department of
$2,500,000 to be expended for torpedoes and
torpedo mines and for land defenses. The
discussion of the torpedo system by the
committee demonstrated that the torpe
does are of little value unless they are de
fended by guns, as they can easily be re
moved by an enemy unless protected by
artillery.
In case of a sudden emergency it would
take at least a year, if the appropriations
were made, to produce the material, manu
facture the torpedoes and put them in
place at the principal ports of the United
States. The chief of the engineers advo
cated the expenditure of $12,000,000 during
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897. Tbi3
sum, it is said, would not provide the
money necessary to be expended by the
Ordnance Bureau for guns and gun car
riages, but would cover the cost for em
placements for guns and of torpedoes.
The hearing 13 being conducted in re
gard to the bill introduced in the Senate
by Senator Squire providing for the de
fense of the principal seaports of the coun
try. The committee will resume its in
quiry to-morrow.

WORK FOR WHITE METAL.
Senator Wolcott Tells of the Ef

The Establishment of Closer Relations
Between the Bimetallic
Associations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 0.-Senator
Wolcott of Colorado, who has just re
turned from an extended stay in Europe,
was asked to-day by a reporter what the
bimetallists of Europe were doing,and said
that an international committee of the
International Bimetallic leagues, including
Mr. Alard, Belgian delegate to the Brus
sels conference, and leading bimetair.sts
from England, Austria, Germany and
France, had an important conference re
cently in Paris, and he had several inter
views with its members.
'â¢We have no idea in this country," he
continued, "of the unselfish and important
efforts throughout England and the Con
tinent in favor of the recognition of silver.
There is hardly an intelligent land-owner
in Europe who is not a bimetallist. There
were two important results of the meeting
in Paris. The tirstâ a plan for an
identical resolution on the importance
of international agreement, to be intro
duced simultaneously in the English Par
liament, the French Assembly and the
German Reichstagâ was agreed upon; and
another important result was the estab
lishment of cordial and closer relations
between the bimetallist associations of the
different countries of Europe, notably be
tween France and (Germany. The states
men of France and the manager of the
Bank of France are bimetallista, and pub
lic opinion favors it. The Paris papers,
however, with one or two exceptions, con
trolled by private moneyed interests, are
gold nioncmetallists.
"While bimeiallists abroad are actively
at work, it must nevertheless be admitted
that the prospects of any speedy action are
not favorable. In Germany, where there
has been much hope, the banking element,
aroused by the possibility of action by the
Reichstag, is expending much effort in
favor of the single standard, and its influ
ence is naturally widely felt. Whoever in
vites this country to await European agree
ment before opening our mints to silver
offers no hope of definite relief."
Repulsed by Italian Troops.
ROME, Italy, Jan. 9.â A dispatch from

A Bill Is Filed to Declare the Recent
Contract Void in All Its
Details.
NEW YORK, X. V.. Jan. 9.â United
States District Attorney Macfarlane has
filed a bill of complaint in the United
States Circuit Court in the name of the
United States against the railroad com
panies constituing the joint Traffic Asso
ciation, and on January 17 will make a
motion for an injunction restraining them
from operating under their agreement.
The relief asked in the bill of complaint
is to have the contract between the rail
roads declared null and void, and the par
ties to the contract perpetually enjoined
from operating under it. A temporary in
junction is also asked for in the complaint.
The aereement which was entered intu
on November 19, l *!>:>, between the prin
cipal trunk lines east of the Mississippi
River, included all the lines in affiliation
with them.
By the agreement it was decided that
all competitive traffic passing through,
from or to the western terminal of the
trunk lines should be divided on a pro rata
basis amounting to the dividing of profits
from such traffic.
The railroads parties to the agreement
filed with the Interstate Commerce Com
mission a copy of the agreement, and on
December 27 the commission notified the
Attorney-General that it considered the
agreement a violation of law as stated.
United States District Attorney McFar
lane was tlen requested to rile the action
begun to-day. This action is to test the
validity of the agreement upon its face.
Opposition to the agreement on facts
arising from its actual working cannot be
made, as although the agreement went
into effect the first of the new year it will
be rive or six months before the railways
will have systematized the working
under it.

AT LAWS BENEFIT

NEW YORK. Jan. 9.â The Grand Cen
tral Palace was crowded to overflowing to
night by the friends and admirers of
'â¢Kid" Lavigne. The benefit was given in
honor of his departure for London, where
be will meet Dick Burge at the National
Sporting Clun for $5000 a side. The pro
gramme was excellent.
George Lavigne opened by sparring with
Harry Woods of California. Lavigne re
ceived a rousing reception.
Woods got a lot of punishment in the
first round, the "Kid" giving his left about
the head and body, occasionally varying
the performance by driving in with his
right. Lavigne was again the aggressor
in the second round, showing some very
pretty science in short-arm fighting. The
third anil fourth rounds were rattlers, La
vigne uoing all the fighting and never let
ting upon the Californian.
The final bjut was between Lavigne and
Tommy Kyan of Chicago. Ryan started
off quick, leading for Lavigne's body.
Lavigne stood in, both men putting up
plenty of science. Kyan hit hard all
through the second round. Lavigne stood
up and got in three or four that had plenty
of power behind them. The last two
rounds were repetitions of the others, both
men hitting hard, which pleased the on
lookers, who gave them arousing send-off.

Stubborn Defense Made by a
Woman During a Trial
for Libel.
Lawyers and Judges Denounced, but
the Jury Found Her
Guilty.
RALEIGH, N. C, Jan. 9. â A criminal
trial that will be noted in the jurispru
dence of the State was on here yesterday
in the Superior Court. A woman indicted
for libel defended herself before a Judge
and jury. Mrs. Pattie Arrington was some
years ago divorced from her husband.
Out of this trouble sprung many lawsuits.
A number of lawyers appeared for Mrs.
Arrington in different suit?. Among them
was ex-Judge Spier Whittaker of the Su
perior Court, late chairman of the Demo
cratic State Committee, and now one of
the leading Populists of the State.
Mrs. Arrington began last summer the
publication of a newspaper known as the
Criminal Document. In this she charged
Whitaker of having stolen $1300 from her
by an order he made while Judge in the
case he had appeared in before he was
elected Judge. For this she was indicted.
The trial began yesterday. Not being
able to employ a lawyer Mrs. Arrington
defended herself, and she did it with skill
and ability. She gave ex-Judge AVhitaker
a scorching cross-examination. She went
on the witness-stand and her evidence was
graphic and startling. She got beyond
the control of the court and detailed her
experiences in all her litigation. She de
nounced many of the most prominent
lawyers and Judges in the State as being
guilty of crimes for which they should be
breaking rock in the penitentiary.
It is the first time a woman was indict
ed in this State for this offense. It was
the first time a woman was compelled to
be her own lawyer. The Courthouse was
crowded, and those present seemed to
sympathize witli Mrs. Arrington. There is
another indictment against her for libel
ing the lute Chief Justice William N. H.
Smith in puDlishing in herjpaper after his
death a statement that he had defrauded
her and her children out of their home.
Mrs. Arlington is from one of the oldest
and best families in the State, and her
character is <:<>od. She made a strong
speech to the jury, and at times was im
passioned and eloquent. She frequently
criticized the District Attorney, arid de
nounced parts of his speech as willfully
false. The jury promptly found her
K uilty.

CAMPOS WILL REMAIN
Spain's Cabinet Decides Not
to Accept His Resig
nation.
TO INCREASE THE FORCE.
More Men and Warships Are to
Be Dispatched in Haste
to Cuba.
DEFEAT OF THE INSURGENTS.
Minor Engagements in Which the
Natives Are Said to Have
Been Driven Back.
MADRID, Spain, Jan. 9. â At a Cabinet
council held to-day it was decided not to
accept the resignation of Captain-General
Campos. It was resolved to increase the
military and naval forces in Cuba.
It appears from the tenor of the first part
of the foregoing dispatch that Captain-
General Campos had tendered his resigna
tion. There have been many rumors that
he intended to do so, and also that he
would be replaced. At the political dem
onstration recently held in Havana Gen
eral Campos announced that he would not
resign in face of the enemy.
It is therefore surmised that General
Campos has not actually resigned, but that
the Council lias predetermined not to ac
cept his resignation should he decide upon
retiring from the command in Cuba.
Additional advices to those already re
ported have been received from Havana
concerning recent engagements with the
revolutionary forces. These show very
great activity on the part of the Spanish
army and indicate an important and pos
sibly decisive engagement at an early date.
General Garina Navarro, as already re
ported, recently met and put to flight at
Gunajay the combined forces of Maceoand
Gomez. The assault of the Spanish troops
upon the insurgent forces was so vigorous
and spirited aiul the retreat of the enemy
so precipitous that two companies of Gen
eral Navarro's command pursuing a heavy
contingent of the fleeing rebels were for
quite a long time separated from the main
body of the Spanish army. Some details
of this engagement have already been
given, including the casualties which at
tended it.
After the engagement the Cuban army
fell back to Ceiba. but was forced 10 make
a countermarch because of an attack on
them by the column of General Luque,
who surprised and engaged them during
the night. The Cuban loss in this en
j counter is given as twenty killed and a
I large number wounded. The battle was
for a time very hotly contested. Spanish
General Suarez Valdez arrived with the
troops of his command about the end of
the engagement and contributed to the
dispersing of the rebels.
A fact tending to strengthen the im
pression that a decisive battle is imminent
manifests its-lf in the nearness or prox
imity of the two armies to each other, and
that the generals who recently engaged
Maceo and Gomez and who have followed
them vigorously from the provinces of
Santa Clara and Matanzasare in command
of the troops now hoping daily to engage
the main body of the insurrectionary
column.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 9.â The report
circulated yesterday that a battle had oc
curred near Artemisa is untrue. General
Bratz had an engagement with 2000 rebels
near the Central sugar factory at Lucia.
The fight lasted four hours, and resulted
in the defeat of the insurgents, who were
led by Maceo, Miro, Zayas and Nunez. It
is reported that Miro was wounded. The
rebel loss was eight killed. Thirty-two
horses were captured by the troops.
It is supposed that the rebels were at
tempting to cover the landing of a filibus
tering expedition, as a bark acting in a
suspicious manner was seen hovering off
the coast in that vicinity.
A column under the command of Colonel
Molini has captured, at the point of the
bayonet, a rebel encampment near Alfonso
doce. The insurgents retired to Manjuari.
Their wounded were taken to Cienga.
Their loss is not known.
The Spanish loss was two officers and
several soldiers wounded. The troops cap
tured 120 horses and a quantity cf ammu
nition and medicine. Sixteen horses be
longing to the troops were killed.
A band of rebels attacked the three forts
on the Esperanza Central factory, but
were repulsed by fourteen soldiers com
manded by Lieutenant Navas.
The civil guards who were repairing the
railway line at Navjas repelled a rebel at
tack, wounding their leader, Sanchez, and
killing two of the insurgents.
PHILADELPHIA POLICE CORRUPTION
Evidence as to Purchased Protection for
" Speak Easies " and Policy
Shops.
PHILADELPHIA, PA.,Jan. 9.-The pro
tection by the police of "speak easies" and
policy shops, the brutal conduct of police
men and the discharge of employes from
the city departments because they did
not agree with their superiors, were
brought out this afternoon at the meeting
of the Senatorial investigating committee.
Ex-Policeman George Slook Jr. testified
to having received, together with Special
Officer Martin and other policemen, sums
of money which were paid them for pro
tection by proprietors of "policy shops"
and "speak easies." The witness turther
stated that Martin was indicted in Octo
ber, 1894, for an alleged bribery in Janu
ary, 1892, but that the case against him
was dismissed last month on the ground
that the time for the prosecution had ex
pired by statute limitation. The witness
declared that although Martin is unable to
read or write he is still connected with the
Police Department.

The" date of the wedding has not been de
cided upon, but reports have it that it will
be celebrated in toe near future. The
affair will oe an elaborate one, commen
surate with the wealth and position of the
bride's family.
The wedding of George Pullman Jr. and
Miss Felicite Oglesby, daughter of the
second war Governor of Illinois, is also
soon to take place, and the dual engage
ment may result in a double wedding.

TESTIMOXI Of DOCTORS.
An Interesting Decision That Bears Upon
the Subject.
NEW YORK, >\ V., Jan. 9.â The Court
of Appeals in the case of Mary A. Morris
against the New York, Ontario and West
ern Railroad has rendered an interesting
decision bearing directly on the question
of privileged communications made to doc
tors. The Code of Civil Procedure says
that a doctor shall not be allowed to dis
close any information which he acquired
in attending a patient in a professional
capacity.
Mrs. Morris, in the case decided, sued
the railroad company for injuries received.
At the time of her illness she was attended
by two physicians. She called one, but
when the defendant attempted to call the
other she objected on the ground of privi
leged communication. Her objection waa
sustained and the suit decided in her favor.
The decision, of course, does not alter the
confidential relations of a physician and
his patient where there is only one physi
cian, but where there are two or more
physicians and opinions differ no one of
them can testify without giving the de
fendant in a lawsuit the right to call all
the others.

Prosperity of Colorado.
NEW YORK, X. V., Jan. 9.-John B.
Farish, a prominent mining engineer of
Denver, says that. Colorado has not only
completely recovered from the silver
panic, but has become one of the most
prosperous States in the Union. When it
found that silver was not profitable it
turned its attention to gold-mining, with
the result that last year it produced
$17,000,000 in goldâ an increase in the year
of $6,ooo,oooâ and this year the yield
promises to be much greater. This makes
Colorado the first in rank as a gold-pro
ducer. Cripple Creek, which has recently
become famous, is only one of many
localities where rich gold deposits have
been found.

Missing.
THE ANXIOUS LABORERS.

the Hope of Getting
Paid.
WOLCOTT'S FAMILY WORRIED.
His Wife and Friends Hold to the
Belief That He Is De
ranged.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 9.â Charles Good
fellow, the sewer contractor who owes his
laborers $1400, and whose whereabouts has
not been known during the past two days,
was the cause of considerable excitement
at the City Hall to-day.
The laborers had come thither, no one
knew exactly why. Most of them are
Russians and Portuguese, and they evi
dently thought that they might receive
some information as to the probability of
receiving their wages.
They lounged about in the City Record
er's courtroom during the entire day wait
ing for developments, but none came.
The City Trustees had a conference with
Goodfellow's bondsmen during the day re
garding the completion of the sewer con
tract, there being a small section of the
work to linish up. If Goodfellow does not
reappear his bondsmen will complete the
contract.
There stiil remains about $2500 in charge
of the City Treasurer, which Goodfeliow
was to have received on the final accept
ance of the work. The creditors of the
contractor have garnishced about $1000 of
this.
Reports are about that Goodfellow is
still in town and on a quiet spree, but the {
officers who have the warrant for his ar
rest are unable to iind him.
The woman with whom the contractor |
lived while here says that she does not \
know where he is and appears to be dis- 1
tressed at his desertion of her. She will
go to Sacramen to in the morning, she
says, to return home to her mother.
V. H. WOLCOTT STILZ ABSEST.
His J-'amih/ atid Friends Hold the Belirf
That lie Is Insane.
FRESNO, Cai.., Jan. 9.â Over two weeks
have now elapsed since C. H. AVolcott, the
mir.ins superintendiMit, disappeared while
on a business trip to San Francisco, and
nothing lias yet been heard of him.
Mrs. Wolcott and her* daughter are still
in the city, and they believe that Mr. Wol
i"U has become mentally deranged, duo
to wnrry over unsuccessful business affairs.
A few days ago they received .1 nil
from the Occid ental Hotel in San Fran
cisco, stating that some Christmas pres
ents for them which Mr. Wolcott had or
dered before he left were still there. Mrs.
Wolcott had them shipped to this city
and they proved to be silverware and other
similar articles
It is considered stranse that the missing
man should purchase such things, when it
is known that he was in severe financial
straits. Nothing of any consequence has
developed against the mining superinten
dent to cause him to desert lii.s family in
such an unceremonious manner, and tem
porary insanity seems to t>e the only plaus
ible theory for his disappearance.
A? in all cases of disappearance at pres
ent, some of Wolcott'fl friends think he
has gone to Cripple Creek. But it is diffi
cult to explain why he did not notify his
wife and daughter, to whom he was very
much attached, of the fact. Every effort
is being made to locate him, but as yet not
the slightest trace has been found. "So far
it loots like a hopeless undertakins.

PORTLAND'S YOUNG FIENDS
Two Schoolboys Attempt to
Blow Up the Failing
School.
They Scatter Two Hundred Dynamite
Cartridges About the Yard
and Building.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan 9.â What was evi
dently meant for an attempt to blow up
the Failing School was frustrated by the
timely discovery to-day of about 20U
I dynamite cartridges scattered in the yard
; and about the basement of the school
! buildings.
About the premises the schoolchildren
to-day picked up dozens of cartridges
; which had evidently b en placed around
'â  the -chool for murderous purposes.
Professor Hossiter, principal of the
I school, was advised of the lind, and
i promptly sent for the police. I:i the
I meantime he collected the cartridges from
' the children.
The investigation which followed this
' afternoon disclosed the fact that on Sun
day the powder magazine near Fulton
Park was robbed. The theft was com
â  mined by AVili Kcssler, alias Mount Hood,
1 18 years old, and his accomplice was a
; younger lad named Jim ISackenstos. The
' fact was also developed that the crime
originated in Kesslers mind, and that he
exercised ruuch influence over the younger
I boy.
The boys packed off all the cartridges
they could carry. They scattered them not
I only about the Failing schoolnouse and
grounds, but also beneath the bridges and
: sidewalks in South Portland. One of the
: lads of the school said that the young
| thieves distributed- the cartridges to get
the other boys to explode them. That no
horrible tragedy followed this distribution
! of cartridges is regarded as miraculous.

Fro nt- II awii ii â¢
ASTORIA, Ob., Jan. 9.â The delayed
steamer Rbosina arrived safe after thirteen
j days from Honolulu. Si.c was delayed by
i the weather. The missing steamer Mio
| wera had not been sighted. She brought
Honolulu news to December 26.
Dr. Underwood and J. K. Sheridan,
alias Morrow, charged with conspiracy to
overthrow the Government of Hawaii, had
their preliminary examination on the 231
and were committed for trial. Bail was
refused. The chief witnesses were Paul
Neumann, former attorney for the ex-
Quenn, and Fred Hayselden, proprietor of
Lanai.
The substance of their testimony was
thut the accused had tried to negotiate
with Hayselden and his attorney, Neu
mann, for the cession of the island of
Lanai to a syndicate of sporting men to
make it a Monte Carlo, where races, prize
tights, lotteries and the like could be
carried on. The syndicate would furnish
means to restore the Queen on condition
of her granting the necessary lottery fran
chise. ,
It was proposed to send down a force,
seize the island steamers, transport large
bodies of the Queen's adherents from
Muni and ililo to Oahu and capture the
Government.
The defense took the ground that no
definite plan was formed, and the whole
tiling was but a dream.
The tug Ellen captured the opium
schooner Henrietta, from Victoria, B. C,
with 7400 pounds of opium on board. The
capture was made on the 2:? d, when the
Henrietta was at anchor closs in shore,
six miles north of Waianae plantation.
The master, Anderson, a passenger, C. E.
Gale, and four men are now here in prison.
The Henrietta had been dodging about
the islands for two weeks. Anderson
claims to have put in in distress, having
been driven out of his course to La Paz,
Mex., for which port he was cleared. Hart
well and Thurston are retained for the de
fense of the smugglers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1896.
RECEIVERS REMOVED
Northern Pacific No Longer
Under Bonner and
Mills.
SUCCESSOR APPOINTED, j
A. F. Burleigh the Choice of
Federal Circuit Judge
Gilbert.
OPPOSED AT ST. PAUL OFFICE.
The Court Speaks Highly of the
Other Receivers and Their
Faithfulness.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 9. â Upon re- \
ceiving notice of the removal of the ;
Montana receivers and his own appoint
ment to-day by Federal Circuit Judge j
Gilbert at Helena as their successor, mak
ing him sole receiver of the Northern Pa- ;
cine Railroad for the States of Wash- j
ington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, j
Andrew F. Burleigh appeared in the i
United States Circuit Court and took the j
oath of office and riled a bond in the sura
Of $100,000.
Judge Gilbert's action gives Receiver
Burleigh the whiphandle in the celebrated
railroid fight, empowering him, under the
supervision of the Federal courts, with
the absolute management of the great
property within the four States named.
Concerning the final solution of the
question, which has set at loggerheads
several United States courts, neither Mr.
Burleigh nor any other person concerned
in the Northern Pacific probably could
tell.
Prominent railroad officials here claim
that Burleigh'a appointmeut, which gives
him many additional powers, by Judge
Gilbert, who continues to ignore Bigelow
and McHenry, the receivers named by
Judge Jenkins, was bitterly opposed in the
general offices at St. Paul, and that the re
port sent out yesterday from Milwaukee
was done for the purpose of influencing
the Circuit Judge not to do that which he
did decree.
As to the proposition of unifying the re
ceivership of the entire Northern Pacitic
road, Burleigh said:
"I understand that the attorneys repre
senting the various parties in the Northern
Pacific litigation have applied to Judges
Field, Harlan, Brewer and Perkham for
an order making a united receivership of
the whole Northern Pacitic property. I
am not advised, however, with what re
sult."
HELENA, Mont.. Jan. P.â Messrs.
Bonr.erand Miller are no longer receivers of
the Northern Pacific Railroad. Andrew
F. Bnrleigh has been made sole receiver
by Judge Gilbert of Portland upon consent
of all parties concerned.
The session of court was very brief, last
ing not more than fifteen minutes. Few
words were said by the attorneys on either
side, but the little that was said counted.
At 10:25 o'clock Judge Gilbert walked
into the courtroom, followed by several
personal friends. When all interested
had had an opportunity to speak, Judge
Gilbert said :
'The affair before us this morning does
not so much concern the personnel of the
receivership as it does the harmonious
management of the road. There are no
imputations cast upon the actions of
Messrs. Bonner and Mills, and I have as
surances that the gentlemen have done
their duty faithfully and well. I have the
utmost respect for Judge Knov-ies and his
action in this matter, but I must say that
I differ from him in regard to the man
agement of the line. I shall therefore set
aside the order appointing Messrs. Bon
ner and Mills and in their stead will ap
point Mr. Burleigh, fixing his bond at
$l(X),000."
A recess was then taken until 2 o'clock.

SAN LUIS OBIsrO, Cai,., Jan. 9. -The

the Board of Supervisors as being extrava
gant and very careless in handling the

The board was in session to-day and re
plied to the action of the Grand Jury by
the adoption of the following resolution:
"It appearing from the report of the
Graod Jury presented in December to the
Superior Court that that body had de
nounced this board for its extravagance in
conducting the affairs of the county and
expending its funds, now, therefore, this
board defies the Grand Jury, and any
member thereof, to produce evidence that
the nuances of the county have not been
handled fairly, honestly and with proper
care and fidelity, and this board hereby
denounces said report as unfair and un
just and not Warranted in fact."

FINE SCHEME OF FKEEZE-OTJT.
Impressive Funeral Ceremony Over
the Remains of Levi Hannah of
the Pomona.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 19.â Still an
other suit was filed in the Superior Court
this morning, making it the fourth one
that Fred W. Swanton has tiled in the past
few weeks against the Santa Cruz Electric
Light and Power Company, James Mc-
Neil, Louise McNeil and James Aitken. 1
In the complaint Mr. Swanton asks that
the assessment upon the capital stock of
the company be annulled, that the com
pany be enjoined from selling the stock
declared delinquent, and that a temporary
injunction issue to-day restraining the
defendant company from carrying out the
delinquent sale advertised for January 9.
Mr. Swanton makes a number of charges
in this complaint, some of which are
quite serious. He claims the assessment
was a scheme to freeze out Mr. Swanton
and his company, plaintiffs, and also al
leges fraud in the voting of the 500 shares
of capital stock alluded to in the previous
suits. It is claimed that McNeil ownad
or controlled almo3t a majority of the cap
ital stock, and in ori'.er to secure a major
ity and freeze out the plaintiffs he had
issued 800 shares of the capital stock ot
the corporation, and these he transferred
to W. D. Hasiam, cashier of the City Bank,
but the transfer was never made upon the
books of the company.
Swanton, as secretary, was persuaded
by McNeil to siâ¢n the transfer under the
pretense that in consideration of the stock
Mr. Ha.clam would carefully keep the
books of the light company. Mr. Swanton
further alleges that the reason for the
transfer was to incline the bank in favor of
McNeil, so that the 500 shares of stock
would be voted as directed by McNeil,
also that the books were kept in such a
manner that it was necessary for an ex
pert to be called in to extricate them.
The complaint also shows that James
McNeil never paid his assessment in United
States gold coin as provided, but that he
assumed the assessments of I. L. Thurber.
Louise R. McNeil and James Aitken, and
had them charged to himself upon the
books of the company. The assumed as
sessments, with McNeil's assessment of
|8092 50, amounted to $10,172, and this
debt he balanced against the same amount
of credits alleged to be due him by the
company.
The complaint states also that James
Aitken is nut a lepally elected director
and that F. \V. Swnnton, as secretary,
never signed the assessment or*der.
This morning Judge Logan issued a
restraining order to McNeil et ai., en
joining them from going on with the de
linquent sale, and ordering them to appear
in court on February 14, to show cause
why they should not be enjoined from
such sale until the determination of the
action.

miners' association for Southern Oregon.
Professor William H. Hampton was

Lewis, who have invested over $100,000 in
ditciies and hydraulic machinery in

"William Ruble, elected vice-president,
belongs to the Pioneer Miners of Oregon,
and is one of our best known and respected
citizens. A. C. Taylor, who occupies the
position of secretary, is one of the most
energetic and widely known young miners
in the State.
The constitution and by-laws adopted
by tne association are almost identical
with those governing the California Mi
ners' Association. It is the sincere desire
of the Southern Oregon association to co
operate with the miners of California in
securing proper National legislation and
take an united stand on the mineral land
question. Among the most prominent of
the members of the executive committee
are: John Bolt, K. M. Hickey, L. W.
Browning, :H. :A. Shorry, A. Stinson,
A. W. Wells and J. F. Stith.
The deliberations of the convention oc
cupied two days and a night. The first
day witnessed considerable turmoil, but
when the meeting was called to order on
the morning of the second day peace bad
spread its wings over the assembled dele
gates.
v The business men of Grants Pass gave a
handsome entertainment Monday night
in honor of the visiting miners. * Before
the closing of the proceedings Tuesday,
the most enthusiastic feeling prevailed,
The roll for membership in the association
was eagerly signed and all necessary steps
taken toward establishing a permanent
office in Grants Pass for the secretary and
rooms for miners.
The next meeting of the association will
take place at the headquarters at Grants
I ass November next. The executive com
mittee will meet the third Monday in Feb

JACKSON MIN ING CLAIMS.
The Better Hope Mine Located
for Charles Peters on
Monday.
H Runs Under a Portion of the Town's
Most Valuable Building
Property.
JACKSON, Cal., Jan. 9.-On Monday
some time the Better Hope mining claim
of Charles Peters wa? located by V. Mon
terichard of Jackson as the Jackson Town
site a nartz- mining claim.
The Better Hope, which is the north
extension of the Good Hope, has been
clair. Â°d by Mr. Peters for many years; in
fact, since the time of its first location
back in the fifties. The mining ground,
or ledge, runs under the townsite patent.
and the northern portion of it is under the
most valuable town property.
At the same time James A Greenwood
located an extensi ort north of the Belter
Hupe. calling it the Jackson Townsite
quartz-mining claim No. 2. This location
is ."00 leer wide and 1500 feet long, parallel
with and under the main street of the
town.
As in all such matters, there in a differ
; ence of opinion among our people as to
j the right of Greenwood to the quartz un
i der the townsite patent; or, rather, as to
| the right of the people who own lots in
the townsite to the mineral which lies un
der them, the patent from the Govern
ment reading: "Subject to the right of
the proprietor of a vein or lode to extract
and remove his ore therefrom, should the
j same be found to penetrate or intersect the
; premises hereby granted, as provided by
! far."
Still, a? mining is our chief industry,
and upon it our prosperity a* a town de
pends, there is liable to be "little objection
to the Greenwood location.
THE NEWS OF STANFORD.
Baseball Prospects Are Not as
Bright as They Have
Been.
Names of the Students Upon Whom
the Various Degrees Were Con
ferred Yesterday.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., Jan.
8. â The baseball prospects for Stanford are
not as bright as thay have been in past
years, owing to the large number of play
firs who graduated last year, or who have
leit the university during the year.
But four of the old Varsity team are on
deck for the start this semester. They
are Pincus '98, Jeffs '98, Young '97 and
Captain MoLaine '96.
There are several men who "subbed"
last season and who will doubtless be able
to make the nine this year. In addition
to these ten new players have announced
their intention of trying for positions ttiis
year. If possible the management will
bring down a coach from San Francisco
to put the boys in condition, and, as the
grounds are to be made ready for play
next .Friday, it begins to look "as though
Stanford meant business.
Cantain William McLaloe, who will
have cbarge of t c team this year, has
played with the nine since his entry in
Stanford with the class of '96. He is one of
the Varsity's best pitchers and strongest
all round players. His major course is
economics and he expects to graduate
this year.
All that Mr. McLaine would say regard
ing his plans was that hard work would
begin next week. There will be rive
practice games each week, and all candi
dates are expected to appear in uniform
on the grounds. No games have yet been
scheduled, bur some outside matches will
be played as soon as possible. If faculty
opposition is removed the team hopes to
make a trip this year.
To-day the following degrees were con
ferred on the students named:
Baenelor of arts : In Latinâ Miss C. M. Gup

HE RAN FOR SUPERINTENDENT.
Sudden Death of Ex-Supervisor Van
Buren Davisâ Robbery of Trenton
Postoffice.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. 9.â Professor
A. C. Abshire has tendered his resignation
to the city Board of Education as a teacher
in the high school. The resignation was
accepted, to take effect to-morrow.
Abshire has been considered a successful
educator, but recent events have clouded
his reputation and handicapped his suc
cess as a teacher.
Last December Abshire filed a petition
in insolvency. His liabilities amount to
$2686 SO. Hfa assets consist of $,'J3<? worth
of exempt personal effects.
His bills are scattered throughout the
county. Most of them are under $100,
while a few range higher. Much of his in
debtedness consists of money borrowed
from nearly all the banks in the countu
and about half his bills are secured.
In view of this predicament of Abshire's
considerable feeling has been raised against
him. He is a youpg man and made an un
successful run during the last campaign
for County Superintendent of Schools on
the Democratic ticket. His condition is
largely due to campaign expenses.

Jh luii.s Kloquently of San Francisco's
Hcnutiea mttl A^Uvntttagrs.
V TLAXp, Or., Jan. 9. â William
Greer Harrison, San Francisco's schoh rly
critic, who is litre, in an extended inter
view on his native City's moral and social
life diplomatically evades con) mi tting him
self regarding the reports of the Bay City's
wickedness.
Mr. Harrison talks enthusiastically ot
tL- women of San Francisco, who, he says,
arc beyond compare.
"The men of San Francisco, taking the
.: generation, are not yet physically
ntally equal to the women," said Mr.
Harrison. There are physical and psychi
cal reasons for thisâ probably a too rapid
ipment, too generous <iiet. and, per
haps, ttÂ»> unlimited supply of coin.
"We shall have poets, painters and art-
SCO, We shall huv
something of a scorn for mere drudgery of
commerce. But native genius of the true
type will build upon ttie Pacific Coast a
city which shall be a combination of an
cient Venice and romantic Florence."
[n answer to a question us io what his
Opinion was of >an Francisco's morals,
Mr. H.ir: son said, that taking into con
sideration the City's cosmopolitan charac
ter, climate, continental humors, and its
generous diet, it has a moral standard
r than any other city in the United
-
"It may be said that an excess of sun
shine and an exceedingly rigid morality
do not quite agree. For myself 1 prefer
"The rich, yet easily digested olive,
fig and almond, and an abundant
sb, washed down by a plenteous
â¢' honest -.vine, you will find, as a
rule, where these conditions obtain,
that women of that land are beautiful;
that the song of that iand is rk-h, and that
convential lines are not rigid. Youwillfind
â¢nen. as well as women, in love with music

passionate lovers of life and nature, ex
tremely unselfish, but not subject to any
great extent to religious dogmas.

CHARITY OF CATHOLICS.
Good Work of St. A'incent'i Society
Among the Poor Irrespective of
Creed or KaoÂ«-.
The particular council, or central com
mittee of St. Vincent de Paul's Society,
met last night in an assembly hall at St.
Mary's Cathedral. The councils of all

t li . - proceedings. Several clergymen, mem
bers of the charitable society, were pres
ent and participated in the discussions.
John M. Burnett occupied the chair.
The question which called out the live
liest and longest debate was that of divia
beqoest araonc the several branches
or councils. Richard Carroll left the so
ciety some money, of which ?45Q0 was in
the treasury awaiting distribution.
â¢ ral of the delegates present argued
in favor of distributing the money in equal
sums to the councils, hut this proposition
â  th rigorous objection from other
parts of the house, where a pro rate basis
v ac upheld with considerable spirit.
After prolonged discussion the meeting
ed to divide the bequest on a pro
rata estimate of the reports of the last
year from parish councils, and by that
means the large and populous parishes
will receive finite handsome stuns for dis
tribution among their deserving poor with
out reterence to creed or race.

GOVERNOR JONES.
The Malignant Cancer Is Liable to
Carry Him Away at Any
Moment.
Governor John E. Jones of Nevada, who
is lying near death at the Palace Hotel,
cannot recover, so his physicians state.
His condition was unchanged yesterday.
The disease is cancer of the stomach, as
was admitted by his physicians and as was
toid in these columns yesterday.
The Governor hay made his will. Sena
tor Williams drew it up, and it was signed
in the presence of the Governor's private
secretary, John G. Hanson, and others.
Governor Jones' two children arrived from
Nevada yesterday morning. There have
been many inquiries as to the Governor's
condition. He has the best attention, but
his demise is regarded as likely to occur at
any time.
It is said all his property will co to his
wife.
The Governor has been in ill-health for
many months. He came to this City early
in the tali, thinking he might get relief by
a change of climate. He knew his disease
was stomach trouble, but did not till lately
know it was cancerous in character. He
expected over a month ago to be able in a
few days to return to Nevada.
Hewasfeelinj temporarily better. Im
mediately afterward he had a relapse, and
he has never fully recovered from it. All
he was able to do was to come down from
his room for an hour or two at a time.

DEATH AND STORM AT SEA.
The Story of the Cruiser Balti
more's Voyage From
Yokohama.
TEN DAYS IN A FURIOUS GALE.
One Officer Lost Overboard and An
other Crushed to Death Against
a Gun.
ASTORIA, Or., Jan. 9.â Advices by the
steamer Rhosina, which arrived from Yo-
Kohama via Honolulu to-day, tell of the
terrific experience of the cruiser Baltimore
from December G to 9 in a typhoon in the
China Sea. The barometer ranged all
around 28.65, and the officers report the
worst weather ever experienced. She ad
vanced not over a mile an hour for three
days. Boatswain's Mate Jessen was washed
overboard and lo&t. Carpenter Cooper was
thrown against one of the big guns and
killed. Seven of the crew were seriously
but not fatally injured. Considerable
slight damages were done to the vessel.
The engines worked to perfection, and
never once getting out of repair daring
the entire struggle. Considering the
weight above the water line the Baltimore
behaved admirably, ana her officers have
only words of praise for her. When the
Rhosina left Honolulu the Baltimore ex-
pected to sail for San Francisco on January
G. iShe was twenty days from Yokohama
to Honolulu.
By the brig W. G. Irwin, Captain Wil
liams, which arrived yesterday, 14 days
from Honolulu, is learned the lull particu
lars of the stormy voyage of the Baltimore
from Yokohama to that port.
"A few more deep rolls and Uncle Sam
would have had one less cruiser on his
navy list, for the Baltimore would have
been at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean."
This was the report of the crew of the
Baltimore given out when the big war
vessel arrived in Honolulu Monday, De
cember 23, after a stormy passage of twenty
days from Yokohama.
"Poor Boatswain's Mate Jessen was
dashed overboard by a heavy sea without
a moment's warning," said a petty officer,
"and Carpenter Cooper was thrown against
an 8-inch rifle and crushed to death.
"The big cruiser was Hung around on
the billows like a feather. Hardly a man,
from the main deck to the lireroom, es
caped without more or less bumps and
bruises. It wa3 awful."
The story of the cruirer's struggle with
the terrible jjale fully tests the seagoing
qualities of the new navy. She left Yoko
hama December '6, and when three days
out struck one of the hardest gales ever
encountered at sea. The barometer
suddenly dropped down, and in a few
minutes the sea was thundering against
her steel sides like ponderous battering
rams.
Everything was made snug fore and aft.
The battery was secured for storm, and
the battle-doors tightly closed.
The great mass of metal was "tossed like
a cork," in the words of one of the officers,
ana occasionally the seas would come
aboard and wash through the passages of
superstructure like a furious flood. Down
in the engine-rooms the motion of the
vessel's plunging was not so apparent as
up above, but the machinists on the plat
form and the firemen feeding the furnaces
were often pitched from their stations by
the spring and heave of the great hull.
Boatswain's Mate Jessen, while engaged
in securing the lashings of a bout that was
breaking loose, was lifted from his place
on the rail and washed overboard by an
unusually wild sea that swept across the
decks. He disappeared in an instant and
was never seen again.
The constant jerking of the rifles
in their fastenings worked the heavy
pieces loose and some of them had to be
removed and the machine-guns placed be
low. Several of the .boats were badly
wrecked by the seas and a number of the
crew were more or less injured by being
thrown by 'he waves against the steel
walls and partitions of the upper works.
The gale finally moderated only to
spring up again more fierce than ever, and
for six days the great cruiser Straggled
With the seas. She was fighting her battle
over again. The hatches, battery, boats
and everything movable were relashed and
secured for a second siege. During this
blow Carpenter Isaac Cooier was thrown
against a gun and crushed.
His skull was fractured, several bones
broken and otherwise fearfully injured.
The battered oflicer never regained con
sciousness, but died in the hospital at
Honolulu the day after the vessel's ar
rival at that port."
Puring the gales all the fires were
lighted and the full strength of the Balti
more's steam capacity tested. With all
tuis great power no perceptible headway
could be maae â she could only he kept bow
on to the sea. But her behavior was
magnificent, and. notwithstanding the
deep, dangerous rol)s which often laid her
decks vertical to the surface of the lunous
ocean, not once did she slip from the control
of her people. She obeyed her helm like
a yacht in a ten-knot breeze and rode the
surges like a big white swan.
When the cruiser came into Honolulu
harbor, on the sunny afternoon of Decem
ber 23, ncr battered and bedraggled ap
pearance told the story of a terrible strug
gle witn an Asiatic gale, even before the
accounts of their twelve days and nights
of storm were given. Captain Day and his
officers were somewhat reticent regarding
the startling details of their perilous pas
sage, but did not hesitate when speaking of
the cool courage and excellent behavior of
the crew while looking their doom, as
they thought, squarely in the face. Equally
warm were they in their praise of the
cruiser which stood the test so well.
The following officers are accredited to
the Baltimore:
B.F. Day, captain; H. O. Rittenhouse, W.
A. Marshall, F. 11. Holmes, A. E. Culvee, A.
D. Hall, C. M. Fahs, lieutenants; G. N. Hay

Carpenter Cooper, who died in the Hon
olulu Hospital of his injuries, was a native
of New Jersey and lirst entered the United
States naval service in June, 1870, receiv
ing his papers as a warrant officer after an
examination before a board of naval con
structors. He was detailed to the Balti
more August, 1893. Boatswain's mate
Jessen was a naval apprentice and a native
of New York.
The United States protected cruiser Balti

phia, her keel having been laid in 1887.
She is 377 feet 6 inches in length, same as
the Philadelphia: breadth of beam, 48
feet G inches: draft, 20 feet 6 inches; dis
placement, 4600 tons. Her engines are
horizontal, triple expansion, with twin

pounder rapid tire puns, two 8-poun.dera
and two 1-pounders, four 37-m. Hotchkiss
guns and two Gntlings. She cost $1,825,000,
and her complement is 36 officers and 350
men. The Baltimore was selected by the
United States Government to carry the
body of Jobn ErioMO to his native" kind,
and while in Sweden the vessel was highly
praised and her otlkrers feted.
She was to have left Honolulu the 6th of
this month, after coaling and repairing the
damages received during the gale.
MORELOUSE BEGINS SUIT
Demands $20,000 Damages From
the Selby Smelting Com
pany.
While Working on a Job of Painting
He Was Almost Killed by Be
fendant's Machinery.
An action for $'_'0,000 damages has been
brought against the Selby Smelting Jand
Lead Company by Attorney John E.
Richards and Messrs. Delmas & Short
ridge on behalf of W. 11. Morehouse,
a painter, who was almost killed in the
defendant's establishment last September.
Morehouse received hia injuries while
working in the rear of the company's gen
eral and assay ollice at 418 Montgomery
street, as one of several men engaged by
Contractor McCarty to paint the wood
work there. It was the last day oi the job,
and soon after Morehouse had gone to
work in the machine-room. A rapidly
revolving shaft constitute! part of the
machinery, and from the shaft protruded
a setscrew a quarter of an inch or more,
which was invisible when the machine
was in motion.
As the unfortunate workman had to go
very close to the shaft his clothing got
caught up by the projecting screw, and lie
was suddenly drugged into the machine,
whirled around the shaft several times
ami dashed against the timbers and up
rights, until finally hurled violently to the
floor. His clothing was literally torn from
his body, and he was frightfully mangled,
bruised and maimed, his skull also being
fractured and his internal injuries being
most excruciating. Morehouse has Iven
under medical care and confined to his
bed ever since, his wife and children hav
ing been deprived of tue necessaries of life
in consequence. His physician says his
injuries are permanent.

SELEY ADMITS HIS GUILT.
The Defaulting Clerk of the Russ
House Makes a Written
Confession.
HE TOOK ALL THE MONEY.
His Career in Becoming a Bigamist
While Disguised by a Black
Beard.
Jules CalJundan of Morse's detective
agency arrived here from San Jose yester
day, having in custody A. W. Seley, who,
on October 29, while clerk at the Russ
House, robbed the safe of $2(350.
Colonel J. S. Young of the hotel, who
had gone down the evening before to iden
tify him, returned on the same train.
Seley was at once placed in a cell in the
City Prison.
While intimating at first that he was
only responsible for part of the money, the
remainder having, as he said, been taken
by some one else, he last night made a full
confession. It is as follows:
Acting under instructions from Colonel J. S.
Young to be careful and protect the coin pack
aces deposited by guests of the Ross House in
the safe I took three packages from the safe,
with the intention of taking them home and
returning them in the morning.
On my wi>y home I took frequent drinks and
became intoxicated. Before reaching home I
missed one of the packages and became
alarmed at the consequences. I failed to re
turn the remaining packages.
My motive in taking the packages was wholly
in the interest of Colone] Young and my fail
ure to return them was from fear of the conse
quences from one being gone. A. \\. Seley.
San Francisco, Jan. 9, 1890.
Witness: J. s. Yotog,
Thomas Kourke.
Seley will plead guilty to the embezzle
ment, so he cays, and will take whatever
penalty is meted out to him. He is now
anxious to get through with it as soon as
possible. When his sentence is served he
may be taken to .Santa Clara County and
prosecuted on two other charges.
One charge is of bigamy, for though he
already had a wife and two children when
he decamped, he afterward met and
courted Miss Ida Shields at Los Gatos, and
was married to her at San Jose by Judge
Maguire a month ago. He then took the
name of Charles Hildreth, by which he
was known at the time of his arrest.
The other offense was forgery. Part of
the embezzlement consisted of a certifi
cate of deposit for $1500. the remaining
$1150 being in cash. When he got short
of cash he forged the name of the man to
whom the certificate belonged, and tried
to get the money. It was this which led
to the knowledge of his whereabouts.
Seley, after he decamped, let his beard
grow. It was thick and black and cov
ered his face, almost to the eyes. He wore
an oid slouch hat, and his friends would
scarcely have recognized him. He is a
machinist and was employed in a little
shot) in San Jose. He and his wife were
living at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John
Young, brother-in-law and sister of Mrs.
Sele\ T . The bride is but 17 years old, and
was plunged in great grief when Seley was
arrested. Seley, in his statement to tiie
officers, claimed that his wife in this City
was the cause of his downfall. He said
she was addicted to stimulants and made
his home miserable.
Of course, no one believes this story
about his motives for taking tue money.
The Pacific Assurance Company, which
had insured Seley to the amount of $1000,
has all along refused to pay this amount
to Colonel Young. The claim was made
that Selcy's guilt was not established. It
is said no effort was made by the com
pany to lind him, and almost none by the
police, though the latter had two pictures
of him. Seley's hearing will probably
take place soon.

SLAPPED SRESPI`S FACE
A Combat That Will Be Fought
Out, Either in Blood
or Ink.
Signor Caglieri Expressed the Con
tempt That Rankled in
His Mind.
Cesare Crespi is as well known in North
Beach as the famous Lola Garabaldini, or
Montgomery avenue itself. He is a knight
of the quill, and his work in journalism
has caused his name to become a proverb
in the Italian quarter.
Crespi makes his voice heard in North
Beach through the medium of the Mes
senger.
Some of the utterances of the Messenger
have led to a strained condition of affairs
between the editor and certain of the
readers of the paper.
And the whole Italian colony is talking
about an encounter which has resulted.
Signor Giorgio Caslier:, an esteemed
member of the Italian colony, was waiting
with his two sons, Dr. Guido Caglieri and
Vittorio Caglieri, for the Union-street car,
when they were joined by Dr. Barsotti and
Signor Splivalo. After a few friendly
words of greeting they all adjourned to the
Quilici and Tofanelli bar to take a glass of
vermouth before dinner.
Immediately after entry Signor Crespi
arrived to partake aJso of a glass of ver
mouth. At the right of Crespi, to quote
the words of L'ltaha, "Signor Caelieri, in
whose soul a sentiment of disdain had j
been growing for some time at seeing his
own name and that of his son. Dr. Guido,
j in the columns of the weekly Journelettc, i
written by the above individual (Crespi), !
coulu not hold himself back from affront- !
mi.- him and venting upon him with con- |
temptuous and energetic words all the ful- i
ness of his disdain."
It seems that Crespi attempted to calm
the rising storm oi Signor Caglieri's
wrath by protesting that he had never j
written a word that could wound the most i
sensitive heart or shock the most delicate !
sensibility. Young Vittorio, who had
been a silent spectator, suddenly seems to
have reached the conclusion that his fath
er's resentment needed some practical I
backing up. Without saying anything he i
went up to Signor Crespi and gave him a \
resounding slap in the face.
Friends intervened and parted the com- i
batants in time to prevent bloodshed.
Sunor Caglieri invited Signor Crespi to
come forth with him, but the invitation \
was declined. Developments are anxiously i
awaited by members of the Italian colony. !

PRIMARY LAW DECISION
The Republican County Commit
tee Quietly Awaiting
This Issue.
PARTY MEN WERE IN COUNCIL.
Held a Short and Brisk Meeting Last
Evening and With Full
Attendance.
The Republican County Committee is at
present holding its activity in reserve until
the pending primary election bill is defi
nitely settled by the Supreme Court.
Last evening the regular monthly meet
ing, owing to the uncertainty of this issue,
was brief and to the point. Although noth
ing of importance was scheduled for dis
cussion, still all but two members were
present.
The following communication was read
and laid on the table to be acted upon at
the next meeting:
Hon. Charles W. Mamearing, Chairman Re
| publican Committee. Cityâ Sir: At a re
cent meeting 01 the executive committee of
the Republican executive council a sub-cor
n mittee was appointed to meet and confer with
j the executive committee of your body. The
secretary was directed to inform you "of this
fact and to arrange with you time and place
for such conference. .Respectfully yours,
J. A. WI'IITESIDES,
Secretary Republican Council.
A communication was also read from the
I secretary and president of the Thirty
i fifth Assembly District Republican Club,
j desiring that if the county committee in
! tended to form a club in that district
the one already formed there would be
recognized as it exists.
The letter read as follows:
Thirty-fifth Assembly District;
Republican Club. j
Charles Manwnring, Chairman Republican Com
mitteeâ Peak sib: Having heard that it is the
! intention, 01 the Republican committee to
: form a Republican club in the Thirty-fifth As
j sembly District we are desirous of calling the
; attention of the committee to the fact that we
, now have and for several months have had a
Republican club in that district. We number
over 300 of the most representative men in the
', district, and hope that you will in forming this
| club disturb us as little as possible.
We would respectfully suggest that you
, recognize us as we now exist, thus showing to
the people of our district that it Is your desire
j to recognize the better element of our party.
While loyal to true Republicanism, we can
not but feel that if not at leiist partially recog
nized, there will be many in the district who
will not take as active a part in the coming
campaign as they otherwise would.
At the time of the organization of our club
we appointed a committee to wait upon the
â  County Committee. And Â«aid committee did
j wait upon you, and, owing to a ruling that
; none but members of the County Committee
I could speak upon the floor, and being without
a written communication, they were unable
| to obtain a hearing ; but at all times we have
i beeu and- now are willing and desirous of
\ working under your direction ami supervision.
Hoping the above will receive your favorable
consideration, we are yours for Republicanism,
V. P. NOBTHBOP, President.
Robert H. Stafford, Secretary.
J. M. Chretien, vice-chairman, said it
was not the intention of the organization
to conflict with any district club, and that,
furthermore, the commitee had Dot in
view the organizingof any club in any dis
trict, and would not do so until a definite
plan of organization was agreed upon.
Upon motion of Mr. Chretien, the letter
was laid on the table to be discussed after
the primary law was decided.
If the decision of this law happens be
fore the next regular monthly meeting of
the committee, then a special meeting will
be called by the chairman aa soon as that
event transpires.

FRIDAY JANUARY 10,1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Salisbury may send the Kaiser an ul
timatum by way of reciprocity.
Cuban independence lies in Havana and
to capture the one is to gain the other.
Arizona and New Mexico should follow
Utah into statehood and follow closely.
A Cleveland bond issue cannot be put
into better odor by calling it a popular
loan.
One of the tilings that speaks loudest at
this time is the way that France is not
talk:;.
Utah should put her young men to the
front in the Senate if she wisbes to come
to the front herself.
The Kaiser could watch. England better
if he did not have to overlook Alsace and
Lorraine in doing it.
Europe has often carried war into Africa,
but this time it looks as if Africa might
carry war into Europe.
It seems certain that as long as Cleve
land is in office the endles? chain of deficits
and bond issues will go on.
With the load Cleveland has piled on it
the Democratic donkey will never have
strength enough to buct him off.
If ever Victoria felt like spanking one of
her grandchildren the time is right BOW
and the fellow's name is William.
In the shuffle of politics Hawaiian
annexation has turned up again in Con
gress and may prove to be trumps.
In the present situation of European
affairs it would seem that if Russia wishes
anything she has only to ask for it.
Talking the funding bill to death would
not be as good as killing it by a decisive
vote, but it will do in an emergency.
While the Kaiser talks as the arbiter of
Europe the world is beginning to pay at
tention to the way the Czar saws wood.
The reports of the recent battles around
Havana make it evident the Spaniards
have succeeded in holding the telegraph
line.
California will have enough to do paying
her share of the Cleveland bonds with
out having to pay funding bill bonds as
well.
The third-term movement doesn t make
much progress, but it makes more than
any other movement in the Democratic
camp.
The Senate should remember that in
speaking of the emergency tariff bill the
emphasis should always be put on t tie emer
gency.
The war flurry will not be without its
pood effects, for it has inclined the Senate
to favor large appropriations for coast
defenses.
The Philadelphia streetcar men are talk
ins of another walkout and of course
everybody in the city has to get ready to
walk also.
A British Minister sent to German Po
land would be a good enough recognition
of the favor of a German Minister in the
Transvaal.
The one consoling feature of the politi
cal situation is that the people will have a
chance to vote on Clevelandism before the
year is over.
To the Democratic party Clevelandism
is like a porous plaster that was easy to
put on but won't come off again without
taking the hide with it.
Jefferson Democracy was very good De
mocracy and Jackson Democracy was fair,
but Cleveland Democracy is very poor De
mocracy and that's why the Democrats
swear.
General Campos complains the Cubans
never stop long enough to be overtaken,
but he forgets he never stopped himself
until he got the intrenchments around
Havana.
The speakers who had to respond to the
toast to Cleveland at the Jackson banquets
must have had some difficulty in refrain
ing from the old quotation about Hyperion
and the Satyr.
The notable feature of the Democratic
banquets on Jackson's day was t!ie attempt
of the cuckoo orators to put Cleveland in
Jackson's shoes without losing him dur
ing the operation.
As it is reported from London that
peace in the Transvaal is assured the war
ships and troops which England is send
ing to the Cape are probably intended
only to celebrate it.
The Government is having much better
success with big guns than with armor
plate, and war promises to continue more
favorable to those who do the shooting
than to those who are shot at.
It is true the relations between England
and Germany are very much strained, but
then it must be remembered that diplo
macy is elastic and can be stretched a long
way before it comes to a rupture.
The efforts of Senator Perkins and
others to make the emergency tariff a
genuine protective measure are good in
themselves, but with, Cleveland in the
White House they cau avail uotluQg.
A STEOUG MEMORIAL.
The memorial addressed to Congress by
the Committee of Fifty makes the follow
ing main points: That the earnings of
the aided lines which might have been
applied to the Government debt were
wrongfully and dishonestly withheld and
diverted and thai a funding of the debt by
Congress would be a condoning of that
act ; that an extension of the debt at a
rate of 2 per cent would require the pay
ment by the aided companies of about
$100,000,000 in fifty years; that increased
charges for transportation would have to
bo made, and that this would fall princi
pally upon the industries of California;
that the plain, speedy and rational solu
tion oi the matter would be the foreclosure
of the Government's mortgage and the en
forcement of the lien on the private assets
of the surviving partner in the case of the
Central Pacilic if it should be found that
the estates of the deceased members can
not be reached; that the first- mortgage
bonds were not issued according to law
and, hence, that the lirst mortgage does
not take priority over the Government's
mortgage: that among the assets which
would be affected by proceedings in fore
closure is the Southern Pacilic Railroad
south of Gilroy an<i Alcalde, because it
was built on the credit and with the earn
ings of the Central Pacilic Railroad, such
earnings being diverted from their proper
use in extinguishing the Government debt;
that, under all these circumstances, the
passage of a funding act would stultify the
Government, condone illegal and disnonest
acts of wide notoriety and bring shame
upon the Congress of the United States.
The memorial contains no trace either of
bitterness or a spirit of injustice. It is an
earnest demand for an intelligent handling
of a great problem affecting the destiny of
the country and a plea to the Govern
ment to save California from the ruin
which a funding measure \vou!d bring.
Perhaps it is a knowledge that the case
which the opponents of the funding bill
are ready to make out is incontrovertible
that has decided the Senate and House
Committees on Railroads to shut out ar
guments before them when the bills are
taken up. That need not prove dismay
ing, for the great battle will be fought on
tne lioor of the houses when the bills come
up for passage.
In the arguments there to be made the
proponents of the bill should be forced to
show that it will be possible for the com
panies to pay the principal and accruing
interest in iifty years. This has suddenly
become one of the most important features
oi the matter. The ocean is free; there
can never be a monopoly of the Cape Horn
route. Such an advance of rates as will be
necessary to raise the required revenue
would leave so large a margin of profit for
ships sent round the Horn that we may ue
sure they would be put on without delay,
ana so prevent the raising of the required
funds.
For that matter, the Panama Railway is
not owned by Mr. Huntington, and it will
never submit to such a raising of tariffs as
will build up the Cape Horn traffic at the
expense of the isthmian line. Let the
supporters of the measure show that the
rates can be advanced sufficiently without
destroying the money-earning capacity of
the roads and the issue will then be
clearer.
BEAVE POOL-SELLERS.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare, having ob
served that the downtown pool-sellers are
not keeping faith with him, and that they
are unwilling to wait a judicial determina
tion of the cases which he has already be
gun, has reopened his campaign against
them and proceeded witli arrests for viola
tions of the Ellert ordinance.
It is not likely that the poolroom men
would feel BO sure of their position did
they not have the support of a branch of
the municipal government over which the
onifial prosecutors of offenses against the
law have no control. The Solid Eight of
the Board of Supervisors have a broad
wing of protection which Mr. Dare is un
able to clip. They have gone so far as to
pas< tue omnibus pool ordinance to print,
which means the last step they can
take if the measure is intended merely as a
threat. Possibly they will pass the ordi
nance and so put a stop to the strong stim
ulus which has spurred horse-breeding in
California and placed the State in the
lead in this important industry.
A large majority of the men who have
sought the office of Supervisor of San
Francisco and betrayed their trust after
election never had a reputation to lose.
Professional boodlers, the tools of corrupt
political bosses, have no ulterior ambition.
With them the oflice of Supervisor is
merely a transient opportunity to make
money, not the beginning of a bright po
litical career. Such men never come from
the higher walks of life. Were they of
that kind they would never be selected for
otlice by the bosses, with whom they share
their plunder. Such men care nothing for
the condemnation which they receive- from
newspapers, ministers of religion and or
ganizations of public-spirited citizens.
Their public career is intended to end with
the expiration of their term of office and
they can then retire with a comfortable
fort vine and take the world easy.
It is the election of such men that makes
poolrooms possible, burdens the City with
grievous taxes, permits disgraceful public
work and causes a surrender of the streets
to rich and grasping corporations. These
things and more will continue so long as
decent citizens are willing for the affairs of
the City to be conducted by unscrupulous
bosses.
REFOBMS IN PUNEEALS.
The man of intelligence and pluck who
persistently sticks to a light which he be-
Jieves to be right and which bears an as
pect of common-sense on its face is reason
ably sure to win in the end. It is of such
stuff that the "crank" is made, but if the
influence of that energetic person were re
moved the wheels of progress would re
volve with painful slowness. The time
was when Henry Bergh, the "cranky" Ger
man who could not bear to see horses mal
treated, was a butt of ridicule for the
whole great city of New York. To-day
his name is blessed throughout the land,
and a spirit of compassion for helpless
and useful domestic beasts has added a
luster to the torch of American civilization.
A very interesting man of this type is
now visiting San Francisco. He i& Cap
tain George A. Raabe, and his one aim in
life is to educate men out of the practice of
removing the hat at funerals. He con
fines his missionary work principally to
benevolent societies, whose general cus
tom is to bare the head while laying a
dead comrade away. It did not require
Captain Raabe to inform us that the prac
tice does not recommend itself to the most
primitive human judgment; that bald
ness, so prevalent among men, and the
fashion of cutting the hair, make the bar
ing of the head outdoors, even in fair
weather, a perilous thing and an invita
tion to serious results if trie weather be
bad. We knew that already ; but we real
ize how helpless we are under the iron
hand of custom until some strong spirit
steps forth and leads us to the light.
Captain Raabe might have gone further,
but he doubtless knows by instinct (as ail
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1896.
successful reformers know) that the
simpler a fight the easier it may be won.
That he will win there can be no doubt,
though long and hard .years are yet ahead
of him. After him may come another who
will make a similar campaign against the
custom of inexperienced bearers of burdenÃ
running risk of serious injury by carrying
heavy caskets. This is gradually passing
away in the older communities, but the re
form has hardly made an impression in
California. It is a proper showing of re
spect and affection to have pallbearers, but
the rational application of the sentiment
is to make them serve merely in an honor
ary capacity, and have trained men to
bear the casket. Such bearers would com
mit no blunders and sustain no injuries.
THE JACKSON DAY SPEECHES.
If the speeches made at the Democratic
banquets on Jackson day are signs of the
drift of things in that party the third
term movement may be accounted as one
of the important issues in our politics. All
the speeches worthy of reporting were lit
tle more than laudations of Cleveland.
Xo other living Democrat seems to have
been named, and even the memory of the
hero of New Orleans was almost ignored
in the eagerness of the speakers to express
their loyalty to the man from Buffalo.
It is significant that the committees in
charee of the banquets in the larger East
ern cities selected members of the Cabinet
to deliver the principal speeches. Secre
tary Herbert spoke in New York and
Secretary Smith in Philadelphia. Both
declared Jackson to be a "sound-money
Democrat," and placed Cleveland upon the
same pedestal as a party leader and a Pres
ident equally worthy of Democratic admi
ration and popular support. The tenor of
the two addresses waa identical, and even
in the language used there is a striking
resemblance, it was as if both had been
carefully prepared beforehand and a stud
ied sentiment agreed upon, though of
course that was not necessary, for while
there are many cuckoos there is but one
note to the cuckoos' song.
The speeches are the more remarkable
by contrast with those delivered at the
.luoksun banquets of the last and the pre
ceding year. This year the more notable
gatherings were those of the Eastern cities.
Last year and the year before it was the
voice of the Mississippi Valley that spoke
loudest and clearest. Addresses were
made in Chicago and in Cincinnati that
distinctly repudiated Cleveland and
showed a tendency among leading Demo
crats to break away from the goldbug,
bond-issuing administration. Then Cleve
land was not placed on the pedestal with
Jackson. On the contrary, he was de
nounced as a violator of all Democratic
traditions, an opponent of the welfare of
the people, an ally of the banking
power against which Jackson fought, and
false to every principle of Jacksouian
Democracy.
The change in the tone of the speeches
of this year seems to imply a change in
the sentiment of the party. The cuckoos
are now shouting vigorously, while their
opponeuts are dumb. There were many
factions of Democracy that denounced
Cleveland a year or more ago, but none of
them show any head against him now.
Tammany, in the person of Senator Hill,
and the silver Democrats, in the person of
Senator Vest, have spoken as apologists
for him in the Senate. Opposition to him
undoubtedly exists among the leaders and
in the ranks of Democracy, but everywhere
it has been reduced to a sullen silence.
There is, in fact, no longer a Democratic
party. A Cleveland party has usurped its
place and name, and the third-term move
ment, which the intelligence of the coun
try has so long refused to regard as any
thing serious, has now assumed propor
tions that can no longer be overlooked or
ignored in any study of our political con
ditions.
PETEOLEUM TOR. FUEL.
The launching of the tank-oil steamer
George Loomia Wednesday means a great
deal to San Francisco. The steamer,
though small, can lay down 300,000 barrels
of oil in the City a month, and as the
charge for transportation will be much
lower than that imposed by the railroad
the cost of the oil as fuel will be consid
erably less than the coals which now
constitute our main dependence. The
oil is to come from the wells of
Ventura, where a development of this
rich native source of wealth has been re
cently made. Summerland particularly
has suddenly become famous for its abund
ant oil deposits, and capital is flowing into
the town. Besides this source of supply
are the oil wells of Los Angeles. In both
cases it will be a simple matter to run the
oil to the coast in pipes a"nd transport it
thence in tank vessels at very small ex
pense.
Both ends of the State will receive the
benefits arising from the development of
this oil deposit. The introduction of oil
as a manufacturing fuel will be neces
sarily a slow process, as more or less ex
pensive alterations will have to be made
in boilers; but the adoption of the cheap
and efficient fuel by a manufacturer
in one line will compel his competitors to
follow his example, and so the business
will be built up. A considerable reduc
tion of the cost of manufacturing fuel
makes the competition of California manu
facturers with their Eastern rivals, who
have so firm a hold on the local iield, a
simple matter.
While this is going on with regard to oil
the railroad from Stockton to the coal de
posit of Corral Hollow is steadily creeping
across the plains and bringing: nearer and
nearer the day when a good manufacturing
coal can be laid down in San Francisco for
about $2 50 a ton. As Eastern manufac
turers get coal for less than $1 a ton there
is still a disadvantage, but it is more than
offset by the cost of laying down articles
of Eastern manufacture in this market.
The tank steamer, the southern oil wells,
the Corral Hollow Kail road, and the prac
tically inexhaustible deposit of good man
ufacturing coal which it will tap, combine
to make a very bright picture for Cali
fornia.
At the same time, the railroad to the
coal mine cannot produce its best results
in the absence of improved water facilities
between Stockton and San Francisco. The
influences which are operating at Wash
ington in favor of the railroad funding
bill and against the Nicaragua canal are
also opposed to an appropriation for the
improvement of the navigable rivers of
California. That opposition has been con
strued as an effort to keep the inland
traffic in the hands of the present mo
nopoly and indirectly to cripple the eili
ciency of the Valley road. It is well for
all these matters to be kept in minu,
although none of them affects the very
gratifying outlook which the launching of
the Loomis presents.
Hoke Smith says President Jackson was
a champion of sound money, and the
world, remembering the money he stood
for included both silver and gold, admits
that for once Mr. Smith has deviated into
the truth.
Before many years pass Alaska will be
the only territorial region we have, but
that is big enough to last a loug time,
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"There is no brand of slang so hard to under
stand as political slang," said Police Judge
Campbell while conversing on that subject in
the corridors of the City Hall recently. "I
heard a good story on Jim O'Brien recently in
which political vernacular played a most im
portant part. It happened some time during
the last election, when. Jim waa keeping his

eyes open on the rounders and watching the
general layout. He got into his buggy early
iv the morning, and, bidding Mrs. O'Brien
good-by lor the day, told her he could not be
home until late in the afternoon as there was
some'job on foot that required the closest at
tention.
"Along about noon there was a loud knock
at the front door of tne O'Brien residence, and
Mrs. O'Brien went to see who It was. Imagine
her surprise upon opening the door to see a
tough-looking ward-striker standing on the
steps.
" 'Is Jim in ?' he inquired with a rich Bow
ery brogue.
" 'lie is not and I do not expect him home
until late in the afternoon,' responded Mrs.
O'Brien, politely.
" 'Well, if you can git word to 'em give him
de tipdat de gang is goin' to knife him in de
Tirty-fourt' .Ward. See?'
"'I beg your pardon, sir. I do not under
stand you,' exclaimed the politician's wife, in
alarm.
" 'You don't ? Why dey are goln' to glv' 'im

where he is.'
" 'Cut his throat?'
" 'Dats what. Dey ain't goin' to do not'in'
to 'im but kill him dead. .Now, dats right.
See?'
" 'But, sir, you do not mean that any harm
will come to him ? asked the lady, now thor
oughly frightened at the prospect of her hus
band's danger. 'Cannot something be done to
find him?'
" 'Cert. Dats what I'm here fer. I just
wants to tip do game off to 'im, so he will be
next. See? I ain't trowing no time away in
dis game, but if Jim don't keep his eye pealed
dey will trow de knife into his ribs and twist
it. See?' With that he made a clumsy bow
and swaggered off, leaving Mrs. O'Brien in a
very excited frame of mind. She closed the
door mechanically and went back to dress her
self for the street, with the intention of finding
Jim immediately to save him from the knife of
the opposition. When she was about ready to
go out there was a sound on the front porch as
though several people were walking. 'There
they are bringing Jim's body back. lam too
late. They have knifed him at the Thirty
fourth Ward,' she soliloquized in agony, and
Instantly flew to the front door to Bee if there
was enough life left in Jim for him to recognize
her.
"Jim had returned unexpectedly with some
friends, and at lunch all hands took a turn at
explaining that the 'knife,' the 'gaff' and the
political 'twist' waa not serious unless admin
istered by both parties. I guess it is not neces
sary for me to finish this story, gentlemen; you
all understand what the heeler meant."
General Josiah Howell, who had the honor
of leading the Fourth Brigade of tne California
National Guard for nine years, having been
commissioned by Governor Low and Governor
Haight, is again sojourning in this State.
Most of the time since 1883 he has resided at
Sydney, N. S. W., as the representative in Aus
tralia of the New York Life Insurance Com
pany.
"Sydney is a charming place," said General
Howell yesterday, "aud counting its 6uburbs
is about the size of San Francisco. It is now
midsummer there, but the weather does not
become oppressively hot. Yes, electricity is ex
tpnsively used in Sydney to lightstores, hotels,
otlices and dwellings and to propel streetcars.
Cable-eara are in use as well as steam trani
wavs. The cost of riding in the streetcars
between points within the city proper 13 less
than it is in Ban Francisco, but for
suburban rides extending a distance of three
miles or more the service costs more. The city
is divided into sections, and the tickets contain
sectional coupons. For a mile 6eotion one can
get a ride for a cents, but for the distance of
five miles the charge is 10 cents.
"There is no tax in Sydney on real estate.
Revenue is raised by a stamD tax on checks
and receipts. The system resembles our old
form of the internal-revenue tax on bank
checks. The water supply, which is abundant,
is owned by the municipality and managed by
a Board of Water Commissioners which taxes
the houses supplied. The Fire Department of
Sydney, I should say, is not as active or efficient
as the department in San Francisco.
"The people over there are great for holidays.
There is a half-holiday on every Saturday, and
on Good Friday a holiday begins which lasts
until the following Tuesday. All stores and
offices are closed, and business is entirely sus
pended. The people of Sydney are great play
goers. Places of amusement are generously
patronized, and as for the races everybody
goes to them.
"The people over there seem to get more en
joyment out of life than the Americans get in
this country. The pressure of business is
lighter and social hospitalities are not neg
lected. The climate is delightful and the
suburban scenery of Sydney surpassinglylbeau

TAKE RECIPROCITY OUT OF POLI
TICS.
The present is a good time to have a general
rally for reciprocity, one so far-reaching and
emphatic that it Khali be taken out of politics.
The country has just rallied, in Congress and
out, to the support of the President under the
standard of the Monroe doctrine. The Repub
licans stand by the President in a grandly non
partisan way, and the Democrats would do
well to reciprocate by upholding reciprocity.
The Chicago Record oÂ£ yesterday morning
comes out strongly in favor of reciprocity.
This is very tignilJcant, for that is a mugwump
paper, its Democratic leanings being due to its
espousal of free trade. The paper has no other
bond of Democratic sympathy. When, there
fore, the Record urges the passage of the Beach
bill, the reasonable inference is that the free
traders are preuared to abandon the anti
reciprocity ground taken in 1892 and incor
porated into the Wilson-Gorman tariff.
The Record begins its leader of yesterday
with the observation, "One good move in the
present Congress is that in the direction of the
revival of reciprocity legislation." The argu
ment made in support of this proposition is not
remarkable, one way or the other, the position
itself being the significant fact in the case.
The argument for reciprocity is put more
cogently by Mr. Allertou in a published letter
to Congressman Cannon than it is in the
editorial, for he is specially familiar with the
chief bad effect of repeal. Mf. Allerton Is one
of the leading packers and cattle dealers in
Chicago, or was during his more active busi
ness life. He has withdrawn 1 somewhat from
practical affairs, but for many years he has been
one of the kings of the livestock market. He
asserts that the repeal of reciprocity decreased
the shipments of live cattle for export more
than one-hall and the dressed-beef shipments
to 560,000 head of cattle. Here are the essen
tial paragraphs of the letter:
Restoring the tariff will not furnish immediate
relief to the Government. It will check the Im
portation of foreign goods until the importer has
sold out, then he will be clamoring again for free
trade. Restore reciprocity, open the marietta of
the world for our < at tl.-, hog products and canned
goods, remembering that we can 1,000,000 heart
of cattle a year and thai 80 per cent of these goods
are shipped abroad. Franco and Germany have
put an excessively high tariff on these goods, mak
ing it almost prohibitory, and, besides this, have
prohibited our pork products and cattle, claiming
that they were diseased. thr> fucts are that I
and many others havo snipped live cattle for a
numnerof years and have never lost one single
steer by disease.
Since the repeal of reciprocity, although there
are less hogs and 600,000 less cattle than In 1893
cattle aud hogs have dropped $1 a hundred. The
foreign exchange is made south and west of the
Alleg!iÂ«Â»nle8. llestore reciprocityâ the farmers'
â¢pro.iucts will increase in value and will be shipped
abroad nnd immediate help will be given the Gov
ernment if we can export to the markets of the
world.
If this feature of legislation can be once taken
out of politics it is hardly possible that the
American people would ever consent to putting
it in again. It should be placed on the same
high plane as the Stonroe doctrine. â Chicago

The Sutro Road-a. S. City. The Sutro road
it is expected, will be in operation in a short

not been in operation before this. The one Is
that it was decided not to put it in operation

islied, fitted up and ready for opening; and sec
ond, the injunction issued on the prayer of the
Kniarhts of Pythias, preventing the ears from

ground, has been a source of delay.
Divincâ ll. L. F., Arcata, Humboldt County
Cal. Â» Experiments with a diving-bell in Ports
mouth harbor, X. 11., on a clear day, with an
unruffled sen, demonstrated the fact that at a
depth of . seventy-two feet there . was light
enough to enable fhe diver to read coarse
print. The greatest depth to which a diver
has ever been is 204 feet, when the pressure on
the bell was equal to 88' 2 pounds to the square
inch. A man in a .'diving dress cannot go be
low thirty feet with safety. It a man can read

ticulars, many of them important. It is dis
tinctly Episcopal, and its work, which is
definite, is "for the spread of Christ's kingdom
among young women" and "the active sup
port of "the rector's plans in the parish in
which a chapter may be located." The King's

Without a Countryâ "Puzzled," City. Tha
question "If a boy was born on a pirate ship
when he became of age what steps would he
have to take to become a citizen of the United
States?" is one that cannot be answered as it
would require a legal decision, and there is
none to cover such r case. A pirate ship being
an outlaw has uo flag that is recognized by
civilized nations, consequently a boy born on
a vessel that has no flag has no country ; he 19
a human being without any legal standing In
any part of the world. If he wanted to become
a citizen of the United States he could not "re
nounce allegiance and fidelity to any foreign
prince or state," not having any such allegi
ance and fidelity and never having been a citi
zenof any country. Attorney* to whom the
question has been submitted were of the opin
ion that the man could not become a citizen
of the United States.
The ViÃQiNiugâ S., City. The steamer
Virginias left the United States t without legal
papers, but .she never "was recognized by the
United States asa filibuster." October, 1573, the
steamer, flying tne American flag, was seized
by the Tornado, a Spanish man-of-war, on sus
picion of bearing a filibustering expedition to
aid the Cuban insurgents. News reached this
country that fifty-four of the crew and passen
gers had been executed. The United States
Government through President Grant made a
demand on the Spanish Government for a
restoration of the vessel and for the return of
the survivors to the protection .of the United
States, for a salute to the flag and lor the
punishment of the offending parties. The
Cubans claimed that the vessel did not have
the right to carry the American flag. After
much diplomatic intercourse Seflretary Fish on
November 27 agreed that if the vessel and sur
vivors were immediately given up .the United
States would without delay institute Inquiries
concerning the validity, of the papers of the
Virginius, and If Spain could before. December
25, 1873, give satisfactory evidence that tho
vessel had been carrying the United States flag
without authority for doing so, the salute to
the flag which had been demanded would bo
dispensed with. On December 10 the Spanish
Minister -presented a mass of evidence which
satisfied Secretary Fish, and he admitted that
the claim of the Cubans was correct as to the
flag. The vessel was surrendered, but found
ered on the way over when near Cape Fear.

MEAD FIRES HOT SHOT
The Secretary of the Manufac
turers Replies to James
Sproule.
FIGHTING OVER PROF. SMITH'
A Demand to Have a Director Re
moved From the Investigating
Committee.
L. R. Mead, secretary of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, does
not propose to sit quietly by and permit
Director James Sproule to assert that the
affairs of the association have been mis
managed and neglected; more than that
Mr. Mead is radically opposed to having
Mr. Sproule' s friend. Professor Emory
Smith, late of Stanford University, being
put into the association as manager of the
organization.
The trouble started a week or two ago,
when it became rumored among the di
rectors that Mr. Sproule was making an
effort to oust Mead and his assistants from
the office and put his friend Emory Smith
in to manage the affairs. The first public
indication that there was discord in the
ranks was on Tuesday, at the meeting of
the directors, when Sproule requested that
the directors co into secret session â 'â¢exec
utive" session, as he termed it. Several of
the directors opposed secret sessions, but
bis request was respected and the repre
sentatives of the press left the room.
The secret session was short, but long
enough for Jlr. Sproule to make a speech,
in which, it is said, he advocated a change
in the management of the association and
that a manager be employed to run the
business, lie made a failure, for his mo
tion was so amended that the substitute
bore no resemblance to the oiiginal mo
tion. By ttie amendment the chair was
directed to appoint a committee of three
to investigate the work ot the association
in the past and the efficiency of the man
aeement. On this committee were ap
pointed James Sproule, M. J.Keller and
\V. V. Bowers.
Even the substitute failed to remove the
sting of Sproule's dart. Secretary Mead
had in his pocket a letter from Sproule
that caused him anything but pleasure.
The principal feature of that letter Mr.
Mead regarded as a reflection upon him,
and how far he was correct may be judged
from the letter itseif, which reads:
â¢ â¢ â¢ Without any prejudice whatever to
your good self, for whom 1 have the greatest
respectâ both personally and in a business
wayâ l must say. with all possible emphasis,
that I am in favor of a radical change in
the detail management of our association's
affairs. We are languishing, and with the
limited time at your disposal to keep hold of
matters it is. more necessary now than ever be
fore to resolve our affairs into a state of perma
nent efficiency.
Looking around for o man in whose ability,
energy and foresightedness, in whom J, for
one, could have confidence, I have not been
able to locate any mure suitable man than
Emory E. Smith, who, I believe, has been to i-ee
you and quite a number of the directors of the
association. We. need a manager to take full
charge ol matters und<r the direction ol the
board â a man who will be every hour of the
day on deck, with the interests of the associa
tion solely In mind and in hand.
I shall give the gentleman named such earn
est advocacy as 1 believe the needs of the asso
ciation and his eligibility warrant.
Mr. Mead took all this with as much
f race as the circumstances would permit,
ut he pave vent to iiis feelings yesterday
upon reading a published interview witii
Mr. SprouJe. In the interview the latter
says that he has no personal feeling
against the former, nor iy he making a
canvass for Professor Smith in particular
for the position of manager. Mr. Sproule
was reported as saying:
My resolution was an expression of my be
lief that the association was in need of some
person who could devote all his time to
the advancement of the interests of tiie as
sociation. â¢ * * The difficulty lay in the
fact that Mr. Mead did not have time to attend
to the affairs of the association as I believe
they should be attended to. Mr. Mead has
often told me that he could not spare the time
to personally attend to the association busi
ness.
This aroused the secretary's ire. Mr.
Mead said yesterday:
I do not know how Mr. Pproule got his infor
mation that I have not the time to attend to
the business of the association. Since I have
been the secretary of this organization, I have
giveti ail the time that was required to the
affairs, as the association has been my hobby.
It is not necessary for me to sit in the office ten
hours a day. Mr. I'ingle, the assistant secre
tary, attends to ihe routine and detail matters,
but 1 know of everything of importance that is
being done, and I direct all the business. One
time I did tell Mr. Soroule that I did not have
the time to attend to a projected matter that
would have required the services of a corps of
clerks.
1 am not at all pleased that lie should accuse
me oi neglecting my duties, for that is practi
cally wlint his resolution and interview means.
I claim, with some pride, that the association's
affairs have been managed remarkably well,
considering the means we have had at o'nr dis
posal. Ido not receive any compensation for
my services as secretary, and the others in the
office are not overpaid.
There is another matter that I am going to
| bring before the president, Mr. Scott, Mr.
! Sproule practically made charges that the
affairs are mismanaged and neglected, yot Mr.
Scott put him on the investigating committee.
To this I will protest, as J object lo taring Mr.
Sproule act as the complainant and then sit as
a juror on my crsc. I have sent President
Scott the following letter:
Ran Francisco, January 9, 1896.
JTenry T. Scott Esq., President Manvfrxcturer*'
and Producer? AK"Â»-iation â Dkar Sik: At a meet
ing of the t>oard of directors of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association of California, held at
this office on January 7, Mr. James Sproule offered
the following resolution:
Resolved, That n committee of three be appointed
by he chair to consider and report at an early day
upon the advisability of employing a munager.who
shall receive instructions from and be responsible
to the board of directors; and also, If possible, to
nominate a man jor the position who can oe
secured at a salary within the means of the associa
tion and assume office at the pleasure of the board.
To which, after being seconded, Mr. M. J. Keller
offered an amendment as follows:
)>".if"i. That the chair appoint a committee of
three to investlcate the work of the association in
Hie pa.it, tie efficiency of the management, and to
recommend plans lookin;?to a renewal of the work.
VVnicli amendment was adopted by the boanl of
directors.
Under this resolution you appointed a commit
tee, consisting of Messrs. M. J. Keller, Janus
Sproule and W. K. Ron era. to make the investiga
tion culled for In the amended resolution.
Ah this Investigation should be judicial In Its
character and impartial I deem it important that
the members of this committee should be not only
active and thoroughly well informed, but abso
lutely Impartial to the end that the best interests
of the association may be promoted. I think I am
fully Justified in unking you to reconsider your ap
pointment of James Sproule as a member of that
committee, 1 shall presume that the work of this
committee is intended to be and indeed It ought to
be impartial ana fair, and I am persuaded that Air.
Sproule is too strongly biased to jcive this work im
partial consideration.
I think 1 have a right to make this assertion from
the conduct of Mr. .Sproule, which lias become a
matter of record with this association, and 1 there
fore request that you rec insider this appointment
and put in Air. Hproule's place on this committee
an impartial and fair-minded man. Awaiting your
reply I am very truly yours, 1,. K. Si in..
So much for the charges and insinuations oi
Mr. .-proule and the matter of having him re
moved from the committee. Now an to Mr.
Sproule'l protege. He declares that lie is not
particularly interested in Professor Smith.
Look at the letter he wrote to me, in which he
says. "I shall give the gentleiiran named (Pro
fessor Smith) men earnest advocacy as 1 be
lieve the needs of the association "and his
(â¢legibility warrant." Does not that look
as though he whs making Smith's fight? 1
periously question Professor Smith's ability to
till the position of manager. I'rofessor Smith
is, no doubt, a scientific gentleman, because in
was professor of the agricultural department
at trie Stanford University ; but we require a
business man and not a scientific farmer to
manage this association. We want live, active
men, Mich as we have at presentâ men famil
iar with tin? ways of the business and manu
facturing world.
To sum it up, it looks to me as though Pro
fessor Smith had got oui of a position at Stan
ford University and wants to get in here at a
salary of $250 to $Â»00 a month, and he got his
friend Sproule to make his right. I would not
object to their makiug Â»n ordinary applica
tion for a position, but 1 do protest against
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1896.
any one charging neglect to the present man
agement in order to make a clean sweep of
this office so as to place Professor Smith In
Charge. Sproule talks ol radical change being
necessary, vet Professor Smith,, when asked
what change be had to suggest, acknowledged
that he had none. It looks to me that he sim
ply wants the place and Sproule wants him to
bare it. If any one can fill this position better
than the present occupant of the office I will
make no objections to a change, but I will
tight any attempt to clean out the ollice so as
to make a place for Mr. Sproule's friend.
SUED BY CREDITORS.
S. 11. Collins, the Jeweler, Attached
on Notes Aggregating a Large
Amount.
The jewelry-store of S. H. Collins, 227
Kearny street, was attached yesterday on
claims aggregating $27,0 0. Collins made
an assignment on the 2a inst. to Arthur
Judis for the benefit of his creditors, and
was permitted to carry on his business, but
since then some of those to whom he is in
debted for large amounts have become
dissatisfied at the state of affairs.
The creditors who have begun suit are:
S. T. Bernhard, who holds, as executor of
bia father's estate, a note for $3000, and
Henry Meyer, who has Collins' note for
$24,000. The latter transferred his claims
to a clerk in the office of the attorneys
who have charire of the case.
Bern hard : s reason for beginning suit is,
principally, that he was not consulted by
Collins lit the time that the assignment to
.ludiswas made. That of Meyers is that
the assignment is not in accordance with
the law, which provides that such an act,
to be legal, must be made to the Sheriff.
Collins claims to have ample assets to pay
dollar for dollar, if only allowed sufficient
time in which to meet his obligations,
which altogether amount 10 about $.iO, OOO.
Neither of the attaching creditors has
any fault to tind with the assignee, but
they are dissatislied for the reasons already
stated.
TROUBLE OVER AN ESTATE
Heirs at Law of Cornelius King
Want Some of the Money
That Was Left.
Will Fight the Two Nephews to Whom
the Eccentric Old Man Willed
Everything.
Another big will contest was put well
under way yesterday. It was precipitated
by the death on January 4 of J. B. Fargo,
administrator of the estate of Cornelius
King. At once the heirs at law and the
heirs under the will became active.
James and Daniel King, brothers and
nephews of Cornelius King, had been
made soie heirs of the estate by the old
man, who also made them sole executors
of the estate. They gave way to J. B.
Fargo. On his death the two boys peti
tioned to be made administrators of the
estate, James being represented by Blake
& Harrison and Daniel by Knight & Heg
gerty.
Kate Sullivan of Watsonville, a sister of
the deceased, yesterday asked for letters of
administration for herself. She is repre
sented by Sullivan & Sullivan. At the
same time she joined the other heirs in
asking that Public Administrator Freese
be allowed to handle the estate. This was
to be her second choice.
There are seven of these other heirs, all
of whom are non-residents. Florence
Carey King, Daniel King, Kate Riordan,
Denis Kinc and Michael King are repre
sented by Walter H. Levy, Kothchild &
Acb and Joseph P. Kelly. Florence Carey
Kine Jr. and Mary Bfacii&do are repre
sented by buKivan ft Sullivan and George
P. Burke.
The estate in contest amounts to $214,
--000 in cash deposited in various banks in
San Francisco. The grounds for breaking
the will will be unboundness of mind and
undue influence.
Cornelius King died in the insane asylum
at Napa on July 24, 1894. He was a char
acter. He made his money buying and
selling second-hand barrels, and would
often roll an old barrel down the street to
his shop to save expressase. He specu
lated sometimes, but bought no land,
having a mania for piling up cash.
About 18! X) he was assaulted by a foot
pad and was severely beaten about the
iiead. This left him totally deaf and his
eccentricities increased. Owing to his
deafness he was continually fearful that
some one was preparing to make another
assault upon him. Thiseventually affected
his mind, and when, in 18130, he tired sev
eral shots at a man, he was sent to Napa.
Several years previous to the assault
which unbalanced him he had made a will
leaving all his property to his two nephews.
This, it is claimed, was practically the
same as another will he made five years
bpfore that.
There is promise of a long and hard
fought litigation.
SALMON-FISHERS ARRESTED.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Capture
Two Men and Their Outfit.*.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Davis and
Steams made a raid recently upon illegal
salmon-tishers on the Bouldin Island
drifts and captured two boats,. GOO
fathoms of three-mesh nets, a lot of sal
mon and four men. The regular fishermen
on those drifts do not cause the' deputies
any trouble, as they conform to the law
and use only 7%-inch mesh net?, and in
several years but one man has been ar
rested there for illegal fishing.
Several days ago word was received that
parties from the outside were fishing on
the drifts with three-mesh nets and tak
ing all kinds of fish. Davis and Steams
started out with the launch, and when
they arrived within si{,'ht of the drifts
made a run for the outsiders. No sooner
did the latter recognize the launch than
they began to throw their fish overboard
by the hundred pounds. One boatload of
fishermen was so successful as to escape
after abandoning their nets and throwing
the catch away. The other two boats were
not so successful and the four fishers were
placed under arrest. A letter received at
the Fish Commission rooms in this City
states that the regular fishermen who ob
serve the law are pleased at the capture.
Reports from the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers are to the effect that the
run of salmon up those waterways is larger
than for years past. Those familiar with
fish statistics say that the run is the larg
est in twenty years.
A Popular Railway Man Dies.
The railway aeents in this city received
black-bordered letters yesterday from the Den
ver and Kio Grande Railway, announcing the
death of Captain W. F. Tibbltt, traveling pas
senger agent of that line, ip Denver. Captain
Tibbits held the position of traveling passen
ger agent of the Denver and Rio Grande for
eighteen years, and was one of the best-known
railway men west of the Mississippi. To most
of the San Francisco passenger agents he was
an old and intimate friend frum whom many
courtesies were received, and to travelers a
most obliging official. He died January 4.
He Was Disinherited.

There WaÂ» no Quorum.
Considerable business lay upon the table

meeting went over until to-day.
CIGAR STANDS MUST GO
Harbor Commissioners Have De
termined to Remove All
Obstructions.
THE NEW FERRY DEPOT AGAIN.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald Is Not
Ready Yet for the Con
ference.
The Harbor Commissioners have finally
decided that everything in the shape of
cigar and fruit stands, offices in which bal
last men rrake their headquarters, and
those in which dealers in brick transact
their business must be moved from ytate
property. There will be no exception to
this rule, and while ali will be given time
to move, they will be informed at the same
time that no pull can save them.
When the board met yesterday a num
ber of those who have been using space on
THE FRUITSTAND ON THE BULKHEAD BETWEEN CLAY AND WASHINGTON
STREETS THAT WILL BE REMOVED BY ORDER OF THE HARBOR
COMMISSIONERS EARLY NEXT AIOATH.
the water front free of charge were nres
ent. They were not permitted to stsre
their case, as President Colnon ruled them
out of order. In doing so he explained
that the board would be as lenient as pos
sible with all who had stands on the State
property. "There is no intention," said
he, "of forcing everybody to move at
once. Thirty days' notice will be given to
one and all, and where it would involve a
hardship to insist on the thirty-day limit
further time will be given. Everybody
must move, however, as the board has de
termined to rid the water front of all un
necessary obstructions."
"Hitherto the water front seems to have
been owned by everybody and anybody,"
said Commissioner Chadb'ourne. '"Adver
tisers have nspd the State buildings to suit
their own purposes, and anybody who
wanted to set up a cigar or fruit stand has
chosen his own location and occupied it.
The sooner this state of affairs is stopped
the better. The water front is for the use
of the shipping, and everything not di
rectly connected with that will be re
moved."
Aniong the Protestants was John Mc-
Laughlin, who has a cigar-stand adjoining
the shed over Spear-street wharf. He is
an old sailor, and is known from one end
of the water front to the other. During a
voyage to Alaska hia vessel was wrecked.
For days he was exposed to the terrors of
an Arctic winter, and when rescued both
his hands and his right foot were frost
bitten.
All three were amputated, but still Mc-
Laughlin manages to pet around, and can
liand out a cigar or a plug of tobacco as
quickly as any full-limbed" man in Sail
Francisco.
"I'm willing to move if the Harbor Com-
ONE OF THE CIGAR-STAN l)S TUAI 111.. UAKBOS COXLSLk&aIOSEHa CON
SIDER AN OBSTRUCTION ON THE WATER FRONT AND .WHICH WILL
BE REMOVED.
missioners will only give me something
else to do," said he yesterday. "I'm a
thorough seaman, and although my hands
are gone, I can write and figure as well as
the best wharfinger on the front. When I
became a cripple those who knew me said
1 would become a burden on the City, but
I said no. I started this cigar-stand, and
I've made a living. Now, if the Harbor
Commissioners arc going to take it away
from me, let them give me something
to do."
John Rezzola, who has a fruitstand on
the bulkhead between Clay and Washing
ton street wharves, was another proteataut.
He is a cripple. <>S years of age, and has a
wife and five children to support. He has
made a living on State property for years,
but now he will have to move with the
others.
After the routine work of the board had '
been gone through with President Colnon â 
drew attention to the mooring bits along i
the water front. He said he had been in
formed by several people that they v^ere
of no use except in calm weather, aiid that
when a storm came ud and any strain was
put on them they pulled out and vessels
went adrift. "In view of the fact that j
winter is coming on." said he, "I think i
some action should be taken in this mat
ter."
Superintendent of Construction Patter
son defended the bits and said they 3tood
fairly well. His principal objection to ;
their removal was the fact that it would !
cost a great deal of money to drive moor- j
ing piles in their place. To this President ,
Colnon replied : "'lf the change is neces- I
sary for the safety of the shipping it will j
have to be made and that is ah there is to j
the matter. It's not a question of money,
bat one of the safety of vessels during'a \
gale. There is a ship unloading at How- >
ard-street wharf now that the bits would
not hold if a storm came up."
Chief Wharfinger Root and Chief En- j
gineer Holmes we're both of the opinion !
that the mooring bits should be replaced
by piles, as the latter would give to the
strain while the bits would not. Com mis- i
sioners Cole and Chad bourne favored the
change and it was finally decided to taKe
action on the matter at the next meeting
of the board.
Cnief Wharfinger Root reported that
quite a number of vessels (six) had been
anchored in the fairway by the pilots last
"Wednesday night. As the attention of the
Pilot Commissioners has once before been
called to this matter the members of the
board felt annoyed over t lie affair. The
secretary was instructed to send another
letter to inform the pilots that if they in
fringed upon the rules again an example
would be made of some of the ships.
Superintendent of Construction Patter
son informed ihe board that he had an
offer for some scales that bad been re
moved from Howard-street wharf some
years ago and he wanted to know what to
do in the mutter. Everybody looked mys
tified until Secretary Keegan explained
that one of the board's tenants had put up
ttie scales and paid no rent for the privi
lege lor five years. A biii for $500 was sent
him and he moved away, leaving the scales
behind, lie also owed trie Pacific Bank
money and that corporation claimed the
.-cales and sold them for $5. When an at
tempt was made to remove them the State
stepped in and took possession. The sec
retary was instructed to advertise the
scales for sale as belonging to an "un
known owner.""
All the contractors for the ferry depot
were again in attendance, but as Attorney-
General Fitzgerald had been unable "to
meet with Messrs. Stratton and Ford the
matter went over again to next Tuesday.
Commissioner Cole said he thought it waa
a pity the matter could not be settled at
once. He was of the opinion that the
! work oueht to be gone on with and get the
Attorney-General's opinion afterward.
Commissioner Chadbourne thought that
wouM bo anything but a safe course to
DUrsue. "The Attorney-General is a mem
ber of the Board of Examiners, and is also
the attorney for the Controller, and thus
holds the trump card. It is better to have
this matter straight at the start, and then
the contractors will not have their money
tied up when the work is half done. If
you, Mr. Cole, wiii guarantee that the con
tractors will get their money I'll vote right
Rto >jo ahead with the work."
mmissioner Cole declined to enter
any guarantee, so the contractors de
parted to assemble again in the board
rooms next Tuesday.

Mills'. Marriage*.
Annie E. Mills is seeking to have her mar
riage with C. E. Mills annulled. She alleges
that she and Mills were married in Ohio on
April 29, 1889. They came to this City some
time after, and here Mills became infatuated
with Klizabeth Anna Stuart. On June 19,
1894, he left his home, and after securing a
license in Alamcdti County, he married her,
leaving the lirst wife alone. She says she has
had nothing to do with him since, the second
wife is made a co-defendant, and the ulaiotiff
asks for $150 with which to prosecute her suit.

WILL SPEAR WILD PIGS
G. Goodland, a Noted Hunter, Is
Here, on His Way to
Queensland.
HE HAS KILLED MUCH GAME.
His Story of former Experiences at
the Antipodes in Pig and
Kangaroo Hunting.
G. Gooclland of London, Eng., a hunter
who has been killing bear, deer and
mountain lions in Calaveras County and
other parts of the Sierra Nevada region, is
at the Rums.
He is an old hunter and has had some
graphic experiences in going after emu*,
kangaroos, wallaby, wild pigs and other
game in New Zealand and different parts
of Australia. He thinks California hunt
ing tjuite exciung, and is well pleased
with his trip. There were four iv his
party. They spent most of their time in
the mountains near Westport. At one
time they were snowed up for four days.
He says they killed several of the little
brown or cinnamon bear, two mountain
iions, and all the deer they wanted. In
speaking of his adventures, he said:
1 am now on my way to Queensland and shall
sail on the Alameda to-morrow. L expect to
have a try at the wild pigs there. 1 have been
in Queensland before ana know what the sport
is. Li is vtry exhilarating, ami there is a spice
nf danger in it which makes it very interest
in?.
The pigs in Queensland go in bands, and
they come down on you liKe a storm. You
must have a good pony or you will have no
ciiance in the fray. You kill tluni with a long
Epear.
Though these pigs come at you as though they
would eat you up, they will iv many cases
turn from you when aunost upon you, and you
will have to sort out your pig and pursue him
before he will come to bay and show the met
tle that is in him.
! Jim these pigs are not so vicious as the wild
j hogu til iiuiia. These are very dangerous. ihey
' nrc big,witti tremendous snouts ami tut^ks, and
j a simp from one of them is enough to lake a
man's leg off. A hunter there hus to be very
, '.vary indeed.
The iua:e pigs of Queensland are from two
H.'.i<l a hall to mree and a half feel long. They
.ire all as black as coal, and ere arnud with
tong, Bharp teeih. 1 have had a great veal of
| enjoyment in going alter them.
Hunting the wild pig?, and kangaroos now
mini the best sport to oe had at the Antipodes.
j But the kangaroos are protected by the laws,
lliey oni'e overran the country ho they were
considered a nuisance. 1 hey peeled the fruit
trees of ranchers and made inroads on tnem iv
other ways Unit were very distasteful to the
early settlers.
A law whs passed offering a bounty for their
killing. They disappeared so rapidly, their
hkins being used lor ooots and shoes, tnat in a
few years the country became almost clear of
them. Then shortly followed the mnmipinl
law, which forbade their killing. This is the
law in force now.
The emu has also been protected in the same
way. Time was when ft man <ould go torth on
the desert and kill emus.ll not by the dozen,
at least In such a number as satisfied his do
sires for sport, lie hhd to look out, too, fora
kick t'roui one of these tjirds would break a leg.
There is yet good sport in going aitcr wallaby.
There are a good niÂ»n; there. However, the
wild pigs which 1 am now going after afford
the best of all sport. I fhail be tome time in
hunting them.
J hoped to get a California grizzly while
here, but did not have the time to utiasi- one
down. I have been in Africa, but at that time
I did not hunt, and consequently killed no big
game in that country.
Mr. Goodland expects to return to Cali
fornia at some future time for further
hunting in the Sierras. His trip nfter wild
pigs In Queensland will be somewhat ex
tended.
QUITE AS DRY AS DUST
Arguments Presented by Counsel
in the Railroad
Case.
The Funeral of John W. Coleman
Comes to the Rescue of Judge
McKenna.
It took nothing leu than a funeral to
break in on the tedious reading of affida
vits and arguments as to their admissibil
ity in an injunction suit brought by the
Southern Pacific Company against the
Railroad Commissioners.
Judge McKenna, ever patient and kind,
lay back in his comfortable armchair yes
terday morning, when ex-Judge Hayne
resumed his argument Jeff, off abruptly
the day before. Counsel, in words most
eloquently spoken, but to laymen, and
others, for that matter, as dry as dust,
went over the ground he covered the day
befure. The hearing lasted until after the
noon hour, when his Honor, with a pleas
ant expression, unbecoming the sad nature
of yart ot 1 is ruling, announced that an
adjournment would be taken, as most of
the lesal lights engaged in the case were
culled upon to attend the funeral of the
late John VV. Cole man, in Oakland.
The affidavit which has brought out ex-
Jndge Hayne'a lengthy argument was
published in yesterday's issue of The
Calilh Mr. Havne's endeavor was ex
pressed by Judge McKenna quite tersely
in answer to an interrogatory of Attorney
Herrin for the railroad company when he
said:
My understanding of the arguments made
by the respondents is ihat the Government,
being a creditor of the complainants and de
siring to protect its Interests, appointed a com
mittee through Congress to investigate the af
fairs of the railroad. This committee reported
buck to the President of the United States, who
transmitted the report to Congress. When the
committee bepan its investigation the corpora
tion was anxious to get an extension of time
in which to make its payments and, may be
reluctantly, sent its officers before the commit
tee, where they testified, not as individuals,
but as tor the corporation.
At this Attorney Herrin rose with a
start, saying:
The Southern Pacific was not indebted to the
Government, in fact was in no way related to
the Government and can be in no" way bound
by the utterances of individuals happening at
the time to bÂ» members of the corporation.
On these lines the arguments lasted un
til recess and will be cairied on again this
morning.
Heavy Damages Asked.
Mrs. Marion Broje, a resident of this City,
through her attorney, Eugene F. Bert, has
filed a suit aeainsl, the Market-street Railway
Company, asking that $50,315 damages be al
lowed her in conpensation for injuries re
ceived by herself in an accident wnich hap
pened on July?. On the day of the accident
Mrs. Broje left her home and took a Third
street electric car. On arriving at Market
street she alightid and hailed a Market-street
car westward bound, as she intended visiting
the park. Standing at the same place were
two ladies, eneh accompanied by a gentleman.
The car came to a standstill and the gentle
men went to the dummy and the ladies en
tered the closed portion of the car. Mrs. Broje
attempted to follow the ladies, and had just
reached tÂ»e first step when the car started
throwing her violently to the ground and in
juring her.

of Cocos they would find a watery grave.
They laughed at tT c prophets and the
Hayseed in due time reached the island,
but -the treasure has not been found,
although Cocos has been tunneled from
ail the iioinls of the compass.
The voyage of the Gertrude is somewhat
similar to that of the Hayseed. She also
will be used in the search for buried
treasure; I tit, unlike the Hayseed, the
master and his man know just where the
precious metal is located. The tittles
is "owned by the Ybarra Gold Mining
Company of Santo Domingo, and if she
ever reaches that point will be used as a
tender between the mines and the open
i the larger vessels
owned by :i will anchor.
The Gertrude is only -' i! feet long and
abÂ«>n: U feet bn S irer .it the
how than she ia at the stern and is cutter-
rigged. She ia very light and buoyant,
CD faith in her that
be has iliciting freight. In her
miniature forehold there ia a considerable
quantity of railroad iron, and an attempt
made yesl â  moon to put
ty keps of nails aboard.
These sank her mi deep in the water,
however, that Captain Bornego came to
l that . - retion was tl c
better pan <>i valor, so he put them ashore
again. The little cabin is both galley,
forecastle .. and in it will be
ns and water. There
is only room for one man at a time to
move around in it. so that it is lucky that
either the captain or mute will always be
at watch on deck.
En talking about the trip yesterday Cap
tain Bornego said: "There is no danger
when c to mink of it. Every
. in the year you hear of people being
picked np ai sea in open boat*, md many
a man owes his life to a raft of logs. Now
they call the Gertrude 'a box.'
â¢â¢Very well I'll admit it just for the sake
of argum- v a perfectly water
tight box just the tame and being well bal
lasted is perfectly safe. Our first stop will
be at Ensenada and from there we will uo
to Santo Domingo. The Gertrude would
have been shipped to the latter place had
it not been for the fact that it is an open
roadsted. and great difficulty would have
been encountered in launching her. Once
at Domingo the Gertrude will run
up and down the river between the mines
and the coasting schooners that call there.
If we have anything like luck we will
make the run down in about ten days and
you can expect to hear from us at En
senada about the Jlst inst."
The Gertrude has attained a great deal
of attention along the front and the
chances are that when she sails there will
be many hundreds of people to see her off.
Captain Kornego says he will not take a
tug, but will get away from the wharf un
der sail and make the best of his way
down the coest unaided.
READY TO INVEST.
San Francisco r.ankers on the Alert
for luited State* ltonds of the
New Issue.
The lead'nc tanks and many of the rich
men of San Francisco are holders of United
States bonds, and it is certain that some of
the thirty-year 4 per cents which the Gov
ernment now expects to i>sue will be
taken by banking institutions of this City.
A well-known banker, speaking on the
topic yesterday, said : "The HiberniaÃank,
which does not accept a deposit larger
than $1000, has now $30,000,000 in its keeping
which belong to depositors. This bank
holds from rive to ten millions of United
States bonds. Now should a run at any
time occur nve millions of United States
bonds could be sold at once in New York
and the amount of coin, calculating the
premium, would be sufficient to meet a
run of a year's duration. The depositors
could stand in line for a great length of
time before the clerks paying out coin on
ordinary deposits couldjexh.ri-t tbia sum."
William Alvord of the Bank of Califor
nia remarked yesterday mat this bank
would, probably, take "some of the new
bonds. The Bank of California bought
some of the last issue, but did not m*ke
any money in the investment, as a
round premium *Â»as paid. His judgment
is to the effect that people with mor.ev
looking for investment prefer to t
par or a shade less than par. The idea of
paving a dollar and twelve cents for a
dollar in bonds does not strike the masses
as a popular measure. When the security
offered can be bought for 98 or 99 cents
people go down in their pockets MB I
ings for the mouey to invest. A popular
loan would be three or* three and a half
per cent bonds, with the list open for all
subscribers. Germany and France tempt
investors by offers of this kind. \
San Francisco bankers fancy that the
1" :...., of the proposed issue, bearing 4
per ceui interest, with thirty years to run,
w:;j sell at a premium of twelve cents on
the dollar. The chances are that the
premium will go higher. The Govern
ment will not have the slightest difficulty
in disposing of the bonds at a fair premium.
There will not be a great rush in San
Francisco to obtain the securities, but our
capitalists are on the alert, and if the
premium is not deemed excessive some
Heavy investments will follow.
SUING FOR POSSESSION!.
The Blum Fstate After Souie Property
Held l>.v Juilnh lion*.
Isidor Blum, administrator cf the estate
of Herman Blum, has commenced suit to
secure from Judah lioas and Flora Caro
possession of some real property on Bush
and Dupont streets and on Post and Stock
ton streets.
On November 7, 1879, Herman Blum was
indebted to J. W. Winter In the sum of
>: A3. There was an account between the
two which reduced this amount, and
.'.naily Winter agreed to settle in full for
1500. Blum did not have the $500 ready
so he borrowed ii from Boas, and the
property was transferred to Boas to secure
payment. Boas was to hold the property,
and mil of its earnings was to pay his own
claim and also a claim for $iooo hold by
the San Francisco Savings Union, and
then the property should be reconveyed
to Blum.
The chums were all satisfied in 1890, the
plaintiff allegea, but still no accounting
from Boas was forthcoming nor was the
property retransferred. One-half of the
property had been conveyed to Flora Caro,
the plaintiff alleges, for the purpose of de
frauding the rightful owner, and all efforts
to secure an accounting have proved in
vain. He therefore asks that the convey
ance to Bous be treated as a mortgage, and
that he be given possession as having sat
isfied the obligation. He also asks that
Boa* be compelled to account and to pay
to nim all profits in excess of those neces
sary to sati-M'y the claims agreed upon.
The property is sail to be worth $100,000.
WAS TEMPTED AND LOST
Proprietor of the Hotel Langham
Lays Money on a
Horserace.
Frank Dwyer's Persuasive Tongue
Made Him Break a Record of
Twenty- Six Years.
John P. Gallagher, proprietor of the
Hotel Langham, at Mason and Eilis
streets, is nursing his wrath to keep it
warm against Frank Dwyer, a well-known !
frequenter of the racetracK.
For twenty-six years he has steadfastly
Bet his face against gambling of every
description, but Dryer's persuasive tongue
has at last made him fall from trrace.
Dwyer had been in the habit of dropping
into the Langham occasionally, and on j
Tuesday morning he got talking to Galla- i
gber about the race-.
"My horse, Regan,* 1 said Dwyer, "is a
flier. He is going to run in one of the ;
races to-day, and he is sure to win. Now, ;
Mr. Gallagher, it you would lay $100 on'
Kega:i it would be money in your pocket."
"No, sir," said Gallagher, "yon don't
catch me betting on horseraces". Why, I
haven't seen a horserace in twft&ty-elx
years, and I have never laid a bet "on a
race, played cards, or gambled in any
shape or form during that time, nor have
I permitted it to be done in my house, and
I am not going to begin now."
"That's all right," replied Dwyer. "but â 
you know it's different when you have a \
sure thing. You give me $100 to bei and
we will divide the winnings. Win or lose
you wUI get the $100 back from me."
Gallacr-er, after more persuasive elo
quence from Dwyer, yielded and gave :he
$50. Dwyer handed him a horseman's
badge so that lie ooold have access to ihe
Btabtea and saddling paddock, and together
they went to the racetrack. Dwyer led
Gallagher to one of the stables and snowed i
him three or four horses which he said t>e- !
longed to him, ana pointed with pride to
I Regan. "Pat him on the neck," said
Dwyer, "he is as irentle as a lamb."
Dwyer left Gallagher and told him he
would -cc him at the stable after the races !
were over and divide tueir winnings. Gal- '
j lagher watched the races, and afier the â 
: last one was run he waited for nearly an '
hour for Dwyer, but no DwyÂ» r appeared.
Yesterday he sent a sharp note to
Dwyer's house., and his wife calleJ at the
hotel. She toli Gallagher that her hus
band would cali in tiie afternoon and ar- ;
range matters, but he did not keep his j
I promise.
"I will make it interesting tor Dwyer," :
said Mr. Gallagher last night, "if he "does
not return to me that $50. I don't believe
he owns any horses."
ALMOST A ROBBERY.
L. KadoTich M.ikci thÂ« Acquaintance
of a Pair of Foot
pads.
About 8 o'clock last night L. Radovicli
of the firm of Radovich & Urhlandt, at
present engaged as a mining engineer, was
attacked at the corner of Stockton and Pa
cific streets by a couple of men evidently
looking for plunder. One of the men ad
dressed Mr. Radovich by name, offering to
accompany him home." Mr. Raiovicti' de
clined the offer of the man's company, aiv.i
was about to proceed oja his way when the
taller of the two men endeavored to aD
stract a watch and $2C> whica were in
>ir. Ha iuvich's vest poeKet.
Radorich shouted for the police, and
pass-.-rs-by ran to his assistance, and then
the would-be robbers fled, one toward
Chinatown and the other out Pacific street.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 189 G.
FAVORITES WERE BEATEN.
A Big Crowd and Lively Betting
on the Opening Day at
Ingleside.
THE GENTLE SEX IN FORCE.
Fair Lovers of Equine Sport Filled the
Grand â Pepper a Lone
First Choice.
Long before the hour for the horses to
answer the bugle-call announcing post
time for the opening race at Ingleside '.
track yesterday the grand stand was ;
crowded with a pay throng, and the packed
betting ring was evidence that the new
Pacific Coast Jockey Club is enjoying un-
I abated favor with the race-going public.
The club was favored with delightful
weather for its opening day and the track
resembled a piece of velvet. The occasion !
also being "Ladies' day,' the grand stand
was tilled to overflowing with fair race
lovers, and the air was murky with tips.
An excellent orchestra lent additional ,
gayety to the occasion by discoursing pop- j
ular airs between races. "
The racing was most enjoyable. There j
was a noticeable absence of crowding and j
jo-tiing, so frequent in races at the old !
track, the broad stretches and wide tarns

eliminating all of these unpleasant features
from the sport. The lest rate was marred
by an accident, but the luckless rider fort
, unately escaped with slight injury.
A feature of the day's sport was the
j starting. Mr. CaldweH" was seen at his
I very best, and sent his lielcla away isi
grand style, calling forth praise from all
I sides.
Tbe card looked an easy one to pick â
oh, so easyâ nothing but favorites. As the
I day wore on though how hard it got. The
! opening race developed a startling sur
prise, .1. G. Brown & Co.'s Wyoming
sauntering in wit a 100 to 1 about him in
the opening betting. With four favorites
i beaten and the talent in despair Pepper
! turned the tide of ili luck by taking the
last event of the day backed down from 2
to 1 to evens.
Eleven maiden three-year-olds furnished
some rare â¢ uessi.ig in the opening eventâ
a Biz-furlong open. Clara Wilson opened
a -', to 1 f;.vuritp, with Big C ief a strong
I second choice. As post timedrow nigh a
stiff play cut the odds against Mr. Keel
I from sixes to 11 to ft, giving him the call
: in the betting. As the race turned out he
i proved a small factor.
Clara Wilson was the first to show after
, the flag fell, followed by Wyoming, who
j passed Red Pike, taking second plac .
i This order was unchanged into the stretch,
j but as tlie wire drew near, the outsider
I took the lead and won easily by a length.
j Pique, poorly ridden by Isoin, finished
third. The winner was backed down from
; 100 to 20 and 30 to 1.
The Corrfgan entry, Kowalsky, was an
8 to 5 choice for the'foilowing event, over
j seven furlongs, with nine starters. Per
haps and Unity were the ones principally
backed of the outsiders. P.riiaps cut out
â  the running, leading into the stretch, with
the favorite a close second. Cochran on
I'iiitv here let out a link and romped in
the easiest of winners, with the favorite in
serond position.
Pittsburg Phil thought his horse Ed
Kearney a "cinch" for the mile dash, and
the crowd followed him. Sam Doggett
had the mount and 3 to 5 was eagerly ac
cepted, lie proved the bitterest kind of a
disappointment. Apparently unable to
head AH Baba, who cut out the pace to
thn stretch, he finished a sorry second to
Wheel of Fortune, who won in a romp.
The winner went to the post IS to 5.
The mile and a quarter handicap hurdle
race was a splendid contest. Eight crack
jumpers sported silk. So evenly' had the
weights been adjusted that there wa â¢> no
prohouncevl choice, both Tempiemore ami
Tom Clarice going to the post at threes,
with The Lurk third in demand. Esper

longer oods. The Lark was in front with
Tempiemore a close second until Hearing
the fifth jump, when Mara on Burmah
beaded the bunch and won somewhat
handily from The Lark, who lasted long
enough to nose oiu Clarke for the piace.
As good us 12 to 1 was atone time obtained
against the winner.
The mil^ and a sixteenth selling affair,
that wound up ti.e day's sport, was another
pretty contest. Ransom and Remus were
scratched, leaving eight to face the issue.
Pepper opened a G to 5 choice, but the coin
was not forthcoming, and he receded to 2
to 1. Then a heavy plunger forced his
odds down to even money. Little Cripple
was well supported at twos, with Collins a
fairly well played third choice. Littie
Slaughter took the lead with Collins after
passing the stand, retaining it until the
stretch was reached, when the favorite was
slightly in front. When straightened
away Collins was either bumped or stum
bled, and fell, bringing Belle of Stonewall,
who was close up, down with him. Pepper
then had clear sailing, and in a mild drive
won by a length frbm G. B. Morris in 1:49
flat. Minnie Ccc finished in the show.

BETTER STREET LIGHTS.
The Merchants' Association Estimate
the Cost of Electric Lamps for
Downtown Thoroughfares.
At the regular monthly meeting of the
board of directors of the Merchants' Asso
ciation last evening trie question of street
sprinkling was again brought up. The
association will request of the Supervisors
that the experiment be made of sprinkling
the business thoroughfares. : The associa
tion offers to make this experiment with
out charge to the City.
A communication was read from the
River Improvement Association, and was
referred to the committee on publicity
and promotion, which will represent the
association in a joint meeting with the
other body to be held in the Chamber of
Commerce on January 15. H. D. Keil was
appointed chairman of the committee.
A communication also was read from
the Van Ness-avenue Improvement Club,
requesting co-operation for the widening
of Lombard street into a boulevard.
The matter was referred to the commit
tee on public affair*, under the chairman
ship sf A. EL Baldwin. The committee
was instructed to co-operate in the fur
therance of the undertaking with the San
Francisco Driving Association.
A resolution was adopted petitioning the
Board of Heaith to retain Superintendent
Weaver in hia office.
ThÂ«Â« committee of public affairs will
submit for the consideration of the Suner
visors a plan for the improvement of street
lighting.
Estimates are prepared for the lighting
by electricity instead of by gas of Market
street, from the ferries to Seventh street,
of Stockton to Bosh, Grant avenue to
Bush, Kearny to California and Montgom
ery to California.
It is , proposed to substitute forty-eight
electric lamps en Market street and" seven
teen on the other streets, the cost of which
at the current rates for electric lighting
Will be $20 per night in excess of
the cost of cas. Trie board of direc
tors will represent to the Supervisors
that the streets are not weli lighted
and that some action should be
taken for improvement in | thi* matter as
soon as the present contract with the Â«ms
companies expires. This will be in seven

THE POOLROOMS BEATEN
Ed Corrigan's Move More Success
ful Than All the Machinery
of the Courts.
DOOM OF THE BUCKET-SHOPS.
: The Ingleside Track Managers Lease
the Only Wire and Thus Prevent
* the Results Being Known.
The downtown poolrooms were Jopen
yesterday, but they did no business. The
action taken by Director Corrigan of the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club has done more
than the police and the courts have during
the past six weeks in trying to break up
those objectionable institutions.
It is an earnest fad with Mr. Corrigan to
prevent be nine on "foreign" books. He has
always advocated that no man could pos
sibly be given a fair chance for his money
if he wagered it at any place but the one
where the race took place. He is not
radical in this idea, but he explains while
a man may get "a square deal" upon
some races, many of the races are finished
many minutes and the results known
miles away from the track by the "for
eign" pool-sellers before the bets are
placed, and these "foreign" pool-sellers or
fcooKrnakers who already know the result
then accept or refuse money offered them
as wagers, according to whether the Lettur
is placing his money right or wrong.
This is calculated to injure raeintr, and
it is the aim of the Pacific Jockey Club
to elevate the sportâ make it what it
should be, a clean and exciting amusement
for the public, not a means for irresponsi
ble agents to fleece the public.
When the Pacitic Coast Jockey Club
gave its inaugural meeting about a month
ago, it refused to allow a score or more of
gamblers to open books at tne track. They
wi re an undesirable element and were
calculated to bring racing to the level oi a
purely gambling Monaco. These men
opened rooms downtown and asked that
they be allowed to have a wire from the
track to their downtown rooms. The
association refused the Dermission, and
for a time the gamblers were in a quandary
as to how they would gei returns to be
announced in their rooms. They found a
way. The Western Union had a wire from
the track for ordinary news purposes, to
give Eastern and local newspapers neces
sary information.
It wns not a private wire, hence any
body at the track was enabled to send any
message presented. Therefore, while the
association frowned upon private wires
direct to poolrooms, the proprietors of the
latter institutions could dicker with the
telegraph company to rewire to tlem from
their downtown office an}* messace sent
from the track.
This was kept quite secret for a time,
and to throw a veil of mystery over the
proceedings, the pool men claimed that
the news of the races was first wired from
the track to Stockton, and from there sent
here. Of course, this was untrue.
The Jockey Club has haa a counle of
weeks to think (he mutter over, and they
hit uuon the right method to do away
with tt;e poolrooms. They simply leased
the only line from the track, and the
Western Union is no longer in a position
to accommodate their erstwhile poolroom
customers.
The result of this new move was ap
parent yesterday. The Toolrooms on Kills
street and in 'Tauper" alley were unable
to do business. They we're left in the
dam as to the odds which were being laid
at the track, but they made odds of their
own on all the horses, including those
that were scratched at the track. This
caused contusion. Worse than that, the
winner of the first race was not known
downtown until after the third race was
run.
To fully understand what a hardship
this is to the poolmen, it must be ex
plained that the men who invest th?ir
halves and dollars in the downtown
houses have but little wealtn, and they
d'.-pend largely on their chance of win
ning in the lirst investment, so as to place
their capital in subsequent races. Re
ceiving no returns, then, from the first
race, until the last one is run cripples
them financially and causes them to wait
penniless and inactive during most of tne
day, when they were wont to do business.
To give a veneer of legitimacy to their
business the poolmen yesterday staled and
stamped upon the tickets they sold that:
"Commissions are placed in San Jose.'
This is as big a fraud as the former claim
that the money was placed in Stockton.
But they had to make some effort to pro
tect themselves in the claim that they are
doing a commission business, and that all
moneys placed with them are laid at the
track or in some city where bettinc on
horseraces is net prohibited.
Jerry Driscoll, tne poolseller, was yester
day convicted by Judge Joachimsen of
violating the pool ordinance, and was sen
tenced to pay a fine of Â£200 or bo impris
oned in the County Jail for ISO days. The
defendant's attorney gave notice of ap
peal and paid into court $300 as bail
money.
A jury had been summoned for 2 o'clock
to try the case of Gilbert Blodes, proprie
tor of the poolrooms frequented by women,
but as Blodes signified his intention oi
waiving a jury, the venire was dbcharged
and the case set for trial to-morrow.
CLARKE TESTIFIES.
The Wounded Cashier Tellg Hig Story
of the Ingleside Rob
bi>ry.
Reuben Clarke, cashier of the bar at the
Ingleside track, who was robbed of the
Christmas day receipts, gave his testimony
last night before Judge Low. It will be
remembered that the witness was shot in
his left foot before he let go of the pouch
containing the money, and since then he
has been at a . private hospital on Eddy
street under treatment for his injuries.
Clarke said that the car upon which he
was returning to town was stopped by â 
tall man, whose face was covered with a
mask. In answer to a question by Prose
cuting Attorney Mogan Mr. Clarke gave
a description which seemed to (ally with
the general appearance of the defendant,
Gardner. He s-aM there were other men
in the background, but he could not de
scribe them.
He also identified the leathern raoney
poucti found near me Olympic Balt-water
Pumping Company's pier as the one
which was taken from his custody.
Upon bein,: cross-examined by Messrs
Tobm and Ashe Mr. Clark* said he thought
the man wh > stopped the car was about
tyro inches shorter than Detective Gibson.
Since Gardner is a hail inch taller than
the detective the defense hopes to clear
him on this statement.

Senator Perkins Fighting in

EFFECT OF MONROE DOCTRINE
A New Character Given the Great
International Canalâ Text of
the Perkins Bill.
ThÂ» Venezuelan question, which brought
the Monroe doctrine so prominently before
the world, baa aroused a new interest in
the Kicaragufi canal, and. in fact, given
the canal a new and interesting character.
At the same time the bill introduced by
tor I'erkins, calling for construction
â â  great waterway and providing for
financial questions involved in the scheme,
h.\s added still more to direct attention to
the canal.
Captain William L. Merry, the Nicara
cnan Consul, stated yesterday that many
Senators and Congressmen had announced
they would push Senator Perkins' bill and
make a vigorous fight for the adoption of
the measure.
â¢There has sprung up a strong feeling,"
said Captain Merry, "that the canal should
be built without delay. The Monioe doc
trine has brought it to the front. About
all that keeps buck debate on Fenator
Perkins' bill is the report of the Nicaragua
Canal Commission, submitted to President
November. But that is
looked for every day now, ami, just as
booh a^ it :s Laid" before Congress, then the
Perkins bill will be taken up. I ani in
formed that the commission recommends
the ai â  000 and eighteen
months' time for a survey. Tne route has
been surveyed eleven time? already, and
Professor Davidson tells me that the sur
vey could be finished in seven or eight
month-,. It looks as if U. P. Iluntington
wa< in it, sparring for delay, and that
Hnntiagton is tig 'ting the canal with all
his force and skill."
It is understood that the Chamber of
raerce of this City will, at its
meeting on the 14th inst., adopt a peti
tion urging Congress to prompt action on
the Nicaragua canal question, And setting
forth that the abandonment of the project
to a foreign power would be an absolute
violation of the Monroe doctrine.
Senator Perkins" bill is an amendment
to the bill introduced by Senator Barliam
and entitle. i "A bill to amend an act en
tilled 'An act to incorporate the Maritime
Canal Company of Nicaragua.' " It begins

MINISTER CASTLE HERE.
He Favors Annexation of Hawaii,
Either as a State or Ter
ritory.
Belief Expressed That the Island People
Would Vote for It â A Question
of Population.
W. R. Castle, Minister from Hawaii to
the United States, arrived here from Wash
ington, D. C, yesterday, on his way to
Honolulu, and will sail to-day.
Minister Caatle is in favor of the joint
resolution introduced by Spaulding of j
Michigan for the annexation of Hawaii,
but lie pays the dispatch as transmitted
concerning the resolution is a little obscure.
It implies that the resolution is for an- j
nexation as a State; but he says that, as [
he understands it, Hawaii has not popula- !
tion enough for this. It has but 100,000
people, while 173,000 is required by the :
laws of the United Mates.
"However, if it can be fixed up so that j
we can be adrnitte i as a State, so much the ;
better." said Mr. Castle. "Tie people
would he sativlied to c me in either as a j
Smtc or a* a Territory. There is one thing, |
we have more population than they have j
in Nevada, where, all told, they have now j
but 40,000.
"The proposition to submit the matter j
to a vote in Hawaii would be generally
approved, and 1 am convinced that it â¢
would carry.
â¢Mr. Cleveland has treated me in the j
most courteous manner. I would not be i
at all surprised if he would favor annex- j
ation. It is worthy of note that in no
public message has he really opposed it.
"The cable project is coming along all
riant. I refer to the project of Mr. Spaul
ding of Honolulu. Congress is in favor of ,
it. The proposition is that capitalists I
shall build it and that Congress shall take
it at its actual cost. It will be built, I
think."
Minister Castle will leave on the steamer
AJameda.
A New French Court Interpreter.
The Mayor and Judges Slack and Campbell
met yesterday morning in the -Mayor's office to
appoint court interpreters for the enduing
year. It was decided to leave all the incum
bents in their places with tin: exception of
the French interpreter. The list now com
prises the following-named individuals: Inter
preter of Spanish, Andrew Glover; of Italian,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1596.
CRUSH THE FUNDING BILL
A Monster Convention Being
Organized to Oppose Its
Passage.
TWO MAYORS IN CONFERENCE.
Delegates Coming From All Towns
Having a Population of a
Thousand or More.
Another rod is in pickle for the funding
bill. Throughout the State the popular
voice has been raised more than once
against this 'monster of iniquity," as
Mayor Sutro scruples not to style it.
With the end of securing the co-operation
of his peers in other towns, and in order to
obtain from his near neighbors, the may
ors of Oakland, Sacramento and Stockton,
an expression of their views on the matter,
his Honor invited those officials to a con
ference with him in the City Hall. Mayor
Davie of Oakland was the only one who
responded in person at the appointed hour
yesterday morning. Mayor Boggs of
Stockton sent a telegram assuring Mr.
Sutro of his hearty co-operation in the
work of endeavoring to prevent the bill
from passing, and Mayor Hubbard of Sac
ramento also sent word to the same effect,
both Gentlemen permitting their names to
be used as Mr. Sutro might judge proper
and expedient in the matter.
\Vhile waiting for Mayor Davie to
make his appearance, Mr. Suto paced up
ana down his office at the City Hall, giv
ing his views quite freely and at some
length.
"Now's our time to fix the octopus," he
exclaimed enthusiastically. "If this bill
can only be prevented from passing both
houses the railway will be looking six ways
for Sunday. To be sure, all our efforts
may prove fruitless. Mr. Huntington has
a sack, and a pretty deep sack it is, too;
but I hope there are still some honest men
in the National Congress. These men
shall know what we think and what we de
mand in reference to this iniquitous bill,
even though the rause < f evil triumph.
"At all events," continued the Mayor,
"it is our duty to do our best. We will en
deavor to liave delegates from nil parts of
the State assembled in convention here in
San Francisco, and that convention will
j>a>s resolutions denouncing this swindling
bill as a delusion and a snare. We nvst
get one of the large-t halls in the City and
interest the people in this movement, so
that all may know and fight against the
terrible injustice which is in dancer of
bein-i done us. Every one this side of the
RocKy Mountains is vitally interested, and
we hone to see the octopus crushed and
annihi.ated before long. 1 '
To what higher flights the venerable
Mayor's eloquence might have soared can
not now be stated, as at this stage Mayor
Davie entered the room and the two city"
executives, after a cordial creeting, entered
upon their conference without delay.
"Now when," asked Mr. Sutro, ''do you
think this protesting convention should
take place?
"It ought to be soon," answered Mr Da
vie; "that is if we wish our woik to tell."
"I think next Wednesday would be a
pood date," suggested Mayor Sutro. "That
will give us tune to notify the mayors of
the various interior towns, and have them
send in their delegates."
"That will d>> excellently." assented
Mayor Dave, "but now, as to the n
of these delegates. Hmv many of them
are there to be? 1 should say two would
be enough for the Interior towns. fSan
Francisco and Oakland would, of course,
require a larger Dumber."
"In my opinion," icjoined Mayor Su
tro, "the number of delegates shoo
in proportion to the population of the
places which tiiey may represent. I think,
there should be one delegate to each 5000
of the population."
"But how about towns with less than
5000 inhabitants?" queried Mayor Davie.
"I suppose the best plan would be to
have one delocate from each town having
from 1000 to 5000 inhabitants. In the case
of lamer cities lei there be one add I
delegate for each 5000 of the population."
"That seems reasonable," remarked
Mayor Davie, "and in order to prevent
confu.sion we may as well limit the invita
tions to towns having not less than 1000
inhabitants."
"I agree to that," said Mayor Sutro.
The question as to the proner official to
address in case the town had no Mayor
was then discussed. Mayor Sutro said
that in such an event the invitation should
be sent to t;.e president of the Town Coun
cil oi tiie place, or if there should be no
Town Council then to ihe president of the
Board of Supervisors.
"I don't like Supervisors," remarked
Mayor Davie rather nervously. " I'm
a riii'i of them, in faat; but I suppose your
plan is the only fe.isTOle one."
The two Mayors then agreed upon an
invitation to be drawn up, signed by the
Mayors of San Franci co. Oakland, Sachi
niento and Stockton and addressed to the
Mayors, Presidents of Town Councils or
Presidents of Board of Supervisors, a* the
case might be, of all towns in the State
baring a population of over 1000. TheÂ»e
functionaries are 10 be delegates in tne
ratio before mentioned to the monster con
vention which is to open on Wednesday,
the loth inst., at 10 o'clock in the morii
ing, in pome h:;ll or other meeting-place to
be designated later. It will be stated in
the invitations that the object of the con
vention will be to secure an expres
sion of opinion in reference to the funding
bill from the best exponents of popular
thought in each section of the Slate.
Mayor Sutro is enthusiastic over the
project, and prophesies that the convention
will make things lively for the redoubtable
"octopus" which his Honor regards with
so little favor.

EZETA AS A FILIBUSTER
The Salvadoran General Is in
Command of an Invading
Expedition.
He Is Now Hovering Around the Port
of Costa Rica in the Tug
Golden Barclay.
General Antonio Ezeta, ex-Vice-Presi
dent of Salvador, who, dressed in a glitter
ing new uniform, sailed from this port on
September 18, oound for Acapulco with
the purpose of dethroning the present
Balvadorao oictator, Gutierrez, and over
toppling the nesv G-overnment in general,
has organized a filibustering expedition in
an endeavor to cany out his original in
tentions.
The expedition is aboard the tug Golden
Barclay, and is at present hovering around
the harbor of Costa Rica, but according to
a telegram received yesterday by Dr.
CakJeron, Salvadoran Minister in this City,
the self-styled liberator has not yet landed,
but in all probability fear on hit, part is all
that prevents him from so doing.
The telegram carrying the news of the
expedition to this City is as follows:
San Sai.vauok, Jan. 9.
Dr. Caldernn, Con mi I of Salvador: Antonio
Ezeta has arrived on a filibustering expedition
in the tug Golden Barclay, but be did not dare
to lnnd. He proceeded to Costa Rica, around
which port he is at present hovering. The
peace of the country has not yet bÂ£en dis
turbed at a!!. Castki.i.anos,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, San Salvador.
When Ezeta left this port c said that he
would laud at Acapulco, where lie would
1 meet a confederate of the name of Oolochio
i and many others who would assist him,
! but he woul 1 not move on his country un
j til ho had sufficient followers to make se
cnrity and success certain.
Dr. Calderon says his people have fore
\ seen this move on Ezeta's part for some
time, and are prepared to give him a recep
tion, as they are satislied with the present
government.
Sailors have an idea that rats will for
sake a doomed vessel, and several curious
instances, tolerably well authenticated,
have been reported of the rats leaving a
vessel which afterward came to disaster.
It is a well-known fact that rats frequently
desert a house about to fall and mines
which are on the point of caving in.
THE UNION LEAGUE CLUB.
Annual Election of Officers Is
Exciting Widespread
Interest.
TWO TICKETS IN THE FIELD.
National -Guard Staff Officers Are Try
ing to Down General R.
A. Friedrich.
The annual election of officers for the
Union League Club will take place next
Tuesday. There are two tickets in the
field, and the contest promises to become
quite animated. In this club the members
chosen to constitute the board of directors
elect the president, vice-president and
secretary.
Following is the regular tLket for the
board of directors:
Samuel W. Backus. Robert A. Friedrich,
George H. Pippy, Charles G. Clinch, Wil
liam H. Dimond, Dan T. Cole, Harry N.
Gray, John C. Currier, Frank A. Vail,
Reed Jones, John J. Wirtner.
The members' ticket, which contains
eicht names that are on the regular ticket,
Contain also three ranies not thereon â
W. D. fcianborn, Arthur Spear and Charles
M. Bhortridge. Messrs. Spear and Short
ridge are members of ihe existing board,
having been chosen to till vacancies, and
under the courtesies of custom were en
titled to be placed on the regular ticket.
Cornelius O'Connor was so entitled, but he
declined to serve, and so in his place W.
D. San born was designated.
Following is the members' ticket:
Charles M. Short-ridge, Samuel W. Backus,
Robert A. "Friedrich, Daniel T. Cole, Ar
t1 1 it- W. Spear, John J. Wirtner, Frank A.
Vail, George H. Pippy, W. D. Sanborn,
Charles G. Clinch, Harry N. Gray.
Since the Union League Club was
incorporated, in 1889, it has been the un
failing custom for the lirst vice-president
to succeed in regular order to the honors
of the presidency. In that line Wendell
Easton succeeded Major Chamberlain;
then followed S;imnel fit. Shortridge, A.
E, Castle, William McDonald and S. W.
Backus, each stepping from first vice
president to the presidency. The first
vice-president now is General Robert A.
Fried rich, and it was supposed until re
> centl\ that no obstacle to hid promotion
would be interposed, but when the regu
lar ticket was formed it was found that
several nominees of the board who had
been quite active as National Guard stall
othcers and holders of fat Federal offices
were inclined to object to General Pried
rich and put forward General W. H. Di
mond.
'i nere is also a surmise that ex-Postmas
ter and ex-Adiutant-<ieneral S. AY. Backus,
who is now the president, would not ob
ject to another term in case that General
Dimond should not care to serve. Ex-
Pension Agent John C. Currier, who is
now a member of General Dimond'a staff,
is repo r teÂ«l to entertain the warmest ad
miration for General liackus as second
choice.
In order to teat the sense of the club,
members who are loyal to the traditions of
the organization and who acknowledge
that there is a big her purpose in party or
ganization than to hold orriee forever, de
cided to present a members' ticket and
meet the issue.
No don bt a large vote will be called out,
and the result of the election will be close
ly studied by humble workers in the ranks
of the party Whose names do not adorn the
Union League roll of ruembershiv>-
TtÂ»Â« friends o! General Friedrich claim
tliat he is a representative of that earnest
and devoted element of the Republican
party that is willing at all times to sacri
lice personal ambitions for the success of
the organization. In the Repnblican
cause he stumps tne State effectively when
the committee calls on him for support,
lie goes wherever duty calls. He is not
an adept in the science of manipulating
conventions or controlling Congressional
delegations, but he is simply an able,
broad-gautred, whole-souled and large
hearted Republican whose friends are
legion. Should the attendance of country
members next Tuesday be large the vote
for the members' ticket will be corre
spondingly lar. c.
General Friedrich was seen by a Call
reporter yestetday, but courteously de
clined to discuss the contest. He enter
tains the belief that several of the mem
bers on the regular ticket who are reported
to be working against his promotion are
friendly lo him, and avers that he has re
ceived from them expressions of friend
ship. He said distinctly, however, that
Arthur Spear and Charles M. Shqrtridge
should have been, in accordance with cus
tom, placed on the regular ticket. Com
modore O'Connor was entitled to a place
on the regular ticket, but he declined to go
on either ticket, so \V. I>. Sanborn, an
other progressive member of the club,
was placed on the member's ticket. Gen
eral Friedrich says that he has not sought
the office, but he feels that according to
the custom which has been observed since
the ciub was founded the first vice-presi
dent should succeed to the presidency.
Asia had its name from the Sanscrit
word Astias, signifying "land of the
dawn."

In this controversy I have but two aims.
First. 1 wish io put before the public a clear
and correct statement of Catholic teaching and
of Catholic history. Secondly, 1 wish to an

which arc brought against Catholic loyalty,

these extracts have on the controversy i* as
obscure as the relation of St. Peter's mother-in
law to Dr. Case's veracity or the connection of
-Philosophic sin" with American institutions.
1 must confess the matter is beyond me. Xo
doubt the diligent and nnirrammatical editors
of them f>Oisess son adumbration of i t : o i r
relevancy. Hut if they do they have unkindly
withheld their knowledge from the rest o: the
world.
Now, Mr. 1 â  â¢ me state my position
or clippings. A

through with one the public would
have completely forgotten what tfie original
controversy Â«Â«< about.
However, I nave taken certain specified quo
tations, mid 1 have shown thai they were U>r
geries/pnre an.i simple. To do this 1 have
been compelled to use different methods. To
the Jesuits 1 oath and the priests' oath I have
offered complete ami comprehensive denials,
sworn to before an officer of the law: in the
case of the alleged bull of excommunication,
I have produced the original from which it
was taken, and traced its origin not to the
church, but to an obscene novel known- as
Tristram Shandy"; for Dr. Case's quotation
from Gury, I submitted the works of that
author for examination, and showed that the
reverend gentleman hau substituted a "no"
where the original had "yes."
None of these refutations have been met. G.
A. llubbeii obstinately lights shy of the affida
vits of Father I'rendergast. of "Father Imoda
and of Father Wyman. He has kept a discreet
silence on Tristram Shandy, and Dr. Case has
been as uncommunicative a* a clam when
asked to explore the tons of literature he has
at home for the (Jury from which he took his
quotation.
In the face of facts like these thinking people
will naturally look with suspicion on all quo
tations emanating from these sources. false
in one thing, false in all, is a maxim of com
mon-sense as well us of law. How true it is
may be learned from a slight examination of
some of the latest quotations made by G. A
Hubnell.
This patron of phonetic spelling no doubt re
nrets the unkind fait- which prevented him
irom being a Â»>i-nooluiaÂ»ter. The eternal tituess
of things )s demonstrated in his attachment to
the little red schoolhouse. The "barefooted"
ignorance which could perpetrate "the differ
ence between he and his kind" can only be. ex
piated by perpetual incarceration in some such
institution of learning as the Home for the
FeebieÂ»mliiaed. However, knowledge must be
inculcated and education defended. If the one
cannot in- accomplished by buttering the pu
pils at Wit the other mny be attained by bat
tering the I'npe.

Taken the trouble to look the matter an, and
I present an analysis ot the first as a specimen
of the literary hom-aty of these new defenders

Is taken whs written In reply to an attack on

which appeared in Putnam's Magazine: I'
have not been abie to liim nut the name of the
writer, but he gives this description of him
belf: ULJtt
We know well the common school system of this

We wore lor live years a common-iichool teacher,

for themselves, we offer thorn no opposition. 111
--deed, for those who bold the supremacy of the
secular crder and believe that every department
of life should be secularized, 110 better system can
be devised.
Kow the literary buccaneers who must rilie

this gentleman's writings to prove the church
is trying to destroy the public school.-. The

1 ask you, Mr. Editor, and all fair-minded
nun, how are we to argue with such dis
honesty as this? if Catnollc teachings are
treasonable why Is it necessary to gerry
mander Catholic books to make out a case
against us ? I have given the answer time and
lime again. When men wish to prove what is
not true they are driven to falsehood, to
forgery and to perjured testimony.
We read, Mr. Editor, in the Scripture that
when men were suborned to swear ajjaii.st our
Lord "their testimonies were not agreeing."
A clever liar has hard work to escape contra
diction, but a clumsy liar has as many' feet as
.Mayor Stitro's octopus, and he manages to put
every one 01 them in the mess. 11 G. A. Ilub-
Iveil had stopped lor an instant in his blind
fury of scissoring to read the extracts he was
inflicting on your readers he would have seen
that one 01 them exposed the other. Thus, his
third quotation runs as follows:
As Miere Is for us Catl;o'tcs only one church,
there is and cÂ»n be no proper education lor us not
riven by or under Ore direction ami control of the
Catholic cfcurch.
The obvious inference from this sentence is
that tiie Catholic church is trying to get all
hciioois ;indcr her control. If we turn, how
ever, to h.s enth quotation we iind that he
gtres this little extract with its context. This
icrth quotation :s built on tbe same piaii as
the lirÃt, with utimerous and interesting omiss
ions. If I remember rightly some eighteen
sentences are left out; only the last two are
consecutive. 1-roin these we see that the
writer Is speaking of religious education, and
lie says oi it what every America!), every
Methodist, every Episcopalian, will admit:
This sort of education can he Riven only by
the church or under her direction and control,
tad ms there is for us Catholics only one church,
there is and cÂ«7i be no proper education tor us
not given by or under the direction and control of
the Catholic church.
It is hard to conceive the stolid stupidity
which would palm off reasoning like this upon
an intelligent community, it is a jioor cause
which needs such advocates. How can we be
expected to treat with seriousness men who
are such paudiculateci idiots that they fall over
their own feet ami into their own mouths ?
At this writing 11. W. Bowman is ahead in
the >eissorÂ« competition by several feet. His
Just contribution consisted of nothing less than
h challenge. I answered that challenge sev
eral weeks ago, when I informed Mr. Bowman
that he made a mistake in the date. It should
bare been beaded the Ist of April. There is no
other day in the calendar so meet for Mr. How
man and his challenge.
As to the Suisun matter, Mr. Bowman doubts
my word for the offer of #I<K> to prove his quo
tation. He also professes ignorance of the
precise quotation in question. I'ermit me to
enlighten him.
1 quote from a stenographic report of a
"speech delivered by H.W. Bowman Esq. of Ban
Francisco, California, in the Native Sons' Hall
at suisun, Polaco County, California, on Octo
ber 15, 1895, reported by F. .1. Brownlee." On
page 4 l find the following specimen of pat
riotic eloquence:
Now I call your attention to some historical facts
to-night ;â  some Tacts in relation to thÂ«determina
tion of the Romish hierarchy to overcome the
American liberty. I will read you the following
from the Catholic World of July. 1870. It says:
There la ere long l" tie 11 state religion and that
s-nte religion Is to be Koman Catholic: all legl la
tioii must be governed by the law dictated by the
Pope.
This is the quotation. Now allow me to sub
mit the following letter, which I received this
morning:
snsi-N, cal.. .Tan. 8. 1896.
Rev. I. '". Yorkr, San J-'ranriscoâ Kkvkkknd

1 will send it to you lit once. Respectfully,
T. .1. I.'X.VI.IN.
This, I think, is sufficient to show Mr. How
ma i that my word in this matter hi least is
reliable. Or course, I expect to have all the
clerical Pharisees like Dr. Case, who tithe
merit and anise and cummin, and who leave
undone the weightier things of the law, judg
ment and mercy and faith, resoluting against
me for contaminating the cause ot truth with
the mammon of iniquity. However, 1 cannot
help that. The scriptural answer meets this
case and every similar case : "Ye blind guides
who strain out the gnat and swallow the
camel."
Now, as to 11. \Y. Bowman's challenge to
enter on a public or oral debate with him, let
me state as clearly and *s precisely as 1 can
! that I have not the slightest intention of en
gaging in a debate with him or with anyone

B. The Pope may depose kings, mid absolve

Cardinal Manning, in his defense of the
papacy, claimed that Koine had the full right
to depose a Protestant sovereign. In his "Ks
says on Religion," pp. 468-459, he says: "The
election of a Prince in a Christian community
cannot be put in the category of a purely civil
act. If, therefore, an heretical Prince is elected
or s-.icceeds to the throne, the church has a
right :o say, 'I annul the election or I forbid
the succession.': Or, again,' if a King of a
Christian nation falls into heresy, he commits
an offense ogflinst God * * * and Hgainst
his people " â¢ * Therefore, it is in the
power of the church, by virtue of the supreme
authority with which she Is vested by Christ
over all Christian men, to depose such a Prince
in punishment of nis spiritual crime". The
following concise summary of papal interfer
ence in the aliiiirs of state, from the pen of
Rev. Hamveil Home, M.A., is right to the
point:
St. Gregory VII twice anathematized and de
posed the Emperor Henry IV. 1 11 1116 the Km

Clement VII issued bulls 01 deposition against
Henry IV. King of France, whose life, was- first at
tempted by .loiin Chastel, a Jesuit, then a monk.
and finally he wan stabbed by Bavaillac, In 1569
BalQI Pins V deposed Queen Klizubeth, whose
Uomanlst. subjects he stimulated to rebel against,
her and furnished some of them with money to aid
their nefarious. attempts, mid hulis or deposition
were fulminated against that illustrious' queen by
Uregory XIII In 1680, six tun V In 1587. and
Clement VIII 111 1000. Sixtus V In his bull
styled her a usurper, a heretic and- an* excom
municate, gave her throne to Phillip 11 of Spain,
and commanded the Knglish to join the Spaniards
In dethroning her. Clement VII In 1600 issued
a bull to prevent James 1 ascending the throne
Of England, declaring that "when it should hap
pen that that mistrable woman (Queen Kllzabeth)
should die they (her subjects) should admit none
to the crown, though ever so nearly allied 10 it "by
blood, except they would not, only tolerate the (Ho
man) Catholic religion but promote It to {lie ut
most of their power; and would, according 10 an
cient custom, undertake upon oath to perform the
same." in 1643 Urban VIII issued a bull of depo
sition against Charles I in Ireland, where wo years
before not fewer than 100,000 Protestants "were
massacred ; and to those who had joined the rebel
lion of 1641 the same Holy Pontiff granted a pie
nary indulgence. In 1729 Benedict XIII, at the
Instance of Itnman Irish prelates, issued hull to
dethrone George 11, King of KiiÃland, wl'.h
an indulgence. as we have above seen,
for raising money to support the Pre
tender. In 1708 Clement XIII published
a brief on occasion of certain edicts isÂ«rc d by the
Duke of Parma and PlnccnllH. in his own do
minions: wherein the Pontiff, in the' plenitude 'of.
his usurped authority, abrogated, repealed and an
nnlled sis being prejudiced to the liberty, lmmunity
and jurisdiction of the Church, whatever the. DaÃe
had ordered in Ills edicts and forbade hi* subjects
lo obey their sovereign ; further, depriving all who
had either published or obeyed the edicts of all
their privileges and Incapacitating them from re
ceiving absolution until they should fully and en
tirely have restored matteia to their former condi
tion or should have made s .tit able satisfaction to the
church and to the Holy .See. in 1800 Pope Pins Vj 1
announced his election to '.he | oiuilicale to i otiin
Will as the lawful king of France, anil in
the I olio wing year lie exhibited a most edifying in
stance of pupal duplicity when ii suited his interest
by enterin>{Â»into Â» concordat with Hoiiui arte, in
which, besides suppressing 146 episcopal and
metropolitan sees and dismissing their bishops and
metmpolltans without any form of judicature, he
absolved all Frenchmen from their oaths of al
legiance to their legitimate sovereign and author
â¢zed an oath 01 allegiance to the First Consul: and
when Lous XVIII sent his embaamdora to Rome
to present his credentials the PontlsT refused to
receive him. With marvelous Infal Ibillty. limy

On the of January, 18.">4, Tope Pius IX
issued an allocution, which whs. translated and
published in the New York Freeman's Journal,
the leading Catholic paper In the United
States. Itwas a denunciation of the acts of
the Piedmont Government. Among other
things he said : . "We reject and condemn not
only all and each of the decrees of that Gov
ernment hurtful to the rights and authority of

Romanist, priest or layman, Rive for this arro
gant assumption on tne part of the Roman
Pontiff in interfering in the political affairs of
a foreign kingdom? This act of Pius IX shows
clearly thnt modern Popes have not renounced
the ancient claims of tiie papacy, but still
claim the right of the Pope as supreme ruler
over Christendom to "set aside and make void"
any law of any government which in his
judgment may infringe the rights, liberties
and immunities of the church.
Again, June 22, 18Â«S, Pius IX issued an
allocution condemning the constitution of
Austria. In it he says: "By our apostolic
authority we reject and condemn the above
mentioned (new Austrian) laws in general and
particular all that has been ordered, done or
enacted in these and other things against the
rights of the church by the Austrian Govern
ment or its subordinates; by the same author
ity we declare these laws and their conse
quences to have been and to be for the future
null and void." (See Janus, pages 23 and 24.)
Here Pope Pius asserts the right to set aside
the laws of a foreign â¢ kingdom and to declare
"null and void" laws sanctioned by legislative
enactments. No more arrogant claim to tem
poral dominion was ever put forth by Gregory
VII or Innocent 111.
In this passage from this allocution, Janus
remarks;
â¢'By this sentence the whole legislature and
executive of Austria is placed under ban, with
rhe Kmperor Francis Joseph at its head, and
the Austrian* may be thankful that the whole
territories of the empire are not placed under
interdict, according to the earlier precedents
put in practice the last time against Venice
(1606).
"Pius IX condemns the Austrian constitu
tion for making Catholics bury the bodies of
heretics in their cemeteries, where they have
none of their own, and he considers It 'abom
inable'(abominabilis), because it allows Prot
estants and Jews to erect educational institu
tions.'
Such acts, under the doctrine of infallibility,
are justified by nil devout papists. One reason
why the A. I. A. opposes Romanism is that
the political principles of the papacy are in
conflict with the spirit and letter of the Amer-
Ican constitution.
1. Komanism stands committed to the union
of church and state; the constitution repudi
ates the dogma.
2. The constitution- guarantees freedom of
conscience; the papacy denies the right thus
vouchsafed to all.
.'5. The papacy opposes freedom of speech and
of the press; the constitution guarantees their
freedom.
4. The constitution forbids legislnt l. >n against
any form of religious worship; the papacy de
mands legislation against every form of "wor
ship bat its own.
.">. The Declaration of Independence and the
constitution make the people the source of
civil power; the papacy maintains that the
church Is the source of civil power.
â¢;. The constitution requires all foreigners
fefkitiK citizenship to renounce all allegiance
to foreign powers; the Romanists boldly avow
their allegiance to a foreign ruler.
7. The constitution forbids the appropriation
"f ?tÂ«tc funds for sectarian purposes; the
!:.>!ni*.li church lims plundered the National
and state treasuries to the extent of millions
of dollars.
8. The constitution makes the laws of the
state superior to those of any church; the
papacy maintains that the church is above the
State, and not subordinate to it.
:>. '1 he Kiunish church holds that it has the
right to employ force; the spirit of the-consti
tiitiou forbids it.
10. The Romish church denies the right of
the state !o educate the youth of the land ; the
constitution provides fo* their education.
These ten points of opposition to civil law
fire a suflicient reason for our protest against
in'ii.ij Romanised, it is Congress or Vaticau ;
Pope or President, confessional-box or ballot
box.
To Romanize is to Vaticanize. It is to ac
knowledge the supremacy of the Pope. It is to
unite church anil state. it is to make the Pope
Che head of the Nation. It would grant him
the same power that is now vested in the Su
preme Court: He would decide nil questions
oit law. The church â¢ would be. freed
from civil censure. The priests would en
! joy immunity from civil law. Hut the
: supremacy of the Pope ! has been an |
unmitigated corn in all Hges and countries.
Italy ban vomited up Papal supremacy, and
America would be insane to swallow' down i
what the Italians have vomited up. To Vati- '
canize means to establish the inquisition in i
America; to place the sword of the state in the
hand of the church. To be Romanized the
power or the Pope must be recognized. It is '
assorted in a Papal bull: - "We declare, define i
arid pronounce that it is absolutely necessary
tor salvation that every human creature bo !
subject to the Roman Pontiff."
Furthermore, to Romanize is to monerchizc. |
It is to. surrender the republican system of I
government by the people and to return to the
monarchial one of government by a king. i
The Pope as a temporal ruler claims kingly
rights. He exercises supreme' power. There is â 
no appeal from his decision. As a despot he !
cannot be beaten. The Czar of Russia is not In I
it with him. Republicanism has too much
liberty for Romanism. it is easier to rule a
people through a monarchial than a republi
can system. Hive a man a voice in the Gov
ernment and he ceases to be a slave to the
Government.
There is no obscurity In the position taken :
by the United States in the matter of alle
giance; the state requires most perfect and
complete tideiity and obedience to the repub
lic. The voice of the papacy Is no less uncer
tain; it demands the unqualified obedience of
its adherents to the Pontiff. Thus Cardinal ;
Manning, speaking in the name of the Pope,
i has said:
I acknowledge no civil power: I am the subject
of no civil power; I am the subject of no prince, â¢
anil 1 claim 10 be more than this. I claim to be !
: the supremo judije anil director of the consciences
of men, of the peasants that till the fields, mill of
the mince thai sits upon the throne; or the house
hold Hint sits in the shade of privacy, and the legis
lature thai makes laws lor kingdoms. I am sole.
I last, supreme judge of what Is right and wrong.
Moreover, we declare, atilrn). define and pronounce
it to be necessary to salvation to every human
creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.
All of which may be found in Quirinus
(Appendix I, p. 882) and the Tablet of October :
it, JcG'l.
I now ouote from Manning's Decrees and Civil
Allegiance, p. 54, where the Cardinal says:
i It is clear that the civil power cannot define
; how far the circumference of faith and morals ex
; ternlx. * â¢ â¢ If the church cÂ»unot fix the limits
of its jurisdiction, then either .nobody can or the
(State must, Bat the State cannot unless It claim
to tie the depository mil expositor of (he Christian
: revelation. Therefore, it la the church or unholy.
I his last atippoaliiou leads to chaos. .Vow, if this
M rejected, i he church alone can; and if the
church can fix the limits of Its Jurisdiction it can
fix the limns of all o:her jurisdictions.
The same authority, in "lirsarism and Ultra
montaiiism" (page 30),* argues:
Any power which is independent ami can alone
fix the limits of its own jurisdiction, ana can
thereby fix the limits of all other jurisdictions, is,
ipso fÂ«clo. supreme.
The following from an address delivered by
Pope Pius IX, of infallibility fame, July 21,
18<:t, is pertinent:
There are many errors regarding Infallibility;
but the roost malicious of all Is that which includes
In that dogma the right of deposing sovereigns,
and declaring the people no longer bound by the :
obligation of fidelity. This right has now and
again in critical circumstances been exercised by
the Pontiffs. * * * Its origin was not the infal
libility, but the authority of the Pope.
It is denied by many that the papacy de
mands the temporal allegiance of papists. Let
me quote the following from an encyclical of
Leo XIII, November, 1885:
We exhort ali Catholics to devote careful atten
tion to public matters, and take part in all mu
nicipal artiiiis and elections, and all public ser
vices, meeting* and gatherings. All Catholics
must make themselves felt us active elements in
daily political hie in countries where they live.
All Catholics should exert their power to cause the
constitution of states to be modeled on the princi
ples of the true church.
To be Romanized means to have the political
power centralized. The Pope is the center of
the system, lie sustains the same relation to
the church that the snn does to the planets.
Around hlru Cardinals, Bishops, priests and
laymen all revolve as satellites. He speaks and
they obey. To them he is God. Thus an abso
lute monarchy is established. Instead of power
diffused amon;,' the people it is localized in the
Pope.
Allow Rome to succeed in her attempts to
Romanize this country and liberty will for
sake her desecrated abode, and despotism will
occupy her temple. Heresy would be declared
to have no rights. The machinery of the lu
miisition would be set to work. The public
school system would be abolished and mental
darkness settle over the land. Church and
State would be united and tiovernment money
would support papal functionaries. Then lib
erty of speech ami freedom of the press would
be no more. The Dark Ages would return and
civilization be a thing of the past.
To prevent such a sad catastrophe the A. P.
A. is organized. H. \V. Bowman.
DISPUTED OREGON GRANT.
Appeal Taken by the Railroad
From Judge Gilbert's De
cision.
It Was Held That the Northern Pa
cific Grant Invalidated the Oregon
and California's.
An effort is being made by the Oregon
and California Railroad Company and
John A. Hurlburt and Thomas L. Evans
to have the decision of United States
Circuit Judge W. B. Gilbert of Portland,
Or., given last September, reversed in the
big land grant fight between it and the
Government. An appeal from the de
cision has been taken to the United States
Court of Appeals, and a transcript was
liled with Frank Monckton. clerk of the
court, yesterday.
Owing to a dispute as to the status of
titles to land in the Willamette Valley and
along the Oreeon and California irrant
suit was brought by the United States
Government against the railroad to cancel
patents ami lestore the land to the public
domain. The grant to the Oregon and
California was made by the act of July
25, 186 G. It was alleged on the side of the
Government that the same lands had been
conveyed to tne Northern Pacific in the
grant of that roaa of July 2, 1864 â over two
years before the Oregon and California
grantâ and, hence, that they were not
within the purview of the subsequent
grant.
To combat this the Oregon and Califor
nia set up the deiense that no provision
had been made for any grant to a"branch
line" of the Northern Pacific through
Oregon from Puget iSound; that this por
tion of the proposed Northern Pacific route
had not been located, and that there was
no map or report of any location of said
branch line accepted by the Commissioner
of tho General Land Office at Washington.
Judge Gilbert took the view that the
grant to the Northern Pacific for
tins particular portion of tlie line
from the Columbia River to the southern
boundary of Oregon via a point "at or near
Portlanu," was a part of its main grant,
and that it had located this portion of the
intended railroad route anil had filed in
1805 a map known as the "Pernam map"
with tlie Commissioner of the General
Land Office, and the effect of the court's
decision was to declare the Oregon and
California's title to the land in dispute
void, in accordance with which he made a
decree favorable to the Government.
The Oregon and California now comes
forward with the usual assignment of er
rors. The document attacks the reasoning
of Judge Gilbert step by step, and still in
sists upon tne litigant road s original con
tentions respecting the supposed forfeit
ure, as it claims, by the Northern Pacific
of the disputed grant lands, and the legal
ity of the Oregon and California's patents
to the lands selected.

RUN THAT COMETH NOT
I Why, It's About the Driest
Rainy Season on Record
to Date.
A NEVADA " HIGH" IS TO BLAME.
Interesting Weather Figures and
Philosophy That Don't Tell How
Much Rain We'll Get.
Yesterday was the eighteenth rainless
day and the sun went down on as bright
and soft a California winter day as ever
promised a warm and sunny morrow.
The entire State is interested in the
question, When will it rain? The City
folks want more of these glorious days
that lure to the park*, hills and highway*.
The farmers In .the interior valleys are
generally nearly at the point of praying
for rain that they can plow and that
seeds may sprout und wheat may grow.
The orchardists are not in a hurry for rain
and warm weather in fear that the fruit
trees will bloom too early and suffer from
frosts. There are all sorts of individual
and class wishes about the rain coming
right away, but the fact is generally recog
nized throughout the State that a good,
widespread rain is at the point of being
badly needed.
Forecast Otlicial W. H. Hammon talked
weather a good deal yesterday, but lie ;
(iidn't know what the rain record was go
ing to be. So far this season we have had
4.1 inches of rain, while the seasonal aver
age on January 9 is about 10 inches. So
we are about (J inches short to date. The
last rain that amounted to more than a )
trace occurred December 21, when .34 of
an inch fell. So far this season, Mr. Ham
mon says, there have boon two raiiib that '
were general over the State. The most
rafn has fallen in the upoer Sacramento
Valley and the upper coast, where the sea
sonal average has been nearly readied.
In December last there were nine rainy
days out of thirty-one, while in December,
I>S!M, there were twenty-two rainy days, or
nine on which rain did not fall. Last year
the rainfall to date was 15.07 inches, "and
during the lirst eight days of last January
three inches of rain fell (luring five days.
There have been but two seasons since
the beginning of the record when less rain
had fallen before January 9 than this
season. In 1876-77 4.01 inches had fallen i
at this date, and in 1878-79 3.2 inches. In
1886-87 the record stood at 4.(53, and in
1883-84 it was 5.1 at this date. These are :
the four seasons, dry in the early part,
corresponding closely with the present
one. This season, then, has so far been
one of tiie driest that San r'rancisco and
the central part of the State has known.
"There is no reason," says Mr. Ham
mon, "that the rainfall should not be i
normal from now on, and the chances are
that it will be. We are now six inches j
behind the average, and the chances are
tliut we will come out six inches behind. 1
The average rainfall is not the probable
rainfall for a season, though. The proba
ble rainfall is only about 20 Inchesâ that
is, there have been as many seasons in
which the rainfall has been "less than 20
inches as there have been in which then'
has been more. The average is raised by i
seasons of very excessive rains, as in 188'j- J
90, when there was 42 inches."
There is a reason for this line dry spell â ,
cold fora while and then nice and warm !
â as many people may have ignorantly
suspected. Mr. Hammon blames it
all on Nevada. It is, the Sagebrush
State, which has no reason to do i
California an injury, that has ko;>t
away the blessed "rains that nature '
has been trying to get to us ever since '
ChrNtmas. The usual output of storms
has cOEoe to the coast from the big storm
factory of the Pacific, but they have been
sheered off to the north by Nevada.
Our rains are all due* to areas of low
pressure which float in to the northern
coast, draw currents from all directions to
the storm center, where the air is the
iightest, and cause precipitation. As these
"lowÂ«" come In and travel across the
continent they are always stopped or
turned by "highs," in which the air is
dense. So when a "low" comes in, the lo
cation of an impeding "high"' will show
where it will or will not rain.
Ever since Christmas a big low lias set

A BIG STATE EXHIBIT.

Members of the California State Board
of Trade are projecting a new departure
in the way of exhibits. In a short time
the exhibit now at Atlanta will be re
turned to this City and installed at 10 Post
street. The proposition, which is male by
W. H. Mills, is that the old stock shall be
increased by what he calls a commercial
exhibit. The present exhibit is of fruit,
farm product?, etc.. of all kinds. The ad
dition will be of all the manufacturing
products in the territory west of the Rocky
Mountains, including Alaska, the Sand
wich and bamoan Islands. These will be
lumber, clay lor pottery, sand Tor glass,
building stone, with descriptions of the
deposits and '|ii irries. Materials for street
construction will also be exhibited.
From the Sandwich Islands and Samoa
will be sugar and its products and the
fruits of the islands; Alaska will furnish
coal, woods and precious- metals, and a
large collection of mining exhibits will be
added. It has heen suggested that com
petitive exhibits be made, and medals and
diplomas he given to counties producing
not the largest quantity but the finest qual
ity of fruits and products. _

Professor Davidson Tells of Them
and Suggests Their Re
moval.
SOME NECESSITIES OF TRADE.
The Federal Government Neglects to
Remove Obstructions to Coast
Navigation.
Professor George C. Davidson told the
S:m Francisco committee on commerce
yesterday afternoon about the dangerous
link? in and nbout l^an Francisco Bay,
and the necessity of their removal. He
also, as chairman of a sub-committee on
unspecified matters, spoke of other things
of importance to commerce.
There were four other sub-corn mittes.
These were on plan of campaign, pilotage,
taxation of shipping and harbor property
and harbor charges. All asked for further
time.
It was decided to have Professor David
son's report printed in full in order that it
might be more carefully considered. It
was also decided to have a special meeting
to consider the masters he had treated, and
decide what action should be taken on
each.
In his report, Professor Davidson said
there were twenty-four separate and dis
tinct dangers threatening vessels on the
coast of California near lÂ»an Francisco
Ray. These were: Noonday Rock 2,
Bonita Channel 1, Fort Point 5, Anita
Rock 1, Arch Rock 1, Shag Rock 1,
Blossom Rock 1. Mission Kock S, Invin
cible Kock 1. Whiting Rock 1. Fifteen-feet
Rock 1, Commission Rock 1, Mile Rock 4
(2 visible). Marfi Island and Navy-yard 1.
Two of these are newly discovered, hav
ing been observed by Lieutenant Leary of
the United States Coast Surrey steamer
McArthur during the last season. One
rock lies three fathoms deep just inside
the fairway line through Bonita Channel.
Three steam vessels are known to have
struck on this rock, but it Las not been lo
cated before.
Professor Davidson explained that he
had spent much time searching records of
wrecks. His list, he said, was not com
plete, as some of the insurance companies
objected to telling him the losses they had
paid. But he iiad made a list and every
item in it was correct In every particular.
Between Bodega Head and Santa Cruz
there have been MS wreck?. From Point
Reyes to Half Moon Bay there have been
317. In San r r.\ncisco Bay and within
tive miles north and pouth of it there have
been wrecks. Yet the Government
has spent only $100,000 in the last forty
tive vea-s in abating dangers, and not a
single cent since 1874. And lately it has
announced that there was no immediate
necessity of removing these menaces to
commerce.
On Arch Rock, Fort Point and Mile
Rock in San Francisco Bay there have
been seventy-four wrecks!. The loss to
the Packard alone on Mission Bay rock
would have paid for its removal.
In speaking of Bonita Channel he said
it was always passable as the sea never
broke in it. The cost of removing the
rock discovered by Lieutenant Leary
would not exceed "$35,000. This, as the
committee recommended, should be done.
It also recommended the placing of prop
erly marked fairway signals on the south
s-hore of the Golden Gate for the vessels
entering or leaving the BonitaThannel.
Of the proposed discontinuance of the
telegraph line from Point Itej-es to this
be said :
â¢The â¢ emmittee has heard with much aston
it and uneasiness that the Government
lempiatcU discontinuing the telegraph
m ?an Francisco to Point Reyes, now
the Weather Bureau and for reporting
in danger. The committee learns from
an authentic list of wrecks and disasters at
Keyes head and the immediate vicinity
ere have been sixteen total wrecks and
. disasters to vessels ashore.
The report then gave a list of fourteen
â¢ rs off Point Reyes, the losses on
wrnch footed up $9812,300. As San Fran
cisco is the nearest place to obtain relief
tugs, a telegraDh line in case of a wreck
would oiten mean the saving of lives and
treasure. Therefore the committee recom
mends that the line, which cost only
$540 a year, be retained, and Congress be
asked "to give $2000 for a house for the
operator at Point Reyes.
It also recommended that Congress be
petitioned to lay a cable between the
shore, near Lake Merced, and the south
east Farallones, with a station at the sum
mit of the island at the lighthouse, and
that a telegraph operator be detailed to
report the weather, vessels and disasters.
This would enable news of a disaster on
the Faraliones to be sent to the City and
help secured, whereas in heavy weather a
wrecked vessel might be a week in com
municating with the main land.
In emphasizing tbe importance of this
request Professor Davidson said there had
been four great ships totally lost on the
1 - aralloses. One of them, the Lucas, was
Jostwith twenty-five lives. Another, the
Franconia. lost $315,000.
In urging a fog vessel for the San Fran
cisco bar he said :
The wreck and disasters at the bar have been
-9, and possibly more. Among these no less
than five pilot- boat* have beeu lost. On the
ouuide of Point Bonita 17 vessels have been
wrecked, of which 12 were total. One of these
cost $200,000, and one was damaged to the
extent of $83,000. On the ouuide of Point
hobos there have been 32 wrecks and disas
ters, of which 22 Were total.
The committee recommended that the
Superintendent of the United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey be requested to place
upon the entrance'sheet of the bay ttie
lines of cables that cross the bay, and also
to mark the area wherein vessels cannot
anchor.
I'rofessor Davidson explained that he
had consulted United States Engineer
Major Heuer in regard to the ship chan
nel to Stockton. From him cc learned
that the oliicial maps do not represent the
actual condition of the channel as to
depth. An attempt was made by dredg
ing to maintain a depth of at least nine
low water, but sometimes only tix
and.
ig to the fact that Stockton is the
wrniirr.:s of the new railroad it wa3
deemed, oi special value to so enlarge the
I I to allow such vessels as could
lie in Bay to go up to Btocktou as
welL <.'. K. Grunsky, a civil engineer well
tinted with the matter, had assured
-or l>avidson that this H possible.
Therefore, the committee suggested :
I lih f. petitioned to grant the ap
Â«ry to carry out the recom
mendation of the United Rates engineer who
has bÂ«d ;n charge the dredging operations for
c oi Uie channel between Stockton
and Suisun Jlay.
Another subject touched on was the
Dg ol r-.-hise in the bbar.3 r . Professor
â  on reported that vessels were in the
J.ahit of dumping theif ballast in trie deep
( baunel near Â»ioat Island. Not only that,
l>ut the Harbor Commissioners dropped
the r- â  iieir dredgers in the same
M-ot and thus filled up that portion of the
bay. The committee recommended that
all ballast and refuse he dumped upon tide
that are being tilled in or which it
- | roposed to fill in.
A vote of. thanks was tendered .Professor
: K>n for h;^ reports.

HIS APPEAL VAIN.
Thomas Upson, the Bogus Lottery
Ticket Mail, Sent to thÂ«> County
Jail for Six Months.
Thomas Upson, alias Joe Johnston, the
bogus lottery ticket man, was convicted in
Judge Low's court about a year ago and
sentenced to pay a fine of $300 and be con
fined in the County Jail for six months.
Upson appealed and Judge Bahrs affirmed
the judgment ol the lower court. The
case was then carried to the Supreme
Court and recently it rendered a decision
against Upson.
On Tuesday the remittitur was sent to
Judge Low and the latter isssued a bench
warrant for Upson's arrest. Yesterday
morning Upon was brought into court.
He made un earnest plea for mercy and
toid the court ho had abandoned the lot
tery business and was leading an honest
life. He asked tLe court to accept the $300
line ami remit the sentence of six months'
imprisonment. His appeal was of no avail
and the Judge ordered him into the cus
tody of the Sheriff.
[fpson's statement that he was leading
an honest life had a grim sense of humor
about it. It was only the other day that
he was arrested by Postothce Inspector
Erwin for using the mails to further a
scheme to defraud. He was captured
through decoy letters under the name of
L. Schwartz of Reno, to wLorn he for
warded a quantity of counterfeit lottery
tickets.
WERE IMPROPERLY SUED
Judge Hunt Has Released Some
of the Heydenfeldt
Defendants.
Ashton and Jacobs Should Not Have
Been Included in a Suit to Set
Aside Deeds.
Judge Hunt has sustained the demurrer
of Charles Ashton and Julius Jacobs to
the complaint of Henrietta Heydenfeldt,
who was suing to have set aside the trans
fer of property from Heydenfeldt to
Elizabeth 0. Howard and Katherine Col
lins. The demurrer was upon several
grounds, principal among which were
that the statute of limitations barred the
action and that there was a misjoinder of
parties and actions. In rendering opinion
the court comments on those points as
follows:
In this case it is not alleged thp.t the plaintiff
was ignorant of the acts or fraud complained
of at the lime of the commission thereoi; nor
does it appear that she was ignorant thereof at
tue time of her husbands death. Assuming that
the statute of limitations would not commence
to ruu against her until after her husband's
death, it is not alleged that the fraudulent acts
complained of were discovered by her within
a period of three years prior to the commence
ment of this action.
In referring to the fact that there was a
misjoimier of parties the court says :
Assuming that the matters charged against j
the defendants:, Ashton and Jacobs, iv refer- i
| ence to their fraudulent procurement of the '
I probate of the will of Ileydc-ufeld:. deceased, !
constitute a cause of action egainst them, such, i
a cause of action is improperly united with the !
cause of action asserted against the demurring i
parties. 1: U rlear that the demurring de- '
fendants are in no way concerned with the re- j
suit of the probate proceedings in the estate of |
the deceased. Their conveyances were ex- \
ecuted by the deceased during his lifetime;
whether the will was fraudulently probated or |
the court was imposed upon Ls a "matter of no !
concern whatever to these defendant":.
The matters charged against the defendants, !
Ash ton Â«nd Jacobs, are inserted in the com- i
plaint apparently for the purpose of obtaining
an order setting aside the probate proceediugs
in question; indeed this relief is prayed for in
the bilL As these matters in no way relate to
the defendants' demurring or affect the prop
erty in question claimed by them, I am of the
opinion that there is an improper joinder of !
causes of action herein.
Ten days were given the plaintiff to j
amend her complaint in accordance with
the suggestions of the opinion filed. Should '
previous ignorance of the alleged fraud
not be shown, however, another demurrer
under the statute of limitations will finish
the case.
SEALING KEGULATIONS.
Fifty Copies Arrive ut Last at the I
Custom-House From Washington.
The sealing regulations for 1896 have !
at last arrived from Washington, about j
fifty ijopies having been received at the!
Custom-house. Only two or three of the l
Ban Francisco fleet have put to sea, the i
others having preferred to wait until copies i
of the new regulations came.
As is pretty well known by this time, the !
regulations require the sealers to take out â 
special licenses and carry distinctive flags.
A recent letter from the Treasury Depart- !
ment to Collector Wise emphasized the j
necessity of taking out the licenses whether
Intending to hunt within tne area of the |
Paris award or not, as any craft caught in
the award area would be liable to seizure
if not possessed of such a license on the
presumption that it was there for the pur
pose of hunting seals.
By the act of Congress of April 6, 1894,
giving effect to the award of the Pans Tri-
Dunal of Arbitration, sealing within the
sixty-mile zone around the Pribilov Isl
ands is positively forbidden, and in the
award area it is forbidden during tlie close
season (May, June and July). Sealing
within the waters of the award area is per
j raitted at any other time of the year, pro-
I vided the act and the regulations are
j complied with as to special licenses, flags,
j liglft 1 ?, logbook entries, reports and char
acter of weapons used. The award area
| extends from the Pacihc Coast westward to
i the one hundred and eightieth meridian of
longitude and its south Jimit is the thirty*
fifth parallel of north latitude. Sealers
are in the area as soon as outside the
Golden Gate.
Ttie important changes in the new
regulations are: First, a requirement that
vessels carry at night two vertical lights of
l.atural color in a conspicuous position, at
leMt ten feet above the'deck and visible in
clear weather at least one mile; second,
that all vessels bound for .Bering Sea must
first report to the revenue cutter officer at
Atton Island or the Deputy Collector of
Customs at Unalaska, which oHicers shall
proDerly secure under seal the guns and
ammunition of the vessels so reporting
and attest their logbooks, and, third, that
ail masters of vassels shall report their
catches to the Custom-houses at the re
tarn ports and verify their logbooks.
Their logs must be scrupulously Kept in
every detail. â¢

WANT CAUCASIAN WAYS
Chinese Merchants Organize to
Learn Them and Get
Protection.
A Mutual Benevolent Association on
American Lines, but With
Chinese Ideas.
Chinatown is "'strictly ud to date," ac
cording to Tim Cox I}s.q., a young Chi
nese who speaks English fluently with a
slight French accent. Its latest exempli
fication of the fact above mentioned is the
incorporation under the laws of California
of a mutual benevolent association to pro
mote matrimony, the rearing of children,
good morals and manners, education and
charity among its members. This society
is to be Known as the Tim Yee Kon^ Sow
Benevolent Association of Low (^uong
Chang Chew.
"The Low Quong Chung Chew i 3 a so
ciety tliat lias existed in Uliina for the past
2800 years," Mr. Cox explained yesterday.
"Its membership is made up entirely of
those who can prove themselves lineal de
ecendants of the four great warriors whose !
fainiiy names make up the title of the {
organization. Though there are many j

eligible in San Francisco no society
has been organized until a month ago.
Then I took a tumble to myself,"
and. be -mi ed condescendingly as the
slang tripped from his tongue, "and inter
ested a number of wealthy merchants in
the idea. ;.â â¢"â '
"As a result, nearly 600 were found
ready to join such a society. I v.-as fly
enough to know that a white attorney
could help us. -So I went to see M. ?.[.
Foot* 1 , and he prepared our papers of in
corporation for us, and we are now a legal
body under the laws of this State all right,
all right." ' ;
In order to join, an applicant must bo
able to prove to the satisfaction of the in
vestigating committee his descent- from
either of the . great warriorsâ Low, Quoin:,
Chung or Chew. He must be a "law
abiding resident" of this State," and be
"imbued with a proper and due respect for
the great American Nation ana the laws
framed by Its Legislature." â 
The applicant pays a $â¢"> initiation fee.
Then, if accepted, he pays $2 50 annually
as dues, with an assessment now and then
for sick benefits, etc. In return for this he
receives the following benefit.-:
BENEFITS.
Section 1, On the marriage of any member this
association Shall don $10 as a bridal present
to encourage matrimony. . . .
See. 'J. Upon the birth of a child to the wife
of any member the association shall also donate
$10 to encourage the rearing nf.cUildrenl 'â¢ " â¢ -
. v "c. 3. Should a member meet with- an acci
dent or be overtaken . by*siekness, poverty; old
age or infirmity, the society wiil make some
provision for. his support,' and if iii the case of "
old age or Infirmity he desires to return to
China ho will, upon application, be provided
with passage to China. . â  , .
Sec. 4. Should death cut short a. member's
usefulness in this association the association
will donate $100 for funeral expenses.'. The
widows and orphans of the deceased member,
will be cared and provided for by the associa
tion.
One of the main aims of the society, Mr.
Cox explained, was to assist the' members
to understand American methods and
habits of speech. He announced that he
"pot close to himself" some time before.
Mr. Cox married a white eirl about five
years ago. He Bays that at the meetings
of the society American methods of gov
ernment will be discussed. Then he and
his wife and others who are expert Eng
lish scholars will devote an hour or so in
imparting their knowledge to their fellows.
The board of directors of the society are
Low Kong (Jam, Quan Kun, Chung Tong
Kee, Low Vim and Tim Cox. These are
all wealthy merchants and property
owners. Chew How is the president and
Tim Cox the secretary.
Mr. Cox was born in San Juan, Nevada
County. His parents took him to China
when he was little, but as the climate did
not agree with him he was brought back
to California by an uncle. On hi 3 return
he was taken into the family of George W.
CoJt, a mining engineer, then in charge of
the Sierra Onion Water and Mining Com
pany, and by him raised to manhood and
educated. When 21 years old Tim came
to this City, and soon married. He is now
cook for E. C. Burton, the caterer, but as
soon as the Tim Yee Kong Sow Benevo
lent Association of Low Quong Chune
Chew gets to running smoothly he win
devote himself entirely to its affairs.

lack of decisive action by the property
owners, the Street Committee of the board
has at last taken a determined stand on
the question of converting Folsom street
into a bituminized boulevard, and at the
next regular meeting will ask for an ap
propriation of $35,000 to begin the work
at once.
When the committee met yesterday
morning G. L>. Shadburne and A. B.
Maguire, representing the property-owners
along Folsom street, were present to
press the claims of the boulevard and as
certain why the board had so long delayed
action in the matter.
', Mr. jÃhadburne said that in the light of
recent events it appeared very much to the
residents of the , south side of Market
street that that, portion of the City was
beirfg slighted to allow the efforts of the
Street department to be directed to the
north side. 1 ' Me thought that while the
money in improving the streets of
the north side was' being expended in a
good cause the south side should not be
forgotten and that there was one place
: where the. money could be used to the
utmost advantageâ the Folsom boulevard.
i Supervisor Hughes wanted to know
whether the property-owners thought that
$25,000 would be sufficient to do the work
contemplated. Mr. Maguire replied that
the sum named would not pay the bills by
$75,000. â¢â¢ He thought that the board
. should appropriate at least $100,000. to do
S the work.
j Supervisor .Benjamin protested that in
: the present state of the City treasury such
1 an amount was out of the question as the
I City's, money was divided into specific
I funds and none of them could stand a
draft of $100,000.
i Maguire persisted in demanding tnat the
j amount asked by the property-owners be
! appropriated and in consequence he came
i near being thrown out of the committee
room. As is the custom when a petitioner
' has finished â  his "address 'tile bailiff re
quested him.to retire so that the commit
tee might have an opportunity to discuss
the matter wit.. out interruption. This
seemed to anger Maguire, for he pro
tested .loudly, against leaving, saying:
"This is a free country and I have aright
to do as I please."
The employe of the board insisted that
it was a rule of the committee that peti
tioners should retire while their claims
were being discussed and that he could
await, a decision outside. He again de- '
i manded that Maguire make use" of the
door that had been opened for his exit.
'â¢I will not go out!" shouted Maguire, ;
I "1 am going to stay here until I see what
! this committee Intends to do."
Bailiff Donald did not waste any more
words, but prepared to peel off his coat.
and when he saw that an ejectment, iii
j which lie would play a star part, was im-
I minent, Magu'ire went out, muttering pro
i tests at every step.
Alter he had gone the committee de- i
bated the matter at length, each member
expres&UiK â â â  the opinion ; : that 'â > the -work'
should be done, but that no such sum aa
; 100,000 could be spent during the present,
year. It was decided to advocate the ap
j propriatioH: of $35,000 at ones and such
I mrtiier sums in t tie future as were needed
or could be spared.- â¢ , -;â¢â .
!j In order to define i's position in ' the
I matter the following report, Which will be
presented at the meeting of the board next
' Monday, was adopted: "',',' '^'.v, '
! In the matter of repairing Folsorn street
] with bituminous pavement, your committee
I fuels that the property-owners on said street,
| in their representations, have been unjust to
! the members of your committee who'- navy
always been in favor of and supported the mo
tion to make an appropriation /or the special
I purpose, but the board refused to sanction or
allow such appropriation 10 be male.
. Your committee has been met with the
j statement, in their advocacy of this matter of
I repairing streets with bituminous pavement
j which have been heietofore paved and a<
i cepted, that it has been established as.a cus
tom that property-owners contribute their
quota to such improvement; that in the action
on -Van Ness avenue and other streets cited,
I wnere a change of pavement was desired
j by the property-owners, the City and County
has only contributed in the case of i Van Ness
I avenue one-hall "of the expense, and lor .other
blocks the sum 01 $750. . 'â  - â¢ * â  â  â 
. Theseicxpenditures, it la claimed, were made,
: toeuable the property-owners to have a smooth,
ductile, bituminous pavement, and : Unit the
board believed in aiding these. improvements,
that they were of mutual advantage, and .1 that
in the matter of Folsom street, so strenuously
] urged, no Intention or disposition has J been
shown 10 contribute 1 on the same lines as
â  adopted in other cases. . - â¢ â¢
It is proper to state that the members of your
i committee do not hold and never held such
1 opinions, because, tinder the law, after accept
ance of a street, It was and is the opinion of.
your committee that the City should pay for
all improvements.. Your committee recom-
I mends that the sum of $35,000 be appropriated

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.â The stock mar
ket to-da- was dull, but the dullness was more
than mi up by tie strength, l 'â â¢â¢ bears seemed
anxious to i educe their short lines, and to this is
attributed the attempt mad- to smash Lather
preferred and Manhattan. it was said that the
drive at these stocks was made with a view of de
moralizing holders of granger and other leading
shares. Instead of acoo plish i g its object nearly
the entile list ruled strong from start to h'nish, ;
and each slight reaction brought in buyers, with
the result o: establi liing the higher quotations rul
ing before the raids.
Higher cables from London, the ease in money
on cull, with lisht withdrawals of gold from the
sun-treasury and the belief that arrangements
have be^n perfected to assist the treasury in case
offuruier heavy withdrawals were the important
bull factors. ("here was also less talk, of probable i
large shipments of gold by Saturday's steamers, ;
The advance in prices was equal to %@134 per

taxes on the property would he increased, but, the
matter Is already before the Court of Appeals, and
a decision is expected at lime. Until this is
decided it Is hardly to be expected that any effort
will be made by the city authorities to put on
more traias. Leather preferred broke from 60y 3

CHICAGO MAKKETS. .
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 9.â While the apprehen
live feeling in wheat was less pronounced this
morning than on either of the two days Just pre
vious, there was, nevertheless, some disquietude
HIM lingering in the market. This was evident
from the fact that a drop of a few fractions in Brit
!sli con sola subsequent to the opening was fo:
--owed by a sharp rise of y 2 c In the value of wheat.
[â¢he Cincinnati Price Current summary afforded
the market some firmness. "The start was rather
â¢asy, rlce, ruling unchanged to s/ 8 c under yes'er
lay's close. The recovery already mentioned then
look place, afier which comparative steadings
prevailed. Receipts at Chicago were 61 cars. With
lrawals from store were 39,211 bushels. The
Northwest received 538 cars, against 421 last
Thursday and 207 a year ago. Liverpool cables
*' re quiet and steady. Consols recovered later In
Jlie day and wheat then weakened an sold off with
in! nuy unusual event or happening in the trade.
b'xport clearances were large" at 490,000 bushels,
"losing Paris cables were lower, Benin were
aigher end Antwerp unchanged. Reports of corre-
Ipondence of anything but a peaceful nature be
i-verii Berlin and London caused another rally j
liter noon, sequent to which there was but lit- j
f.e in eiesi in the market. May wheat opened from
ISOyitC to 59V 8 c sold between 60y 8 <Â£605/ c and

Estimated receipts for to-morrow 601 cars.
OATSâ There was a fair inquiry for oats, pre
sumably to cover shorts, and an early easy tone
was displaced by one of more firmness. Receipts
were 124 cars, and 141.467 bushels were taken I
from store. The tone suffered . some by the later
decline in wheat, and recessions occurred, but I
there was a recovery before the close. May oats j
closed unchanged from yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 134 cars.

An Oakland National Bank
Ready to Take Part of
the Issue.
CRUDE PETROLEUM FOR FUEL.
A Company Organized to Carry on
Plantations in Central
America.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call.)
{â¦08 Broadway. Jan. 9. j
The proposed sale of United States bonds
has occasioned some interest here, and P.
K. Bowles of the First National Bank has
telegraphed to New York that every bank
should subscribe to the extent of at least
i"> per cent of the bonds it already holds,
and that his bank is ready to do so.
In speaking o' the matter Mr. Bowles
said this afternoon: "I believe that any
1 ank here which buys these bonds can sell
them again and that they will be a popu
lar investment for people of small means.
A $50 Government bond can be passed in
trade like currency and at the same time
be bearing interest. That advantage will
help to offset the low rate of interest- 4 per
cent.
"The principal difficulty is in knowing
how much premiam yon must bi'itoget
-. It would have been more con
venient if ti.e Government haii offered a
bond at par and asked you to bid on the
rate of interest."'

OAKLAND, Cai... .'an. 9.â Mrs. C. L.
Bock "f this city is- in correspondence with

tion which will enable her to recover val
uable minim: land in Utah.
The property in question consists of five
mines near Warm Creek, Millard County,
Utah, which belonged to Mrs. Bock's
fatner, Charles Darnbach, and should have
i.i her and other members of her
had the owner's intentions been
.i hito effect.
Mr. Darnbach was a pioneer of Cahfor
tlling at Dutch Fiat in El Dorado

May Result in a Suit.
OAKLAND. Cal., Jan. o.â The city will
probably be involved in a suit before the
matter of the removal of the basalt blocks
with which some of the railway companies
have paved the space between their tracks
is sett! d. Under an ordinance lately
i Street Superintendent Miller has
notified the Piedmont Company to make
repairs on Washington street and the San
Pablo Cable Company to take up the
Mocks on Broadway. The latter has asked
for time, as the road may be changed to
an electric line, which would necessitate a
change of tracks, and they .would like to
have ail the work done at the same time.
The Piedmont Company has taken no
:iance with the notice, and
Superintendent Bishop holds that the
road will not make the change, and that
the city has not the power to force them
to. The matter is now in the hands of the
C it y Attorney awaiting his decision as to
the city's power to do the work itself.
Will Become Coffee-Planters.
OAKLAND, Cai.., Jan. 9.â For some
time past several prominent Oaklanders

lishing a coffee plantation in Mexico or

--O<X), under the name of El Compito Coffee

needed National legislation for rivers and
harbors will be the aim of the convention.
A Local Train to Niles.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 9.â The people
of Niles are very much interested in the
rumor that the railroad company will
soon extend the local train service to their
town. There an- at present five trains
fruin Niles to San Francisco, but it is ex
pected that there will soon be a train
every two hours. This service would be of
little extra expense to the railroad and
wcniM be of great advantage to the
country about Niles. It is considered
certain that the Southern Pacific Company
must make improvements in its service in
view of the, competing road, which will
soon be its rival.
A Poultry Show Next.

ble prize. A great variety of birds will be
shown and the resources of the country

mings of Rock Island, 111., will act as one
of the judges.
Will Burn Crude Petroleum.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 9.â The Judson
Manufacturing Company at Emeryville is
making an experimental test of crude
petroleum as a substitute for coal in their
blast furnaces. Mills with which the Jud
son works are in competition are experi
menting with oil for a fuel, out after dif
ferent methods than are used by the latter
company. The oil can be purchased at a
very reasonable figure, and considering the
difference in the amount of dirt and smoke
made by the two as fuels the latter may
be found rhe most economical to use.
At the Mucilouought
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. o.â The Aramenti

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 189 6.
SCHAFFER USES THREATS.
The McCloud Rehearing Ends
With a Disgraceful
Scene.
REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT.
Mayor Davie and Chief Lloyd Mixed
Up in a Police Complica
tion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cam.,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 9. Â«'
The rehearing accorded to W. M. Mc-
Cloud, an ex-policeman, was concluded to
day. Perjury was committed somewhere
as both sides flatly contradicted each
other, and McCloud's attorney, Aldrich,
asked Mr. Schaffer a question that brought
on a riot.
McCloud has had seme valuable wit
nesses, including ex-Mayor Pardee and
Sheriff White.
The row this afternoon wa3 precipitated
while Policeman Andrews was on the
stand. Attorney Aldrich asked the wit
ness if Mr. Babb had not said that he had
seen Schaffer and Torn Downey leaving a
questionable resort, "drunk and in com
pany of disreputable women." This
an;;ered Schqffer, and waiting up to Al
drich he iaid :
"No man that casts such a slur on my
family as that should go out of this room
without eating iiis words. As to your
cowardly reference to the memory of' Mr.
Downey, a respected man who was laiu in
ins grave over a year ago, 1 will say noth
ing.' 1
S naffer then took hold of Aldrich' 8
Masonic emblem and continued: "You
are a Mason, I sef, and so am I. lam
ashamed that one should so disgrace his
manbooo by such contemptible behavior."
Aldrich said that he did not mean it in
the way take:i by Schaffer. Then the case
was taken under advisement.
During the hearing Captain Fletcher
said that McCloud's record as a policeman
w:>s bai. and that any one who hehaved a?,
McCloud did was best off the force.. On
being questioned farther ho sai>; that ihere
was a division in the Police Department
and that, although tiiere was always more
or less friction, it is now pronounced more
than ever. Captain Wilson also said that
McCioud's record as a policeman was not
good.
Patrolman Lamping, who was a witness
for Schaffer at the investigation, has been
suspended from th force, and syc charges
were preferred against him to-day Dy Chief
Lloyd. It is alleged that he sat down
while on his beat, that he does not pay
bis deb ; s. that he tried to tix a case in the
Police Court, that he smokodjbefore 1 a. m.,
that he was a sent from hi> beat with
out permission and that be is totally un
reliable. The charges will be heard Thurs
day morning.
To add to the complications already ex
isting m the department M;iyor Davie has
threatened to suspend Chief of Po
Lloyd if he again refuses to let the city ex
pert see his books.
A UNIVERSITY RESERVOIR
Two Dams Will Be Constructed
on the Stiles Property in
the Foothills.
Proposed Extension of the Oakland
Electric Railway to North and
West Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Cai,., Jan. 9.â Of the seve
ral projects now under consid eration for
the improvement of the University of Cali
fornia reservation at Berkeley, that of
building a reservoir seems to be the most
extensive and the most fruitful of lasting
good. The water supply of the university
has been wholly inadequate for the pa'jt fif-
teen or twenty years. On this account it has
been impossible to grow any gra3s or orna
mental trees on the campus save in the
botanical and agricultural garden?. Even
these have suffered from the lack of suf
ficient moisture. Various methods have
been resorted to in order that the supply
niicht be increased, but without avail.
The hills back of the chemistry building
are literally perforated with tunnels and
drifts made in the attempt to strike a flow
of water, but to no purpose. Several
thousand dollars was spent in executing
this work. Durine the presidency of
Horace Davis a piece of property compris
ing twenty-seven acres, situated on the
eastern boundary of the university reser
vation, was purchased with a view to
using a portion of it for a reservoir. Three

the University of California, Berkeley.
acres more adjoining this tract were neces
sary, and for tnese the Board of Repents
offered Mrs. Stiles $3000. She asked $15,
--000. and so the deal was not made at that
time. Subsequently the board entered
suit condemning the property. This has
recently been decided in favor of the Re
gents, and the appraisers set the price- of
the land at !f 3OOO, which sum has been
paid to Mrs. Stiles. This gives the uni
versity undisputed possession of a great
natural watershed, which pours down its
waters into Strawberry CreeK. In winter,
after a heavy shower, the water rushes
down in torrents, but in midsummer the
creelc is dry in places for a portion of the
season.
The property purchased embraces in its
area springs which have almost a per
petuai flow, and also a natural reservoir

more iii length. it is the purpose of the

supposed to belong to, Fred Fonzo, the ex
restaurant-keeper of Berkeley, were sold at
public auction by Marshal Lloyd to satisfy

In order to raise tiie money he sold his

BLIND, BUT A WHEELMAN
The Ride of Newel Perry, the
Sightless Cycler, to and From
San Jose.
Made the Entire Round Trip From
Berkeley Without an Accident.
An Extraordinary Feat.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 9. â Newel
Perry, the phenomenal blind student in
the senior class at the university, ha
added another chapter to his already sin
gularly brilliant career. Lust Friday, in
Newel Perry, the Blind Studeat Who
Rode to San Jose and Back on a
Bicycle.
[From a photograph.]
company with a friend â GiloertS. Walker,
U. C, '96 â he rode to San Jose on a bi
cycle. Perry is totally blind and has been
so for fourteen years, but he has neverthe
less managed to learn the art of bicycle
riding so that he is able to find his way
unassisted along any street or road with
which he is acquainted and over which he
has nassed on foot.
In taking his long run to San Jose last
week Perry's companion roue ahead. H<
carried a bell on his wheel and thus the
blind biker was able to keep in the road.
The two wheelmen started from Berke
ley at noon on Friday, going by way of
San Leandro and stopping for tlie night at
Mount Eden. San Jose was reached on
Saturday night, and the return trip was
made on Sunday as far as .9 an Mateo. from
which place Perry and Walker took the
train to San Francisco.
At this season of the year the roads, be
tween Oakland and San Jose especially,
are decidedly rough and in places it is
somewhat difficult for a person with the
use '>: all his senses to make ordinary time,
but L'erry "pumped" his machine Fill the
way and escaped without a sc.-aich. He
met with several falls ana his tire became
punctured once or twice, but the blind
rider did not even so much as receive a
single bruise. Perry is very modest about
memioning his extraordinary feat of
wheelrnanship and considers bicycle riding
a very ordinary proceeding, lii speaking
of how lie learned to ride he said: "I
rented a wheel one day and went to Col
lege way, where I mounted and tried to
ride, but, of course, I fell off. I tried again,
and kept on trying until I wa- able to keep
my seat, and I see no reason why any
blind person should not do the same."

Four of the men were dressed as ladies

the musicians would commence a song.
When the song was finished the uoor
was thrown open and all who could en

NO TRAMPS IN ALAMEDA
The Encinal City Avoided Be
cause of Severe Sentences
for Vagrants.
Feeling Over the Bovard Criticism of
Clubs Seems to Be on the
Increase.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 9. âTramps are
very scarce in Alameda. It is a little off
their main line of travel, but tlie main
reason why they give the city a wide berth
is the activity of the constables and the
sternness of the local magistrates. Justice
Morris has acquired a reputation that hns
penetrated the councils of all trampdom
and there are no chalk signs pointing
toward Alameda as a eood nlace for the
hobo fraternity.
On Tuesday a tramp named Henry
Curtis was tip before the Justice. He was
asked why his fraternity has been so shy
of Alameda of late anu gave as the reason :
"We don't like judge Morris. He give-;
us from thirty days to three months and
other Judges let us off with three to rive
days."

MANY SUFFERERS HELPED
Satisfactory Reports of the
Officers of the Children's
Hospital.
THE MORTGAGE ALL PAID OFF.
The Annual Meeting Shows a Very
Hopeful Condition of
Affairs.
The board of lady managers of the
Children's Hospital held its annual meet
ing yesterday afternoon and the reports
of the officers showed that the institution
is extending the sphere of its activity and
that the affairs of the hospital are on a
thoroughly satisfactory basis.
Mrs. E. 11. Harrington, the president,
stated in her report that though the past
year had not been without its trials it had,
on the whole, been the most satisfactory
in the history of the hospital. The report
continued :
During the (irst six months of the year there |
was a decline in the number of patients ad- !
mitted, but the lu^t hali year has shown a con-
Biderable Increase, and there is reason to be
lli ye that the coming year will show a still !
larger increase. Those who have availed !
themselves of Us advantages are unanimous in j
their praise o { t t, e Cftre and s kiiif u i treatment
they have received.
Our training school for nurses has become a i
magniflcem institution in Ban Francisco. At
an earlier j>eri>><l in its history it was regarded :
ii- a doubtful experiment by some members of
the medical profession, but at this time, thanks |
to the Intelligent training of our nurses, 1 ' :
know of no enlightened physician who does;
not gladly avail himself of their services.
The report called attention to the need
of a nurses' home and concluded by ex
pressing a hopeful view of the coming
year.
The recording secretary, Mrs. L. L. Dun
bar, read an exhaustive review of the past
year's events, part of Which was as fol
lows:
Five hundred and fifty-two cases hnve been
cared for during the year. Of these three-hun
dred and twenty-five were children, one hun
dred and torty-einht of whom were absoluetly
free case-., of the women, thirty-two were free
cases. I";. 'iii our adult department we depend
in a lame measure for support foi our chil
dren's department. The necessity for a new
operating-room for adults forces itself upon
us, and active means must be taken in
regard to it without further delay.
The kindergarten, in its bright sunny cor
ner, is still one of the attractions of the hospi
tal. Jt is wortii a visit, this strange little
school of *'the lame, the halt and the blind,"
who hobble in on crutches, arc rolled in in
chairs, or led in by little companions, afflicted
themselves, but mil of sympathy for those
they > onsiiler more unfortunate.
One m.-morial r< om and four memorial beds â
the Daughters (the gift of Mrs. D. S.
Murphy),the Edith (W. K.Whiuier), theCarlton
C. Carlton and the Zadigâ have been estab
lished. The memorial bed committee has *o
systematized their work that, the beds are in
admirable order.
At the dispensary a great amount of good
has been done, but financially it has run be
hind. The average number of patients there
each month was "267. The class oi patients are
the very poor of our City, and the sum of 25
cents charged for drugs was more than many
of them could afford; in these cafes no charge
whs made. All credit is due our dispensary
staff aad-nuntea. for they ha\e gone checriully
wiuuever called.
The report expressed thanks to givers of
donations to the hospital and to promoters '
of entertainments, and it stated that, -
thanks to the Â»ift of ifoOO from W. F.
W.ittier, to be applied to t c payment of
the mort^a^e on the hospital, efforts had ;
been made to raise more money, and now ;
$5u83, or nearly one-half the amount of the
mortgage, had been raised.
When the Wilinerdini; bequest was r>aid
it was decided to pay ofi the balance of the
mortgage. This was done, and the hospi
tal is now free from any rnortira^e.
The medical report, submitted by the
resident physician, Dr. Fannie C. Hutch
ins, showed that twenty-one cases had been i
received from other institutions, and that !
twenty-four nationalities had been repre- ;
sented by the year's patients. The report
of tho treasurer, Mr*. F. H. Green, was as
follows: Cash on hand on January 1, 1895,
}'_-V-l 24: receipts for the year. $52,354 39;

LOCAL BREWERS SCARED
Have Called a Sudden Halt on
the Threatened Cut-Rate
Beer War.
THE DRIVERS ARE ORGANIZING
The Internal Troubles May Be Patched
Up So as to Combat Labor
Unionism.
The local brewer? have become thor
oughly alarmed at what they have done
toward precipitating a cut-throat beer
war and are now discussing plans to re
unite their scattering and various interests
in the Brewers 1 :â â  live Association,
which came bo near going to pieces at the
stormy meeting last Friday. A new dan
ger or, to be more correct, two new dan
ger* have appeared. As these come from
a source outside of the association they
appear all the more formidable.
It is the old skeleton of organized labor
that is again rattling in the brewers'
closet.
The fight among the brewers themselves
promised to be a merry one. It was started
by the California and Broadway breweries
cutting the price of steam beer from $5,
tin.' standard price adopted by the asso
, â  -â¢ - 50 per barrel. At least
was the finding of the investigation
committee, and the latter recommended
that* ition make a grand cut in
â¢der i" discipline the offending
brew< a l< ssi n to all others
â¢who might be inclined t>> cut that they
had b a little cautious before do-
:i this subject the brewers were di
: ibis division almost split the
wide open, judging from ttie
- of several who were present.
Such a course srould cause every In. â 
it and work for himself, no matter
â  1. The members oi the assu
n wransled until dinnertime, and
left the ; â  Lthout taking action
upon the matter. - 'he meeting the
brewers have be< Lngtbe
n I tbe pro
prieti mailer brew an to
lee! ;i â  "f the lar. â  who
-tart tho CUt and crush
â¢
. â¢â¢.mem was used that, while
; be offenders in a free right,
many of the <>th- rs would also go to the
wall. For all this conservatism there was
stiil enough of the fighting element left
ii> the a^- illy among the
rewers and the syndicate, represent
ing five breweries, to make the tiroak.
\\ bile these matters were being dls
e brewers 1 old enemy â organized
laborâ appeared .i_-a:n and called a halt in
the progre ernal troubles. It is
not the Brewery Workmen's I'liion, for
t lie brewers bare an idea of that organiza
tion's strength and power.
Tue scare was caused by the brewery
wagon drivers ana tlu-ir belpei
the brewery foremen. Daring the past
w< ck or two these men have been holding
-, the drivers and the
I forming a new
ixation and deman line better â¢â 
What the foremen are hoidinj me- tings
for lias aot been learned, but it is believed
that they want to Â£e< tlieruselves in a
Â« to demand the light to hire the
men who work under them. At preseni
luen objectionable to the foremen are
ently pat t > work in order to please
the bosses without regard t i their qualifi
i ability. Tnis has always been
a thorn in the i â  : c of the foremen, who
have as a rule preferred to Mate competent
n brewery workinemen under their
charge.
It is the proposed drivers' organization
that is causing the greatest alarm. Four
V 'ars ago the drivers and helpers be
jonged to the Brewery Workmen a Union.
The drivers then received $100 per month
and the he] Â£Â£ per month. When the
trouble between the brewers and the work
men broke out, t lie drivers and helpers de-
I the union at the rate of twenty-rive
and fifty at a meeting and stood by the
brewer: . Fur tiieir fidelity they have been
rewarded in a left-handed man tier. 'While
the drivers' wages have remained practi
cally the same because of the responsi
bility of the positions and the large
amounts of money the driver? have to
handle, the helpers have fared ill. From
$*â¢' a montli, their wages have dwindled
down to $10 and $12 a week.
The bosses have not dared to cut the
drivers' wa^es for another reason. In the
event of a driver refusing tj accept the re
duction, he could have and go into the ser
vice of another brewer, an 1 a:! his patrons
. go with him. With the helpers,
there was no loss of customers to fe;:r, ana
any stout yonng man could be easily
broken in to till the place vacated by a
- orhO'Would leave his job.
There is, however, a feeling of brother
hood between the drivers and their help
ers, and both have considered with a
keen regret that the latter are being
crowded to the wall in the matter of wages.
As soon as the present strife broke out
in the ranks of t lie brewers the drivers and
helpers evidently recognized that now is
a good opportunity to" make a stand for
better wagesâ the wages of four years ago
if possible. To this etui they have been
holding small meetings ami in great
y dnring the pa?t ten days or two
weeks. The object was to discuss ways
and means and form a plan whereby the
entire calling can spring into an organiza
tion before the brewers have a chance to
t.:k>- steps to nip the project in the bud.
However, some one in order to curry favor
let the cat out of the bag, and the animal
was regarded us such a formidable black
creature that the brewers were alarmed
lest it cross their path and bring them
bad nick.
This and the secret meetings of the fore
men, the objects of which are not fully
understood, are what have caused a halt
in the hostilities in the Brewers' Protective
Association camp. Now many who a few
days ago were talking fight and advocating
a cut in the price of beer are earnestly dis
cussinp: the advisability of burying the
hatchet for the time being and standing
shoulder to shoulder agaftist what they re
card as a common ' enemy â organized
labor.
hi' not at all unlikely that at the next
meeting they will manage to patch up a
tort of peace.
WANT HARSIN ARRESTED
The Secret Service A cents Are -Eager
to Vrosecuie Howell's Prin
cipal Witness.
From the United States Secret Service
Division the information comes indirectly
that efforts are being made by the Federal
authorities to bring about the arrest of C.
J). Haxsin, who was the principal wit:ic o ?
for Martin I). Howeil at the latter' s first
trial. <
An indictment of Harsin by the Tinted
States (irand Jury is sai 1 to have been re- !
ported two wc-eks ago and placed upon the j
secret file. It was generally supposed that \
the defeat of the Secret Service Division |
by the verdict of acquittal in the Howtll ;
case would r llt a st Â°P to i ts endeavors to j
bring Howell's original witnesses to the j
United States District Court here for trial j
on various charges.
The effort to have Harsin indicted was
started While the Howeii trial was in prop- j
..nd Howell's attorneys wen- then in- j
clined to believe t hat ii was bei:i<; made i
merely for effect, anil that after the trial
terminated, if it proved unfavorable to the
Government, the investigation of ilarsin j
and other witnesses of Howell would be
dropped.
The charge against llarsin is that be in
vented the story for Howell that the coun
terfeit money sent by Fred Marsh and
Charles Murray, of the "North Beach
â  {rang." to Stockton was really for Matt
j Jones. This story Matt Jones, who on
the two former trials never put In an ap
pearance, came to this City from Mexico
on the third and final trial to flatly Cuntra-
I diet, and his testimony was positive
enough against it. The Government de
tectives say that Harsin was promised
$1000 by Howell to invent this story, and
that he pot $500 cash, with an unfulfilled
promise of the balance.
It is given out that Harsin was in Ne
braska conducting a doubtful land scheme
when last heard of. A warrant for his ar
rest has been sent on to Nebraska.
Free lectures.
The Board of Education has decided to give a
course of free lectures in the auditorium of the
Girls' High School, corner of Scott and Geary
streets. The committee appointed to carry out
the instructions of the board baa announced
ttiht the first lecture will be given on Friday
evening, January 10, by President David Starr
Jordan of Stanford University, on "In War
Time."
Tin- second lecture will be given on Friday,
January 'J4 T by State Superintendent Samuel
T. lilnck.
IN SUPPORT OF WEAVER
The Civic Federation Objects to
a Change at the Alms
house.
Vigorous Protest Made Against Politi
cal Favoritism in the Board
of Health.
The Civic Federation is again aroused
over the methods employed by the Board
of Health, and intends to make as vigor
ous a protest against political favoritism in
the appointment of cllicers in that institu
tion as it made last August when the re
moval of Superintendent Weaver and the
installment of Mr. Eteddy waa agitated.
Mr. Weaver* B removal waa thoroughly
discusseit at a meeting of the executive
committee of the federation yesterday
afternoon, and the following resolution
was adopted, which is identical to that
passed last summer with the exception of
the allusions to Mr. Reddy :
Whereas A Btrong pressure is being brought
i on the new Board ol Health to remove
Superintendent Weaver <A the >an Francisco
Almshouse in order to make place for a politl
cian; and wherean, the civic Federation, a
non-partisan Dody, organized for the purpose of
promoting v raicinK a eoo'i govern
ment In this City, believes that the removal of
a gooil public i ln< si from bo important a posi
tion for no worthier a motive than to make
place for a favored politician would not only
be asainst thi bcsl Interests of the pnolic. but
would be n:i outrage against decency and an
exhibition of callous indifference to'the mis
fortunes of tbe poor who are obliged to seek a
public >heit.T; therefore be it
ifoe<i. That tbe Civic Federation respect
fully submits to the Board of Health the fol
lowing statement:
Tbe Ban 1 rancisco Almshouse, under the
superintendence oi Mr. Weaver, is equaled
only by two other institutions of the kind in
nited States. It is the only department
of our City governmeni enjo; g bucd distinc
tion. There bave been no scandals in the man
â gemeni of this institution under Mr. Weaver.
There have been no charges of wa>te or ex
travagance. The records show that tho
â¢ > have been extremely moderate.
The present Board of Health hÂ«s been baili 1
a-, ii reform body. Governor Budd b !
nounced frequently that he would not inter
:h tlic Board of Health in the sell
of officers for the important positions In the
public service. This being the case the board
can be under no constraint to remove an effi
cient and faithful officer from a position that
all good citizens agree should be ol a non
political character.
The Almshouse is a purely San Francisco in
stitution, supported by our taxpayers, and it
is proper they should be represented in its man
agemei ;.
["he ( Ivic Federation believes that the Board
of Health should apply civil service principles
to this case. The office of superintendent of
the Almshoti^e sbould not be a prize for con
tending politicians. It has not been so here
tofore. Mr. Keating, the predecessor of Mr.
Weaver, retained his place tor twenty-seven
years, to the great benefit oi the Almshouse.
Therefore, we respectfully protest against the
removal of Mr. Weaver.

retary; K. McCiish, George T. Gaden, J.

A resolution, as follows, was passed au
thorizing the committee of public morals
to take actively in hand the matter of rid
ding the City of the pool-selling evil :
Regolved, That the committee on public
morals De authorized to call a mass-meet it. i; ol
the Civic Federation to protest again-t the
evils of pool-selling and other municipal
abuses.
The Rev. Thomas Filben acts as. chair
man of the committee.
Odd Fellows' Hall was secured for the
place of the mass-meeting, which will be
lield Monday afternoon, the liUh inst., at
3 o'clock. A special invitation has been
tendered the Rev. Dr. Carlos Martyri, the
"I'arkhurst of Chicago," to address that
meeting.
Dr. Martyn's presence at the mass
meeting will be all the more timely as he
has recently finished a war of extermina
tion on the poolrooms of Chicago. The
doctor, a year and a half ago, gave up his
church in Chicago, and since that time,
under the auspices of the National Citi
zenship League, which has its headquar
ters in Chicago, has labored against all
forms of corruption in municipal govern
ment.
lie has lectured in all the important
cities between Chicago and San Francisco.
THE WILMERDING SCHOOL
Many Reasons Why It Should
Be Established in San
Francisco.
It Was Evidently the Intention of the
Testator That This City Secure
the Prize.
Several months ago special committees
were appointed by the Mechanics' Insti
tute, Half-million Club and Merchants'
Association for the purpose of doing every
thing possible to induce the Board of
Regents to locate the Wilmerdinj; School
of Industrial Arts in San Francisco. The
committees labored well and obtained the
promise of free gifts of several desirable
sites for the school. In order to present
the case clearly to the Board of Regents
the gentlemen of the committee have pre
pared the following letter, setting forth
the reasons why the school should be
established in San Francisco. It is ad
dressed to Hon. Albert Miller, chairman
of the special committee of the Board of
Regents:
Dear Sir: RppardinÃ the selection of a suita
for the Wilmerding School of Indus
trial Arts, committee! have been appointed
from the Mechanics' Institute, the Half-million
Ciub and the Merchants' Association of Ban
Francisco. At a joint meeting of these duly
ated committees held on October 8, 1895.
at the Mechanics' Institute, a sub-committee
was appointed to nrge upon the Hoard of Ke-
Renu >>: the Dniversityof California the ad
viÃabtlity of Delecting a site for the Wilmerd-
Ing School of Industrial Arts in the fity ami
County of San Praneiaoo.
KeftOlntlons duly authenticated by this com
mittee were presented to the Honorable Board
oi Regents of the University of California at its
last meeting, and copies of the same have been
sent to each member of the- board.
In further support of the desirability of
selecting the site In the City of Ban Krancisco,
this committee now begs leave to present the
following reasons:
Firstâ A careful examination of the will of
the late J. Clute Wilmerding clearly shows that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1896.
it was his intention to make this school a
practical and Industrial institution where boys
can be taught trades, "fitting them to mp.ke'u
living with their hands." It needs no argu
ment to show that such a practical school of
industrial training should be located in the
metropolis of the State where its benefits
would be most available. The tact t lint there
now exists two mechanical schools in this City
tiuii that both of them are crowded ana unable
to accommodate the mnny applicants is also a
strong argument In favor of the addition of a
larger school in San Francisco.
Secondâ The location of the Wilmerdinp;
School in this ciiy will place it within reach
of all parts oi the State. It will also enable the
applicants from the interior to take advantage
ot the unexcelled opportunities for residing
near the school where they nre taught.
Thirdâ Many of Those who will seek admis
sion to the Wilmerding school are engaged in
dally vocations wherein they must earn suf
ficlent for their own sujpport. By having sec-
Bionsin the evening us well as the daytime it
will afford those persons unable to attend In
the daytime the opportunity of receiving the
vnlunhle instructions of this institution, and
thus tit them for the higher pursuits of life.
Fourthâ lt docs seem fitting and right that
the bequest of the late Mr. Wilmerding should
be expended In the City wherein his fortune
was amassed. He was a resident of this City,
and the fortune with which be will now en
dow this school was accumulated in this City.
Fifthâ Various sites have generously been
offered for the erection of the Wilmerding
School in Ban Francisco. Hon. Adolph Sutro,
Mayor of tins City, has authorized this com
mittee to offer to the Hoard of Repents in his
name any one of three very choice and desir
able sites located in the neighborhood of
Golden Gate Park. Other public-spirited citi
zens will undoubtedly also offer choice si.'es for
this purpose, ami there is no question as to the
certainty of securing without charge a most
desirable location for this Industrial school in
the City and County of San Francisco.
In conclusion, this committee can confidently
assure your honoraole body that the location
of the Wilmerding School in the metropolis of
California will inspire the hearty support and
patronage of all the people throughout the
State. Â«>iher good reasons might be adduced
in favor of its location here, but we thin* the
i iregoing will be. sufficient to impress on your
honorable body the advisability of locating
tuis school in San Francisco.

MRS. TUNNELL IS
FOUND AT LAST
The Chief Witness in the
Church Scandal at
Visalia.
THE OVERMAN LETTERS, j
She Virtually Admits Their ]
Authenticity, and Says They
Were Stolen.
GRAPHIC STORY OF THE CHASE.
Mrs. Davidson Subjected to a Severe
Cross-Examination on the
Witness-Stand.
Mrs. Tunnell has been found.
The chief witness in the Brown-David- !
son scandal, the woman who for two weeks '
has evaded the officers of the law and suc
cessfully ran the gantlet of press repre- |
sentatives, was yesterday located by The
Call at Yisalia.
She tells a graphic story of her flight !
from Dr. Brown's house, 1703 Geary street, i
San Francisco, at 11 :30 o'clock on Sunday
night, December 29; how she caught the i
last boat that night for Oakland; how she '
was traced to the residence of Mrs. Hayes
in the city across the bay and was again
obliged to take flight for Grangeville, â 
Kings County, where she was a guest of 1
Mrs. Hayes.
There she was again located by The
Caii. und in order to escape the reporter
she started brisht and early the next
morning to walk to Hanford. There she
took the train for Tuhire and then drove
to Yisalia, with the newspaperman still on
her trail.
Mrs. Tunnell gives as a reason for her
flight from the City her desire to escape
notoriety in connection with the church
scandal. When finally found at Yisalia,
however, she threw up her hands and
frt-ely told her story t>> The Call repre
sentative.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Davidson on a charge of extortion, pre
ferred by the Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown, was
aued before Judge Campbell ye-ter
day. The aged defendant was on the
witness-stand all the afternoon and was
to a severe cross-examination.
. - proceedings were enlivened j
â  its between opposing counsel and â¢
Judge Campbell. At one time Attorney
iie excited the ire of the court to
such an extent as to be threatened with
commitment. It all came about over the
admission <>f testimony relative to the
prisoner's char.-/
.Tudge Campbell had decided during the
early part of the discussion that unless it
could be shown llr-. Davidson had been
cocvicted of a felony it was not proper to
ask her questions on such an interesting
episode of her life. Later he reversed his
own opinion, to the great disgust of the
attorneys lor the defense.
"I cannot understand it," said Guilfoile,
"but your Honor seems to be ruling dif
ferently in the case of Brown and the
present witness. It may beâ"
'â¢Now, tee here," interrupted the Judge,
"I am endeavoring to conduct this case
according to the law and the evidence, and
I do nut want any insinuations from you
to the contrary. As it is, you are almost
in contempt of court."'
Then Attorney Goilfoile beeged his
Honor's pardon and said he would not lor
the world intimate the possibility of his
Honor's acting in any but a fair manner
to all.
Mrs. Davidson was on the witness-stand
for four hours. She gave a most remarka
ble exhibition of lapse of memory.
She recalled with perfect distinctness
the date of her birth, the fact that she was
a Bible class and Sunday-school teacher
for a long period and that she nursed the
sick and wounded during the Civil War.
But from 1878 to 1383, a period of ten
years, her mind was a perfect blank.
Under oath she swore that she could not
tell one single event which transpired dur
ing that timeâ what she did or where she
was.
It was a wonderful exhibition of forgetful
nessâclever in its way, because it pre
vented the introduction of evidence damag
ing to the witness' credibility. True, it
was ail brought out that Mr?. Davidson
had at one time been an inmate of a reform
school, but of this she swore she had not
the slightest recollection or knowledge.
Mrs. Davidson was asked to identify a
picture taken at Lynn ten years ago.
"Is that your picture? 1 ' asked Louder
back.
: it nit profess to be a judge of my
res, hence I will not say whether that
is my picture or not," came the anex
â  1 answer.
The prosecuting attorney was somewhat
ncerted at this, out resumed the at-'
tack bj asking if he knew a man by the
came of Bhaw at Lynn, Mass. She re
in the negative.
"Do you mean to tell me that you do
not know Shaw?"
"I have no recollection of the person
named."
Then ex-Judge Louderback started off on
a eew tack. He asked where she was and
Highest of all in Leavening Power. Latest U. S. Gov't Report
' /IBSeUJTEEir PUBE
â¢ < â â "â â â  - * -
what she was doing each year froin[lÃ7B to
1888.
Invariably the answer came back, "I do
not know."
The case will be continued in Judge
Campbell's court at 1 o'clock to-day.
MRS. TUNNELL FOUND.
The Chief Witness In the Brown-
Davidson Scandal Tells Her
Story.
VISALIA, Cal., Jan. o.â Under the
glare of an electric light *'i one of the
side streets of Visalia is the home of a
good Christian woman, and in her safe
keeping is Mr. Tunuell.
Tux Call representative has had a tire
some sice of it in following up the trail ol
the missing witness. Shortly after 9
o'clock this evening word was received
that Mrs. Tunnell would see The Call re
porter. After entering the house she did
not delay, but came in with outstretched
hands and remarked:
"I hope that all my friends will know
to-morrow that I am in the best of health
and in safe hands."
"Why did you run away?" was asked.
"From the reporters and also dread of a
Bubpena. 1 don't crave notoriey. I am
not afraid to tell what I know, and if I
could be secure;! from that I would cheer
fully testify. I was getting tired of it ail
and so made up my mind to escape."
"How did you carry out your inten
tions?" v
"Well, first I went to Dr. Brown's house,
but the reporters were thick and persistent;
they just dung around the house till mid
night. Then I left by tlio rear entrance
and went to my friend, Mrs. Katun, in
Oakland. They soon located me there,
and it was just as bad as at Dr. Brown's.
I left there in the evening and went to
Mrs. Hayes at Grangeville. Was there a
week and was feeling safe.
"Last Monday night some one knocked
at the door. Mrs. Hayes being busy with
her household duties, I answered the
summons and found a gentleman who
afterward proved to be a Call reporter.
He asked if this was Mrs. Have-' place. I
told him yes. He then asked me if a Mrs.
Tunnell stopped there, I told him I
would ask Mrs. Hayes. I sent her to the
door, and I again made use of the back
door and walked out into the country for
a distance of six or seven miles. I re
turned home after 9 o'clock."
"The next morning I arose before day
light and walked to Hanford to Mrs.
Grover's. She is a daughter of Mrs. Hayes.
"That evening the children drove me to
the station, and I took the train to Tulare.
I stopped at a friend's house there that
night. The next morning I took my valise
and started out afoot, intending to go to
another friend's house, where possibly I
could rest for a day or two.
"I was walking along contentedly when
â¢ buggy containing a gentleman and his
wife overtook me. They asked me to get
in and ride with them. I asked them if
Mrs. Tunnell.
[JVoin a phi,toffraph.]
they were going near my friend's house
and the answer was in the affirmative.
"Nearing there I saw a buggy with a
man in it and asked who that was. On
being told it was a Call reporter I re
quested them to % drive on. After going a
short distance I proposed to get out and
walk.
"They asked me where I intended to go,
so I said Yisalia, and on telling them the
name of an old lady friend of mine they
informed me she was a dear friend of
theirs. So here I am, free once more.
"I first met Mattie Overman in 1889 at
Spokane. It was in church, and we were
sitting in the front rows. She occupied a
seat in front of me. Bhe had a pretty little
black-haired child with her.
4 I remarked, 'What a strange combina
tion â a black-haired child and a red-haired
mother.'
"After service T met her in the Sunday
school. The regular teacher being absent,
I was called on to take charge of the class.
I was very much impressed with Miss
Overman, because her answers were so in
telligent I at once took a liking to her.
"At that time she was a dressmaker, and
while there her people moved to Tacoma.
She told me then that she received at
least two letters a week from Mrs. David
son begging her to come to San Francisco;
that she had a nice room for her and would
make it pleasant.
"Mattie could not understand why such
i a fine educated woman would want a poor
ignorant country girl with her.
"Miss Overman met Dr. Brown before I
did. In her letters from Tacoma she
wrote about her preacher, and at that
I time I had some of Dr. Brown's writings
and I admired the articles. Mattie wrote
me that she thought of going to the
World's Fair, and with that our corre
spondence ceased for a very long period.
During the Midwinter Fair time I at
tended Dr. Brown's church and introduced
myself to him, and asked him if he lately
j had heard from Miss Overman. To my
i surprise he answered:
41 'Yes, she is here in San Francisco and
visits our home every few days.'
"She called on me at my request and
lived with me for several months. She
then went to Dr. brown's.
"Yes, Miss Overman greatly admired
Dr. Brown and told me about the intellec
tual feasts they held every evening. She
was hungry for information. They were
greatly attached to each other. I don't
know of anything of their so-called hojy
love. They both conducted themselves
properly, as far as I know of."
At this point of the interview Mrs. Tun-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1896.
nel was shown the published letters from
Mattie Overman to Mrs. Tunnell.
She threw up both hands, stood look
ing at the documents a moment and in
quired in a subdued whisper where they
had been found.
"I did not know they would ever come
to light. Give them to me instantly.
They were taken surreptitiously from my
trunk at 1041 Mission street. Give them to
me instantly."
"But, madam, these are not the original
letters."
"I know, but they are copies of the let
ters I received from Miss Over ."
Suddenly she stopped and turned away.
"What did I say?" she continued. "Xo,
no, Ido not want them. They are not the
letters Mattie wrote me; you may keep
them."
"What do you mean about your trunk
being broken open?"
"Some lady must have done it, as they
were all published."
"What were published?"
"Matties letters."
"Then they were hers, were they?"
"Yes â no. Gracious, I â "
And in her agitation she knocked the
lamp off the table, plunging the room in
darkness. On lighting a match the lamp
: and chimney were found in <_'ood condition.
I She then cried out: "Oh, who has broken
into mv trunk?" and immediately left the
room in great confusion.
COURT PROCEEDINGS.
Lively Tilts Between Judge, Counsel
and Defending Witnessâ Case
Continued To-Day.
Judge Campbell kept the many hun
dreds of people who were anxious to listen
to the cross-examination of Mrs. Davidson
yesterday guessing from 1 o'clock, thÂ«;
hour set for the continuation of the hear
ing of the charge of extortion against the
defendant, until 1:40 r. m., when he called
for order in the courtroom of Judge Conlan,
instead of that of Judge Joachiinsen, as
had been announced. The uncertainty
relative to the place of holding court and
the delay in opening the proceeding that
have characterized this case were the sub
ject of much unfavorable comment. As
was stated by an interested person enough
time has been thus unnecessarily wasted
to make up a day's session of the court.
In advancing' to take the stand Mrs.
Davidson showed almost youthful spright
liness in her apparent eagerness to face the
ordeal of cross-examination that awaited
her. Her counsel opened the proceedings
by asking her, "Did you relate to the
doctor at any of the meetings you had with
him prior to the day that he gave you the
$500 the conversation or conversations you
had with Mrs. Jane Elizabeth Baddin?"
To this the witness replied, "I did."
Counsel for the prosecution objected to
her repeating this conversation, as it had
already been given, Mr. Lloyd jocularly
remarking that he objected to a repeater.
The wrangle ended when Attorney Gal
lagher had succeeded in getting the wit
ness to state tfiat what she told the doctor
relative to the Baddin conversation was
true. The cross-examination was begun
in rather an unexpected manner, being
based on a letter received from Chief In
spector W. B. Walls of Boston, Mass., in
closing copies of papers in the case of the
people of the State of Massachusetts
against Mary A. Davidson.
Thee papers purport to show that Mrs.
Davidson was convicted of a certain crime
in that State nine years ago.
Accompanying the letter was also a pho
tograph of tiie woman convicted, on the
back of which appeared the following:
January 2, 189(5.
I, Joseph E. Shaw of Lynn, county of Kssex,
commonwealth of Massacrm.se Us, hereby make
the following deposition, to wit:
1 have known Mary A. Davidson, alias Mary
P. Sturgis, lor fifteen years and more, and while
a member of the Massachusetts disinct police
arrested her in Albany, N. V., November 17,
1886. She was brought 10 this commonwealth,
tried at the Superior Court at Salem, January
term, 1887, convicted on four counts for selling
mortguged property, sentenced to thirty
months in the House of Correction, which sen
tence she served.
1 alSo declare this photograph to be a correct
likeness of her at the time of her arrest.
Joseph E. Shaw.
Suffolkâ ss. January 2, 18!)0.
Personally appeared before me Joseph E.
Shaw, who made oath that the above statement
was true to the best of his knowledge and be
lief. Isaac S. Mudem,
Justice of the Peaue.
Judge Louderback had charge of the
cross-examination.
"Did you ever reside in Albany?"
This raised an objection on the ground
that it was not proper cross-examination,
Attorney Gallagher claiming he had asked
her nothing about Albany, adding that he
had carried her from the time of her birth
to 1873 only.
The courtâ l am inclined to think where you
have gone into her life the prosecution have
the ritiht to go into her whole life.
Gallagherâ lf your Honor is uoing to try the
case according to the rules of evidence, and
you have applied them strictly against the de
fendant, you should apply them now We
have excluded twenty years from her life.
[ There is nothing in the record on these years
and the prosecution has no right to go into
that period on cross-examination, but must
confine itself, according to the decision of the
Supreme Court, in the cases of a defendant
strictly to the matters brought out on direct
examination.
The courtâ Objection sustained.
Louderbackâ Did you know a woman by the
name of Henrica Iliohon in Albany?
'â¢No, sir."
"Did you know such a woman at any time?"
"1 never knew her."
"Did not she accuse you of obtaining money
under false pretenses on a fraudulent Insur
ance policy in which you figured under the
name of Baddin?" .
The court sustained an objection on the
ground of the question not being proper in
cross-examination.
Louderbackâ Did you ever reside in Lynn,
Mass.?
In response to an objection by Attorney
Gallagher ex-Jadft6 Louderback said his
question was merely preliminary, and that
he would prefer to wait till the statement
regarding ncr conviction was brought into
court.
This aroused Attorney Gallagher's ire,
who protested angrily at the statement of
the other side regarding the conviction of
the defendant.
Louderback went on to explain that the
question was only preliminary to asking
her about a conviction of felony. He then
continued addressing witness:
"Is that your picture?" (handing her the
photograph received from Boston with the
inscription on the back).
The courtâ Objection overruled.
Witnessâ l do not profess to be a judge of mv
own picture.
"You say that under oath. Do you know
you are stating that under oath?"
"I do."
This elicited a doubting laugh from the
cross-examiner, which brought down the
wrath of Attorney Gallagher, who objected
to the opposing counsel's hilarity.
Louderback (continuing unmindful of Galla
gher)âDo you know a man by the name of
Joseph K. Shaw of Lynn, Mass?
An objection to this was overruled.
Witnessâ l do not.
"Did you ever know a man by that name?"
"I can't say, sir."
These replies evidently nonplused Mr.
"IS THIS YOUR PICTURE," ASKED ATTORNEY LOUDERBACK.
Louderback, whose face showed deep dis
gust tinged with the bitterness of defeat,
but after a short pause he returned to the
attack with renewed determination :
"!>o you know an officer of the State of Mas
sachusetts by the name of Shaw of Lynn.
count y of Essex?"
"I have no knowledge of such a man, s.ir."
"Well, did a man by the name of Shaw ever
arrest you for any offense?"
The courtâ You cannot impeach witness in <
; that way.
Gallagherâ You got her answer and you are !
, bound by it.
Louderbackâ We do not have to believe hÂ»r i
: answer.
In the course of the discussion which I
I followed Mr. Louiierback said to the lead- :
! ing attorney of the defense:
; "You don't know her (defendant) yourself.
; W hen yon know it little more of her pa.st his
; tory you may then know a little about her."
<.al!agher (resuming his argument)â These
: people have no right to get this witness to
! identify herself.
! The courtâ They ran impeach this witness
by showing she was convicted of a felony.
Louderbackâ Were you ever arrested" in the
county of Essex?
An objection to this was sustained.
"Did you ever serve a term in jail in the
county of Kssex?"
An objection was sustained.
"Did you ever go by the name of Abbott?"
"No."
"Have you ever been called or known by the i
name of Abbott?" â 
"As my surname, sir? My middle name is
Abbott. But I him- never been called Mrs. Ab
bott." |
"Since you have been married have you ever
been known as Mrs. Abbott?"
"No, sir."
"Have you ever been known as Mary P. I
Sturgis?"
"I know nothing of it, sir."
"Do you mean to say that you do not know
whether or not you have gone by that name?"
No, sir.
â¢'Were you ever called by others by that
name â Mary P. Sturpis?"
An objection was interposed.
Louderback (to the court)â She has given
most remarkable testimony when she .says she
does not know whether or not sne ever was
called by the name of Sturgis.
The court (to the witness)â Were you ever
| called by that name by people generally? Did I
you ever answer to that name?
Witnessâ No, sir.
Louderbaek â Have you any knowledge
whether you ever used the name of Sturgis for ;
yourself?
Gallagher objected and while he was
stating his ground Air. Louderback en
deavored to induce witness to answer. This j
precipitated a short, but hot tilt between j
counsel, Gallagher charging his opponent
with unfairness, and Louderback was
forced to desist.
Gallagher claimed that the line of ques
tioning was not proper cross-examination,
and that the witness could only be im
peached by contradicting her testimony on
direct examination or by showing a con
viction of felony.
Lloyd (taking up the argument)â The witness
testified to her cood character. She opened the '
question of her character herself, and Itig le
gitimate cross-examination to show her bud
character. It is our right to show she has led,
a disreputable life. That is a very important !
element. Upon any question of doiibt charac
ter must be considered. She has undertaken to â 
raise the shield of good character for her protec- !
tion. This shield the law gives her. It presumes j
her cnaeacter to be good unless otlierwi.se
shown, but she has endeavored to show us upon i
her own testimony that her character is srood.
We want to show that her shield is rotten, '
rusty and full of holes. She tried to impress !
your Honor with her patriotism in caring for |
the wounded during the war and with her
moral and Christian attributes in teaching |
Sunday-school. We will show that she is a j
fraud, a liar, and that she is a blackmailer and !
simulator. Had she kept her lips sealed we
could not break through her shield.
The courtâ l have a very high regard for your
statement as to all that, but I cannot fix it in
my mind that you are right.
There was some further argument on the
I matter and Judge Campbell finally decided â 
the prosecution" had the right to go into
the character of the defendant and for this
purpose could traverse her whole life.
In the course of his argument, Attorney
Gallagher, in response to questions from
the bend), stated that certain matters
which he had brought out and which the
court evidently thought bore on the ques
tion of character was immaterial, saving
that the other side was asleep. This raised
a laugh on all aides. Which side the
laugh was on was indicated by the prompt
rejoinder of ex- Judge Loudefback:
"We had no business or desire to object
to your troinp into her character."
Louderback, continuing the cross-exami
nation, asked:
"Did you ever sign as your name the name
of Siurgis?"
Witnessâ l have no knowledge of it.
"You have no knowledge whether or not you
have signed the name of Sturgis as your
name?"
An objection to this question was sus
tained.
"What name did you go by in Albany?"
An objection was interposed on the
ground of not being proper cross-examina
tion and that it was assuming defendant
had lived there,
Louderbackâ Did you ever live in Albany, in
the titatu of New York ?
Witnessâ l have answered that.
"You haven't answered that."
"I have no knowledge of ever having lived
in Albany."
"Don't'yoa remember attending church at
Albany?"
An objection led to considerable argu-
merit and then the witness replied in the
affirmative.
This caused great commotion through
out the courtroom, in which murmurs of
surprise were distinctly audible. Counsel
then continued :
"How often?"
"I passed through Albany about three years
ago ami attended church there on my way to
visit friends in other parts of New York."
"How many times aid you attend church in
Albany?"
"i answered you once."
"Only once in your life you went to church
in Albany?"
"Only once, three years ago. I have no
knowledge oi going any other time."
"How long did you remain in Albany at that
time?' 1
"I spent the Sabbath there three years ago.
1 was never there at any other time.''
"Where were you in 1878?"
"I can't tel! you, sir."
"Can't you tell in wuat country you were in
in 1878?"
â¢â¢1 bare no disposition to tell anything but
God's truth."
"What country were you in in 1878?"
"I don't know."
"Were you in Kngland?"
"I can't tell you. sir."
"Were you in Germany?"
"I can't tell you, sir.""
"Wore yon in Africa?"
"1 can't tell you. sir."
"Wore you In Alaska?"
"I can't tell you, sir."
'â¢Were you in the Sandwich Islands?"
At this stage the witness began to show
decided indications of annoyance, not to
say anger, and replied testily:
"You csn tHke me over the whole globe and
I couldn't tell you."
The courtâ Wore you in the flesti or in the
spii it ?
Louderbackâ Were you in tne State of New
York in I^TS ?
"i can't tell you anything about it."
"You were not out of this physical world at
thai time, were you, as the Judge in his ques
tion suggested ?"
Gallagnerâ Objection on the ground of the
question bring absurd.
Witnessâ l tell you, sir, I do not know.
"Were you in Lynn ?"'
"1 can't tell."
"Were you in Massachusetts?"
"1 can't tell."
"Were you in jail in Lvnn?"
"I know nothing of where I was in 1878."
"You don't know whether or not you were
in jail or not ?"
The courtâ Why don't you know? You are
a woman of culture and intelligence and ought
to be able to answer these questions or state
the reason why you cannot answer.
Gallagherâ We claim the witness has the
right to say she will not answer.
Louderback (in an aside) â We don't want to
gel the witness into contempt. (To witness)
You don't know, then, whether or not in 1878
you were in jail?
"No, sir."
Witness was then asked where she was
in 1879 and 188U, and answered that she
could not tell. When asked with reference
to 1881 she replied:
"I will tell you, sir. There is a blank in my
life on account of physical and menial in
nrmitk's, and 1 cannot tell you."
And to further questions as to where she
was during the years from 1882 to 1887
inclusive sne returned the answer that she
did not know. Continuing the cross-ex
amination ex-Judge Louderback asked:
"Were you not arrested in 1880 iv Albany
ami ta ken back to Massachusetts?"
Gallagherâ Objection on the ground that the
question had been asked once and that the
proteeution was bound by the answers given.
I.ouderbackâ This woman has given some |
extraordinary testimony, and the evident un
truthfulness gives the Judge a wider latitude.
We claim she is deliberately testifying falsely.
No person outside an insane asylum would be
lieve her testimony. Her memory is remark,
ably go.ju on some things â on her interviews
with Dr. Brown â yet on these matters her
mind is a perfect blank. Some people may
think she is adopting a clever dodge, but we
believe it is an audacious attempt at perjury.
Guilfoyleâ Your Honor's rulings, 1 would
like to remark here, are not the same as when
Dr. Brown was under cross-examination.
The court (indignantly) â I don't want to
listen to any more of these insinuations. lam
trying to rule fairly, and you are almost guilty
of contempt of court.
Guilfoyle (apologetically)â l submit this, if
your Honor please â
The courtâ l don't want to hear you. Objec
tion overruled.
Witnessâ l know nothing of it, sir. That time
is a blank.
To further questions as to where she was
in 1,887 and 1888, witness replied that she
did not know. To the same question
relative u> 1889 she answered :
"I think I was in Boston."
"Were you not arrested in Albany on Novem
ber 17, 1886?"
"I know nothing, sir."
"During any of these years you say you know
nothing about were you in an insane asy
lum?"
"I don't know, sir."
"You say in 1889 you were in Boston. What
time was that?".
"I can't tell you exactly, sir."
"From that time you "remember where you
were, do you?"
"I had sufficient cause to remember." (Sor
rowfully).
"Then from 1878 to the time you say you
were in Boston you say you don't know where
you were?"
â¢'lt was a blank in my life."
"Were you not for thirty months at hard
labor in a jail in the County of Essex, in Mas
sachusetts, from February 2", 1887."
"1 have no knowledge of it. '
"Were you not in court, in the County of
Essex, on "or about February 2, 1887, sentenced
for a crime?"
"I know nothing of it, sir."
"Don't you remember making a speech in
court?"
"No, sir."
"Were you ever in jail before you were in
jail on the present charge?"
"I know nothing about what you are talking
about."
"Were you ever convicted of a felony and
sentenced therefor in Essex County, Massa
chusetts?"
"I don't know. I have no knowledge of it."
"In 1883 did you know a person by the name
of Oliver Ditson?"
"I knew him."
"Where did you know him?"
"I am familiar with Boston, and have known
of him for a great many years; when I was a
chad."
"Do you know John C. Haynes?"
"I knew him."
"Charles S. Ditson?"
"No, sir."
"Never met him?"
"Never met him. I aon't know anything
about him."
"Did you ever execute a mortgage to Hayne
or Ditson in connection with some pianos?"
An objection was sustained.
"Were you carrying on a piano business in
Boston or anywhere else?"
"1 have a very indistinct recollection of hav
ing been engaged in the piano business."
'"When wns that?"
"I assisted my husband in the business, I
think, in 1874 or 1875."
â¢'Was your husband engaged in that business
in 1884?"
"1 do not know. You ran question me till
to-morrow morning and I will tell you only the
God's truth." (Deliberately and impressively.)
"Do you know Mary E. Judkins?"
"I can't tell ygu anythini;."
"What year was it you became blank?"
"I remember when we went to Maine in
1874."
"Then did you become blank in mind?"
"Then I think there was a darkening of my
memory ; there was a breach in my mental and
physical system in 1874, but I can't recall; it
is a blank."
"When did you begin to awaken again?"
"I recall being at my father's house. It
might have been in 1888 or 1889."
"When did your husband die."
An objection was interposed at this
point.
I.ouderback (continuing)â We want to know
how he terminated. Is he alive?
"I don't know."
"When did you see him last?"
"I can't tell you."
"When did you see him first?"
"I saw him first I think in 1885."
"When were you married to your second hus
band?"
"In 1873."
"Did he disappear during this blank?"
"I don't know anything about it."
"Is he living or dead?"
"I don't know."
"Ever hear jrom him? Don't you know
whether he is alive?"
"1 don't know."
"How long did you live together?"
â¢'I don't know."
"Beiore your memory failed you he was with
you, and since then you have not heard from
him ?"
The court (as if discouraged)â lt is apparent
she won't answer any questions between 1874
and 1888.
"Have you told any person since your arrest
in this City that you were in the prison or
House of Correction"in Massachusettc?"
"There was a reporter who came to me and
said it was allegedâ"
The couri â Have you told anybody that?
Witnessâ A reporter came and sÃid it was
alleged, and I said, "I have nothing to say,
sir."
Louderbaekâ Before you came to California
did you know a woman by the name of Baddin?
"I had no knowledge of any one by the name
of Baddin. I never met with the same of
Baddin before I came here."
"Did somebody accuse you of obtaining
money falsely to the name of Mrs. Baadin?"
"No, sir."
Counsel for the prosecution then led
witness throuch the story of her various
meetings with Mrs. Baddin and Dr. Brown,
without bringing to light any new develop
ments until the matter of the defendant's
means was touched upon, when the fol
lowing cross-examination ensued:
Louderbackâ Were you then and are you
now a woman of means?
"I pay my bills."
"In November the only money you had was
the money you earned by the sale of corsets.
You did not have a bankaccount?''
"I did, sir."
Witness then showed that she had cash
and slock valued in the aggregate at about
?2500, ami that up to the 10th of last De
cember she had as a partner a Mrs. Myers.
She further testified that no one was pres
ent at any of her interviews with Mrs.
Baddio, but stated thai she had told her
partner about having engaged Mrs. Baddin
as a canvasser to go into the country.
She also admitted that she never knew the
address of Mrs. Baddin. and could oniy
recollect that Mrs. Baddin nad told her
that she had kept a lodging-house on
Fourth, Fifth or Mission streets, the wit
ness could not remember which. Nor
could she recall having given the name of
Mrs. Baddin to her partner.
Counsel for the prosecution, after some
objection by the opposing side, induced
the witness to recite the story of her wander
ings from the Sunday preceding her arrest
until she became an inmate of the prison.
On Sunday, she said, she was at. the
house of a friend and at Sunday-school at
Dr. Brown's church. She stated that the
frienu's name ac whose house she was that
day was Mrs. Frank French. She re
mained there Monday and Tuesday. Be
fore she accounted for her time on Wednes
day she addressed her inquisitor in the
most impressive manner as follows:
"If my whole life had been gone into not a
man or woman would have dared to show a
mark on my life. Their attempt to do so
would simply have been something horrible.
1 am a married woman with a husband, and
any one with common-sense knows that the
physical condition of a woman varies very
much. I thine that Wednesday morning I
called at a very dear friend of mine on Ellis
street."
Louderbackâ Who was it?
"Mrs. Root, the mother of Doctor Root, some
where in the GOO block. I wished to rest and
recuperate. She could not accommodate me
and I went to a lodging-house on the opposite
side, which was recommended to me by my
friend, and took a room. I don't know the
name of the lady who kept the lodging-house.
I paid the mom rent myself. I left there Friday
to visit a friend of mine on Broadway. Her
name is Mason. She lives in the 1100 block.
On Saturday I came down to my own home on
Geary street."
Louderbaekâ You were away from home and
business from Sunday until" Saturday. Why
were you away and not attending to business?
"Because my business is not one of any im
portance at that time of the year. People
don't wish to buy those things at that time
and I wished to rest and took that time."
"Did you leave any one at your place of busi
ness?"
"Xo, sir. It was locked up during that
period."
"You slept there, too, did you not?"
"Yes, sir; sometimes."
"When you left there were you in tears 7"
"No, sir; 1 am not a crying woman."
"No, sir. No, sir (indignantly)â I am no
dodger. (Laughter in the courtroom.) I went
to Mrs. French's house on her invitation."
"You were going from place to place for the
sake of getting a rest?"
"Ana being with my friends."
Witness explained that she took the
room in a lodging-hause opposite Mrs.
Root's in order to take advantage of the
bath and other sanitary airangements
there.
Louderback (to court)â We ofier this record
of her conviction in Essex together with her
sentence.
Here a long discussion ensued as to
whether the crime of the person men
tioned in the record was a felony or
not. The court finally suggested thatthis
matter be discussed at the nexc session of
the court, as he would like to ask a few
questions himself of the witness. This
was agreed to and his Honor then took up
the cross-examination of the defendant.
The courtâ Mrs. Davidson, what church do
you belong to?
Witnessâ l joined the orthodox Congrega
tional church la Bucksport, Me., in 185t>.
Henry K. Craig was pastor.
The courtâ This church is of the same de
nomination as the church of which Dr. Brown
is pastor. Are you still a member of that
church?
"No, sir. On the recommendation of Pastor
Craig I became a member of Tremont Tempi*
in 1892, a Bapti-t church. '
"Are you &ull v, m.-mber of the Baptist
church?'
"1 ucl;eve I am."
"Did you get a letter from that church to
some otuer church iv this City when you cams
here?"
"No, sir. I never asked for it."
Witness then explained that she at
tended Dr. Brown's church and taught
fcninday-school there because it was more
convenient ior her and the surroundiaga
were more congenial.
His Honor then took up a new course by
asking:
"Why did you sign this paper (displaying
the receipt and contract given by her to Dr.
Broun) as agent for Mrs. Jane Elizabeth Bad
din?"
"Because Dr. Brown told me to do it."
"Then you wrote a thing that was npt true
because Dr. .Brown dictated it, for you claimed
that you acted as his ugont and not as hers?"
"In a certain sense I might have been her
agent."
â¢â¢What kind of a woman is Mrs. Baddin? De
scribe her."
"She had a sallow complexion, was medium
sized, and on measuring ior her corsets 1 found
her a little longer than the average woman.
She had dark gray eye. 0 , wore a dark skirt,
black sacque, black hat and a black-spotted
lace veil."
"Did she ever come back since she got the
$500?"
"No, sir."
On being asked whether Dr. Brown'i
testimony relative to wanting to see Mrs.
liaddm hiniself was true the witness re*
plied :
There is not a word of truth in it. God pro
tects womea, and he will protect me.
The hearing goes on at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon.
NO LADY VISITORS.
Rev. Dr. Law Tells How Pastors Can
Protect Themselves From
Schemers.
Rev. Marshall Law of Oakland and pasÂ«
tor of the Church of the Advent has given
public notice that he will not receive lady
visitors at his church study and will not
call on a lady aa her pastor unless by ap
pointment and when her husband or
somebody else is present. This definite
rule, notice of which lias been given from
his pulpit, has caused quite a lot of talk.
"I am very positive on this matter,"
said Dr. Law yesterday, "and after the de
velopments in the Durrant case and the
Brown trial I think I have ample justifica
tion for the stand I have taken. 1 do not
know that it should be so, but there
always seems a sort of unhealthy senti
mentality between the ladies of a church
and the pastor. It may be harmless
enough, but it lays the foundation for
scandal and should not be tolerated.
"Ever since I was ordained I have
preached against such folly, but now I see
the necessity for doing so more than ever.
I cannot see the necessity for what is
called 'parochial visiting,' There is no
need for it to-day, and I am opposed to it.
It is in most cases only an excuse to makÂ«
a regular gossiping circuit, and in many
cases results in scandal. I do not believe
that a quarter of the charges laid against
ministers by silly or designing women
have a particle of truth in them, but I
blame the ministers for laying themselves
open to the charges by such indiscretion as
paying unnecessary visits and receiving
visits from ladies at his study.
"When old Bishop Worthington or
dained me back East he said: 'Don't let
me hear of you receiving visits from any
ladies in your church study.' The idea
was right, and I have always abided by it.
"I think there Is far too keen a desire on
this coast for the pastor to visit and be
visited. On nearly every church you see
the pastor's residence address and study
hours, and I think this is wrong. Modern
society has little use for the parochial
visit or the study-caller. If a pastor is
visiting he should announce his coming
and invite several people to meet him. A
married pastor is always in danger of
schemes, and an unmarried man cannot,
in my opinion, be fitted for a pastor.
"No ladies need call on me at my study,
for I shall ask them to go to the house,
where Mrs. Law can keep us both com
pany." ______^____

NEW TO-DAY.
TOTAL ABSTINENCE IMPOSSIBLE.
But Here Is Something Just ea
Good.
In spite of all that has been said and
written by advocates of total abstinence it
is indisputable that modern methods of
â¢work and living make the occasional and
even frequent use of gentle stimulants
highly beneficial if not absolutely neces-
sary to the great majority of men es-
pecially those engaged in business and
.mental pursuits. Lack of exercise and the
excessive consumption of nerve fore* and
vital energy consumed by the brain breeds
sluggishness of the digestive system, which
reacts on the brain.
A corrective stimulant is needed.
The curse of alcoholic and vinous liquor*
is that they over-stimulate and create a
morbid appetite for more. Peruvian BitÂ«
ters, though composed largely of old Cali-
fornia Brandy, has no such effect. It
permits the healthy, stimulating effect of
the brandy, but completely obliterates its
tendency to create a morbid desire. Peru-
vian Bitters is a palatable but powerful
tonic that impels sluggish functions to
normal action ; expelling cold, fevers, ma-
larial Doisons and other disease germs;
building up the weak and convalescent,
and by promoting a regular and healthy
appetite, perfect digestion, sound sleep,
and steady nerves, tends to produce physi-
cal perfection, good cheer and increase ol
human happiness.
