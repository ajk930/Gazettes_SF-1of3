TO VOTE FOR
THE BEST MEN
Delegates to the Republican
Convention Should Be
Left Free.
SO SAYS MR. PERKINS.
The Senator States That He Is
Not a Candidate for the
Vice-Presidency.
WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN GET.
With a Deegation Unpledged the
State Will Secure a Cabinet
Officer.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â The
Washington Post has been casting the
Presidential horoscope, with Senator Per
kir.s in the sky as a star of the first magni
tude for Vice-President. It believes that
Ti.e treatment by the convention of Per
kins will nave considerable to do with
which way are swung the forty-one votes
of the Pacific Coast States and near-lying
Territories, and of Utah.
The fact that the Pacific Coast would be
50 flattered by recognition on the National
ticket is being taken into account by those
who hope to stem the McKiniey current,
paid to be strong there, says the Post.
The opponents of McKiniey, when they
pay that they hope to defeat him at the
convention, but do not yet know how they
will accomplish that, are holding the Pa
cific Coast card up their sleeve. There is
no question of Perkins' availability as a
man, nor that his candidacy would receive
wide support among his party. But the
McKiniey men will probably not look fa
vorably upon him unless circumstauces
compel them to. They will wish rather
for a man irom the Atlantic coast. This
will be used to advantage by the friends
of Reed and of Morton at the convention.
Continuing, the Post says:
The managers for Reed and for Morton un
derstand the situation. They also see that
considerable prejudice will have to be over
come in order to swing the far West in favor of
their candidates. Morton is regarded as an
avowed enemy of silver, and the bimetallic
sentiment is in %. mood to kick over the traces
Dnlan properly soothed. Platt would be in
(lined to do this soothing by attaching to
the tict-n a. man like Perkins, which would
p"iepÂ«e the Pacirlc Coast hugely, and all
out of proportion to the real benefits that
would aocrne t<> them. Perkins could be
attached to the ticket without much oppo
f-:t:'.:i from the gold men, as, though he
is a silver man, he Is not a fanatic, and re
fuses to identify himself with any of Stewart's
raids in the Senate. He has fought out alibis
victories on the broad open territory in day
light, and is a man who moves with modera
tion, but keeps moving. He would not be a
party tt> any conspiracy to embarrass the coun
try's revenue for sake of silver.
Senator Perkins will doubtless go to St. Louis
-with a strong baikine irom the Pacific Coast.
He is not taking an extraordinary interest in
the matter, however, though he understands
his own value in helping out on a ticket
headed by Reed or Morton, or any other man
from east of the Missouri.
Senator Perkins' attention was called to
this publication as well as to the fact that
a great many papers, not only in the West,
but all through the East, have spoken
quite as kindly of him with regard to the
second place on the ticket.
'I am, of course, very highly gratified
at the compliment of the unsolicited
movement." *aid the Sen; tor, in reply,
"and particularly at the manner in which
the public has manifested its confidence in
me and the kind words which have been
written and spoken by my friends and ac
quaintances. All this has given me the
preaten pleasure and will be remembered
long after the movement has been forgot
ten."
Continuing, he said:
"There seems to be still a belief in some
quarters that I am a candidate for the
nomination, but I am not. Ido not as
pire to the office. While I am in public
life- my desire will be to secure as many
benefits for California, as well as for the
entire country, as are possible, and for this
I deem that my present position will en
able me to be of greater usefulness than
any other I could occupy."
"Have you any notion as to the geo
graphical location of the Vice-Presidential
candidate?" was asked.
"I do not think that the Republican
National Convention will select a candi
date for the Vice- Presidency from any
Htate West of the Missouri River," said
Senator Perkins." The great Northwest
and the East will, in my opinion, be the
two fields from which the two men to
head the ticket will be taken. With an
honest, able, experienced and strong man
from one of the States between the Ohio
and the Missouri for a Presidential candi
date and the second name on the ticket
taken from New York or New England, I
am of the opinion that the Republican
patty will sweep the country from ocean
to ocean in November."
"But is California to be left out of tne
marhinery of the National Government, as
usual?"
"In the convention which is to meet at
Bt. Louis in June California can, if it
chooses, make her influence felt as she
never has before on such ap occasion. It
is in a position to secure that which it has
long desin-<l and which is her dve â a
Cabinet officer."
"Are you in favor of the delegation to
the convention being instructed?"
"To become a power In the convention,
however, the California delegation must be
unpledged and act as a unit. The dele
pates should be left absolutely free to vote
for the best men brought forward, and in
Voting they should be actuated solely by
the idea of the greatest good oi the entire
country. Tee great issues which are in
volved render it incumbent upon conven
tions to send as delegates men of the high
est character, ability and patriotism, and
California should send to St. Louis some of
lier best citizens, who are not to be in
fluenced by political considerations on
account of holding ollice under the Govern
The San Francisco Call
merit or any position in the gift of the
people. It seems to me that it will
strengthen the position of California in
the convention if men already honored by
the people will consent to the election of
delegates who will not be influenced by
such ties as political positions impose.
With a delegation so constituted, work
ing always together and animated by un
selfish patriotism, California will, I think,
be able to dictate the selection of a Cabinet
officer, and this applies to the Democratic
as well as to the Republican party."
"Have you any man in mind as to the
Cabinet appointment?"
"I believe California should be repre
sented in the Cabinet. The State would
be honored as well as b3netited by sending
there such a Republican as Colonel John P.
Jackson, Colonel Charles F. Crocker or
John D. Spreckels, or such a Democrat as
J. J. Valentine, Governor Budd or James D.
Phelan. These are men of high character
and eminent executive ability, and either
of them would make a Cabinet officer of
whom the State would have reason to be
proud. It is, I believe, within the power
of California to secure representation in
the Cabinet, but only, I am confident,
through such means as have been pointed
out. Each of the great parties must have
unity of purpose and must be actuated by
an earnest desire to act for the welfare
of the State and of the entire country."

He replied by quoting some poetry.
"In 1540," said he,"! took part in the
Presidential campaign. Martin Van

one that they sang at the close of that

CONFESSION OF HOLMES
He Admits Himself to Be the
Author of Twenty-Seven
Murders.
Says That He Was Under the Spell
of the Damned, and Is
Lost.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 10.â A
local paper will print to-morrow what pur
ports to be sentences from the concession
alleced to have been made by Murdeier
H. H. Holmes.
In prefacing the confession, which cov
ers in full nearly three new&paper pages,
written in Holmes' own writing, detailing
with a minuteness that is simply at times
revolting, the arch mntilator and author
of twenty-seven murders, as he admits
himself to be. states, with something hse
pathos, that he does so simply that he
may obtain enough money to educate
his boy.
Regret is never for a moment expressed,
and he comes out boldiy and without
compunction on his very opening with the
statement, "I was born with the very
devil in me.' 1
He believes he is fully under the spell
of the damned, and, despite the assertions
to the contrary that he is receiving the at
tentions of a minister of God and is grad
ually becoming imbued with, the spirit of
forgiveness and religion, he feels he is lost
hopelessly.
"I couldn't help the fact that I was a
murderer any more than the poet can help
the inspiration to song, nor the ambition
of an intellectual man to be great," he
continues. "I was born with the evil one
standing as my sponsor beside the bed
where I was ushered into the world and he
has been with me since.
"The inclination to murder came to me
as naturally as the inspiration to do right
comes to the majority of persons. Where
others' hearts were touched with pity mine
were tilled with cruelty, and where
in others the feeling was to save
life I reveted in the thought of
destroying it. Not only that, I was not
satisfies in taking it in the ordinary way.
I sought devices strange, fantastical and
even grotesque. It gave me joy to work
my murderous will,; and I reveled in it
with the enthusiasm of an alchemist who
is hot on the trail of the philosopher's
stone."

VON KOTZE'S
LATEST VICTIM
Wounds Baron v. Schrader
in a Duel With
Pistols.
THIRD IN THE SERIES
Principals Stand Ten Paces
Apart and Fire Until One
Is Disabled.
AN OLD SCANDAL IS REVIVED
Sensational Encounters Grow Out of
Accusations Against the Ex-Court
Chamberlain.
BERLIN, Germany, April laâ A duel
with pistols was fought this morning near
Potsdam between Lieberechtvon Kotze,ex
court chamberlain, and Baron yon Schra
der, master ol ceremonies ot the Prussian
court, in which the latter was severely
wounded in the right breast. The con
ditions of the duel were that the princi
pals should stand ten paces apart and
shoot until one was disabled.
Yon Schroder was taken to a hospital,
and Dr. Bergmann was summoned to his
bedside.
It was found that he had been shot in
the abdomen, and it is feared that his
wound is iatal.
The combat grew out of the old scandal
connected with the writing of a series of
anonymous letters affecting the character
of a number of court personages which
Yon Kotze was suspected of having writ
ten. He was subsequently exonerated,
however, and has since been involved in
several encounters with persons who had
accused him or intimated their suspicions
of his euilt.
Last April Count yon Kotze issued
challenges for twelve duels, and the latest
encounter is the tÃird in the series. To
day he reiterated his determination to
continue the battle against his enemies
until he had paid off every score against
them.
About a year ago Berlin society was
tnrown into a great flutter by the scatter
ing about the city of a cloud of anony
mous letters, descending upon high and
low alike, upon the just and unjust. It
has been asserted that not even the inu
perial family was spared the receipt of
these missives, and it is known that the
gravest charges, were contained in them
against members of the Emperor's house
hold. So, also, were grave charges made
against every person of prominence in the
court circle, and against a great many per
sons who were not prominent.
The facts of the scandal were kept from
the newspapers for a long time, though so
ciety talked of nothing else, and at last
the story got into print. In the meantime
the best detectives in Germany had been
put on the case, and soon rumor whis
pered that the Court Chamberlain, Yon
Kotze, was under grave suspicion. The
chamberlain had many enemies. By
reason of his position that was unavoid
able. These enemies caught up the story
of his guilt, telling it in a manner which
left no doubt of the fact, and what they
said seemed to have been borne out by the
arrest of Yon Kotze on a charge of hav
ing written the letters and his consequent
degradation from office.
Count Yon Kotze was tried for the of
fense and acquitted. He had denied his
guilt vehemently all along, and after he
was. set free by the courts he swore he
would be avenged on his enemies.

The Late Colonel John A. Cockerill, Who Died Suddenly at Cairo Yesterday.
DEATH CLAIMS
A NOTED WRITER
Colonel John A. Cockerill
Expires Suddenly
at Cairo.
ACTIVE TO THE LAST.
Was One of the Best Known
and Most Successful of
Newspaper Men.
DECORATED BT THE MIKADO.
As an Editor and Correspondent He
Had Few Equals in the
United States.
CAIRO. Egypt, April 10.â Colonel John
A. Cockerill, the well-known American
newspaper editor and correspondent, died
suddenly at Shepherd's Hotel to-day.
Death was caused by apoplexy. Colonel
Cockerill recently arrived here from Japan,
where he had spent some time as the cor
respondent of the New York Herald. He
was representing the same paper in Cairo.
John A. Cockerill was one of the most
successful and widely known newspaper
men in the United States. He entered the
profession when a mere boy, and, except
for the period when a drummer at the
front in the Civil War, he continued in it,
rising even higher to positions of greater
authority and wider usefulness.
Colonel Cockerill has been at different
times editor of the Washington Post, the
Baltimore Gazette, the St. Louis Post-Dis
patch, the New York World and Commer
cial Advertiser.
In February, 18S9, he went to Japan as
correspondent of the New York Herald,
and his work there attracted world-wide
attention. Colonel Cockerill left Japan
only a few weeks ago, after the Mikado
had bestowed upon him one of the most
coveted decorations, that of the Sacred
Treasure. He was resting in Cairo for a
while studying the Anglo-Egyptian cam
paign before leaving for home, when he
was suddenly stricken.
ST. 10TJIS, Mo., April 10.â Colonel John
A. Gockerill, whose sudden death is an
nounced from Cairo, was for a number of
years managing editor of the Evening
Post- Dispatch of this city. His vigorous
attacka upon Colonel J. O. Broadhead and
Alonzo W. Slayback, prominent politicians
of National fame, led to a personal en
counter in the office of the Post>Dispatch
on October 13, 1882, between Cockerill and
Slayback. The latter was shot and killed.
Cockerill was exonerated upon prelimin
ary examination. This shadow ultimately
forced him to leave St. Louis for New
York.

TO FORCE THE FIGHTING
An Unsuccessful Assault Upon
the Garrison at Guira de
Melena.
ARE YET BURNING PROPERTY.
Numerous Engagements to Be Fol
lowed by a Battle- That Wi.l
Decide the War.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 10.â Insurgents
attacked tbe town of Guira de Melena,
province of Havana, in considerable num
bers last night. They attempted to de
ceive the garrison with cries of "Viva
Espana" and bugle calls employed by the
Spanish troops. The ruse did not work,
however, and the rebels were repulsed
with some losses. The insurgents burned
the Victoria estate near the town. They
are believed to belong to the party ot
Nunez.
The Alcalde of Guira reports the rebeli
moving west toward Alquisara.
Another party of rebels burned the
town of San Matias, situated near the
coast of Havana.
There are said to be 3000 rebels in
the vicinity of San Miguel, between Ha
vana and Matanzas. The leader of this
force is not known.
Guayabel, near the western line of the
province of Havana, has been burned by
tne insurgents.
The official report of the fight on the
Fermina ranch, near Jovellanos, Btates
that the rebels lost eight killed. The
troops lost sevsn wounded. The Spaniards
pursued the rebels and in skirmishes
killed eighteen, without loss to themselves.
Thirty-four volunteers, while foraging
near Camajuani, were attacked by 140
rebels, who used machetes. A lieutenant
and four volunteers were killed and a lieu
tenant was wounded.
A band of rebels commanded by "Ingle
sito" and others entered the town of
Bermija, province of Matanzas, ana de
spite the heroic resistance of the troops in
the forts secured some stores and burned
some houses. The rebels numbered 600,
and were well armed and well mounted.
Large numbers of rebels are coming west.
The column commanded by General
Oliver attacked a rebel camp near Rerae
dios on Sunday last. The enemy was am
bushed fifty meters from the camp. The
rebels threw dynamite bombs and fired
explosive shells. The Spaniards lost a
captain and four soldiers killed and
one lieutenant and twenty-five soldiers
wounded.
According to reports received here there
have been a number of engagements be
tween the insurgents and Spanish forces
at different parts of the Spanish trocha,
and a decisive encounter between the
rebels under Maceo and Spanish troops is
expected to occur very soon. Twenty-five
thousand troops are stationed along the
line between Maria 1 and Majana and are
kept under arms night and day.
The troops forming the garrison atGuan
ajay expected that an attack would be
made by the rebels last night, and in an
ticipation of such an event the stores in
the place were all closed and the troops re
mained on duty all night.
Colonel Hernandez reports a battle be
tween his command and parties of rebels
under Masso and Acea in the vicinity of
Las Canas. The insurgents lost four killed.
The Spanish gunboat Alerta and the fort
at Cabanas, on the north coast of the
province of Pinar del Rio, have had a bat
tle with the enemy's forces.
JUAXT AMERICANS SZA.IX.
Story of a Portland Man Who Wat
Driven From Havana.
PORTLAND, Or., April 10.â William M.
Posser, who for a lone time was a well
known salesman with Murphy, Grant &
Co., before that firm went out of business
here, returned to this city Wednesday
morning, after an absence of a number of
years. For tbe past three years he has
been a resident of Havana, Cuba, engaged
in the commission business, but last Feb
ruary he was compelled to flee from the
country.
"Press cablegrams to this country as to
the state of affairs in the Island of Cuba
are fearfully garbled in the interests of the
Spaniards," said Posser to-day, "because
the censor eliminates any objectionable
matter from them, be they private or de
sisned for the newspapers. This auto
cratic functionary has also interdicted the
transmission of all cipher cables, so as to
be able to supervise all the intelligence
going abroad from that source. The sanc
tity of the mails bas been violated by the
Spanish Government in the island, to the
extent that its postal spies have absolute
authority to intercept and open any and
all letters supposed to be conveying abroad
con traband information, or in other words
giving publicity to the outside world of
the atrocities and injustices practiced by
the Havana Government. I am person
| ally acquainted with the Cuban cor
respondents of three of the most influen
tial papers in this country, and they dare
not picture the situation in its natural
colors for fear of imprisonment, which is
almost tantamount to siow and cruel As
sassination.
"Since the Cuban resolutions in Congress
have tired the Spanish' heart with resent
ment the lives of nearly all Americans on
the island, and especially in Havana, have
been rendered insecure and extremely un
pleasant. 1 hese facts have been very
lightly touched upon by the newspaper
corespondents; but, as I intend never to
return to Cuba, T am perfectly safe in dis
cussing some things I personally know,
and which have never been printed in the
American newspapers,
i "Havana, aa well as some of the other2
large places on the island, has for years
swarmed with impecunious Americans,
employed in one way or another, but not
occupying any conspicuous positions. The
.city has for years been a place of refuge for
a number of Americans who found it ex
pedient to depart froru the United States
between two daya and bury themselves in
oblivion in the Cuban capital, never com
municating with their friends across the
water. Since the Congressional Cuban
resolutions have incensed Captain-General
Wey'.er and his co-patriots at least fifty of
those obscure Americans, whom I was
wont to meet on the streets, have van
ished.
"I personally interested myself in sev
eral of these cases and I not only received
no satisfaction, but a prominein official
etrongly hinted to me that my individual
peace might be subserved were I to abstain
from meddling with subjects not directly
concerning me. Self-preservation being
the paramount law of nature, I profited
by the suggestion. lam certain, though,
that countless Americans have in the past
four months fallen victims to the treach
erous hatred of the Spaniards, either by
cowardly assassination, or, what is worse,
by imprisonment in vermin-infested and
miasmatic dungeons.
"It was a week after I had made in
quiries regarding the missing Americans,
who disappeared from the streets of
Havana as if they had vanished in the
air, that I was arrested by two officers
wearing Spanish uniforms. They escorted
me to the cilice of one of Captain-General
Weyler's aides, who informed me that I
was suspected of being in sympathy with
the insurgents, suggesting. the advisability
of settling up business affairs with the ut
most dispatch and departing from the
island. Knowing what I did, I considered
myself in good luck in getting off so
easily, and ten days later I was in New
York. I left my interests in the hands of
a friend, not stopping to dispose of them.
The warning I had was sufficient for me
to make myself scarce as rapidly as possi
ble."
CLEVEZASD WILL, TAKE TIME,
Jn So Hurry to Act on the Cuban Reso
lutions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â The
Cabinet meeting to-day lasted barely an
hour and a half and was apparently de
void of any exciting features. No pro
gramme of action on Cuban affairs was
submitted by the President nor were any
of the other plans outlined in sensational
dispatches brought forward. Every indi
cation point? to the President taking his
own-time and acting in his own way, if he
acts at all, on the concurrent Cuban reso
lutions of Congress. Much emphasis is
laid by those supposed to bo close to the
President upon this passage in his annual
message :
"Whatever may be tne traditional sym
pathy of our countrymen as individuals
with a people who seem to be struggling for
larger autonomy and greater freedom,
deepened as such sympatny natually must
be in behalf of our neighbors, yet the
plain duty of their Government is to ob-
Berve in good faith the recognized obliga
tions of international relationship."
O>Â£ AMEKICAS SHOT.
Benvjf Bridge* Executed by the Spanish
Nt Morro Cattle.
BOSTON. Mass.. April 10.â A local paper
prints the details of the capture in Cuba of
two American seamen and the
shooting of one of tnem, Henry Bridges,
in Morro Castle. The story comes from
Mate Edwin Burke of the schooner Dillo
way, now at this port, who says tnat
Bridges and himself shipped at Galveston
on the steamer Elsa Pickens, whose des
tination was unannounced. The steamer
sailed, taking a southerly course, and on
February 24 landed on the west coast of
Cuba. The cargo, consisting of 1800 rifles,
150,000 rounds of ammunition, four breech
loading field pieces, one Gatling-gun, hos
pital stores and medicines, were safely
taken ashore and packed upon the backs
of mules and started inland.
"On February 20 we left Cadena for the
interior, anJ a few hours afterward were
arrested and taken to Morro Castle and
condemned to be shot. I begged a guard
to take a noie to the United States Con
eul for me, but he refused. On the follow
ing day the guard disappeared, and two
days later I was summoned to the prison
commandants office, where I found await
ing me several American gentlemen, among
them a Mr. Wilde, who said he repre
sented Consul-General Williams. A state
ment of ray position, also a declaration
that I was an American citizen, was made
out. I informed Mr. Wilde regarding
Bridges, and he pronmea to attend to his
case at once. I was sent back to prison
and remained there several days, during
which time over forty prisoners were exe
cuted to my knowledge.
"Finally, on March 24, I was released
and sent directly to the Consul's office to
be forwarded to the United States. Bridges
was shot the day before tue Consul-General
received my communication. He, with
several others, were marched out to the
slaugnter wall and shot down like dogs
with their backs to the assassins. I was
allowed no time in which to learn the
particulars of his death."

FORTY THOUSAND PROMISED.
The Contest for Sergeant-at-Arms
Narrowed Down to Cooper and
Erockihire.
CHICAGO, lul, April 10.â For several
hours this afternoon and evening the sub
committee of the National Democratic
Committee which has charge of the ar
rangements for the National Convention
oh July 7 was in session at the Palmer
House. Those present were: Chairman
W. F. Harrity, Philadelphia; J. G. Pra
ther, Missouri; Thomas H. Sherley, Ken
tucky; Secretary 8. Sherin, Indiana, and
Judge Adam Goodrich, who held a proxy
for Congressman Ben Cable. Mr. Harrity
also held a proxy for E. C. Wall of Wis
consin.
The entire proceedings we,re conducted
in executive session. A delegation from
the iocal committee was first received and
assured the National committeemen that
of the fund of $40,000 that had been guar-
anteed when the convention was voted to
Chicago more than one-half had been
raised and that the balance would be
forthcoming whenever it was required.
This report was regarded as eminently
satisfactory.
The statement was made unofficially that
a check for $20,000, or one-half of the
guarantee, would be presented to Chair
man Harrity to-morrow. President John
j T. Dickinson, who was present with other
' officers of his company, submitted data
from tbe contractors showing tnat the
; Colliseum would be ready for occupancy
six weeks in advance of the date set for
i the convention. Plans of the proposed
interior arrangements for the convention
! were submitted, and it was agreed they
! should be carefully examined to-morrow.
Nothing was said or done to-day con
cerning the selection of a sergeant-at
arras. but it is probable that this question
will be disposed of to-morrow evening. At
the last meeting Ciiairman Harrity was
i taken to understand that if Pennsylvania
wanted the appointment it could have ft,
, and he had about settled upon John H.
! Curley, formerly of the Philadelphia Rec-
I ord. Mr. Curley, however, cannot spare
j the time, and Mr. Harrity has no other
I candidate. This apparently narrows the
contest to John S. Cooper of this city and
ex-Congressman Brookshire of Crawfords
ville, Ind. After the selection of a ser
geunt-at-arms, a local committee will take
up the matter of press accommodations.

SLOWLY STRANGLED TO DEATH.
Terrible Fate of a Little Girl at Hobcken
While Feeding Pigeons on
a Roof.
NEW YORK, N. V., April lO.^Augusta
Karish, 11 years old, a daughter of Karl
Karish of Hoboxen, met death yesterday
in a simple yet horrible manner. She
hanged herself accidentally, and then
slowly strangled to death. The family
live on Penhorn avenue. Augusta was the
oldest child. She had a cote of trained
pigeons, which she kept on the roof and
fed daily.
Yesterday Mrs. Karish went to New
York, leaving Augnsta to take care of the
other children. After her mother had
gone the little one climbed the ladder to
the roof, where she performed her daily
task. In returning, she was holding the
trapdoor which leads from the roof with
one hand, and had the othVr on the rung
of the ladder. The door was heavy and
began to slip as she was about to take the
next step. She missed her footing, letting
go her hold on the trapdoor at the same
insta-nt. The door fell on her neck. With
her head projecting from the roof, her
body dangling over the ladder, the little
one 'slowly died.
She had been dead several hours when
her mother returned, and, searching for
her, was horrified to see her fastened in
the unique deathtrap.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Ayril 10.â Tne
Merchants' iiar Association of the United
States is no more. Alter a stormy session
to-night tbe members unanimously agreed
that it would be impossible for them to
come to an agreement. The death of the
association was due to the fact that it
could not control the output, and many of
its members refused to be bound by its
action in the effort to raise prices because
of fear of outside competition. A new as
sociation may be formed to-morrow.
DEBATES ON THE
INDIAN SCHOOLS
Senators Not in Favor of
Making the Changes
Proposed.
ACTION IS POSTPONED.
Call Introduces a Joint Resolu
tion Relating to the May
brick Case.
AS TO CONTEMPT OF COUET.
Debs May Yet Secure Legislation to
Restrain United States
Tribunals.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â The
main portion of the session of the Senate
to-day was taken np by the Indian appro
priation bill, the House proposition abol
ishing the system of contract schools for
Indian children giving rise to a long and
rather interesting discussion. There was
almost a unanimity of sentiment against a
sudden change of system from contract
schools to Government schools, and there
was an almost equal unanimity for such a
gradual change as would not do injustice
either to the religious societies which had
established the schools or to the Indian
children who attended them. The* matter
went over, however, without action.
Later in the day a joint resolution relat
ing to the imprisonment of Mrs. May brick
in England, was introduced by Call of
Florida, to the apparent annoyance ot
Sherman of Ohio, chairman of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, who declared
that such a proposition should not have
been introduced, as the Senate had no
juiisdictiou over the subject. He moved
to lay the joint resolution on the table,
but finally consented to have it referred
to the Judiciary Committee, which dis
position was made of it.
Call inquired of the Judiciary Committee
whether that committee had made any
progress in the consideration of the matter
heretofore referred to as to the legislation
necessary to restrain United States courts
in cases of contempt. He made inquiry,
he said, at the request of Eugene V. Debs,
one of the leaders of the labor movement
in the United States. \
Hoar, chairman of the Judiciary Com
mittee, stated that the matter had been
referred to Senator HiJl as a substitute
committee and he bad undertaken to
make a careful collection of the laws on
the subject and prepare a measure in com
mittee. A carefully prepared bill on the
subject had been introduced yesterday by
another member of the committee. The
committee was hurrying with it as rapidly
as the nature of the case admitted. How
soon the matter would be ripe for a report
by the committee was a question which
ought to be addressed to the Senator froni
New York, who was not then present.
A bill giving the aid of the Government
to the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition at Omaha in 1898 was passed,
and the Senate at 5:20 o'clock adjourned

Considerable Opposition to the "Filled
.'â :{' c/M**Â».mii. ;=-. - â¢ : ..;.-â ,
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.âGen
eral debate was concluded to-day upon the
"filled-cheese" bill, which was begun yes*
terday afternoon. The chief advocates of
the measure were Grc-svenor (R.) of Ohio,
Tawney (R.) of Minnesota and Dolliver
(R.) of lowa. It was opposed by McMil
lan (D.) of Tennessee. Otey (D.) of Vir
ginia, Evans (R.) of Kentucky, Linney (R. )
of North Carolina and others.
The bill will be further considered to
morrow under the live-minute rule for
amendment. The objection of several of
those who spoke to-day was not to the
principle of the bill but to the extent of
taxation sought to be imposed.
Efforts will be made to reduce the rate
of tax and the schedule of licenses, and if
this be accomplished the opposition to the
bill will be comparatively feeble.
The appropriation bill for fortifications
and coast defenses for the year ending
June 80, 1897, was reported by Hainer (R.)
of Nebraska, and placed on the calendar.
Among the bills pasued by the House
was a bill appropriating $1290 to repay
J. J. Lints for money withheld from his
salary as custodian of public property at
Erie. Pa., in 1872, for loss of property for
which he was not responsible.
At 5 o'clock the House took a recess
under the rules till 8 o'clock, the evening
session to be for the consideration of pri
vate pension bills.
The evening session of the House was
marked by a slight outbreak in the Repub
lican ranks against the policy of increas
ing the pensions of widows of general offi
cers. Several such bills had bsen acted on
by the House in committee of the whole
and when the last one came up McCall
(R.) of Tennessee said that if that policy
was to be continued, while widows of
private soldiers could get no such consid
eration, he, for one, did not propose to at
tend anymore Friday-night sessions.
Pickler (R.) of South Dakota, replying
to McCall's remarks, said the maximum
limit of the pension of the widow of a pri
vate soldier had beien increased from $8 to
$30 a month, but there had been no in
crease of the limit of officers' widows' pen
sions.
A lively colloquy occurred between Pick
ler and H cmen way (R.) of Indiana, the
latter of whom questioned the statement
of the former regarding the committee's
action on bills. Pickler declined to be in
terrogated by Hemenway, and the latter
cried, "Yon don't dare to permit a ques
tion," to which Pickler replied that the
gentleman did not want any information;
that he had misrepresented the committee
in what he said.
During the evening nine bills were acted
upon in committee of the whole and three
of them were passed in the House before
the hour of 10 :30 caused an adjournment
until to-morrow.

lHt*r*Hina Statistics Gathered by the
Aaricultural Department.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.â The
United States Department of Agriculture
to-day issued a report of the condition of
winter grain and the health of livestock
April 1, 1896, which says that consolidated
reports from townships, county and State
correspondents, show the condition of win
ter wheat is as follows: Ohio 56, Michigan
82, Indiana 77, Kentucky 70, Illinois 81,
Missouri 75, Kansas 88, California 91; aver
age for the entire country, 771 ; last year,
81.4.
Dry weather at seeding time, from which
scarcely a county was exempt, largely re
tarded or prevented germination, and the
winter covering of snow wss exceptionally
scanty. Rye suffered in most States less
than wheat. In Nebraska, Kansas and
westward there was less winter killing
than usual, owing to.-.the mild season, and
present conditions are reported favorable.
Condition of horses 97.6, of cattle 98, of
sheep 98.5, of swine 93.3, whicn is an im
provement in every case over last year.
The mortality of cattle and sheep was low.
explained by the mild winter. The loss of
swine was heaviest in the important Mis
sissippi River States, Illinois, lowa and
Missouri, all reporting 20 per cent or over.

as to prevent the officers in question from

WASHINGTON, D. ft, April 10.â Ten
of the members of the House Committee
on Pacific Railways met this afternoon
and considered for two hours the bill to
settle the indebtedness of the Central and
Union Pacific railways to the Government,
which was prepared by a joint sub-com
mittee of the House and Senate a few days
ago, the principal provisions of which
have been already made public.
Tne bill, which is a long one, was read

mittee.
The purpose of the members, except
those who formulated the measure, was to

meeting will be held on Monday.
One of the members of the committee
said to The Call correspondent that al
though the details of the bill may be
changed in some particulars its general
features will remain as now. ThÂ« bill will
be reported to the House on Monday. It
is believed that Huh bard of Missouri will

subsidy there were two companies that
wanted the contracts. His company was
willing to meet any terms the Scrymser-

sum, but would not undertake to build with
out a subsidy. It would build the cable to

FEARFUL CRIMES
OF AN ATTORNEY.
Started In by Shooting the
President of a Lumber
Company.
THE VICTIM A CLIENT
Going to His Home the Assassin
Killed His Wife and Three
Children.
AND THEN COMMITTED SUICIDE
It Was a Most Peculiar Tragedy and
the Motive Has Not Yet
Developed.
PENTWATER, Mich., April 10.-S. B.
Minshall, an attorney of this town, made
a probably successful attempt last night to
assassinate William B. O. Sands, president
of the Sands & Maxwell Lumber Company.
After leavirg Sands for dead Minshall
went to his home and shot his wife and
three children dead, and then committed
suicide by shooting himself through the
head.
Sands had been working in the office of
the company and started home about 9 :30
o'clock. When within a few rods of his
home a man jumped out from behind a
tree and fired at him. Sands broke into a
run, the would-be assassin following him
closely and firing at his victim every few
seconds. Five shots in all were fired, two
striking Sands in the arm and one in the
leg. As Sands reached his door he fell
and his assailant, probably thinking be
had killed him, turned and fled. Sands'
cries for help aroused members of his
household and a physician was summoned
and the police notified.
Sands' right arm was so badly shattered
that it was found necessary to amputate
it, and he was in a critical condition from
the shock. There was no known motive
for the attempt on Mr. Sands' life, as i.e.
wae not known to have an enemy.
Tho police were unable to unearth a clew,
and about 4:30 o'clock it was decided to
anlist the services of S. B. Minshall, Mr.
Sands' attorney. A messenger was sent to
his house. Failing to arouse any of the
family, he became suspicious that some
thing was wrong and forced an entrance.
Entering a bedroom the messenger found
the bodies of Minsball, his wife and three
children. All five had been shot, and had
been dead for some hours. It is supposed
that Minshall after having killed Sands,
as he supposed, went to his house, shot his
wife and three children and committed
suicide.
The motive for the tragedy has not yet
developed.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 10.â Mr.
Sands died at 7 o'clock this evening from
the wound inflicted by Minshall.
The Texas and Pacific.
DALLAS, Tei., April 10.â The annual

Judge Watkins in Contempt.
PARIS, Tex., April 10.â Judge Bryant
of the Federal Court this morning ordered
that Judge J. J. Watkins of the Second

Judge was drunk and reiused to testify in
a case on trial before the Federal Judge

SORE SPOTS.
If your body is partially covered with
sores which itch badly, or which run con-
tinually, or are hard to heal; or if your
hair is beginning to fall out; if your teeth
are loose or are loosening, you may be as-
sured that your blood is in a very impure
state. These symptoms frequently follow
the contraction of diseases of a private na-
ture, and they may be due too to a parent
or nurse who had some affliction. ' HUD- ;

promptly and permanently. It is a purely
vegetable compound, but strong and cer-
tain in its action. It was discovered by

Athens.

Race Over a Very Historic
Road.
ENTHUSED BY THE VICTORY.
One Member of the Royal Family
Shakes Hands With a Humble
Peasant.
ATHENS, Greece, April 10. â The
weather changed last night and this morn
ing tiie sun rose in a cloudless sky. The
atmosphere was balmy and springlike and
every condition was favorable for the car
rying out of the tifth day's programme of
the Olympic games, which included the
iinal heat? of the unfinished events of Mon
day and Tuesday.
The American competitors sustained
their reputations as athletes and carried off
a goodly thare of the honors. An im
mense crowd was present. The long dis
tance race from Marathon, over tde his
toric road followed by the messenger cen
turies ago bearing the news of the defeat of
the Persians, was won by Louis, a Greek
peasant, and his victory was greeted with
thunders of applause.
This victory has done much to soothe
the disappointment felt by the Greeks at
the downfall of some of their champion?.
In this event there were twenty competi
tors', including Arthur Blake of the Bos
ton Athletic Association. He was not able
to run the twenty-six miles and fell out.
FlacK, the Austrian, was also forced to
abandon the race. Both he and Blake
dropped out exhausted -when they had
covered half the distance.
When the winner crossed the finishing
line the spectators rose to their feet, and
for a time every souna was silenced by a
great roar of praise. Prince Constantine,
the heir apparent to the throne, was, with
other members of the royal household, in
the box set apart for the use of the King
and his family. He left his seat and,
walking to the winner, shook him heartily
by the hand.
The enthusiasm was renewed when Vasi
lakes. another Greek, came in second, and
Belokai, also a Greek, came in third. The
prize, in addition to an olive wreath, is a
handsome cup given by M. Breal, a well
known French savant and writer on myth
ologic subjects. The time of the "winner
was 2 hours and 4S minutes. Vasilakes
covered the distance in three hours.
Prior to the finish of this race other
events were decided as follows:
The lO'i-rnetres race was won by Thomas
E. B^rke of Boston in 12 seconds. Hoff
man, the German champion, was second.
The high jump was won by Ellery H.
Clark of Harvard, a member of the Boston
team, who covered 181 centimetres.
The hurdle race of 110 metres was won
by Thomas P. Curtis of Boston in 17 3-5
seconds. Goulding. the English champion,
wa? second.
The contests on the parallel bars were
won by Fiatow, a German, and Zutter, a
Swiss. The contests at climbing a pole
were won by the Greek athletes, Andri,
Kopoulos and Xenikis. The pole jump
was won by W. W. Hoyt of Harvard, of
the Boston Athletic Association, who
scored 3.30 metres. A. C. Tyler of|Prince
ton University was second, with 3.20
-metres.
The Paine brothers, Americans, won the
rifle and revolver contests.
In the high jump James B. Connolly of
the Suffolk Athletic Club, and Robert Gar
rett, captain of the Princeton team, each
acored 1.65 metres.
The city was again illuminated to-night.

OMAHA, NEBB.,April 10.â Gold has been
found in paying quantities in Calboun, a
small town in Washington County, about
fifteen miles north of this city, and the
greatest excitement prevails among the
farmers. Otto Wagner, in digging a well,
discovered a ledge of rock at a depth of 160
feet which on being examined by the Gov
ernment assayist here yielded $16 of gold
to the ton. . Farmers are holding their
lands at greatly advanced prices and well
digging has become a fad during the past
twenty-four hours.

CHICAGO, Jll., April 10.â At 3:10 p. m.
a remarkably successful laid was made
upon the Public Stock Exchange, the big
concern doing a bucket-shop business at
126 Washington street. There were over
125 men in the place at the time and the
appearance of the officers was the
signal for a grand rush. Probably fifteen
men escaped before the officers could bar
the doors, but the remainder were held
prisoners in the trading-room of the con
cern and shortly afterward transferred to
police headquarters in the City Hall. The
police and officers of the Civic Federation
then began the work of gutting the place
and the nig blackboards, tickers and other
paraphernalia were removed.

"Sound" Money Men Fail to Defeat a
Platform Advanced by the
Silverites.
PORTLAND, Or., April 10.â The Re
publican State Convention adjourned at 6
o'clock this afternoon, after a two days'
session. There was a close contest over
the selection of delegates to St. Louis,
which resulted in the election of John W.
Meldrum, Robert A. Booth, Charles Hil
ton and Charles H. Dodd, with Max
Pracht, George A. Steel, M. C. Harrison
and J. M. Vandyne as alternates. All are
known "sound"-money men, and pledeed
to McKinley first, last and all the time.
E. L. Smith, T. T. Greer, S. M. Yoran and
J. F. Caples were chosen Presidential
electors. For Supreme Judge, Robert S.
Bean was nominated for re-election by
acclamation.
There was much discussion over the
adoption of a platform and resolutions.
Twenty-four out of the thirty-two mem
bers of the committee reported a platform
substantially the same as the Minneapolis
Elatform of 1892, with the plank on the
nancial question demanding the use of
both gold and silver and suitable legisla
tion to maintain the parity of the two
metals ''so that the purchasing and debt
paying power of the dollar, whether of
gold, silver or paper, shall be at all times
equal." A minority report, signed by
eight members, demanded an out-and-out
declaration for gold.
Eloquent speeches were made pro and
con. by leading jurists and politicians, but
the silver men were in the majority and
defeated the goldbugs by a vote of 129
to 108.
Local differences in the Republican
party cropped up on every possible occa
sion, and finally resulted in the Carey-
Hmne faction naming Sol Hirsch for State
Committeeman, Charles F. Lord for Dis
trict Attorney and D. P. Thompson for
member of the State Equalization Board.
A. F. Bears of the Simon clique was nomi
nated for Circuit Judge. The Simon men
acknowledge total defeat, both on the
money question and the nomination of
officers. The Carey men are jubilant over
the result, and will hold a city and county
convention on April 15 to put up an oppo
sition ticket.
After hearing eloquent speeches lauda
tory of McKinley the convention ad
journed.
OREGOy DEMOCRATS.
Silver Men Triuniplt and Cleveland 1*
Turned Down.
PORTLAND, Or., April 10.â The Demo
cratic State Convention finished its labors
this evening and adjourned. The chief
feature of interest was the division of the
silver men from those supporting "sound"
money principles and the silver men's
victory over their opponents. The con
vention sends silver delegates to the Na
tional convention. The resolution indors
ing Cleveland was voted down, and L. H.
Kelly of Clatsop County declared that this
convention "had offered wanton and
gratuitous insult to a Democratic Presi
dent." The vole for Presidential electors
resulted in the naming of Dr. Ogilsbee of
Wasco, Edward Kilfeather of Multnomah,
J. M. Carroll of Union and John Burnett
of Benton County.
At the afternoon session the judicial
district nominations were ratified by the
convention and the following nominations
were made: Supreme Judge, J. Burnett
of Corvallis; District .Tudfte, George E.
Chamberlain of Portland; Prosecuting At
torney, Judge M. L. Pipes of Portland;
First District, Congressman, Jeff H. Myers
of Salem; Second District, A. S. Bennett
of The Dalles.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1896.
RAWED BY
A BLAINE MOB
Two Sneak Thieves Taken
From a Prison and
Whipped.
STRAPPED TO A POST.
Lashes Wielded With Terrible
Effect by a Party of
Vigilantes.
RELEASED WHEN NEARLY DEAD
The Wretches Driven Across the
State Line With Their Hands
Still Manacled.
BLAINE, Wash., April 10.â Wearying
of the tardiness of the officers in catching
and the slow processes of the law in
punishing offenders, the citizens of Blame
last night resolved to establish an old
fashioned whipping-post and find whether
it would not prove more effective than
courts and lawyers. Their iirst trial of
the innovation seems to have been emi
nently successful, for two thieves, who
were thrashed within an inch of their lives
with cat-o'-nine-tails, have left the State
never to return, bearing on their backs
seams and scars that will stay with them
until the grave receives them into its
eternal embrace.
During the last few years from time to
time a number of stores and private resi
dences here have been broken into and
robbed. The officers have in each case
been unable to secure sufficient evidence
to authorize an arrest, but suspicion
pointed directly to Alfred Hazelton, his
two brotners, Henry and Frank, and
several of their friends, known as the
Hazelton gang. Some months ago they
were ordered out of town, but they went
only across the border line and lived about
a mile from here, and at times in Van
couver and New Westminster, B. C.
Alfred and Harry Hazelton ventured to
return to Blame last Monday. That night
they were captured at the hut of a half
breed near town and were lodged in jail,
where they remained until last night.
A party of citizens, to the number of
twenty, visited the jail at midnight last
night, forced an entrance, and took the
brothers from their cell. They were quiet
ly conducted to the boundary line, where
they were stripped of their clothes and
terribly lashed with horsewhips and raw
hides. They were then allowed to dress,
and, with their hands tied behind them,
were told to get over the line, and that,
should either of them ever be seen again
in Blame, he would be hanged. The men
wore glad to promise ali that was asked.
CALIFORNIA'S FRUIT CROP
Outlook for the Season Discussed
by the State Horticultural
Society.
Early Frosts Found to Have Done Con-
siderable Damage in Several
Localities.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 10.â The
State Horticultural Society held a meeting
in the Supreme Court chamber of the
Capitol building to-day, and the main sub
ject discussed was the outlook for the fruit
crop of this season. B. F. Walton of Yuba
City stnted thai in sections the crop would
be excellent, excepting that almonds, late
peaches, cherries, apricots and early plums
had been slightly touched by frost.
It was stated that along the Sacramento
River there would be an extra large crop
of pears, but that almonds, apricots and
plums were badly damaged. The cherry
and plum crops were light in the Ameri
can River district and the prune croD
would be light.
George F. Ditzler of Biggs, Butte
County, stated that the apricot crop in his
section was a total failure. There was a
light crop of late peaches and n neavy
crop of pears. Around Vina, Tenant a
County, peaches were seriously injured.
Around Lodi almonds were badly injured,
but prunes were good. In Yolo County
there would be a heavy crop of apricots, a
light crop of almonds, a good crop of
peaches, a fair crop of prunes and any
quantity of pears. Wine grapes were
greatly injured by frost.
B. M. Lelong reported a large crop of
pears in Alameda County, peaches and
apricots short and an enormous crop of
olives.

SANTA CRUZ'S NEW COURTHOUSE.
It Is Only a Shanty, but the Opening of Court
Therein Will Be Fittingly Cele
brated.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 10. â The
Superior Court will meet to-morrow morn
ing at 10 o'clock in the little building tem
porarily erected by the Board ef Supervi
sors for the accommodation of Judge
Logan, pending the completion of the new
building. The shanty is built of rough
lumber, but is lined and prettily papered
within, and will make a comfortable and
not unattractive place of meeting for the
court. Desks, chairs and other articles
were moved to-day, and the opening of
court on the county's own property will be
an event of great interest to the people
who have waited patiently for the new
building that will not be completed for
another three months.
The Citj r Council held a special meeting
to-night and passed a fire ordinance to

stone, iron or brick buildings within the

mercial and Savings Bank of this city will

"The bank will reopen its doors to
morrow under conditions much more
favorable for its success than it has ever
before enjoyed. With an increase of the
capital from $300,000 to $500,000, there is a
certainty that, with conservative manage

paid-up capital of $500,000. There is now
money enough in our vaults for the trans

The Identity of Postmaster

Doubt.
WORKED IN THE DARE.
Poor Description of the Men

Victim.
BRAVERY CAUSED HIS DEATH.
Shot While Attempting to Defend
His Property From the
Robbers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 10.â Later
details of the robbery of the postoffice at
Puente and the killing of Postmaster John
Haye3 Jr. prove the crime to have been
one of the most daring ever committed in
Southern California. Hayes was shot
down while bravely attempting to defend
his property, after the highwaymen had
driven from his general store, in which
the postoince was located, a man and a
boy who had learned of hia danger and
hastened to his assistance. The murdered
man was unmarried and 37 years of age.
Hayes slept in a room in the rear of his
store. He had locked his safe, put out the
lights and stepped to the front door to
lock it, when two masked robbers con
fronted him and, at the points of pistols,
marched him to the rear of the store and
commanded him to unlock the safe. He
said he could not do so without a light.
A candle was procured and Hayes was at
work on the combination when John
Petech, a 16-year-old boy, attracted by the
light, came across the street to see what
was going on. Taking in the situation,
the lad hastened to give the alarm. He
met William Bryant and the two returned
to the store.
The robbers heard them coming, and
made prisoners of them as they entered,
marched them to the rear of the store and
ejected them from the back door. While
the robbers' attention was thus tempo
rarily withdrawn from Hayes he retreated
into his bedroom, and, procuring a lantern
and a revolver, returned to the storeroom
to defend his property. As he stepped
forward the robbers fired ut>on him, and he
fell to the floor with a bullet wound in his
right breast, which proved fatal in a few
hours. The murderers then fled and are
still at large, but officers are scouring the
country far and wive for them.
Hayes retained consciousness long
enough to give an account of the crime,
but could give no good description of the
robbers. After the inquest Hayes' body
will be sent to relatives in San Francisco
for burial. He lived at Puente two years,
and was highly respected by the people
there. The identity of the murderers is
unknown, but the officers are working on
important clews.

Owen was a passenger* standing on the
platform of a car. The disaster was caused
by a misplaced switch.
LOS ANGELES ROMANCE
Albert Lovett Is Twenty-Two
Years Old and Has Been
Thrice Married.
His Mother's Answer in the Damage
Suit Filed by Wife Num.
ber Three.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 10.â Mrs.
Harriett Lovett, in her answer to the com
plaint of Mrs. Bella Lovett, who sues her
parents-in-law for $25,000 damage because
of the alleged alienation of her husband's
affections, makes allegations that tend to
show that Albert H. Lovett, the young
husband who has been estranged, has been
somewhat of a gay Lothario in his time.
Albert was just 22 years old when he mar
ried the plaintiff, in 1894, but, according to
his mother's statement, he was married
twice before that.
Mother Lovett, in her answer, goes some
what into details about her son's doings,
from which it appears that he has had
some lively matrimonial experiences lor
one so young. She says he was an invalid
and married Bella in 1894, when in Cali
fornia for his health. For five years be
fore that he was wild and reckless. In
1890, while away from home, he married a
woman in Chicago without his parents'
consent, and she subsequently obtained a
divorce from him. Again, in 1892, the
young man married another woman, from
whom he subsequently separated.
Mrs. Lovett avers that Mrs. Bella Lovett
herself had been married before she wedded
young Lovett, and was a divorced woman,
and that she expected by marrying her son
to be benefited materially. She claims
that one reason why her son did not like
his wife was because she was continually
asking him for money when he bad none
to give.
Albert and his mother went on a trip to
Boston, which the wife objected to, and
which she claims was undertaken at the
urgent request of her mother-in-law. In
her answer, Mrs. Harriet Lovett says that,
instead of trying to influence her son to
take this trip, he implored her to take
him, and said if she did not furnish him
with funds to get away from his wife he
would leave on a freightcar, or would go
on foot, or would "join a circus." The
circus threat appears to have proven po
tential, for Mrs. Lovett bought her aon a
ticket and whisk.cd him away to Boston.
The old people are .reputed to be quite
wealthy, but they deny this, and say Mrs.
Bella Lovett is not entitled to one cent for
having inveigled their wayward son into
his third unfortunate marriage.

I received the Belt on the 7th day of last month (February). 1 put it on the evening of the

FRESNO GROWERS
FORM A COMBINE
Determined to Check the
Cutting of Rates on
Raisins.
JOIN IN AN AGREEMENT
Output of the District to Be
Controlled by a Central
Organization,
IT WILL REGULATE PRICES.
Packing-Houses to Be Operated and
Money Loaned to Needy
Vineyardists.
FRESNO, Cai., April 10.â After years of
cutting and slashing, of distrust, doubt
and discontent, which bankrupted many
growers of raisins and almost totally and
hopelessly demoralized the whole raisin
industry in this valley, a plan has finally
been formulated whereby the marketing
of raisins has been raised to a basis which
promises results of the greatest moment to
California growers. This is the outcome
of many weeks of almost incessant labor
by eight prominent business men, fonr
from the Hundred Thousand Club and a
liKe number from the Chamber of Com
merce. The plan agreed upon by this
committee was unanimously approved yes
terday by what is known as the commis
sion-packers of this valley and also adopted
unanimously by both civic organizations
in a special meeting last night. To-day
twelve of the most influential packers took
the initial steps toward the formation of a
raisin combine.
The plan outlined last night is covered
in the following salient points: The for
mation of a corporation with a capital
stock of $1,000,000, $100,000 to be paid in
before any contracts made with the grow
ers are delivered to the corporation. The
name of the corporation will be the Cali
fornia Raisin Association. The object
shall be to loan money to raisin-grower.-;
to concentrate the selling of raisins as far
as possible and to establish a central sell
ing agency; to buy, pack, stem, grade, box
and sack raisins; to rent, build, purchase
and operate packing-houses and ware
houses, and to do anything and everything
necessary to the businesn of purchasing,
caring for and disposition of raisins and
the product of raisin grapevines.
All sales of raisins shall be made by and
the right to sell shall be confined to the
corporation, under certain restrictions.
All contracts made by the corporation
â¢with growers, packers or dealers in raisins
shall contain a clause requiring all raisins
placed with the corporation to be sold
on!y at the prices and subject to condi
tions fixed by its committee, and its con
signments will not be made under any
circumstances. The corporation will agree
that the minimum advance on good
average quality of raisins shall be 1 cent
per pound, exclusive of packing and stem
ming charges, which advance s^hall be a
guaranteed advance to the grower.
As fast as raisins are packed, stemmed,
graded and inspected certificates shall be
issued by the corporation to growers for
their respective deliveries, which certifi
cates shall specify the date of delivery,
quantity, kinds and grade according to the
inspection. These certificates shall show
the advances made and all packing charges
against the raisins. After raisins have
been received and accepted by the corpo
ration and certificates have been issued to
the grower such certificate shall be con
clusive evidence of the weight, kind and
grade designated by the inspector's brand,
and any allowances made on account of
rejection thereafter shall be borne by the
corporation.
Packing charges shall be fixed as fol
lows: Dehesa clusters, 50 cents per 20
--pound box; London layers, 32% cents per
20-pound box; London layers (plain
papers), 30 cents per 20-pound box; mus
catels (loose), 20 cents per 20-pound box ;
muscatels (loose), $9 50 per ton in 50-pound
boxes; sacked goods, $8 per ton.
A growers' committee of five and five
members of the board of directors of the
corporation sitting jointly shall determine
â when the necessary percentage of raisins
for the season of 1896 has been obtained,
in order to make all contracts made by the
corporation with the growers binding and
in fell force.
HUMBOLDT TAX CASE DECIDED.
Judge Hunter Rules Upon the Right of the
State to Se// Lands of Delin
quents.
EUREKA, Cal., April 10.â Judge Hun
ter of Department 2 of the Superior Court
to-day handed down a decision of great in
terest not only to property-owners of this
county but of the entire State. A month
ago Z. Russ & Sons Company, a corpora
tion, owning extensive tracts of land in
this county, filed suit against J. L. Crich
tcn, Tax Collector of Humboldt County,
to enjoin him from issuing tax deeds to
the State for certain lands owned by the
company and sold to the State prior to the
time tho patents were issued.
The suit comprised two claims. In the
first the lands embraced were United
States land when the taxes were levied,
and the Tax Collector, instead of selling
the possessory right of the persons against
whom the assessments were levied, sold
the land to the State for the taxes levied
between the years 1874 and 1883. In this
case the court" holds that as no patent had
been issued the title to the lands was In
the United States. The land not being
subject to taxation and sale for taxes the
court holds that the sale is void, and an
injunction restraining the Tax Collector
from delivering the deed to the State has
been grantea.
In many cases where a man's land is in
danger of sale to the State for taxes levied
and unpaid years ago the same state of
affairs exists as in this case, where, instead
of Belling the possessory interest, the land
itself is sold. Eight suits similar to this
were hied, this being made the trial suit.
In the second case the lands were State
lands and had been sold to the person to
â¢whom they were assessed, 20 per cent of
the purchase price being paid and the cer
tificates of sale issued. Subsequent to the
issuance of these certificates of sale and
before patents for the lands were issued by
the State these taxes were levied, and
while they were sold to the State which
had not finally parted with its title to the
lands the court liolms mat the title which
the Mate originally had to these lands and
the titie it received by tax sale did not be
come merged in one so as to pass the un
clouded title to the person who received
the patent. The injunction asked in this
second case was denied, the court holding
that taxes levied on the land after the
State had given its certificate of purchase
to the holder created a lien on the land in
favor of the State, which must be satisfied
before the cloud on the patentee's title can
be removed.
STOCKTON ASTJjVM SHORTAGE,
Action to He Tir ought at Once Againtt
Major Orr'a Bondsmen.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 10.â The board
of directors of the State Insane Asylum
to-day decided to proceed without more
delay to put matters in shape so that an
action might be commenced against the
bondsmen of Major Orr, the defaulting
treasurer of the institution. Recently the
Attorney-General wrote to President
Southworth that he had no official knowl
edge of the shortage, and that the proper
method of procedure was to officially lay
the facts before Governor Budd, wno
would in turn acquaint the Controller and
the Attorney-General of the deficit of over
$10,000 in Major Orr's funds. A resolution
was passed to-day authorizing President
Southworth to prepare a statement of the
facts in the case and forward them with
out delay to the Governor.

Thrown Under the Wheel* of a Heavily
Loaded Wagon*
STOCKTON, Cal., April 10. â Eugene
Jones, a teamster, met with a painful acci
dent in a runaway while coming down
the grade from Priests' Hill. He was
driving for Sylvester Carlin and had eight
mules attached to the wagon, with a
trailer behind the main vehicle. One of
the wheelhorses was a fractious animal
and began to kick when the team was on
the down grade. The brake-block came
off and the wagon ran down on to the
horses. They started to run down the
hill, and Jones became entangled in the
reins. He was thrown off and the heavily
loaded wagon passed over one ankle, com
pletely crushing it and tearing two toes
from his foot. He was taken to Chinese
Camp, where a physician attended to his
injuries. ________________
TRAGEDY IN RENO'S JAIL
Murderer Vaughn Attempts to
Cheat the Law by Taking
His Life.
Swallows Poison After Having Been
Convicted of Killing the Litster
Boys.
RENO, Nev., April 10.â The jury in the
case of the State against Alfred Vaughn,
charged with murdering two boys named
Litster in Lander County in 1893, after
being out twelve hours, brought in a
verdict this morning of murder in the first
degree. Similar verdicts nave twice before
been rendered in the case. Each time the
Supreme Court granted a rehearing. The
prisoner appeared unmoved when the
verdict was announced, and, with the an-
nouncement from Judge Cheney that at 1
o'clock the time of sentence would be pro
nounced, he was removed to an iron cell
in the county jail.
A few minutes after noon Under Sheriff
Caugrhlin went to Vaughn's cell and
noticed the latter acted strangely, but
thought his actions were simply the result
of the subdued excitement under which
the prisoner was laboring and endeavored
to cheer him with encouraging words.
Going to the cell later Vaughn was found
in a collapsed condition on the floor. It
was then evident that the prisoner had
swallowed poison with suicidal iutent.
Three physicians were summoned, who
Jabored all the afternoon in an endeavor
to bring the man out of his stupor. He
seemed to waver between life and death
without apparent change up to 7 o'clock
this evening, when the physicians gave out
the report that his condition was more
favorable and the chances for recovery
good.
It i 3 not definitely known how Vaughn
secured the drug, but the belief is general
that it was given him by some of his rela
tives, who have constantly been in at
tendance at court during the trial. Some
believe the vial was hidden in a bouquet of
flowers given the prisoner by his mother.
SIGHTED A DERELICT.
The Hull of the Helen Merriam Still
Rides the Waves.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., April 10.â
Captain J. H. Hellison of the schooner
Helen M. Kimball, which arrived yester
day from San Francisco for a cargo of
lumber, to-day reported at the Hydro
graphic office that on the morning of
March 27, at 8 o'clock, the Helen M. Kim
ball passed quite near the dismasted
schooner Helen Merriam, which was some
time ago fired by a passing vessel after
having lost its masts and rigging. Ac
cording to Captain Hellison, the attmpt to
remove the derelict has been a failure, as
it is still floating around, a menace to nav
igation of vessels on the coast. The
charred and blackened hull is plainly dis
tinguishable in daylight, but at night the
vessel could not be found with a search
light. The location of the derelict when
sighted by the Kimtall was 38deg. 42 mm.
north and 124 deg. 16 mm. west.

SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 10.â There is
no change in the position of the contestants
for Queen of the carnival, Mrs. Bums hav
ing increased her lead by twenty-nine
votes to-day. This scant advantage of
thirty votes seems indicative of the final
result to-morrow and wagers on the favor
ite against the field find no takers. The
votes will be counted at 1 o'clock to-mor
row afternoon and the contest will close at
8 o'clock at night. The lightest vote of
the week was recorded to-day, as the
friends of the candidates seemed afraid of
exciting the opposition to greater efforts
by any show of strength to-day. A large
vote is not looked for at the first count
to-morrow for the same reason, and each
side will play a waiting game until the
supreme moment, depending upon close
watching of the ballot-box to ascertain the
amount necessary to win the coveted
honor.
In a letter received to-day, signed "Mayor
of Occidental," the voting committee was
informed that Miss Jessica Kloppenburg
"would be strictly and everlastingly in it,"
and that when the last Santa Rosa nickel
had clicked against Occidental gold the
plucky little town over the hills would also
pay for its favorite's costumes, which were
already ordered from San Francisco. The
"Mayor" neglected, however, to inclose
any cash to back his bold words, and those
who know the distinguished official de
clare that he is addicted to what Hoyle de
clares to be necessary every seven hands in

has been commenced on the grand stand
at the wheelmen's new bicycle track and a
force of ten or fifteen men will be busy from

take on a festival appearance. On Mon
day carpenters will remove the old bell
tower from the square and erect in its
stead a tasty stand, where the queen of the
carnival will be crowned. The contest for
queen is much more exciting than it was
last year. To-day 300 votes were deposited
in the ballot-box, and of this number Miss
Petray received enough to place her in
third place. Miss Petray is a brunette of
commanding presence, and would make an
ideal queen, fehe is a teacher in the pub
lic schools and if the thousand children
carry out their plan she will be elected.
Miss Alice Haigh still leads, with Edna
Biddle second and Miss Nellie Petray, Oza

Xy HOTIXJB TO LOU A* GEL B a.
An Oregon Woman to Claim a Share of
the Downey Estate.
PORTLAND.Ob., ApriI 10.â Mrs. Aman
da Guerro, claiming to be a niece of the
late Mrs. Governor Downey, who for the
past five years has been a seamstress ii?
Southern Oregon, passed through here for
Los Angeles Tuesday to litigate for the
estate left her by her aunt.
Mrs. Guerro told an old California friend
here that the money was withheld from her
because of her change of religion. Mrs.
Downey was a most devout Catholic, who
never in many years neglected to attend
early morning mass, rain or shine. It is
alleged that in her will she stipulated that
in the event of any one of her devisees
abandoning the Catholic faith before the
distribution of her estate after her death
such renegade from the church should be
disinherited.
The name the woman now bears was
that of her first husband, who died about
eight years ago. A year thereafter she
wedded a Protestant clerk in a Los Angeles
Bank, the ceremony being performed in an
Episcopal cburch. Mrs. Guerro says after
that her relatives refused to recognize her,
and a month later she and her husband
left Los Angeles for Seattle. About a year
ago, this woman says, she became con
science-stricken, returning to the religious
faith of her ancestors. Later she also re
solved to make a demand for her aunt's
bequest to her, which has steadily and per
sistently been refused her.
.4* IXTHAX BETOBMEB.
toung Chief of the Cayuset Declare*
War on Whisky.
PENDLETON, Ok., April 10.â Young
Chief, the head of the Cayuse tribe of In
dians on the Umatilla .Reservation, has of
late been conducting a literary bureau.
Especially since the laws have been inter
preted in such a manner as to give his
people freedom to purchase and drink
whisky the chief has been prolific of com
munications to the East Oregonian, in
which he has urged that some action be
taken to cure the Indians of their habit.
Young Chief has now risen to the dignity
of a reformer and has proposed another
plan for the correction of the evil tenden
cies of his dusky warriors.
The plan may not be novel so far as con
cerns reservations further east, wnere the
Indians have adopted all the modes of civ
ilized life, but out here, where the red
skins are arrayed in their flaming colored
blankets and go about with their long
flowing locks, the idea is new indeed,
Young Chief's plan is set forth in his
letter, which reads:
At Home, April 6, 1896.
By Young Chief to my Dear Friends : I regret
very much to hear that so many of our people
are causing so much trouble and pain to those
who are friends to us all. I, for one, am almost
discouraged to hear of so many being put in
jail, all owing to the liberty of getting whisky,
which is a ruin to us all. 1 regret it very much,
as I look upon you all as my children. I hope,
my dear friends, that you, Kasn Kash, Peo and
others will meet together and hold meetings to
instruct our people to quit drinking liquor;
advise them to go to church, send their chil
dren to school and teach them to work, make
gardens, raise potatoes and other vegetables,
such as our fathers and mothers used to do
when I was young. lam your friend,
Young Chief.

Policeman Under Arrest.
SPOKANE, â Wash., April 10. â Paddy
O'Brien, arrested last evening in a gang of
hoboes, is found to be the man who mur
dered Police Officer James B. Scanlon at
Pocatello, Idaho, a short time ago.
His resemblance to the description had

ing the suspicions. A telegram to-night
says the Sheriff is on the way to identify
the man.
O'Brien is wanted for the brutal murder
of Officer Scanlon, depot policeman at
Pocatello. O'Brien, with other hoboes,
was causing trouble, when Scanlon tried

Heavy Loss Sustained by a Carnival of
Kate- Cutting.
LONDON, Eng., April 10.â The directors
of the Grand Trunk Railway Company
met here to-day. The president, Sir
Charles Rivers Wilson, urged that the
stockholders be allowed to put into effect
the needed reforms which they had in
view. The annual report was adopted.
Sir Charles Rivers Wilson said there was
nothing to complain of in regard to the
volume of traffic, but unfortunately the
freight rates were lower than they ever
had been.
Reckless competition on the part of the
through lines in the United Slates, ho
said, had had its climax in a carnival of
rate-cutting, and the reduction of rates
had caused a loss of revenue amounting to
Â£60,000 during the last year. He expressed
his regret that the Canadian Pacific
Railway had not joined the Traffic As
sociation, but said that the committee of
the association, recently appointed in New-
York, was still hopeful of inducing the
Canadian Pacific and the Norfolk and
Western companies to join. Among the
important steps the board had taken, he
said, was to obtain the appointment of the
general manager of the Grand Trunk as
one of the receivers of the Central Ver
mont Company.
For American Ye**elt.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 10.â Some

XAMAQATA. AT OMAHA.
The Field Marshal Talks of Affairs in
Japan.
OMAHA, Nebk., April 10.â Marquis
Yamagata, field marshal of Japan, and
his staff spent yesterday in Omaha, tbe
special guests of Department Commander
General Coppinger. After attending to
urgent diplomatic duties his Excellency
granted an interview to a representative
of The United Press, who, witn Private
Secretary Terusaki acting as interpreter,
conversed with him on matters of general
interest and in particular the latest cable
dispatches from Japan relating to army
changes.
Marquis Yamagata said that the In
crease of the regiments in Japan from
twenty-eight to fifty-two was something
that had Jong been contemplated and that
doing this had no significance of approach
ing difficulties. The Marshal expressed
himself as highly pleased with his recep
tion in this country and said that the most
kindly relations existed between the
United States and Japan. It was the wish
of Japan to continue on friendly terms
with all countries on the face of the globe.
"Japan," he said, "is at peace with all
the great European countries. There is no
intention of either Japan or Russia oc
cupying Korea. It is the intention of both
countries that Korea shall be an independ
ent country. The occupation of a portion
of Korea by either country does not mean
that there is the slightest danger of a con
flict between them."
On the financial system in Japan and Its
adaptation to the needs of the country, he
had very positive views. He declared' that
Japan had no wish for a gold standard, as
the Oriental nations, wiih which it had
large commercial interests, used the white
metal.
TRACED BY THE SMOKE.
Discovery of a Murder and Suicide in a
Tenement.
SALEM, Mass., April 10.â The smell of
smoke yesterday morning*ina house at 122
Boston street led to the discovery of a
double tragedy. The house was occupied
by seven tenements. The people in the
upper part of the house smelled smoke
and tried to trace the smoke to its origin.
They found that it came from the room
occupied by Miss Josephine Manning, a
dressmaker.
The door was fastened, and as there
was no response to knocks entrance was
forced. The room was full of smoke,
which came from a smoldering fire in the
bed.
Miss Manning lay in the bed dead, with
her head covered with blood from bullet
wounds. Across the foot of the bed the
body of a man was stretched. He was not
quite dead, but died before a doctor could
be summoned. He, too, had been shot.
The affair was evidently a murder and
suicide. The man was recognized as
James E. Flynn, who has for some time
been keeping company with Miss Man
ning. He was a widower, 35 years old,
and she was 38. He nad evidently killed
the woman and then committed suicide.
The cause of the tragedy is unknown,
and it is not known when Flynn went to
the house. "When found be was fully
dressed in his working clothes. The
family living upstairs reported that they
heard three reports about an hour before
the tragedy was discovered, but they did
not recognize them as pistol shots and
paid no attention to them. The woman
had two bullet wounds in her head, and
the third shot had fatally wounded Flynn.
The bed had evidently been set on fire by
the pistol.
FOR MIZMS' PROMOTION.
Lieutenant- Oeneral Deemed an Appro
priate Title for the Veteran.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 10.-Hull
of lowa, the Chairman of the House Mili
tary Committee, filed to-day the majority
report on the joint resolution which pro
motes Major-General Miles to the rank of
lieutenant-ceneral. The report states that
the committee deems the rank of lieuten
ant-general the most appropriate title for
the general commanding the army in a
Nation of this magnitude, the army now
numbering 25,000 men. In case of war, by
tilling up the companies and regiments, it
would be more than twice that number.

Badly Hamaged by Fire.
CHICAGO, 111., April 10.;â The four
story building at 278 Madison street was
badly damaged by fire this morning. A.
Ellinger & Co., cloak manufacturers,

Murdered While Asleep.
CHICAGO, 111., April 10.â William
Smitn, a painter, was shot and instantly
killed while asleep by William Cummings
this morning. Cummings was arrested.
Jealousy is believed to be the cause of the
murder, Smith having supplanted Cum
mings in the affections of Miss Maggie
Connors, with whom Smith was living.
w. w. McNeil.
One of the kindest of gentlemen that
ever put pan to paper, that ever spoke
word to man, is Mr. W. W. McNeil, nos
pital steward of the Second Artillery,
N. G. C. Mr. McNeil is not very talkative,
but what he says he means, and when he
does say anything it is with the best in
tention in the world. He has none but the
best feeling for Joy's Vegetable Sarsa
parilla, and gladly told the writer of the
great good Joy's had done. Said he: "I
used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla because
I felt dull, heavy, almost sluggish. As
soon as I discovered that I needed some
thing to make me feel good I took a bottle
of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and after
using the second bottle I became my old
self again. Mind you, I was not on the
brink of the grave; I merely wanted a
blood medicine and I used Joy's.

Republican County Committee
men Select Primary Polling-
Places.
AMENDMENTS TO THE CALL.
The Appointment of Election Officers
Is Deferred Until Next MonÂ«
day Night.
The Republican county committeemen
selected last evening the thirty-six|polling
places at which the delegates to the State
Convention will be voted for at the regular
Republican primary next Wednesday.
All the eighteen members of the com
mittee were on nand at the crowded Re
publican headquarters at SSO Market street
and the members representing the Fourth
and Fifth districts formed separate bodies
for the transaction of business. As the
business was that of arranging details the
committees held executive meetings in
private rooms.
The division of the various Assembly
districts iuto two polling districts each,
the fixing of polling places and the adop
tion of slight amendments to the election
call adopted a week ago constituted the
work accomplished. The list of polling-
places and the precincts comprising the
polling districts will be found in the offi
cial call, published entire in another col
umn of this paper. Most of the county
committeemen hied their nominations for
election officers, but election olficere will
not be officially named until next Monday
evening.
Both committees decided that the hours
Originally fixed at from 9 a. m. to 7 f. m.
wore unnecessarily long and the call was
amended by providing that the polls
should be open from Ito7p. m. Another
amendment makes it necessary that nomi
nations for delegates to be voted for be
tiled with the secretary of the proper com
mittee on or before noon of next Monday
to receive recognition.
The polling-places named by the county
committcemen were in nearly every in
stance approved after careful considera
tion of the surroundings and the oonven
ienco of the places named. The division
of the Assembly districts into polling dis
tricts was likewise carefully considered
with reference to an equal division of the
voting strength and the convenience of the
re.-idents. There was entire harmony in
both committees as to the action taken
and all interests were given fair consider
ation, as they will be in the selection of
election officers.
The committees will meet again next
Monday evening at Republican headquar
ters to appoint election officers and com
plete the details of primary arrange
ments.
Republicans throughout the City are
taking a lively interest in the coming pri
mary and in most of the districts tickets
are being made up.
In the Forty-first District the Repub
lican clubs have federated for the purpose
of nominating a ticket and one of these,
the McKinley Club, will meet to-night at
I^o9 Polk street to select its quota ot nom
inees.
Sixty-eight members of the Republican
Executive Council met in Judge Bahr's
courtroom attiieCitj' Hall last evening and
finally decided that the present evecutive
committee should be the campaign com

CANINES IN A BIG SHOW
The Pacific Kennel Club Pre
paring an Extensive
Exhibition.
George Gould, August Bulmont, Her.
man Oelrichs and Other Prominent
Fanciers to Make Entries.
The Pacific Kennel Club is preparing
for what its president, H. Bier, confidently
asserts will be by far the biggest bench
Bhow ever held on this coast. He calcu
lates that over 500 dogs will be exhibited,
and entries are already commencing to ar
rive at the office of the bench show com
mittee at 628 Market street, though the in
tending exhibitors have until April 28 to
make their entries. The show is dated for
May 8, 9 and 10.
For several weeks the president and the
bench show committee, consisting of T. J.
Watson (chairman), Howard Vernon (sec
retary), C. A. Haight, Len D. Owens and
E. W. Briggs, has been in active corre
spondence with prominent dog breeders
all over the country. One of the chief re
sults of this activity has been the securing
of the services of James Mortimer of Long
Island as judge. Mortimer has judged all
the prominent shows in the country this
year, and is considered the greatest Ameri
can kennel authority. Â«
Amone the prominent breeders who
have been induced to interest themselves
in the show are George Gould and August
Beimont. These gentlemen, with others
of almost equal prominence, are getting
together a carload of fancy dogs from
Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is ex
pected' that there will be an exhibit of the
famous bloodhounds from the peniten
tiary at Baton Rouge, La. Herman Oel
richs has entered his famous English set
ter Doch H. A string of dogs is also to be
brought from Victoria, B. C, and from the
tone of the letters received from fanciers at
that place the exhibit :s expected to be a
very strong one.
The first entry to be made was by the
president of the club, who has entered his
famous pointer Capay or "Cap." as his
owner prefers to call l,im. Capay is the
dog chosen lo represent California at the
Eastern lield tries, though owing to the
feet that he has since sustained a broken
rib, a new field champion may have to be
chosen. Cap's sire, the famous English
champion, Glenbeigh, is to.be entered by
Howard \ ernon. Glenbeigh is declared to
be the only dog that ever won the double
event in England, and he has been an in
variable winner in this country. T J
Watson i will enter "Starlight," the winner
of the Pacific Coaat field trials of Bakers
lieid.
Among the features of popular interest,
will be the larjre exhibit of St. Bernards
President Bier expects at least seventy-five
eistnes in this cUum irom San Francisco,
and thÂ»;e will be numerous crackaiacks
from abroad to compete with them." Dr
Veccbl will exhibit a number of dachs
bunl-s the elongated little dogs which
v Â«ve became familiar through the pages of
the comic papers, though these are the
tirst brought to this coast. A number of
griffons, a species of retriever seldom seen
here, will also he exhibited.
Arrangements have been made to set
apart an afternoon for each of the orphan
asylums, when the inmates will be ad
mitted free. Besides the exhibition the
committee have in view a number of spe
cial attractions the nature of which they
are not yet prepared to divulge.
FILTHY BREAD BAKERIES.
Labor Bureau Inspectors Unearth a
"Wretched State of Affairs.
A disgusting state of things is being
revealed by the inspection of bake-shops
now in progress under the auspices of the
State Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
special inspectors found one shop at North
Beach under a sidewalk where there was
a toilet room with very bad drainage. The
darkness, damp and Ptench were reported
to be very bad. In another shop, south of
Market street, the sewers were found to
have rotted, and the board floor floated
upon a mass of liquid riith, which oozed
up through the cracks under the slightest
pressure. Cockroaches were found to
abound in many of the underground places,
and in almost all there was evident need
of whitewash. The kneading troughs,
tables and ovens were discovered to be very
filthy in many oi the shops.
The news of the inspection is traveling
about among the pastry cooks, and in a
number of the shops the inspectors found
that preparations had been made for their
reception, the smell of fresh suds and
chloride of lime being strongly percep
tible. Many of the workmen were found
very poorly housed and wretchedly paid.
The baker's' and Pastry Cooks' Union will,
it is understood, soon take measures to
ameliorate the condition of the employes
in the shops.
COLUMBIA RIVER SALMON
Revival of Old Conflicts Between
Washington and
Oregon.
Danger That the Present Condition of
Things May Cause Trouble in
the Market.
Thinfs on the Columbia River, accord
ing to recent advices, commence to look
' stormy. The old quarrel between Oregon
, and Washington regarding the mode of
j fishing in the river is developing adoi
-1 tional bitterness, while, to cap the climax,
] a grind strike among the salmon-fishers
, is reported.
"This strike rÂ»>likely to prove serious,"
i remarked Chiof Deputy Fish Comiuis
! sioner Babcook yesterday. "It appears
that the rishermen have decided not to
work or permit others to fish in any por
j tion of the river unless the canneriesguar-
I antee the payment of 5 cents for every
j pound of salmon bought by them. This
| will brine about a strange state of things
jin the market. The Alaskan canners and
those to the south of the Columbia pay
from 3}4 to 4^ cents a pound for salmon,
! and some of them find it hard to mate
! their business pay even at those rates.
j The Columbia, however, is the headquar-
I ters for the cream of salmondom. In that
i river, for some reason beat known to
i themselves, the elite, the veritable 400 of
i the salmon tribe, love to congregate.
Hence, Columbia River salmon has al
ways commanded a gilt-edged price. A
considerable quantity of Alaska salmon is
j said to have been palmed off as the Colum
! bia article, but not to such an extent as to
i discredit the brand.
'â¢Now, if this strike is to continue
| throughout the s-ea^on, the canned salmon
! product will fall 300.000 or 400,000 cases
, short. The only result this can have will
be to raise the price of the Alaskan and
i Californian product and also to cause a
scarcity in the market. It maybe, how
i ever, that some adjustment will be reached
j and sucn a condition of affairs averted.
"As to the Columbia River difficulty be
: tween the States of Oregon and Washinsr
i ton, I thought the courts had done some
; thing to conciliate both sides, but the
j matter has apparently cropped up again.
i Oregon has protective laws and Washing
ton has not, hence the constantly recurring
conflicts between rishermen and officials.
It would be well if the case were set at
rest once and for all by some competent
judicial or governmental authority, as the
present conditions frequently occasion
complications. Undoubtedly some exag-
I gerated reports have reached us, but there
must be some truth in them, and the
matter, in my opinion, calls for speedy
I adjustment."

A very rich gold strike has been made in
Willow Creek district, on the Boise belt,
near Boise, Idaho. The strike is in the
Checkmate mine. It is estimated that the
ore runs stiOOO per ton in sold, and there is
a foot of this rich streak. This ledge is
32 feet wide, and all the rest of the ore is
high grade, though nothing to compare to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1896.
DEATH UNDER GROUND
Workmen in the Newton Copper
Mines Said to Be in
Peril.
THEY MAY BE DROWNED OUT.
Labor Commissioners Will Ask the
Legislature for a Special Mine
Inspector;
One of the engineers who formerly
worked at the Newton Copper Mines in
Amador County, has a story to tell, which,
if not exaggerated, reveals a cynical disre
gard for human life on the part of the
owner of the property. The engineer,
who does not wish his name to be pub
lished, states that the mine is entered
through a shaft 400 feet deep, which
descends obliquely into the earth. He says
further:
The shaft was sunk in the early fifties, and
is improperly timbered throughout, and in
great danger of caving in. There is no other
means of egress from the mine, save by an old
air-shaft about 200 feet away from the place
where most of the men have to work. Neither
shaft is provided with ladders, and the only
mode of ascent or descent is by means of
buckets on the main shaft, which can at most
carry two men at a time.
To add to the danger and discomlort, the
mines are lull of water, the buckets being kept
continually in operation and baling out about
45.000 gallons or water daily. Owing to the
dangerous and uncomfortable conditions
which surround the workmen few remain any
length of tinie, some staying only a day or
two. This circumstance enables a certain
large employment agency in this City to turn
what its managers probably call an honest
penny. This establishment charges engineers
$5 and miners $3 for positions which after a
short while they find themselves obliged to
leave, when other men are sent by the agency
at the same rate. The state of the mine is a
coustant menace to the lives of the workmen
employea in it.
The engineer was advised to lay the case
before the State Bureau of Labor Statis
tics, which .he did. The Commissioners
took his statement and made investiga
tions which convinced them that the man's
assertion, far frorc being exapgerateC, was
hardly an adequate presentation of the
facts.
"There should be a governmental inspec
tion of the interior worK of mines." said
the Commissioner. "The State Mining Bu
reau has six special deputies or field men;
but their work is the compilation of sta
tistics only, and the law gives them no
authority to make anything in the nature
of a personal underground investigation.
In the Civil Code of California there is an
act entitled, 'An Act tor the Protection of
Miners,' which provides that ladders, tun
nels and other means of escape in case of
accident be maintained.
"At the next session of the Legislature
we intend to ask for the appointment of a
special mine inspector, to ne attached to
this bureau. He will confine his investi
gations to the conditions which surround
the miners."
BURNING BOGUS MOSEY.
Tom of Counterfeiters' Productions
Going Into a Furnace.
j Five tons of counterfeit money, machines
and other of the paraphernalia necessary
to the manufacture of the "queer" will be
destroyed in Washington -within a few
day*. . â â¢ ,\
So great a quantity of material of this
sort has been collected during the last year
in the secret service division of the treasury
that its destruction has become necessary.
Just now it is carefully put away in boxes
and packages, each labeled with a record
of its contents.
As much care is taken of bad money as
of good money, because it would never do
to have the counterfeits get into circula
tion again through neglect. Every penny
in bogus coin or paper must be strictly
accounted for, and a deficit would be con
sidered as serious a matter as a theft from
the cashroom.
A few days from now the Secretary of
the Treasury will select three of his most
trusted men and will appoint them a com
mittee to superintend the destruction of
the products of criminal ingenuity at pres
ent on hand. Every package will be
opened in their presence, and they will
watch the counting of the contents, which
must correspond to the memorandum in
the record book.
Finally, all of the coin, as well as metal
tools and other apparatus, will be carried
downstairs and put aboard one of the big
ironclad wagons which are used by the de
partment for carrying money. The wagon,
guarded by armed men and followed by
the committee in a carriage, will proceed
to the Washington Navy-yard.
By a special arrangement with the Sec
retary of the Navy, one of the great blast
furnaces in the gunshop will be placed at
the disposal of the committee. The
weighty packages will then be taken from
the wagon and stacked up in front of the
furnace, which is li^e unto that one which
was seven times heated.
Into it tfle stuff will be unceremoniously
shoveled â the coin first and then the coun
terfeiters' machines, engraved steel plates
for false notes, implements of various
kinds, etc. Such things as jimmies and
brass Knuckles go with the rest. In the
lot will be a great quantity of metal
tokens, representing money, such as are
used by manufacturing aud mining com
panies, particularly in the South, for pay
ing their employes. Many of these token's,
the use of which is forbidden by law, bear
a rough resemblance to United States
coins.
Together with the lot go in not a few
things of odd sorts. Among them are ad
vertising tags of tin, made in rude imita
tion of silver quarters. These are not in
tended to serve a criminal purpose, but the
Secret Service gobbles them up just the
same.
The law says that nothing in the like
ness of any security of the United States
shall be permitted. In the collection now
on hand are a number of so-called coia
clusters intended for paper-weights. They
represent clusters of gold and silver pieces.
Of course nobody could pass them as
money, but they come under the statute,
and, besides, there is a special objection to
them.
Coin counterfeiters are apt to have a few
of them on hand, so that if caught they
may pretend that they were merely en
gaged in the manufacture of paper-weights.
I'he great majority of false coins are
made with plaster molds. Such molds are
carried to the navy-yard with the rest of
the material, but are not put into the fur
nace. They are merely knocked to pieces
with hammers, which is an equally effec
tive method of destroying them. What is
cast into the furnace, including the ma
chinery and tools, is melted and reduced
to unrecognizable shape.
It is sold eventually by the Navy De
partment as so much old metal. There is
a small amount of silver in it, inasmuch
as bogus silver pieces are always plated
with silver nowadays by the up-to-date
counterfeiter.
Thus far nothing has been said of the
way in which the paper counterfeits are
destroyed. They are put into a big tank
with hot water and acids, and are cooked
and f tirred about for many hours, until at
length they are reduced to the condition
of pulp.
The pulp is dried, pressed into thick
sheets and sold for paper stock. The
process is the same as that which is ap
plied to the damaged paper money re
deemed by the treasury. Into the great
vat a few days hence will go great quanti
ties of "flash money," which term is used
to describe the printed advertisements in
imitation of the National currency, with
which the country is at all times flooded,
notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the
Government to suppress them. They are
confiscated wherever the detectives of the
Secret Service come across them.
Calendars bearing likenesses of silver
certificates and hat-bands with representa
tions of gold coins come under this head.
Not lone; ago a large number of soda
water checks resembling nickel pieces
were seized in Chicago. â New York Sun.
SOME PBOHTABLE HISTOBIES.
The Kecprd Made by Macaulay Still
Unbroken in England or America.
There were published in this cquntry
last year 185 historical works, eight of
them being new editions of works before
published and 129 being by American
authors. Publishers are shy of a new his
torian, and his manuscript is not accepted
without strong commendation from ex
perts especially employed to pass upon it.
Doubtless many of last year's historical
works were published with the financial
aid of the authors. Nevertheless a pub
lisher is glad to have on his list a success
ful historical work covering a peculiar
field. Sucn a work is not likely to have
an immediate sale approaching that of a
popular novel, but the sale of the latter
may cease at the ena of three months,
wi-ile the sale of the other may continue
for a quarter of a century or more. The
prospective profit to a publisher is greater
in the case of a standard history than in
that of a popular novel, unless .the latter
be of an unusually high order.
Macaulay's History was perhaps the
first historical work in the English tongue
to have an enormous popular success, its
sale in the first year of publication has not
since been surpassed by that of any his
torical work, and the check for Â£20,000.
paid to Macaulay by his publishers, was
the largest single check paid to an author
for literary work until the payment made
for General Grant's Memoirs. The sale of
Macaulay's work in this country was very
great, asit soon appeared in several edi
tions. The work is still selling well in
both Great Britain and the United States.
Two or three of Macaulay's British suc
cessors have had great success both in this
country and at home. Green's "Short
History of the English People" has al
most rivaled Macaulay's history in popu
larity, and, indeed, may yet outsell it. It
bus been made a school textbook in Great
Britain and the United States,. and this
has enormously increased its sale. Some
of the dry summaries that pass for school
histories have sold by hundreds of thou
sands, but they are hardly to be considered
in any discussion of the popularity of his
tory of literature.
Green's longer work also has sold widely
on both sides of the Atlantic, and now tbe
elaborately illustrated four-volume edition
of the "bhort History" is having a re
markable sale for so expensive a book.
Green's success is the more striking in
that his work goes over ground that hud
already been covered in works of moderate
size by others, and is a signal instance of
ihe value that style may give to a popular
history. Froude s "History of England,"
although it extends to many volume's,
speedily hs.d a large sale on both sides of
the Atlantic, and is still selling, although
the method of the author has been as
sailed bitterly.
Freeman, who would not have cared to
be called a rival of Froude, has not had
his popular success either at home or in
America, although the i: Norman Con
quest," standing alone as it does, has sold
well in both countries. Lecky has had a
good sale on this side as well "as at home,
but Sir Henry Maine and other specialists
in history have never become really popu
lar. McCarthy's "History of Our Own
Times," a strictly popular woric, has had a
great sale in one authorized and many
private editions on this side. Had inter
national copyright been an accomplished
fact before the publication of McCarthy's
work the author would have been some
thousands of dollars better off. Bryce's
"American Commonwealth," which is, of
course, descriptive and philosophical
rather than historical, has had a large
sale here and abroad, and is a very valu
able property to both author and pub
lisher.
Prescott has had a greater popular suc
cess than any other American historian, not
even excepting Motley. His works are
still selling in large numbers. Bancroft,
although of wide repute, was never really
popular, and tt.e aggregate sale of his his
tory in the last forty-five years has been
probably much smaller than his readers
suppose. Motley had a quick success with
his Dutch histories, and they are still in
ready demand, as they have been from the
time of their publication.
Parkman's popularity has greatly in
crease i within the past twenty years. His
first work, "The Oregon Trail. 1 ' published
nearly fifty years ago, was so successful
that lie published nothing else for fifteen
years. Though it stands apart from his
other works, it has come to share iheir
popularity. The book was written as the
result of a hunting trip to the far North
west, and was not a part of any historic
plan. His works in twelve volumes are
now selling freely throughout this coun
try and in Canada.
McMaster's first volume attracted much
attention and had a good sale. The long
delay between the appearance of the first
and the second volume injured the sale of
the work as a whole. The fact is that Mr.
McMaster lost the manuscript of his sec
ond volume on a railway train, and the
publication of the volume was delayed
while he rewrote it. Of more recent his
tories that of J. F. Rhodes and Campbell's
"The Puritan in Holland, England and
America" have had unusual success for
historical works of their length. All of
John Fiske's historical works have had a
large sale, and the "Critical Period of
American History" is one of the greatest
popular successes in American 1 iteratnre.
His works as a whole are an extremely
handsome property to the publisher, and
he is one oi the few historians who may
count upon a larse sale for any work that
he may write. The constitutional history
of Yon Hoist, now at length seemingly
finished, has sold largely for so long and
serious a work.
All things considered, the best known
modern historians, both British and
American, have found their work profita
ble, though probably none on either side
of the Atlantic has received nearly so
much for a single work as Macaulay. Per
haps the pecuniary value of historical
writing cannot be better illustrated than
by the fact that the worts, largely his
torical, of a deceased American author,
although the copyrights have all expired,
are still esteemed by his publishers the
most profitable books on their list.
KING PKEMPEH'S JEWELS.
Their Arrival in London â Value Placed
at About SIO.OOO.
Some days aeo Sir Francis Scott depos
ited at the offices of the crown agents for
the colonies such of the gold and jewels
belonging to King Prempeli as the British
were able to lay tiands upon ana to bring
to this country in respect of the war in
demnity due from As**Â«e* in connection
with the recent and forays.- expedition to
Coomassie. These jewels were kept under
lock and key until yesterday afternoon,
when they were laid out on a large table
in the office for the inspection of Mr.
Chamberlain and the heads of the
various departments of the Colonial
Office. Sir Montagu Onimanney, Senior
crown agent for the colonies, informed
press representatives that, including some
bags of gold dust which formed part of the
consignment, he did not think the in
trinsic value of the property would exceed
Â£2000, but of course, rare and curious ex
amples of barbaric skill and splendor often
had a value of their own far in excess of
that indicated by the weight of the precious
metal of which they were composed. The
whole collection, however, was far smaller
than that brought home after the Ashantee
war, some specimens of which were to be
found at the Imperial Institute and British
Museum, while other articles were dis
posed of to dealers in curiosities, and the
residue of ornaments went to the snielt
ini;-pot.
It was. said the crown agent, a notable
fact that, whereas the former jewels were
all of sol id Heavy gold, those brought home
as tne result of the more recent expedition
were mostly hollow aud consequently
less valnable, although composed of the
purest gold. The most striking feature
of the collection is a crown, probably that
worn by the monarch. The body of the
crown ig made of antelope skin and the in
ner lining is of coarse yellow silk or plush,
On each side is a lapel apparently in
tended to meet below the chin and fasten
there. The ornaments upon this curious
headdress are of pure soft gold, and they
comprise representations of human heads,
jawbones and lions, the whole being sur
mounted by two goats' horns of
cold. Much of the treasure con
sists of component parts of neck
laces, waistbands, etc., but Sir Mon
tagu called special attention to what is
presumed to be the badge of office of the
public executioner of Coomassie. At the
top and bottom of this strange ornament
are representations of human bodies with
out heads, and in the center is the execu
tioner with his drawn sword or execution
knife in his hand. All these figures are of
gold, and the badge, which is of hide, is
provided with strings by which it is fast
ened upon the breast. There is also an
execution knife or sword, slightly curved.
With its cutting edge on the inside. The
weapon appeals to have done much ser
vice. The handle, like most of the swords
and knives in the collection, is clothed
with leopard skin and terminates in a
huge golden ball. After inspection by Mr.
Chamberlain and other privileged persons
the valuables were again locked up to await
decision as to their disposal. â London

It is now clear that a genuinely protec

From all reports the festival counties are

The Senate has reduced the House ap

A free harbor at Los Angeles would be a

As the West stands firmly for protection

Mr. Huntington's re-election as presi

There seem to be a few self-styled Re

Republican protection.
Senator Turpie raises the curious objec
tion to the Cuban resolutions that while
they speak of intervention they do not say
on which side the United States should in
tervene. But how could it be an interven
tiou if it were ou one side?
SENATOE MANTLE'S SPEECH.
While the speech of Senator Lee Mantle
will hardly have the effect of causing any
further attempt at the enactment of tariff
legislation at this session of Congress, it
has at any rate served the good purpose
of making clear to Eastern men the atti
tude of Western Republicans on the allied
subjects of protection and bimetallism.
It shows, moreover, that the Western
Senators who voted against the Dingley
tariff bill did so not because of any lack of
devotion to the principle of protection,
but, on the contrary, because they were
too loyal to that principle to accept the
compromise offered them.
The Republicans of the West advocate a
3ystem of governmental protection to
American interests that will be sufficiently
comprehensive to include them all. They
demand the fostering aid of the Nation for
mining and for shipping as well as for
factories. They de&ire to see the silver in
dustry promoted and our merchant marine
built up as well as any other department
of American labor. In carrying out this
desire they do not intend to favor the in
terests of one section of the Union to the
exclusion of those of another, but to ade
quately and impartially foster them all.
The support given by Western Re
publicans to the silver industry is in no
sense antagonistic to the protection of
Eastern factories. It is, in fact, distinctly
friendly to such protection. As Senator
Mantle well said in the course of his argu
ment, without bimetallism no protective
tariff short of an absolute prohibition of
foreign imports cau sufficiently guard the
industries and the welfare of the working
men of this country against the competi
tion that is coming from China and Japan.
In addition, therefore, to the fact that the
silver-mining industry has aa just a claim
for favorable legislation from the Govern
ment as any other industry, there is the
furtner argument to be urged for it that
only tnrough the renionetization of silver
can we hope for the protection of any of
our greater industries at all.
The Republicans of the West are not
fanatics on the subject of silver. They
ask for that great industry, however, a
rightful treatment at the "hands of the
Government. They do not set up bi
metallism against protection, as was
charged by some of the goldbug papers,
but for protection. Their platform of poli
cies is for an American system comprehen
sive enough to include the interests of all
Americans, one that, will serve to promote
the welfare of the Nation by advancing
the industries of every class of workers
whether on farms or factories or mines, or
in ships upon the sea.
A HAEBOB OF EEFUGE.
Captain C. F. Swan, master of the bark
Theobald, nas published in The Call
some eminently sensible cugsestions
affecting the proposition of improving a
harbor in the southern part of the State.
After pointing out the dangerous nature
of the coast of California, the scarcity of
harbors, the inshore storms of winter and
the great difficulty of sending assistance
through the breakers in the event of dis
tress or disaster, he says that there is need
of a harbor of refuge into which passing
vessels may put when disabled or threat
ened by storms. Such a harbor should be
in a place where the danger of approach
ing it is no greater than that of the place
in which the vessel may be. For this
reason he thinks that San Pedro Is prefer
able to Santa Monica, by reason of the
nature of its bottom, an outside protecting
reef and the effect of the coast islands in
breaking the force of heavy seas.
He makes another suggestion that is
new and very valuable. It is that in an
open roadstead like that at Santa Monica,
with a beach and bottom of a quicksand
character and with no channel for confin
ing the flow of the tides, there will be an
absence of the scouring effect of the tides
in maintaining the original depth, and
the ground swell will inevitably bank the
sand against both sides of the proposed
breakwater, transforming it into a penin
sula and constantly tending to filJ up the
protectpd area. All these matters seem
perfectly reasonable, though whether this
practical navigator knows of instances
where this has already occurred he does
not say. The suggestion certainly invites
attention.
However, the whole question probably
resolves itself into that of Mr. Hunting
ton's influence in Congress as weighed
against that of all the other considerations
in the matter. An exactly similar state of
affairs exists with regard to the funding
bill, and we have seen that thus far Mr.
Huntington's private interests have had a
powerful influence. Neither that ques
tion nor the one of an appropriation for
San Pedro has been finally settled, and
the railroad's power in Congress may
not in the end prove as strong as it
looks. There is ground for hope so long
as the people of California make an earnest
stand in defense of the right and of the
conditions under which their prosperity
and progress aie possible.
TRITE BUT TIMELY WOBDS.
Timely and well worth heed are the
words uttered by C. N. Holden of Chicago,
a large handler of California fruit. The
point he makes is not a new one, but it
carries weight by reason of its source. Mr.
Holden is in California to ascertain the
condition of the fruit crop. Speaking of
the fruit industry lie said :
"It is a fact that to-day really fine
canned fruit is unobtainable at first hands,
while poorer goods are a drug. Great care
means a smaller product, greatly increased
consumption, and consequently higher
prices. Those canners who have devoted
their attention to the production of fine
goods are prosperous as a rule, while the
failures in every instance of which I am
aware have been those who made quantity
the object and not quality. This is equally
true of dried fruit."
It requires some courage for the grower
to deliberately thin out the promising
fruit on his trees in order to make that re
maining of more value, but it is only
more general adoption of the policy of
improving the fruit that will enable the
grower to retain and extend his market.
It is not alto gether a matter of obtain ine
a good price to-day. By careful attention
to the cultivation, preparation nnd pack
ing of orchard products not only are bet
ter returns assured to all concerned but a
prestige is acquired that grows more and
more valuable with each succeeding sea
son.
Where competition has to be met
this is no inconsiderable factor. There is
no valid reason why preserved fruits,
jams, jellies, etc., from Europe should
command higher prices and be in greater
demand among the class of people who
can afford to indulge in luxuries than
similar poods produced within our State.
The quality of the imported article can
certainly be matched if not excelled by the
native product. The fault then must lie
simply in the lack of proper careâ first in
cultivating, then in preparing and finally
in packing. All these are matters easy of
remedy, only requiring the application of
intelligence.
Mr. Holden's criticism has been made
at gatherings of organized fruit men ; but,
as a prophet is said to hayÂ© no honor in
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1896.
his own country, so their words of advice
and warning have not been heeded to the
extent they deserved. Coming now from
one who is in position to talk with au
thority and to emphasize his words by
withholding his coin, the suggestion will
probably be more generally taken to heart
and acted upon.
A SINGULAE ACCIDENT.
The reputation for security against
storms which the harbor of San Francisco
has always borne might suffer from the
extraordinary catastrophe which occurred
on Thursday unless a thorough under
standing of the circumstances is acquired.
A stanch sailing vessel of the latest type
and made of steel capsized in the safest
part of the bay, with a number of tugs
close at hand and while lying at anchor.
So strange a coincidence of bo many cir
cumstances bringing on the disaster will
likely never occur again, as they have
never occurred in this busy port before.
The whole story i 3 this: The ship was
lying in very light earth ballast undergo
ing a cleaning. A eharp squall sprang up
from the southwest at an hour when a
heavy flood tide was running, and as the
wind and tide were counter they caught
the ship between them. Besides being in
very light ballast the vessel carried an un
usually heavy load of spars aloft. While
the wind was bearing down upon these on
one side the tide was urged against the
hull on the other. The anchors did the
rest. The ship capsized and six men at
work in the hold were drowned.
Apparently the danger was evident to
all who saw the vessel except those on
board. A tugboat ran up and proffered
assistance, but that was declined. The
captain waa an experienced sailor and
knew the harbor to be safe. The only er
rorâone that many a sailor might have
committedâ was in failing to taKe into ac
count all thecircunistances at work. These
were the light ballast, the heavy load aloft
and the combined action of the wind and
tide. The extraordinary feature of the
disaster is that all these factors should
have been present at once. Even as it was
the accident was not necessary. The bay
was full of shins and not another suffered
the slightest damage or ran the least dan
ger. Not even an anchor was dragged.
The squall was by no means a storm. The
accident in no sense indicates any insecur
ity of the harbor.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
"While boasting is not a part of The
Call's policy or an element of its success,
the paper has so deep an interest in the
welfare of California that it feels justified
in calling especial attention to its Sunday
editions, believing that their usefulness in
assisting its desire to make the State bet-
ter known, both to its residents and to
strangers, will be duly appreciated. The
Sunday edition of a great daily newspaper
must contain many things of universal
interest, as distinguished from affairs of
local importance, in order that its readers
may find everything essential to a com
plete understanding of the great busy
world of which we are a part. This idea
is regarded in those departments of The
Sunday Call which deal with literature,
science, art, fashions and the broad in
terests which concern all the centers of
world-building activity.
But California is aiways kept in mind.
It is the must various and interesting sub
ject that human intelligence can treat.
What more eloquent topic could be imag
ined than one that involves the prosperity
and happiness of thousands, even though
it may look commonplace in print? And
yet in to-morrow's issue of The Call there
will appear an article on the cultivation
of the sugar beet in California and the
possibilities residing in the industry. A
proper understanding of it would promote
human happiness infiniteiy more than
could soms transient novel that has caught
the popular fancy.
There is to be another story about the
boring of wells in Californiaâ dull to
mention, but eloquent in its promises,
seeine; that the ground upon which we
walk has yielded so rich treasures in the
past.
There are other things of that kind, but
for those of divergent tastes feasts in
variety are spread. For instance, a won
derful man who has descended upon us,
Naphtaly Herz Imber, Hebrew poet and
mystic, sounder of the secrets of the
Cabbala, is to be discussed with a thorough-
nees not common hereabout.
Adeline Knapp will present an inter
esting phase of wnat is known as
animal instinct. Euphemia Burton will
have something to say about the inti
mate liie of interior Japan. W. C.
Morrow, inspired by the picturesque
attitude of a distinguished millionaire
recently a visitor here, will have something
that may prove interesting to people who
do not like to be interviewed. An un
commonly strong chanter of history in
which we are all interested will be told in
an article entitled "A Sea Fighter."
This ought to be sufficient as an indica
tion of what may be expected in to-mor
row's Call. Of course a great many
Eastern people might like to read the
paper, but it ; s difficult to see how they
can be accommodated unless their friends
in California send it to them.
THE WCfoL INDUSTBY.
"T. M.," a correspondent writing from
this City, asks The Call what effect the
removal of the tariff on wool has had on
the industry of this country and whether
England has benefited. The question an-
Bvrew itself. In order to realize that the
wool industry must have suffered one has
only to observe the extremely low prices
at which woolen goods are selling, and to
reflect that the difference between present
prices and those formerly ruling is much
greater than the profit which American
wool producers and manufacturers were
enjoying before the tariff on wool was
abolished. If that argument should not
appear self-evident it may be reflected
that under a free tariff the low wages of
England are the factor determining the
present prices in tnis country, and that
these wages are insufficient for American
operatives. They can fare better as com
mon laborers, for laborers receive better
wages in this country than skilled opera
tives iD England.
In addition to these manifest principles
there are concrete facts showing them to
be true. These are so numerous that it is
impossible to present them all. Let us
take the case of the Angora woolen and
cotton manufacturing concern of Phila
delphia, which recently suspended opera
tions. It was givine employment to 400
operatives, and has been a feature of Phil
adelphia for forty years. The repeal of
the McKinley law threw the proprietors
into straits, as they could not offer, nor
could their operatives accept, the low
wages paid in England. The owners
struggled manfully, hoping for the repeal
of the free-trÃde law and the imposition of
a reasonable tariff. At last they were com
pelled to succumb, and this deprived some
2000 persons of a livelihood.
One of the managers of the mills gave
this explanation: "Ever since the repeal
of the McKinley tariff we have been strug
gling against fate. The enormous importa
tions of foreign woolen goods under the
reduced tariff has not only compelled us
meantime to reduce wages, but to sell our
goods at such ruinously low prices that we
have run at a loss and been unable to
maintain our business. We have tried
hard to keep it for the benefit of our em
ployes and their families in tne hope that
we should pull through until a Republican
tariff should be restored, but we have been
unable to do this, even at great personal
sacrifice, and nothing remains but a neces
sity for suspension."
This is only one of numerous instances.
The Philadelphia concern was one of the
oldest and soundest in the country, and
hence its suspension is exceptionally sig
nificant. The wonder is that any woolen
mills aro still running or that any wool is
produced in the United States. The ex
planation of the fact that all of t! em have
not suspended is the vast amount of capi
tal invested in the industry and the hope
that the Republicans will impose a pro
tective duty. It is cheaper to run at a
loss for a time than to sacrifice all this
capital by abandoning the industry.
Of course England has profited in exact
proportion to our loss. Thus the profits
of Lister & Co., proprietors of the Maning
ham Mills, Bradford, England, were $75,
--115 in 1894, when there was a tariff on
wool, and $366,910 in 1895, after the tariff
bad been removed. Another Bradford
company, that of A. S. Henry & Co., lim
ited, had a profit of $319,550* in 1894 and
of $478,540 in 1895. All other English
manufacturers taking American orders
prospered similarly. Bradford sent us $6,
--577,675 more of woolen coatings alone in
1895 than in 1894, and of all goods $20^000,
--000 more, showing that we have suffered
and England has gained in proportion to
the reductions which we made in our tariff
charges. As the tariff was entirely re
moved from wool our loss and England's
gain in that item is nearly one-third of
the whole.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Colonel J. J. Nunan, the journalist, of Stock
ton, one of the proprietors of the Stockton
Mail, was among the conspicuous figures in
the corridors of the Occidental yesterday. It
is almost sixteen years since Colonel Nunan
and E. L. Colnon, now president of the State
Harbor Commission, founded the Mail. Mr.
Colnon- had been a newspaper man in Nevada.
ColoJiel Nunan had been in California for nine
years, but had not engaged in journalism here.
The paper went right along, and almost from
the start was a success. It killed off the Her
ald, the rival paper, which had run for twen
ty-five years. One of its features was the' spicy
"Undertaker" letters from San Francisco,
which appeared for a long time exclusively in
the Mail. John Paul' Cosgrove, the widely
known writer, now of The Call, was for nearly
three years owner of a third interest in it with
Messrs. Nunan and Colnon. He came in three

Mail.
[Sketched from life by Partinglon.]
months after it started, and for the entire time
he was there did the whole of the local wort.
He sold out to go elsewhere.
The Mail hus had such a lusty growth that
now two Mergenthaler type-setting machines
are necessary, and have been ordered. They
are expected to be delivered April 17. The
paper is also to have a complete new dress, and
will be enlarged, and otherwise improved. It
will come out in its new form about May 1.
Colonel Nunan talKed about Stockton yester
day, of which city he is an earnest and en
thusiastic advocate. He says it is in a very
steady and financially solid condition in every
way, and as for the region about it, that is in
the best possible shape.
"The census of 1890," said the colonel,
showed that Stockton had 14.500 people, but
ihisdidnot include the additions. We esti
mate now that with the additions we have
from 18,000 to 20,000 as a population. Busi
ness there is very fair, and the feeling is hope
ful. Nothing retards Stockton but the finan
cial condition which is general. But the city
is in the center of a great grain and fruit coun
try. The wheat crop, as nearly everybody is
aware, is enormous. The large mills there are
going all the time, and a large amount of
flour is sent steadily to Chrsa and elsewhere.
"Crop prospects in San Joaquin Count:: were
never so gooa. The rains have fallen just when
we needed them. There have been twelve in
all this winter.
"As for the Corral Hollow Railroad, it is now
about completed. The cars are there, and I
expect to see the track In shape and trains run
ning in about six weeks. The coal will come
in then, and I Jook for it to be of great value to
Stockton. It can be delivered so cheaply that
it will be an inducement to other manufactur
ers to locate there. It is a question whether
electricity can compete with it. It will be a
good, cheap coal, and can be had there for
$2 50 a ton. It will be an important epoch in
Stockton's history when this twenty-six miles
of the Corral Hollow road is finished. We will
then have two roads and be in a condition to
advance more rapidly than before."
Colonel Nunan left for his home in San Joa
quin last night.
A REIGN OF TERROR.
'there is horror too prolific In the jargon scien
tific wh'cn disturbs the mood pacific
Of thÂ« ordinary rnau.
In these awful tales that thrill us of a bugaboo
bacillus that is biding near to kill us,
It' by any chance it can.
Not a slnxlo chance It misses; it is lurking in our
blisses: it is even in the kisses
That delight a leap year dream.
In the air are microbes floating; in the wa'.er they
are gloating, fiendish vigilance devoting
To their weird, malicious scheme.
Oh, ye philosophic sages, we were happy all these
ages while itaese animals ouirageons
Unsuspected flourished here;
And although just for the present we withstand
their siege incessant we run other risks
unpleasant,
For we're almost dead with fear.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Polltaxâ 3sÃ4â J. S., City. The law passed
at the last session of the Legislature says that
the polltax must be collected between the first
Monday in March and the first Monday in De
cember. The Assessor claims the right to gar
nishee a man's wages if ho does not pay on de
mand at the time he makes the demand.
Homestead Dechkationâ J. D., City. If a
husbimd makes a gift of a piece of property to
his wife, it becomes her separate property.
The law of this State on the subject of home
steads says:
The homestead cannot be aelected from the
separate properly of the wife Without her coiiseut.
shown by tier making the declaration of home
stead.
In order to select a homestead the husband or
other bead of a family, or in caae the husband has
not made such selection, the wife must execute
and acknowledge, in the same manner as a grant
of real estate is acknowledged, a declaration of
homestead, mid fi e the same for record.
A homfstcHii ca^ be abandoned only by a declar
ation o f abai.doiiuentor a grant thereof, executed
and acknoui. d .id by the huaDand and wife if the
claimant is married.
What the effect of the application of the law
to certain facts would be is a matter that you
will have to consult an attorney about, as your
question asks for a legal opinion, which this
department does not give.
Thomas Paine's Remainsâ A. S., Jamestown,
Tuolumne County, Cal. Thomas Paine, the
author famous for his counectiou with the
American and French revolutions, died in New
Rochelle, N. V., June 8, 1809, and was to have
been buried iv a Quaker cemetery according
to his wish, but, the Quakers objecting, his re
mains were buried on his farm in New Ko
chelle. In 1819 William Cobbett, the English
radical, an admirer of Paiae, violated the
grave and took the bones to Liverpool. His
reason for this act was that he believed that
the republican notions be had would be
fostered thereby, but in that he was mistaken.
Ou the occasion of the removal of the bones
Byron wrote:
In digging up your bones, Tom Paine,
Will Cobbeti has done well;
He visited you on earth again;
You'll visit him in .
Historians disagree as to what finally was
done with the bones of Paine. One says that
they were reinterred in Liverpool, another
says that they remained in the custody of Cob
bett until his death and then passed into the
possession of his son, who retained them until
lS3t>, when he went into bankruptcy and the
bones were seized for debt and that in 184.4
they were in the charge of a Mr. Til'y ; another
says that they' were removed to France and
that they are now under the soil. In 1829 a
monument to the memory of Paine was erected
at New Rochelle, within a few feet of where
his remains were first buried.

The end came in this City yesterday
THE LATE GOVERNOR JOHN E. JOKES OF NEVADA.
afternoon at 5:30 o'clock, and was not un
expected. For days he had been hovering
on the border of the great beyond, and at
the last the final transition was as cairn
and peaceful as a pleasant dream.
Mrs. Jones was with her husband to the
very end. and. save her brother, Thomai
Weybun, was the only member of the Gov
ernor's family present during the last
hours.
Some months ago Governor Jones was
attacked with a disease which competent
physicians pronounced cancer of the
stomach. On the advice of friends he
came to San ' Francisco, consulting the
most eminent practitioners in the City.
They afforded him only temporary relief,
candidly admitting that his death was
only a question of days.
One day. about three months ago, Mrs. '
Dr. Cook called on the Governor at the
Paia:e Hotel and asked permission to ;
prescribe for the then dying man. She
did, and for a time her efforts seemed to
meet with success. Governor Jones so far
recovered as to be able to waik a consider
able distance. The attending physician
suggested to Mrs Jones that she secure a
auiet place, and. acting on this advice,
the upper flat at 607 Guerrero street was
secured.
For weeks the Governor continued to
improve, so far as outward appearances
went. Three weeks ago. however, he suf
fered a relapse, resulting finally in his
death, as already stated.
Governor John E. Jones was born in
Wales. December 5, 1840. He immigrated
to the United States with his parents ami
settled in lowa in 1856. He was educated
in the public schools, completing his edu
cation with a four years' course in the
lowa State University. In hiu early man
hood he was engaged in school teaching in
his adopted State. He came to this coast
in 1869. in company with Henry Hiip of
this City.
He went to the Eureka mining district
of Nevada shortly afterward and soon be
came popular among his fellow- miners of
that locality. He was president ot the
Ruby Kill Miners' Union for several years.
He amassed a fair fortune in mining prop
erty ar.d lands, most of his interests being
in the Eureka district, although he owned
iands in Carson Valley, Nev., and in South
ern Utah. In 1886 he "was elected Surveyor-
General and State Registrar of Lands on
the Republican ticket, and four years later
was re-elected to the same office. He left
the Republican for the Silver party during
his last term as Surveyor-General, and in
recognition of that act the party with
which be affiliated elected him Governor
in 1894.
He was a Knight Templar and of the !
enviable thirty-second degree in the Ma- j
sonic order. At one time he was grand ;
master of that order in Nevada. For the!
last ten years he resided in Carson City, j
Previous to that time he lived at Eureka. !
He was engaged in mining in Wyoming i
and Colorado for a short time before com- j
ing to the coast.
Speaking of him yesterday a prominent \
Nevadan said: "He was true to every offi- i
cial trust or we would not have repeatedly I
bestowed upon him the elective honors we
did. He had a large personal following in ,
friends who knew his true worth."
The remains ot the late Governor will- be
carried to Nevada for interment to-mor- !
row.
Late last evening Governor Budd sent
the following dispatch to Colonel F. S.
Chadbourne, paymaster-general :
Just received news of the death of Governor
John E. Jones of Nevada. Please convey my
sympathy and condolence to the family in
behalf of the people of the State of California.
Render them every assistance. J. H. Budd.

CARSON. Nev., April 10.â Governor
Jones' death was taken with universal

THE BLIND PRIMA DONNA
M'ss Belinfante Makes Her
Debut at the Audi
torium.
Warm Applause Given by a Critical
Audienceâ An Aria From
"Carmen."
The audience which assembled Thursday
night at the Auditorium to hear Signorina
Estrela Belinfante and Anton Schott, was
more enthusiastic than numerous. Among
those present were a number of Italian
and German residents.
The Signorina is a slim, graceful girl,
who looks almost too fragile to be the
possessor of such a big voice as she
possesses.
Her blindness is not very apparent, as
, she has pretty dark eyes, which give no
outward indications of her inrirmity, but
; she is evidently unable to see her way
about the platform, and as she indulges in
; a good deal of dramatic gesture, there were
moments when the people in the front
rows trembled for fear she should take one
: step too many forward.
j John Marquardt, who played the violin
! obligato to her first song, "watched her
with evident anxiety, but the young lady
i was very sure of herself and managed to
move about gracefully, as well as safely.
Miss Beiinfante'a voice is of the mezzo
! soprano contralto quality, which would tit
j her to sing such roles as Carmen, Azu
] cena or Orpheus in Gluck's "Orfeo."
She has considerable power and a good
1 compass and some of her tones are excep
tionally sweet, rich and ringing. The
; contralto tones of her chest register are
deep and full without being sepulchral,
; though if she continues to bring this pro
; duction into her lower middle register she
I will eventually impair her fine upper notes.
The young contralto sings equally well
i in English and Italian, and her cnuncia
; tion in both languages is reraarkablv clear
and good. She sang the ''L'amour e'est
i un oiseau," f'om "Carmen," id Italian
J with a chic and dash and aggressive impu
j de nee which showed that she has the voca-
I tion to act as well as to sing Bizet's
j heroine if she were not debarred from stage
worK by her blindness.
Miss Belinfante's voice shows to best
i advantage in operatic music. She gave an
; interesting and dramatic rendering of the
I "Che Faro?" from Gluck's "Orfeo," and
j she preceded the aria by the beautiful
! and difficult recitation, which is too often
j omitted. Another of Miss Belinfante's
i nuniDers was Papinis "Elaine," and she
I sang "Daddy' 1 prettily as an encore.
There was a great deal of enthusiasm
shown by the public for the blind singer,
[ and sue received numerous floral tributes.'
Anton Schott was in eood voice, and
| â worked hard to make the evenine a suc
i c^ss. In Beetnoven's "Die Himmel
I Ruehrnen' 1 he sang with great dramatic
J effect and a magnificent volume of voice,
j his rendition of "Lohengrin's Narration' 1
j and "Lohengrin's Farewell" also brought
, him loud applause and "bravos."
"The Three Student"*," by Speyer, is a
| good old German drinking song, "in which
! Schott was quite at home. He also gave a
1 couple of Schumann nonss and Starck's
I 'â¢Rheinlied." as well as several encores.
Arthur Fickenscber, the pianist, played
i several selections, including works "by
[ Delibes and Chopin.
The second concert by the above artists
I will be given to-morrow afternoon at the
I Auditorium.
Kinil Beck Sentenced.
Emil Beck, convicted of obtaining money
under false pretenses, was sentenced to seven
years' imprisonment by Judge Wallace yester
day. Beck whs the young man who repre
sented himself as the advance agent of the
Stanford Glee Club, and who victimized a
nnmber of people inconsequence. There were
three charges agaiust him.
INDIGNANT DEPOSITORS.
People's Home Savings Bank
Directors Are De
nounced.
THREATS OF SHOOTING MADE.
VViliam Encke Wants to Get the
Directors Together and Fill
Them With L-ad.
"William Encke made a highly incen
diary speech last night at the meeting of
the depositors of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank.
Several speakers had preceded him with
remarks as to the hopelessness of obtain
ing their money by legal means, and oth
ers had suggested that the Prosecuting At
torneys, Judges and others whom tney be
lieved to have assisted the directors and
stockholders, should be boycotted at the
polls next fall.
Before the applause which greeted those
expressions had subsided Mr. Encke, a
short, thickset mau with a broad accent,
arose and said :
"We can't get anything out of those
directors unless we take the law in onr
own hands. The thing to do is to wait till
the directors are all together and then
give them some lead. If a man tries to
break into my house and rob me I have a
right to take my Distol and shoot him."
F. H. Quahiman, in the chair, said that
the depositors had had three years in which
to do the cleaning out.
"I don't want any help," said Encke
cheerfully. "I only want to know who the
directors are by sight and I will do the
rest."
T. H. McCarthy expressed the hope that
the depositors would have patience and
wait until all legal means had been ex
hausted. Then they could assemble 3000
or 6000 persons and march to the Mills
building and see whether they would get
justice.
Several others expressed similar opinions
to that of Mr. Encke that force was the
alternative left them. The speeches were
of the hottest kind and charged Directors
Freeman, Thornton, Phelps and Taylor
with standing in with the stockholders for
the purpose of cheating the depositors out
of their money. Judge Hebbard, District
Attorney Barnes and others were blamed
for leniency toward R. H. McDonald Jr.
It was alleged that Prosecuting Attorney
Hinkle was incompetent and allowed the
defense to have their own way.
After a violent preamble scoring Direc
tors Phelps. Thornton, Freeman and Tav
tor for removing Mr. Flournoy from his
position as attorney of the bank, the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted:
Baeivcd, That if S. K. Thornton, W. H.
I'helps, E. M. Freeman and W. P. Taylor were
honorable men they would not ignore tne
petition of nearly 1300 depositors and repre
senting Â£1,000,000 in deposits when it was
filed with them requesting the retention of
Mr. Flournoy.
Resolved, That we will await with patience
the results of suits that are about to be com
menced by our assignee, the California Safe
Deposit and Trust Company, and if satisfaction
cannot be obtained and justice done us, we be
lieve that the 5000 depositors of this City
would be justified in assembling in a body and
dealing out summary justice to men who
are mismanaging and misappropriating our
money.
After passing another resolution re
questing the District Attorney and the
Bank Commissioners to do their duty, the
meeting adjourned subject to the call of
the chair.
SEEING IS BELIEVING.
Gratifying Success of the Plan to In
troduce the Encyclopaedic
Dictionary.
Nearly a month ago the Pacific Coast
Newspaper Syndicate, controlling the
new Encyclopaedic .Dictionary, in order
to introduce 'he work, wisely deter
mined to distribute a considerable
number of sets at a nominal price and
on easy terms, so that' it might be
widely compared with other reference
works and favorable publicity be thereby
obtained.
Those that have thus received the work
are convinced that the claims made for it
have been fully justified. They have
found that it is a complete dictionary,
containing accurate information regarding
the origin, history, spelling, definition,
pronunciation and use of every word in
the English language; that it is a com
prehensive encyclopedia in all branches of
knowledge; that it is a dictionary of nuo
tations from the entire range of English
literature, and that it is a scientific diction
ary, affording a wide range of information
on all technical subjects.
It contains many new words not found
in any other dictionary, but which, are, as
a matter of fact, the very ones regarding
which exact information is most necessary..
It is a standard of reference in schools,
colleges, universities, and among lawyers,
physicians, scientists, literary men, busi
ness men and all classes to whom exact
and exhaustive information about words
and things is a necessity.
All these points have naturally told
strongly in favor of the work, and it is,
therefore, small wonder that the supple
mental distribution, which began Monday
last and closes Saturday evening, should
have been so remarkably successful.
But the opportunity for securing a set at
the extremely low introductory price and
on the exceptionally easy terms of pay
ment will soon have passed, as Saturday
night, at 10 o'clock, is the hour fixed, and
after that the regular subscription price of
from $42 to $70 per set, according to biud
ing, will prevail.
Dr. Jordan on the Charter.
Professor David Starr Jordan, president of
the Stanford University, will deliver an ad
dress at Golden Gate Hall this evening upon
'â Centralization in Municipal Government
With Special Reference to the New Charter."
The board of director* of the Merchants' As
sociation has accepted the invitation to be
present at the meeting. The Merchants' Asso
ciation regards it as a favorable omen lor
future improvement of municipal government
that such a distinguished scholar consents to
give his opinions to the public witnout reser
vation.
An Able Argument.
In this week' 9 San Francisco News-Letter
i will be found a masterly article entitled "Fol
lies of the Funding Fight." which every one
; should read for the clear insight it gives intu
I a great question involving the future of Cali-
I fornia. The writer proves tnat it is to the in
terest of the people that the Government make
; easy terms with the railroad, because all the
money that must be paid it must neoes>arily
come out of our own pockets. Pleasure's Wand
j column contains a clever criticism ot Pudd'n

PRISON-MADE GOODS.
Unions of the Cpuncil to Make an In
vestigatiou of the Subject.
At the meeting of the Labor Council
last night a report was submitted showing
that the following named unions are in
favor of sustaining the Labor Council as
against the Central Labor Alliance re
cently organized by a convention of dele
gates from the various labor unions:
Sailors', Iron-molders", Horseshoers',
Cigar-maKers'. Electrical Workers', Theat
rical Employes', Coopers', Musicians',
Brewery Workmen, Bakers' and Pattern
makers'.
The Tailors' and Furniture-makers'
unions had not yet taken action, and the
Garment-makers' and Cooks and Waiters'
unions were reported to be not yet regu
larly affiliated with the council" though
they soon expect to be.
Reports from various unions were made,
showing their condition as favorable.
The following motion was adoped: That
the Labor Council is in favor of propor
tional representation, and that the legis
lative committee be instructed to present
a bill to the next Legislature amending
the constitution to provide for propor
tional representation.
On the report of the special committee
that prison-made barrels were being
shipped here from the East, a motion was
adopted instructing the committee to con
tinue its investigation and requesting the
delegates to lay the matter before their
respective unions for additional informa
tion, for the purpose of learning whether
any other prison-made goods were being
marketed here.
ROOFERS IN THE COUNCIL
An Important Addition to the
Strength of the Building
Trades.
Nothing to Suggest a Strike in Any
.Part of the Cityâ The Card
Works Well.
Among the building trades in this City
yesterday the indications were cot in any
particular indicative of a stnke. On every
hand mechanics were working away on
buildings, and it appeared round town
that San Francisco was receiving its cus
tomary spring painting. At the head
quarters of the building trade's, 115 Tnrk
street, but a handful of men could be seen,
and in fact the large hall was practically
abandoned at certain hours of the day.
For some reason the bone of conten
tion â the Emporium building on Market
street â received no thoueht from the
unions â for union men were at work there
as if nothing had happened, an under
standing having been reached over the
contracts that could not be annulled,
Indeed, it might be said that the strike
was at an end, and that the united car
penters, painters, etc., had gained their
point. They were as industrious as ever
earning their honest wages, but in & new
environment. Every man working with
them was a union man. He baa "the
card" in his pocket.
"Of course we had a few complaints
from jobs over the card," said J. Mc-
Cartney, chairman of the grievance com
mittee, "but they did not amount to any
thing, and we settled them easily."
Business Agent Saunders of the council
said he and Agent Mclvor had been "visit
ing among the buildings and were satis
fied at the condition of things everywhere.
He added that the master painters were
quietly unionizing their shops, and a good
feeling existed between employers and
men.
The Metal Roofers' Union met last night
at 115 Turk street and reorganized under
the auspices of the building trades coun
cil. E. T. MdTor, .T. McCartney and T. E.
Zandt, the councils committee on organi
zation, were present and explained the
card system in detail. This explanation
was so reasonable and ?o satisfactory that
seventy-three metal roofers signed the roll.
John T. McGrath was elected temporary
chairman, John P. McGowan temporary
secretary, Ike Winthrop ser<reant-at-arms.
I. Winthrop, Charles \N illi*, William
Taylor and B. Comeford were elected a
committee on reorganization.
M. Hughes, George Engler, P. McDon
ald and J. McGowan were chosen as the
committee on constitution and by-laws,
ami J. T. McGrath was added to each, ex
otiicio.
The union decided to go into permanent
organization next Tuesday evening at 115
Turk street, when it is expected that the
roll will be increased to 250. The old
union was a powerful labor organization
with considerable numerical strength, and
under the present very favorable condi
tions the new one may be still more influ
ential.
The revival of this union is import
ant, as it gives still another large body of
men to tiie building trades council and
consequently gives the council renewed
strength and confidence. It places the
council in a better position to enforce its
card throughout the <Mty.
The Shinglers' Union met at 115 Turk
street and sifter a long discussion con
cluded to affiliate with the council and so
to work under the card system. A com
mittee was appointed to present the matter
before the carpenters that an understand
ing might be reached between the two
bodies. Carpenters' Union 22 heard the
committee, but deferred action for a week.
A COSTLY TALISMAN.
Van de Vere, the Sorcerer, in Judge
Low's Court.
Professor Van de Vere was again on
trial yesterday before Police Judge Low
on a charge of grand larceny, the details
of which have already been published.
Vande Vere, the defendant, was in court,
of course, and at times broke into laughter
with the audience when the "rawness" of
his work was exposed.
Bell was on the stand during most of
the afternoon. He told the story of his
financial undoing from the time he paid
$25 for a talisman, the intrinsic value of
which does not amount to 25 cents, to the
times he gave up from $100 to $375 to Van
de Vere and Professor Eugene on their
claim that they would relieve him of all
evil influences".
More testimony of this nature is to De
heard and, although it has, up to date,
been shown that Bell voluntarily parted
with his money, and that his testimony is
to the effect that the alleged clairvoyants
fulfilled all their promises, it ia more than
likely Van de Vere will be held over to be
tried by a jury in the Superior Court.
Election of Sons of Hermann.
At the general meeting of the Ernst V.
Bandel Lodge or the order of the Sons of
Hermann last evening, the following officers
were elected and installed for the ensuing
term: President, C. Streu; vice-president,
Theo. Bchoefer; treasurer, G. Guenther; secre
tary, K. a. Konl, financial secretary, William
Zell; guide, C, F. W. Miller; inside watchman.
J. Hohn; outside watchman, C. Mevias;
surgeon, Dr. F. F. Lord; finance committeeâ
J. Stromberg, A. Weisman and P. Krueckel.
The representatives to the Grand Lodge, which
meets on the 11th of May at San Jose, are: G.
Guentber. A. Wiesman, J. Stromberg, V. Acker
and A. Stier.
Five Days in Jail for Contempt.
George Louis Ying, interpreter of the Oceanic
Steamship Company, was sent to jail for five
days by United States Judge Morrow yesterday,
for disobeying a subpena to testily before the
I'nited States Grand Jury in the matter of the

TOILERS SEEKING WAGES.
Laborers Claim That Jake Raver
Refuses to Pay What Is
Due Them.
J. S. Kimpiton, One of the Teamsters,
Makes a Statement at the
Labor Bureau.
The laborer Henshaw, mentioned in a
recent issue of The Call, is not, it ap
pears, the only sufferer by the McCoy
street-grading contract. J. S. Kimpston,a
teamster employed under the contract, has
a similar story to tell and a larger claim
to collect.
"When McCoy failed and assigned the
contract to J. J. Rauer/' said Kimpston,
"I was wording with two teams and a
hired man. This man was engaged by
me. and I have had to pay him. All I
owe him is $3. which he is sure of getting.
But Raver owes me $109, no part of which
has yet been paiÂ«i. I live by ray work,
and have a family of seven dependent upon
me for support, and a? everybody knows,
house rent and bills for provisions count
up rather steep when there's no money
coming in. Besides, I have four horses to
keep, and I cannot go on forever getting
their feed on credit.
"i know of six or seven men who have
not been able to collect money due them
for labor performed under this ill-starred
contract. In some instances the men were
induced to sign receipts in full before they
could eet a small portion of their wages.
These men, when they asked for their
money, were shown the receipts and de
fied to press their claims. Several of ua
intend to wait upon Jake Raver in a body
very soon, and perhaps his fear of being
put to public shame may induce him to
Dony up. lam myself in sad need of the
money owing to me, while some of the
others, lite Henshaw, are on the last ex
treme of destitution. It seems a shame
that men who have worked hard and tried
to serve their employers conscientiously
should be defrauded of their lawful pay.' 1
Oregon District Synod.
Rev. J. M. Buehler, paator of St. Paul's
Lutheran Church, corner of Eddy and Gough

California and Oregon District Synod to attend

HAYNE ATTACKS
THE LONG LEASE
And Produces Authorities
That Were Cited by the
Opposition.
THE LEASE IS VOID.
So Say Several Decisions of the
United States Supreme
Court.
REFERENCE TO A CEMETERY.
An 'nsinuation That Oce Is Necessary
to the Eusiness of Rail
roading.
Mr. Hayne began his argument for the
people yesterday morning in the Railroad
Commission case before Judge McKenna
in the United States Circuit Court. The
whole of the day was taken up with the
discussion of the validity of the lease of
the Central Pacific system to the Southern
PaciSic of Kentucky.
Mr. Hayne has a very aggravating
met l:od of arguing this case. It is not in
his manner, for Mr. Hayne is as suave a
gentleman as ever scuttled a fat fee or cut
the throat of the law to serve his client.
But it is in his method, which consists in
taking the authorities and cases cited by
the opposition in support of their case
and introducing them for the purpose of
showing that they support his case in
stead.
During the day Mr. Pillsbury did the
baiting for his colleagues, or rather he at
tempted to do so, for all his efforts were
tied with a string of rubber and jump.d
back to him, smiting him hip and thigh
with the Hayne retort, which is as cold
blooded as that charity which weeps, but
Which does not give.
Mr. Hayne will resume his argument
next Tuesday morning at half-past 10
o'clock, and it is expected that som* time
before the end of next week Mr. Garber,
whose tender is loaded with the best legal
coa;. will come looting down the track with
a full heed of steam on. and Coke and
Blackstone an-1 the Supreme Court of the
United States sitting on the cowcatcher.
Mr. Hayne cited authorities from United
States Reports to show that in cases of
douot respecting the rights and privileges
of railroad corporations the doubt is
always to be interpreted in favor of the
}>L-oi.ie and against the corporation. He
alto cited cases to establish the contention
tuat corporations cannot dispose of their
franchises by lease or otherwise without
legislative authority.
. The case of a Pennsylvania railroad com
pany against a St. Louis railroad company
in volume IS of the United States Supreme
Court Reports was cued. In that case the
court decided that a lease would be void
where the lessee had not received legisla
tive authority to enter into such a con- j
tract, even though the lessor had that au
thority by a statute. The Southern Pa- j
cine Company is unable to furnish any au
tnoiity [or leasing the Central Pacific, and
no application was ever made to Congress
to secure its consent to the lease of the
Central Pacific to the Southern Pacific.
The speaker denied that there existed or
had Listed an implied consent on the part
of Congress, or that this lease had been
made :vith implied consent. Several deci
sions were read to establish the contention
that in public grants nothing passes by
implication. He asked if the doubt is to
be resolved in favor of the Government in
one action why not resolve the doubt in
the same way in the other action 3.
Mr. Pi'lsbury interrupted by explaining
that when Congress passed the act of 18&*
it was a 1 vised of the situation of affairs.
Mr. Hayne quoted the law of Congress
in LBBB, whereby all railroad and telegraph
companies to which the United States has
grunted subsidies or any other assistance,
are required to maintain and operate the
railroads by themselves alone.
Mr. Pillsbury asked permission to ex
plain that the quoted section referred to
telegraph companies and not to railroad
companies.
This interpretation was stoutly com
bated by Mr. Hayne and the Attorney-
General. Mr. Hayne remarking that the
fact that such eminent gentlemen as Pills
bury, Herrin and Garber had advocated
that interpretation of the statute was an
indication of the dire extremity to which
they had been, driven in this case. He
added, commiseratingly : "See what a
doubtful abyss of conjecture the argument
of counsel requires them to go into. '
The speaker quoted from a United States
Snpreme Court decision to the effect that
the charter of a corporation defines ita
powers, . and the enumeration of those
powers operates to the exclusion of all
others. Another decision was to the effect
that though it might be fairly inferred
that the Legislature knew that the road
was operated under a lease it was not nec
essary to decide whether it was done for a
lawful purpose or not. The intention of
the law was that whoever did operate the
road and exercise its franchise was bound
by the rates of fares and freights estab
lished by the Commissioners. An Oregon
case was also cited at the request of Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald wherein the court
decided that legislative recognition of a
lease does not imply the power to grant
the lease.
"Wherever a contract is against public
policy it is void and unlawful," said Mr.
Hayne. "It is a taint, a poison, and no
court of equity will have anythi ng to do
with it."
The argument went on to establish from
opinions cited the contention that the
powers cf corporations organized by the
Legislative statutes aie such, and such
oniy, as those which the statutes confer.
Here Mr. Hayne entered upon the sec
ond point of his argumentâ the prohibi
tion directed against the Southern Pacific
Company by which it was not allowed to
do business in the State of Kentucky,
whicn gave it birth. He took up several
authorities which had been cited by Mr.
Pillsbury, and he argued that those" very
authorities were directly against the posi
tion taken by Mr. Pillsbury. It was also
argued that while a State may create a
corporation and authorize it to do business
in another State, yet if it introduces an act
prohibiting it from doing business in its
native State the principle of comity be
comes shut out and the other States may
say. "Nor shall you do any business in our
Btate."
fhe Southern Pacific Company was pro
hibited by its charter not from doing any
business, but from doing railroad business
in Kentucky. But that is the only busi
ness that the Southern Pacific Company
could do in California; hence it could not
legally do any business at all in this State.
Ms. Hayne asked Mr. Pillsbury whether
lie held that the charter of a foreign cor
poration was the measure of its powers in
a foreign country.
Mr. Pillsbury replied that a corporation
came into this State with its charter, like
a commission or a power of attorney, and
could do any bu-iness which its charter
authonzcJ.
Mr. Hayne said that a corporation
created for the purpose of railroading
could not go into the hospital ortheceme
tery business unless such were necessary
to the operation of its roads.
Mr. Pillsbnry suggested that Mr. Haven's
remark had been inspired by a spirit of
facetiousness, but the speaker replied that
he was soberly in earnest.
The hour of 4 v. m. having arrived Judge
McKenna, with a glance at the tired clock,
announced that Mr. Hayne might resume
his argument at 10:30 o'clock next Tues
day morning.
ADVANCES IN MEDICINE.
Interesting Lecture by Dr. Henry Gib
bong, Dean of Cooper College.
A large and appreciative audience
greeted Dr. Henry Gibbons, dean of
Cooper Medical College, at his lecture on
"Recent Advances in Medicine," given
last night in the college hall.
"We have now reached a point," he
said, "when it has almost ceased to be the
fashion to be skeptical. So many new in
ventions have in their wondrous results
surpassed all that the most fertile imagi
nation of past ages could conceive, that
now we are ready to believe almost any
thing in the way of scientific advance
ment."
The dean noted specifically some of the
recent discoveries which hud revolution
ized the practice of medicine. The dis
coveries of Koch and Pasteur were in
stanced as mere premonitory glimives of
greater things yet to come. The advance
in surgery was especially dwelt upon, the
value and erlicacv of antiseptic methods
being lucidly explained.
HOW TO KILL HORSES.
The Police Officer* Are Given a Le.iion
by Dr. Westphall.
Police Lieutenant George Birdsall sent
his squad of patrolmen out last evening to
be educated how to properly kill a horse
in the case of an emergency.
Surgeon Westphall of the Park-avenue
Hospital had a poor old mare on hand
that was about to die of disease and old
age, and, in accordance with a promise
made to Captain Wittman before the
lavter went East, the notice was sent in
yesterday. The fifty men in the squad
were lined up and the surgeon showed
them exactly the right spot into which to
tire the bullet so as to make a sure shot.
He hrst exhibited a bare skull of a horse
and drew a line across its face from the
lobes above the eyes and pointed out the
center of the line.
The old horse was then brought out and
Officer C. Coogan, better known as "The
Pride of Larkin street." was selected as
the executioner. He had profited well by
the lesson and dropped the horse the first
shot.

KLEISER RECITES.
A Clever Reader Apnears at the Asko-
elation Auditorium.
There was a large and appreciative audi
ence at Association Auditorium Thursday
night to hear Grenville Kleaser, reader
and impersonator, make bis debut in this
City.
Mr. Kleiser entertained and interested
bis audience the whole evening by his
clever recitations and impersonations.
He gave "Our American Cousin," im
personating all the different characters in
the Dlay, and he acted the various parts
with so much delicacy and expression
that people listened with almost as much
interest as if the play were beins acted.
Afterward the reciter gave a clever little
sketch of his own entitled "Matrimony,"
in which he depicted, largely by panto
mime, the roie of a disappointed suitor.
He also recited Eugene Field's "Father's
Way," and gave a burlesque of a boy's
way of reciting "Bingen on the Rhine.'
Oh, what a comfort Mitchell's Magic Lotion
is for bruises, piles, sore throat and
neuralgia. â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1896.
ANOTHER WEEK OF DELAY
The Fair Sisters Interpose Ob
jections to Paterson's
Contest.
THIS MUST NOW BE ARGUED.
Not Until Urn Will a Day Be
Fixed for the Trial of the
Big Will Case.
Yesterday morning at the last minute be
fore the matter came on for hearing before
Judge Slack legal documents in the Fair
will case were piled one upon another by
the various attorneys representing the
different interests.
Dr. Levingston, through his attorneys,
made answer ;o the contest filed on behalf
of Herman Oelrichs Jr. by ex- Judge Pat
erson ; also an answer to the contest hied
by Charles L. Fair.
A demurrer was filed by Mrs. Herman
Oelrichs and Miss Virginia Fair to the op
position of Judge Paterson to the second
will.
The vast army of lawyers were present
in court when the case was called, but for
the tirst time since these particular gath
erings of giants began George A. Knight
and CbariesHeggerty flocked by themselves
apart from the otners who represent the
heirs. There has been a division of the
family. The sisters do not aeree with the
brother in his contest.
The demurrer of the sisters to Judge
Paterson's contest was the one element
of surprise. None of the attorneys had
previous notice of it.
Judge Slack refused to fix a day for trial,
out until all the issues are joined he veld
the matter over until next Friday after
noon when he will hear arguments on the
demurrer. The answer of Pr. Levingston
to the contest of Charles L. Fair seta forth
the declaration made by Fair wnen he
brought the will forward that he believed
it to be the last and genuine will of James
The answer to ex-Judge Paterson simply
admitted his right to contest and joined
issues with him in the contest. It also en
tered a denial to ttie point set up by Judge
Paterson that there had ever been a re
publication of the will of the 21st.
The demurrer to Judge Paterson's con
test is a long document. It was hied by
Lloyd & Wood, as attorneys. It attacked
Judge Paterson's right or capacity to con
test. It was held that, as representing '.he
minor heirs. Judge Paterson has no stand
ing in this matter.
This demurrer will have to be disposed
of before the case can come to trial and
the joined issues of all parlies.
When the case was called by Judge
Siack S. M. Shortridge rose and adaressed
'"In view of thft chance of front or posi
tion of certain parties who have been per
mitted by the court to withdraw their
petition for the probate of the will of Sep
tember 24 and to file an opposition to it I
deem it proper now to inform the court
that Judge Paterson, who represents cer
tain minors alleged to be interested in the
will of Septemuer 21, has filed an amended
opposition to Dr. Levingston's petition for
the probate of the will of September
We have mado answer, and there is now a
clear-cut issue.
"Since the last hearing in this court a
certain petitioner for tlie probate of the
later will has been advised and has seen
I lit to withdraw and hie an opposition to
it. We have made answer in this also on
behalf of our client, Dr. Levingston, and
there is a clear issue here also.
"Mr. Fair, in his opposition, denies the
genuineness of the will, and has filed a
petition asking leave to withdraw his
former petition for probate.
"That petition was, I believe, granted
by your Honor yesterday. I gather my
information froru the newspapers," said
Mr. Shortridge. "I i.aye received no no
tice otherwise of the fact. However, we
nave answered the opposition, declaring
our belief that the will of the 21st is the
last will and testament of James G. Fair.
We are ready for trial on both issues, now
practically one, and we ask that they be
set for trial."
Judge Paterson made objection. He
thought it would never do to go to trial
until some issue had been joined as to all
the parties, as there could not be several
trials of tnis caseâ all the parties must
combine on one issue.
"All the parties are joined," said Mr.
Shortridge. "They have stated their op
position and we have answered."
"Mrs. Oelrichs and Miss Virginia Fair
have filed a demurrer to my amended con
test of your will,' 1 said Jndee Paterson.
"Indeed. When was it filed?" inquired
Mr. Shortridge.
"This mormn?," said Judge Paterson.
"Ah," exclaimed Mr. Shortridge, "that is
another proceeding of which we have had
no notice."
"Nevertheless it is so," said Judge Pat
erson.
"Then, your Honor, I beg that an early
day may be fixed for an argument," said
Mr. Shortridge. "We are desirous that tnis
matter shall come to trial upon its merits
as speedily as may be."
"I am willing," said Judge Paterson.
Charles S. Wheeler for Mrs. Oelrichs and
Miss Fair said he was ready to go to trial
at any time.
Then George Knight, lor Charles Fair,
rose and said: "Some reference has been
made by Mr. Shortridge to a certain
change of front on the part of a certain
person which I judge to be directed at my
client, Mr. Fair, -who sees fit to come here
in opposition to a will which he once
offered for probate under the impression
that it was genuine.
"I have only to say that this so-called
change of front may uot be so serious as
counsel would suggest. As Mr. Fair's
counsel we have no desire to pose as ob
structionists, interfering with a couple of
philanthropists who seek to shower mil
lions upon Mr. Fair. We are ready for
trial as aoon as* these side issues are
settled."
''Until these are so disposed of i cannot
fix a day for trial," said Judge Slack. He
stated that he would hear the argument
on the demurrer next Friday afternoon at
2 o'clock.
EASTERNERS ON THE BAY.
They Were the Guests of Mr. and Mrs.
K. H. Warneld of the California.
A party composed of the Rochester
(N. V.) four hundred were shown the
beauties of San Francisco Bay on the quar
antine tug Governor Perkins yesterday.
General and Mrs. R. H. Warneld were the
hosts, and the guests were Captain S. J.
Ruddell, Mrs. Bessie Paxton, Mrs. Gilman
Perkins, Miss Carolyn Perkins, Miss Ber
enice Perkins ana Mr. and Mrs. Craig
Powers.
The Union Iron Works were visited and
the baitle-ship Oregon was cone over.
Henry Scott showed the party around,
and they were ail loud in their praise of
the California shipyard. After a run to
Hunters Point drytiock and then along
the Alameda shore, and thence to Fort
Point and back past Lime Point and Sau
salito, the boat was headed through Rac
coon Straits and thence into the quiet
waters of Suisun Bay. There a sumptu
ou^cold luncheon was spread, after par
taking of which the party returned to toe
City.
RESCUED IN TIME.
An Unfortunate Young Woman 111 of
Health Attempts Suicide.
Mrs. Mary Brown, hysterical, broken
down in health as well as sad of heart,
awing to having recently been separated
from her husband, stepped off the ferry
boat Bay City yesterday afternoon on the
latter's2:ls o'clock trip'from Oakland.
A boat was promptly lowered and the
woman was rescued! Alfred Littlewood, a
porter on the vessel, was sent with Mrs.
Brown to the Receiving Hospital, where
she still lies in hysterics.
Mrs. Brown, whose residence is at 2222
Clay street, is a niece of Seth Mann, a
prominent attorney of this City.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Mare Island Tugboat Una
dilla Disabled in Mission
Bay.
Loss of Life on tte Orion During the
Gale That Capsized the
B airmore.
The Mare Island tug UnadOla was again
in trouble yesterday. After landing her
passengers from the Navy-yard at Wash
ington-street wharf she went down to the
Union Iron Works, and incidentally a
visit was paid to the wreck of the filair
more. On the return trip the connecting
red of the machinery broke near the crank
pin and the tug drifted around for half an
hour in a helpless condition.
Finally she drifted close to Mission Rock
ana a line was thrown ashore and the tug,
was safely moored. The captain and offi
cers were taken to the Mail dock by the
Union Iron Works tug Rockaway and
went at once uptown. In the evening the
steamer Sunol, owned by Piper, Aden,
Goodall & Co., took up the freight and
passengers, and it will be at least a week
before the Government boat is ready to
run agairi. It wa.Â» lucky that the accident
did not happen in Suisnn Bay when the
Unadilla was on her way down, as in that
event the thirty-odd passengers might
have ppent all day aooard before they
were picked up.
The schooner Orion, which arrived from
Grays Harbor yesterday, had a very
rough time of it. She was caught in the
southwester that capsized the Blairmore,
and again and again her decks were
flooded and some of the men were hurt.
At 12:20 p. M. on the 9th inst. in latitude
39 deg. 40 nun. north longitude 125 deg.
25 mi n. west a very heavy sea broke aboard
and John MeEllion was washed away, and
as no assistance could be given he was
drowned. Life buoys and ropes were
thrown to him, but he could not reach
them, and a mountainous sea buried him,
after which he was not seen again. He
was a native of Maine, 28 years of age ami
had been for some tira? a sailor on the
coast.
The Lighthouse Inspectors have issued
the following notice to mariners: Notice
is hereby given that pending repairs to
the fog-signal machinery at Alcatrsz
Island, Cal., the fog bell will not be
sounded in event of ioe on Monday and
Tuesday, April 13 and 14, 1596.
On and after April 15 the signal will
sound its usual characteristics during
tbictc and foggy weather.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company will beg^u running Sun
day steamers on the 27th inst. to and from
Stockton. The Mary Garrett will leave
Stockton at 7 p. m. each Sunday, and at
the same hour the J. D. Peters will leave
San Francisco. In this way the company
hopes to keep the two queen cities of the
Pacific in touch, and incidentally strike a
blow at the Southern Pacific, that now has
a monopoly of the Sunday business.
The steamer Uraatilla arrived from
Puget Sound ports yesterday afternoon,
but the genial face of John J. Campbell
was not seen in the purser's room, as
usual. He has caught the gold fever, and
after securing a three months' leave of ab
sence from the Pacific Coast Bteamship
Company has sailed for Alaska to hunt
"the pot of cold." His place was taken by
M. H. Lambert, the popular purser of the
Corona, who is so well known on the
southern route.
ON TRIAL iOR FORGERY.
Evidence Against <). W. Costa, Dean'a
Partner.
Joe McClusKey, or J. W. Costa, which
he says is his true name, was before Judge
Wallace Thursday, to be tried for raising
the |12 draft on the Woodland Bank.
In his opening statement Assistant
District Attorney Black said he would not
try to prove that McCluskey, or Costa, had
any hand in raising the $1- draft to one
for 122,000, but he would show that lie was
a party to the passing of it, and that he
was in every way an accomplice. He said
he would show that on the morning the
money was drawn from the bank Costa
called at Dean's office and asfced to sec
Dean.
Dean was not in, but on arriving later
said he had seen Costa on the stairs. He
said he would further shsw that Costa was
with Dean when the niot-ey was drawn
from the bank, and that he met him by
agreement in Omaha.
Wuey Lyle, the office-boy who worked
for Dean, was called, but he failed to fully
identify Costa as the man he saw with
Dean. He told how be took Depn to the
bank and then drove him out to the Va
lencia-street station, where he took the
train. He told Lyle he was going to he
away a few days, and to keep the otlice
open as usual.
George Grant of the Nevada Bank and
0. M. 1 homas of the Woodland Bank were
also called to tell of the peculiar transac
tion. The case then went over until Mon
day.
SING THE SAME SONGS
Rights to Authorship of Two
Popular Melodies in
Dispute.
NAMES AND WORDS CHANGED.
"Ma An?eUne," an Imitation cf "Dora
Dean," and "New Eully" Be
loDgtd to May Irwin.
There were two suits filed in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday against the
Zeno Mauvais Music Company for infringe
ment of rights to certain popular songs
which have been successfully sung on the
vaudeville stage. Broder & Schlam of San
Francisco and the White, Smith Music
Company of Boston are the complainants.
The former accuse the Zeno Mauvais Com
pany with republishing "Dora Dean,"
which the plaintiffs copyriehted on Febru
ary 4, 1896, under the name of "Ma Ange
line," and the "White-Smith Company
charge the defendants with publishing
"May Irwin's Bully Song" under the title
of the "New BulJy."
Broder & Schlam declare that "Dora
Dean" was composed by Bert A. Williams
and after the song became popular it was
wrongfully published and circulated for
sale under the name of ''Ma Angeline" by
the defendants to the suit. In an affidavit,
Bert Williama deposes that he is the author
of the scng in question ; that he composed
it while in the employ of Edward Hoiiian;
that he composed the words of the first
verse as well as the music and melody.
Edward Homan, Griffith Wilson, Daniel
Green and Charles Young testified that
they had heard Williams sing the song
and also had heard Charles Sidney O'Brien
â¢'murder it" under t.e name of "Ma
Angeline."
The plaintiffs ask for $5000 damages and
to have the defendants restrained from
further publications of the production.
The contention over the right to tho pos
session of the song as well as to who the
author really is has created much interest
among the artists of the concert st&ge.
In its complaint against the Zeno-
Mauvais Company the White-Smith Com
pany ask the court for an accounting, as
well as an injunction from further publi
cations of the "New Bully." The affidavit
sets forth that Charles E. Trevathan of
Union City, Term., and a former news
paper reporter of San Francisco, com

HONOR IN YOUTH.
President Martin Kellogg'g Address at
the Girls' High School.
President Martin Kellogg of tne State
University addressed a large audience of
young people last night in the big audi
torium of the Girls' High School.
It was one of a series of lectures ar
ranged by the Board of Education, and
the programme of the evening was unique,
because it included the first public ap
pearance of the Girls' High fccbool'chorus
of 150 voices. In addition to lour choruses
under the direction of Mr?, yon Meyerick,
there was a vocal trio consisting of Misses
Hewitt, Boston and Green and a solo by
Miss Florence Boston.
The theme of the lecture was the incul
cation of honor in the minds of the young.
He closed with an exhortation to his audi
tors to look to their own possibilities; to
ttio possibilities of naturally favored San
Francisco, and to the possibilities of Cali
fornia, the future of which dspend* in a
large measure upon the honor and man
hood of the youth that are to make its
citizens.
The next lecture will be by Professor E.
W. Griggs of the department of ethics at
Stanford University, and will be given
Friday, May 1. Next Friday, the 17tn,
the girls of the high school wjl! prestnl a
French comedy.

League of the Cross Cadets
Drill.
AN EXCITING COMPETITION.
Company G Wins the Moi:t ornery
Trophyâ Sergeant Dixon Captures
the Individual Prize.
The young soldiers of the League of the
Cross were cheered by GOOO enthusiastic
people at the Mechanics' ravilion last
night. It was the annual competitive
drill of the cadets for the Montgomery
trophy, and the occasion was marked with
brilliancy of color and effort. The dieni
taries of the church in somber garments
and the oflicers of the United States army
and State militia in gorgeous uniforms,
men prominent in all pursuit? of daily life
and women fashionably gowned â all were
there and applauded the efforts of the
_â¢ soldiers of the cross and the country.
When the regiment of eight companies
marched out on the floor of the Pavilion,
headed by the Presidio hand and passed in
review before the reviewing stand, which
was occupied by General Tiraham and staff
iuui General Vi'arfield and staff, the vast
audience gave expression to its admiration
in frequent outbursts of applause. The
boys presented a line front and marched
as one man.
The band stand collapsed during the
evening. It was overcrowded with people
inchiding many women. Fortunately no
one was injured.
Th.^ judges were: Captain Thorp Reillv
and Lieutenant Miley of the Fifth Artil

same movements as the preceding com
pany.
Company C of St. Patrick's parish. Cap
tain Edward Fitzgerald and Lieutenants
I>avid Barry and C. Regan, holding the
medal from the competition of a year a^o,
was loudly cheered when the boys entered
the competitive arena. They presented a
splendid front and their * bearing was
favorably commented upon. The move
ments were similar to the other companies
with a few extra nourishes original with
the commander.
Company I of St. Peter's parish, Captain
Peter Haggertv and Lieutenants Thomas
Marlowe and Charles Skelly. and Company
II of St. Brendan's parish, Captain Joseph
Power and Lieutenants Louis E. Healey
and J. Regan, al>o entered the competi
tion. Ail the companies made an excel
lent showing and the jud. es were obliged
to carefully scrutinize every movement in
order to form an accurate decision as to
which were the most skill faL
The trophy was awarded to Company G
of t>t. Bridget.'* parish. Quartermaster-
Sergeai.t William Dixono! (I. St. Bridget's
i ariah, won tne individual non-comrais
bioned officer's medal.
Archbishop Riordan made the presenta
tion in a brief speech. The reception com
mittee of Ignauan Council, No. 35, Y. M. 1.,
which presented an American standard of
colors to the regiment, consisted of ex-
Jud^e Sullivan, Frank McGlynn, Phil J.
Dwyer, A. B. Smith, Charles E. L. Hilde
brecht, T. H. Cosgrove, H. J. McGinnis
and Dr. J. F. McCone. A regimental
standard, a milk-white Hag with gold
fringe and bearing the arms of the League
of the Cross, was also presented to the
regiment. Judge Sullivan made an elo
quent speech in presenting the colors,
beid he:
The fraternal organization for which I speak
Is made ut> of American Catholics whose
adopted motto is "Pro Deo, Pro Patriaâ for
God and for country." Loyal to . faith
ana fatherland it has never been ashamed
of its faith and it has at .ill times en
deavored to intensify a feeling of loyalty to
ward this, our native land, wherein conscience
eqaliy with property and person iÂ» to be held
forever and sacredly inviolate.
We recognize in you a kindred organiza
tionâone aiming to elevate the standard of
Catholic manhood and American citizenship.
We note that you set a peculiarly high stnnd
erd for your conduct. Appreciating the ad
vantages of temperance in the development of
manly men and in the conservation of the
better forces of your nature, you have offered
the choice first fruits of your young manhood
as a willing sacrifice on the altar of God and
country. Your League of the Cross, with its
7000 members pledged to the cause of tem
perance, is an evidence of your desire to im
prove and advance yourselves and the com
munity in which you live, and at the same
time an evidence of the untiring energy and
real displayed through all the ages in the
cause of human kind by the grand old Catho
lic church.
The Accomplishment of our common destiny
depends on the virtue of our citizens. Each
citizen is a sovereign ruler in the guidance of
tne Nation's energies. Each one adds an item
to the intelligence, the virtue and the strength
of the Nation, contributing tne atom of his in
dividuality to the vast total of the Nation's
jower and greatness. For that reason the in
tellectual and moral standing of the citizen
sovereign should be advanced. For that rea
son his loyalty to his country should be in ten-
Biried. Republican institutions in the hands
of a virtuous and God-fearing nation are the
very best in the world, but in the hands of a
corrupt and irreligious people they are the
very worst and the most effective weapons of
tyranny.
Sensible that you are building up the vir
tuous character and developing the patriotic
ardor of your members, Ignatian Council bids
me to present through your colonel to the
regiment a stand of colors. Accept them as a
deserved tokeu of appreciation and regard.
Accept these National colors as an emblem of
a proud, consolidated, undying nationality
Render to that flag the supremest loyalty bi
love Hud sacrifice.
On your j art let no act of cowardice or
treachery, no lack of civic virtue tend to Its
degradation.
Lei no unholy hand profane its folds, no
impious tongue revile it. See to it that each
Biar set in its azure firmament holds its ap
pointed place, that it may continue to shed
through the ages to come the bright effulgence
of a fixed sun and not dart oft' on an erratic
course with the passing splendor of a meteor
Into the realms of destruction and of chaos.
You are, as I have said, !>olaiers of peace.
Your function is to build up a sense of di
cipline and a spirit of lionest pride in your or
ganization. But if by evil chanceâ which Gdd
forbidâ at the bidding of a foreign or domestic
foe the sulphury sirocco of war i-hould send its
blighting blast athwart our glorious Nation or
commonwealths, let me lee! assured that
r-inosg your ranks are those who would be
found where the battle rages fiercest and
where daring deeds are done.
.Tiidee Puiiivan noted the presence of the
Archbishop, Bishop Montgomery, Father
\orkej ami at the mention of these names
there >vaÂ« loud ai.plause.
Colonel Mahoney made a brief response

No Illiterate Voters in Mississippi.
"The new constitution of Mississippi,
which eliminates the illiterate voter, is
vindicating the wisdom of its framers,"
said Hon. Frank Johnson, ex-Attorney-
General of thnt State. "Under its opera
tion there is no disoriminatioo, and the
ignorant white man and the ignorant
black man are treated exactly alike. It is
the best law that our State" could lave
had. for it settles a vexed question on a
just and sensible basis, and rids us of the
manifold evils that formerly disturbed the
tnmquility antl security of our people. I
have no doubt that a majority of the citi
zens of Mississippi would prefer to lose
half of the representation they now lave
in Congress rather than to return to the
old system of unoualitied suffrage."â

ANOTHER PHCENIX.
Ex- Assemblyman Bretz Create* a Re
form Movementâ The Tele
phone.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cam.,)
908 Broadway, April 10. j
Ex-Assemblyman Bretz declares that
populism in Alameda County has left its
first love and he started out this afternoon
to bring it back to its former loyalty to the
Omaha platform.
Some months aero Mr. Bretz started out
on a similar campaign and for a tin?e
everything went smoothly. lie took an
interest in a weekly paper called Industry
and for several weeks the organ of reform
appeared with the name of Bretz as editor
and chief reformer. Somehow or other,
just how Mr. Bretz does not explain, the
editor was frozen out a few weeks ago,
aiv.i although the paper is still published
Mr. Bretz has nothing to do with it.
According to his statement the great
public enemies, the National hanks and
the corporations, have absorbed Industry,
and because they could not absorb him
Editor Bretz left.
His successor did not approve of Mr.
Bretz's reforms and from occupying a prom
inent positional the head of the editorial
column, A. A. Bretz received considerable
attention further down. This displeased
Mr. Bretz, but as he could not get Ins ideas
before the public any other way, he has
been forced to open another campaign ol
allegiance and reform and to establish an
other newspaper.
He opened his batteries to-night, and
the tall, well-known form of the man who
was once a memberof the Legislature, was
seen disposing of newspapers on Broad
way. His newspaper is called the Tele
phone, and is a pretentious sheet of eight
well-tilled pages.
The motto for the paper ia "The Cause
and Cure for Hard Tiroes,' 1 and Mr. Bretz
will try to have it officially recognized as
the organ of the latest reform wing of the
People's party.
GEMS OF PROGRAMMES
Something Uirque in a Printed
Itinerary for Excur
sionists.
Ca'ifornians' Greeting to the Hotel
Ken of the East New Herd-
in; Westward.
That the advent of the members of the
Hotel Men's Benefit Association of the
United States is to be no ordinary occa
sion is indicated in the magnificent pro
grammes that have been issued, giving the
itinerary of the excursionists during their
sixteen days' sojourn in the State as the
guests of the Southern California and Cali
fornia Hotel associations.
One thousand of these programmes
have been issued at a cost of $2000. They
are in book form, 6 by 4 inches, and con
sist of some forty odd gilt-edge pages,
handsomely and profusely illustrated by
tinted and vari-colored half tones. The
first two pages are covered with a hand
painted map, showing all the points that
are included in the itinerary. These are
brought out sharply by appropriate minia
ture sketches in color.
The town of Orange is represented by
the fruit of that name in its natural color,
San Jose is represented by groves of
verdant orchards, Monterey shows the
Del Monte Hotel, Coronado the famous
beach, Big Trees tali and spreading se
quoias; so through the whole list of Cali
fornia's most prominent and pleasant
places.
The cover is of leather, with the hand
worked design of an escnsholtzia and its
leaves on the front and a design - like
basket-weaving on the Lack.
The first of the excursionists left New
York and Boston yesterday and another
party will leave Chicago to-day. The total
number of visitors who are coining is about
325.
They will be met at Barstow by commit
tees from the two hotei associations of this
State on the 13th, end then until the 29th,
when the}' depart for home from San Fran
cisco, their stay will be made one round oi
pleasure.
All the gentlemen members of the visit
ing parties will wear a button bearing the
insignia of tise association on a bear, while
the ladies will display pins with the Cali
fornia poppy enameled on it in its natural
color.
Following is the greeting of the local
hotel men to their Eastern brethren, in
scribed In the opening pages of the pro
gramme:
California greets you with fruit and flowers,
music and dancing. California stands ready
to gladly welcome the members of the Hotel
Men's Mutual Benefit Association on the occa
sion of their annual meeting .for 1896. We
have no latchstring to hang on the outside of
our doors for you. In our "Land of the Sun
down Sea" our doors, even as our hearts, are
wide open, and we bid you enter and take full
possession.
Come and enjoy our land of poetry, romance
and song, of birds, buds and blossoms, where
nature smiles ah the year round and the
mocking-bird sings in the orange groves and
bids you welcome.
Come and see our majestic mountains, ver
dant valleys, sun-kissed ocean, our Spanish
tournaments, orange festivals, . flower carni
vals and California fiestas. They are all for
you, your wives, daughters, and sweethearts.
Come and you shall realize to the full the
meaning of the term "California hospitality,"
for we are determined That you shall have a
royal good time and return to your respective
homes glad that you came.
Ravages of Abninthe.
Mr. Rochefoit's recent advocacy of tem
perance has directed attention to the con
sumption of absinthe in France, and some
startling statements in connection there
with are being made. Men as a rule take
the absinthe diluted in water, sipping it
â¢Jowly, but the women, to the consterna
tion of the doctors, insist as a rule on
drinking it "neat," with most terrible re
sults to their constitutions. The number
of brilliunt men whom France has Jost
through the abuse of the opalescent but
poisonous fluid, from the great poet Alfred
de Mussei, who used to be picked up drunk
and half dead every night in the streets,
down to the celebrated artist and carica
turist, Andre Gill, is simply appalling. An
idea of the extent of the evil may be trath
erea from the recent returns of the Minis
try of Finance, which show that at the
present moment there is a marchnnd de
yin, or French absinthe seller, to every
three houses in the French metropolis. â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 189 C.
MADE A GREAT STAKE.
C. P. Dickinson Returns Home
From Perth With a Round
Million.
WAS FOEMERLY A UTAH MINER
His Story of the Activity in the
Several Camps From Freemantle
to Coolgardie.
C. P. Dickinson, formerly of Jackson,
Mich., who for some time was engaged in
mining in Utah, Idaho and Montana, and
who since 1887 has been at Perth, Murchi
son and Coolgardie, West Australia, is at
the Occidental.
He is a large owner in the New Chum
and Nortb New Chum, in the Murchison
district, the former of which paid dividends
C. P. Dickinson, the Erstwhile Miner of Utah, Now Here, Who Is Said to Have
(ill ;ined a Cool Million in West Australia.
[Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
of $500,000 last year. The two mines have
lately been consolidated, and British capi
tal has become interested in the consoli
dation.
Mr. Dickinson is the owner of properties
elsewhere in West Australia. He is now
en route to England in reference to the
placing of an enormous gold property on
the London market.
He is referred to as a millionaire, and as
an American, liable to be worth many
more millions.
Mr. Dickinson is an interesting talker.
He has great faith in the mines of the
Coolgardie country, but says the forma
tions are so different from what they arc
in California, or in any of the States or
Territories here, where he previously
mined, thnt no comparisons can be
made. The formations are principally
slate, granite and dyerite.
"As for the camps," .=aid Mr. Dickinson,
"they are very lively, but they differ a
pood deal from the mining camps here.
The liquor business is so regulated that
none of the disastrous results ensue that
are characteristic of the wild camps here,
i here are no dancehouses, either. The
camps are well envernel and life is safe.
"1 went out in 1887 wit i the late \V. 11.
Pation to Broken Hill to do some concen
trating, and eventually went to Perth and
the other camps. 'It is a wonderful gold
country. The formation is unlike any
thing here, and the conditions are entirely
different. Sometimes gold is found right
on the top of the ground, the same as if
you were to toss a $20 piece down here.
"The deepest shafts there now are
scarcely down 400 feet. Bailey's Reward,
at Coolsardie, is the deepest, I believe',
and I think it is abont down to that
depth. The Great Bonider mine at Cool
gardie is turning out about 4000 ounces of
gold a month. The average amount for
that camp for the past year has been about
20,000 ounces a month.
"The Murchison district has been pro
cduing about 7000 ounces a month. Ihe
various mines in which English capitalists
are interested are represented by from
Â£20,000,000 to Â£25,000,000 of stock. Great
Boulder shares which were of Â£1 value at
par, are now worth Â£8, or $40 a share. *
"Perth, which I call my home, though I
am interested in the camp, is nine miles
from the port of Freemantle. It has from
22,000 to 25,000 population, some of it be
ing floating. Murchison, which is north
west of Perth about 1500 niiles, has about
1500 people, and Coolgardie has about 25,
--000. It is north and a little east of Perth
and about 400 miles distant."
Mr. Dickinson is anxious to see Cripple
Creek, about which he has heard. Ho will
see it after a few days here, and may also
spend a little time in Utah and other
places from which he hits so loiiÂ£ been ab
sent.
WHERE DO DIRECTORIES GO ?
Apparently They Vanish Into Space
When Their Day la Done.
"What becomes of oIJ directories? is a
question that 1 have a&e.i myself many
time?," said an official of* the postoffice to
a Mail and Express reporter recently. "I
have tried many times to solve the ques
tion, but it is not as easy as it looks. lam
aware, of course, that a number of the
ancient directories go to the drugstores to
deceive the public that may enter in the
hope of consulting a new edition of the
annual, and it ie just as hard to get a new
directory in the average pharmacy as it is
to rind the same useful work in the aver
age telegraph office. I know some big
houses in this city that have used the same
guide to the addresses of residents for the
last five years, and they have not tired of
it yet.
'Many of the large corporations send
their old annual to out-of-town branch
offices when the new one comes around.
This is especially so of railroad com
panies. I dare say many private firms
would purchase old directories at a low
price if they could pet their, but they are
not as obtainable as one would suppose.
In all my experience I have never seen an
old New York City or Brooklyn directory
for sale on the second-hand bookstands.
Strange, is it not? They may be exposed
for sale for a!l that, but they must be gob
bled up so scon after being deposited on
the stall that few see them.
"I have heard that an uptown book
agent makes a business of buying up
antiquated directories, and have tried to
locate him more for curiosity than any
thing else, but thus far have failed to find
him.
"I know personally of a Wall-street law
yer who a few years ago paid $250 for a
city directory of 18(52. He wanted to put
it in evidence as proof of the existence of a
certain firm whose heirs he represented.
He won the case, and the directory is now
one of the heirlooms of his office."
ROMANCE OF A FRENCH SOLDIER.
Deserted Twice for Love of a Woman.
Twice Repented and Surrendered.
The story of a French soldier named
Massiault, recently acquitted by the court
martial of Montpellier, reads lttle like a
romance.
Young Massiault enlisted in 1882 in the
Ninety-first Regiment of infantry at
Mezieres. He proved an excellent soldier
and was promoted successively to the
grades of corporal, sergeant, sergeant
major and adjutant. In 1888 he was a
pupil in the Administration school, and
was on the point of being ag3in pro
moted when he made the acquaintance of
a youns; woman, with whom he fell des
perately in love. To the astonishment of
all. he dei-erted and ran away with her to
Belgium. A few months later lie returned
to Mezieres and gave himself up. He was
tried by court-martial, sentenced to four
years' hard labor and to be reduced to the
ranks on the expiration of his term of
punishment. Under the amnesty law of
1859 he was released and was incorporated
in the One Hundredth Regiment, garri
soned at Xarbonne. The military authori
ties doubtless imagined that by sending
him to the other end of France they
would place him out of the reach of the
influence of the beauty that bewitched
him.
I But in this they were mistaken. She
: found oat where lie was, and soon she ar
rived atNarbonne. Once more he deserted
j and went with her, this time to Spain.
; This second desertion was aggravated by
: the fact that he carried off his uniform
and arms.
Not daring to return to France, he led a
miserable life in Spain for eighteen
I months, but at last he could not stand it
'â â  any longer, so he returned to Marseilles,
where he entered the service of the Foreign
Legion for live years under the false name
of Stock. He was sent off to Tonquin,
j where- once more he proved himself to be
; a good soldier, and rapidly regained the
j galons of corporal, sergeant and sergeant
major.
* But the recollection of his desertion
weighed upon his mind and his false name
troubled him. Moreover, for seven years
j he had not seen his parents. He became
I homesick and longed to visit his native
| place in the Ardennes. His term of ser
vice being about to expire he went to the
colonel and (old him who was. He was
â  sent back to Narbonne and thence to
I Montpellier. where once more he appeared
j before the court-martial. He was tried
and acquitted on account of hit* good
record, and the soldiers and spectators
who were present at the trial cheered Him.
But he had to be again reduced to the
ranks, because Sergeant-Major, Stock no
longer existed in the French army. At
the present time his friends and admirers
are making energetic efforts with a view
of getting him restored to his former
rank.â Courier dcs Etats Unis.

An Epitome of Sermons of the Week
Tliroiisliout the Land.
Following is a summary of the principal
sermons recently delivered in the United
States and Canada by the leading clergy
men, priest?, prelates, religious teachers
and professors of the Christian faith. Io
every instance the full text has been care
fully read and abbreviated.
MAN.
Man is the child of promise, the heir of the
ages and the heir-apparent or the divine glory.
âRev. C. L. Thompson, Presbyterian, New York
City.
UNITARIANIBM.
Unitorianism is not so much a creed as a
rational hope and faith. It believes more in
character than in dogma.â Rev. O.J. Eairchild
Unitariun, Spokane, Wash.
PHILANTHROPY .
Let business men remember their less favored
brothers, as Peanoiiy and Carnegie and Lick
and Stanford have done. Every one oweÃ
much to the other man.â Rev. C. E. Locke
Methodist, Portland, Or.
HOMK.
If our girls spent as much time in making
cages to Keep tiie birds as they do in making
nets to catch them we would have better
homes.â Rev. A. J. Harris, Baptist, Fort VVorta
Tex.
Jt'STICE.
Justice and greed are eternal enemies.
Selfishness is the greatest obstacle to justice!
It is this that makes one man take advantage
of the needs of another to enrich himself.^-
Rev. J. S. Beeger, Methodist, Cleveland. O.
INTEMPERANCE.
When the United States, as a nation, shall
decree that the manufacture of intoxicating
drinks is a sin and a crime, then will we see
the end of this monstrous evil. â Rev. T. C.
Denman, Methodist, Volunlown, R. I.

started that the law can be enforced. The
right kind of a Mayor and Chief of Police,
backed by a strong public sentiment, cau en

Methodist, Providence, R. I. ;
" SUNDAY.
There must be a place for worship or there
will De no worship. Hence the church. There
must be a time for worship or there will be no
worship. Hence the obligation of the Sab
bath.âRev. W. U. Moore, Presbyterian, Doyles
town, Pa. ~ ' i 'â 
i VICE AND VIRTUE.
There is a far closer connection between our
virtues and our vices than most of us are ac
customed to suppose. What is the relation be
tween them? This: Our vices are our virtues
carried to excess.â Rev. J. J. Lamer, Episco
palian, West Philadelphia, Pa.
â¢WORLDLY THINGS. . \
Interests that are purely worldly should be
left to worldly people. Christians have no
time to devote to them. They roust part with
anything that has the place in their affections
that belongs to Christ.â Rev. R. H. Hume,
Presbyterian, Springfield, Ohio.
WOMEN'S WOBK.
God created man and woman fora purpose:
the man to do his work outwardly and publicly
and the woman to do hers inwardly and pri
vately. A woman can imitate the work of
man, but she can never do it.â Rev. A. S. Crap
scy, Episcopalian, Rochester, N. Y.
. MANHOOD. -
Christianity has restored manhood. It puts
man back into the original condition before
the influences of sin caused his decay. The
man restored, he will look out for others who
are lost, that he may brine them back to the
highest manhood.â Rev. Mr. Ostrom, evangel
ist; Terre Haute, Jnd. > . .
WOMAN.
' Woman is the complement of man. Man
furnishes strength, woman ornaments that
strength with beauty; man furnishes courage,
woman supplements that courage with forti
tude; man furnishes intelligence, woman re
fines that intelligence into taste; man fur
nishes virtue, woman perfects that virtue into
goodness.â Rev. J. E. Adams, Methodist, Brook
lyn, N. Y.
THE CHURCHES.
The world has outgrown some churches. It
has outgrown narrow conceptions of religious
truth. ; Heresy trials, narrow doctrinal dissen
sions, and the insistence on ceremonial ob
servances as essential to the salvation of men
drive the masses from the churches which
force such limitations upon them.â Rev. G. R.
Wallace, Congregationalism Chicago, 111.
THE BALLOT.
A man's vote is more significant than his
occupations or bisfriendshiDS. At the polls
he recognizes his kinship with the great of the
'.an He is of an equal ;of Senators" and
Judges and Presidents. He is a psrt of the
body politic, responsible for the administration
and government. â Rev. Cyrus Richardson,
Congregation alist, Nashua, N. 11.
PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME.
Let crime be given no quarter. Let the
prison door be opened to the guilty, no matter
what family connections they may have. High
social standing only aggravates his guilt. The
highest interests of society demand that every
criminal be speedily punished to the full
extent of the law.â Rev. M. A. Peters, Re
formed Church, York, Pa. 'â¢
"AMERICA' FOR AMERICANS.
The cry of "America for Americans" has a
rather narrow meaning, while "America for
Men" has a nobler meaning. America for men
and women of : noble intelligence and . noble
ambitions, people of just and generous and
humane souls, whose charter Khali read: "The
world my country and mankind my country
men."âRev. E. L. Rexford, Unlversalist, Co
lumbus, Ohio. â 
JOURNALISM.
To publish a newspaper- requires the skill,
the precision, the boldness, the vigilance, the
strategy of a commander-in-chief. To edit a
newspaper requires that one be a statesman,
an essayist, a . geographer, a statistician, and,
in acquisition, ; encyclopedic. To - govern j a
newspaper until it shall be a fixed institution
â '"â¢ NEW PUBLICATIONS.â¢ i-. ,
is to demand more qualities thnn any tmsiuess
on earth.â Rev. T. de Witt Taltuage, Presby
terian, Washington, D. C.
METnODIST UNITY.
The supreme need of this hour is a reunion
of dismembered Christendom. We may no;
be able to heal the brencli between Protestant
ism and Roman Catholicism, noreven between
the various branches of Protest.ir.tism, but the I
seventeen breaches of Methodism ought to be
able, by the grace of God, to get together.â
Rev. J. W. Magruder, Methodist, Cincinnati,
Ohio.
THE CITIZEN BOFS.
Usually the boss holds some official position,
but in the Empire State to-day the dictator,
Thomas C. Phut, is a private citizen. The only
office he occupies is an express office on lower
Broadway, and yet from his throne invisible
he rules his party and the entire people with
a rod of iron.â Rev. J. L. Scudder, Congrega
tionalist, Jersey City, N. J.
SALVATION.
Many wait until the hand of death is almost
clasped upon them before they consider their
duty to God. Salvation is the work of a life
time, ar.d should not be allotted but a few
moments in this life, as many are wont to give
it. Riches and worldly pain are matters of but
a few years, while salvation is for eternity.â
Rev. Patrick Lavelle, Catholic, Pittsburg, Pa.
RELIGION AND BUSINESS.
A great many people don't believe in mixing
religion and business, but such people have no
religion to mix. A religion which is only for
Sunday, which can permit six days of business
to be run on the devil's principles, and which
gives reluctantly as a favor to God a part of the
isabbath, is atheism. It is not Christianity.â
Rev. B. Fay Mills, evangelist, Lafayette, Ind.
CULTURE.
Refinement and culture should not be merely
physical. They should be moral and spiritual.
| Polish that does not include the moral and
spiritual nature is only a veneer. There is a
false culture which resembles the cut flowers
of the florist, which have short ttems, are ab-
I breviftted and s<v>n wither away. But the
church is the center and source of all true cul
ture.âRev. D. R. Breed, Presbyterian, Pitts
burg, Pa.
FAITH.
All human knowledge, all human affection
is built on taith. Fai'.h is the eye and ear of
the soul. All history is wiih us a matter of
faith. The farmer sows his ft crt by faiih, and
largely by faith !i man prospers in business.
1 Business in basea wholly on faith. Faith makes
; national business intercourse possible; faith
binds together the church, tlie nation and the
family.â Dishop Arnett, African Methodist,
Meadville. Pa.
JUDGMENT.
We are all standing before the judgment
seat of Christ row, and being te.-ted every day, i
| not to rind what kind of an angel or devil we I
I are going <o make at some far aivny time, but
what kind of a man or woman we are going to
be to-morrow. Each day's life is the outcome |
of our former mode of living, ami we have i
heaven or hell continuously, according to our
capacity and merit.â Rev. L. H. Squires, Uni
versalist, Rochester, N. Y.
EDUCATION AND MORALITY.
Thousands of the most intelligent and
learned men of the past, were as much dis
tinguished for their wickedness as for their
wisdom. Knowledge alone cannot make us
better men, for knowledge is oftener an in
strument of evil than an instrument of good.
The blackest villainies in the world's history
were planned by men who had received di
plomas from colleges and universities. It is
not true, iheu, that education is the panacea
I for all the moral ills of the world âRev. J. B.
Hawthorne, Baptist, Atlanta, Ga.
LOVE.
Love iÂ« the greatest -need of the age. Pov
erty causes many people to suffer from hunger
to-day, but they need love raoro than they need
bread. As eager as the intellect is for knowl
edge it is not as necessary to it as love. We
may empty our purse in the hand of the
needy, but unless we give to him our heart's
love and sympathy we have not given what He
needs. We may give both time and money to

aid the destitute, but unless we have been
actuated by love we have done nothing In the
sight of God.â Rev. J. R. Boyle, Methodist,
Wilkesbarre. Pa.
SIN' AND ITS PUNISHMENT.
When we fin we rob God of something, and
we ought to be willing to repay him in some
manner, while we have health and strength,
instead of waiting to feel remorse for an un
fruitful life when we near its end. We may be
told to take iife with its pleasure* and its sins
moderately, but the Scriptures tell us plainly
that the joys and the torments of heaven and
hell are not moderate, hut acute. â Rev. F. J.
Kiernan,' Catholic, Philadelphia.
MORALITY AND JUSTICE.
In the white light of heaven's throne a man's
sin appears precisely the same as a woman's
and impurity is as black on Fifth avenue as on
the Bowery. The world has two codes of
morain, masculine and feminine, but that dis
tinction is not recognized in the other world,
(iender has no right to destroy justice. The
vials of wrath are poured upon the heads of
unfortunate women, while the most royal wel
come is given to Hie man who is notoriously
unclean. That is the accursed creed of this
hour. Injustice, injusticeâ basest injustice â
hisses at the woman, but kisses for the man.â
Rev. Cortland Myers, Baptist, Brooklyn, N. V.

Cyclists Are Doing.
The great relay race will he decided to
morrow, provided that the weather re
mains fine. This is one of the principal
events of the season in cycling, and doubt
less a large number of ladies and gentle
men -will witness the finish.
The Interstate Coursing Club will meet

The Sportsmen's Association will meet

THE WHEELMEN.
Great Hundred-Mile Relay Race to
Be Run To-Morrow.
The third annual 100-mile relay rare of ;
the California Associated Cycling Clubs,
Starting here, riding around the bay via j
San Jose ard finishing in Alameda, will <
be contested to-morrow by ten teams of j
ten men each from t^an Francisco, San j
Jose and Alarceda County clubs. The i
start will be made promptly at 9 o'clock j
from in front of Varney's Biclorama, ;
Market and Tenth streets, an<d the finish !
will be at Central avenue and Grand j
street. Alameda, x>robably a few minuted
before 2 o'clock. Persons from this City
wishing to see the iinish should cross the
bay "ot later than 12:30 o'clock on the
broad-gauge boat, taking the train to Ala
mecia and getting off at Grand-street
station, from which point the rinish is but
two blocks distant.
Tne roads will be found somewhat
heavy all along the relay course, particu
larly tne first twenty miles out of this
City; but the race would be run off if the
roads were knee-deep in mud just the
same, and at this time of the year they are j
not exj>eated to be at their best. Last I
year a dry spell for two weeks prior to the ,
race made the riding perfect and fast time
was made, but it is not expected that last
year's time of 4 hours 56 minutes 47 sec
onds will be equaled.
The teams and officials were all pub
lished in The Call yesterday. The relay
committee of the associated clubs will ;
iiave its headquarters in Alameda during
the race, at the rooms of the Alameda
Cyclers, near the finish, where reports
will be constantly received of the progress
of the race and displayed upon bulletins,
it would naturally seem that this would
be a great gathering-place for the wheel
men, but the fact is, bo many of them will
be actually employed in the race in some
capacity >>n the "ten different relays that
there will be few at the finish. It will re
quire between 700 and 1000 men to prop
eriy conduct this race â at least, seventy i
from each of the clubs, and as many more
as they can supplyâ and as they will be
spread out at all the" different stations and
will probably not get home until late to
morrow night it will remain for the citi- ;
;w and unattached riders to see the finish
and cheer the victor.
A great deal of money will change ;
hands on the raceâ a fact which the asso
ciation deplores, but which it is powerless 1
to remedy. The Bay City Wheelmen are :
slight favorites in the bettfng.Oiympic Club j
Wheelmen second, Acme Club Wheelmen i
third and Garden City Cyclers fourth.
That is the order in which the sporting
traternity evidently think they will finish.
There is' considerable money up that the |
San Francisco Road Club will beat the lm- j
penal Cycling Club, and on the face it i
look< like a good bet. There is no crowing j
beforehand anting the clubs. They all
realize that a hard race and the greatest
wheeling event of the year is before them,
and the riders are training carefully and
waiting patiently for the hour of the race
to come. All the riders, trailers and offi
cials will be at their respective stations to
nightâthey must beâ and the clubhouses
here will consequently be deserted.
\V. C. Brode of tin-" Buy City Wheelmen

7."> cents. This is tbe big hotel on the hill,
and the otlicers consider that such en
couragement from a uotel which has al

appreciated by the league members, but
should serve as a great inducement to

Manager Fhafrr is Irying hard to match
W. W. Hamilton, the Denver flier, against
somebody for a professional race for a
purse of ?1000. He challenged John S.
Johnson, after he was safe on his way to
Europe; now he is after Walter C. Sanger,
bat the big Milwaukeean has refused,
rightly saying that he is entirely out of
condition, having been off the wheel all
the winter, while Hamilton has been in
constant training at Coronado. Shafer
will now try for B;il<i or Zimmerman. It
is good free advertising, this challenging
men who are ont of form, and no doubt
Shafer has the best of the argument now.
But if his Denver champion ever did run

for they are without question faster men

make any attempts for records, but it is now
thought from the present indications that
favorable weather will be had this week and
trials for all classes of records up to one mile
will be made. As we hove but one pace-mak
ing machine, the s-extuplct, all attempts will
have to be made with the aid of this.'onu
machine, and while it is expected that we will
be able to lower all of the existing records it
will be the first time that records have been
broken under circumstances like this for
record-breaking teams have heretofore had at
least three or four multiple machines such as
triplets or quads, but from present indications
the big six-seated "Yellow Fellow" will be
able to carry the men fast enough, and such
being the case the records will truly be re
markable ones.
The men are all in excellent condition and
are riding very fast, and as there are only four
more weeks remaining in which records can be
made there will surely have to be a lot of
lively work done to get them. Yours,

Smoking while indulging in the pastime
of wheeling is a practice to be avoided.
It not only injures the wind, but is di
rectly responsible for various kinds of lung
disease. Physicians have argued that the
wheel is injurious â physicians who do not
ride â but let them examine other features
of cycling and they will quickly come to
the conclusion that it is not the exertion
dependent upon propelling a wheel, but
the dissipations of smoking and drinking
practiced by the riders that are dangerous
to health.

THE ANGLER.
Eleven Large Steelheads Caught
Near Alvarado by Al Pape.
The late rains have very materially in
terfered with the sport of anelers.
Excepting the small streams which
empty into the creeks that usually afford
good fishing at this season of the year, the
prospects lor respectable catches of trout
are not by any means favorable for to
morrow.

creeks that have generally afforded good
sport to local anglers contained large
numbers of trout, and the outlook for a
very successful opening of the season was
truly excellent, but King Pluvius put a
damper on the expectations of the knights
of the rod, and as a result the future pros
pects for good fishing are decidedly prob
lematical.
Frank Hoffling of Haywards has discov
ered a new iishing ground which gives
promise of being well patronized by mid
winter iishermen who sit and wait'for re
sults.
Mr. Hoffling came to this City yesterday
purposely to purchase strong "rods and
tackle which he contends are unquestion
ably necessary to successfully handle and
capture the big steelheads that are loafing
in a lagoon which is within a short walk of
the town of Alvarado.
"I was shooting robin snipe near Alva
rado last week,' said Mr. Hottiing, "when
1 met a country fellow tramping along the
marsh with a willow pole in his hand.
*'I was inquisitive enough to ask him
what he was after, and the fellow an
sweredâsalmon. I could not help smiling
at the idea of a person catching salmon in
a slough near Alvarado, but when he in
vited me to accompany him to the happy
salmon fishing grounds, I thought that
there might possibly be something in it,
and off we started for the prospective
angling waters.
"Here's the spot, sir," said my friend,
"wuere I landed two big fellows yesterday
and got cleaned out by a third/
I "I watched him straighten out his line,
j which was strong enough to hold a shark.
I He then empaled six large ground worms
j on a No. (3 hook, and an awkward cast was
I made into the pool, which was, 1 guess,
five or six feet in depth.
"We did not have to wait long for re
sults. A three-pounder had taken good
hold of the baited hook, and as it was mak
| ing off with the prize the rustic angler
! struck quickly, and then a yanking match
I between man and fish followed which
I would have made the great and only
Frank l)olliver blush for shame.
"The steelhead, or salmon, so called by
the country fellows, was conquered in less
than ten seconds, and tnen I realized for
the first time that my newly formed ac
quaintance informed me correctly as re
gards steelhead fishing in the Alvarado
lagoon.
"Before I took my departure I wit
nessed the capture of two beautiful fish all
about the same in size and weight. Un
less it rains between now and Sunday I
will be in for some grand sport."
Mr. HoSling certainly spoke correctly as
regards the sport that anglers can now" en
joy near Alvarado, provided, of course,
that the slouch will not be made muddy
by heavy rains.
Alexander Pape, whose place of business
is on the southeast corner of Jackson and
Battery. streets, fished in the lagoon that
Mr. Hoffling referred to on Thursday last,
and landed eleven large fish which scaled
respectively 2, 8, 3^, 4, 4}i, \\i, 1%, 1%, 3,
8 ana 8% pounds each.
Mr. Tape states that if he had not been
cleaned out completely by one very large
fish he would have caught more steelheads
than he could possibly carry. What
caused the run of large fishes into this la
i goon no one seems to be in a position to
j offer an explanation. . Mr. Homing thinks
that the flow of water from the wells into
the slough attracted the game fishes,
which news will, of course, be . welcomed
by all local anglers. Several enthusiastic
fishermen from this City will try their
luck in the Alvarado Slough to-morrow.
Stanley Post and companions will leave
I this evening for an eel hunt in the bay,
j near San Pedro. Post is generally success
! ful when he sets his cap for eely monsters.
S. Constantini of 111 O'Farrell street re
turned recently from a tributary of Coyote
Creek, which stream is near Gilroy, with a

THE BOXERS.
Choynski and Sharkey Are In Good
Trim for Thursday Night.
The National Athietic Club lias made
elaborate preparations for its next exhibi
tion of physical culture, which will be
held on Thursday evening at the People's
j Palace, Mason and Eddy streets.
The star event will be an eight-round
I contest between Joe Choynski and Tom
â  Sharkey. To win the long end of the
! golden 'string Choynski must stop Sharkey
in eight round's or less â a condition, by the
way, which will guarantee some lively ex
â from start to finish,
y easily disposed of every oppo

ism as a business, which, so far,

T he lighting seaman is a magnificently
i built fellow, whose staying powers are vii
i questionably great. Having whipped sev
! oral second and third class pugilists with
i comparative ease, he at last concluaed to
j try lor a place among the top notchers,
j and when Charles ("Parson") Davies was
i visiting this City a few weeks ago with
j the Sullivan combination, he offered to
I match Choynski against Sharkey, and
i guaranteed that Choynski to win must
stop his opponent in eight rounds.
Sharkey was already aware of what
Choynski had accomplished, but he had
confidence in his own ability to stand off
I the hard-hittiuji Joseph for eight rounds
, at least.
The match was made and Sharkey went
! to his old quarters at the Cliff "House,
: where he has trained hard and fast ever
! since in anticipation of a very lively half
j hour's fun on the evening of the ltith inst.
Choynski arrived last Saturday and, as
he was in tolerably fair condition when he
landed in his native City, he concluded
| that all he required to fit him for a sharp
engagement was a little bag-punching
' and some long-distance walks in the sub
. urbs. He is now qualified to enter the
' ring and, according to his own words, he
has never felt better in his life.
Joseph has not as yet cast c3 T es upon his
opponent, Tom, but he hopes to see a good
man in front of him when time is called
for hstic exchanges.
Sharkey has had considerable ring ex
perience in the last year or so, and al
though he may not have impressed a
number of people with the belief that he
is entitled to recognition among the first
class pugilists of the present day, he is
certainly far ahead in many respects of a
number of men wtio are classed among the
leading heavy-weights of the country.
It ninst be remembered that Choynski
is a star performer, who ranks in tlie same
class with Fitzsimmons, Maher, Slavin
and Corbttt, consequently if Sharkey can
stand off Joseph for eight rounds, he is
certainly entitled to great credit and a
place among the aspirants for champion
ship honors.
Charles Davies has Kindly forwarded the
sporting editor of The Call from Butte,
Mont., the following table of measure
ments of Chovnski, which were taken at .
Asbury Park, N. J., on June 15, 1895:

Mr. Davies states that he will arrive

mark his return will be welcomed by his
many friends.
The preliminaries that have been ar
ranged for Thursday evening consist of
four rounds between Martin Muiverhill
and Jack Hall, four rounds between Patsy
Kerrigan of Australia and Jack McCauley
: of the San Francisco Athletic Club.
Owen Ziegler of Philadelphia and his
, trainer, Martin Kennedy, will arrive here
jon Tuesday. Manager Kennedy of the
Olympic Club predicts that the contest be
: tween Ziegler and Green will prove the
| most interesting boxing bout that has been
; witnessed in this City in many moons. It
j will be held at the Pavilion on the evening
;of May 1. Kennedy has also matched
i John Miller (big John) of the San Fran
! Cisco Athletic Club against M. Van Bus
j kirk of the Olympic Club for a four-round
; curtain-raiser. This match should prove
almost as interesting as the principal
event of the evening.
The following article appeared in the
Chicago Times-Herald on April 4, con
cerning Jimmy Barry :
Pr. Bradley, who was to have performed an
operation on Jimmy Barry's left hand, has de
cided to wait fora while to see if he cannot
prevent such action. Some time ago Barry,
in boxing with his sparring partner, broke the
forefinger of his left hand in cross-countering.
The broken finger was set, but In healing a
"callus" formed on the bone. This grew
larger, and Barry was for a time unable to
train. Finally he saw the doctor, who decided
to break the finger over and reset it. Later he
said that he did not think it would hurt to al
low it to rest for a while, as long as six months,
as he did not think he would be any the- worse
off then than now.
In the meantime Barry will have his hand in
a b&naage to avoid striking it against any
thing, as it is now he is constantly moving
the injured member, so that it has no time to
heal. Barry is s)K.'inHng much of his time rid
ing a wheel. He is becoming an expert wheel
man and expects to win the great road race
on Decoration day. Since his hand was hurt
he has been unable to play handball, and he
is glad the season for wheeling !s here at last.

AH About the Scullers and Near
Future Race Meetings.
The residents of Belvedere and Tiburon
are talking of converting the lagoon back
of Tiburon into a magnificent lake, replete
with all boating facilities.
If the scheme is carried through it will
prove a great benefit to the oarsmen, as it
will give them an admirUble course on
which to hold their regattas.
The laeoon is three miles long, a half
mile wide, and will be made eight feet deep.
The water will always be as cairn as a
mill pond, and the hills on each side will
eliminate the exertion of rowing against
any wind.
Things are assuming a lively aspect
around the Dolphin Club. At their regu
lar monthly meeting held last Wednesday
evening considerable business was trans
acted. A committee consisting of J. J.
Cronin, W. O. Patch, Frank Kelly, C.
Coney and C. J. Mogan was appointed to
arrange for a highjinks and regatta, to
be held next month.
William Fett, William J. Henrick and
Charles J. Stewart were elected to mem
bership at the meeting, and it was also
decided that the picnic to be given by the
club at Sunset Park, June 7, will be the
last picnic given by the Dolphins.
Fifteen of the Dolphin boys arc going to
row over to Sausahto Saturday night on
a fishing excursion, under the manage
ment of T. R. Keenan.
A fentnre of the club's high jinks will be
the swimming match between John
Caughlin and T. J. Kennedy and the
canoe race between Peter and Robert yon
Hadeln.
John Caughlin will be the club's repre
sentative in ttie single scull at the El
Canipo regatta, May 30, and their junior
ana senior crews will be a? follows:
Seniorsâ John Caugtilin, stroke; J.
Marron, after waist; T. Hopkins, forward
waist; Al Ronard. bow and captain.
Juniorsâ C. D. Sullivan, stroke; Fred
Woerner, forward waist; Joseph Laib,
afterwaist ; \Y. O. Patch, bow and captain ;
George Roach, coxswain.
The Dolphins feel sure that this aggre
gation of talent will bring at least one vic
tory to their new boathonse.
The Ariels feel elated over the success of
their recent entertainment, and the club
Ls now on a good financial basis, and they
promise to pot some dark horse crews in
the coming regatta.
The club will use the proceeds of the en
tertainment for the better equipment of
their boatuonse. It is their intention to
have a new racing barge and a few more
outrigger sUiffs built.
E. J: Flanders, the secretary of the club,
has his launch almost complete. It was
built by an Eastern boat-building linn,
and was shipped here in parts and put to
gether by Mr. Flanders and other mem
bers of the club.
It will cost in the neighborhood of $2000
and is 35 feet long, 8 feet beam and 8 feet
deep, and will be ritted out with living
apartments.
When complete the Ariels intend to
make an extended tour up the river.
Ed Newburr is the name of the Ariels'
new coxswain. He hails from the East and
has steered in many of the big Eastern re
gattas. The club says he is second to none
on the bay, not excepting George McGrill,
the clever little coxswain of the South
Ends, the winner of twenty-four out of
twenty-live races.
Following is a list of men who will be
tried out for positions in the Ariels' boats
for the big regatta:
Outrigger skiffâ George Phelan, J. Wil
son, Ed Wilson N. J. Prendergast, J.
Bockman. W. T. Howe and P. Sanchez.
.Barge crewsâ A. M. Racouillat, Henry
Tank, Johnson Hardy, J. Nolan, A.
Harters, D. J. Sbeean, Joe Buckley, W.
Naughton, J. A. Allen, George T. Mc-
Ginniss, Syl Pearl and J. Larkey.
Leander Stevenson will train the men
and from the above list will be selected
their racing crew.
At a meeting of the Alameda Boating
and Swimming Club, held last evening, S.
J. Pembroke was elected a delegate to the
Pacific Athletic Association. The presi
dent of the club, Nellson. and Treasurer
Craigh, were elected delegates to the
annual convention of the association.
Cole, Whittenmeyer, Trew, Grimwood,
and Nelson Echardt, coxswain, is the per
sonnel of the University of California's
crew.
The South Ends are already trying out
men to form a new junior crew. The most
promising men so far are Ed Tooin, J. E.
Scully, J. D. Mahoney, Jim Pallas, Tim
Fitzpatrick, Dave Campbell and C. G.
Fox. â¢
William McCausland is already in train
ing for his match in the single scull with
Duplissea.
E. F. Sonrns will raffle his wherry off at
the South End boathouse Sunday, as he
is desirous of purchasing a finer boat.
The barge race between the senior crew
and T. F. Barry's crew, which was post
poned last Sunday on account of the
weather and which" was to take place to
morrow, has been declared off perma
nently, owing to the illness of D. F. Smith,
the afterwaist man of Barry's crew.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
A Favorable Outlook for thÂ« Now
Opening Season.
At the close of the cricket season in Oc
tober last there were not wanting the per
ennial jeremiad in regard to the rapidly ap
proaching death of the sport in California.
Yet, now as the new season dawns, the
outlook was never more promising. All
the clubs have been strengthened with
new blood; the grounds, both at Alameda
and Golden Gate, have been put into excel
lent condition. New wickets, well-rolled
outfields, grand stands repaired and re
splendent in fresh coats of paintâ these and
above all, the greatest enthusiasm on be
half of players past, present and futures
augur well for a banner season.
During the winter an effort was made to
ascertain the feasibility of sending a rep- |
resentative team East, but as far as I could j
learn it met with a premature death, the
cause of which was probably internal dis
sension. It is only , a question of time,
however, when this desirable expedition
will be arranged and it will be a matter of
equal : joy to the Eastern as to our own
clubs.

COURSING.
Grand Meeting- of the Interstate
Club at Newark Park.
To-morrow morning the members and
numerous friends of the Interstate Cours
ing Club will journey to the Newark
Coursing Park, where the second grand
club-meetintr of the season will be held.
The Interstate Club 19 composed of the
leading sportsmen of San Francisco, Oak
land, Ban Jose and other cities close by.
It goes without saying that the gentlemen
of the club course only for the sport that
is to be derived from this branch of out
door pastimes, and, indeed, had it not
been for the organization of the Interstate
Club the sport of the leash in this State
would eventually become nauseating to
those who have worked hard and faith
fully to make it the sport of gentlemen.
According to a statement which was
published in last Thursday's Call, the
proprietors of the Ocean View coursing
park said that they concurred in the views
of Mr. Holbrook, who is president of the
Humane Society, that coursing is a cruel
and brutal sport.
The nominations and drawing for the
Newark Park meeting were published in
yesterday's Call, and as the dogs owned
by the members are of good quality and
high breeding an excellent day's racing
may be expected by the several ladies and
gentlemen who will witness the rounds.
Newark hares have been always noted
for their running qualities, therefore all
that is necessary to guarantee an excellent
day's outing is fine weather.
An unually high-class lot of dogs are en
tered for to-morrow's coursing at Casserly
& Kerrigan's Ocean View Park and with
good weather a line days' sport should re
sult. Among the entries are Captain
Morse, Electric, Lord Clifton. Nellie C and
other well-known fliers.
A large number of hares that have been
resting in the reserves will be turned out
and should give the dogs plenty of work
to catch them. The result of the drawing
will appear in to-morrow's Call.
THE GUN.
Live and Artificial Bird Shooting
Contests In Oakland.
A large gathering of sportsmen is ex
pected to-day at the Oatland tiack to wit
ness the second day's nfeeting of the State
Sportsmen's Association. In yesterday's
contests Fanning took first money with
six straight kills in the first race, and in
the second race Haight and Feudner
divided. The second event, at ten birds,
was taken by Feudner with ten kills, and
the same gentleman took the third event,
twelve birds, with twelve kills.
Tne fourth event, fifteen birds, was won
by H. McCurdy of Fulton, N. V., with
fifteen straight kills. In this race Robin
son and Webb divided second money with
fourteen birds each.
On Sunday next the Empire Gun Club
will shoot at bluerocks at Alameda Point,
and the Capital City Gun Club will hold a
meeting at Sacramento on the same day.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
will hold its first annual picnic to-morrow
at Schuetzen Park, San Rafael. A large
gathering ot sportsmen and their friends
are expected.
Sacramento Sporting News.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., April 10.-The
fishing season has openea in earnest and
good catches are reported as being made at
Dormer Greok, near Truckee, and at
Floriston, some eight miles distant. At
the present time bait is being used exclu
sively, as the water is too high in the
creeks for the tisli to rise at a fly. The
wheel trade is increasing rapidly in this
section, dealers claiming tnat they are
selling more than ever before known. The
wheelmen are engaged in the construction
of two bicycle paths, one of which will run
to Folsom, a distance of twenty-two miles,
and the other will go to Stockton; these
paths are being leveled with a scraper and
will be covered with cinders. Walter
LeaKe will go against the high school
record made by Bob Smith last week and
he will be paced by Conger and Welch on
a tandem. The try out of the Capital City
Wheelmen for the relay race will take
place to-morrow, and is exciting great in
terest and competition. Bob Smith, who
won the wheel race at the high school
tournament, is rapidly coming to the front
as a racer, ana great things are expected
from him in the future.
The big shoot of "the Spoonbills" takes
place a week from Sunday on the Eckhardt
grounds at Agricultural Park. There will
be $150 worth of cash and merchandise
prizes given by Eckhardt, Webb, McMur
chy and Beckert of the Olympic Club.
The Capitol Tennis Club has reorgan
ized and elected officers. It intends bold
ing a tournament of doubles in the near
future. Practice is now going on.
It is claimed that certain parties are
using dynamite in the creeks in the near
vicinity of Truckee for the purpose of tak
ing fish and the local fisherman are en
deavoring to find out the identity of the
vandals and promise them a warm recep
tion. Rutherford.
VOICES FROM RICHMOND
All Classes Are Clamoring for
an Improved Tramway
Service.
ENTHUSIASM IS GENERAL.
Expressions of Opinion From Several
Well- Known Residents and
Property-Owners.
Enthusiasm is rife in Richmond. On
the street corners, in the stores and at
home little is spoken of save the proposed
improvement in the tramway service. The
"owl line" project is generally regarded
with favor, but the hoped-for reduction in
fares from 5 cents to 3 or 'IYj, seems to be
the great topic.
"That's what we want," remarked Alex
ander MacSorley, the Avell-knovru sewer
contractor, when addressed on the matter
at his cozy home on Clement street, near
Seventh avenue. "The Call is a great
paper, but it seems greatesc when it takes
the part of those who are not able or do
not know how to fight their own battles.
Five cents to work aqd 5 cents back means
$3 a month, and if a laboring man has
children who go to school out of the dis
trict, or perhaps have to work as well as
he, each one has to nay the same sum
monthly.
"I know this amount may seem trivial
to those who are so fortunate as not to be
obliged to count dollars and cents, but to
the worKing man, who has a family, it
means a great deal. The reduction in
fares from 5 cents to 3 cents for a single
trip, or to 5 cents for two trips, would, in
my opinion, be a great benefit to all parties
concerned. The facilities of communica
tion with the business center being en
hanced, many people would live in Rich
mond, who at present prefer localities
where they do not have to depend alto
gether on the streetcars. On the other
hand, the railroads would suffer nothing,
but would rattier gain by the reduction,
seeing that the volume of their business
would be vastly increased.while the re
duction would directly benefit the families
of residents by making their expenses
lighter. The Call has gained many friends
in Richmond by its advocacy of this meas
ure and 1 hope the thing wiil work."
"I like the idea of a late streetcar ser
vice," commented Fritz Becker of the
Point Lobos Hotel. "There are times
when a man is liable to become belated.
He may be in fault. Perhaps he may
have met some convivial friend in whose
congenial company the hours have flown
by until midnight has struck. If he lives
in Richmond he finds himself in hot
water. Miles ana miles away from home,
he must hire a cab or walk or find some
place to sleep downtown. All the^e alter
natives are more or less objectionable.
The hiring of a cab involves the expendi
ture of an ordinary day's pay; the long
walk to Richmond would tire Ihe winged
feet of a Mercury, while if a man sleeps
away from home the subsequent explana
tions and misunderstandings are often
very tiresome, to say the least.
"The tramway people say that it is
necessary for tue machinery to be idle
during a portion of the night in order that
needed repairs may be made. This is un
doubtedly true in a measure, but repairs
do not have to be made every night, and
when necessary they can be made in a
very short time. The men would have
longer hours, but in all probability the
shifts would be rearranged so that no one
would be aggrieved. The late car service
would without a doubt bring many resi
dents to Richmond.
â¢â¢A gâ¢at number of men have to work
until late at night. Bartenders, police
officers, typesetters and others are often
kept busy until after midnight. These
men, as they generally sleep late in the
morning, would gladfy live in a quiet, re
tired section of the City if they could.
But when their work is over they are too
tired to walk any great distance, and if
there are no late cars they will make the
best of downtown rooms or flats, closing
their windows and sleeping in unventi
lated apartments in order to shut out the
noise and bustle of the busy street. A late
car would be a godsend to men thus situ
ated, and I am strongly in favor of the
'owl service.' "
WILL BE LET AS A WHOLE.
Mayor Sutro's Plan to Segregate the
Koof Contracts Rejected.
The City Hall Commissioners spent sev
eral hours yesterday trying to settle the
question as to whether they will let the
contract for putting a new roof on the City
Hall as a whole or in subdivisions, but
finally adjourned without having accom
plished their object.
Mayor Sutro was in favor of dividing
the work into four subdivisions, one for
copper-work, a second for slate, another
for brick and terra cotta work and the
fourth for iron and steel work. Auditor
Broderick opposed this method on the
| ground that there was no one person on
whom to fix the responsibility in case of
damage to the interior of the building
while the roof was off. He wanted some
one to give bonds and be responsible for
the entire matter. City and County At
torney Creswell also voted against tbe seg
regations when the Mayor moved that his
plan be adopted, and the matter went over
until next Tuesday, when Messrs. Brod
erick and Creswell will probably vote to
award the contract as a whole, and thus
settle the matter.

Away third at the start, Shields appa
rently coald not keep him going, and at
the end of a furlong was among the tail
enders. Amelia S headed the field into
the stretch, followed by Early Notice and
Diablita. Early Notice soon showed in
the lead, and won handily from Amelia S,
with Diablita third. The" time was 51 sec
onds. The last furloug Orestes ran like a
real racehorse, simply running over the
top of the horses in front of him, nnishine
a close tifth. Shields, who shines at his
best on a free-going horse of the Toano or
Service sort, proved a most unskillful nav
igator, or the colt would have been third,
and at that, had the distance been further,
there would have been but one horse in
the race. The race was no real test of the
youngster's ability, and at no distant date
he will redeem himself beyond all doubt.
Great interest was maniiested in Or
monde's son, and race-goeis turned out in
liberal numbers. The favorites were all
beaten. In the last race of the day the
finish between Kamsin and Toano was so
close tnat the judges were unable to separ
ate them, and decided it a dead heat, the
respective owners dividing the purse.
Ten went to the post in the opening five
and a half furlong selling dash. There
was no pronounced" choice in the betting,
Mamie Scott, Gracie S and Charles A all
going to the post at fours, with Ottyaua
but a ?hade higher. The latter mare
passed Gracie S in the stretch, and won
driving, a bead before the fast-coming
Don Caesar, a 12 to 1 shot.
A seven- furlong run decided under sell
ing conditions resulted in a clever win for
the epeedy Olive, with threes about her in
the rins?. Walter J and the 9to 5 favorite
Cabrilto raced away in front until well
into the stretch, when Walter J fell back.
Olive then challenged the first choice, and
outfooting him to the wire won by half a
length. Goodwin II and Service were left
at the post.
A splendid contest was furnished in the
mile Belling event. There were five
starters, with Rev del Bandidos ruling a
7 to 5 favorite around post time. Joe
Terry was a well-played 9 to 5 second
choice. The 10 to 1 outsider Schnitz cut

point he was leading by a length, with Joe
Terry second, lapped on by the favorite.
The outsider was soon passed, and in a
hard drive Jones had a shade the best of
little Frawley and got Joe Terry past ihe
stand a head in front.
The rifth race, a six-furlong selling
affair, proved rather an easy thing for
Meadow Lark, at 6 to 1 in the betting.
Easel, the 2 to 1 favorite, Clara Wilson
and Perhaps set a merry clip to the bend
for home, where all three of the trio began
showing distress signals. Flynn brought
Meadow Lark aiong, and takinz the lead
won easily by a scant head from San
Marco, the second choice, ridden by Coch
ran. Perhaps hung on gamely, finishing
a good third.
The Corrigan entry Kowalsky held sway
in the betting on the last event at six fur
longs, with 11 to 5 the ruling price. Toano,
at 16 to 5, and Kamsin, at o"4, were next in
demand. Toano was quickest away, and
after making all of the running was co!
--larsd the last few yards by Kamsin, and
the pair passed the wire in what the judges
decided to be a dead heat. The favorite
was a close third.

CRONAN`S AIMS OUTLINED
The New Superintendent of the
Hale & Norcross Makes
His Report.
Will B?gin Extracting Ore From tbe
Mine on Mondayâ Found It in
Good Condition.
James Cronan, the new mining superin
tendent of the Hale & Norcro33 mine at
Virginia City, has sent in his first official
repon to the board of directors of the
company in this City. The report was
written on April 9 and was on file in Sec
retary R. IT. Collins' office in the Stock
Exchange building yesterday.
The new superintendent only took office
a few days ago and makes his report in ac
cordance with the requirements of his po
sition. The regulations of the company
provide that he nmst report once a month
in writing as to the work performed dur
ing that period, the prospects of the mine
and tbe work contemplated during the
thirty days following. "This field the re
port briefly covers.
Superintendent Cronan reported that he
caused the Haie & N'orcross mine to be
opened on Wednesday morning last, and
on descending the shaft he found it in
good shape, requiring very little repairs.
The drifts leading to the etopes on the
975 level were somewhat broken and
caved, and it will probably require a few
days before the cars can run from the shaft
to "the scopes. After this has been done,
the extraction of ore will immediately
beein.
Mr. Cronan said that he had made ar
ranpements with the Dazet mill of Silver
City, three milts from the mine, to crush
the ore now in the bins, and which
amounts to some 210 tons. The mill will
be ready to begin crushing this ore about
Monday next. He also reported that he
had commenced hauling the ore to the
mill to dry.
Jeremiah Lynch, who was recently
elected president of the Hale Â«fc Norcross
Mining Company, accompanied Superin
tendent Cronan to Virginia City last week
and it is quite evident from the report
thus early received that they are wasting
no time in getting the mine in operation
again. It will be remembered that H. W.
Tangerroan was not permitted to assume
the office of superintendent though ap
pointed just after the election of the new
board of directors. He was not acceptable
to the miners for some personal reason
that has never been explained. Therefore
toe directors of the mine, wishing to
maintain harmony among the miners and
the superintendent and being particularly
anxious to have the mine reopened, tele
graphed to British Columbia for Cronan
and he accepted the offer made him and
came directly to San Francisco and entered
into a contract witn tbe company.
The new superintendent is one of the
best known and most skillful mining super
intendents on the coast. He has been for
years at the head of the working forces of
the largest mines in Idaho, Montana and
British Columbia. He has lately been en
paged in developing some of his own
claims in the new and thriving camp at
Kossland in the Canadian province. He
has had twenty years' experience as a min
ing superintendent.
THE SUNKEN BLAIRMORE
No Attempt Has Yet Been Made
to Recover the Six Dead
Sailors.
CAW CENSURES THE EESCTJERS
Angry Because His Vessel Was Dam
agedâA Court of Inquiry to
Investigate.
The tides ebb and flow over the snnken
Blairmore with her lost sailors, and a
geutle breeze blowing up Mission Bay is
the dying out of the southwest gale of
Wednesday's dreadful drama. Marine
surveyors and engineers aad curious vis
itors have gone down to the spot where
the long yellow hull shows a few feet of its
length above the ripple of the waves, but
nothing has disturbed the quietude of the
dead in their iron tomb.
The surviving seamen with the indiffer
ence of their class are looking forward to
life in another vessel, aud the skipper, be
reft of ship and crew, walks the water
front and tells the tale of disaster.
His brother captains looked from their
own dects at his topneavy vessel and
noted that nobl? craft's death wallow from
side to side like a wounded thing. The
master of a tug saw the doom-d fabric
bowing down to the impending strike and
offered an assistance that was refused.
Captain Caw sent his men into the dark
hold â that fatal caee â and turned his at
tention to the flower-pots on the quarter
deck that were being overturned by the
deep listing of hia imperiled vessel. Hu
manity, looking over the scene of a need
less disaster, asks, "Where doas a ship
commander's responsibility begin, and
when shall he be called to a strict account
ing for the hapless sailor-lives he sacri
fices?"
In a short time the rescued men will be
sailing on to other shipwrecks, the inci
dent all but erased from tneir minda,
while the captain will be fighting for the
preservation of his master's certificate be
fore a stern board of inquiry. A diver will
explore the dark, uncanny interior of the
submerged hull in a few days, and the
Coroner may learn just how the sailors
died. Possibly it will then be known
whether they were battered and crushed
under the hurl and heave and plunee of
the rocky ballast and flying baffle of the
deep hold or suffocated when the rising
water drove the life-sustaining atmosphere
from their sunken prison.
Among seafaring men there is conjec
ture as to the manner in which death fin
ished those luckless fellows. Captain Caw,
bowing under the weight of a calamity
that may ruin him professionally, is filled
with censure for the machinists who hu
manely trifd to release the perishing sea
men by chiseling through the steel skin of
the hu}l and speaks of the coming wrath
of the insurance companies."
"The men were dead," hesaya;"why cat
holes in my vessel? 1 '
In view of the master's own direful mis
fortune none cars now to censure his un
becoming reflection. But there is no
doubt that the Blairmore was cranky and
rolled freely in the brisk gusts of wind
that swept over the bay for the last few
weeks. The two or three hundred tons of
ballast could not balance the metal masts
and larger yards and the ponderous weight
of her top hamper.
The crew was uneasy, and sailors are
not, as a rule, men who are afraid of the
wind. They frequently sprang up from
sleep in alarm when the level decks
heaved upward at a dangerous an^le. But
the skipper swung at his anchorsâ a sailor
without fear â and his ship ig under the
waves. Six of his crew are there also, and
when he goes home the British Board of
Trade will ask why.
Superintendents Scott and Dickie of tbe
Union Iron Works, who pierced the Blair
more's side to release her crew, assert that
they heard the sounds of living people
within, and this encouraged and spurred
them on in their attempts at a rescue.
They carefully calculated from the beam
of the vessel and the depth of the water
that she was aground aud could sink no
deeper. The air escaping from the hull
and the tide rapidly rising warned them
to hasten. The water rolled into the hole
they had cut, failed the vessel and ail life,
if any within, was ended. Had the men
really been alive, clinging to floating
planks in the cold water of that darK hold,
bereft of one cheerine ray of light, filled
with the gloom of a despair that crushed
out hope, rising and falling witn the tide,
gasping in an atmosphere that was becom
ing more vitiated with the foulness of tbe
bilge and their own breath, when could
that great mass of metal have been moved,
lifted to have released them, and how
many hours conld they hare lived where
life was all but impossible?
The owners of the vessel have been ad
vised of the disaster by cable and an
answer will probably be received to-day,
fcpreckels & Co., who are the consignees,
will be given charge of the recovery of the
ship and will first recover the bodies from
the hull. At low water the hole cut in the
bilge is about two feet above the water,
consequently a diver may enter there and
search for the remains for a short time
each tide. Then the hole will be patched
up and the ta?k of rightine the ship will
begin. Powerful tugs and lighters, chains
and hawsers will be called into use for the
herculean labor and she will be pulled, if
possible, on an even keel.
Then the great mass must be kept in
that position till she is worked into shal
low water, where the steam pumps will do
the rest. Her lighter spars and yards
were in all probability broken and wrecked
when she toppled over, and when she ap
pears from the bay she will be a melan
choly spectacle. No time can be set for
the completion of the work, but its cost
will climb up into the tens of thousands of
dollars rapidly.
The surviving seamen are at the Sailors'
Home, where the British Consul has pro
vided them with temporary quarters and
necessary shifts of clothing. They, sailor
like, will simply wait for time and tide
that will brins them the next ship.
A wees from to-morrow a bay excursion
will be given in the steamer Caroline,
under the auspices of the British ship cap
tains in port, for the benefit of the family
of the dead mate, Thomas Ludgate. They
are represented to cÂ»e living near London,
England, and were dependent for support
on vis blender wages, wnich are now cut
off. Captain Leal of the Caroline will pro
vide everything needful for tbe trip around
the bay. ____________

BUTLER MILLER DISMISSED.
Mr. Franklin Loses Faith in His Ser
vant â No Prosecution.
Julius Franklin of the firm of Metzger &
Frankiia bas experienced a change of
heart toward his Dutler, Frank Miller.
Heretofore Mr. Franklin has espoused the
cause of Miller against the theory of Cap
tain L<>es, and has maintained a strong
belief in the innoc-nce of hi 3 butler.
It will be recalled that Captain Lees
accused Butler Miller of murdering a tramp
in order to win the confidence and grati
tude of his employer. The Coroner's jury
found that the tramp killed by Miller was
trying to rob Mr. Franklin's residence.
Yesterday Mr. Franklin diachareed Mil
ler, declaring that he could no longer trust
him. What caused this change or heart,
Mr. Franklin explained, was that Captain
Lees had convinced him, no* that Miller
murdered the tramp, but that Miller de
liberately lied to him about his (Miller's)
true name and identity.
"The only reason that I have cause to
distrust the butler," said Mr. Franklin,
"is that I have become conviuced that he
deliberately lied to me in several instances.
I know now that his name is not Miller,
but Effler. His father is not dead, but is
still alive. These facts were presented to
me by Captain Lees, and so positively that
i was forced to see the truth. Then I con
fronted Miller with my evidence and he
was forced to admit the truth.
"The fellow could give no explanation
of his desires to deceive me, nor do I
imagine he would desire to have his real
reasons revealed."
Before Mr. Franklin dismissed Miller he
notified both Captain Lees and District
Attorney Barnes, but both of these officials
declared they had no evidence upon which
Miller could be held.

Major Robbins of the 2nd Indiana State
guards, aide on General McKee's staff and
president of camp Gray, has been for two
years one of the most influential members
of the Indiana legislature and the author
of the famous Indiana Military Law of
1689.
Major Robbins was a very sick man up to
the time of taking Paine's celery com-
pound.
In proof of what that remarkable rem-
edy can do to make a sick person strong
and well, Major Bobbins' letter from In-
dianapolis best tells its own straightfor-
ward story.
"I was troubled with a torpid liver, con-
stipation and. the accompanying sallow
complexion, while my entire nervous sys-
tem was entirely deranged, and I was
greatly reduced In flesh. While in this
condition I was taken down with a very se-
vere attack of the grip, and was for a long
time confined to the house and my bed.
"I resorted to various medicines and ton-
ics, and under their temporary influence
made several attempts to resume my busi-
ness of traveling about in the interests of
A. Steffen, cigar'manufacturer of this city;
but relapse succeeded relapse, and I not
only tfas obliged to abandon my business,
but growing gradually worse, became ap-
prehensive of the ultimate result.
"At this juncture, mv mother-in-law,
who had used your remedy with gratifying
results, prevailed upon me to commence
taking Paine's celery compound, and it

gives me great pleasure to state that I at
once bezan to feel its beneficial effects.
"My appetite, which had failed me, re-
turned, my constipation ceased, and very
soon my liver became normal in its action.
Following this my sleeplessness and head*
aches ceased, and I began to gain flesh.
The insidious hold on me that the grip had
hitherto had was relaxed, aud I feu invig-
orated and strengthened, so I could resume
my vocation, and feel free from the lan-
guid, enervated feeling that had so long
possessed me.
"My friends were pleasantly surprised
with the change in my condition, and I
was only too happy to recommend Paine's
celery compound to such of my acquain-
tances as were suffering from any of the
complaints which Â«=o comolicated my case.
"Therefore, I again say I feel impelled by
a deep sense of gratitude to express how
much" l have been helped, for I now feel
and look like a new man."
Physicians who rely on Paine's celery
compound â as thousands of the most wide-
awake members of the profession are
doing, especially now that nearly every
one feels the neeu of a genuine spring rem-
edy â physicians know very well what that
lanzuor and that tired feeling means.
They know that debility to-day often re-
sults in nervous prostration "to-morrow,
unless the tired sysU-ru is quickly invig-
orated.
Ttiat is why ail over the country to-day
Paine's celery compound is beinjc taken by
the advice of skilled physicians. It is the
one remedy that physicians can conscien-
tiously call a genuine spring remedy.
Try it.

NEVF YORK MARKETS. '
Â§ Financial..
NEW YORK, N. V., April 10.â While specu
lation at the Stock Exchange to-day at intervals
was exceedingly dull, yet on the whole the deal
ings were. characterized by greater confidence and
strength than on any previous day of the week.
The advance in prices was quite general and the
improvement was mainly due to a change of senti
ment in regard to the probable action of Presi
dent Cleveland on the Cuban belligerency matter.
The fact that the foreign markets for American
securities are undisturbed by the action of the
House undoubtedly has a good effect. Still an
other factor in the day's speculation was the re
duction in the rates of serling exchange, which
prevented gold shipments by to-morrow's steamers 'â 
and renders exports of the yellow metal improb- :
able for at least fifteen days to come.

ment in prices by attacking American Tor I

without effective support. Tobacco was sold down i
from 841 10 828 8 . and closed at a mere fractional
recovery. I>esp:ie the selling of tobacco the gen

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 10.â This being the
eventful day on which the Government issues Its
' monthly manifesto regarding the crop of wheat,
wheat.'in recognition of the importance of the oc
casion, remained in a sttte verging on inanition
luring the most of the session. The market was
pretty well evened up: yesterday, and new risks
were not considered wise until the report is out of
the way. There was a moderate sculping trade,
with prices early holding quite linn at some ad
vance over the final quotations of yesterd ty.
Liverpool cables were not as weak as expected,
whi h probably availed a little in supporting â¢
values. Chicago receipts were 12 cars and the
Northwest had 24. No comparison with last Fri
day or with the corresponding day last year can be
made, both being holidays. Withdrawals from store
were 116,200 bushels. The Weather Bureau pre
dicted rain for all parts of the winter Wheat sec
tion, which was encouraging to the believers in a
good and large crop.
. Prices became easier as the session advanced,
and after noon declined below yesterday's close.
Closing Continental cable* were'iower. Export
clearances were moderate at 228,663 bushels. The
close showed a rally from the Inside, with last
quotations considerably under the outside for the
session. May Whent opened from 6b'@fi6yÂ«c, de
clined to 65'."ac, closin; at 66"..c, YbÂ© l Ac higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 2J cars.
Corn was not altered particularly from what it i
has been in the . immediate past. No news was
looked for and non" was received, so that traders
were thrown on sympathy with wheat for a mo
tive. Receipts were 189 cars, 21 less than esti
mated. There were no withdrawals from store.
Liverpool cables were quiet and unchanged. Ex
port clearances were light at 67.607 bushels. May
corn opened at 30i/8C and sold at 30c. where it
closed, unchanged from yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow are 170 cars.
Oats opened with an improvement equivalent to
the trivial loss of yesterday, maintaining a fair de
gree of strength and firmness until wheat showed
a declining tendency, when prices In this market
also eased away. Business was dull and slow. Re
celpU were 135 cars, and 154,690 bushels were
taken from store. There was a trifling recovery
before the close, May showing a gain over yester
day of Vs c Estimated receipts for to-morrow 150
cars. â  â â â - - â¢â¢ â â

PROVISIONSâ It was the same old story of a
-Â: hog market and a consequent decline in
'product to-day. No relief was derived from wheat
or the other grains. Business was generally active,
the session being punctuated with occasional busy
moments. Pork recuperated somewhat during the
latter part of the session, closing 2Y 2 @6c over
yesterday. May lard closed unchanged and May

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N.Y., April 10.â G. Dun & Co.
to-morrow will say In their weekly review of trade:
- . Failures for the past week have been 209 in the
United States against -07 last > year, and 33/ In
Canada against 27 last year. The volume of j busi- '
ness has not ,on the â  whole increased, nor have
prices appreciably advanced since "April' l, when
the range for all commodities was the lowest ever
Known in this* country. Brea stuffs ana Iron
products have risen slightly, but some other arti
cles have declined, and the root of the matter is
that demand for consumption is still - below I expec
tations. - '-.â ..â â  .-,â ;.,-' , ,â -â ..-;..â  â :..;.,. ,T.
The jury done to winter wheat by storms and
frosts at the West would appear from reports to
have . been considerable. v Remarkably low : esti- ,
mates of condition ; are published ' by some ' State â 
authorities, and, while there may be the customary
exaggerations, there has evidently been much
actnal loss. ;- The reports 'are not more gloomy
.than a year ago, and the quantity of wheat which
has ' come â  from farms :â  since August 1 has been â¢
163,781,594 bushels, against 129.075,460. for the
same da. last year. â¢â¢â  Stocks have been extremely
dull, and ye: railroad traffic Is â  heavy. â  Reports of
earnings have not improved; tueMarch statement,'
covering practically all the roaas usually report- \
ing, shows an increase of 4.2 per cent over last

and' is less satisfactory than returns of January or
February. *"â â .' ':. â 'â¢ :;â â "â¢ â¢:â 'â¢.â â â â â¢. " : vyZ-C--' â -'â¢'â  : "â <â <:
: Domestic business â 'â  reflected .by clearing-house
exchanges â¢ continues about 20 per cent, smaller
than in 1893, though slightly better than last year,
the occurrence or Good Friday â¢ accounting exact
comparison. Foreign â  trade shows a decrease; of
nearly 10 per cent in exports for the week, though ;
as much increase in March, while imports sain
nearly 20 per cent, though in March the decrease
was 14 per cent. â  The billet pool and oth-r combi
nations have raised prices of pig iron and steel,
but as yet finished products have trained scarcely
anything, nor has the demand for them increased.
. â¢ The output April 1 was 190,281 .tons weekly,
against 189,583 March 1: but reports of stocks un
sold increased 68,168 tons in. March, or 13,132
weekly, and there is besides the unknown accumu
lation of the great steel concerns. " Prices for Lake
i ore are announced, as expected, $1 10 higher than
last year, and the coke combination makes no re
duction, but gradu lly lessens output. While the
purchases of plgiron, to anticiDate future wants,
have been heavy, consumption is - but moderate.
Minor metals are dull, but lead is weaker at 3.05 c
on forced sales West. â¢ â¢ --V.. . . . :
' Prices of boots and shoes do not change, though
leather and hides are a little stronger at Chicago,
receipts being small. Wool is weaker, with sales
for the week the smallest for many months. Prices
tend lower except for fine washed fleece, and man
ufacturers are rapidly reducing production. ' There
is a fair demand in the dress goods branch, but it
is estimated that not 3.40 per cent of the men's
wear machinery is at work. There have also been
cotton mills stopping or reducing time ; this week.
Further reduction in shirting prints to the lowest
point ever touched failed to increase the. demand'
noiiceably. . â : . ' - . â  '"â¢y--; *,â ;"';

COAL â Harrison's circular says: ;. "During the
week there have been six arrivals from the coast
colleries, with 9984 tons of Coal: from Australia
and Swansea 9646 tons. The quantity at band for
the week is about 8.00 tons less than the amount
consumed, hence stocks In thÂ«, yard am beins
gradually diminished. â¢ There iis , no | change (of
values perceptible and trade is fair.- The inclement
weather . the past few days has created a demand
fur domestic uses, thus aiding the retail trade, and
the orders for steam purposes run along about the
same, as the weather cuts no figure in this line of
consumption. The question daily discussed among
Coal importers is the possible ; spread of the strike
among the Newcastle Coal producers. â¢â  Nothing
definite has so far developed itself except the re
port by cable that two ;of â ; the â¢ colleries -may
suspend their operations temporarily." Welling

Plans for a $20,000 Structure Sub
mitted by Architect Wright
of A'armda.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 10.â The con
vention of the Central California Library
Association was held at the new City Hall
this evening. Nearly all the members
were present and tne council-rooms were
well filled. The subject discussed was:
"Pulpit, Press and Public Library as
Means of Irfluencing Public Opinion and
Elevating Humanity." The speakers were
Rev. George R. Dodson of ihe First I'ni
tarian Church, Editor T. G. Daniells of the
Alameda Argu?, Superintendent D. J.
fullivan of the Alameda Public School
Department and Principal Ergo Majors of
the Alameda High School.
Rev. Mr. Dodson spoke in a general
vray and did not argue that the pulpit was
a greater power than any other in shaping
public opinion. He said that public
opinion and social condition are products
of numerous factors. Humanity is a vast
organism, and a change in one of its parts
reverberates tnrough the whole. Progress
is the result of many forces and influences
in human society. The day has gone by
when the preacher and schoolmaster were
the only educated men in the community.
They no longer have anything like a
monopoly ot intellectual and moral in
fluence. The speaker continued :
The preacher especially is arlected by the
change. It is not that he "has become less, but
that other factors in social improvement have
gained In importance. The jrinted book is
one of the greatest civilizing acents in history
Through It the stimulating and helpful ideas
of the nnest minds are sown broadcast through
ous the world. It is largely through books tnat
the crowd is being transformed into the
people.
Thanks to Gutenberg, a new and enlightened
I'emos is appearing in the world. The Public
Library is a great social factor.
The ideas that are to-day making their way
in the public mind will inevitably find appli
cation. Venerable and age-long" errors are
disappearing, not so much because they are
being argued out of existence as because the
I-Ã¼bhc ih becoming too well informed to retain
them. With enlargement of mental norizon
inevitably come wider sympathies. Books and
reading promote the sentiment of the brother
hood 01 man.
Said Victor Hugo: "Henceforth all human
advancement will be accomplished by swell
ing the legions of those who read. For the
desire to read being a train of powder, once
lighted it will not stop; and this, combined
with the simplification of hand labor by ma
chinery, and with the increased leisure of
man, the body less fatigued, leaving the mind
freer, vast appetites for thought will spring up
in all brains; the Insatiable thirst for knowl
edge and meditation will become more and
more the human preoccupation; low places
will be deserted for high placesâ an ascent na
tural to every growing intelligence. People
will taste the noble, and, once tasting it, they
will never be satiated; men will make the
beautiful their food, because the refinement
of minds augments in proportion to their force ;
and a day will come when the fullness of civil
ization, making itself manifest, those moun
tain tops, Lucretius, Dante, Shakespeare, for
ages almost deserted and visited only by the
Felect few, will be crowded with intelligences
seeking their food upon the heights."
While the press is not intentionally philan
thropic and leaves largely unused its magnifi
cent opportunity to direct public opinion in
the right way, it must nevertheless be credited
with a. vast amount of good. Indeed, much of
the best work done for the cause of humanity
is performed without intention and uucon
eciously. The newspapers tend to lift men
above provincialism. They make us citizens of
the world, interesting us in the thoughts,
labors and the life of other nations and peo
ples. The result is a feeling, constantly grow
ing more profound, of the oneness and solid
arity of the race. The brotherhood of man is
already something more than a phrase, and
for this we are considerably indebted to the
jjress.
Every influence that tends to the enlighten
ment oi the people reacts beneficially upon the
pulpit. A reading public necessitates an edu
cated ministry. Libraries and schools force the
preacher upward. A candle could give light iv
medieval darkness. To-day there must be in
telligence in the pulpit or the pews will be
empty.
On the other band, it is a very great help to
the minister to have his people read, for he
can then teach them things that were other
wise impossible. The New Testament repre-
Bents Jesus as saying to his disciples, "I have
many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
bear them now." â¢
No wonder, for they were mostly illiterate
peasants. In proportion as people learn are
they able to bear what is said to them. Happy
the minister whose people are always ready
lor the highest word he is able to speak.
The Dress, the pulpit and the library are to
be regarded as co-operating and mutually
helpful factors in the elevation of humanityâ
that is, in its salvation, for salvation is coming
to be regarded as something progressive as a
historic process. It is almost synonymous
with education, for this word, with all the
deep meaning now being put into it, is amone
the very greatest that we have. 5
The work of the minister is becoming grad
ually and necessarily special and partial. B lt is
his to develop the sentiments of men to inter
pret life in the light of the best thought and of
the noblest moral ideal. He should be able io
make people feel that all great political and so
cial question* are also moral questions. He
may render a social service by bringing to the
support of practical reforms the tremendous
â¢ancufying and sustaining power of the moral
and religious feelings. His work is not to in
vestigate and settle questions of economic and
political science; it is rather to inspire a great
love for. confidence In and devotion to truth.
Enubkd by the speciMl opportunity given
him to Wi'iime acquainted with the best
thoughts of his lime, he niny help his fellow
men to revise tlieir conceptions, to readjust
their minds us science grows, ntntthus fit them
to live in the. modern world. The preccher's
work, though" general, is, if properly per
formed, of immense value. Though partly in
tellectual, it is mostly in the region of senti
mentâan<i In the human world sentiment
plays a very great part. The press, the pulpit,
the library and the school are nil working for
the sam< endâ the education of humanity, and
the good one does is a help to all. Leaving
aside all comparison as to respective merit,
cannot each feel that it is enough to have a
part in helping the world in its onward and
upward way?
Mr. Daniells spoke particularly of the
press, and tliese are among the things that
j he said :
Less than 100 year ago the newspaper was rot
much of a factor in political, religious or social
life. It was in embryo. It was rather a de
spised avenue of intelligence. Its mission
! seemed to be to promulgate essays on abstract
subjects written by over-serious men, to give
the light to poetic effusions, and to tell news
that was already Known. In appearance it
was undersized, smudgy, badly printed and
badly arranged. There" was no attempt at
editorial expression, and not a glimmer of
that news feature that is now developed to
such a superlative degree.
Probably each of you who have to do with
that other great modern institution, the public
library, is able to find in your respective
archives copies of journals printed 100 years
ago that fully bear out my idea. I remember
: one such ancient journal that has been exten
sively reproduced in fac-simile. It is the Ulster
Gazette, and it contains an account of the
death and burial of George Washington. The
events aescribed were two weeks old and the
description was perfunctory and overfulsome.
\ Not a single one of what we would in this day
consider to be the news features of the incident
was elaborated. Besides this great historic
incident the paper contained very little. There
wns a smattering of European news, obtained
I from the captain? of ships that had recently
arrived, and which related to events three
1 months old.
Napoleon was conquering Europe at that
timeâ amazing the world and terrifying the
; ereat rulers of the earthâ yet his doings were
considered In a few vague lines, a tenth as
much as we now devote to the revolt of an
African chief.
From the Ulster Gazette to the great news
paper of to-day iess than a century of time in
tervenes, but it is a vast cycle of progress. The
marvelous stride made in mechanics â the
miracle of the telegraph, the telephone and of
electricityâ these iv some decree have relation
to the great advancement of the press; bat
' neither In itself is more wonderful than the
progress of the press.
In round numbers there are 20,000 periodi
! cals published to-day in the United States.
There is a publication of some kind for every
3100 of population. Twenty-five years ago
there was only one publication for every BSOO
of population. Very recent inventions in
printing appliances have s-erved to enormously
increase the output of printed matter, espe
cially of newspapers, ana the cost has beeu re
duced to a smali fraction of that which pre
vailed in the olden time.
The newspaper of a third or quarter of acen
: tury ago wielded its influence through its edi
torial columns. That was the era of personal
ity in newspaper making; it was the golden
period of the great editor. Some of you know
from personal observation of the time, and all
of you from history and tradition of the mighty
men who molded public opinion in that stir
ring epoch. Horace Greeley stands forth a
luminous figure in American journalism as
well as in American history. To speak of
'â . Greeley in that day was instantly to 6Uggcst
; the New York Tribune. To refer to the New
: York Herald was to call to mind the elder Ben
n'.ct. The Evening Post and William Cullen
Bryant were synonymous, and the Louisville
Journal was known because George D. Prentice
I edited it. There is just one survival of this
old-time rule, and that is in Charles A. Dai-.a
; of the New York .Sun.
The press of to-day has popularized scientific
i subjects. It instantly seizes upon the latest
discoveries and deductians ana places them
i before the people. It is the only up-to-date
encyclopedia. Mankind does not have to await
trie tardy appearance of books embodying the
discovery of new truths to inform themselves
thereof. The deep things that are profitable
to know are simplified and made comprehen
| sible in the modern newspaper. It is not only
' a vast mirror of news, but it is a compendium
j of science, of philosophy, of usÂ»ful knowledge,
of the innumerable incidents and transactions
i that illustrate human life and afford a better
insight of nature. And the modern newspaper
brightens life with its quips. The ancient
newspaper was a very solemn affair. The old- j
time journal was prosy and over-dignified, but |
the moderu journal scintillates with humor, â¢
giving to life a brighter side. And this with
, out in any way detracting from its more seri
ous features. That is a point that should be
taken into full account, for the man who makes
another man laugh does him a service of value.
The complaint is often made that the mod
ern newspaper is remorseless and that it ruth
lessly invades the home, and with a brutal
hand lays bare the private lives and affairs of
men, v.ithout justice or reason. This in man;
; instances seems 10 be a well-founded coni
! plaint, and yet the very fact that the jr it la
such a seeming juggernaut is its chief lever in
the great work of elevating humanity. I shall
not siop to defend the press for what appears
' to be a lack of discrimination in the publica
tion of personal matters that sometimes need
; lessly wound and injure, but I make bold to
! say that no power in government, no usage or
i custom of society has such restraining force
I on wrong-doing as newspaper publicity. The
fenr of getting into the newspapers has pre
vented many tt crime and kept many a man
| straight. And it is not a. fear of being
, scourged by the newspHpors, but of having: the
â  unvarnished facts told.
Superintendent Sullivan spoke extem
poraneously on the relations of the library
'. to the public school, insisting on the value
!of the library. Ergo Majors, member of
' the High School, read a clever history of
i libraries, from the famous Alexandria col-
I lection to the libraries in every town to-
I day.
J. C. Rowell, librarian of the State Uni
versity, presided; Librarian Jellingsof the
Mechanics' institute in San Francisco
acted as secretary.
The next meeting will be held in Stan
ford University.
At this convention one of the features
of special interest to the librarians was the
i discussion of the plans for the library that
J6 to be built. One of the designs submit
ted is by Architect G. Alexander Wright,
who proposes ft classic structure to cost
$20,400. riiia plan is of a building to con
tain about 5500 square feet of floor space
on the first lloor. so arranged that a gal
lery all around 18 feet wide and 11 feet
high might be easily added at any future
time, if required for library purposes or
public museum. This gallery would con
tain about 30t)0 squ.irc feet of ttoor space
and be lighted by circular windows.
The dimensions would be 74 by HO feet.
A 12-foot basement would afford 6320
square feet of floor space, tnough Mr
Wright believes that tliere should be no
basement, preferring to dispense with the
long flight of entrance steps. The library
room would be 25 feet high. Brick would
be the material used in the construction,
the principal elevations to be faced with
selected buff pressed brick.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL U, 1896.
MOTT`S CHANCE IS LOST
He Might Have Been Mayor
of Oakland for Two
Whole Days.
* _____
DAVIE TAKES A QUIET TRIP.
Nobody Knew He Was Out of the
City Till Just Before His
Return.
Oakland Office Sat? Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 10. )
Mayor Davie has been out of the city for
three days and no one was aware of his
absence till a few hours before his return.
This morning he was in his office as usual.
During Mr. Davie's trip to Merced a
great opportunity was offered President
Mott of the Council to attach his signa
ture to a large number of requisitions that
the Mayor docs not favor. The charter
provides that when the Mayor is away the
president of the Council shall act for him.
There is no other qualification necessary
than that the Mayor "be out of the city"
to place the power in the hands of the pres
ident of the Council.
President Mott would like to hasten
much of the business that the Mayor does
not favor and he could have done it easily
had he known that the Mayor was out of
the city.
But President Mott did not know it. nor
was anybody else aware of it till this
morning. There are requisitions waiting
the official signature for clothes and blank
ets for cold prisoners, for lumber for side
walks, for books for the city engineer and
! for numerous other things that the Mayor
! does not consider necessary, and by rush
â â¢ ing into the office and signing them Presi
: dent Mott would have earned the thanks
!of a small multitude. Several ordinances
! are also needing a signature to render
j them operative and Mr. Mott would have
! supplied it had he only known of the op-
I port unity to do so.
"Mott missed the opportunity of his
life," said the Mayor this morning. "He,
could have been a bona tide Mayor fora
few nours, and I guess that is as near to
the office as he will ever get. It is rather
amusing to notice how much a man is
missed who attends to hia business. It is
known that 1 am at the City Hall during
j office Hours, and as soon as I am missed
i there is a hunt for me. I to.d my secre
tary that I should be away for a couple of
i days, and as I do not consider Mr.'Mott
â  competent to manage the Mayor's office
i even for a day, I thought the best inter
| ests of the city would be served by saying
! nothing. I was in communication with
I my secretary, so that I was kept informed
of all that was going on. I'm sorry for
I Mott, but It's too late now, and I cannot
j conceive how he could have lost such a
i chance to shine."
A few days ago President Mott as a com
mittee of one reuorted to the Council and
reflected on the Mayor's methods, and so
there is no spare love or courtesy between
them.
Mayor Davie says that there is only one
| theme of discussion in the Merced district
| and that is the Valley road. The farmers
are a unit in its favor, he says, and it is
| refreshing to get into a district which can
' feel independent of the Southern Pacific.
A Heavy Mortgage.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 10.â The Farm
ers' Loan and Trust Company of Pan Fran
cisco to-day filed an answer "in the suit of
the Pacific Improvement Company vs.
James A. Way mire ct al., to/ determine
their several interests to the marsh land
' lying on the south of the estuary between
Oakland and Alameda. The company
claims in its answer a lien upon 4712 acres,
â  an undivided interest in the lauds; also
upon a specific tract within the exterior
! limits of the lands, whicli is also claimed
Iby the South Pacific Coast Railroad
! Company, anu mortgaged to the Farmers'
Loan and Trust Company.
These marsh lands are set forth as a por
tion of tne property covered by a mortgage
made by that company July 1, 1837, secur
: ing the aggregate sum of $5,- r >OU,OOO, cvi
: deuced by 5500 bonds in the sum of $1000
; each, running for nfty years from above
! date. The same mortgage covers as well
i the entire main line, sidetracks, fran
i chises, rights of way, station buildings,
I ferryboats and all other property of the
Soutn Paciiic Coast Railroad Company.

joke which they perpetrated upon him.
Yesterday they telephoned Goldson from

SAVING A BOARD BILL.
Aged Solomon Baumgartea Find* Some
Satisfaction In Serving
Time.
Oakland Office San Fhaxcisco Call.)
00S Broadway, April 10. f
Solomon Bnunigarten, wealthy, aged,
the father of eleven children and the hus
band of a young wife, is in the City Prison,
where he will remain for 100 days unless
he pays $100 fine. As he has said that
money is dearer to him than life he will
probably serve his time.
Baunijrarten was an object of great in
terest as he sat in the dock this morning
and heard Judge Wood pronounce sen
tence. No one had any sympathy for him
and even his own people have been advis
ing him to act like a man toward his
young wife and her two-week-old infant.
The old man's attorney made a long plea
for li is client, but without avail.
The prosecution showed that Baumgar
ten was possessed of considerable money
but that he is too miserly to spend a cent
unless absolutely compelled. He has re
fused to furnish bis wife and child with
provisions and clothing and has said that
jail is welcome to him because it will save
him Ins board.
Judge Wood spoke very plainly to the
old prisoner. He said that his attorney's
plea only showed that the old man should
have been prosecuted years ae;o for starv
ing his family.

A committee consisting of ex-Judge J.

accompanied him to this city.
Rev. Mr. Jefferson is a fine looking man

readily with all he approaches. In con- j
versation he said:
"I never realized befoie how great a j
country the United States really is. The j
overland trip was very pleasant, but I was

began to descend the mountains and tind ]

EUREKA SHINGLE RATES.
They Have Been Placed at 60 Cents to
Chicago.
Word was received by the Southern
Pacific Company yesterday that the con
necting roads to Chicago had agreed upon
a 60 cent per 100 rate on shingles from
Eureka to Missouri and Mississippi River
points and to Chicago in carload lots of
24,000 pounds. This rate will go into
effect on the 20th inst., and will place
Eureka on an equality with the Puget
Sound ports which are in competition
with the Eureka product in the East. The
60-ccnt rate is the same as prevails from
San Francisco and reeular California ter
minals to Chicago. This important con
cession to Eureka was brought about
through the intervention of Traffic Mana
ger Curtis of the Traffic Association.
STUDENTS STAGE STRUCK
Berkeley Collegians Will Put On
Their Second Play This
Week.
A LIQUOR-DEALER MISSING.
It Will Bj Instructor L. D. Syle's
Adaptation of Congreve's Comedy
" Love for Love."
BERKELEY, Cal., April 10.â Some of
the Berkeley students have apparently
become stage-struck, judcing from the
intense interest they have directly taken
in theatrical performances recently. On
last Wednesday evening the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity presented a well-written
three-act farce-comedy composed by one
of the members, and to-morrow evening
another company of student amateurs
will present at Shattuck Hall Instructor
L. Dv Pont Syle's adaptation of Con
greve's "Love For Love." Congreve's
masterpiece has never before been played
in California, though it was staged several
years ai:o at Harvard. Mr. Syle has
adapted the orisrinal to modern tastes, but
the slight changes which he has wrought
have in no way detracted from the bril
liancy and humor peculiar to Congreve
and his day.
A feature of the performance will be the
grand and stately minuet. The costumes
of the performers will be magnificent in
the extreme. The comedy is replete with
bright conversation and spicy dialogue.
The play runs something after this
fashion: Valentine, son of Sir Sampson
Legend, and a young man of good tastes
and impulses, falls unfortunately into
debt as a result of frequenting the London
chocolate houses. He applies to Sir
Sampson for assistance, but is refused un
less he agrees to sign ever his inheritance
to his younger brother. Valentine is in
love with Angelica, an heiress, and to get
square with the world again he agrees to
the paternal mandate. Angelica appears
to have no affection for her adorer, and in
order to make some impression upon her
he feigns madness.
Meanwhile Sir Sampson becomes
smitten with Angelica and gives her his
bond. Of course she is present when the
time comes for Angelica to relinquish her
inheritance. The lawyer announces that
Valentine's signature will count for |
naught, as he is out of his mind. The j
erring son ceases his deception, Angelica !
destroys the bond and the hero captures j
the heroine.
In Instructor Syle's adaptation the char
acters are essentially the same as those in:
the original. The play has Deen reduced
from five to four acts, with one or two
other changes of minor note. The cast is
drawn from among the most talented stu
dents in the university, who have been
practicing on the play for the past three
months.
L. D. Syle has had complete charge of
the affair, having been introduced by him
self. It will be put on both to-morrow
and next Monday evenings at Shattuck
Hall, and will be in the nature of a benefit
to the English lepartment library of the
university and the Eastern track team.
Following is the cast: Sir Sampson Le
gend, father of Valentine and Ben, Frank
Dunn ; Valentine, the hero, fallen under
his father's displeasure by his expensive
living, Willard D. Thompson; Scandal,
his friend, a free speaker, George D.
Kierulff; Ben, Sir Sampson's younger
son, an officer in the navy, Ray Sherman ;
Foresight, a wealthy astrologer, uncle to
Angelica, Frank T. Bioletti; Jeremy,
Valentine's valet, Charles E. Fryer; Trap
land, a scrivener, and Buckram, a lawyer,
E. T. Stadtmuller; Angelica, an heiress,
Miss Jessie M. Anderson; Mrs. Foresight
si-coud wife of Foresight, Miss Emily P.
fthin?; Mrs. Flippant, her sister, Miss
Centennia Barto; Miss Prue, daughter of
Foresight by a former wile and brong >t up
in the country. Miss Alice Marchubout;
nurse to Miss Prue, Mrs. Syle; Jenny,
maid to Angelica, Miss Syle.
A Swell Dancing Party.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 10.â What was
generally considered to be one of the most
successful and swellest dancing parties
ever held at the University of California
was given to-night in Harmon gym
nasium. Many well-known society people
from the prominent dancing clubs on
both sides of the bay were present. The
gymnasium was beautifully decorated for
the occasion and brilliantly illuminated
with electric liehts. A feature of the even
ing was the dancing of three figures of the
german. This was an innovation in
dancing at the university, a german never
before having been introduced. Those
under whose auspices the ball to-night
was given are hopeful that the german
will in the future form a feature of all the
University of California parties.
Oniy 200 invitations were issued, so that
the hall was not overcrowded, as ha 9 been
the case with several of the recent parties
in the "gym." Several of the Greek letter
fraternities threw open their chapter
houses for the reception of guests who had
come from a distance. The german was
led by Clinton R. Morse and Miss Marie
Mes3er, Howard P. Veeder and Miss
Mamie Stubbs and Alpheus F. Williams
and Miss Flora Dean. The three figures
of the germ an which were danced were
the grand right and left, figure eight and
debutantes' march. The german was not
introdnc d, however, until late in the
evening, most of the time having been
given up to assembly dancing.
Following were the patronesses:
Mrs. Martin Kellogg, Mrs. Ben Morgan, Mrs.
W. F. McNutt and Mrs. John Glascock.
Among the professors and their wives
who were present were:
President and Mrs. Martin Kellogsr, Professor
and Mrs. Charles Mills Gayley, Professor and
Mrs. Thomas K. Bacon, Professor and Mrs. E.
B. Clapp, Professor and Mrs. C. C. Plehn and
Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Wilson.

Fonzo Skips Out.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 10.â A pecu
liar termination to the Fonzo liquor case
i occurred in Justice James' court yesterday
; morning, Fonzo was charged with selling
; liquor within a mile of the university in
! violation of the State "mi!e-iimit" law.
When the case was called Mr. Fonzo ap-
I peared with his attorney, M. U. Chapman
of Oakland. After an endeavor to secure
a postponement of the case, Mr. Chapman
made once more the oft-denied motion to
dismiss the case on the ground that the
court is no court at all, being illegally
created by a law of the State Legislature.
The motion was once more denied and
Chapman and hisclientleft the courtroom.
After a moment's consultation aside the
two left for Oakland and Fonzo has not
been seen since.
Justice James ordered an adjournment
until 1:30, at which hour court convened
again, but the accused was still absent and
his bonds were declared forfeited. The
bonds were for $500, and the sureties were
J. Raspillar and John E. Boyd.
The unexpected and unprecedented
move made by Attorney Chapman and his
client has aroused much discussion. The
only theory advanced in exulanation of
their action is a desire to speedily secure a
decision on the question of whether or not
Berkeley's justice court is a properly
created legal tribunal. At a late hour this
evening Fonzo had not been found. He
will be arrested as soon as located, and it
is thought that the question of whether
the Berkeley court is a legal one or not will
be tested by habeas corpus proceedings.
Marshal Lloyd had a number of wit
nesses ready to testify in the case, and
says that he had conclusive evidence
against the defendant.
Plan for a New Church.
BERKELEY, â  Cal., April 10.â Rev.
George A. 3wan, rector of St. Mark's
Church, has suggested a novel plan for the
construction of a new church building.
Rev. Mr. Swan's plan is for the erection of
the church by degrees as the parish is able
to pay for it. According to his scheme, a
large temporary structure would first be
erected for immediate use, trie only per
manent part of it being the chancel,"which
would be the nucleus of a building to be
erected piecemeal, the temporary edifice
being superseded oy section after section
of the projected permanent place of wor
ship.
The present St. Mark's Church has a
seaiing capacity cf about 350. The Rev.
Mr. Swan wants a church with seats for
seven or eight hundred.

Some time afro George W. Arper indorsed a
$23 note on which lie has not yet been paid,
the signers being H. S. Turner, A. J. Gregg and

who cannot write his own name and read the
constitution in English.
DUFFY'S MANY ESCAPES.
It Is Sairt He Is Now Being Harbored
by Firemen in San Francisco.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 10. âDeputy
Sheriff Al White charjjee the San Francisco
Fire Department with harboring a crimi
nal who is a fugitive from justice and in
terfering with officers. Detective Kiuger
charges that a policeman refused to make
an arrest of a fugitive from justice, whom
he pointed out, without a warrant.
These charges all grow out of the escape
of four prisoners fiom the county jail some
time last fall by cutting through the roof.
One of these was Thomas J. Duffy, charged
with bigamy. White says he saw Duffy in
San Francisco, but he fan into a tire en
gine-house and the occupants refused to
allow him to search the premises. Duffy
was formerly a member of the San Fran-
Cisco Fire Department, and White says he
believes they are harboring him at present.
To-day his mother-in-law called on
Prosecuting Attorney Melvin and de
manded tiie return of the marriage license
of Duffy and her daughter, which had
been used as evidence against him. Sho
did not get the marriage license.
In 1869 much interest was excited in
London by the sessions of a deaf and dumb
debating club.

Witticisms at U'liai lVrith Hall
Last Night.
The San Francisco Scottish Thistle Club
pave a very successful concert and ball last
night at B'nai B'ritb Hall, on Eddy street,
which was profusely decorated with red,
white and yellow bunting, Chinese lan
terns and American flags.
Over 1000 persons were in the main ball
and the gallery during the musical pro
gramme, and a large number of them re
mained for the ball, which began soon
after 10 o'clock and continued until an
early hour this morning.
Probably the best-received number on
the programme was the Clara Schuman i
ladies' quartet, whose well-trained voices
and attractive appearance called forth the
most enthusiastic applause. But the
sailor's hornpipe, danced by pretty little
Mias F. C. Coulie, the 10-year-old daughter
of (he royal chief, was a dainty exhibition
of childish grace and rnerite"d its hearty
encore. The little girl was dressea in
i-ailor coeturne, consisting of white duck
troupers and a blouse, saiJor r-ap and shoes
oi j>ale-blue material, a combination thai
showed off to advantage a luxuriant growth
of blonde, wavy hair that hung loosely
down her hack.
All the vocal numbers were followed by
encores.
Following is the programme in full:
Overture. Scottish Medley, I. P. R. Teven
dale; words of welcome, Koynl Chief J. I*.

THE TAX ROLL
MILLIONS SHORT
Assessment Data in Pos
session of the Grand
Jury.
LIGHT ON FRANCHISES.
Deposits and Securities Valued
at $108,000,000 Listed for
$6,000,000.
SOME STARTLING FIGURES*
Carl W. yon Tiedeman and Harry
Wilkins Indicted for Perjury.
Frank Miller's Case.
Several members of the Grand Jury
ptrenuousfv denied yesterday that any de
linquencies or misconduct had been found
in the Assessor's Office, or that any inves
tigation of That office in particular had
beÂ«n directed. It is (known, however, that i
the Grand Jwry corruuittee on Assessor, I
Auditor and Treasurer, of which John
Landers is chairman, and to which G. H.
TTmbsen and Theodore F. Payne belong,
paid a visit secretly to John D. Siebe and
juade inquiries concerning the general
management of the Assessor's office. It is
eurmised, moreover, that this committee
Is in possession of information which is
Tery important, if not startling.
Members of the Grand Jury gener
ally are exceedingly reticent witu
Â«verything but denial, yet it was obvious
yesterday that John EL Burke had been
called as a witness by the jury. It is
?inown that he gained a great deal of pub
>lic notice some sixteen years ago in a per
bistent effort to have Assessor JJadlaru list
lor taxation a vast deal of property which
not then been assessed. The result of
vthe agitatioc which he then instituted
jÂ»nd brought before the Grand Jury was
*the creation of a supplemental assessment
.roll of $90,000,000. The valuation of the
pas company's franchise was increased
$1,000,000 to $0,000,000, and a similar
'raise put on the Spring Valley franchise.
Mr. Burke was called as a witness late
5n the afternoon, .and was not detained for
a. great length of time. It is understood
that he will go before the jury again.
"When questioned as to the nature of his
testimony yesterday he divulged no fur
ther information than that it related to
the assessment roll.
The Grand Jury committee, however, of
Which Mr. Landers is cdairman, is be
lieved to be in possession of data showing
hat sworn statementsof nine of the banks
of San Francisco show that these institu
tions possess $52,000,000 more of taxable
property than they are charged with on
the assessment rolls. There is data to
chow that the banks of San Francisco, all
told, hold of taxable property $108,000,000.
"Vet Assessor Siebe has assessed the whole
lot for only $ 6,000,000. It is calculated
that from the $108,000,000 some $47,000,000
should be deducted for unsecured debts,
but that the residue is under the law tax
able. The point is advanced, again, that
the banks are not entitled to the deduc
tion because the assessments are arbitrary.
Had sworn statements been made the off
set could be allowed, but not after neglect
or refusal to rile sworn statements.
From what source the committee has
obtained this information does not tran
spire, but a likely solution is that John H.
Burke, since his arrival from Minneapolis
two mouths ago, has been delving into
assessment statistics.
The observation has not escaped the
committee that the gas company fran
chise, once raised to $5,000,000, is now
down to $1,000,000, and a similar reduction
has followed with reference to the Spring
Valley franchise.
The same rule of light assessment is said
to apply to the Pacific Improvement Com
pany, the Southern Development Com
pany and street railway franchises
generally.
A conservative grand juror is quoted as
payine: "If this system of assessment is
carried much further the whole burden of
taxation will fall on the owners of home
steads and the actual possessors of real
â¢state. As it now etands, the vast volume
, of cash, stocks, notes and securities de
posited in banks and the' great stores filled
â¢ with merchandise of common value pay
taxes on but a small percentage of just
I valuation, while the owners of real estate
must pay on a full valuation a rate
amounting almost to confiscation in order
to furnish the millions required for the
tax-eating classes of the City and State
' governments.'
It is known that some members of the
Grand Jury are in favor of resolute meas
t tires to make the Assessor assess the rich
the same degree that he does the poor.
â Others of the jury are inclined to be con-
I eervative, holding that public good would
not be advanced by the adoption of radi
cal measures against corporations and the
f rich.
The decision of the Supreme Court of
the United States in the matter of taxing
â  franchises is hailed as a benefit, and some
of the members of the Grand Jury are in
terested in seeing that the franchises are
assessed to their full value.
Horace D. Dunn, expert of the Grand
Jury, has concluded his investigation of
accounts and records in the Recorder's
HEW TO-DAY.

Miller. The jury will probably investigate
to ascertain all the facts and circumstances
of the tragedy.
The Grand Jury went into Judge Slack's
court yesterday and reported three indict
ments. Carl W. yon Tiedeman and Harry
Wilkins were indicted for perjury and the
bail of each fixed at $3000.
Two weeks ago The Call told the story
of Mrs. Sarah R. Spencer's appearance be
fore the Grand Jury and her production of
positive proof that she was in Chicago
when Harriet P. Christy's name was
forged in March. 1894, in this City, to an
instrument conveying a block of land in
the Richmond- district to one Horace G.
Pratt. â¢
In the trial of Tiedeman in the Superior
Court, P 'partment 11, July, 1895, a
photograph of Mrs. Sarah R.JOwen (now
Mrs. Spencer) was produced, and both
Tiedeman and Wilkins swore positively
that it was the photograph of the woman
who introduced herself as Harriet P.
Christy. She was then introduced to Lee
D. Craig, the notary, as the owner of the
property. The Grand Jury was convinced
by the testimony of numerous witnesses
that Tiedeman and Wilkins willfully com
mitted perjury.
The third indictment was that of Felix
Truett for assault with a deadly weapon.
He cut Jean Garrigus in the neck, but
somehow managed to get clear in one of
the police courts. Truett's bail was fixed
at $1000.
The case of Thomas R. Ashworth,
Superintendent of Streets, against whom
an accusation of official misconduct was
laid by the Eldridge Grand Jury, will
come, by order of court, before the present
jury, of which Frank Maskey is foreman.
The subject was not considered beyond
informal discussion yesterday.
PREPARING TO WED.
Clerk Edward W. William* to Become
a Benedict.
Edward W. Williams, the popular clerk
of the Justice's Court, is preparing to be
come a benedict, and on the 22d inst. will
be married to Miss May Doremus Snook,
one of the many pretty girls who make
Oakland society so attractive to the mem
bers of the other aex.
The ceremony will take place at the
home of the bride's parents, 800 Thirteenth
street, and iB expected to be a swell though
quiet affair. Miss Snook is a sister of
CbarJes E. Snook, the District Attorney of
Alameda County, and is one of the most
popular young ladies of the Athens of the
Paci fie.
Mr. "Williams is one of the best known
of the young politicians of San Francisco,
having been many years in municipal of
fices, and always serving with credit to
himself and those who appointed him.
He served terms in the Registrar's office,
the County Clerk's office and in the Re
corder's department, and after the last
election was the unanimous choice of the
Justices of the Peace for the important
position which he now holds.
AftÂ«r the wedding Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liams will reside in this City.
CABS ON DIAMOND STREET
The Market-Street Company to
Extend the Castro-
Street Line.
Noe Valley Residents Seized With
Boulevard Intentions on Their
Own Account.
The Market-street Railway Company
has in contemplation the extension of its
Castro-street line from its southern ter
minus at Twenty-sixth street to connect
with the Mission road at its junction with
Diamond street.
This additional link will be made by the
equipping of an electric line from Castro
street at either Twenty-fifth or Twenty
sixth streets. The exact route has not
been positively decided upon yet.
From Diamond street near Castro, how
ever, the line will run along Diamond
street to Mission, as this is the only street
that has been cut through that portion of
the hill west of Noe Valley. Work would
probably have been commenced by the
railroad company before this were it not
that the Spring Valley Company is about
to tear up the street for the purpose of
putting in a main service-pipe. This done,
the construction force from the railroad
company's department will proceed to lay
tracks and string wires for the construc
tion of the Castro-street line over the hill,
tapping a new section heretofore inacces
sible so far as streetcar accommodation
was concerned. With this new branch
and the old-established lines there are now
four branches of electric lines tapping this
section.
The San Mateo line on Guerrero, Thir
tieth and Chenery streets, the Twenty
ninth-street continuation of the Mission
street line, Jhe Twenty-second street
branch of the same and the Eighteenth
street branch of the San Mateo line with
the now proposed extension of Castro on
Diamond, will be the means of building
a section of this City that a few years aeo
was grazing ground for milch cows and
sportive goats.
Even the residents out there ara now
getting the boulevard fever and nothing
less than a Dolores-street boulevard will
.satisfy their ambition. They point with
pride and pleasure to the commanding
width of this street, which has correspond
ing dimensions with Van Ness avenue, and,
as they ciaim, for a mere trifling expendi
ture in cutting down the hill between j
Twenty-third and Twenty-sixth streets, no
prettier boulevard could be found in the
City. This they say will give an outlet
for the Mission people to get to the Golden
Gate Park and to the Western Addition
without the necessity of coming down to
Valencia street.
Others there are on Mission street who
are clamoring for a police station in that
section known as the Mission road and the
Fairmount District.
All. however, have lofty and commenda
ble pretensions on the growth and beau
ties of their respective sections.
Two Team fur Isaacs.
W. C. Isaacs, who swore he had witnessed a
marriage which took place some hundreds of
miles from where he was, pleaded guilty to a
charge of perjury before Judge Ãahrs yesterday,
and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
Isaacs was a witness in the suit of Inez Mercer
when she sought to secure a divorce on the
ground of fraud. The marriage took place in
Portland while Isaacs was in the City, and yet
he swore tnat he was present at the ceremony,
and that the bride was imposed upon.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1896.
BLYTHE HEIRS
RENEW THE SUIT
Will Combat Distribution of.
Millions to Mrs.
Hinckley.
APPEAL TO BE TAKEN.
Case Perhaps Only in Its Infancy
After Years of Litiga
tion.
JUDGE COFFEY AN OBSTACLE.
To-Day's Action but a Stepping-Stone
to the State and National
Supreme Courts.
Tile remarkable Blytne inheritance case
will pass another milestone this afternoon
in its long journey through the courts.
A bill of exceptions to Judge Coffey's
ruling will be settled at 2 o'clock by the
Judge himself, who will either grant it and
thereby allow the numerous Blythe heirs
to take an appeal to the Supreme Court at
once, or will refuse it and thus force the
applicants to secure a writ of mandamus
from the Supreme Court compelling him
to show cause why he should not grant the
bill.
"This bill of exceptions to Judge Coffey's
decision," said Attorney George W. Towle
Jr., speaking yesterday for the opponents
of Mrs. Florence Blythe Hinckley, "is
merely a stepping-stone to an appeal that
we shall take to the Supreme Court of the
State, and if unsuccessful there we shall
appeal to the Supreme Court of the United
States.
"As far asthelenethof time of the litiga
tion over the Blythe estate, the case may
possibly be said to be still in its infancy.
"The judgment rendered that Florence
Hini'kley was heir to Blythe was void for
want of jurisdiction.
"That judgment rests on section 1387 of
the Civil Code, which provides that every
illegitimate child is an heir if the father of
such child acknowledges it in the presence
of a competent witness.
"The judgment rests on that section
which was a re-enactment of section '2 of
the act of April 15, 1850. That section 2
had been passed upon twice by the
Supreme Court prior to the time of re-en
actment, and they had held in the case of
Pina vs. Peck, reported in 31 California,
that writing produced by the child to be
sufficient under that section must show
upon its face that it was executed for the
purpose of making the child an heir;
must refer to the child as illegitimate, and
must bear the signature of the witness to
its executiou.
"The writing!) in the Blythe case do not
meet the requirements of the court in that
case in any single particular. They are
simply letters constituting a mass of social
correspondence.
"Justice Garoutte in his decision on the
Blythe case, quoted in 96 California, said:
'Pina vs. Peck is not authority in this
case for two sufficient reasons: Four
Justices participated in the decision [Jus
tice Sanderson not taking part], and two
of these Justices conferred alone in the
judgment.'
"The opinion in Pina vs. Peck, as pub
lished in 31 California, begins, 'By the
court, Rhodes J., Justice Rhodes being
the writer of the opinion, with which Jus
tices Shatter and Sawyer concurred spe
cially, following which are the words, '1
coucur in the judgment,' to which no sig-
I nature appears.
"After Justice Garoutte's opinion was
published discrediting the opinion in Pina
vs. Peck, the Blythe Company instituted
proceedings to perpetuafe the testimony
of Justices Rhodes and Currey, the only
members ot the court at the time the
opinion in Pina vs. Peck was rendered
that are now living. Both remember the
case distinctly; both are emphatic in their
statement that it was the opinion of the
court. And Justice Rhodes deposes that
he is as certain that Justice Sanderson did
participate in the decision in that case and
did concur freely in the opinion written by
himself, as published, as he is that he him
self wrote it.
"I said to him, 'Judge, is yonr belief in
that fact such that it amounts to an abid
ing conviction, to a moral certainty, of the
truth of that statement, to such an extent
that if a human life depended upon your
so saying yon would still so declare? 1 He
replied that it did.
"In the hearing of our appeal before the
Supreme Court in February last the depo
sitions of Justices Currey and Rhodes
were tendered to the court in support of
the opinion in Pina vs. t'eck. The depo
sitions were objected to by counsel for
Mrs. Hinckley, and the court declined to
receive the depositions in evidence.
"In connection with the offer of the
depositions counsel stated to the court the
substance of the depositions. In Pina
vs. Peck the decision is material because
in an unbroken line of decisions in courts
of all States including California the law
is that where a statute such as the act of
1850 has been construed by the highest
court of the State and subsequently re
enacted without substantial change in
phraseology, that such' re-enactment is a
legislative adaption of the construction
that has been placed upon it by the court.
"Referring to this. Justice Garoutte says
in his opinion: 'There can be no question
that if the rules of statutory construction
are the same now as when Pina vs. Peck,
| 31 California 369, was decided and the
I views then expressed had been adopted by
a majority of the court this principle of
the construction of statutes would have
controlling effect in this case, but it is
| equally true that rules of construction have
been changed. Such principle in the very
nature of things could not maintain.'
' "The rule of construction that he refers
to as having been changed is that estab
lished by section 4 of Civil Code, which
reads that the common-law rule of statutes
and derogations thereof should be strictly
construed, has no application in the code,
but that its provisions should be liberally
construed to effect its objects and promote
justice.
"Our purpose in this bill of exceptions is
to appeal from the judgment of final dis
tribution of the Blythe estate, permitting
Mrs. Hinckley to enter into possession as
legal heir."

TOOK HIS BOY BY FORCE.
William S. Eaton Creates a Sen
sation on Market Street
Yesterday.
A Lad of Seven Years Taken From
the Custody of His Mother by
His Father.
William S. Eaton created some excite
ment on Market street, opposite the Palace
Hotel, yesterday afternoon about 3 o'clock,
by forcibly taking his son Arthur, aeed 7
years, from the custody of his mother, and
driving rapidly away with the child.
Mr. Eaton is in the employ of the Good-
Mrs. Minnie S. Eaton.
[From a photograph.]
year Rubber Company as City agent, and
is quite well known about town, having
been the plaintiff in a sensational divorce
suit against Mrs. Minnie S. Eaton, in
which the defendant, Mrs. Eaton, was
eranted the divorce. The court awarded
the custody of the little boy to Mrs. J. M.
French, residing at 332 Haight street,
under the condition that both the father
and mother could see the child, but not
take it away.
Eaton was driving down Market street
in a buggy yesterday, and when near the
Palace saw his former wife leading the boy
down MarKet street toward the ferry. The
enraged husband whipped up his horse,
and when near the couple leaped out of
the buggy, grabbed the child, and jumping
back into the rig, started away at a wild
pace. The incident happened in such a
short space of time that it was all over
before the people in the vicinity realized
what had happened. Mrs. Eaton began to
shriek at the top of her voice, and in a mo
ment quite a crowd collected. Eaton and
the child were already far away, and the
lady refused to give her name or say any
thing about the matter.
Eaton turned the horses' heads toward
the beach, and took quite a long drive,
finally taking the child back to Mrs.
French's home on Haight street.
Mrs. French was seen last night, and
said Mrs. Eaton had called at the house
about 11 o'clock that morning to see the
child. She took the young one out saying
that she would bring it back before dinner, i
Mrs. French said that she did not thinK
Mrs. Eaton intended to keep the boy, and
could not account for Mr. Eaton's actions.
"He lias probably had some trouble
with his former wife," said Mrs. French,
"and seeing her on the street with the
child, grew angry and took it away. The
little fellow is here again, his father having
brought him back this afternoon just be
fore dinner.
The troubles of the Eatons were re
hearsed in the divorce courts not long ago
when Duncan B. Harrison, well-known
throughout the United States as play
wright, actor and manager, was named as
principal co-respondent. Eaton accused
his wile of many misdeeds, and claimed
that Harrison and Elliott Sanford wrecKed
his home.
Harrison threatened to. sue Eaton for
damages, but nothing ever came of the
matter. When the divorce suit was tried
before Judge Hebberd he granted the lady
a divorce.
Mrs. Eiiton has been threatening to take
the child from under the care of Mrs.
French, and Eaton claims it was for this
reason he took the boy away from her.
MEAT INSTEAD OF CATTLE.
Supreme Court Defines the Difference
Between the Quick and the Dead.
O. L. Smith of Mendocino County will
be given another chance to tell how he and
Andrew Spoerner carried home another
man's steer, for the Supreme Court has re
versed the order denying him a new trial.
He is now serving a four years' sentence in
the penitentiary for his offense, but he
will fare better when his case comes up
again.
The evidence showed that Spoerner killed
the steer without Smith's knowledge or
assistance, but that afterward, when he
told Smith, Smith helped him to cart it
home and salt it. Both men were charged
with grand larceny and Smith was con
victed.
In instructing the jury the lower court
laid down the rule that as Smith had as
sisted to carry away the beef, knowing it
had been illegally kflled by Spoerner, he
was guilty as an accomplice.
The Supreme Court defines grand lar
ceny as the taKing away of live cattle, the
taking of property from another's person,
or the taking of property valued at $60 or
over. To constitute grand larceny, says
the Supreme Court, the cattle stolen must
be alive, otherwise it is merely the stealing
of meat, which, unless it be of the value of
$50 or over, cannot be called grand larceny.
It was found that Smith was not concerned
in the actual killing of the b^ef, and he
could therefore not be held under the pro
vision which refers to cattle.
The decision practically reduces Smith's
crime to petit larceny.
BANKS SEEM SOLID.
The Bank Commissioners Have Still a
few Reports to Receive.
On the 14th inst. the time will expire
within which the State banks must send
in the reports called for by the Board of
Bank Commissioners. All but two of the
City banks have already complied with
the request, while out of the sixty-seven
savings banks in the State only sixteen
have not yet reported. In most instances
the banks have been prompt in respond
ing, and in every case the reports are in
dicative of a firm, buoyant condition in
the money market.

To-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock Rev. J. C.

Mr. Smith's subject will be "The Two Reforma
tions." Sea ts free, and all young men wel

OUT FOR RARE CURIOS.
An Expedition From Stanford
University to Go to Far
Kamchatka.
Will Go on the Kotik in a Week.
Timothy Hopkins Has Furnished
the Money.
Stanford University hopes to profit by
another scientiiic expedition. A week
from to-day the schooner Kotik, of the
Russian Sealskin Company, of which C.
M. Grunwaldt is general manager, will sail
for Kamchatka.
She will have on board two students of
the Stanford University, who are going out
to collect scientiiic curios in that new and
strange land.
The young men will make a specialty
of zoology, and therefore will spend much
time in studying tha fishes, but they will
dip a little into geology and botany also, if
they run up against any which strikes
them as unusual.
For a good while Stanford has looked
longingly at the sailing of the Kotik and
other vessels of the sealskin fleet.
It was looked upon as a uood opportun
ity to make conquests in a far country.
The trouble was, however, that with all
the other expeditions and expenses gener
ally of the university she didn't have the
money.
At this juncture Timothy Hopkins came
forward and threw himself into the breach.
He guaranteed to pay all the expenses of
the two students during the time they may
be out, including the cost of the requisite
paraphernalia.
President Jordan at once made arrange
ments with C. M. Grunwaldt, the general
manager, and now all is serene. It is said
that a student named Williams, who has
been out on various fish-hunting expedi
tions, will probably be one of the students
who will ko to Kamchatka. Who the
other one vrill be is not known.
The studentÃ will be gone six months.
The expedition is expected to cost, all told,
so it is aaid, somewhere near $2000.

THE WILMERDING SCHOOL.
Strong Efforts to Induce the Regents to
Place It Here.
Alfred Bouvier, Hugo D. Keil. Joseph
Leggett, James D. Phelan and J. Richard
Freud, of the committee organized to se- i
cure the location in this City of the Wil
nierding School of Industrial Arts, held a
private meeting yesterday afternoon at
the rooms of the Merchants' Association.
Mr. Bouvier, who presided at the meet
ing, said that arrangements had been
made for a number of meetings to be held
next week and during the week following,
at which reasons would be given why the
Wilmerding School shoula be located
bere. He was sure the project would be
crowned with success. The regents of the
university at their last meeting had laid
the matter on the table for a month, and
since the meeting a number of the regents

BADLY BROKEN UP.
A Salt Dealer Falls Down Hit Own
Elevator Shaft.
William Bryan, an Englishman 40 Tears
of age, is a very much bruised and broken
up man. He is a dealer in salt at 209 Sac
ramento street, and lives at 22 Hampton
place.
Last evening, in the darkness after 6
o clock, he was roaming about the third
story of his place of business and fell down
the freight elevator shaft. The employes
of a printing establishment next door
heard the man's groans and went to his
rescue. They found him wedged in the
elevator machinery and unconscious.
At the Receiving Hospital Dr. Weill
found that Bryan was suffering from a
broken right wrist, a fracture of both
limbs and a severe concussion if not a pos
itive fracture of the spine.
