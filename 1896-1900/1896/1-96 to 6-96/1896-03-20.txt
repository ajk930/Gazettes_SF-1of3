MALI: AS AA' OBJECTOR.
Opposes the Concurrent Resolution for
Cuban Recognition.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.-The
Cuban debate in the Senate to-day was of
a character to maintain the intense public
interest in that question. It was to have
been opened by Mills of Texas, but that
Senator was too ill to be present, and the
debate was opened by Stewart of Nevada.
He declared himself anxious for action,
paid that the facts were too notorious to
need further statement, favored the adop
tion of the conference report and said that
if a concurrent resolution did not produce
the desired result Congress ought to pass
a joint resolution and place the responsi
bility on tne President of the United
Btates.
Gray of Delaware, a member of the Com
mittee on Foreign delations, rose in or
der, as he explained it, to give the reasons
which compelled nim to withhold his as
sent from the conference report; but he
was subjected to so many interruptions
that his brief statement occupied ove"r an
hour. It closed with an expression of the
hope that "Spain, without rupture of
friendly relations, shall sit down with us
at the council board of nations and con
sider whether there may not be some
other issue of this sorry controversy than
the extermination of a whole people fight
ing for their liberties."
Gray was interrupted all through his
speech by Hale of Maine, in the course of
which Hale flatly contradicted a state
ment repeatedly made by Sherman of
Ohio, chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, as to Spain having violated all
the promises and reforms stipulated in the
capitulation of 1878, when the insurgents
of that day laid down their arms. Sher
man had said, among other things, that
although representation in the Spanish
Cortes was then promised the Cubans had
only one delegate there, but Hale affirmed
that he had a list of forty-five members in
the House of Deputies and fourteen or fif
teen members in the Senate from the two
islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. Hale de
clared with warmth that he was laboring
under a cense of indignation at the sup
pression of the tacts of the case by the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
Gray made a mock apology to Hale for
interrupting his speech so much, but spoke
of him by an intentional slip of the tongue
as "the Senator from Spain."
The junior Senator from Texas, Chiiton,
advocated the passage of a joint resolution
rather than of a concurrent one and de
clared his belief that intervention by the
United States meant the ultimate annexa
tion of Cuba, to which he was opposed.
The last si eech of the day was made by
Cafiery of Louisiana and was against the
entire proposition, as having no better
basis than stories in the "Arabian
Nights." The United States, he declared,
was bound by international law not to
meddle in the affairs of Cuba. If the
United States did not cling to that law it
would be outlawed from the circle of civil
ized nations.
Caffery had not finished his speech when
the Senate at 4 p. m. adjourned until to
morrow.
The Senate bill to enable the people of
New Mexico lo form a constitution and
Btate government and to be admitted into
the Union as a State was reported from the
Committee on Territories and placed on
the calendar.
The Senate bill authorizing the expendi
ture of the unexpended appropriation for
the construction of canals and iocks at the
cascades of the Columbia lliver in the con
struction of projecting walls was passed.
The conference report on the Cuban bel
ligerency resolutions was then taken up.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada addressed the
Benate in support of the resolutions. It
was a reproach to the American people
that they had stood by so long, he said,
and witnessed the vain attempt of Spain
to govern Cuba. He compared the case of
Spain in Cuba with that of England in
Egypt, and said that the English policy
in Egypt was being extended to this hem
isphere. If Spain held Cuba she would
hold her aÂ« she had done for the last hun
dred years with an army and would in
crease the Cuban debt and enslave the
people. The heart of every patriot in the
United States went out to Cuba.
Should the Senate, Stewart asked, an
swer the demand of the American people
and extend that sympathy in the most
The San Francisco Call.
effective way, or should it spend its time
quibbling about the fact whether there
was war in Cuoa? He hoped to have ac
tion and speedy action, and if it did not
bring results, let the Senate pass a joint
resolution and throw the responsibility
on the executive.
Then Stewart took his seat, and, as no
other Senator sought the floor, the Vice-
President asked whether the Senate was
ready for the question, and he stated the
question to be on agreeing to the confer
ence report.
Then Gray (D.) of Delaware, one of the
members of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, rose and said that he wished to
state briefly the reasons which compelled
him to withhold his assent from the con
ference report It was easy to say, Gray
remarked, that the resolutions of the two
houses were substantially the same, but
in a matter of this kind words were things.
It would be vain to attempt to disguise the
feeling of sympathy that occupied the
breast of every true American in regard to
that struggle. And yet the Government
of the United States, as in duty bound,
has been strictly observing its duties
toward the friendly Government of
Spain. It had strictly enforced the neu
trality laws. It had suppressed all aid in
the shape of military expenditions and
had gone to the very verge of its interna
tional obligations in protecting Spain
from the effects of that widespread sympa
thy. That feeling had found proper, re
spectful and courteous expression in the
resolutions passed by the Senate. How
evermuch Spain might be irritated by that
action she had no right in any interna
tional point of view to find fault with or
to call to account the Government of the
United States for that expression of the
opinion of its people.
Gray argued that there was no reason
why the Senate should accept the House
resolutions after its own resolutions being
contemptuously swept aside. He thought
that there was grave objection to the lan
guage of the House resolution. It did not
put the attitude of Congress where it ought
to be put as correctly as the Senate resolu
tion did.
A spirted colloquy occurred between
Platt, Gray, Hale and Sherman over the
failure of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations to furnish the Senate with informa
tion.
Hale asserted that Spain had not vio
lated the promises made after the war of
1878, as stated by Sherman.
Hale inquired whether anybody denied
that Cuba had representation in the Span
ish Cortes.
Shermanâ She has one delegate.
Hale â I have a list here showing that
Cuba and Porto Rico have in the Spanish
Cortes forty-five members in the House of
Deputies and fourteen or fifteen members
in the Senate.
Grayâ How many of them are appointed
by the Governor-General of Cuba?
Haleâ Not one. Every essential thing
in that pacification has been given by
Spain.
â¢ After some further remarks on that
point Hale exclaimed: "I speak with
some feeling because I am laboring under
a sense of indignation on account of the
suppression of the real facts in this case.
The committee has kept the facts from the
Senate."
Gray sarcastically apologized for break
ing so often into Hale's speech and re
ferred to him, as if by a slip of the tongue,
as "the Senator from Spain." [Laughter.]
In conclusion Gray said: "All reason-
able men will agree that Congress can do
no less than it has done in giving utter
ance to the sympathies of the American
people for the people of Cuba in this crisis
of their existence and in expressing the
desire that Spain, without rupture of
friendly relations, shall sit down with us
at the council board of nations and con
sider whether there may not be some
other issue to this controversy than the
extermination of a wnole people righting
for tueir liberties."
Chiiton (D.) of Texas spoke against the
Cuban resolutions in their present form.
Caffery (D.) of Louisiana opposed the be
stowal of belligerent rights upon the Cu
bans. The resolutins, be said, were passed
on the statements of irresponsible news
paper correspondents, whose accounts of
affairs in Cuba rivaled the stories of the
"Arabian Nights." There was not a scin
tilla of evidence in support of the state
ments made by the Committee on Foreign
Relations in support of their resolutions
except accounts of atrocities perpetrated
twenty-five years ago and extracts from a
history of Cuba whose statements had been
flatly contradicted. He contended that
the right to accord belligerent rights re
sided exclusively with the executivejbraneh
of the Govern ment.
Without finishing nis speech Caffery
yielded to a motion to adjourn and the
Senate at 4 p. m. adjourned until to-morrow.
< II lSl.lt BY A CRUISER.
The British Steamer Ethelred Outsailed
the Spanish Vessel.
BOSTON, Mass., March 19.â An officer
of the British steamer Ethelred, Captain
Hopkins, which arrived this morning
from Jamaican ports, reports that on
March 11, on the outward passage from
this port to Jamaica the steamer was
chased for an hour and a half by a Span
ish cruiser.
The Ethelred was steaming about eight
miles off Cape Maysi, the eastern end of
the island of Cuba, on the way to her dcs-
tination. She was going about twelve
knots an hour when a Spanish cruiser was
sighted, evidently on the lookout for the
supposed filibustering steamer.
The cruiser hoisted a Hag and the fruiter
did likewise. The latter continued on her
way, but the warship started in pursuit
and kept it up for a considerable time.
The Spaniard could not make over nine
knots an hour, and was no match for the
fruit vessel. When first seen by the Ethel
red another cruiser was in company with
the aggressive one, but apparently took no
interest in the proceedings. No shots
were tired from the warship, as the dis
tance was too great for any display of gun
practice.
It is claimed that as the Ethelred was
outside the three-miie limit the cruiser
had no right to attempt to stop her. The
Ethelred obtained considerable notoriety
last summer by being fired upon off the
Cuban coast by a Spanish gunboat. â¢

Owners of the Steamboat Atlantic City to

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 19.â
It is said that the Spanish representatives
here will proceed against the owners of
the steamboat Atlantic City for the alleged
part that craft took in putting Garcia
aboard the Bermuda off Somers Point,
N. J., yesterday. A well-known lawyer
has been retained in the case, and he said
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, MARCH 20, 1896.
"We Are the People! Razzle dazzle, razzle dazzle I"
to-day that the Atlantic City had violated
the maritime laws by going to Tuckahoe,
as the vessel has only a commission to ply
in the waters in the immediate vicinity of
Atlantic City.
TO SEEK FILIBUSTERS.
Instructions latued to the Various Col
lectors of Customs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 10.-Sec
retary Carlisle had a long conference with
the President this morning on the subject
of enforcing the neutrality laws as against
filibustering expeditions leaving the
United States to aid Cuban insurgents.
On his return to the Treasury the follow
lowing telegram was dictated and sent
broadcast:
Collector of Customs, Somers Point, N. J., re
ports that a filibustering expedition for Cuba
was transferred from the steamer Atlantic
City to another steamer, probably the Ber
muda, off Great Ejrg Harbor inlet, yesterday
morning at 8 o'clock, laid 10 be composer l of
General Garcia and several followers. If the
vessel is carrying an expedition consisting of
arms and men, in violation to title 67, Revised
Statutes of the United States, seize her if she
arrives within your jurisdiction. The fact
that a vessel carries a cargo ot arras is not suf
ficient of itself to authorize a seizure. If nec
essary communicate with any reA'enue cutter
and with the United States Attorney.
Scott Wike, Acting Secretary.
Copies of this telegram were sent to the
Navy Department, to Captain Shoemaker,
chief of the revenue cutter service of the
Treasury Department, to the Spanish Min
ister here, to the Attorney-General, the
Secretary of State, and to all Collectors of
Customs along the Atlantic coast from
New York to New Orleans.

Fate of Two Cuban* Employed to Betray
KEY WEST, Fla., March 19.âPassen
gers by the steamship Olivette last night
report that Murios and Sastras, two Cubans
employed by the Spanish Government to
betray Maceo, left Havana a few days ago,
going to the sugar plantation Santa
Amelia, where they caused an uprising
among the Cuban sympathizers. They
were met by General Anguire, who dis
covered their mission and promptly hanged
them.
Victoriano Remeri, formerly an editor of
a Spanish paper in this city, but lately
editor of El Pueblo, one of the most rabid
Spanish papers on the island, was recently
sent to the Cabanas for criticizing the
Spanish Government. Being drunk when
he entered the Cabanas Weyler ordered as
coon as he was sober that he be shot.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.âMin

General Weyler by telegraph what foun
dation there was for the report that he
contemplated resigning. To-day he re

Tailor-Shops Yet Running in Chicago, but
the Strikers Are Confident of
Victory.
CHICAGO, 111., March 19.â A delega
tion from the striking tailors visited the
shop of Klein & Marks, 128 Fifth avenue,
this morning and called upon the 100 men
and pirls employed there to quit work and
join the big strike. They weie also asked
to join the union and, so much excitement
followed among strikers, sympathizers and
employes that the proprietors closed the
place and called the police to clear the
rooms and passageways. Some of the
employes went to the strike headquarters,
but the firm expects most of them to re
turn to work to-morrow, saying they were
scared out.
A form of agreement was drawn op by
the United Garment-workers' Union to
day for the contractors to sign as a basis
of settlement for their part of the strike.
The proposition was considered by the em
ployers and rejected, the most obnoxious
part being a requirement of a bond of
$200 by each contractor to keep the agree
ment.
The contractors claim that only live
shops are closed and the strike-leaders say
all are closed except one. All of the shops
that are running are under police protec
tion.
FOR BIMETALLISM
AND PROTECTION
Conference of the Silver
Senators With Business
Representatives.
TARIFF AND COINAGE.
Warning by Westerners Against
Putting a Gold Plank in
the National Platform.
MANUFACTURERS IN EARNEST.
They Declare That High Duties Are
Not Sufficient to Assist Trade
Under a Single Standard.
WASHINGTON, I). C, to arch 19. -At
the Hotel Page, an important conference
was held to-night between the silver Re
publican Senators who voted against the
consideration of the tariff bill in the Senate
and a large number of representative men
from Philadelphia who favor the linking
together of protection and bimetallism.
The authoritative statement issued bj- the
conference after its secret session is looked
upon by politicians as the tirst note of
warning on the part of the Republican
Senators from Western States against the
adoption of a single gold standard plank
in the St. Louis platform. The conference
was the result of the following correspond
ence between William Wilhelm, a promi
nent attorney of Pottsville, Pa., and the
sextet of Silver Senators named in the
letter:
Pottsville, Fa., March T5, 1896.
Senators Jones, Teller, Dubois, Carter, Mantte
and Cannonâ Gentlemen: It has been my
good fortune to meet Messrs. James Dobson,
Charles Heber Clarke and B. E. Defendorf of
the city of Philadelphia. They and their in
dustrial friends arc anxious to confer with you
relative to the present depression and the
remedy for existing financial and industrial
troubles. If you are willing to meet the East
ern men of enterprise, then please advise the
aforementioned gentlemen bo that a confer
ence can be arranged between you and, them
and their friends. Inclosed find a list of
Philadelphia manufacturers who, I am as
sured, will take pleasure in meeting you.
Yours sincerely, William Wilhelm.
United States Senate, \
Washington, D. C, March 18, 1896. {
James Dobson Esq., Philadelphiaâ Dear, Sir:
Accepting the suggestion made to us by letter
by William Wilhelm of Pennsylvania, that it
would be well to have a conference between
representatives of industrial Interests of the
country and ourselves, we shall be pleased to
confer with yourself and such men of enter
prise as you may choose to invite to meet with
us at an early date at Washington. Yours very
truly, 11. M.'.Tfiller, E. T. Dubois, Lee Mantle,
T. 11. Carter, F. J. Cannon, J. P. Jones.
All of the foregoing Senators were pres
ent at the conference held to-night, as
were also Congressmen Hartman of Mon
tana, Allen of Utah and Wilson of Idaho,
and also the following-named representa
tives of manufacturing interests: James
Dobson, manufacturer of carpets; George
Campbell, woolens; -James Pollock, car
pets; S. B. Vreeman, lumber; Frank Cra
ven, silk; C. H. Hardy, yarns; George W.
Elkins, street railways; Alexander Crow,
carpets; Henry A. Fryem, groceries;
Henry Holmes, carpets: R. W. Scott, knit
goode; James Brown, woolens; Howland
Croft, worsteds; Charles M. McLeod,
yarns; James Defendorf, yards; John Fis
ler, wire; Robert Dawraan, carpets; Rob
ert W. Scott, knit goods; Charles H.
Clarke, surgical appliances; Theodore R.
Miller, upholstery; Richard Campion,
yarns; Jdseph Bromley, rugs; Joseph R.
James, woolens; Joseph Foster, dyes;
James Phillips, worsteds; C. D. Fieretone,
buggies, and R. E. Defeiiderfer, electrical
appliances.
The conference was organized by choos
ing Senator Dubois as chairman and Mr.
Wilhelm of Pennsylvania secretary. For
three hours and a half behind closed doors
the conference proceeded, involving the
uniting of bimetallism and protection as a
National issue. Remarks were made by
Senators Teller. Jones of Nevada, Carter,
Mantle and Cannon. President Dornan of
the Manufacturers' Club of Philadelphia
expressed the opinion that tariff duties
could not be made high enough to protect
our manufacturers if our country remained
on a gold basis.
James Dobson, the great carpet manu
facturer, came out. unqualifiedly for free
coinage, by international agreement if pos
sible, otherwise by independent action.
He believed that independent action would
induce international action. Free coinage
might create temporary disturbances, but
it was the quickest way to perform relief to
mills all over the country, which were suf
fering.
Henry A. Frye of Philadelphia said
that the sooner we took independent
action for bimetallism the better it would
be. He declared for protection and bi
metallism. Charles H. Clarice, editor of
the Manufacturer of Philadelphia, said he
had labored in season and out of season to
convince the manufacturers that protec
tion would only prove efficacious in con
junction with the restoration of silver;
that he was now bappy to have so many
represjntatives of the industrial interest*
of the country present to meet the Sena
tors who had voted against the Dingley
bill and to personally verify his declara
tion.
Richard Campion declared himself in
favor of the restoration of silver, but
thought that the cause of bimetallism was
not advanced by the defeat of the revenue
measures.
Several opinions were expressed of re
gret at the loss of the Dingley measure,
but no opinion antagonistic to the restora
tion of silver was uttered.
The Senators present denned their posi
tion in such manner as to make it plain to
the manufacturers that there could be no
protective-tariff legislation either at this
session of Congress or the next without
the. rehabilitation of silver or bimetallism,
and protection constituted an indivisible
issue before the country. Some of the
manufacturers themselves indorsed the
position as b?ing the logic of the country's
necessities and political conditions. The
issue was clearly denned, but no attempt
at organization was made.
The intensity of the interest shown
demonstrated a determination to rescue
the country, if possible, from its impend
ing industrial and financial ills. Charles
Heber Clarke invited the Senators to a
meeting to be held at the Manufacturers'
Club, Philadelphia, at an early date.
Many strong letters in harmony with the
purpose of the meeting were received
from manufacturers throughout the coun
try who were unable to be present at this
particular meeting.
The incidental mention of the name of
J. Donald Cameron for nomination for the
Presidency met with cordial approval.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 19.â The Repub
lican State Committee will meet here to
morrow to decide whether one or two con
ventions will be held in Missouri this year.
The Filley and Kerens factions are divided
on this question and a Jively contest is ex
pected. The former favors holding two

gates-at-large to tiic convention and the
new State Committee, and the second to
nominate officers. Should the plan be
carried out, i illey will undoubtedly be
one of the delegates to the St. Louis con
vention. The Kerens-Wai bridge faction
desires but one convention, and hopes by
this to gain time in which to so arrange
the contest for delegates that Mayor Wal
bridge will secure the gubernatorial nom
ination and Kerens be chosen one of the
delegates-at-large. In any event it is con
ceded that the delegation from this State

THE BTJtEA'G2H>i Of ALLISON.
There la a Bright l'roÂ»peet of Hit Getting
the Xomlnutlon.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.â
While the McKinley men are claiming the
earth, so to speak, the Allison contingent
in the House disdains to juggle with fig
ures, but is "laying low" like Brer Fox in
the fable. They hug the idea tenaciously
that unless McKinley lias an inalienable
right to the nomination, and that his lien
cannot be dissolved in the supreme mo
ment of work of the St. Louis convention,
Allison is destined to capture the plum
and in that conviction they find comfort
and contentment.
"The strength of Allison," said Repre
sentative Perkins of lowa, editor of
one of the leading Allison papers in the
United States, "is to be found in the pe
culiar position he occupies between the so
called leaders in the race. His connection
with the race has been happily free from
irritation and friction. To partisans of
McKinley and other candidates he appears
in the character of a peculiarly amiable
compromise candidate. The solution of
the whole vexed question in favor of Alli
son, in my opinion, is the steadily grow
ing bitterness between partisans of these
men. It must sooner or later occur to
them that Allison is a man whose candi
dacy will provoke less hostility than that
of either McKinley or Reed.
"The level-headed men who will repre
sent the Republican party at St. Louis will
consider what will happen after the elec
tion. Republicans ought to consider that
if they should come back into power the
party will be on trial again. It is more im
portant that this trial shall meet reasona
ble expectations, and give a hold upon suc
ceeding elections that whether it shall be
McKinley or Reed who will lead the Re
publican phalanx to victory in November,
for I conclude that a Republican victory is
inevitable. That election should insure
for us a new lease of political life and we
should bo careful that in nominating our
candidate we strike no aeep wounds which
will open and bleed after the victory is
won. In this respect Allison is strong.
"He is in the happy relation of second
choice to almost every other candidate
where preference is not for him first. He
is making no enemies and is under obli
gations to no man. The partisans of
other candidates can gravitate to him
with clear conscience and Allison can ac
cept that nomination and run his race
without having hedged himself about with
promises and compromising entangle
ments waiting to be redeemed after he
takes his seat. If the nomination of Mc-
Kinley is not conceded Allison will be tne
man."

Election of Delegates in Several Sew Torh
JHttrict*.
BROOKLYN, N. V., March 19.âCon
ventions were held by the Republicans in
the live Congressional districts of Kings
County to-night to elect delegates to the
National Convention at St. Louis. The
following were chosen:
Second Districtâ Theodore B. Willis and
George H. Roberts Jr.
Third Districtâ Timothy L. Woodruff
and Walter B. Atterbury.
Fourth Districtâ Granville W. Harmon
and Joseph R. Clark.
Fifth Districtâ Frederick W. Wurster
and Ernest J. Keltonbach.
Sixth Districtâ Henry C. Saffen and
George W. Palmer.
The contest in this city over the election
of delegates to the St. Louis Republican
Convention was more of a local affair than
a National one. The Willis-Wurster fac
tion carried the Second, Third and Fifth
districts, and the Worth faction the
Fourth and Sixth districts. The former
faction favor the candidacy of Governor
Morton for the Presidency, and it is
thought that the Worth faction also
favors Governor Morton, as Mr. Worth is
an adherent of Mr. Platt's.

Indiana Republican* Hold Congressional
JUistrict Convention*.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 19.â The
Republicans of Indiana to-day held their
Congressional district conventions for the
election of delegates and alternates to the
National Convention and for the nomina
tion of candidates for Congress. William
MsKinley's name was well received at all
conventions in the thirteen districts and
most of them indorsed him for President
or adopted the stronger course of instruct
ing their delegates to vote for him until
his nan.c was withdrawn or his nomina
tion had been accomplished.
The Second District convention was di
vided between Allison and McKinley and
the delegation was uninstructed. The
Seventh District practically sent McKinley
delegates. Harry S. New of Indianapolis,
who is a Harrison man from intimate
friendship of himself and father, stated
when elected one of the delegates that he
would vote for McKinley if the conditions
remained as they wore at present. The
other delegate is a McKinleyue.
Resolutions indorsing McKinley were
aoopted in the First, Third, Fourtn, Fifth,
Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh
and Twelfth districts and the delegates so
instructed. The Thirteenth District de
clared for him, but did not so instruct the
delegates. Most of the indorsements were
carried through without opposition. The
Second District. renominated Hon. A. M.
Hardy of Daviess County for Congress.
Marcns R. Sulzer of Madison was nomi
nated in the Fourth; Congressman J. N.
Leigbty was renominated in the Twelfth
and Congressman J. A. Hemeaway in the
First.

House of Commons to-day Mr. Labou
chere, referring to the British expedition
to Dongola, asked the Government if any
alliance existed between Great Britain and
Italy.
Mr. Curzon, Under Foreign Secretary,
said there existed no alliance or agreement
of any kind between the two countries
but the circumstances in which they were
placed. He pointed to the expediency of
a friendly co-operation between the two
Governments in defense of their common
interests.
Mr. Curzon also announced that M.
Berthelot, French Minister of Foreign
Affairs, had informed Lord Dufferin, the
British Embassador to France, that he
repudiated all responsibility for the state
ment made in reporting the purport of the
interview between the Minister and the
Embassador on Tuesday, in which the
former is represented as having demanded
to know the reasons for the British expedi
tion up the Nile and as having pointed
out the gravity of the consequence of the
movement. Such statements. M. Berthelot
had said, must have been published by
misinformed persons.
France, Mr. Curzon said, had been in
formed of the intended plans of Great
Britain in the Nile Valley, but the French
Government had not as yec made any
reply. â¢
The Italian Government, Mr. Curzon
continued, had informed England that
Italy would not evacuate Kassala, unless
the military authorities there should find
it impossible to hold the place.
Mr. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury
and Government leader in the House, said
that the British Embassadors to Paris,
Berlin, Vienna, Rome and St. Petersburg,
had been instructed to communicate to
the respective governments to which they
were accredited the grounds upon which
the English advance up the Nile Valley
had been made and also to point out the
fact that in order to meet the expendi
tures required it might be necessary to
use a larger sum than was at the disposal
of the Egyptian treasury and that the
Government hoped that the commission
of the Egyptian public debt would assent
to the expenditure of Â£500,000 from the
reserve fund, Which was now Â£2,500,000.
The Governments of Germany, Italy
and Austria had given replies assenting to
this, Dut Russia and France had not an
swered. As the operations were in the
interest of Egypt, Mr. Balfour said the
costs should naturally be defrayed from
the reserve fund. It was not possible, he
said, to form an exact estimate of the ex
pense at present.
In the House of Lords Lord Salisbury,
in reply to a question from Lord Rosebery,
said the Italian Government had not
learned of the fall of Kassala, which is
regarded as extremely improbable.
VERY SERIOUS OBJECTIONS.
Minister Berthelot pen kg of the English
.'. Expedition.
; PARIS, France, March 19.â 1n .the
Chamber of Deputies to-day M. Berthelot,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that
there were , serious objections, both finan
cial and political, to the British expedition
against Doncola, and that representations
had been made by France to the Govern
ment of England and to that at Cairo, ne
gotiations resulting from which were now
pending.
' M. Berthelot added that France had de
clined to accede to Great Britain's request
to take Â£500,000 from. the Egyptian reserve
to meet the expenses of the expedition.
The expedition was not a defensive one
but an offensive act. ." .. ' â . .. .'
LONDON, Eng., March 19.â The Morn
ing Post will publish a dispatch from
Paris saying that the Chamber of Deputies
is satisfied with M. Bert helot's statement,
which is regarded as having been patriotic,
although pacific.

MCARAGUA'B REVOLUTION.
Ot her Central American States May He-
come involved.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 19.â A Sun
â pecial from Washington says:
Private information received from Nica
ragua indicates that the revolution in that
republic is much more serious than has
been represented in the press, and that it
may be continued for many months.
There is a danger that the other Central
American republics may be drawn into it,
and a fear lest the trouble may extend
throughout all of Central America.
An embargo has been placed on the tele
graph wires and no dispatches in cipher
or containing news concerning the out
break are allowed to be sent out of the
country. Minister Baker, anticipating
trouble, dkbled for a man-of-war to protect
American citizens some weeks ago.
PACIFIC RAILROAD DEBTS
John C. Coombs Favors the Build
ing of the Sioux City
Branch.
A Sub-Committee Appointed to Confer
With Senators on a Plan of
Settlement.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.â John
C. Coombs of Boston, representing the
Credits Commutation Company, whose
interests are located in Sioux City, to-day
appeared before the House Committee on
Pacific Railroads for the purpose of seeing
where he could attach the interests he.
represented to the plans suggested by
other parties.
Referring to the several changes made
in the suggestions of the Union and
Centra! people he said that he found it
very hard to put sait on the tail of a bird
that never lights. With the form of
security to be offered the Government still
unknown it was very difficult for him to
say his amendment should come in.
He was confident, however, that the
Government would not go out of the rail
road business for fifty or a hundred years,
and for one of these y>eriods wouid have a
strong box of railroad securities. His
proposition was to provide in any plan of
settlement for aiding in the construction
of the Sioux City branch. To accomplish
this be wanted the Secretary of the Treas
ury to be given authority to invest not
over $1,500,000 of the fund accrued under
the Thurman act in the securities oi the
Sioux City road. He wanted this plan in
corporated in any general plan, as he did
not think it would stand alone.
Representative Shafroth of Colorado
spoke in support of his bill looking to a
settlement of the Pacific road matters by
foreclosure.
After the hearing a sub-commrttee con
sisting of Chairman Powers and Wright,
Ferris, Kyle and Sulzer was appointed to
consider the various measures for the set
tlement of the indebtedness of the road 3.
They are to consult with the Senate Pa
cific Railway Committee and recommend
to the full committee as early as possible a
bill to settle all matters pertaining to the
roads.
ARREST OF A WIRE-TAPPER.
William H. McNutt Suspected of Having
Had a Hand in the Royal
Nettie Swindle.
CHICAGO, 111., March 19.â William H.
McNutt, the most notorious wire-tapper in
the United States, was arrested at noon
to-day in the Brevort House, on Madison
street, by Central station detectives on
suspicion of being implicated in the sen-
Eational wire-tapping case at New Orleans
last Saturday. This was the case in which
bookmakers all over the country were hit
for $150,000 on the substitution of Royal
Nettie for Plug as winner of the last race.
McNutt was locked up at the Central sta
tion, but was not booked. McNutt claims
that he had nothing to do with the wire-
tapping, but that he knew all about it.
Tlje police do not think McNutt is a
professional wire-tapper and are of the
opinion tnat he knows very little about
telegraphy. They believe, however, that
he ie a confidence man and on a pledge to
tap wires has had money advanced to
him. He will have a hearing to-morrow.

DEBATE ON THE
ACTS OF BAYARD.
Opposition of Democrats to
the Resolution of
Censure.
ACTION IS POSTPONED.
Two Members of the House
Indulge in Personalities
While Arguing.
GIBSON REFUTES A SLANDER.
Did Not Send a Circular to Constitu
ents Under His Own
Frank.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.-The
debate on the Bayard resolutions was con
tinued in the House to-day, and toward
the close of the session descended into an
exchange of personalities between Suizer
(D.) of New York and Gibson (R.) of Ten
nessee. The display of a circular letter
by Gibson to his constituents by Suizer,
and the charge that it was being circulated
under a frank elicited an angry outburst
from the Tennesseean, who denied that he
was using a frank upon the document, and
that the person who said so was the author
of a vile slander. Later Suizer withdrew
the assertion, and also apologized to the
gentleman for anything he had said which
might have given him offense, but that
did not wholly satisfy Gibson, who in the
course of a personal explanation said the
circular had been stolen, being still so far
as he knew in the hands of the printer,
and assertel that if there were no receivers
there would be no thieves.
The episode was quickly over, and at its
close the House adjourned.
The speakers to-day were: Tucker CD.)
of Virginia and Cooper (D.) of Florida
egainst the resolutions of censure, and
Taft and Wilson (R.) of Ohio, Pear
son (R.) of North Carolina and McCall
and Barrett (R.)of Massachusetts in favor
of them.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio defended the
reputation of General Schenck from the
inference arising from the statements
made yesterday by McCrearv (D.) of Ken
tucky about his connection with the
Emma mine and the publication of bis
rules of poker while he was Minister to
England.
Just before adjournment an agreement
was reached to take a vote on the resolu
tions at 2 o'clock to-morrow.
Taylor (R.) of Ohio reported the resolu
tions of the Committee on Elections No. 2.
declaring the seat vacant now occupied by
Boatner (D.) of Louisiana, and gave
notice that they would be called np to-mor
row after the pending resolutions have
been disposed of and be voted on without
debate.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio, responding to
the remarks made yesterday by McCreary
(D.) of Kentucky, regarding the late Gen
eral Schenck's connection with the Emma
mine, said there was nothing in General
Schenck's record which left a spot or blem
ish upon his reputation. He conscien
tiously believed absolutely in the merits of
the enterprise. Referring then to what he
denominated "the cruel reference to the
book on poker," Grosvenorsaid that a full,
complete defense to the impropriety, if
any there were, on the part of General
Schenck in connection with it had been
read time and time again by every man in
the United States of the age of responsi
bility who could read, how that the rules
were written by Scbenck at the request of
a lady, who. without his knowledge or
consent and grea'ly to his annoyance and
chagrin, published them.
Grosvenor briefly sketched General
Schenck's career, asserting that it was that
of the foremost of Americans, a gallant
soldier, a true patriot, an able statesman
and an honest man. [Applause.]
Pearson (R.) of North Carolina sup
ported the resolutions and was followed
by Tucker (D.) of Virginia in opposition
and by McCall (R.) of Massachusetts in
their support.
Barrett (R.) of Massachusetts, who in
troduced the resolution, quoted various
comments made by the English press upon
the Edinburgh speech to show that any
censure passed upon Mr. Bayard would be
less than he deserved, one being from the
pen of George W. Smalley, whom he char
acterized as "a denationalized American
who can be depended on at all times to
voice the conservative, high church, ultra-
Engrish sentiments." Mr. Smalley in a
recent defense of Mr. Bayard had desig
nated those who sought to bring him to' a
decent sense of accountability as associates
of and sympathizers wilh dynamiters and
assassins. Barrett claimed a part of the
programme of the defenders of Mr. Bayard
was to induce the British public to be
lieve that the Republican party in the
United States, because of the opposition
by members of it to the views held by
Mr. Bayard, was banded with dynamiters
and assassins.
Barrett claimed that Mr. Bayard had
violated the instructions of the Depart
ment of State, aside from the Boston and
Edinburgh speeches, by injecting himself
into the matter of the regulations for the
importation and quarantine of cattle into
an issue that was at stake in Great Britain.
At the conclusion of Barrett's remarks
an agreement was reached to take a vote
on the resolutions at 2 o'clock to-morrow.
Cooper (D.) of Florida characterized the
movement in support of the resolutions as
an infamous attempt to further the cause
of protection.
The course of the debate was inter
rupted to permit laylor (R.) of Ohio to
present the majority report of Elections
Committee No. 2in the matter of the con
tested election case of Benoit vs. Boatner,
from the Fifth Louisiana District, and gave
notice that he would call it up to-morrow
at the close of the vote on the pending
resolutions.
Watson (R.) of Ohio urged the adoption
of the resolutions as a message to every
home in the land where the benefits of
protection have been seen and enjoyed;
that the House reasserts and reaffirms its
devotion to thai great American principle.
The only exciting episode of the day's
discussion came when Sulzer (D.) of New
York, following Gibson (R.) of Tennessee,
exhibited a "campaign circular issued by
Gibson and humorously commented on
the statements in it relating tohis.(Gib
son's) servics in behalf of pension claini
auts and to the charge by some Democrats
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL&, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
that he is "egotistic." Suizer stated that
the circular had been circulated under a
Congressional frank, to which Gibson took
exceptions.
"Do you say that I circulated the letter
under my frank:?" shouted tne excitable
Tennesseean.
Suizer was on the opposite side of the
hall, and speaking himself to the accom
paniment of a vigorous rapping by the
Speaker, did not comprehend the remark,
saying "The next time the gentleman had
better use a trumpet."
Gibson was trying to get recognition,
but Suizer declined to yield and th^
Speaker directed Gibson to take his seat.
He did so, shaking his hands and shouting
that a man who made a charge of that
kind and then refused to give an oppor
tunity for response, "Was a coward."
The tenor of Gibson's assertion having
been conveyed to Suizer by those about
him, he said he had been informed that
the letter was being circulated under the
Congressman's frank. If it were not so he
would withdraw that statement.
"I want to know who your informant
is?" asked Gibson.
Again Suizer declined to yield, where
upon Gibson cried angrily: "It is a false
statement and your informant is the
author of a vile slander, and if you refuse
to give his name you are a3 bad as he is."
In a minute or two Suizer said if he had
said anything which had offended Gibson
he felt that in an honorable, manly way
he should withdraw it and apologize for it,
and he did so.
The resolutions were then discussed for
a few minutes by Suizer, and, recurring to
Gibson, said that when he got back to
Tennessee and the people asked him what
the Republicans had done he could an
swer, "\Ve censured Bayard."
With this the incident ended, and the
House, on motion by Hitt (R.) of Illinois,
at 5:15 p. >t., adjouned until to-morrow.
SENATOR BRICE CLEARED
Not Particularly Interested in
Refunding Bonds Issued
by New Mexico.
Governor Thornton Makes an Explana
tion to the Committee on
Territories.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.âSen
ators Brice and Wolcott and Governor
Thornton of New Mexico appeared before
the Committee on Territories this morn
ing for a hearing on Mr. Brice's amend
ment to the House bill, approving certain
acts of the Territorial Legislature, author
izing the issxie of certain bonds of that
Territory. When the bill was reported to
the Senate it carried an amendment
which also validates and confirms all
bonds issued by the Territory (amounting
to $172,500) in refunding the bonds issued
to aid in the construction of the Texas,
Santa Fe and Northern Railroad. A de
cision of the Supreme Court of the United
States having cast a cloud upon these
bonds, the Senate committee took the
grounds that they, hawing been issued in
good faitn and the work for which they
were issued having been done, the act be
so amended as to validate them along with
the other bonds enumerated in the bill.
Governor Thornton appeared for the pur
pose of antagonizing such validation, al
though the people of the Territory had on
live different occasions voted to authorize
the issue. Senator Brice's interest in the
matter was to an extent at least personal.
Some time ago it was telegraphed East
that at a meeting held in Santa Fe he
had been charged with seeking to have
fraudulent bonds made good through the
action of Congress, and resolutions were
passed denouncing him for such acts.
Brice asked Goveruor Thornton if there
was any charge of fraudulent transactions
in the matter, and the Governor said
there were none. He deplored the action
of the meeting and specifically disclaimed
any charge that Senator Brice had been
seeking to influence legislation in any im
proper direction.
It was admitted that the road was built;
that the Territory held the stock; that it
was taxed and was valuable, and that it
had defaulted in the payment of its inter
est. Senator Brice, satisfied with the
statements made by Governor Thornton,
said that that was all the interest he had
in the matter and withdrew.
Senator Wolcott remarked that the trans
action was nothing more nor less than an
effort on the part of the Territory to repu
diate its debts, and he further observed
that with the Territory seeking admission
to Statehood it was a most inopportune
time for such efforts to be put forth.
Colonel Holt of New York, representing
the firm of Kohler & Co., who floated the
Territorial bonds, was present but was not
heard to-day.
VISITED THE "G R EAT \FATHER."
Kickapoo Indiana Protest Against
Enforced Civilization.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.â There
was a picturesque gathering in the Jfresi
dent's office in the White House this
morning, when a delegation of Kickapoo
Indians from Oklahoma Territory had an
interview with Mr. Cleveland about the
severalty law.
The venerable chief Whitft Water ex
plained through an interpreter that his
people were dissatisfied with the law divid
ing their lands in severalty. They ob
tained the land from the Great Spirit, he
said, and wished to preserve their tribal
relations and not be obliged to take up
separate farms and become civilized. They
had therefore come to Washington to see
the great father to secure redress.
The President replied in kindly tones
that the severalty act was a law of the
Jand and he was obliged to carry it out.
The white man bad endeavored to improve
his condition and the Indian should do
tho same. He hoped the Kickapoos would
realize the wisdom of this, and advised
them to abide by the law and become
civilized.
SEW BAXKHVPTCI BILL.
It Ha* Been Prepared by a Sub-Com

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.â The
sub-committee of the House Judiciary
Committee, which lias been engaged in
the preparation of a bankruptcy bill, fin
ished their labors at a late hour this after
noon. Their bill will be laid before the
full committee to-morrow.
The original Torrey bill as amended in
the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Con
gresses serves as the basis of tne new
measure, which provides for voluntary and
involuntary bankruptcy. The only ground
of involuntary bankruptcy in the new bill
is fraud, actual or implied, on the part of
the bankrupt. The involuntary features
of the new bill do not apply to laborers or
farmers engaged in tilling the soil.

THOSE WHO SIGN THE CALL.
Evidence Relating to the Boundary
Dispute Considered by the Vene

WASHINGTON. D. C, March 19. -The
following letter nas recently been mailed
to over 1000 representative men through
out the United States:
Washington, D. C, March 12, 1896.
Dear Sir: A widespread desire has been mani
fested both in the United States and in Great
Britain for the establishment between these
two countries lor a permanent system of arbi
tration.
With a view to the accomplishment of that
end, we hereby invite you to attend a National
conference, to be held in the city of Washing
ton on Wednesday and Thursday, the 22d and
23d of April next, to express the general con
viction that such a system of arbitration
should be speedily provided for by the proper
authorities and with tne most comprehensive
application practicable.
It is earnestly desired that all parts of the
country should be represented at this confer
ence, and in order that this may be assured a
similar invitation has been sent to representa
tive men, irrespective of party or creed, in
every State aud Territory of the United States,
the combined membership of the two houses
of Congress, being taken as a general basis of
numbers and apportionment.
Assuming that you share our belief as to the
importance of the end proposed, we deem it
unnecessary in this communication to enter
into an extended] statement of the subject. By
repeated acts, as well as by repeated declara
tions, our Government has appeared before the
world in advocacy of international arbitra
tion as a measure conformable to our interests
and the general interests of our institutions,
as well as to the cause of general justice and
civilization. To this effect patriotism, philan
thropy, statesmanship and religion have
spoken as with one voice.
In confining the present movement to the
promotion of arbitration between the United
States and Great Britain we are not uncon
cerned for the wider application of the prin
ciple involved. But, taking into consideration
the importance and value of practical results,
it has seemed wise to concentrate our imme
diate efforts upon the attainment of a perma
nent system between the two great English
speaking peoples.
Earnestly trusting that at any early day your
acceptance of the invitation hereby extended,
we remain, yours faithfully, Chief Justice
Melville W. Fuller; Major-General Nelson A.
Miles, U. S. A. ; Admiral John G. Walker, U. S.

monious points in the two cases as pre
sented, referring also to the great accumu
lations of evidence the commission had

WASHINGTON, D. c., March 19.â The
Democratic members of the Senate held a
caucus this afternoon at the adjournment
of the Senate for the purpose of discussing
the question. of patronage. " The proposi
tion on which Senator Gorman, represent
ing the Democrats, and Senator Elkins,
representing the Republicans, nave been
working for several weeks, was submitted
to the caucus and appeared to meet with
favorable consideration. ...;". â¢>
; This proposition provides for a non-par
tisan distribution of the patronage equally
among the ninety Senators who compose
the body. There are about eighteen em
ployes, who, from r long years of experi
ence have become invaluable to the Sen
ate and these men will be placed in a list
and charged up to the ; ; Senate as a body.
The other places will then be distributed
equally, v There were ten Democratic Sen

new Republican Senators.
Of course a revision of this sort means
that some of the employes will have to go
and they will probably be those whose
Senators have lost their seats and who are
therefore no longer with , Senatorial back
ins;. The whole : subject, after ; discussion,
was left ,to the ' steering committee. The
committee will confer with a similar com
mittee for the Republicans, and after a
caucus it is believed the whole matter will
be settled on the basis : herein indicated.

STILES HAS DEPARTED.
The Promoter of the British
Empire Exposition Scheme
Not in Evidence.
Considerable Money Was Paid to the
Agent on Account of Conces
sions.
MONTREAL, Quebec. March 19.â A sen
sation has be^n caused here by the sudden
departure of Joseph H. Stiles, promoter of
the defunct British Empire Exposition
scheme. Since the collapse of the project
Stiles has been besieged by creditors, and
not being able to meet them he quietly
left the city en route for England.
Considerable sums of money had been
paid to Stiles and bis agents on account of
the conceasiona and contracts of various
kinds, but these sums are far from repre
senting the actual losses of different
parties interested. C. Gaston Akoun of
New York is said to have paid $1000 to
Stiles for the privilege of showing the
Streets of Cairo at the proposed expe
dition. Akoun has a large consignment
of camels, donkeys and Arabian horses
here and twenty-five women, natives of
Algeria, are now on their way across the
Atlantic to Mr. Akoun, who had to pay
the French Government 1000 francs deposit
on each member of the troupe as a guaran
tee for their safe return. The greatest
victims here of the collapse of the expo
sition scheme are George C. Huttmeyer &
Co., who are creditors for about $20,000 for
printing and who to-day made an assign
ment.
CLARA BARTON'S RELIEF WORK.
An Armenian Complains Bitterly of Minister
Terrell's Apathy in Assist
ing Her.
NEW YORK, N.Y., March 19.-Spencer
Trask, chairman of the Executive Com
mittee of the National Armenian Relief
committee, to-day received the following
cablegram from Miss Ciara Barton of the
Red Cross Society, who is now at Constan
tinople:
"Caravan started en route for Marash
and Zeitouu in Aleppo province; very
cold in mountains, snow deep; have sent
funds and supplies forward."
The Times to-morrow will publish the
following: An Armenian who recently
arrived here from Constantinople com
plained bitterly to-day against United
States Minister Terrell for his apathy in
the matter of securing recognition for
Clara Barton as the head of the Red Cross
Society in her mission to the suffering
Armenians.
"At present," he said, "the Sultan only
recognizes her as 'Clara Barton, an Ameri
can,' end consequently she is not guaran
teed' protection. Minister Terrell is a
great crony of the Sultan.
"He is the only foreign-born representa
tive ever invited to dine with the Sultan,
and the latter frequently calls upon him
for advice. It is a noticeable fact, how
ever, that when another foreign represent
ative gives a dinner Mr. Terrell is never
invited.
"He is so subservient to the Sultan that
he is afraid to stand upon his rights, much
less ask favors of him. Had Clara Barton
come from England or Russia she would
have had passports long ago."
For a Mixed Comtnistion.
LONDON, Ekg., March 19.â The Daily
News will to-morrow say that a convention
has been concluded between Nicaragua
and Great Britain through the Salvadorean
Minister in England, providing for the ap
pointment of a mixed commission to de
cide the claims of British subjects arising
from the events that occurred in Mosquito
in 189 i. The commission will consist of
three members, one British, one Kica
raguan and the third to be nominated by
Great Britain and Nicaragua jointly, or,
failing an agreement, by Switzerland.

KOREA'S AFFAIRS
IN A BAD TANGLE
Safety Not Found in the
Confusing Conflict of
Interests.
NO BENEFIT IN SIGHT.
Sovereignty Exists Only Under
the Shadow r of a Foreign
Flag.
CONTROLLED BT THE RUSSIANS
The Political Crisis in Japan Caused
by the Coup d'Etat Narrowly
Averted.
TOKIO, Japan, March 3.â At no time
since the opening of Korea to foreign in
tercourse have her domestic affairs been in
such disorder as at present. The Viceroy
Li, who, in his days of greatness, used to
be virtually King of the peninsula, in
tended, when he introduced her to the
outer world, that she should find safety in
a conflict of interests. He did not foresee
that the interests of two powers, Japan
and Russia, must ultimately dominate all
others and that the little kingdom would
become the arena of their rivalry. There
is no reason to doubt that had Japan been
left in undisturbed possession of the posi
tion of vantage won by her in war she
would have introduced order into the af
fairs of Korea and led the Koreans defi
nitely into the paths of progress.
But Russia, Germany and .France ousted
her from that position, explicitly because
her tenure of it would render the inde
pendence of the peninsular kingdom illu
sory. Thenceforth not only did the three
European powers become the declared
guardians of Korean independence, but
Japan was morally and practically crip
t)led for the task she had undertaken â the
task of educating the Korean nation in the
essentials of self-defense. From every act
of Japan the Koreans knew that a high
court of appeal existed in Europe, and the
agents of the chief judge of that court,
Russia, were never idle in turning the les
son to good account. Tie result is that
Korea has suffered from all the confusion
of reform without reaping any of its bene
fits.
Tb-day the sovereignty of her sovereign
exists only under the shadow of a foreign
flae; her Ministers dare not carry on their
functions outside the Russian legation;
her Government has no troops that it can
safely employ either for its own pro
tection or to quell insurrections that
devastate the provinces; her new admin
istrators see no hope of safety for them
selves except by exterminating the most
prominent of their official opponents:
local rioters, encouraged by the injudicious
language of royal proclamations, seize and
slay every partisan of progress upou whom
they can lay hands; the Russian legation
is the seat of government, while the dis
orders in the interior are quelled by Jap
anese troops only; the finances of the
kingdom, on the eve of being regulated by
Japanese experts, have again fallen into a
state of insolvency ; and, on the whole, the
unhappy kingdom may be said to have
drifted into a series of political vendettas,
which, commencing in 1881, culminated
on February 11, 1896, and will certainly be
continued in the near future unless some
strong hand interferes.
The responsibility rests now on Europe,
Japan having been incapacitated by the*
action of Russia, France and Germany.
The Japanese statesmen will try to bring
about an agreement of Western powers,
with the object of neutralizing the penin
sula and having the conduct of essential
reforms entrusted to some one state. Un
less that can be effected, the alternative is
plainâ an understanding between Russia
and Japan to tne exclusion of all others.
Mrs. Dr. Underwood, the wife of a very
able American missionary who is now a
prominent figure in the fields both of
Korean propagandise and Korean poli
tics, has addressed to English local jour
nals in the far East a letter declaring
that not a foreigner in Seoul has any feel
ing toward the Japanese except one of
detestation. This statement is strongly
denied by other missionaries in the Korean
capital, who aver that such an assertion is
the outcome of prejudice and emotional
want of discernment. Mrs. Dr. Under
wood was a fiiend and warm admirer of
the murdered Queen . Naturally she en
tertains keen resentment against every one
connected with the murder.
An instance of the strange fearlessness
of the Japanese was furnished during the
disturbances in Seoul on the 11th of Feb
ruary. While an infuriated mob was
savagely mutilating the naked corpses of
the two Cabinet Ministers assassinated by
the police a solitary Japanese interfered
and endeavored to save the bodies from
further indignity. He was immediately
stoned and clubbed to death.

cluding one woman, have been foully mur
dered by Korean rioters since the coup
d'etat of February 11. The Tokio Govern
ment is showing resolute patience in the
presence of these outrages. It appreciates
the powerlessness of the Korean executive
to deal with the anarchy now prevailing in
the peninsula, and refrains from preferring
demands that mnst tend only to precipi
tate a more acute crisis.
It is unfortunate for Russia that the dis
graceful disorders occurring in the penin
sula should mark an epoch when the ad
ministration of Korean affairs is conducted
from within the walls of the Russian lega
tion. MM. de Speyer and Waeber, the
representatives of the great nortnern
power in Korea, who of course
acted without the authority of the Cabi
net in St. Petersburg, cannot have ap
preciated the extreme difficulties that
beset Japan's unobstrusive efforts to main
tain order and inaugurate progress or they
would not have lightly lent the authority
of their country's flag to a cabal bent upon
upsetting all that had been accomplished
and not furnished with resources or
strength to build an ything stable on the
ruins. It must at least be said to Japan's
credit that she never incurred the danger
of provoking disorders without making
provision of means to quell them.
But Russia's agents appear to have
thought that a hundred marines and one
fieldpiece to guard the incloaure of a for
eign legation where the King and bis Cabi
net were hiding from a nation that they
dare not attempt to govern openly would
suffice to meet the wants of a situation
amounting to something very like
anarchy. That is not Russia's wonted way
of doing things; stie is nothing if not
thorough. But in truth she labora
under disadvantages cognate with those
that impeded Japan's efforts to civilize
the peninsula. Even if she were
prepared to attempt anything immediately
against the independence of Koreaâpre
pared, in other words, to assume the con
trol of administrative affairs there, she i 3
barred by her pledge given when England
evacuated Port Hamilton in 1836, and still
more by her association with Germany
and France, who joined her in forcing
Japan out of Liaotung on the explicit
ground of preserving Korean indepsnd
ence. Her interference in Korea must
partake, therefore, of the impotence for
conclusive results that has crippled Japan
also.
Japan, however, has one bright page in
her record. Throughout the whole time
of Count Inouye's residence in Seoul Korea
remained comparatively tranquil. There
were no political emeutes in the capital,
and the remaining disturbances of the
Tonghaks in the provinces were steadily
and successfully quelled.
Count Inouye showed that Japan was
competent to solve the Korean problem
were she suffered to pursue the under
taking without jealous interruption from
abroad. But Count Inouye's conception
of the real inwardness of the situation,
his conviction that only by a general
agreement on the part of the Western
powers could a complete remedy be ap
plied, was not at that time shared by the
ToKio Cabinet. He returned to Japan,
only to hear of disorder succeeding disor
der in his absence, and to see his foresight
confirmed by events that now necessitate
the course he then advocated.
The political crisis, nearly precipitated
in Japan on receipt of intelligence about
the recent coup d'etat in Korea has been
averted. The balance of power in the Diet
is held by a party numbering thirty mem
bers and calling themselves the National
Unionists.

WIDOW'S LUCK
Marries Her First Love
and a Fortune Down
in Chile.
SYNOPSIS OF THE STORY
As a Fickle Maiden, Just for
Spite, She Wedded the
Wrong Man.
THE DISTRACTED LOVER'S VOW
The Meeting at ValparaisoâExplana
tions, Forgiveness and a Bliss
ful Union.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., March 19. â Last
October Mrs. G. Franze, who had been
connected with the Coronado Laundry,
left for Valparaiso, Chile, in company with
her sister and tne latter's husband, who is
in the oil business there. Mrs. Franze in
tended to make her Home in Chile, but
her friends were unprepared to learn of the
pretty romance that occurred upon her ar
rival in that far-off country. A letter from
the lady, who is now Mrs. Mason, gives an
inkling of the story.
It appears that nineteen years ago Mrs.
Franze, who was then a pretty and buxom
young woman, suddenly changed her
mind, as maidens do, and married the
gentleman she was not expected to
marry. This was Franze. The disap
pointed loverâ Mason â was so affected that
he swore he would nevery marry nor re
turn to his old home. He neprhis vow to
the letter. He went to Chile and accumu
lated a competency. He learnad 'some
months ago that Mrs. Franze was a widow,
her husband having died some years ago.
Mason learned her address and found that
she was in poor circumstances, earning her
living by hard work at the Coronado Laun
dry. He renewed his offer of nineteen
years before and Mrs. Franze accepted
him. He sent her money and she sailed
from San Francisco October 21 on the
6teamer San Jose.
On December 18 last they met, when
Mrs. Franze stepped off the steamer Are
quipa at Valparaiso. Mr. Mason knew her
at a glance and greeted her with a warmth
that was excusable under the circum
stances. Mrs. Franze did not recognize
him at first, as his hair was white, though
his face did not show age. Mrs. Mason's
own words appropriately say what further
happened :
"I arrived in Valparaiso at 3 p. m., and
before 4 o'clock I was his wife, as the min
ister and party were awaiting my coming.
"We remained in Valparaiso six days and
then sailed for Talcahuano. On arriving
there a large party met us and welcomed
me to Chile. The house was all decorated
with beautiful flowers, and the servants
also welcomed me to my new home. Mr.
Mason is so happy now. Isn't this true,
love? I am happy, too, to think that I
have righted the wrone I did him nineteen
years ago."
NOTES FROM PALO ALTO
A Splendid Game of Baseball
Between Stanford and Santa
Ana College Nines.
Lange's Coaching Countsâ The Spring
Vacation â Basket-Ball Team
Practicing Daily.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 19. â The game of baseball here this
afternoon between the Stanford and Santa
Ana College nine was one of the prettiest
games ever played on the campus. Stan
ford plainly showed the benefit of Lange's
coaching and outplayed the visitors at
most points. The infield played strong
and the fact that but one basehit was made
off McLaine's delivery speaks almost as
highly for the infielders as for the pitcher.
Jeffs caught well and batted in good snape.
For the visitors Kuster, Steffani and
Graham did noticeable work. The men
and their positions on the diamond were as
follows:
Santa Clara. Position. Stanford.
Steffant Pitcher McLaine
Graham Catcher Jeffs
Parry First base : . . . .Freeman
Kelley Second base Harris
>- U eent Third base Sharp
Xuster Shortstop. Taylor
x 0 ley Leftfield Stansbery
Perera. Center held Wight
MorrUy Rlgbtfield Thompson
The score ended 5 to 0 in Stanford's fa
vor. Special interest was tasen in this
game, inasmuch as it indicated about the
final selection of the Varsity nine. As the
team played to-day they will probably
play against Berkeley. There may be a
couple of changes, but certainjy not more
than tt>at. .
The short spring vacation begins to
morrow at noon and lasts one week. Most
of the students will remain here during
the intermission, as the time is too short
to permit of any extended trips home.
The track and baseball men will continue
their regular practice each day, and there
may be some interesting athletic events
held during the recess.
The basket-ball team ia practicing regu
larly, and Captain McCray says that her
team will be ready to play Berkeley early
in April. None of the players ever thought
of such a thing as playing before a mixed
audience and would have rejected such a
proposition had Berkeley made it. The
utmost friendliness has marked all nego
tiations between the officials of the rival
teams and the games will probably be
played in San Francisco. No one but
women will be allowed to witness the
game. >
MOCK VS. SAM A ROSA.
Tetting the Validity of the Xeu> Water
Works Contract.
SANTA ROSA, Gal., March 19.â The
famous case of Mock vs. Santa Rosa, to
test the validity of the contract under
which the new water works were con-
Btructed has been on trial here all day
to-day. Attorney Goodwin has been on
the stand most of the day. Half a dozen
spectators and twice as many lawyers were
greatly edified by the numerous tilt? be
tween the lawyer- witness and Attorney
Lynch. The only sensation of to-day in
this very sensational litigation was that of
Attorney Lynch demanding a bench war
rant for the arrest of Contractor Perkins,
which the Judge refused to issue. After
Lawyer Goodwin had finished a rigid
cross-examination of himself Mayor Wood
ward occupied the stand until adjourn
ment. The case will be continued to-mor
row.
FATE OF A MEXICAN GIRL.
Huppoted to Hare Been Murdered by Her
Tucson Employer.
TUCSON, Ariz., March 19.â Saron*. a
lime-burner, brought word to Tucson of
the finding of the remains of a woman
near the Tucson Mountains last night.
To-day the Coroner, with a party, left for
the place described by Sarona, about ten
miles west of town, and in an isolated spot
came upon the scattered remains of a fe
male. They found pieces of a dress, a
pocket-book containing two half dollars
and various trinkets. They brought the
remains are articles with them, and upon
being placed on exhibition the clothing
was identified as that of Joaquina, a Mexi
can girl, who worked for one Zapeda, a
Mexican baker, iast fall. The material of
the apparel and the articles, including a
bloody towel, were the means of her iden
tification.
Joaquina disappeared last August, after
having a quarrel with her employer, who
had previously beat her unmercifully.
The supposition is that she was murdered
and taken to this isolated spot, there to let
the coyotes feast over her remains, by her
late employer. To strengthen this suppo
sition a short time after her disappearance
Zapeda sold out his business and left un
der peculiar circumstances. He said he
was going to Bisbee, Ariz., but did not
go there and has not been heard of since.
An inquest will be held on the remains to
morrow. If the suspicion now held is sus
tained a vigorous hunt will be begun for
the missing baker.

Phillips of San Francisco was arrested in
this city last night by Detective Anderson
on a charge of embezzlement preferred by
Joseph Lancenderf er, the publisher of J the
Sporting "World in San Francisco. Phillips
was employed as a collector by Langen- \

$35 to his own use. . Langenderfer was in
this city at the time the arrest was made
and after Phillips had explained his ab
sence from San Francisco satisfactorily he
expressed his willingness to have the com
plaint dismissed. Phillips admitted hav
ing the money, but explained his failure
to turn it in to his being called here by his
mother's illness. Phillips was taken to

AFTER A TRUANT HUSBAND
Mrs. Frankie Putnam of Los
Angeles Is Heartlessly
Deserted.
Should She Fail to Find the Run
away She Threatens to Kill
Herself.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 19.â Mrs.
Frankie E. Putuam is missing from the
city, and the pathetic letter which she
left behind her causes fear that she may
kill herself.
Several days ago Mrs. Putnam expected
her husband, CharJes Putnam, from
Tucson. On the appointed day he failed
to come. Nearly a week afterward a crnel
letter came from him in San Faancisco
stating that he was done with her forever
and that he intended shipping to Alaska.
Immediately she went to Chief of Police
Glass and with tears related her story.
When she was informed that the police
could not act in the matter she was over
come with disappointment.
This morning J. D. Steele found a letter
in his furniture-store at 257 South Main
street, where Mrs. Putnam had been yes
terday to sell some of her household goods
to get money to pay her fare north. The
letter is addressed to Mrs. Wood and in it
she says that she walked all the previous
night without sleep or food. She is going
to find her husband, she says, and if she
fails in that she will kill herself. She has
purchased laudanum for that purpose.
The unfortunate woman left for San Fran
cisco on the noon train yesterday, and
unless she finds her husband or the au
thorities interfere the next that is heard of
her will be her death. J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
TAMALPAIS ROAD
IS ENJOINED.
Maurice Windmiller of Mill
Valley Secures an
Injunction.
FORCED TO STOP WORK.
The Fight for Possession of the
Eoad Taken to the
Courts.
A MEETING OF DIRECTORS.
The Purchase of a Right of Way
Through the Lands of J. H.
Mclnnes Is Confirmed.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 19.â An
injunction was served upon Sidney B.
Cushing, president of the Mill Valley and
Mount Tamalpais Railroad, and Superin
tendent Graves of the California Construc
tion Company this afternoon, restraining
them from laying tracks or ties on either
Corte Madera or Blythedale avenues at
this place.
The injunction proceedings were insti
tuted at the instance of Maurice Wind
miller, a property-owner on Corte Madera
avenue and a member of the Mill Valley
Property-owners' Association.
The papers in the injunction suit were
filed with County Clerk Bennean at San
Rafael about noon to-day.
A temporary injunction was issued by
Judge Angelotti and the papers were im
mediately sent to Mill Valley, where they
were served by Deputy Constable E. E.
Gray. If the papers had been served half
an hour later the road would have been
completely constructed.
This morning the California Construc
tion Company put a force of about 100 men
at work grading Corte Madera and Blythe
dale avenues and hauling rails and ties onto
the roads for the construction of the rail
road. At 12 o'clock this force was in
creased and all possible haste was made to
rush the road through before any legal
means were resorted to in order to Btop
them. When the injunction papers ar
rived the ties were being put in place to
receive the rails and a short delay would
have been fatal to the interests of the peo
ple.
Mr. Windmiller in his complaint for an
injunction alleges that he has been, for
over three years, the owner of a free right
of way over all avenues, streets, etc., in
Mill Valley ; that the streets or roads have
never been dedicated to the public for use
or otherwise and that the same are not nor
have ever been subject to the control of a
municipal corporation, but have been sub
ject to the absolute and exclusive control
of the owners of land.
The complaint further alleges that the
Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
Railroad and the California Construction
Company, absolutely without any permis
sion whatsoever from any party, person or
board, threaten to and are proceeding to
build and construct along and upon Corte
Madera avenue a steam and electric rail
way, and threaten to make excavations
and embankments, and that if this is done
the avenues will be # rendered almost
wholly impassable for vehicles and will in
terfere with the use of plaintiff's property,
besides greatly depreciate the value of the
property.
On the undertaking for the injunction
are the names of George T. Marsh and M.
M. O'Shaughnessy, both wealthy men and
members of the Mill Valley Property-own
ers' Protective Association.
'Judge Angelotti set the 24th day of this
month as the time for the hearing of the
order to show cause why the injunction
should not issue as prayed for in Mr.
Windmjjle/'s complaint.
A meeting of the directors of the Moun
tain Road Company was held yesterday,
and the only important business trans
acted was the ordering of the purchase of
the right of way through the lands of J.
H. Mclnnes, as told in yesterday's dis
patches to The Call.
"The mountain road is now effectually
blocked," said a member of the protective
association to-day, "and the only way out
of the difficulty for them is to give up
the idea of running its track on Corte
Madera avenue. We do not intend to
allow them to proceed, and seven other
injunction suits will be filed by different
parties owning property on Corte Madera
avenue if it is found necessary. The rail
road company did not consult the people
before going ahead, and the result is going
to be disastrous for them."
E. Moffat, an owner of Corte Madera
avenue property, said to-day that he had
no objection to the mountain road cross
ing the avenue, bnt if it intended to run
for any length upon it as the line was now
mapped out he would file a suit restrain
ing them upon his own account.
Corte Madera avenue is considered one
of the prettiest drives in Mill Valley, and
along its route are the homes of Prison
Commissioner Daniel E. Hayes. J. Costi
gan, H. S. Bridge, George Billings, Wil
liam Harrold and other well-known busi
ness men of San Francisco. All are de
cidedly against having the road run upon
the avenue, even for the short distance of
300 yards, as the plans are now.
About a month ago the attention of the
mountain road people was called to the
fact that the people would not submit to
their occupation of the roads, but repre
sentatives of the land and water company
asserted that the title to the roads rested
in them, and they could do with them as
they saw fit. This outburst aroused a
feeling of indignation on the part of the
people, and it was agreed to fight any at
tempt on the part of the railroad to gain
possession of the roads.
If the injunction is refused by Judge
A ngelotti next Tuesday then the'railroad
and the construction company will sue
the bondsmen on the undertaking for the
injunction for damages on account of de
laying the building of the road.
While the people of Mill Valley are
heartily in favor of the mountain-road
project they object to having their roads
ruined and have pointed out to the build
ers of the road how they can run their
line a few hundred yards to the east and
avoid the avenue entirely. This will have
to be done if the railroad is to be in run
ning order by this summer, for injunction
and damage suits filed one after another
will throw the road into such a hopeless
mass of litigation that it will take years
before it is all over.

Indian Sealing Viatel* r,,n ft seatedâlm
portant to Mariner*.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 19.â
Last season the Indian schooners Puritan
and C. C. Perkins were seized by the au
thorities for an alleged violation of the
treasury laws : requiring a special license
to all vessels engaged in the sealing busi
ness. The Indians made a great protect
at the time, but tbeir efforts availed them
not. Judge Hanford sustained the con
demnation proceedings and has ordered
the two little vessels confiscated to the
Government, to be sold by the United
States Marshal at such time as tne Secre
tary of the Treasury may direct.
The Puritan and Perkins constitute a
part of the fleet of schooners owned by
the natives residing on the United States
reservation atNeah Bay, and are the prin
cipal source of income through which
some of them have amassed no small for
tunes. The Puritan, which, by the way,
is a first-class schooner in every particu
lar, is owned by one of the natives glory
ing in the name of Schuyler Colfax, while
the Perkins is the property of Lighthouse
Jim, one of the most notorious scoundrels
that ever cut the throat of a shipwr.ecked
sailor or robbed the body of one who died
through exposure.
A tug from Cape Flattery this evening
reports the Neah Bay whistling buoy sunk
and that the Dungeness buoy is two miles
east from her designated position on the
chart. Both are material aids to Puget
Sound shipping, and masters of vessels
will do well to note the above.
THOUGHT TO BE TASCOTT
Millionaire Snell's Murderer or
His Double Seen in the
Yukon Country.
He Cleaned Up About $100,000 in Four
Years and Mysteriously
Disappeared.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 19.â An after
noon paper publishes a Port Townsend
special in the shape of an interview with
one Meyers, who for ten years has edited the
Juneau Mining Record, in which the news
paper man expresses the opinion that
Tascott, who murdered millionaire Snell
in Chicago in 1888, made his escape to the
Yukon country, where, under the alias of
George Hayes, he spent four succeeding
years as a miner. Tom Nelson, a pioneer
AlasKa miner, who knew Hayes well dur
ing that period, concurs in this opinion.
With the influx of prospectors in i 892 to
Yukon, Hayes suddenly left the country,
having in four years cleaned up, accord
ing to the estimate of his mining asso
ciates, about $100,000. The striking like
ness of photographs of Tascott to Hayes,
was often commented upon, and "it Was
generally whispered about campfires. "
says Nelson, "that Hayes was the real
murderer of Snell." Mevers, concurring
in this belief, said : "Personally lam con
vinced that Hayes was in fact young Tas
cott."

LAST OBSTACLE JtJEMOFED.
The Corral Hollow Railroad Will Soon
Be Completed.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 19.â The last
obstable to the early completion of the
Corral Hollow Railroad was removed
to-day -when a deed was filed transferring
forty-two acres of right of way in the
Crocker-Dillon tract to the railroad. This
is the land at the mouth of the canyon for
which the owners demanded $30,000 from
the railroad company for the privilege of
crossing. The completion of the railroad
would be impossible without crossing this
tract, and for a while it looked as though
a long legal fight would be necessary be
fore the company could obtain the right
of-way at reasonable figures. The diffi
culty has, however, been amicably settled,
as the consideration in the deed is but
nominal. The company on its part agrees
to maintain switches and fences and ren
der other services to the owners of the
ranches.
In the Chieo Lockup.
CHI CO, Cat.., March 19.â Frank Case,
representing himself as an internal rev
enue collector and â wearing a badge, was
arrested last night and locked up in jail.
He went to the City Brewery and told the
proprietor he had come to inspect his
place and exhibited his badge. While
doing so he got full of beer. Deputy Dunn
of this place was notified and he told Mr.
Dunn he did it all as a joke. It is liable to
be a costly one, as the United States Mar
shal and Collector Stairley of Sacramento
were notified.

AFTER THE TAGUS
TRAIN HOLD-UP
The- Wounds of Deputy
Sheriffs Reed and
Daggett.
CLEWS OF THE OFFICERS
The Dead Robber Was a Promi
nent Church Member
of Fresno.
SANTA CRTJZ ALSO CLAIMS HIM.
Bakersfield Has Had an Inkling of
the Conspiracy for Some
Time Past.
TULARE, CaxÂ», March 19.â Ai a result
of the attempted hold-up this morning the
body of Dan McCall, horribly lacerated,
lies in the undertaking rooms of Locey,
Dungan & Co. in this city; two men, Si
Lovern and Charles Ardell, are in jail on
suspicion of being accomplices, and two
Depnty Sheriffs, Reed and Daggett, are in
the doctors' hands.
Reed was shot through the muscle of the
left arm, near the shoulder, and his wound
is not serious. Daggett was shot through
the right side, just above the hip-bone.
The bullet went almost through, and was
cut out just under the skin by the doctors
here.
Dan McCall was a laborer who worked
around this neighborhood for some time.
OFFICERS RETICEST.
Believe They Have Clews of Great Im
portance.
FRESNO, Cal., March 19.â The officers
refuse to tell what clews they have for fear
it would interfere with their search for the
suspected parties, but the following facts
are learned from unquestionable authority :
More than a week ago it jvas ascertained
that one of the Dalton gang, formerly
operating in Indian Territory and Okla
homa, had put in his appearance in Tulare
County, and it was believed that a holdup
would be attempted in a few days. The
officers at Fresno, as well as other points
along the line, were notified to be on the
lookout.
About the same time, or a day or two j
later, two suspicious characters were
Men in Fresno. They were not known
by name, but their actions at once at
tracted suspicion. Hi Rapelje, who
fought Evans and Sontae at Stone Cor- i
ral, was put on the track of these men,
and he, in company with John Barrett
of the Fre?no police force, shadowed !
them for several days and nights. Tt
was discovered that they invariably
kept out of sight by day and at night !
remained in the background. They ,
could be seen in back alleys of China
town late at night, and if they had \
not been watched for special reasons their
general conduct would have excited sus- j
picion anyway. They were strangers \
here, and seemed to be putting in their
time while waiting for orders from else
where.
Their orders were evidently received
yesterday, for about the S3me time that
the Tulare officers learned, through the
weakening of one of the gang there,
that the hold-up was ready to be put
into execution the men in Fresno dis
appeared. It was supposed they had
left'town, but watch was kept for them
and it was rewarded by a discovery
which is almost conclusive evidence that
these men belonged to the gang. When
the train from San Francisco arrived there
the.se suspicious characters put in an ap
pearance and boarded the train as pas
sengers. Since then they have not been
heard of, but it is believed they were on
the train at the time of the attempted
robbery.
It is believed here that although the j
officers were informed of the intended I
hold-up, with the exact place and nearly |
the exact hour, Deputy Sheriffs Daggett 'â¢
and Reed were nevertheless taken by sur
prise, and were not looking for a hold-up j
at that time, but believed it was planned
for the northbound train, which
would be due at Goshen about an hour >
later. It is tnonght that Daggett and j
Reed were on their way from Goshen to
Tulare for the purpose of boarding the
northbound train at Tulare and guarding
it toward Fresno, believing it was the
northbound train which was to beheld up.
So when McUall crawled over the ten- I
der he" caught them by surprise, and when '
he saw them a^id it flashed on him that he I
was in for it he opened fire. He shot
twice before the officers could raise their
guns and his aim was accurate, as the first |
shot passed through Daegett's body, and
it is feared will prove fatal, and the second
struck Reed, making a wound that is not
â o serious.
Daggett fired both barrels of his shot-
Eun at once, and the charge passed
through McCall's abdomen, kihing him
instantly. In fact, his body was nearly
torn asunder, and he dropped his rifle
and rolled off the tender. The train
did not stop till it reached Tulare, five
miles distant. The northbound was
stopped at the place where McCall fell and
found bis body lying by the track. The
body was carried to Ooshen.
THIS DEAO liOBBEB
Wat a Church Member and formerly
Worked in I'renno.
OAKLAND, Cat,., March 19.â Train 20
arriveu in Oakland to-day. It was the
crew of this train that found the body of
the dead robber.
Pullman Conductor E. C. Cunningham
says that the man shot had a two-pound
can of dynamite tied on his person under
bis coat at the right side.
News Agent J. W. Christie, who helped
to place the body in the baggage-car, says
that the officers recognized the man as Joe
McCall, not McCole, as at first reported.
The man had formerly worked for Picks
in Fresno. He wa3 a regular church at
tendant, and the last one they would sus
pect of such an act had he not been killed
while committing tbe deed. In the dead
man's pockets were found fourteen cart
ridges of 44-caliber, a knife, a cigar, but no
money.
Mail Clerk E. Hiskle of train 19 re
â¢ turned on No. 20. He says that the
Deputy Sheriffs were seated yi the ten
der with tbe backs to the train when
McCall ordered the engineer to stop,
covering him with a revolver and the
fireman with his rifle. Then, seeing the
men below, he dropped his guns, firing
point blank. The men were taken by stir
pri; c, as they were only going to Tulare to
join the posse on No. 20.
j>a.kersfieijl> aor susfbised.
Knetc All the Time mat a Bold- Up Waa
on the Tap It.
UAKERSFIELD, Cal., March 19.â 1t
hid been known for three weeks that a
train hold-up was on the tapis, and the
event had been expected to come off at
any time.
S. Loveren, now under arrest at Visalia,
has been employed in various dives here
for some time, until about three weeks
ago, when he left and went to Visalia. At
the time he left it got out in some myste-'
nous manner that the train robbery was*
to come off soon, in which he was inter
ested.
Detective Brighton, who caught Evans
at Visalia, has been here for some time,
and he^got a tip of the affair quite a while
ago. Railroad, express and county offi
cials here were all notified yesterday, but
somehow it was jriven out to all that the
northbound train was the one to be held up.
It is thought there was a possibility that
the gang meant to attack the northbound
train the night before, on which Kid
Thompson was a passenger, bound for San
Quentin to be hanged. On the trip that
r.ight Thompson made frequent reference
to the possibility of the train being robbed
and joked about it. It is certain he had
many friends among the toughs in the
valley. He used to be in Bakersfield and
was well known among the criminal ele
ment.
BAXTA CRUZ CLAIMS HIM.
McCall Formerly Lived in the City by
the Sea.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 19.â Dan
McCall, the train-robber who was killed at
Goshen at an early hour this morning, was
formerly a Santa Cruzan.
He was born and raised in this commun
ity, and was always considered a steady,
honest, bard-working fellow. The mother,
brothers and son of the dead man are at
present residents of this city.
James McCall will go to Yisalia to-mor
row. He believes Obie Butt was a former
schoolmate of his.
JONES JURY DISAGREES.
Stood Seven to Five for Convic
tion and Was Discharged
by the Court.
Great Excitement on the Streets of
Carsonâ Date of Next Trial
Not Yet Set.
CARSON, Nev., March 19.â The jury in
the Jones case, which retired at noon yes
terday, came in at 10 o'clock this morning
and reported a disagreement. The court
sent tnem out again, and at 7 o'clock this
evening they came in again and handed
the following to the Judge:
Jrp.Y-r.ooM, March 19.
To the Hon. Judge of the United States District
Courtâ We, the jury, desire to state to the
honorable court that we find it Impossible to
agree, and ask to be discharged. Any further
consideration of the case would be an absolute
waste of time. George Wilcox, Foreman.
The jury was thereupon discharged. It
stood seven to five for conviction. Those
voting guilty were: Hamm, Butler, Berry,
Ed Morton. Walter Morton, Bly and Me-
Farland; not guilty, Wilcox, Elliot, Whit
comb, Farley and Larsen.
There was great excitement and specula
tion all day in Carson over the probable
result, and some betting. A disagreement
was generally expected. Adherents of
both sides of the case stood about the
street near the courthouse all day, waiting
for the jury to come in. The defense
asked for the next trial to ba set at once,
but the court, in the absence of General
Clarke, said he would wait until Monday.
The court adjourned until that day.
The United States Grand Jury was
drawn to-day to consider other cases in
connection with the mint' matter. The
case of Coffin, the attorney, will be pre
sented. He is charged with running wit
nesses out of the country in the Heney
case. â¢: *

EDITOJiS AT LOGGERHEADS.
The Disposition of Government Adver
tising Causes Jealousy.
VISALIA, Cal., March 19.â The Times
to-day published an interview with United
States Register Patrick in reply to the al- j
legation made by Editor Dewey of the
Lemoore Leader that he had discriminated
against that paper in withholding from it
Government advertising.
Although Mr. Patrick declined to dis
cuss the matter he furnished the inter
viewer with a copy of the statement he had
recently forwarded to the Commissioner
of the General Land Office in refutation of
Mr. Dewey 's charge.".
In the course of the statement, which is
quite voluminous, Mr. Patrick says:
The statement made by Mr. Dewey that I have
conferred the publication of land notices in his
district, not as the law plainly intended and
directs, but as favors to friends and rewards
for political services, is maliciously false. I
have never asked and have never been granted
a political favor or favor of any description by
the editor of the Haiiford Democrat, Mr. W. W.
Barnes, who now enjoys the land office patrou
age in Kings County. "
I will call your attention to the fact that
there is some stress laid on the point that
the Lemoore Leader is, or will be, a Democratic
journal. I have not seen fit to controvert
those statements. In my opinion the politics
of a newspaper should not be considered
in the disposition of land-office patron
age in the way of advertising; however, if any
evidence on that point is required I can fur
nish overwhelming proof that the Leader
never has been, is not now nor can it ever be n,
Democratic journal while controlled by any
member of the Dewey tamily. They are a lot
of journalistic freaks and have no political
convictions.
What action the Commissioner will take
it iÂ«, of course, impossible to foretell but
it is certain that Editor Dewey has suc
ceeded in stirring up quite a little commo
tion in Democratic circles in this section
of the State.
DIVINE HEALER PVTJfJLJa.
Overrun by Afflicted Personaâ They Cone
From J-Vir and Sear.
PORTLAND, Or., March 19.â "Divine
healer" W. E. Putnam, who came here
about a week ago to cure the halt, the sick
and blind through the spirit of Jesus
Christ, so he says, is being overrun by af
flicted.
A sign in front of his quarters on Alder '
street reading, "The Christ method of
healing; inquirers welcome," is attracting
large crowds Irom morning to night. Many
who have called on the healer from sheer
curiosity have left his presence convinced
that the man is wonderfully gifted.
His fame is beginning to reach out into
the country and many strangers are com
ing to town to' try bis treatment. He saj s
that he does not pretend to offect instan
taneous cures, but that he will guarantee
improvement of the condition of his pa
tients in proportion to the increase'or
strengthening of their faith.
He claims that he is inspired to perform
work without temporal reward, also that
any other man who will cast aside all
doubt as to the divine power of Christ can
accomplish as much as he.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
STOCKTON AND
FRESNO UNITING
An Important Conference of
the Valley Railroad
Officials.
THE WORK TO BE PUSHED
Engineers Calculate to Complete
the Line to Fresno by
August i.
TO HANDLE THIS YEAR'S CEOPS
Foundries Busy Turning Out Castings
and Industry Is Manifest
Everywhere.
STOCKTON, Gal.', March 19. â Vice-
Preaident Robert Watt of the Valley Rail
road, together with a number of the direc
tors and other officials, arrived in the city
this evening and an important conference
was held with the local engineers. The
roundhouses and depot of this city are to
be erected soon, and it is understood that
the work is to be prosecuted through the
country as fast as possible, and as soon as
the first division of the road is completed
it will be placed in immediate operation,
in order that crops and freights in the
country through which it passes may be
handled this season.
It is calculated that the road will be
completed to Fresno by August 1, and
the constant arrival of materials, the com
pletion of the telegraph lines and other
adjuncts indicate that the equipment will
be complete to operate the road over this
division by the date mentioned.
Chief Engineer Storey stated this even
ing that while the company could handle
freights from the intermediate country
during that time, they preferred to bend
all their energies toward the completion
of the line to Fresno, and place it in oper
ation as soon as completed.
Right-of-way difficulties at the Fresno
end of the line are being adjusted, and
there will be nothing to impede the prog
ress of the work. A local foundry is now
turning out the castings for the round
house here and that superstructure will
soon be under way. The bridge work is
being completed as fast as possible, and
the prospect of establishing transportation
between here and Fresno by September is
not only possible but very probable.
THE XMVT BISHOF.
Met on the Road by a Gaily Decorated
Special Car.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 19.â The
new Bishop of the new diocese of Los
Angeles, the Right Rev. Joseph Horsfall
Johnson, received a warm welcome on his
arrival in Southern California to-day, en
route to Los Angeles.
This morning at 11 o'clock a large party
went out on a special train to- meet this
distinguished divine. The special observa
tion car was secured to-day, and most
exquisitely decorated by the church
women of Los Angeles and vicinity, and
this was placed by the Santa Fe at the dis
posal of the party appointed to meet the
Bishop.
.The car this morning presented a beauti
ful appearance, being most lavishly dec
orated with beautiful flowers. The princi
pal color effects were white and gold, as
great masses of callas were psed, alternat
ing with quantities of the soft and Deauti
ful golden balls of the acacia, with the
foliage of each in charmine effects.
Baskets of the most beautiful carna
tions swung between the windows of the
car, and fleurs de Jis were also arranged in
effective masses of rich purple and laven
der.
The party arrived at 6 o'clock this even
ing and received an ovation from a large
number of church people who had gath
ered at the depot. â

going right ahead with preparations for
the carnival and they say the prospects
for its success are most excellent.

HOPEFUL STRIKE PRISONERS.

SUMMERLAND ELOPEMENT.
The Advocate' 8 Dashing Editor Runs
Away With a Frail Com
panion.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 19.âPub
lic opinion is no longer molded by Den
raan C. Ashmun at Summerland, a little
town a few miles out from Santa Barbara.
Ashmun, editor and proprietor of the
Summerland Advocate, according to. his
wife's statement, is speeding across the
country en route to Mobile, Ala., accom
panied by a woman not his wife. Mrs.
Ashmun is in the city looking for her run
away husband. She is a brunette, tall and
handsome, and has three children, the
eldest about 5 years old. She returned
only recently from a visit to Arizona.
It seems that during Mrs. Ashman's ab
sence a woman named "Mollie" gained
full possession of the editor's affections.
This fact was disclosed to Mrs. Ashmun
through some of her husband's mail which
accidentally came into her possession.
Last Sunday Ashmun left bis home, say
ing that he was going to Santa Barbara and
promising to return in the evening. His
wife became suspicious Monday morning
when he had not returned and began an
investigation.
Shs opened two of her husband's letters.
One of these letters was from the Mobile
and Ohio Railroad, inclosing a pass to
Mobile and stating that transportation
could not be furnished "the lady com
panion." The other letter was one Ash
mun had written some days before and
not being called for by the party to whom
it was addressed was returned to him. It
was from Ashmun to Mollie and was full
of those endearing terms that form a
large part of the correspondence of two
love-sick young people. Mrs. Ashmun
gained from this letter the information
that her husband and Mollie would meet
in Los Angeles Mondayâ the day on which
she opened the letterâ and they would
leave at once for Mobile. The wronged
wife took the first train for this city. She
learned that her husband and a lady com
panion had left on the overland for Ala
bama Monday afternoon.

GREAT FUN AT SAN DIEGO
Soldiers and Sailors Drilling,
Parading and Engaging in
Sham Battles.
The Call to Arms for a Sudden
Attack Was a Feature Last
Night.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 19.â There
are now 178 officers and men of the flag
ship Philadelphia in camp at North Island
all under command of CommanderÃ.il.
Ingersoll. This afternoon they were joined
by sixty officers and men of Company H,
First Infantry, stationed at the barracks.
The entire force thus constitutes quite an
army.
Strict navy and army rules are enforced.
Interesting drills were executed to-day. A
battalion drill took place this morning and
an artillery drill this afternoon in which
the regulars participated. After this series
of maneuvers, which consumed two hours
and was quite intricate, the troops were
out on dress parade. They were reviewed
by Reax- Admiral Beardslee, Captain Col
ton of the Philadelphia and Major Smith
of the barracks.
The island is a pretty sight to-night,
with the twinkling light of canpfires. A
special drill in the nature of a call to
arms for a sudden attack is to taKe place
to-night. When the men are all sound
asleep the bugle will sound "to arms."
Every man must respond promptly and
fall in line for active service.
A sham battle is on for to-morrow morn
ing. The men will break camp to-morrow
afternoon. They are enjoying themselves
between drills. Many have musical instru
ments, and several fine quartets have been
formed. The flagship band is in attend
ance to furnish music.
tiAILOIt FATALLY SHOT.
An Officer of the Oerman Ship Orient
Charged With the Crime.
SAN DIjKGO, Cal., March 19.â A deep
water sailor named Jack Kelly is lying at
the Sisters' Hospital with a bullet flattened
against his skull.
He was found this morning lying in a
miserable hovel on the bay shore, uncon
scious and lying in a pool of blood. Phy
sicians took several pieces of bone from
his skull and revived him somewhat.
He told a rambling story of assisting a
sailor to desert lrom the German ship
Orient, when the first.mate shot him.
Hs said he went' to the ship the
other day to get a job and was called
aside by one of the sailors, who said he
was held on board as a prisoner and that
he would pay Kelly big money if the latter
would help him to escape. Kelly agreed
and went alongside the ship in a boat.
He made the boat fast to the anchor
chain, and was climbing up the chain
when somebody shot him. He fell into
the water, but managed to get into his
boat and row ashore! Then he crawled
to his cabin, where he became uncon
scious.
This afternoon Ludwig Muhlbaurs, third
mate of the Orient, was arrested, charged
with the attempted murder of Kelly. His
bail was fixed at $2500, and he will* be ex
amined.
He says he was on watch and saw a man
climbing the anchor chain, who refused to
go away when ordered, and that he let
him have it. Kelly's hat bad three holes
in it and he will probably die. It is
hinted that the men had some previous
difficulty.

STRONG DEMAND
FOR PRIMARIES.
Mass -Meeting of Republi
cans at the Tabernacle
in Oakland.
P. M. FISHER'S SPEECH.
Resolutions of Protest Against
the Appointment of the
State Delegates.
FOR HARMONY IN ALAMEDA.
Bell, Coyle, Davis and Ellsworth
Appointed a Committee of
Conference.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 19. j
A large audience responded to the call
for a mass-meeting in the Tabernacle to
night to protest against the appointment
of delegates to the State Convention by
the Alameda delegation of the Third Dis
trict Congressional Committee and to de
mand primaries.
Chairman P. RJ. Fisher called the meet
ing to order, and in the following speech
outlined tbe purpose of the cull:
Some three weeks ago there appeared in a
local paper a statement to the effect that Drt
George Pardee and Hon. Eli Denison would
contest for the honor of delegate from this
Congressional district to the Republican Na
tional Convention at St. Louis. It was further
stated that as both gentlemen had expressed
themselves in favor of primaries, a battle royal
might be expected. This simple announce
ment opened the campaign in Oakland.
Thoughtful, conservative men who considered
the interest of the party above personal prefer
ence for a candidate feared for the resultof the
contest to follow. It could only revive mem
ories and excite animosities that in this Presi
dential year had better be unrecalled. Df.
Pardee is a very Hotspur, in the local political
field, daring torecklessness, a most loved and
most hated man, and of unblemished private
life, fearless in public position.
Senator Denison has been thrice hon
ored as our representative to a Na
tional Convention, in which he voted
for the unmistakable choice of his
district and the State, a white-haired veteran,
whose party fealty has never been questioned,
who has contributed liberally to necessary
campaign expenses, a good neighbor and a
kind-hearted man of whom the popular esti
mate is well voiced in the name, "Lncle Eli."
The State executive committee met and
passed a resolution leaving the manner of se
lecting delegates to the State Convention to
the Congressional committee of each district,
declaring in their resolution that the delegates,
however chosen, should elect delegates to the
National Convention, and do such other busi
ness as might properly come before them.
When the six members of the Alameda
County Committeo met in Oakland, as duly
advertised, a petition was presented to them,
signed by over two hundred of the best-known
Republicans of this city, calling for primaries,
â speakers addressed the committee, urg
ing the importance of submitting the selection
of delegates to the electors. The plea was
simple, straightforward, in good humor, and
its keynote was '-Let the rank and file vote."
The committee divided evenly, and, unfor
tunately, divided on just such lines as to indi
cate to the electors that the choice of delegates
lrorn Alameda County nad been predetermined.
At oncfc ill feeling was aroused and suspicion
excited. The attitude of the committee be
came the talk of the homes, street and clubs. .
Public sentiment was rapidly forming, but be
fore it could crystallize into that form in which
it might not well be defied the committee met
again, no general notice ot their meeting
being given, and by a vote 'of 5 to 1 deter
mined to themselves name the delegates. The
rumor then tookehape that these delegates so
appointed might, under the call of the State
Central Committee, nominate a Congressman.
and from this it was m an easy step to the fear
that there might be a general plan to do this
all over the State and thus prevent a popular
verdict upon the record of the present Con
gressmen. The resentment against the action
of the committee led to the call for this meet-
ing.
i hat it is competent for Republicans to thus
assemble and repeat in mess-meeting the ex
pression they have already given as individu
als and petition no fair man will attempt to
deny; that the action of the committee and ex
perience with other committees in the past
warrant this meeting no thoughttul man will
question. To denounce this meeting as in
expedient ia born of a distrust of the people,
if it is not the child of reprehensible motive.
It is easy and convenient to indulge in recrimi
nation, but such things do not make a political
party strong or keep it strong. Threats that only
the elect shall participate in the spotis do not
win the battle in which the massses do not
tight for sdolls.
It is true to-day as ever, and at this time if
possible more true, that no political party can
long enjoy the confidence or the people unless
its managers keep in close touch with them
and manifest this by a willingness to submit
every important proposal to popular indorse
ment. To select a delegate to the National con
vention may, or may not, in itself be a
small thing, but it must be remembered that
this is the opening movement to an important
campaign, and coming under conditions
in which the electors arc more
than usually sensitive, under most
distressing economic conditions, when grave
questions confront the people, in the midst of
a growing distrust of the usual political agen
cies, the committee might well have trusted
to the popular voice the determination of the
question In hand. That they may yet conclude
so to do is the hope of your chairman. It is
not now a question of which if any of two men
shall go to St. Louis but rather of whether the
people shall be trusted to select him. And
what is true of this district is true of every
district of the State.
Ex-Mayor W. R. Davis spoke of the po
sition oi the five committeemen to the
Republican party. .He spoke of them as
"the lingers and thumb on one hand, and
it the left hand."
"If we allow these tactics to be carried
out," said Mr. Davis, "a handful of men
can name every Congressman in this
State."
Stephen G. Nye and Dr. Bodie, F. S. and
W. H. Friend also spoKe. Rev. Dr. Coyle
was the next speaker. He said the most
beautiful thing that the five members of
the committee could do would be to repu
diate their actions of last Saturday night.
"We can stand some things," said lie,
"but when it comes to being totally shut
out we rebel. This has been done in this
instance and we have rebelled. I preach
toleration, but to tolerate political manage
ment to this extent is to carry it into tne
nature of crime."
There were loud cries for "Hudelson"
aud the chairman invited Rev. B. F.
Hudelson to the platform. He was loudly
cheered as he predicted defeat for any one
who accepted a nomination or any sup
port from delegates who were not elected
at primaries.
At the close the following resolutions
were adopted by a rising vote :
Resolved, That no principle in representative
govern meut or in the maintenance of party
unity and strength is sc important as lairly
ascertaining and honestly executing the wifl
of the majority.
Resolved, That the Republicans of Alameda
County in mass-meeting assembled do moÂ«t
earnestly protest against and except to the
action ot tne Alameda County members ef the
State Central Committee acting as the commit
tee of the Third Congressional District in de
termining for themselves that they themselves
shall appoint the delegates to the Slate Con
vention sooti to be held at Sacramento, instead
of calling primaries, at which all the members
of the party may exercise their choice, and en
joy the right of selecting their own representa
tives, according to the traditional policy and
historical course of the Republican party.
RcÃolvtd. That we most earnestly request that
the committee above named to reconsider its
action in the premises and proceed to call and
hold primaries throughout the county in ac
cordance with the time-honored usage of the
party, and to the end that entire harmony
shall characterize the party campaign in
Alameda County, and that the county shall
assume and hold its rightful position as the
banner Republican county in the State.
Resolved, That this assemblage repudiates

Sanden's Electric Belt in One Night.
Lame Back Has Its Terrors.
! . BAN JOSE, Cal., March 18, 1896.
â¢ DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: You ask me for a statement concerning my back since I
have been using your Electric Belt. I was under the Impression I had written you about it, but
whether or not, here goes: : I suffered irom a lame back all of 14 years as bad as any man could
suffer. I used to have to roll out of bed, and if 1 sat down I could.not get up for ten minutes.
I would almost cry with pain at times. I teied everything and got no relief till I got your Belt.
I received the Belt on the 7th day of last month (February). I put it on the evening of the
same day, wore it all night. I had not a pain<in the morning. I went to work feeling well and
have had no pain since, and don't expect any if 1 take care of myself. . That is The truth and I
am thankful to you and the Belt for being able to say it. â  You can do as you please with this
statement. You know where I live. â  ; Yours truly, THOS. O'CONNOR, "
\\ â¢ â¢ â  "' _â  â  - . : â¢; ' 64 South River street, San Jose, Cal.
Mr. O'Connor has probably worn all sorts of plasters and
tried every thing in the ; way of liniments, besides ; the numerous
prescriptions the doqtors give for lame back, during the fourteen
years he suffered â and after all Dr. Sanden's Belt cured him 'in
one night. :; It seems almost beyond belief, but r the statement is
straight from the heart, and it is true. Do you suffer from lame
back ? 'Do you suffer from any weakness or pain ? If so, discard
drugs and plasters and try this famous Electric Belt. Get the
book about it, free. Address

REV. REED OF PORTLAND
The Bank Robber Bobs Up Again
and Returns to the Insane
Asylum.
While Dodging the Penitentiary His
Wife Is Passing Sweated $20
Pieces.
PORTLAND, Ok., March 19.â Shortly
after the Rev. J. C. Reed was released
frcm the State Insane Asylum, to which
place he succeeded in being committed to
escape the penitentiary for robbing an
East Portland bank, he went to California.
He was pronounced "sane" by the asylum
physicians. .
The months rolled by and the Rev. Mr.
Reed turned Tip at his home, claiming to
be sieir, penniless and utterly discouraged,
his trip to California having been without
result so far as bettering his condition was
concerned.
After he had been home a short time
Mrs. Reed complained to the authorities
and asked that her husband be returned
to the asylum, his mania having again
broken out, ana in a suicidal form. Her ,
request was granted, and Reed, is now an
inmate of the Salem Insane Asylum.
For several days past the merchants of
Oregon City, where Mr. Reed and his fam
ily reside, have been visited by Mrs. Reed,
who, making a small purchase, would in*
variably tender a $20 gold piece in pay
ment, requesting that smail gold coin be
given her in exchange.
So often was this maneuver repeated
that it was not long before the merchants
began to speak of the number of ?20 coins
Mrs. Reed was possessed of. Suspicion
being aroused one of the coins she had
passed was sent to the bank for testing.
It was found to have been sweated and
was $1 50 short in weight.
Further investigation revealed that %
short time prior Mrs. Reed had purchased
line druggists' scales and acids such as is
used in making cold solution. The
woman when questioned offered no ex
planation of her queer actions regarding
the money.
From these curious circumstances tha
authorities have deduced that Rev. Mr.
Reed has probably made a "haul" some
where, and that to avoid punishment be
has gone to the asylum ayain.

CARLISLE AND GOLD
They May Get Mixed Up
in the Local Demo
cratic Fight.
THE FEDERAL BRIGADE
Buckleyites Are Whooping Up
Things and Spitting on
the Floor.
ARE AFTER THE LOCAL PLUMS
Some Early Rumors About Ambitions
in the "Decent" Element
of the Junta.
, The Democratic politicians are putting
in the week doing a tremendous amount of
talking and getting ready to proceed next
week with meetings, committees and those
definite things that are teeth in the turn
ing political ratchet-wheel.
, The enmity between the Buckley and
| Junta factions is much more bitter than
,-ever since since last Saturday. The chasm
; is wide and deep, but both sides can shout
bad names across it. All possibility of
compromise seems just now to be gone
j and both sides look away ahead to even
â¢rival municpal tickets on election day.
' The State convention is three months off,
June 16, .so there is plenty, of time for
the primary election for the selection of
delegates to it. The primary will not
likely be held by either faction before the
last of May and enrollment will not begin
until the middle, of May. Meantime each
fide will do its utmost to gather strength
and get its organization in good working
condition.
Boss McNab is qnietly active smoothing
out the district difficulties in the Junta's
general, committee. Tne Rainey people
seem to have already secured all they
â want and to be satisfied. The Forty-fourth
district row. which, before the meeting of
the State Central Committee, was sup
posed to be a hot one, in which Kainey
was to be squelched, has apparently sub
sided with the Rainey element pleased.
"I can't tell what will be done until Mr.
Sullivan appoints that grievance commit
tee. Since Buckley has been beaten we
care little who has the committee." was
the way Rainey's district boss, George
Maxwell, expressed his satisfaction yester
day.
The Federal brigade, Carlisle and gold
promise to cut quite a figure in the local
campaign for the State Convention. Dag
gett and others of the Federal brigade are
understood to be ordered, or at least re
quested, to see that the California Demo
cratic delegation to Chicago is for Carlisle
and "found money."
Daggett's influence will undoubtedly be
thrown strongly in the interest of his ad
ministration masters, and with the assist
ance of Rainey, Welburn and others he
may control the San Francisco delegation
to the State Convention, alone with many -
delegates from other parts of the State.
Of course it is too early for the definite
shaping of things on â¢ Presidential candi
dates and National policy, but there is
already talk among the "Buckleyites of
uniting in opposition to Carlisle, partly as
a local war measure. But then gold and
silver Democrats are scattered through
each faction, regardless of the local split.
Sam Rainey is understood to be a bimetal
list. " BSpSi
' It's just talk up at the Junta headquar
ters in the Flood building. The Junta is
using the rooms of the State Democratic
Club, and so enjoy carpets, pictures and
real nice chairs.
Sam Brannhart threw his leg over a chair
last night, rubbed his head as usual and
made vigorous denial that Rainey controls
the Junta.
Wl can take the general committee by
districts," he declared, "and show that
Rainey does not control over a hundred
votes. The decent people in this organiza
tion will see that he is kept down."
The "decent" people who take an inter
, est in the Junta and the Government have
quite a collection of political aspirations
among them. However they will not al
low Rainey to give them office, of course.
One hears that A. A. Watkins wants to
-be a â¢ delegate to the National convention;
that Alex Vogelsang would like to be
State Senator and. may be, Superior
Judge; that M. C. Hassett still has ambi
tions to grace the bench: thatT. J. Pinder
has a wistful eye on the Recordership, and
so on.
It has long been understood that Chair
man W. P. Sullivan expects at least one of
the Democratic nominations for Sheriff
and . that Gavin McNab would make a
good attorney for some public official.
' Any number of would-be legislators are
fightinz Buckley and Rainey.
The Buckleyites are getting ready for a
tremendous whoop, and they will do every
thing possible, with the aid of Buckley's
masterful advice, to fill up their ranks.
Big red banners stretched across the
front of the new headquarters at 935 Mar
ket street announce, "Regular Democratic
General Committee" and "Registration
Bureau." The boys are all welcome up
there. Daniel H. Gavigan, secretary of
the general committee, has charge after
the Recorder's office closes. There are no
frills . on the . Buckley downtown head
quarters, though they are going to put in
some tin spittoons for style. ' '.
Yesterday - afternoon Dan Gavigan
started downstairs to the hardware-store
below to buy some cuspidors, but he quit
when he learned before getting there that
A. A. Watkins; who beat James H. O'Brien
that time and who tried to adjourn the
committee sine die, had just got the store.
The Buckleyites wouldn't even spit in
cuspidors sold by Watkins.
The old man who came slowly in last
evening smoking rubber bands in a pipe
, was an old backer of . Buckley south of !
Market. _
"Is there a meetin' of â¢ the Twenty
eishth here to-night?" he inquired. "No?
Well some of the boys said so. I've -had
the lumbago in me back, and. nailed to
the bed for three months, and I'm just
gettin' 'round, and I wanted to see the
meetin'." . , * .. Â
Â» "Well come around and spit on the
floor, and bring your friends," said Dan,
with genial Democratic welcome.
- Beginning next week a committee on
the glad hand, which will also look afttr
naturalization, will be kept posted at the
headquarters. ,, â¢ Â/
Nigh* before last a = committee was ap
pointed* to prepare a report of the proceed

doings of Chairman Gould, Gavin McNab
and some others. > The committee consists
of Samuel Newman, T. Spotts, Joseph
Rothschild, Henry Ach T. J. Gallagher
- and D.M. Gavigan. The report and reso
futions: will be read Monday evening at
Odd f Fellows' Halt at the meeting of the
General committee and general rally called,

Sings booming nnd all the , features. df a
campaign ; will be kept going in business
'whatever is ; the outcome of the State
Convention," said Secretary D. M. Gavi
gan iast night, "we will go right ahead
with the municipal campaign as the regu
lar party organization. The local organ
ization has exclusive charge of iocal affairs
and the State Convention has nothing to
do with it.
"If the Junta people put up a municipal
ticket and if they own the election com
mission as they claim to do we will
go into court and establish our nght to
have our ticket put on the ballot as the
regular Democratic ticket. We have 228
affidavits and plenty of other evidence to
prove that the general committee never
adjourned and that we are the regular
organization. Watkins will never go on
the stand and say on his oath that the
committee adjourned sine die.
"The action of the State Central Com
mittee in recognizing the Junta was not so
hard a blow as some people imagine, be
cause we stand just where we stood before.
We took the stand in advance that tne
committee had no jurisdiction, and we an
nounced that we put in an appearance
simply to protest against any action being
taken or to accept any fair offer of com
promise if one was made."
Some of the Bucklevites turned Webster
loose on the Junta yesterday. The
"pollies" have long been wondering what
"Junta" meant any wayâ that is, generally,
not in San Francisco. James H. O'Brien
broke an engagement and Hustled up a
big dictionary.
"I found that the dictionary was right,"
said Jim. "Here she is," and he displayed
again the paper on which he had copied
Noah Webster's "wipe" at McNab, Rainey
and Daggett. What O'Brien had copied
for the Buckley archives was the follow
ing:
A select council or assembly which delibe
rates in secret on any affair of government; a
meeting or collection of men combined for se
cret delibsration and intrigue ior party pur
poses; a faction; a cabal, as a junta of minis
ters.
The puzzling sons of party next appeared,
In dark cabals and mighty juntas met.
Thompsoit.
James McKinley, the Daggettite' mem
ber of the Junta's* general committee and
night guardian of the Mint, dropped one
of the bits of political wisdom that fell
yesterday. The gentle ojd man filled his
pipe again and slowly said: "I have seen
politics, sir, for these more than twenty
years. Men go ud and are good and they
go down and are damned. It's all like the
wind. It blows from the east to day and
to-morrow it blows from the northwest.
And there you are."
, Just nowthe local Democratic breezes
are northeasters. Of course it's possible
that zephyrs from the south may come.
But there is no sign yet that the storm
signals will come down before November.
THEY ELUDED THE LAW
A Young Couple Married at Sea
on the Steamer City of
Sydney.
Guatemala's Statutes Require a Sixty
Day Notice Which Was
Not Given.
The passengers on the^acific Mail Com
pany's steamer City of Sydney witnessed a
genuine sea marriage during the run from
San Jose de Guatemala to Champerico.
At the former port a young couple got
aboard and the purser gave* them the
bridal chamber. As soon as the sieamer
was well out to sea the groom presented
the following letter to Captain Frank
Johnston :
The Parsonage, Protestant ChvrchJ
Guatemala, March 2, 1896. j
Captain Johnston. Commander Pacific Mail
Steamship City of Sydneyâ MY Dear Sir: Allow
me to introduce myself (pastor of the Protest
ant church in this city) for tbe purpose of
commending to your good offices the bearer,
Andrew Jackson Bloom, and his fiancee, Miss
SelinaThlel.
They had made all arrangements for the
celebration of their marriage in our church
(guests invited, banquet prepared and church
decorated) when, at the last moment, it was
discovered that a hitch with the laws of this
country made the performance of the cere
mony impossible.
As General Young, the United Stales Minis
ter, is absent the marriage could not take
place In the legation. In these embarrassing
circumstances their plans have been quite dis
arranged and unless they can arrange the mat
ter otherwise they will be compelled to undergo
the inconvenience and chagrin of dancing at
tendance on the laws of Guatemala for a term
of at least two months.
I have therefore recommended them to take
a short sea voyage on the City of Sydney and
draw upon your kindness and courtesy to
perform the ceremony for them under the
United States flag on the high seas. If you can
make it convenient to do this you will very
greatly oblige two worthy but lovesick young
people and also yours, very truly,
Ed M. Haymaker.
Captain Johnston was in a quandary for
a time, but when the news spread among
the cabin passengers he was forced to give
in and perform the ceremony. Immedi
ately all was bustle on board the steamer.
The chief steward put the cooks to work
and a collation that would do credit to a
first-class notel was soon prepared. The
passengers eot out their best clothes and
there was quite a cabin full of people to
see the young couple made man and wife.
The Sydney did not get away from Guat
emala until 11 o'clock at night and it was
two hours later before the ceremony was
performed. Uhief Engineer Rosseter gave
the bride away and R. C. McGregor, a
student at Stanford, acted as best man.
while Miss Mary Shevlin of this City was
the only bridesmaid. The Sydney arrived
at Champerico the next day and Mr. and
Mrs. Bloom went ashore to await the
arrival of the next southbound steamer.
Captain Johnston says that in the circum
stances he could not very well refuse to
perform the ceremony. Tne young couple
were to have beeu married the day
the steamer sailed and it was a bitter
disappointment to them when they found
that the laws of the land were against
them. In Guatemala a foreigner must
give sixty days' notice to the authorities of
his intention to wed, and this Bloom failed
to do. The groom is an artist, well known
in Central America, and the bride was a
music-teacher. Captain Johnston says
they made a handsome couple.
The passengers who arrived on the City
of Sydney were:
W. N. Wells, Dr. J. J.Clark, Mrs. de Halla. C.
J. Pierson, C. H. Sanders, Mrs. J. Schneider,
Mrs. N. Berkel, M. Gonialdi, J. 8. Klee, Dr. J. E.
Whittmore, E. Quinn, Mrs. W. W. Well*, K. U.
Stark. H. Price, John E. Johnson, J. C. Schnei
der, \V. M. Hersy, Angel Nonetti, Fannie Clark.
A. Martinez, Hal Noble, Dr. Frank Griffiths, C.
H. GUbert, John Aldrich, J. G. Osborne, Mngil
Gonzales, Mrs. M. Kilburu, Mrs. Monetti, Mrs.
Martinez, Charles Redecker, R. Withers, Mrs.
Frank Griffith*. R. C. McGregor, Henry Westen,
J. Schneider, E. Aginlar, C. Kilburn, Mary
Shevlin, Mrs. E. H. Burrows, Mrs. Tabor.
C. H. Gilbert is professor of zoology in
Stanford University, and in company with
R. C. McGregor, C. J. Pierson and E. C.
Stark, students at the university, visited
Panama and the Central American States
in search of specimens. They were very
successful, and have returned with a great
number of very rare reptiles, insects and
birds, which will be mounted at the uni
versity.
Dr. James P. Clark is a veil-known
physician of Washington, D. C, and
Miguel Gonzales is one of the lar est cof
fee planters in Guatemala, and A. Martinez
and his bride are on their Wedding tour.
They were married in Guatemala the day
before tne steamer sailed, and in that re
spect were more lucky than Mr. and Mrs.
Bloom.
The passengers on the City of Sydney
know very little about the Nicaraguan war.
The rebels have possession of Corinto,
and it is closed to shipping. In con
sequence the steamer could not call there.
Ezeta was at Panama when the steamer
left, and he was completely stranded. His
credit was gone, and he was looking in
vain for the wherewithal to keep up ap
pearances. The tug Barciay Golden, which
sailed with the Ezeta expedition, was at
Acapulco when the City of Sydney ar
rived, and was expected to sail for San
Francisco the next day.

RACING AT THE BAT DISTRICT
The Favorites Fared BadlyâStrath
flower Easily Defeated the Warm
Choice Flashlight.
The weather was threatening and the
California Jockey Club had only a fair at
tendance for its reopening day at the Bay
District track. The card was a lengthy
one, there being seven events down for de
cision. The Gunst selling stakes over a
mile and a sixteenth, worth f 1500 to the
first horss, was the special feature of the
day's sport. There were but six starters,
with Wheel of Fortune carrying but 99
pounds opening an even-money favorite
in the betting. Rosebud was an 8 to 5
second choice in the opening betting, but
receded until 2>Â£ and 3 was obtainable.
The supporters of Service argued that the

track, which was heavy, was all in his
favor, and from d] 4 his price was gradu
ally rubbed to 11 to 5. This latter heavy
play had the effect of causing the odds
against the "Wheel" to ro back in the
books to 3to 2. The race proved a most
one-sided affair. When the barrier was
lifted Shields on Service made play for
the lead, which he secured, and the old
horse led the field a merry chase, winning
in romping fashion by four lengths in
I:49}^. Rosebud got the place, a couple
of lengths before the hard-ridden favorite.
Fortuna, Dungarven and Monita cut but
little figure in the running.
It was a stormy day for favorites, and
the handicappers and form-players were
all in bad form. The only winning favor
ites were Sea Spray and the pdds-on Lo
bengula.
Fourteen cheap selling-platers were the
first to go to the post in a five-furlong
scramble. Zoolein has apparently sadly
deteriorated as a sprinter, for, ruling an 8
to 5 choice, he finished third. Faro, als
to 1 shot, and Middleton fought it out, the
former winning easily at the finish by four
lengths.
Third place was the best the favorite,
Early Notice, could finish in the two-year
old dash at four furlongs. The filly opened
at 6 t0. 5, receding to 2to 1. Torpedo, a 4
to 1 chance, made all of the running, win
ning by a length from Gordon.
The fourth race, at seven and a half fur
longs, was decided over the inside course.
Sea Spray, ridden by Bob Isom. played
down from sixes to 11 to 5, was in front
from the jump, and in a hard drive
through the stretch with Ike L passed the
wire half a length to the good. Favory
came fast at the end, finishing a good third.
The crowd again got aboard the wrong
horse in the next event, a six-furlong
spin. Strathflower opened an 8 to |5
choice, but reports were spread of her p lor
condition and. she went back in the bet
ting to 3 to 1, and Flashlight was played
down from 11 to 5 to 11 to 10 ana even
money. Strathflower had the lead on the
hot favorite from the start and beat him
out easiJy by a length. Charlea A, the
second choice, was a poor third.
Green Morris scooped in another prcse
in the race following with Lobeneula. The
bay horse was an-odds-on choice, the books
holding him at 3 to 10 and he ran away
from Collins, the contending horse, win
ning eased up in 1:44.
The last race of the day was a second
edition of the opening scramble for the
selling-platers. Robin Hood, a 30 to lshot,
was quickest away at the start and won
easily with Crawiord in the place.
Track and Faddook Items.
The mile and a quarter selling eveut on
to-day's programme did not nil and a
shorter race will be substituted instead.
The McLaughlin stakes at two and a
quarter miles is the feature of to-morrow's
card. All of the "stayers" are entered and
the winner will draw down $2500.
Torpedo, the chestnut youngster who
won the two-year-old dash, is a son of the
speedy Racine. Given a fair opportunity
and the son of game old Bishop may yet
prove a gem in the stud.
A few bettors got as good as 40 to 1
against Robin Hood 11.
Contribution had a leg as big as a stove
pipe, that he could hardly rest on the
ground, at the conclusion of the race.
It is an injustice to the betting public, as
well as an act of inhumanity, to start ani
mals of this class, and more than anything
else caused all the hue and cry against
long winter race meetings.
The starting gate owned by Joe Harvey
was given a trial on the inside track'at the
conclusion of the last race, but did not
score a signal success. It differs from the
Australian invention inasmuch that in
stead of using strips of cotton webbing for
the barrier, two wooden spars are used
that work on the principle of a gate,
swinging to either side at the touch of a
lever. When the lever was pressed the
spar on the right side failed to fly back
and was jumped on by one of the horses,
causing a compound fracture that almost,
caused the toiling inventor to weep.
TO BE DECIDED TO-DAY.
San Francisco's Pesthouse May Be Lo
cated Near Quarantine on Angel
Island.
Mayor Sutro received information from
Washington yesterday that the Secretary
of War is about to take action on the ap
plication of the local authorities to have
the Pesthouse located on Angel Island
where the United States quarantine sta
tion is now situated.
"When the subject was first broached,
after the citizens had protested against the
hospital being located within the City and
County, Congressman ; Maguire took the
matter up and after. seeing Surgeon-Gen
eral Wymari of tne United Statet Quaran
tine Service telegraphed that the Secretary
of War might grant the necessary permis
sion to erect ; the Pesthouse on Govern
ment ground. ..' â¢;â -. 'i'/:,l'<
When General Forsy th . heard of the
matter, however, he protested that he did
not care to have his soldiers placed in
jeopardy, and so stated to Mayor Sutro
when the two officials held a personal in
terview:^"' â¢'â'â ;-â ''-â¢; .;:â¢-., â¢:',
â¢ The proposition has not been given up,
however, and every effort is being. made to
induce the Secretary of War to grant the
permit, in ; spite : of ; General Forsyth's ob
jections. , 'â ;."' ''â '.'.

Railway extension in Burmah is carried
on under exceptional difficulties. Tunnel
ing and rock-cutting work on the last sec

the high price and scarcity of food sup*

FRIDAY MARCH 20, 1896
, THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
It is to be a campaign for a sound tariff,
sound money and a sound party.
The great strike for higher wages will
occur on election day and hit the Demo
cratic party.
The Junta was content at first to call it a
walkover, but has now about concluded to
make it a razzle-dazzle.
During all the European controversies of
the year the Czar has been silent and yet
nobody has called him a clam.
It is now clear the movement for a revo
lution infNicaragua was only an oscilla
tion. It has begun to swing backward.
When Congress takes up the Nicaragua
canal bill it will have on its hands a good
thing and the people will begin to sing
"Push it along."
The only thing that gives vitality to the
talk of renominating Cleveland is the de
sire of bo many Democrats to have another
lick at him.
Dan Lamont is the only member of the
present Cabinet who has not been caught
ignoring the law and trying to boss things
like a dictator.
Santa Cruz has captured a man who
posed as a doctor and practiced chicken
stealing. What kind of a 'pathy" does
the profession call that?
In marching an expedition up the Nile
the British may have a secret hope that
they can relieve Italy by relieving her of
her African possessions.
While the censure of Bayard was post
poned a long time Republican sentiment
has not cooled off during the wait. It is
going to be a genuine roast.
It is reported the conflicting interests in
the railroad camp have about reached an
agreement and we may now look out for
lively work on the rush line.
If his present feelings continue until the
meeting of the Chicago Convention, Gavin
McNab will see to it that Democracy is not
without a Presidential candidate.
As it is certain the painters' strike is to
end sooner or later, it would seem there
ought to be saeacity enough on both sides
to find a way of ending it at once.
Sending money to the Armenians is
only an indirect way of sending it to the
Turk?. Tbe best way to help the sufferers
would be to send an ultimatum to the
Sultan.
If the report be true that 15,000 Chris
tians have risen at Beyrout and warned
the Moslems to defend themselves the
Turkish sick man may be about to get his
right medicine at last.
General Hubbard's plan of settling the
Pacific roads debt by funding it for fifty
years at 2 per cent may have some im
provements on the Huntington plan, but
they are not visible tp the public
As it is announced that General Garcia,

THE CEISIS AT HAND.
According to tlie latest reports from
Washington tne managers of the various
interests involved in the. Union and the
Central Pacific roads have about reached
an agreement as to the terms on which
they wish the debts to the Government
funded. This means, of course, that the
critical. moment of the contest is at hand.
At any day a bill approved by the railroad
lobby may be adopted by the Pacific Roads
Committee, reported to the House and
pressed for immediate passage by all the
forces which the combined roads can mus
ter at Washington.
While the exact form the agreement be
tween the various railroad managers will
take is not certain, enough is known to
justify the conclusion that it will not be
widely different from the plan which Mr.
Huntington has favored all along. It may
not fund the debt for a century with in
terest at 1 per cent for ten years and 2 per
cent for the remaining ninety, as that job
is too big for even a railroad lobby to un
dertake. It is sure, however, to grant to
the defaulting roads such terms as will en
able Mr. Huntington and his colleagues to
evade their debts and continue their mo
nopoly for more than the lifetime of this
generation.
It is fortunate in this crisis that the op
ponents of the monopoly have been care
ful to ask no more than the honest en
forcement of the law against the railroads
exactly as it would be enforced against the
humblest citizen who owed money to the
Government, if there were now a scatter
ing right, or any difference of aim or an
tagonism of purpose among the defenders
of the cause of the Pacific Coast, the vic
tory of the monopoly would be assured.
The great battle can be won only by the
exercise of the strength that results from
unity and harmony. We can draw
auguries of victory from the fact that the
California delegation is virtually solid in
opposition to refunding, and that the
strong men in it are fighting vigorously
for the people.
The struggle has now been so long pro
tracted that a fairly comprehensive cam
paign of education at Washington has
been carried out by the advocates of law
and public welfare against the agents of
the boodle scheme and the supporters of
monopoly. The contest, we have every
reason to believe, is almost won. If the
scheme can be beaten at this session of
Congress it will be easier still to beat it at
the next., and the end of the long-exacdng
monopoly will be at hand.
THE NEW CANAL BILL.
The telegraphic report of the bill pre
pared by the sub-committee on the Nica
ragua canal of the House Commerce Com
mittee gives very meager particulars, but
they seem to apply admirably to the situ
ation. The measure has first to receive
the approval of the full committee before
submission to the House, ana it may re
ceive important changes. In its present
form it is evidently the product of very
careful study and undoubtedly was drawn
to avoid the evil consequences which have
arisen from Government aid of railroads,
while at the same time it secures control
ofthe canal by the United States, and yet
avoids the proposition of Government
ownership.
It provides for the reorganization of the
Maritime Canal Company and authorizes
it to issue $100,000,000 in bonds, of which
$7,000,000 shall be held, by the company to
reimburse it for its expenditures already
made. The Government guarantees the
bonds and protects itself by an issue of
$100,000,000 in shares, to be held in the Na
tional treasury, and erects additional se
curity by requiring a first mortgage, by
appointing ten of the fifteen directors and
by requiring that the net earnings of the
canal shall be placed in a sinking fund for
the extinguishment of the bonds. These
are to bear interest at 3 per cent. The
length of time they are to run is not men
tioned in the telegram.
The scheme for the protection of the
Government seems ample, and at the same
time the company and the governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica have representa
tion throueh the five directors allotted to
them. As we are to have ten directors the
political as well as the commercial inter
ests of this country will be completely
guarded, as well as those of Nicaragua and
L'osta Rica. No such scandals arising
from construction as were disclosed in the
operations of the Credit Mobilier and the
Contract and Finance Company will be
possible, as the bill provides that the canal
shall be constructed under the supervision
of the War Department.
It is curious to note the effect which the
fight over the railroad funding bill must
have had in the framing of this bill.
Every one of its provisions aimed to secure
the financial interests of the Government
and the commercial interests of the coun
try seems to have been the direct product
of the wisdom acquired from the errors
committed in subsidizing the overland
roads. Whatever may be the fate of this
bill it is consoling to reflect that the fund
ing bill struggle has had an educating ef
fect of so conspicuous value.
VANDEEBILT COMING.
Although Cornelius Vanderbilt and
Chauncey M. Depew announce that their
visit to California will be for pleasure only,
it is not forgotten that this ia an unusual
time of the year for private-car pleasure
trips to-California, tbat as a member of the
reorganization committee of the Union
Pacific it is difficult to see how Mr. Depew
can be spared at present unless for some
urgent reason, that the prosperity of the
Union Pacific is an important considera
tion for the Chicago and Northwestern
road, that the traffic of the Union Pacific
and consequently of the Chicago and
Northwestern has been seriously injured
by the diversion of traffic from the Central
Pacific to the Sunset route of the South-
em Pacific, and that ther e is current be
lief in Washington that the. Vanderbiit
and Gould interests Btand ready to bid on
the Union and Central Pacific if the Gov
ernment offers them for sale in foreclosure
of its mortgage against them. These form
an interesting series of coincidences.
It seems quite likely that the railroad
situation in the West has recently come to
be better understood in the East than
formerly and that the possibilities for de
velopment in tbis region might have be
come alluring to railroad owners who
understand the science of using railroads
for that purpose and hence for prospective
rather than present gain. Mr. Depew in
genuously declares that as a member of
the reorganization committee of the Union
Pacific he wants to see that it is in a posi
tion to compete fairly with the other trans
continental lines, and it is difficult to see
how fair competition can exist under the
diversion plan of the Southern Pacific.
His remarks about there being already
more o/erland lines than can prosper with
the volume of traffic which they have
have to be read in the light of his interest
in the Union Pacific and Mr. Vanderbilt's
interest in the Chicago and Northwestern,
not to mention a perfectly natural disin
clination under the circumstances to set
too high a value on the aided roads.
Whatever may be the pleasure which
these gentlemen may extract from a pri

OUB HAEBOB DANGEBS.
The Bub-committee of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce which bad charge
of an investigation of the dangers repre
sented by the hidden rocKs of the harbor
has made a report filling a pamphlet, but
the soul of it all lies in this paragraph:
"The reason for this helplessness of pilots
to save vessels from these treacherous
rocks is found in the peculiarly thick fogs
which beset the entrance to this harbor,
and the peculiarly uncertain but strong
currents which continually sweep through
the bay and its approaches." That is to
say, it is not a Simple question of hidden
rocks, which careful navigation might
avoid, but one of concurrent conditions
which make the rocks dangerous.
Invariably the first sign of a fog occurs
in the channel connecting the bay with
the ocean. The foghorns are often blow
ing while the sun shines in San Francisco.
These fogs hug the water and are all the
more dangerous for that reason. As the
channel is very narrow for the immense
volume of water that the tides urge
through it, and as its sides are so irregu
lar aa to make innumerable bewildering
eddies and cross currente, the flow is swift
and exceedingly complicated. For hardly
any two successive days is it alike, as
the varying winds which sweep up the
channel introduce an element of uncer
tainty and render an exact knowledge of
the currents impossible.
In avoiding the sunken rocks in thick
weather the vessels incoming and outgoing
necessarily crowd as much as possible into
the center of the channel. In the absence
of rocks there would be greater freedom.
To be within a mile of one of these con
cealed dangers is to run the risk of a wreck.
This explains the numerous collisions
which occur. Hence the rocks are indi
rectly as well as directly dangerous. The
danger is multiplied by the fogs and tidal
currents. The fact that nearly all the
wrecks which have occurred resulted from
a combination of these conditions should
afford a sufficient reason for the prompt
removal of the rocks.
The local weather-office recently sub
mitted, or announced that, it was prepared
to submit, to the Washington authorities
a plan for foretelling fogs. It should not
be a difficult meteorological problem and
its adoption would be of great service to
local navigation. It often happens that a
fog appears suddenly and entraps a vessel
in the channel, and that the pilot might
have waited if he had known beforehand
that a fog was expected. But this sugges
tion-should not make us lose sight of the
main fact that were it not for the hidden
rocks the fog would not be so dangerous and
that the removal of them would reduce the
need of fog predictions.
HUKfiYING THE EOAD.
The announcement made by Chief En
gineer Story that the Valley road will
reach Fresno in August, and thus be ready
to handle its share of this year's crop,
presents tbe prospect of immediate earn
ings this year. This is a very uncommon
state of affairs in railroad building. It
means that a road built through a settled
region will not have to wait for business,
but will at once enjoy benefits which are
usually slow in accruing. Besides this
fact in its favor it has tbe additional one
of being a welcome competing; line offer
ing inducements which have never been
hitherto extended, and enjc., ing the sym
pathy and confidence of the people. It
has already constructed thirty-five miles
of track and has three locomotives of the
most improved pattern and 150 freight
cars. These undoubtedly will be found
inadequate for the heavy traffic which it
will be called upon to handle, but the
stockholders will cheerfully pay assess
ments which promise returns so imme
diate and profitable.
It will be a great day for the San Joa
quin Valley when this road enters Fresno,
and doubtless it will be the occasion of
one of the most enthusiastic celebrations
ever held in California. Many growers
will probably hold their crops for the new
road. The settlement of the valley will
proceed rapidly and the earnings of the
road constantly increase. The pleasure of
contemplating these prospects is enhanced
by the news that a strong movement is on
foot to break the Pacific Mail and Panama
Railway monopoly by putting on a line of
steamers to be operated in connection with
tbe Tehuantepec Railway.
NEW CUBAN STAMPS.
The first issue of Cuban stamps was made in
New York City last week and were eagerly
purchased by collectors. The stamp shown in
the cut is twice the actual size, the original
being a trifle longer than our two-cent sump.
They were printed by the New York Bank
Note Company, in denominations of 2, 5, 10
and 25 cents. AH are of the same design, but
differ in color.
The design is a shield with a rising sun occu
pying the upper half, a palm tree in the lower
right corner, and bars intended to represent
the blue and white bars in the Cuban flag in
the lower left corner. The key, with the land
scape depicted in the stamp, make up, with
tli- other features, the escutcheon of the Cu
ban revolutionist party. Two-cent stamps are
brown, 5-cent blue, 10-cent orange and 25
--cent green. The Cuban cent is equal in value
to our cent.
In case the Spanish power is overthrown in
the island the stamps will be adopted as the
national stamp. They are now of no practical
service excepting in certain parts of Cuba
where the revolutionists are in power, and
where they maintain a mail service of their
Prosperity in Sugar Beet Culture.
Cbiuo Champion.
Ten new sugar factories in California would
mean more for the prosperity of the agri
cultural interests of the State than any other
industry we have. And this prosperity would
not be confined to the agriculturists, but
would permeate every branch of business and
trade in the State. Every Californian should
lend his influence, his voice and his vote to se
cure the permanent and widespread benefits of
any and every encouragement to the beet-su
gar industry.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
John McDonough, a pioneer of Cascade Locks
on the Columbia Eiver, where the United
States Government Is cutting ft wonderful
canal through the rocks, is at the Lick.
Cascades, or Cascade Locks, as it is also
known, is the place on the great river of the
West known to the traveler Captain Bonne
ville and the intrepid men wno followed
him, by the Indian name of Wishram.
It was at this place that the hordes of Indians
on that part of the frontier swarmed and ex
acted tribute in the form of tolls for allowing
travelers to pass. There was no escaping the
Indians at this place and they used the advan
tage for all it was worth.
Every reader of Washington Irving's story of
the exploits of the brave Bonneville will
remember "the fearful rapids at that
place. It was to make a way through
the long stretch of rocks for steam
boats and thus extend navigation up the
mighty Columbia that the Government began
work a good many years ago. Diflerent con
tracts were given and large sums were ex
pended, but the work reauired to be done was of
John McDonough of Cascades.
such a herculean character that in all the
years it has not been finished. However, the
situation is different now. Daylight is be
ginning to dawn.
"We begin to see the end of the lonz battle
against the rocks," said Mr. McDonough last
evening. "The last contract was given by the
Government to J. G. and I. N. Day of San
Francisco for $1,600,000, the canal to be com
pleted in three and a half years. Tne work is
pretty well on now.
"The open way in the rocks, which is known
as the Cascades ship canal, is ninety feet wide
and three-quarters of a mile long. It has enor
mous steel gates in it, run by hydraulic power,
and transcending in size and cost anything be
fore known in the world.
"Eacti great gate is ninety-seven feet high
and ninety-two feet wide and cost $80,000.
Even in Europe, so long inhabited and with so
many canals, there is nothing like them. As
soon as this canal is completed steamers can
go up the Columbia as far as The Dalles.
"When the Celilo Rapids, three miles above
The Dalles, are improved, the preat river will
be open to Lswiston, Idaho, 1300 miles above
Astoria, which is at the mouth. AH the grain,
wool and other products of the Palouse and
other adjoining counties may then be
brought down the river on steamers.
"This means a great deal for people who live
in the valley ot the Columbia and contiguous
to it. Besides this Eddy, Hammond & Co. are
now pushing the construction of their rail
road and have 500 men at work grading the
first ten miles of it from Astoria. The town
aforesaid the night before I left voted terminal
facilities for the road, which is to run from
that city to Portland. It begins to look bright
in that part of the country."
Mr. McDonough is here for the treatment of
his eyes, which have been weak for some time.
He raised the famous horse Tim Murphy who
has made such important winnings on the
tracks here. Mr. McDonough has had more or
less to do with horse and cattle growing ever
since he settled in that great livestock region.
He will be here several weeks.
George W. Fitch, who is connected with the
business department of the New York
cartoon weekly, Puck, is at the Grand.
Mr. Fitch was formerly a writer on
Puck. Later he had charge of the paper's ex
hibit at the Chicago Exposition. He is here
for a brief stay and will soon leave for South
ern California.
"I think the greatest cartoonist in the world,
now," he said, "is probably W. A. Rogers of
Frank Leslie's. Since the death of Joseph Kep
plerof Puck and of Mr. Gillam of Judge I don't
think there is anybody equal to him. He was
formerly oa Puck, and I don't suppose our peo
ple would have consented to part with him
had it been foreseen that Mr. Keppler would
die.
"I have been surprised to see what an inter
est California takes in comic papers, such as
ours. San Francisco is a big city, with big
broad-gauge ideas, and don't much care one
way or the other what anybody may think of
her. And that's the reason I like it."

ing suggestive parody appeared in a recent

LADY'S WAIST WITH YOKE FRONT
A delightfully simple waist, suitable for the
plainest of gowns, and yet a good foundation
for elaboration in the. shape oi fancy waists is
shown here.
It is made with a fitted lining which buttons
in the front. The lull front also hooks invisi
bly in front, the yoke fastening on the left
shoulder and armsize. The back is seamless
â on a tight lining, with tine gathers at the
waist line.
As illustrated, it is of blue serge, with trim
mings of black and gilt braid and gilt buckles.
A brown mohair gown had a yoke of embroid-
ered batiste over pink silk, bright Dresden rib-
Don furnished the belt and collar and finished
the edge of the yoke.
A silk waist of half-inch stripes of black and
pale-green had the yoke cut crosswise, the
stripes running up and down for the blouse.
A pleated ruffle of black chiffon, three inches
wide, depended from the yoke.
Wash dresses made after this model are
sometimes un lined, except the top of the
blouse, depending from a yoke of lininsr which
fastens in the center front, or the blouse is
sewn to the yoke itself and tuttons under the
arm.
A waist of embroidered batiste was made
over a green silk lining. Blue ribbons made it
a very striking looking garment.

although not In his presence; when v felony has in
fact been committed, and he has reasonable cause
for believing the person arrested to b:ive commit
ted it.
In making an arrest a private person as well
as an officer must inform the party of his in
tention to arrest him and the offense for which
he proposes to arrest him, unless he is in the
actual commission of a crime or is escaping
after its commission. If the arresting party

corners, and still be called a flag, but a piece
of clotH fastened across a street and having

banner as applied to flag is not improper, as

ment printed upon it or attached to it is a
aesecration of the Hag, it makes no difference

other material.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
FRENCH FRIGATE SHOALS.
Something About These Lonely Islets in th^
Pacific.
. To the Editor, of the Spn Francisco Callâ
On reading in The Call the narrowing details,
of suffering and privations of the 'wrecked^
crew of the Mattie T. Dyer on French Frigate
Shoals, I thought it would not be amiss atthia
time to give future navigators in those dan.,
gerous waters some ideas regarding this reel;
and group of islets. Having made several voyÂ«!
ages there, surveying the - group, Inspecting
the guano deposits, etc., I feel competent to re..
port fuller information that is usually found
either in Bowdltch or the charts. â  : 7/
â  â  These islands are about twenty-seven miletw
farther west than the old i charts - place them/
and have been the scene of some twelve or fif
teen wrecks. The reef and shoal are crescent*
formed, open to the southwest, inside of whicfc
there â  is . a lagoon of still water and good an.
chorage, as they are located in the northeast
trade winds. The outside reef is steep, too, ris
ing abruptly from the deep sea. The breaker*
dash heavily on this outside barrier and either
in the night or day, with a good lookout, cart
be seen four miles away. Two or three " miles
inside of this line or breakers and also form-.
ing a crescent are sixteen islets. Near the con*
ter of the whole inclosure to thersouth stands;
an isolated rocky islet, about 150 feet high)
and somewhat resembling a ship â  under full!
sail. â â¢â ,.--â .â â . :. vV-, {*
I left some twenty-five Hawaiian natives one>.
summer on these islands, where I erected a
cabin, dug a well ten feet deep and set a whal
er's trypot. The following winter I returned
and found the natives faf and lazy. In the
meantime they had captured about- 1000 hair
seals, 300 pounds of seal oil, a quantity of
sharks-liver oil and sharks' fins, which at that
time brought 25 cents per pound among the
Chinese, together with a good lot of wreckage
from the unfortunate vessels lost there.
The waters abound with excellent fish of
many varieties. The food supply is on an inÂ«
exhaustible scale,' green turtle, wild fowl and
their eggs being found without limit. â  ;
'â :';. If the wrecked mariners had . tai-en a little
more time in looking around they would have
found it a very cheap boarding-place during
these times of depression. Probably the Gov
ernment would have sent the Charleston for
them in time for the next election.

NO CHARTERS IN SIGHT
A Fleet of Twenty-five Vessels
Waiting for Something
to Do.
SIX NOW LYING AT SAUSALITO.
While Living in Expectation the Cap
tains Are Having the Ships
Overhauled.
When the people of Sausalito awake in
the morning nowadays they think for a
THE SIX BRITISH SHIPS THAT CANNOT SECURE CHARTERS AND HAVE GONE TO SAUSALIIO FOR THE SUMMER.
[Sketched by a "Call" staff artist.]
few moments that a boiler-making es
tablishment has been started in the town.
It is hammer, hammer, hammer, from
morning till night, and the noise is at
times exasperating. It all comes from six
British ships that are lying in the safe
anchorage off the township. There is no
prospect of an advance in freight rates, so
the vessels will remain at anchor until the
times improve.
In the meantime, bowever, the captains
are improving the shining hours, and all
hands are sent over the sides each morning
to chip off the rust. The vessels are all
light, and in consequence nearly their
whole sides are exposed. When the work
of chipping is completed the ships will be
painted, and thus hundreds of dollars will
be saved to the owners when an English
port is reached.
There are now twenty-five ships in port
waiting for something to turn up in the
shape of a charter. Of these six are now
lying at Sau*alito, and some of them have
been in port three months. The Craigend,
Captain Lewthwaite, arrived January 20;
the Eden-Valleymore, Captain May, on
February 1; the Hyderabad, Captain Scott,
on January 21; "the Kilmeny, Captain
Jones, on January 29; The Hahnemann,
Captain Newson, on January 8, and the
Wynnstay, Captain McÃryde, on January
15. The skippers all expect to spend the
summer at least in Sausalito, and some of
them may remain until next season.
The tonnage at present in port is just
about what it was at this time last year.
There were twenty-five ships representing
45,887 tons disengaged yesterday, while
last year it was 47.756 tons. This year there
is 44,618 tons engaged and last year it was
50,120.
The disengaged list was added to by the
arrival of the Beechbank yesterday. She
had a very rough passage from Hamburg,
and on January 22 a sea broke aboard that
did considerable damage. The wheel and
wheel-box, the port and starboard light
houses were smashed and the bow ports
were driven in. Temporary repairs were
made and all went well until January 30,
when a serious accident happened. The
ship was rolling heavily and Frederick
Slotton, an apprentice, fell from the fore
royal-yard and was instantly killed. This
was to have been, his last trip as an appren
tice, as he expected to pass his examina
tion on his return and take a position as
third officer.
The accompanying illustration shows
the six British ships that cannot get a
charter tied up off Sausalito. Every nieht
they are visited by one or more parties
from the shore, so "life is not dull or mo
notonous aboard.
MONEY FOR THE SCHOOLS
California Gets Five Per Cent From
Cash Sales of Public
' Land.
The State of California is to receive from
the sale of public lands within its borders
5 per cent of the net proceeds, and this
amount is to be devoted to public school
purposes.
By this arrangement the United States
Government will annually turn over to
the Treasurer of California one twentieth of
the money received from sales of public
land throughout the State. The Treasurer,
in turn, will place the money at the dis
posal of the Department of Public Instruc
tion, which will apply it to school pur-
poses.
The Senate bill providing for this little
windfall became a law Wednesday in
Washington, and from that date hence
forth until all public lands in California,
sold for cash, are disposed of, the State
will get 5 per cent of tne money received
by the Government.
Will S. Green, United States Land Sur
veyor General, stated yesterday that in
his opinion the 5 per cent income would
not amount to much in compaiison with
the State's yearly expenditures for school
purposes.
lie believed, however, that if certain
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
irrigation schemes for the Salton basin
were carried into execution the cash sales
of public lands would be vastly increased,
and then California would get a consider
able sum for her schools.
The cash sales for the year 1895 amounted
to 181.267 52.
California's share of this amount would
be a little over $4000. As the total is ex
pected to be double as much for 1896 the
State's 5 per cent may be about $10,000 to
be added to the school fund.
AMATEUR ATHLETICS.
A First-Class Entertainment Given by
the San Francisco Athletic
Club.
The San Francisco Athletic Club gave a
first-class entertainment on Wednesday
evening at its clubrooms on Sixth street.

AMERICAN SOCIALISTS.
They Are at Work Forming a
Public Ownership Politi
cal Party.
A Declaration of Principles Setting
Forth the Aims and Objects
of the Movement.
The Society of American Socialists
has practically entered the field of
politics and is carrying on inter
esting educational meetings in Kohler
& Chase Hall at 26 O'Farrell street.
This evening Susan B. Anthony and Mrs.
A. A. Sargent will discourse upon the sub
ject of woman's suffrage. These and other
socialist workers are endeavoring to unite
and bring to the front the better element
of all other political parties and unite
them in a political party called the Public
Ownership or Socialist party. In their ap
peal for the attention of the general pubiic
the socialist leaders have put forth the
following declaration of principles of the
projected party :
The one object of socialism is justice. Its
central thought is public ownership. Its
method is orderly agitation. It is antagonistic
to violence. It is the diametrical opposite of
militant anarchism. The explosives iv which
it trusts are education and ballot.
Socialism is liberal. It does not countenance
intolerance. It has no iron-clad creed. It
scorns the bigotry of orthodoxy. It expects to
learn and grow. Its tactics are broad and
generous. It welcomes those who are going in
its direction. The last thing it thinks of is
abusing them. It repudiates bosses, directors
and dictators. Military party organization is
repul.-ive to its spirit in America. That may
do In some foreign countries, but not here. It
does not take its cue from headquarters, but
gives the cue to headquarters, it is entirely
modern. It studies to be intelligent, fresh and
alert every day. it is inventive and continu
ally active in new ways. It will not bind it
self to auy rule or routine. Whatever has not
these qualities is not socialism, although it
may wear that name.
Socialism does not divide class from class, but
unites them. It believes iv reaching all classes
and enlightening all. It sees the struggle
guing on in every mind over the fear-inspiring
social problems. It notes men and women
groping for light, and it carries them light.
It imparts to them an understanding of the
principle ol public property, of public co-oper
ation, of public consolidation, of public indus
trial action, as antidotes for private ownership
mad And competition drunk. It will mend the
delirium tremens of monopoly by giving the
monopolies to the people. It will make the
public the capitalist.
Socialism believes in a coming political
party called the Public Ownership, or the So
cialist party. All parties and all forward
movements now in the field are preparations
for it. Trades unions,' the Populists, the So
cialist Labor party, the Prohibitionists, the
adherents of single tax, independent la-fcor
movements, municipal reformers, woman suf
fragists, the honest men of intellect in the Re
publican and Democratic Gieat Easterns, are
making ready for a new political division.
Robbers and reactionists will be on one side;
modern men, honest men and reformers on
the other. They will cleave on the question of
obliterating wagedom and inaugurating pub
licly owned industry. To politicians who wear
diinnonds, this is unpractical. To such poli
ticians the freeing of slaves was unpracticalâ
to be completed, if ever, 300 years from the
year 1865.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Japanese Men-of-War Will Not
Be Built in the United
States.
SCHOONER J. B. LEEDS MISSING.
Inward and Outward China Steamers
Carry More Ballast Than
Cargo.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Peru arrived from Hongkong, via Yoko-
batna, yesterday. She only brought three
cabin .passengersâ D. O. Callaghan," A. ' S. r
MacKenzie and ;L. R. S. Squireâ while in
the steerage there were only eight Jap
anese and twenty Chinese.
The most important fact brought by the
mail boat is that there is not the slightest
chance of any of the new warships; for the
Japanese navy being built in the United
States. The general expression of opinion
was that General Williams, who went over
to represent the Cramps, might just as
well have stayed at home.
The gunboat Bennington made an ex
hibition 1 'of herself vwhÂ«n in "Japanese
waters and had to be repaired on several
occasions. " The Olympia and the steamer
Empress of India left Kobe together for
Yokohama, and the mail steamer < easily
beat the 21-knot cruiser. The Charleston
is now in Yokohama with a broken piston
rod. â  This is the second occasion on which
she has been laid up for repairs in Japanese
waters inside of ten months, and taking
air these facts ; into consideration the
Mikado's advisers will not recommend the
expenditure of any of the money received
from the Chinese in the United States.
When Irving M. Scott of the Union Iron
Works went to Yokohama he met with a
very cool reception and failed to accom
plish anything. The ; passengers son the
Peru say that General Williams will also
fail. It is to be hoped that he will not.
Mr. O'Callaghan, who has been on a tour
of the world, is a* San Francisco boy. : He
is well known in yachting and; athletic
circles and is a general favorite : among
shipping Â» men. ly From : San Francisco he
went to Canada, England, Ireland, Scot
land, France, Belgium and Germany. / In
Bremerhaven he was taking a photograph'
of : some â of the # scenes,' when : the soldiers
bore down on him and he was arrested on
a charge V of â â  photographing ;' the"fortifica- :
tions. He was in jail fifteen hours before
the United States Consul could secure his
release. â¢â¢'-;
From Germany Mr. O'CaUaghan went to
Austria, Italy aud Monte Carlo. : At the
latter place he \ failed *to < break the bank,
but had a most enjoyable visit. His next
point was Egypt, and alter an excursion
on the Nile he made tracks for Jerusalem.
All the points of interest were visited, and
of course he went for a sail on < the f - Sea of
Galilee. He tried his hand at fishing, but
it proved a failure, s From Palestine, India,
Singapore ': and : Hongkong were . visited,
and then he came home via Yokohama.
"I have traveled the world over," said Mr.
O'Callaghan ; yesterday, "and - I can T say
with a clear conscience; there is no place
like California. I For the last week I have
done nothing but "Home Again." :

session yesterday. 5 TheÃisdon Iron 4 Works

There was 2 a:; peculiar 4 accident l at the
Sausalito ferry, yesterday. â  P. H. Dawson
a|drummer for Heyneman & Co., 33 Bat-,

got on board all right, but his three trunks
and three parcels of samples were a little
late. They w*>re being rushed toward the
apron just as the steamer was moving out.
They were too late, and instead of landing
on the deck went into the bay. They were
fished out by Henry Engel, the boatman,
but all the' samples were ruined. The
ferry company footed the damages, and
there is now a lot of furnishing goods for
sale cheap at the foot of Clay street.
The schooner J. B. Leeds is now out
eighty-five days from Guaymas, Mexico,
for Grays Harbor, and grave fears are en
tertained for her safety. The prevailing
winds hove all been against her, however,

son was in command, and the crew of ten
men all hailed from San Francisco.
A BIG JUDGMENT.
Litigation Over the Kohler and Froh
line Wine Cellar Ended.
Judge Hebbard has rendered judgment
for 1260,000 in favor of Alexander Boyd
and J. Z. Davis, in their case against
Kohler, Frohling & Co.
The suit involved the ownership of the
Kohler and Frohling wine cellar on Second
street. Boyd and Davis erected the build
ing and bought the lot and the agreement
was that Kohler and Frohling were to pay
interest on the money and certain install
ments on the $260,000 which Boyd and
Davis had expended, until the entire
amount should be repaid. Then the un
incumbered title to the property was to
pass to Kohler and Frohling.
The attorneys for Kohler and Frohling
announced in court that their clients could
not pay;the interest and the installments,
and so judgment was given for Davis and
Boyle. This means that the title to the
property will again be vested in them.
THE POOLROOM QUESTION
New Way Adopted to Avoid
Arrest for Violating the
Ordinance.
Money Is Sent by the Postal Telegraph
Company to Poolroom Men in
San Jose.
The poolroom question came up before
Judge Low again yesterday morning,
when I. Goldtree, 20 Leidesdorff street,
appeared to answer a charge of violating
the ordinance.
He was defended by Attorney Julius
Kahn, who started a new theory. He
argued that if it was a crime to gamble on
a horserace the parties who should suffer
were the ones who made the bets and not
the commission meD. The San Jose pool
room men with whom the money had
beea actually placed and the patrons of
the commission houses here were the par
ties engaged in the alleged violation of the
ordinance.
He cited numerous decisions bearing on
the point and said he had scores of receipts
from the Postal Telegraph Company,
which he produced as evidence, showing
that the money had been sent to San Jose.
The money, he contended, had really been
sent, and the City was powerless to stop
them under the existing ordinance.
"1 understand," said the Judge, "the po
sition taken by the defense to be that the
commission men stand on Identical
grounds with the men who buy and sell
siocks for another."
"That is precisely the position we take,"
remarked Kahn.
The Judge said he would take the matter
under advisement, but. promised to give
his decision as soon as possible.
A Change of Name.
The advertising agency heretofore known
by the firm name of Alden & Faxon,
located at Cincinnati, Ohio, will in future
be known as the Frank H. Alden & Sous
Company. Mr. Alden is widely known as
a progressive and reliable newspaper
advertising agent, having been in the busi
ness for a quarter of a century. Having
taken his sons into the agency, thus infus
ing in it a new life, a continuation of
past successes will doubtless result.

A Sudden Death.

age and living at 924^ Harrison street, died

afternoon. The body was removed to the
Morgue.
NEW BOULEVARD CREATED
Van Ness Avenue Reserved
Through a Property-Owners'
Petition.
HEAVY TRAFFIC PROHIBITED.
Eolsom Street From Third to Sixth
Will Be Paved With Bituminous
Rock.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to recom
mend two important improvements to the
board at its next meeting.
The first was the matter of the Van Ness
avenue boulevard, which the Van Ness
Avenue Improvement Club has been agi
tating for some time past. The commit
tee decided to report in favor of reserving
the thoroughfare as was done in the case
of Golden Gate avenue, prohibiting the
passage of heavy teams for a greater dis
tance than one block and forever prohibit
ing the granting of street railroad fran
chises on the avenue.
The petition of the improvement club
to have a strip twenty -one feet wide in the
center of the thoroughfare reserved for the
purpose of planting ornamental trees and
shrubs was placed on file. The reason of
this action was that the property-owners
on the avenue expected the City to pay for
the proposed improvements in the face of
the fact that a statute exists that prevents
the Board of Supervisors from passing ap
propriations for such purposes.
After being informed of the legal view
of the matter the committee decided that
it could not take any action on behalf of
the City, and that if the property-owners
must have the center of the avenue orna
mented they must do so at their own ex
pense.
The committee also decided in favor of
recommending the bituminizing of Fol
som street, between Third and Sixth
streets.
This is an improvement that the South
Side Improvement Club has been agitat
ing ever since the board decided on the
permanent improvement of Folsom street.
It is the opening wedge to have the south
of Market street thoroughfare declared a
boulevard. Clerk Russell was instruct id
to advertise for bids for the work.
It was decided to report in favor of the
following petitions: Mrs. A. M. Parrott,
to erect electric light posts in front of the
new Parrott building on Market street;
Holly Park and Mission Street Improve
ment Club, for the removal of obstructions
of East Park street; superintendent of the
branch jail, for the purchase of a sprink
ling cart with which to water the county
road s.
.Protests to stop the following proposed
work for six months were granted: Mac
adamizing of Mariposa street from Ken
tucky to Indiana; grading of Fourteenth
avenue youth from Kailroad avenue to N
street, and the paving of Twenty-fourth
street from Castro to Diamond.
Petitions for the following street work
were considered favorably : For the pav
ing of Haight between Masonic and Stan
yan; for the grading of B street from
Sixth to Eighth avenue; for the closing
of Huron between Sickles avenue and Mis
sion; for stone sidewalks on Vallejo from
Webster to Fillmore, and on Jones between
Pacific and Broadway; for the paving of
Central avenue at the crossing of Pacific
and Jackson, and for stone sidewalks be
tween Jackson and Pacific; for the paving
of Eighteenth and Collingwood; for the
grading of First avenue to an 8 per cent
grade.
The Superintendent of Streets was di
rected to have the sewer in the crossing of
Twelfth avenue and California street re
constructed and to have a proper outlet
provided for the sewer in Twelfth avenue.
Supervisor Spreckels called attention to
complaints that had been made of inde
cent exhibitions at the Seventh avenue
waste pond on the Almshouse road. He
stated that men and boys were in the habit
of bathing there, and made a motion that
was carried that the Chief of Police be no
tified to stop the practice mentioned.

BROWN MAY BE TRIED ON ANOTHER CHARGE
Indignation Expressed for
the Fraudulent Press
Report.
THE PASTOE CENSURED.
McLean and Rader Give the
Defiant Minister Some
Hard Raps.
THE CONGREGATION AROUSED.
Steps Will Probably Be Taken To-
Day With a View of Forcing
Brown to Resign.
Key. William Ratlerâ lt 1Â» not clear
what Or. I'.iowii did before the council
rant, but it is painfully certain that
(since it a'ljounifd he has done some
things which deserve unqualified con
demnation.
Key. Mr. Sink, Stocktonâ lf it be true
that he dictated that dispatch to The
United Press, intending to give out the
impression that he had been acquitted,
Dr. Brown Iras lost all principle.
J.ayiuHii Curtis, Sacramento â At first it
was plainly apparent that Brown was
extremely antagonistic to us. He seemed
to think that we all stood in the light
of enemies.
Rev. Dr. Cruzan, Park Congrega
tional Church, San JKranoiscoâ The First
Congregational Church would have the
right to let the matter drop after filing
the findings of the council, but it would
look like ignoring not only the findings
but the charges against Dr. Brown as
well.
RÂ«t. F. Flawith, Fourth Congrega
tional Churchâ lf Dr. lirown has said
that he would not thank the council I
think he has done wrong. I certainly
would thank a council if, like Dr.
Brown. I had been a party to its hav
ing been called. At any rate, what
ever Dr. Brown may do, his church
should not fail to be courteous aud to
thank the council, which it had called
to settle a matter pertaining to itself.
<i. C. Dodge, Alaiueda-I think his
rt niirks about the council unjust and
uiicsiUed for, and indicated ungrateful
ness. Dr. Brown has certain! y been very
leniently dealt with.
Key. H. Melville Tenney, San Jose â
If our verdict has nbt cleared his min
isterial character from all taint of sus
picion, the facts must be blamed and
not the council.
Dr. McLean, Oaklandâ lf he really left
the church and -went to The Call office
after saying he wan going home, and
c:ivo or caused to be given any such
false report as ho is said to have given,
then he has most certainly thrown him
self liable to discipline by the Bay
Association. Any man who -would give
out such a false report would even do
worse to protect himself.
Pastor Brown to Secretary McCoy â
Allow me to introduce Mrs. Davidson,
one of the best workers in my church.
Dr. Brown's abortive attempt to foster
on the people of the United States a false
impression of the findings of the council
meets the unqualified condemnation of
his late judges and others interested in
Congregational affairs. This dispatch will
bear repeating first on account of its utter
falseness and the figure it will cut in Dr.
Brown's future ministry. It reads as fol
lows :
San Fraxctsco, March 17.
IJThe ecclesiastical court of inquiry which has
bten engaged in investigating certain charges
preferred against Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown of the
First Congregational Church of this City con
cluded its labor this evening at 10 o'clock,
bringing in a unanimous verdict acquitting
the pastor on every charge against him, and
concluding with "a hope and prayer that the
sharp lessons of recent months maybe taken to
heart by him, and in consequence his future
years may be more fruitful than any in the
past, and especially that this experience has
left this loved and honored church and its
pastor with a clearer understanding of their
duty to each other and to the Divine Master."
The doctor i<> satisfied with the decision of
the court, which could go no furtner in vindi
cating him than it did. The finding: will have
a material bearing on the charge of extortion
now pending against Mrs. Mary A. Davidson.
When interviewed by a Call reporter
last evening regarding the extraordinary
dispatch dictated to him by Dr. Brown,
George Fraser, night editor of The United
Press, said :
'â¢You of course understand that T-he
United Press is wholly unbiased in this as
in all other cases of a similar nature, and
that personally I am not acquainted with
a single member of Dr. Brown's conere
gation nor with the pastor himself and
have no interest whatsoever in the scandal.
"In company with Mr.Nagle and another
gentleman, whose name I did not catch,
Dr. Biown called upon me on Tuesday
night last at about 11 :30 o'clock. After an
exchange of greetings the doctor said:
" 'Mr. Fraser, I wish you would say to
the American public through The United
Press that the ecclesiastical court of in
quiry has concluded its labors ana has
found Dr. .Brown innocent of every charge
preferred against him. The verdict is an
absolute vindication.'
"After congratulating the pastor I aslced
Him if he would kindly indicate just what
he desired me to say. He thereupon dic
tated the story in question precisely as it
Has been published in The Call, being as
sisted by Mr. Nagle, who offered sugges
tions as to its wording. In reply to a quw
tion from me the doctor concluded :
" 'Yes, you may say that Dr. Brown is
thoroughly satisfied with the verdict of the
council. The members of the court could
go no further in vindicating him than they
did."
"After reading the story as I had it to the
three gentlemen I handed the type-written
copy to Dr. Brown and Mr. Nagle, both of
whom carefully scanned the dispatch and
read it aloud, handing it back to me with
the assurance that it was perfectly correct
and satisfactory.
"Acting in good faith I sent the story
oat to Buch of our Eastern papers as had
not already gone to press. In accordance
with the agreement between The Call and
The United Press the former was furnished
with a copy of the dispatch. Later my at
tention was called to the apparent discrep
ancy between the statement given me by
Dr. Brown and the copy of the verdict in
possession of The Call. Nothing then re
mained for me to do but to place on the
wires a verbatim copy of the council's find
ing without any comment whatever,
! which I did, leaving the reading public to
j judge the verdict for themselves."
The reception and filing of the findings
of the ecclesiastical council by the First
Congregationai Church does not end the
Brown scandal by any means, as had
been generally supposed. According to
the opinions of persons well inforrued on
parliamentary law and in the procedure
of the Congregational church, the next
tning in order is to take the report from
the file and adopt or reject it. If it is al
lowed to remain on tile that condition of
affairs will be construed as a deliberate
nub to the council, the members of
which neglected their own business affairs
for a whole month to comply with the
disagreeable duty thrust upon them by
the First Congregational Church of this
ity.
Since the council closed its proceedings
it has been ascertained that two new and
| important witnesses were neglected and
unsummoned by Judge Advocate Wood
hams. Those witnesses are Secretary Mc-
Coy of the Y. M. C. A. and his janitor.
It will be remembered that Dr. Brown
testified that on the evening on which he
took a little walk with Mrs. Davidson that
lady expressed a desire to inspect the inte
rior of the Y. M. C. A. building. Dr.
Brown volunteered to show her through
the building, and according to his sworn
statement he and Mrs. Davidson went into
the office of Secretary McCoy and had a
conversation, in which Mrs. Davidson
spoke in high terms of Miss Overman's
ability and piety.
Secretary McCoy's version of the affair
is altogether different. According to his
statement Dr. Brown asked for the use of
the room in which he and Mrs. Davidson
might have a private conversation and
they were shown to the committee-room
by the janitor.
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL WHO CEiMRE DR. BROWS FOR HIS PECULIAR PRESS DISPATCH.
Rev.J. K. McLean.
Mr. McCoy said last night: "Dr. Brown
came here with Hrs. Davidson and intro
duced her to me with the remark that she
â was one of the best workers in his church.
He then asked for a committee-room for a
meeting or a private conversation. There
was nothing unusual in such a request,
for ministers of all denominations use the
rooms here for committee meetings. I
called the janitor and he showed Dr.
Brown and Mrs. Davidson to that room
facing* the hall. They went in there and
nobody could have overheard their con
versation, because it was held in private."
This statement corroborates that of Mrs.
Davidson as to the manner in which she
and Pastor Brown entered the building.
Wiiy Secretary McCoy and the janitor
were not summoned as witnesses by the
judge advocate he, perhaps, can explain
satisfactorily.
It has been urged by prominent Congre
gationalists that Dr. Brown's methods
during the church trial were not always
those of the average innocent defendant.
They have called attention to Dr. Brown's
abuse of the witnesses against him,
notably Mrs. Davidson, Mrs. Stockton,
Mrs. Tnurston and Mrs. Barton, as being
not in consonance with the teaching*, of
Christ, who did not abuse hia enemies, but
blessed and forgave them.
It has been remarked as a significant
fact that Dr. Brown called four witnesses
to testify that although their business
called them on Montgomery street be
tween the hours of 4 and 6 p. m., the period
during which Mrs. Stockton said the doc
tor waited on the corners for the patter of
her pretty feet, they never saw the doctor
in company with Mrs. Stockton there or
anywhere else, or with any woman other
than his wife. Yet Dr. Brown went on
the stand and swore that on two occasions
Mrs. Stockton came upon him unawares
and walked with him for several blocks
along Montgomery street.
Dr. Brown, Mrs. Brown and Mr. Eaton
met Mrs. Stockton at, the Lotta Fountain
and walked up Market street together. Dr.
Brown rode in a car to Castro Heights
alongside of Mrs. Stockton, but he ilid not
know that she was in the vehicle until he
had entered the car. He also walked with
Mattie Overman from Pine and Kearny to
hiÃ office, and he took a promenade with
Mrs. Davidson one evening, yet his four
witnesses did not see the doctor on any of
these occasions.
The late ecclesiastical council received a
score or more of letters purporting to give
valuable information either for or against
Dr. Brown. One letter in particular caused
them considerable worry, and incidentally,
some loss of time.
A person signing himself Henry Mayer
and claiming to be a reporter made a
startling charge, involving the City editors
of the Chronicle and Bulletin. The writer
with some show of regret acknowledged
that he was the author of the famous
Valentine epistle, and that bis reason now
for exposing the scheme was that he had
not been paid. He claimed that the in
criminating epistle was inspired by the
Bulletin, they in some way having secured
possession of the facts set forth in the
original letter.
The fictitious Mayer then turned his at
tention to the Chronicle, alleging that that
papers supposed unfriendliness to Brown
was due to a personal grievance.
The council employed a private detect
ive to look up Mayer, but no trace of such
a man could he found at any of the news
paper offices.
They agreed that the author of the
letter was indeed responsible for the Val
entine document, but they were also
unanimous in the belief that some one
deeply interested in the verdict of the
council had inspired both.
The opposition to Dr. Brown is slowly
but surely crystallizing. Deacon Barnard,
Deacon Hatch and Dr. McDonald are lead
ing spirits in the movement. Dr. McDon

steps looking toward securing another
pastor.
It was rumored last nieht that Mattie
Overman had returned to the City, and
was again comfortably sheltered at Brown's
house, Inquiry at the pastor's home

point.
RADER'S PLAIN TALK.
Brown's Attack on the Council Will
Only Harm Himself.
"Dr. Brown's attitude toward the coun
cil is to be greatly deplored. It surely
does not impress his friends favorably.
There was only one thing for him to do
under the circumstances; that is patiently
and politely await the action of the
church."
Such were the remarks made by Rev.
William Rader yesterday. Continuing,
he said:
"It was most ungracious for him to in
terfere or in any way influence the pro
ceedings of the Wednesday evening meet
ing. How he can collect sufficient courage
â no, not courage, but a mysterious au
dacity â to occupy the pulpit next Sunday
morning lam at a loss to know. If he
does not wish to await the action of the
church, let him honorably withdraw."
"What effect will the verdict, rendered
by the council have upon Dr. Brown's
future relations with the Bay Conference?"
was asked.
"The church musv. take some actio non
this verdict, or the church and Dr. Brown
may become a subject for tne further con
sideration of the Congregational churches
of the Bay Conference," said Mr. Kader.
"Personally, I have been a friend of Dr.
Brown, but his inexcusable opposition to
the council and his bitterness to all who
are unable to see things to suit him will
go far toward a general destruction of
ministerial confidence in him. *
||"It is not clear what Dr. Brown did be

certain that since it adjournecr he has
done some thing 3 which deserve unquali

tated, according to newspaper report, the
United Press telegram containing what is
clearly a misrepresentation of the verdict,
he committed a serious offense, which
even his best friends cannot excuse or
condone.
"I am profoundly sorry, as a brother
minister and hitherto a warm friend of
Dr. Brown, that he has taken the course
he has. It is not ecclesiastical; it is not
right."
Concerning the deposition of a pastor
Mr. Ptader referred to section 7, chapter 5,
of Dexter's "Handbook of Congregation
alism." It reads as follows:
In the possible case of gross heresy or evil
life in its pastor a Congregational church
should proceed to discipline him for the same
as if he were only a private member, until it
has reached the stage of full conviction of
guilt. Thenâ in virtue of the involved fellow
ship of churchesâ instead of proceeding to pass
the final vote and pronounce sentence, it
should call a council to advise in the sad case.
Should the pastor be bo excessively unwise as
to decline to unite with them for this purpose
they may call one ex pane. Tnis council
should go over the case, and if satisfied of
guilt, and the pastor remains unpenitent, or
if, though ho be penitent, the aggravated cir
cumstances of the case seem to require it, it
should advise the church to depose the offender
from the ministry, and perhaps excommuni
cate him from its fellowship. It will tnen be
orderly for the church to accept and follow
this advice.
In order to apply this rule Mr. Rader
says it will be necessary for tbe First
Church to call another council. They
would not be called upon to review any of
the evidence in the case, but merely to pass
on or fix the punishment to suit the
crime.
Should the majority of the congregation
seek to retain the convicted pastor, then
the minority is privileged to call a council
out of courtesy requesting the majority to
join them. The rule for this line of pro
cedure is found in section 8 of the same
chapter. It also defines the rights of dis
satisfied sister churches. The section
named reads as follows :
Any church grieved by the conviction that a
sister church "deliberately receives and main
tains doctrines which subvert the foundations
of the Christian faith, or that it willfully toler
ates and upholds notorious scandals, or that it
persistently disregards and condemns the
communion of churches," may in a Christian
spirit admonish that church, and labor with It
to bring it to a better mind. (2) "If the ad
monished church refuse to hear its neighbor
church, Â«nd to remove the offense, it violates
the communion of churches, and the admon
ishing church may order a council to advise
concerning the acts and administrations of the
offending body. (3) Finding ground for the
same, this council may fitly admonish that
body. (4) Should this prove ineffectual in
Raining the desired relief, such council may
advise the churchesâ all others us well as those
of whom it may be composedâ to withhold
from that errins; church all acts of communion
till it shall give evidence of reformation.
(5) Affirmative- response to this will put the
offending church out of the fellowship of all
the churches thus acting, and by inference of
all non-protesting churches."
DR. McLEAN'S OPINION.
Censures Pastor Brown for Giving
Out a Report Which Was
False.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â The Rev.
J. K. McLean, moderator of the late eccle
siastical court which investigated the
charges against Dr. C. O. Brown, was seen
this evening at his home on Telegraph
avenue, Oakland.
In answer to a question he said: "It
would not be in place for mo to express an
opinion upon the conduct of Dr. Brown at
the prayer meeting in the First Congrega
tional Church on Wednesday evening. I
have only newspaper reports, and besides
I am in a most peculiar position. As
moderator I was more or less drawn into
the disputes of both tides, and both Dr.
Brown's friends and foes were at times dis
pleased. As to the church's action upon
the report, I understand that nothing
more was done than to accept the report of
the council. Of course that had to be done.
"If any vote of approbation or censure
of the committee's worlc is attempted then
the factions will show themselves. This
may or may not be attempted at the next
meeting of the church. The church has
nothing at all to do with the ministerial
standing of Dr. Brown, and any action
they may take will cut no figure with the
â Bay Association. The latter place is
where his standing will be settled. This
body will meet in April, and at that time
there promises to be some interesting de
velopments.
"I am greatly surprised at the report in
Wednesday's Call of Dr. Brown's giving
out the news of his own vindication. If he
really left the churcli and went to The Call
office after saying he was going home, and
gave or caused to be given any such false
report as he is said to have given, Ihen he
has most certainly thrown himself liable
to discipline by the Bay Association.
"Any man that would give out such a
false report would do even worse to pro
tect himself. I can hardly believe that he
did such a thing. If we can get the origi
nal copy of that statement or the affidavits
of the gentlemen who received it that Dr.
Brown did furnish such a report to them,
then we will have sufficient evidence to
sustain a serious charge of unministerial
conduct against him."
Dr. McLean seemed greatly grieved at
the blow that religion bad received by the
conduct of pastors and laymen who had
been connected with the church scandals
at Portland, Tacoma and San Francisco
during the past year. He declared a be
lief at the close of the interview that all
would be overruled for the furtherance of
the gospel of salvation.
Dr. Freedland, acting pastor of the First
Congregational Church of Oakland, was
asked his opinion of Dr. Brown's conduct
at the Wednesday evening meeting. He
replied:
"I have nothing to say.'jf He was next
asked what effect the investigation would
have upon Dr. Brown's future. To this he
made the same reply. He absolutely re
fused to talk upon the subject, and when
Curtis of Sacramento,
RÂ»v. William Rader.
asked what he would do if he was situated
in a like situation he burst into a hearty
laugh and said : "I am not on the stand to
be cross-examined. Please excuse me,"
and left the reporter standing in the hall.
"LOST ALL PRINCIPLE."
Rev. Mr. Sink of Stockton Thus
Characterizes Dr.
Brown.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 19.â Rev. R.
H. Sink, pastor of the First Congregational
Church of this city, who was a member of
the council in the trial of Dr. Brown, was
seen this evening by a Call representative
in reference to Dr. Brown's criticisms of
the findings. of the council.
"I utterly fail to see bow these findings
exonerate Dr. Brown in any -way of the
serious charees which called the council
together," said Mr. Sink. ( 'I sincerely be
lieve that every member of the council
met for the purpose of doing justice with
out fear or favor, and Dr. Brown's criti
cisms of the findings are not only uncalled
for, but discourteous to every member of
the council.
"I -will say frankly that if it be true that
he dictated that dispatch to the United
Press, intending to give out the impression
that he had been acquitted, Dr. Brown has
lost all principle. Dr. Brown ought to re
sign. The sense of the council was just as
explained in the paragraph where regret
was expressed that the findings could not
be made more explicit.
"The findings of the council were not in
the nature of an acquittal, neither were
they a whitewash, and I believe that Dr.
Brown does not consider them such. And
further, I do not see how any one can in
terpret the findings as meaning that the
council considered Dr. Brown innocent.
"The findings were drawn without passion
or feeling, and this being the case, the
conncil could not render a verdict on
charges which could not be proven by evi
dence adduced before them.
"Dr. Brown is of a very irritable temper
and has been under a great strain, but this
does not excuse him for his conduct in crit
icizing those who were called together to
try and arrive at a decision in the matter.
Those findings leave a cloud hanging over
Dr. Brown that could hardly be made
worse by an actual conviction. I would
hate to see a dear friend of mine under a
similar one.
"Should the Association of Congrefcational
Ministers take such action as would dis
qualify Dr. Brown from further member- â¢
ship in the association any church calling
him as pastor would be outside the pale of
Congregationalism.
"Personally, I approve of the strongest
planks in the findings, and I do not see
how Dr. Brown or his friends can consider
that document as exculpating him from
the serious charges which called us
together."
The Rev. Mr. Sink spoke with perfect
frankness on the subject, and it is very
evident that had he bad the drawing of the
document it would have borne much
harder on Dr. Brown than it didâ at least
as hard as tne testimony would admit.
Attorney Parkinson, who was a lay
member of the council, did not attend the
sessions during the last week, and accord
ingly had nothing to do with the findings.
SMILING TENNEY TALKS.
Thinks the Verdict Is Well Within
the Bounds of the Evidence.
SAX JOSE, Cal., March 19.â Rev. H.
Melville Tenney, pastor of the First Con
eregational Church of this city, and who
was a member of the Brown court of in
quiry, when questioned to-day as regards
Dr. Brown's attitude toward the members
of the council, said :
As a member of the council I wish to treat
Dr. Brown and his attitude toward our verdict
with the same sourtesy and Christian kindli
ness with which I tried to treat him during the
sessions of the council.
I feel that iv his expressions before his
church meeting, if we can trust to reports in
newspapers, he has done scant justice toward
the council and its opinions as expressed in its
findings.
There was the moit earnest desire on the
part ol all members of that body to give every
item of evidence in his favor its utmost
weight. If our verdict has not cleared his
ministerial character from all taint of sus
picion the facts must be blamed and not the
council.
I feel that our findings, so far as they cen
sure Dr. Brown, are well within the bounds of
the evidence adduced, instead of being in any
degree beyond them. It will be an occasion of
sadness to other members of the council", as it
is to me, if Dr. Brown does not receive our
kindly admonition in the same spirit in which
it was given.
"SHOULD BE GRATEFUL."
Dodge of Alameda Writhes Under
Pastor Brown's Comments.
G. C. Dodge, one of the laymen on the
Brown jury, was seen by a reporter last
evening at his home on Alsmeda avenue,
Alameda.
He expressed himself rather vigorously
in regard to Brown's utterances about the
Rev. Dr. Tenney.
council as contained in yesterday morn
ing's papers, and did not hesitate to say
that the pastor was a most ungrateful
being. He thinks that Brown has been
most leniently dealt with by the council
and that he should be perfectly satisfied
with the verdict. Said he :
I know that three-fourths of the council
would have been for a stronger verdict, but to
arrive at a unanimous finding and avoid a ma
jority and minority result they were willing to
compromise. It is my opinion that most of
the members did not entertain at the end the
â¢highest regard for Dr. Brown, but that did not
affect the verdict. They were actuated in ren
dering the verdict tney did with kindliness
toward the accused, and they wanted to give
him the benefit of every doubt. I think his re
marks about the conncil are unjust, uncalled
for, and indicate ungratefulness. Dr. Brown
certainly has been very leniently dealt with.
IGNORING THE FINDINGS.
Why the First Church Should Take
Seme Decided Action.
Rev. Dr. Cruzan of the Park Congrega
tional Church said:
"It .seems to me that the church has not
expressed its opinion at all in regard to
the council. If the report of the council
had been adopted, instead of being merely
filed, it would have carried the vote of
censure with it. The report has been sim
ply received and filed and no action upon
it has been taken. Now, it remains for the
First Church to take action congregation
ally. The procedure is to adopt the re
port, or to set it aside entirely, or to pro
ceed to investigate the charges already in
vestigated by the council. It seems to me
that the First Church has left the whole
matter open.
"If the church should see fit to ignore
the report by allowing it to remain on the
file without further action, and should go
ahead and retain Dr. Brown as its pastor,
it would be in order for the othar Congre
gational churches, in their discretion, to
withdraw from the fellowship of the First
Church, and it would then stand as an
isolated and independent church. It has
taken the first step toward action, and it is
in order for the church to take this report
from the file and act upon it, or else
brush it aside entirely and indorse Dr.
Brown.
"It would have been the courteous thing
for them to have adopted the motion to
spread the report upon the records and to
have thanked the council for having so
faithfully performed the duty entrusted to
it. It certainly seems to me that a body
of men who would leave their work and
spend a month of their time in the very
disagreeable duty, and in a matter on
which the verdict might be displeasing to
the members of the church, should receive
thanks, and the more especially in view of
the fact that the members of the council
worked without any compensation what
ever. Some of the members were obliged
to neglect their business for four weeks,
and in addition had to spend some of their
own money for their actual expenses.
"The First Church should be allowed a
reasonable time within which to take the
report from the file before the other
churches should exercise their discretion
in the matter.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the
council in the intimidation chnrgo pre
ferred by the young woman, who was men
tioned as a niece of a member of the
council, I would say that it seems to me
that the council was called to investigate
charges against Dr. Brown, and anythinp
contrary to his character would be ger
mane. Suppose it had been proved that
Brown had committed theft since the
council was called, there can be no doubt
that the council had a right to investigate
it, because that act would have an im
portant bearing on hij fitness to remain
the pastor of any church. Dr. Brown
ought to be glad to have every charge, no
matter what its date, that might implicate
his character thoroughly investigated.
"An innocent man on trial is supposed
to desire to have all the facts brought out,
giving to the evidence such weight as it
ought to have.
"In this matter I feel only the strongest
sympathy for Dr. Brown, and i appreciate
the peculiar circumstances under which
he has staggered. 1 have expressed this
sympathy to him personally and the hope
and the wish that he would be able to
make everything clear and go ahead in his
ministry.
"Conaregationally, the church has a
right to stop with the fiiins of the report,
but it would look like ignoring not only
the findings of the council but the charges
as well."
THANKS WERE DUE.
If Dr. Brown Was Ungracious His
Church Should Not
Be So.
Rev. F. Flawith, pastor of the Fourth
Congregational Church, on Green street,
was asked yesterday as to his opinion on
the action of the First Church. He pre
faced his remarks with the statement that
he had not been a witness in the case, nor
had he been a member of the council, and
that he spoke as a clergyman of the Con
gregational church having the good of the
church and the dignity of his profession at
heart. He said:
"The members of the council will be the
proper persons to give their opinions as to
the duty of the First Congregational
Church in the matter. The duty of the
Ecclesiastical Council is sin: ply to
advise, and, as a rule, where
a mutual council has been convened its
advice and findings are accepted. The
opinion of a mutual council carries with it
great weight, because both sides have con
sented to the council being called. It can
be readily understood that an ex-parte or
one-sided council would not be worth
much.
"I don't think that the council intended
to say anything with respect to Dr.
Brown's being retained or being advised
to hand in his resignation. If the other
Congregational churches thought that
Layman Dodge.
the First Church had ignored the coun
cil and its findings, they could, if they
choose, withdraw from fellowship with it
and leave it in a state of isolation or in a
condition of religious ostracism, but
v.-hetuer the churches would take any
action in the matter would depend upon
the seriousness of the case.
"With regard to Dr. Brown's contention
that the council had no jurisdiction over
the charge of intimidating the young
woman who had inspected the church
organ, I would say that that would
depend upon the letters missive. As I
understand it, tlie council formulated its
own cnarges. Dr. Brown invited a full and
complete investigation of anything and
everything that mi^ht be urged against
him, and I should think he would have
been glad to have everything investigated
that had occurred before or after the coun
cil had been called. So far as I know, the
council acted entirely within its rights.
"It seems to me if I had been a party to
the calling of the council I should feel that
courtesy demanded that I should thank
the members whatever might be their ver
dict, but I would never thank a council
that I had never called. As I understand
it Dr. Brown called or requested this coun
cil to be called. He did that, and he fur
thermore invited all the world to appear
and tell what they knew about him.
"I think if Dr. Brown said he would not
thank the council he did wrong. I certain
ly would thank a council if I had been a
party to its having been called, but never
if I had not consented to it. At any rate,
whatever Dr. Brown might do, his
church should not fail to be courteous and
to thank the council which it had called
to settle a matter pertaining to itself."

Truth About the Workings of These

THERE ARE NOT A FEW ENTHUSIASTS -
who are wrapped up in the feats of the men
with highly developed muscles who are known

industry to develop as the result of inquiry that
the faculty of these "strong men" as "stayers
is very small. And, indeed, if the truth were
told, hey would most of them j have "a weak
back, very suddenly if they were called on to
do an ordinary day's work. Most people know
what that weak back means. It means a cer-
tain indication that the individual who has it
is not In good health. It may mean (taken in
the abstract as a symptom) that one Is suffer-
ing from a -severe,, nervous ; disorder, for in-
stauce. But as a rule it means that trie system
is "run down." and from this state the most

that matter may very readily have â¢ his â  ideas

against Rex. Mr. Brown, in answer to a
question as to what had been that gentle
man's attitude toward the council said:
"At tirst it was very apparent that Blown
was extremely antagonistic to us. He
seemed to think we all stood in the light
oi enemies and that instead of being there
for the purpose of ascertaining the truth
of the charges that we had gathered for
the sole purpose pf condemning him.
"In fact, during the first two weeks of
the trial, there were times when he would
hardly deign to answer our questions in a
respectful manner. Later he either was
informed by his counsel that his conduct
would prejudice his cause or else he at last
bejran to comprehend that we were acting
in justice and equity and not from a sense
of malice, and everything went smoother.
"No, there was not thepiightestevidence
produced that Brown was guilty of adul
tery, and it is my private opinion that
Mrs. Tunnel!, Mrs. Davidson and Miss
Overman had entered into a compact to
bleed Brown."
MRS. TUNNELL FOUND.
Matt!Â© Overman Was Not With
Her, but Expected Any
Time.
SAN DIEGO, JUal., March 19.â Mrs.
Tunnell arrived from Ensenada this morn
ing. She boarded a car at the Santa Fe
wharf and came up town. The next seen
of her was at National City, where she
waited in the N. C. and O. depot for three
hours expecting to meet some one, pre
sumably Mattie Overman. But Mattie
did not appear. It is believed that Miss
Overman changed her mind about going to
Ensenada by stage and communicated
with Mrs. Tunnell to that effect, fixing a
meeting for to-day.
Miss Overman has not been seen since
her departure from Tia Juana. She has
displayed great shrewdness in her efforts to
keep dark. Mrs. Tunnell was very impa
tient when Miss Overman did not appear
to-day and she told the station man that she
would have to do some telegraphing.
Later she said she would write. She left
the depot after a while and that is the last
seen of her.
It is reported that she met Mattie later
and that they took the Los Angeles train
at 2:50 o'clock. This report could not be
verified. Mrs. Tunnell travels under the
name of Mrs. M. Fowler. She knows San
Diego quite well, having lived here some
years ago. soon after her elopement with a
young man twenty years her junior. She
taught school here a few months.
DEFENDS DR. POND.
Layman Ruthrauff Comes to the
Rescue of His Ministerial
Friend.
A. T. Rtithrauff sends the following
communication in defense of Dr. Pond :
Editor Call: In tho interview with Mrs. S. B.
Cooper, published this morning, in speaking
of the members of the council she says: "They
did their duty, in view of all the circum
stances. I would make but one exception, and
that is Dr. Pond. His motive can no linger be
in question, if the newspaper expose be true."
I wish to state the "newspaper expose" or re
ports purporting to give his opinions in regard
to Dr. Brown's guilt or innocence have not
been correct, especially those in a certain
evening paper. Dr. Pond's motives are known
to be pure, not only in regard to the case con
sidered by the council, but in regard to all
other matters. He attempted no leadership,
as has been stated. In fact, he took a much
less active part in the discussions of the coun
cil than would naturally be expected from one
fo prominent in the work of the Congrega
tional churches of this coast.
Dr. Pond was challenged on the first day of
the council by Dr. Brown, who believed that
he nad been biased by a call from Mrs. Cooper.
Dr. Pona, rightly, was unwilling to concede
Dr. Brown's guilt in advance. His actions
and expressions have been those ot a man who
realized the grave responsibility resting upon
hfm as a member of the council, and who was
resolved, by the help of Almighty God, to do.
his whole duty in the matter.
As motives are so often impugned, I want it
distinctly understood that neither Dr. Pond
iior any one else has been consulted in regard
to this, but I feel it but an act of justice to
counteract, if possible, the effect of the false
light in which he has been placed.

RICHMOND SEWERS.
The Board of Health Has Taken Action
in Regard to Their Condition.
The members of the Board of Health
are wondering how it is that the residents
of the vicinity of Twelfth avenue and Cali
fornia street, who recently complained of
the sewerage in that section, did not know
that a Health Inspector called the next
day after the complaint was filed, and,
after confirming the reports of the bad
condition of the sewer, reported the mat
ter to the board as a nuisance. As a mat
ter of fact the subject was given immedi
ate consideration by the board, and also
the Street Superintendent and the Board
of Supervisors notified that the sewer was
in noed of repairs.
The complaint was received on March
11, and on the following day a commu
nication relative to the affair was in the
hands of the Supervisors.

THE STRIKE MAY
YET BE GENERAL
The Building Trades Likely
to Be Drawn Into
the Fight.
BOTH SIDES OBSTINATE.
The Master Painters Are
Strengthening Their As
sociation.
ALL THE UNION MEN ARE OUT
Each Side Preparing for a Long
Straggle, in Which There Will
Be No Mercy Shown.
The strike started by the union painters
twelve days ago threatens to extend to all
branches of the building trades in this
City. The Building Trades Council, repre
senting 4000 men, at a meeting last night,
set in motion the machinery that makes a
big general strike not only possible but
highly probable.
The union painters last evening decided
that every job in the City shall be tied up.
â¢Moreover, they decided to at once enter
the open market and compete with the
bosses for work.
The master painters are equally active
and have committees canvassing the City
drawing the outside bosses into the asso
ciation.
The wholesale paint-dealers have ap
peared in the field and favor the triangular
alliance suggested by the bosses.
MAY BECOME GENERAL.
Building Trades Set In Motion the
Machinery for a General
Strike.
The principal matter discussed at the
meeting of the Building Trades Council
last night was the painters' strike. Dele
gates from the Painters' Union explained
the situation and cave the necessary
notice that they would call upon all the
unions in the building trades to come out
in a general strike to enforce the working
carti system. The council's working-card
system will not go into effect until April 1.
It will be at least a week before the situ
ation can be placed before the several
unions and answers received therefrom by
the council. In conformity to the council
rules the matter was referred to the inves
tigating committee, consisting of Saun
ders, McCartney, Bailey, Schuetz and
Burns, who will also look into the lathers'
strike for the same purpose.
Individually every member indorsed the
strike, but as representatives of unions
they were, much to their regret, obliged to
pursue the slower plan laid down in their
laws.
President Kerrigan of the Lathers' Union
asked the financial assistance of the coun
cil in the matter of the striking lathers
who were arrested for murder in the
Fourth-street troubles a week ago. It M-as
decided to appoint as a committee a dele
gate from each union in the council to
investigate the murder charge before mak
ing any recommendation to the union.
A FIGHT TO A FINISH.
Painters Decide That Every Job In
the City Must Be
Tied Up.
The Painters' and Decorators' Union at
a mass-meeting last evening decided that
the present strike is general and a fight
to the finish. At a special meeting held
"Wednesday evening a dozen or more union
painters objected to being called off the
jobs when the bosses had acceded to the
union's demands, so a mass-meeting was
called to decide the point. The Temple at
115 Turk street was filled so that standing
room was at a premium. Fully 1000 were
present. Both sides of the question were
discussed fully.
Those in favor of maintaining a general
Btrike stated that most of the boss painters
who decidel favorably to the union were
finishing the contracts of tne bosses who
are unfavorable, and that they were pass
ing the non-union men from one job to an
other.
When the matter came to a vote less
than two dozen hands voted for letting the
men return to work. The vote for- main
taining a general strike brought up fully
975 bands. The verdict was received with
great enthusiasm.
The question of the best tactics to Dur
sue in carrying on the fight was discussed.
It was decided that the painters will enter
the open market and compete with the
bosses for contracts. The executive com
mittee has received the assurance of the
material men that the journeymen paint
ers can have all the paints and oils they
want. If the property-owners desire they
can furnish their own materials. Such
work can be done under the direction of
any inspector the house-owners may select,
if they so desire.
If necessary the journeyman will under
bid the bosses for work. A committee of
twenty-five was appointed to make ar
rangements to secure contracts or take
contracts left unfinished.
The principal leaders warned the strik
ers against committing any act of violence.
A committee was selected to confer with
those who have promised .financial aid to
the striking painters, who have settled
down for a long, bard struggle. There is
no fear of the men coming to serious want.
The delegates to the Building Trades
Council were instructed to place the con
dition of affairs before that body with the
view of having the entire building trades'
unions take up the right. The action of
the council appears in another column.
WARNING TO STRIKERS.
The Leaders Command Them Not
to Commit Any Overt
Acts.
After the decision of the striking paint
ers to tie Tip every job in town and not
permit any of their men to go to work a
few of the dissatisfied intimated that they
did not intend to obey the decision of the
majority.
If they do their disobedience will arouse
some ill feeling on the part of the others,
and the executive committee, to prove that
they will discountenance any disturbance
or trouble, issued the following card :
TO UNION PAINTERS AND THE PUBLIC.
To one and all of our members and our sym
pathizers I appeal. Let no violent act be coni

MASTER PAINTERS ACTIVE.
Nine Committees Engaged In Se-
curing 1 Members for the
Association.
The members of the Master Painters'
Association are neglecting nothing that
can strengthen their position in the con
test with the journeymen, and strenuous
efforts are being made to get all the boss
painters in the City into their oreanizra
tion. For this purpose the City has been
divided into nine districts and committees
of two have been detailed to work with the
bosses in each district ana induce them to
join the association. These committees
have only just beeun work, but they
already report results far exceeding their
fondest hopes.
"The outside bosses," said President
Black of the association yesterday, "are
now more than willing to join us. Six
months ago they pooh-pooaed the idea
that there could be any advantage to them
in joining the association, but now it has
began to rain and they are all struggling
to get into the ark. By the next regular
meeting of the association our organiza
tion will number 100 members.
"In this connection there is one point
which I wish you would emphasize as much
as possible. Tnis plan of ours for strength
ening ourselves has nothing to do with our
fight against the journeymen. We have
already all the support we need for that
purpose. Our idea in increasing our mem
bership is merely to make ourselves strong
enough to protect the material men in
case they agree to give us better prices
Naturally if we go to them with that
proposition numbering only say twenty
five members they will have little if any
inducement to deal with us. But if we go
to them one hundred strong that is a very
different matter. â¢
"You see, the painting trade in this City
has conditions which obtain in no other
business. In other lines there is a certain
discount granted to the trade, but in the
painting business there is no trade dis
count at all. Therefore any property
owner or iourneyruan can go to the whole
salers and jret just as good figures as can
we who have the expense of keeping up a
business. It did not use to be so. Twenty
years ago the small paintshop paid the ex
penses of the business with the profits
from the sale of material, but all that is
ended."
Another feature which has been intro
duced into the fight by the bosses in order
to strengthen each other in their deter
mination not to give in, is the trading of
non-union men from one shop to an
other. It is a recognized fact, of course,
that the bosses have men in their employ
who have not struck and who will not go
out under any circumstances; also that
certain of the shops have contracts on
hand which must be filled without delay.
So in order that the bosses, whose work is
pressing, may not be forced to yield, the
other shops are loaning their non-union
men and the work goes on uninterrupt
edly. Each morning the non-union men
who are not needed that day at their own
shop are sent to President Black's place
on Eddy street, whence that official dis
tributes them among the hard-pressed
bosses of the association, and this, to a
great extent, of course, nullifies the pres
sure that the union has been able to bring
to bear upon individual bosses.
"Another thing which greatly aids us,"
said President Biack, "is the fact that the
property-owners and taxpayersâ the solid
men of the community â are with U3.
Without exception, men whom I have
talked with are in sympathy with us and
urge us not to yield an inch. The prop
erty-owners realize that if the union wins
this right it will mean to them greatly in
creased expenses in repairs."
In connection with the suggestion that
the journeymen painters should take con
tracts themselves, securing tbeir material
from the wholesalers on credit, several
material men when seen yesterday, seemed
more than dubious.
"Will I sell paint to the journeymen?" 1
repeated the senior partner of the Bass-
Heuter Paint Company. "Of course. I
will sell them the whole store provided
they have the money. Credit? "Well,
that's different. They" would be treated
just like anybody else." I should look them
up, and if they had an established credit I
should probably grant it. Bat one thing
you can bet on â there won't any material
go out of my store on the chance of a
building lien. Not much! It will stay
here until it rots first."
Mr. Brown, the general manager of the
same firm and a member of the Paint and
Oil Club, expressed himself indirectly as in
favor of granting the bosses' request for a
trade discount. His words were: "We
are of course anxious to assist and protect
our customers, and there can be no doubt
but that the Master Painters' Association
is one of our largest customers."
It was currently reported that twenty
five men who had been called out of the
St. Denis shop were ready to go to work
again. They approached St. Denis in a
body yesterday morning and agreed to
stand by him till the end of the strike.
They were not, however, put to work yes
terday.
M'CORD FAVORS THE UNION
One Master Painter Who Would
Grant the Journeymen's
Demands.
Mark L. McCord of 1731 Market street is
one member of the Master Painters' Asso
ciation who favors granting all the union
demands, even including the card system.
"With two others he made a hard though
unsuccessful fight for the union in the
meeting of the bosses last Tuesday night,
when their ultimatum discountenancing
the card system was promulgated. Mr.
McCord's enthusiasm is, however, likely
to be somewhat dampened, for though he
has championed the journeymen in sea
son and out of season he was notified last
nicht that his men too would De called out.
"It doesn't seem quite the fair thing to
me," said Mr. McCord yesterday. "Here
I have made these fellows' tight, and it
surely was not my fauit that 1 could not
control the other sixty members; and yet
I am to be left in tne lurch entirely. I
would not care except that mine is inside
work, and the carpets are up and the
whole house torn up for this work. Three
days would finish it, too.
"But I am a union man and always have
been, and I believe that the demands of
the journeymen are well within reason.
The other bosses seem to be very much
afraid of the card system, yet I be
lieve it has worked well in other trades,
including the printers. So 1 believe their
demands are just, and I favor granting
them. However, a great majority of the
bosses are against me on that, and, of
course, I shall stand by the association."
WOULD END THE FIGHT.
Wholesale Paint-Dealers Favor an
Arrangement In Favor of the
Journeymen.
The executive committee of the San
Francisco Paint, Oil and Varnish Associa
tion, representing the wholesale dealers
in this branch, met last evening in the
Occidental Hotel. J. P. Jourden of Duffy
& Co. occupied the chair. The secretary
was S. Magner. The other members of the
committee present were G. Ammerup, R.
O. Nason and 8. H. Brown, each one from
a wholesale house.
The meeting was a customary monthly
one, but ft letter from the Master House
Painters' and Decoralors' Association,
which was read by the secretary, gave the
executive session* a peculiar interest at
the present time. Thi3 communication
was discussed at considerable length, as it
bad a direct bearing on the strike of the

painters. It was decided to request the
master painters to meet the executive
committee of the wholesalers' club next
Monday night when a conference will be
arranged between the two associations
and possibly some plan may be evolved
by which the strike maybe brought to a
close.
After the meeting adjourned Secretary
Magner spoke upon the situation quite
freely. He was joined in thee onversation
by the chairman and members of the com
mittee.
"There has been some informal talk,"
he said, "of raising the price of paintin :,
but that was not discussed at to-night's
meeting of the committee."
"What, then, is the ultimate aim ot the
conference?"
"That has yet to be determined, though
I have no doubt it is to put a stop to the
strike it a feasible plan of action can be
devised."
Another member of the committee in
terrupted the secretary at this point and
explained that the proposition was to es
tablish a "three-cornertd arrangement"
among the journeymen painters, the mas
ter painters and the wholesale dealers in
painters' supplies which would result in
a peaceful conclusion of the present diffi
culty. It may be that the price of paints,
etc., will be so arranged as to favor the
master painters, who will thus be enabled
to give their workmen concessions now de
manded and slill continue in business
with a protit equal to the old one. Any
how there is a distinct sentiment in favor
of meeting the strikers like men.
J. W. ROSE REPLIES.
The President of the Painters'
Union Answers the Bosses'
Statements.
J. W. Rose, president of the Painters'
and Decorators' Union, has taken excep
tions to statements made by several of the
master painters with reference to the pres
ent strike and its causes. He says that
they have not confined themselves to facts
in the least in presenting their bosses' side
of the case. Mr. Rose's statement is as
follows:
In the first place the strike was not called by
the unemployed painters, as Mr. Frazer states,
but by the union, irrespective of the employed
or the unemployed. The men have not been
making an average wage of $3 a day as be
stated. The outside average ol the journey
men has not been over $7 a week, arid I can
prove the truth of this assertion. He says that
the wages is a side issue. Does this look like
it?
It is true, as he states, that the main fight is
on ihe working-card system, but the object of
this card system is to keep cheap labor out of
the shops, because as soon a* tho bosses can pet
outside help forsl and $1 50 a day and dozens
of boys for from $4 to $6 a week the journey
men's'wages will drop at once. Tho working
card is to prevent this, and that is the reason
the bosses arc making this point the main is
sue in the fight.
Mr. Black also makes several erroneous state
ments. In reviewing the labor situation for
the past ten years with reference to the paint
ing trade he speaks of the union men inter
fering with tho laborers In his shop. I want
Mr. Black to understand, end he no doubt
does, that the union does not intend to inter
fere with his laborers, of whose weliare he is
so solicitous. What we do demand is that with
his cheap Jaborers he docs not encroach upon
the regular skilled mechanics. He speaks of
paying his laborers $2 and $2 50 a day. Now
let us sco how consistent he is. Mr. Black and
others state that there are iv this City about
2000 journeymen painters. Of this number
only 300 have steady positions. Does it seem
reasonable that Mr. Black or anyother boss
painter would empioy unskilled laborers and
young boys for $2 50 a day when they can se
cure 1700 skilled journeymen painters for the
same rate of wages? He says that under the
working-card system we would run "his" busi
ness. This we deny.
The painting trade is as much our business
as it is his. Does he look upon the working
man in the same light that he regards a barrel
of oil ? Have we no voice in Â«he question of
how long we shall work or the rate of pay we
shall receive, or any voice in the matter of con
ditions under which we shall labor ? I think
we have, and I think this strike will prove that
we have.
Mr. Black speaks of his fine fruit ranch. How
did he get that fine ranch? Was the money
that bought it the product of bis efforts with
pot and brush ? No; it was the protit he made
on the labor of other men. Again I say we have
a right to regulate our business a little and
have some say as to how much profit we can
afford to let other men make out of our labor.
REPUBLICANS IN HARMONY
The County Committee Is Pre
paring to Go Ahead With
the Primary.
A MAHONEY-KELLY EXJMOR.
RousiDg Republican Mass-Meeting in
the Forty - first Last
Night.
Local Republican affairs gave no new
developments yesterday. H was not
definitely decided when the County Com
mittee shall meet to issue the call for the
primary and otherwise perform the duties
imposed on it by the Congressional com
mittees of the Fourth and Fifth districts.
As the County Committee has officially
been given charge of the selection of dele
gates to the State Convention, and as the
committee will act in harmony in holding
a primary in the regular way,, the tangle
which followed the meeting of the State
Central Committee has been straightened
out in a. way that insures party success
and the practically unanimous approval of
the Republicans of thetlity.
The County Committee will act as a sort
of dual body, agreeing upon the same date
for the municipal primaries in the Fourth
and Fifth districts and upon the general
course of affairs, while the members
representing each district will constitute
separate bodies for the doing of official acts.
The Mahoney-Kelly committee of the
Fourth District, created by the use of two
forged proxies at a snap meeting held in
Senator Mahonev's rooms, has been qui
escent for several days. It appears Jikely
to die a natural death, though it was re
ported yesterday that Senator Mahoney
and Martin Kelly had a plan to wait until
the date for the regular primary is an
nounced and then call a rival primary for
the same day. .
Although practically the entire party in
the Fourth District approves the course of
the regular committee and will recognize
the regular primary as the one which rep
resents the party and its best interests, it
is said that Mahoney and Kelly hope that
by naming a delegation of prominent men
they may be able to seat a portion of them
in the State Convention, and so get some
thing for themselves out of the situation.
Meanwhile the leading Republicans of
the City and the masses of the party are
in increasing numbers expressing their
pleasure individually and in district and
club meetings all over the City at the out
come. The primary election will be held
in the. regular way by the regular party
authority, and it will be a fair and open
election,' al which the voters will select
their delegates to the convention.
FOR REPUBLICAN UNITY.
Many Speakers Address the Forty-first
District McKinley Club.
The McKinley Club of the Forty.first
District met last night in Pixley Hall, cor
ner of Polk and Pacific streets, and enter
tained resident Republicans with political
themes discussed by a number of well
known local speakers.
H. C. Firebaugh, the president of the
club, presided, and introduced the speak
ers, the first being ex-Assembly man Booth
of the Forty-first, who congratuJated the
meeting upon the Republican outlook and
hoped for a solid party in the City.
Al Bou-vier urged the voters to become
better acquainted with each other and
wi'h their fellow-partisana in the district,
that all might be amicably united in the
campaign.
C. W. Kyle advised organization, har
mony and proper leadership in districts,
and said that bimetallism and protection
are the fundamental principles of the
party, and -will be adhered to, no matter
what great Republican may be the party's
candidate.
Addie L. Ballou, president of the
Woman's Republican Club, aroused great
applause during her speech when she
declared: "An old bachelor kingdom
wouldn't be worth a cent; an old maid
kingdom wouldn't be worth a cent; it
takes a union of men and women to make
Â» successful home, and they make the
Government. The woman is to be an
actor in the next campaign."
Silas White, principal of the Spring
Valley School, pledged himself publicly to
vote for woman suffrage at the very tirst
opportunity he should have, and then
created a humorous furor by pointing to a
placard on the wallâ "ln God We Trust"â
and exclaiming, "How long would it take
to empty this room if either the Rainey or
the Buckley ganc had that before them ?
They'd turn it toward the wall or leave
the halt." He concluded with a plea for
the new charter.
Field of the Thirty-seventh District cited
a particular instance of a local tirm that
had lost $150,000 in one year through the
repeal of the McKinley tariff, and had to
release all its high salaried men to econo
mize, thus causing unemployed men to
walk the streets. He asserted that every
Republican administration had paid, while
Cleveland's had borrowed $262,000,000
extra and still wanted more for adminis
tration expenses.
Judge M. Cooney, president of the Re
publican Executive League, said: "This
club, as well as William McKinley, will
heartily support the Republican party's
candidate, no matter who he may be."
He hoped that the next and the two or
three succeeding administrations might be
Republican, in order that enough money
might be saved to pay off Cleveland's
debts.
Hon. Henry C. Dibble crystallized the
purpose of the meeting in this phrase:
"Division and defeat; unity and success."
He then went on to say that "since the
second coming of Cleveland values have
shrunk 20 to 30 per cent."
Hon. Frank H. Powers, Assemblyman
from the Forty-first, in the course of bis
stirring speech, said: ''The prophetic
finger of history indicates that Grover
Cleveland, like Buchanan before him, will
be tho last Democrat for twenty-four years
to warm the chair."
Jack Stevens in a jovial way denied that
he had on the evening before, as quoted
in a morning paper, said, "If ladies want
to do politics they must get in wid de
gang." He had simply remarked as he re
peated again to the women, "Fellows, be
with us; we're with you." He explained
that a gaspipe cinch is a cinch open at both
ends and that the Republicans would have
onÂ« in the next campaign if they would all
stand together.
Other speakers were Dr. Ayre, President
Stone of the Union Leaeue Club, Major
Whiteside and Benjamin Tehlemann.
The Veteran Firemen's band early sur
prised the meeting with a serenade and
followed it up with music after each speech.

It is understood that Justice White of

THE REDUCTION
OF GRAIN RATES
Attorney-General Fitzgerald
on the Commission's
Powers.
ESTIMATES NOT FAIR.
Accurate Information on Rail
road Operating Expenses
Demanded.
THEEE DAYS OF HIS ARGUMENT
Mr. Fitzgerald Has Talked Since Mon
day, and Will Continue
To-Day.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald has occu
pied three days with his argument before
Judge McKenna in the injunction suit of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
against the California Railway Commis
sion, and he will continue to-day.
Taking up the resolutions adopted by the
Railway Commission to reduce the grain
rates, the Attorney-General said that the
railroad company treated them both in
the complaint as one and indivisible. They
are separate and distinct, however, and
were adopted on different days and by
different votes. The resolution of an 8
per cent reduction in grain rates was
adopted unanimously on September 12,
and the proposed horizontal reduction of
26 per cent was adopted on September 13
by a vote of 2 to 1.
The railroad estimates of reduced rev
enue are not fair, being based on the as
sumption that the resolutions stand to
gether. If we can show that the grain
rates are reasonable, that will end the
matter, provided that we can show the
resolution of the 25 per cent horizontal re
duction to be the expression of purpose
when the Commissioners find on further
investigation that they are right.
All the averments as to the effect that
the reduced rates have on the railroad
revenue are made on the personal knowl
edge of Mr. Huntington and not informa
tion and belief.
In relation to the allegations of expendi
tures Mr. Fitzgerald held that the State
was entitled to a detailed statement, with
out which it is impossible to determine
whether the rates are reasonable or unrea
sonable. Improvements should not be
charged on the account of operating ex
penses, as was done .in the testimony be
fore the Pacific Roads Commission. The
record does not show what the operating
expenses were.
The Attorney-General returned to the
question of the validity of the leases, re
plying to Mr. Herrin's argument th"at the
roads must be treated as a system.
The Southern Pacific Company comes
into court as the agent of six Jeased roads.
It does not own these roads. The position
of the company is that if it has the right
to sue fit all it has merely the right of each
of the leased roadsâ it has nothing more
than the right to act as agent of each.
if the leases had not been made each of
these companies would have been com
pelled to resist the rates for itself. The
fact of a road being leased to the Southern
Pacific Company does not give it any new
rights.
There is no showing in the complaint
that any injustice is done to apy one of
these roads individually, nor otherwise
than as a part of the Southern Pacific sys
tem.
My contention is that the Southern Pa
cific Company represents these corpora
tions individually and not collectively any
more than if the corporations were leased
to several different parties.
Judge McKenna asked whether the
lessees must not be regarded as conveying
present title 'to the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and Mr. Fitzgerald again contended
that the lessees could not legally operate
the roads except as individual roads.
Combination of a direct nature would
have been unlawful, and by any system of
leases the combination cannot be legally
affected, though the means be indirect.
In answer to the question how the rates
are to be established under the laws of this
State, Mr. Fitzgerald said that it is by the
preparation of a schedule of rates and the
service of the schedule upon the railroad
companies. The rates go into effect
twenty days after the service of the sched
ule. The establishment of the rates is a
legislative act, not of a judicial nature.
The means are prescribed by the constitu
tion and by legislative act, and nowhere
in the constitution or the legislative act
can be found authority for the adoption
of sued a resolution as this which we are
considering. The resolution is not worth
the paper upon which it is written.
The standing of the Railway Commis
sion as a legislative body was discussed at
length, and that subject was under con
sideration at the hour of adjournment,
Mr. Fitzgerald contending that the Rail
way Commissioners, as a legislative body,
cannot be enjoined.
OUT IN SUNSHINE VALLEY
The Mechanics' Institute to Build
on Its Folsom-Street
Lot.
Sentiment Strong in Favor of Improv
ing Property and Streets in
the Districts.
In addition to a high school, a public
park, a Masonic temple and a boulevard
on Folsom street the people of Sunshine
Valley are Â«oing to have a Mechanics' Pa
vilion before the year 1897 closes.
E. A. Per.icke, the recently elected presid
ent of the Mechanics' Institute, in speak
ing of the prospects of the institute build
ing on its lot on Folsom street, said it is
tne intention of the directors to proceed
with the erection of a commodious struc
ture for the requirements of the organiza
tion just as soon as certain property lines
are straightened out.
The southeast irregular corner belongs
to John Center, who has made an offÂ°r to
sell it to the institute for about $0000. This
sum was originally the amount for which
it was bonded by David Kerr when lie was
one of the directors of the institute some
years ago, and about the time when the
Folsom-'street property was purchased by
the Mechauics' Institute at a cost of $93,000.
The interest and taxes paid upon the
money and on the realty would bring the
expenses up to about $125,000.
The bone of contention seems to be the
bed of the old Mission Creek, which is
owned by the City. To acquire this the
directors* of the Mechanics' Institute
sought to have the Supervisors, through
Mayor Sutro. deed it to the society as a
gift, inasmuch as the institute might be
considered a quasi public association. But
this oonce^ion Mayor Sutro refused to
accede to, but did agree that the property
might be sold at public auction to the
highest bidder.
This was done and it was bought by
John Center Jor $0400, since which time no
fnrttier action has been taken by the di
rectors to purchase th* entire fragment in
order to give to the institute the entire
block.
Mr. Denicke yesterday said:
We anticipate no trouble in dealing with Mr.
Center, and just as soon as he gets his title
from the City we will then be in a position to
give the building our attention. Alter we get
started we will push it along to a finish.
At the present time I could r.ot say as to the
cost, but it would be safe to say it will cost all
of $100,000. We intend to put up a first-class
building, as we will build with the intention
of not again moving.
Of course, 1 am in favor of improving the
Mission. The property-owners of Sunshine
Valley contributed by taxation more than
their share to build up this City before the
Western Addition was inhabited. lam in for
progress and improvements where they will do
the most good.
David Kerr expressed himself on the
f>roposed improvements in Sunshine Val
ey as follows:
I am glad to notice in The Call that the peo
ple out in my side are getting on some speed
LIFTING TIIE CAR THAT PINNED THE WOMAN TO THE EARTH.
now. We want not only Sunshine Valley but
the whole City. I am in for good public schools
first. Then good streets, and most assuredly a
boulevard from the end of Folsom street out
through the Mission, and ending at the south
side of Golden Gate Park. That is what the j
people want out in the valley. I am not so
pronounced about buying the cemeteries for }
park pnrposes; we might gft along without
that park: but we cannot get along without
schools and good streets.
Ex-Supervisor Micah Doane, who lives
on Twelfth street, is fully as much in favor
of the proposed improvements in the val
ley as though he was in the center of the
sunshine belt.
His ideas go still further, for he favors
the Folsom-street boulevard with two out
letsâone to the parK and one out the San
Bruno road to San Mateo. He said :
As it is now wo people who live on the south
side of Market street and who own horses have
very little use for light buggies, because we have
â¡o pleasant streets or roads to drive on. A-%>\.
again, some consideration should be given to
the young people who have taken to the bicycle.
They should have a street where they can
amuse themselves as well as to ride in to their
places of business. At all events, the San
Francisco people should wake np and put
their City in metropolitan shape and throw off
its village appearance. Don't mind a few
mills extra on taxation, but improve the
streets, build schoolhouses and beautify the
parks.
With such unanimity of sentiment in
favor of helping the enterprising residents
of Sunshine Valley a rousing attendance
may be looked for at the mass-meeting at
Guerrero and Twentietli streets next Satur
day evening.
A SILENT COMMUNITY
Deaf-Mutes Desire to Form a
Colony Somewhere in Cali
fornia.
The Strange Letter Received by the
State Board of Trade From
lowa.
Manager Filcher of the State Board of
Trade is in possession of a letter from John
J. Thompson of Corning, Adams Comity,
lowa, asking information about agricul
tural lands in this State, and where he
would suggest as the best locality for the
founding of a colony of people who intend
to raise chiefly corn and poultry.
The writer states the singular fact that
his neighbors are all deaf-mutes, and that
although they lack these two senses gen
erally supposed necessary in the acquisi
tion of wealth, they are still prosperous
and happy.
It is their desire, however, to emigrate
to a country where the soil is more prolific
and the climate more genial than it is in
lowa.
"We must be near a running stream,''
the letter states, "and on a soil specially
adapted to the raising of corn." Beside
the raising of ccrn the silent community
also contemplates gardening.
"This letter," said Mr. Filrher, "was for
warded to me by Superintendent Wilson
of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb
near Oakland. It is one of the most sin
gular communications I have ever re
ceived, and I believe there is a good deal
in it, too. A class of people of that kind
could not help doing the State good by
their industry. There are splendid locali
ties for the raising of corn and poultry
along the Sacramento and the San Joaquin
rivers.
"I have taken the matter so seriously |
that I htCve sent to the writer circulars of
the localities best suited for them, and I
have mentioned their desire to several real
estate men who will tell them- more defi
nitely as regards prices and location.
"A colony of deaf-and-dumb people
helping to develop the resources of Cali
fornia wouid be a good lesson of industry
and thrift for some who possess all their
faculties and yet allow their hands to lie
idle."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
CRUSHED BY THE FENDER
Julia Peshon Horribly Mangled
Under a Kearny-Street
Electric-Car.
THE BOARD BROKE HER BONES.
While Intoxicated She Reeled Across
the Track and Is Now Dying
in the Hospital.
The unfendered electric-car caught an
other victim yesterday afternoon, and
from appearances it seemed last night
that this latest sufferer had not long to
live.
The accident occurred on Kearny street,
between Broadway and Pacific, where a
car going down the incline mangled Julia
Peshon, an unfortunate woman of "Bar
bary Coast." The woman may be blamed
for the accident, as she was intoxicated,
but owing to the absence of a proper
fender on the electric-car she was caught
by the piece of plank hanging before the
wheels and dragged about fifty feet, while
her legs and one arm were frightfully
broken and her head battered and crushed
against the cobbles.
John Floris, a saloon-keeper on Kearny
street, opDOsite where the woman was run
down, saw her about a minute or two pre
viously to the accident coming out of a na
loon at the corner of Kearny street and
Broadway. "She was very drunk," said
Floris, "and sne seemed to be in v fight
ing humor, i took no notice -of her fur
ther until I saw her taken from beneath
the car."
Other people on the bloclc said they saw
Mrs. I'esnon stagger across the street, and
when electric-car 1112 turned round the
corner from Broadway, she shook her
clenched fist at the motorman who star
tled her with the bell.
The motorman. Henry Bauineistor, said
that the moment tie saw. her he put on the
brakes and cut off the current; at the
same time he shouted, but could do no
more. The car could not be stopped sud
denly on that grade, so it rushed against
the drunken, ge*ticulating woman and
knocked her down. After a distance of
fifty feet had been traversed the car came
to a stop, and then a crowd tipped it up,
trucks and all, on one side, while others
extracted the injured woman.
She was carried to the sidewalkfr ora the
track, where in the rolling and mangling
she had left a trail of blood. A carriage
was procured and in it the unfortunate
woman was removed to the City Receiv
ing Hospital. Drs. Burrell and Rinne
examined the wounds and said that she
had sustained two fractures of both legs
and fractures of the right arm and severe
wounds of the scalp, ears and chin. She
was removed to the City and County Hos
pital in the afternoon.
Baumeister surrendered himself and was
released on his own recognizance by Judge
Low, after being charged with battt-ry. He
said that the woman staggered upon the
track an<i defied him. lie was powerless
'to stop the car ai.d at that point it was
impossible to do anything to save her.
This occurrence is the third serious ac
cident on the new electric iine within a
block of Kearny and Broadway. It was
the wooden bar that saved the victim from
being killed outright, though it did crush
her horribly. Quite recently Manager Vin
ing of the streetcar company stated that
the plain board "fender, as he called it,
was the best he could find anywhere.

A report was read from the special com
mittee on street-sprinkling, consisting of
Messrs. Fusenot,Keil and kohlberg.recom
mending a special meeting of the associa
tion, to be called at an eariy date, to
which should be invited those engaged in
sprinkling the street?, and also the Street
Committee of the Board of Supervisors.
The directors decided accordingly that*
special meeting of the association should
be called at Assembly Hall, Mills building,
April 2. at 3:30 p. m.
In the matter of the directory for the
new City Hall, the report of the action of
the Board of Supervisors in authorizing
the merchants to place the . directory
throughout the ball at an expense of $12:3
was read. The committee also called the
attention of the board to the objections to
this made by the City Hall Commission
ers, and it was decided that a communica
tion be at once forwarded to the City Hall
Commissioners, asking them to state what
objections they may have to such an un
dertaking.
The association is trying to devise some
means by which the sweeping of the
street may be hauled to the park until the
electric roads are in such condition that
they may do this work. The park has not
received any of these sweepings since the
spur track was removed from it. The as
sociation is also endeavoring to secure the
use of a vacant lot in the Western Addi
tion located so that the sweepings may be
hauled there by the present contractors
and afterward hauled from this lot to the
park by the Park Commissioners at their
expense.
A letter from Ernest Adam, engineer in
charge of street and sewer work of Mewark,
N. J., was read. It stated that streets
there were cleaned for twenty-live cents a
mile, the average width of the streets
being thirty-six feet, and the bulk of the
work being done by sweeping-machines.
The city of Newark laid nearly a million
dollars worth of paving and Built 67,800
feet of sewers in the past year.
A communication was read from W. J.
Pollard of the Citizens' League, New
Orleans, desiring that the association for
ward a cop^Wf the new City Charter, as
New Orleans proposed to get a new charter
also.
H. M. Wooley sent a communication in
the interest of the WiimerdiiiK school site,
which was referred to a special committee.
Mr. Wooley stated that tho present status
of the matter was that Oakland, Alameda,
Berkeley, Stockton and San Jose have
raised purses lor the buying of certain Jots
and have offered any lots the Board of
Itepents might select".
So far the choice of the regents has been
a tract of land lying between Oakland and
Berkeley, known, as "Ayala Park," as re
ported by their committee on sites.
In the course of several interviews with
some of the regents of the university,
while seeking to advance the interests of
San Francisco, he has^learneo that the only
way for this City to gain the Wihuerding
School will be for the active public-spirited
citizens here to take the matter in hand,
as the men of Oakland and other places
have done, and raise a purse and buy a
bloct that will suit the regents.
Some four or rive sites have been offered
to the regents for this school, at prices rang
ing from $60,000 to $100,000 each, that would
suit them for this purpose if bought and
presented to them. Now the amount nec
essary for the purchase of one of these
blocks could be raised inside of thirty days
from the time the work was becun.
The writer closed, saying:
As soon as you take the matter in hand you
will find that you will be aided by every news
paper in the City both by handsome cash sub
scriptions and )>y their columns. This is not
mere supposition on my part, tor 1 have the
promise of substantial aid from one or two of
the leading papers of the City, in addition
you will have the assistance of ihe Mechanics'
institute, the Chamber of Commerce, the Board
of Trade and other representative and influen
tial bodies who are already interested iii this
matter.
OGSBURY'S SAD FAMILY.
A I. os Angeles Printer Who Loat His
Fortune in Arizona.
A sad case of destitution was reportrd
yesterday to the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children. Mrs. Laura
SOME OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE WONG SAM CASE.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
Ogsbury, living at 105 Stockton street,
room 76, was said by a neighbor to be
without any means of subsistence for her
self and her two young children.
When the case was investigated Mrs.
Ogsbury was found to be a very superior
woman, whose husband had formerly been
a printer in comfortable circumstances at
Los Angeles. He had invested ail his
savings in a mining town in Arizona, and,
the mines having petered out, his prop
erty became worthless. The family re
moved to tins City where, in spite of all
his efforts, the husband was unable to get
work. Last Monday he left for Cripple
Creek on the promise of securing employ
ment. He took two of the children with
him. but had nothing to leave for the rest
of the family.
The Associated Charities, when General
McComb reported the case, provided yes
terday for the immediate necessities of
Mrs. Ogsbury and her children.
Louis* Sternberg's Case.
The case of Louis Sternberg, charged with
falsely registering David Newman, went over
until Tuesday next on account of the absence
of David Newman and Samuel Newman, the
principal witnesses. Bench warrants %vere is
sued for their arrest by Judge Wallace. The
case is the one reversed by the Supreme Court
& short time ago.

WONG SAM A HIGHBINDER
He Was Once Quite Prominent
in the Hop Sing
Society.
THE CUSTOM-HOUSE SCANDAL.
Charges That Loui Quong Had Dong
Sun Yet Photographed in a
Chinatown Gallery.
Wong Sam took the witness-stand and
briefly told the story of his life in United
States Commissioner Heacock's court yes
terday. He is a very ugly-looking Celes
tial, but an exceptionally bright one. His
English is remarkably clear. It was in
that tongue that he related his connection
with the landing of Dong Sun Yet, the
pretty Chinese girl brought here to follow
a life of shame in Chinatown, but res-cued
by the missionaries and now held by the
customs authorities pending deportation.
Wong Sara is foxy and therefore a dan
gerous fellow. For years he has prowled
about the Custom-house, hobnobbed with
attaches of the Chinese Bureau, trafficked
.in slave girls and grown rich and powerful.
Therefore he was once regarded as a dan
gerous person to toy with and the Custom
house ring set out to destroy him ; but
Sam is still very much alive and will figure
as the chief witness against "Dick" Wil
liams, the inspector now under the ban of
the Treasury Department, and whose con
nection with certain alleged irregular
transactions is being inquired into by the
United States Grand Jury now in ses.-iun.
The startling testimony which Attorney
Dibble, for the defense, secured was to the
effect that Dong Sun Yet had had two sets
of photographs taken â one in China and
the ether in this City. This fact was
pretty clearly established by the evidence
of profe>sional photographers, who gave it
as their opinion that ihe paper used in the
Chinese print was never employed by
photographers in this country. William
Shew, the Kearny-street photographer,
testified to this effect. Gee Chong Poo, a
Chines* photographer, gave similar evi
dence, and these were also the statements
of two Chinese who had teen Loui Quong,
interpreter of the Chinese Bureau, tane
Doni; Sun Yet into a photograph gallery in
Chinatown.
Wong Ngow testified that Jew Shee or
Fai Ho had told him she did not get the
picture from Wong. Sam, but that a white
ooy had given it to her. This is the picture
supposed to have been taken in China
town.
Wong Sam testified that he had lived in
this country twenty-six years. He had at
different times conducted stores at Port
lund, Or., Tucson, Ariz., and at Los An
geles. He said that he had nothing to do
with bringine Dong Sun Yet to this coun
try. He liad not been at the Mail dock in
sixteen months, and therefore could not
have been at the steamer to meet the girl.
He had heard the testimony of the wit
nesses charging him with importing the
woman in' question, but he entered an
emphatic denial of all ihe evidence that in
any way implicated him. He saia he had
j been threatened by "Dick" Williams, but
j the court ruled this* evidence out.
Attorney Mowry conducte I the cross
| examination for the prosecution. He
J asked Sain if he did not belong to the Hop
| Sine Highbinder Society at one time.
"Seventeen years ago," replied the wit
; ness, "1 was tie interpreter of the Hop
i Sing Society, when you (addressing the
i attorney) were a member of it. You were
j the attorney."
This society was broken up by the
police. District Attorney iSles-singer
thought it advisable not to go into the
character of the witness and no further
questions in this direction were asked.
" Collector Wise is taking a very active
I interest in the prosecution of Wong Sam,
bui Special Agent Moore, who is stiil hunt
ing up evidence against Williams, remains
away. The examination will be continued
to-day.
The Lnrgent American Male.
The largest mule that ever walked on
American soil is now, or was recently, the
property of one George H. Johnson, a
farmer living a few miles east of Honey
Grove, Tex. His nmleship is exactly 18%
hands, or 6 feet 2 inches in height, being
exactly 7% inches higher than the famous
Los Pecos (old Mexico) mule, which was
so widely advertised in 1890-91 as being
"the most gigantic specimen of the mule
family the world has ever known." The
Honey Grove mule is not slim and raw
boned, but is built in proportion to his
height, weighing 16.9 pounds.

SALMON ARE INCREASING
Report of the Fish Commission
Shows a Growth of the
Industry.
Fresh-Water Fish Transplanted From
the East Have Done Remark
ab'y Well.
Secretary Babcock of the State Fish
Commission has prepared the annual re
port of the commission for the year
18JH-95, showing an interesting array of
figures, from which the amount of fish
taken from the rivers of the State in the
past year over the year previous ia shown
to be exceedingly in excess.
The report was prepared directly from
the books of the wholesale firms who keep
such accounts in the City. Of the sixteen
firms who deal by wholesale only two have
no records to show the amount of fish re
ceived.
The statement of salmon handled in
pounds shows that in spite of the enor
mous gain in salmon fishing this year tins
variety is on the increase in the Sacra
mento River.
In 1893 2,453,446 pounds were taken ; in
1894 2,554,609 pounds, and in 1895 2,713,453
pounds, showing a gain in 1895 ot 108,849
pounds over 1894, and this even though
the open season of 1895 was one month
less than the year before.
If 413,340, the amount taken in the same
month of 1894, were added to Ihe excess in
1895, it would show 562,189 pounds as an
increase over 1894, showing also that the
efforts of the commission are meeting with
excellent success.
Striped bass show a very great increase.
They were first introduced in 1879, then
150 fingerlings wtre put into the San Joa
quin Kiver." The amount taken in 1895
was 252,177 pounds. The striped bass is
now one of the most desirable fish in the
San FranciÂ«co market, and is sold as
cheap here in every month in the year as
in the New York markets.
Shaa. carp and cattish show a falling off
on the dealers' books in the last two years
for the reason that now the majority of
these tish are taken from the San Fran
cisco and San Pablo bays and are sold for
spot cash .at Fisherman's wharf. As a
consequence no entry is made on the
book?, although Mr. Babcock is certain
that the amount taken from the waters
compares favorably with previous years.
The totals for the four varieties of fish
is as follows:
Striped bassâ lÃ93, 79,738 pounds: 1894,
144,754 pounds; 1895,252.177 pounds.
Shadâ lÃ93, 405,391 pound?; 1894, 2(59,379
pounds; 1895, 146,399 pounds.
Carp â 1893, 33,084 pounds; 1894, 42,580
pounds; 1895, 2G.8G4 pounds.
Cattishâ lÃ93. 30.544 pounds; 1894,31,465
pounds; 1895, 32,282 pounds.

The difficulties encountered recently by

When about to present himself for the I

informed by the mast? r of ceremonies that '
a wig was a sine qua non. Now, his head 'â

begin to fit it, and the situation was
embarrassing in â¢ the extreme How- ;

large to pass him through the |
antechamber?, after which he was per

D. M. DELMAS' SOLITARY FIGHT.
Proceedings Under the First Will
â¢ Stopped and a Vital Point
Gained.
Attorney D. M. Delmas sent his voice
echoing through Judge Siack's courtroom
with no uncertain sound yesterday morn
ing, and succeeded in giving a new turn to
the rather winding course of things in the
Fair will ca3e.
A number of routine matters took up
the attention of the court during the early
part of the morning session, and it was
after 11 o'clock before Judge Slack was
able to take up the case in which so many
millions are involved. At the invitation
of the court Mr. Delmas first proceeded to
state his position.
He said in substance:
The matter for discussion this morning is as
to the method of procedure, namely, whether
the will represented here by Messrs. Pierson
nnd McEnexney, is entitled to be probated ex
parte, or -whether in view of the fact that there
is pending an application and a petition for
the probate of a will purporting to be of later
date, the two proceedings must be heard to
gether and both be disposed of before a judg
ment or order is entered. I understand that to
be the condition of the discussion.
The court â I tnlnk that is correct. The pro
ponents of the will of September 21 insist upon
going on, and your position is
that you have trie right of way.
Mr. Delmasâ There is a petition filed on the
18th of March, 1895, by the three children of
the decedent asking for the probate of the will
which I shall denominate the will of the 24th.
There i 6 also a petition filed on the 25th of
March, 1895, by Marc Levingston, one of the
executors named in the will of the 24th. To
the petition of the children asking for the pro
bate of the will of the 24th a contest was filed
by certain minors represented by Judge Pater
eon, and to that content a demurrer has been
interposed by the children, on the ground that
as to Herman Oelrichs Jr. the provisions of the
will which would give him a standing in court,
â which is the trust clause, so-called, of the will
of the 21st, are null, and therefore he takes
nothing, and has no standing to contest the
will of the 24th. To the petition of Marc Lev
ingston a contest has been Interposed by the
same minors, and to that contest an answer
has been filed. Certain other parties, legatees
represented by Mr. Percy, have also filed a con
test to the petition or to the will presented by
the petition of Marc Levingston, and to that
contest a demurrer has been interposed, which
demurrer has been sustained and time given
to amend. The time to amend, or file an
amended contest or take such other action as
may be deemed prcper, has been extended, as
I understand, and expires to-day.
Your Honor has stated in the remarks which
were made heTe, as reported to me, this whole
matter very succinctly â placed that whole ques
tion really in a nutsnell. I refer to page 53 of
these notes, where your Honor is reported to
have said: "It may be necessary, after all, to
proceed with the will of the 24th, and if that
is sustained of course the will of the 21st
should not be admitted to probate. On the
other hand, ii the will of the 24th is found to
be Invalid for the reasons urged in the contest
to that will, then the will of the 21st might
have to be taken up for probate."
That, if your Honor please, is exactly the
condition of the law and the rule of procedure
as we understand it. The will of the 21st was
presented some time in December, 1894, or in
the beginning of January, 1895. That will
was offered for probate by the four executors
and trustees named in it. Matters remained in
etatu quo t>o far as taking any steps toward
the probate are concerned until the 18th of
March, when the will of the 24tb wrs offered
for probate by the tnree children of the dece
dent. On the 25th of March the probate was
again petitioned for by Marc Levingston,
one of the executors named in that will.
Kow. not long after that the petitioners
for the probate of the will of the 21st urged
that will forward and demanded action to be
taken upcn it, claiming that they had a right
to bo heard, they being first in point of time
in court. That was opposed by the children,
the petitioners of the willof the 24th, and they
then made a motion to drop the petition and
the proceedings inaugurated thereby for the
probate of the will of the 21st; and there, as I
numbly submit and conceive the first wrong
step was taken in these matters. It was not
right to ask to have a petition, which was
properly before the court asking for probate of
a will, which was claimed to be the last will
to be dropped from the calander, because that
Detition was the thing which gave this court
jurisdiction of the Fair estate. That
was the fountain of all subsequent power
and of all subsequent duties to be
discharged by this court. Whoever came in
after that petition, but came in in answer to
ths citation which had been issued to the
whole world, this being a proceeding in rem,
to come forward and either affirmatively ap
prove of the proceedings sought to be inaugu
rated by the petition or to oppose it; and
whoever came in after that citation presenting
ar.vthing which could show that the facts
stated in that petition were not true would
come in response to the summons of the court,
submitting himself to the original jurisdic
tion Inaugurated and set in motion by the
original petition.
Now, when that petition was filed your
Honor' acquired jurisdiction of the estate of
the decedent, with power to hear and deter
mine all questions incident to its administra
tion In the -first place, was the decedent
really a decedentâ was James G. Fair dead ?
You had a right to inquire and be informed of
that fact; that was the first step in the line of
orderly procedure. If you solved that ques
tion in the affirmative the next question was,
did he die testate or intestate ? You solved
that question one way or the other, and if you
determined that he died testate the next ques
tion was, not merely, Is this paper which
is now presented his will, but what
is his will ? What is his will ? Any
body had a right to cone in and be heard upon
that inquiry. If he left a willâ which you de
termined by the fact that he died testateâ the
next question was, What is his will ? What is
it composed of ? It might be composed of one
paper, or it might be composed of many pa
pers. The testamentary disposition might be
fragmentary, one part tound in a document
executed at one time, one part found in a doc
ument executed at another time, and one part
round in a document still further on. You
"would take all these documents together,
whatever was presented or had the appear
ance and form of a testamentary disposition,
piecing them together, if necessary; giving
them one by the other, if necessary, and from
the whole mass presented you would deter
mine what was the will of the decedent.
There can be no question upon that point.
As I stated in my argument before, it is not
possible, in the nature of rational jurispru
dence, that because the holder of one paper
which is testamentary in its character shall
with indecent haste present itself to the
Clerk's office one moment after the testator has
expired, that be therefore acquires a para
mount fight in court over the man who, with
greater decency, has waited until at least the
ashes are cold before he has acted. What would
your Honor do, or what would counsel do, sup
pose a man had held both of these wills in his
â possession, and not knowing which was in
point of law the last will had come into court,
had filed a joint petition asking for the probate
of both or either, as the court might
determine? What would your Honor dc if the
petitioners for the will of"the 24th had been
equally' eager and prompt with the petitioners
of the will of the 21st, and had entered the
Clerk's office simultaneously; and had simul
taneously filed their petition? What would
you do then? Why, you would simply say,
which is the most convenient way? And what
is law but the ministerof convenience?
I have stated here in the argument which I
made before upon the contest filed by Dr. Lev
ingsion to the will of the 21stâ that is. the
formal grounds of contest to that willâ that I
did not deem such a mode of procedure neces
sary or evan proper, but your Honor had indi
cated in an opinion filed here on tne sth of
May that that was the mode of procedure. Out
of deference to your Honor's opinion I en
deavored to follow it. Your Honor determined
that the contestants had, under the law, no
legal right to contest, and therefore disposed
of that matter without passing even inci
dentally upon the proper mode of procedure.
But that contestant, or at least that person
who sought to file that formal contest, has in
this case side by side with the petition of the
children of the 'decedent his own petition for
the probate of this will. You will near that at
some time. When? If he had filed that peti
tion firstâ if he had been at the Clerk's office
on the morning after the testator's death and

{From a sketch made by a "Call" artist.]
presented that will or that petitionâ would he
be entitled to be heard without these parties
who claim and have proclaimed here with
some emphRSJ3 that tnat will is a forgery?
Would they not be entitled to be heard upon
that subject, they claiming under a will which,
! though earlier in point of time, would be the
I last will if the other one was what they de-
I clared it. to beâ spurious? Beyond all question
that must be so. And, as I say, it is not possi
ble that by merely being first in the Cierk's
office the "parties iiid acquire a right of way
over everybody else, and that their proceed
ings must culminate and go to an end,
although they have cited the world to appear
and show cause why their proceeding or their
will should not be probated.
We are contestants nere of the will of the
21st, because in that paper which we filed we
affirmed that this is not the last will, that the
will of the 24th is the last will. We are thus
affirming contradictory propositions, each con
testing the other's position. They are con
testants of our will. We are contestants of
theirs.
In the report of the estate of Horace Greeley,
where the facts are similar to these, the New
York court statedâ contrary to what your
Honor has held hereâ that the executor has
the right to carry on the contest against the
will; in other words, that the very fact that
the executor of the will of 1871 had a right to
claim that that was the last will, the face that
he had a right to affirm that proposition of
I necessity involved the right to deny that some
other will was the last will, because the affirm
ation of one was necessarily a negation of the
other.
The Court â I suppose, Mr. Delmas, you have
not overlooked the reasoning of the court
there, have you, which is to the effect that the
executor becomes vested with the legal estate,
the testator's personal estate, and therefore
has an interest in the property?
Mr Delmasâ ls it not so in our State? Does
not the same rule apply here?
The Courtâ l have always understood differ
ently.
.Mr. Delmasâ The decisions are the other way.
I had supposed that that was the point of dis
tinction, though, it was not pointed out in the
argument, nothing was said about that, but I
conjectured, because if this case is law, if it is
correctly decided, it must rule the present
case,
The Courtâ l don't think it is necessary to
argue further upon that particular point. I
believe that I did state in the oral opinion
given here that if the question were a new
question, if it were not, I take it, controlled by
authorities in this State the other way, I
should feel disposed to yield to those New
York cases, and allow the executor to fiie a
formal contest; but not only once, but three
times, has the Supreme Court of this State de
cided that an interest in the fees of adminis
tration do not constitute a sufficient interest.
Now, I may be wrong in my interpretation of
those cases, but I feel bound by them as I un
derstand them.
Mr. Delmasâ l am not endeavoring, if yonr
Honor please, in any manner to question the
correctness of your Honor's conclusion reached
upon the contest. That has been decided, and
I was merely answering your Honor's query,
calling my attention to the fact that in that
case the decision was based, to some extent,
upon the proposition that the title to the per
sonalty descended to the executor.
The Courtâ l don't place so much importance
upon that. I think that the mere right, what
ever I should hold, if I were not controlled by
the three cases in this State, that the mere
right to propound a will gives a right to con
test another will that is on file; but the Su
preme Court, I take it, has held otherwise, and
until they overrule these cases I must follow
them.
Mr. Delmasâ l am not undertaking to ques
tion those cases, but I merely undertook to
call your attention to this passage, which is
indeed the one that the case culminates in:
"The executors named in the will of 1871 have
clearly, by statute, an express right to have
that will proved, if they can establish the fact
that it is the last will." Is it not so here? The
executor of the will of the 24th has
by statute the right, Indeed, it is
mado his duty to propound that will
for prooate, to petition for its probate,
and they have a right to maintain that will.
I continue: "If they can establish the fact
that it is the last will." Now the right to go
to a certain place certainly involves the right
to remove from your path the obstacles that
obstruct your road to that place. If I have a
right to go from my front gate to my house I
certainly have s right to remove from the
avenue that leads from the gate to the house
any impediment that some person unlawfully
may have placed upon my property. If the
petitioners lor the probate of the will of the
24th have a right to have thai will probated, if
they can establish it to be the last will, they
necessarily have the right to overthrow every
adversary who contends that it is not the last
will, but that something cisc is the last will.
Now, whether you call that a contest or
whether you say mat that is a right springing
from the power and duty of petitioning, is a
mere discussion about words of no great im
portance.
The executors propounding the will of the
24th had a right and duty to apply for its pro
bate. They have a right to prove the allega
tions of the petition which they have filed for
its probate. One of those petitioning allega
tions is that that is the last will and that noth
ing else therefore is the last will. If anybody
steps into the arena and contests and claims
that something else is the last will they there
by become antagonists, and, of course, a con
test, a legal contest, that is, a legal discussion,
takes place between them, to be waged by
every legal implement and weapon as to who
is right.
One more remark and twill leave this sub
ject, because I cannot but believe from the re
marks made by your Honor on last Monday
that while not involved in the opinion which
you rendered it had undergone considerable
examination and discussion at your Honor's
hands. Suppose that the will of the 21st had
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
been admitted to probate early in January of
last year, nobody at that time dreaming, I sup
pose, that there was any later will; supposing:
tl<e will of the 24th had been subsequently
discovered, what would the parties claiming
under that will have had to do? They would
have brought that will into court and they
would have asked for its probate. If anybody
objected to the probate, after due notice, they
would have come in and filed their contest of
that will, together with the application for the
probate of the later will; there would have
been a prayer that the probate of the for
mer will be revoked. What would your
Honor have done in the method of procedure
at that point? Tiie holders of the probate of
the will of the 21st, would have come into
court and would have said to your Honor,
probably, "Does not the statute Fay that when
probate is granted of a will, it is conclusive
against the whole world until set aside? There
fore, you cannot set up a later will until you
have set aside the probate of the former will."
To that would have been replied, "But the in
strument by which we propose to set aside the
probate of the former will is, itself, a will,
which has no validity until it is probated. And
if you say we must tirst set aside your probate,
before we can probate our will, and then say
that we can't attack your probate until we
have probated our will, you are whirling us in
a vicious circle without beginning or end."
The courts of New York have solved that dif
ficulty in a very simple way, for whenever in
those courtsâ and I cited "to your Honor the
authorities â whenever in those courts the
later will is offered for probate, which pur
ports to revoke a former will which has been
probated, if the court believes in the good
faith of the application it enters an order in its
minutes, an order nisi setting aside the pro
bate of, the former will, conditioned that if
Drobate be granted to the later will the rule or
the order becomes absolute, but if probate be
denied to the later will then the rule or the
order expires at that point, and the former
probate is revived.
I especially call your Honor's attention in
this matter to the authorities in New York, and
to the very case that was cited in response to
the contention that the first petition should be
dropued from the calendar, which is a case in
the one hundred and seventeenth Indiana. I
think, and the case of Vance vs. Upson, which
is in the Texas Reportsâ in the sixty-fourth, it
I mistake not. This Whetton matter, if your
Honor please, I suppose you are familiar with.
That case, in the matter of the estate of Whet
ton, is found at page 203, Ninety-eighth Cali
fornia, and I reaa from page 204 the opinion
of Mr. Justice Garoutte, concurred in by Mr.
Justice Paterson and Mr. Justice Harrison.
The la"st sentence it: "While it has been held
in many cases that an administrator cannot ap
peai from a decree of distribution because he has
no interest in the tinai judgment, whatever it
may be, yet that principle is in no sense
analogous to the right of an executor to sup
port a will, especially so when it has been once
probated." The executor has no right to sup
port the will. That right may become more
binding upon him, because he may feel 6urer
of his ground when the will has been probated,
out the right to support the will which nomi
nates him as executor is as perfect before as it
is after probate. He has the right to support
it and in supporting it of course he has the
right to repel all attacks, which would over
throw it.
In reply Mr. Pierson "contended that
there was no reason for going out of Cali
fornia to look for citations. In his concep
tion the better course would be to^eek for
precedents In the reports of cases decided
in accordance with the statutes governing
such matters in this i^tate. Other States,
ne said, had laws, in many instances
widely variant from those of California;
and hence decisions rendered in the courts
of those States were not always to be taken
as final in courts here.
Regarding the matter of the two wills,
Mr. Pierson was very emphatic in insist
ing that the court had no option as to the
admission of the â willof September 21, 1894.
On tDe ex parte proof already submitted,
lie contended that that will, though not
the last made by the testator, was in view
of the rulings of the court undoubtedly
entitled to be admitted to probate.
Garret McEnerney, representing Trus
tee Goodfellow, one of the executors of the
will of the 21st of September, concurred in
Mr. Pierson'a view, citing a number of
California cases in support of that posi
tion.
Judge Slack then rendered his decision
as follows:
I have examined all those authorities last
evening. They were all cited on the argument
that took piace here oil another occasion. I
am conversant with the case of Hathaway's
will, in 4 Ohio St., because I examined it last
evening; and also with the case from 33 Ala
bama, Blakely vs. Blakely'B heirs. I think I
cftn give my decision now. gentlemen, without
calling upon Mr. Delmas further in the matter.
As I say, I have examined all of the authori
ties that have been cited by counsel upon the
previous occasion when this question was pre
sented, and the authorities that were cited the
other day, I have taken great pains to go over
them also. I have also taken the pains to ex
amine further for myself, to some extent, that
is, to make an independent examination,
and I find that counsel have gone
over the ground so thoroughly, that there is
no authority one way or the other to be found,
except it is in Schouler's executors, and pos
sibly counsel have found that also, but have
not referred to it, because the only authority
which that author cites is not decisive, or does
scarcely support his proposition. The au
thor in section 71 says that "contests may
arise over the probate of conflicting testament- '
ary papers, each of which has been propounded
as the instrument truly entitled to probate.
Hero the object being to ascertain which, if
either or any of them, embodies in testament
ary form the last wishes of the deceased, proof
of the instrument of latest date comes first in
order. A similar rule applies where the va
lidity of particular codicils is in dispute." As
I say the only authority which he cites in sunr
port of that proposition is that of Lister, vs.
Smith, 3 Sw.abey and Tristam,s3. However,
It is hardly supported there.
Counsel very well know that this court ; upon
the other occasion when the question was pre
sented, expressed its views to the effect that a
formal contest should be filed to the applica
tion to admit the will of September 21 to pro
bate, or else the court intimated it would pro
ceed to hear the application. Upon locflclns:
over %vhat transpired in those proceedings, I
find that the main que3iion that was argued
was the question as to striking frojr the calen
dar the proceedings relative to the prcoate of
the will of September 21. The ollii qrQftion
was not elaborately argued. It is t nc that,
some of the authorities recently cited, were
cited upon that occasion, but only a few of
them, apparently. It seems to me that the pro
ponents of the will of September 21 overlook
the fact that the filing of the will of September
24 is "in a measure a contestâ not perhaps a
contest in the sense in which this term is used
in the code. An opposition would be the more
correct term to use.
The will purporting to be executed on Sep
tember 24 was filed in the same proceedings in
which the will of September 21 was filed. It
would seem to me that the duty of the court
in the premises, independently of any sug
gestion from counsel, is to proceed with the
hearing of the application to admit to probate
the will of later date, as being the orderly and
correct mode of procedure. As suggested In
the case of Hamilton's will, in 2 Connelly's
reports, a case to which I think the court dia
not give sufficient consideration when the
matter was up before, if a will of earlier date
is admitted to probate and a will of later date
is filed, it is the duty of the court to enter an
order revoking the probate which has been
granted the earlier will, unless the probate of
the later will is denied. That is the pro
cedure that is Indicated there. It is true
it was not necessary for the court to express
itself in the terms in which it did exprejse itself,
but it seems that that is the procedure where a
will of earlier date is admitted to probate.
That certainly is the proper procedure, to pro
ceed with the will of later date when the will
of earlier date has not at all been admitted to
.probate.
Suppose I should admit to probate the will of
be -Ist upon the argument tiiut has been had,
the orderly method of procedure, as suggested
in that case, is to enter an order, as Mr. Delmas
says, in order nisi, which is virtually revoking
what I have already done, conditionally, or
course, upon the application of the will of later
date being successful.
These conclusions do not in any way inter
fere with the proposition advanced by Mr.
Pierson a moment ago that Dr. Marc Lev
ingston is not entitled to be heard upon the
application to admit to probate the will of the
21st. He is not a party to that proceeding,
and is not entitled to bring forward any cvi.
dence in regard to the validity of that will.
But he is entitled -to have a hearing upon the
will which he propounds which has been con
tested; and it seems to me, for the reason that
I have given, that the only proper method of
procedure is to hear and determine that ap
plication. If the application is suc
cessful, then the will of the 21st is
out of the way, it falls; *if the
application is unsuccessful, this court will
proceed immediately, 1 take it, to hear the ap
plication of the wj}l of September 21. And
upon that proceeding, as the court is presently
advised, Dr. Marc Levingston, and no one else
who has not contested or filed a proper con
test to the will of the 21st, is entitled to be
heard.
Tho evidence has already been introduced.
I suppose no further evidence will be intro
duced to support the will of the 21st of Sep
tember. I will simply continue the matter
until the issues as to the will of September 24
have been determined by this court.
Ex-Judge Paterson at the opening of
the afternoon session requested that the
stenographic report of the murning's pro
ceedings be read to him. as he had been
called out of court before the decision was
rendered and did not wish to make any
move in the case until after he had learned
what had been done. His request was
granted, and, having heard the reading of
the report, he offered to submit his de
murrer to the probate of the will of Sep
tember 24 without argument.
To this Mr. Delmas replied that with
the demurrers interposed by the children
to the 'contests to their petition he had
nothing to do, but there was no* demurrer
to the contest to the petition of Dr.
Levingston. The doctor, he continued,
had answered the contest ana had de
manded, a jury trial of the issues thus
joined.
In this answer he accepted the terms
and the ground of battle offered by ex-
Judge Pa'.erson. It was alleged in the
contest that that gentleman had a legal
capacity to sue, and this averment was
admitted. It was further alleged that the
minors represented by Mr. Paterson were
beneficially interested and therefore enti
tled to contest. This was also admitted by
the answer.
In deference to the wishes of counsel an
adjournment was taken until this morn
ing, when the right will be taken up again
and carried on with what promises to be
no small degree of spirit on all sides.
SCORES LAMOUREAUX.
Julian Sonntag: Says the Miners Never
.Expect to Get Any Benefit at
His Hands.
Tirey L. Ford telegraphed yesterday to
Julian Sonntag of the Miners' Association
that matters look very favorably in Wash
ington to a passage of the mineral land
bill now pending in Congress.
"The Chamber of Commerce," said Mr.
Sonntag yesterday, speaking of affairs in
Washington, "has sent word to Representa
tive Herman urging him to do all in his
power toward aiding the passage of the
river and harbor bill, and private and
individual dispatches from prominent men
of this State have recently been sent with
the same purport.
"The miners of this State are looking with
deep concern on the attitude of Senators
Mitchell of Oregon and Stewart of Nevada.
If these Senators should interfere with the
passage of the mineral lands oil', they
will be met by the Senators from Califor
nia.
"The bill," said Mr. Sonntag, "has re
ceived the undivided support of the whole
California delegation â White, Perkins,
Kilborn, McLachlan, Barhain,'Maguire,
Loud, Johnson and Bowers â and it has
never been known in the history of this
State where a delegation have worked with
6O much unanimity of feeling.
"The bill has also received the indorse
ment of all the large commercial bodies of
the State. They all recognize that if it
passes it will redound millions of dollars to
the advantage of California.
"In Commissioner Lamoureaux weplac9
no faith. He showed his hand when he
granted for patent to the railroad com
pany over 260,000 acres of land during the
past few days. He is without doubt op
posed to every interest of the miners, and
the miners of this State never expect to re
ceive any benefit or even get their rights
at his hands."
A STANFORD CONCERT.
Good Musicale Given by the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs.
A good concert was given last night in
Metropolitan Temple by the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin clubs, which are start
ing out on their annual tour.
The work done by the Glee Club, accom
panied by the Mandolin Club, was the
most interesting feature of the contest.
The two organizations blended excel
lently, while the rhythm and shading of
the vocalists and of the strings accompany
ing them were absolutely one. "Estu
diantina" and "Ma Angelini" were the
two selections rendered by the Glee and
Mandolin clubs together, and both were
charmingly performed. Although the
latter came last on the programme the
audience refused to depart till it had been
repeated.
Both; the Glee and Mandolin clubs did
good work on their own account. The
former's sinking was smooth and easy and
was markedly plenty of expression. The
rendering of ''Courtship" brought the Glee
Club a warm encore, to which the boys re
sponded by singing that touching and
effective ditty, "Pa's Baby Boy." "Wing
Tee Wee," "Phyllis Dyes Her Tresses
Black," and a good medley of college songs
were also well rendered.
The Mandolin Club, which played grace
fully and prettily, gave among other selec
tions the "Stanford University March," a
clever and effective little composition by a
member of the club named Kaufman.
Philip F. Abbott, the barytone soloist of
the college organization, sang a cavatina
from "Faust" so acceptably that he re
ceived an encore, to which he responded
by giving Rubinstein's "Azra." Charles
L". Dillon, the college humorist, took im
mensely with the audience, both as a
singer of comic songs and a reciter of hu
morous stories.

A WIFE'S NUMEROUS DEATHS.
Six Starving Children as a Plea for
Almsâ A Railroad Accident
and the Dollar.
The Associated Charities, that make it
their business to investigate and list all
cases of want brought to their attention,
complain of an imposter who is going
about the City with a pitiful tale of his re
cently deceased wife and his starving little
ones.
Many times during the last three years
the mythical -poor wife has died to order
and the motherless waifs have continued
to cling persistently to life after being re
peatedly at death's door, with a stereo
typed starvation staring into their pinched
and emaciated little faces. But the soli
citous father has persistently struggled on
under his burden of sorrow, varying his
story, his name and his address as he has
appealed to the sympathies of different
benevolently inclined individuals.
Sometimes he is Ward, sometimes he is
Martin, sometimes he is Wilson, but under
whatever name he poses he shuns chari
table societies in a nice esthetic way that
shows a disposition not to make any sys
tematic organization a party to his per
sonal troubles.
Speaking of the case yesterday Mrs. A.
W. Flint, the. registrar of the Associated
Charities, 601 Commercial street, said:
"He is a perfect fraud and his long con
tinued operations would seem to indicate
that he ha 3 been successful in imposing
upon private persons. He takes good care
to avoid us and our investigations, but
from time to time we have had .occasion
to look him up, as people have called oar
attention to him as a lit subject for aid. S
"Once I remember he applied to Miss
Culberison at the Chinese Mission, and she
telephoned to us. Every address he gave
when followed up has been found to be
fictitious. About two years ago he went to
MiJlen Griffiths and stated that he had a
son at the Fourth and Townsend station, a
consumptive, whom he had brought that
far but had no money to remove tiim and
care for his critical case. The society's
man went down there, but found no evi
dence of any such sick man.
"Again we heard of him as living at 615
Sixth street, in Scott <fc McCorU's hay
barns, with his six little children; his wife
had just been buried. He has told his
story to Mrs. A. N. Drowu, to tbe Society
of Christian Work, to Mrs. Darville Libbe
of the Second Unitarian Church, and to
several persons that I do not recall.
"He told Mrs. O. W. Briggs that his wife
had just died and that he and his four
children â one a paralytic â were starving.
He declared that he hud been a major in
the United States army, and that assertion
at once aroused Mrs. Brings' particular
sympathy. The address he gave then
was 423j/ 2 Vallejo street. We investigated
it and tound two very respectable families
living there and no information whatever
about the man and his children.
"On another occasion he gave the name
James Wilson, said he lived on 428 Six
teenth street; tliÃthis children were starv
ing and sick. Again we were informed,
and we found that no such persons were
known there.

HE BUNKOED WILSON.
A Clever Grafter's Manner of Ob-
tainlng Coin From Unwary
Legal Lights.
The newest game of the grafters, who live
by their wits, is one that is played on men
who are currently supposed to be the
sharpest, mentally, in the communityâ the
attorneys.
It was worked successfully on J. N. E.
Wilson a few days ago, and that legal
luminary is still wondering how he failed
to see the job that was being put up on
him.
A seedy-looking individual walked awk
wardly into Mr. Wilson's office and in
quired for the lawyer. He was asked to
wait a few minutes, and when Mr. Wilson
appeared introduced himself as Mr. Foster
of Oakland.
"Mr. Wilson," he said, "my brother-in
law has just been badly hurt by the cars
over in Oakland and we want you to come
over and see what you can do with the
comoany. The claim-adjuster has been
around and offered to settle with my
relative for $600, but we doc' c think that is
enough. We think he ought to get a
couple of thousand at least, and we want
some smart lawyer to do the dickering
with the company. Besides, my brother
in-law is very badly hurt and may die, and
he wants his will drawn up so that his
property, which a-mounts to several thou
sand dollars, will go to the right parties.
"But are you authorized to represent
your relative in this matter?" asked Mr.
\Vilson.
"Of course I am," said the man. "but I
don't want to appear too prominently in the
case, because 1 work for the company as a
watchman, and if I am known to be figur
ing in the matter I may lose my position.'
"All right," replied the attorney, with a
vision of a fat fee floating before his eyes;
"let us get over there and finish the matter
up.*' After loading himself up with law
books and legal forms they started.
On the way to the ferry the man talked
volubly of the manner in which the rail
road company could be handled by the
right kind of a man, and asked Mr. Wilson
to go easy on his relative, as the latter was
somewhat close and might object to a fee
of more than $150. When near the ticket
office the man stopped and said :
"Look here, Mr. Wilson, it might hurt
me if I went aboard the ferry with you,
for all these people know me as an em
ploye of the company and I don't want to
lose my job. Now, as a matter of fact I
spent my last cent coming over here and
can't pay my fare back. Just let me have
a dollar and I will join you after you get
on the steamer."
Under the circumstances Mr. Wilson
could not well refuse and handed out the
coin requested. That was the last he saw
of his man. He waited on board the boat
until too late to go ashore and had to
make the trip across. He came back by
the next boat and hunted industriously up
and down the water front for the pseudp
relative, but without success. Now he
knows that he was nim-nammed and will
bd more careful in future.
It is said that a number of other well
known attorneys have been victimized in
a similar manner.
IS TO BE AN OPERA SINGER
Coning Departure of Miss Daisy
May Cressy, a Local
Vocalist.
i
The Bright Young Singer Intends to
Go Upon the Operatic
Stage.
Miss Daisy May Cressy, a leading singer
of the First Presbyterian Church, is about
to leave for New York fo continue her
vocal studies, under the direction of Mme.
Pappenheim.
During the Tavary opera season at the
Baldwin, Miss Cressy sang for Marie
Tavary, who was so pleased with the qual
ity of her voice that she at once recom
mended her to Mme. Pappenheim, who is
a distinguished operatic instructor in New
York.
Miss Cressy's voice is a contralto, rang
ing from low D to B, an unusual compass
for one so young. During Dr. Haweis'
visit to this City Miss Cressy sang at one
of his lectures. Although the doctor, is a
theologian, lie is also a musical connois
seur, and pronounced her voice to be al
most phenomenal.
He introduced her to his audience in a
glowing picture of her future success, par
ticularly In comic opera. To this he
thought she was peculiarly adopted owing
to her bright personality, her expressive
fare and her joyous iaughter.
Miss Cressy "is only in her nineteenth
year. "Whiie'possessing all the exuberance
of youth, she is not lacking in ambition
and capacity for labor that must carry her
to the goal to which she aspires. It has
been observed that California has produced
very many unusually fine voices, and the
cause of this has been a question among
musicians, both at home and abroad.

The Cruelty to Animals Society Will
Support Secretary Holbrook
in Making; Arrest 3.
At the monthly meeting of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
which was held yesterday afternoon, Sec
retary Holbrook laid before the board the
question of whether the society would be
with him in attempting to prevent cours
ing in this County.
The secretary gave an account of the new
inclosure for coursing, which is being pre
pared -near the Ingleside racetrack, and
stated that in hia opinion the way in which
the inclosure was to be fenced in would
make the coursing practiced there cruel
and unsportsmanlike.
No resolutions were passed relative to
the secretary's statement, but the board
cave Mr. Holbrook to understand, in an
informal way, that he would be indorsed
by the society in his efforts to suppress
coursing within the County limits, and
that he could make all the arrests he
thought proper.
The report for the month showed that
there had been 238 cases of cruelty to ani
mals reported, all of which had been in
vestigated, and there bad been twenty
five prosecutions, with fifteen convictions.
Secretary Charles B. Hoi brook was
elected a trustee of the society in place of
W. H. Hock&tadter, who recently resigned.
The following are the new members for
the month: W. A. Rabling, .7. H. Huls
burg, Mrs. W. B. Hooper, C. W. Hanson,
Robert C. Howe, Charles McCarthy, Ru
doiph Jordan, Jr., Charles A. Clancy.

NEW YORK. N. V., March 19.â The Improve
ment in the political situation abroad had a good
' effect on stock prices at the opening and the prom

rise Edison Electric, Illuminating of New York

in the standard issues was of small proportions,
notwithstanding purchases of iully 10,000 shares
of St. Paul, Louisville and Nashville and Erie tor
.London account. Local traders who have been
â¢ working for a reaction for some days were alarmed
by the foreign buying and covered, i
This stimulated- the upward movement at the
opening. Toward 11 o'clock lie market devel
oped weakness, and the professional operators and
comm ssion bouses were rather liberal sellers. "
The selling was based on the unsatisfactory trade
conditions and vague rumors that there would be

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. March 19.-Yesterday's wheat
buyers did not complete the task of selling out on
the break which : took place at the close of that
day's session, and when they found things still un
promising and disappointing this morning started
In at the opening to finish up what had been left |
undone. A decline of .lc from yesterday's final j
figures during the first half hour's trading oc- i
curred, after which the pressure was not so great, j
and prices exhibited some steadiness. Liverpool
cables were %d lower. Receipts in the-Northwest
were large at 678 cars against 350 last Thursday i
and 362 a year ago. Chicago received 12 cars and ,
inspected out 100.932 bushels. 1
The Cincinnati i-rice Current spoke unfavorably
of the crop in some sections. Export clearances .
were fair at 278,827 bushels, Including wheat and (
flour. Closing Paris cables were higher, Berlin j
lower and Antwerp unchanged. May whoa: j
opened from 62 v' 8 c to6ic. 8 c and 62Â«ic declined
to 62V8C. closing at 62 1,4 cto 62Â» B e. " c under yes
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 24 cars.
' CORNâ Preserved a steadier tone than wheat, j
Receipts were quite up to the estimate, 453 cars, >
and the average arrivals of late have been fully as
large as could be expected. The trade, however,
has been relying on the ruling low prices as an ob
stacle to any great decline, but at the same time ,
have shown wanness about assuming a radically
buil altitude. Liverpool cables were dull and |
steady. There were no withdrawals from store.
Export clearances were 395.749 bushels. May
corn opened at 29^ic sold as. t?9^' B e, closing at 1
29-'>>i&293 4 c. ashfcde under yesterday. Estimated :
receipts for to-morrow 450 cars.
OAT^^The downward inclination of wheat com
municated an easy tone to oatÂ«. There was no
news or intelligence directly bearing on the mar
i ket. Receipts were 203 cars and 2300 bushels j
1 were withdrawn from store. After wheat steadied |
I oats likewise showed less weakness. May closed |
V B @Vic under yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow 215 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, UOVic: May.
90% c. Receipts, 26 cars. '
PROVISION â "Short" sellers in provisions
were courageous to-day, and after they found
prices soft and yielding under the Influence of
cheaper hops, proceeded with great success to force
a decline. The decline in wheat helped to cause a |
depression in this market. Considerable long
property, which has been held In anticipation of a
rise came out to-day, and contributed to the weak
ness. May pork closed 37 % c lower, May la/d
7%c lower, and May ribs 15c lower. â¢ .â'â¢_;. - ;

NATUBE OP THE ELDER DUMAS.
Mine. Dorval, the Actress, Always Called
Him Her â â¢Good Dog."
I did not meet the elder Dumas until he
was on the wane, but was acquainted with
him before he fell under the influence of
Adah Isaacs Menken. When young his
hair was fair, then dart, but when I saw
him it was gray, and in texture less woolly
than the negro's. His lips were thick and
extended from ear to ear when he laughed,
and his teeth were uneven and set apart
from each other. He flattered himself that
his nose was straight. It was, however,
lumpy, with wide, strongly marked and
quivering nostrils. To the pride of life he
was insensible. But he was a slave of the
flesh, though in a fitful way, and the never
ending pressure of creditors obliged him
to react aeai nst his conviviality. One saw
that he was a force of nature and a child
of nature.
His small hands and feet and his
singularly acute though good-natured blue
eyes alone indicated blood derived from a
long line of civilized Northern ancestors.
There were traces of Africa in his speech.
Hia laugh was a cuffaw, but its hilarity
was contagious. When a case of suffering
was made known to him his face at once
fell, and if he knew the sufferer the broad
face contracted and he howled until he
had spent his Mme. Dorval. whom
be and Victor Hugo thought was the great
est actress of her time for emotional parts,
used to call him her "bon chien" and ncr
"groh chien.'.' In the hour of death she
did not lay aside this term of. endearment,
which any one else would have resented.
He was doggish in many respects, but of
the generotis. impulsive Newfoundland
type.â Emily Crawford in the March Cen
tury.

LYON POST MUST ANSWER
Its Charter May Be Revoked
by the Department of Cali
fornia and Nevada.
ADELIA GOES TO WHITTIER.
Chinese Must Hereafter Procure Per
mits From the' U. S. Marshal
to Visit Prisoners.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 19. J
Lyon Post No. 8, G. A. R., h;.s been cited
to appear before the Administrative Coun
cil of the Department of California and
Nevada to show cause why its charter
should not be revoked. The hearing has
been set for Saturday night, March 28.
This is the result of the charges made by
Lyon Post against the directors of the
Soldiers' Home at Yountville regarding
the management of that institution.
Members of Lyon Jfost, however, assert
that they cannot be "disciplined" by the
Council of Administration in this matter,
because they have at least proven one of
the chargesâ that of maintaining a can
teen or saloon on the grounds â as also
two or three other items of the complaint.
They admit that the outlook is some
what serious, though, especially in view of
the fact that in sending copies of these
charges to the Governor, to Congressmen
and others not members of the order they
violated Grand Army regulations. It is said
now that the attendance at the meeting of
Lyon Tost was very small when the formal
charges were adopted.
It is quite generally known that the re
sult of the inquiry ordered as to the man
agement of the home in response, to the
charges tiled by the committee appointed
for the purpose by Lyon Post, was gener
ally favorable to the board of directors, the
report of Export Daniels, who was ap
pointed to go over the books and accounts,
being specially favorable to the manage
ment.
"Vv c have proved enough," said a well
known member of the post to-niglit, "to
prevent any action by the council, and
when the report is presented at the State
Encampment there will be something more
to be said. Till then matters will have to
rest. Lyon Post will not have its charter
revoked, you can rest assured."
IMPBOVJEJIKNT CLUB.
Organized for the Benefit of West Oak
land.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â There was
a very enthusiastic ineetinq of West Oak
land citizens last evening to take the
necessary preliminary steps to organize
the West Oakland Improvement Club.
There were about fifty representative prop
erty-owners present. School Director i
George J. W. Stark was chosen to preside i
over the temporary organization and C. L.
Wines acted as secretary. i
A number of short addresses were made j
touching on the needs of West Oakland I
and the great benefits that would arise j
from the organization of an improvement j >
association to pu?h ahead the development | <
of their portion of the city. The improve- j ,
ment of the marsh in the northern sec- ,
tion of that part of the city was a subject â 
lo which the speakers paid particular at- '
tention, ind'cating that the solution of Â£
this vexed question would be onÂ« to which (
the club would devote itself. (
The committee on permanent organiza- }
tion named by Chairman Stark is as fol
lows: J. S. Colburn, C. H. F. Brown, F.
Koenig, W. H. Fisk and J. C. Bullock, j '
They are to draft a constitution and by- I 1
iaws and will make their report at a meet- i j
ing to be held next Thursday evening, â¢!
when the club will be permanently organ- j j
ized. Among those who attended last .
night's meeting there were, in addition to i \
those already named, John Schoenf elder, I j
Giles H. Gray, William Berry, O. Lindsey, I
A. Schneck, H. W. Watkins," James Stan
ley, M. S. Freeman, James A. Hennessey, â 
William Wagner, William J. Hennessey, j
Jeremiah Johnson, Louis Hufschmidt, ,
Joseph Potter, Joseph Nesbit, D. M. At
water and a number of others. At the I
next meeting of the organization a club
roll will be opened and the membership
will probably be large.
STILL IX THE FIGHT.
Buswell Thinks He Should Ride Free
on Seventh Street.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â E. G.
Buswell is taking steps to carry his fight
against the Southern Pacific into the
Supreme Court. He still thinks that the
corporation has no right to collect fares on
Seventh street.
"I will take it to the Supreme Court,"
said Mr. Buswell to-day, "and if necessary
will take it thence to the Supreme Court
of the United States. Steps have already
been taken on appeal and notice of them
have already been filed."
The case came up before Judge Ellsworth
some time ago and a decision denying
Buswell the request of preventing the col
lection of fares on the line in question was
rendered. It was hinted tnat Buswell
might amend his complaint, but that will
not be done. This fact was set forth by a
document filed to-day in the clerk's office
by C. If. Jennings, Buswell's attorney,
notifying the attorneys for the railroad
company that no amendment will be made
and for* them to have judgment entered
upon demurrer.
Chinese Visitors.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â Jailer Al
"White has decided that so many Chinese
visitors to the Mongolian- prisoners is not
a good tbing. Heretofore when any gang
engaged in the illicit opium business hai
been jailed a lot of their countrymen have
rushed to the jail to visit them. Two
Chinese came to the jail with the request
from a firm of custom-house brokers that
they be permitted to see the two Chinese
arrested for cooking opium at Bay Farm
Island. The jailer is suspicious of these
'go-betweens" and retused to admit and
Cninese except on an order from the
United States Marshal.

A. ESTERBROOK'S DENIAL
L. R. Dawson of Seattle Named
Him as a Co-Respond
ent.
Arrest of Mr. Pitman, Who Tried to
Beat Uncle Collis Out of
Five Cents.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â Arthur
!P. Esterbrook of this city, the young
man who is mentioned as co-respondent in
a suit for divorce by L. R. Dawson of Se
attle against his wife, strenuously objects
to having his name connected with the
j matter in any way. Three years ago the
j Dawson family spent the winter in Ala
! meda, and during their stay resided in a
house on Regent street. The family con
sisted of Mrs. Dawson, her two children
and an unmarried sister, the husband re
maining in Seattle and practicing his pro
fession as a dentist. After being here for
several moatbs the family returned to
Seattle, and nothing more had been heard
of them until the announcement of the
divorce and the naming of a long list of co
respondents.
Esterbrook says that he met Mrs. Daw
son in ban Jose about four years ago, and
that about one year later he again met her
in Alameda, and made several calls at the
house on Regent street. He denies that
their relations were improper or that she
accompanied him anywhere, and says
that the charges against him are entirely
false.
Lane Is Located.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â Robert
Lane, the man who came over here from
Oakland last December and looted six
houses, almost within one block, and who
subsequently skipped after having fur
nished straw boucis to the amount of $2000,
has been located at Cripple Creek, Colo.
The Oakland authorities have received in
formation to that effect, that he is at that
place, and an effort will probably be made
to capture him. Lane, after having been
given his liberty, got out of reach of the
authorities as soon as he could, and no
recourse could be had, because the bonds
furnished were perfectly worthless. Be
sides the crime of entering houses Lane had
a charge of embezzlement against him.
During last October he called on a Miss
Petrenahl of 903 Lafayette street and 6old
her a 25-cent lottery ticket, for which, in
payment, she gave him $10. He went off
to get the change, but never returned.
When ho was arrested on the last charges
she called to gee him at the City Prison,
recognizing the man at once as the one
who had duped her.
School Vacation.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â 1n future
the Alameda and San Francisco public
schools will have their vacations extending
over the same period of time. Up to the
present time there has been considerable
variance between the two cities with regard
to the opening and closing dates ot the
schools. An arrangement has now been
made whereby San" Francisco will close
her schools for the midsummer vacation
about the middle of June and open again
on August 1, allowing six veeks in all.
This has always been the custom in Ala
meda, it being considered the best method
of winding up the school year.
Tried to Evade Payment.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.- A ship
carpenter named J. Pitman, residing
at the Bay View House at Alamecia
Point, was arrested this morning by Officer
Brown at the narrow-gausje mole, and
upon" being brought to the City Prison was
charged with attempting to evade the pay
ment of railroad fare. Pitman boarded
the train at Seventh and Webster streets,
Oakland, and persistently refused to part
with any of the pocketful of coin which he
had and raade an attempt to alight at
Alameda Point. He was held aDoard,
however, and taken to the mole, where he
was turned over to a policsrnan.
Funeral of J. C. Smith.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â The
funeral of J. C. Smith took place
yesterday afternoon, from the residence,
2252 Central avenue. The Rev. C. E. \V.
Smith of the Methodist Church South offi
ciated. The pallbearers were Judge Wil
liam T. Wallace, Jess^ D. Carr, George
Waggoner, George M. Turner, Stephen T.
Gageand Captain Simpson. The remains
were interred in Mountain View Cemetery.
The Crowd Vanished.
Gustave Dore could show invention, not
only in his wonderful illustrations, but
also in matters of everyday life.
One day a friend at Verona was taking
a photographic view of a picturesque old
street and Dore tried to assist by keeping
off the crowd of idle lookers-on. It was a
difficult task and the more he gesticulated
and threatened the greater became the
throng. Suddenly Dore had a splendid
idea.
"Wait a minute!" he called out to his
friend, "and I'll disperse them."
He then took off his coat, threw it on
the ground and, assuming a pitiful ex
pression, he went round, cap in hand, to
beg for a few soldi. As be advanced tbe
crowd drew back and melted away and his
friend quickly obtained the negative*
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
MAY GIRLS WEAR STEELS?
School Director Dr. Myra Knox
and Professor Mead Op
pose Them.
SPOIL ELECTRIC EXPERIMENTS.
High School Girls Must Choose Be
tween Correct Scientific Results
or Prevailing Fashions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 19. j
This city is very fortunate in having a
woman on the School Board, for a question
has arisen that only a woman can handle
with propriety.
A very delicate subject is now engaging
the attention of the girl pupiln in the
High School. It concerns the wearing of
corsets.
Yesterday afternoon Dr. Myra "W.
Kr.ox, who is also a School Director, de
livered a lecture before the High School
girls on the commonplace things of a
girl's life. After discussing the questions
of diet, sleep, housework and other mat
ters she referred to the subject of dress.
"A gentleman connected with our city
schools, " said Dr. Knox, "ha 3 repeatedly
said that our High School girls dress too
much, lie is a man of judgment and
good taste, and is deeply interested in all
that pertains to students.
"I sincerely hope he is mistaken in this
for several reasons. First, it reflects on
your good taste. Second, you are setting
a bad example. If you dress suitably for
the schoolroom you may help some one
else to have the moral courage to dress
within her means. And may I speak of
your graduating dresses? That is a serious
question twice a year to Quite a number. I
hope the coming class will set an example
for all future classes in inexpensive sim
plicity, for simplicity is not always in ex
pensive. Of course youknow as '.veil as I
do that corsets should not be worn by a
growing girl. She should have a chance
to grow and expand as nature intended
she should, and as a boy does. Imagine a
boy in corsets. And why not? If they
are good for a girl, why not fora boy?
Suggest it to your brothers.
"In many ways we might improve on
the wav of wearing garments. Skirts
should "be light and fastened to a waist.
Warmth should be supplied by tbe un
derwear. Your costume for the gym
nasium is the best possible, for it is made
for a purpose and gives absolute freedom
to all parts of the body."
After the lecture Dr< Sarah I. Shuey
read the following questions to the girls
and asked them to answer on blank slips
of paper:
1. What increase of growth (weight, etc.)
have you attained during the past year?
2. How many hours' work In manual train
ing have you taken?
3. Do you breakfast before cominr to school?
4. What does your usual breakfast consist of?
5. Do you take a warm luncheon at school?
6. At what hour do you retire?
7. Are yon often up later than that hour?
8. Do you help your mother at home?
Nearly all the girls answered the ques
tions, but some of the older and more
fashionablo misses seemed to consider the
questions too personal, and did not reply.
'"There was only one othur question. 1 '
said Dr. Shuey, "and it was a perfectly
proper one to be addressed by a physician
â :i woman â to a class of girls. Neither
Principal McChesney nor any other man
was in the gymnasium at the time. I
heard no protests, and do not know if any
of the girls were indignant. At the time
I talked to the girls about the wearing of
corsets, but I see no harm in that. I have
more than one reason for doing that.
Professor McChesney tells me that the
girls cannot take the course in electricity
perfectly because the steels in their corsets
act as magnets."
Some time ago the girls complained to
Professor Mead of their inability to ob
tain correct results in the electrical experi
ments and the professor stated it was due
to the presence of steel in the girls' cloth
ing. "Yes; 1 told the girls they could not
wear steel corsets and try to make accu
rate experiments with the galvanometer,"
said Frofessor Mead to-day. "It is im
possible to do so. The boys are forced to
discard their steel knives and anything
else of steel in their possession during ex
periments with the galvanometer, and tlie
girls will have to do the same. I told
these facts to Miss Palmer, who conducts
the physical exercises, and asked her to re
quest all the young Indies who worked
with electricity v to cease from wearing
steels."
The matter was revived by yesterday's
lecture, and now that science and fashion
have collided there will probably be some
rule framed that will fit tne case.
FIRE AT HAYWARDS.
An Electric I.tght Spark Causes Damage
in a Clothing-Store.
HAYWARDS, Cal., March 19.â This
raornirg at 5 o'clock night watchman
Pimeintel, on passing the large general
merchandise store of A. Alexander on B
street, saw smoke issuing from the inter
ior of the store and he hurriedly awakened
the proprietor. On opening the doors the
store was found to be rilled with smoke
and a counter full of clothing was in
ruins. The loss will be very heavy, as the
goods are nearly all ruined from the
smoke. The cause of the fire is attributed
to a spark falling from the large electric
light on the clothine.
ANOTHER EASTERN TRIP.
Berkeley May Send a Track
Team Across the Continent
Again This Year.
Encouragement From Yale and Prince
tonâRev. Anna Shaw Lectures.
Intercollegiate Field Day.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 19.â Captain
Merwin has just received two important
telegrams from the East which tend to cast
a much more favorable light than has
hitherto been shed on the proposed East
ern track athletic trip this summer. Yes
terday he telegraphed to Yale and to
Princeton, asking if each would meet the
University of California track team in a
single contest or join in a contest in which
the three institutions were participants.
In reply he received the" following dis
patches from the captains of the Yale and
Princeton teams:
Nkw Haven, Conn., March 18. 189 G.
L. T. Merwin, Captain Universfty of California
Track Athletic Team, Berkeley, Cat.: Cannot
make arrangements at such short notice.
Please write.
L. P. Sheldon, Track Captain Yale.
Princeton, N. J., March 18, 189(5.
L. T. Merwin, Captain University of California
Track Athletic Team, Berkeley, Cat.: Am willinÃ
to have meeting of three colleges, if possible to
arrange. Rowert Garrett Jr.,
Track Captain Princeton.
The plan of bnving a triple meet between
the three institutions mentioned was ad
vanced early in the spring, but as it was
not thought possible until quite recently
to send a team across the continent again
this year the scheme was temporarily laid
aside. So numerous and encouraging
have been the recentcoroniunicationsfrorn
-Eastern and Middle West colJesres con
cerning: athletic contests that the Berkeley
team has felt justified in taking up the
triple meet plan for a second time. Al
ready about $700 has been guaranteed the
California team by the Middle West col
leges, providing a meet can be arranged
for the late spring or early summer. Union
College has also filed a request to meet the
California men should they come to New
York this season, but no money guarantee
has yet been made by them. The two tele
grams received last night from Yale and
Princeton have created a considerable stir
In university athletic circles and the par
ticularly favorable word from Princeton
inspired feelings of encouragement un
precedented this year. Captain Merwin
said this evening: "We are indeed greatly
encouraged at the prospects for another
trip East.; The principalquestion now re
maining unsolved is that of finances. We
are certain of wiiat we can do on the track
and field, judging partly from our last
year's work and from what our men are
doing now. What we now want is to
know that, the money to pay our ex
penses will be forthcoming from the con
tests in which we are to engage. We will
probably meet Yale and Princeton on
Manhattan held if we arrange for contests
with them. Should we go East we will
leave Berkeley about May 2."
I . C. -Stanford Field Say.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.â Manager
Brown of the Stanford track team and
Captain Mervrin of the University of Cali
fornia team hava concluded the prelim
inary arrangements connected with the
coming annual intercollegiate field day.
April 25 has been set as the date of the
contest.
Following is the agreement governing
the affairs of the match, which the two
university representatives have signed:
Firstâ To hold the annual intercollegiate field
day of 1596 at the Olympic Club grounds in
San Francisco, on April 25, 1896, at 2 o'clock
r. m.
Secondâ That the list and order of events be
the same as those prescribed by the I. A. A.,
with the exception of the bicycle re.cc.
Thirdâ A two-mile bicycle race will be In
cluded in the list of events, to take the place
of special Dicycle races named in the events of
the I. A. A.
Fourthâ Each university shall stand equally
the expenses of tne meet, end from the gross
receipts of the meet Stanford shall received
for each athlete representing her in actual
contest. Likewise the University of California
shall receive 30 cents for each athlete repre
senting tier in actual contest, this money to be
paid in lieu of traveling expenses.
No addition or alteration of this agreement
can be made without the mutual consent of
the parties concerned.
D. E. Brown,
Manager Track Team, Stanford.
L. T. Manny,
CaDtain U. C. Team.
Intercollegiate Basket-Ball.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.â The date
for the U. C. -Stanford co-ed basket-ball
game has been set. Manager Edith Brown
sill of the Berkeley team and Manager
Esther Wood Keifer met in San Francisco
last evening and decided that the inter
collegiate contest would take place on
April 4. The place o-f meeting will be Ar
mory Hall, San Francisco. The time of
the game will bo forty minutes, divided
into two twenty-minute halves with a ten
minute intermission. The officials of the
day have not vet been named. The floor
to be used will be wood, and not earth or
tanbark, as was at first considered.
The audience will be composed of women
only, a mixed crowd having been consid
ered out of the question. The Berkeley
co-eds arc under strict training rules and
are practicing daily in preparation for the
match. All objection to tne game on the
part of the faculty at Berkeley seems to be
removed since it has been decided that the
game will be played indoors and not before
a mixed audience.
A. IN A. Meeting.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.â Berkeley
Council No. 22, of the American Protective
Association, heki a meeting in Odd Fel
lows' Hall last night, when State President
Hudelson delivered an address on the pol
itical issues raised by the order. Mr.
Hudelson urged that a State Board of Edu
cation should be appointed to regulate all
school matters, so that the standards of
scholarship, of requirements- for teachers'
certificates and of textbooks to be used
would be the same in all counties. He
declared it to be the intention of the
A. P. A. to have the next State Legisla
ture cut off r!1 State appropriations for
sectarian institutions, and advocated the
establishment of high schools in every dis
trict in the State, so that no pupils would
have to leave home and pay tribute in
high schools.
I>ental College Field Day.
RERKELEY, Cal., March 16.â A long
and varied programme of events for the
dental college neld day at Berkeley next
Saturday has been arranged. There will
be five events open to all students â the 220
--yard dash, the 120-yard hurdle, 220-yard
hurdle, high jump and pole vault. The
event of the day will be a mile relay race.
Five men from each class of dental college
will compose the contesting teams. The
race will be for a silver trophy given by the
faculty of the dental college.
To Reduce Expenses.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.-Fred
Wilkes, secretary of the West Berkeley
Progressive Club, has suggested a novel
way of reducing expenses in the school
department. Mr. Wilkes thinks the
teachers should be subject to competition
like contractors and other workers em
ployed by the town. According to his
plan bids should be received and the
teacher offering his service at the lowest
figures should be appointed.
New Hydrauts.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.âSuper
intendent of Streets Guy Chick has ad
dressed a letter to the Alameda Water
Company requesting that company to
place about fifty new hydrants at various
points in the territory covered by its mains

It is expected that work will be begun on
the changes at once.

injured, James Payne in the Indepen
dent says: "It will be curious if these
animals distinguish themselves in this
humane employment, as the dogs of St.
Bernard have done in a different field.
They l;ave already been taught, it is
said, to 'search for wounded men, either
by day or night, with unerring ac
curacy.' But how do they know they are
wouncled? Indeed, as those they have
been experimenting upon have been ob
viously only pretending to be wounded,
they must hitherto have made nothing,
but mistakes. To a wounded man who
has not been informed of this canine edu
cation it must be father alarming to find a
strange dog with a cold nose taking, as it
were, a diagnosis of his condition before
applying the latest remedies attached to
its collar." j
HER PASTOR'S CHARGES
Mrs. Prescott Will Investigate
the Charges and Record
Of Rev. Mr. Ellis.
SUSPECTS HE HAS A MOTIVE.
Meanwhile the Minister Says He Is
Convinced That Old Clark Is
the Agent's Victim.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,[
908 Broadway, March 19. \
Rev. John W. Ellis, pastor of the Cen
tennial Presbyterian Church, has locked
horns with Mrs. Prescott, agent of the
Children's Society, and this afternoon he
published a statement reflecting on that
lady. Mrs. Prescott denies his charges in
toto and hints that Rev. Mr. Ellis must
have some motive for attacking her that
has not yet been made public. The trouble
is all over the arrest of an aged man named
Ulark for immoral conduct with little
girls.
"There hangs upon this question," said
Air. Ellis to-day, ''the matter of a man's
trial for a serious offense. It would be an
unfortunate thing if Mrs. Prescott and I
should differ so materially as to cause this
man injury. The case is one in which
my stand is merely that of a clergyman,
and I have nothing personal in the matter
at all. After hearing Mrs. Prescott's story
I should have left the matter alone if she
had not told me that she had had those
children in her house for three hours at a
time and volunteered the information that
she knew what she was doing, for she said
she was a good cross-examiner. I said to
myself, if these are the facts the children
roust liave been filled up with a whole lot
of talk, and consequently thought the
straight story could not be obtained from
them.
"Now, another thing. I am in receipt
of a number of letters and have had sev
eral personal interviews with people who
complain bitterly of her treatment of them
and their families. These charges are very
serious. We are now investigating the
whole thing, and if the reports are true,
whatever office she holds, if any, will be
come a mutter of vast importance to the
public. The question of her right to enter
a family and forcibly take children away
enters into this matter ako. I always sup
posed the Bociety was a kindred organiza
tion to religious bodies of that character,
but find it is a public office and that Mrs.
Prescott spends most of her time in the
District Attorney's office,
"As for the difference, I am quite able
to sustain myself, being fully confident of
the stand I take. I am also equally con
tident that old Mr. Clark is innocent of
the charges, for if I we^e not, I would take
r.o part whatever in this affair. I am
merely assisting him in trying to get some
attorney to take up his case. He has no
money nor has he any ability to defend
himself, so 1 am trying to persuade an
attorney, out ot love or charity, to defend
him. As soon as he gets a lawyer lam
done with the case. He is not a member
of my church, but I simply agreed to see
Mrs. Pr^scott for him. I won't let any
man suffer unjustly when it is in my power
to prevent it."
'â¢I am quite at a loss to understand what
is the matter with Rev. Mr. PHlis," said
Mrs. Prescott to-night. "It seems to me
that he has some mot.ye for attacking me
that has not yet been made public. He
says he never knew Clark, and yet he ap
pears to be deeply interested in his case. I
think when the matter is more fully in
vestigated that Mr. Eliis will be sorry he
has paid so much. I never had the chil
dren for hours at my house; neither did I
coach then;. When he called on me I
thought he was merely interested in know
ing the facts, and we talked over things In
confidence. He now says that 1 said
things I never uttered. My record is clean
and honorable. I know that Mr. Ellis has
a record, but I do not know just what
kind it is, but feel confident that it will
not compare favorably with mine. I am
going to make some inquiries at San
Francisco and Walnut Creek about him,
and may have some very interesting things
to tell in the near future."
PINK AND WHITE WEDDING
Nuptials of Miss Carrie Heller
and I. Flishman of Los
Angeles.
The Groom Is a Nephew of I. W.
Hellman, President of the
Nevada Bank.
The wedding of Miss Carrie Heller,
daughter of the late Moses Heller, and I.
Flishnian of Los Angeles was solemnized
last evening at 9 o'clock at the residence
of the bride's mother, Mrs. Emilie Heller,
1801 California street.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger of the Temple
Emmanu-El performed the ceremony ac
cording to the rites of the Hebrew church.
Miss Heller, the bride of last evening, ia
one of the most popular belles in Jewish
social circles. Talented, accomplished,
affable and an heiress, no entertainment
was considered complets at which, she was
not present.
Although fond of social life and gayety,
her decided dislike of ostentation and pub
licity have caused her to refuse the many
entertainments planned in her honor and
that of Mr. Flishmau during the past
three months of their engagement. The
groom is a nephew of I. \V. Hellman,
president of file Nevnda Bank, and is pop
ular in southern society.
Although 150 invitations were issued for
the ceremony last evening, the guests in
cluded only relatives of the contracting
parties and most intimate friends.
All the details and arrangements for the
wedding were marked by the ntmast sim
plicity. There were no bridal attendants.
E. S. Heller gave the bride away.
The decorations of the home were artis
tic and elaborate. Miss Bates was given
carte blanche in that matter and the re
sults were more than pleasing. Each of
the various apartments on the ground floor
boasted of a distinct floral decoration. In the
reception-room, where the ceremony was per
formed, piuk and white blossoms were used
exclusively. In the adjoining apartment
marigold* made an effective decoration and in
the corridor green was the prevailing tone.
The bride wore a magnificent gown oi white
Ducbesse satin, the slightly decolette corsage
of which was trimmed with rare old lace.
After the ceremony congratulations and- a
short order of dances were in order. At 11 :30
an elaborate supper was served, after which
dancing was resumed.
Mr. and Mrs. Flishraan will spend their
honeymoon in the land of the Mikado. Their
future home will be in Los Angeles.
The happy couple received very many ele
gant and costly gifts, comprising magnificent
crystal, silverware and rare bits of art.
A large number of invited guests attended
the musicale given Jast Saturday morning by
Professor Voliher Hoffmeyer at his studio, 26
O'Karrell street. The opening number,
"Echoes," from Ossian, by Raff, for two pianos,
was admirably rendered by Mr. Hoffmeyer,
Miss Feathers tone, Mrs. P. O. Peterson and
Miss Nolte. "The Moonlight; Sonata" (Bee
thoven), played by Mr.- Hoffmeyer, was fol

E. A. HATHERTON
GONE FROM HOME
The Strange Disappearance
of a Prominent
Architect.
HE THREATENED SUICIDE
Wrote His Wife a Letter Saying
He Was Tired of
Life..
LOST A FORTUNE IN TACOMA.
It Is Presumed That His Financial
Condition Led Him to Take
His Life.
Edward A. Hatherton, who was for ten
years City Architect, has been absent from
his home since March 1, and in conse
quence liis wife is almost distracted, as
she has reason to believe he has ended his
life.
For many months prior to his departure
from home he iiad been despondent. He
frequently intimated to his friends that he
was tired of life and intended to do away
with himself. No heed was paid to his
threats, however, until a few days after his
disappearance, when his wife, fearing the
worst, began to make anxious inquiries
about her missing husband.
She appealed to her friends to assist her
in locating him, but after a futile search
they have sought the aid of the Police De
partment.
Mrs. Hatherton and her friends are
strongly of the belief that the missing
man has committed suicide and they have
been daily calline at the Morgue hoping,
yet fearing, that possibly Hatherton's body
might be identified among tbe unknown
dead received there. The Coroners of the
adjoining counties have also been notified
of bis disappearance and furnished with a
description.
On the evening of February 29 Hather
ton left home at the usual "hour for his
office. He bade bis wife the customary
good-by and appeared to be in unusually
pooa spirits. He did not return that night,
however, and he has not since been seen.
Next morning Mrs. Hatbenon, vrho had
Â£rown uneasy over the strange absence of
her husband", reported the fact to her
brother-in-law, George H. Winterburn.
and the latter paid a visit to the office and
also at the home of Hatherton's partner,
Thoma* C. Ross, hopine to learn some
thing concerning his whereabouts.
In the afternoon of the same day Mrs.
Hatherton's worst fears were all but real
ized when she received a letter through
the mail from her husband stating that by
the time it reached her he would be dead.
He said he had tired of life and could not
longer stand its existence and its cares.
This fact recalled to the wife's mind that
on the morning her husband leit the
house for the first time in many months
he took his revolver with him. As Hath-
erton had frequently said if ever he com
mitted suicide he would carry out his
plan in a manner that would not necessi
tate a buriai, the wife is of the opinion
that he has soupht, some secluded spot and
ended his life with a pistol ball.
Hp.therton has been known as one of the
most prominent architects in this City tor
over twenty years. His well-established
ability resulted in his being chosen City
Architect to succeed August Layer about
seventeen years ago and he held that
responsible position for about ten years.
When Tacoma was in the height "of its
building boom about hve years ago Hath
erton went to that city with hopes of bet
tering his financial condition. He
remained there until about eighteen
months ago. Good fortune for awhile
favored him and he invested heavily
in real estate, but when the finan
cial calamity, whicli was experienced
all over the Northwest, came, Hatherton
became deeply entangled with his invest
ments and lost about $60,000. He then re
turned to thi3City and joined with Thomas
C. Ross in establishing a local business,
and lately the h'rm has been doing quite
well. The day he disappeared tbe tirm
was awarded two big contracts which
would have placed Hatherton in comfort
able circumstances.
Hatherton, however, did not appear to
consider his business, and con
tinued to brood over his losses in Tacoma,
and it is believed by many of his friends
that this fact probably caused him to con
template suicide.
Hatherton is an Englishman by birth
and about 60 years of age. He was 5 feet
11 inches in height, wore a short gray
beard and was a man who would attract a
second glance from any passerby. When
Jas>t seen he was attired in a gray tweed
suit. He wore a plain gold ring on his left
hand and a gold watch and chain.
THE BLOW PROVED FATAL
John Buckley, an Old Man, Died
at the Receiving
Hospital.
Charles Gercken of the American Brew
ing Company Charged With
the Murder.
John Backley died at the Receiving
Hospital shortly after 5 o'clock yesterday
morning and his body wss removed to the
Morgue. A few hours later Charle?
Gercken was booked at the City Prison
charged with the murder.
Buckley was 60 years of age and was
employed in the lumber-yards at North
Beach. He lived at 927 Broadway with
his wife and two sons and a daughter. He
left home on Saturday night and did not
return. About 10 o'clock Sunday morning
Buckley was in the- saloon of Mrs. Bar
borough, on the corner of Mason and
Green streets. He had been drinking
heavily and was inclined to be quarrel-
Borne. He was in the company of a young
man named "Mosey" Lee.
Buckley and Lee made some offensive
remarks to Mrs. Barborough and Gercken,
who was in the saloon, interfered to pro
tect her. This angered Buckley and he
attempted to strike Gercken. Rather than
have a row Gercken walked out of the
saloon, and Buckley followed him to the
Bidewalk and abused him for interfering
witb him.
The old man again attempted to strike
Gercken, who retaliated and hit him on
the breast, knocking him down. In his
fall his head struck tne sidewalk with con
siderable force, rendering him unconscious.
Policeman G. A. Anderson was sent for
and had Buckley taken to the Receiving
Hospital. An examination showed that
Buckley's skull was badly fractured and
considering his advanced age it was
thought his recovery was extremely doubt
ful. He never regained consciousness and
died early yesterday morning.
Gercken is 26 years old and lived with
his parents at 627 Lombard street. He
was an employe ot the American Brewing
Company. He was arrested on Sunday by
Policeman Anderson and was detained in
the "tanks" pending the result of the old
man's injury.
At the time of his arrest Gercken made
the following statement: "I was in a sa
loon on the corner of Mason and Green
streets when Buckley and a friend of his
named Lee came in. We all drank to
gether. Buckley and L.cc insulted Mrs.
Barbrough and 1 attempted to quiet tne
old man, when he struck mo in the face. I
walked out and Buckley followed me. He
called me a lot of hard names and at
tempted to strike me. I pushed him away
and be fell to tbe sidewalk. 1 then walked
away."
Some boys,who saw Buckley and Gercken
on the sidewalk, told Policeman Anderson
that Gercken had struck tbe old man sev
eral times witb his lists before he was
knocked down.
Dr. Barrett made an autopsy on the
body yesterday and found that death was
caused by cerebral hemorrhage arising
from a fracture of the skull. An inquest
will be held.
MISSION FOR MEN.
The Rev. Charles I>. Meil of Sausalito
PreacTies at the Chapel of the
Good Samaritan.
At the Chapel of the Good Samaritan on
Folsom street the Rev. \V. I. Kip is con
ducting a three days' mission for men.
Last night the speakers scheduled were
District Attorney Barnes and the Rev.
Charles L. Meil of Sausalito.
But Mr. Barnes telegraphed he would be
detained at Baden, which would prevent,
much to his regret, his address for the
evening.
The chapel was crowded, and the ser
vices were followed with mucb earnestness.
Mr. Meil preached on the "Miracle of
Transformation." He drew the picture of
Lazarus in the tomb and contrasted this
with the picture of him sitting at the
table partaking of the same repast with
Christ and Mary and Martha. "This is
the most remarkable contrast that is set
forth in the Bible," said the speaker.
"There he lay in the cold, nark tomb
surrounded by the dead. When Christ
stood before the entrance and called
to Lazarus to awaken his voice pen
etrated the innermost depths of that
chamber of death and transformed the
dead man to one full ql buoyant life.
The change was not only inward, but also
outward.
"Such a change occurs in the life and
heart of any man who has been awakened
by the Savior. When good has been im
planted in the heart the actions will be
speak the change within."
This evening the meetine will be ad
dressed by Attorney A. M. Drown and the
Rev. W. t Kip.
The mission is carrying on a gratify
ingly succes.-ful work in that portion of
the Mission district, over 1500 members
having so far joined. The reading-rooms
and gymnasium make a pleasant place for
gatherings at night and tbe opportunity is
well taken advantage of by the numerous
members.

Bailey's Enthusiastic Constituent.
It sometimes happens that a prophet is
most honorea in his own country and
among his own people, says the Washing
ton Star. For example, there was a party
of Texans, Congressman Bailey's loyal
constituents, in a Pennsylvania- avenue
car the other day. A little girl was with
truem. The little thing knelt on the seat,
her nose pressed against the window-pane.
She did not see the Capitol at all till just
as the car swung around at the foot of the
hill. Then, as the great white building
flashed before her she turned excitedly:
"Oh, mamma!" she cried. "There "it is*
tbtte'i Mr. Bailey's office." '

HE EXERTED HIS
SVENGALI POWER
Potent Influence of a Bald
Spot on a Physician's
Head.
DID SHE PLAY POSSUM?
Dr. Albert Abrams Tells How
He Treated Miss Alex
ander.
HE EXPLAINS THE PROCESS.
Letter Written After She Was Hyp
notizedâSignature Before
and After.
Dr. Albert Abrams, professor of path
ology at Cooper Medical College, was seen
at bis office on Geary street yesterday.
Speaking of the suit to collect money from
Miss Rae Alexander Dr. Abrams said:
"I have read the article published in
The Call, and while I do not care to say
a word against the young lady I do. not
â want to be placed in a false position before
the public myself. She came to me for
Treatment on Juiy 7, 189"), and the last
treatment was on October 5, 1895. Now
here is her signature before the first
hypnotic seance and here it is after the
tirst treatment."
Dr. Abrams produced both signatures,
ana surely the one made after the seance
was much the superior in style, firmness
and legibility.
On November 8 the patient, complying
with a previous inquest of the physician
to write to him after the hypnotic treat
ment ceased, did write a letter, whicli the
doctor produced. The chirography is al
most perfect.
Dr. Abrams did not enter into a defense
of the hypnotic process. He says that he
explained to the young lady that it was a
Bcienc? recognized by the highest medical
authorities in London, Paris and Berlin.
Incidentally he referred yesterday to an
article written by Glark Bell of New York
and published in the' Feoruary number of
the Criminal Law Magazine Reporter to
show that the hypnotic treatment has
been recognized and practiced as a thera
peutic remedy by the most cultivated and
advanced physicians â men of the highest
character and widest professional attain
ments â and nad been used with signal suc
cess and usefulness.
Dr. Abrams said that the bill of |H0 was
rendered to Miss Alexandsr so that she
would not feel under personal obligations
for the treatment extending from July 7 to
O.ctober 5. "A reasonable charge," said
he, "for the professional services rendered
â¢would have been $150. I do not care for
the fe j of $30, but there is a principle in
volved which I am not willing to surren
der. In any event it will cost rae much
more than $30 to conduit the suit. I do
not like the way I have been used after
the young lady spoke so often to her com
panions of her restored ability to write. I
have practiced medicine in San Francisco
for fifteen years, and never before brought
a suit to collect a fee. 1 have given my
professional services freely in many, many
cases, and have canceled many large ac
counts rather than press unfortunate pa
tients to payment."
Dr. Abrams is a man of. wealth whose
practice is lucrative. His colleagues in the
profession of medicine acknowledge his
worth and his close attention to modern
developments. While it is exceptional in
Sun Francisco for physicians to invoke
hypnotic influence in* the treatment of
patients the remedy is perfectly legitimate.
It is conceded, said another* pnysician,
that Dr. Abrams has read extensively on
the subject and devoted much personal ob
servation in Europe to experimental cases.
Schools for the investigation of the treat
ment have been established in Paris,
Nancy and Berlin, but it cannot be said
that the medical profession is convinced
that ailments can be cured by the exercise
of hypnotic power.
Dr. Abrams contends that there is a great
deal more in hypnotism as- a remedial
agent in the practice of medicine than is
popularly supposed. For many years
only charlatans invoked the science, nut
now progressive physicians in legitimate
practice employ it.
Another physician of high standing said
last evening: "Dr. Abratns has studied
this subject carefully. While hypnotism
is not recognized generally, it is perfectly
legitimate for a physician to invoke it9use
in the treatment of a patient. In fact, the
widest latitude in the application of reme
dies is allowed. The object is to cure the
patient. Now I know of a case where Dr.
wanted a girl to take an anesthetic,
as he had a puinful operation on her knee
to perform. When he was ready to admin
ister the anesthetic he found her under
hypnotic influence, and so he performed
the operation without pain to her. In sub
sequent attempts to produce the hypnotic
influence he failed."
During the time that Miss Rae Alex
ander was undergoing treatment by Dr.
Abrams there were three hypnotic seances.
It may remain for the intelligent jury to
decide whether the patient was under" the
influence. She says that she had one eye
just a little open and observed that Dr.
Abranis was looking at her sister.
The bald spot on Dr. Abrams : head may
figure in the trial, as she says the doctor
advised her to keep an eye on it. Now
that spot is so located on the doctor's head
that he will be obliged to get down on
"all fours" or bend low in hjs chair to give
the jury a view of it. How Miss Alexander
saw it without getting on a chair or step
ladder may puzzle the intelligent jury.
At the request of The Call, Dr. Abrams
gave a brief history of his investigation of
the subject of hypnotism and its use in
the treatment of disease. He said :
"The originator of the use of hypnotism
in medicine was Braid of Manchester.
Then Lieubauit of Nancy, France, wrote a
work on the subject. His work was unap
preciated for twenty years. It was not
even read. Hypnotism remained a curi
osity, and it seemed inadvisable for a
scientific physician to occupy himself with
it, unless he was willing to get for himself
the reputation of a charlatan or a man
whose methods were suspicious or even
dangerous.
'â¢The credit of bringing to liorht again
the work of Lieubauit belongs to Bernheim
of Nancy. He and the Nancy school must
be regarded as the founders of the move
ment which led to the successful use of
hypnotism, or rather, of makinz it the
basis for a treatment of disease. The atti
tude which certain well-known scholars
and investigators have thought it proper

ABSOLUTELY. PURE
to take toward the treatment by hypnot
ism one can well understand if one only
remembered that for the successful prac
tice of hypnotism much time and patience
is necessary.
"That hypnotism had undoubted value
in the treatment of certain diseases "is at
tested by the fact that the greatest physi
cians in' Europe have taken up the sub
ject. In Berlin Dr. Moll is the most
successful in the use of it in the treatment
of disease. Charcot of Paris, when living,
was one of the greatest physicians for the
treatment of nervous diseases â in fact, one
of the greatest of modern timesâ and he
used this mysterious power in a remarka
bly successful manner. And AVetterstrand
of ' Stockholm also resorted to it largely.
"It is true that hypnotism can do harm.
But so can medicine, for that matter. It
will depend upon how hypnotism is re
sorted to in determining upon its efficacy.
80 far as the use of it is concerned in actual
practice, it is a well-established fact that it
has cure-.! functional diseases which have
resisted all other methods of treatment.
"In medicine it is a recognized rule
among physicians to select any method of
treatment which is capable of doing good.
In other words the end justifies the means.
The treatment of alcoholism by hypnotism
brought about excellent results. Heavy
drinkers are benefited for a time, and even
sometimes permanently cured. The reac
tion of morphine fiends to hypnotism has
as yet not been thoroughly investigated,
but the results thus far achieved are not,
it is true, very encouraging. The observa
tions of Wetterstrand show that in epilepsy
many good results can be obtained, and in
surgery it is very frequently employed in
lieu of an anesthetic.
"In this City at the present time the
dentists seem to make more use of it than
do the physicians. They hypnotize their
patients, of course, with the knowledge
and consent of the latter and then extract
their teeth. And those who have been
thus treated suffer no pain. Hypnotism
is employed even in cases of constipation,
and it seems in some cases to be produc
tive of excellent results. Many cases of
nervous prostration have also been cured
by its application, and even moral deprav
ity has been treated with its use with bene
ficial results. It is also efficacious in in
somnia, hysteria and sciatica.
'â¢AmonÂ« the cases treated by Professor
Bern he im is one of writer's cramp. The
case is as follows: H. C, aged 47. an ac
countant, consulted Professor Bernheim
on the 18th of November. 1880. He was
healthy and strong and in no wise nervous,
but hysterical. Three years before he be
gan to feel symptoms of his trouble. After
writing a few lines all his fingers became
contracted, and he had to desist for a time.
At tirst Jie was able to write again after a
short rest, but gradually the cramp became
worse and he was unable to sign his name.
By means of various devices he contrived
to go on a little longer, but at the time he
consulted Dr. Bernheim he had been com
pelled for three months to write with his
left hand.
"He was hypnotized and at once fell
into a deep sleep. Professor Bexnheim
suggested the disappearance of the cramp.
On awakening he was able to write two
and a half lines without feeling the return
of the cramp. The next day he wrote
eight lines and on November 21 the patient
was able to write a business letter, and
only complained of feeling a heaviness in
The wrist and a tendency to close the lin
gers. On November L' 4 the improvement
was still maintained. In the month of
December a relapse took place ana the
patient again became unable to write more
than a few lines. He left off the treat
ment until January 29, when he aeain
consulted Professor Bernheim. Improve
ment now rapidly set in and progressed,
until March 2 he finally discontinued the
treatment, being perfectly cured. He is
again back in his office and writes all day
long without fatigue or cramp.
'â¢I have been interested in the subject of
hypnotism for a long time, and during my
recent trip abroad I investigated it as
practiced by-such eminent men as Moll of
Berlin, Lieubault of Nancy and Wetter
strand of Stockholm. I was much im
pressed by the briliiantfresults achieved
In this department of medicine, and am
sure that there are a number of physicians
in this City who practice hypnotism just
the same as I do â not as a special method
of treatment to the exclusion of all other
methods, but as an incidental, factor for
the treatment of special diseases.
"It would be ridiculous to assume that
hypnotism is of advantage for all diseases.
On the contrary, its use is limited to cer
tain forms of nervous affections which are
unattended by any organic changes."
BELCHER CONCEET.
A Large Audien.ce Applauds the Popu-
lar Young: Barytone.
Native Sons' Hall on Mason street was
filled to overflowing last nicnt by an en
thusiastic audience that had assembled to
greet the popular young barytone, Frank
H. Belcher, and his friends, in an enter
tainment.
Mr. Belcher, who gave the concert and
who was the hero of the evening, has been
in the East for some time studying and he
intends to leave again shortly for Europe,
in order to qualify himself for the operatic
stage.
His voice showed last night the rapid
progress that he has made of late. At Mr.
Belcher's farewell concert, given about two
years ago. in spite of the sympathetic and
resonant quality of his voice, the tones
were not all produced quite homogene
ously.
Last night it was evident that Mr.
Belcher had found the true quality of his
voice and that he was producing it in an
excellent manner.
His round, velvety tones were equally
even and smooth in all the registers. He
sang witn delightful ease, as well as with
artistic expression. The "Song of the
Helmet" was well suited to the ringing
timbre of Mr. Belcher's voice, and be ren
dered it with plenty of dash and spirit.
As an encore the popular young barytone*
sang "Daddy" with excellent taste and
diction.
Miss Carrie Roma won warm applause for
her singing oi "Scenes That Are Blighted,"
and the Press Club quartet's "The Corn
Is Waving" was another popular number.
Most of the performers in fact won not
only applause, but encores. Dr. W. H.
Sieberst gave some tin-whistle rhapsodies,
Dr. Arthur T. Regensberger played 'cello
solos, Mrs. Olive Reed and Frank Coffin
sang and Bob Mitchell, a caricaturist, and
James Swinnerton, sketch artist, enter
tained the hearers in their various ways.
UNCLE HARRIS' WILL.
Most or till Small Estate Left to a
â¢â '..' .' ; â ' Stranger. ' â¢ '
The will of Samuel Harris Lichtenstein,
better known as Uncle Harris, was filed
for probate yesterday. ' , He leaves . six
tenths of his estate to Miss Elizabeth
Ethel Clough, three-tenths to; his brother,
Benjamin Lich tens teini; and one-tenth, to
his sister, Mrs. Ella Levy. The estate is
valued at ?1GOO, : and consists of a claim for
that amount against his brother. - ' â¢
There is a peculiar comment upon- the
legacy to Miss Clough. The testator says
in his will: .
On account of not being possessed with very
much money, through losses and so forth, 1 am
forced to leave unto Elizabeth Ethel Clough,
the lady I allude to in the above will, all the
money or property of any kind that I own
when I am dead; otherwise I would have re
membered my dear brother, Benjamin Lich
tenstein, ana dear sister, Ella Levy, as I cannot
att'ord to leave Lizzie without but little when I
am dead.
The Lizzie mentioned in the will is not
known to the decedent's relatives.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 1896.
COUNT YAMAGATA COMING
The Field Marshal of Japan
to Arrive on the
Coptic.
IS ON HIS WAY TO MOSCOW.
His Mission Is to Place Korea Under
the Joint Protection of
Japan and Russia.
Field Marshal Yamagata of the Japanese
army will arrive in San Francisco on the
FIELD MARSHAL YAMAGATA.
[From a photograph.]
Oceanic steamship Coptic on March 28.
He will probably remain here a few days
and then continue on his journey to Rus
sia, where he will participate in the cere
monies attending the caronation of Em
peror Nicholas. At this function the
Count will represent the Mikado.
S. Koya. Japanese Consul in this City,
received a cablegram from Tokio yesterday
announcing that the distinguished soldier
and statesman had already sailed for this
port and requesting him to look out for
that personage. He is accompanied by
several officers of the Japanese army. . All
are more of less distinguished as a result
of their service during the late Korean
war.
Count Yamagata achieved great distinc
tion during the late war between China
and Japan and to his daring and military
genius many victories were won by the
forces of the latter country. He is known
as the hero of Ping Yang. It was he who
in person commanded the Japanese troops
at this engagement and to his skill as a
leader as well as to the heroic conduct of
the troops under him was the great victory
due. The result of this defeat to the
Chinese had a good effect in terminating
the war, as it was readily seen that the
Japanese were superior to the enemy in
the arts of war as well as in the arts of
peace and civilization.
Count Yamagata had charge of the land
forces up to the capture of Port Arthur
and distinguished himself all along the
line as a cool and skillful officer. Since
the war he has been engaged in matters
of statesmanship, and the Emperor se
lected him as his special Embassador to
the court of the Czar.
It is known that Russia is very anxious
to get a foothold in Korea. Strenuous
efforts have been made in this direction
by the Czar since the establishment of
peace between China and Japan and the
apparent division of the territory in dis
pute. The late advices from Japan show
that the Emperor of the Flowery King
dom is inclined to foster the friendship of
Russia. This policy the Government of
Japan seems to hare agreed upon, but the
masses of the people are said to regard it
unfavorably. Therefore, while Count
Yamagata goes to Russia ostensibly to
attend the coronation of the Czar it is be
lieved that he is commissioned with the
authority to arrange for placing Korea
under a Japanese-Russian protectorate.
Whether Russia will accede to the plan
suggested is a matter for speculation.
Anyway, it is known that the Korean
question will be dealt with in an amicable
way for some time to come. The Marquis
carries instructions to this end.
Prominent Japanese in this City believe
that the best course for Japan to pursue is
one of peace. They readily acknowledge
that Japan is not in a position to cope with
Russia at this time. Tims there is no alter
native for Japan but to allow matters to
drift aloug in their natural channel. The
idea of a joint protectorate as to the final
settlement of the Korean question is not a
popular one, as it is clear that Russia,
having a superior power, has much the
advantage, and if both countries should
agree upon this line of action would have
a great advantage over her weaker ally.
Mrs. A. Funakoski, wife of the V ice-
Consul of Japan in this City, and who ar
rived here a short time ago, is the daugh
ter of Field Marshal Yamagata. The
Japanese colony will receive their distin
guished countryman on his arrival here
with all the honors due one of his rank.

GAS AND ELECTRICITY.
President of the tias Company Says
Bates to Consumers Will Not
Be Advanced.
The positions respectively of the gas
and electric light companies remain un
changed. No progress was made in nego
tiations yesterday. The representatives of
the Edison corporation have not accepted
the terms presented by the gas company
and the latter has not made further con
cession.
Joseph B. Crockett, president of the San
Francisco Gas Company, said yesterday
that the consolidation would not advance
the cost of light to individual consumers
or to the City, but on the contrary a re
duction might follow the combine.
He fancied that expenses might be re
duced by operating the two companies
under one management and that if a re
duction followed the public would get a
share of the benefits. He said the policy
of the gas company, while providing a
fair return to stockholders, was to make
the cost to consumers as low as possible.
The company had met the competition
offered by the electric Jight plants, but it
had been done by spending money to in
troduce new methods and to encourage
the use of gas as fuel for cooking and
heating.
DEATH OF LATHER MARS
He Was Assaulted by Strikers
and Died From His
Injuries.
Murder Charges Preferred Against
Those Thought to Be Responsible
for the Death.
Charles A. Mars, the lather who was
assaulted by strikers last Tuesday week,
died at his tiome at 765 Harrison street
yesterday morning. The body was re
moved to the Morgue and an inquest will
be held. It is not known that Mars died
from the injuries inflicted by his assailants.
Dr. Barrett held an autopsy on the body
yesterday. It was his opinion that the
blows were not severe enough to cause the
death of a man in ordinary good physical
condition. There was no fracture of the
skull, but there was a slight hemorrhage
about the brain and the arteries and veins
were wasted.
Walter Gallagher, attorney for defend
ants, had two physicians present at the
autopsy to protect the interests of his
clients. These were Dr. Conrad Weil, Po
lice Surgeon,, and Dr. Tennyson Deane,
ex-Police-Snrgeon.
The police were notified of Mars' death
yesterday morning, and in the afternoon
charges of murder were booked at the City
Prison against si* of the striking lathers.
Their name" are Daniel Dunn, James
Holmes, William Patee, John Drugan,
Michael Shine and William J. Dowling.
Dunn, Ilolmes and Patee were arrested
last week on the charge of assault to mur
der and were detained in prison, Judge
Low refusing to accept bonds for their re
lease. Drogan and Shine were arrested on
Monday ana had been confined in the
"tanks," and Dowling was arrested yester
day afternoon. The arresting officers
were Ryan. Tuite and Moriarty.
The deceased was 52 years of age. It
appears tli at he and his two sons were at
work lathing a building at Fourth and
Welch streets when a number of strikers
entered and demanded them to cease
operations. They were charged with tak
ing the job lower than the union scale. They
were on a scaffold at the time the attack
was made and were thrown violently to
the ground and then kicked and beaten.
The deceased was a native of Massachu
setts. His sons were not so seriously in
jured.
On Monday during a conscious period
Dunn, Holmes and Patee were taken to
the old man's bedside. He was asked if he
could identify any one who had struck
him. He pointed to Dunn and said, "He
struck me." "Where did I strike yon?"
asked Dunn, and he replied, "On my lace."
He was unable to identify the other two.
Brought From San Jose.
Detective Anthony brought three prisoners
from San Jose last night and locked them up
in the City Prison. W. J. C. Hudson is accused
by Joseph Sanders of stealing $20 worth of
clothes from him. Harold A. Phillips has a
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement against
him. He is accused by the proprietor of the
Sporting World of misappropriating small
sums ot money. He was released on his own
recognizance by Judge Joachimsen. Sophia
Sauber, 17 years of age, is booked for the Mag
dalen Asylum. She ran away from her home
here and went to San Jose.

they purchase a gas-engine dynamo for a
launch, which that company is building, of
home manufacture.

GRANT MEMORIAL READY
On Sunday the Committee Will
Select a Site for the
Monument.
HAS A CHECKERED STORY.
The Work Is Now Completed and
the Unveiling Will Soon
Take Place.
The Grant memorial is now almost com
pleted, and it will probably only be a ques
tion of days before the monument is
erected in Golden Gate Park.
The bust of General Grant which Rupert
Schmid modeled and had cast in Europe
arrived here some months ago. The
bronze scrolls for ornamenting the design,
which were also cast in Europe, have been
in this City awaiting the completion of the
ornamental base for the bust ever since
the beginning of the winter. The sculptor
stated yesterday that the ornamental de
sign of concrete upon which the bust is to
rest has been cast, and the monument is
now only awaiting the finishing touches to
the base and the affixing of the bronze
scrolls to the design.
The last touches will be given to the
monument out at the park. A site has
not yet been selected, but the committee
of the Grant memorial will meet on Sun
day morning at the Park Museum and
will thence proceed to inspect the various
locations in the park which have been indi
cated as being most suitable for the erec
tion of the monument.
If a decision is arrived at on Sunday it is
probable that the various parts of the
memorial will be transported to the site in
the course of nest week, though no defi
nite arrangements have yet been made for
the unveiling or the monument.
The dimensions of the base on which the
bust is to rest are rather larger than was
intended some months ago. The monu
ment will now measure ten feet from the
ground to the top of the bust, and the base,
which tapers toward the apex, will rest
upon about ten square feet of ground.
There is an especial interest attaching to
the final completion of the Grant me
morial on account of the way in which
the work has lingered and the hoodoo
which at times seems to have hung over
it. The project of erectine a memorial to
General Grant was begun years ago by
many of the leading men in the com
munity, and it was intended at that time
to erect a grandiose. staiue. Money, how
ever, did not come in quite as fast as had
been expected and the first enthusiasm
languished a little.
To add to the appearance of a hoodoo
being over the memorial death began to
remove many of the men who took an in
terest in its erection. J. Flood, Senator
Stanford and a number of other promi
nent promoters of the Grant memorial
having died, the scheme of making the
nnroic statue fell entirely into abeyance
and some years passed, during which the
money already collected began to accumu
late.
At last the survivors of the Grant memo
rial committee decided to utilize the ?2500
they had on hand in erecting a much more
modest monument than had been at first
intended, and Rupert Schmid submitted
designs that were accepted. But the ap
parent ill luck which had pursued the
monument had not entirely vanished.
Isaac Hecht, one of the few remaining
memberd of the committee, was removed
by death, and for some time it was be
lieved that the Grant bust had been lost
on the way from Munich to San Fran
cisco.
The bust arrived at last, however, and
si nee that time there has not been a hitch
in the preparations for completing the
memorial. The unveiling will be an in
teresting ceremony, particularly to those
people who have watched the history of
the Grant statue from its incipiency.
A meeting of the Grant memorial com
mittee was held at the Mills building on
Wednesday last and the following enlarged
committee was elected: Cornelius O'Con
nor, Theodore Reichert, Louis Sioss, Claus
Spreckels, Irving M. Scott, E. J. DePue,
J. B. Stetson, Phil Lihenthal, H. M.
Hecht and James D. Phelan.
WILL SPOIL THE ROAD
Letter From Mayor Sutro to
the Driving Associa
tion.
The Pesthouse Location May Defeat
the Grand Boulevard Ex*
tension.
The promoters of the boulevard to con
nect Golden Gate Park with Ingleside, are
apprehensive that the PesthouÂ»e will be
located on the Almshouse Tract. Should
the Board of Supervisors so locate the in
stitution the Driving Park Association will
abandon the boulevard enterprise, as the
highway would not be worth to the public
the money expended for construction.
The following significant letter was re
ceived yesterday from Mayor Sutro:
San Francisco. March 18, 1896.
To Boutewrd and Driving Asxociat.ionâ Dear
Sir: Keferrlng to conversation between mem
bers of your committee and Mr. Adolph Sutro
on matter of extension of Seventh avenue from
N street southerly and westerly through lands
of Spring Valley Water Works and his lands,
Mr. Sutro is ready to carry out his part of the
Agreement il" the water company will do as
they agreed, provided the IVst house is not
located on the Almsnouse Tract. This proviso
is inserted from the fact that if the Pesthouse
is located on the Almshouse Tract it will prove
a useless expense to improve Seventh avenue
or construct a boulevard as nas been suggested
and provided for by the property-owners in
that neighborhood. Instead of being a drive
way patronized by our citizens and visitors, it
will be shunned by all. Who will be willing
to take his family or friends for a ride there
with the chance of meeting the hospital ambu
lance containing a smallpox patient? Very
truly yonrs,
W. C. Little, Agent for Adolph Sutro.
The sentiments expressed by the Mayor
coincide vith the opinions entertained by
C C. Bemis and Cornelius O'Connor of the
Boulevard Association.

The second annual account of the Stan
ford estate was filed with the probate clerk

Government suit, also a second payment,
$15,000. s Â
It is stated that the only outstanding
claim is one of the California Safe Veposn

due on a $10,000 note made by Thomas L.
Thompson of Santa Rosa, the ex-Con
gressman. Stanford indorsed the note, i
The account states that Thompson is pay- |
ing this note. There is also a statement j
that the claims of Horace W. Caroentier
for $350,000 and of Maria Hall William
son for $50,000 have been withdrawn.
THE TOWER MUST STAY
Members Desire to Remodel the
Emmanuel Baptist
Church.
They Wish No Change Made in the
Building Till After Durrant's
Case Is Over.
Ever since the graceful belfry of Emman
uel Baptist Church on Bartlett street was
protaned by the mysterious and terrible
murders of Blanche Lamont and Minnie
Williams the people who worship in the
desecrated house of prayer have been
anxious to do away with at least that por
tion of the buildinc where the dreadful
crime was perpetrated. This idea has
lately assumed such shape that deter
mined measures were well under way for
the complete remodeling of the front of
the church.
But justice it would appear requires
that the scene of the "crime of the cen
tury" remain for the present unaltered.
There is a possibility of new and unex
pected developments in the Dnrrant trial
in the opinion of the Police Department,
and hence the reafization of the project
set on foot by the members of Emmanuel
Church will be deferred for a time. The
pastor and trustees of the congregation,
while anxious to do away with all that can
remind them and the public of the horrible
tragedy, express themselves a3 being
equally desirous of subserving the ends of
justice, and will take no action in refer
ence to the remodeling of the church
until the Durrant case is finally settled.
According to the plans of the church
corporation the interior of the church will
also be altered to a considerable extent.
The Sunday-school library and the pas
tor's study are to be radically altered so as
to present as few reminders as possible of
the aspect of those portions of the edifice
at the time of the murders. The audito
rium will also be changed in appearance
and a new entrance built, surmounted by
a tapering spire in place of the ill-starred
tower.
Nothing will be done, however, for the
present. Notice has been served upon the
church trustees that if work is com
menced an order of court will be issued
restraining any alterations in the prem
ises. The Police Department allege as a
reason for their action that in case the
Supreme Court should grant Durrant a
new trial* or should he be prosecuted for
the murder of Minnie Williams, it will be
of the greatest importance that the scene
of the crime be left as it was when the
shocking occurrence took place. Mean
while the good people of the church will
have plenty of time to get the funds to
gether for the improvements which they
are bent upon making as soon as the au
thorities will permit.
Illustrated Journalism in the Orient.
"Illustrated journalism," says the Buf
falo Courier, "has at last reached the
Orient. S. S. Sarki3, a Syrian resident of
Cairo, is the editor of a paper, 4 AI
Musheer' ('The Counsellor'), printed in
Arabic, and intensely anti-Turkish in its
views. In two recent issues brought to
the Courier by a Syrian now living in
Buffalo there are cartoons poking fun at
Turkish officialdom. In some respects
these caricatures are crude, but the idea in
one of them is very clear and forcible. So
far as is known these are the first examples
of political caricature ever published in an
Arabic newspaper. Mr. Sarkis, the editor,
fell under the displeasure of the Turkish
authorities a while ago and fled to Eng
land, where, perhaps, he got his ideas of
illustrated journalism."

H. C. BUNNER QUITE ILL
The Man Who Guides the Des
tinies of "Puck" Has
Tuberculosis.
RECEIVES CAREFUL ATTENTION
A Long Career of Hard Work Has
Undermined His Hardy
Constitution.
H. C. Bunner, Jong editor of the New
York Puck, who arrived here about two
weeks ago after a stay in Southern Califor
nia, is quite ill at the Occidental. His ail
ment is tuberculosis. Dr. G. E. Susdorff
is in attendance on him and has been
almost ever since he came here. Mr. Bun
ner thinks this is a Ijetter climate for him
than Coronado, where he went from New
York early in January.
He also tried Los Angeles, but that city
did him no good either. It is cooler here,
and partly on that account the noted edi
tor finds it more comfortable. He is better
in the morning and worse at night. Some
times his temperature goes up to as much
as 104.
Mr. Bunner is very plucky. He bslieves
he will soon be well and Ã¼bl6 ere long to
resume hi? work on the weekly which has
become famous largely by the brilliancy
of his articles and his wise counsel. Mrs.
Bunner is in constant attendance on him.
On their arrival here it was expected
they would be able to frequently see the
Cliff House, Chinatown and other places,
but beyond a drive to Golden Gate Park,
out toward the ocean shore and around
the City a little, they have not been able
to view the surroundings. Mr. Bunner
has worked very hard since the founding
of Puck. Before that he was a reporter
in New York. It is .stated that he did not
work very hard then, but when Mr.
Schwarzmann and Keppler founded Puck
he began a work as editor which aroused
his interests and called forth his most
earnest exertions for the comic paper.
He stood it for a long time, and the in
cessant toil did not seem to work any ill
to him, but at length it began to have its
effect. He could not shake off the pros
tration which followed his best endeavors.
He finally concluded to travel, and did so
extensiveiy. This winter he decided to
spend in California. Mr. Bunner is but 42
years old. ________________

NEW TO-DAY.
Grateful Women Write Us Letters.
From every corner of the country
come thankful letters written by those
who have been lifted into cheerful, vig-
orous, healthy strength by Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription.
Thousands on thousands of women
have been relieved of the nerve-nagging
drag of weakness and pain.
They have been made better wives and
better mothers by having perfect health
restored, and without the humiliating
exposure of examinations so generally
i insisted on by physicians.'
The stereotyped treatment by "local
applications" is seldom necessary, and
there is no reason why modest, sensitive
women need submit to them.
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription is
of purely vegetable composition and is
' perfectly harmless in any condition of
the system. It exerts a wonderful sooth-
ing, healing and strengthening power
over woman's delicate organism. It is
i an invigorating tonic for the whole sys-
i tern, and is almost an infallible specific
I for the peculiar weaknesses, irregulari-
| ties and painful derangements of woman.
To these causes may be traced the
' trouble' of tired, nervous, irritable, worn-
out women. Careless, easy-going doctors
frequently treat their women patients for
biliousness, nervousness, dyspepsia, liver
or kidney troubles, when the real sick-
ness is in the organs distinctly feminine,
and no help can come till they are made
i perfectly strong and healthy in both
j structure and function which is brougth
about in due time, by the use of Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription.
Prescribed for 30 years by Dr. Pierce.
