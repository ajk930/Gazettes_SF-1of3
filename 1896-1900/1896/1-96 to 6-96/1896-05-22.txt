MARCHES INTO MOSCOW
Triumphal Entry of Russia's Ruler
Into the Decorated Northern
Capital.
BRILLIANT DISPLAY MADE BY THE ESCORT

M"SCOW, Russia, May 21.â The great i
triumphal entry of the Emperor and Em
it; to Moscow occurred to-day. Until
to-day the Emperor has not officially been
in the city. In order to see the imposing
spectacle thousand* of anxious sightseers
thronged the streets all last night and
earij secured places of vantage.
Indeed,' at 8 o'clock it was difficult to
move about. The roadway along the line
oi the route had been thickly covered with
sand and the wretched pavement buried
some inches deep. Every class of costume
was visible among the crowds, and any
one skilled in the characteristics of Rus
sian peasantry could have readily indi
cated from what part of the empire tbe
different groups of spectators had come so
Tar:e i were tiieir dresses.
The street was gay with the trappings
on the Venetian mnsts which bore shieids
on which were alternately inscribed the
arms of the Russian provinces and the
monograms of the Emperor and Empress.
No -.raffle was allowed on the line of pro
cession after 3 o'clock this morning and at
a:i early hour troops were marched to
thickly line both sides of the roadway
over the entire route.
For many weary hours the myriads oi
spectators of every rank and class who
lined ti,e routes and tilled the tribunes,
pavilions, platforms and balconies sat or
stood in tueir places waiting for the
ereal event of the day, while the stolid
soldiers, after clearing the roadway, kept
the masses in their places.
At _':30 o'clock the cannon boomed, fol
lowed by eight other shots. This was the
signai for every bell in Moscow to peal
forth and in an instant, led off by tÂ£>e
I*-.?r lower fa tb~C Kremlin, ar.
indescribable jangle of ibe hundreds of i
beils in this much-belled city broke ur>on :
the ear.
The Emperor had left the palace and the
procession had started. It was probably
tne most gorgeous scene that Moscow had
ever beheld.
The cortege was headed by three squad
rons of Circassians and Don Cossacks in
brilliant scarlet uniforms. At their head
rode on a black horse, Prince Dolgomki,
grand master of the ceremonies, in full
uniform, followed by his escort and
mounted drummers and trumpeters of the
Horse Guards.
The Cossacks were followed by a field
marshal leading a squadron of the Czar's
Hussars of the guard, one company each
of the guard regiments of Pavlovsk, then
a squadron of dragoons in dark green, fol
lowed by grenadiers with ancient nelmets,
engineers and chasseurs. After them came
squadrons of household troops, the stand
ards of the various provinces of the em
pire, banners of the army and navy, trade
guilds, huntsmen, court and official dieni
tanes in gorgeous costumes.
Then, preceded by the Imperial Grand
Marshal, Count Pahien, and two squadrons
of cuirassiers, with eagle-crested helmets,
the Emperor himself appeared, dressed in
the fuil general's uniform of the Preoba
jansky Regrpent of the Guards.
The Emperor, who looked very well,
constantly bowed his Salutations to the
cheering multitude, who. upon the first
sight of his Majesty, raised a shout pecu
liar to the Russian, which is a prolonged

roar. This wm taken up on a'l sides and
swelled to a perfect hurricane of sound.
The Czar rode a pure white horse and was
immediately followed by various members
of the Russian imperial family, foreign
sovereigns or their representatives, Minis
ters of the household, Minister of War and
the generals and officers of the suite, a
gorgeous throng in glittering uniforms.
Behind them rode the generals and aides
de-camp of the Emperor and those at
tached to the suites of the foreign princes
\ and representatives. Preceded by a regi
i ment of grenadiers attached to the palace,
. came the Empress in a 'magnificent gilded
: state carriage, drawn by ' four pairs of
cream-colored horses, flanked !by two
eÂ«quires-at-arms and guarded in the rear
by two Cossacks. Similarly escorted came
coaches bearing Princesses and ladies of
the court, their attendants and ladies of
I honor. Court chamberlains and gentlemen
lin waiting followed the carriages. Then
j came detachments of five regiments of the
i guards, two squadrons of cavalry, a squad-
I ron of cuirassiers bearing lances, a squad
ron of Uhlans, and finally numerous
mounted masters of ceremonies.
The crowd closed in at a respectful dis
tance behind the procession and all move
ment was then toward the Kremlin. On
arriving at the Iberian chapel, at the en
trance of the Chinese town, the Emperor
alighted from hie horse, and with the Em
, press ascended the steps to the shrine,
where he was received by the priest of the
chapel with the cross and holy water. The
appearance of the Czar was the signal for

: As the cortege entered the capital a
' salvo of seventy-one great guns was fired
m obedience to a signal from the top of
the Arc de Triomphe, and was immedi
ately repeated upon a signal from the top
of the belfry of the Iver and the steeple of
: the tower of Ivan Veliki.
The Emperor upon entering the capital
was received by the governor-general of
Moscow mounted and escorted by officers
i and aides. Tne governor-general was
joined by the Emperor's suite.' Upon en
tering the Zemlainoi the Emperor was re
ceived by the Mayor and the Council of
I the city of Moscow, delegates of the Cham
ber of Commerce, a committee of artisans,
representatives of the different companies
with distinctive signs and representatives
of the bourse, all formed into a committee
of reception.
Inside the Kremlin the imperial . party
! with the foreign Princes dismounted at
| the gate between the steeple of Ivan
VelitKi and the Cathedral of the Arch
angel Michael, and entered the Cathedral
of the Assumption by the southern gate,
| preceded by the grand master of the coro
nation ceremonies and the grand marshal
of the court.
In the hall of St. Vladimir the Emperor
and Empress received the benediction of
I the archpriest of the Cathedral of the An
nunciation and afterward the imperial
party traversed the halls of St. George and
i St. Alexander and the throne hall, where

most of the party remained, to the hall of I
St. Catherine, where none but those in- â 
timately connected with the imperial
household were permitted to enter.
At the moment of the entry of the im
perial party into the Kremlin a salvo of
100 guns was fired at a signal given by the
commandant of Moscow. The bells of all
the churches in the capital were kept
ringing throughout the (lay.
It is impossible to describe the gorgeous
ness of the scenes in the streets under the
brilliant sunshine. The windows of the
houses along the route of the procession
and the street pavements were literally
packed with people and even the trees
lining the road near Petrovt-ky Palace
were tilled with sightseers. The troops, in
their gala uniforms, in marching to their j
respective positions, and the hundreds of !
exalted personages comprising the guests, i
were cheered by the crowd. Everything i
was life â movements "of color. Bands of i
music played along the whole route. On '
the pavements the first row on each side
of the road was filled with well-known j
people, musical bodies, guilds, bcuool â¢
children, Red Cross nurses, etc. The ]
British Consulate, the only consulate
located along the route of the procession, i
was handsomely decorated with Russian I
and British Sags. The utmost courtesy ,
was shown to members of the press, whose
bad ires enabled them to go everywhere.
The Czar will spend the night at the Al

WITNESSES ARE MISSING
Little Prospect of Prosecuting
Rinehart and Hanley at
Present.
One More Postponement of the Trial
of the Railroad Men Indicted at
Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., May 21.â The cases of
John W. Rinehart, ex-president and Jolin
A. Hanley, ex-traffic manager of the Santa
FÂ«l Railroad Company, charged with vio
lating the interstate commerce law, were
continued to-day by Judge Grosscup until
the October term of court to give the Gov
ernment an opportunity to produce its
witnesses. The ex-officials were indicted
by tte Federal Grand Jury on the testi
mony of John G. Taylor, livestock agent
of the Santa Fe road in I*!< 2, for granting
rebates to certain favored patrons of the
road in 1892. Taylor was in the court
room last Monday ready to give evidence,
but the cases were continued until to-day.
When the cases were called to-day Taylor
was missing and could not be found.
District Attorney Black and Senator
Shields of lowa, representing the Govern
ment, presented an affidavit setting forth
the reasons for asking a continuance. It
stated that Nelson Morris, wanted as a
witness, is in Europe and that W. P. Jen
kins, president of the Hummond Packing
Company, also wanted, could not be found
and was believed to be evading service.
The defendants were chaiged with being
in collusion with him. The affidavit as
serted that the defense probably Knew
something about the sudden disappear
ance of the most material witness, Taylor.
Judge Grosscup refused to iÂ«sue a bench
warrant for Taylor's arrest, out intimated
that if it was found at the October term
that witnesses were being kept in hiding
by the efforts of the defense, there would
be trouble.
Both defendants were present and repre
sented by counsel. Senator Duncan, for
Mr. Rinehart, declared tnat tuere was no
evidence showing the ex-president's knowl
edge of t!:e rebate transactions; but Sen
ator Shields ?a:d the Government would
show a connection between the ex-presi
dent ana Haniev.

HAVANA, Cuba, May 21.â The engage
ment which was reported unofficially yes
terday took place at MootemDo, province
of Matanzas. The rebels made three
attacks upon the Spanish troops, who were
commanded by Colonel Melina, but were
repulsed each time.
The insurgents who formed part of
Gomez's vanguard were commanded by
Collazo, Zayas and others. It was their
intention to encircle the Spanish column,
but the bravery of the troops prevented
them from carrying out the maneuver.
The rebel loss was ten killed and over
twenty wounded. The troops lost one
killed and ten wounded.
Only the Government report of the
fight has been received. Later advices
may put an entire.y different aspect on
the engagement. It is stated on good au

The Sheriff Makes Five More Arrests
for Complicity in the Little.
field Murder.
W SAVERVILLE, Cal., May 21.â The
case of Crow and Van Horn for the mur
der of Jack Littlefield went to the jury at
5:30 last evening. At 10:15 the court was
called, when the foreman of the jury an
nounced that they had arrived at a ver
dict. The courtroom was crowded with
spectators anxious to witness the effect
upon the defendants when the verdfet was
announced, but they were disappointed if
anything lise a sensation was expected.
Crow took his seat in a very quiet manner,
showing not the least degree of nervous
ness, but Van Horn showed that he had
been under a great mental strain since the
time the case went to the jury, and waa
quite nervous as he walked into the court
room and took his seat by the aide of
Crow.
When the clerk arose to read the ver
dict as rendered by the jury the court
room was painfully quiet, as there were
indications apparent to a close observer
that a verdict of guilty in some degree
was about to be read. Juuge Ellison re
quested every one present to refrain from
any demonstration of their approval or
disapproval of the verdict about to be renÂ«
dered. The clerk then read as follows:
"We, the jury impaneled to try the case
of the people of the State of California
versus Bayles Van Horn and John Crow,
defendants do find them guilty of murder
in the second degree and recommend them
to the mercy of the court."
There was not an expression of surprise
visible on the countenance of either de
fendant Crow or Van Hern.
Saturday at 10 o'clock was the time fixed
for pronounciug sentence, and the jury*
was discharged from further duty.
The result of the trial was soon conveyed
to the aged mother of Bayles Van Horn,
when a most painful scene followed. Her
shrieks and moans could be heard for a
block distant, and every one within the
sound of her voice could not refrain from
expressing words of sympathy for the
poor old lady, who felt that her son was
innocent and that the jury could not do>
aught but acquit him.
There was no demonstration of impor
tance on the streets during the night, but
small gatherings of Long Ridge and Round
Valley men could be seen on every corner,
and it was expected that something to mar
the peace of the community would occur
before daylight. During this morning
peace and quietude reigned until about
10:30 o'clock, when a surprise was sprung
on Joe Gregory, Fred Radcliffe, Thomas
Haydon, John Vinton and Buck Lacock
by the Sheriff placing them under arrest
and putting them behind the prison bars,
with the exception of Buck Lacock, who is
still confined to his bed with bronchitis.
These five were charged with the murder
of Jack Littleheld. The preliminary ex
amination will probably be set for Mon
day moning.
The verdict of the jury gives general satÂ»*

SUGGESTIVE OF
CLOSING DAYS
Conference Reports Received
and Acted On in the
Senate.
THAT DEEP-SEA HARBOR
No Agreement Yet Reached in
Reference to San Pedro and
Santa Monica.
BUTLEE'S BCKD RESOLUTION
It Causes an Exchange of Sharp
Language Between Allen
and Hill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.â 1n
some respects the proceedings in the Sen
ate to-day were suggestive of the closing
days of a session. Conference reports
were being considered and acted upon dur
ing most of the day. Firs; came the river
and haroor bill, and after a short discus
sion the report wÂ«s formally disagreed to
in order to have an item regarding Bruns
wick harbor, Ga., restored to the bill.
Later in the day the report was asain pre
sented with the Brunswick matter ar
ranged satisfactorily, but with the items
as to the deep-sea harbor in Southern Cal
ifornia still undisposed of in conference.
The report was agreed to as far as it went
and a new conference was ordered on the
San Pedro and Santa Monica question.
Frye (R.) of Maine occupied the chair
to-day as chairman pro tern.
The conference report on the river and
harbor bill was taken up, all the questions
between the two honses being settled in
conference, except the controversy be
tween San Pedro and Santa Monica for the
deep-sea harbor in Southern California
aud the harbor at Wilmington, Cal., on
which disagreements were reported.
Bacon (D.) of Georgia opposed the adop
tion of the conference report unless the
item as to the harbor at Brunswick, Ga.,
was restored to the bill. The conference
report was thereupon formally disagreed
to and a further conference ordered.
The conference report on the legislative,
executive and judicial appropriation bill
was taken up for consideration. It was
opposed by Platt(R.) of Connecticut and
Hill (D.) of New York on account of the
action taken in conference as to United
States Commissioners.
The conference report was defended by
Cullom (R.) of Illinois.
Finally the vote was taken and the con
ference report was disagreed to â ayes 26,
noes 33.
A partial conference report on the In
dian appropriation bill was presented and
agreed to, and a further conference was
ordered.
Butler (Pop.) of North Carolina moved
that the Senate proceed to the considera
tion of the bill introduced by him on Jan
uary 30, "to prohibit the further issuance
of interest-bearing bonds without the con
sent of Congress."
Hill rose to make some suggestions ad
verse to the motion, but objection was
made by Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada, as the
motion was not debatable.
"Then I move that the Senate do now
adjourn," said Hill, "and I ask for the ayes j
and noes on that motion."
The vote was taken and the motion to
adjourn was rejectedâ ayes 13. noes 35.
A motion to proceed to executive busi
ness was then interposed by Chandler.
The vote on this motion was: Ayes 10,
noes 32.
No quorum having voted, the presiding
officer ordered that the roll be called.
Pending the call, however, unanimous
consent was given to Pettigrew (R.) of
South Carolina to present the conference
report on the Indian appropriation bill in
order to have it printed and taken up to
morrow.
Hill was prompt in seizing the advantage
which the reception of the report gave
him and he demanded the reading of the
reportâ a demand in which he was bus
tained by the presiding officer (Faulkner
of West Virginia).
Allen, after some general skirmishing,
alluded to the filibustering that, was going
on with the evident purpose of preventing
the taking up of Butler's bill. He was
quickly interrupted by Hill, who asked
the chair brusquely: "What is the ques
tion and who gives him the right to speak,
and gives it to no other Senator?"
"1 have a right to speak," Allen broke
in, "and I think I will do it, too. Others
have got rights here as well a3 you."
The presiding officerâ l will state very
frankly that having ruled on the question,
there is nothing now before the Senate
except the motion of the Senator from
New Hampshire, to proceed to executive
business; and on that the Senator from
Nebraska has the floor, by unanimous
consent.
"Did he request it?" Hill asked.
"He did not," was the reply of the pre
siding officer. "He rose to a point of
order."
"Yes," said Allen, "and he is still stand
ing on his point of order."
"Well, it is a pretty slight support,''
said Hill contemptuously.
"The chair recognizes the Senator from
Nebraska," the presiding officer said.
"When did he request unanimous con
sent to speak?" Hill asked.
"The Senator from Nebraska," the chair
responded, "has not formally made the re
quest. The chair failed to call him to
order, and no Senator called him to order,
and therefore the chair assumed that the
Senator from Nebraska was speaking by
the unanimous consent of the Senate, and
the chair will so hold until the Senator
from Nebraska surrenders the floor."
"Then the point of order," Hill admitted,
"will not lie."
Allen went on to say that the violation
of the unanimous consent would not have
taken place if the bill had been introduced
by a Republican or a Democrat. It was
because the Senator from North Carolina
happened to be a member of the Populist
party, and because the bill was supposed
to be a Povuiist measure that unanimous
consent was violated.
"I am glad," Hill interposed, "to hear it
announced distinctly as a Populist meas
ure."
"\es, sir," said Allen, defiantly.
Butler rose to make a remark, but was
interrupted by Hill, who said he had no
objection to the Senator from Nebraska
continuing, but tbat he did cot believe
that both Senators should have the floor
at the same time.
Ailen said that he yielded to the Senator
from North Carolina for a question.
Butler alluded to Allen's remark that
the filibustering was aue to tbe fact tbat
he (Butler) was a Populist, and said that
the same filibustering would take place if
the bill had been introduced by a Demo
crat or by a Republican. The filibustering
took place because the bill was right.
"I think so, too," Allen chimed in.
"The filibustering is against a just meas
ure," Butler added.
Allen was making some additional re
marks when Hill broke in with, "Let them
have all the rope they want, Mr. Presi
dent."
"1 understand very well," said Allen,
severely, "that my talking would assist
the Senator from New York to kill time,
but I don't understand, and I never ex
pect to live to be old enough to under- 1
stand, how a distinguished Senator who j
occupies a chair in this chamber can feel
himself at liberty in a public manner to
violate openly a unanimous-consent agree
ment because a bill does not originate
with a member of his party."
"I desire to know," Hill asked, angrily,
"vvhethe-' the Senator intends to refer to
me when he speaks of violating a unani
mous-consent agreement?"
"What does the Senator want to know
for?" Allen inquired.
"Simply cu/iOsity," was the ironical re
ply.
"Mr. President," said Allen, in answer
to Hill's question, "I meant the Senator
from New York."
"Then I desire to say right here," Hill
responded wrathfully, "that the statement
is false. I have violated no unanimous
consent of the Senate; none whatever. I
have simply insisted on my rights, and I
have been sustained by the chair."
"I don't propose," Allen coolly re
marked, "to say that the Senator's state
ment is false, or anything of that kind;
but the Senator from New York never will
live long enough to convice me that his
conduct is honest in making the objec
tion."
"That may be," replied Hill, "and I
don't care to live long enough to convince
you. I stand upon my personal rights
and have violated no unanimous-consent
agreement."
What is the question before the Senate?"
Gray (D.) of Delaware asked.
"The reading of the conference report,"
was the an3wer of the presiding officer,
and he directed the clerk to proceed with
the reading.
After the conference report was read and
ordered printed the obstruction tactics
were continued by Hill and Chandler and
a haif dozen roll calls w*re had, the aver
age result being 12 to 34 on various dila
tory motions.
This course was interrupted, however,
in order to have the conference report on
the river and harbor bill again presented
and agreed to. It embraced an agreement
on the Brunswick (Ga.) appropriation, but
it left still open the question of the deep
sea harbor in Southern California, on
which a further conference was ordered.
It was also interrupted by messages from
the House with the immigration bill,
which was referred to the committee on
immigration and with the vetoed pension
bill, which was referred to the committee
on pensions.
Finally, when the Senate had grown
rather weary of the filibustering proceed
ings and when the Sergeant-at-Arms bad
been ordered to report the attendance of
absent members Butler moved an adjourn
ment, stating that he would move to take
up the prohibitory bond bill early to-mor
row, and the Senate at 6:25 adjourned
until to-morrow.
OVER THE PRESIDENT'S FETO.
Postage of the Bill Granting a Pension
to Franei* E. Hoover.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.â 8y a
vote of 196 to 47 the House to-day passed
over the President's veto the bill granting
a pension of $50 a month to Francis E.
Hoover, late of the Twenty-third Indiana
Regiment of Volunteers. A debate of two
hours preceded the vote, Kirkpatrick (R.)
of Kansas, Wood (R.) of Illinois and
Willis (R.) of Delaware advocating the
passage of the bill and Erdman (D.) of
Pennsylvania, Loud (R.) of California and
Bartlett (D.) of New York in favor of sus
taining the veto. All the Populists and
Republicans generally voted for the bill,
aud the Democrats against it. The follow
ing Republicans, however, voted to sus
tain the veto: Loud of California, Raney
of Missouri, Quijrgand Wadsworth of New
York, and the following Democrats to pass
the bill: Cockrell of Texas, Cummings of
New York, Layton and Sorg of Ohio and
Stokes, Strait and Talbert of South Caro
lina.
This was preceaed by a half hour's state
ment by Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio regarding
a telegram from Washington to the Cin
cinnati Tribune, which "lined Lim up
with the Reed men," in voting to oppose
the reporting of any reciprocity bill from
the Committee on Ways and Means. Pass
ing by the "lining up with the Reed men"
by the observation that he might be found
in worse company, Grosvenor denied the

NO PENSION FOR HER
Why Cleveland Vetoed the Bill Granting
Relief to Lydia A. Taft.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.-PreÂ«i
-dent Cleveland returned to the House yes
terday, without his signature, a bill grant
ing a pension to Lyaia A. Taft. He ex
plained that Taft served as a private in a
Connecticut regiment for a period of
nearly three years. No application for a
pension was made by him, although he
Jived until 1891, when he died in a Con
necticut Soldiers' Home.
"No suggestion," the President states,
"is made that he incurred any disability
in the service or that his death was in any
manner related to such service.''
In 1882, nearly twenty-four years after
her marriage to Taft, and seventeen years
after his discharge from the army, she ob
tained a divorce from him, upon the
ground of his habitual drunkenness and
failure to support her.
The message continues: "It is now
proposed, five years after the soldier's
death to pension the widow, the wife who
was divorced from him at her own hn
stance, fourteen years ago; who voluntar
ily renounced a wife's relation with all its
duties and all its riehts, and who, by her
own act, placed herself beyond the possi
bility of becoming the widow of her sol
dier husband."

MEETING OF BAPTISTS.
liutii.rKÃ lw-jorr thy. VuhHttUxnrf and
American Historical BoeietieTi
ASBURY PARK, N. J., May 21.â A
steady rain this morning did not dampen
the ardor of the Bapti3ts who are here, to
the number of 2000 or more, and the audi
torium was comfortably filled when Presi
dent Crozier called the assembly of the
Baptist Publication Society to order. Pro
fessor H. C. Vedder of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the committee on publishing
department, made the opening address,
and read the report of his committee. He
was followed by the Rev. W. H. Geist
weit of Minnesota, who reported for the
committee on missionary department.
Ex-Senator Doolittle of Wisconsin urged
the publication of a work on the United
States of America in the light of prophecy
as well as history. The Senator's proposi
tion aroused opposition and was voted
down.
George F. Stevens of Cincinnati said that
a large proportion of the receipts of the
publication society was from sales of pub
lications from other houses. This caused
a breeze and was denied from the plat
form. Mr. Stevens went on to say that
the 800,000 Baptists of the North buy few
of the books published by the society and
read less.
H. S. Hopper reported for the finance
committeo that fully $200,000 will be
needed in order to carry on the work as

PROSPECT OF WINIER WHEAT
Report* Show a favorable Outlook in
Several States.
TOLEDO, Ohio, May 21.â Daring the
past three days the grain firm of C. A.
King & Co. has received 3436 crop reports
from grain-dealers and millers. Present
prospects for winter wheat are very favor
abie in Kansas and most of Michigan.
Missouri and Illinois have fair prospects.
Indiana is growing worse, and promises
less than three-quarters of an average
crop, owing mostly to the Hessian fly,
which is also doing harm in some sections
of Michigan. Ohio continues a trifle more
than half a crop. Eicht hundred and four
of the reports say the prospect now is ex
cellent; 756 for an average crop; 247 a trifle
beiow an average; 405 three-quarters of a
crop, 478 two-thirds, and 1108 half a crop.
Five hundred and ninety say less than
half a crop, and come mostly from Ohio
and Indiana. Prospect averages a trifle
worse than two weeks ago. Recent rains
have beun beneficial, but some sections
still compiain of drought.
Kansas and Missouri show a slight im
provement. Kansas suffered a little from
hot winds and hail. Missouri reports
some chinch bugs. Illinois and Ohio
show no material change. Illinois has
numerous chinch bugs, but the outlobk
otherwise is very favorable. Indiana has
suffered materially from the Hessian fly
and drought. Ohio has had very little in
sect damage. Michigan reported an ex
cellent prospect until a few days ago when
some sections say Hessian fly has caused
material damage. The harvest promises
to average about ten days earlier than
last year, judging from the present out
look.

INTERSTATE COMMERCE LAWS.
Protest Against a Proposed Change by
Amending a flection.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.â The
Vice-President this afternoon laid before
the Senate the resolutions of the eighth
annual convention of Railroad Commis
sioners, held in this city May 19 and 20.
The Commissioners protest against the
change proposed to be made in the inter
state commerce act by amending section
10 so as to eliminate imprisonment and
provide punishment by fine only, as pro
vided in a bill now pending in Congress.
This section has only been given force and
effect within a recent period by a Supreme
Court decision, and the resolution asserts
tbat it is better to give it a fair trial be
fore changing its provisions.
Discrimination in rates is, the memorial
asserts, a crime for which the railroad offi
cial and shipper should receive the sever
est puuishment known to the law. It is
the opinion of the memorialists that if
experience shows the law as now framed
to be ineffective and inoperative, greater
and severer penalties should attach to its
violation. Ft this reason the memorial
ists state that they are opposed to any
amendments to the interstate commerce
law until it be so amended as a whole that
under the light of the recent decisions the
rights and interests of the people in gen
eral are properly safeguarded under it,
the duties and responsibilities of the car
riers are carefully fixed and defined in it,
and the power and authority of the Inter
state Commerce Commission are properly
established by it.
AS TO THE NORTHERN PACIFIC.
Proposed Change* in the Bill to Facili
tate Jtcorganization.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.-The
sub-committee of the Houae Judiciary
Committee, to which was referred the
Hartman joint resolution to facilitate the
reorganization ol the Northern Pacific
Company, will probably complete their
discussion of the measure at to-morrow's
meeting. The sentiment developed at to
day's meeting was unfavorable to the pro
visions which exempt from sale mineral
and timber lands. The committee feels
that the company may properly retain
any coal mines now In operation by it
where the output is used by the corpora
tion, but it is not disposed to extend the
exemption further. If the debate to-day
be taken as an indication of the commit
tee s temper this change will be made in
the resolution when it is reported to the
full committee, as will probably be the
case within the next few days. Beyond
this the other changes, it is thought, will
not be material.
For Uniform Freight Rate*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21.â The
Senate Committee on Interstate Com
merce to-day ordered a favorable report on
the bill indorsed by the National Board of
Trade, providing for a uniform classifica
tion of freight. The classifications estab
lished by the Interstate Commerce Com
mission are to be obligatory upon roads en
gaged in interstate commerce and failure
to observe them is made punishable under
the tenth section of the interstate com
merce act.

WON BY THE SATANITE
JTad So Trouble in Defeating the Bri-
tannia and Ailsa.
LONDON, Ekg., May 21.â A representa
tive of the United Press telegraphs from
Gravesend that in the yacht races of the
new Thames Yacht Club to-day the Sata
nita, without any bilge and with nearly
two tons less keel than she had in the
Mediterranean, made common barges of
the Britannia and the Ailsa in the race
over the fifty-mile course.
Though the oatanita is ten feet lonper
than the Britannia by the British rule,
both vessels are virtually the same. The
Satanita was sailed badly on the side, but
she went like a torpedo-catcher. The
Aiisa had her main sail reefed, but the
others carried full sail and all had jib
headed top sails hoisted.
In the free reach of twenty miles the
Satanita beat t tie Britannia and the Ailsa
nearly twenty minutes, and in going be
fore the wind coming back she douDled
her lead.
The Niagara's altered depth has lessened
her stability. The Niagara got a bad
start and had to recross the line, yet she
led at the half distance.
The Satanita won tbe race for the large
raters, Britannia second and Ailsa third.
In the race for the small raters the Niag
ara was beaten by Frank Jameson's new
yacht, the Saint.
NO CHARGES PREFERRED
Why the Committee of the Mis
sionary Boards Saw the
President.
Minister Terrell's Name Mentioned
Kindly, but a Greater Diplomat Is
Desired for Turkey.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 21.â William
E. Dodge, one of the committee of the mis
sionary boards who had a conference last
Friday with President Cleveland, at which
it was said certain charges were preferred
against United States Minister Terrell,
accusing him of misrepresenting this Gov
ernment in Constantinople, was seen to
day by a representative of the United
Press, to whom he explained the errand of
the committee to Washington. He said:
"A committee of gentlemen interested
in the work of American missionaries in
Turkey went to Washington last week to
confer with the President and the State
Department in regard to the position and
work of missionaries and American socie
ties in Turkey, and to talk over the treaty
rights on the subject. The Rev. Henry G.
Dwight, who is thoroughly conversant
with these affairs, was invited to accom
pany us, and the President asked Minister
Terrell to be present at the conference.
Simply an informal talk was liad upon
these questions, and no conclusions w. re
reached. Minister Terrell's name was
mentioned but once, in the kindliest way
and in warm words of praise.
"The Rev. Mr. Dwight told of the good
work Mr. Terrell had done for this Gov
ernment in the Sultan's domain, and (s
-pecially praised him for the beneficial aid
he had afforded American missionaries iv
Turkey. Not an unkind word was spoken
of Mr. Terrell.
"During an incidental conversation
about the Turkish court ii was suggested
by some one that, in view of the peculiar
condition of affairs in that country, it
might be well in future to select one of our
most thoroughly trained diplomats for the
post. From this remanc may have arisen
the story concerning the charges. There
was no intention to disparage Mr. Terrell's
work as Minister to Turkey and the sug
gestion was made in a friendly spirit."
Dr. Jusiah Strong, also one of the com
mittee who saw. the President on this oc
casion, was present during the interview
with Mr. Dodge and acquiesced in the lat
ter's statement.
THICK OF A HOTEL KEEPER.
During a Dispute He Threw Out a Valise
and Valuable Gems Were Spilled
and Stolen.
DENVER, Colo., May 21.â Last Tues
day night Professor Paul Ricker and wife
of Olympia, Wash., arrived in this city
and registered at the Grand Central Ho
tel, near the depot. On the following day
in settling the bill a dispute occurred and
the proprietor became enraged to such an
extent that he snatched a small satchel
belonging to Mrs. Ricker and attempted
to throw it over the counter. It flew out
the door instead and broke open on the
sidewalk, scattering the contents over the
pavement. In the Batchel Mrs. Bicker
states were jewels and money to a value
exceeding $2000 and nothing of value was
recovered, some one whom Ricker thinks
was a confederate of the hotel man having
escaped with the property. Thia afternoon
W. M. Van Horn, the proprietor, was ar
rested upon a charge of grand larceny.
Professor Ricker was formerly Assistant
State Geologist of California.

liminary trial of Ned Hemphill for the
murder of Mattie Peterson, which was to
have been held at Unionville to-day, was
postponed because of the large number of
farmers in town who, it was understood,
would attempt to lynch him. The officers
spirited the prisoner away and got him
back to the Centerville Jail safely. The
attorneys waived examination for him.
The revolver which it is supposed was
used to kill the girl was found in the cel
lar of Hemphill's house to-day.

gressuian Bryaa to-day won his suit in the.
District Court enjoining the city from
issuing over $50-0,000 in gold refunding
bondsf Mr. Bryan did not question the
legality of the" bonds except so far as the
gold provision was concerned, ne main
taining that coin bonds were sufficient.
Jud^e Holmes sustained this view in so^
far as it referred to payment in gold, and
made the injunction perpetual. The case
may be appealed.

at Buffalo.
BUFFALO. N. V.. May 21.â A section
of the Seneca-street front of Brown's build
inr coliapsed at 9:20 o'clock this morning,
burying a score of people in the mint.
George Metz, a barber, and Jennie Griffith,
cashier in the barber shop, are dead; Wil
liam F. Btraub, a contracted is known to
be in the ruins, and a dozen oThers are
more or less injured, one of whom will
probably die.
Those at the hospital are: Jacob Lang
don, barber, scalp torn and body contused;
William Alexander, steam-titter, scalp
wounds and body bruised; Jacob Rick
man, barber, bruised about the body and
head ; L. S. Hawke, carpenter, skull frac
tured, may die; James Adams, mason, 12

hip; Michael O'Brien, carpenter, wrenched
back and scalp wounds; Joseph Bullard,
plasterer, injured internally ; Edward Mur
phy, plasterer, injured internally, right
arm injured; Fritz Formal, German la
borer, body bruised.
Brown's building stood on the corner of
and Seneca streets, and for years the
Western Union Telegraph Company had
occupied the ground floor corner as a busi
ness office and all of the fourth floor as an
room. The buiMing was filled
s, many of which were occupied,
and on the ground floor on both Main and
Seneca str ets were stores occupied by
.TH-.
Western Union left the building a
few weeks ago and the owners of the block
began the work of remodeling and
thening it. On the Seneca-street
" orkmen were engaged in putting in
aen columns and beams and new
for them.
Nos. 8 and 10 Seneca street were un
occupied, the principal alterations being
made at tnat point. No. 12 was occupied as
er-ahoo by George Sienert. and 14 by !
James Clegg-' jewelry-store and Thomas j
news stand. The offices on the !
rs above were nearly all tenanted, and j
:her ttere were probably fifty people â 
in the col/apsed section. The walls fell
- -'... talfhg doTrn roof and ceiling ;
with them.
Iron columns were twisted aB though \
were soft wires. Pillars of brick
crumbled to piece*, not strong enough to
re<=ift the strength of the weight that had
fallen upon them. Here and there could
be seen people who bad not been caught
in tiie failing debris, rushing to a place of
safety. The outer wall fell into the street,
g (hose who had not had time to es
cape. A cloud of dust arose from the de
ciding the ruins from sight and cov
ering the people in the street.
The Fire Department was called, and,
with the police and workmen who came
ng to the fallen building, the work of
rescue was begun. Some of the people
who had been in the bu:iding were saved
almost miraculously, having been penned
in by the falling timbers and walls. They
were taken out as speedily as possible and
given surgical attention.
In Sienert's barber-shop were nine bar- '
ber;, the girl cashier and several custom
ers. When the crash came all made a
rush for the front door, but the falling â 
bricks drove them to the rear, where an j
ft. ley leads to Washington street. Those I
Bt rushed inÂ»o the alley, only to be
;â¢â¢ the falling rear walls, under which j
Metz was buried and killed. The others
crouched in a corner of the shop until tne
avalanche ceased, when they made their
way out. The cashier had her desk in the j
front of the shop behind a wire caze. She
was unable to get out of it in time to join
the others, and perished beneath the fall- \
ing wr.
The experience of the occupants of No.
14 was somewhat similar to those in the
barber-shop, but all escaped without in-
In Nos. 5 and 10 were probably
twenty workmen, including steam-titters,
ironworkers, carpenters and plasterers,
and it was here that the crash was greatest
Nearly all of the men were caught in the
falling walls and floors and buried in the
ruins. The tenants on the upper floors
had many narrow escapes, bnt so far as
known all of them succeeded in making
their escape.
A search for the missing began, and the
ruins were worked over in the hope of find
ing the bodies of Contractor Straub and
Jennie Griffith, who were known to be
somewhere among the mass of wfreckace.
â¢ y before 6 o'clock the body of Miss
Griffith was found and removed to the
ir-or^'ue. Straub's body has not yet been
found.
The Commissioners of Public Works will
make a thorough investigation of the acci
dent.

NKW YnRK. N. V.. May 21.â A Herald
I from Washington says: An at
tache of the American legation at Tokio
writes tbat tbe Japanese Minister of
Marine by the command of the Emperor
will soon formally prefer a request for tbe
admission of eight young noblemen to the
United Btatet Naval Academy. Among
the proposed students will be a son of
Field Marshal General Count Yamagata,
commanding the imierial array of Japan:
a son of Vice-Admiral Ito, who was gradu
ated in the ciass of I*-T2 at the United
States Naval Academy, and a nephew of
the Emperor.
Eleven Japanese officers have been grad
dated at Annapolis. Vice-Admiral I;o, who j
distinguished him?e!f at Yalu last Sep- !
lember, and Rear- Admiral >lat.<hushima, !
head of the Imperial Naval Ordnance De- :
part nient, and on & of the best mathema
- that Annapolis ever turned out,
were so graduated.
All of them hold high positions at home
and are among the most accomplished of
'he Mikado's officers. It is the policy of
the Japanese Emperor to â¢ducate his ofli
cers of the army at St. Cyr, the first mili
tary school in Europe, and his naval
oflicers in America.
â â¢The Japanese cadets,'" says Captain
Sampson, "are unusually brigut, excelling
in ordnance and mathematics. They are
very gentlemanly and acquire knowledge
very rapidly. \\ v hen you remember that
within a year of their arrival they have
acquired our language sufficiently to be
abie to understand technical works writ
ten in it and can recite from t ese works
it will be readily perceived that they must
be of no ordinary capacity."
At the Sf-cretary's office it was stated
that while the formal request for these
gentlemen's admission had not been re
ceived, the department has had an intima
tion of its coming from our Minister, and
it will be readily granted.
SHIP ON FIRE.
The Horsa Puts Into Southport. N. C. After
a Thrilling Experienceâ The
Master Lost.
WILMINGTON, N. C. May 2L-The
â¢British ship Horsa, with a cargo of pine
appies and bananas, from Jamaica May
13. bound to New York, arrived to-day at
Southport in distress, having been on fire.
It is completely gutted from stem to amid

Captain Mclntosh, who brought tbe ves

between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning
and it is supposed he fell overboard.
Captain Mclntosh. who was first mate,
says the Horsa left Port Morant, Jamaica,
on the 13th inst. with a full cargo and
crew of twenty men. A. 6 p. m. on the
16th a cry of fire was raised.
All hands were mustered and went to

RISE OF THE MISSOURI
Serious Floods Are Threatened
in the Vicinity of St.
Louis.
Northern Minnesota Is Also Under
Water and Prairies Are Turned
Into Lakes.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 21.â The rain
which has fallen almost steadily through
out Missouri since last Sunday continues,
and great anxiety is felt for the safety of
the people living along the bottom lands
of the Missouri. Gasconde and O?a?e
rivers. In the Western and southern por
tions of the State highway bridges have
been washed away by dozens. Nearly
every stream is flowing over its banks and
the rain is stil! falling. The situation is
growing alarming. The danger line here
is expected to be reached to-morrow night.
If it continues at thi* late for a few days
more the big flood of 18fÂ»3 will be outdone.
A climax was reached in the local storm
at 6 o'clock to-night. The clouds that had
dropped occasional showers all day cen
tered over tne city and a deluge of rain
and hail fell. Tbe hailstones were un
usually large and considerable damage re
sulted. The river continues to rise rap
idly. At S o'clock the water touched the
30-foot mark and was advancing. The
Government Weather Service sent out
warnings to property-owners along the
river front an-i to-night hundreds of men
are at work removing lumber and other
endangered merchandise to places of
safety. Every vessel in the harbor baa
steam up. It now seems assured that the
disastrous floods of former years will be
rivalled.
CROOKSTON. Minx., May 21.âNorth
ern Minnesota is under water. There has
been nothing like it for many years. The
prairie has become a lake and farms have
been transformed into archipelagoes. The
situation is truly discouraging for the
iarge agricultural interests in the upper
Red River Valley, both in Minnesota and
in North Dakota. One can start from
Warren. Minn., in a boat and row to Hal
lock, forty miics north, and not be obliged
to portage the boat to exceed three miles
for that distance.
When it is remembered* that this coun
try is usually dry prairie, too dry at times
for the best crop results.it is possible to
cttch a glimpse of the condition in that
section at this time. The crop outlooit is
exceedingly unpromising in the northern
counties.

THE PRISON AT PRETORIA
were originally sentenced to death for
high treason, is regarded with disfavor by
the public here and has caused a great re
vulsion of feeling among the Afrikanders.
It is felt that the Government in not
liberating the prisoners has lost the chance
of uniting the opi>osine sections of tbe
population in tne Transvaal and that the
evil conseqnenoefl will be incalculable. It
is credibly stated that President Kruger
for three days persistently urged tr.e
Executive Council to substitute tines for
imprisonment in the cases of all the pris
oners, but that he was overborne by a
majority of the Council.
LONDON, Exg.. May 21.â The Times will
to-morsow publish a long dispatcn from
Pretoria detailing the excitement arising
from the heavy sentences imposed upon
the members .of the reiorm committee.
The dispatch says that the wildest kind of
talk is indulged in, and that the situation
is critical. Tne foreign residents of the
Transvaal are dismayed. They are con
vinced that Great Britain will not meddle
with their affairs or with the sentences of
the prisoners.
The annual gathering of prominent men
interested in South Africa took place to
night at the Hotel Metropole. where the
usual banquet was given. The Right Hon.
Jo^epu Cnamberlain, Secretary of State
for the Colonies, presided. Among those
present were Sir William Dunn, Consul-
General of Cape Colony, and Wal
ter Peace, Agent-General of Natal.
Mr. Chamberlain made a speech, in the
course of which he said he regretted that
little progress had been made in the at
tempts to reconcile the Dutch and English
in South Africa. He confessed that he
was disappointed by the decision of the
Transvaal Government regarding the sen
tence of the leaders of the reform com
mittee, especially because he had always
trusted in President Kruger's magna
nimity, believing that he was never ani
mated by vindictive feeling against the
men who, whatever their errors, had by
their energy and enterprise, created the
Transvaal's prosperity. Mr. Chamberlain
declared that he could not discuss the
matter further, but the policy of the Gov
ernment had already been declared and
would not be changed. This declaration
was greeted with cheers.
In the HAuse of Commons to-day Mr.
Chamberlain. Secretary of State for the
Colonies, announced that the Colonial Of
fice had received a telegram from Presi
dent Kruger of the Transvaal Repuolic,
stating that the jai! regulations would be'
immediately modified so as to increase the
comfort of the reform committee pris
oners.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 21.-
The Transvaal Government, it is learned.
a.vain complained a few days ago to Sir
Hercules Robinson, the British High Com
missioner, regarding the reported assem
bling of 2500 British troops and forty can
non between Mafeking and Ramutsa. near
the Transvaal frontier. Sir Hercules Rob
inson in his reply gave the details of the
smaller force which had been sent to Maf
king in accordance with the previous noti
ficaiion sent to the Transvaal authorities
which force was intended to be used in
quelling the Matabele revolt. Sir Her
cules also suggested that the Transvaal
Government should prosecute the person
who gave the false information oa which
in complaint was based.
A DISMAL PORTREOS
Pretoria Prison Wherein John Hay
Hammond and Other* Are Confined.
"The fortress wherein Hammond and
his companions are to be confined," said
J. A. Harrington to a Call man yesterday,
"is a dismal and unsalubrious place. It >
was built by President Pretoria, whence
it derived its name.
"The pnson is about 100 feet square,
surrounded Dy a high stone wall loopholed
all around on the four sides and flunked
on the front or entrance side by two towers,
which defend the gate witn its foss and
portcullis, which is lowered by a chain
worked on tbe inside. The accommoda
tions for prisoners, black and white, are the
earthen floor and blankets v.-hich prisoners
are allowed to supply themselves with.
"The food allowed each prisoner is a
pound of cornmeal porridge and a half
pint of sour miik every morninK at 7
o'clock; at 10 a.m. a half-pound of rye
bread, washed down by a plentiful supply
of brackish water. Dinner, or as the Eng
lish call it, tiflin, is served at noon, and
the bill of fare comprises: Boiled beef of
work oxen, or rather, oxen which couldn't
work any Liore, half a pound of potatoes
or black rye bread, a cup of black coffee
and water. At 6 o'clock comes supper,
which consists of corn-meal porridge, soup
of vegetables and bread broken up in it.
At night ground serves for a bed, the
clothes and boots for pillows, with an ac
companiment of fleas, mosquitoes and
other vermin. For music to lull them to
sleep they may have the snoring of a
dozen or more Kaffirs, some groaning
from scars on their lacerated backs, in
flicted as punishment for having trans
gressed the Roman Dutch law of master
and servant. For ventilation there are
three small windows cut lengthway about
three feet by twelve inches at the top of
the wall near the roof. There are odors
and smells in abundance.
"This is the prospect before the convicted
members of the reform committee of Jo
hannesburg, and fifteen years of it. too.
They will never survive it. Hammond
and the other Americans have *ny sym-
pathy, but the Englishmen, who never j
show mercy to any political prisoners, de
serve all they get. They will have time
now to think of the poor devils of Irish
men who were for more than twenty vear>
lingering in Millbank. Some one ought to I
be good enough to send them for reading !
matter John Mitchel's Jail Journal or \
Michael Davitt's Notes on Millbank."
Mr. Harrington resided on the Transvaal
for several years, bei: c artist and inter
preter for a mining company in the Ley
denburg district, and is familiar with tbe
country and the people.
CROPS AND CATTLE DEAD

REPUBLICANS ALSO EXERCISED
In Indiana Managers Are Fearful of
the White Metal Being Made
an Issue.
CHICAGO, 111., May 21. â A special
from Indianapolis, Ind., says: The Re
publican managers are greatly exercised
over tbe prospect of free silver being made
the issue in this State, although C!.air
man Gowdj denies that the free-silver
Republicans will vote the Democratic
ticket.
He said in an interview yesterday that
while there are many free-silver Republi
cans they are all for protective tariff.
There are nearly 30,000 Populists in the
State, and the Republican managers have
tig jred out that if 75 per cent of these join
the Democrats on a free-silver platform it
will make a close call for the Repub
licans.
It was decided by representatives of the
gold wing of the Democratic party yester
day that it is their duty to make a fight
against tbe adoption of a free-silver plat
form. There will be a gold conference
held here early next week, when plans
will be laid. It will be suggested that ex-
Congressman W. D. Bynuru be a gold can
didate for Congress. He will make a
strong fight, and they claim he has a good
prospect of winning.
BLAND ON THE SITUATION
Say* That Free Coinage I* the Only
Saltation for the Country.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. May 21.âEx-Congress
man Richard P. Bland. Missouri's candi
date for the nomination of President of
the United States at the hands of the
Democratic party, arrived in St. Louis last
night. He spoke confidently of the po
litical outlook as regards free coinage.
â¢'The people," he said, "are tired of
bonds, and free coinage offers them the
only legitimate relief. The administration
policy means more bonds; the Republican*
party's return to power means more taxa
tion. It must be either bonds or taxation,
and the people are taxed almost to death
already. For this reason the free coinage
of silver, which is the only safeguard
against the continuance of hard times, is
being demanded more and more every day.
I am satisfied that two-thirds of the people
of this country want free coinage.
"I notice," he continued, "there is seri
ous trouble in the Republican ranks.
McKinley's managers are just finding out
that despite all their efforts to keep it
down, the money question is the one
absorbing question of the day. They have
endeavored to force the tariff to the front,
but the public will not have it. Now an
outcry is being raised for an expression as
to gold or silver from McKinley. Coming as
this does at the last moment, on the eve of
the convention, this is very interesting to
us Democrats, but to the Republicans it
is a serious situation.
"If the gold standard be adopted as
part of the St. Louis platform by the Re
publican party, you wilt see a big revolt
among the Republicans, even of this
State. There are indications of this al
ready.
"His adherence to gold proved fatal to
the aspirations of Speaker Reed of Maine.
He knew in the last Congress that while
he might keep in touch wi|h New York
and the East by voting for gold bonds he
would forfeit all his chances in the West.
Had Reed been a Western man and in line
with the Weal on the financial question
his great ability would have made him the
Presidential nomiDee. As it is, his anti
silver views have made his selection out of
the question, and he has lost much of his
real influence."
As regards his own Presidential can
didacy, Mr. Bland modestly declined to
speak.
DISGUST OF EDMONDS
Objrct* to Delegate* Being Bound to Tote
for McKinley.
BOSTON, Mass., May 21.â A special in
to-night's Transcript from St. Albans,
Yt.. says in part:
Senator Edmunds has written a letter to
at least one of the delegates chosen to
represent Vermont at the National Cou
vention in which he virtually expresses
disgust at the action of the Green Moun
tain voters in taking a stand which makes
it practically imperative that their dele
gates vote for McKinley at St. Louis. The
missive was written about a week ago to
Colonel Edward O. Smith of St. Albans.
president of the Central Vermont Rail
road, and one of the delegates-at-large.
Speaking about the possibility that the
Vermont delegates may not at St. Louis
all carry out the expressed wish of the
State Convention, Colonel Smith said, in
his opinion the delegates would be obliged
to vote for McKinley as a matter of honor
without regard to personal preference.
Colonel Smith expressed the belief that
McKinley would be nominated on the first
ballot at St. Louis, but said he thought
McKinley's boom would be so big that it
might at last break on account of its own
weight. In tuat case the Vermont voter?

oped the most strength.
ALIGELD IS IN CHARGE
Will Per tonally Conduct the Sitrer Cam.
paign in Cook County.
CHICAGO, 111., May 21. â Governor
Altseld came to town to-day to take per
sonal charge of the Democratic silver
campaign in the county, which will cul
minate in the convention next week. He
ridicules the talk of anti-silver Democrats
bolting the county or State conventions of
the party, and declared that after the
county convention the gold standard poli
ticians would be found working hard lor
the majority.
It was expected that a meeting of the
Democratic sound-money organization
would be held to-day to decide on the
question of holding a separate primary
election and convention; Out there was
no meeting and, what was more signifi
cant, there was a cessation of talk in the
bolting strain. Instead the organization
issued a statement merely denouueing tne
methods of the silver majority on the
county committee and encouraging the
sound-money Democrats to continue tbe
fight for "fair play and honest primaries."
The situation to-night doe 3 not point to
a bolt. Several prominent Democrats on
the gold side have declared against such
action.
POSTER FOR SECOND PLACE.
Reported Retult of an Interview Between
the General and Hahn.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 21.â The ar
rival in this city last night of William ML
Hahn, the Ohio member of the Republican
National Committee, occasioned much '
speculation among the Republican man- I
agers at tbe Fifth-avenue Hotel as to the '
object of his visit. Mr. Hahn would give
bo information, but an incident that oc- I
curred at the hotel this morning satisfied
the politicians that he had come here to
have a consultation about the Vice-Presi
dential nomination.
General Horace Porter had an hour's
conference with Mr. Hahn this morning,
after which the latter started for Canton,
Ohio. Neither General Porter nor the
Ohio committfeman would say anything
about their conference, but the crowd of
politicians in the State headquarters were
sure that Mr. Hahn had made the final
arrangement with General Porter to take
second place on the National ticket.
The Plait men asserted after Mr. Hahn's
departure that the McKinley manager's
plan included the nomination of General
Porter as Vice-President and the appoint
ment of Warner Miller as Secretary of the
Treasury in the event of McKinley's elec
tion.
PLANS OF THE SILVER WING
Second State Convention to Be Held 6y
South Dakota Democrat*.
ABERDEEN, S. Dak., May 21.âThecon
ference of tbe silver Democrats in the
small hours of the morning was not to
select a contesting delegation, but to dis
cuss methods and plans for another State
gathering of the free-silver wing of the
Democracy, for the purpose of electing a
delegation to Chicago. Colonel Lynch de
clared in favor of this plan, and it is known
others viewed it as he did. The silver ;
Democrats had two-thirds of the delegates
present at the convention, but the fact
that the entire Biack Hills was practically
in control of three gold men loaded down
with proxies, and that the convention per
mitted them to vote, put the silver forces
in a minority. Had the siiverites bolted
on the admission of these proxies, they say
they could have broken up the convention
and made a strong ca?e. The convention
attracted widespread interest.
GENERAL A USER'S VIEWS
Say* the Silver Men May Control the
Chtcano Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., May 21.-General A.
J. Warner, the free silver leader, spent to
day in this city, on his way home to Mari
etta, Ohio, from Toledo. Regarding the
monetary and political situation he sa'.d:
''There has been a rapid growth in silver
sentiment throughout the country lately.
It has specially manifested itself iv the
primary election for delegates to the Chi
cago convention of the Democratic party.
It is significant that there is enthusiasm
among the silver Republicans over the
election of silver delegates to the Demo
cratic convention. At least two-third of
the Democratic delegates from Ohio will
be in favor of free silver, and it looks now
as if the silver men would control the Na
tional Convention. The Bimetallic Union
believes in anything to win and is in favor
of having oniy one silver ticket in the
Presidential election."

NO TIDINGS OF HIM SINCE.
Was a Stranger Just From the East
and Wanted to Buy a Fruit
Farm.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., May 21.â Mis?
Louise Siefert of San Francisco was in
Santa Rosa Wednesday looking for her
brother, Henry Siefert, who she fears
has met with foul play. He left San Fran
cisco three weeks atzo to look at some land
near Kenwood, in this county, with a view
to purchasing a fruit farm. He was ex
pected home by his family within a week's
time, but has not yet returned or sent any
word as to his whereabouts.
Siefert did not reach Kenwood or any
other point in Sonoma County as far as
his sister knows. He had several thou
sand dollars with him and carried $4000 of
his money in greenbacks. Had Siefert
been an old resident of the State his sister
would not worry so much about his ab
sence, but he was an entire stranger, hav
ine nrrived in th;> State from Ohio just
four weeks ago. He was anxious to pur
chase a rnnch In Mime ruit section of the
Btate and had consulted a number of San
Francisco real estate dealers, ile \v.isÂ»
sent to Kenwood by a real estate man
named Bpeck, who iias an olhVe in San
Francisco in the Crocker building.
Si*Â»fert is a man of steady habits, was not
a heavy drinker and knows absolutely no
one in this county. He is 4^ years <>f age,
married and has a family of four children.
Mis wife came with him from the E.i^t.
but the children remained behind. The
wife is now in San Francisco and is almost
crazed at the prolonged absence of her
husband.
The sister searched all day Wednesday
in Santa Rosa for her brother, but found
no trace of him. Assemblyman Btaley of
Kenwood assisted her in her search. She
and Mr. S.aley returned to Kenwood
Wednesday night. Mis.- Siefert will re
turn to San Francisco to-day unless she
hears from the missing man.
SANTA ROSA SLITS SETTLED
brreral Caseg tUsjtuted Of, Leaving the
Calendar t'lmr.
SANTA ROSA, Cat. , May 21.â The liti
gious city of Bama Rosa is once more at
peace with those of her citizens who re
side in the vicinity of the sewer farm.
Tnis welcome news has caused great re
joicing here, as the numerous damage
suits which have been instituted during
the past few months i nve threatened to
bankrupt the city and caused considerable
uneasiness among the iarne taxpayers and
others.
in the case of Harry Hall against the
city the plaintiff secured a judgment for
$3000 and costs. By some oversight, for
which various people are blamed, tiie time
for tiling a oil! of exceptions or to move
tor a new trial on the nart of the city was
allowed to lapse, and as an appeal from
the rina! judgment would be very apt to
prove unavailing, on the advice oi the
City Attorney this judgment, amounting
to $3307, was ordered laid.
In the suit of Allen Wright, plaintiff's
attorneys asked leave to amend their com
plaint, and in the amendment alleged that
Wright was entitled to damages by reason
of injury to his wife's health. As Mrs.
Wrignt had not been maae a party to the
action the plaintiff was promptly de
murred out of court for fhe non-joinder
and judgment entered for the ciiy. "
In the case of M. A. Peterson $1 in dam
ages was allowed by a jury and the costs
divided.
The actions brought by J. L. Peterson
and Harvey Brittain were dismissed, which
leaves the city free from legal entangle
ments over the sewer question. As the
new sewer system is proving a decide i
success there is no fear of a renewal of the
troubie and taxpayers once more breathe
freely.
SACRAMENTO'S QUEER CASE.
The Prosecution Closes and Gregory's
Attorney Moves for Dismissal of
the Suit.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 21.â Louis
Bchindler was tne only witness in the
Gregory case this morning. Schindler is
the assignee of Gregory Brothers and was
their bookkeeper during the time when
Mrs. Lee made the loans to Eugene Greg
ory.
The testimony during the whole morn
ing was relative to the financial standing
of tho firm in 1894, and consisted of a tedi
ous examination of the firm's books. It
was ascertained that in May, 1894, the
firm owed to Mrs. Gregory, mother of the
Gregory Brothers, the sum of $lt;,000. This
is |2000 less than the amount appearing in
the schedule in the insolvency matter,
which was filed in 1895 This was quali
fied by the defense by the statement that
several thousand dollars which was owing
it in 1*94 had become outlawed and was
not included in the insolvency schedule.
During his examination Schindler was
asked for a statement made up to August,
I&J4, and which was used on the stand
yesterday. Schinder stated that he had
destroyed it, and accused Jones of quali
fying his testimony with side remarks,
thus making the statement appear irregu
lar.
On cross-examination this afternoon
Schindler was asked how much of the ac
count of Mrs. Gregory for rent had ac
crued auring the two veare before May
14, 1894.
Schindlerâ s9fio.
Bruner â All the rest of the rent account
was outlawed. That shows that the firm
was worth $4800 more than the prosecution
have computed in the assets. In your
opinion was the firm solvent or insolvent
in May, 1894?
Schindler â It was certainly solvent.
C. F. Dillman, cashier of D. O. Mills'
bank, testified that the bank held a note
against the Gregory Brothers in 1894 in
dorsed by Mrs. Gregory, and bearing a
balance of $2000 This was subsequently
paid.
The prosecution then closed the case.
Bruner moved to dismiss on the grounds
that the firm was not Bhown to have been
insolvent in 1894; that Gregory had
not been shown to have had a knowl
edge that the firm was insolvent,
even if it were uo, and Mrs. Lee
had not beeu shown to have been igno
rant of the- firm's financial standing. AH
these are allegations of the complaints,
and are necessary to be shown.
Jones opposed the motion, stating that
he had shown t at the firm was insolvent
by his examination of Schindler and the
books.
Bruiier staled that the dates weie so
mixed up in the records that nothing could
be determined by it.
The District Attorney had confused
transactions occurring in"1895 with those
prior to LBM and the evidence would fail
to show cause for conviction upon habeas
corpus proceedings.
Tiie case was continued until to-morrow
morning and the motion to dismiss will
be argued at that time.
WARNING DEMOCRATS
The Jiuckleiz-llailrond Combine Arrayed
Afiainst Clean Politics.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 21.â The
contest over forthcoming Democratic pri
maries between the Buckley-Southern Pa
cific pan,', in favor of ward delegate elec
tions, and the Stevens-Patton-Herald ele
ment, in favor of precinct primaries, is
growing very spirited. The tight reached
a Climax last Saturday at a meet
ing of the County Central Com
mittee, which, by an adroit coup
of George S. Patton, was adjourned to next
Saturday. This move augured well for
the element in favor of clean politics and
the precinct plan. But now the word has
gone fortu to marshal the whole of Marsh
and Raniish's gang of street and sewer
workers to defeat the Patton ring next
Saturday. "Arcade Depot" Tom McCaf
ferv has his gang well in hand for the oc
casion.
The newspaper people have, it is now
known, been hoodwinked as to the real
object of the Buckley-railroad combine,
some shrewd schemer having circulated a
r port that the whole contest centered in
the prospective money plank in the State
convention resolutions, that is, whether
silver would be sustained.
A Call correspondent saw Judge A. M.
Stevens and Lawyer Will A. Harris to-day
and questioned them on the subject. Each
declared that the silver question had
nothing whatever to do with the present
fight.
"The whole proposition," said Harris,
"centers on the question of the anti-iuiui
ing resolutions and the San Pedro and
Santa Monica harbor issues."
Jud â¢'<â  Stevens heartily concurred in Har
ris' views.
"We tried the ward plan once." said
Judge Stevens, "and we wunt no more of
it.'" This was in 1Â»!Â«), when by a hustling
combination of Marsh and Raonsh's gang
the city wards were carried for Jim Cole
men when nine-tenths of tbe rank and
tile were for Pond. This plan at the time
tiisgusted the decent element of the party
to such an extent that the City Central
Committee passed an ironclad resolution
never to adopt the ward system ajrain.
A lively tight is promised for Saturday
afternoon's meeting.
HirÃort.n car service.
A -Yew Combination That Hill Greatly
Jirnefit I.om Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 21.-For
several years the "Slow-mule" streetcar
line has been in operation from the Santa
Fe depot in this city south to the city
limits. Cars made trips every hour, if not
oftener, and when folks happened to be
going in the direction of the line they
sometimes got on and rode. The scheme
was an apparent failure and the stock of
the concern was practically worthless. A
new combination of individuals has ac
quired most of the stock and the whole
ulan is to be reorganized and now prom
ises very important results for Los An
geles. The new directors are Abbott Kin
ney, W. L. Graves, C. A. Sumner, John L.
Pope and C. R. Day.
They have put on a quarter-hour service
ana will soon make an electric double
track line of it and extend it far beyond
the present terminus south, and, what is
still more important, will bring the north
ern terminus from La Grande Station
into the heart of Los Angeles. Petitions
have been signed on all sides which will
be presented to the Council next Monday to
straighten San Mateo street to connect
with Santa Ire avenue. This lineâ San
Mateo and Santa Fe Avenue Street
Car Company â nearly parallels the
Los Angeles River for about three miles
through a district rapidly build op
with factories and machine shops and will
be known as the "laboring man's route.'
Already a transfer system with the trac
tion company has gone into effect, which
insures to the patrons of either line a de
lightful ride through the populated as well
as more sparsely settled sections of the
city. It is understood that a route has
also been selected running up through the
business center.and that the council will be
asked very shortly to advertise the fran
chise for bids.
A STOCKTON GIRL'S STORY
Was Wandering About Dazed
and Half-Clad in a Rain
storm
Says Her Clothin; Was Torn From
Her by a Strange Man in a
Buggy.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 21.â Late this
afternoon, during the heavy downpour of
rain, John N. Woods, one of the leading
men of this city, was driving toward
Stockton along tl c French Camp turnpike
when he saw a little girl half-naked,
struggling along in the storm. She was
minus hat, coat, shoes and stockings and
her clothing had been nearly torn from
her. The child was walking along the
road in a half-dazed condition, trying to
find her way home, but not knowing
which way to go. Mr. Woods stopped
his team and took the little girl into his
buggy. Sne proved to be Edith Way, the
18-year-old daughter of George N. Way, an
employe in Buell's lumber-yard. A little
farther alone, near the dumping ground,
just outride the city, he paw the rest of
Edith's clothing lying near the roadway.
To Mr. Woods and his wife the child
told a siory on which the constables and
Sheriff's deputies are now at work scour
ing the country for the man who is sup
posed to have abducted and attempted to
maltreat the Way girl. To the Woods she
s>aid that she was on her way home from
the public school in company with another
little eirl from the Catholic convent, when
a middle-aged man drove up to where they
were crossing the street at the junction ot
San Joaquin and South. According to her
story he seized them and drew them into
bis buggy, after which he forced some
white powder down her throat, which
completely stupefied her.
She remembers nothing until outside
the city, when she says the man made im
proper proposals to her, and when she re
sisted he threw her out of the buggy to
the ground. She remembers her strug
gles, but little else until she came to her
senses during the driving rain that fell
here about 5 o'clock. She only knows the
first name of her little girl companion
which she says is Belle, but the sisters say
no one answering that description goes to
the convent. Such a man and rig as the
girl describes were seen to turn into South
street from California shortly before the
time Edith Way says she was abducted.
There are some parts of the child's story
that seem improbable, especially as no
other girl has been reported missing, but
the officers are now scouring ail the roads
in tne county to make sure.
Captured at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 21.â R. H.
Kirby, who is wanted in Portland, Or., for
grand larceny, was captured here this
morning. Kirby is accused of 6tealing
1800.
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1896.
SAN JOSE'S BIG
WILL CONTEST
Great Interest Taken in the
Battle for the
Estate.
A CROWDED COURTROOM
Mrs. Sarah Bichel Takes the
Stand in ihe Interest of
Mrs. Parker.
TELLS ABOUT THE TESTATOR.
Amusing Incidents During the Prcg.
ress cf Her Testimonyâ Even
the Court Smi'es.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. May 21. âJudge Rey
nolds' courtroom was well filled with spec
tators this morning who were anxious to
hear the testimony in the contest of the
will of George H. Parker, deceased, by
EmraaL. Parker.
After the announcement by the court
that only from Monday to Thursday even
ing of each week would be devoted to the
case, the taking of testimony began.
The first witness for the contestant was
Mrs. Sarah Bichel. She was questioned
by Attorney Patterson. She testified she
had lived in San Jose since 1868. She first
became acquainted with the deceased,
George 11. Parker, in 1886, when both par
ties were Jiving on Second street, six
was an intimate friend of Mrs. George
Parker, the sister of Marshall and Jane
Pomeroy, and her mother. Mrs. George
Parker died ie 1892 after which George
Parker returned from the Kut here and
while staying at the Yemiome became
sick.
11 offered >l rs. Bichel v deed of gift to a
cottag on William street, provided she
would keep house for him. She at first
refused, tben finally consented. She was
to give him a deed for the cottage so in
case she died before him it would return
to him. Mrs. Bichel kept house for him
from November, 1892, until May.
when George Parker went East. He re
turned in June, ISW, and she kept bouse
for him till the accident which caused his
death.
Mr-*. Bichel was with George Parker in a
boggy on August 14 when the collision
with a runaw y occurred, and descrit>ed
how he was crushed, receiving injuries*
which caused his death three dsiys Inter.
>he was in the habit of rating all letters
received by George Parker into his desk.
During his lifetime the desk was never
locked, but shortly after his death Mar
shall Pornerov looked the desK and a few
months later took it from the hou-e.
In thi- afternoon the taking of testimony
of Mrs. P:chel was resumed. She teMitied:
"Mr. Parker was continually harping in
189.'t upon his will and about women. He
often asked me in regard to women who
would make suitable wives."
"Was that an evidence of unsoundness
of mind?" asked Mr. Uelmas.
"He was an unmarried man of means,
and he asked tins lady who has menage*
irom heaven in retrard to this important
consideration of the fitness of certain
women for wives."
'Now, do you know about this lady be
ing capable of giving messages from
heaven?" asked Judge Reynolds.
"I have looked into the latest dictionary
since the ourt adjourned and found that
out,' 1 replied Mr. Delmas with a smile.
"Spiritualist m diums are supposed to be
able to secure me-.-a-es from the dead."
"When we were out riding and saw any
ladies, or any of my young lady friends
would visit me," resumed the "witness,
"he would ask if one and another of them
would make a kooil wife. As regards say
ing he was engaged to different young
ladies, he said to me on various occasions
that he had spoken to such and such a girl
about marriage."
_ "Did hÂ«- ever consult you on the propo
sition of the feasibility of organizing a
troupe of dancing girls to tour the East?"
asked Pateraon, and the question caused
considerable amusement in court.
"Yes." was the reply. "Once when he
came back from San Francisco he said he
had been with two of his dancing girls '
and they had proposed to him to organize i
a troupe of ballet dancers to ro East.
"rie said he saw them dance and then
he showed them some of his steps. I sail
1 was surprised to hear that ne was a
dancer and 1 asked him to show me some
of his steps, but he refused to do so.
"After the death of nis wife ami Mr.
Parker's return from the East he waÂ« very
nervous and was continually making a
will in his mind. Once he threw himself
â¢iown on a sofa, and said he had been with
Attorney Joseph Pattoti for two and a half
hours trying to make a will, but no con
clusion had been reached.
"Once Mr. Parker had a pair of slates.
He took them East, and brought them
back with him when he returned in July
1893."
Six letters that were written to the tes
tator by Jane and Noah Pomeroy and a
pairot slates were then handed over to
Attorney Patter-on by Judge Spencer.
Upon the insides of the slates was writ
ten a message purporting to have come
from his deceased wife to George 11. Par
ker. She stated that she was well in the
spirit world and she hoped that her hus
band was happy.
The court, upon an objection being
raised, would not allow the message to be
read to the jury.
Attorney Patterson stated a belief that a
man who woulu think he could receive a
communication from his wife in heaven
was not of sound mind, and the slate mes
sages were admissible in evidence for the
purpose of helping to sustain the allega
tion of unsoundness of mind.
"There is no direct testimony that these
messages came from heaven," said Judge
Reynolds.
"This might be a privileged communi
cation under the law if it is between man
and wife," suggested Mr. Delmas.
Judge Reynolds intimated with a smile
that undoubtedly those ties could not con
tinue after death, and a communication of
a wife to her husband after she passed
away was not privileged. "The Civil
Code," remarked the court, "does not
reach beyond this life."
"What is the belief of spiritualists in
regard to receiving communications from
the dead?" then asked Attorney Patterson
of the witness.
An object was also made to this question
and sustained.
This closed the testimony of Mrs.
Bickel, it being understood that she could
be recalled for further direct and subse
quent cross-examination. Mr. Delmas
stated that in the present stage of her
testimony there was nothing that it was
desired to cross-question her about.
Mrs. Ellen W. Law, the next witness,
was examined by Attorney Coogan lor the
contestant. The witness proved to be
very deaf, and to aid her hearing she held
the edge of a gutta pereha fan-shaped in
strument in h<*r teeth while the questions
were being put to her. She testified as
follows:
"I hÂ«ive lived in California since 1854. I
knew Georpe M. Parker well during his
lifetime. I first became acquainted with
him in 1858, when 1 lived near Alviso, in
this county. Afterward myself and Mrs.
Parker were engaged in business together
in San Francisco. I was a dressmaker and
she was an agent for a sewing machine.
"Afterward I started a boarding and
lo lgin>: house and they stopped with me.
I was also well acquainted with Ed Parker,
the son of G. H. Parker. The son first
came to California in 1870. He and Mrs.
Parker then took a trip to Yosemite Val
ley and were gone a month. During their
absence (leorsje H. Parker seemed to be
very much worried in mind.
"He said bis wife and son were spending
all his money, and that they would drive
him to the poorhouse. Often he would
cry and moan out loud. At times he com
plained greatly of his head, lie would
bathe it in water and spirits of camphor.
Several times he said he could not live

"What did he say was the purpose of his

Mr. Delmas objected that this time wa3

"But," interposed Attorney Coogan.

STANFORD'S NEW CAPTAIN
Charles Dole Selected to Lead
the Athletes of the
University.
A Brawny Youth Who Holds Several
Recordsâ Tribute to the
Retiring Captain.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
21. â This afternoon Stanford elected her
new track captain, who is to serve during
next season. Charles Sumner Dole is the
lucky man who will strive next year to
make the team do bettor work than it did
this season. George Toombs is the retir
ing captain, and few men here have done
J so much to keep track athletics booming
las has Toombs. He made an excellent
captain, was a hard worker himself and
encouraged others to work also. During
his captaincy many new men were brought
out and developed, showing their ability
j even this year, while a large number of
I others will be ready for Varsity track work
next year as a result of their few weeks
j under Toonib* tnis season.
I Charles Dole, is well fitted to advance
; Stanford's reputation on the track. He
has long been an athlete, having made
several records under Y. M. C. A. auspices
before he attended Stanford in 18! M. Each
year he has shown a greater improvement
I in his track work, and he now ranks as
j champion all-K und athlete of the Y. M.
C. A. on tliia co ist. He is also champion
all-round athlete of Stanford University
and stands at the top of the list among
coast athletes. He holds several fine
records, among them being 10 feet 10Â£
inches for the j ,!e vault, the coast record;
.Â» feet VU Inches for the high jump; 20 feet
l\i inches for the running broad jump; 27
seconds for the 220-yard hurdles, and 16 1-5
seconds for the 120-yard hurdles. Besides
this Dole ha<; thown sp^ed in the short
dashes, 10 4-5 being his 100-yard record.
This brawny young fellow is but 22
years old ami wt-iutia 170 pounds in his
running clothes. He has shown consid
erable ability as a football player and was
a substitute on tho team last Thanksgiv
ing. During the last live minutes of the
game he took Frankenheimer's place at
left halfback. Unfortunately Dole has
met with accidents both years in the early
practice game-, which lai'i him out for the
season, but while playing and in good con
dition there are few men like him as a
line-smasher and runner with the ball.
Dole was born in Honolulu and is a
nephew of President Dole of the Sandwich
Islands. He comes from a family of
athletes, his brothers all being athletically
inclined and one of them having been on
Cornell's crack racing crew. His major
I subject here is economics.
Dole was also elected president of the
Student Guild to-dayâ an organization for
the assistance of needy students, especially
those who are taken sick while at college
and are without means.
Within a week Stanfoid University is
going to send out a unique collecting ex
pedition. It will be nothing less than a
wagon with complete camping and col
lecting outfit, under charge of two stu
dentsâMessrs. J. O. Snyder and G. B.
Culver. The plans are to drive along the
coast line to the northern boundary of the
j Mate and return through the interior val-
I leys and fuoihills. All the streams will
be examined for the fishes they contain,
and an attempt will be made to trac2 the
geographical distribution of fresh-water
fishes on the coast. Three months will be
consumed in the trip.
Entrance examinations for Stanford are
to be held next Saturday, Monday and
Tuesday. They will be given simultaneously
on those days in the iullowing places, be
sides here on the campus: Lo3 Angeles,
Portland, Arcata, Nordnoft and Durango,
Colo.
Eastern students who desire to enter
Stanford examinations are admitted on
passing the examination given by Harvard.
SANTA ANA CLOSES
HER PARLIAMENT.
The Final Proceedings Are
Watched by a Large
Audience.
BRIGHT WOMEN DEBATE
"The Newspaper: Its Defects
and Its Merits" Proves a
Lively Topic.
MAN'S INHUMANITY TO WOMAN
Cruelty in Every Form Is Rebuked.
Woman Suffragists Get in at
the Win J -Up..
SANTA ANA, Cal.. May 21.â The clos
ing day of the meeting of the Woman's
I'arliament of Southern California was
even more of a success than the first.
When called to order tnis morning every
seat in the house was occupied, and be
fore noon an audience of fully 800 was
present. Last night's splendid meeting
served to increase the interest in the event,
and to-day ihe whole city seemed heartily
in accord with the women iv their work.
One very noticeable feature of the pro
ceedings has been the absence of the suf
frace question in the programme. Several
times ardent advoi/ators of woman's rights
attempted to get the suffrage issue before
the house, out each time President Kale
Topper Galpin ruled that it was
entirely out of order, although a
strong suffragist herself. She maintained,
and in this was supported by the meeting,
that while undoubtedly a large majority
of th*Â» members of the parliament were in
favor of equal rights of suffrage, thai
question was not included in the work of
the order and should not be forced upon
the conservative members who did not de
sire it. After the meeting adjourned to
day, however, Mrs. J. A. Osgood was put
in the chair temporarily and a motion was
put to the audience that all present who
lavored the right of suffrage being ex
tended should rise. This brought fully
four-fifths of the audience to its feet, and
the enthusiastic promoters of the motion
I were satisfied.
The subject which occupied the atten
tion of the parliament this morning was
certainly one furnishing colossal oppor
tunities fordiscussion, "Tne Newspaper."
The subject was presented in two depart
mentl â "Its Defects," by Mrs. K. E.
Bpaldiag of Pasadena, and ''Its Merits,"
by Mrs. William R. Spalding of Los Ange
les. Tne principal "defect' found by the
former lady was that newspapers pub
lished too much of sensational crime to
t lie sacrifice of more elevating subjects.
Mrs. William Spalding, however, found a
broad field in which to revel in showing
the merit.- of the modern journal. She
claimed that the character of a newspajwr
was molded by its environments. It must
adapt itself to the tastes of its readers.
Her experience had taught her that the
newspaper of to-day was not so bad as it
was depicted by its enemies.
"It is claimed that the press disregards
religion," said she, "but those who make
this claim always have the daily news
paper tin their tables as a monument to
their piety and consistency."
Mrs. Ella H. Underlain of the staff of
the Lo* Angeles Express opened the dis
cussion, and proved to be an able cham
pion of the press. MrÃ. Dr. Reed of Pasa
dena discussed both sides of the question.
She was of the opinion that the news
papers were no worse than the peo
ple â that each educated the other.
Mrs. Davis of San Francisco and Mrs.
E. D. Buss of Tustin protested as mothers
against the practice of newspapers pub
lishing indecent advertisements, particu
larly those of patent medicine quacks.
Miss Minnie Reed of San Diego said she
did not think, as one lady claimed, that
readers encouraged newspapers in their
pernicious methods. She knew several
people herself who refused to subscribe
for sensational journals. Mrs. William
Spalding of Pasadena said the newspapei s
of Los Angeles pay out thousands of
dollars every year in expenses. They
must certainly yield a profit above this
amount, and tne undisputed fact that they
were prosperous was evidence that their
patrons were satisfied with them.
"Yes," she said, "we demand our daily
sensation."
This afternoon the programme opened
with a question-box conducted by Mrs.
Dr. Reed of Pasadena. An attempt was
made to introduce the suffrage question
here, but without succesn. Proper reading
matter in the family circle was advocated
and the introduction of politics in the pub
lic schools antagonized.
The closing subject of the programme,
"Inhumanity," brought out the spiciest
and most enjoyable debates of the whole
session. Mrs. Eugenia T. Manahan of
Pasadena led off with a thirty-minute
paper on "Inhumanity to Man." The
misunderstood passions in man were
pointed out as one of the causes of in
humanity that should no longer be per
mitted to exist.
"Truth, justice and humanity," she said,
"are essentials that should and will be
considered."
At this point Mr. Brainardof Santa Ana,
an elderly gentleman who is totally blind,
took the liberty of announcing that if he
lived until November he intended to cast
a vote for woman suffrage.
Mrs. Eliza A. Lawrence of San Pedro was
called for, and in response stated that she
had only to say that man's inhumanity to
man was well known; and us the period of
man's inhumanity to woman bad drawn
nearly to a close Bhe would not consume
the time of the parliament on the subject.
Mrs. Steelaof Compton followed with a
few remains. Next came "Inhumanity
to Girlhood," by Mrs. Harriet C. Wad
leiÃh of Los Angeles. She elicited the
sympathy of the audience with a few well
chosen instances of inhumanity to girls,
and gave an interesting account on the
methods employed at the Whittier State
School. The chief object of the paper was
to illustrate the necessity of providing
suitable homes for wayward girls who had
served at reform schools or other places of
correction.
The last subdivision of the subject in
hand, "Inhumanity to Animals," had the
effect of bringing the whole assemblage
into a scrimmage of good-natured thrusts
and repartee. Being the closing feature, a
feeling of something akin to abandon en
sued when the opportunity was so excel
lently furnished. Mrs. Osgood commenced
by referring to the bad practice of allow
ing children to kill insects, etc. Inhuman
instincts are thus liable to be fostered,
which may show themselves to a danger
ous extent in later years. She referred to
the cruel practice of docking horses' tails,
and alluded to numerous other "inhuman
ities" that were unnecessarily perpetrated
upon the helpless dumb animals and
beasts.
At this juncture Mrs. L. H. Mills, dis
trict secretary of Orange County, read an
extract from the Santa Ana Daily Herald
in which that paper announced that it
would furnish the ladies of Orange County
an opportunity in the near future of vot
ing upon suffrage at a woman's election
for the purpose of determining whether or
not the women really wanted to vote.
This news was received with hearty ap
plause.
Mrs. Reed of Pasadena then resumed
discussion on the "previous question,"
and spoke of the brutality of using birds
for bat trimming. She thought that even
the practice of plucking feathers for such
uses was cruel and unnecessary. This had
the result of a committee waiting upon
Mrs. Reed to examine the feather in her
own hat. It was found to be an artificial
one, however. This feather discussion
grew into an animated all-round fusilade,
and the hats of the entire audience were
carefully scrutinized at long and short
range.
At the close of the discussion a rising j
vote of thanks was tendered to the Orange i
County ladies for their hospitality, and |
then again the suffrage question reap- .
peered. A lady wanted an expression |
from the house on the woman suffrage
plank. Then, as related previously, Mrs.
Gilpin ruled the motion out of order, as
the aim of the parliament was not to re
form, but to discuss and instruct. She I
thought that if it was desired to secure |
such an exuression from the audience, as !
an assemblage of women and not as
a parliament, it would be perfectly
proper, and Mich a step couid be taken
after adjournment.
The business of the parliament being
completed, an adjournment followed.
Mrs. Galpm called Mrs. Osgood to the
chair and almost the entire audience of
ladies rose in favor of woman suffrage
when the question was put. The parlia
ment then "broke ranKs" and enjoyed a
social half hour, when the visiting ladies
departed for theii* homes, r.eartily prais
ing the manner in which the session had
been conducted and declaring it to be the
most profitable one in all the history of
the organization.

The Section Embraces Lake Zika and
Is a Favorite Health and
Pleasure Resort.
SANTA BARBARA, Cm., May 21.â
A petition signed by leadine residents of
this county has been lorwarded to Wash
ington asking Congress to forever reserve
from settlement, for the purpose of a Na
tional park, two sections of land in the
San Rafael Range in northern Santa Bar
bara County, including witliin their
boundaries that beautiful sheet of water
known as Lake Zaka. This lies at an ele
vation of about 3000 feet above sea level
and is surrounded by a wild and pictur
esque mountain region. It is widely
known as a health resort in summer and
is a favorite resort with the pleasure-seeker
and sportsman. The land surrounding it
has just been surveyed. It possesses little
or no value lo the farmer or stock-raiser,
and any would-be settler would make en
try of the land only for the purpose of
reapine a harvest from those who seek
tl c locality for its scenic beauty.
Edgar B. Davidson, who represents Thk

the chief worker In inaugurating this
movement for the public cood.

STOCKTON, Cal., May 21.â Stockton
Parlor of Native Sons is leaving no stone
unturned to make the Admission day cel
ebration a great success. To-night there
was an important meeting of the general
committee for the purpose of hearing the
reports of the various sub-committees and
the apportioning of funds to those com
mittees. It had been decided to be liberal
with all the committees, but not to allow
any to exceed the sum allotted to it, and
besides this a reserve fund of $1000 was cre
ated to-night for the purpose of meeting
sundry expenses that may arise at the last
minute. It has been practically decided
that there will be a monster regatta on the

the usual barge and shell races there will
be launch races and all sorts of aquatic
sports for the amusement of the thousands
who will flock here on that day.

FAVORITES IN THREE EVENTS.
Toano Was First in a Big Gallop.
Hello Bat Arundel a Nose in
a Sensational Finish.
The unexpected downpour of a belated
April shower did nol seriously impede
students of form in picking winners at
the track yesterday, for they were down
with both feet o:i three of the live winning
horses. The card was an abbreviated one,
there being but live events to be decided.
The two outsiders that escaped the wise
division were Bohemian Lass, who took
the two-year-old dash at odds of 15 to 1,
and Myron, winner of one of the skate
events with 8 to 1 about him.
The finish to the steeplechase over the
regular coorse was the most sensational
one for many moons. In a drive from the
head of the stretch Hello, the 7 to 5
favorite, and Arundel, backed from 7 to 3
to 1. ran like a team, the first choice, rid
den !y Clancy, petting the decision by an
English pug n< s
Mr. Kamsdell's gelding Myron, who
was never oi much account except in
muddy going, was rather overlooked in
the betting on the opening five-furlong
ooKs laying 8 to 1 against
him at the post time. Ike Johnson got
him away in front and after a tussle with
the Becond .'.oice, Grade S, beat the mare
out at the wire by two lengths in 1:04%.

America, the 8 to 5 choice, could not un
track herself, coming in among the tail
enÂ«iers plastered over with mud.
The ring laid 1 to 2 against Toano win
ning the next event, a six-furlong selling
affair, which, considering the company he
had to beat, looked a very liberal price.
Away from the post third llennessy took
him out in front and he won all the way,
passing the judges four lencths in ad
vance of Heartsease in 1:16)4. Afflatus,
the second choice, was a poor third.
Six youngsters sported silk in the four
furlong dash for beaten non-winners since
April 15. The Pueblo stable's Wildidle
filly Dolore opened a pronounced even
money choice, but was evidently not
fancied by the stable, and receded in the
betting to twos.
Torpedo, who on the day previous made
a very poor showine, was sent out a 9 to 5
favorite. Dolore was first to show after
the start, but was outrun from the jump
almost by Bohemian Lass, an 8 to 1
chance, who won in a bi^ romp by six
lencths in 50V.{ seconds. In a drive Dolore
headed Santa Paula out a length for
the place.
Baldfaced Thornhill did not let his
friends down yesterday, but pulled oft the
final event over a mile in g.illant fashion.
He was an Bto f> favorite in the betting,
and after laying second to Candor and Tar
and Tartar to the stretch came on and
won easily by a couple of lengths in
1 :45& Little Cripple, who was plunged
on, being backed down from 4 to _ to 1,
finished third behind Tar and Tartar.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Ike Johnson, on Little Cripple, luckily
got in before the winning horse was auc
tioned off.
"My country, 'tis of thee"; Jockey
Henry Smith rode an 8 to 5 favorite in
America.
Mr. Bagot, the gentleman rider who
had the mount on The Lark in the
steeplechase, experienced a bad fall at the
jump in the hollow, but he escaped with a
severe fracture of his high starched collar.
At the last Ingleside meeting spurious
tickets of admission were disposed of by
outside parties and the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club was defrauded of several dol
lars thereby. It now transpires that a
couple oi employes of the H. S. Crocker
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRTDAY, MAY 22, 1896.
Company working in the lithographine
room were quietly purloining the desired
coupons and dealing them out to friends
on the outside to dispose of. A porter
in one of the prominent hotels
was found with a supply, as well us
one or two handicap "spielers" that
dispense their wares outside of
the gate. Chief Ticket Clerk May, who
made the discovery, stales that Secretary
Leake of the Ingleside Association has or
dered all of the old tickets in, and the rich
bonanza will probably be a failure at the
coming meeting. No arrests have beeu
made in connection with the case.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
An_OrdTnance Asked to Regnlate the
Tearing Up of Streetâ¢
The Fire Commissioners at their meet
ing yesterday afternoon instructed Secre
tary Maxwell to send a communication to
the Board of Supervisors asking that an
ordinance be passed prohibiting the tear
ing up of more than one block on a street
at a time. At the fire last week at Ninth
and Folsom streets one of the hosecarts
got stuck owing to the torn-up condition
of the street, and was extricated with con
siderable difficulty. \
The Board of Supervisors will be also
requested to order 1000 hydrants, more or
less, during the next fiscal year.
John McGoury, driver of chemical en
gine 3, and ,M. Fitzhenry, driver of trucK

springing the axles of their apparatus by
careless drivine. The resignation of George

any man in America, barring Jim Corbett,
a man who Gallagher thinks is the wonder
of the age, or any other age for mat mat
ter.
Jeffries is 1!Â» years old, stands 6 feet 2\i
inches without the aid of stockings and
wears arms that in length and strength
compare favorably with the great John L.
SulJivan when the latter was in his prime.
Jeffries has fought and whipped twenty
men during his short career as a prize
tighter, and is now looking for big game.
Choynski may be induced to try the
newly discovered wonder of the orange
croves in a game called smash and miss.
There was some talk recently of matching
good-natured Joseph against "Kid" Mc-
Coy, but the latter has set all doubts aside
on this subject in a letter to Eddie Graney,
which states that Mr. McCoy has no par
ticular desire to enter into a fistic argu
ment with GboynakL In other words,
McCoy acknowledges that the Californian
is slightly nigh in came for him, and that
he will content himself for awhile at least
by meeting fighters who can be more
easily disposed of.
The program me arranged by the National
Club for its next fistic exhibition at the
Pavilion, on June 3, reads:
Tom Sharkey vs. Jim Williams, champion of
Palt Lake, ten rounds; Danny Xeerthain and
Hilly Gallagher, ten rounds; Billy Smith and
Pauy Kerrigan, ton rounds: Arthur Walker
and iieorge Allen, both ot Australia, ten
rounds.
All the boxers are training at their re
spective stations, and latest accounts state
that every man is now almost in the pinlr.
of condition.
The directors of the Olympic Club have
decided to advance sufficient money to
Captain Gill of the club to defray the ex
pense- of a team of all-round athletes in
a trip to Portland, Or. Captain Gill has
been in correspondence with the Mult
nomah Club of Portland for some tune,
with a view of holding an interstate ath
letic competition at Portland in June.
Now that the olh'cers of the Olympic
have given the scheme favorable considera
tion Captain <>ill has commenced to make
the necessary preparations for the con
templated invasion of trie Northwest.
The Multnomah Athletic Club will hold
its annual field day in Portland June 27,
and there can be no gainsaying tne fact
that a large gathering of the lovers of
good athletic sport will be present on this
occasion to witness the contests. Gill
stutes that he will have several prelimin
ary outdoor trials between the best ath
letes of the Olympic Club between now
and the day of the departure of the team i
for Oregon, and that he will select eight I
of the hest men of the trial horses to repre- j
sent the Olympic Clnb and San Francisco

Next Sunday the athletes of the Olympic
Club will contest in games which will be
held at Souther farm, San Leandro, but on
the Sunday toliowing the first of the pre- j

Â®Are You Weak?
\f^^l^VM > <^ r v !Â£ Some Points on the Development of
Vft^S^j^C'^s. True Manhood by Electricity-
y_f Reasons Why Dr. Sanden's Elec-
>^tf âi - ,T trie Bolt Is the Only Sure Remedy
TC fe^>^ ~*^ ! *^^' for the Recovery of This Vital
What a great amount of happiness is destroyed by this
terrible drain which is called Nervous Debility ! You see the
evidences of it in the faces of more than half the people you
meet. .
This great country of ours is a nation of nerves ; nerves
which have been drained of their vital force ; nerves which are
crying out for help. And why don't we help them? Why don't
we replace the energy which has been stolen from them ?
Because the medical profession, to whom we always go in
time of sickness, has no means at hand to restore nerve power.
Drugs never build up weak nerves without taking the, strength
from other organs of the body.
That don't pay. You might as well be sick one way as
another. If you are going to steal from your kidneys, your liver
and your stomach the energy to give temporary nourishment to
your nerves you'd better better let your nerves suffer and save
your stomach anyway.
"I'm tired of drugging." We hear that remark every day
It's the wail of the nerveless man who has lost all confidence it,
the old, worn-out system of medicine. 'â¢ Â»-
"I was nervous and broken down from debility. Along in the afternoon I would
get so tired and weak that I could not finish my day's work. A month after I began
to wear your Belt my strength had fully returned, and since then I have been as well
and strong as ever in my life." . ED M. PIERCE,
Guadaloupe Dairy, Fifteenth avenue and San Bruno road, San Francisco.
That shows you what Electricity does. Fowler, the noted
phrenologist, says it's the instrumentality of all life. .
Dr. Sanden'e Belt is a simple thing. You wear it about,
three hours at night. ou feel electricity going into your nerves
all the time. You can legulate it yourself ; turn it on mild or
strong. Every minute you soak up nerve power from it.
Even electricity is useless if not intelligently applied. Dr.
Sanden has devoted twenty years to close study of the nerve and
sexual forces, and even if other belts fail his treatment will cure.
Cheap, clumsily m-dde electric belts are like cheap jewelry.
You think you are getting a high-class article at a low price, but
your experience tells you that you pay twice for what you get.
"1 bought your Belt January 3 and have used it just a month. Previous to that
time I was so weak that I could not work. I commenced to gain in health and
strength immediately upon application of the Belt, and to-day I can attend to my
business and take my station in life like a man. I owe it all to your Belt, and take
pleasure in recommending it." . C. C. HELTMAN, Santa Barbara, Cal.
A permanent cure is guaranteed or money refunded in all
weaknesses of men. A pocket edition of the celebrated electror
medical work, "Three Classes of Men," illustrated, is sent free,
sealed, by mail, on application. Every young, middle-aged or
old man 'suffering the slightest weakness should read it. It will
point out an EASY, SURE AND SPEEDY WAY TO REGAIN
STRENGTH AND HEALTH WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE
HAS FAILED. Address

Olympic grounds. Dave Brown of Stan
ford College, who is an old member of the
Olympic Club, will be selected as one of
the team. Brown is possibly one of the
best long-distance runners in the State,
and th> re are but few amateur athletes in
America who can defeat him in a mile
race. The home team will receive two
thirds of the eate receipts. Gill is very
anxious that John Elliott, the father of
home athletics, join the team in its trip
to Portland.
James Mortimer returned yesterday after
havinc judged all classes of dogs at the
Seattle bench show. The judg- says that
the sportsmen of Seattle and vicinity have
some first-class dogs, and that the class of
Irish setters exhibited was very good. Of
the many Irish setters he had seen at
bench shows he thinks the most perfect
specimen of the race is now owned by a
gentleman named McLaujrhlin of Seattle.
Mortimer said also that he was not sur
prised that Otis Fellows, who judged t lie
Oakland bench show, reversed some of his
decisions.
"It is very seldom," said Mortimer,
"that you will find two ju<l<res who will
agree on every point when judgini: a mis
cellaneous class of does; consequently I
was not the least bit dimpnoin ted or sur
prised when I heard that Mr. Fellows did
not coincide with my Hens .vhen passing
judgment on some of the dogs that came
before me when I judged the Pacific Ken
nel Club's bench show. If every judge
judged alike there would not be any par
ticular necessity for bench show officers to
make special selections from among the
recognized authorities on dogs of all
kinds."
THE BOTTLED WILL CASE.
Mrs. Brooks, the Heir, Dtad, and
Her Husband Is In
different.
It Will Be a Mystery Unsolved for
Lack of Funds for Liti
gation.
The celebrated Jennie Parsons' bottled
will case is approaching a very tame end
ing.
The finding of the mysterious will in a
bureau drawer in Mrs. Broods' house, in
Chicago, a year auo last .January was de
scribed in a sufficiently vivid style to leave
an impression on the mind of the reading
public.
Jennie Parsons, it was said, had renn- d
the ulographic document in the cabin of a
foundering steamer on her way to Portland
from this City. The water was pouring
into the main salon and the lights were
going out as the last straggling line was
placed on the paper.
The document was thrust into the neck
of a bottle and thrown overboard. It was
found by a sailor and sent to Mrs. Brooks,
the daughter of the dead actress.
Mrs. Brooks placed it among a lot of
oth n r papers in a bureau drawer, where it
remained for many long years.
Messrs. Gunnison, Booth & Bartlett, for
the opposition to the probate of the will,
claimed, first, that it was a forgery, and,
second, that it was illegal because of its
lacking a date.
Now, all contentions count for naucht.
Minnie Adams Brooks is dead. Her hus
j band refuses to put up the necessary
money to carry on the contested probate,
, and the legal machinery, lacking oil, re
fuses to run. Tiie will isstill in evidence
in the original and also by photographs,
but there it rests passive and legally inert
for the lack of a monetary lubricant where
with to grease the wheels of litination.
The suit will probably be dismissed in a
I few days.

THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE
If Michael Romanoff, the founder of the
present dynasty, is cognizant of events in
the material world, he must have been
well satisfied Wit- the splendor and magni
tude of the display at his old capital yes
terday, where his youthful descendant,
Nicholas Romanoff, will be crowned Em
perorof All the Russias. And it must have
been especially pleasing to him to see
hundreds of thousauds of loyal subjects
of the throne journeying from all parts
of the empire by private and public
conveyance to participate in the corona
tion ceremoniesâ ceremonies which will
culminate in crowning a man who shall
rule over one-sixth of the land surface of
the giooe, and whose subjects number
more than 100,000,000.
The Emperor of Russia is, by what Rus
sians are pleased to call "divine right,"
the autocrat of every inch of the vast na
tion, besides he is the supreme head of the
church, thus being the vicar of the Al
mighty in all matters appertainine to the
material and spiritual welfare of ail the peo
ple of the land over which God has given
him dominion. That this power has been
abused many times since Michael Roman
off, a youth of 10, ascended the throne in
1(513, no one will pretend to deny, nor will
apologists be found for such disregard fur
human life and human liberty, but since
ISGI reforms have been instituted fully as
rapidly as the people were ready to appre
ciate them.
In 1801 Alexander II issued a proclama
tion which emancipated the slaves, or
serfs, but not without indemnifying those
who had claims upon them. That event
was the beginning of a new era in Rus
sia's social and commercial life, and no
step backward has since been taken. Al
though nihilism has been rampant, even
conspiring to overthrow the system of gov
ernment, and often resorting to murder,
the empire has moved forward. The edu
cational system ha 3 steadily improved
until it now compares favorably with
neighboring countries, and no more lib
eral patron of art, science and music will
be found in the Old World than the Rus
sian autocrat. Still, his life is threatened
because he cannot do in a day what re
quires a year to accomplish.
Russia is essentially an agricultural
country, and so helping has been the pol
icy of the Government in recent years
that Russian cereals now exert a powerful
influence in all the breadstuffs markets of
Europe. American farm machinery may
be seen in all the agricultural districts,
and in many localities farming is carried
on as scientifically as anywhere in the
United States. At the export points grain
elevators, patterned after those mammoth
concerns in Chicago, have been erected,
and whatever other appliances are cal
culated to reduce the cost of product : on
and marketine grain have been or are be
ing introduced. To be sure, private capi
tal has done ail this, but under conditions
that were made favorable by the central
power of the nation. The Czars have not.
therefore, been inimical to efforts to ex
pand the agricultural interests of the peo
ple in recent years-
But these things are not all the Czar
has been doing for Russia in the last third
of a century. Railway construction has
been steadily pushed between the more
important trade centers, and although
the country is not gridironed by rail lines
of transportation as America and some
parts of Europe are, it doubtless will be
when occasion requires. The Siberian
railway is one of the greatest enterprises
of modern times and when completed it
will have a total mileage of nearly 5000
miles. Several hundred miles are already
in successful operation, and by it now and
valuable mining and agricultural districts
have been made profitable and accessible.
Over <j.000,000 bushels of high grade
wheat were exported from these new
regions last year â regions that are, as
yet, necessarily sparely settled. The em
tare and the railway company are offering
preat inducements to farmers of other
countries to settle on the line of the Si
berian railway, and not a few Scandi
navians have already gone to the Siberian
country.
Russia has the population, the material
resources and the money to become in
the near future the leading country of the
Old World, and if one may judge by the
progress the empire has made in the last
three decades it would be safe to say that
the people are determined to excel in time
in all that goes to make a rich and power
ful nation. The Government is encourag
ing the erection of manufactories of every
kind that can find the raw material in the
empire, and boasts are already made that
the time will come when Kussian-made
good's and wares will be found in active
competition with the manufacture of
other countries in all the markets of the
world. It is a mistake to think of Russia
as a country whose people and rulers are
still groping in the shadow of barbarism.
"SOUND MONEY."
The leaders of both parties are every
where declaring for "sound money," and
the rank and file pay they will* have no
other kind. Inasmuch cs the Government
does not now nor is it likely to ever issue
unsound money, it would seem that there
is no occaÃion to talk about either "sound"
or "unsound" money. No sensible man
would ever question the "soundness" of
money issued or permitted to be issued by
the United States. Until the mints go to
turning out counterfeit money no one
need be afraid to take the Government's
promise to pay or its money of redemp
tion. The fact of the matter is, all this
talk about "souna money" is idiotic clap
trap, and it is intended to create a suspi
cion in the minds of the people that there
is a deep-laid scheme to turn the National
treasury into a kind of green goods print
ing establishment.
The natural "soundness" of silver for
redemption money purposes was not ques
tioned until 1873, and then the attack was
made upon it under cover, but the Cleve
land administration has boldly deprived
it of its legitimate place in the monetary
system of the country, so that its coin
value is derived from the Government's
promise to redeem it in gold. This radical
and brutal attack upon the legitimacy of
silver's <|ualities for money of redemption
was follpwed by denouncing it as "un
sound money," but, in fact, it wasslripoed
of its function as a money metal and its
own redemption in gold made a condition
of the privilege of being coined into dol
lars. The conspirators who committed
this dastardly offense against the bone, the
sinew and the main dependence of the Na
tion in its battle against the efforts of
moriey-ienders toward the centralization
of the political and social power of the
country into the little circle in which they
move are the influence that is behind the
cry of "sound mone}'."
What the people really mean by ''sound
money" is silver and gold dollars of equal
redemption power. They hold, and
rightly so, that they h,ave nothing to do
with gold bullion or silver bullion, as such.
As bullion, these metals are a merchant
able commodity, but when converted in
u> coin by authority of the Government
they are redemption money, and neither
one coull be called unsound without
relieving it altogether of its duty as money,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1896.
when it would not be redemption money
at all, which is the position of the silver
dollar to-day, except that it is permitted
to do duty as token money under a prom
ise that it will not claim the function of
redemption money, but recognize its own
dependence upon gold to give it a purchas
ing quality.
But the meaning of the common people's
cry for "sound monoy" is very different
from that of the money-lenders and bond
coupon clippers. They know that silver
possesses every requisite quality for re
demption money, and they demand that
its soundness be admitted and recognized
in the monetary system of the Nation.
That is the long and the short of the peo
ple's demand. That is to say, the wealth
makers demand that silver be returned to
its legitimate position of co-worker with
gold in supplying the channels of trade
and traflic with a sufficient volume of
money, or, in other words, the people de
mand that the Government call the gold
standard "dishonest money," the silver
standard "dishonest money" and a bi
metallic standard "honest money," if the
words "honest," "dishonest," "sound" and
"unsound" are to be used to designate real
from unreal money.
BOIES TRIUMPHS.
The victory of ex-Governor Boies over the
Federal olSce-fcoiders in lowa is a stinging
cut to Cleveland. Of all Western men
Boies i.i the most disliked by the adminis
tration. He has never been in accord with
Cleveland's tariff, money or foreign policy,
and being the recognized leader of his
party in lowa the condemnation which
the President received at the hands of the
Dubuque convention yesterday may be
considered an open declaration of war
upon any aspirant lor the Chicago nomi
nation who is under suspicion of being
friendly to Cleveland.
Ex-Ciovernor Boies is in no sense a great
man, but having carried lowa twice
against the usual Republican majority of
50,000 he is accepted as the Moses of the
party and wherever he leads the rank and
tile are pretty sure to follow. But what
made the Dubuque convention so deter
mined to repudiate Cleveland's kind of
Democracy was the trick the Federal of
fice-holders played upon the party in the
State Convention last year. Early last
spring holders of office under Cleveland in
lowa were given to understand that the
administration would expect them to not
only nominate a goldbug for Governor,
but see that the convention praised Cleve
land's "wise and patriotic policy."
When the convention assembled at Mar
shalltown it was found that it was under
the control of Cleveland's appointees, who
proceeded to turn Boies and all other
opponents of the President's Wall-street
methods out of doors. Judge Babb was
put at the head of the ticket, not because
there was any chance of electing him, but
to keep the machinery of the party in the
hands of Cleveland's friends so as to send
a delegation friendly to him to the Na
tional Convention. In the light of these
facts the triumph of Boies and hia follow
ing is significant. It means that under
no circumstances will the lowa delegation
to Chicago pledge the vote of the party 10
any one who is under the influence of
Cleveland. On the money question prac
tically all the rank and file of the lowa
Democratic party agree with Boies that
"as between cold monometallism and
silver coinage at lti to 1 without safeguards
of any kind lam for the latter." Then,
lor the most part, lowa Democrats are
ultra free-traders.
GORMAN'S DEPEAT.
The debate and the vote on the motion
of Senator Gorman to amend the coast
defense bill by a clause authorizing the
issue of $100,000,000 of 3-per-cent treasury
certificates was one of the most interesting
episodes of recent proceedings in Congress
It seems, furthermore, to foreshadow a
veto of the appropriation bill, and a not
distant call for another loan to replenish
th c gold reserve.
Gorman's argument in favor of his pro
posed amendment was that as the
revenues of the Government are not equal
to its expenses, it will be necessary to ob
tain money in some way to carry it out.
The condition of the treasury, which is
bad enough at present, will be made worse
by the large appropriations which are to
be voted for needed pu blic improvements,
naval expansion and coast defenses. Two
ways are open to obtain the required
funds. One is to increase the revenues by
enacting a better tariff of customs duties,
and the other is to borrow the money.
Gorman argued that as it seems impossi
ble for the Senate to pass a tariff bill at
this session it would be better and cheaper
to authorize the issue of treasury certifi
cates than to force the administration to
undertake a new loan.
That the position taken by Gorman was
correct in the main is beyond question,
but he made the mistake of trying to reap
a partisan advantaee out of the situation
by alleging that the Republicans in Con
gress are responsible for the condition of
the treasury, inasmuch as they have not
enacted any measures for its relief. This
allegation was promptly refuted by Sen
ator Sherman. As a matter of fact the
Republican majority in the House did
pass an emergency tariff bill and it was
defeated in the Senate because all the
Democrats and Populists voted against it.
It was Democracy that enacted the deficit
tariff. It is Democracy that keeps it in
force. It is Democracy that has forced
the country into debt, and it is still
Democracy that now threatens throueh
its President, Grover Cleveland, to veto
the appropriation bill and thus add stag
nation to depression.
It is worth noting that for the Gorman
amendment only nine Senators voted.
This is almost as bad a showing as that
made by Senator Hill when he undertook
to organize a fight against the bond deals.
The two men, Gorman and Hill, seem to
be as completely discredited as Cleveland
himself. In the Senate, at any rate,
Democracy is completely demoralized and
its ablest and most agcre.ssive leaders are
unable to rally even a dozen men to help
the administration in its hour of need.
A JOSEPH'S COAT CONVENTION.
The first duty of the Chicago convention
will be to determine what the word
"Democrat" means. No business can be
transacted until that is done. The Cleve
landites declare Bland and his following
are not Democrats, and Bland and hi>
following are positive that the Cleve
land it t-s do not know the first principles of
Democracy. The necessity, therefore, of
agreeing upon the meaning of the name
of their alleged party is apparent.
The convention call says it is to be a
gathering of Democrats, but until it is
ascertained what constitutes a Democrat
there is no other reason why Herr Most
should not be admitted to the convention
hall as a good Democrat. Bland says
Cleveland should go over to Governor
Morton's standard, and Cleveland says
Bland belongs in the Populist ranks. Gor
man says it is not Democratic to put coal
and iron on the free list, and Vest says it
is Democratic to have out and out free
trade. Olney says that the man who is
not in favor of the gold standard knows
nothing about Democracy, and Altgeld
says that* the man who believes that
Democracy stands for anything in the
money line but bimetallism should bny
himself a dictionary and find out what the
meaning of the word is. But, anyway, the
convention will resemble Joseph's coat,
politically speaking.

A CHILD'S PRETTY APRON.
Here is an apron which combines pictur
esqueness with utility. It is developed charm
ingly in any of the dainty white stuffs, such
as nainsook, dimity, lawn and cambric. An
inexpensive decoration consists of a very nar
row Valenciennes insertion let in at the top of
the hem on sleeves and revers. Another trim
mine which is dainty and not costly is a nar-
row frill of Valencienne lace of the Italian
mesh set on the edfces. Narrow edges of em
broidery set on flat recommend themselves on
the score of easy laundering.
Aprons of pretty light coiors are a possi
bility, for the colored nainsooks wash admir
ably. It may be had in many colorsâ pink,
coulnur de rose, blue and pale green.
Uhingham in checks and stripes makes very
serviceable aprous and need not of necessity
be in colors which do not please a child's eye.
Stripes of pink and white on blue and white
wash quite as well as the dull grays and
browns. A pretty contrast is obtained by
using a plain color for the revers. Or make the
apron of plain pink, with sleeves and revers of
striped pink and white.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"There is more activity in and about the
gold mines of Grass Valley," said George
Fletcher of that place yesterday at the Pal
ace, "than there has been for many years. I
have lived there almost steadily ever since
1864, and have kept track of everything
well.
"Though I am a railroad man I was once the
owner of the old Banner mine, and have been
in mining more or less ever since.
"I expect that before a year from now there
will be 1000 more miners at work in the
mines of Grass Valley than now. There Is a
lot of hurry and bustle around there, com
pared with what there used to be. Every
where you go you see a certain activity. It
looks as though we are going to have very
prosperous times.

property and has a very fine prospect.
"The old Gold Hill mine that has not been
worked for thirty years Is to be started again,

put in a 200-horse power electric plant there
and work the mine for all it is worth. That is
a very important thing for Grass Valley.
"The Allison's Ranch mine is also Etarting
up again. The owners, who consist of San

Nominating a man fora third Presidential

Only one free silver Stateâ Californiaâ has

been a hard blow.â St. Louis Star.
The fact is that the McKinley managers have

The fight in the Democratic National Conven

* Steel Tubingâ A. R., Summerland, Cal. The
latest method in manufacturing steel tubing
for bicycles is that patented by a mechanic in
Freeport, 111. He takes sheets of steel just the
length the tubing is to be, turns inwardly a
narrow flange on each of the two ends that are
to come together. The sheet is then rolled
into the shape of a cylinder. That brings the
two flanged edges together. A specially curved,
very narrow piece of steel is slid over the two
flanges, and then in the hollowfhat is formed
a special wire is run andwheTTthe tubing is
heated this wire melts and brazes the flanges
and jacket that cover it, making a perfect and
strong joint.

Mrsrc and Operaâ M. S., city, it is impos
sible to absolutely state who was or is tho
"most eminent musical composer of the
world." John Sebastian Bach might perhaps
be entitled to that distinction, but it must be
remembered thai Beethoven was the greatest
composer of symphonies, and the symphony
is generally considered tho highest form of
musical composition. There are many who
consider Richard Wagner the greatest of all
composers. The ten greatest oratorio writers
have been classed as follows: Handel, Bach,
Haydn, Gounod, Palestrina. Mendelssohn,
Caris-sime, Scarlatti, Graun and llasse. The
following named are Classed as the ten greatest
svmphonists: Beethoven, Wagner. -Mozart,
Haydn, Spohr, Schubert, Thalberg, Schu
mann, Masclieiles and Paderewski. Distinc
tion in the composition of grand opera is to a
great extent a matter of fashion, what one age
rejects, the otner accepts. Fifty years ago
"Tannhauser" was hissed off the stage and Ros
sini's works were adored. 1 1 seems no was if Ros
sini is in danger of being forgotten, while
Wagner needs no societies to propagate his
works. Several generations have considered
Mozart's operas the acme of good taste. Dut it
is the fashion in Borne musical circles to decry
them at present. It is impossible to say who
is "the supreme composer of grand opera," but
a glance of the repertoires of the leading opera
houses will give an idea of those who are con
sidered "supreme" at this time. The names
which occur most frequently are those of Wag
ner, Verdi and Gounod. A few years ago the
ten greatest writers of opera were classed as
follows: Mozart, Rossini, Wagner, Meyerbeer,
Beethoven, Uluck, Picini, Verdi, Gounod and
Donizetti.

Sailing Vessel Officers to
Be Examined for Com

NAVIGATION GRADUATES
The Travels of a Chart Around
the World in Search
of a Ship.
BELL BUOY FOR MILE ROCKS.
Philip Robbin, a Mendocino Rancher,
in Search of His WifeâWar
like Japs.
Of late there has been a desire on the
part of the ship-owners here to establish a
board of examiners, whose duty will be to
test the proficiency of captains and offi
cers sailing vessels in and out of San Fran-
I cisco. This is the only port in the civil
! ized world where persons in charge of sail
| ing craft are permitted to go and lome with
their ability as navigators unquestioned.
Anybody who can get a job on board a
vessel as skipper or mate can take charge
and bump his ship up against the first
rock he approaches and render no account
to any lawful authority.
The underwriters, who are supposed to
be interested in dach matters, are indiffer
ent because in the caÂ«e of wreck or loss the
fact that the vessel's officers are without
certificates of competency gives the ma
rine Insurance companies an opportunity
to contest the payment of the policies.
There are a number of so-called schools
of navigation in the City that promise for
a stipulated sum to make their pupils com
petent navieators in a given time. W T hen
the term of schooling has expired, the
student is given a sort of diploma, which
sets forth the recipient's proficiency to
navigate a ship all over the world, and no
other official sanction is required.
Recently Edmund H. and Alfred D. Mo-
Nevin of the McNevin School of Nay Ra
tion brought the que stion of competency
on the part of coast ship officers before the
Chamber of Commerce, and that body ap
pointed a com niittee to investigate the
matter. After due deliberation they made
the following report.
To the Chambrr of Commerce: Your com
mntee nas considered the question of the ex
amination by authority of the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco of officers in the
merchant marine, and respectfully report that
the objectionable features of the recent method
are evident. They afford no security to the
ship-owner or underwriter and are of little or
no benefit to the recipient of a navigation
school certificate outiide of the limits wherein
the examiners may be personally known as
competent to perform their duties. In ail
large marine ports of European nations and at
New York such certificates of competency In
navigation and seamanship are issued by" the
official authority of some organized (jro'vern
nieut or commercial body.
It is evident to your committee that the like
procedure at Â»an Francisco will be of decided
advantage to its maritime and commercial in
terests.
Consequently we respectfully recommend
that the honorable board of trustee? of the
Chamber of Commerce appoint two official ex
aminers, who shall be members of the cham
ber, to hold office at the pleasure of the board, I
who shall be competent in navigation, nauti
cal astronomy and practical seamanship, and I
authorize them to examine all applicants ap
plying to them for certificates of competence;
that the Issuance of said certificates shall de
pend also on proofs of sobriety, actual service
and goo 1 character; that they shall be issued
to American citizens proficient in the English
language and of legal ape; that the chnrpe
for each certificate shall be fixed by the
board of trustees and a record thereof be
kept stating all particulars necessary for

In the early part of 1891 a chart was
mailed from the Navy Department, Wash
ington, to tfie United Slates steamer
Adams at Mare Island. The vessel sailed
for Port Townsend before the package
reached her, and it was dispatched to her.
Again she sailed before the chart caught
her, and the roll of parchment faithfully
followed the war vessel lrora port to port
to Sitka, through Bering Sea, and down
the coast of Central America.
A few days ago ti at chart reached this
City, still hunting the ship. During its
five years of wandering over the ocean it
has become ornamented with many post
marks, addresses and unique inscription*.
One naval captain wrote: "If this pack
age conies to my ship again I will heave it
overboard." In another place somebody
has written: "This chart was at Port
Townsend in 1892," and "This was lost,
tound and then lost again." Another per
son, becoming weary of the oft return of
the voyaging package, has penned: "For
Heaven's sake find the Adams!" Even
the chart itself has been made to say:
"Please find my destination. Am sea
sick and weary of travel."
The Adams is at Honolulu, whither the
package will be mailed to-morrow.

CARPENTERS AND JOINERS.
Apprentices Permitted to Join the
L'niona at Half Rate.
An important meeting of the District
Council of Carpenters and Joiners was held
Wednesday evening. It was decided
that apprentices between the ages of 18
and 21 bhall be admitted into the car
penters' unions at half-rate initiation fee,
or for $5.
Heretofore the carpenters' unions have
only paid strike money to those men called
out on strike because "the bosses paid less
than the minimum rate, $3 for eight nours'
work. It was decided last evening to pay
the strike rate of $1 a day to those called
out on strike for the maintenance of all
union rules. Only union men in good
standing will be entitled to this considera
tion.
Several carpenters were before the conn
cil on charges of haying worked with non
union men. The first fine is $5. Half a
dozen, rather than pay the fine, hustled
around and induced the non-union men
with whom they were caught working to
send in their applications for membership.
By this sharp move the council was prac
tically powerless to impose fines, and con
sidered it an evil wind that blows no good."
TO BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT.
Park Policeman Dovi' Threat to Os-
liininl G. NeilÂ« hi
The case of Park Policeman James
Dow, charged with threats to kill by Os
mond G. Neilson, a milkman living at
1122 York street, was called in Judge
Low's court yesterday and continued till
to-day.
Neilson and his wife have not been liv
ing together for the past three months.
She lives at 1225 York street, and since
they separated Neilson says that Dow has
been visiting her three or four times a
week and had agreed to iurnish the money
to enable her to get a divorce.
Sunday night after Dow had left Mrs.
Neilson her husband met him and they
had some angry words, Dow pulling out
his revolver and threatening to blow
Neilson's brains out.
ANOTHER BIDDER APPEARS
Competition for the New Tele
phone Franchise Becomes
Lively.
The Original Ordinance Declared to
Be One-Sided and Unsatis
factory.
A new element was injected yesterday
into the fight that is now being made be
fore the Board of Supervisors for a new
telephone franchise by the presentation of
a second ordinance providing for the
privilege.
The ordinance originally proposed was
twice sent back to the Street Committee
for reconsideration because of matters
contained therein that were not satisfac
tory to the members.
General Friedrich, who has been urging
the claims of the parties who asked that a
second franchise be granted, appeared be
fore the committee and urged that the
franchise be advertised for sale at once,
claiming that the jokers that had been
mentioned in the franchise existed only in
the minus of those who were opposed to it.
"I have heard a great deaJ about jok
ers," said General Fnearich, "since this
company first appealed for a franchise. I
The only joker that I know of is in the
law itself, requiring the Supervisors to
put franchises up for sale. It is a well
known fact that that law was passed in
the interest of the big corporations, which
want to shut out competition and buy up
every franchise that is put up for Â«a'e.
The joker complained of is in the clause
whicn provides that the grantee of the
franchise must have at least 2000 contracts
with people who are patrons of the pres
ent monopoly. That chiuse was inserted
for the purpose of shutting out irresponsi
ble persons who will be willing to sell out
to ihe monopoly. It shows that we mean
business ana that we intend to give battle
to the monopoly. The only people who
can reasonably object to that clause are
the officers of the Bell Telephone Com
pany."
The committee took the matter under
consideration, and in the afternoon lis
tened to Herman de Laguna, who said he
represented heavy capitalists who were
ready to invest their money in t^e tele
phone business as soon as they could be
assure'! that a franchise could be obtained.
He declined to give the names of the
backers of the s<cbeme because the pub
lishing of the names might arouse lil
feeling between them and the officers and
stockholders of the present company. He
said that the franchise that had been pro
posed was one sided, incomplete and with
out certain legal requirements that were
necessary to make it available.
He declared that these points were all
covered by the company he represented.
In regard to rates lie stated that the
people he represented would reduce the
expense of telephones in private houses to
f J a mouth with an unlimited number of
local switches free, and the telephones to
$5 a month, with 1 cent for each switch.
He stated that his people were willing to
sprnd $600 000 in establishing the system,
$100,000 to be expended in the first twelve
months. One hundred telephones would
be given the City free and 150 after the
first ten years. The matter was taken un
der consideration.
EIGHT-HOUR LAW.
The PalntÂ«ra' Union Seeki to Get a
Test Case Before the
Court*.
Business Agent R. T. Mclvor of the
Painters' Union called at the office of the
United States District Attorney yesterday
and asked for a warrant for the arrest of
the foreman of the California Paint Com
pany on a charge of violating the eight
hour law. Mclvor alleged that the paint
ers engaged in putting the finishing
touches on the battle-ship Oregon had
been compelled to work nine hours a day
or more.
The law covering this point is not very
clear, stipulating among other things that
men may be worked over eight hours if
tLe conditions surrounding the particular
work will not admit of de^vy.
District Attorney Foote is of the opin
ion that the law is not capable of enforce
ment because of its wording. He has
taken the case under advisement, how
ever, and will render an opinion in a few
days. Mclvor's action is not hostile to tne
foreman of the paint company, but is
prompted by a deoire to test the eight-hour
law.
John Things' Peculiar Death

SUICIDE FOLLOWS
A BRUTAL MURDER
Mrs. L. Aweng Assassinated
by Alva E. Shep
herd.
HE THEN TAKES HIS LIFE
The Murderer Used a Keen-Edged
Razor to Commit the
Ghastly Deed.
NO MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME.
Shepherd Was a Religious Fanatic and
Committed the Deed While
Insane.
Lying cold in death, surrounded by
pools of crimson blood which had eushed
from fearful wounds in their throats, the
bodies of Alva E. Shepherd and Mrs. L. E.
THE MURDERER AND THE VICTIM OF HIS DEADLY RAZOR.
Aweng were found in a small bedroom at
205 Seventh street last evening, at 7
o'clock.
The woman had been murdered by j
Shepherd, who for many months had
posed as her friend and protector, and he
then committed suicide, using a keen
edged razor, the same weapon with which ;
he had murdered Mr:-. Aweng, to do the !
deed.
The couple had not been seen since 7
o'clock yesterday morning, and as no
sound was heard coming from their apart
ments during the day the suspicions o!
those occupying the upstairs rooms were
aroused. Last evening M. S. Norton and
Mrs. S. Derman concluded to investigate.
They entered the front door of the build
ing, but on reaching tne bedroom door, at
the end of the hallway, they found it
locked. This being unusual, they forced
the lock and were horrified at the ghastly
spectacle of the double tragedy.
Word was immediately sent to the Cen
tral Police Station and from there to the
Coroner's office. Deputy Coroners J. G.
Tyrrell and L. Mclnnes went to the scene
of tlie crime and removed the remains to
the Morgue.
When discovered the body of the mur
dered woman was lying on the bed, her
face turned slightly to the left. She was
attired in her nightdress, and was proba
ble asleep when the crime was committed.
A fearful gash in her throat, which
nearly severed the head from the body,
showed only too plainly how she had met
her death. Mrs. Aweng had been an
invalid for some time, and near her
bed was a large bouquet of calla lilies,
fehe turned toward the flowers, probably,
just as the knife severed the veins and
arteries in her neck and the bouquet was
drenched with her blood.
Shepherd, the murderer and suicide,
was lying on his face between the bed and
the south wall of the room. He had cut
his own throat in a manner more shock
ing even than he did the woman's.
When an attempt was made to lift the
remains into the receiver it was found
that death had taken place many hours
before the discovery of the body. A razor
was discovered clenched between the stii
fened ringers of the man. So tight was
the grasp that for a time they absolutely
refused 10 release the death-inflicting
weapon.
What motive could have prompted
Shepherd to commit the murder and then
kill himself? This is a mystery ; but it is
presumed that the murderer was tempo
rarily insane at the time he committed the
deed. Mrs. Aweng was addicted to the
use of morphine in life, and ac it is known
that Shepherd was a spiritualist and op
posed to the use of any drug, this fact
may have led to the murder.
In a notebook found by the side of the
murderer's body is scrawled a note which
gives strength to this theory. It rea>is as
follows: "Blessing. Depend on God,
Christ the spirits; may his will be done.
God commands no morphine. Inspira
tional doctor clairvoyant."
Shepherd probably went into the
woman's room and detected her in the
act of taking a dose of morphine, and be
coming angered cut her throat and then
his own.
Shepherd often posed as Mr?. Aweng's
cousin, but it is not believed ihat any re
lationship, other than mere' friendship,
existed between them. Mr^. Aweng oltcn
went by the name of Mrs. Hader, which
was her first husband's name. He has
been dead for many years.
L. E. Aweng, the husband of the mur
dered woman, is at present residing in
the State of Sonora, Mexico, and letter
among Mrs. Aweng's effects show that he
sent her considerable money at short in
tervals. He corresponded regularly. Mrs.
Aweng aiso leaves a daughter in Los An
geles, Cal., and relatives in Virginia.
It was ascertainerl| |from Shepherd's
effects that he had relatives living in Char
lotsville, Va., and that he leaves a mother
in Gilroy. Cal. /

FORESTERS STILL AT OUTS
Dissatisfied Members Talk of
Organizing a New
Order.
Tempestuous Ending of the Recent
Supreme Annual Session
at Ukiah.
A storm cloud still hovers over the
Grand Court of Foresters. The troubles
of the annual session, just held at Ukiah,
are far from being amicably settled. In
fact, it would seem now that the wrangling
gome on at present is very likely to end in
a more or less serious division in the ranks
of the Foresters. "The whole trouble,"
said Miss Flynn, junior past preceding
officer of the Companions of the Forest,
last night, "might be summed up in the
words, 'Too much Falconer.' The faction
of which Falconer is the head is respon
sible for nearly all the trouble that has
arisen. The actions of the members of
tliis faction in making up slates in caucus
and trying vo engineer their schemes
through the convention so disgusted many
of the delegates that they left the conven
tion in a body.
"The trouble originated in a discussion
over the books of the secretary who has
just retired. A majority report of the
auditors passed favorably upon the secre
tary's books. A minority report, however
presented by R. N. McClennan, found
fault with the manner in which the books
had been kept, but made no charges of
discrepancy in the accounts. The books
showed that sums of money had been dis
bursed greater t an the amount on hand.
The secretary, Mrs. Roy, was reported to
have borrowed $500 from a Mrs. Boehm.
All this, however, was mere rumor, yet it
produced a feeling of uneasiness and dis
satisfaction among the delegates. The
minority report of Mr. McClennan was re
ceived with hisses by the Falconer faction.
"Many of the dissatisfied delegates had
already left the convention and thet^o
factions were about equal in numbers.
Mrs. Roy was put up for supreme chief
companion by thu Falconer faction and
elected by a majority of one vote. After
the faction had elected the other State
candidates the convention was broken up
and the installation of the newly elected
officers waÂ» postponed until last evening,
when the State candidates were to be in
stalled at Foresters' Hall in this City.
"Most of the dissenting delegates re
mained for the ball that was Riven after
the convention. Owing to the division
and quarreling that had taken place
during the session the festivities that were
to close the convention ended in a fiasco.
The dissenting delegates are especially in
dienantat the manner in which the people
of Ukiah, who entertained them royally,
have been treated.
"As the matter now stands the Falconer
faction has the upper hand. Those of us,
however, who witndrew from the conven
tion will never go back while Mrs. Roy re
mains at the head of the order. It is
quite possible that the seceding members
may organize a new order entirely inde
pendent of the old."
MEDALS FOR WINES.
Honors Bestowed on the Late Tlburcio
Parrott's Vintages at Atlanta.
Medals have been received at the State
Board of Trade from Director-General
C. A. Cullier of the Atlanta Exposition â
the medals being confe rred for wines sent
to the exposition by the late Tiburcio Par
rott before his death. The first is a gold
medal accompanied by a diploma of honor,
which explains that the medal is "awarded
to Tiburcio Parrott of Villa Parrott, Cali
fornia, lor an exhibit of tt.e Nuntrachet
tope of white burgundy, meritorious for
the fineness of bouquet and general excel
lence."
The second is a bronze medal accom
panied by a diploma of honorable mention
"for an exhibit of burgundy wine."
The Expenses of a Horse.
Judge Seawell was interested in horseflesh
yesterday. The title to the racehorse Pasha
was contested before him, and a rather mixed
case was presented. The horse originally be
longed to C. D. Bishop, a jockey, who sold a
half interest in the animal to J. s. Macintosh
for Bishop bought the horse from Frank
Van Ness. The Public Administrator appears
in the case as administrator of Bishop's estate,
Bishop having been killed in the East. Mac
intosh had raced the animal in the mean
time, and he had won purses to the amount of
$690. Macintosh wanted to put in a bill to
Bishop's estate for $Â«O0 training expenses, but
the claim was made that the winnings ought
to be enough to pay those. R. Porter Ashe was
finally appointed referee to examine into the
it â ms of expense, and the question of owner
ship was laid over until his report has been ac
cepted.

VINING'S EYE ON
A NEW LEAK
Tenth and Howard Streets
May Soon Have a Trans
fer Agent.
TRANSFERS SOLD THERE
The General Manager Speaks of
the Operations of the
Check System.
PLEASED WITH PAST RESULTS.
Claims That Seventy-five Dollars a
Day Is Being Saved for the
Company.
So far from feeling in any degree per
turbed or discourageu by the untoward in
cidents that have developed from the
inauguration of the new transfer system
at the corners of Powell and Market and
Third and Market streets, or by the threat
ened action of the Supervisors to abolish
the system, the Market-street Railway
Company is considering the extension of
the system to the Howard and Tenth
streets corner, the point where, next to
those already protected, the largest
amount of transferring is done.
General Manager E. P. Vining was asked
yesterday how the innovation was operat
ing, :>o far as the company's interests were
concerned.
He replied that, all things considered,
the plan was satisfactory, though there
were some little inconveniences that it
would be agreeable to see removed, and
added:
"It is working much more smoothly
than at iirst, when people forgot to ex
chance their cheeks for transfers or aid
not know just where to iind the transfer
agent.
"We have not had a case reported for
the pa3t week in which a person forgot to
niiike the proper exchange fur a transfer
before boarding hi? car. The trouble that
has been occasioned by people insisting on
riding on checks has been premeditated in
every case, 1 believe."
"Then you will continue the present
system in force?" was asked.
"Certainly. It is the best thine we can
do, under the circumstances, to" protect
our business. It has effected a wonderful
saving in our revenue at these two points,
and we have about sixty places where we
transfer; but the.-c two enjoy the largest
basincsa of this kind. Tenth ami Howard
streets is the third largest transfer point,
and there is considerable of this objection
able traffic in transfers carried on there,
which we shall have to stop."
"Is it, then, the intention to extend the
new chesk-transfer system to that point?"
'We shall have to do so, unless we lind
some other way of preventing the com
-1 any from being robbed," answered Mr.
Vining. who then went into the 7,' hole
transfer question, as viewed by himself, as
follows:
Our position in relation to transfer involves
a consideration cf the purpose for which trans
fers are issued.
Most of our Urge American cities have a
smali and compact business district, from
which street railway line* radiate to all the
residence sections of the city, so that nearly all
the people are able to travel back and forth
between thtir homes and their places of busi
ness by through street-car lines without trans
fer.
The business interests of San Francisco,
however, are widely scattered, and the City is
bo laid out th!U noiwitlistauding the fact that
the number of miles of Btreet-car lines is
larger in proportion to the population than in
almost any other city in the world, there are
many citizens who canuot get from their
homos to their places of business by any
through line, and they are therefore compelled
to make one or more transfers on their way.
A trnnsfer is always objectionable, and Is
used only as the best practicable substitute for
a through line of cars in cases in which it is
impracticable to ruu the cars through without
change.
It is well understood, in cases in which cars
run through, that a single 5-cent fare pays for
only a single continuous trip in one direction.
Passengers do not expect permission to leave
the car and transact business and then enter
another car and continue the trip all for a
single fare, and they do not exact permission
to leave the ear and give their places to other
passengers all for a single fare; neitherao pas
bengers expect to be permitted to make n
rouml trip and come back to the polut from
which they started all for a single fare.
Our transfers are issued only for the purpose
of giving passengers as nearly as possible the
same accommodations which they would hnvi
in case the car ran through to the desired des
tination â that is to say, they are given for the
purpose of enabling a passenger to make a
siugle continuous trip in one general direc
tion, and 6uch trip should be continued by
taking at the proper junction or crossing point
the first car of ihe proper line leaving or pass
ing Laid point in the proper direction after the
passenger's arrival thereat.
He&M it is not proper that a passenger trav
eling upon a westbound car ana transferring
to a north or south bound tar should be given
a second transfer to an castbound car which
would take bim back near to his original start
ing point. Neither should a transfer be con
sidered good for passage on any other than the
designated line on pars traveling in the desig
nated direction, or for passage from any other
place than the designated junction or cross
ing. Neither should a transfer wnich is givn
to v passenger for his own use be turned over
for use by another person.
It is unfortunately tne case that among 350,
-000 people there will always be some who are
dishonest, ana many morewho are either mis
informed or thougntiess; hence many of the
transfers that thus company has issued have
been misused in Scjch a manner as to defraud
tlie company of a considerable percentage o.
its legitimate earnings.
It i- well known, .or instance, to nearly every
citizen of San Francisco that passengers leav
ing tne cars at the junction of Powell and Mar
k.-t -trt-ets have been aesniled and almost as
saulted by a crowd of boy.Â«, begging lor trans
iers, and that a very large proportion of trans
fers j.-sued at that point have been misused.
Very many of the passengers arriving at that
Corner do not desire or intend to go any fur
ther, their business calling them to some one
of the hotels, theaters or stores in that neljch
bood. Nevertheless it has been the practice
ot very many of these passengers to take a
tran.-fer and give it away. It has even been
the practice of a number of reputable business
men to take such a transfer and give it to a
boy in the morning, and then to obtain a trans
fer from the same boy In the evening, and thus
make a rouna trip from and to their homes for
k Mntrle 5-cent farr-, the boy's profit in the
transaction being obtained from Ihe occasional
tale of a newspaper, ho, too, many ladies, ac
tuated by the most charitable motives, have,
taken transfers to give to the boys, without
Hopping to thi;ik that they were thereby aid
ing a fraud upon the rai road company and
were helping to tc-ach the boys to try to obtain
money iv questionable ways, rather tiian by
honest labor.
Although nearly every one has seen some
thing of the traffic in transit'!-*, yet it is proba
ble that very few have had any realization of
the great extent to which it has Deen carried on.
The business hns not been entirely broken
up, nut our statistics show that without any
perceptible change in the volume of business
we are, under the transfer-agent system, issn
itiK bOO transfers per day less at the corner oi
Third and Markets streets than we did before.
At the corner of Powell and Market streets the
niminution of transfers upon the Powell-street
line has been about 800 per day and upon the
Eddy-street line about 100 per day.
lu'eacn ease the reduction in the number of
transfers has been accompanied by a corre
hpondine Increase in the number of cash fares.
Jt is therefore evident the t the change in the
transfer system has cut off 1500 fraudulent
transactions per day, Ijsf each of which trans
actions throe parties were engaged.
Although 5 cents is a small sum. 1500 times
5 cents, or if7s per day, or $i 27,000 per year, is
not v small sum.
Jt is the duty of the officers of the company
which has been defrauded of this amount to
put a stop to such v loss if possible. For this
purpose the method of handling the business
by transfer apents, which experience else
where hns shown to be the simplest and most
effective for the purpose, has been adopted.
It Is of course to be expected that any new
system will l>e accompanied by more or less
friction in its first operation. It is also to be
expected that blackmailers, whose one object
in life is to howl loud enough to induce some
one to pay them to keep quiet, will exercise
their lnmgs to tue best of their ability; tha;
they will be joined by ail whose sympathy
witii dishonesty in such that they resent any
' effort to eontrnl it, ami that many well-mean
! intc people who have not given' the subject
careful consideration will be led away by bucli
: clamor and will be iuducod unthiukiugly to
Join them.
N( verthi-less, the fact remains that the
I handling of the transfer business by a transfer
' agent la thr best practicable means of conduct
inn t tie business where the number of trans
!. r- is at all large. It is the method most gen
erally in force throuehout the country, and
now i hat it is generally understood it will be
found much more convenient and much freer
from annoyance than the old system, which
compelled ' passengers to fight their way
through a swarm of clamorous boys.
Tlic iact is worthy of consideration that the
I great majority of the million transfers per
| week issued by this company are given wholly
I as a matter of business policy, as a mean*, as
! far Kb practicable, of enabling passengers to
! make a >ingle continuous trip in one general
| direction, between such termini as they may
desire, for a single 5-cent fare.
The improper use of the transfers that have
been given prevents extensions of the privi
lege and compels the enforcement of a num
ber of rules which would otherwise be un
necessary. The public has therefore even
more interest in breaking up the abuses than
has the Market-street Railway Company, and
if the facts could be laid before the people and
given the proper consideration the public
would gladly co-operate in the effort to break
up existing abuses, resulting in the benefit of
all concerned.

RANSACKED THE HOUSE
Burglars Visited the Residence of
John E. Greene on Haight
Street.
The Family Away at the Butchers'
Picnic, Shell Mound Park, at
the Time.
John E. Greene, deputy Assessor, re
ported at police headquarters yesterday
morning that burglars had visited his
house at 913 Haight street and carried off
a number of valuable articles and some
money.
Mr. Greene and his family left the
house Wednesday morning and went to
iShell Mound Park to the butchers' picn'c.
Before leaving all the windows and the
front and rear doors were carefully locked.
The family returned hom>* about 6
o'clock in the evening and as soon as the
house was entered there was painful evi
dence of the fact that burglars nad been
busy during their absence.
Every room in the house had been ran
sacked for plunder. Bureau drawers had
been emptied and their contents strewn
over the floors. Kve n the beds had been
s arched for money ai.d jewelry that
might be concealed there. The burglars
had apparently been satisfied that they
had plenty of time and no place escaped
being searched.
Among the articles stolen are a valuable
gold bracelet with a diamond in the center,
a revolver, $12 in coin and a number of
other valuable articles of jewelry and
silverware.
Entrance was effected by prying open
one of the rear windows with a 'â¢jimmy."
Several men were working on an adjoin
ing building all day, but they did not see
the men breaking into the bouse for the
reason that the window, which was found
open, was hidden from them by the pecu
liar construction of the building.
Two mm who were pedaling potatoes
were seen in the neighborhood on Wednes
day, and the police suspect them of the
burglary. They answer the description of
he peddlers who broke into a residence on
Leavenworth street, near O'Farrell, two or
three weeks asro, and carried off over $1000
worth of jewelry.
BURGLAR`S PLANT.
Stolen Jewelry liecovered la Buena
Vista Park.
The residence of Mrs. Blemis, 37 Second
street, was entered by burglars on Monday
afternoon during her absence. Entrance
was effected by openiug the front door
with a false key. Several hnndred dollars,
worth of jewelry which was kept in a tin
box was stolen.
Yesterday morning three boys, James
Campbell, a pou of Policeman Campbell
Kobert Peters and Curtis Rich and two
virls were playing in Buena Vista Park
when they found a portion of the stolen
jewelry. The police were not:* ; ed, and
Detective Harry Reynolds went oat to the
Dark and discovered the tin box with the
emainderof the jewelry in it. The only
thing missing was a $5 gold piece.
Saving* Bank* I>epo*lta.
Some time ago the Bank Commissioners
asked the opinion of the Attorney-General as
to whether or not officers of banks having a paid
up capital of $300,000 or more and who are
authorized to do business as savings as well as
commercial banks can legally borrow the
deposits in their vaults. The Attorney-General
lias replied that under the law the bankers arc
prohibited from doing so. The bankers of the
State are being notified by the Commissioners
of Mr. Fitzgerald's interpretation of the law.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1896.
PYTHIAN KNIGHTS
AND TERPSICHORE.
An Evening Devoted to Wor
ship at the Goddess'
Shrine.
NO FOREIGN RITUALS.
Rathbone Sisters Elect Officers
and Adjourn Till Next
Year.
C. L. PATTON GRAND PRELATE
Ten Immortals Abolish the Numeral
and Initiate a Hundred
Curious Knights.
Promptly at 10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing the Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias
was called to order Dy Grand Chancellor
Samuels, and the opening ceremonies
' harles L. Patten, the Newly Elected Grand Prelate of the Knights of Pythias.
were briefly performed, as the convention
is drawing to a close and the many im
portant items yet remaining demanded
expedition. The body eipects to adjourn
at noon to-day.
One first chancellor remained on whom
the Grand Lodge rank was to be conferred.
Though he bemoaned the fact that his lot
was as lonely as Twain's ambitious coy
ote-hunting dog his trials were soon over
and the business of the day was begun.
A resolution was adopted fixing the
time for the election of grand officers at 3
o'clock in the afternoon. By the unwrit
ten law of the order C. F. Mc<ilashan, it
was conceded, would succeed Samuels as
grand chancellor and would be succeeded
by \V. H. Grant, grand prelate.
Representative Calegarisof Roma Lodge,
who introduced the resolution asking the
supreme representatives to do their utmost
to have the rituals printed in other than
the English language, spoke to the reso
lution. He made an eloquent speech, and
concluded by asking permission to with
draw his resolution, which was granted.
This effectually disposed of the ritual
proposition, which had caused such fervid
oratorical outbursts on the preceding day.
Representative Caligaris was induced to
withdraw this resolution on account of the
fact thai so large a majority was opposed
to it that there was no chance whatever
for it to be adopted.
Perhaps the most earnest opponent of
foreign rituals was Supreme Representa
tive Stanton L. Carter, whose patriotism
has led him to oppose it whenever occa
sion offered.
A motion to limit the speeches to five
minutes' duration was adopted. This was
a sore disappointment to those desiring to
emulate the great Athenian orator, but, as
the grand chancellor took occasion to ex
plain, it was absolutely necessary in order
to expedite the work.
A resolution instructing the supreme
representatives to use their best effort to
have repealed the law which prohibits re
tail liquor-dealer-t fr"m becoming members
was tabled by a vote of 171 to 1.5. This
resolution excited a deal of debate, and it
became apparent that the rule limiting
speeches to five minutes was a shrewd ex
ample of politic engineering.
The following resolution was unani
mously adopted:
Whereas, It is a fact easily recognized by
those who have studied the rise and progress
of the order of Knights of Pythian wherever it
has been established within this grand do
main, that in those localities wnere the Uni
form Rank has been organized and maintained
the order is the most prosperous ; and whereas,
we believe the establishment and encourage
ment of this branch of our o-der Is one of the
best means whereby the influence end stabil
ity of the subordinate lodges can be promoted;
therefore be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Grand
Lodge tnat the active encouragement of the
organization of the I'niform Hank, wherever
there is a sufficient number of Knights to
warran 1 such organizntion, wouid prove one
of the most ellicient means in maintaining the
interest and making jiermauent the member
ship of the subordinate lodges; and be it
further
Resolved, That this Grand I^dÃe recom
mends to all Knights and to all subordinate
lodges, wherever conditions nre at all favor
able, that they encourage by all legitimate
means the organization and maintenance of
divisions of tne Uniform Rank.
At 12 o'clock a recess was declared until
1:30 r. m., when the grand chancellor,
upon request of the delegates, agreed to
exemplify the secret work of the order.
Owing to the general excitement that
nervaded the assemblage over the election
of officers, to occur as soon as the body
again convened, and the wire-pulling for
candidates, the knights did not begin the
afternoon session until an hour later than
the time set for commencement.
After 2 o'clock the hall presented the ap
pearance of a political convention. By
precedent the election of the grand chan*
cellor and vice-chancellor was settled in
advance. The battle was over the election
of the grand prelate. The leading candi
dates were Charles L. Patton of San Fran
cisco and H. R. Arndt of San Diego. Any
way the friends of these two gentlemen
seemed to be laboring the most diligently.
Another feature that added a political
aspect to the scene was the light between
the towns of Red Bluff, Hantord and Pas
adena for the honor of entertaining the
next Grand Lodge.
The advocates of Hanford seemed the
keenest political wire-pullers, while the
representatives of the other two towns set
up a rivalry to Patti and Lind in singing
the praises of their abodes. At 2:20 the
gavel rapped and stopped the discussion.
Prior to the election of officers there was
a debate on the question of mileage. The
committee recommended 10 cents per mile
one way, and an amendment was offered
making it 5 cents per mile. On vote the
only men who fayored the amendment
were those who made the speeches in sup
port of it. The mileage allowed in the
future will be 10 cents a mile one way.
Nominations for officers were declared
in order at 3:30 o'ciock. Supreme Repre
sentative Crowley placed Vice-Chancellor
McGlashan in nomination for grand chan
cellor. Past Grand Lindsay seconded the
nomination. Nominations were closed,
and Grand Master-at-Arms Lehman was
instructed to cast the ballot for Mc-
Glashan.
Past Grand Chnrch nominated W. H.
Grant of Woodland, the present grand
prelate, for grand vice-chancellor. The
nomination was seconded by Past Grand
W. C. Grave;. Nominations were closed
and the election was made by acclamation.
The nominees for erand prelate were
Charles L. Patton of San Francisco, W. A.
McKinder of St. Helena and H. R. Arndt
of San Diego. The two latter gentlemen,
in very neat and pleasant speeches, with
drew from the contest, leavingonly Patton
in nomination, and he was elected by ac
clamation.
Representative Levy of San Francisco
placed the present grand keeper of records
and seal. Herman Schaffner, in nomina
tion to succeed himself. The nomination
was seconded by Barcar of Suisun. There
were no other nominations and Schaffner
was elected by acclamation. As an evi
dence of the esteem in which Schaffner is
held it may be stated that this is his
eleventh annual re-election.
For grand master of exchequer Banker
S. G. Little oi Dixon was re-elected by ac
clamation.
For grand master-at-arms there were
two nominations, Thomas E. Hudgeon
and Charles O. Alkire. The votes cast
numbered 219. Alkire received 113 and
Hudgeou 100. That the men were about
equally supported is shown by Alkire's
small majority.
The nominees for grand inner guard
were the incumbent. E. H. Warren of East
Oakland, and T.H. Blackman of Stockton.
Blsdcman was elected, the vote standing
120 for him and 55 for Warren.
J. H. Johnston, who has served twelve
terms as grand outer guard was re-elected
by acclamation for the t irteenth term.
The nominees for grand trustees were:
D. W. Bailor, Alfred Perrier, I. I. Irwin, C.
O. Clarke and J. W. Guthrie. Three were
to be elected.
A ballot resulted in the election of Per
rier, Irwm and Clarke. Perrier succeeds
himself.
The meeting then adjourned until to
day, with the members looking forward
pleasantly to the reception to be given in
the evening at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
The ten immortals, a feature of the
last year's session of the Grand Lodge, was
revived, but the numeral was stricken from
the name of the order. They have been
busily initiating candidates into this social
order during the week at Pythian Castle
between the hours of 12 and 1 in the after
noon and H and 9 in the evening. The to
tal membership up to last night was 109.
Wednesday evening ZÂ»rin Capi Temple
No. 52, D. O. K. X., started a pilgrimage
from Pythian Castle across the desert.
Their trip would put George Francis Train
to the blush, as they made the journey
and return trip in less than two hours.
No fatalities recorded.
The reception and ball were a magnificent
affair. They were tendered the Grand Lod^e
by the subordinate lodges of this City,
and no pains were spared to make them a
success.
Both the Grand Lodge and the Grand
Temple were out in force, and the most
distinguished society people of the com
munity giaced the assemblage by their
presence.
The music for the occasion was rendered
by the Fifth Artillery Band. The grand
stand of the band, as well as the walls,
arches, platforms and refreshment stands,
were festooned with the colors of the
knights and the Stars and Stripes.
In addition to the usual lighting of the
pavilion the walls were studded with in
candescent lam ps.and here and there shone
tne initials of the lodge motto, wrought
in incandescent lamps. The brilliancy of
the scene was enhanced by the showy
uniforms of the uniform rank, which
abounded in the assemblage.
The exhibition drill by Mars Lodge No.
202 was skillfully executed, and the im
mense building fairly shook with the ap
plause it elicited.
Colonel A. Terrier acted as floor mana
ger, assisted by Ernest Ulman and G. S.
Backman.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" in its operatic
dress is proving quite a success at the
Tivoli Opera-house. The plantation melo
dies are catchy and the acting is above the
average.
AM the specialties at the Orpheum this
week are good. Miss Parry's imitations
of celebrities are especially good, and Miss
Cair's specialties are very "clever.
To-night at the Auditorium the Stan
ford University Glee and Mandolin clubs
will give their combined fareweil en
tertainment. There is a perennial charm
about a lot-of jolly college songs sung by
a lot of jolly collesre boys. The Glee Club
was organized three years ago and has
made a reputation by the concerts it has
viven in vacation time throughout the
State. The Stanford Glee Club has qnickly
fallen into the line of the older Eastern
clubs and has also come to the front this
year.

Supervisors to arrange for some suitable
celebration for the Fourth of July." Con

NEW SPECIES OF
BLUEBACK TROUT
Discovered in Lake Cres
cent by Admiral
Beardslee.
EXAMINED BY JORDAN.
Entirely Different From the
Truckee or Lake Tahoe
Varieties.
NAMED AFTER THE ADMIRAL.
Differs From Smaller Varieties in
Being of a Mere Silvery
Hue.
A new species of large trout was discov
ered by Admiral Beardslee of the Phila
delphia while he was in the northern
waters recently. The following descrip
tion of the new fish and the account of its
discovery were given yesterday by H. E.
Skinner of E. T. Allen & Co. :
"While traveling in Lake Crescent, Cial
lam County, Washington, Admiral Beard
slee, who fcas given considerable attention
and study to the salmon family, took a
considerable number of large trout, live
varieties oi which were unknown to the
admiral. One of these varieties differed
very greatly from known types and was
termed locally the 'blueback,' on account
of the intense indieo-blue coloration of its
back. The other four varieties, which
differed in a leÃs degree from accepted
types, were locally known as the speckled
trout, silver trout, mountain trout and
half-breed.
"Among those taken were five blue
backs, ranging in weight from 10% to UK
pounds, ana in length from 28 to Si inches
and aggregating in weight 55 pounds. The
speckled and silver trout were smaller, the
largest speckled trout weighing 4%
pounds. Both these varieties differed in
many respects from the trout of the same
num<- of Tahoe, Truckee and other Sierra
waters.
"Having been unable heretofore to sub
mit specimens of these fish to icthyologi
cal experts for identification, the admiral
has this year made efforts to remedy this
omission, and through the assistance of
friends at Port Angeles and Lake Cres
cent, specimens of the 'blueback' and
'speckled trout' have this spring been sub
mitted to Professor David Starr Jordan,
who declared ti.ey were evidently differ
ent from any other form he had ever seen,
and that they would have to have new
names. Accordingly, after receiving more
specimens, which confirmed his iirst judg
ment, at the earnest request of those in
terested and contributing the fish, Dr.
Jordan named the bluebacks S. beardsleei,
and the speckled S. crescentis.
"Amoni; the largest specimens of these
trout taken this year, up to April 19, were
a Beardslee (blueback) weighing 12
pounds and measuring 30 inches, and a
9^-pound Crescentis measuring 29}-^
inches, both taken by Mrs. George K.
Mitchell, and a 14-pound Beardslee, 32
inches lone, captured by Ben Lewis.
"The last-named fish, which is the big
one so far, was caught by Lewi? toward
sunset. After traveling twenty-eight
miles, rowing or walking all the way, he
arrived at Port Angeles at midnight and
gave the fish to Mr. Carrigan, who packed
it and forwardeu it to Professor Jordan.
The specimen was received in good order
by the professor, who declared he should
keep it as a tropny : 'It differs from those
of less size,' he says, 'only in that it is more
silvery (this may be on account of its com
parative freshness), and that it resembles
to some extent a steelhead, but that the
scales and heud are larger.'
'â¢Professor Jordan is preparing a paper
on these new and interesting tish. In the
Trout and Stream of New York there will
also soon appear an illustrated article by
Admiral Beardslee in regard to these trout.
"The taking of these large tish so early
in the year, earlier than has generally been
considered the season, indicates that there
is plenty of fun and scientific fishing to be
had at Lake Crescent. The field is oi>en
to any angler, and if anybody wants a new
trout named after him, he nr she has now
the chance."
SHORT LUNCH HOURS.
A regulative Bill for thÂ« Belief of
Store Kraployes.
In consequence of complaints made by
the Dry-goods Men's Association the
Labor Commissioner proposes to draw up
a bill to be presented to the next Legis
lature providing ior a longer time for
lunch for clerks and salesmen. The latter
fal their statement, said that at present
they are not allowed over thirty minutes
in which to get their noonday meals.
This is not time enough and it compels
the clerks to eat ai saloon lunch counters
and swallow what they eat without regard
to hygiene. Furthermore this system of
eating is demoralizing and tends to dissi
pation and dyspepsia.

REPUBLICANS AT HOME.
The New Wigwam Formally Opened by
the Presidio Heights
Club.
The Presidio Heights Republican Club
formally opened its new hall on Maple
street, near Clay, last night.
P. Kinzel owns the ground and built the
hall for the club. It is capable of seating
300 or 400 people and the ac
coustic properties are excellent. The in
terior was tastefully decorate:! in ever
greens, ferns and cilia lilies in honor of
the occasion, and the stars and stripes
waved from the flaestaff. The club has
given it the name of the "Wigwam."
George R. Sanderson, the president, was
ill. and J. D. Boyer, the second vice-presi
dent, presided. Short remarks were made
by several of the club members.
The club has a membership of ninety,
and an increase of one hundred is pre
dicted within the next two weeks.
The officers are: George R. Sanderson,
pre>iilent; If. Repenber^er, first vicr-
IÂ»rcsidcnt; J. D. Boyer, second vice-presi
dent; J. Voisinet, third vice-president;
C. P. Fonda, secretary.
The club's new wigwam is the third
meeting hall to be built by the Repub
licans in the district, and the members are
sanguine that it will be the scene of many
enthusiastic gatherings of loyal Repub
licans during the next few months.
LEROY G. HARVEY'S BOND.
C. S. Wright, One of the Sureties,
Wants to Bo Kplc:ihihl.
C. S. Wright of Gray & Co.. who is on
the bond of Leroy G. Harvey, charged
with embezzlement, contemplates a
speedy withdrawal from that responsibil
ity.
"In no way do I desire to make Mr.
Harvey's position harder than it is,"
stated Mr. Wright yesterday. "I was
called down from my home to his attor
ney's office and told ior the first time what
was wanted of me. 1 acquiesced to what
was asked and went on his bond, amount
ing to many thousands of dollars. I am
not in the habit of going on any one's
bonc!s, and would prefer to remain free of
such a thing. It is just as if I had a note
out, according to my understanding of the
situation, and 1 do not like the position.
"However, I went on Mr. Harvey's
bond, and I am still there. I w'll not
withdraw until he has secured another
bondsman to take my place."
COLORED AGE MUST REST
Mass-Meeting at Bethel Church
to Raise Funds for a
Home.
Only a Comparatively Small Sum Re
mains to Be Contributed for
Their Worthy Object.
Special interest attaches to the mass
meeting of the Old People's Home Associ
ation held at Bethel A. M. E. Church on
Powell street Tuesday. There was an en
thusiastic attendance.
Mrs. Harriet Smith presided with con
siderable ability. Mrs. J. H. Benson read
an excellent paper on woman suffrage,
which cause was also ably advocated by
Mrs. Dr. Kellogg- Lane and Mrs. Alice V.
Stocker. B. Morehead of Oakland sang an
effective solo.
The address of the evening was made by
Thomas Pearson, who in his introduction
paid a high compliment to the late Re
publican convention as "the most digni
fied, tearless and untrameied aggregation
of Kepublican intelligence that ever assem
bled in California, lie saia:
"Far easier would it be for the 'Misan
thrope' to turn back the swift waters of
the Nile or change the current of the Gulf
Stream from its course across trie Atlantic
than to stay the triumphal march of the
Old People's Home Association, which waa
incorporated under the laws of this State
in 1592, but made little or no progress until
1893, during which year the ladies col
lected $231 15, expenses $17 45; in 1894 $386,
expenses $27 70; in 1895 $805 52, expenses
$21 90. Total in bank up to date, $1355 62.
A site at Beulab, near Mills Seminary, Al
ameda County, thirty minutes' ride from
the city of Oakland, has been donated to
tb.6 association by George S. Montgomery.
"The ladies have decided to build when
they have $JOOO to their credit. Seven
hundred dollars is the requirement to
night. And we are bere for the purpose of
impressing that fact upon you, in the laud
able hope that you will become interested
and aid them in securing that rniount.
If you are not prepared to identify your
self with the enterprise to-night by a sub
stantial contribution to the fund your
pledge will be gladly accepted."
Was a Bad Order.
William Ryan is suing Mrs. M. E. Pleasant
for !fSOO. It is alleged that the money was in
the hands of A. J. Clunie. and that tne defend
ant presented to him an order from the plain
tiff directing him to turn the money over.
The order was procured, the plaintiff says, on
the representation that the money was to be
held as the property of the plaintiff, but In
stead, he says, the defendant has converted it
to her own use.
It is a common practice both in Africa
and China to use the ear as a pocket, as a
receptacle for small articles or coins.IN MEMORY OF
BARON DE HIRSCH
Highly Flattering Testimo
nials to a Charitable
Man.
HONORS PAID BY ALL.
Elaborate Memorial Services
Yesterday at B'nai B'rith
Hall.
A TRIBUTE TO PHILANTHROPY.
Addresses by E. J. Wolfe, Edmond
Tauszky and Father Yorkeâ Music
and Prayer.
An event long to be remembered with
pride by residents of San Francisco is the
memorial services \eid last night at B'nai
B'rith Hall under the auspices of District
Grand Lodge No. 4, I. O. B. 8., in honor of
the late lamented philantropist, Baron
Maurice de Hirsch.
Tne hall was tilled to the doors with a
vast crowd of ladies and gentlemen, Jews
and Gentiles, gathered together in peace
and amity and anxious to do homage to
the memory of the illustrious dead, whose
reputation for charity is as wide as the
boundaries of civilization.
At the rear of tfte stage upon a black
background, bordered with white, was dis
played a life-size portrait of Baron de
Hirsch, fittingly inscribed. In front and
under this portrait sat the president and
the orators. At the front and in the cen
ter of the stage was the speaker's stand
covered with ferns and roses, while along
each side of it and at convenient distances
stood pots of liliies and palms. The front
of the galleries was tastefully draped in
black and white bunting.
After an opening hymn, "Lord, Let Me
Know My Term of Days," by the choir,
comprised of Miss Daisy Cohn, soprano,
Mi*s J. Wilcox, contralto, A. Mesmer,
tenor, J. C. Hughes, basso, and E. J.
Stark, barytone, President Edward I.
Wolfe formally opened tbe exercises.
"We are met here to-night," he said, "to
crive honor to whom honor is due. Jews
and Gentiles, we are all prepared to sing
the praises of the most magnificent char
acter of the age â Baron Maurice de Hir?ch.
It.* life and character are typical of the
principles of the 1. O. B. 8., under whose
auspices this memorial is appropriated
held.
'â¢Though sectarian, our purpose is to up
lift humanity and inculcate in our people
the principles oi honor and patriotism.
Our mission is to dry t'.e tears of widows
and orphans, for we believe in the fath
erhood of God and the brotherhood of
man. Baron |de Hirsch was true to his
faith in life and death. Let us then, with
b and song, give praise to his deeds, |
which are not written in tbe shilting sands
of time, but will endure forever and in
spire man to nobler and higher thoughts
and actions."
The Rev. Dr. Kieto prayed that the men
tion, by the speakers, of the many good
deeds of Baron de Hirsch might be taken
as an example by all who heard them. He
was followed by the principal orator of the
evening, Edmund Tauszky.
"While this busy world goes on in its
hum irura way," said Mr. Tausztcy, "an
event occurs which toucnes all humanity,
and we pause in our daily vocations
caltnlv to contemplate it. Ho it is in
the death of Baron de Hirsch, whom we
have assembled here to honor. We may
now recall his many benefactions to man
kind, his loftj- aims and his almost unpar
alleled generosity. He was in every sense
of the word one of the chosen of God and a
< itizen of the world. The confines of his
r.ative Bavaria offered too limited a field
for his capabilities and opportunities. His
travels took him into many lands, which
he visited, not to survey the sumptuous
ness of temples, not to make accurate
measurements of the remains of ancient
grandeur, nor to form a scale of the curi
osity of modern art; not to collect medals
or collate manuscripts, but to dive into
the depth of dungeons, to plunge into the
infection of hospitals, to survey the homes
of sorrow and pain, to take the gautre and
dimensions of misery, depression and con
tempt, to remember the forgotten, to at
tend the neglected, to visit the forsaKen
and to compare and collate the distresses
of all men. His plan was as full of genius
as it was of humanity. It was a voyage of
discoveryâ a circumnavigation of charity â
and already the benefit of his labor is felt
more or less in every country.
"His fabulous fortune was amassed
mainly by his pluck and perseverance, but
his was not a soul to be content with the
mere possession and selfish use of illimita
ble wealth, which he looked upon as a sa
cred trust to be employed by him in the
betterment of mankind, and no other man
ever devoted so large a share of bis posses
sions to the good of the world.
"Baron de Hirsch knew the injustice
under which the people of our race suffered
in Russia and other countries and he did
all in his power to alleviate their con
dition. Pie at one time offered the Ku^sian
<.overnnient $10,000,000 for public instruc
tion, upon the sole condition that in ttie
u.se of the fund no distinction should be
made as to race or religion. He trans
ported an entire community of Jews
in Russia across Europe to the western
hemisphere. He purchased land for thou
sands in the Argentine Republic and
founded colonies there, spending in this
enterprise alone from $20,000,000 to $25,- j
O<JO,OOO. He established training schools,
and many institutions in Egypt, Turkey
and Asia Minor bear hn name as their
benefactor. In New York City be created
n fund of some $2,500,000 in aid of Russian
refugees.
"While the chief concern of Baron de
If irsch was for ourrace, his philanthropy
was not bounded by racial or religious
lines. In him the Jew of all countries
loses a friend and benefactor and the civil
ized world mourns with him."
p'ather P. C. Yorke. in the course of an
eloquent address, said: "Baron de
ilirsj' ]i had a heart and he loved bis fel
low men. He was the friend alike
of Jew and Gentile, yet he never
lacked the bacKbone to stand up for the
people of bis own blood. The Jews and
t!;e Iri^h have both been perseouted for 1
tl.eir race and their faith, but after having
tone through great tribulations ihev have I
come out pure and unscathed. Of the :
three virtues, faith, hope and charity, it I
lias been truly said that the greatest is .'
charity." :
Addresses were alfro delivered by tbe Rev. I
Dr. M. S. Levy of Beth Israel and Rabbi
\oorsanger. In the intervals came
hymns, anthems, solos, etc. The closing
prayer was repeated by the Rev. Dr.
1- ryer of Ohabai Shalorne and the exercise"
were concluded with au organ postlude.
"THE LAST WORD."
The l>aly Company Produces Another
Play From the Oerman.
The Daly Company evidently has a
fondness for Franz yon Bchonthan's plays,
for another of his comedies, "The Last
Word," was produced at the Baldwin
Theater last night. It was performed here
once or twice during the last engagement
of the company and will probably linger
longer in the Daly repertoire than
'â¢Countess Gucki" is likely to do, for
"The Last Word" has a good deal to
recommend it, and the excellent perform
ance accorded it last night was listened to
with keen appreciation by a large au
dience.
The chief merit in the drama is that it
chains Ada Kenan to a sympathetic role.
Her part does not overbalance the others,
however; thure is some construction to
the play and the dialogue, if a little cheap
in its w it, is of the kind that catches the
popular ear.
Ada Kenan in '-The Last Word" plays
the part of a fascinating Russian Baron
ess. Every playgoer must have observed
that in modern drama female members of
the Russian aristocracy are always phe
nomenally alluring and as a rule they turn
their power to nefarious ends. Baroness
Vera Baraneff is a good witch, however;
she blesses the lovers, melts tbe stony
hearted parents and scatteis blessings, as
well as captures hearts wherever she goes.
Ada Kehan was, as might have been ex
pected, delightfully winning ana effective
in the role. There were tears in not a lew
eyes during her scene with ths Roman
father, wtien she softened his sternness
by telling him the story of her little
brother's deatn. li would have been a
commonplace, perhaps even a tedious re
cital, in the moutii 01 an every -dav actress,
but Kehan treated it magnificently.
Her broken English was another feature
of i.er playing. Actors are so terribly
prone to make a jarcon spasmodic, over
doing it at one moment and forgetting it
at another, but the broken English of
Baroness liaraneff was consistent and
musical throughout.
The all-round casts was an excellent
one. George Clarke played the part
of the stern father to tbe life.
Charles Richman was natural and
convincing as his son; Hobart Bosworth
made a finished character study of the
small part of Moses Mossap. Edwin Varley
was a sympathetic oil music professor,
even though he did sing the bit of march
from an opera he was supposed to have
composed most cruelly out of tune. Miss
Helena Nelson, who played the ingenue
in "Countess Gucki," again distinguished
herself as Winny Rutherell, the professor's
daughter.
"The Last Word" will be repeated to
night.
FROM INTERIOR CHINA
Dr. C. W. Price Returns Here
After Seven Years' Ab
sence.
Phenomenal Use of Opium by Natives.
Conflict With Leopards, Wolves
and Panthers.
The Rev. Dr. C. W. Price and Mrs. Price
of lowa, for seven years past missionaries
of the American Board of the Congrega
tional Church in the strange province of
Shansi, China, are at the Occidental. They
are going home because of the poor health
of their son, and are uncertain whether
they will return.
Their missic- >york has been at a point
three days' travel from Tai Yuen Fu, the
capital of the province. It is a town of
some 20,000 people. The province itself
has about 5,100.000 people, so Mr. Price
says.
"Tbe capital lies in a plain, called the
Tai Yuen Fu," said he, "and to get there
one is obliged to cross over a range of
mountains. Every spot ten feet square of
these mountains that is fertile is culti
vated.
"The valley is rich and produces very
fine wneat, oats, buckwheat and a kind of
millet, which the natives use a creat deal
for food. These product! are crown by
irrigation. The valley is very beautiful,
except that it has very few trees, and what
are there nave been net out. *
'"The China Inland Missionary Society
has a good many missionaries there, and
we are beginning to have neighbors now.
One of these missions is fifteen miles
away and another but fifty.
"The natives seem to be taking to
the Christian religion. We are encour
aged by our success. We have had a house
ful of interested people every preaching
day for a good while. One bad thing is
the eeneral use of om'um. There is more
used there than in any other province, and
the effects are extremely hurtful.
"Among the wild animals, which luck
ily are not very plentiful, are leopards,
panthers and wolves. Wolves attacked a
man not long since and he was treated by
Dr. Atwood, a missionary there. There
was a man also, not far from us, who was
killed by a leopard."
Dr. and Mrs. Price had a rather rough
voyage over and were quite unwell on the
trip, 'lhey will start East on Monday.
GARCIA'S DOUBLE LIFE
A Deputy Marshal Who Has
Two Wives and Families
Living.
He Is Arrested For Failure to Provide
For His First Wife and Her
Children.
Fred Garcia, Deputy Marshal at Sausa
lito.was arrested Wednesday by Officer Mc-
Murray of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children on a warrant charg
ing him with failure to provide.
Garcia's matrimonial experiences were
prominently mentioned during the recent
municipal campaign in Sausalito. He has
been Jiv;ng there with a wife and one
child and another wife and five children
have been living in this City. Neither of
the wive? will swear to a complaint charg
ing him with bitramy, and in that respect
he is lucky.
The complaining w itness against him on
t be charge of failure to provideis Mrs. Dora
Bell ot a r >l Mission street. The first Mrs.
Garcia and her five cniidren, the oldest a
pretty girl 14 years of age, have been living
with Mrs. Bell ajid the mother has for the
past three or four years been supporting
tbe children the best way she could.
Officer McMurray said yesterday that
while Garcia had a ranch a young girl who
lived on an adjoining ranch used to fre
quently visit Garcia's house and his wife
used 16 ask him to accompany her home
at nights. Tbe result was that Garcia and !
the young girl disappeared three or four '
years ago.
The deserted wife came to the City with
her children and could not find any trace
of 3arcia till the expose came out about j
him during the election campaign at i
Suusalito. Sbe went to him and promised
for the sake of her children not to molest
him if he would agree to give her $15 or
$20 i>er month for the supuort of herself
and them. He gave her $10. but Bince
then be has entirely ignored litr.

tive Board. Presided Over by
Dr. Williamson.
The commencement exercises of the
Medical Department of the University of
California were held yesterday at the
Baldwin Theater in the presence of an
audience that taxed even the gallery. As
a showman would say, "They turned away ]
money." The regular Baldwin force of
ushers, under command of Dr. d'Ancona,
the distinguished hypnotist and physiolo
gist, officiated, and the theater orchestra
enlivened the proceedings with some of
its choicest morceaux d'opera.
Dr. R. Beverly Cole, who for over a gen
eration has presided over these exercises,
hastened home from the convention of the
American Medical Association at Atlanta,
Ga., to perform his customary annual du
ties, and the Rev. W. W. Bolton, the pic
turesque pastor of the late Frank Pix
ley church of Mary the Virgin, sanctified
the function with prayer and benediction.
The valedictory address on behalf of the
faculty, the great event of the year in col
lege and medical circles, was delivered
by Associate Professor George Franklin
Shiels, and was a pithy and forcible dis
course. Passing by the giant strides which
the profession has been making toward the
conquest of disease and those "pesky little
critters," the microbes and bacteria, he
dwelt more at length on the struggles and
triumphs of the Medical Department, the
new Affiliated Colleges of Medicine, Law,
Dentistry and Pharmacy, and the varied
benefits expected to foiiow the improved
facilities lor instruction. A feeling tribute
was paid to the founder of the college, Dr.
H. H. Toland, and when he referred to the
long services of the illustrious president of
I the faculty, Dr. Cole, who for forty-four
: years has stood at the forefront both as
! citizen and physician, the audience testi
fied its approval by long-continued ap
plause.
For the past year Dr. Cole has been
president 01 the American Medical Asso
ciation, and as such justly considered the
! head of the profession. lie is also, in all
probability, the oldest instructor in the
medical colleges of the United States and
has tilled every position in those institu
tions, from demonstrator of anatomy in
Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia,
his alma mater, on graduating, to head
of the M. D. U. C.
Dr. Shiels also laid stress on the higher
standard of education required for admis
sion and the more prolonged course of
study pursued of tne Medical Department,
and closed with some sage and practical
advice regarding their conduct as physi
cians.
It has been said by some attendants at
medical conventions that the doctors were
lacking in the graces of oratory, but had
those critics been present at these exercises
they would be forced to admit that the
speeches were delivered with "excellent
accent and discretion."
The class just graduated numbered forty
nine, the largest in the history of the in
stitution, including seven ladies, showing
that the advanced female has not over
looked medicine. The class is considered
strong, not only numerically but intellect
ually, containing a very large * preponder
ance of bright young men and women,
who have been especially distinguished
for application to their studies and good
order at lectures. Even the Wednesday ,
night "quizzes," which previously were I
not always characterized by Chesterfield- I
lan deportment, were last year such as to !
call for the warmest commendation of Dr. !
McNutt, author of that standard medical:
work, "The Kidney and Bladder." And j
Dr. Campbell Ford heartily concurs.
Take it for all in all the class of 1896 was
a great one and will long be remembered '
by the residents of Stockton and Chestnut i
streets. As Teddy Schultz, who has known
every class since the foundation of the i
college, remarked: " 'Twas a great class:
I say, a great class."

AGENT NORMAN MISSING
A Local Bicycle Dealer Who
Failed to Pay for His
Goods.
Several Attachments Placed on His
Storeâ His Second Estab
lishment.
The creditor? of William Norman, who ;
' for several yearn ] ast has conducted a bi- j
cycle agency at SS6 end 328 McAllister
street, are anxiously inquiring his where
abouts, and to secure themselves against '
possible loss have placed attachments ag- !
j gregating several hundred dollars on his j
establishment.
Norman came here from England some I
years ago and rented a small place on Me- '
Allister street, where he did a limited 1
! renting and repairing business. Gradu
ally he increased the scope of his enter
prise until he carried a heavy stock of
1 wheels, which are said to have been ob-
J tamed on credit from Eastern firms.
It is also laid that he maintained a sec
j ond establishment on Brannan street,
: where be sent the larger portion of the
i bicycles obtained on credit, disposing of
) them for whatever price he could obtain,
; and failed to make remittances to the
trusting Eastern manufacturers.
On Monday last a creditor who desired
to collect a claim against Gorman called
: at the agency and was informed that he
i had gone away on a visit to his family. He
! made inquiries and found that Norman
j had given out that his wife and children
I had gone to Los Angeles.
Thinking perhaps that the missing
\ dealer had gone there and did not intend
i to return, an attachment was sued out
j Bnd the Sheriff's lock placed on the door.
The stock that remained in the store
I waÂ« insignificant, however, compared with
| the liabilities of the agent and it is
thought that tbe cvetiitOis will get little.
The attachments that have already been
placed on Norman's place aggregate $So 4,
I of which $724 is claimed by Hougbson &
Merton, manufacturer*' agents, and $140
j by a collection agency representing other
I creditors. It is thought that other claims
i aggregating several thousand dollars will
I be filed soon.
SPRINKLING IS COSTLY
The Merchants' Association Fig
ures Declared to Be Er
roneous.
Expert George W. E'.der of the Board
of Supervisors Draws Some
Comparisons.
The protest^ filed with the Board of Su
pervisors by several hundred citizens who
oppose the plan of the Merchants' Asso
ciation to have the business streets of the
City sprinkled at the public expense has
aroused the Street Committee of the board
to investigate the matter to ascertain If it
would be of public benefit and if the
1 figures submitted by the association are
correct.
George W. Elder, the expert of the com
mittee, has been at work on the matter
for several days past, 'and lie submitted
his report at yesterday's meeting. In the
main it was as follows:
Their estimated cost of sprinkling Market
street from Second to Seventh streets by pub
lic contract is $28 50 per week. In order to
exemplify this particular item of supposed
cost of this sprinkling to be done by public
contract, I have examined into the coat of
sprinkling Van Ness avenue at the present
time, which the City is paying for at the fol
i lowing prices, to wit:
Cost of sprinkling Van Ness avenue, $49 per
week.
The ground covered daily by the water carts
at present includes the macadam blocks which
yet remain unpaved, where the watering is
done as much for the preservation of the pave
ment as for allaying the dust.
The lineal feet covered daily and the
amount of water used are as follows:
Lineal feet, 2470; water, 25 loads or 2000
cubic feet of water at 14 cents per 100 feet,
amounting to, per day, $2 80. one double
team per day, $4 20. Total for one day, $7.
Total for one we? k, $49.
This is what the City Is paying at the. present
| time for sprinkling Van Ness avenue, and it
; seem* to be a fair average paid for street
â prinking.
It seems only fair to compare this rate, pro
portionally, to Market street, although lam
reliably informed that it would require more
water for the same area on Market street,
owing to the different class of pavement.
However, I wish to make a fair comparison of
the two streets, in order that .lie committee
may compare the cost fairly and impartially.
Market street, from Second to Seventh, owing
to broad crossings and intersections, 1*4700
lineal feet. In order to cover this amount of
ground, being nearly double the amount of
ground to be covered on Van Ness avenue, it
would require two carts Instead of one, and
! there would be more wear and tear on a cart
used on Market street than on Van Ness ave
nue. Therefore, at the least calculation, the
carts would cost $5 per day each, or $10 per
day for two carls. The amount of water used
would amount to $5 60. or total cost of one
day $1500; total cost for. one week, $100 20.
Tims, your committee can readily see that
1 there must be some mistake in the estimate
submitted to your honorable committee by the
Merchants' Association as to the cost of sprink
ling Market street. These estimates I have
made from reliable information, and only
submit them for information as to what might
be the future cost, should the City assume to
sprinkle these streets by public contract.
â¢ Sprinkling Market street at the same cost as
is now paid for Van Ness avenue would be
almost lour times as much as the estimate of
the Merchants' Association, their estimate
being if 2B 50 per week; the cost would be at
the price now paid by the City for sprinkling
Van Ness avenue $109 20. which would be
$80 70 per week more than the estimate sub
mitted to you by the Merchants' Association.
< Thus, it would follow that the taxation for
street sprinkling would bo, instead of 3
cents per year on each $100 valuation, almost
12 cents per year, and on $1000 valuation,
instead of $3, it would be $ 12.
TOURING FROM
OCEAN TO OCEAN
Jaunt of General Passenger
Agent George H.
Daniels.
HE INDULGES IN A FAD.
His Movements for the Entire
Trip Governed by a Printed
Schedule.
WROTE A NOTABLE TREATISE.
Points Given to Aspirants for Success
in the Passenger Depart
ment.
George H. Daniels, who left here for
i Portland in his special car on Tuesday
' evening, is not only the "king pin" in the
; United States among general passenger
! agent?, but tne model official of that rank
in the eyes of the railroad men connected
with the passenger department. He Is the
general passenger agent of the great New-
York Central Railroad, of which the
Vanderbilts are the principal owners and
Chauncey If. Depewjtbe president.
At the present time he is engaged in
what he calls a "tour from ocean to
ocean," purely on pleasure bent, and with
him are his wife and daughter, Mrs. L. P.
Wilber, Mr. and Mrs. L. B. Hamlin, Miss
j Maud Hamlin, Miss Helen M. Tompkins
and Ralph S. Tompkins.
Mr. Daniels is a great stickler for details
' and promptness, and sets a good example
| to all his subordinates, even when away
|on a trip of the present character. 80
thoroughly has every detail of the circuit
! he is to cover been prearranged that he
1 can be communicated with from his New
i York office any day with the absolute
certainty of being reached.
He left New York with his private car
attached to train No. 15 of the New York
; Central on Friday, May 8, at 1 p. m., and
will arrive home on the 7th prox. ai 8:45
r. .m. Before departing he had a four
page cardboard folder printed and dis
tributed among those who might have oc
casion to communicate with him. This
set out tbe roads and trains by which ne
would move and the date and hour that
i he would be at not less than 100 im-
I portant points during his thirty days'
â  jaunt.
He came West via the New York Cen
| tral. Michigan Central, Chicago and North
! western, Union Pacific, Denver and Rio
i Grande, Rio Grande Western and Central
: Pacific. From San Francisco he departed
; on the Southern Pacific line lor Portland.
1 Thence he will make the trip up the Co
| lunibia by boat to The Dalles, and return
i via the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company's line, rie will proceed to the
Sound via the Northern Pacific and then
1 East via the latter road, the Chicago, Mil
waukee add St. Paul, Michigan Central
and New York Central, and will cover in
I all something over 10,000 miles.
Recently Mr. Daniels contributed an
I article to' the Railway Age and North
| western Railroader, which attracted wide
attention from the clientage of that jour
! nal, tbe article treating of "The Success
j ful Passenger Man." In this the author
; says:
"There are five requisitas to the success
of %ny man who wishes to be an efficient
representative of the passenger department
! of a great railroad.
"Knowledge of the line, its facilities and
its connections.
"Industry.
"Affability and courtesy.
"Promptness.
"Honesty."
Under the head of "Industry" Mr. Dan
iels has this aphorism :
"An indolent person would never suc
ceed as a passenuer man ; passengers move,
and he who would be successful in this
calling must move first."
In writing of "Affability and Courtesy"
â¢ he incidentally cracks a nut for General
I Hubburd, who, when here, expressed a de-
I sire for knowledge as to why the Southern
I Pacific was so unpopular with the public.
On this point Mr. Daniels says, though
evidently without malice prepense toward
ColliÃ P. Huntington, "tbe opinion of the
public regarding transportation lines is
I generally formed according to the dealings
I with the representatives of such lines."
In concluding his article a somewhat
: rude shock is given to the conceptions of
the average passenger agent. He writes:
â  "It pays to be honest in connection with
i railroad wore, as in any other, and an
, agent who is conscientious and honest in
his statements, energetic, polite and affa
ble, and who thoroughly understands bis
; duties, will make an ideal representative."
FUNDS FOR THAT FIESTA
Colonel Andrews' Scheme for
Raising $125,000 Without
Begging.
Seven Citizens Appointed to Choose
tbe Carnival Executive
Committee.
A happy and feasible scheme for raising
ample funds for the San Francisco Carni
val was suggested last night by Colonel
! Andrews at the meeting of the general
! committee, held in the Baldwin Hotel.
The idea is this: Have 125.000 souvenir
! carnival medals struck off and sold in ad
vance at a dollar each, the medal in itself
entitling the wearer 10 a seat during the
i entire six days of the carnival.
Colonel Andrews says suitable medals
' could be made at a rate of 5 cents each,
: and in such a way that they could not be
counterfeited.
The forty-five representative citizens
â  present received his suggestion with en
| thusiastic approval and declared it to be
! the best idea tney had yet heard. It would
i avoid subscription lists and systematic
i begging for funds.
As tribunes are to be erected along
many of the principal streets where the
features of the carnival will be presented
seats will certainly be in demand, and it is
I thought that little difficulty will be found
in disposing of the souvenir medals.
I Banks, mercantile houses and other busi
| ness concerns may, it is believed, be relied
1 upon to buy 100 medals each. As the
i committee has been counting on devoting
i $100,000 10 the carnival this new scheme
j seems to provide for funds enough to erect
' plenty of seats and still have over the re
; quired amount.
The only other business before the meet
ing was the apoointnieat of a committee
! of seven whose duty it shall be to submit
at the regular meeting next Tuesday the
names of twenty-five" men best calculated
! to represent all interests and be the ex
[ ecutive committee of the carnival, pracli
| cally the directors of all the preparations
J for the great event. The temporary chair

WAS BLANTHER
THE STRANGLER?
Chief Crowley Concurs in
the Opinion That He Was
Not an Amateur.
WHY HE LEFT HIS VALU-
ABLE MEDALS.
An Experience in Blood May
Have Caused Him to Feel
Secure.
WAS A DESPISED DESERTER
FROM HIS FLAG.
Had Been Arrested in Siam, but Ex
tradition Proceedings Failed and
He Disappeared.
Chief Crowley agreed in so many words
with the theory advanced yesterday by
The Call that Joseph Blanther is an ac
complished murderer; that the bloody
butchery of old Mrs. Langfeldt was not
the first work of the kind by the same
hand. It was too coolly done, too well
Planned, and the murderer's behavior
afterward was that of a man who did not
fear arrest.
In other words Chief Crowley clearly in- j
dicates that he believes Blanther is the
author of the general murders attributed :
vaguely to the mysterious "strangler."
It wouid be the part of a man who had
committed many such murders and es
caped detection to act just as he did. No
one bad actually seen him go into ,
the Kleineberg houÃe. How could
he Know that Mrs. Langfeldt had
told the Kleinebergs itiat he was expected
there that evening. Had she not done so,
what was there to associate his name with
the crime? Old Mrs. Langfeldt had many
callers, and he had always carried himself
as a gentleman of wealth. What was there
to direct suspicion roward him then? His I
plans were perfect in this view of the
case. He told his friend Dodge that he
was going to San Jose with Mrs. Marks â a ;
lady whom Dodge did not know. It is !
quite likely that he went to San Jose or to :
some other point where news of the dis
covery of the crime could reach him.
Suppose the newspapers had simply
heralded the perpetration of another mur
der by an unknown â another shocking
mardpr mystery.
Would it not, then, have been altogether
possible that the versatile nobleman would
have kept his engagement with the inno
cent Dodge at the Cafe Royal on Monday
night and taken him to some French res
taurant where they could discuss and phi- ;
losophize upon the new murder mystery?
Blanther said: # 'I will meet you on Sun
day, perhaps, but not later than Monday
evening; but if anything should happen ]
to me I will depend upon you, as my i
friend, to look after my tin box, with the ;
medals that I prize more dearly than life."
Then he disappeared. It so happened
that hi? name was instantly brought for
ward as the suspect in this case and was j
in everybody's mouth next morning. It is
not strange, then, that he did not return.
The police themselves say that his ;
flight was the strongest circumstance \
against him. For forty-eight hours after- j
ward, and until George Dodge had told
his story of the diamond transaction,
this view of the case â this security that I
the man felt â fully explains what has |
been the oddest bit of mystery in it. I
That is, the circumstance of Blanther's '
leaving those medals that he valued so j
highly behind him.
To be sure it may be said that it would
have been unsafe for him to carry them
with him, as they would certainly iden
tify him. But it does not at all follow
that in taking them with him he would
have had to carry them on his person.
Had he really contemplated flight he
could have disposed of them in
more than a hundred different ways
that would have suggested themselves to
him. For instance, while waiting for the
coming of Dodge that morning, how
easy it would have been to mail
those medals to himself under
any name at the objective point
in his flight. But he left them behind, to- i
gether with his family papers and took !
the chance â promising to return. A man â¢
who had committed murder with impun
ity would have acted just so, would have
grown careless of the police.
It will be remembered that Blanther
made a mysterious disappearance about
ten weeks ago, about the time that Bertha
Faridis was strangled by an unknown in
St. Mary's street. He was gone about two
or three weeks and returned to this City
about six weeks ago.
His friends knew nothing of his inten
tion to leave nor of his whereabouts until
Dodge accidentally met him on the street
and Blanther explained that he had been
in Portland.
Again this man had no visible means of
support at any time. He was a mystery.
When Dodge and the others who have
been mentioned as acquaintances first met
him he had plenty of money and boasted
that he had earned it by bis pen in writ
ing tor Harper's and the Century, i
receiving such fabulous sums as $700 and
$*00 a montn for his work, while the
fact is h : s writing is of a character not
marketable anywhere.
He did not work, hut his finances fluc
tuated. One day be was starving and the
next buying 1* rench dinners.
This outlines the opinion of Chief Crow-
Ley. In other words be believes Blanther
iÂ« the strangle? or tho author of more than
one of the mysterious murders that have
shocked the community within the past
few months.
"I am convinced that Bianlher in a man
with a mania for murder.'' said tbe Chief
last night. "Yon can make what you
please of that conclusion. I do not "be
lieve that that is the first crime ot the
kind he has committed."
Blanther answers perfectly the descrip- :
tion ot the sirangler as given by Irene '
Pliiilips. t!ie Sutter-street woman who was
attacked one night about a month ago,
ar.d also by Laura Petit, another woman
residing on Eliis street assaulted within |
the following few days.
In line with this theory also comes the !
news from Austria that Blanther so far I
from being a n >lÂ»leman in high esteem !
with liis Government, is even with his j
medals a deserter from the army. He was |
sentenced in contumaciain on the charge j
of outlawry and a year later was arrested j
in Siaru, but t. c extradition procee lings |
taken against him faiJod to obtain his sur- â¢
ren'if r to the Austria:' authorities, who |
have since been ignorant of his where- j
a bouts.
At police headquarters yesterday they I
reported an absolute dearth of views con- j
ceming the murderer of Mrs. Langfeldt, j
_ r
Officers were still busily engaged in send- I
ing out circulars descriptive of Blanther, !
and notice of suspects seen in various |
parts of the State keeps coming in, but
there was nothing definite.
Captain Lees said: "I believe in follow
ing every trail, or indication of a trail,
that is reported, but I have nothing so far
that offers much encouragement looking
to the capture of Blanther."
The descriptions as being sent out now
are being changed in some slight degree
from that in the original circular. For
! instance, his eyes are described as "gray"
i instead of "browning gray" ; his teeth are
set down as simply "white," not "white
and even," and his feet are not now said
to be especially small. His teeth, nearly
all those who know him agree, did not
present an even line, but were worn and
broken, showing slight indentations.
t Captain Lees has secured several copies i
of more recent photographs of the man,
which he will also have engraved and
copies sent to police authorities through
out the country. He says he is convinced
that Blanther is not the man of singular
appearance that he has been represented.
"I imagine that he ii a very ordinary
| looking individual, distinguished, if at
all, by something of a military bearing.
But clothes can greatly change a man's
appearance. A tailor with a little padding
can give a man a pair of square shoulders
that completely change his appearance."
Captain Lees declines to express an '
opinion as to the whereabouts of Blan
ther â whether it be near or far; whether
he is in hiding in this City, Oakland or
vicinity, or whether he has made his way
out of the State. "It would be foolish for
me to say what, in my opinion, has be
come of him, as it would be to tell just
what menas and measures I am tak
ing to apprehend him. It is sufficient for
me to state that I am exerting every
means in my power to overtake him."
It may be said, however, that the search
is &till centered about San Jose, where, it
is thought, he may be concealed by some
of the female friends he is known to have
had in that city.
George Dodge, the friend of Blanther .
who occupies such a peculiar place in the
story of the crime, has, since he made pub
lic his full statement, fallen out of public '
view to avoid the persistent interviewer.
Mrs. Marks, the other of the principal
figures in the story, keeps to her rooms,
being still quite ill from the effects of the
excitement and the narrow escape which
she is convinced that she herself made.
She repeats the story of the inquiries
made by Blanther concerning her own
diamonds, but denies that they excited
any suspicion with her at the time. She
says that Blanther never saw her dia
monds but once or twice, as she was not
accustomed to displaying them. Fur
thermore, she always believed that
the young Austrian was well off
as he always represented himself to be. i
What caused her to wish to rid herself of
his attentions was the morbid turn of ,
mind he exhibited; his constant talk of
death and threats of suicide. She began ;
to fear him on this account, because he '
talked so liehtly of death. She expressed
to her friends the fear that he would do i
something desperate. They or one of
them â advised her not to discard him too
abruptly, as it might cause him to do
what he threatened. i
Upon the first opportunity afterward, ;
acting upon this advice, she advised him
not to call so often as he had been doing.
Drawing himself up in a burst of indigna
tion he declared he would not call at all. j :
And he did not again.
T -at was on the Ist of May, before he |
had ever spoken to Dodge about thÂ« dia- |
monds that he desired to have him pawn j
for Mrs. Marks. He had not told him j i
! about his break with â¢ that lady.
It was contrary to his nature to
! confess to any " such rebuff. Neither
had he ever said anything about
the existence of Mrs. Lanefeldt while yet he
was calling upon her daily and nightly. |
It would seem to be clear from this that '
the idea at least of this particular !
diamond transaction came to Blanther
after he had ceased calling on Mrs. Marks,
and as a result of his acquaintance with
. Mrs. Lanpfeldt and the opportunity that
I the old woman offered him.
BLANTHER A DESERTER.
Guilty of Treason by Skulking
From the Army of His
Country.
LONDON", Eko., May 21.â A dispatch to
a news agency from Vienna says:
Joseph Blanther, the suspected mur
derer of Mrs. Lanefeldt of San Francisco,
served first in the Thirty-second Austrian
Infantry, and later deserted from the
Eighty-fifth Hungarian Infantry while at
Vienna in 1885.
He was sentenced in contumacinm on
the charge of outlawry, and a year later
was arrested in Siam, but extradition pro
ceedings failed to obtain his surrender,
and the Austrian authorities have since
been ignorant of his whereabouts.
Blanther claimed, according to San
Francisco dispatches, to have been a lieu
tenant in the Austrian army and to have
received at least four crosses and decora
tions of knightly orders. Documents
which seem to bear out his statements
were found among his effects.
The most important of these was a
highly decorated imperial order of Decem
ber 21. 1878. conferring knighthood upon
Joseph Blanther, a first lieutenant in the
Sixty-fifth Austrian Infantry. But the
Austrian War Office states that blanther
only served in the Thirty-second Austrian
Infantry and Eighty-fifth Hungarian In
fant TV.
Blanther appears to have arrived in the
United States about ten years ago and to
have lived in New York* Chicago and in
various places in Florida before going to
San Frf ncisco in February last.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1896.
DIRECTORS OF A
GREAT CAMPAIGN
The Republican Executive
Committee Assembles
for the First Time.
ADJOURNED TILL TO-BAY
An Effort to Harmoniously Se
lect a Chairman Delays
Organization.
PREBTON SUDDENLY OPPOSED.
Nearly All the Mrmbers Are Here to
Take a Hand in the Election
of Officers.
The new executive committee of the
Republican State Central Committee got
together for its initial meeting in tbe
rooms of the State Central Committee at
419 California street yesterday afternoon.
The committee transacted no business
of importance during the brief session
held and adjourned until 10 o'clock this
morning when permanent organization
will undoubtedly be effected by the elec
tion of a chairman, a secretary and an
assistant secretary.
This is prooably the only easiness of
importance that will be taken up by the
camnitHb to-day or before tbe meeting of
the Nationtl Convention, but a great in
terest is beiafc tacen in the disposition of
offices by all Urn members of the commit
tee.
The chairmanship is naturally the thing
of chief importance. E. F. Preston, who
who has long been prominent in State
affairs of the party, had been informally
agreed upon for tie chairmanship of the
committee by a majority of the members,
but yesterday a suddenly developed oppo
sition to Mr. Preston in favor of Frank
McLaughlin showed itself.
The opposition was considerable, but of
uncertain strength, and it was shown
during the discussion that attended the
gathering of the members. In this situa
tion a large number of the coranuttee
men agreed that a harmonious under
standing should be reached, if possible,
and tnat an adjournment for a few hours
would be the wisest step to take.
It was with this understanding that the
meeting was called to order by James W.
Rea at the momentary suggestion of sev
eral members as ihe committeemen seated
tnemselves.
Nineteen of the twenty-one members
were present and one of the absentees was
represented by a proxy. Mo9t of the
members from Southern California and
from other parts of the State arrived by
forenoon trains, and the large attendance
was an evidence of the energetic interest
in the important work of the committee
which it had been promised the carefully
selected new committee would show.
Those present were: John D. Spreckels,
Leon Sloss, W. W. Shannon, Cornelius
O'Connor, M. R. Higgins, A. Ruef, Harry
N. Gray, W. A. Nicholson, Paris Kilburn,
San Francisco: E. F. Preston, San Mateo;
Frank McLanghlin, Oroville; Allen B.
Lemmon, Santa Rosa; James W. Rea, San
Jose; M. H. Weight. Pasadena; Irving B.
Dudley. San Diego; Frank P. Flint, H. Z.
Osborne and \V. F. Parker, Los Angeles;
W. F. Georee, Sacramento.
The absentees were E. K. Taylor of Ala
meda and Frank A. Miller of Pasadena.
F. P. Flint of Los Angeles held the proxy
of the latter.
On motion of John D. Spreckels Mr. Rea
was made temporary chairman, and on
motion of A. Ruef Jacob Steppacher was
called to act as temporary secretary.
A motion by Mr. Spreckels thatthecom
mittee go into executive session was op
posed by Nicholson, but it was quickly
supported by Messrs. O'Connor, Lemmon
and others and it was carried. The ses
sion lasted but a few minutes and resulted
in an adjournment until 10 a. m. to-day.
Hervey Lindley of Los Angeles was
among the number who were there as in
terested spectators, and who helped make
a busy scene of gossip in the corridor and
j in the committee-room.
The members of the new executive com
mittee from Los Angeles, San Diego, Sac
ramento and other places speak highly of
Republican prospects in their respective
localities.
H. Z. Csborne of the Los Angeles Ex
press, w-.o is a member of the executive
committee and a close observer of r>olitica I
affairs, predicts that the Republican vote
and the Republican majority in Southern
California next November will be the
largest ever cast in that region of
the State. "Should McKinley get the
nomination, as I believe he will," said Mr.
Osborne, "the Republican majority will
be overwhelming. There are no dissen
sions to speak of in the party, and the
prospects of a sweeping majority for the
nominee of the St. Louis convention of
Republicans are remarkably bright Every
sign indicates a great triumph of the party
in the Presidential election. 1 '
W. F. Parker, another member of the
executive committee, is confident that the
Republican majority south of the Te
hachapi will be exceptionally large. "Re
publicans are united and enthusiastic,"
said Mr. Parker. "They are not distracted
and divided by factional controversy. If
any disputes exist they are purely local
and will have no bearing or effect on the
National ticket. Los Angeles as a city is
Republican and the party vote this year
W1 p b ? * he 'argest ever polled."
raris Kilburn of the executive commit
tee has occasion to visit all parts of the
Mate and is particularly well informed
regarding the sentiment in tbe Salinas
i' e Â£" ** c asrrees with Messrs. Osborne
and Parker that Republican prospects of
victory were never brighter. The party is
united, earnest and confident.

The Young Men's Republican
League Begins an Active
Career.
The Young Men's Republican League
elected officers for the ensuing year last
evening in Justice Kerrigan's courtroom
and otherwise prepared to cut a leading
figure in the Republicun campaign.
The body was organized in September
last as the Young Men's Republican Club,
but was reorganized under its present
name recently. The league is made up of
young Republican business men who are
not practical politicians, but who sre in
terested in the success of the Republican
party and are ready to actively and en
thusiastically enter into the work of the
campaign. The purposes of tbe club are
declared to be the advocacy of the princi
ples of the Republican party, the encour
agement of attendance at primaries ami
the protection of the purity of Republican
politics.
The club is ambitious to take a position
at the very front of local Republican clubs.
It now ha" a membership of 200, which
will be greatly increased. This week a
drill corps wilfbe orsanized, and it is pro
posed to finely uniform the entire club.
Permanent and attractive headquarters
will soon be established down town. Meet
ings are held every Thursday evening.
The following officers were elected last
evening: President. Frank K. Spencer,
tirst vice-president, George E. Moyniban;
second Vice-president, E. L. Bell; secre
tary, F. R. Casey; treasurer, John Louni

PROSPECTING FOR DIAMONDS.
A Famous Gem Acquired by a South
African Farmer.
Early in the year 1867 a traveler named
O'Reilly, bound southward from the
Orange River, rested himself a while at a
farm in the Hope Town district. His host,
one Nickerk, presently brought to his
notice some nice looking stones that had
been obtained from the river; and while
examining this collection of pebbles,
O'Reilly pounced upon the "first dia
mond.'' This gem he at once took to Dr.
Atherstone of Grahamstown, who pro
nounced it to be worth Â£/MX>, and this sum
it very soon realized. Naturally, the lucky
wayfarer then hastened back to the spot
where such good fortune had befallen him,
but hi? subsequent as>idu<>us searches were
unavailing. Some two years now elapsed
without anything momentous transpiring.
However, in 1860, Farmer Niekerk ac
quired from a native, for about Â£400
worth of stock, a lar>:e diamond which
was readily sold to a firm in Hope Town
for Â£10,000. This famous eem was later
christened, "The Star of South Africa" ,
it weighed eighty-three karats, was esti
mated to be worth Â£_'5,000 and found a
final reÂ«ting-p!aco among the Countess
of Dudley's magnificent jewels.
One of the most peculiar incidents in
connection with the diamond fields is
that, although these early discoveries
were "made in the neighborhood of Hope
Town, no mine has ever been found
there.
The very natural result of the sensa
tional "find" just mentioned was a frantic
rush of diggers to the district from all
parts. Careful prospecting demonstrated
later on that diamonds also existed on the
banks of the Vaai River. Consequently
barely a year alter the finding of "The
Star of South Africa^ no fewer than ten
thousand persons had arrived on the
s-Cfne in spite of the dreary, not to say ap
palling, prospects that confronted them.
Good food and pure waters were unknown
at that time, while shelter from the
scorching -sun was mainly afforded by
primitive canvas structures. Many min
ers thus succumbed to pestilence, disease
and sunstroke before they eveii reached
the threshold of their El Dorado. At this
time, however, crime was almost unknown,
partly because the journey from Port
Elizabeth was accomplished in rough bul
lock wagons over frightful roads and occu
pied about three weeks, at a cost of fully
Â£50, an amount beyond the means of the
lowest class of rogues. Furthermore, the
cost of living was simply prodigious. â

THE LONGEST TUNNEL.
A Railroad System Under Piken Teak
tml Neighboring Mountain*.
"Colorado is goinc to have the longest
tunnel in the world," said Richard Jones
in conversation with a St. Louis Globe-
Democrat man a few days ago. "Within
a few years the Mont Cenis, Bt. Gothard
and Simplon tunnels under the Alps will
not compare with the one to be con
structed.
"A company has undertaken to do
forty-eight miles of tunneling under Pikes
Peak and the territory near by. It will
begin at Sunderland Creek, near Colorado
City, and run in a southwesterly direction
to a creek some distance beyond Inde
pendence and Victor. It is to be built for
a doabie-track railway and have the regu
lation dimension of railway tnnnnis. 14 feet
wide and 18 high. A branch line will leave
jhe main tunnel at a point under Inde
pendence and run to (-ripple Creek,
placing that mining center within sixteen
miles of Colorado City. The distance be
tween the two is by rail at present fifty
four m'lop.
"The two months of the main tunnel are
to have the same altitude, 6800 feet, and
the grade of the tunne! will be one foot to
the hundred, enough to make it drain
well. This will give the divide an alti
tude of about 7400 feet. The summit of
Pikes Peak is 14,000 feet above the sea and
Cripple Creek nearly 10,000. The plan in
cludes also laterals or cross tunnels at sev
eral different points. One is to be at or
under Crystal Park and another under
â¢'amerons Cove. The longest one will cut
the main line not far from Bald Mountain
and run under that peak in one direction
and under the summit of Pikes Peak in
ihe other. This cross tunnel will be over
tifteen miles long. Then another tunnel
is to connect this crossarm with the main
line, joining the latter nearer the south
ami the branch on the west side of Pikes
Peak. It will run under the mining camp
of Gillett and not far from Grassy.
"The amount needed for the tunnel
work is $20,000,000. A contract now in es
crow in Colorado City requires that tbe
work shall be commenced within ninety
â lays. Tlie intention is to have forty -eight
miles tunneled and the main line in oper
ation before March 1. 1906. "

CONFERENCE PROMISED.
The Meeting Will Take Place
in the Emporium This
Afternoon.
THE OTHER TRADES UNION?.
No Fight Will Be Made by the
Brewery Workmen Against the
Enterprise Brtwery.
An interesting meeting of the Building
Trades Council was held last evening at
which the principal business discussed
was the boycott on the Parrott building
and the Emporium.
The nrsi taken up was the following let
ter from the Emporium people:
Executive Committee of the Building Trades
Â£Â£?.. " / - GE , NTLE - MM 5 N ' : Through the datlv
Dress it is learned that, without previous
notice, k boycott has been placed by you
on the Emporium business enterprise because
the owners of the building have given their
contract to a party who employs non-union
men Â«ud who is otherwise objectionable to
your organization. Evidently you are not
aware Â»hat the business firms in question have
ho interest in the building or its fixtures, and
had no voice nor had they any right to ask to
be consulted concerning this matter
You could fully as consistently place a boy
cott on the Supreme Court of California, which
will occupy the upper floor of this building, as
upon the merchants who will sell goods in its
. oner floors.
We assume that you have no desire to act in
dividually in a matter of such importance,
and we hereby respectfully invite your board
to meet the managers of the Emporium Busi
ness Enterprise at the Emporium building to
confer upon this matter at its meeting at 3
o clock on Friday afternoon, May 22. or to ad
vise us if that time is not convenient.
Â» c also respectfully state that should you
decline to investigate the circumstances in
connection with this question or decide to
mainiaiu the boycott wit "out such investiga
tion upon an enterprise which is expected and
is intended to be an attraction to the City and
a benefit to the purchasing public, that the
responsibility of such unjust action will rest
entirely with your organization.
Very respectfully,
_, _ , Board of Managers.
W. E. Josi.ys, Secretary.
It was decided by the council to bear
anything the managers of the Emporium
have to say upon the subject. The two
business agents, R. T. Mclvor and C. F.
Schadt, with William O'Brien, Dick
Behrens and F. Schutz, were appointed as
a committee to keep the appointment re
quested by the Emporium people. The
committee was givon to understand that
the entire building must be unionized, for
by a resolution it was decided that the
boycott will not be removed unless all
non-union men are thrown ont of the j
building. In addition the secretary was
instructed to communicate with the San i
Francisco Trades Council, the San Fran- !
cisco Trades and Labor Alliance and all
traces unions toindorse the boycott on
the Emporium and Parrott building.
A special meeting of the council will be
held this evening to hear the report of the
committee as to the results of the confer
ence with the Emporium people.
The business agents were instructed to
call out tue men at the new recreation
grounds at Sixteenth and Folsom streets
this morning. Blake, O'Neil & Co. prom- j
ised to pay their carpenters the full rate
of wages, $3 a day, but it was learned that
the men are still underpaid.
John Graham and T. <). Arthur of Car
penters' Union 483 and J. Connolly of the
Plasterers' Tnion were seated as delegates.
AN EIGHT-HOUR JOB.
Healy & Tibbets Will Construct
the Pacific Wharf Shed on
Union Time.
Healy & Tibbets, the contractors, have
at last agreed to work their men only eight
hours in the construction of tbe State's
big shed on the Pacific-street wharf. For
a long timo the carpenters have been
watching this job, as it was announced
that the contractors proposed to keep their
men at work nine hours.
On Tuesday the work began, and as
feared, nine hours was the order. For
several days Business Agent Mclvor has
been interviewing the contractors and en
deavoring to induce them to reduce the
time to eight hours. His efforts were
fruitful, for yesterday he was assured that
hereafter the job will be run on eight

THE BREWERY FIGHT.
A Syndicate Brewery Is Probably
Selected for the Boy
cott.
Within a week the Brewery Workmen's
Union will probably announce the brew
ery selected to be boycotted. This will be
the first movement in the fight against the
Brewers' Protective Association for a rec
ognition of the union.
It was feared by a number of brewers in
the association that the Enterprise Brew
ery would be selected as the victim by the
union. In fact, the latter had cast its eye
upon this establishment, but several mat
ters induced a change in the plan.
One of the prominent union men said
last evening that a brewery has been
selected, but it is not the Enterprise. Tbe
reason the man gave is that this brewery
is filled with union workmen from the
lowest to the highest position, and
that the proprietors have frequently
manifested their friendship for the
union, even in the debates of the associa
tion. It is true that it has a large trades
union patronage, and there is no doubt,
the union believes, that this patronage
could be withdrawn in the event of a
boycott, yet the idea prevailed that it
would not be fair to strife a friendly
brewery by a boycott when there are seve
ral breweries in the City whose proprietors
are enemies of the union.
It has been rumored, also, that the
Broadway brewery was slated for the boy
cott, but the union men say that this
brewery bears the same friendly relation
to the union as the Enterprise and the
test will not be made upon it.
From the present appearance it looks as
though the brewery that has been selected
is one of the syndicate. A blow at one of
these would have a double effect. It is
believed that a boj'cott placed upon a brew
ery outside of the syndicate would cause
the latter to go to the front with the full
support of its wealth. But if a blow is
struck at a syndicate brewery the full sup
port of the outside breweries is a matter of
question with the union.
TRADES ALLIANCE.
i Increased Activity In Organizing
tha New Political
Party.
The Trades and Labor Alliance held its
regular weekly meeting last evening at
1159 Mission street.
William Edlin, the delegate from tbe
Jewi!-h branch of the Socialist Labor party,
was seated. As there were several vacan
cies in the executive committee, the fol
lowing were elected to fill the same:
11. Wolfe, W. Edhn, J. Fisher, A.
Felanc, J. Jorgensen and H. J. Gamma.
Instructions were given to the organiz
ing committee to endeavor to induce the
new Paper-hangers' Union to join the al
liance.
William Edlin was selected as press re
porter, to give such news to the daily press
as the alliance desires to have published.
J. Flanagan of Butte City, Mont., de
livered a short address, in which he im
pressed upon the alliance the importance
of the workingmen entering politics.
T. M. I. Open Meetings.
Borromean Council No. 129, Young Men's
Institute, Is arranging for a series of open
meetings to be he'd at the Mission. Music and
recitation will be included in each evening's
programme, but the special features will be
addresses on subject? of interest.
The first of these affairs will be held at Mis
sion Opera Hall nvxt Tuesday evening, on
which occasion Rev. P. E. Mulligan and FranK
McG'.ynn will speak. No admission will be
charged and an invitation Is extended tho
public to attend.
A Change of Kame.
La fociete Francaise d'Etiargnes et de Pre
voyance Mutueile, finding its name extremely
cumbersome and unwieldy and the cause of
much inconvenience, has petitioned the Su
perior Court to be allowed to change it to "The
French Pavings Bant." It is so known in busi
ness circles alresdy, the application states, and
the corporation prefers the name because it
conveys the purpose of the corporation to
those without a knowledge of the French
tongue as well as to the sons and daughters of
France. *â¢ .
Our Duty to Cuba.
This is a world of comparative progress,
and freedom from Spain would be to Cuba
a long step in advance on the high road of
advancing civilization, says Senatoi Lodge
in the May Forum. The interests of hu
manity are the controlling reasons which
demand tho beneficent interposition of
the United States to bring to an end this
savage war and give to the island peace
and independence. No great nation can
escape its responsibilities. We freely
charge England with responsibility for
the hideous atrocities in Armenia. But it
is the merest cant to do this if we shirk
our own duty.
We have a' responsibility with regard to
Cuba. We cannot evade it, and if we seek
to do so, sooner or later we shall pay the
penalty. But the American pe<?rle, whose
sympathies are strongly with the Cubans
fi/hting for their liberties, will no longer
suffer this indifference toward them to
continue. If one administration declines
to meet our national responsibilities as
they should be met, there will be put in
power another administration which will
neither neglect -nor shun its plain duty to
the United States and to the canse of free
dom and humanity.

SOME PATHETIC SCENES
Tribute of a Lowly Newsboy
Who Was Overcome by
His Grief.
HIS POPPIES AND HIS SOBS.
A Wide Circle of Friends View the
Remainsâ "Petey" at Rest Beside
His Mother.
All day Wednesday ana all day Thurs
day there was a steady stream of visitors
to the establishment of Gray & Son, under-
takers. Persons of all ages and of various
creeds, countries and conditions called to
take a last regretful look at the deceased
journalist Henry D. Bigelow.
It was an uncommonly sorrowful scene
and proved conclusively how dear a spot
the dead Bohemian, connoisseur and epi
cure had filled in the hearts of his numer
ous friends and associates.
The obsequies, held yesterday afternoon,
were quiet and modest, with comparatively
little conventionality. Pathos, not pomp,
was a distinctive feature of the funeral,
the solemnity of which was not disturbed
by any undue ostentation. The remains
were lying in a handsome rosewood casket
covered and surrounded with roses, violets,
calla lilies, etc. A beautiful wreath of white
roses and carnations was the tribute of the
San Francisco Press Club, and from rela
tives and friends came a choice lot of cut
flowers of many hues and varieties.
The parlors were filled with ladies and gen
tlemen, among whom were William Keith,
the artist. Fred Marriott, T. J. Flynn. Dr.
Lustig, W. E. Dargie, Arthur McEwen, J.
N. H. Irwin, W. F. Bogart, A. E. Gould,
Roger Mayer, Emi!e\Cucuel, A. D. Smith,
Philip liastings, Robert Duncan Milne,
Lee McGown Jr. and many other men
well known in social and professional life.
The widow, heavily veiled, was present
with her two young sons, George and Fred,
Mrs. Bayliss, her mother, and Miss Maud
Bayliss of Oakland. The father and two
sisters of "Petey" Bigelow reside at Samp
sons Flat and could not be notified in
time to arrive in the City. His mother is
dead.
The Rev. Joseph Worcester, pastor of
the Swedenborgian church, read the burial
service and repeated the Lord's Prayer.
Then the casket was borne to the waiting
hearse, and followed by mourners and
friends was driven to Laurel Hill Ceme
tery, where the body of "Petey" Bigelow
was privately and sorrowfully laid to rest
in the grave beside his mother.
It was the intention of the Press Club to
be represented by pall-bearers and to con
tribute some music, but in consequence of
an oversight the idea had to be abandoned.
A pathetic incident that happened yester
day morning illustrates the popularity of
the deceased. A waif from the streets, a
little newsboy who had known "Petey"
and benefited by his generosity, came
into the parlors, looked long at the face of
the dead man, laid a bunch of esch
scholtzia reverently upon the casket, and,
sobbing as if his heart would break, walked
slowly out of the door.
FOR CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS.
Governor Budd Asked to Use Bis In
fluence Wherever Possible.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation is leaving no stone unturned to
effect the object for which it was organ
ized, the introduction and use of Califor
nia products in preference to goods and
products from the East and abroad. In
order to reach the chief executive of the
State upon this matter a letter was ad
dressed to him yesterday by the secretary,
in which it is asked:
Therefore on behalf of this association I
most respectfully beg that you will request
each.of the public institutions of the State of
Calirornia to submit their schedules to us that
we may suggest necessary changes (such
changes of course to be approved by the parties
in authority), and after the necessary changes
are made that they have new schedules printed
in accordance therewith.MUSIC DROVE THE CLOUDS AWAY.

A NEW CONSTITUTION.
Important Amendments Made by
the Grand Council, Young
Men's Institute.
BANQUETIKG THE DELEGATES.
Lcyal Toasts Were Eloquently Re
sponded To, anl Wit and Song
Whilei Away the Hours.
HAYWARDS, Cal., May 21.â The Y.
M. I. Grand Council was at work bright
and early at 9 o'clock this morning mak
ing new regulations for subordinate lodges
and amending the constitution so as to
have it conform to that of the Supreme
Council.
It is worthy of remart that up to this
year there were only two jurisdictions of
the Y. M. I, â the Atlantic and the Pacific.
Now there are seven jurisdictions, the
present Grand Council representing the
Pacific and the seven being represented by
a Supreme Council.
The order is but an infant in years yet
it has grown to giant proportions. That it
is founded on a basis of enduring pros
per ty Us history shows. Its greatest in
crease h^s been noted wherever its ene
mies have been the boldest and the most
numerous. It seems to thrive best when
persecuted the most.
The session did not close until nearly 7
o'clock in the evening, and the annual
election of grand officers was crowded over
into to-morrow, it being made the special
order for 10:30 a. m.
The banquet began at half-past 9 o'clock
this evening, and was one of the most
elaborate affairs of the kind ever wit
nessed in Huy wards. It refreshed the
beys exceedingly alter their long siege of
business, and they will rise in the morn
ing invigorated for their great battle of
to-morrow, the annual election.
One of the most enjoyable features of
the session was the excellent open air con
cert this afternoon. It awoke old Hay
wards as she had never been awakened
before, and the liberal and enthusiastic
applause which the band received demon
strated beyond a doubt that the people in
the early fruit belt are not only lovers oi
music but excellent judges of it as well.
At 9 o'ciocK to-morrow morning the
Grand Council will resume its delibera
tions. At half-past 10 the annual election
will be begun. At 2 o'clock, instead of
the open-air concert by the Oakland Con
cert band, there will be a dauce free for
all. In the evening Rev. P. C. Yorke will
deliver a lecture, the admission to which
will be 50 cents.
The only regrettable thing to-day was
the rain. It fell ail the morning in a mo- j
notonous drizzle, dripping dejectedly
from ihe awnings and the eaves and weep
ing disconsolately on the winaow panes.
It Kept many people residing in the neigh
borijood from visiting the town until in !
the afternoon the deep peaceful blue of a j
California sky drew aside the curtains of j
the clouds and let in the glorious sun- j
shins.
Now that the session is drawing to a
close it is fitting that the gentlemen who
have made all the arrangements should ,
be given the proper credit for their care
ful and conscientious work. They omitted
no detail, they spared no expense to make
the welcome of Haywards to the Y. K. I.
as freehearted as the most exacting
guests could require. The committee of
arrangements was composed of the fol
lowing named gentlemen:
F. B. Hooson (chairman), F. S. Terry
(secretary). J. E. Crooks (treasurer), Dr.
A. J. Powell, J. E. Geary, Ed Haas, John

very hard work during the season of
closed doors.
Owing to the creation of a Supreme
Council and the adoption by it of a consti
tution to govern the order all over the
country, it was necessary to change the
constitution of the Grand Council in order
to be in harmony with it. This involved
considerable preparation and study on the
part of the. "^council.
This being the first Grand Council held
by the Pacific jurisdiction of the Y. If. I.
since the organization of the Supreme
Council, it was necessary to name it so
that it might De '.dentitied as such in the
records of the order. Many members were
in favor of starting it with the number 1
and an appropriate name by which to des
ignate it from the hrst Grand Council.
After considerable discussion on the point
it was decided to adhere to the original
numbering and designate it as the
Twelfth Grand Council of the Tacitic Ju-

HAYWARDS, Cal., May 21.â The Cas

torium had been elaborately decorated.
Paper lanterns of various colors and de
signs hung from festoons of cypress and
paper flowers ot gay hues and shed a soft
light amid the banners and streamers
which depended from the ceiling.
The room was occupied by three tables
extending its entire length. They were
covered with snowy linen and profusely
decorated with pyramids and fountains
of flowers, above which the scarlet cross of
tbe Y. M. I. arose as a reminder that even
in the hours of pleasure the members
should not forget that it was their duty to

The grand officers sat at the head, or
east end, of the hall, and Frank B. Hoo
son, the Haywards agent of The Call.
1 presided as toastmaster. On the stage
back of the grand offlÂ©*W sat the Oakland
i Concert Band of sixteen pieces, discoursing
! some of the finest selections in its reper
toire.
After considerable headway had been
gained by the banqueters and the fogrs of
appetite had begun to lift sufficiently to
show the banqueters the smiling face of
the toastmaster toasts were declared to be
in order, and J. E. Crooks, the horticultural
humorist of Hay wards, was called upon to
respond to the first sentiment, that of
"The Ladies." Mr. Crooks was in his bap
pit-t vein, and kept his hearers, now
heartily applauding his gallant sentiments
and now convulsed with merriment at his
droll sayings. He is a natural born wit,
and has been the life of the party since the
assembling of the council.
After "The Ladies" came "The Native
Sons of the Golden West," appropriately
responded to by Dr. A. J. Powell, a Native
Son. He felicitously mentioned that the
majority of the delegates to the Y.M.I.
Council were native sons, and that the
toast was in its proper place, next to "The
Ladies," at the head of the list.
The honor of responding to "The Y. M.
I." fell upon James Gallagher, a delegate
from the vinelands of Fresno. Mr. Galla
gher is a bricht young lawyer and leading
citizen of that place and an eloquent
speaker. He told of the hum ble beginning
of the order, the meaning of its motto,
"For God and Country-" The fact that
they were members of the institute, he
said, was proof of the loyalty and patriot
ism of its members. This loyalty was not
composed of words. It dwelt in the bosom
of every member of the Y. M. 1., and every
member was ready to spring to the de
fense of this country against foes from
within or without, and to shed his blood
and lay aown his life, if need be, for the
perpetuation of the principles of the
American Republic.
No. 4.7, Livermoreâ M. G. Callaghan, J. W.

Mr. Gallagher's patriotic sentiments
were applauded to the echo.
"Our Sunny South" was represented by
I. B. Dockweiler of Los Angeles. He
spoke wittily as well as earnestly on this
theme, and paid Northern and Central
California the compliments befitting the
occasion.
Frank Kierce of San Francisco responded
feelingly to the toast, 'â¢Our Past Presi
dents."
"The Twelfth Grand Council" was the
theme set for James E. Kenny, and he
acquitted himself admirably.
John McDade, one of the oldest and
most faithful members of the order, re
sponded to "The Supreme Council." .
"Faith and Fraternity" was the stirring
theme of which W. Stanley made the
most.
The response to "The Board of Direct
ors" was made by A. R. Denicke on be
' half of that body.
J. T. Greany responded to the toast
"California."
"Our Country" was the sentiment on
which Frank Murasky made a happy
sDeech brimful of patriotism. Mr. Mu
rasky is a line elocutionist and delivered
the stirring sentences in his aduresa in a
very effective style.
"Future of the V.M.1.," a subject of
I unlimited range, was handled by John
I Lynch. He made the most of his oppor
tunity, and the tabies rattled again and
again with the din of applause.
This completed the regular order of
toasts and volunteer sentiments springing
up from all quarters brought forth many
enthusiastic speeches.
It was an early hour before the banquet
was declared at an end.
SWEET MUSIC ROSE.
Open-Alr Afternoon Concert by the
Oakland Band.
HAYWARDS, Cal., May 21.â The open
air concert by the Oakland Concert Band
of sixteen pieces was billed for 2 p. m., but
the warm rain fell drearily on the green
hills and the fat orchards that make Hay
wards one of the prettiest garden spots in
California, and the band waited for the
sunshine and the patches of clear blue sky,
which came about 3 o'clock.
The bandstand was a streetcar under
the big aich of evergreens. George H.
Richardson, the leader, occupied the con
ductor's station, the appropriate place for
him, while the young man with the bass
drum thumped away in the place where
the car-driver is wont to whack the Hay
wards carhorse with a bull whip.
The population came out upon the side
walks and sat at the neighboring windows
where they could hear the music.
Chairs were set in front of the leading
places of business for the accommodation
of the pretty girls, and they iormed a bou
quet of beauty that was admired by the
visitors more than the music.
The programme was carefully made up,
the popular and catchy airs of Balfe and
Bailey being interspersed with choice bits
! from the more studied compositions of
Wagner, Guonod and Rossini. The solos
were exceptionally well played, the clar
ionet, cornet, trombone, barytone and xylo
phone being applauded by the loud clap
! ping and encores of hundreds of people.
The concert was sadly missed by the
! delegates, they being in session in Native
Sons' Hall until nearly 7 o'clocK in the
evening. The following is the programme
of music:
"Erinneroncr an Tannhauser" â¢ R. Warner
' Overture, 'â¢ Jlirella" Charles Gounod
| Kecltallon and aria from "Bohemian Girl"...Balfe
(Barytone solo played by i l.ar Dittmar Jr.)

Captain. E. C. Genereaux and wife,
daughter of George F. Weeks, editor of
the Californian, who were married at
Bakerslield on April 29, returned from
their wedding trip in Southern California
on Monday last, and on Wednesday even
ing, as previously announced, were the
guests of honor at a reception given by
the groom's mother, at her residence, 715
Webster street. The rooms had been
most beautifully decorated for the occa
sion with ferns and flowers arranged iv an
artistic manner.

INSECTS OF LIGHT.
Some Give Off Sufficient Illumination to i
Head By.
A widely circulated work on the natural |
wonders of sea and land says gravely that
there are many insects that furnish a far |
superior light to our own lampyris or fire '
fly, called by children "lightning bug."
The great lantern tly of India can supply
a light which is quite strong enough to
read by. in this instance the light ema
nates from the head, instead of from the
lower body, as in the firefly.
In the Antilles the coloeptera, the fire
bus; of that region, is of great use, being
employed in place of lamps by the poorer j
people. In Cuba it is the* custom of |
women to inclose these insects in glass
cages, where they emit light enough to
work by.
Travelers there also, when passing
through the wood by night, affix a tire
beetle to each of their feet, by which their
way is fairly light. The Creolea are given
to the practice of deftly arranging these
luminous insects in their bair, where they
produce a dazzling effect superior to jew
els. The negresses at their national dances !
scatter them over their airy garments, I
when, in their luminous movements, their j
bodies assume the appearance of being
robed in flames.

A general, simultaneous censns of the

Obeyed Order*.
An Irish member of the Sixth Regiment
of South Carolina Infantry was stationed
on the beach of Sullivaus Island, with
orders to walk between two specified pointa
and let no one pass without giving the
countersign. He was one of those soldiers
who beliesed in obeying orders to the let
ter. Two hours after Hugh had thus been
stationed (he corporal with the relief ap
peared in the moonlight, and was aston
ished to see Hugh; walking to and fro
up to his waist in water. The tide had
come in.
"Who goes there?" demanded the senti
nel.
"Relief," answered the coeporal.
"Halt, relief! Advance, corporal, and
give the countersign."
"But I am not coming in there to be
drowned. Come out and let me relieve
you."
â¢Never a bit," said Hugh. "The liften
ant told me not to leave me post."
"Well, then," said the corporal, starting
to move away," "you may stay there ali
night."
"Half." thundered the sentry. "I'll put
a hole in ye if you pass without the coun
tersign," and he cocked and leveled the
gun.
"Confound you and the lieutenant,"
answered the corporal. "Everybody will
1 hear it if I bawl it out to you."
"Vis, me darling, and the liftenant said
it must be given in a whisper. In with ye;
i me finger's on the trigger."
There was nothing for the corporal to do
; but to wade out where the faithful sentinel
stood.
"Be jabers," said that worthy, "it'a
well you've come ! The dhirty tide has al
most" drowned me." â Toronto Catholic

NEW YORK, N. V., May 21.â The manner In
which the stock market opened this morning was
disappointing to the central run of traders, ho
were confident that the sport in Suearjust previ
ous to the close of business yester.iay would be
1 followed by a further advance this morning. The
sfck, instead of moving up, ran off rapidly from
1225/ B to i'-l ":4- This movement, however, had
no appreciable influence on the general list, which,
after yielding fractionally, developed considerable
strength. Manhattan was an exception, selling off
nearly a DOint to loin's, while Metropolitan Trac
tion advanced nearly as much, riling to 109S/ 8l the
highest price tor some time. As the day wore
along the bulls displayed increased confidence,
end bid up prices all alone the line. The operation
was not adifilcultone because of the comparatively
large outstanding abort Interest. Rumors gained
circulation that a statement would he made by the
foremost Republican candidate, In which he would
declare himself in favor of the gold standard. On
this there were considerable purchases to cover.
Sugar advanced from 1213 /4 ,to 123%, and Man
hattan from 101% to 1031/2- while the remainder
of the list improved anywhere from 1/4 10 1 per
cent.. Final quotations were within a fraction of
the best figures of the day. Net changes show
pains of >i!<j, s /i. Sugar leading. Total sales were
143.1L0 shares. Speculation closed firm in tone.
Bonds were firmer and higher. Sales footed up
$1,035,000. Kansas and Texas seconds rose 114
to 60: Missouri, Kansas and Eastern fives, 1 to 92;
Pittsburg and Western fours. 1 to 76.
In Government bonds $1000 coupon fives
brought 112%.

CUICAtiO MARKETS
CHICAGO. lv., May 21.â State of Michi
gan has come an interesting and active factor
in the wheat market. Yesterday and to-day the
speculative eye was watching the developments
in that direction, and speculators were prepared to
take their inspiration from the news received
therefrom. Damage reports have been plentiful,
but whether the trouble was general or whether it
was confined to spots the future must determine.
The Hessian fly is ths cause of the trouble, but
many persons qualified to speak claim that this
Insect works erratically and Its damage is entirely
of a local character. However, the price of wheat
was Improved to-day by the renorts.
The Cincinnati Price Current issued a rather
bullish summary of wheat crop conditions for the
week. Receipt* at Chicago were three cars and
41,614 bushels were taken from store. The North
west had 274 cars, against 273 last Thursday and
163 a year ago. Liverpool cables were up i.4d in
sympathy with the yesterday strength of Ameri
can markets. At noon the market gave evidence
of weakness, and from that time to the close prices
declined steadily. Early buyers sold out and
short sellers assumed an aggressive attitude.
Benin and Paris closing cable* were higher, Ant
werp was unchanged. Atlantic seaboard clear
ances were fair at 272.518 bushels. July wheat
opened from 62 ",4 cto 6'J3' c. sold between tJ'-^ic
anil 60% c, closing at 60X' B (a6lc. lygc under yes
terday. Estimated receipts tor to-morrow eight
cars.
CORN â There was nothing new to report in corn.
The market was dull and the tone mostly a sym
pathetic one. Receipts were light at 17'- cars and
the output from store heavy at 390,267 bushels,
but these fuels attract no attention in face of the
knowledge that the country is full of corn, which
farmers have held back in the vain hope of belter
prices. Liverpool cables were steady.
The Cincinnati Price Current reported the out
look for the corn crop encouraging. Export clear
ances were 290,237 bushels. July corn opened at
29"/2(5(295,;,c. sola between 30c and 293/sc, closing
at -!Â»:'.," -:â¢â  -j<\ 1 ;; 'a-' Â±<- uuder yesterday. Esti
mat- d receipts for to-morrow 236 cars.
OATSâ What was true of com was applicable to
oats. The market was dull and featureless, and
the motion of prices was governed by that of
wheat. Receipts were 185 cars, and '-'22,544 bush
els were taken from store. Export clearances
were 61,380 bushels. The Cincinnati Price Cur
rent made reference to an encour:iring outlook for
the oat crop. July Oats closed Ys&ViC under yes
terday. Estimated receipt ; for to-morrow, 240
cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash. 88V2C bid; July,
S.'iVijc; September, 87c. Receipts, 18 cars.
PROVISIONS â ty*M not strong, having to con
tend with a weakening Influence of a lower hog
market. Early, however, they were assisted in
the belter feeling of the grain markets, being
enabled to make a slight gain in price thereby.
When wheat, corn and oats took a declining course
provisions were left without support and the early
gain was lost, additional depreciation also taking
place. July pork closed 20(jn;22V2 c under yester
day: July lard 15c lower: July ribs s@7Vz>-' lower.

day. Fine goods were in good demand arid stocks
were well cleaned up. Prices were unchanged.

906 Broadway, May 21. f
There was a genuine bare-knuckle con
test on the narrow-gauge ferry-boat that
left San Francisco at 6:45 to-night. The
principals were Dr. Louis Y. Cranz and
Dr. C. B. Cahusac, and the cause of the
encounter was an alleged insult to Dr.
Cranz's wife and daughter by Dr. Cahusac.
The fight lasted several minutes, and th<?
crowd thai always crosses the bay at that
time made no effort to stop the contest
ants, as they both showed an inclination
to play fair. Finally the captain left the
pilot-house and went on the lower deck
and separated the angry medicos.
Dr. Cahusac" got decidedly the worst of
it all the way through, and nis knuckles
were bleeding freely at the close. His
face showed marks of punishment and he
was greatly in need of breath.
Dr. Cranz did not altogetner escape
punishment, but his carnages were com
paratively slight.
During tne encounter enough expres
sions escaped the men's lips to let the in
terested throng know that a woman was
at the bottom of the whole affair, but the
doctors were so excited that it was difficult
to teil who was tne aggrieved or who was
the transgressor.
After being separated Dr. Cranz rushed
over to his panting adversary and shouted
with upraised fist:
"If you don't apologize to me before to
morrow I'll beat the life out of you."
As the men ieft the boat they were
asked regarding tbe trouble. Dr. Cranz
Bpoke veiy freely. He said:
â â 'i'liat man Cahusac was a neighbor of
ours for a long time. My office is in San
Francisco, and I live at 1411 St. Charles
t. Alameda. Cahusic is an auditor
or something in Mr. Wilder's office. He
poses as a doctor. Sometime ago he of
fered an insult to my little daughter. S;>e
told her mother, and Mrs. Cranz, fearing
my wrath, did not at once teil me. After
that he attempted to make love to my
iv.feaud has followed up his attentions,
and at la^t she told me of his insults.
"1 found him on the boat to-night and
I demanded an immediate apology. He
refused to apologize, and I proceeded to
satisfy myself some other way. Uniesa he
apologizes I will thrash him every time we
meet.
â¢*I befriended him some time ago when
he was hard up, and he repays me by in
sulting my family. If be does not apolo
gize to-night 1 shall hunt him up to-mor
row. I shali report his conduct to Mr.
Wilier, and I do not think the railroad
will care to retain such an employe."
Dr. Cahusac was surprised at his treat
ment. He handed out a card which read,
"Dr. C. B. Cahusac, 1416 St. Charles street,
Alameda." He lives at present at 3265
Central avenue.
â¢It is all a surprise to me," said Dr.
Cahusac to-night. "We have always been
friends, and I am at a loss to account for
it at all. lam sure that Dr. Cranz has no
grievance against me, and I refuse to
apologize. It is all very strange. I sup
pose I shall get the worst of it, but 1 really
don't Know what it all means."
Dr. Cahusac did not ride up from the
mole in the same coach with Dr. Cranz.
ELEVENTH AMENDMENT
The Alameda Woman's Suffrage
Convention Opens Bril
liantly.
"The Call's" Espousal of the Cause
Meets With the Assemblage's
Hiarty Approval.
AL A.MEDA, Cal., May 21.â The Woman
Suffrage Convention, held under the au
spices of the Political Equality Club of Ala- j
rueda, was called to order this afternoon at
3 o'clock by Mrs. C. L. Wood, president ol
the society, in Armory Hall. The stage
was festooned with ivy and eschscholtzias
and looKed exceedingly hanasome.
Quite 400 ladies were present, but the
edict of not wearing hats was forgotten,
only some twenty ladies appearing in
their seats minus their headgear. On the
siage were seated members of the two
local organizationsâ the Political Equality
CJub and the Woman's Auxiliary.
Mrs. Wood introduced Mis.-* Mary G.
Hay from Indianapolis, who is a National
or/ani^er of the Woman's Suffrage Asso
ciation, and she. took charge of the meet
ing. Aitcr a hymn and prayer Miss Hay
in clear and concise tones threw conipli- [
men's at Alameda. She said it was the;
banner county and that the ladies of tiie |
city had planned the most systematic j
scheme fur obtaining voters in favor of
amendment eleven. She recapitulated I
Susan B. Anthony's work in this direction
during the last half century, and drew at
tention to the iact that twenty-eight States
allowed women to vote in school matters,
one In municipal, ami threeâ Wyoming,
Colorado and Utahâ gara them equal
rights with male voters. She alluded to
the badge and asked ea:h one to wear it
to provoke discussion.
"The majority of the press in the State
i- in favot of the movement," she said.
"When The Call of San Francisco nob.y
came out and stated in its editorials and
columns that it would light for the pas
sage of the amendment, it took a step it
will never regret. It brought othÂ«r papers
to their senses, arid they are now advo
cating the measure, thoujrh not so posi
tively as The Call. The ministers, too,
are in line on the question, and we hope
the masses are al*o. So now we are stand
ing on vantage ground. Yet unless every
one works to secure its passage it is likely
noÂ» to carry."
Mru. Wood then formally welcomed
Miss Hay to Alameda as one of the W T i?e
Women from across the Rockies. Miss
Hay reeponded, and then Mrs. N. F.
Bovren of Alameda delivered an address
on "The Ideal Government." The gist of
the address was a contention that every
thing to be ideal or perfect must contain a
duality of male and female qualities.
Rev. Mrs. E. T. Wiikes followed with a
stirrinc address on "Why Do I Want the
Ballot?" She said: "I want tbe Dallot,
not because I think if women are granted
votes it will bring about the millennium;
not because I think it will make all women
ali-wise, all-virtuous and all-powerful, but
because I think there is an abnormal em
phasis put upon sex."
Miss Severance, in her trenchant style,
followed with a discourse on "Woman as a
Taxpayer," and then the convention
closed for the day.
In the evening Miss Yates addressed a
larger assemblage than in the afternoon.
Quite half of the audience was composed
of men. Her address was a historical and
humorous description of the inequalities
women have lived and suffered under dur
ing the past hundred years. The various
flimsy excuses tcr not attending conven
tions and discussing this question were
treated to kindly sarcasms hignlv enjoyed.
The butchers and their wives of Alameda,
all going to Shell Mound Park yesterday,
was dilated upon, and she wondered what
would have been said if all the crush and
jamming had been of men and women
going to vote.
Tn-morrow afternoon Rev. Anna Shaw
will use her famous ballot-box, and in the
evening she will address the male voter.
Board of Education.
ALAMEDA, Cal, May 21.â Only three
members of the board attended the meeting
Tuesday evening. Three applications for
positions as teacher and one for a janitor
ship were received. Mrs. E. M. North re
signed her position as teacher in the Wil
son school. The county appropriation
was notified to be $6601 65." It was resolved
to grant a half holiday to the school chil
dren on May i' 9. Accounts to the amount
of $372 were passed for payment.
The principal of the high school reported
$209 25 as the net proceeds of the late en
tertainment in Armory Hall, and he was
instructed to handle the money for the
purchase of suitable books for the high
school library. The school superintend
ent called the attention of the board to the
fact that 672 children had not attended
schooi during the past year, and pointed
out that section 64 of the act of 1874 pro
vided for compul&ory education. The
matter was referred to the judiciary com
mittee. The census marshal's report was
accepted.
The compulsory law provides that chil
dren must attend school between the ages
of s ana 14 years. The law is a dead letter
in the State". The School Suj erimendetit
was requested to iÂ»ct as truant inspector,
and report the non-attendants to the ju
diciary committee.
Alameda Republicans.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. May 21.â The Regular
Republican Club met this evpnine in the
Linderman Opera-house. Fifty members
wire present." The delegates to Sacra
mento gave a lengthy report of their do
ings at the convention. It was decided to
organize precinct committees at the earli
est possible moment. Mr. Walker of 0 k
land stated that it was t:ie intention fo or
ganize a young men's Republican club for
the county, the rirst meeting to be held in
Fraternal Ha!i, Oakland, to-morrow nigtit.
A drill corps for the Presidential cam
paign is to be formed and in future the
club meetin s will be held on Saturday
night in G. A. R. Hall.
Two Inquest*.
ALAMEDA. Cal., May 21 âEvidence of
a negative character, was taken by the Cor
oner to-day as to when and where the un
known woman and man met their deaths
at the beginning of the week. The jury in
each case returned a verdict of death by
drowning. An extraordinary conflict of tes
tirnonv is apparent between the evidence
of J. W. Johnson, the master of the Annie
Eliza, and Mrs. Charles Evans, who lives
about seventy feet away from where the
woman's body was found. Mrs. Evans
persists in saying the Annie Eliza came in
on Wednesday, and tne captain that he
did not get in until late Friday night.
Matthew Schneider Dead.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 21.â Matthew
Schneider died at his home, 205E5 Clinton
avenue, this evening from the effects of an
operation. He was an old resident of Ala
n-.eda, and for many years agent of The
Call in this city. He was 51 years of age,
a native of (iermany, and leaves a widow
and three children.
DUE TO A BROKEN FLANGE
Serious Accident to an Electric
Car Near Lake Merritt
Dam.
It Left the Track, Lurched Violently
and Badly Injured Many Pas*
sengers.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, May 20 . )'
A broken flange od the wheel of a car of
the Haywards electric road caused a serious
accident yesterday morning. The car was
approaching Oakland, and had crossed the
dam over Lake Merritt in safety. As it
took the curve at the east end of the dam
the car jumped the track, and several
passengers were injured.
There were seventeen passengers on the
car, and they were jostled and thrown
about with considerable violence. One of
the passengers, named Johnson, says he
was projected through a window. There
were several pnsienpers standing on the
front platform when the accident occurred
They were shot off, and landed in the.
mud.
W. B. Zimmerman thus explains the
catastrophe: "The accident was caused by
the breaking of tbe flange on the forward
wheel on the left-hand side, that is, the
; <-!de toward the south. The piece of tbe
flange which broke off was about six
inches long. The car had met with an
other accident shortly before on the trip
to town. We did not discover that until
after the accident on Twelfth street. In
the first accident the same wheel lost an
other piece of its flange. It dropped it on
Fifth avenue, near Sixteenth street. The
piece of the flange that broke off there was
about a foot anil a half long. That piece
was also picked up and taken back to the
power-house. I had the car running at
the rate of about seven miles an hour at
the time of the accident. That was a little
slower than tbe usual rate of speed, and
the car was going up grade at the time."
Dr. Wendte Called Eatt.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 21.â Rev. C. W.
Wendte of the First Unitarian Church of
j this city is now in Boston on bis wedding |
! tour, and has been invited to fill the pulpit I
1 of the Church of the Unity of Boston. !
! Last year t c Rev. Mr. Wendte tendered
I his resignation of the Oakland pulpit, but
then it was because of some dissatisfaction
with the way in which the church finances
had been conducted, and to give the con
gregation the privilege of choosing a suc
cessor if it desired to do so. But the church
spoke as with one voice and requested the
pastor to remain. The burden of the deDt,
which had been troubling him, was light
ened a little.

HUNTINGTON HIS TEXT.
A Vallejo Preacher Gathering Data on
the Railway Magnate's
Career.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 21.â Rev. W. L.
Gaston, pastor of tho Cornell Baptist
Church at Vallejo, is obtaining data for
the purpose of preaching a sermon on C.
P. Huntington's protection from justice
on account of his wealth. He has writ en
to W. B. Soule, formerly president of the
County Federation of Labor, to help nim.
Rev. W. L. Gastou says: "You will re
member that in the sacred volume we
read that King Solomon made eolden tar
gets and golden shields. This, it occurs
to me, would be an excellent foundation
for a lesson on the issues of the
day. 1 might ttnd occasion to denounce
the encroachment of concentrated wealth
upon every division of government, its
[ oppression of labor, together witti its utter
disregard of right and law. As you know,
all archers to-day shoot at the golden
target. Many hijch-hai.ded criminals v:o
-! late all law with impunity; plunder me
j public, then evade justice and escape retri
! bution by hiding behind goldt-n shields.
"If you have any data that bear directly
J upon the abnormal greed of man, or of the
! rich escaping t c day ot judgment because
j of money, will you kindly put them in my
possession? If you have any data con
cerning the attempt to arrest C. P. Hunt
ington for violating the interstate com
merce act by i^uing a free pass to an
Oakland attorney named Stove, will you
send them also?"
The request of the Vallejo clergyman
was handed to Thomas J. Kobers, the

who replied to it,

Oakland Officx San Fbasoboo Call,)
908 Broadway, May 21. f
Albert T. Col, an aged G. A. R. veteran.
is charged with the serious offejise of h.iv
ine fraudulently obtained a second pension
from the United States Government under
an assumed name after having i ad one
issued under his own name. As a conse
quence Deputy United Slat's BecTet Ser
vice Agent Harris has been searching this
city for the pa6t two days with a warrant
for his arrest, but as yet has found no
trace of him.
From the story told it would appear that
he has discounted the story of "Dr.
J*kyl! and Mr. Hyde" for a year or more.
During this time he I as been an inmate of
the Yountville Soldiers' Home as Albert
T. Cox and also at the Santa Monica Sol
diers' Home, but as another individual,
being known there as George Lawson. It
i~ under this name that he is charged with
having secured the second pension and for
which he is wanted.
Cox is an unmarried man about GO years
of age, and is said to be a very shrewd in
dividual, notwithstanding he has a strong
liking for liquor. For several months he
had been receiving mail directed to George
Lawson, but threw off suspicion by telling
that Lawson was on old soidier friend of
his, who Jived in the Hawaiian Islands,
and that he was trying to secure a pension
for him.
The pension was granted Lawson by the
Government about three weeks ago, and he
received back pay to the amount of $iW at
the same time. "Soon after this Cox oame
up from Santa Monica with his pockeis
full of money. He has drawn a pension
as Cox for about two years. At Santa
Monica the superintendent says tiiere is
no Cox; but that there is a George Law
son. Much surprise is expressed that he
was able to carry his plans out so success
fully.

They Are After the Men.'
BERKELEY, Cal., May 21.â Between
now and election time next November
every voter in Berkeley will be interviewed
by some member of the local Citizens'
Suffrage Society's campaign corps. A
plan has been adopted by the ladies
through which every voter will be seen
personal ly and prevailed upon to support
the cause of equal suffrage as indicated by
the proposed eleventh amendment to the
State constitution. They have prepared
lists of names and divided the town into
working districts. Voters who do not
readily yieli to the solicitations of the
ladies will be set down on a separate list,
so when one has done all one could with
a particular man another will be turned
on him. If the second lady does not suc
ceed a third one will try her fortune on
the obstinate voter.
Work has already been commenced and
a list of the supporters and non-support
ers of the suffrage cause is being kept Dy
Mrs. Ereanor Carlisle. The convention
held yesterday afternoon and evening im
bued the suffrage workers of Berkeley
with new interest and enthusiasm in the
cause. One of the leaders of tbe cause in
Berkeley remarked to-day tnat her co
laborers had put on the full armor of the
cause and were prepared for the campaign
to be waged in the hope of striking out
the word "male" from that part of the
State constitution which refers to the
voting franchise.

lie M. Bader.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 21.â Very quiet
but very impressive was the ceremony that
united judge A. L. Frick to Miss Tillie M.
Bader at the residence of the bride's
mother this morning.
lhe elaburate nuptial ceremony which
their many friends had anticipated was
supplanted by a quiet home wedding, in

RICH MEN IN OAKLAND
T. L Barker Says There Is a
Vicious Feeling Toward
Them.
Counci men Said to Ignore Everything
That App als to Common
Sense.
Oakland Office San* Fraxcisco Call,^
908 Broadway, May l'L )
T. L. Barker, one of the wealthiest men
in the city, has sated s-everal reasons why
men of means will not come to Oakland or
invest here.
An article in last Monday's Call, relat
ing to the little that has been done by rich
men in the way of adorning the city, has
promited a very interesting reply from
Mr. Barker. He writes:
"When ii is said 'there is not a single
vestige of evidence tending to show that
a public-spiriied man ever lived m Oak
land' some explanation is necessary. Ex
ception must be made of the Chabot Home
and the Chabot Observatory. The one
was given and endowed, and has been for
years and is now active and useful. The
other wa3 wnolly Riven as it now stands
equipped to the city, and by the city ac
cepted. And tbe san.e city that accepted
the gift will not to-day allow the water
company, established and to a large ex
tent, owned by Mr. Chabot while he lived,
and now by his heirs, to furnish water to
the building given by him. He also cave
the Ladies' Relief Society and Old Ladies'
Home GOO shares of water stock, worth
then $50,000â worth now $20,000â which is
si ill owned by that society.
"There has always been a somewhat
vicious feÂ»li'is toward men of means liv
ing in Oakland, which has tended to sour
them; ana" within the past three years
that feeline has been intensified, and is
now daily encouraged, and exists to such
an extent as to prevent men of means
from coming here to live and bringing
their money with them. No wealthy man
in his right mind would now come to this
city to live. We have an established rep
utation, and our city rulers seem to be la
boring, not in the interest of Oakland and
its citizens, but seeing how they can spite
Davie; not for one moment considering
bis suggestions and vetoes, but endeavor
ing to sit on them, without any consider
ation, because Davie suggests.
"Notwithstanding there has never been
a time when there were so many reasons
for fixing a very low tax lew as now, they
seem to be trying their very best to get rid
of all the money in sight and to throw
mud at any one who suggests a low rate of
taxation."

THE CREW AND
CAPTAIN DISAGREE.
Varying Stories About the
Waif on the Drifting
Boat.
WHAT THE MEN THINK.
They Say a Rescue Would Have
Been Easy Under the
Circumstances.
HEARD LOUD CRIES FOR HELP.
Statements Made by the Mate and
Some of the Sailors From the
John A.
If it should be the misfortune of Cap
tain Hellquist of the schooner John A to
fall overboard, he has the doubtful conso
lation of knowing that not one of his
present crew would reach over the vessel's
side to rescue him.
This feeling between crew and master
was brought about by the action of Cap
tain Hellquist toward an unfortunate man.
seen by every member of the crew on tha
arrival of the John A inside of the Heads
last Monday morning.
The statement of the captain in regard
to the matter was as follows:
We were coming into port with a very stiff
breeze and a strung ebbtide, and just as we
got opposite Lime Point I noticed a boat,
either swamped or overturned, and I could
also see a man who appeared to be sitting
astride the boat. I immediately ordered the
mate to run u\< a signal, and afu-r this was
done we started to get our skiff ready to send
out. but just as two men were about ready to
start in it I said: "Hold on, men, there is no
use of you getting drowned; If that Whitehall
enn't weather this wind surely our little skiff
cannot." We were having: a herd time to get
in anyway, and we were then in the most dan
gerous part of San Francisco Hay.
We *oon saw the Government tugboat which
runs to Lime Point and all commenced to hol
ler at her. The captain heard -.is and l pointed
In the direction of the boat. He started in the
direction in which I pointed, but only held
this course for about five minutes and then re
turned to his regular course. I notified the
Merchants' Exchange and also one of Hpreek
e'..-' tups, but whether they went out or not I
do not know. The steam schooner American
Girl was coming just behind us, but she made
no effort at rescuing the unfortunate man.
This account of the affair is character
ized by the crew as being false in every
particular, and in addition the captain is
condemned by the men for his treatment
of the man.
The story of the crew differs in every
particular from that of the captain, and
can be best told by repeating what is said
by the first mate. E. F. Erickson, and
Fred .Jessan, Axal Hogland, T. Olsen and
1. Jacobson, all members of the crew.
Their version of what occurred is as fol
lows:
We had got well inside the Heads and were
steering northeast by east, when between the
red buoy and Fort Point the second mate, Jonn
Syderwol, heard a voice calling for help. On
looking over the port bow he saw a man on a
boat's keel, with one hand raised over h:s
body and the other apparently holding on ti
the boat. The mute sang out "Man overboard!"
His exclamation drew the attention of the first
mate, Mr. Erickson. and Seaman Hogland, who
were at the wheel at the time, and tney in turn
looked in the same direction as did the second
mate, and plainly heard the appeal for help
coining from the man on the drifting and up
turned boat. They think he could not have
been more than 150 yards away from the
John A.
By this time the entire crew's attention had
become attracted to the perils of the poor fel
low at the mercy of a fast-running ebbtide
and a stiff gale blowing in through the Golden
Gate.
Mate ErickÂ«on at once ordered the skiff to be
got ready for launching. This command was
instantly obeyed by Jessan and others of the
crew who ran to his assistance. In the mean
time Mate Erickson notified Captain
Hellquist. who was below at the
time. When tne captain came on
deck and was informed of what the matter was,
he stopped the men from lowering the skiff
and ordered the mate to hoist the flag at half
mast, which mm done, and which attracted
the attention of a small steamer, which came
in the direction of the John A. She seemingly
d.d not understand what the matter was, and
after taking a circle about the schooner
steamed away.
, Every one of us wonld have been willing to
jump into ihe skiff ami go to the man's rescue
if the captain had not prevented us, and we
Bre sure we couM have saved him. It was not
Mowing too hard, as we were well Inside the
Heads, and tnere was the steamer within hail
i:.g distance to come to our rescue. But the
captain wouldn't have it, as he eaid he would
be likely to be driven out to sea and lose a
couple of hours' time making it up.
One thing is sure, that every one of us is go
ing to quit the schooner now. Not one of us
will ever sail with Captain Hell'iuist again.
He has convinced us that he seta but poor
value on the life of an unfortunate man who
may be cast out to the mercy of the sea.
we are certainly at a loss to know how the
captain Could make the statement that he fhw
do lift- in the man on the upturned boat, when
every one of us saw him wave his arm and we
all plainly heard his cries for assistance.
Help could and would have been rendered
him by us in ten minutes if the skipper had
not prevented us when the mate ordered the
skiff lowered.
This statement of the crew differs some
what from that made by Captain Hell
quist. Whicn is the correct one is a matter

THE OLD FLIM-FLAM.
K. M. Samuels of New York Played
It I'iMiii a Pawnbroker.
John H. N. Clausen, pawnbroker, 519
Washington street, swore to a complaint
in Judge Campbell's court yesterday,
charging R. M. Samuels with petty lar
ceny, and the warrant was served upon
Samuels in the City Prison.
Samuels is a New York crook who has
been swindling several of the local mil
liners by means of forged drafts and who
was arrested on Wednesday night by De
tective Harper.
Clausen says that Samuels played the
flim-flam game upon him on May 19.
Samuels had pawned his watch with
Clausen and went to redeem it. He put
$15 on the counter and Clausen handed
him the watch. Before Clausen could
take the $15 from the counter Samuels
nanded him a letter and asked him to read
it. While Clausen was doing so Samuels
picked up the $15 and walked out of the
store.
NEW HOME-MADE HALOS
Attorneys in the Bitumen Con
solidated Case Indulge
in Satire.
Defendant's Brief Reads Like a Twain
Dissertation on Morals and
Manners.
The suit of A. C. Bassett vs. J. A. Fair
child, including the Bitumen Consolidated
Mining Company, has taken a satirical
turn.
A. C. Bassett and J. H. Swift drew out
of the Bitumen Consolidated Mining Com
pany some months ago and instituted
suits against the other directors, alleging
fraud, conspiracy and a general misuse of
the company's tunds.
The plaintiffs charged that Manager
Fairchild had taken the Supervisors to
Pismo Beach and treated them to a clam
bake and vine supper during their visit of
inspection to the company's bitumen
mines and that said bake, wine, whisky,
cigars, etc., cost the company something
like f 400. As a result of that clambake
Manager Fairchild claims that the com
pany sold 40,000 tons of bitumen, but that
has nothing to do with the plaintiffs' aide
of the story.
Four weeks ago plaintiffs' attorneys,
Messrs. Guimison, Booth & Bartnett, filed
a sarcastic brief with Ju>ige Seawell, in
which the clambake was commented on at
length. Now comes Frank tihay for tha
defendants and his effort in the satirical
vein makes good reading.
Among other things he sets forth:
"Counsel tor the plaintiffs in the above
entitled action have served and filed what
they term 'plaintiffs' opening proof.' In
unstinted abuse of the defendants it fol
lows the bad example they set in their
complaint. * * * They have evidently
sought to divert the attention of tne court
by calling the defendants bad names by
the use of epithets, elegant and otherwise,
and by assuming the existence of fraud,
dishonesty, conspiracy and cheating,
where there is no evidence upon which to
base such an assumption. * â¦ â¢ Since
their inception these suits have been
known as the mud suits, because of the
methods employed by the plaintiffs. â¦ â¢
"A great deal is said by them about the
clambake at I'ismo Beach, at which it
seems that certain persons at that time
Supervisors of the City and Countjr of San
Francisco were guests of the
Consolidated Mining Company.
"The clambake is described as absurd and
ridiculous, whereas the testimony shows
it to have been an eminently respectable,
decorous and properly conducted affair.
Counsel fairly shrieked with Horror at the
fact that those present at the little party
were treated to wine, whisky and cigars,
and seemed to be surprised that San Fran
cisco Supervisors ever indulged in such
amusements. No fault, however, seems to
have, been found with the quality of the
viands, nor do they charge that the quan
tity consumed was excessive. â¢ â¢ â¢
"So far as may be gathered from plain
tiffs' brief, skipping the parts where they
lose themselves in a sort of hysterical
abuse of the defendants, they seem to
claim that the defendants carelessly and
recklessly permitted some of the money
of the Bitumen Consolidated Mining Com
pany to be wasted in the payment of sal
aries, in the defense of certain litigations,
in the employment of counsel and special
agents and in treating certain City officials
to clams, wine, whisky, cigars and pousse
cafes. * * *
"Defendants are charged in both actions
with having looted the treasury by allow
ing themselves compensation for their
services as directors at the rate of $10 a
loot. Swift calmly ignores the fact that
he was one of the looters. To be sure he
retained the amount of his 'stealings'
(as he terms these payments when refer
ring to the defendants) a couple of months
afterward, although he stated that his con
science began to trouble him within an
hour or two after he had pocketed his
share of the swag. After battling with his
conscience for two months the still, smali
voice conquered and he made an attempt
to return to the treasury the money he
had received for services rendered as di
rector. Like most 'reformed' persons
who repent their sins and become saints
with brand-new home-made halos, Swift
conceived a violent hatred for his late as
sociates.
"Bassett was a reformer also. He bad
donned the red shirt and ssiected his bass
drum and cymbals long before the wave
was known to have struck Swift. The two
reformers entered into a combination to
either reform the other directors (and in
cidentally gain control of the corporation)
or break up the company. â¢ * â¢ They
failed, and, dropping their masks for a
time, set about causing the destruction of
the company. They determined to finan
cially injure these defendants even though
they themselves and their associates, Cap
tain N. T. Smith, Timothy Hopkins and
others, should be injured in the wreck. It
was a feeble imitation of the Samson act
without the Samson provocation."
The case is herewith submitted on briefs.
BetÂ« Were Declared Off.
David Eiseman, an employe of bookmakers
at the Ingleside racetrack, swore to complaints
in Judge Campbell's court yesterday for the
arreit of W. F. Fitzgerald and -John Doe"
Connors on the charge of misdemeanor embez
zlement. Eiseman mi VI that on May 14 he was
handed a pool ticket by Connors and paid him
(18 for Frank Eckart, the bookmaker. lie
also paid Fitzgerald $23 for Paui Ridloy, the
bookmaker. Both sjids were paid as soon as
the race was run and before the judges had
declared the result. The horses were disquali
fied and all bets were declared off. Connors
and Fitzgerald refused to return the money,
hence the warrants.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1896.
LOOKING FOR
LOST LOBSTERS
Dr. Smith Comes From
Washington City on a
Strange Quest.
CUNNING CRUSTACEANS.
Planted at Monterey, off Mendo
cino and Elsewhere, but
Can't Be Trapped.
MAY BE MYRIADS OF THEM.
Dr. Smith Will Solve the Mystery
Before He Returnsâ Has a Force
of Fifteen Men.
Dr. Hugh M. Smith of the United Btates>
Fish Commission is at the Grand Hotel on
his way to Monterey and other parts of
the coast to search for Eastern lobsters
Dr. Bngh AI. Smith of the United States Fish Commission, Who Has Arrived on a
Search for the Lost Lobsters.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist]
that were brought here and distributed
along the coast many years ago.
All trace of these lobsters has been lost,
and Dr. Smith as well as Captain Brice,
the new Fish Commissioner, wants to
know the reason of it. In the ordinary
course of things there should have been
myriads of these fine lobsters here. They
have been planted several times, but never
a lobster has been observed.
"It is a good deal of a mystery," said Dr.
Smith yesterday, who had just arrived
from Washington, D. C, "and we want to
find out what has become of them.
"Sometimes I think they are along the
coast in plenty, but are too sly to get
caught. The Eastern lobster is very cun
ning, and it is difficult to get him into the
trap unless the trap is made just right. I
have thought, maybe, the fishermen did
not understand these lobsters.
"This lobster is to the crustaceans what
the fox is to the animal kingdom. He is
exceedingly shrewd, and in addition to
having a trap that is just the thing, the
fisherman must manipulate it without
| making any mistakes.
"The Government has made tour or five
attempts to get these lobsters started, the
last being in 1889. We planted them in
Monterey Bay, off the coast of Mendocino
i County, and other places, as well as up on
the coast of Washington.
The California lobster has no claws, but
the Eastern lobster has a tremendous
claw and there is more meat in it than
on all the rest of his body. The average
weight of the latter lobster is about two
pounds, but there was one captured some
j time ago that is now illustrated life-sized
I in the reports that weighed twenty-three
| pounds. It was simply a giant among the
| lobsters.
"These lobsters would be a very valua
ble addition to the fish and crustacean
| supply of California. lam going down to
Monterey, and will do my best to solve
the problem as to what has become of
them.
"I may say in connection with this that
Fish Commissioner Brice intends to estab
lish five or six auxiliary fish hatcheries in
California. He will also establish others
in Oregon and at various points alone the
Columbia and elsewnere. Mr. Brice
is much interested in this subject. He
was for several years at Fort Gaston in the
service of the Fish Commission, and ob
tained a large amount of practical expe
rience.
Of course, here the great fish . is the
salmon. It is tho desire of the commis
sion to propagate these in immense
numbers. The only way the supply can
be kept up is by artificial propagation.
All the East is very much interested in the
planting of shad and striped bass here. In
the East the shad is considered the most
valuable fish there. It is well distributed,
is cheap and is easily caught."
Dr. Smith has charge of a division con
sisting of about fifteen scientists. The
work is divided up so as to suit the situa
tion. Dr. Smith has been for many years
connected with the United States Fish
Commission. He will be in California and
elsewhere on the coast for several months.
He is determined to find the lobsters if
they exist, and he thinks they do and are
lying low and evading the fishermen.
PREFERRED TO MARRY.
Antone Cunha, a Car Conductor, Es
capes Imprisonment by Wedding
Mamie A. Retilly.
Antone Cunha, a conductor on the elec
tric road in Oakland, was arrested Wednes
day night by Officer Irvine on a warrant
charging him with betrayal under promise
of marriage. When taken to the City
Prison and searched a revolver was found
in his pocket, and an additional charge
was placed apainet him of carrying a con
cealed weapon.
The complaining witness against him
was Mamie A. Reilly, a handsome, modest
looking girl living at 3230 Eighteenth
street.
Cunha had only been in the prison a
few minutes when the girl and a lady
friend appeared. She had procured a mar
riage license, and Cunha expressed his
willingness to enter into the bonds of mat
rimony. Justice of the Peace Groezinger
was sent for and in a few minutes the two
were made man and wife, the blushing
bride imprinting a kiss upon the debon
air Justice, which he seemed to ap
preciate.
Judge Low was seen by friends of the
young couple and he wrote out an order
of discharge for Cunha on both charges,
and bride and groom left together for Oak
land.
ANOTHER VINING VICTIM.
A Young Man Arrested for Battery on
Acconnt of Transfers.
A young man giving the name of George
R. Brown was arrested by Officer Morrisy
and taken to the Southern station at a
late hour last night on a charge of battery.
He resisted a conductor who attempted
to put him off a Market-street car because
he had failed to exchange his check for a
transfer at the junction of Powell street.
Tnere was quite a demonstration and the
bystanders raised their voices in encour
agement of the young man's grit and con
demnation of Manager Vining's new
transfer ruling.
DROPPED FROM SIGHT
Charles Billman Tells His Friends
That He Intends to Com
mit Suicide.
He Is Supposed to Have Tied Rocks to
His Body and Then Jumped
Into the Bay.
Charles Billman has been missing from
his place of business, 1519 Eddy street,
since Tuesday morning, and there is every
reason to believe that he has committed
suicide by jumping into the bay.
Billman was employed in the San Fran
cisco laundry as a marker, which position
he has capably filled for more than three
years, and some months ago he made a
trip to South America for the benefit of
his health, returning to the City apparently
much improved.
It seems, however, that in a few weeks
he was again taken sick and in conse
quence became very despondent. He told
several of his friends at the laundry and
elsewhere that he was tired of living, and
before many days he would bid them all a
long farewell. That was the nearest he
ever came until Tuesday of saying that he
intended to commit suicide.
Tuesday morning he appeared at the
laundry as usual, but about 9 o'clock
asked to be relieved for a time, as he was
not feeling well. Billman went immedi
ately to bis room, donned an old suit and
putting a couple of gunny sacks and a
stout rope under his arm started for the
Labor Commissioner's office. There he
met a couple of friends, passed a few
pleasant moments and then startled his
companions by announcing his intention
to take his own life. Bidding them a
hasty goodby, he started for Market street.
The friends started in hot pursuit.
Billman, observing that he was followed,
jumped a cur going in the direction of the
ferry. That was the last time Billman
was seen, so far as known.
Wednesday night George Holbeck, 612
Pine street, who was Billman's closest
friend, received the following letter, posted
at 1 p. m. Tuesday :
George: Watch, chain, $40. Charley.
In the envelope was found two Wells-
Fargo receipts calling for a package val
ued at $60 and a money package contain
ing $40.
Holbeck is confident that his friend
filled the sacks with rocks, tied them
about him and then jumped into the bay.
Bieltr.an came to Sun Francisco about
ten years ago from Australia. He was
popular with those who knew him, being
sober, industrious and intelligent, and evi
dently of good family. Some of his friends
contend that he is the son of a titled Eng
lishman and that he left home about
twelve years ago owing to some family
trouble.
A Musical Treat.
The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra with
James Hamilton Howe conductor and Bernard
Mollenhauer concert-master has projected a
scries of instrumental concerts to take place
in Golden Gate U all, commencing the second
Saturday alternoon of September and continu
ing until a series of six concerts are given. It
is intended to engage an orchestra of at least
thirty-live artists and to present the greatest
works of an the eminent composers in the
most perfect manner possible. The concerts
are intended to be of value to students to
whom the opportunity of listening to the
great works of the masters comes but seldom.
The concerts are not to begin before 3^of.k.,
to as to permit business men to attend them.
BURGLARS ENJOY
A PICNIC TIME
Lack of Respect for the
Church-Street Neigh
borhood.
A MISSION HOME LOOTED
Surprise of the Day Family
Upon Returning From
Shell Mound.
DIAMONDS AND LACES STOLEN.
Trunks Broken Open With a Stove-
Lid Lifter While the Ladies
Were on an Outing.
There are sore heads and sore hearts
after the picnic of the Butchers' Board of
Trade.
Under circumstances incidental to suc
cessful picnics, however, sore heads are
notunupual, but it is deplorable that there
should be sore hearts excepting where
Cupid makes his presence fell.
With this case Cupid had nothing to do.
Instead a bold burglar or two figured
prominently and so effectively that a
moral goes with the story: Either go to
a picnic with all your valuables aboard,
or stay away from picnics and watch said
valuables.
If Mrs. W. B. Day, Mrs. Edward Parker
and Miss Laura Boyea had gone to the
butchers' picnic Wednesday morning
without observing the rule that beauty
unadorned is adorned the most, they
would not be broken hearted to-day. In
stead of wearing light summer dresses and
big flowery straw hats, rightfully trusting
that their charms of feature would do the
rest, they should have piled on their laces,
jewelry and diamonds.
To cut the story short without any fur
ther reference to these ladies, they left all
their jewelry at home, 3841 Twenty-fifth
street, while they enjoyed an outing at
Shell Mound.
Burglar like, knowing his business, some
scoundrel chose the very day when every
body save a little dog had left the house to
ply his trade.
Fido was soon conciliated with the
kindly offer of a chunk of meat, and there
being no further objection to a thorough
inspection of the premises, Mr. Burglar
had things pretty nearly his own way.
As a matter of fact there was nothine to
prevent him from having everything his
own way excepting that the ladies had in
a thoughtless moment locked their trunks.
But this, after all, did not cut much of a
figure. The burglar, it is true, had not
brought along his improved tools, but
there was a stovelid-lifter handy and that
was all he needed.
\Yhh it he broke open four trunks, to the
great delight of Fido, who grabbed all the
garments hastily -cast aside during the
search for stuff of more immediate com
mercial value.
It was great fun for the pet dog, whose
only setback was wben Mr. Burglar, in
stead of casting away some of his findings
shoved them deep into his pockets,
Mrs. Edward I'arker, the widow of the
late postman of that name, lost a diamond
brooche with nve stones, a gold iocket and
chain belonging to her little daughter, two
new pairs of gloves and her late husband's
gold watch.
Mrs. W. B. Day lost a quantity of Valen
ciennes lace and some jewelry.
Miss Laura Boyea, who lives in Santa
Cruz and who is visiting here as school
mate and guest of Mrs. Day, will have to
write to her parents with some other than
the gold pen she received as a present last
! Christmas. In addition to this, the bur
glar toon a pretty gold necklace and some
rings she thought it would be unwise to
wear at the picnic.
W. B. Day, who is a commercial trav
eler, accompanied the ladies to the picnic,
leaving his cottage near Church street un
guarded, excepting by the dog, from 9
o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock at
night.
Returning at that time he tried to open
the front door, but a button-hook stuck in
the keyhole from the int>i<le prevented the
work of the latchkey. There was no use
I knocking or ringing the doorbell, because
â¢ there was no answer to be expected from
the inside, excenting the cheerful bark of
the dog.
Mr. Day procured a ladder and entered
a rear window, where Fido greeted him
with great demonstrations of joy, seem
ingly telling him in his own dog language:
"What a time; don't speak of it! The
bute: ers are not in it with the picnic the
burglar and I have had."
AVell, it looked that way. From bottom
to top the house was scattered with the
wearing apparel that the careful ladies had
packed away in trunks and that had been
as systematically examined by the burglar.
Captain Lees had his men on the prem
ises yesterday afternoon to find a clew,
but clews are very elusive nowadays, and
the best that the detectives could get is
that while the burclary was being com
mitted, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon,
a well-dressed stranger, looking like a
gambler, sat on the doorstep of the ad
joining house.
PAWNED HER RING.
Charles T. Lenihan, One of Durrant's
Witnesses, Arrested.
Charles T. Lenihan was arrested yester
day afternoon on a warrant charging him
with petty larceny. The complaining wit
ness is Miss Annie Crowley, 11 Norlolk
street. She stated that she was at a party
at a friend's house on Saturday night and
was introduced to Lenihan. He took a
fancy to her diamond ring and finally got
her to take it off her finger. He put it on
his own finger and kept it, and when the
party broke up he told Miss Crowley he
could not get it off his fineer but would
return it to her the following day. In
stead, he pawned it for $23 at 11 Taylor
street. The ring was worth $45. A search
warrant was also obtained and the ring
was recovered.
Lenihan is the young man who ac
quired some notoriety as a witness for the
defense in the Durrant trial by testifying
that he pledged rings similar to the
Blanche Lamoht rings with Pawnbroker
Oppenheim.
STONE WINS WAGES.
The Supreme Court Says Bancroft Must
Pay Him.
W. J. Stone has been given judgment by
the BupxesM Court in his suit against
H. H. Bancroft for salary as manager.
Stone was suing for sixteen months'
salary at $350 a month under a ten years'
contract commencing January 1, 1892.
The Superior Court gave him judement
and now the Supreme Court has affirmed
that result.
Bancroft claimed the money should be
paid by the partnership, of which Stone
was a member, but the court held that
Stone was not a real partner, and there
fore Bancroft would have to pay the salary
himself according to the original contract
made before the partnership was formed.

A SPECIAL BARGAIN.
Russet Shoes are now the style," and we lead for
nobby styles of Russets at . bedrock prices. No
odds and cuds, but everything new and well made.
We are still handicapped by that fence on the cor-
ner, and we have resolved to sell lower than ever.
We are offering special bargains this week. La-
dles' Fine Russet Kid Lace Shoes, with either kid
or brown cloth tops, and Ladies' Russet Kid But-
ton. They have very pointed toes and tips. Lat-
est style of Tokio last, which we will sell for
52.00
a pair. We defy competition. . No store in this
city is offering Russet Shoes like these under $3 50
or $3. The Ku3set kid is soft and pliable and taa
cloth is the best grade.
