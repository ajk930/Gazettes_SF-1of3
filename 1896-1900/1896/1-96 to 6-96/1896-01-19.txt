Britons Gasp Over What They Consider

LONDON", Eire., Jan. 18. â Although
these little islands are still resounding
with the turbulent echoes of Music Hall
tism and the dockyards are still
working overtime to hurry forward new
Fhips for commission, immediate occasion
for excitement seems to have passed away.
Germany produces the effect of having
â¢ i down. Even those of her inspired
I avers who keep up the ugliest talk ad
mit that there is 110 overt action just at pres
ent. They say instead that Germany will
keep- the Transvaal just as France keeps
Egypt- as a weapon eternally hanging
over England's head to be used whenever
ts in a tight corner.
Fbis suggestion probably infuriated the
Englii than open defiance would
do. . .*.h amazement the report
that the Kaiser has .said that he is coming
to the Cowes regatta this summer, quite as
usual.
The cool impudence of this proposition
fastens universal attention upon a story
given with ail the appearance of veracity
in Truth that in 1894, while Emperor Wil
liam was entertaining the Prince of Wales,
the Duke of Cambridge and a dozen other
eminent Englishmen on board his yacht
off the Isle of Wight, a telegram was
brought in announcing a grave complica
tion between the French ani English in
ISiam and he jumpÂ«d on a chair, waved his
napkin and shouted, "Hurrah, at last you
are in trouble."
It is understood that something like this
.".-'i ; orrle here, turning it
over in their minds, feel that it will be im
possible for that young man to come her<;
any more. Some papers hint openly that
he gets drunk at table and then says and
does these incredible things, but the pun
ters to believe that he is a malignant
lunatic and the fire of popular antipathy
tv him burns on very steadily all over Eng
lan i.
Beyond the visible evidence that Lord
Salisbury is striving to use the German
quarrel to palch up an understanding with
France, the week has not brought much
to help clear the obscure and ijJS&jved
European situation. Overtures toFrench
friendship, which will fill the Knglish
papers, are too clumsy and obviously in
terested not to raise a smile on Parisian
lips, but there are signs that the idea is
being seriously considered nevertheless.
I imagine that the event of the next few
weeks will contribute rather sensationally
to this very desirable end.
It is whispered that in routing out the
gang of harpies who feasted on the poor
'â¢petit suriers'" carcass the police have
stumbled on an extraordinary lot of clews
to a much larger mystery. Ever since the
discovery of the Dreyfus treason, which
could net well be accounted for on merce
nary grounds, there has been growing up
the suspicion that a dan rerons sinister con
spiracy existed in the heart.: Paris, which
worked in close relation with the German
embassy, and served German purposes,
| nmarily sought to turn the be
trayal of France to the interest of a huue
international combination of financiers.
I get a hint now that the seizure of St.
Cere'fl papers has j at the evidence of this
into the hands oi the French Government
and that at the appropriate dramatic
moment there will be a disclosure whirh
will not only startle France but evoke an
explosion of popular fury aeainn Ger
many. Already the anti-Semitic French
press is talking plainly about this, and
though other papers still guardedly ob
serve their rule of saying nothing which
can offend the Jewish banking world, they
will be driven from their reserve if all one
hears about Rosenthal's connections are
true.
Tt is not a mere chance that all these
blackmailing journalists and politicians
who are in prison or on the threshold of
prison, and who have been doing some
thing to down the French inimosities
toward Germans', have been most violent
and persistent traducers of England.
It is plain enough that the Anglo
phobia of the Parisian press in recent
years has been deliberately incited and
paid for, and great hopes are being built
here on the belief that the French people
must realize this at Jast, and in their rage
at swindlers and traitors who have been
managing this anti-English crusade will
turn again to English friendship. Per
haps it would be better if these hopes were
more prudently moderated. Deloncle's
colonial group is still a powerful race to
bullr the Chamber of Deputies, and seri
ous papers like LÂ« Temps and Le Journal
dt-8 Debats .still iend themselves to its de
termined fight against allowing France
and England to become reconciled. They
seize now upon England's remarkable
n of territory on the Mekong not as
a gracious act, but as a proof that Eng
land is in a cowardly mood, which France
ouprht to utilize to pet also the Niger,
Egypt and whatever else she fancies.
Whether these people can intimidate
Bourgeois and Berthelotnext weekorover-
throw them in the Chamber of Deputies
is a nervously important problem. Per
haps they may, unless that^umored reve
lation of who is really behind Jthe colonial
group and its journalistic pirates is forth
coming.

is England's sole concern, at least on the
surface, in the continental policy. O:i all
sides old alliances seem to be meiting
away, possibilities of new and strange
combinations are rising out of a flood, and
literally no one knows what the morrow
may bring forth, but England has no Em
bassador at St. I'etersburg, and does not
intend sending one tili March, <vhieh lends
color to the suspicion that the Czar and
the Kaiser have established a partnership
which it is useless to try to upset.
Cecil Rhodes is actually at sea racing
homeward to begin the fiebt for the char
tered company before Parliament meets.
English attention will be speedily concen
trated on the domestic aspect of this great
upheaval. As matters stand to-day it is
thought probable that a majority could be
found in the House of Commons for re
voking the charter altogether. What the
feeling will be a month hence it isdiflicult
to say. 'In us far these queer people have
been p.ble to keep quite distinct their ven
eration for Jameson and their enthusiasm
for Chamberlain. These two emotions,
flatly contradicting each other, have ex
isted, so to speak, in the water-tight com
partments side by Bide, but when Rhodes
appears on the scene it is obvious that he
cannot be a National hero unless Chamber
lain worshipjis to be abandoned. The latter
was evidently within bounds the other day
when he warned a cheering Birmingham
crowd that his work was by no means
ended yet.
J i i- fight with Rhodes and the whole
tremendous social and financial Â£outh
African combination behind him will
strain him to the very utmost. If he
emerges victorious he will be indeed a
great man.
The story that the real destination of the
new special-service squadron is to be Ber
muda seems to have originated in the
gossip of the naval clubs, and though I
can learn nothing definite I am told by
oflicial friends that it will be pretty safe to
discredit it. Public opinion here would
regard the discovery that such a step had
been ordered as nothing short of a na
tional calamity. The speeches of Balfour
and Ridley have been gladly accepted as
official assurances from this side, as Olney's
action in placing the Americans in the
Transvaal under Britiih protection seems
to be from the other, that an amicable
settlement is no longer doubtful. To be
compelled to revise this opinion would
make everybody angry.
If Lord Salisbury ran abandon the whole
valuable Mekong Valley and actually
withdraw British garrisons from it to
please V ranee he surely cannot ask Parlia
ment or the country to support him in a
quarrel with America about an infinitely
smaller matter in which not even effectual
possession can be proved. But where the
living squadron is to go when the admiral
gets his sealed orders at Heechaven re
mains an entire mystery. It would serve
no purpose to retail the various specula
tions, for they are all equally guesswork.
The whole world war outlook is so curious
ly involved and unsettled that it is hard
telling which one of a dozen points these
snips are liable to be needed most at when
spring opens. The opinions to whicti I
am disposed to attach the most importance .
look for them to turn up in Chinese
waters, but these may be quite wrong.
Six weeks ago, of course, such an ex
pectation would have been referred by
everybody to the Levantine trouble; now
the impression that England has drawn
neck and crop out of that particular im
broglio is so general that nobody thinks of
suggesting that this squadron may be for
use there. This impression is greatly
strengthened by the withdrawal of the
British Mediterranean tleet from Salonica.
One division 13 corning back to Malta, the
other is going down for police duty in the
vicinity of the Aleppo. But it is well to
remember that John Bull is not incapable
on occasion of a certain amount of guile,
and it may easily be that his ostensible
abandonment of the Armenians to their
fate is designed to throw others off their
guard while he prepares to interfere more
vigorously than 2ver.
The celebration of the twenty-fifth anni
versary of the foundation of the German
empire to-iiay was purely an affair of
princes and generals. The public has
been offered no part in it, no newspaper
men have been admitted to witness any
phase to the court festivities, and even the
ordinary stand for spectators, always here
tofore permitted in front of the opera
house, to witness the review of troops, was
to-day forbidden. Nothing could better
illustrate the despotism that the imperial
government has made during the past
year or the width of the gulf now sepa
rating it from popular sympathy and in
terest. It is true that a large number of
victims of the recent Oriental enforcement
of the lese majeste laws have received im
perial clemency in an effort to get the peo
ple to think that they are associated with
the anniversary, but the act has been
coldly received.
The fact that the Socialist organ, the
Vorwaerts, when able yesterday to print
the decree which the Kaiser was religiously
saving up as to-day's surprise is by far the
most significant of a long series of proofs
that the administration is filled with men
who secretly sympath ize with the Social
Democrats and are willing to run terrible
risks to provide them with the most confi
dential secrets of tne various ministers.
It used to be suspected that the printers
did this and thorough precautions were
taken to render that impossible, but the
menacing leak goes on just the same.
It is not unlikely that the Authors' Soci
ety will go to pieces in the course of the
furious impending tight over the celebrated
address to American brethren. One gath

and Besant and Conway approved ; but it
seems that the committee or council of the
society was not consulted, and every un
known hack writer in the land who has
been able to buy a Hall merk of literary
genius for his or her guinea subscription
is aching to come up to London for a gen
eral meeting and make a fuss about it.
Christina Rossetti's hitherto unknown
poems, published to-day, are much larger
in bulk and more important than had
been supposed. The volume of nearly 400
pages contains much which her devotees
treasure as equal to her best, and some few
things which will probably win her new
admirers.
Henry Arthur Jones' ambitious "Michael

The innate deviltry of the female part
Mrs. Patrick Campbell might have made
wonders of if she had gone on with it is
quite bej'ond the grasp of the other, whose

the improbability of the story is forced on
the spectator's mind throughout. There
appears to be much feeling in some cleri
cal circles about the propriety of the church
scene, but this hardly likei}' to damage the
box receipts, which are said to be very
promising.
As a corollary of the recent debate about
abuses of the judicial machinery here ana
the decline of litigation from dread of its
increasing costly processes, it is noted that
only fifty-one students are to be called to
the bar this term from all the four inns of
court, whereas for many years past the
annual number has been close on a hun-
dred. Tliis discouragement of barristers
is matched by the despondency among
solicitors, who find that courts are dis
posed to exert much more vigilance in
watching their practices and take a hostile
view of their little games, which formerly
was undreamed of. Twice this week a
judge, when asked to adjourn a case be
cause the solicitor in charge was engaged
on another case elsewhere, ordered that
the solicitor himself should bear the ex
pense of the delay, and the mere thought
of this becoming a general precedent fills
all attorneys with dismay.
Emperor William, unwarned by experi
ence with Koch's tuberculosis fantasy,
had Professor Roentgen to rush from
Wurzburg to Potsdam to give an illus
trated lecture to the royal family i,n Ins
alleged discovery of how to photograph the
invisible, and bestowed on him the order
of the crown, the same second-class decora
tion that poor Koch got, tut it is already
found that this discovery was not only
made by a Prague professor in 1885, who
got an admirable photograph of Mount
Wane at midnight by the use of cathodic
rays, but a full report of the achievement
was made to the Austrian Academy of Sci
ences in 1885.
An announcement was made to-day
which threatens to knock the whole un

Professor Morris Jones, who, next to
Rhys, is the 'most weighty authority on
Cymric literature, publishes the fact that
he has become convinced that the whole
institution of Gorsedd, which purports to
maintain an unbroken tradition of cere
monial ritual even to vestments from
Druidic times, is a gigantic and deliberate
imposture perpetrated in the sixteenth
century by Glamorganshire bards in order
to justify their provincial revolt against
the then National Eisteddfod.
Henry Somerset, son of Lady Henry

is to be married Thursday to the daughter
of the Duke of St. Albans, and the event
will be marked by a public welcome of the
young couple in the market place of
Reigate, where an address is to be pre
sented. Such ceremonies are common
still in more feudal rural parts, but is a
rare occurrence in a large, almost subur
ban town like Reigate.

Olney.
PRISONERS AT PRETORIA
The State Department Will See
That the Accused Men Are
Tried Fairly.
COAST SENATORS INTERESTED.
Consular Representatives Instructed to
Watch the Cases of Hammond
and Others.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 18.â No tele
gram has been received from President
Cleveland from Governor Budd of Cali
fornia, but Senator White to-day trans
mitted to Secretary Olney a telegram that
he received from the Governor late last
night, requesting that every effort be used
to protect Californians now incarcerated
at Pretoria.
Senator Dubois of Idaho and Represen
tative Catchings of Mississippi also called
on Secretary Olney to-day. Dubois went
in behalf of V. H. Clement, formerly of
Idaho, and Representative Catchings is in
terested in the welfare of John Hays Ham
mond and wife. Mrs. Hammond was a
Miss Harris of Mississippi, and her rela
tives and friends there are alarmed for the
safety of Hammond and his wife. They
have written and wired Catchings to exert
every influence at the State Department.
Senator Dubois said to The Call corre
spondent to-nieht:
"Mr. Catchings and I saw Secretary
Olney at noon to-day. He assured us that
everything had been done that could be
to insure the protection of all Americans
arrested. Of course he could not give us
any assurance that they would not be pun-
ished if found guilty of aiding, abetting or
participating in a conspiracy or rebellion.
The most he can do is to see that the
prisoners are not maltreated during their
incarceration and that they are given a
fair trial.
"1 do not believe that, if found guilty,
they will be severely punished. They may
be fined, but the possibility of a worse
punishment is a very remote possibility.
1 am satisfied the State Department has
done and is doing everything in its power.
They have cabled our consular representa
tives at Johannesburg and Cape Town,
and both have acknowledged receipt of
these cable's instruction, but as yet have
sent nothing definite in the shape of news.
I am particularly interested in the case of
V. H. Clement, who was one of our promi
nent Idaho citizens, being interested in
the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines, two
of the biggest and best mining properties
in our Staie."
Senator White said:
"There is absolutely nothing now to be
said. The department has cabled its con
sular agents, and is waiting for more ex
tended reports from them. I transmitted
Governor Budd's telegram to Secretary
Olney to-day, Perkins and I are taking
an active interest in the welfare of the
I'a'.ifornians arrested, and we are con
fident that Mr. Olney will do all that he
can."
It has been reported here that Secretary
Olney was much vexed because he did not
hear from Consular Agent Manion at
Johannesburg, and Consul Knight at Cape
Town, and that he had reprimanded the
former and was contemplating sending
Knight to Pretoria. These reports are
erroneous. Olney has heard from the Con
suls, who briefly acknowledged the receipt
of the cablegrams. The cable tolls are so
high that Secretary Olney does not expect
or wish to hear full reports by wire, having
every coniidence that the American and
British Consuls will jointly do everything
possible for the imprisoned men of both
countries.
CONFISCATION Of PROPERTY.
The Jtorr Government May Make a Rich
Maul.
LONDON. England, Jan. 18.â Experts
in the law of the South African republic
concur in the belief that if the penalties
for treason are enforced in full the Boer
Government will make a rich haul through
the confiscation of property of those who
are convicted of that crime. Among
those arrested is Lionel Phillips, who :s
the registered holder of Rand shares to
the amount of Â£1,250,000. Calculations
based on the knowledge of the prop
erty of thp other prisoners show
that the total money value of the
property liable to confiscation is Â£14,000,
--000. The clemency shown by the Boers to
Dr. Jameson and the other raiders is sus
pected to cover their intention to keep
their grip on the better spoil.
The fortune of Cecil Rhodes, the ex-
Prime Minister of Cape Colony, is esti
mated at Â£7,000,000. Besides coming to
England to defend the interests of the
British South Africa Company, in which
he is the ruling spirit, and of Dr. Jame
son, Rhodes is concerned in a project for
the purchase from Portugal of Delagoa
Bay, East Africa, by an English syndicate.
Portugal will be tempted by an offer of
Â£12,000,000. In the meantime the hand of
the British Government, which cannot
now be seen in the deal, will be disclosed
if Portugal consents to dispose of the ter
ritory in question.
TItA.ysrA.AI, POPULATION.
The Boer* Are in rower, out in the
minority.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Berlin
says: To supplement the information tele
graphed Thursday, on the authority of
Winterfeld, Consul-General of the Trans
vaal in this city, Dr. Leyds gives the fol
lowing statistics of the relative proportions
of the Boer and the Uitlander population
in the Transvaal :
The Transvaal Secretary of State says:
"An official dispatch just received from
Pretoria tells me that the figures at the
last election â in 1891 â record 14,971 valid
votes out of a total voting register of 21,
--237. Burghers who have a lull franchise
number 22,628.
"Of the total number of white inhabi
tants of the Transvaal 75,720 are Uitland
ers. Of these 41,445 are British subjects
and 34,445 are other foreigners and 439 are
Americans. The number of Boer com
batants is placed at 25,457, all mounted
and well armed.
"The Transvaal Government will bestow
the franchise upon all Uitlanders who have
remained loyal to the Government in the
case of the last Kaffir war. Cecil Rhodes
is well aware of the electoral statistics and
deliberately lied in giving numbers at
variance with the above."
Dr. Leyds underwent an operation by
Dr. Fraenccl on Thursday.

Career of J. 8. Cttrtig, the Arreited Min

SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. 18.â J. S.
Curtis, the mining engineer under arrest
in Johannesburg, South Africa, is well
known in this city. Mr. Curtis married
Miss Rose Behmer of this city several
years ago and left here to accept a posi
tion as a raining engineer with a wealthy'
German syndicate in South Africa.
After serving the syndicate for several
years Mr. Curtis resigned to engage in
mining upon his own account and soon
accumulated a fortune. As he is a gradu
ate of a German university and has always
favored German institutions, his relatives
here are at a loss to account for his arrest
and imprisonment by the Boers, but at
tribute it to his well-known friendship for
John Hays Hammond. In a recent letter
to a brother-in-law here Mr. Curtis said
that he intended returning to this country
soon, but said nothing of any political
trouble in the Transvaal.

LO>DON, Ens., Jan. 18. â The law
papers here adduce the treatment accorded
the prisoners taken during the Fenian
raid into Canada as a precedent for the
treatment of Dr. Jameson and his com
panions in the Transvaal raid. They say
that the prisoners ought to be tried by the
ordinary courts of England. As no in
demnity was demanded from the United
States because of the Fenian raid so no
indemnity should be paid to the Trans
vaal.
CONFESSED WHILE DYING.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 18.â George F.
Murphy, late cashier of the Citizens' Bank
of St. Louis, died last Saturday night.
A morning paper will make the state
ment to-morrow that Mr. Murphy, a few
hours before his death, called to his bed
side J. B. C. Lucas, president ol the bank,
and announced himself a defaulter, and
turned over insurance polices on his life
for $10,000 in restitution.
An attorney for President Lucas, it is

CRUISE OF THE FLEET.

THE SIGNIFICANT STEPS TAKEN*
Vessels of the United States Navy-
Being Made Ready for a Counter
Demonstration.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. IS.-No offi
cial information has been received by the
"Washington Government of the report
that the British flying squadron is destined
for Mediterranean waters. This much
and no more is given out from otlicial
sources.
The first intimation that the possible
destination of the fleet might be the West
Indies came more than a week ago in tha
shape of information that the BritL-h,
were placing large supplies and other
stores in their fortified naval station at St.
Lucia, near the Venezuelan coast, as men*
tioned in The United Press dispatches at
the time.
While the Naval Department seemingly
paid little attention to the story, it is sig
nificant that steps were taken about tnÂ©
same time by the department to ascertain
how quickly the coast defense monitors
Miantonomah, Terror and Monadnock
could be made ready for service. This
was followed by orders directing that
these vessels be fitted for being placed
in commission without delay. It is ex
pected that the last of them, the uniinished
Terror, will be equipped in about two
months.
There i 3 some talk around the Navy De
partment of the necessity for calling back
to America the commerce, destroyer Min
neapolis and the cruiser San Francisco,
leavine the cruiser Marblehead to attend
to the interests of American missionaries
in the Sultan's possessions. Nothing otii
cial in this matter can be obtained.
Meanwhiie tL e North Atlantic squadron

The squadron is growing to quite a form Li

York, Columbia, Raleigh and Maine, may
be said to contain the battleship Indiana,
which, while not formally attached to it,
is lying in Hampton Roads, and the bat
tle ship Teias, which will be repaired at
Norfolk without delay if it be in the power
of the repairers to set that unlucky ship
on its sea legs.

this city. The rumor that the ships had
been ordered to Bermuda is lauehed at by
naval officials, who say that there has
never been any intention to make such a

the Atlantic. It is hinted that the flying
squadron will be heard of in Delagoa Bay
before it will in the Bermudas. It is

WHEELING,W.VA.,Jan.IB.â TheNewa
to-morrow will contain an interesting in
tr with Lotus Springer Delaplain of
this city, ex-Consul to Demerara, who dis
cussed recent phases of tho Venezuelan
controversy. Mr. Delapliiin says in part:
"The removal of Sir Charles Cameron

inch in their position. I knew Mr. Lees
while in Demerara. Personally he is an
exedient man of good address and pop

the tastes of the home government.
"When Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary
of the British Colonial Office, ordered him
to purchase Maxim L";ns for the defense
of the frontier Mr. Lees refused to put the
question before the court of policy and

"It is Viscount Gordonston who ad

CHOICE OF THE POPULISTS.
Bryan of Nebraska Alleged to Have a
Better Chance Than Lyman
Trumbull.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18.â The gen
eral opinion of prominent men at New York
hotels last night was that the selection of
Chicago as the place for holding the Demo
cratic National Convention was the out
come of a "Stevenson deal," and meant
the nomination of Vice-President Adlai
E. Stevenson to head the Democratic
National ticket. George W. Ruddlestone,
a Chicago man, who is â well posted on
Illinois politics, said that the quiet Demo
cratic sentiment of Illinois was for Steven
son, and if the force of local sentiment
could dominate the convention, it would
be solid for the Yice-President.
"Governor Matthews," said Mr. Huddle
stone, "will have the Indiana delegates
and some from Ohio and Michigan, and
may develop Eastern strength. I notice
there is talk about the Populists nomi
nating ex-Senator Lyman Trumbull as
their Presidential candidate. This is all
rot. Bryan of Nebraska will come nearer
being the Populist-Free Silver nominee
than any one that has been mentioned up
to date, no matter whether the convention
is held in St. LouL<, Denver or Key West."
Members of the ill-fated "Gentleman
Joe' Company are clamoring for their
salaries. There have been some lively
times at the Fifth-avenue Theater during
the week and at one time it looked as>
though a pitched battle would ensue.
There have been rumors tnat money
would not be ready on the regular salary
day â Tuesday. A notice was posted on
the callboard Wednesday night requesting
the members of the company to meet the
following evening, when it was understood
the money would be forthcoming.
Mrs. M. B. Curtis then announced that
all claims must be presented to Moses X
Kellam, who, she said, was the financial
backer of the company, and showed a doc
ument in support of her assertion. Then
she produced a blank form of demand
upon Kellam for salaries, which she re
quested all members of the company to
sign. Only a few did so, the rest resorting
to exclamations of rage and various
threats. The uproar grew so that the
stage hands twice turned out the lights in
order to force an adjournment.
Stage Manager WiL'ard Lee yesterday
had an attachment served on Kellam's
place of business. Others have begun
suits against him, while a majority are
waiting to see how the affair is going to
end. Many refuse to recognize Kellam
in the matter at all and say they will be

The fact remains that whether justly or
unjustly Curtis and his wife are coming
in for a large share of denunciation.

says that just before the rise of the cur

Naval Cadet," at the opera-house last
night, Joseph Corbett, brother of tue
pugilist, received a letter which made him
$500 richer.
An Irish servant, Mary Green, had al
ways been a member of the family. She
received no compensation, for she would
take none, but often members of the family
would make Ler presents of money. She
was 90 years old when she died Tuesday
afternoon. In the letter received by Cor
bett his sister stated that the old servant
had left $12,000, which she had accumu
lated.
She remembered Joe Corbett by leaving
him $500, and in the letter the old lady is
quoted as saying: "I did not leave Jim
any money because I thought he would be
insulted."
It has been hinted among the tarfmen
for the last month or more that there was
likely to be a change in the board of racing
stewards this year. That such a change is
more than probable now seems to be as
sured. The retiring steward is Judge
Joseph G. Burke, who is now officiatinff as
presiding judge at the Ingleside meeting,
San Francisco.
Judge Burke had no permanent arrange
ments with the Eastern racing associations
last year, although it was rather expected
that he would be a fixture in the stewards'
stand. He was offered the post of steward
for the Coney Island Jockey Club at the
Sheepshead Bay spring meeting and came
on from St. Louis to accept the position.
After the Sheepshead Bay meeting he was
appointed jockey club steward at Brighton
and Aqueduct. He served also at the
Brooklyn and Sheepshead Bay fall meet
ing, but left for the West before the Morris
Park fall meeting began. His family sub
sequently removed to California, which
would indicate that he expects to make
his home for the future in that section.

ARMOR-PLATE CHARGES
An Investigation Commenced by
the Senate Naval Affairs
Committee.
Secretary Herbert Explains How
American Firms Compete With
Foreigners.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 18.â The
Senate Committee on Naval Affairs was in
secret session to-day for a little more than
three hours on the investigation suggested
by the Chandler resolution relative to the
question of excessive charges for armor
plate, the connection of certain naval of
ficers in the patents granted for processes
used by the Navy Department and other
matters cited in Mr. Chandler's resolution.
Secretary Herbert was before the com
mittee for two hours, but nothing was
developed going to show that there had
been any dereliction of duty. No new
armor contracts have been entered into
during the present administration. Mr.
Herbert said it had been the babitof naval
officers when they secured patents upon
thines used by the navy to permit the use
of such patents by the Government with
out charsre. It was not infrequent, he also
said, for the Navy Department to ask for
prompt action in the matter of patents on
such appliances as were used by the de
partment; this was not confined to any
particular administration, but had been
done through several administrations.
Secretary Herbert said that the first
summer after he became the head of the
Navy Department he broke up the practice
that had grown up of allowing long leaves
with permission to naval officers to accept
private employment.
So far as the contract of the armor-plate
establishments with foreign Governments
was concerned the secretary said that he
knew that the American firms had com
peted with foreign establishments where
the bidding was exceedingly close, and
they had been compelled to bid almost at
losing figures in order to secure any of the
contracts. It was charged that these firms
had furnished armor abroad at $300 per
ton that has cost this Government be
tween $500 and $000.
Another special meeting will be held
next Saturday, at which time Commodore
Folger will be a witness. Lieutenant
Ackerman, who is now stationed on the
Pacific Coast, will not be called home for
tho purpose of appearing before the com
mittee. The hearing to-day was behind
closed doors, but tiie testimony and the
findings of the committee will ultimately
be made public.

OMAHA, Nebb., Jan. 13.â The fall in

the thermometer during that time falling

was a record breaker, but reports so far
received do not give any serious losses of
stock on the ranges.

ANDREW D. WHITE'S ADDRESS.
Declared That the Diplomatic Service
Was a Cheap Defense of
the Nation.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Jan. 12.â The
twenty-third annual banquet of the New
York Board of Trade and Transportation
was held to-day at the Hotel Savoy. More
than 200 guests sat down to dinner. Ex-
Congressman Darwin R. James, the presi
dent of the board, presided. At his right
sat the Hon. Adlai E. Stevenson, "Vice-
President of the United States, and on his
left waÂ« the Hon. J. Sterling Morton.
The others at the President's table were
the Hon. Andrew D. White, ex-Minister to
Russia ana United States Venezuelan com
missioner, Congressman Richard C. Shan
non of New York, Hon. William Dudley
Foulke of Richmond, Ind., Mayor Strong,
Hon. Frederick W. Wurster and Hon.
Murat Halstead.
The banquet hall was beautifully deco
rated with flowers and plants. On the
principal table was a model of the Ameri
can line steamship St. Louis and a model
of a locomotive. Among those present
were: Sheppard Knapp, Oscar S. Strauss,
Louis Stern, F. B. Thurber, Simon Steine,
Samuel McMillan, Rastus S. Ransom,
General Benjamin Flagler, Captain H. D.
Borus, U. S. A., and General G. D. Bryant.
When the cloth was removed President
James arose and spoke in part as follows:
"I desire to turn thoughts for a few
minutes to the spectacle which our great
Nation of 70,000,000 of our people is pre
senting to ourselves and the commer
cial world beyond the seas.
"For the third time in about two years
she is offering her bonds for gold in order to
maintain the reserve required by law, and
which reserve will doubtless soon melt
away, requiring another sale and still an
other, unless, perchance Congress steps in
with some remedy, the prospect of which,
I regret to say, is not favorable.
"In conclusion let me say that in my
judgment the postponement of the era of
prosperity is commensurate with legisla
tion that â¢will take the Nation out of the
banking business, with an income suffi
cient to meet her obligations and a return
to the system of gold revenue for duties on
imported merchandise."
The chairman next introduced Hon.
Andrew D. White, who responded to the
toast, "Commerce and diplomacy." After
showing how zealously the American Min
isters have kept guard over the interests of
American commerce and manufactures in
the Government to which they are accred
ited, Mr. White said:
"But objection is sometimes made to a
regular diplomatic service on the ground
of its cost. 1 tbink you will see in a mo
ment that the diplomatic service may well
be called the 'cheap defense of nations.'
The entire appropriation for the diplo
matic service for the Jast fiscal year was a
trifle over $500,000, bui the cost of miiitary
and naval operations during our Civil
War for each day was to the United States
about $3,000,000. The cost of r'tary
operations during tbe late Fran , ;:s
--sian war, if divided equally between the
two nations, would have amounted each
day to considerably more than $;5,000,C00.
"It is altogether probable that Charles
Francis Adams, by his timely remon
strance with Earl Russell, prevented a
prolongation of our Civil War, which
would have cost us more than the entire
diplomatic service during hundreds of
years.
"But you will ask, How shall our pres
ent system be improved? As I said before,
what is needed is 'not revolution but evo
lution. 1 Our present system is far better
than it once was; and let me say here
that sundry expressions which some of
our pessimists have put forth regarding it
do our country threat wrong.
"Speaking with entire deliberation and
knowing that 1 am well within the facts of
the case, I assert that no other country
has bsen so steadily represented in Great
Britain by such a series of distinguished
and capable citizens as has our own Gov
ernment, beginning with John Adams
and including the honored gentleman
who at present holds the position of Em
bassador to the court of St. James. With
occasional exceptions, the same thing may
be justly said of several others among our
legations at leading capitals in Europe."
Vice-President Stevenson was intro
duced to the meeting. There were loud
calls for a speech, but the Vice-President
simply bowed his head in response to the
calls.
Mayor Strong then spoke briefly on the
power of the Board of Trade and similar
organizations throughout the country.
Congressman Richard Shannon of New
York was the next speaker. He responded
to the toast of "Latin America."
Dr. William Pepper of Philadelphia
spoke on "The University of the United
States," and ex-Congressman William
Dudley Foulke of Indiana spoke of the
relations of "Civil Service Reform and
Commerce" in an effective address.
Mayor Wurster concluded the festivities
with a short speech on "Brooklyn."
A USTAIX3 XB.E JiEEENDJEB.
But the Report Lrta Z,ord Dunraven
Down Quite Easily.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18.â The Even
ing Sun says: "It can be stated with pos
itiveness this afternoon that the decision
of the committee appointed by the N#w
York Yacht Club to investigate the
charges of unfairness brought by Lord
Dunraven against the crew of the De
fender is in favor of the Defender's men.
The charges were found to be unproved.
The committee, however, finds that Lord
Dunraven had grounds upon which to
base his suspicions, and thus relieves him
from the suspicion that he brought the
accusations in malice. In fact, the report
lets Lord Dunraven down easily, although
it found the charges not proved. This
much was learned from a member of the
club this afternoon. It is expected that the
report will be made public the latter part
of next week."
XHKY WELCOME/* McKISLEY.
Ohio Citizens Gave the Governor a Movie
Reception.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. IS.â Drizzling rain
did not interfere with the demonstration
and welcome-home reception in honor of
ex-Goverr.or McKinley and wife, planned
by citizens irrespective of party. At 7
o'clock militia companies, citizens and
bands assembled in front of the City Hall
and the public square. The parade
marched to Governor McKinley's resi
dence, whence the hero of the hour
was escorted to the courthouse, before
which thousands of people stood in the
rain to witness the demonstration aud
listen to the speechmaking, which, con
tinued until a late hour.
The address of welcome was made by
Judge George E. Baldwin. He said while
the citizens of Canton were glad to have
Mr. McKinley back the voice of the people
would soon call upon him to fill a still
higher place.
Governor McKinley, in replying, said he
would indeed be ungrateful if he did not
appreciate the gorgeous welcome, consid
ering the inclement night, but made no
reference to the presidency.

the proDOsition was rejected because the

EDITOR DANA HONORED.
Distinguished Men Give a Dinner
to the Veteran Jour
nalist.
This Country, He Says, Is the Hope of
the World and Liberty Will
Be Defended.
NEW YORK, S. V., Jan. 18.â Not even
the Lotus Club, famed as it is for its hos
pitality, has ever had within ils walls a
more distinguished gathering of men
than those gathered about its dining
board to-night to do honor to Charles A.
Dana, the veteran editor of the Sun, to
whom the Lotus Club was giving a dinner.
There were lawyers, bankers, merchants,
men prominent in affairs of the State and
Nation and leaders in every walk of life.
There were a host of speakers, but no
set toasts or responses. President Law
rence delivered a short address, in the
course of which he Baid:
"In greeting our guest this evening we
have the typical American journalist â the
representative of a class as potent as any
perhaps in our modern civilization, more
potent tnan any other in molding human
affairs. The press of to-day does not
merely report the news, but often antici
pates it.
"And among the great journals of this
metropolis there is none more distin
guished than that great newspaper whose
briil ; int and successful management for
so rnai.y years has caused our guest of thi3
evening to be regarded among his contem
poraries as a great master of his craft.
"In welcoming Mr. Dana to-night we
welcome the journalist and the man. In
public the sturdy disputant, the holder of
a keen and powerful pen, the grave
philosopher; in private life we greet him
as always the genial and courtly gentle
man."
There was a full live minutes of applause
and cheering when Mr. Dana arose after
his introduction by the President. There
wa9 a tremor in his voice as he began
speaking. He said:
"The heart that would not be deeply
affected by such a welcome as this must
be made of harder material than any I
know of. It is an unusual and undeserved
compliment. Ido not take it so much to
myself as an individual, but as conclusive
of the real I. mericen spirit that lives in
this club."
Mr. Dana said that this country was the
hope of the world, and that the one idea
embodied in the stars and stripes was that
of a nation where liberty should be de
fended with the last drop of blood in our
veins. We were citizens of a country, he
said, that knew no rival and feared no foe.
"We seem to stand at a most interesting
crisis," said Mr. Dana. "And our fall
would mean more to the world at large
than to the individual American."
Colonel John R. Fellows, Chauncey M.
Depew, Robert Bonner, General Horace
Porter, Elihu Root, William McElroy,,
Robert Bridges and Arthur F. Bowers also
delivered addresses eulogistic of Mr. Dana.

DEATH OF A NOTED
FRENCH STATESMAN.
Close of the Active Career
of M. Charles Thomas
Floquet.
HELD PLACES OF TRUST.
Minister of the Interior and
President of the Chamber
of Deputies.
FIGURED IN THE COMMUNE.
Most Sensational of His Acts Was
the Defeat of General Boulanger
in a Duel.
PARIS, France, Jan. 18.â M. Charles
Floquet, formerly president of the Coun
cil of Ministers, Minister of the Interior
and President of the Chamber of Depu
ties, died at noon to-day.
Charles Thomas Floquet was born at
Saint Jean-de-Luz, October 5, 1828. He
studied at the College St. Louis and was
called to the bar in 1851, and subsequently
engaged in a number of political cases.
When Prince Pierre Bonaparte was tried
at Tours for the murder of Victor Noir,
M. Floquet pleaded successfully for dam
ages on behalf of the family of the vic
tim ; and he was also successful in obtain
ing the acquittal of M. CournC:, who was
tried at Blois in 1870, for participation in a
plot against the Government.
February, 1871, M. Floquet was elected
representative of the Seine in the National
Assembly, but soon resigned his seat, the
reactionary press accusing him of having
relations with the Commune and oi being
its agent in the provinces during the
second siege, a charge which was formally
contradicted by him in the Gaulois. The
Government, however, arrested him at
Biarritz and he was confined at Pau until
the end of June, 1871. In April of the
following year he was elected to the Mu
nicipal Council and again in 1874. In the
Senatorial elections of January, 1878, he
was an unsuccessful candidate, but ob
tained a seat in the second chamber in
February. After the act of the 16th
of May, 1877, he was one of the 363
Deputies who refused a vote of confidence
in the ministry of M. de BroeHe and was
re-elected in the October following.
M. Floquet, who possessed great talent
as an orator, took an important part in the
debates of the new session. At a public
meeting held in Havre in 1880 M. Flo
quet made an energetic speech in favor of
the separation of church and state, as also
for the suppression of the Senate. In 1881
he was elected Vice-President of the.
Chamber. On his nomination as Prefect
of the Seine in 1872 he was obliged to re
sign his seat, but was shortly re-entered to
the Chamber as member of Perpignan,
having, on account of grave differences be
tween him and the Government, sent in
his resignation as Prefect. He was the
principal author of the proposition for ex
pulsion of all the members belonging to
the royal families which had reignea in
France and for depriving them of all polit
ical rights.
In January, 1883, urgency for this prop
osition was carried in the Chamber by a
large majority, but the matter went no
farther at tne time.
On the fall of M. Ferry from power and
the accession of M. Brisson, M. Floquet
was chosen to succeed the latter as presi
dent of the Chamber, a post which he held
with dignity.
At one time he was one of the editors of
the Temps and the Siecle.
He, being supposed to have cried to the
Emperor of Russia, Alexander 11. when a
guest of Emperor Napoleon 111, I- Vive
la Pologne, monsieur!" was in the "black
books" of Russia till 1888, when a formal
reconciliation took place.
In July of that year he fought a duel
with General Boulanger, severely wound
ing him in tne throat with his sword,
greatly to the general's disgust, who, being
an officer, ought to have been a more ex
pert swordsman than a civilian could be
expected to be.

WILL RE-ENTER THE Rl*G
Corbett to Give Critic* a Chance to Mmk4
Good Xheir Bluff*.
NEW YORK, X. V., Jan. 18.â James J.
Corbett has decided to re-enter the prize
ring and defend the title of champion of
America against all comers. The winner
of the Maiier-Fitzsimmons fight, to be de
cided in Texas next month, will be giv-n
the preference by the Californian.
Corbett's change of base is due to a re
cent interview with Peter Maher, in which
the Irish pugilist is quoted as saying that
if he defeated Fitzsimmons he would force
Corbett to meet him. At New Brunswick,
>'. J., last night, Corbett admitted that he
hÃd made up his mind to fight again. He
said :
"When I turned over the championship
to Maher I intended never to fight again,
but in view of the recent events I have
decided to re-enter the ring. Since I re
tired a good many would-be champions
have been making a lot of talk about fight
ing me. Well, I am in the ring again,
and I'll cive them all a chance to make
good their bluffs."

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 18.â A dense

effecting a very satisfactory saturation of
the soil. At times the precipitation would
develop into a little shower, but generally
it has been slow and steady, and every

a carefully prepared statement and a
dignified and pacific document. B<
the members of the Bundesratti, most of

ent with the exception of the Socialists
and Freisinnige. There were also {'resent
I<>4 members of the N<>r.h German Reich-
Btag of 1870 and ail of the high court and
Government officials.
The Emperor, in speaking from the
throne in the White Hail., expressed his
heartfelt thanks for t tie benefits the last
quarter of a century had conferred upon
the empire, recalled the memories of the
period whÂ» .>d into existence the
empire, and vowed to continue the work
which his eran'ifather had begun. His

made a short speed;, in which he dwelt
the events that have led to the
foundation of the empire. The wonderful
development of the empire, he said, was
now respected, if not loved, by the council
of the nations. Such a commanding posi
tion had brought duties in addition to

position in Europe siie must be armed so
as to be able to support her voice on sea

After the dinner the Emperor and Em

Dr. Mereasky, who for many years has
been a missionary in the Transvaal, was
cheered to the echo when he said that
Germany was filled with joy at the victory
of the Boers, and that the people sup
ported the Emperor and the Government
in backing up the Transvaal republic. He
hoped for everything that was ben<

MILL V ALL EX COUXIKY CLVR.
Denial of the Humor That It la Finan

MILL VALLEY, Cm.., Jan. There
is absolutely no truth in the reports being
circulated to the effect that the Mill Val
ley Country Club is financially embar
rassed and that Secretary Janes has been
compelled to pay a number of the club's
bills out of bis own pocket. In fact, there
is a provision in the constitution and by
laws of the club which limits the amount
of liabilities to the assets. The club is
composed of Mill Valley's leading citizens,
and. it is not probable that they would al
low any honorable debts to remain un
paid.
Vice-President Arthur A. Martin was
seen by a Call representative, and said
positively that the club was not in debt.
The club, though not in debt, has very
little to its credit, as all funds available
have been used to improve the club
groundsâ build a rifle-target butt and Run
bouse, lay out baseball and cricket fields
and build a concrete cricket-pitch. The
next season of the club will open in a
couple of months, when it is hoped, by
various means, to obtain money sufficient
to erect a good, substantial clubhouse.

Don M. Dickinson Delivers
a Stirring Address in
Detroit.
LIBERTY IS DEMANDED.
Natives of the Troubled Island
Making a Fight for
Freedom.
ENGLAND MAY TAKE A HAND.
Could Block Ports and Force Collection
of the Loans to the
Spanish.
DETROIT, Mich., Jan. IP.â Hon. Don.
M. Dickinson delivered an address on
"Cuba" before the Detroit Manufacturers'
Club at the Chamber of Commerce Hall
to-night. The audience was a represent
ative gathering of business men of the
city.
Mr. Dickinson'? remarks were received
with wild enthusiasm. He said if there
ever was a cause that appeals to the heart
and soul of every liberty-loving man,
woman and child, that cause was Cuba's.
The time has come for every manufactur
ing concern to take up the Cuban question
and press it on Congress as a matter of
business. Complications may arise at any
time. England, believes that in Cuba is
her only security for the payment of Span
ish loans, and almost any day the English
Meet, in spite of the Monroe doctrine, may
take possession of every Cuban port and
force the collection of tiiis money.
Time has come for action, he declared,
and inaction is a crime against our own
people. He sketched the history of Cuba
and explained the causes which led to the
present revolution. Mr. Dickinson pointed
out the advantages, in a commercial way
which would accrue to the United States
if <'Ã¼ba achieves her independence, and
â¢' Cuba is going to win," he declared.
We were not to be overawed by England's
mobilization of her fleet. Her action
might scare the German Emperor and the
ruler of the Transvaal, but if we had not
a ship or a coast defense she could not
scare us. England ban had her eye on
Cuba since 1840, and he believes that Lord
Salisbury had nothing else in view in the
Venezuelan boundary dispute than to es
tablisn the precedent that the Monroe doc
trine did not obtain, and thus get pos
session of Cuba.
i: solutions were adopted calling: for the
immediate attention and cons idenition on
the part or" Congress to the Cuban ques
tion, declaring that any delay on the part
of our Government in according belligerent
rights is a positive wrong morally and
legally and that it is the duty of the
United States Government to forestall the
action of any other commercial nation in
earning the obligation of the new republic.
CAX'T CROSS THE I>EAIH.IM:.
Attempt* of Gomez to He turn to the
J^antxrnrd.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 18.â It is reported
here that the forces under Gomez have
made a supreme effort to cross the dead
line near Batabano and are now near
Guara and Molena, as they find it very
dangerous to remain in Pinar del Rio, and
are trying to go back eastward.
The prospect of a lack of horses and am
munition scared them; besides, through
the capture of the important leader, Ceperi,
lieutenant to Rego, it has been learned
that Rego was wounded at Mai Ti-mpo
and that there is discord among the insur
gent leaders in Las Villas, and to this is
also attributed the determination of Max
imo Gomez to retreat eastward.
It is said that Gomez is very much dis
satisfied to find that the people in Pinar
del Rio have not aided him, and he finds
himself short of ammunition.
In Las Villas the leader, Koque Rodri
guez, has been killed.
He was Maximo Gomez' most trusted
guide and scout, and one of the most ter
rible of the incendiaries in that district.
The requisitio n of horses in Las Villas is
progressing favorably. Tke Government
has now aoout 2<K)O horses there.
From Spain ten squadrons of cavalry
are expected soon and also 25,000 more
troops during February.
General Marin officially received the of
ficers of the army, navy and prominent
citizens in ttte palace to-day. General
Campos was presejit most of the time. The
change caused less excitement than was
expected.
Merchants, planters, Spanish residents
and others loyal to Spain are satisfied that
effective measures will now be taken. The
Cuban sympathizers with the rebellion
fear the return of the bloody practices of
the last war. Folavieja, the new captain
general, has a record for severity and
Pandoa is similar. Mann is regarded as
human c.
The Ctibans regret the departure of
Campos. His campaign was most humane.
He would not confiscate property and
granted amnesty upon the surrender of
the rebels. He treated snspects leniently,
especially Americans. The retirement of
(Jampos is the result of agitation among
the merchants of the produce exchange.
The Cubans say the removal of Campos,
Spain's ablest general, is a great victory,
and will convince the world that a gen
uine revolution is in progress. They hope
it will aid in obtaining recognition for the
belligerents at Washington.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. 18.â Martinez

tain-General Campos received the corre
spondents of the American newspapers in
a body to-day. His manner was very un
assuming and cordial. The spokesman
for the newspaper correspondents said:
"We have called upon the eve of your
departure to extend our thanks for the
many courtesies shown us since your ar
rival in Cuba. We would be glad to re
ceive a statement concerning Spanish-
Cuban affairs for the people in America."
General Campos in reply said:
"Gentlemen, I am very glad to meet the
correspondents of the American news
papers. I can assure you that you have
nothing to thank me for. I have simply
done my duty. It has always been my
earnest desire to give you every facility
within my power. What has happened
here is not extraordinary.
"I refer to my retirement. I am a man
who, for many years has been very promi
nent in the affairs of my country, aim dur
ing my career as a public officer I have
naturally had occasion to make a few ene
mies, not willfully, but in the natural
course of events. That is the way with
political parties.
"They have tips and downs. During my
more fortunate days my countrymen
crowned me with many honors.
"Now that I have been less successful in
my efforts it is net unnatural that I
should suffer from the consequence of the
reaction.
"Against the present Government I have
not a word to say. In it i have warm
friends whom I love very dearly. lam
not a man of such strong longing to hold
oliice that I leave it with regret. I cer
tainly hope the man who comes after me
may be more fortunate than I.
"In Havana the public is seemingly not
united in my support. I refer to tne
people who are dome the talking. The
views of those who have maintained
silence I of course have no means of know
ing.
"In the last few days there have been
numerous meetings and consultations. I
laid the facts fully before the Government.
They have recalled me. I have known of
rumors of intended demonstrations in an
tagonism of my policy, but I am not the
man to stand such manifestations because
I would dissolve them with shell."
In reply to a question General Campos
said he would sail for Spain on Monday.
General Suarez Valdez has been ap
pointed temporarily second in command
of the Government forces.
MADRID, Spain, Jan. 18. â General
Polavieja, who is mentioned as the prob
ble successor to General Campos, has ad
vised Premier Canovas to appoint General
Wcyler to tiie position of commander-in
chief of the Spanish forces in Cuba. Gen
eral Weyler wiil arrive in Madrid tc-mor
row, and after a consultation with Pre
mier Canovas the latter will announce his
final decision in the mutter.
EXPKMTIOX FOR CUBA.
JSew Torfc Guardsmen Said to lie Among
the Filibusters. â 
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18.â A morn
ing paper say: Reports have been circu
lated for tne last few days that the Cubans
were organizing a filibustering expedition
in Brooklyn to consist partly of members
of the Twenty-third and the Forty-seven
regiments of the New York National
Guard.
Until yesterday these rumors were so
vague that little attention was paid to I
them, but it now appears that the Spanish j
authorities have not only been informed j
on the subject, but have taken action to
thwart the contemplated expedition.
Several men called daring the week at
Cuban headquarters and said they desired
to join the expedition, but recognizing
among them a detective employed by the
Spanifth Consul the applicants were told
that the Junta was not enlisting men and
that if an expedition was being organized
the promoters were acting on their own
responsibility.
While the foregoing facts were made
public yesterday, something occurred in
the private room of the Cuban Legation
that gives considerable color lo the reports
regarding a contemplated expedition. A
Cuban was seated in the room, who was
once a coadjutor of Marti, the father of the
revolution.
He became very indignant that any de
tails should have been given to the press,
and scored the press agent for doing so.
The headquarters of the Junta were
crowded all day yesterday with Cubans
who were excited over the report from
Washington that Secretary Olney was
soon going to submit a plan to Congress to
assist the Cubans in buying the island
from Spain, and failing in that, to practi
cally recognize them as belligerents.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 18.â C. A.
Solomon, the newspaper correspondent
who reached Havana on Sunday last on
the steamer Panama from this port, was a
passenger on the steamship Saratoga,
which arrived here to-day. The report
that Solomon took dispatches to the in

MAN HUNT IN MENDOCINO.
Pursuing Posses Have So Far
Been Eluded by the Calpella
Stage-Robber.
The Fugitive Steals a Horse and Gains
a Lead Over the Men on His
Trail.
URIAH, Cal., Jan. 18.â The pursuit of
the bandit who shot ex-Sheriff Standley
yesterday is still on. Several posses arc
on his track, and his capture is a matter
of a short time. In some manner he made
his escape from the brush patch in which
he was surrounded last night, the heavy
rain and darkness making this possible.
The fugitive was started from his hiding
place last night by two deputies, but pur
suit was impossible. This morning his
track was taken up a short distance north
of Ackerman CreeK and was followed for a
considerable distance southerly toward
this place. The barns on the "Price and
Keed ranches had been entered, but no
horses were found by the robber. A horse
was taken from a barn on Handy's ranch,
below town, and after it had been ridden
for some distance was turned loose. It is
supposed the horse had given out and
aftercutting the bridle-rein to prevent its
entanglement in the brush, the bandit
turned the animal loose. The footprints
in Handy's barnyard correspond to the
track of the fugitive, who in his search
for a horse lost several articles, which tend
to confirm th? suspicions of the officers.
Several posses are in Dursuit and armed
men are scouring the country in every di
rection. Detective Thacker left for" the
south to-day. As the storm has abated
the chase is taken up and with renewed
vigor.
"Doc" Standleyis resting easily to-night.
lindtj Found A'enr Stockton.
STOCKTON, Tat,., Jan. 18.â Two boys,
named Coleman, while hunting last
evening, found the body of a man
about three-quarters of a mile from
Taifon, in a lieid belonging to
11. 13. Thompson. From its appearance
the body had been there about two weeks.
The man did not appear to be of the
tramp order, as he was fairly well dressed
and was apparently about 60 years of a?e.
There were no marks or papers on the
corpse by which it could be identified.
CONNECTS UTAH
AND THE COAST.
Southern California and

Assured.
ARTICLES ARE FILED.
Incorporation of the Company
With a Capital Stock of
$7,500,000.
COMPOSED OF MILLIONAIRES.
A Southern Pacific Official Is In
cluded in the Board of
Directors.
SAX DIEGO, Cai.., Jan. 19.â Word was
received to-day that the articles of incor
poration of the Southern California and
Salt Luke Railroad Company were tiled in
the County Clerk's oth'ce at Los Angeles
yesterday afternoon. The incorporators,
who are also named as directors for the
first year, are J. K. Clark ot Butte, Mont.;
J. M. Metcalf of Omaha, A. B. Hotchkiss
of Los Angeles and William H. Carlson
and D. C. Reed of Han Diego. The articles
state that the purpose of the company is
to build v standard-cauge railroad and
telegraph line from a point near Needles,
Cal., to Milford, Utah, a distance of 2<J5
miles, and to purchase any existing rail
road occupying a part of this route. The
capital stock of the company is fixed at
$7,500,000, of which $1,000,000 has been
subscribed by the incorporators. It is be
lieved that Mayor Carlson is trustee for
this company in the deed conveying the
Nevada Southern Railroad to him.
J. K. Clark is one of three wealthy
brothers of Butte whose mining interests
are extensive in Montana, Utah and Ari
zona.
William A. Clark, his brother, is reputed
to be worth $20,000,000, and spends most of
his time in Paris and London. He owns
the great United Verde copper mine at
Jerome, Ariz., to which he lately built a
railroad from a junction with the Santa
Fe, Prescott and Phoenix at a cost of over
$500,000. So enormous is the freight traffic
over this branch that the road will pay for
itself in a few years through the saving
over the old-ti*ne freighting by team.
S. M. Metcalf is the vice-president and
manager of the Lininger & Metcalf Co. of
Omaha. Its president, G. W. Lininger, is
many times a millionaire and has retired
from active business life, spending most of
his time traveling in Europe. His private
art gallery at Omaha is one of the finest in
the United States. He is interested in
railroads in the vicinity of Omaha, and
was in San Diceo last winter. While here
he looked somewhat into the railroad
situation and spoke of the fviture of this
city in the most enthusiastic terms.
Colonel A. B. Ilotchkiss of L,os Angeles
is the attorney of the Southern Pacific
Company at that city, and it is his con
nection with the new enterprise, as well as
that of Mayor Carlson of this city, that
lends color to the belief that the Southern
Pacific is behind the new corporation.
D. C. Reed is a well-known capitalist of
San Dieeo.
Mayor Carlson was interviewed by a
Call correspondent as soon as the news
became known in this city, but again he
was uncommunicative regarding the pro
ject, thouÃh willing to talk on another
proposition upon which he has worked
with considerable energy.
"What does this new move mean?" he
was asked.
"It means just what the articles of in
corporation say," he responded; "to build
a railroad from Southern California to
Salt Lake, or, at least enough to close the
gap now between those points."
"What do you mean by Southern Cali
forniaâSan Diego?"
"Well, the road will certainly not stop
out on the desert."
"Has the Southern Pacific anything to
do with it?"
"Now," said the Mayor, "I can't tell yon
any more. We have the Nevada Southern
already, and there are only 150 miles to
grade to connect Southern California with
Salt Lake City and save .500 miles over the
present route. Isn't that enough? What
difference does it make who builds it? We
are not asking the people for a cent."
"Has this anything to do with the San
Diego and Phoenix Railroad?"
'â No. It is an entirely independent and
separate combination. I am glad, you
spoke of the San Diego and Phoenix,
though, as there is now a chance to put
the road through if the people of San
Die<ro will take hold of it. I can state
flatfooted that if the people will put up a
guarantee of 4 per cent on $4, 000.000, the
cost of the road to Yuma, the road will be
commenced within sixty days and pushed
to completion as fast as men and money
can do it. To this we would want, of
course, free rights of way and terminal
facilities. lam authorized to say that the
$4,000,000 cash necessary to build this road
is ready just as soon as the people of San
Diego take hold of this thing and make
the guarantee, but the people have got to
move first."
"This is about the same offer as that
made by Mr. Huntington to San Diego
some years ago," observed the correspon
dent. "You are not making it for him
again are you?"
"I decline to say whom I am making it
for," replied Mr. Carlson. "I only say
that the cash is ready."
"They say that the Southern Pacific has
a bond on the Cuyamaca road running
out of San Diego, and can take that roaa
whenever it wants it. Would that be
used as a part of the road from San Diego
to Salt Lake?"
"Now," said the Mayor, "1 don't want
you to ask me any more about the Salt
Lake road. Matters are just forming now,
and there is nothing to mak-. public. "We
are going ahead to build that road, and
beyond that there is nothing to say."
"You do not deny that the Southern Pa
cific has a band on the Cuyaoiaca, do
you?"
"No."

Crvtoe 1* Captain Hall.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 18.â The ship
wrecked sailor who was rescued in a naked,
starving and half-crazed condition at Rosa
lie Bay, 300 miles south of this port, ar
rived on the schooner Ida to-day. He re
sembles Hall of Pasadena in every par
ticular, and despite his vigorous denials it
is believed here that he is Hall and has
attempted for some reason to hide his
identity. He refused at first to talk, but
afterward told a wild tale of the sea, de
scribing in detail how Captain Hall was
drowned, and giving his adventures at the
wr ck of the Claretta and his sufferings at
Kosalie. He gave the name of William
Harvey and said he was a relative of Cap
tain Hall.
The schooner had hardly come to anchor
before Harvey made his way up town and
disappeared. The mining men who puc
\ip money for the expedition on the Clar
etta are iooking for Hall, and this is sup
posed to be the reason for the secrecy and
mystery surrounding the case. The crew
of the Ida could not clear the mystery and
said the man stuck to his story. He was
half crazy when first found, but" his reason
returned after several days of care and
good food.
STAXFOIin'S KBIT HEI'ARTVRJE.
A Musical Training (lass to Be lnÂ»H
tutnl nt I'afn Alto.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
18.â Professor H. Is. Lathrop and Mary
Roberts Smith have arranged with the au
thorities here and with Mr. Pasmore, the
well-known musical instructor and com
poser, for a department in musical train
ing at Stanford. Students will be given
credit for their work in music, which
credit will count toward graduation. The
work will consist of voice training, and a
small fee will be charged those who join
the classes.
Julius Frankenheimer, "96, and H. D.
Bnegs. '96, the gentlemen who managed
and edited the '96 Annual of last year, are
the recipients of deserved praise. " The re
ceipts from their Annual exceeded ex
penditure by $200. and, while the gentle
men were entitled to all the profits, tney
determined to turn this sum over to the
class. The seniors, not to be outdone In
magnanimity, agreed to turn the amount
over to the Hildebrand Library fund, and
this was done.
The affair is unusual all around; first,
in that any profit was made from the
Annual; second, that the managers were
so liberal, and third, that class spirit
should so generously give way to a uni
versity sentiment as to devote its entire
exchequer to a university enterprise.
PROTEST OF NEWCASTLE.
Passage of the Funding Bill
Would Be Disastrous to
the State.
Text of the Resolutions Unanimously
Adopted at the Citizens' Mass-
Meeting.
NEWCASTLE, Tat,., Jan. IS.â Secretary
E. Katzenstein, of the mass-meeting held
on Thursday to protest against the pas
sage by Congress of the funding bill, has
forwarded the resolutions that were
adopted. Against their passage there was
not a dissenting vote, and the fact that
such a large number of citizens responded
to the call for the meeting by the Mayors
of San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton and
Sacramento illustrates the feeling here as
regards the endeavor of the Huntington
company to evade a payment of its in
debtedness to the Government. A. J.
Shelltiammer, editor of the News, was
chairman of the gathering. The resolu
tions follow:
Whxbsab, It appears that the T'nion Pacific
and Central Pacific railroad companies are
making an attempt to pass a bill through tue
Congress ol the united states extending the
time for mying the debt, amounting to nearly
$80,000,000, now due, or about to be
come due from said railroad companies to
the United States; and whereas, we, the citi
zens of Newcastle, believe that the ultimate
effect of such extension would be to compel the
people of the Pacific Coast to pay such debt
and interest through increased rates on
freieht him fares, thus working a great hard
ship on the people of one portion of the coun
try: and whereas, judging by acts of said rail
road companies in the past, we have reason to
believe that although said railroad companies
would collecl such increased freights and
fares, we do not believe they would ever fully
pay such debt due the Government; therefore
be if
lic,<olre<l, That we, the people of Newcastle
in mass-meeting assembled, most sincerely
protest against any further extension of time
to said railroad companies, and ask that the
Government proceed at. once to collect such
debt by assuming all debts of said companies
tbat are secured by prior lien on the property
of said companies, and by taking immediate
possession of same and operating in the inter
ests of the Government.
H. F. Fountain was elected delegate to
represent the citizens of Newcastle at the
convention to be held at Metropolitan
Temple, San Francisco, January 18. The
people of this locality are very enthusi
astic on the subject and will make as hard
a tight as possible against the bill.
DURHAM FARMS FLOOOED.
Southern Pacific Force Saves a
Bridge at the Expense
of Crops.
Debris Dislodged by a Blast, Which
Turns a Volume of Water
Upon the Land.
CHICO, Cat,., Jan. 18.â Farmers in the
vicinity of Durham are enraged at the
action of a force of Southern Pacific em
ployos, which has resulted in incalculable
damage to their growing crops. By a blast
in Butte Creek, to remove debris lodged
against a bridge, an overflow of the levees
was caused, and the fields on a number of
ranches were inundated. In addition to
the probable destruction of crops, build
ings and fences suffered by. the Hood.
The people of Durham were awakened
Thursday night by a series of loud reports,
as though cannon.-ding was in process.
The reports were heard in Chico, and even
at this distance a trembling of the earth
could be distinctly felt. Window-panes
rattled, and the disturbed sleepers thought
tney had been aroused by an earthquake.
It appears that the piers "under the rail
road bridge over Butte Creek are too close
together and will not aliovr of the free
passage of debris carried down by the high
waters. As a consequence, a large lot of
logs and drift gathered under the bridge,
and it is supposed that after the rain last
uight the railroad force which has been
putting in new piles went to the bridge
and with blasts dislodged the debris.
Butte Creek beint; up to the banks, the
immense volume of water and debris
rushed down the creek, breaking over the
levee and inundating the sown lands of
the farmers. There was no livestock at
the time on the lands; if there had been
they would all have been swept down the
creek.
The farmers are all angered at the rail
road company for saving its bridge at the
expense of considerable of their property.
The ioss on the Pratt, the Michels and the
Rice ranches will be quite largeâ to what
extent it is not known at the present writ
ing.
Fatality at Samoa.
EUREKA, C.vl., Jan. 18.â John Bro,
employed In the Vance miil at Samoa
was killed Wednesday morning. Bro was
employed as a helper on the splitter, and
while a large log was being rolled onto
the carriage he reached under the lor for a
cant-hook. While down on his knees the
log roiled over, crushing hia head.
WAR AMONG SAN
JOSE DEMOCRATS
Chairman Gould's Course
Causes a Row in
Camp.
PATRONAGE AT AGNEWS.
Resignations at the Asylum Said
to Have Been Secured by
Duplicity.
PROVIDING FOR A BROTHER,
Stories That Conflict With That Told
by the Stockton Man in an
Interview.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 18.â Tho publica
tion in the Kxaminer of the 17th inst. of a
report from Stockton giving an interview
with Frank Gould, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, concern
ing the reported appointment of hi 3
brother to an office at Agnews Asylum
Gould being a director of the institution,
has occasioned no little cnticism in San
Jose and gives promise of a row in the
Democratic camp. In an interview, Gould
is reported to have said :
My brother has not been appointed to a
position at Agnews, though he is an applicant
for a place of some kind. There will be no
vacancies at the asylum until the first of next
month, when two resignations will take effect,
that of the matron and that, of the medical
director's secretary. Tho appointment in the
latter case lies with the medical director or
superintendent of tne institution, and I would
not presume to dictate in the least as to hia
personal appointments, ami such I concede
the appointment of his secretary must be con
sidered.
Gould's statement does not accord with
the story of the affair as told in San Jose.
This story is that the resignation of the
Medical Director's secretary was requested
by the board at the last meeting, and was
at h'rst refused. Gould then went to the
secretary and promised if he â¢would resign
to see that he was appointed to another
office in the asylum. Under this combina
tion of pressure and proniiss the secretary
resigned, and probably similar tactics were
employed in obtaining the resignation of
the matron.
The resignations were accented by the
board, and it was decided to leave it to
Dr. Hatch to till the vacancies. This plan
to shift the responsibility of the appoint
ments was cleverly devised, but Gould
spoiled it so far as he was concerned be
fore leaving the asylum by going to Dr.
Hatcn, Medical Director, and giving him
instructions to notify Gould's brother to
report at the asylum at an early date, so
that the present secretary could instruct
him in the duties of the oth'ce.
Under the circumstances Gould's state
ment, ''I would not presume to dictate
in the least as to his (the Medical Direct
or's) personal appointments," is peculiar.
The case is all the more interesting as the
secretary whose oflicial head has been thus
summarily chopped off to make a place
for Gould's brother is not only a thoroughly
competent man, but is a life-long Demo
crat, so that Gould cannot even claim that
in removing him he was fulfilling his
pledge to the party.
As the matter stands, Gould has the in
side, but the dismissed official has a host
of friends among local Democrats, in the
order of Native Sons and among business
men generally, and as a result there are
signs and symptoms of war in the Demo
cratic camp.
SJSOWJiOUSJt IS ALASKA..
Frara for the Safety of a Trio of Mail-
Carrier*.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 18.â Late Alaska
papers express grave apprehensions for the
safety of Yukon mail-carriers Jackson,
Healey and Gasch. It is feared that
Healey and Gasch have become impris
oned by snow in Chilcat Pass. If they
should be hemmed in for a fortnight it
would no doubt work great hardship and
suffering, not only upon the men, but
their dogs, which are used in carrying the
mails, as the supply of provisions would
probably give out before that time. Only
under the most favorable conditions has
the trip through Chilcat Pass been at
tempted in winter in the past.

SANTA ROSA'S
WATER FIGHT
Struggle Over a Contract
Continues in the
Courts.
DEPOSITION OF EFFEY.
Ke Answers the Complaint of
Wesley Mock Against
the City.
COLLUSION OF BIDDERS DENIED.
Despite the Litigation the Water
Works System Has Now
Been Completed.
SANTA KOSA, Cal.. Jan. 13.â Somewhat
of a sensation was created here last night by
the publication in an evening paper of
what purported to be the deposition of
Robert Effey, in the case of "VVe sley Mock
vs. The City of Santa Rosa. A large roil
of papers, said to be the deposition of
Effey, was received by the County Clerk
here recently, but as it was tightly sealed,
and could be opened only by an order of
where court, many people are wondering
the information as to the contents of the
documents was obtained.
It will be remembered that there were
three separate efforts made to issue bonds
for the construction of a municipal water
system, the original issue being repealed
by the City Council and the Supreme
Court declaring the second issue void. It
â¢was not generally known here that a third
Issue of bonds had been made until some
time in October last, when the people of
Santa Boss were surprised to learn that
bonds for $165,000 had been 6old and the
contract for the construction of the water
works let for $161,000. This report was
quickly conh'rnied by active work upon the
principal streets being commenced.
Shortly after work had been begun
it became generally known that Robert
Effey, Mayor of Santa Cruz, was the pur
chaser of Hie bonds for $170,500; also that
Mr. Effey was the lowest bidder for the
construction of the water system, but that
he had assigned the contract to Paul B.
Perkins.
On October IG, 1895, suit against the city
was commenced by Wesley Mock, praying
for a decree declaring the contract with
Effey void, asicing that the bonds be re
called from New York and for a final
injunction enjoining the city from letting
any contract until the bonds were regu
larly sold and the money paid into the
treasury. The complaint, which was a
voluminous one, set forth among other
â  that the bidding had not been com
petitive; that the bids of Garratt Â«fc Co. of
$164,500 and that of Effey for Â§101,000 were
the only bids received, and that they were
collusive; that the bids were in the same
handwriting; that A. L. Fish stood ready
and willing to bid as soon as the
money was in the treasury, and
that Fish was willing to construct
the work for $130,000, and to execute and
oVeliver to the city a good and sufficient
bond for $100,000; that Effey had given no
bond; that the warrant for $IGI,OOO was
delivered to Effey without any claim and
demand being presented to the city; that
the Mayor and Council had agreed that no
bids but Effey's should be received, and
that they had agreed to sell and deliver
the bonds to Effey before they were in ex
istence.
To all of this the city by its attorney, W.
F. Cowen, and Thomas Rutledge, special
counsel, interposed a variety of dilatory
pleas. Legal skirmis a was finally ended,
however, by a stipulation of all the parties
to have the case tried "to its final deter
mination" bofore Judge Daingerfiela of
San Francisco.
Meanwhile the defendant's attorneys
interposed a sweeping demurrer, declaring
that the complainant did not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action ;
that there was a misjoinder of defendants;
that there was a non-joinder of defendants
In leaving out theSeligmansof New York;
that the several causes had been improperly
united, and the complaint was uncertain
and ambiguous, etc.
After lengthy arguments upon both sides
the matter was submitted to Judge Dain
gerneld, who soon thereafter rendered the
now celebrated opinion which has caused
po many conflicting reports in the papers
and occasioned so much discussion among
lawyers.
A careful reading of the opinion shows
that Judge Dangerfield held thatthere was
no misjoinder or non-joinder of defend
ants. The fact that there was no money
in the treasury was not a jurisdictional
defect.
'â¢It is a proper exercise of legislative dis
cretion to arrange with the contractor to
take bonds in payment or part payment,"
the opinion declared. Continuing it gaid:
"Whether the Common Council can now
make changes in tliese plans, and adver
tise for bids upon the changed basis, can
not be determined at present. But it is
now determined that the accepted bid and
all proceedings upon it are void for the
reasons heretofore given, in the main, by
this court upon the demurrer iv the Jones
case."
The opinion stated that the allegations
of the complaint were to be taken for this
purpose to be true, finally ending by sus
taining the demurrer and giving plaintiff
ten days to amend.
The deposition of .Mr. Effey, as pub
lished, admits many of the allegations of
the complaint, but denies any collusion
between himself and Garratt '& Co. He
admits getting possession' of tlie warrant
through his agent, Mr. Goodwin of San
Francisco, and of receiving a telegraphic
credit of $165,000 from the Keligmans of
New York. The consideration paid by
Paul B. Perkins Mr. Effey states to be $1
ami other considerations. "When pressed
as to what the other considerations were
Mr. Effey said: " '
"I can say, but don't want to. I rrfuse
point blank. '
In the meantime, aa the contract has
been completed, accepted by the City and
paid for, people here are wondering what
it i- all about.

PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 18.â Chinese In
spector B. F. Josey of Taooma this after
noon arrested Mrs. May Belden, a woman
24 years of age, in a lodging-house on
Fourth and Morrison streets for smuggling
opium. A few minutes later he appra
hended her confederate, P. P. Candle of
Tacoma. Josey came from the Sound on
the train they rode on yesterday, and his
suspicion that they were handling contra
band opium was aroused by their conduct.
In die trunks in their ruora here Josey
found seventy-live cans of unstampea
opium, which'had been smuggled acros3
the border from Victoria.
Candle is quite prominent in Seattle
business and social circles, having, until
recently, been a member of the Hippert it
Xcrdan Hardware Company. He was
very anxious to have his name suppressed
in connection with the affair, although he
has made a confession of his complicity in
the smuggling scheme.
Mr?. Belden is a divorced woman, whose
former name was Dyer, and under which
she, up to within a year or two ago, was a
conspicuous figure in Tacoma's swell soci
ety. Both are in jail to-night in default
of bonds.

An Alaskan Miner. Jiobbed by a Pair
Jolly Acquaintances!
PORTLAND, 0p.., Jan. IS.-Theodore
Shade, an Alaskan miner and a guest at
the Grand Central Hotel, was held up and
robbed last night by two men whom he
supposed to be friends. They are Howard
Shock and Edward Bradbury, who were
arrested to-day by Police Captain Cox and
Patrolman Endicott and Kerrigan.
Shade has been here a few days only,
and soon after bis arrival he fell in with
Bradbury and Shock. They intimated to
Shade that they were men of means with
a notion of investing in Alaska mines. In
the course of their brief companionship
Shade' confided to Bradbury and Shock
that he brought down between $500 and
$600.
Last night the trio visited several resorts
in the North End and drank freely, after
which Shock separated from his com
panions. Shade was induced to cross the
steel bridge, where they were suddenly
confronted by Shock, who thrust a pistol
against Shade's face and told Bradbury to
go through his pockets.- The robbers se
cured only $12, as Shade had left the bulk
of his fortune in the hotel safe.
TRICKED HER ATTORSEIS.
Mr*. Lacy Accused of Settling a Cage
Out v}' Court.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 18.â An interest
ing sequel to a celebrated gambling case in
the State Circuit Court, which was dis
missed some lime ago, comes in the na
ture of a suit against Mrs. Mary E. Lacy,
the plaintiff in that case, brought against
her by her attorneys, Watson, Beekman &
Watson, who claim to have been beaten
out of their rightful fee by Mrs. Lacy' 8
diplomacy. The attorneys want $.v
fur their services.
Mrs. Lacy instituted suit against Fuhr, |
Gratton & Smith to collect $5538 94, which I
she claimed her husband had lost at faro i
within two years*. Twice the case came up !
for trial and was continued. Finally Mrs.
Lacy peremptorially ordered a dismissal. :
Therefore the attorneys set up the claim :
that Mrs. Lacy entered into a secret agree
meat with the defendant, Gratton and '
others, by which she received $4<JOO for ad-
Justing the case without bringing it to |
trial. As Mrs. Lacy did not divide with
her attorneys they "think they have been 1
grossly mistreated.

Capital Is Attracted by the Oil Fields 9
Industry.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. IS.â The
first rumble of approaching activity in real
estate is heard in the establishment of a
branch office on State street by Eaaton &
Eldridge of Ran Francisco. Althougn the
firm will make a specialty of Sumrcerland
real estate and oil properties, it will also
handle real estate generally.
NÂ» Bignal discoveries have been made in
Summerland during the past couple of
weeks, but new wells are constantly being
developed, and those already sunk are
steadily yielding their output.
A notable fact in connection with the
Summerland outlook is the remarkable
number of redemptions from tax liens on
lots in the little village which have been
recorded during the last few weeks. Evi
dently some iudividual or firm is making a
business of looking up tax titles in the dis
trict and quietly securing all the land pos
sible. Many who invested in Summerland
property years ago had moved away, and
being unable to dispose of their property
allowed their land to be sold for |taxes*.
Now these lots, formerly vainly hunting
purchasers at from $25 to $40, are exactly
bonght at ten and twenty times this price.

THEIR ABSENCE NOT NOTICED.
Jailer Chamberlain Unaware of His
Guests' Departure Until Break
fast Time.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 18.â Three bad
men â Con Kelliher, Mike O'Brien and
Sands â managed to make their escape
from the County Jail in a most mysterious
manner, some time between 7 o'clock last
evening and 8:15 this morning. Kelliher
and Sands were locked up in the north
corridor and O'Brien in a steel cell adjoin
ing. An inexplicable phase of the escape
is that when Jailer Chamberlain unlocked
the corridors this morning the locks were
in good condition, and in fact there was
no evidence that they had in anyway been
tampered with. The absence of the three
thugs became known only when breakfast
was being served.
Kelliher has had many visitors of his
own class, and especially since his recent
conviction of burglary, and it is believed
that one of his friends pas.Â«ed in a key,
with which the escape was effected. A
strange blantet was fourd in the dungeon,
which in a measure confirms the state
ment made by a prisoner that late last
night he heard some one walking about in
the outer corridor. The footsteps he heard
might have been those of the escapes,
emerging from the dungeon in which they
had been hiding.
Con Keiliher is one of the most daring
criminals on the coast, who would not stop
at the taking of life in the pursuit of his
"profession." About a month ago he was
arrested for lootine the store of Weigel &
Co. at Vancouver, "Wash., and another at
Oregon City. Besides these there are two
other charges of larceny in dwellings
pending against him. On Thursday he
was convicted in Judge Stephen's court of
the robbery of the lied Front trading
store at Oregon City, for which he was sen
tenced to ten years' imprisonment. The
other indictments against him were held
in abeyance until the prisoner has served
the ten-year term.
Mike O'Brien is a brutal wretch, who
was serving a year for larceny. Shortly
before he was sent up this time he had
completed a year's sentence for a murder
ous and unprovoked assault upon a wood
sawyer. Frank Rands is a dangerous
Port land crook and was in for larceny.
RELI6IOUS THOUGHT AND PROGRESS
An Epitome of Sermons of the Week
Throughout the Land.
Following is a summary of the principal
seimons recently delivered in the United
States and Canada by the leading clergy- I
men, priests, prelates, .religious teachers
and professors of the Christian faith. In
i every instance the full text has been care- j
; fully read and abbreviated.
NEWSPAPERS.
The daily newspaper is a brief daily encyclo
pedia, and, ii wisely used, it is an education in
i itself.â Rev. W. Hayes Moore, Doylestown, Pa.
THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
I am glad the American people with one
voice have said land-grabbing on the Amen-
I can Continent by European powers must cease
â Rev. Dr. Barrows, Presbyterian, Chicago, 111.
INFLUENCE. .
Our influence is immortal. It is the Im
! mortal part of us. Our deeds, our thoughts
j live on forever and forever. Each propagates
after its own kind.â Rev. Carlos Martyn, Chi
cago, 111. .*'
THE TURKS.
If we have any surplus guns or ammunition i
let us send them to the Armenians. If we
must fight, let us fight the unspeakable Turk
â Key. D. N. Griffin, Methodist, New Haven'
Conn. ,â â¢-,'â â¢*. '
MARRIAGE.
The husband, when he marries below his
social level, elevates his wife. When the
woman marries below her level she descends
to her husband's plane.â Rev. 11. C. Peters
New York City. '
GENTLEMEN.
All gentlemen are not Christians, but all
true Christians are gentlemen. The most re
fining, culturing and purifying influence on
earth i is- the gospel of Jesus Christ. âRev
Fran k'De Witt Talmage, Presbyterian, Pitts
burg, Pa. . ,
WISE.
If wine is made it will be' drunk; if it Is
drunk the drinker will become drunken ; wine
drinking leads to brandy drinking; the end is
a chamber of horrors.â C. E. Smith, Fre
donia, N. Y.
' . THE DEVIL'S POWER.
God sometimes restrains tho power of the
devil. There is a limit when his hellish pur
poses are checked.' The devil is very powerful
put he is not almighty.-Rev. E. C. Yerkes'
Methodist, Philadelphia, Pa. â¢â  !*""â¢'
ARBITRATION.
I look forward to - the . epoch when a court
recognized by all nations will settle interna
tional difficulties, instead of keeping large
standing armies, as they do in Europe âRev
G. A. Carstensen, Episcopalian, Indianapolis"
Ind. ; . . â  Â
CHRISTIANITY.
Christianity is a regulative power. It gives
the eye a glow, the hand and voice heartiness
and makes everything harmonious. It con
stantly throws out itÂ« life and radiates its
glory.â Rev. G. Monroe Royce, New York City.
MANHOOD.
True Christian manhood consists as much in
living a good life outside thÂ» pale of the
church, at home, and in the world, as It does
In being good at prayer meeting* and other
church assemblages.â Rev. John Evans, Bap
tist, Westerly. . > *
POLITICS AND BUSINESS.
â  The best men, the purest and strongest.ought
to be in politics, but not to make of it a busi
ness. The path of politics as a business 19 the
most dangerous which one can walk.â Rev
J. E. Smith, Methodist. Camden, N. J.
â  DOGS.
Heredity and environment play upon human
nature, on character. I had a 'Scotch terrier
I brought from Texas. He was a ratter from
Kattersville. I got a poodle aud he became
Just as good a ratter by association.â Rev. Sam
Jones, at Augusta, Me.
LEGAL MURDER.
War is legalized murder. No argument, how
ever finely spun, can change that dictum.
War is a school for thieves, robbers and mur
derers. It teaches men the art of strategy,
lying, theft and killing, It hardens human na
ture.âDr. Joseph Eilverman, Hebrew, New
York City.
UNITARIANISM.
Unitarianism means that there is a band of
men and women who dare to think. It means
the deepening, the heightening of the con
science, the declaration of human, right, the
assertion that what is good down here is good
up there.â Minot J. Savage, Providence,
LOVE OP MONEY.
Some people so cling to their pelf and tinsel
that they starve their own souls. They will
not even attend a church because they might
ne asked to contribute money for its support,
rhey rather deprive themselves of the bread of
Â« ce T Â° ecause it costs them something.â Rev. D.
M. Benham, Pittsburg, Pa
WAR TALK.
The talk of war between two great Christian
nations when Armenians are being massacred
daily by the Turks is shameful. America and
England should be working together to put
the Turk out of Armenia; instead of that these
two great nations threaten one another, and
by so doing make further massacre in the
East probable.â Rev. Jeremiah Zimmerman,
Syracuse, N\ Y.
THE ARMENIANS.
The Sultan of Turkey has out-heroded Herod
by the slaughter orMhousands upon thousands
of innocent Armenians. Let us pray, almighty
God, not only in our public worship, but also
in our private devotions, that he will arouse
the Christian nations of Europe to rescue the
Armenians from further desolation and de
struction.âRev. John E. Adams, Presbyterian,
Brooklyn, N. Y.
PERSONAL RELIGION.
Christianity is not an abstract philosophy or
a system of ethics merely, but it is beiore all
and above all a personal religion. The claim
which Jesus Christ makes upon every man and
woman in the world is one which if yielded to
must in the very nature of things change and
transform the entire life.â Dr. Lewis Banks,
Methodist, Brooklyn, N V
THE CHURCH.
While the church must be in the world the
world must not be permitted in the church.
Ihe church is like a river; insist that it be
kept pure. The church is like a temple; keep
it from decay. The church is like an army ; it
must be true to its spirit and mission and be
loyal to its commander.â Rev. T. K. Busneld
Baptist, L'tica, N. Y.
THE STANDARD OF PURITY.
The standard of purity has been steadily
raised and it is steadily rising. Neither Swift
nor Sterne would be tolerated to-day in any
Christian pulpit. The tone of the English
literature has been greatly elevated since that
time and, moreover, it is cause for gratitude
that pure and healthy literature is nowadays
quite as cheap as that which is filthy and de
grading.âRev. James McLeod, Presbyterian
Scranton, I'a.
WAR.
War means a picture too horrible to contem
plate; it means sacred relationships broken;
it means homes shattered; it means universal
sorrow und mourning; it means prosperous
cuies erased from the map of ourcountry it
means great fortunes lost; it means an inher
itance ot poverty to our descendants. War is a
relic of barbarism, a brutal device of savagery
It has no place in Christian civilization to-day
âArchdeacon K. 8. Kousmanierc, Episcopalian,
New Bedford, Mass.
POLITENESS.
Politeness costs little, but it pays well.
Courtesy in the home is like morning sunshine
pouring in at every window. An employer can
well afford to be polite to an employe, for it
makes the workingman do better wort and
binds together the two classes in a beautiful
fellowship. In the effort to settle the differ
ences between capital and labor, if we could
bring into the controversy more courtesy and
Jess bitterness of speech it would help amaz
ingly in solving the question.â Rev. John L.
Jacobs, Baptist, Grand Rapids, Mich.
PEACE.
Would it not be better for the salvation of
manâ far better for the conquest of religionâ
instead of sending missionaries into the jar
Last, into the jungle of Africa, into the Dark
Continent, spending millions of dollars, sacri
ficing precious lives to teach the semi-savage
ana barbarians the lessons of Christian loveâ
I say, would it not be better to send these very
missionaries to the conflicting and hostile
civilized Christian netlons of Europe, demand
ing of them compliance with the injunction of
that great Jew, Jesus, the founder of Christi
anity,'-Love ye one another."â Rabbi Eistu
ber, Hebrew, Peoria, 111.
LOST TIME.
In view of the brevity of time and its rapid
flight, the utmost wire should be taken iv the
use of time lest any of it should be wasted.
The wind that blows by us may return esain
on its backward sweep; the stream that flow?
by us may descend again upon the enrth and
resume its channel; the sun that shines in
heaven to-day may chine attain, but wasted
time is lost forever. Wasted health may be
restored; lost reputation may be regained;
squandered wealth may be recovered, but lost
time is forever lost and" not a single hour run
be recovered.â Rev. G. B. Strickler, I'resbyte
riau, Atlanta, Ga.
ATHLETICS.
In the Christianity of to-morrow men would
learn of the sacredn'ess of the body. Athletics
to-day percolate imo all kinds of society. Men
thunder against women riding the bicycle, but
the thundering does not decrease the'number
of women astride the wheel. God is behind
this general craze for outdoor sports. Men
now need health, and God will give it to them,
just as he gave the world steam aud electricity
after many years: it was at a time when most
needed. Out of this improvement iv Jiealth is
to cone a race of strong lmen and women, who
will be the greatest toilers ever known in the
kingdom of God.â Key. J. K. Kmiih, Methodist,
Trenton, N. J.
THE UNPARDONABLE SIN.
The unpardonable sin is the act of one who is
highly enlightened and at the same time very
malicious against (iod. Light respecting spir
itual things and malice against the person,
work or oflices of the Holy Ghost are the essen
tials In many ways man may commit such a
sin, and he who would not sin beyond forgive
ness must take heed how he trifles with holy
things. To continue to say "Xo" to the offer of
mercy is one way to commit the sin. A willful
and continued rejection of evidence is one
way. Any one who can deliberately reject the
offer of Christ's mercy can commit the unpar
donable sin and be left alone by the Holy
Spirit to perish.â Key. I). A. Cunningham,
Wheeling, \V. Va.
ENGLAND AND AMERICA.
Have you thought for a moment what a war
between England and America would mean?
It would be a war between the two greatest
Christian nations of the earth. It would mean
vastly more than what is Involved in the
boundary dispute between England and Vene
zuela. It would be a calamity from which the
cause of Christianity would not recover tor
centuries. It would result in the fatal dis
turbance of those social, commercial and
spiritual relations which year by year have
been drawing England and America closer
together. It would tend to unsettle the faith
that has become bo firmly fixed, the belief that
after nineteen centuries of the reign of the
prince of peace war between Christian nations
had become impossible.â Rev. Dr. Cornell,
Episcopalian, Sioux City, lowc
JONAH AND THE WHALE.
The story of Jonah and the whale, interpreted
by liberalists, has been a most prolific cau*c of
6itepticism. More ridicule hag been aimed at
the Bible because of this than any other one
thing.
The religious world has been more disaV
trously afflicted over the attempt to swallow
the whale than the whale was with Jonah, and
a great deal of faith has been thrown out in the
attempt to dispose of Jonah. As long as Tn.l
-mages defend the story as literally true Intrer
solls will ridicule it as absurdly false. As long
as one insists on having Jonah swallowed the
other will enjoy drawing word pictures of
Jonah "dodging rapidly around to escape the
gastric juice," or "sitting on a posterior molar,
wiping the sweat from his forehead and
anxiously looking out for signs of land."â Rev.
L. H. Squires, Universalist, Brooklyn, X. Y.
Tracing Gladstone's Phrases.
A rather futile correspondence is being
carried on as to Mr. Gladstone's merits as
a phrase-maker. Probably the question is
settled by the fact that "bag and baggage"
âa jingle which he did not inventâ is
quoted as one of his most brilliant efforts.
Now people are tracing the phrase back,
and they have got so far back on the jour
ney as the sixteenth century, which at any
rate gives the phrase the respectable merit
of antiquity.
Very few phrases of Mr. Gladstone ever
struck my in. agination or appealed to my
memory. Bat there was one uttered years
ago which seemed admirable. Ho was
speaking, I thinkâ l am unable to verify
my quotationsâ of the relations between
an orator ana his audience, and he said
that "the orator returned the enthusiasm
in flood which he received from the audi
ence in vapor." and one day I found that
yery expression in DeQuincey.and another
I discovered that DeQuincey had borrowed
it from Locke. And whence did Locke get
it? The eternal fitness of things suggests
Noah.â Pall Mall Gazette.
The Massachusetts Indian.
Professor F. W. Peabody of Harvard
has sent to Secretary of State Olin a sketch
of an Indian which he thinks should take
the place ol the present one on the Massa
chusetts coat-of-arms. In his report he
gives a description of the accoutrements
and wearing apparel of the figure, ana
gives his authority for the use of each arti
cle, and also for their positions on the fig
ure. He places the bow in the left hand,
and says that to place it in the right hand
is as absurd as to represent a military man
with his sword hung on the right side.
He says that it is evident that the man
who made the original drawing of the In
dian knew nothing about Indians. He
probably had never seen one, and had
made the drawing from his own ideas.
The ridiculous blunders which he mada
have since been perpetuated, and even in
corporated into the State law. The design
of Professor Peabody will be submitted to
the Archives Committee.
CALIFORNIA GAINS

Railroad Traffic Over the
State Has Been

BLESSING TO GROWERS.
Grainfields and Pasture Lands

Soaking.
EIVEKS ARE STILL RAMPAGING.
I;
Truckee's Ice Palace Is Partially De
nuded, but the Damage
Is Slight.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 18.âYester
day the general outlook in local railroad
circles was that, for a time at least, traffic
would have to be abandoned entirely. Up
in the Sierras the great washout caused by
the cloudburst in the vicinity of Crystal
Lake had left a chasm over 100 feet long
and 30 feet deep, which it became neces
sary to bridge with rough cribbing before
trains could pass. Beyond Marysville the
track was covered by a wind-swept sea of
water, in places 8 feet deep.
As far as Oroville was concerned it was
simply cut off from all railroad communi
cations with the outside world, and in
fact is yet, as the Feather River is still
booming and the pathway of the iron
horse is impassable. Down the Stockton
route the small streams had become rag
ing torrents that threatened every minute
to tear away the strongly built culverts
that bridged them, and out near Davis
ville a gang of laborers was working
through the dreary hours of the night in
an almost vain endeavor to restrain the
waters of Putah Creek, which, if they
could only burst through the masses of
earth-filled sacks that lined their puny
banks, would do inestimable damage and
effectually sever the great artery of traffic
that leads to the home of the Webfoot.
Nor wag this the only danger that
threatened to cut the connection with
California and her sister States. All the
insignificant streams that cros3the Oregon
line of railroad had developed into raging
torrents, covered with tangled masses of
drift that lodged against the culvert-sup
ports and threatened to tear them out
bodily, and yet within a few brief hours
all this damage had been temporarily re
paired and traiiic resumed. The golden
fruit from California's favored slopes is
speeding its eastward way, and the
products of Eastern manufactures are
a^aia crossing the snowy wastes of the
Sierras.
TIIVCKLE WAXTS SXOW.
Warm Miow.rs Are Denuding the Jce
Palace of Xts Covering.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Jan. IS.â The storm
continues without sign of abatement, and
the precipitation for the laat few days has
been remarkable, the rain gauge measur
ing 4.31 inches for the storm. For the
twenty-four hours ending at noon to-day
two inches of rain had fallen. Up to the
present time rain was an unknown quan
tity at this time of year and the heavy
showers, coming on top of the snowstorm,
nave caused Truckee River to rise to a con
siderable height. Should it freeze hard to
night the ground will be one glare of ice
in the morning. In an interview Director-
General McGlashan of the ice palace to
day said :
"If this had been a snowstorm, as usual
at this time of year, the amount of snow
would equal that of the remarkable winter
of 1890, when trains were blockaded and
travel impeded generally."
"At this time last year," continued Mr.
McGlashan, " there was fifteen feet of snow
on the level, and tunnels were dug across
the streets."
The ice palace and toboggan slide have
suffered considerably because of the storm,
and almost two-thirds of the ice on the
palace has melted. On the sheltered side,
however, the ice holds on to the wire with
remarkable tenacity, but it is slowly melt
ing. An immense block of the crystal six
feet square was taken into the interior of
the palace from Boca. Thi3 block has
melted from two to three inches daily,
while the ice on the north side of the pal
ace has not perceptibly decreased. This
shows the decided advantage over the
Canadian style of building. With the
thermometer at zero for one or two nights,
the palace would be in excellent condition,
and skating would be at its best. The
barometer is steadily falling, which is a
good indication of a heavy snowstorm.
It must not be imagined that the ice
carnival is a failure, as with the right
kind of weather everything could be made
to boom in the course of a day or two.
As evidence of the confidence that more
favorable weather will soon come, the
managers aie building a booth in the
palace for the sale of souvenirs and photo
graphs of the carnival.
It is stated authoritatively that no ex
cursions will be run unless everything is
in the best possible condition, and several
have been canceled on account of the
weather. Special days have been get
apart by the carnival directors as follows:
Saturday, January 25, Native Sons of the
Golden West day ; Thursday, January 30,
Knights Templar day ; January SI, Knights
of Pythias day; February 3, Fireman's
day; February 22, National Guard and
Red Men's day,
The ice men are praying for colder
weather, and are waiting for one cold night
to freeze the ice solid before commencing
to harvest the balance of the crop.
XEDMXG JJV DARKXESS.
Â£leetric Light riant and Water Works
* Bumps Are Under Water.
REDDING, C*l., Jan. 18.â The terrific
storm which broke upon this city Wednes
day increased in fury until noon to-day, \
when, with a few claps of thunder, the
clouds broke away, and to-night the sky is
clear and the atmosphere cold and chilly.
Last night and until late this morning
the gale and rain continued. Telegraph
and telephone poles were blown over, and
the rapid rise of the river has compelled
the people of this city to go without water
and light. All the electric lights, arc and
incandescent, are out to-night, and the city
is in, total darkness, except for lamps and
candles. The high water in the water
company's canal has completely inundated
the pumps, and the supply of water has
been shut off all day.
, Parties not fortunate enough to have
wells on their premises had water sup
plied to them by the water company,
which put into service sprinkling carts,
that made regular trip, dishing out
bucketfuls to those in need. Should afire
break out to-nieht the town would be
completely at the mercy of the flames, as
not a particle of water is in the mains.
The big storm bas been general through
out the county. No snow has fallen in the
mountains. It has been all rain, and
plenty of it. At noon to-day the Sacra
mento Kiver registered twenty feet above
low water mark, and it is still rising;. An
immense amount of drift is floating down,
impeding travel by the ferries. The low
lands and fields along the river are under
water. Stages could not cross the bridge
over the river at this place this morning
on account of the water running around
the approaches. On the mountain mines
railroad two bridges above KeswickacrosÃ
Spring Creek and one below were swept
away by the rising waters, and a great
amount of damage haa been done to the
new road by washouts.
Calaboose Creek, a small stream run
ning through this city, was bank full, and
last night C. H. Goldberg, an insurance
man, nearly lost his life in the torrent.
He was in a hack, and, the night being
dark, the driver missed the bridge across
the creek on Yuba street and drove into
the stream. Goldberg was nearly drowned,
but by heroic efforts succeeded in swim
ming out.
GOLD IX SAX ANDREAS STREETS.
CoaraÂ« Specimens Found in Gravel
Uncovered by the Rain.
SAN ANDREAS, Cal., Jan. 18.â Showers
have been falling all day, and at 4 o'clock
this afternoon there were thunder and
lightning. Soon the water fell in sheets,
this downpour lasting about twenty min
utes. The streets were flooded, ditches
became swollen streams and the creek run
ning through town gained the promi
nence of a river and overflowed its banks.
As far as can be learned no damage was
done.
The rain is a great boon to miners and
farmers, and both industries will be greatly
benefited. The main street of the town is
sloping, and when the rain came it washed
off the mud, leaving the gravel-bed bare.
This gravel used to yield much gold in
early days. People now searching find
numerous coarse specimens. One hunter
found a nugget worth nearly $7.

NAPA RIVER RISIXG.
Trains Delayed by a Great Washout
Near Kruga Station.
NAPA, Cal., Jan. 18.â The Napa River
went down several feet during the night,
but the continued rains have again raised
it, and at present it is higher than last
night. The boat landing is under water
and Spanishtown is flooded. The river is
running across First street several feet
deep.
The morning San Francisco train was
delayed several hours on account of a
washout, a mile and a half in length, near
Krugs station. A special train came up
from Vallejo and took the passengers down
from here.
Over two inches of rain have fallen dur
ing the past twenty -four hours and about
five inches in the last two days. The
river is still rising and if the rains con
tinue up the valley great damage will be
done to property.
SAXT A. CR UZ DEZ JJGED.
Another Downpour Jiegins With the Cotn-
ing of Night.
SANTA CRUZ, Cat,., Jan. 18.â Tne sun
shone brightly this morning for the first
time since Sunday, though the heavy rain
did not cease till after daylight. * The
total rainfall for the week is 4.49 inches,
and for the season 9.20 inches. There
were showers throughout to-day, and to
night a heavy, steady downpour.
A landslide at Felton Junction pre
vented the narrow gauge outgoing train
from going through, but connections were
made there. Feed on dairy farms is grow
ing rapidly from the effects of the rain.
Coonty roads in all directions in good con
dition.
HoJlister Cropa Benefited.
HOLLISTER, Cal., Jan. 18.â All doubta
as to good crops were dispelled by a fall of
rain, 2.83 in the past forty-eight hours.
Growing grain is in good condition to re
oeive all the benefit and grass is springing
up rapidly.
Damage Done at Nevada.
NEVADA, Cal., Jan. 18.â The storm
last night was terrific. Several dwellings
were moved from their foundations by the
wind and Downing's brick block on Main
street was unroofed.

NOTARY PUBLIC.A BIG BUCKLEY RALLY.
Officers and an Executive Com
mittee to Be Created To-
Morrow Night.
THE EX-BOSS TO DECIDE THINGS.
The Junta Waits, the Breach Is Not
Wide and Paths to a Compromise
Are Discussed.
The Buckleyites will have a large and
important time on Monday evening, when
the old and the new general committeea
will meet in Odd Fellows' Hall to transfer
the reins of local party government.
The old committee will wind up its af
fairs after nearly four years of power, ap
prove the work of the primary committee
of twenty-five with the recent primary
election and adjourn sine die. Acting and
Vice-Chairman Joseph Rothchild of the
old committee will at once call the new
committee to order and permanent organ
ization will be proceeded with.
Who the new officers are to be is inter- j
e?ting or worrying a largÂ« portion of the ;
new committee. The chairmanship is, of \
course, the thing of most interest. Attor
ney Joseph Rothehild. the present acting
chairman, appears now destined to receive
the honor. A few days ago James H. |
O'Brien was regarded cs the logical and !
probable chairman. He is popular with |
the boys, has been a very active leader in i
the recent campaign affairs of the faction i
arid deserved something for being defeated I
by A. A. Watkins that time. Bat Jim j
O'Brien is out of the race. He declines the
nation for some reason and says he i
wouldn't take it under any circumstances, j
Rothchild and ex-Senator Donovan
have beer, prorninentiy talked of for some j
time, and now the probabilities lie be- j
tween them, with the chances in favor of '
Rothchild. Teter P. Dunne has been I
talked of, but he is generally regarded as
too valuable on the lloor to be muzzled
with a gaveJ. He is third in the line of
probabilities.
The importance of the chairmanship is
.zed by the influential Buckleyites
who are interested, and th<? right man is
wanted for the place. Those faroring
Rothchild point out that he is familiar
with parliamentary law an.i that he has ;
â  k wit, tact and force of character
ight to reside in the chairman of a
ly of Democratic politicians. These
are very important things. It takes
'â â it. tact and boldness to carry out
immes, recognize the right people ,
â¢ no and decide at the rignt moment.
also argued that as Rothchild is a
wealthy man. seeking no office, that is
ber consideration in his favor.
Donovan is regarded as worthy of honor, i
me thiuk that he wcild tit in better
as chairman of the executive committee
; hat is to be created. He has never been;
ilarly close to Buckley, is very de
ite in his style and somewhat inde-
Dendent in his spirit. Many think that
be would not be the best man to carry out
-.mimes.
But there will be no lierce battle over
the chairmanship next Monday night. j
Bucklevitps don't do tbincs that way \
when Buckley is around. Buckley will
settle the thing betore Monday night.
The great harmonizer lets things develop
until he knows just how things really
stand and who wains what and then I
:.:akes a jewel of expediency. He will de
cide the eiiairrnar.nhip in that all-satisfy
ing way that is wholly his own before to
morrow nipht, if he has not done s>o al
ready, and if more than one nomination is
made Monday n;ght there will likely be a
graceful declination and a swell of tender
feeling over the election. Rothchild says
that he is not seeking the place and will
not enter a contest for it.
It seems more than likely that Peter F.
Dunne will be vice-president. The secreta
ryship has two warm aspirants in Josepu
I. Twohie, the present acting secntarv,
and Daniel M. Gavisran, who was secretary
of the last Democratic municipal conven
tion. Both have their backers, and some
are not backing either. There is a move
ment to make Frank J. I'allon secretary,
"â¢ ill accent the orhce.
fhe most important business that will
follow the election of officers to-morrow
night will be the creation of an executive
committee. No County Committee, and :
especially a boiy of 450 Democratic politi
i ians with more or less clashing interests, i
mplete or capable of its highest effi- i
- , at least, in heeding the counsel of a
Buckley without an executive com- !
mittee. This general committee has not
i.iii one since the one instituted by Max;
â  r and abolished two years ajro.
Tne one to be established now will have !
to be created through an amendment to i
the constitution, and such an amendment 1
will bo introduced to-morrow night. It is '
doubtful iiow large the executive com- I
mittee will be. It will probably be com- 'â¢
â  of one or two representatives of
each district. It is one of the probabili- 'â .
ties that M. J. Donovan will be made chair- i
â¢ â¢â  executive committee if the
manship of the general committee >
to Ruthchiid.
The Junta ia displaying an inactivity !
that is considered rather masterly in view
of tho fact that Messrs. Popper, Braun
bart, Sullivan and McNab think that the
â¢ tune has not come to do
anything. When the daily expected
decision in the new election commis- j
H:on comes along something will
be done about the primary which !
is to choose a new general committee.
W hen the Junta primary does come alone
it will be according to that much talked of
but never tried method, the postal
primary. As a stamped and addressed â 
envelope containing a ballot will be mailed
to every voter whose name appears on the i
Junta rolls, with the request that the ''
voter vote by merely remaiiing the ballot
a display of strength that will count for a
good deal before the State Central Com- j
mittee and the fcitate Convention is reck- !
oned on.
No definite decision about the time of
the primary has been announced, and
there is a possibility, if not a probability,
that there will not be a Junta primary
merely for the election of a new general
committee and a second one a few weeks
later to choose delegates to the State Con
vention. There is no great need of a new
general committee, and tiie primary may
be delayeu and made to serve both pur
poses.
The situation between the Junta and
the Buckley faction remains the same as
it became when the battle-field cooled off
a few weeks ago. The factions are wide
apart and they are quietly letting each
other alone and waiting for something to
turn Dp. Nobody is getting out and de
nouncing Buckley just now, because there
is no panicular occasion for it at the
moment. Each faction is quietly attend
ing to its own business, saying. "Sh! sh !"
to its own kickers, and with sneering curi
osity watching the other from across the
alley. The Biickleyites ignore the Junta
wholly in their daily doings, but consider
the revolutionists when taking counsel on
the future. All know, with Buckley, that
they will get together in the endâ that
"somehow, somewhere, meet we must."
Buckley says, "Democrats are like Kil
kenny cats. No matter how hard they
when the light is over there are more
cats. 1 '
lii this situation Buckley leaders sa^ :
we are the party and have proved it. and
"f; 11 go rifiht ahead and send to the State
convention a delegation that can't help be
seated. \\ c will h. lY e evidence that we
constitute the regular oreanization, that
we have the political strength of the party
with us, and that the Junta is founded oh
fraud and false pretensions. We will have
able men to present our case ana strong
influences to back us."
The anti-Buckleyites say: "We are the
party as everybody knows and we will be
recognized by the State Central Commit
tee. We will go right ahead ana send a
delegation to the State convention with
that prestige and it can't help be seated.
We will show that the other faction is
completely dominated by Boss Buckley,
who has been a traitor to his party, and
that recognition of Buckley means party
suicide."
But back of all this talk is the probability,
if not the certainty, of a settlement before
the State Convention meets. There are
three possible solutions recognized. One
would follow the maintenance ot the rup
ture until the State Convention meets. In
the event of two delegations going to the
convention, it is thought most likely that
Political expediency would govern the ac
tion of the convention and that, recog
nizing the importance of the San Francisco
Democratic vote this year, the convention
would divide the representation between
the delegations. The Buckley faction has
shown itself so strong, and so much
stronger than the other side, that its being
ignored or turned out in the cold, is gener
ally conceded to be out of the question.
Another possibility is that when the
State Central Committee meets about the
last of February, a way of healing the
breach will be found, though the Buckley
leaders, such as Joseph Rothchild, John
McCarthy, A. T. Spotts and others, declare
that the State Central Committee has noth
ing to do with it, and that they will not
co' 1 -ik It.
The third possibility is that before a
crisis comes that large and strong element
of the party which sides with neither fac
tion nor takes much interest in the rival
ries of politicians and bosses which have
caused the breach will assert itself and
force an agreement in behalf of the party.
In this class are W. D. and Warren Eng
lish, Russell Willson, James G. Maguire,
W. W. Foote, J. D. Sullivan, J. J. Dwyer,
Judge Garber and many others of strong
party influence.
The Buckley leaders are continuously
anxious to effect a compromise through
such strong inliuences which might be
headed by Messrs. Popper, Braunhart,
Sullivan and McNab, who control the
Junta through the sustaining power of
John Daggett, Ed Lanigan and the Fire
Department. Compromise is the object of
Buckley's constant effort, and the proba
bilities of it grow stronger.
RAN AWAY FROM HOME
Johnny Cunliffe and Augustus
Bodel, Two Schoolboys,
Disappear.
Their Parents Worried Over Their
Absence â They Were Last Seen
at San Jose.
Johnny Cunliffe and Augustus Bodel,
aged 12 and 9 years respectively, have
wandered from their own liresides, and
their parents and friends are worrying
over their prolonged absence.
The boys went away from their homes a
few days before Christmas, and have not
been seen or heard of since. The ques
tions: Where they hare gone? What they
are doing? How they are living? are
causing a guessing contest among their
relatives.
The Cunliffe boy lived with his grand
mother, Mrs. O'Brien, at 502 Post street.
The Bodel youth is a son of the artist at
514 Post street. The latter attended the
Penman School and the former the
Plymouth. Cunliffe is bright, active and
well advanced in the ways of the world for
a boy of his years. He sold newspapers

Kan Away From Home.

when not at school, and was well known
among the newsboys of the street. When
his parents died some years ago he and
an elder brother and sister were tanen
tinder the sheltering wing of the grand
mother, a plain, kind, affectionate old
woman, now in the declining years of life.
She cared for them with tenderness. All
the children, excepting "Jack," obeyed
her command. He persisted in absenting
himself from school, and she chastised
him for his erring conduct. This is the
only reason she can give for his running
away from school.
"Jack is a bright boy," said the old lady
yesterday, "and if he only gets to some of
the big places he will be able to make a
living. He is quick at selling newspapers,
toys or anything like that. Why did he
runaway? Oh, I don't know. I told him
he had to go to school. That he would
not do. The teacher had to send the
notes about him to me through the mail,
as if Jack caught a boy coming to the
house with a note he would be at him.
Yet he was not a bad boy. Surely you
have heard something of him," and the
oid grandmother seemed to doubt the
assurance of the reporter that he knew
nothing of her boy.
When he left home the Cunliffe boy
wore a suit of brown corduroy, blue cap
and black stockings. He has dark eyes
and hair. He is not tall for his age.
The Bodel boy is several years younger
than Cunliffe, and his parents declare that
he has been led away. He is quiet and re
tiring in disposition. He has light hair
and blue eyes. His father is an artist at
514 Post street.
The boys were last seen at the railway
depot, can Jose, a few days after Chrin
mas.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
DEMANDS OF THE CHURCH
Will Ask Dr. Brown Why He
Persisted in Shielding Mrs.
Stockton.
INJURIOUS TO MRS. DAVIDSON.
Letters From Eastern People Deroga
â¢ tory to Dr. Brown's Alleged
Defamer.
The power of tmblic opinion, or that por
tion of it which is the exponent of
sentiments entertained by the First Con
gregational Church, is being felt very
strongly by the judges Dr. C. O. Brown
appointed recently to try his case.
The legality of his appointment of those
judges, according to Congregational
polity, to say nothing of common law and
equity, is called in question. The mem
bers are willing to waive that, however,
since they admit that they had not in
formed themselves previously by consult
ing their church manual concerning their
right to challenge such a course. Their
excuse is that the possibility of such a
proceeding on the part of their shepherd
had not occurred to them.
There is a conviction, amounting to a
demand, that the committee of investiga
tion should nold open sessions. It is
claimed that the result of star-chamber
meetings will not be cordially indorsed,
no matter what these results may be, for
secrecy in such cases never begets con
fidence.
But there are two counts in the indict
ment they have returned against the rev
erend gentleman that they will force upon
the attention of the judges. They want to
be satistied as to the motives of Dr.
8.-own in permitting Mrs. Stockton to
unite with the First Church when, by his
own confession, he knew her to be a
blackmailer.
They want an explanation of his un
doubted desire to bring her into promi
nence in church work, when he was
cognizant of her moral unritness for such
a charge. All these efforts to give her a
position of influence in the church, it is
said, were made after he knew her char
acter thoroughly and against the remon
strance of members of tne church whose
integrity and devotion he could not assail.
'Dr. Brown must explain his persistent
shielding of a woman he knew was un
worthy," they say, and they are careful
to say it to the committee! adding that
the failure to cover that important point
in the case will lay that body open to the
charge or a willful ignoring of the claims
of justice.
Another query the church proposes to
propound to the minister through its
agents, the judges, is, "Why did you call
upon Mrs. Davidson to offer devotions at
prayer meeting after you believed her to
be a hypocrite? Why did you help her to
wear a mask if you knew it to conceal
moral hideousness?"
* There are members who recall distinctly
that Mrs. Davidson's voice was heard in
supplication at prayer meetings in the
First Church after, according to the pas
tor's allegations, he was convinced that
she was a conscienceless pirate on the high
seas of society.
It is not probable that Dr. Brown will
occupy the pulpit of the First Congrega
tional Church to-day. Inquiry at his
J|ome last nijrht developed the fact that lie
was quite ill. though his son Valentine
could not say anything as to what his
father mi^ht do. Valentine Brown gave
the following letter to the reporter, which
is said to hare been received by tne sister
of a prominent clergyman of this City :
Bucksport, ME.,.Tanuary 3, 1896.
We have been Interested in thenccountsof the
goings on of a townswoman of ours, Mrs. Mary
I'uvidson. She was born in Bucksport, and
her poor father, 85 years old, is still living
here. She has drained his purse in her i arinus
speculations, and they take precious little
stock in her now. She is known here most
thoroughly, and has had a varied career
Those who went to school with her remember
her as a girl who in telling lies always ex
ceeded.
She was always acting a part. Her first hus
band died so suddenly that there nas always
been a shade of suspicion as to the cause. As
a beautiful young widow and a ripe Christian
she courted Mr. Forsyth before his marriage,
calling frequently to talk over the best good of
his church. He was briprht enough to see
through her and drop her. "Afterward she at
tempt.d to pursue him by taking up his sup-
Eosed treatment of a minister, a classmate of
is. The deacons and church committee were
called to her hou -e. where she received them
in a queenly fashion and charged Mr. Forsyth
with willful slander and lying.
That fell through. She* carried a Testament
in her pocket, and the lady with whom she
bearded astonished some of her friends by
bidding them, "Beware of the woman who car
ries a Testament in her pocket." When re
leased from the House of Correction she came
home, spent the Sunday in literary work and
prayer, leaving her old mother to do the work.
When she went away her mother expressed the
hope that she would have enough to eat. "Oh
never fear, I shall be fed by the ravens." Her
mother thought she must have been one of the
xavens that year. No truer words could be
said of her than,
I know a maiden fair to see. Beware! Beware!
Trust her not. she is fooling thee.
If she is in State prison I hope she will stay
there; you need not pity yer. I could tell a
long story, but will not. She is the second
Bucksport girl who has found a home in a Cal
| ifornia jail, and we are not proud of them I
I am foolish to write of this, but we know of the
i antecedents so well that her motherly counsel
| to the poor sinner, her prayers, her zeal for the
church sound very familiar. Dr. Brown's rep
utation will not be marred by any charge that
she can bring in our vicinity. Why do women
do so and why are they permitted to live? She
is bright enough to have been a power for
Rood. H. W. Beecher would say the her pray
ers would not be worthy of angel's wings to
bear them to the mercy seat. Respectfully,
Mary Sâ â .
Dr. Brown's son also gave out the fol
lowing:
A prominent gentleman in Michigan sends
the following clipping from a Portland daily:
A MICHIGAN DOCTOR'S EXPERIENCE WITH PAB
TOB BROWN'S lIUCKMAILKR.
Poutlaxj), Mich., January 10.
Dr. C. C. Dellenbaugh of this place says that he
onoe had a very disagreeable experience with Mary
A. Davidson, who, he thinks, is none other than
the s-an Francisco woman accused of blackmailing
Rev. C. O. .Brown.
Dellenbaugh's father was said to be worth about
$60,000. and when the doctor was a young
man lit; was called to attend a sick woman
in a flat in Buffalo, N. Y. Mary Davidson met
him in the room, locked the door and coolly de
manded a good sum of money from the astonished
physician. After expostulating with the woman
for a few moments Dr. Dellenbaugh says that he
kicked the door open and made his escape.
He has examined the picture of the San Fran
cisco woman and says that it tallies with that of
the Buffalo shark.
DANCED AND DINED.
The Employes of Nathan, Dohrmann &
Co. Enjoy a Pleasant Social
and Banquet.
On Thursday evening Beethoven Hall,
in Hotel Savoy, was the scene of a re
markably pleasant gatheringâ a gathering
rarely duplicated in this City. As an
object-lesson, showing the good feeling
that should prevail between the employer
and his employes, it was indeed sugges
tive.
It was a social and banquet given osten
sibly to celebrate the forty-fifth anniver
sary of Nathan, Dohrmann & Co., but in
reality it was a reception to the employes
of the firm given by the employers. The
event commemorated the forty-fifth anni
versary of the house, the thirty-rifth anni
versary of Mr. Nathan's connection and
the twenty-seventh anniversary of Air
Dohrniann's connection with the estab
lishment.
The attendance was composed exclu
sively of employes and employers, num
bering 130, and their families. The hall
was beautifully decorated for the occasion.
The first intimation of the treat in store
for them was a semi-humorous notice sent
to every attache of the firm commanding
his presence at the hall on the date men
tioned, with special instructions to dress
as convenient, leave care behind and that
sickness would not be accepted as an ex
cuse for absence. The monotony of regu
lation dances was broken by songs and
recitations by Melville Meyer, E. W.
Ehmann, Ed Hemelke, E. Taylor and Miss
I. Munson.
At 10 o'clock the merrymakers repaired
to the banquet-hall, where there was found
everything that could tempt the appetite.
There another pleasing feature took place.
The veteran employes of the firm wore
presented with decorations by their fel
low-^mployes. Tne veterans were Henry
Lage (1863), A. Bachert (1866), J. H. Jahns
(1875) and Major Specht (1877). Appro
priate emblems were also presented to J.
Heineberg and Miss H. Ejrgert, the ad
dresses beintr made by A. B. C. Dohrmann.
P. W. Dohrmann also received a nice little
present â a dustpan and dustbroom. E.
Deutsch presided at the table as toast
master and addresses and toasts were
made and responded to by P. W. Dohr
inann, J. H. Jahns. Miss B. Honicsberger
R. Doph, Miss I. Munson, A. B. C. Dohr

UNCLE GEORGE ON TRIAL
Found Guilty of Having Will
fully Stolen Widow
O'Grady's Goat.
Roars of Laughter Attend the Sen
tencing of the W .-Known Club
man to the Legislature.
OAKLAND, Cat-., Jan. 18.â Society
filled every niche and corner of the Mac
donough Theater to-nieht to hear the
presentation of "Widow O'Grady's Goat,"
a burlesque trial by jury.
The audience was one of the most en
thusiastic that has ever been gathered to-
THE INVITATION ENGRAVED ON A SILVER PLATE WHICH WAS SENT TO
CHARLES M. SHORTRIDGE.
gether in Oakland's handsome theater.
The piece was superbly staged, and the
dignified satire and refined local witti
cisms kept the appreciative audience roar
ing with laughter till well on toward mid
night. All the first-nighters were there,
but never was a legitimate company re
ceived with the enthusiasm that was dis
played to-nieht. The weather helped to
bring out the people, and everything con
tributed to make the Unity Club benefit a
marked success.
The first act opened with the scene laid
in a courtroom of the Alaraeda County
courthouse. It was Department 5, and
Hon. Stephen G. Nye, who is known about
equally as an able jurist and a successful
agriculturist, was Presiding Judge.
Uncle George Bromley sat in charge of
Bailiff Hunt, and Beemed to be fully cog
nizant of the enormity of the crime with
which he was charged. Clerk Robert
Edgar called the case, "People of Califor
nia versus George T. Bromley. 1 ' There
was no desire for a continuance, and the
beautifully modulated tones of Major
Fred Whitney, the prosecuting attorney,
answered, "Ready, your Honor."
"When I was in Japan, your Honor,"
Major Whitney was saying, when the
audience bursted into a laughter that lasted
several minutes. The major was in Japan
two years ago, and everybody he has met
since then has been greeted with the ex
pression "When I was in Japan." and the
major's absentmindedness provoked the
mirth.
The jury had been secured at a previous
session of the court so the prosecution was
able to proceed without delay. Rastus
Washington Brown (Alex. Rosborough)
and Jean Baptisto Jellusean(B. C. Cavel
lier) were the witnesses for tue prosecution,
and they made out a pretty good case
against Uncle George.
During the testimony Major Whitney
introduced the poat in evidence and ex-
Mayor Pardee, counsel for defense, offered
no objection provided its keeper came
with it. This was agreed to and the ani
mal came on the staee. To the surprise of
most of the audience the goat was an un
usually good one, and performed antics
that no Watts Tract butter was ever known
to be guilty of.
During the giving of his testimony Alex
Roshorough made the startling admission
that he cculd sing. Attorney Pardee pro
ceeded to impeach the witness, and dur
ing his cross-examination the witness was
required to introduce a few specialties to
corroborate his testimony.
Mis>s Anne M. Kavunuugh took the part
of the prosecuting witness, VVidowO'Grady,
and at the close of the first act things
looked very gloomy for the prisoner.
The second act was occupied by the de
fense. Wun Lung (C. C. C. Vinzent) and
Wash Sing (Emil Nusbaumer) testified for
Uncle George, but under cross-examination
they fell down so clearly that they utterly
destroyed their case. To make matters
worse the prisoner make a statement on
his own behalf, and said so many con
tradictory tilings tnat all the eloquence of
his attorneys could not destroy its effect
on the jury.
After being out for a few minutes the
jury found the prisoner trinity as charged,
ana in a humorous speech Judge Nye sen
tenced Uncle George to the State Legisla
ture for life. Puil Walsh, the court re
porter, wheeled his testimony books off
the stage in a wheelbarrow, and the cur
tain fell after the handcuffs had been
placed on the prisoner.
The most significant feature was the ex
treme dignity of those who took part in
the trial. During the most excruciating
jokes not a smile could be seen in court
and even the antics of the human goat,
which part was taken by C. olemberg of
the Acme Club, although they convulsed
the audience, failed to disturb the equanim
ity of tne court.
It has been stated in many quarters that
Mme. Ernesta Grisi, who, at the age of 80,
recently died in Paris, was the last of the
Grisi family. This is an error. A married
daughter of the great prima donna is liv
ing in England.

Christ Spoke, Says the
Priest.

Contribute Letters to the
Controversy.
Jr. reply to a recent letter in connection
â with the controversy from the Rev. George
C. Hunting of Virginia City, New, and
published in The Call, the Rev. Father
Ycrke writes as follows:
San Fp.anc:*.-o, Jan. IS, 396.
To the Editor of the $a:i J-'rancUco Callâ Dear
Sir: All the way from Virginia City the Rev.
George C. Huming has written to prove that
Peter is not the "rock." He claims to have
given the subject "some considerable study"
(whatever that may be), aud therefore we may
expect to find a 'or^nd new and original theory
to break the force of cur Lord"s plain words.
However, his explanation is it old as Protes
tantism. Still it has been so long relegated
by scholars to '-innocuous desuetude" that the
Rev. G. C. Hunting may be pardoned for sup
posing i hat he has made a brilliant discovery.
Mr. Hunting's objection is brought against
the point of the argument which identifies
Petor as the rock: "Thou art Peter, and upon
this rock will I build my church.'' Mr. Hunt
ing claims that our Lord used two words, Pe
tros and Petra, to represent rock in this
passage, and that the change in terminology
was intended to show that the church was not
built upon Peter.
Now, as a matter of fact, tuere is no evidence
to prove that our Lord used these two words.
He did not speak in Greek, as Mr. Hunting
seems to imagine, but in Aramaic or Svriac,
which was the vernacular language of Pales
tine in those days. I have before me now two
editions of the Peshitto or Syriac version of St.
Matthew. These editions are at the service of
any scholar who may care to investigate the
matter. In this version, that is to say in the
languace used by our Lord himself, the sen
tence runs thus:
Aph ena cisar na lakh dant hi Kipha w-al i
hade Kipha ebneh 1-idiy.
"Ana I say r.uto thee that thin art Kepha j
and upon this Kepha I will bui'rt my church." j
When this sentence was turned "into Greek
why were the words chanced? Why was one '
Kipha represented by Fetros ai.d "the other i
Kipha by Pe:ra.' The reason is simple. The I
grammatical strnctnre demanded a change. I
The Greet word for -'rock," Petra, is feminine.
To call tt, Peter a I'etra would to Greek ears
sound as ridiculous as to call him Mary Ann.
Hence to avoid tne incongruity of referring to j
him as "she" the evaneeli.'t gave the name
the masculine termination. Petro-..
But why did he not use Petro? too in the ;
second r.ldce, and thus keep the -words identi- j
cal? The reason is that Petros us a common â¢
nourj mtans only a piece of rock or a stone. !
Hence in its common use it cou' a not be em- ;
ployed to represent the great rod foundation j
on which Christ intended to bu!ld his church, j
a proper name, however.it stsiUis for Petra,
because in do other way could thoi Greet call a
raan "Petra" than by changing it to Petros.
It is really painful to watch, the devices to
â which those are driven who wÂ«,-uld explain
away the plain meaning of our lord's words.
Let me put in parallel columns what Christ
said and what Mr. Hunting fays he said:

but I will build it on something else which

YORKE TO WENDTE.
The Catholic Chancellor's Con
ued Answer to the Uni
tarian Minister.
Writing in answer to Dr. Wendte, the
Rev. Father Yorke says:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. IS. 1896.â T0 the
Editor of the Callâ Dear Sib: Up to the pres
ent, in dealing wit i Dr. Wendte's charges, I
have paid: attention to the arguments based
on the relations between the Pope and tem
poral sovereigns during the period known as
the Middle Apes. My object has been to sepa
rate the theoretical from the historical. I
â wish to lay down those principles which bind
to-day because they always bind, and keep
distinct those principles which arose from a
peculiar condition of affairs and Â«7hich be
came obsolete when that condition of affairs
passed away.
THE PAGAN EMPIRE AND CHRISTIANITY.
At lie period when Christianity came into
the world the .-.an empire was at the height
of its power. For the first time in history a.
race of organizers had .founded a stable 'do
minion. The Rfman language and the Roman
lsw ruled from the borders of Caledonia to the
cataracts of the Nile. From the pillars of Her
cules to the Euphrates the mcjesty of the Ro
man peace brooded over the earth.
For 300 rears tne church was in conflict with
this great power. It was a foreign supersti
tion. The same calumnies which are circu- :
lated against Catholics to-day were circulated
egainst Christians then. " Whenever the
paean priests saw their temples deserted
they raised the cry that the Nazarenes
were plottin? against the empire. If newspa
pers were published in the days of Diocletian
they would bear a startling 'resemblance to
some of our metropolitan dailies on Monday
mornings when the preachers have epent the
Sabbath in thumping the drum ecclesiastic to
6tir their followers against the errors of Rome.
THE FALL OF THE EMriRE.
In the beginning of the fourth century two
preat events took place. One was the triumph
of Christianity and its official recognition as
the religion of the empire, and the other was
the transference of the seat of government
from Rome to Constantinople. The importance
of this second event was accentuated by
the fact that a tendency to disruption, !
which had already manifested itself was
given fall rein to serve family interests, and the '
great world organization was split in two
That part which had its capital at Constanti
nople was called the Eastern or Greek empire 'â 
The part which retained Italy and France and i
Spain was known as the Western or Latin !
pi re.
This latter portion, however, was menaced
by many and powerful enemies. From out of i
the marshes and forests of the north poured
triDe after tribe of barbarians. Whole nations I
forsook their ancient seats and swarmed like
bees on to the fertile regions of the youth.
Great chiefs led their hardy soldiers to the I
loot of cities where generations of peace had
Ftored untold wealth. Rome herself
that for generations had never i-cen a '
foreign foe at her gates was given up to
plunder. A score of kings paraded- their petty
dignities where once the decrees of the senate
were the only law, and toward the end of the
tilth century an insolent Goth dethroned the
last Emperor and Sent the useless insignia of
the empire to Constantinople as a sign that in
the west that empire, was no more.
THE CONDITION OF EfEOPE.
As we read of these occurrences in history
we find it very hard to realise what it ail
meant to the people who lived then. Let us
suppose that these United States have
existed for over 400 years, and that
their power has been extended even
to Patagonia. Let us suppose that enervated
I by luxury our people have lost their manli
! ness and that the Government has been grow
, ing every day more corrupt and more helpless.
Then imagine that from some inaccessible
' quarter of the far north tribe after tribe of
, Indians descends upon the States, wasting
j lands and cities with tire and sword. To pro
tect itself tne Government withdraws from
Washington to Buenos Ayres and abandons
the original territory to the invaders. Let us
then picture to ourselves what the condition of
this country would be thus delivered over to
sanguinary and ignorant savages and we may
> gain an idea of the state of Europe after the
, downfall of the empire of the West.
Charles J. Stille, in his studies in medieval
i history, gives the following graphic descrip
! tion of Europe after the barbarian invasion:
The general view of the middle aces would be
that of a stream fed from distant sourcesâ at first
a torrent, bursting from the forests of Germany,
sweeping onward, so violent In it* fury and so
overwhelming in its force as for a time to destroy
all trace of tne work of civilized man, and then,
long after, reappearing swollen by its tributaries,
a.- a mighty river, bearing upon its placid and
! ample bosom blessings of peace and comfort to
those ho dwell upon its shores. Again, the
general aspect of Kurope during the middle ages Is
that of a violent conflict, a struggle, not
merely between the barbarian tribes and the
legions at imperial Rome, and of these tribes with
each other, but also a constant struggle of opposing
ideas for the masteryâ of the Teuton against the
: Roman, of the north of Europe ncalusi the south,
! of Christianity against heathenism, of a savagery
: which has been compared to that of the North
American Indians with the highest form of civili
; ration then known to the world. In the midst of
such terrible birth-throes modern civilization Is
brought into the world, and. unlike any other
civilization in history, it owes Us peculiarities and ,
its characteristic strength to this violent conflict of
opposing forces of which it is the resultant.
THE MISSION OF THE CHUKCH.
The barbarians, as we have seen, made short
work of me civil and material authority of the
empire, but they met an authority which
stopped them in their full career. The Chris
tian church had in spite of persecution from
without and of laxity within been spreading
itself all over the world. The words of Christ
| constituting Peter the rock made him and his
successors the center of unity. Even during
j the lifetime of St. John we find Clement, the
I fourth Pope, exercising the pontifical au
i thority. Century after century as heresy and
schism arose the Popes stood out clearer r.nd
clearer as the "confirmers of the brethren"
' and the preservers of union. When, therefore,
' the barbarians overthrew the civil govern
ment of the Romans they found themselves
; confronted with a spiritual government, the
â  church, whose head resided in the ancient J
: scat of empire â Eternal Cityâ Rome.
Then began that wonderful drama known as
; the conversion of the barbarians. From Rome,
I as from a center, went out brave and holy men
and preached Christ to the gentiles. Patrick
: evangelized Ireland, Augustine convex ted
| England, Boniface gave his life for Germany,
I the Irish monks poured into Scotland, into
; France, into Switzerland, aye, even into Italy,
i and everywhere formed a new people for the ]
: church. Warriors who knew no law but their ;
! own wills were turned aside by the gaze of an !
unarmed monk. Savages to whom might
was right were compelled to bend their
i knee before the figure of a man
whose enemies nailed him to a
tree. Kings burned what they had adored and
adored what they had burned at the bidding
; of bishops who had neither earthly power nor
j earthly influence to enforce their commands.
i In a word, tha men who had broken the civil |
i arid military power of the empire to pieces
; were themselves conquered by a religion which j
is mightiest when it seems most weak.
At a time when civil society properly so :
called did not exist, it is not surprising that ;
there was much confusion between the spirit- :
ual and the temporal. The bishops were rec- i
ognized by kings and people not only as rulers j
in the church, but they were invested I
with secular jurisdiction. We must re- j
member that the commonwealth, such I
as it was, was professedly Christian, The foun- !
dations of law, of justice, of authority, had been !
laid again in the name of Christ and by the |
hands of Christ's ministers. This point we
should never forget, that the preservation of !
Europe from barbarism, from ignorance, from
anarchy, is the wort of the Catholic church.
At the head of the church stood the bishops j
of Rome. In later days men have blamed the
Popes because they attained such a command
ing position. But as Newman say?, their role
was forced upon them by the very logic of
events:
The progress of concentration waa not the work
of the Pope; it was brought about by the change
of times and the vicissitudes of nations. It was
Dot his fault that the Vandals swept away the
African sees and the Saracens those of Syria and
Asia Minor, or that, Constantinople "and its
dependencies became the creatures of im
perialism, or that France, l.nziand an.l Ger
many would obey none but the author of
their own Christianity, or that clergy and people
at a distance were obstinate in sheltering
themselves under the majesty of Rome against
their own fierce Kings and nobles or imperious
P. shops, even to the imposing of forgeries on the
world and on the Pope In justification of their pro
ceedings. All this will be {act whether the Popes
were ambitious or not; and still il will be fact
that the issue of that great change was a great ben
efit to the whole of Europe. No one but a Master,
who was a thousand Bishops in himself at once,
could have timed and controlled, as the Pope did,
the great and the little tyrants of the middle age.
3. This is generally confessed now, even by
Protestant historians, vis., that the concentration
of ecclesiastical power in those centuries was sim
ply necessary for the civilization of Europe. Of
course, it does not follow that the benefits ren
dered them to the European commonwealth by
the political supremacy of the Pope would, if he
was still supreme, be rendered in time to com".
I have no wish to make assumptions, yet conclu
sions short of this will be unfavorable to Mr.
Gladstone's denunciation of him. We reap the
fruit at -this day of his services in the past. With
the purpose of showing this I make a rather long
extract from Dean Milrnan's '-Latin Christian
ity." He is speaKing of the era of Gregory I, and
he says the papacy "was the only power which lay
not entirely and absolutely prostrate before the
disasters of the timesâ a power which had an In
herent strength and might resume its majesty. It
was this power which was most imperatively re
quired to preserve all which wts to survive out of
the crumbling wreck of Roman civilization.
To Western Christianity was absolutely necessary
a center, standing alone, strong In traditionary
reverence acd in acknowledged claims to suprem
acy. Even the perfect organization of the Chris
tian hierarchy might. in all human probability,
have falleu to pieces in perpetual conflict : it might
have degenerated into a half secular feudal caste,
with hereditary beneficies more and more
entirely subservient to the civil authority,
a priesthood of each nation, or of each
tribe, gradually sinking to the intellectual
or religious level of the nation or tribe. On the rise
of a power both controlling and conservative hang,
humanly speaking, the life and death of Christi
anity as a permanent, aggressive, expansive, and,
to a certain extent, uniform system. There must
be a counter-balance to barbaric force, to the una
voidable anarchy of Teutonisro. with Us tribal, or
at the utmost national dependence, â  forming
a host of small, conflicting, antagonistic
kingdoms. All Kurope would have been
what England was under the Octarchy, what
Germany was when her Emperors were weak; and
even her Emperors she owed to Rome, to the
church, to Christianity. Providence might have
been otherwise ordained; but it is impossible for a
man to Imagine by what other organizing or con
solidating force the commonwealth of the Western
nations could have grown up to a discordant, in
deed, and conflicting league, but still a league,
with that unity and conformity of manners,
usages, laws, religions, which have made their
rivalries, oppugnancles, and even their long,
ceaseless wars, on the whole to issue In the
noblest, highest, most intellectual form of civiliza
tion known to man. It is impossible to conceive
what had been the confusion, the lawlessness, the
chaotic state of the middle aces, without the
medieval papacy; and of the medieval papacy the
real father is Gregory the Great. In all his prede
cessors there was much of the uncertainty and in
definiteness of a new dominionâ is the
Roman altogether mereed in the Christian Bishop.
It is a Christian dominion, of which he lays the
foundations In the Eternal City, not the old Rome,
associating Christian influence to her ancient title
of sovereignty."
THE NEW EMPIRE.
At the end of the eighth century Europe was
united in religion, but in civil affairs it was
divided into warring kingdoms. The example,
however, of an undivided church was insen
sibly leading the minds of men to a longing for
an undivided state. The memories of the old
empire had not passed away. Men looked to it
still as the noon of government. They remem
bered how it had spread all over the world and
had given the nations peace. When, therefore,
Charlemagne had obtained possession of the
old dominions of the Empire of the West it
was but the logical sequence of events
that he should assume the imperial
crown. That crown was bestowed upon
him by the Pope, but by what right
no one then cared to ask. All fiurope accepted
the lact that it was now organized in tem
porals under the Emperor; in spirituals under
the Pope. It was to be henceforth a great
Christian commonwealth. Men knew nothing
about our modern theories of church and
state. Their Ideas of thines were as different
from ours as they possibly could be. They
builded according to their own plans, and we,
who believe in popular sovereignty, have no
right to quarrel with their efforts.
FEUDALISM.
After the death of Charlemagne the empire
which he had built up was delivered over to
anarchy. His successors were too feeble to
wield his scepter and new barbarians poured
down from the north. Then grew up the sys
tem known as feudalism. Its origin is lost in
obscurity.but the traits which distinguished it
in its supremacy can be traced in the manners
and customs of the Teutonic tribes which
invaded the Roman empire. The essen
tial features of feudalism may be summed
op m the statement that the land of a
country was bestowed by the supreme
ruler on individuals who in return contracted
to perform certain services to the grantor, gen
erally of a military kind. These original
grantees subdivided the land to othen on
similar conditions. Thus a thoroughly graded
hierarchy grew up, beginning with the king
and ending with the smallest landholder,
which was intended to secure protection and
safety on the one side and loyalty, allegiance
and stipulated service on the "other.
"This system," says Stille, "it must be re
membered, was no ingenious and speculative
device, as it has often been represented, to re
duce the population of those countries living
under its slavery; but it was eagerly adopted
by those who had an interest in the preserva

lion of order, not merely as a method of
counteracting the anarchy which then threat
ened the overthrow of ail sett'ed society, but
also, and especially, as the only effectual
method at repelling the armed Invasion of the
barbarians, and especially of the Northmen,
which began again shortly after the death
of Charlemagne. In one sense the feudal
system was an endeavor to combine military
efficiency with the spirit of independence on
the part of the chiefs which was so character
istic of the German warriors in their native
lands. The object, now, however, of the rulers
âthe immediate objectâ was defense of their
homes, not to send out. expeditions such as
those undertaken in the campaigns under
Charlemagne. We shall see that, as a
system, the feudal form of government,
arbitrary and oppressive as we may
think it, was in the beginning a necessity
of the time. One of the best proofs
that it was such is found in its universal adop
tion throughout Europe. Not only land but
other kinds of property, even offices in church
and state, were held in fief with a view to
protection. We must remember that after the
death of Charlemagne there existed for a long
time no public authority in Europe strong
enough to maintain order through
out a large territory, and that each
chief, who hid formerly been, perhaps,
under the rule of the great Emperor, a
firm supporter of his system and authority,
now freed from his control, sought only to in
crease his own lands and power. The result
was a perpetual reign of terror, a constant
struggle for those objects where might made
right, the end of which was the survival of the
strongest and during which the successful pur
suit of the arts of peace became impossibleâ a
condition of things which if continued clearly
foreshadowed a relapse into barbarism."
THE POPE AXD THE EMPEROR.
Let us always bear in mind that the imperial
and feudal constitution of Europe was a sys
tem of universal government as distinct as our
Federal and State system. The limits of the
I various authorities were not as clearly de
lineated as by our constitution, but then we
are the heirs oi all the ages, and the men of
I old were struggling toward the better things.
But as far as it went it was a system or govern
ment with its own laws, customs, rights and
i duties. Therefore, when we judge of the ac
: tions of Popes who lived under that system
laud who had a definite place in it, we must
judge them not in the lignt of our day, but in
the light of a civil polity which was univer
sally accepted in the middle age.
And in the first place let us consider in the
words of Freeman that "The theory of the
â medeval empire is that of an universal
Christian monarchy. The Roman Empire and
I the Catholic church are two aspects of the one
society. At the head of this society in its
temporal character as an empire stands' the
temporal chief of Christendom, the Roman
\ Caesar; at its head, in its spiritual character as
i a church, stands the spiritual chief of christen-
I dom, the Roman Pontiff."
Now, by the consent of Christendom, it was
j necessary that the Emperor should be a Chris
! tianâa member of the church. When he was
! excommunicated he ceased to be a member of
I the church, and his subjects considered that
j they were released from their bonds of al
â  legiance. The rope, the supreme head of
i the church, formally declared that the Em
i peror was or was not a member of the church,
and hence came what is technically known as
i the deposing power, or the power of" absolving
I subjects from their oaths of fealty.
| On this provision of the medeaval constitu
; tion of Europe let me remark that it is analo
â¢ gous to the provision of our constitution, which
| requires that a State shall maintain a republi
can form of government. As long as the State
| of California cleaves to the republican system
! the President cannot interfere; but if she
I should attempt to establish a monarchy
I the United States Government would take
; measures to prevent the success of such
lan undertaking. Much in the same
I way it was the constitution of meaeval
I Europe that the emperor should be a Chris
! tian. As long as he was a Christian and lived
j like a Christian the Pope had no power over
! him. But once he rendered himself liable by
crime to excommunication, the Pope had
I power to declare him expelled from the church
| and unworthy of the support of Christians.
Let us remark, too, that this system lasted
only as long as the peoples wished it to last.
When we read of Hildebrand and Innocent re
buking Emperors and Kings and bringing
ihem to terms, we make a mistake if we look
upon these Popes as the masters of legions.
; They had no temporal resources worth noticing.
1 The legions were at the call of their enemies.
' Gregory was driven a fugitive before the armies
!of the Emperor and he died in exile. Yet
Gregory triumphed. And why? He had the
people with him. They believed in upholding
their constitution, and when the Emperor
i broke that constitution and the Pope pro
! claimed the fact the people brought their chief
to terms.
When, therefore, after the Crusades the sen
timent of nationality grew stronger and Europe
began to take the form it now holds the old
constitution was neglected. Consequently we
i find the people no longer supporting the Pop 3,
and consequently, too, we find the deposing
poÂ»ver as it was exercised in the middle ages
repudiated by Catholics.
A QUOTATION GARBLED.
As I am on this point I may as well call at-
I tention to another characteristic misrepre-
I sentation of those who attack the church. One
of the knights of the scissors said in a recent
letter:
"The following from an address delivered by
Pope Pius IX., of infallibility fame, July 21,
1573, is pertinent:
There are many errors regarding infallibility;
but the most malicious of all is that which Includes
I in that dogma the rfgbt of deposing sovereigns,
and declaring the people no longer bound by the
obligation of fidelity. This right has cow and
a:a:n. in critical circumstances, been exercise.! by
the Pontiffs. * * * Its origin was not the infal
libility, but the authority of the Pope.
Let me say that this address was delivered
on July 20, 1871, and the true text is as
follows:
"Among all other errors that is malicious
above all, which would attribute to the In
fallibility of the Pope the right of deposing
I sovereigns and of absolving people from the
I obligation of allegiance.
'â¢This right without doubt has been exercised
j by the Supreme Pontiffs from time to time in
extreme cases, but it has nothing to do with
! the Pontifical Infallibility; neither does it flow
| from the infallibility but from the authority of
i the Pontiff."
Now this is the portion of the address which
j the champions of American institutions
i suppress.
â¢â¢Moreover, the exercise of this right in these
! apes of faith which respected in the Pope that
j which he isâ that is to say, the Supreme Court
of Christendom, and recognized the benefit of
his tribunal in the great contentions of
peoples and of sovereigns, was freely extended
by the just aid of public jurisprudence and the
common consent of nations to the greatest in
terests of states and their rulers." Let these
fair-minded "Americans" now mark what
follows :
"But altogether different are the conditions
of the present time from the conditions of
those ages. Malice alone can confound things
so diverse."
That is to say, the Pope recognizes that the
old constitution of Christian Europe passed
away long ago and the powers once given the
Pope by the consent of the peoples are no
longer claimed.
THE POPE AND FEUDALISM.
The essential feature of feudalism is, as I
have said, that a man constitutes a more pow
erful person his protector by promising feudal
service. Now, during the middle ages it was
customary for weaker Princes to promise
feudal service to the Pope in the expectation
of gaining his protection.
Now, whether it was wise or not for the
Pope to accept this service I do not care to dis
cuss here. I wish to draw attention merely to
the fact. The advantages gained therefrom
were entirely on the King's side. The Pope
never received anything but the customary in
significant tokens of feudal homage. Still they
were bound to help and protect their feuda
tories, and the giving of this h^lp and protec
tion was the cause of half the quarrels of the
middle ages.
But this relation was entirely political and
had nothing whatsoever to do with the Pope's
spiritual character. It ceased to exist when
feudalism was abolished, and there is as much
chance of reviving it now as there is of resusci
tating the mummy of Rameses.
A clear understanding of these two great
facts in the constitution of the States of the
middle ages will explain all the charges
which are brought against the church to-day,
because of the actions of certain Popes. These
actions were lawful, because they were pro
vided for in the civil laws of the time and were
received by the people. They would not be
lawful to-day, because the conditions of the
middle ages have passed away and these ex
traordinary powers nave passed with them.

BOWMAN TO YORKE.
The A. P. A. Editor Advances More
Arguments In Support of His
Contentions.
The following letter, addressed to The
Call, is self-explanatory:
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir: The
sudden development in almost incredible
numbers all over the country oi that un
known quantity called the A. P. A. has
awakened a widespread alarm in the Roman
Catholic Church, and attracted the general
attention ot the press, both secular and relig
ious. With eager scrutiny the politicians are
watching whatever can be seen of this new
and singular movement with regard to its
bearing upon the current politics of the coun
try, ready to trim their sails to whatever
breezes its progress may awaken. Thinking
Americans are asking, What are the objects
of this unheralded organization, which is
sweeping this land like the shadow of an
eclipse? How came it into existence? Are
there any potent reasons for the existence of
such an organizationâ while the general
public are acquainted with the fact that
it aims directly at restricting and
countervailing the aggressive power ot the
Romish hierarchy in our civil, political and
educational particularly as related to
our public school systemâ it is not so fully
known that Rome has organized her hordes
for the suDjugation of our country. The A.
P. A. was born of necessity. It was not begotten
of bigotry, and born of hate, as Rome claims;
but, contrarywise, it was begotten of pat
riotism, hence is the legitimate child of
Americanism. Romanism is the open foe of
the American Republic. By Jesuitical craft
and political intrigue it has"sought to under
mine our constitutional liberties. It has
attempted to muzzle the press, gag the pulpit
and silence the platform. It has made an !
aggressive assault upon our public school sys- !
tern. It has attempted to Romanize our schools I
by having nuns for teachers. It has sought
their destruction by clamoring for State funds
to run their sectarian schools. 1 1 has plundered
the State and National treasuries of millions
of dollars for sectarian purnoses It has tried
to unite church and state.* It has maintained
principles contrary to those of this Republic.
It has denied the right of free speech and the
liberty of worship guaranteed to us by the con
stitution. The A. P. A. come before the Ameri
can people and make the following declara
tion :
No devout Roman Catholic can |bo a true
American citizen.
In order for me to prove this charge it will
be necessary to expose the principles of
Romanism, which are in conflict with Ameri
can principles.
Firstâ Political principles: Romanists owe
their first allegiance to the Pope of Rome. For
thirteen centuries the Popes have interfered
in the political affairs of nations, and all de
vout Papists have sided with the Pope and
against the Government. Below we submit
some of the authoritative statements of Romish
writers. De Pratt says:
"The Pope commands subjects on the terri
tory of all sovereigns. If the whole world were
Catholic the Pope would command the whole
world." Bellarmine observes :
The first opinion Is: That the Pope, by divine
right, has supreme power over the whole world,
both in ecclesiastical and civil affairs. This Is the
opinion of Panormitanus, Hostieasis, Silvester and
many others.
It is not right for Christians (Romanists) to tol
erate a heretical King if he endeavors to draw
away his subjects to heresy.
In support of this opinion the Cardinal !
counts seventy eminent Romish authors.
Augustine Triumphus says:
"It is an error not to believe that the Roman
Pontiff is |. as tor of the universal church, the suc
cessor of Peter, the Vicar of Christ, and that he
hath no: universal supremacy over temporal and
spiritual matters."
SaysÃlasias:
The Pope is the only vicar of God: his power is i
over all the world. pagan as well as Christian: the
only vicar of God who has supreme power and em
pire over all kings and princes of the earth.
Muscovius says:
The Pope is universal judge: he is king of kings I
and lora of lords. All other powers are his subjects.
Maynardus writes:
Magistrates are the Pope' 3 subjects. The Pope
has power in the whole world in temporals and
spirituals.
Bossuet declare?:
All things are submitted to the keys of St. Peterâ
all kings, people, shepherds and flocks.
The following tenets of canon law explain
his power:
The Pope has the right to give countries and na
tions which are non-Catholic to Catholic regents,
who can reduce them to slavery. The Pope can
make slaves of those Christian subjects whose
prince or ruling power is interdicted by the Pope.
The Pope has the right to annul .-tate laws, treat
ies, constitutions, etc. : to absolve from obedience
thereto, as soon as they seem detrimental to the
rights of the church or those of the clergy. The i
Pope possesses the right of admonishing, and, if i
needs be, of punishing: the temporal rulers, em. i
perors and kings, as well as of drawing before the
spiritual forum any casein which a mortal sin oc- |
curs. The Pope has the right to absolve from oaths j
and obedlece to the persons and the laws of the j
princes whom he excommunicates. The Pope can
release from every obligation, oath, tow, either be
fore or after being made.
Cardinal Manning, in a printed sermon, says : i
Why should the Holy Father touch any matters
in politics at all? For this plain reason, because
politics are a port of morals. Politics are morals
on the widest scale.
Pope Pius IX asserted to himself the right to
annul constitutions and laws of certain coun- |
tries, viz.: New Grenada in 1852, of Mexico
in 1556, of Spain 1855 and of Austria in 1863. !
See Acerbissimum, September 27,1352; Nun- j
guam Fore, December 15, 1556; Nemo Vest
rum, July 24, 1555; AUocutio Nunquam
Certe, June 22, l^t>3.
Pope Leo claims the same power, as the fol
j lowing article will prove:
We command all whom it concerns to recog
nize in you (Francisco satolll), as Apostolic Able
(fate, the supreme power ot" the delegating Pontiff. !
We command that they give you aid, concurrence <
and obedience in all things: that they receive with
reverence your salutary admonitions and orders.
Whatever sentence or penalty you shall duly de
clare or inflict against those who oppose our au
thority we will ratify, and, with the authority
given us by the Lord, will cause to be observed in
violably until condign satisfaction be made; * * *
notwithstanding constitutions and apostolic ordi
nances or other to the contrary. [Extract, from the
encyclical of Pope Leo XIII to the papal clergy in
the United States, January 24, 1892.]
Vicar-General Preston, in a sermon preached i
in New York in 1888, spoke most plainly on !
this subject. He declared:
Kvery word Leo speaks from his chair Is the I
voice of the Holy Ghost, and mast be obeyed. To
every Catholic heart comes no thought but obedi
ence. It is said that politics is not within the
province of the church, and that thechurch has
only jurisdiction In matters of faith. You say, '-I j
will receive my faith from the Pontiff, but i will j
not receive my politics from him." This assertion '
Is disloyal and unfaithful. You must not think ad
you choose; you must think as Catholics. The j
man who says, "I will take my faith from Peter, i
but I will not take my politics from Peter." |
Is not a true Catholic. The church teaches that '
the supreme Pontiff must be obeyed because he :
is the vicar of the Lord: Christ speaks through i
him.
The Pope, in an encyclical in 1864, men
tioned several errors of our times, among
which he specified this:
The church has not the power of availing herself \
of force, or any direct or indirect temporal power.
Dr. Brownson, in his Review in 1864, frankly i
said:
Undoubtedly it Is the Intention of the Pope to
possess this country. In this Intention he Is aided '
by the Jesuits and all the Catholic prelates and
priests.
The great historian Froude, who has lately j
passed away, has given his view of the great |
danger of our Nation. 1 give a passage from i
his pen, which should be pondered:
Every true Catholic Is bound io think and net as '
the priest tells him, and a. republic of true Catholics
becomes a theocracy administered by the clergy.
it is only as long a* they are in a small minority
that they can be loyal subjects under such a con- I
stitution as the American. As their numbers grow i
they will assert their principles, then the power,
and the constitution will be gone. A Catholic ma- j
jority under spiritual direction will forbid liberty I
of worship, and will try to forbid liberty of con
science. It will control education; it will put the
press under surveillance; it will punish opposition
with excommunication, and excommunication will |
be attended with civil disabilities.
To illustrate the attitude of modern Roman
ists in their divided allegiance between the j
Pope and the Government, we will cite the fol- ;
lowing facts. In 1843 Daniel OConnell said:
I declare my most unequivocal submission to
the head of the Church, and to the hierarchy in
Its different orders. If the Bishops would make a i
declaration on this bill, I never would be heard i
speaking against it. bnt would submit at once, un- j
equivocally, to that decision. They have only to '
decide and they clog* my mouth. They have only j
to determine, ana I obey. I wish It to be understood
that such is the duty of all Catholics.
An English paper, the Catholic Vindicator,
made the Romanist's duty clear in these words: :
We would not hesitate to tell the Queen to her j
face that she must either be content with this
divided allegiance, or none at all; for It is per
fectly certain that we shall never do otherwise i
than strictly obey the sovereign Pontiff, whoever
may presume to forbid.
The attitude of Papists on the school ques
tion shows that the claim of only spiritual
authority for the Pope in the United States
rests upon a falsehood. The present inter
ference of the Pope is upon schools for educa
tion. The establishment of the schools is a |
civil matter. Teaching children to read and
write is a civil matter. The appointment of 1
of what books shall be read in schools
is a civil matter. It is as secular men
that patrons of the schools prescribe the
course of studies. Suppose they introduce an
offensive history, as has been done, into the j
schools, the Pope has nothing to do with it.
It is a matter of civil and domestic arrange
ment, with which no power, civil or sacred,
outsido the Republic, has a right to inter
meddle. Yet Pope Leo has intermeddledâ j
priests and Bishops have objected to various
books used in our schools and set aside the
laws of the land in obedience to the mandates
of the Pope. In a book entitled "Catholics I
and Education" the following statement is !
made:
If they leave It (education) to the States sepa
rately. Catholics in several of them are already a
powerful minority, daily increasing in strength t
and numbers, and will soon be strong enough to j
force the State Legislatures to clve them their I
proportion of the public schools supported at the I
public expense. (.Pa*:* 105.)

; owes no allegiance to any principle of the Govern
ment which Is condemned by the church or Pope. !
(H. c. Tablet.)
If allegiance to the church demanded of us op
position to political principles adopted by our civil
government, we should not hesitate to obey the
church. (Catholic World.
we are purely and simply Catholics, and profess
our unreserved allegiance to the church, which
taues precedence or, and gives the rule to our al
legiance to the State. (Catholic World.)
â Such declarations and such principles are in
direct conflict with American principles. If
politics constitute the only religion of Rome,
then this is a religious controversy ; but if not,
then it is a political discussion on the ground
of political expediency. The A. P. A. Is not or
ganized to combat religious worship, but per
nicious political principles. Let Priest Yorkc
face the issue and define the true attitude of
Rome on the school question.
Second â The principles of honor underlying
the profession of loyalty to the state. The Re
vised Statutes of the United States declare:
The alien seeding citizenship must make oath to
renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, in
particular that, to which he has been subject.
The obligation of the oath of allegiance to
the United States by a foreign Papist can be
measured by the following teachings of the
Church of Rome upon oath::.
I "No oaths are to be kept if they are against
the interests of the Church of Rome."â Corpus
I Juris Canouici, Leipsic cd. 1839, p. 1159.
"Subjects are by no authority bound to ob
serve the fealty which they swear to a Chris
tian prince who withstands God and the
faints, and their precepts."â PoDe Urban II
(anno 1088.1â [Corpus Juris Canon a Petro
Pittseo et Francisco, Vol. 1, Paris. 1695.]
"None should keep faith with the person who
opposes God and his saints."â Pope Gregory
IX. [Decretals Greg. IX, Vol. 1, p. 648.]
Pope Innocent 111, 1215, "freed all that were
Dound to those who had fallen into heresy
from all fealty, homage and obedience."â[Mid
dle Ages, Hallam, p. 295.] "Engagements
made with heretics, or schismatics of this Kind,
after such have been consummated, are incon
siderate, illegal and in law itself are of i;o
importance, even if confirmed by an oath or
one's honor being pledged." â Urban VI,
1378. "Civil contracts, promises or oaths of
Catholics with heretics, because they are
heretics, may be dissolved by the Pontiff."â
Pope Innocent X.
The third council of Lateran called "an oath
contrary to ecclesiastical utility not an oath,
but a perjury." Gregory IX inserted this
decretal of the Lateran council in his decretals.
V 01.2, page 358.
Here are some extracts from the canon law:
"An oath contrary to the utility of the church
is not to be observed." â{Vol. 2, p. 358, decretal
Gregory IX, lib. 2, tit. 24, cap. 27, Leipsic,
1839.] â  â 
Again this canon law says : "These are to be
called perjuries rather than oaths which are
attempted against ecclesiastical utility." Ibid.
"You are not bound by an oath of this kind,
but, on the contrary, you are freely bid God
speed in standing up against kings for the
rights and honors of that church and even in
I legislatively defending your own peculiar
privileges." [Decrct. Greg. IX, lib. 2, tit. 24, cap. !
31, vol. 2. p. 380.1
The celebrated Romish writer, Cajetan, says:
"The sentence of excommunication "for
apostasy from the faith is no sooner pro
nounced against a king than in fact his sub-
I jects are freed from his dominion on oath."
"When a kin? is excommunicated for apos-
I tasy his vassals are, in fact, immediately freed
from his dominion and from their oath of
fealty, for a heretic cannot govern the faith
fal."â Thomas Aquinas.
Now we submit some facts for patriots to
! ponder.
Fact No. I.â The canon law of the Roman
church is still binding upon all Romanists.
All of the constitutions, decretals, bulls and
canons are accepted as of infallible authority.
Every priest and Bishop in the United states
swears that he will defend and support the
Pope's regali, that is the sovereign pretensions
of the Popes and their successors. We will
give some clauses in the Bishop's oath show
ing their allegiance to a foreign power:
Papatum Romanum et' I will help them to de-
Regalia Sancti Petrl ad- fend the Roman Papacy

Thus every bishop is forced to promise fealty
to the Pope, and that fealty (fldeiitas) is de
tined hy ancient writers as the allegiance that
a good subject owes to his prince. What are
the royalties of St. Peter that they promise to
support and defend 7 I will quote from
Baronius' Annals:
PolHlcum principal There can be no
tnm sacerdotall esse sub- doubt that the political
jectum nuila potest esse ; power Is subject to the
dutjituUo. j sacerdotal.
Hence it is the duty of priests and bishops to
bring the temporal power under subjection to
the spiritual. In the bull of Pope Sixtus V
against Henry, King of Navarre, it is said:
The authority given to St. Peter and his succes
sors by the Immense power of the eternal King
| excels all the rowers of earthly kings and princes.
We deprive them and their posterity forever of
their dominions and kingdoms. By the authority
of these presents we do absolve and set free all
' persons, as well jointly as severally, from any
: such oath, and from all allegiance whatever. In re
gard to dominion, fealty and obedience; and do
j charge and forbid all and every of them that
I they do not dare to obey them, or any of their art
! monitions, laws and commands.â Bulla Siitl V.
; contr. Henry Navarre, etc.
Pope Leo has the same power, or he has
I not. Either the Popes have transgressed the
limits of their power, or they have not. It is
trie duty of Romanists to obey the Pope in such
cases, or it is not. Either the canon law of
Rome is a fallible piece of legislation and may
beset aside with impunity, or else it is of
binding force to-day, and all Romanists are
under obligations to believe and obey it.
Either the Church of Rome, as represented by
her Popes and councils, has erred and proved
herself fallible, or Peter C. Yorte must hold
that the chair of the President is subject to
the crosier of the priest, and the decrees of the
Vatican more or Peter C. Yorke must hold
: the chair of the President Is subject to
crosier of the priest, and the decrees of the
ican of more force than those of Congress.
There is no medium. I put him upon either
horn of the dilemma; if be will not stick on
one I will pitch him upon the other. He must
either admit that his church, as represented by
Popes and General Councils, has failedâ has
decreed and pronounced what is inconsistent
with the Catholic laith, as It is injurious to the
rights of nations, the power of sovereigns, and
to be repudiated by him and every loyal Roman
Catholic citizen, or he must stand by his prin
ciples and acknowledge himself prepared to
sene the spiritual sword of Rome, and to make
the temporal sword of the United Stages sub
ject and obedient to it.
Pope Boniface VIII has this decree in the
canon law:
One sworJ must be under the other sword, and
temporal authority must be subject to spiritual
power. â¦ * * /Whence, if the earthly authority
go wrong, it sftall be judged by the spiritual.
â [Extrav. Lomm., p. 1159.]
If Romanists adhere to their established
maxim, established not by private men but by
public council, that "No faith is to be kept
with heretics," then they can give no assurance
of allegiance to our Government. Their oaths
are not binding, their pledges are null, their
assurances void. The Pope can dispense
from all oaths and make them null and
void. The power of aispensing with an
oath, vow or promise is one branch
of the spiritual power of the Pope, and all who
acknowledge his spiritual power must ac
knowledge this. But. to grant this power to the
Pope is to make your oath of allegiance to the
Government invalid. If the priest can pardon
all sins he can pardon both perjury and high
treason; hence, the Romanist may declare his
allegiance at one time, and break it at another,
under plea of ecclesiastical utility.
In a tuture contribution we will give some
more reasons why the A. P. A. opposes Roman
ism. H. W, Bowman.
MR. HITTELL'S REPLY.
The Author of the "Spirit of the
Papacy" Takes Exception to
Father Yorke's Charge of
Forgery.
The following communication, by Mr.
Hittell, in reply to Father Yorke, has been
cent to The Call:
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sir: In the communications of the Rev. Mr.
I Wendte and the Rev. Father Yorke, published
! in your columns this morning, I am called
upon to verify some quotations in my "Spirit of
the Papacy ' from St. Thomas Aquinas and In
! noeent 111, to prove that the Popes claimed
I temporal jurisdiction over national govern
i ments. In his characteristic way Father Yorke
says of these quotations; "Hittell has been
guilty of forgery." It this judgment hurts its
I author lass than it does me in a community
! wnere I have lived more than forty years, I
i should be the object of his pity rather ihan the
victim of his scurrility.
j The doctrine of Aquinas is that "the power
j of all temporal princes derives its strength and
| solely from the spiritual power of the
j ropes, and I refer to Boellineer, "Fables Re
â  specting the Popes of the Middle Ages" (Eng
llsa translation), page 153. I might haveeited
also Gregorovius' "History of Medieval Rome"
in German, page 117. vol. VI. I did not reier to
the Latin of Aquinas, because the book iÂ« rare
and the general readers for whom my treatise
was, mteu-led could not verify theaccuracv of
my citation. My forgery consists in quoting
word for word, from Doellinger in the English
In regard to the language of Innocent 111 I
"ted Wanus" page 133; it should have been
ii><. Has book, DoelliugerandGreeorovius, all
6tand very high among scholars. The super
national claims of Gregory VII, Gregory ix
Gregory X and Paul IV are plainly stated in
"Janus."
Let it be remembered that these declarations
of Aquinas and Innocent 111 are relatively in
significant matters; the main facts are the
actions in which such ideas were illustrated.
Looking more to what the Popes did than to
what they said, we find that" they published
bulls deposing more than a dozen different
sovereigns, including some of England, France,
Germany, Naples, Hungary and Bavaria; that
they required half a dozen different sovereigns
to do homage a^ vassals to the papacy; that
they repeatedly issued bulls nullifying treaties,
national constitutions and national laws,
and that the history of every century since the
crusades abounds with acts which imply the
claim of authority over all national Christian
governments. All these points are presented
distinctly In my "Spirit of the Papacy." in
noticing which the Westminster Review of
August last says it "has piled up systematically
every possible" charge against the papacy, and
has supported its accusations with abundant
authority."
Having responded to the demands made upon
me in your columns and having said all that I
care say in reply to Father Yorke's abuse, I
now turn to another point, and that is, Mr.
Editor, to congratulate you upon your course
in giving space to the discussion of the in
fluence of the papacy upon the welfare of
nations and the intelligence of mankind. The
objection that such controversy provokes Ill
feeling seems to me feeble. Truth and free
dom have made many of their most important
advances by the help of strife. Great abuses
are not corrected without offense to their bene
ficiaries and to the dupes of these benefici
aries, and one of tne greatest abuses of our
time is the sacerdotal fraud which is here
under discussion. The people learn something
from your columns every day; they are being
trained to investigate and to think for them
selves. It is a good work. Jons b. Hittell.

NOT THE SAME DEAN.
The Forger Arrested in I'tiea, X. T.,
Will Not Be Brought Here
for Trial.
Captain Lees received a dispatch yester
day from the Pinkerton detective agency,
Chicago, that Henry E. Desmaries, the
former arrested in Utica, N. V., on Friday,
would be tried in Chicago and requesting:
him to forward the forged check for $ISOO
on the Anglo-Californian Bank of this
City.
"I am thoroughly satisfied," said the
captain, "that there is no connection be
tween A. H. Dean, the forger who got
away with $20,000 from the Nevada Bank,
and the forger arrested in Utica.
"The fact of Desmaries having used the
name H. Dean is simply one of those re
markable coincidences that lead people to
believe that truth is stranger than fiction.
It is, of course, possible that Desmaries
may have met A. H. Dean after being re
leased from Quentin last November,
and the name might have suggested it-< ::'
to him, but I don't think eren that is
possible.
"I am glad Desmaries is to be tried in
Chicago, as it will save up the expense of
bringing him here for trial and keeping
him for the next fourteen years."
BUTTFS DEPOT SITE.
A Montana Railroad Cage Appealed
From Judge Beatty's Decision.
The controversy between the Montana
Central Railroad Company and A. F.
Migeon, B. Tibbey and N. B. Ringiling, in
volving the title to the railroad's passen
ger depot site in Butte, Mont., has been ap
pealed to the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals from the decision rendered by
Judge Beatty in the railroad"s favor last
June. A transcript was filed yesterday.
( Several mining claims had been located
on the property in dispute, all more or
I Ipss overlapping. Among these were the
j Morning Â£tar lode claim, the John
Knowles piacer claim and the Childe Har
old lodeciaim, and the railroad company
had purchased the Knowles claim.
Judge Beatty's opinion was to the effect
that the testimony of the witnesses in the
case had been to create the impression that
Butte City had been practically covered
by a blanket of mining claims by persons
who hoped ultimately to urilize them for
town lots for tneir "surface or real estate
value, and who did not attach any particu
lar importance to their mineral values. On

THE CHUTES TO-DAY.
They Will Reopen With Added Ze*
After the Late Rain.
The water chutes out on Haight street
have had a damp time during the week,
and since last Sunday the grounds have
been closed. But if the weather is in the
slightest degree propitious everything
wiil be opened up this afternoon and
"chute shooters" can enjoy themselves to
their utmost, ana devotees of the new
sport of "tripping the trolley" will have an
opportunity of further investigating this
newly inaugurated amusement.
As an especial sensation Miss Millie
Viola, whose proposed trip over Niagara
Falls in a barrel has already been spoken
of in The Call, will make a balloon ascen
sion and parachute drop. Her sister,
Essie, gave a most successful performance
of the same character two weeks ago, and
Miss Millie promises to excel her, as she
does trapeze work, and wants to take her
parachute drop hanging by her toes.
No female aeronaut has ever done gym
nastic work while making an ascension or
drop in this City before, all of them being
content to sit in slings, and some even
being tied on to a trapeze. This girl's
daring, however, is something wonderful,
ana she promises a revelation in aerial
navigation.
CONCERNING DIAMONDS,
Millions Paid by Americans in Duties
on the Precious Stones.
There are perhaps 8000 dealers in dia
monds in the world, who carry in their
stock stones worth perhaps $350,000,000.
The remainder are in the hands of private
individuals. There is always something
fascinating about the subject of diamonds,
and rich and poor lise to read about
precioux stones. It is estimated that dur
ing the last twenty-five years the Ameri
can people have paid duty on at least $180,
--000,000 worth of diamonds and other
precious stones. In i 893 alone they im
ported $15,203,563 worth, but in 1894 there
was a falling off, owing to the hard times,
and the total was only $4,5.->6,9*5. This
does Dot include uncut diamonds, of which
we imported more than ?1. 000,000 worth in
1892, $.SOO,OOO worth in 1893 and* $566,267
worth in 1-
During the last twenty-two years we
have imported $7,087,817 worth of uncut
diamonds. In 18*0 we imported only
$129,000 worth of uncut diamonds, and in
1889 only s worth. The large in
crease of late has been due to the fact that
a number of American jewelers have
opened diamond-cutting establishments.
There are now fifteen establishment" in
the United States, which employ from one
to twenty men. There are 4000 manu
facturers in Europe and about l! 00 in the
United States, who employ between 7000
'X) persons as cutters and polishers.
Perhaps 28,000 people are employed in
the diamond mines throughout the world.
We read that in past centuries 60. 0 X)
people were working in some single Indian
mines at one time, and perhaps that state
ment is not exaggerated, since by the aid
of modern machinery one miner can now
accomplish as much as twenty who used
the primitive methods. The total value of
ail the diamonds in the world undoubtedly
exceeds $I,ooo,ooo,ooo.â Jewelers' Review.

THE POOLROOM EVIL.
The Civic Federation Will Hold a Ui X
Mass-Meeting TÂ«-I)Â»y.
The Civic Federation has taken up the
fight against the poolroom evil in earnest,
and to-day a bis mass-meeting will be held
in Odd Fellows' Hall at 3 p. m. to consider
the matter and devise ways and means for
suppressing the evil. A call has been
issued inviting the public in general to
attend, and all of the city ministers have
been requested to urge upon their con
. nous tho importance of a large at
tendance. In this invitation Thomas
. of the special committee says:
It is not needful to emphasize with you the
menace to the morals of the community, es
pecially of our young men and boys, presented
Â«y this evil as rampant among us. The ex
isting laws seem unequal to grapple with the
situation; new and sweeping ordinances are
needed for its extermination, and it is in
tended by this meeting to voice a sentiment
nearly unanimous in the city against the evil,
ana to demand the passage ox an ordinance for
its suppression.
Dr. Carlos Martyn of Chicago will be one
of the speakers to address the gathering,
lie has been prominently engaged in
simi ar reform movements in the East,
and has made a special study of the pool
room evil since he has been'here. Other
wcll-^nown speakers will also present
their views.
THE CHARGES UNTRUE
Evan Williams Exonerated
From a Serious Accu
sation.
AN INVESTIGATION MADE.
The Court Records Show Him to
Be Entirely Free From
Fault.
As the policy of The Call is to be as just
as it is critical it is but fair that misstate-
menis be corrected with the 6ame readi
ness with which they are published, not
withstanding that at the time of their ap
pearance they may be believed to be true.
In a city of 350,000 inhabitants it is not
unusual that the haste necessary in com
piling a daily paper will result in mistakes
that would not occur were it possible to
give them more extended attention.
It is in this spirit and with this refer
ence to the fallibilities of newsgathering
that we now direct attention to prominent
articles in The Call of the 26th and 27th
of last month, both relating to the suit of
M. W. Fox against the management of the
Hule & Norcross Mining Company and
others connected with that company's
litigation, and both alluding, in terms of
special severity, to Mr. Evan Williams, who
was connected with the milling of a por
tion of the ores of that corporation at the
time certain irregularities are alleged to
have taken place. The articles embraced
little beyond the unsupported statements
made by M. W. Fox to a Call reporter.
In those articles Mr. Williams is accused
not only of converting to his own use
wagon-loads of bullion belonging to the
stockholders of the Hale and Xorcross
mine, of carrying a key to the Carson
branch mint, of procuring the illicit coin
ape of thousands of silver dollars, of
stifling investigation and of numerous col
lateral crimes, but inferentially of em
ng a thug of unnamed nationality to
sinate the man who was piously bent
on exposing his misdemeanors.
These articles having come to the atten
tion of Mr. Williams, and it appearing
that there was a disposition in unfriendly
quarters to discuss the charges seriously,
he recalled our attention to them, and as
a simple act of justice requested us to ex
amine the court and other records in the
case and ascertain the full extent to which
our reporter had been misled through the
statements of Mr. Fox.
In fairness we could not do otherwise
than comply with the request of Mr. Wil
liams. The charges were serious. They
attacked the reputation of a gentleman
who for more than thirty years had com
manded the respect and confidence of ihe
people of Nevada, which has been hi*
place of residence. These charges had
been given to the public through the col
umns of The Call, unaccompanied by any
expressed doubt of their accuracy, and
duty to our many readers no leas than to
Mr. Williams impelled us to undertake the
investigation.
And now, having completed an examina
tion of ail the records in the case, we freely
admit that they afford no ground for
any one of the charges made against Mr.
Williams as published in The Call of the
26th and 27th of last month, and in the ab
sence of any testimony in their support,
we are bound to believe them to be wholly
untrue.
FREIGHT RATE SITUATION
The Advance on Shipments for
New York to Be Made on
Wednesday.
General Manager Schwerin of the
Pacific Mail Asks Support for the
Panama Route.
The recently advanced eastbound rates
of 60 cents per 100 pounds via the Panama
route, instead of going into effect on the
steamer which leaves San Francisco on
January 28 are to be charged on ship
ments made on the City of Sydney, that
leaves next Wednesday or two days earlier
than the day on which the advanced over
land freight rates are put in force.
In view of the developments of the past
day or two there is no immediate pros
pects of westbound rates being changed
for at least a month to come, either by the
ali-rail or Panama route.
Shortly after the signing of the agree
ment between the Panama Railroad Com
pany and the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany the latter withdrew its three steamers
from the Atlantic seabord, and it then de
volved upon the Columbian live steamers,
owned by the Panama Railroad Company,
to handle all the freight offered at New
York for Central American ports as well
as for San Francisco. This they were un
able to do and in consequence E. 11. Hin
ton, the local general agent of the Panama
Kailroad Company, was compelled to
withdraw all quotations at this end for
westbound business. His company is now
in position to handle more of this business
and he is again quoting westbound rates
and engaging tonnage for westbound ship
ments.
it was generally supposed, particularly
after the eastbound rates had been ad
vanced, that the westbound rates would
undergo similar treatment, but according
to the statements of both the railroad peo
ple and the Panama Railroad representa
tive tnere is no immediate prospect of any
change. The same rates are now in force
that obtained before the Panama-Pacific
Mail agreement.
The recent manifesto of the Panama
Railroad Company to the effect that it pro
posed to maintain the Panama route as an
independent line and a genuine competi
tor of the transcontinental lines was con
siderable of a surprise to the larger ship
pers of the community, and they doubted
whether the Pacific Mail, controlled as it
was by C. I. Huntington, would co-oper
ate in the right spirit to this end. R. P.
Heinverin, general manager of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, when spoken to
on the subject said :
We shall be very glad to promote the
interests of snippets by the Panama route.
We ask their co-operation and assistance for
that route so as to Keep us running up to our
full facilities all the lime. J would like to see
the I'tinama route traffic developed to such an
extent that we would have to run a steamer
every four days.
The statement made by the Panama people
U correct. The Panama route is in actual com
petion with the transeontinenial lines. There
is no idea of putting in extortionate rates, but
to pat in such rates as will be remunerative to
the carriers. Under the old rates all the
transportation companies were losing money.
1 don't think any reasonable man would ex
pect the transportation companies to carry
their freight at a serious loss, and if they will
co-operate with the Panama route we will do
the best to co-operate with them.
The Columbia, a sister ship of the Peru, was
to leave Newport News on the 15th inst., and
the city of I'nra is to leave as soon after as they
could get her away, and both are to be placed
in service on this side between San Francisco
and Panama. It has been stated that we in
tended for a time at least to cease running
our .steamers regularly to Panama. This re
port was absolutely without foundation. The
Pacific Mail during the entire time that the
North American Navigation Company and the
Panama Railroad Company handled through
freight to New York has never ceased to run
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
its steamers to Panama and to handle freight
and passengers from the west coast of Mexico
and Central America, to its connections at
Panama, for New York, other Eastern or Eu
ropean points.
In conclusion Mr. Schwerin said that
he earnestly hoped that the producers and
merchants of California and of the whole
Pacific Coast would give their hearty co
operation to the interests and development
of the Panama route.
BORROMEAN COUNCIL.
The Mission Young Men Preparing for
an Entertainment Next Thurs
day Evening.
The Borromean Council, Y. M. 1., will
give an entertainment next Thursday
evening at the Mission Opera Hall. This
council is one of the strongest in the order,
its membership comprising some of the
brightest of the young men in the Mission
district.
One of the features of the evening will
be a burlesque on "Tiilby." The cast will
be made up exclusively of members of the
Borromean Council as follows:
ypven-erally Dr. J. P. McCarthy
i.ittle Pilly ....R. E. Fuzackerley
Larry J. J. C'orriÃan
TufTy R. J. Dowdall
Oetto J. M. Toner
Lll La n. J. Hoey
Key. Mr. Braggart P. F. Dillon
Drilby j. a. Riley
Mme. Vinyard K. J. Coffey
Mrs. Braggart K. J. Collonah
The Borromean Council was organized
six years ago and is now in a nourishing
condition. The charter members were
young men who resided at the Mission.
The early success of the council was due
in a great measure to the practical aid of
Itev. P. J. Cummins, pastor of St. Charles
Church, and Rev. r. E. Mulligan, his
assistant, now secretary to the Archbishop.
Thomas J. Lennon was the first presi
dent, and in succession Joseph A. Mclnnis,
John Riley, Rooert E. Fazackerley, Ed
ward J.Coffey, Dr. J. P. McCarthy and
Nicholas J. Hoey, the incumbent, have
guided the affairs of the council.
ITALIAN PAPERS AT WAR
La Voce del Popolo Denies a
Holocaust of Ten Thousand
Abyssinians.
L'ltalia Offers to Ret That Its
"Scoop" Is Correctâ The Bet
Accepted.
The Italian colony is stirred up over a
lively newspaper war between L'ltaliaand
La Voce del Popolo, which arose out of a
difference of opinion between the two es
teemed journals recarding 10,000 Abys
sinian s, more or less, massacred in a re
cent combat. L'ltalia has thrown down
the gauntlet of a $100 bet. La Voce has
snatched up the cartel, and now it only re
mains for a jury of prominent citizens to
decide whether L'ltalia or La Voce shall
make the poor of the colony richer by the
amount of the bet.
The controversy arose in this wise:
Last Thursday's issue of I'ltalia contained
a somewhat lengthy and exclusive tele
gram, dated January 13, which gave an
account of an assault on the fort of Ma
kalle. in Abyssinia, and stated that the
Italian troops had not only won a signal
victory, but that the Abyssinian? had left
10,000 dead and wounded on the field.
This news called forth the following
honeyed words in the Friday's issue of La
Voce: "Ten thousand dead and wounded.
Good gracious ! And to think that no tele
gr.iphic agency and no American paper
was cognizant of such important news.
A sprite whispers in our ear that the fa
mous telegram of our contemporary had
no source outside the editorial rooms on
Washington street, and no other scope
but to cive the editorial chief an opportun
ity of showing that he has studied in the
school of war.
"But to achieve this object, innocent in
itself, why send forth to the fray 10,000
At.yssinians? At this rate, and with a few
ott.er as homicidal telegrams, there would
not remain a single enemy for General
Baratiere to combat, when he finds it con
venient to move from Adigrat."
In Friday's issue L'ltalia, nothing
daunted by the sarcasm of its contempo
rary, repeated the story of the ten thou
sand dead, with added particulars. The
paper also contained an offer of $100 that
the news was correct, the jurors to be four
prominent citizens, two chosen by each
paper, and the $100 to be handed'to the
Italian Consul, for the benefit of the poor
of the colony.
The bet was accepted with alacrity, and
yesterday's issue of each paper expressed
confidence in the result of the arbitration.
La Voce does not believe it possible that
the Italian troops can be offering up such
holocausts of Abyssinians in the Dark
Continent. L'ltalia says its telegram
came via New York, and i 3 authentic. The
latter paper yesterday evening contained
tne following announcement in the largest
and most ornamental style of type: "The
day before yesterday's news "in L'ltalia
relative to the Slaughter of 10,000
Abyssinians by the Italian troops in re
pulsing an attack on Makalle has been
confirmed by the Italian Herald of New
York and the Italio-American of New
Orleans."
The Italia promises to give the jury
under the promise of secrecy the source
of its telegram, and both papers pledge
themselves to put up the $100, the loser
to give tho sum it wins to the poor. It is
probable that the jury will be appointed
to-morrow.
FOR SICK CHILDREN.
The Frawley Company Gives a Bene
fit for the Children's Hos
pital.
A thoroughly successful benefit per
formance of "The Jilt" was given yester
day afternoon at the Columbia Theater by
the Frawley Company. The total proceeds
of the performance, which amounted to
$670 45, are to go toward building a deaf
and blind ward for the Children's Hos
pital.
There was a large attendance and the
clever acting of the Frawley Company
aroused plenty of applause. Between the
first and second acts Little Mildred gave a
song and dance, "I'm Your Little Sweet
heart," and Miss Hope Itoss gave a clever
rendering of "Old Lang Syne" as a violin
solo.
The cast included such artists as Maclyn
Arbuckle, Wilson Enos, Charles W. King,
H. D. Blakemore, Daniel Frawley, George
W. Leslie, George Bosworth, Thomas A.
Phillips, Frank C. Thompson, Miss Lan
sing Rowan, Miss Blanche Bates, Miss
Phosa McAFlisterand Miss Hope Ross.
The performance was in every way
pleasing and satisfactory to the large audi
ence and aided a worthy cause as well.
MISS MERCER'S FREEDOM
She Is Loosed From the Bonds of a
Sham Marriage "Which Proved
Genuine.
Inez Mercer has had annulled the pe
culiar marriage which she contracted with
R. B. Westcott in Portland in May, 1895.
She and Westcott went through a mar
riage ceremony tor the ediiication of a few
friends gathered together for an evening's
enjoyment, but it was not until some time
after that sue learned that the marriaee
had been performed by a real minister un
der sanction of a genuine license and be
fore competent witnesses, and that she was
tied hard and fast to Westcott.
She came down here and sued for an an
nullment of the marriage on the ground of
fraud. Judge Slack granted her prayer.
THINK THEY WILL BUILD
S. C. Heilig and T. W. Enos
Have Five Propositions
for a Theater.
THEY WILL SUBMIT THEM.
The New Theater Will Hold at Least
2500 People and Have Three
Galleries.
S. C. Heilig of Portland, manager of the
Northwestern circuit of theaters, and T.
W. Enos, the Tacoma banker, who is
identified with the Eastern syndicate in
the ownership of most of the theaters, will
leave for home to-day.
During the two weeks they have been
here they have thoroughly looked up the
situation in reference to leasing or build
ing a theater in San Francisco.
One or the other is to be done, with
the chances decidedly in favor of the
latter.
They are carrying back with them, so
they say, to be submitted for the consid
eration of the capitalists owning the thea
ters, five different propositions from dif
ferent people here. One of them will be
decided upon, and then the theater people
C. HEILIG, MANAGER OF THE NORTIIWESTKRN' CIRCUIT OF THEATERS.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
of the Northwest will be in the field here
with Al Hayman & Co. and other man
agers.
They Fay they are not talking for effect
and express the desire that nothing of an
exaggerated character be stated, bin that
they mean exactly what they formerly
said when The Call announced their pur
poses.
The probabilty is now that they will
build here the finest theater in the "West.
The one in view is expected to cost about
$125,000, have three galleries and a seating
capacity of at least 2500 people. They
may build a larger and costlier theater
even than this.
"We have had five different propositions
submitted to us," said one of the gentle
men yesterday. "Oho was. first, from
capitalists here to build us a theater, we to
lease it for a period of years. Another was
from men who own the lots, for us to go
in with them and form a company and
take stock and build a theater. Another
proposition we are considering is the buy
ing of real estate outright ourselves and
erecting a theater, all with our own money.
Another proposition is a sort of combina
tion of one oi all of the3e, and the other is
in reference to leasing a theater.
"The last, by the way, is the least proba
ble of any. We feel that we must have a
new theater to enable us to take the posi
tion in the theatrical business on this
coast which we, in justice, should to make
our other investments profitable.
"One of the propositions which we have
is from men here to build a great Thespian
temple, costing .$300,000, that would hold
5000 or 6000 people. If we had a theater of
this kind the price of seats could be re
duced to as low as 75 cents or $1 each at
most. Probably we could go lower than
this, at least for certain entertainments.
"With such a large seating capacity we
could materially reduce prices. Besides
this, if Damrosch or any other men with a
big choral company wanted to come to
San Francisco he would find plenty of room
in such a theater. It would afford capacity
for any company or occasion.
"However, my own opinion is that a
theater with a seating capacity of 2500
people is about what is required. This
theater need not cost over ~ $125,000. It
would have three galleries, be modern in
every way and be a theater solely. There
would bo no offices or storerooms in the
building.
"The one we have in view would be
something near the size of Morosco's
Grand Opera-house, only constructed in
the modern style, and with a considerably
deeper stage.
"I have found here that taxes are very
low, as compared witii the north, and
that is something for investors to con
sider. A theater license, too, is only $100
a year here, whereas in Tacoma and Port
land it has been $250 a year at each place.
Water and electric light rates are" also
much lower here than there. The loca
tions submitted to us are admirable.
"Take it all in all the conditions are
very favorable. We only want to make 5
per cent, and we can do that very easily.
As to the money we represent being Van
derbilt money, it is not all that. We have
other money besides that. It is a strange
thing to me that you have no Eastern
money here. In Portland, Tacoma, Seat
tle, Spokane and Los Angeles it is nearly
all Eastern money that is invested, but
here you have none at all. San Francisco
is unique in that respect. The building
and other improvements are all with home
capital.
"Eastern investors are glad to get any
thing that will pay 5 per cent. They can
get it here. 1 wonder that they have not
come here. A theater in San Francisco I
consider a good investment."
It is claimed that Hayman has so held
the whip hand on the people owning the
theaters of the north that there is almost
no profit in the business there. In some
cases he charged 80 per cent, while he
would give the company but 60 per cent.
He had '20 per cent clean, but out of the
20 per cent left the Northern theater
owners they had to pay ail expenses of
water, lighting and furnish use of theater
and pay contingent expenses, which left
nothing at all.
For a long time he charged 10 per cent
for boosing merely. In addition to these
things he would, according to the stories
told, charge a company $500 for bringing
it and would also assess the manager ot
the Northwest circuit $500 a year. He
wrote the companies that he would get for
them the highest possible per cent and
also assured the Northwest theater-owners
that he was giving them steadily the
highest percentage he could possibly get.
Such Tittle plays as these, ail adding
cash to the already plethoric exchequer of
Hayman, have made the Northwestern
theater peode very tired, so their friends
say. So they are out to build a theate.r
here and he independent.
"We will immediately place our proDosi
tions before those who are interested with
us," said one of the gentlemen, "and one
of them will no doubt be adopted. It will
probably be the one for a theater with 2500
capacity. I expect to get the decision and
be back in about one month."
The theaters in their circuit and largely
owned by them are at Portland, Astoria,
Tacoma, Olympia, Seattle and Spokane.
No bar will be allowed in the theater
here, nor will the builders permit it to be
open on Sunday, no matter if for a sacred
concert.
A CHILD ACTOR.
General McComb Refuses to Allow
Sadaugemon Ogino to
Appear.
General McComb of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children intends
to dispute in court the statement that
Sadaugemon Ogino, the Japanese child
actor, is 16 years of age.
Sadaugemon, whose stature is in inverse
ratio to the length of his name, is the
Japanese child who used to tie himself
into knots and perform other unnatural
feats in the Midway Piaisance 6f the Mid
winter Fair, in order to decoy spectators
into the Japanese Theater. General Mc-
Comb says that the performance which the
child has to go through is dangerous and
cruel, as his little limbs are contorted into
horribly unnatural postures, and if his
nerve or courage failed at certain points of
his performance he might fall and do him
self grievous bortily injury.
"If the child is really lii he is a dwarf,
and a very small dwarf," said General Mc-
I'omb. "We do not believe, however, that
he can possibly be over 12, if he is as old
as that. He has been engaged for a music
hall in this City and we have told the man
ager if he persists in exhibiting the child
we shall have him arrested, but he
intends to go ahead and see if he
cannot win in the courts. The child's cer
tificate says he is just 16, but that is the
way with all these imported child per
formers; they are always a few days or
such over 16."
Badaugemon's mother, a gorgeously
i.appareled young Japanese woman, who
I does not look much over 20, has been to
j plead with the general to let her son ap
pear.but it is his opinion that she had better
work for the child instead of putting the
little fellow's earning on her own back,
and the persists in his determina
tion that if Sadaugemon appears to-morrow
he will have the manager arrested.

argument was to the effect that Invention is
not a lawless art. but rather the product of
hard and careful study. He showed the slow
development of experiments and attending re

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Many Changes Have Taken Place
Among Captains and Chief
Engineers.
OPPOSITION LINE TO BERKELEY
Remarkable Run of the Little Steamer
Santa Lucia to San Jose de
Guatemala.
The sailing of the Pacific Mail Com
pany's steamer Peru was the only excite
ment on the water front yesterday. The
steamer took away 191 Chinese in the
steerage and 12 cabin passengers. Among
the latter were three missionaries, and a
great number of church members were
down to see them off. As the vessels
moved away from the wharf both parties
joined in singing "God Be With You Till
We Meet Again" and "Nearer, My God,
to Thee." The hundreds of heathens who
were there to see their relatives looked on
in open-eyed astonishment.
Among the passengers on the Peru was
E. St. Yraz, a Prussian zoologist, who has
been making a tour of the United States.
He is a member of the Koyal Museum of
Prague, and in all the big cities wher
ever there is a Bohemian population he
has lectured in the Bohemian longue. He
will remain in Japan about three months
and will then go to Europe via Hongkong.
E. C. Troy, the auctioneer, was another
passenger. He will buy a large assort
ment of Japanese goods in Yokohama and
on his return will enter into competition
with California-made articles.
A great number of changes have taken
place in shipping circles during the past
few days. Captain Green of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's St. Paul went
out in command of the Umatilla, Captain
Hunter being on the sick list. Captain
Duggan is now master of the St. Paul.
Captain Jacobson of the barkentine Con
suelo is also on the sick list, and Captain
Friis will take the vessel out on her next
trip to the Hawaiian Islands. Chief En
gineer Holland, who has been laid up for
over a year, was able to resume work last
week and went out on the steamer Peru.
Chief Engineer Rossiter, who filled his
place, has been transferred to the steamer
City of Sydney and Chief Engineer Don
nelly will take* the Acapulco.
It has been stated that the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company was about to
put the stern-wheeler Herald on the run
between San Francisco and Berkeley. At
present Piper, Aden, Goodail & Co.'s
steamer Hope has the trade all to herself,
and as the Herald is steadily losing money
for the railroad on the Yallejo run, Agent
White is said to be looking around for a
new tield in which there is more money.
When spoken to about the matter yester
day, Harry Goodall laughed and said:
"Let them go ahead. The Hope just about
pays expenses, and if the Southern Pacific
thinks it can make any money by running
in opposition to us, let them try it."
Among the passengers who came up
from San Jose de Guatemala on the
steamer City of Sydney were Captain Kel
son and four men who, formed the crew of
the little steamer Santa Lucia when she
left San Francisco last November. She
was built to tow tenders from the shore to
the steamers, and when she left here peo
ple said she would never reach her desti
nation. She is only 48 feet long, 13 feet

"ARTS AND CRAFTS."
First Kxhibitlon of the Guild Associa
tion Is a Success â Society
in Attendance.
The first exhibition of books and print
ing undertaken by the Guild of Arts and
Crafts opened last night at their rooms,
414 Pine street. It was a most creditable
collection of books, original drawings,
etchings, lithographs, engravings â wood,
steel and copper. In fact, every detail of
the printer's art was to be seen, the ex
hibits going back to the fifteenth century,
and then in comparison is shown the
progression of each successive age.
There is an excellent collection of etch
ings, framed and unframed; yuch masters
as Hadin, Rembrandt and Fortuny being
well represented. The etchings are from
the collection of George H. Buckingham,
W. K. Vickery ana A. S. .McDonald.
Mayor Sutro has loaned a rare lot of Mexi
can and Spanish books and a few etchings
which he gathered in the old country.
The collection of engravings on "wood,
copper and steel are from various sources,
W. K. Vickery, W. D. McCann, W. H.
Reaser, George H. Mastick and others
having contributed. A. M. Robinson fur
nishes the copper-press plant in operation,
the artisans at work on plates specially pre
pared for this exhibition forming an inter
esting feature.
Of original drawings for books and
newspaper illustration. Miss Hobart fur
nishes a splendid collection. The art de
partment of The Call, with drawings by
Kahler, Fisher, Lewis, Partingtonand Van
liarlingen, is one of the attractive features
of the arts and crafts display. The art de
partments of the Examiner and Chronicle
are also represented.
The department of lithography is com
plete in every detail. Illustrations of the
swelled gelatine process, zinc etching, or
zincograph, the Gillot process, half-tone,
embossing, wax engraving and the chalk
process, are on hand in plentiful numbers,
forming as a whole one of the most attrac
tive exhibits to be seen in the hall.
Society apparently takes a deep interest
in anything undertaken by the Guild of
Arts and Crafts, for they attended in force
last night. The exhibition will close Jan
uary 25.
THE HEALY INQJJIRY.
Nothing but Preliminaries Accom
plished So Far, as All the Wit
nesseg Have Not Arrived.
Very little progress, it is expected, will
be made by the Healy board of inquiry
until all the witnesses against the Bear's
captain arrive. So far there has been
nothing done beyond the preliminaries of
organization in room 83 of the Appraisers'
building.
The full personnel of the board as organ
ized is: Captain Daniel B. Hodgson of the
Fessenden, stationed at Detroit, president;
Captain Louis N. Stodder of the Manhat
tan, stationed at New York; Captain W.
C. Couison of the Life-saving Service;
Lieutenant Henry B. Rodgers, comman
der of the Hartley, recorder, and Lieuten
ant \Villiam E. Reynolds of the "Wolcott,
now at Sitka, prosecutor. Lieutenants
Daniels and Emory of the Bear and As
sistant Dorey of the Perry are on hand as
witnesses, but these are all up to date.
The investigation may yet be an open
one â that is, it is optional with the accused
to say whether it shall be secret or public.
He has the right to demand a public in
quiry, and as he has a large number of
friends in the business world, all of whom
would testify in his favor as to capability
and efficiency, he may do so.

ALL AGAINST
RE-FUNDING
Enthusiastic State Conven
tion at Metropolitan
Temple.
STIRRING RESOLUTIONS J
The Entire State Well Repre-j
sented and United on the
One Platform.
A PERMANENT ORGANIZATION.
Congress to Be Memorialized and the
Sentiment of California Made
Known at Washington.
"WHEREAS, Several bills arc now
pending in Congress havinjc for their ob
ject the re-funding to the United States
Government of the debts owed by the
Pacific railroads; and.
WHEREAS, The people of California
are deeply interested in this question,
and are now assembled in State conven
tion to express their opinion thereon,
and desire to respectfully submit the fol
lowing :
First â That the United States Govern
ment, by a large grant of land and bonds,
MAYOR SUTRO ADDRESSING THE ANTI - FUNDING STATE CONVENTION AT METROPOLITAN TEMPLE, AND
SOME CHARACTERISTIC FREE-HAND SKETCHES OF DELEGATES.
[i>ra*rn from life at the convention by a "Call" artist.]
generously aided the construction of the
Pacific railway.
Secondâ That the bonds are now partly
due, and the grantee* refuse to pay them
and ask the < â <> vi mm-nt to exteud, for
Sfty or 100 years, tho time of payment
at half the ruling rates of interest.
Third â That the assets of said railroads
have been fraudulently converted by tho
original stockholders of the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company âII tint ingt on,
Stanford, Hopkins ami Crocker â who and
whose estates now declare the roads arc
bankrupt, while they are each worth
many millions of dollars which right
fully belong to the security.
Fourth â That these same parties have,
by all sorts of illegitimate means, kept
out competing railroad*, and thereby
managed to extort from the people of ;
this coast exorbitant rates of freights
and fares.
Fifthâ That these extortions have im
poverished and well nigh ruined our
farmers and brought the country gener- I
ally into a state of abject dependence.
Sixthâ That by such legislation they [
would also escape' liability, as trustees I
for the United States, having abstracted '
the assets, constituting â  large part of
the security and which arc now in their i
possession, and which had been en- <
trusted to their management.
Therefore be it
JIESOLFEIK That we, the citizens of j
California, in Stale convention ansem
bled, hereby enter our solnmn protest |
against the passage by Congress of any
re-funding bill whatever, and demand 1
that the law shall be permitted to take j
it* natural course without interference j
by the legislative branch of the Govern- !
xneut.
RESOLVED, That the President of i
the United States be requested to i
promptly do his executive duty under!
the constitution and statutes, and to in- :
struct the Attorney-General to com- j
mence foreclosure proceedings without :
delay in such form as lo enforce the '
trust and rehabilitate the security itself, !
and be it further
RESOLV Ki>, That our Senators and ;
members of Congress be requested to
punue the course indicated in these res- \
olutions, as representing the wish and ;
demand of ninety-nine out of every
liundred of all the inhabitants of the
State of California and of the Pacittc
Coast.
RESOIjVKI), That the secretary be !
instructed to forward copies of these \
resolution! to the President of the j
United States, his Cabinet, the Judces j
of the United States Supreme Court aud :
the member-* of both houses of Congress, ;
and that a committee of five be ap- j
pointed by the chairman of this convcu
tloa to prepare a memorial to accompany J
these resolutions, with full power to act. j
These are the resolutions that were
unanimously adopted by the State con
vention which met in Metropolitan
Temple yesterday afternoon to voice the
sentiment of the people of California on |
the question of re-funding tne debts owed
to the Federal Government by the Pacific j
railroads.
The convention was called by the Mayors j
of ban Francisco. Oakland, Stockton and j
Sacramento on a representative basis of
one delegate for every 5000 of population |
in the largei cities, one delegate from each j
township of over 500 population, and one
delegate from all other counties.
The convention was an unqualified i
success. It was enthusiastic and unani- j
mous on the main proposition throughout,
and the resolutions were carried by a I
rising vote. The following committee was
chosen to prepare the memorial to Con
gress:
M. M. Estek J. L. Davie
John T. tXrrvt E. M.Gibson
Henry E. lliuhtos adolph Sutro
A. Caminetti.
It devolved upon Mayor Sutro, as chair- i
man of the convention, to name the com- !
mittee. He called upon Messrs. Estee,
Doyle, Heighton, Cannon and Davie to !
serve. And then, by a special vote the I
names of ex-Congressmen Caminetti and
Mayor Sutro were added. Mr. Caminetti
requested the privilege of retiring from
the committee in favor of ex-Judge E. M.
Gibson of Oakland.
A larjre majority of all the delegates in
vited by the call were present when
Mayor Sutro opened the meeting. But
even this number made rather a poor
showing on the floor of the convention
hall, and at first there was some talk of ad- i
journing till next week so as to enable the
distant counties to send their delegates, j
and also to permit a larger representation
from the various counties. It was pro- i
posed by Henry E. Heighton that the call
be amended so as to permit a delegation of
not less than twenty-five from each county
to be present. This question was discussed
a little, but before it was seriously consid
ered, Taylor Rogers, the temporary secre
tary, had examined the credentials and
found that the entire State was fairly well
represented on the floor of the convention.
Some of the delegates had made the dis
covery at the same time, and the end of
the preliminary discussion was that the
convention resolved to get down at once
to business.
Mayor Sutro explained that the call was
in no sense for a mass-meeting, but for a
convention of delegates from the various
districts. Considering the nature of the
call it was found that the convention was
well attended. This fact was even the
better realized when several of the country
delegates announced that they had great
difficulty in reaching the City in time, and
that in some of their neighbor counties
there had not been sufficient time to permit
the selection of a proper delegate.
Proceeding to the business of temporary
and then permanent organization, upon
motion of Mr. Highton, Mayor Sutro was
unanimously chosen first temporary and
then permanent chairman of the conven
tion by a rising vote, and in the same
order, upon the motion of Max Popper,
Taylor Rogers was selected as the perma
nent secretary.
Communications were then read from a
number of prominent men in all parts of
the State who were unable to be present.
All of them expressed the utmost nympa
thy with the anti-funding movement and
the best wishes for the success of the con
vention.
Among the communications read was
the following telegram from W. R. Hearst,
dated New York, January 17:
Railroad combinations so strong in Wash
ington, it seems almost impossible to break
them; yet certainly it is the duty of all
having interest of the Pacific Coast at heart
to make the most strenuous efforts. 1 will
send Davenport from here, and the Journal
will use whatever power it has to assist.
\V. R. Hearst.
Another communication, from Charles
M. Shortridge, was as follows:
San Francisco, Jan. 17, 1896.
Eon. Adolph Hutro, Cityâ My Deab Sib: Your
THE SAN FK Ay CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
Invitation card requesting my presence at the
mass-meeting in opposition to the funding bill,
to be held on Saturday evening, the 18th inst.,
is at hand. I regret to state that on account of
my enforced absence from the City, I shall be
unable to be present at the meeting.
I Bincerely trust that the meeting will be a
success in every way, and will do much to aid
m defeating the audacious ana outrageous
scheme, in the forn of the funding bill, now
pending in Congress, the success of which
would entail upon California, for fifty years to
cotue, the burden of discharging the enormous
and-increasing obligation of the aided rogues.
I deem it of great importance that tne mass
meeting should be confined, as to its result, to
the precise question before it, viz.: the expres
sion in emphatic terms of the opposition of the
whole people of California to the funding bill.
To go beyond this, and indulge in either the-
ories or resolutions as to the best means to be
adopted by the Government for the solution of
this railroad problem would, It seems to me. [
be most unwise, and would be more than likely i
to involve the meeting in a discordant debate :
over issues which are not logically or properly ;
before it.
Again regretting my inability to be present, |
I beg to remain yours very truly,
Charles M. Shortkidgk.
The following telegram was received i
from one of Mayor Sutro'a trusted Eastern
agents:
Washington, D. C, Janunry 17, 1896.
A. Sutro. Mayor of San Francisco: Huntlngton
is organizing some secret particular dodge.
Has distributed some circulars among select
Congressmen, which others cannot see. I j
cannot find what it is yet.
From Visalia came a resolution couctfed
in terms fully coinciding with those ulti
mately expressed in the resolutions
adopted by the convention. These resolu- I
tions were forwaraed by Ben M. Mudaox, J
who had been chosen to represent Visalia
at the convention, but was unable to at- j
tend. It was also signed and indorsed by ,
the Board of Supervisors of Tulare County, '
as follows: T. E. Henderson (cnairman), â 
T. B. Twadeler, S. M. Gilliam, S. L. N. j
Ellis and J. H. Grimsley.
W. P. Ink, chairman of the Board of
Trustees of Cloverdale, forwarded a reso
lution, the substance of which was: ''Our
people want to see the funding bill de
feated."
Resolutions came also from a mass
meeting held in Newcastle. They were
signed by the chairman, A. J. Shellham
mer, and the secretary, Ed Katzenstein,
and were couched in plain and strong
words denouncing the funding bill. The
mass-meeting was held on January 16, and
the resolutions were adopted unanimously.
From Colusa came the following resolu
tions, passed at a mass-meeting of the citi
zens on January 13:
Whereas, We believe that strenuous efforts
are being made to pass a funding bill in Con
gress, extending the time for settlement of the
debts of the Central and Union Pacific Rail
road companies with the Government; and
whereas, the citizens of Colusa, in mass-meet
ing assembled, believe it to be inexpedient to
so extend the time; therefore be it
Be solved, That we are opposed to the passage
of a funding bill, or a bill in any form whatever,
that will extend the time of settlement of this
just debt. Frank Wilkins, Chairman.
Ed. St. Maurice, Secietary.
Another communication, signed by P.
T. Boone, president of the Board of Trust
ees, and H. V. Keeling, Town Clerk of
Lakeport, contained the following lan
guage:
We voice the sentiments of this town by de
claring that all are unanimously united against
the funding bill, believing it to be an in
iquitous measure, and its passage would be a
National disgrace. We applaud your action
and add this, our small but determined voice,
to the success of your effort.
On motion of George K. Fitch, the chair
man was empowered to appoint a com
mittee on resolutions. Mayor Sutro ap- ;
pointed the following, giving them an
hour in which to propose a set of resolu
tions which would embody the sense of
the assembled delegates:
George K. Fitch, San Francisco; J. L. Davle.
Mayor of Oakland; H. M. Baggs, Mayor of
Stockton; Robert Brown, Sacramento; B. A.
Ostrom, Yuba; John T. Doyle and Henry E.
Highton, San Francisco; M. M. Estee, Kapa;
Marion Cannon, Ventura; I. J. Truman, Gavin
McNab and Colonel T. F. Barry, San Francisco;
Ben Morgan, Oakland.
Upon the retirement of the committee
on resolutions, Mayor Sutro was roundly
applauded as he stepped forward and
made the following brief address:
Gentlemen of the Convention:
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which, taken at its flood, leads on to fortune.
Omitted, all the voyage of their lives
Is bound In shallows and in miseries.
That tide has come: the tide of popular feel
ing against tne encroachments, the oppres
sions ana the villainies of the powers which
rule over us; that octopus, which, with brazen
assurance, now stands before Congress, asking
that its crimes be condoned and that it be
given for all time the property it has converted
from the Government.
Let us all work together to beat the funding
bill and we may escape the shaliows and the
miseries of half a century to come.
Let one shout go up from all the throats of
the people on the Pacific Coast and grow in
volume till it will reverberate from the Pacific
to the Atlantic shoresâ "Defeat the funding
bill"â for its passage means the enslavement,
the degradation, the downfall of our people
and the triumph of all that is vile in human
life and affairs.
The men who now lord It over us have from
year to year grown in insolence and arrogance.
They have set at defiance our laws, they havt
bribed judges, packed juries, and, through a
system of bossism, corrupted and controlled
our elections and introduced a system of es
pionag and punishment of opponents which has
well nigh made slaves and cowards of our citi
zens.
Our noble constitution ana laws have been
set aside, they have been supplanted by the
mandates of the octopus, who in secret con
clave sits as judge and jury and decides who
shall be rewarded and who shall bo punished.
It holds out both arms ; In one hand a sack of
money, in the other the Bssassins dagger, and
cries out to. the people, "Take your choice; if
you do our bidding we will reward, enrich you
and give you office, honor and a foremost place
in society; if you oppose us, we will ruin yon
financially, socially, and we will disgrace
you."
American citizens, descendants of Revolu
tionary fathers, will you stand this? Will you
permit these low-minded villains to take from
you your birthright, your citizenship, your
flag, your legal rights? Will you become cow
ards and slaves and do the bidding of these
highwaymen?
That you will do if you permit this funding
bill to become a law. For fifty more years you
will be deprived of your rights as American
citizens. For fifty years you will be ground to
the dust. For fifty years the last cent you
posseu will be squeezed out of you, nn<i during
all that time the farmer, the mechanic, the
laborer will be permitted to barely exist, while
your masters take from you the result of your
labors and productions.
Bribery and corruption carry the day; hon
esty and honor are at a discount; we are
forced into acts of cowardice and slavery, be
cause individuals are helpless and cannot re
sist.
Let us make one united, supreme effort, and
pray Congress to turn a deaf ear to the false
pleas of our oppressors, who, through the aid
of a venal press, are trying to impress on Con
gress that but a few agitators are at the back of
this movement, while as a matter of fact the
people, with the exception of a few flunkies,
hirelings and dependants of the octopus, are a
unit on this overwhelmingly important ques
tion of the defeat of the funding of the Pacific
railroad debts.
Let resolutions go forth to Congress which
cannot be misunderstood. Let it be shown
that our liberties must not be destroyed by
handing us over body and soul to the octopus
for half a century to come; that Congress has
no richt to fasten on us a monopoly which will
exclude all competing railroads from coming
to California.
Our Government has three branchesâ the
legislative, the executive and the judicial.
Alter legislative action in favor of these rail
roads Congress has no right to interfere. It
belongs to the Executive Department to carry
into effect the law, and to the judiciary to de
fine it.
It is the President's duty to request the At-
torney-General to commence foreclosure pro
ceedings and thereunderlet these roads be sold
to the highest bidder.
Again, I say, this is a momentous time in our
affairs, and if the unanimous voice of the peo
ple is heard in thunder tones at Washington
right, honor and justice may yet prevail.
Dr. Cleveland then took the platform
and made a ringing speech that was heart
ily applauded. He characterized the atti
tude of Mr. Huntington in asking that the
debt of the Pacific railroads be refunded
again, for the seventh time, as a piece of
monumental impudence. But Congress
could uo longer act in ignorance on the
question, he declared. Any man who
voted for the bill, or any President who
should sign it, would be a traitor to his
country and to the people, for he must do
it with his eyes wide open.
In concluding his brief address he eulo
gized the chairman of the convention and
predicted the ultimate triumph of the inter
ests of the whole people over those of a
railroad monopoly that had in years past
bribed Congressmen and legislators and
which stands ready to gain its own infa
mous ends to-day by the same methods.
Mr. Rogers addressed the convention,
first requesting those in the galleries to
come down to the main floor, the band
meanwhile playing "Columbia, the Gem
of the Ocean." He said equality of all
men before the law was the basis of this
Government. This fundamental principle
was directly assaulted by the funding bilJ.
If one man, or one set of men, could go
roughshod over the laws and the cher
ished institutions of the Republic, in that
day American liberty would be at an end.
He said:
What are we coming to in California? Where
is the man in our own City who dares to stand
up before this villainous corporation and say
that his soul is his own? Not a pound of
human flesh enters or leaves our City without
paying tribute to this monster. Tne mer
chants, the business men of San Francisco, are
utter cowards when brought face to face with
the railway magnates. We ought to strain
every nerve and put forth every endeavor in
order to crush and defeat this damnable bill.
Yet how weak and unmanly is the attitude
of the average California business man in
relation to this weighty issue 1 From
the East we can expect nothing. The people
there areas a rule densely ignorant regard
ing California, its people and the California
needs. If anything is to be done we must do
it ourselves, and lose no time doing it if we
wish to save our State from slavery.
James H. Barry, editor of the Star, made
a stirring speech against the bill, which he
characterized as one of the most infamous
measures ever broached in the world's his
tory:
We all know how the railway nas terrorized
and subjugated the business men of this State.
They, of all others, ought to be in the front
rank in this fight against the funding bill.
Every man of them would hail with joy the
establishment of a Government railway sys
tem. But they fear to be crushed by the ini
quitous corporation which rules our State.
Let us not be deceived. If anything is to be
ilone we, the people of the State, must do It.
F. J. Sullivan was the next speaker. He
said the Government should conduct the
railways, and he contended that any
member of Congress who could vote in
favor of the funding bilJ would be recreant
to a sacred trust and altogether unworthy
of any post of public confidence. He said
he had been deprived of all hope of
political advancement through the mach
inations of the railway kings, and he
referred in caustic terms to the influence
of Southern Pacific gold in Congress.
Colonel Barry then announced that the
committee on resolutions was ready to
report, whereupon the Mayor ordered the
resolutions read.
Eugene Hough of Oakland got the floor
after the reading of the resolutions. He
ottered an amendment providing that the
Pacific railroads should be taken by the
Government and run for the benefit of the
whole people.
His amendment was roundly applauded
by those not delegates, and particularly
by Denis Kearney, whose enthusiasm was
amusing to those who noticed it.
Mr. Hough followed up his amendment
by a ringing speech in favor of Govern
ment ownership of railroads, saying that
the people he represented demanded not
only that the funding bill should be killed,
but that the Federal Government take
possession of the railroads.
He was followed by Henry E. Highton,
who calmly pointed out the necessity for
the convention standing together unani
mously on the resolutions as reported, and
not burdeninc them with issues, which,
though excellent in themselves, many
honest men could not agree upon.
John Gilder of Oakland spoke to the
amendment. He made a strong speech
for Government ownership, and said that
the people he represented wanted it put
past the power of Mr. Huntington to buy
in the Pacific railroads and continue them
under the present regime.
Gavin McNab secured the floor and
pointed out that if it is true that when
thieves fell out honest men get their dues,
it is also true that when honest men fall
out thieves are apt to get more than their
dues. He wanted the convention to stick
to the single proposition of fighting the
refunding bill and to consider the Govern
ment ownership at some other time and
as a separate measure.
Taylor Rogers spoke to the same effect,
declaring himself decidedly in favor of
Government ownership of railroads, but
deprecating any attempt to load down the
resolutions with planks upon which every
honest and fearless man in the State could
not unite.
Chairman Sutro pointed out that noth
ing could please Mr. Hnntington more than
to have an amendment such as that pro
posed by Mr. Hough inserted in the reso
lutions. That would give him the very
chance he wanted of misrepresenting the
whole matter to the Eastern Congressmen
who are not familiar with the question.
Then he ruled the amendment out of
order, under the call which gave birth to
the convention.
This course was heartily approved by
the delegates, even by those who were the
strongest advocates of Government owner
ship, and the resolutions were passed
unanimously.
Then, as if to prove the words of Mayor
Sutro, Denis Kearney â though not a dele
gate â jumped to his feet and tried to raise
a technical point in favor of the amend
ment.
At once a dozen delegates jumped up
and demanded that no outsiders be per
mitted to speak. Denis Kearney kept
on. but his voice was drowned by cries of
"Put him out!"
Mr. Highton moved the appointment of
a sergeant-at-arms to remove from the
hall all persons not delegates who Insisted
upon speaking. Taylor Rogers called
upon the policemen at the door to do their
duty. Kearney gave up the floor and
went out of the hall.
After the appointment of the committee
on memorializing Congress Mr. Highton
moved that the convention adjourn, to be j
called together aeain whenever, in the
judgment of Mayor Sutro. there should be
further work for it to perform. In spite of
the shortness of the time since tne call for
the convention was promulgated nearly 70
per cent of the delegates created under the
terms of the call were present. Their
names are as follows :

SAM IS STILL AT LARGE
The Chinese Letter-Thief Did
Not Try to Board the
Steamer Peru.
Efforts of the Postal Inspectors to
Capture Him Were Again Baf
fled Yesterday.
Sam Yick, or rather, Sam Hing, the
leader of the gang of young Chinese
"Native Sons" who succeeded in looting
the Postoffice boxes of Fong Hai & Co.!
715 Dupont street; Tsue Chong "Wing Mon
Kee & Co., 715 Commercial street; and
Chew Ying Lung, 738 Sacramento street,
and getting about $2003 worth of money
orders and checks by the scheme, has not
yet been apprehended by the Postal
Inspectors.
Inspectors Munro and Thrall were at the
Pacific Mail dock when the steamer Peru
left for China yesterday afternoon, bnt
Sam Hing did not put in an appearance.
Louie Quong, merchant and interpreter, is
of the opinion that Sam went over to Oak
land, intending to take an early train for
the East. There were enough of Federal
otlirers on hand at the steamer's departure
to have captured any number of Mon
golian letter-thieves, had there been any
insight, for Deputy Collector of Customs
Jerome, Marshal Baldwin, Surveyor Eng
lish and Deputy Surveyor Ruddell all had
business there about that time.
It was learned yesterday that the Bank
of California, the Nevada Bank, the First
National Bank, Wells, Fargo <fe Co. and
Sutro & Co. had honored the forgeries of
Sam Hing and the identification of Hue
Tin Foo. A check for $140, payable to
Fong Hai <fc Co., was cashed by the Bank
of California, and the Bank of Nevada paid
a $35 check. Tsue Chonc Wine Mon Kee
&â  Co. know of three checks of $60, $10 and
$56, respectively, which the banks had al
lowed themselves to pay to Sam Hing.
The explanation Hue Tin Foo gives of
his connection with the gang is a plausible
one. The urbane youna business repre
sentative of Man Lee & Co. of 709 Dupont
street says Sam Hing told him a short
time ago that he had stolen letters from
the Postoffioe boxes, ana bat for that he
would not have known an y thing about it.
When he identified Sam Hing to Sutro &
Co., he explains further, he did hot then
know about his crooked work, and sup
posed everything was all right. Sam Hing
has not been employed by the firm of Man
Yick & Co. of 1017 Dupont street for some
time, it was stated by the manager.
The arrangement of the Postofiice boxes
is such that those of Fong Hai & Co. and
Tsue Chong Wing Mon Kee & Co. could
be emptied of their contents by any per
son reaching through the box of Chew
Ying Lune, because the last mentioned
box is between the other two and they im
mediately adjoin it. Chew Ying Lung &
Co., however, say it could not have bten
their young man who did the stealing.
The box of Man Lee & Co. is a considerable
distance away according to Hue Tin Foo.
In recalling Sam Hing's conversation
Tin Foo stated yesterday that Sam had
told him his method had been to call at
the Postoffice about 7:30 a. m. and 9 p. m.
every day and ask the clerk on duty for
the letters of his victims and that he re
ceived them. This is denied at the Post
office, and the denial is based upon an ex
planation that there is a written rule that
n< y? ai i should be Â§ iven out in that way.
lhe Nevada Bank made good yesterday
the $35 check to which Sam Hing had
forged the name of Fong Hai & Co. and
paid the money over to the firm. The
postoffice money-order which Sam had
forged was for $200, payable to Fong Hai &
Co., and in connection with this be hud
worked his scheme of making small pur
e ases on Getz Bros. &, Co., at 111 and
115 California street. Sam Hing made an
effort late Friday to square himself with
oue of the firms he had victimized, so it
was reported in Chinatown yesterday, by
paying back some of the nioney he had
tasen, but this could not be verified.
COSTLY AFFECTIONS.
They Belong to Mrs. Curtis aud She
Sues for Damages for Their
Alienation.
Mrs. Emma A. Curtis of 1311 Green
street wants $10,000 worth of damages
from Miss Leonora Miles. She says Miss
Miles has alienated the Curtis affections
from their legitimate object, causing
thereby a divorce and much worry and
trouble.
Mrs. Curtis married Henry C. Curtis in
April, 1874. They lived together for ten
years and then she went Ea<t^ on a visit,
leaving her husband home. When she re
turned she noticed that he had siiigularly
changed and seeking for a cause she ascer
tained that he had secured a divorce in
Suttcr County ani was no lon per her hus
band. She went to the Judge who had
granted the divorce and upon her testi
mony the decree was set aside.
Mrs. Curtis still sought for the cause of
it all and finally, she claims, she found it
in Miss Miles." She says Miss Miles has
lured the susceptible Curtis away and she
wants damages for his defection from
what sue thinks is the cause of it.

Coupon Scores Another WinâSilver
ado a Surpriseâ The Crowd Over
looked Strathmeath.
Nine out of every ten of the large
crowd of racegoers tiiat started for
Ingleside racecourse yesterday fully ex
pected to sac the rich Palo Alto stakes,
worth $1500 to the first horse, decided in a
sea of mud. What, then, was their sur
prise to gaze upon a track that Jooked as
though it had been undergoing the drying
process from the sun's rays for a week, in
of one that had been flooded only
the day previous by a tierce storm. Ingle
eide is beyond question the ideal winter
racing-track of the country.
â  ulation in the big betting-ring was
heavy as usual, sixteen bookmakers hav
ing all they could attend to. Two favor
ites and three outsiders took purses, so
that honors were easy at the end of the
day.
Gallant, the worthy son of Fellowcharm,
rare fettle and fairly reveling in
the heavy going, carried President Spreck
els' red, white and blue colors to the fore
in the event of the day. He was cleverly
piloted by "Joe" Piggott. It was a very
popular victory, and as Piggott took from
the wire ths silken bag containing the
purse, he was tendered an ovation.
The followers of honest liraw Scot were
in mourning after the last race, as the
judges found it necessary to disqualify
him for the place on account of his iockev's
foul riding.
It wouid be hard to gather together a
better field of milers all with a fondness
for heavy going than the nine thai laced
the flag in the stake event, which was
third on the card. It was a ?ellinj_
beaten horses not liable to claim. E;ich of
carters was entered at a valuation of
Pat Dunne's brown colt Pepper was
a red-hoc hrst choice in the betting. From
7 to 5 the odds against him were quickly
cut to 11 to 10. In fact from the way the
prices against the other starters "were
raised it would indicate the Eastern horse
had already annexed the prir.e for his
owner. The Spreckels pair, Gallant and
Cadmus, opened at 5 and receded to 7 to 1.
Wheel of Fortune, Koma, Thornhill and
Highland all went back several points.
Olive reached 15 and was backed down to
8, and Cabrillo also received some support.
The boys gave Starter raldwell consider
able trouble at the post in their anxiety to
get away. The flag finally sent tnem off
well lined up, with "Wheel of Fortune,
Highland and Olive quickest in motion
snowing in front. All were in a hurry to
make the first turn in front to get the
choice of positions, and considerable bump
inc was indulged in. Thornhill and Pepper
faring the worse for it. Piggott, on Gal
lant, got his mount through, and turning
into tne back stretch was leading by three
lengths, followed by Highland and" Wheel
of Fortune heads apart, with Cabrillo a
good fourth. At the haif the leader still
maintained his advantage. The favorite
nad wended his way through the bunch
and was second.
There was slight change as the stretch
was reached, and gradually increasing his
lead. Gallant passed the wire an easy
winner by live lengths. Cadmus came
ft phenomenal rush from the far rear
and wa.- beaten but a short head for the
by the favorite. The winner's time
for the mile was 1:46^.
Walter Hobari's two-year-old Coupon
continues en his winning career. He tooK
the opening three-furlong dash in an or
dinary fraliop. starting at odds of 4 to 5.
Mary X finished second with seven other
'babies" behind her.
A mile dash for selling platers vrith
eight starters^ resulted in a very easy win
for the even-money choice, Ail Over, who
took the lead on tiie far turn and won as
he pleased from Alvarado. Daylight waa
a. distant third.
The mile and a Bixtecnth run over four
hurdles ended in a big surprise. J O C
ruled an 11 to 5 favorite, with Three Forks
a heavily played second choice. There
â¢were nine other starters. Uncertainty Ira
over the first two jumps, when Three Forks
went out in front. The iatter horse led up
to the last jump, where Silverado joined
him, and after alighting on the opposite
6)de drew away and won easiiy by a length.
Three Forks lasted lo:i^ enough to take
the place from Cicero by a head.

Condemned by Street Expert
Elder.
Mayor Sutro is keeping a close watch on
the manner in which street contracts are
being carried out and has expert G. W.
Elder examine each job as the recommen
dation of the Superintendent of Streets
that he sign the acceptance comes in.
Lftose work in laying pavement and put
ting in crossings has apparently been
going on, for a job that was accepted by
the Superintendent of Streets and recom
mended to the Mayor for his signature was
reported on ac follows yesterday :
I hnve this day made a personal examination
of the crossing 01 ttay ana Jones streets, which
has recently been paved with basalt blocks,
the assessment which is now before you for
your approval.
1 find upon examination that this crossing
has not been paved in accordance with the
specifications required for this class of pave
ment. The recent storm has washed out a
large hole in this pavement. The blocks used
in i he crossing are not up to the size required
in tin' specifications. They are deficient in the
following manner: The .specifications require
that no block shall be used of a greater width
than four inches. The depth also required is
none less thaii seven nor more than seven and
a half.
In some instances those blocks are five inches
in width, exceeding ffte specifications by ona
inch; also a large number are deficient in
depth from one to two inches, all of which is
in Violation of the specifications. The proper
amount of travel has not been used in the con
struction of 'he pavement, and the blocks have
not been laid ia a workmanlike manner. In
many instance- the blocks are from an inch
and a halt to nvo inches apart, and the cross
ing has not the crown as is required in the
ations. The whole crossing is defective
In the manner in which it has been con
structed. I would therefore recommend that
your Honor withhold your signature to the as
sessment until the contractor perfoinis thi.s
work in compliance with the specifications
laid down by the Board of Supervisors. Very
respectfully jours, George W. Eldek.
UNDER INVESTIGATION.
Testimony on the Charges Against
Connty Clerk's Deputy Harry Morris.
J. M. Ellis of 325 Montgomery street has
written to Harry Morris., the accused
County Cierk's deputy, stating that at all
times that he or his clerks have had to pay
the fees for attesting his signature as a
notary, and he offers to testify in Morns'
behalf at any time.
Mr. Molback, who was quoted as having
said he paid money to Morris and was toid
it went into a separate fund, now says he 4
recollects he paid ar, that time, for a
copy of a decree of divorce, and he se
cured it at a different desk. He says he
does not know Morris and has never had
any conversation with him.
Another notary, E. M. Morgan of 14
Bansome, also wrote to the County Clerk.
He said he has had considerable business
with the County Clerk's office as a notary,
and every time he went there he was coiii-
Dclled to go to the Treasurer's oifice to pay
his fees. He said Morris would never ac
cept any money from him. He says ho
wrote voluntarily and without a sugges
tion from any one.
An investigation of Morris' accounts is
in progress, and the charges will be thor
oughly probed.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
RIGHTS OF EXECUTORS
D. M. Delmas' Arguments in
Support of the Last Fair
Contests.
CAN PROPOSE AND OPPOSE.
Questions on the Jurisdiction of the
Courtâ Mr. Pearson Will Answer
on Friday.
For another two hours the demurrers to
the contests of Marc Levingston and the
teachers' retirement fund to the probate
of the stolen will of James G. Fair were
under argument before Judge Slack. Nor
are they yet concluded, for Mr. Pearson
will answer Mr. Delmas next Friday after
noon.
Mr. Delmas concluded his argument in
support of the contests shortly before 12
o'clock. He followed in his address yes
terday morning the line suggested by his
remarks of Friday afternoon. He main
tained that a party not named under a
statute, but being a legatee under a testa
mentary disposition, has a right to insist
on the recognition of the will in which he
is named. Such offer of a subsequent will
would amount to a contest of the will al
ready on file, but it would only be by
establishing the genuineness of the will
under which he claimed ttiat such a per
son could gain a standing in court. He
cited a case where legatees under the first
codicil of a will were denied inheritance in
the second codicil, but they were allowed
to enter court and contest the validity of
that part of the willâ the second codicilâ
which acted against them. If a testa
mentary legatee has a right to probite
that will which gives him a legacy, he
must have the right to contest any paper
which conflicts wiin such will.
Continuing, Mr. Delmas said that sup
pose the will of September 21, 1894, the
stolen will, had been admitted to piobate,
and that within a year after the will of
September 24, the pencil will, had been
found, then the parties named in the
second will would have a right to offer
that will for probate. The right to offer
this second will could not be taken away
by reason of the admittance of the first
will, and the very fact of propounding the
first will for probate would amount to a
contest of the probate of the first will.
The admittance of the first will would be
an adjudication that it was the last wiil,
and any paper submitted for probate after
the other had been submitted, must
necessarily be a contest of the first, and
its proof would be an adjudication
that the first was not the last
wiil. Again Mr. Delmas contended
that suppose the will of September 21 were
admitted and the next day the will of
September 24 was discovered, then it would
be the duty of the executors of the second
will to present it for probate. But the
first adjudication must stand until set
aside, and the proponents of the second
will mast first atiack that adjudication.
If they cannot urge duress nor unsound
ness of mind their rights must of necessity
rest upon the genuineness of the will they
offer. They have an undoubted right to
be heard, Mr. Delmas argued, and their
subsequent rights are dependent upon
proving the genuineness of the will of
September 24. In such a procedure only
can they come before the court. They
must contest the will of September 21, and
tho grounds must be that it was not the
last will and that the one they offer is.
Concluding, Mr. Delmas said that the
court had jurisdiction over the estate of
James G. Fair, and it had therefore the
power to hear and determine first, whether
he died testate or intestate, and then, if
testate, which or what is his last will, and
if there were twenty applicants, each pre
senting a different will, the court, it was
argued, could hear them all. And these
proceedings need not be in twenty different
actions, but the whole could be heard at
once and in the presence of all applicants.
Any executor named in the will of Septem
ber 24, 1594, Mr. Delmas said, has a right
to put forward that will for probate, since
it revokes all wills prior to itself, and inci
dental to the right to probate that will the
executors have the right to oppose any
will that may be in conflict with the on
in which he or they are named.
TITLE INSURANCE.
How Titloi Are Closely Examined and
Finally Passed Upon and In
sured,
There is a well-defined, wide and very
common notion, even among those who
pride themselves on a somewhat familiar
knowledge of titles, that the possession of
land after the lapse of a long time in some
way or other cures or removes any defects
of title. The usual answer to an objection
to a tiWe that "Mr. Smith has enjoyed un
interrupted and undisputed possession for
more than twenty years," or "the defect
occurred so long ago that it has long since
been outlawed and consequently has no
force or effect now," is totally and un
qualifiedly wrong. Neither lapse of time
nor possession of land ever gave a good
title to any one.
In this City, where transactions in real
estate are numbered by the thousands
annually, one can reartily form an idea of
the magnitude and importance of the
business done in the Recorder's office and
the consequent difficulty in consulting the
records and indices. After accumulating
all data in connection with a title the ex
aminer must then pass his opinion upon
the validity of the same, assuming in every
instance that the indices and records are
correct.
The title is thus laid bare, and if the rec
ords be correct every flaw stands revealed
to the competent and trained investigator.
He must not only know the Jaw a 8 it now
stands, but also as it existed during every
stage of the title, and be able to tell th*e
force of every instrument affecting it.
Under the ordinary method of title exam
ining there is no absolute protection
afforded the purchaser of real estate.
Every step in the examination of a title is
a perilous one, and fraught with dancers
lurking in records improperly or carelessly
kept.
A policy of insurance upon a title is a
statement that the insurance company
has examined the records of the county
in which the realty is situated, and is
willing to guarantee that the title is perfect.
When a person desires to have a title
examined, it is not necessary to give the
name of the parties to deeds showing who
owned it at different stages of its exist
ence. AH that is required is the location
of the property. A reference to the lot in
the record kept by the title company will
disclose its history. If the title be found
perfect in all respects, it issues a policy
which insures the holder against any loss
which he, his heirs or devisees may sus
tain by reason of any defect of titl* affect
inp the property at the date of the policy ;
and as the company guarantees the cor
rectness of its reports, it cannot escape
liability on the ground of errors of opin
ion, 'ihe California. Title Insurance and
Trust Company binds itself to defend at
its own expense every suit brought against
the title so certified. Its client will be
properly defended without cost to him,
and will be compensated for all loss sus
tained by him. As land enhances in value,
the risk of litigation concerning the title
increases, aud the necessity for title in
surance becomes more apparent.
A decrepit old woman was recently re
leased from the Cincinnati Workhouse
who had had five husbands, each one of
wbom had met a violent death.

WONDERS OF COOL GARDIE.
Special Agent Smart on the Re
markable Gold Discov
eries.
The Queer Water " Soaks " or Natural
Bowlsâ Australian Meat and
Butter Trade.
J. M. Smart, United States special agent
of the Department of Agriculture, Wash
ington, who has been on a tour of Aus
tralia to obtain information concerning
the beef, mutton, butter and cheese pro
ducts and exports, is at the Palace.
Agent Smart spent six mouths at the
Antipodes. He visited the famous Cooi
gardie gold mines and remained some
time. His account of the information
gathered for the department, as well as
what he saw at Coolgardie, is full of in
terest.
"The camp of Coolgardie, where I re
mained most of the time for two months,
is a remarkable place," said Mr. Smart.
"I do not think there is the equal of it on
the earth. It now has from 30,000 to 50,000
people, and it has grown to thi3 size en
tirely in eighteen months. The people aro
largely English-speaking. There are many
Californians there as well as mining men
from other parts of the coast.
"As for the mines they are developing
enormously. The output now is about
$5,000,000 a year, and in tne last twelve
months investments have been made there
and elsewhere in West Australia to the
amount of $15,000,000.
"Coolgardie is the most unattractive
place on the globe. All around it is a com
plete sand uesert. It looks worse than the
Mojave desert. There is very little
water about there, and what they get is
froai 'soaks' or great natural basins In the
rocks. These basins have been filled by
the wind with sand. You diÂ« down in
them anywhere from one to rive feet and
you get water. Tne trouble is to find these
basins, however. The surface everywhere
is the same and you may dig for weeks
and not find anything. The basins are in
size all the way from an acre to two or
three miles across. Were it not for these
; soaks' which are provided by nature no
living thing could exist there.
".New discoveries are being made all the
time at Coolgardie. As for floating stock
companies, we don't know anything about
it here. The stocks are hign, too, and go
ing up every day. The Bailey's Reward,
which was the first mine at Coolgardie, has
480,000 shares, the shares now being worth
$5 each. The Londonderry has been
floated by Colonel North, the nitrate king,
for $5,000,000. In a single pocket was found
gold of the value of $250,000. From this
pocket was taken the Great Ben nugget,
bigger than a bucket and worth over $100,
--000. Another large strike has recently
been made in the Londonderry.
"Dr. SimmÃ, the great French author on
gold, is now there and buying property
right and left. His syndicates are French
and German. He is the greatest investor
in gold mines on the face of the earth.
"I visited not oniy Coolgardie proper
but Koolgorlie, Siberia, Ninety-mile, Han
nahs and other camps of the district. They
are little places of about 1000 people each.
It is at Hannahs that the great Boulder
mine is situated, the stock of which is sell
ing at a rate that would make the property
worth $17,500,000. /
"Daring the last three or four months
some very fair hotels have been built at
Coolgardie, where a man can stay at from
$3 to $4 a day. They are forming a water
trust now at Coolgardie, with $5,000,000
capital, to get water for the town. I don't
know where they will get it, unless from
the Swan River, 300 miles away, or from

some great 'soak' or natural bowl, which
may be found on the desert. But Cool
gardie is a great place, anyway.
, "As to my investigations for the Depart
ment of Agriculture, I visited Queensland,
New Zealand, South Australia, West Aus
tralia and New South Wales. I found the
productions of beef, mutton, cheese and
butter enormous. They have gone into
the butter business so extensively that it
is astonishing. Victoria alone exported to
London last" year more than $6,000,000
\\<-rth of butter. Australia's greatest com
petitor to-day in the butter product is
Denmark. No other country can ap
proach it.
"New Zealand stands to-day as the
greatest producer of cheese. It controls
the cheese market of England. The but
ter and cheese exports from the Australian
colonies during the past three years have
averaged $30,000,000 annually.
"Ah to the meat business ill the Aus
trnlian colonies it has grown tremen
dously. Shipments are made to London
fortnightly, each vessel carrying from
50,000 to 75,000 carcasses of mutton and
beef. A live bullock at the seashore in
Australia is worth $6 on the average. In
Chicago he would be worth $40.
"The beef as well as the mutton is frozen,
and is thus shipped. New Zealand leads
in the production of mutton. In the pro
duction of pork only are we ahead. I3ut
our pork has more fat on it than the pork
oJ most other countries, and this brings
the prices down a little. Tlie reason for
this increased fat is partly because of the
corn fed, and partly from the poland
China hogs, which constitute most of our
stock. They carry twenty per cent more
fat than other pork."
Special Agent Smart will make a de
tailed report to the Agricultural Depart
ment of the facts given to The Call. He
will leave for Washington to-night.
A GUARD TROPHY.
Colonel Henry G. Shaw Wants the Con-
ditions of the Centennial IVlatch-
Cup Kestored.
Henry G. Shaw of Stockton sent a com
munication to the Board of Supervisors
yesterday calling attention to the fact that
the Centennial trophy, a cup for which
the Supervisors appropriated $500 in 1576,
is still in existence, and that the condi
tions under which it was presented to
the National Guard are not beine com
plied with. He recites the history of the
trophy, which was to be competed for on
the rifle ranee by the different regiments
of the guard for 100 years, or until 197H,
when it was to become the property of the
regiment winning it in that year. In the
interim the regiment winning the trophy
at each annual shoot was to hold it until
the next contest came off. Mr. Shaw, who
was once a colonel in the guard, states
that the conditions have been so changed
that the regiment winning it two con
secutive years- shall own it absolutely,
'â¢instead," says Colonel Shaw, "of allow
ing it to stand as a great challenge trophy
to be honorably striven for annually dur
ing the second centennial of the United
States. Such unauthorized action had the
effect of depriving the trophy of its his
toric associations and of its power to in-
Bpire the youth of the City to engage in a
noble contest."
He protests against the changed condi
tions being allowed to stand, and says that
if the cup is not restored to its original
status it should De presented to the Golden
Gate Park Museum.

The following communication has been re
ceived :
Sa?t Francisco, Jan. 18, 1896.
To the Editor of the CoW^-Dear Sir: I desire dis
tinctly to disavow any such statement as that at
tributed to me on nage 7 of your issue of this date,
viz.: that "the roa^l to hell from church emenaln
ments is easy." In an interview, which I had not
sought, but which I could not well refuse, I did
quote the familiar Latin words, ".Facilis Descen
-Bus Averni," but It was in illustration merely of
the tendency from the questionable to the worse
in the methods of raising money for church pur
poses. I have hitherto kept myself and my people
altogether out of thac line, with its downward
grade. That is all I meant by the quotation. As I
Jiave no desire to be considered an extremist In
this matter, I ask that you will kindly publish this
note of explanation. Hobabt Chetwood.

Oakland Exhibitors Fare Well Against
Fanciers From All Parts of
the State.
Oakland Office Sax Fp.axcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. f
One of the most interesting coops in the
Tabernacle show is the one that contains
the Kansas freak. The freak is a fowl
that has a face like a monkey and the ex
hibit is labeled "monkey-faced chicken."
The chicken has no beak, but a month
very similar to that of a monkey, and in
side are a few teeth. It has a flat nose
with nostrils and the facial appearance of
the bead is that of a very small ape. In
side the mouth are a few teeth and it
partly chews what it eats.
The monkey-faced chicken is the prop
erty of W. H. Shear and is 13 months
old. Mr. Shear says it is a genuine Kan
sas freak and, although it does not belong
to any olass and can not be awarded a pre
mium, it is an object of much interest.
To-day was given over to the school
children and hundreds of boys and girl 3
took advantage of the opportunity to learn
a lesson that can never he taught in a pub
lic school.
Among the most successful exhibitors ia
ex-Mayor Charles D. Tierce of Oakland,
who tas completely captured the buff
Leghorn class. * Mr. Pierce is one of the
most enthusiastic amateur chicken-raisers
in the county. He has entered nearly ijfty
birds and with such good result that tub
first, second and third premiums for buff
Leghorn pullets are his, so is the iirst
premium for buff Leghorn cookerila and
the lirst and second premiums for buff
Leghorn hens.
Mr. Pierce is so accustomed to receive
premiums for his Leghorns that he has
specially printed placards for ornament
ing the coops where his pets are on exhibi
tion.
Trustee G. W. Leydecker is a large
exhibitor in the light brahuja class, and
A. N. Bay ley of Oakland has entered some
fine birds in several classes.
The most interesting corner to-day to the
school children was the incubator section.
Several chicks were due to arrive this
afternoon and punctual to time the little
fluffy birds crashed through their shells
and welcomed the many visitors. The
show will be open till next Wednesday
night, including to-morrow.
The Poultry Association held an impor
tant meeting to-night and made a change
of secretaries. President Seed stated that
the board was not satisfied with the ac
counts of Secretary Mecklem, and Mr.
Ruud was appointed in his stsad. There
was much talk of legal proceedings aeainst
Mecklem, but as he refuses to give up his
books no one knows just how he stands.

copying Mrs. Dr. A. D. Howe's old advertisements
The public is well aware that the world has never
seen the equal of this marvelous woman, and,
whilst these mushroom imitators are continually
springing up and attempting to impose on the peo-
ple, every one should be certain to see that no such
fraudulent deception is practiced on them by these
inferior impostors,
-Mrs. Dr. A. D. Howe is the best known as well
as the most successful medium of whom there is
! any record, tor she has accomplished more good,
; made more people happy and healed more sick per-
I sons than any one in the universe. She never
! fails. Reveals your entire life and gives you in-
valuable advice in everythingâ love, speculation
and business affairs included. Are you unsuccess-
ful in business? Are you unlucky? Is your hus-
band, your wife or your lover untrue? Or are you
sick? If so consnlt this Queen Medium of the' P-
acific coast immediately. The poor are made rich;
the sick are made strong; the unhappy find com-
fort; the separated are brought together; and. in-
deed, all who come to or who write to her find love,
luck, health and happiness.
Mrs. Dr. A. D. Howe's "Revealed Medicines"
(registered and copyrighted) cure all diseases on
earthâ consumption, paralysis, rheumatism, skin
diseases, heart disease, all nervous and private
troubles, female complaints and luck of vitality in-
cluded. Her advertisements have not appeared in
I this column for some months, because she has
I been very busy at her elegant residence, 1061
| Seventh avenue, East Oakland, where her offices
I and consultation rooms also are, but every week
there appear elsewhere in this paper full state-
ments of some of the many wonderful cures
which she has made and Is continuing to make.
Come and consult her at once, but if you can't call,
write about your troubles. Thousands upon thou-
sands have been made rich, happy and
healthy without ever having seen her, for con-
sultation and treatment by mail are always most
successful.
! Take the broad-gau?e ferry and the Oakland
j broad-gauge local train to Clinton Station (two
I stations beyond Broadway), which is only three
i blocks from her â 1061 Seventh avenue, East
i Oakland. All communications treated as sacredly
confidential. â  .

court session before Judge McKenna iv
the Southern Pacific Company's suit
against the Railroad Commissioners.
There are three factions represented
â the two which furnish the title
to the action and the United States
Government, which has hied a bill of in
tervention with a view to the protection of
us interests.
At one time yesterday afternoon United j
States District Attorney H. S. Foote for j
the Government, Attorney-General W. F. |
Fitzgerald for the State of California and j
Attorneys John Garber and J. C. Martin for j
the railroad all seemed fast asleep. They
had battled long and hard to keep their j
eyes open during the monotonous reading j
of the Pattison Commission report. Like j
so many children kept away from their ;
cribs after their usual bedtime, they tossed â 
about, blinked their "peepers" a few times ;
and I hen lny back in various attitudes j
more or less of comfort, oblivious to their j
surroundings.
There appeared a faint smile of satisfac
tion on the corners of Judge McKenna's
mouth as he surveyed the field before him.
It seemed to intimate that the sentiment
passing through his mind was:
"Well, you wanted to have the full re
port of the committee read, did you? Well,
you shall have it."
On Friday the court suggested that the
reading be curtailed somewhat, as he did
not think it advisable to follow up the 1600 |
pages of ancient history if he couKl help it.
But the attorneys, j<nd especially Mr.
Foote for the Government, thought'other
wise. The latter claimed that he had
never been able to secure a cot>y of the
commission's .report, hence the reading
must be proceeded with, as it was the only j
means of his obtaining a knowledge of the |
testimony.
Mr. Foote is no longer a young man,
and his circulation or blood is rather slug
gish. He stood the morning's reading
fairly well, but in t:,e afternoon he sue- I
cum bed and even snored.
A few moments before the adjournment
Assistant Attorney-General Anderson,
who was reading the ponderous docu
ment, suggested that as the testi
mony of an important witness had
come to a period and that a further read
ing would spread into another day's pro
ceedings he thought it might be a good
place to stop.
"1 entertain the idea that almost, any
point in this reading would be a good
place to stop," calmly said Judge Mc-
Kenna.
This remark on the part of His Honor
was greeted with laughter by the counsel
who were not asleep, and alfthe others ex
cept Mr. Foote awakened. He might have
remained in the "land of Nod" much
longer but for a friendly nudge from ex-
Judge Daly.
" Wbaâ what's the matter?" he ex
claimed, with a start. He was all right
again in a few minutes.
Clement Bennett, the courtly court
stenographer, earned his $10 per day quite
easily. His presence in court is impera
tive to take down in shorthand any re
marks between the attorneys and the
court. It is not necessary to" take down
the reading of the committee's report.
Hence, Mr. Bennett is enabled to square
his well-nurtured frame away in his com
fortable armchair and become dead to the
world, providing he does not snore.
That is one thing Judge McKenna ob
jects to. He will not permit even the ex
haling whistle let alone the inhaling snore.
Wlun the noon recess was announced,
the day being Saturday, the general im
pression among counsel was that the usual
custom of a half holiday would be re
spected. But no. Not by a great aeal.
Judge McKenna felt it iiis duty to con
tinue the reading since the attorneys de
sired to have so much of it to go in evi
dence.
The evidence of Senator Stanford, inter
rupted the day previous, was resumed. It
covered the ground so well beaten already
by E. H. Miller and C. P. Hnntington's
testimony. He told how the very exist
ence of the overland road bas saved the
Government of the United States up to
January 1, 1888, for transportation of
troops, munitions of war and mails the
enormous sum of $139.347,741..
The Senator went into details as to the
great difficulties that had to be overcome
in order to build the road. He related to
the committee how in one instance it took
ten months to build five miles of track
near the station now known as the Sum
mit. Under favorable conditions it was
not unusual to build ten miles of track in
one day.
Korsefeed was hard to get and very ex
pensive. Hay cost $100 per ton and 15 cents
per pound was the charge for oats. In
some sections of the country water was ex
ceedingly scarce and frequently it had to
be hauled forty miles for the use of man
and beast.
Resuming the line of his testimony given
the committee the day previous Senator I
Stanford spoke of the incalculable benelit j
the railroad had been to California. Prior
to its beine built the consumers were com- j
pletely at the mercy of the merchants and |
prices of the necessaries of life were made j
to jump up to fabulous and prohibitive |
figures for the benefit of speculators, who !
took advantage of the long time it took to ]
get provisions into tbe country by water- j
way.
"In those days," said the Senator, "mer
chants were compelled to carry stock for
six months or more, while it is unnecessary
now carry over a two months' stock.
Money, therefore, need no longer lie use
less, and with $50,000 now as much can be
done as with $500,000 in olden times."
Some of the difficulties under which the
Central Pacific road first came to the
front were explained as antagonistic local
and State legislation. This was mainly in
the shape of bills inspired by malice and
<rro â¢â  ' As a rule, the Senator explained,
tli is were so extreme in their malice
th;.. Â.?>â  fell by the weight of their own
wroiiÃ intention. If some of these bills
had been less venomous they might have
gone through.
The new constitution created a Board
of .Railroad Commissioners, giving them
most absolute power in regulating freisnts
and fares. The Senator believed that said
creation was unconstitutional, but he had
never cared to test its validity.
He detailed how the Government in
sisted that, in addition to building a rail
road, the Central Pacific must also build
a telegraph line. This antagonized the
telegraph company. In 'addition to this
opposition there was that of the California
Steam Navigation Company, the Pacific
Mail, the Sacramento Valley Railroad,
the Stage ana Express Company, the
Pony Express and other institutions â
even the Sitka Ice Company, which
charged 5 cents per pound for iceâ were
all against the Central Pacitic Company,
and did their utmost to impair its credit in
England, France and Germany.
The case will be resumed to-morrow
morning.
IN SOUTH AFRICAN MINES.
What Some Californians Are Do
ing in the Dark Con
tinent.
Sketches of the Operations and
Achievements of a Few Well-
Known Native Sons.
One "soft snap," out of which most of
the Californians made money when they
first went to the Rand in South Africa,
was the want of extra-lateral rights to the
locations.
A locator on the Rand is entitled to
only so much of the vein as is directly
beneath hia surface location. In this
country the owner of a location is entitled
to the vein on which he locates, as it goes
down with all its "dips and spurs and
ancles, " no matter whether it goes outside
of lines drawn from his side lines to the
center of the earth or not.
The early locators on the Rand knew
little Oi the formation of veins or reefs
and were content with the first location.
Ihe Cnliiornians knowine that the reef
would, as they went down, go beyond the
side lines, therefore located on the side of
the "pitch" and simply waited for the
hrst locator to develop their mines. In
this way many of them obtained valuable
mines and had them prospected without
cost to themselves.
The reefs of the Rand are very different
in formation from the quartz veins of this
country. Tney are beds of conglomerate,
in a general way similarly placed to beds
or seams of coal. The existence of gold in
them is much more uniformly distributed
than in quartz veins.
As to how the gold came into the reefs
there is no uniformity of opinion among
authorities. It is suggested that it must
have come in by precipitation from solu
tion at the time of the formation of the
beds or by subsequent infiltration. There
is no sign of wash. The gold is both
free and in sulphured, and is worked In
the same way as quartz.
Besides Hammond and Butters, whose
careers have been ptren in The Call, the
records of the leading Californians are
given in the following: Hennen Jennings,
who was one of the first Californians to go
to Africa, is the consulting engineer for a
large number of the most important mines
He is a native of Kentucky, a graduate of
Harvard and was at first a civil engineer
by profession. He was superintendent of
the Ruby drift mine in Sierra County, O f
the New Almaden quicksilver mine, and
later went to Venezuela to take charge of
the celebrated El Callao gold mine owned
by the Rothschilds. He has become wealthy
in the Rand. His wifo is a daughter of one
of the Colemans of Grass Valley.
Joseph Curtis was one of the first of the
i Californians to report favorably on the
value of the Rand mines. He is a eradu
ate of Freiberz and made quite a reputa
tion on this coast. For a time he was on
the United States Geological Survey and
j attracted attention by his work descriptive
of the Eureka ore deposits. He is now
wealthy and largely interested in city
property in Johannesburg. He is Bi
be the* only Californian who ha
nounced that he will make his permar.ent
home there.
Henry C. Perkins is probably as well
known among mining men as any one in
Africa. He went from the New Alraadi n
to the North Bloomtield gravel mines with,
Inilton Smith. There he inventt
cms d Sector, one of the most im
ant inventions ever made in connec
with hydraulic mining. Hamilton
th in time became consulting engineer
for the Rothschilds in London, and
Perkins went down to take charge of the
El Callao mines in Venezuela. He was
succeeded by Hennen Jennings, and joined
Smith A De (Jrano in London in the man
agement of the Exploration Company and
went to Africa for that company. He has
got rich out of the Rand mines. He is
now establishing the largest series of min
ing plants in the world for deep mmmc.
H. H. Webb went out about eitrht
months ago. He is a graduate of the Min
ing College of the University of California
and of the Royal School of Mines Pt Frei
berg, Saxony, and was known as one of the
best metallurgists on the coast. Ha was at
Anaconda for a time, and later at the
Selby Smeltine Works. He left here on a
salary of #15,000 a year.
Tom Mem has made a reputation even
among the big men on the Rand. He bad
charge of the Alaska Treadwell mines.
Victor X. Clement went out at the insti
gation of Jack Hammond, under whom ha
had been the manager of the Bunker Hilt
and Sullivan mines.
E. H. Garthwaite left here about six
months ago. He is a graduate of the col
lege ot mines, University of California,
and of Freiberg.
Tom Leggett, a graduate of the Colum
bia bchool of Mines, was well known hera
as superintendent of the Standard mines
of Bodie.
., Je |, Clark, who was superintendent of
the Gladstone" mine in Shasta, St. Aubyu
of the Niagara mine in Trinity, and As
semblyman J. H. Tibbetts were among the
late departures for Africa.
These are but a small part of the Califor
nians in the Rand. Besides the managers
and superintendents, hundreds of mill
men, assayers, surveyors, timbermen and
foremen went down to assured positions,
and many others on their own account.
Up to a late hour last night neither
General Harris nor Major Hammond had
received any further news about the im
prisonment of J. H. Hammond. Yester
day morning Major Hammond received

COOPERS STILL DEFIANT.
Declare the Old Price! Must Be Re-
stored â Superintendent Miller
Gives His Opinion.
The strike of the coopers employed at the
Pacific Woodenware and Cooperage
Company is still on, though there is pros
pect of an amicable settlement by Monday
next.
'It is to be regretted." said Superintend
ent Miller yesterday, '"that the men cannot
see the matter as we do. The cut was
simply a necessity brought about by a drop
in prices. In order to continue in business
we asked the men to accept a uniform cut
of not quite 10 per cent on piecework.
"It is true unit on one article we made a
reduction of 50 per cent on former prices
but the cause for this was that we did noc
longer desire to do that class of work I
nave reason to think the men will return
to work Monday, though as yet we have no
assurance of this. We nave nothin- what
ever to do with the Coopers' Union and
most assuredly will not arbitrate the
matter with them. In fact there is nothing
to arbitrate. If they refuse to work at thf
prices we now offer the factory will close
down. It would pay us better to do that
than to run at a loss."
The striking coopers, however, ara
determined not to accept the cut. They
declare that it is preferable to remain Mle
than to submit to an injustice or sacrifice

How Assessor Dalton Will Combine
Duty With Pleasure in Assisting
Clerk Jordan.
Oakland Offi< R Sas Francisco CAix,) y
Broadway, Jan. 18. )
William H. Hutlield has filed an amend
ed answer to the suit of Harriet J. Graham,
his ex-wife, in which he makes some re
markable statements. He alleges that she
was awarded the custody of their minor
child and he agreed to pay $20 a month for
its maintenance. In violation of this
agreement she abandoned the child and
left it in the province of Ontario. He de
clares that said province of Ontairo is a
foreign state and a dependency of Great
Britain, and as such is at present on un-
Jriendly terms with the United States.
Hattield claims he is entitled to the cus
tody of the child, and that the plaintiff
persists in keeping it in exile against his
will. He charges that the effect of Cana
dian schooling and the teaching to which
he is subjected are and will be deemed to
inspire the youthful and susceptible mind
of said minor child with a spirit of hos
tility toward the United States and con
tempt for American institutions, and thus
effectually destroy the seeds of that patri
otism which defendant desires and has
striven to inculcate in the mind of said
minor child.
liis also alleged that St. Catherines, the
city where the child is at school, is near
the American border, and, in the event of
war, he would be in great bodily danger.
He, therefore, prays the court to order the
child returned to California. - .

ACCOMMODATING OFFICIALS.
How Assessor Daltou Will Assist County
Clerk .Jordan Registering Electors.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 18.â County As
sessor Henry P. Dalton, who, by the re
cent opinion of District Attorney Snook to
the Board of Supervisors, it has been
found, shall assist in the registration of
electors in the county, has evolved a neat
scheme, which will cause all applicants for
registration to give his office a wide berth.
It is the duty of the Assessor's office to
collect a poll tax of $2 from every male
in the county between the ages of 21 ana
60 years. It has never been collected to
any great extent, for reasons best known
to those who have held that office. Mr.
Dalton says he will gladly assist the clerk
in registering the electors, and at the Fame
time will invite them to poy their poll tax.
In this way he hopes to save the office ex
pense and trouble in collecting the tax and
also to materially increase the revenue
from this source. . .

They "Were Frightened. t',U : ;
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. What might
have been a fatal accident occurred last

the heavy rainstorm. The private carriage
of Attorney A. A. Moore, containing
Misses Ethel and Carmen Moore, Marian
Goodfellow, daughter of W. S. Goodfeliow,
â nd Covington Pringle, all of East Oak
land, was run down from the rear by a car
of the Haywards electric line without the
least warning.
â¢~ When the driver first heard the silent
but swift approaching car he had the
presence of mind to put the whip to his
animals and keep them going straight
ahead. This prevented an upset and gave
the motortnan an opportunity to stop his
car. The roadway is in such a deplorable
condition at the point mentioned that
teams have to be driven on the car track to
get across the estuary at all.

SOME RARE INDEPENDENCE.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. j
Three Oakland young ladies and one
from San Francisco, all native daughters,
have determined to receive the benefit of a
I finished musical education in Europe.
Not being the daughters of millionaires
they have found it necessary to earn the
: money for such a big undertaking. This,
I however, has not daunted them. They
have formulated a plan by which they
j hope to be able to gratify the ambition of
their lives. They have banded together
. and have decided to tour the State as a
female quartet. Every possible cent will
j be saved and by this means the European
I tour may be z. possibility. The necessity
of their taking this means is rendered
more imperative, owing to the fact that,
with one exception, all are fatherless.
The quartet consists of May E. Barring
ton, Mabel Crabtree, Anee C. Barrington
; and Charlotte Gruenhagen. They were
I mutual friends in the Saturday Morning
, Orchestra of San Francisco, and recently
I they banded for mutual beneiit. Last
| week they gave their first public concert
at the Petaluma Opera-house under the
auspices of the Petaluma Social Club, and
the affair was such a financial and social
success that the young ladies were greatly
encouraged.
Miss May E. Barrington is a soloist and
play? the viola, Miss Crabtree is an expert
j violinist, Miss Anee Barrington handles
j the cello and Miss Gruenhagen is well
â  known on both sides of the bay as a violin-
J Ist. They are assisted at the?e concerts
by Miss Pearl Noble and Miss Maude
Noble of Alameda, who play the cornet
and trombone respectively. Miss Pearl

AN INDOOR BIKE RACER
Ingenious Contrivance by Two
Berkeley Men for Facil

Got Back His Rigâ Another West End
Liquor Raidâ News Notes of
Interest
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 18.â The latest
and most ingenious contrivance which
has been made known for bicyclists is an
indoor training and racing machine. By
THE NEW INDOOR RACING MACHINE IN OPERATION.
its use the rider can be surrounded with
j practically the same conditions as he
â  would if he were pumping his bike along
a beaten country road or a well-kept race
track. The apparatus has been recently
invented by W. R. Stamper, an instructor
in practical mechanics at thÂ« University of
California, and George S. Wilcox, a Berke
ley photographer.
It consists of two planks twelve feet
long and set three feet apart, upon which
I rest six rollers, set in ball bearings. Three
I of these rollers are for the use of each
| cycler. One of them is placed about four
| feet from the others, and upon this is sup
i posed to rest the front wheel of the bicycle.
I The hind wneel of the machine is intended
to rest on the other two rollers, which are
set about a foot apart. The drive-roller,
or the middle one, is connected to the
front one by a cylindrical leather belt, by
the use of which both the drive-roller and
the one upon which the front wheel of the
bicvclo rests may revolve with like
rapidity.
This simultaneous movement of the two
forward rollers is what keeps the bicycle in
position, and upon this single point rests
the entire success and practicability of the
apparatus. The third roller is wholly free
from any attachments and acts simply as
a steadying power for the hind wheel. To
the front roller is attached a rod which is
made to revolve by means of gearing with
each revolution of the roller itself. To the
end of this rod also is attached another
rod which is geared with such mechanical
accuracy that it registers on a dial each
sixteenth of a mile.
If used for an exhibition the wheelmen
who are to do the riding may come out
from behind the scenes on their wheels
and take their positions on the racing ma
chine without dismounting. The one
thing for which the device is particularly
remarkable is the fact that the riders can
maintain their ec.uilibrum with as little or
less effort than if on an ordinary racing
course. The best time made thus far on
this indoor racer is two minutes. The one
which Will ox & Stamper now have on ex
hibition will be used for the first time in
public at the next Olympic entertainment.
Charles Butters' Friends Alarmed.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Jan. 18.â The rela
tives of Charles Batters, the mining en
gineer and metallurgist who is now con
fined at Johannesburg, South Africa, by
the Boers for the evident purpose of con
fiscating his property, are very much
alarmed. A cablegram was received by
his mother last night, which read as fol
lows: "Charles Butters and six others
have been single' l out and placed by them
selves. Their property has been confis
cated. Prompt action is necessary in
order to save both lives and property."
Upon its receipt a telegram was sent to
Governor Budd asking that he request
President Cleveland to communicate at
once with Krnger, demanding protection
of Butters and his fellow-captives. No re
sponse from either Governor Budd or Pres
ident Cleveland was received up till late
last night. Harry batters, a brother of
Charles, who has recently returned from
South Africa and is in a position to appre
ciate the gravity of the present situation
there, left for Washington on the overland
to-night for the purpose of personally
seeking protection for the confined men
through the President. The property of
Charles Butters is valued at over $500,000,
wliien will all go to the Boers unless some
immediate measure is interpo&ed.
Got Back His Rig.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 18.â Sanitary
Inspector Frank Thompson is a happy
man. It will be remembered that he re
cently purchased at Sheriff's sale a horse
and cart which was taken from Fred
Fonzo to satisfy a judgment held against
him. Shortly after the sale Mrs. Fonzo
came forward and sued out a writ of re
plevin, claiming that the turnout belonged i
to her rather than her husband, and was
therefore exempt from attachment for his I
debts. Thompson's attorney after work
ing on the case for a time found that the
bondsman on the writ of replevin had not
qualified. Accordingly he went to the
hvery stable where the hortse was kept and
made a demand for it. The animal was
secured and turned over to Thompson,
much to Fonzo's displeasure. It is under
stood that Fonzo proposes to fight the case
to a finish.

THE CHANCE OF HIS LIFE
Councilmen Pass a Resolution
That Will Be Used as a
Boomerang.
WANT POINTS ABOUT SAVIN&
A Discovery Made in the Mayor's
Office That Will Provoke Much
Discussion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. f
As Mayor Davie was going through his
orders from the City Council to-day be
made a startling discovery. He discovered
a little resolution that caused him to
chuckle mightily. For a long time his
Honor has wished for just such an oppor
tunity. The resolution was a very inno
cent looking short affair, but it was so
clearly an invitation from the City Coun
cil to censure that body that the Mayor
decided to take immediate advantage of it.
The resolution authorized the Board of
Works, of which the Mayor is chairman,
to propose a plan by which $100 a month
can be saved from present expenditure to
provide a salary for a landscape gardener
for the city parks.
"Save $100 per month," said the Mayor.
"It is an easy matter to show them how
to save $1000. In the first place let us
begin right here in our Board of Works.
Commissioner Piersol should be made to
do his own work as City Attorney.
"The Council has voted $500 to pay able
attorneys to handle the Harrison-street
opening. Let them rescind that resolu
tion and that will support a landscape
gardener for five months. There is a
political ward in Piersol's office drawing
a salary of $75 per month. Give him an
opportunity to earn a living and that will
make $140(i for a year that can be saved.
Then put in a competent Superintendent
of Streets and the saving in material will
be about $100 per month. Then take steps
to cut the $500 from the annual salary oi
the Superintendent of Schools that he is
drawing in open detiance of the charter.
Then take the ordinance appropriating
$14,000 for the Eighth-street bridge and
make the water and railroad companies
pay their shares and that will save a few
thousands.
"Then reorganize the extra department
of the Fire Department and instead of
paying salaries to a lot of boys and in
capables, pay a few good salaries to some
competent men who will always be on
duty. This will be an improvement and
will save money.
"Save a hundred dollars a month!"
cried the Mayor. "Why, they're crazy.
I'll send them an answer to their resolu
tion only too willingly. I cannot express
my astonishment that any such resolution
should have been sent to the board. I
will send them a practical reply that will
be an answer to their query and to the
most elaborate defense of the dollar tax
levy that ever was prepared. It cannot be
sad, in this instance, that I forced my
communication upon them.
"Of course I do not know what recom
mendations Piersol and Wilson may make,
but they will hardly agree with me, as my
figures are too practical."
Then Mayor Davie called for Ms private
secretary and commenced to obey the
mandate of the Council.

WRECKED IN THE GALE.
A Young Sailor Loses His Craft
and Is Washed Onto
the Rocks.
On a Voyage to Bay Farm Island
When the Storm Overtook
Him.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Cam,.)
90S Bkoadway. Jan. 18. >
F. Lewthwaite of East Oakland, was
shipwrecked near Bay Farm Island dur
ing last night's pale, and although his
sloop was lost, he was fortunate enough to :
escape drowning. He was badly beaten
on the rocks and sustained many injuries,
and but for the timely arrival of an
Italian fisherman he would have fallen a
victim to the storm.
Lewthwaite left Oakland in the evening
to sail his sloop to Bay Farm Island.
When about half-way toward his destina
tion the tide turned, and with it the gale
sprang up and the lad knew that nothing
but the best of seamanship could save him.
"I tried all I could to beat off the rocks,"
said Lewthwaite this evening, "but no
sloop could beat against such fierce winds
and breakers. My sail blew away and the
next instant the boat half filled and was
carried on top of the breakers toward the
rocks. I tried to use the oars, but the
sloop was too large to be handled that
way. I could not even keep her head on
to the breakers, and so I prepared myself
to jump out and try to swim ashore when
it should be necessary.
"I drifted about till after midnight, and
just as the last train came up from the
mole the sloop struck the rocks. It
bounced up and down for a little while
ana the breakers rolled clear over her. At
last I saw that the sloop was doomed, and
as the wind was increasing I made up my
mind to try to get ashore. I jumped out
into the surf and was nearly knocked in- j
sensible on the rocks. 1 scrambled up j
toward the mole several times, but slipped :
back into the water.
"I struggled for about a couple of hours !
â  and was just about to give up, as I was I
| numbed with the cold and terribly bruised i
from the rocks, when I attracted the at- i
tention of a fisherman who was groping
his way down the mole to look after the
safety of his boat. It was one of the dark- i
est, wildest nights I have ever seen on the
bay and I never want to experience the
same again."
Lewthwaite is known as one of the
smartest young sailors on the bay, and
to-day he is only able to get about with
the aid of a stick.
IS NOT MISSING.
The Would-Be Benedict Has Merely
Gone Away to Better HU
Condition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 18. Â»' |
The sensational story in regard to the j
mysterious disappearance of Eugene J.
Drussell of 918 Filbert street on
the eve of his wedding has been
exploded. The story was to the
effect that the young man, who
was in the employ of Stocker & Holland,
searchers of records, as a copyist is miss
ing. He had made love to Miss Ada M.
Weston, a young lady who was associ
ated with him in the work. The two had
arranged to be married last Wednesday
evening and go to housekeeping at once.
The bride-eleut had even so far as
to give up her position and made all the i
preparations for the great event of a girl's ;
life. The guests had all arrived and then !
the groom failed to appear.
The young man on investigation, the j
story goes on, had left his home with $80 j
with which to enjoy the honeymoon. That I
was the last his folks have seen of him. It !
was said that he had mysteriously left for
parts unknown and it" was hinted that
there was another girl at the bottom of the
affair. The story then goes on at length
berating the man and extending sympathy j
for a girl who should be placed in such an
unpleasant position.
The young lady referred to is a sister of :
Mrs. Max Glas of Alameda, who was seen
to-day regarding the affair, and said suffi- i
cient to destroy the effect of the whole ;
story. "Mr. Drussell was always a perfect j
gentleman," said she, "and acted perfectly â 
honorably with my sister. lam not wor
ried about his disappearance. He was not
getting sufficient to keep a wife where he
was working, and I have no doubt has
gone somewhere to accept a better posi- ,
tion. lam sorry the affair has gained so
much publicity as it has. It can result in
no good, and may injure the young peo
ple. When the time comes things will be
straightened out all right. We are not at
all worried over it."
The Red Sea takes its name from the
fact that portions of it are covered with
minute animalcules which dye the water.

WADDILL'S WHITE
WIFE HAS ELOPED.
Colored Barber Deserted and
Child and Money Also
Gone.
A RICH MAN'S DAUGHTER
Mrs. Waddill Ran Away From
Home and Married When
Sixteen Years Old.
THREE YEARS IN THIS CITY.
She Has Lived in Seclusion on Jessie
Street, Near the Rear of the
Palace Hotel.
Mrs. W. M. Waddill of 189 Jessie street,
the white wife of a prosperous young
colored barber, has disappeared and her
husband thinks that she has eloped. She
MRS. W. M. WADDILL.
[Reproduced from a photograph.]
went away three days ago, taking her
three-year-old son, a bright and pretty
mulatto boy.
A bankbook with entries of savings to
the amount of $1100, standing in the boy's
name, is also gone, and Mr. "Waddill says
that his wife had $70 in cash at the time of
her departure.
Behind tie record of this 'disappearance
ending nearly three years of life in San
Francisco, is the story of a girl's marriage
at the age of 16 yearsâ away from home
and without the consent or knowledge of
her wealthy father.
Mrs. "vVaddill was a Montreal girl. And,
indeed, she is hardly more than a girl now,
for although she is the mother of a three
year-old child and has been married five
years, she is but 21 years old.
George W. Bukel, the wealthy owner of
a Montreal flouring-mill, is the father of
the young woman, and the marriage to
"Waddill was without his consent. Wad
dill, as the deserted husband relates the
Btory, was employed by Bukel in connec
tion with the milling business. He was a
Willie Waddill. the Deserted Barber's
Three-Year-Old Son.
[Reproduced from a photograph.]
bright and industrious young man, and
through the confidence his employer had
in him he worked his way up to the posi
tion of traveling agent.
The youthful colored man frequently
met the younger of Mr. Bukel's two daugh
tersâSarah Bukelâ and a mutuai attach
ment was formed, though Miss Bukel was
at that time a mere schoolgirl of 14 years.
After a while Waddill gave up his position,
why is not stated, and he went away from
Montreal.
Later, however, Miss Bukel went to
visit her married sister, whose home is in
"Winnipeg, and there she and Waddill met
again. They were married on February
5, 1891, at the sifter's house, Waddill
alleges, and for a time they remained at
Winnipeg. Waddill established a barber
shop there. After tbat the couple lived at
various places, three years ago reriioving
to Chicago. They remained at Chicago
during the World's Fair and then came to
San Francisco to attend the Midwinter
Fair.
It was the intention of the Waddilla to
remain in San Francisco only a short
time, but they liked the City and con
cluded to remain here. The husband
opened a barber-shop at 189 Jessie street
and fitted up the second story of the build
ing as his home. There the family has
lived in seclusion, Mrs. Waddill helping
her husband in the shop at times, but
mingling little in society of any kind.
"She always seemed to be happy here,"
said Mr. Waddill yesterday, " and I was
astonished to lind that she had run away.
She never said- anything about going and
never even hinted that she wanted to go.
ller parents may have wanted her to re
turn to Canada, but I am very sure that
she has not gone to them.
"Yes, the family is rich â very rich, in
deed. My wife's father, Mr. Buhel, is one
of the wealthy citizens of Montreal. He
owns a very important milling business,
and he also has valuable interests at Nor
man. Ont. Mrs. -WaddiU's uncle is Hiram
Walker of the rich whisky lirrn of
WaJker <fc Sons of Walkersville, Ont.
"I do not think that Sadie has gone to
her relatives, and my opinion is that she
has eloped. There was a young white
fellow that used to come here some, and
she may have gone with him, but I don't
want to accuse ncr of that until I know.
"We were always prosperous and I gave
my wife a good home. When we came
here I put $1100 in the savings bank for
our son Willie. The money was in il
lie's name and I was the trustee. My wife
has taken the child and the bankbook
with her. Of course, she can't get the
monej, and neither can I, so it will re- j
main in bank for the little one. Besides
the bankbook my wife took about $70 of
cash that we had in the house."
Mr. Waddill says that some time ago his
wife became jealous and that she may
have run away on that account. "Some
body told her that I was acquainted with
a young French lady," is the barber's
statement. "She did not like that; but
the assertion was entirely untrue."
Mr. Waddill acquired some familiarity
with the French language at Montreal;
but he declares that he has no French ac
quaintances here.
A detective has been engaged to search j
for the young wife, and if she can be
found Mr. WaddiU will endeavor to per- j
suade fier to return.
Y. M. C. A. WON.
Lick School Defeated at Football by
the Lightweight Eleven.
Score 6 to O.
The Y. M. C. A. lightweight football
team defeated the California School of
Mechanical Arts yesterday afternoon, at
Central Park,' by a single touchdown,
scored about the middle of the first half.
In consequence of their victories over
much heavier teams the Christian Asso
ciation juveniles are now eager to meet
any eleven on the coast the average
â¢weight of which does not exceed 140
pounds. Yesterday's contest was the
sixth of the season, and they have not met
with a single defeat. They have played
two tie games with Lowell High School
and will try conclusions again a week from
next Saturday, when they hope to settle
the rivalry in their favor.
The Mount Tamalpais Military Academy
is scheduled for a game on February 1, to
be played in San Rafael. The Trinity
School eleven is another team that the
ambitious youths have on their list.
The play yesterday was characterized by
persistent line bucking, directed princi
pally against the tackles. For the Y. M.
C. A. GaDlain Davidson distinguished
himself for his heavy bucking, and Frank
Bishop, his partner halfback, also did
good work. For the Lick School Speckt
was the most evident of successful players,
while Captain Forbes, Tillruan and Hub
bard got into the plays with a knack that
would have been commendable in more
experienced players.
Ronalson, Lick's center rush, was in
jured in one of the downs and had to be
removed. At first it was believed his leg
had been broken, but an examination at
the Receiving Hospital showed only a
slight sprain of the right ankle.
Like the Butte-Olympie game on Christ
mas, where both teams happened to have
the same club colors â red and white â so it
was with the Y. M. C. A. and the Lick
School with their red and yellow, which
made it impossible to distinguish the
partisans by the colors they sported.

Cayenne Pepper in His Eyes.
John Murphy and Dick Wreden, sailors on
board the ship City of Sydney, were drinking
in a saloon on Jackson and Kearny streets
early yesterday morning when they quarreled
ana Murphy threw cayenne pepper in Wre
den s eye*. Murphy was arrested and charged
at the California-street station with a felony
and Wreden was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where his eyes were attended to. It will
take some time before he is able to see with

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
IT ENDED IN A LAUGH
A Fee Which, While Not Cut,
Caused Consternation Among
Counsel.
JUDGE COFFEE MISUNDERSTOOD.
J. D. Sullivan Received $9000 When
He Expected $20,000 Under the
Court's Ruling.
The Blythe case has ended in a laugh â
a long, loud, ridiculous laugh, which
raised such a disturbance in the western
corridors of the City Hall that Judge
Coffey's bailiff had to come out of the
courtroom and yell for order. No one
thought that the proceedings of yesterday
would include any more than the mere
signing of the decree, but there were hopes
enough for a cityful dashed to the carpeted
floor of the courtroom and a cutting of
claims which made the claimants even
laugh at the ludicrous aspect of the whole
thing.
It was the cutting of the claims which
caused it all, and singularly enough the
big claim of J. D. Sullivan, upon which the
laugh centered, was not cut at all. Mr.
Sullivan expected to receive $20,000 under
Judge Coffey's ruling of Friday evening,
but he was allowed only $9000, and the
Judge said he had never had any idea of
giving him more. It was a loss of a phan
tom $11,000.
The session of yesterday was for the
purpose of hearing the rights and argu
ments of the claim of J. T. Greaney for
$2500 against the estate of Philip A. Roach
and the Blythe estate. It had been agreed
among the attorneys and Mrs. Hinckley
that in consideration of the attorneys for
the Roach estate consenting to the settling
of the accounts of the administrators, the
claim of Greaney should be paid. But
Judge Coffey would not allow it at all. and
then Garret McEnerney, who represented
the Roach estate, announced that he
would not stand by the agreement to con
sent, and would oppose the decree of dis
tribution. The court was firm, however,
ami refused to allow the fee. Then Judge
Coffey asked for the decree settling Pub
lic Administrator Freese's account and
also the fees of his attorney, J. D. Sullivan.
Herbert Chovnski passed up a type-writ
ten document and Judge Coffey took up
his pen. But a frown gathered on the
judicial countenance and he turned to the
attorneys to say severely, "This decree is
all wrong."
There was a flutter among counsel, for
no one knew just where the decree was
wrong, but the court soon enlightened
them.
"This decree," he said, "is drawn up so
as to allow Mr. Sullivan $20,000. That is
all wrong. I never allowed Mr. Sullivan
any such sum."
A bombshell could not have caused a
greater flurry. Mr. Sullivan was striding
up and down the corridor outside the
courtroom, but he seemed to catch the
news at once and came into the court in a
hurry. "I so understood your Honor,"
said Chovnski, as he took the paper which
the Judge shook at him. "I certainly un
derstood last night that your Honor had
allowed this fee."
"1 did no such thing," replied the court
"1 stated clearly and distinctly that I
would not allow the fee."
"I understood your Honor to say you
would allow it," interposed Mr. Sullivan.
"1 did no such thing," said the court.
"But I can bring twenty-live witnesses
I from the courtroom who will swear that
| you did."
"You can get any one to do as much
i swearing as you please, Mr. Sullivan. I
i will not argue the question."
"I can get fifty who will swear to It,"
I persisted Sullivan. "The court allowed
this fee last night, and I object to the
court changing its ruling in such a man
| ner."
"The court stated clearly that the fee
! would not be allowed."
"I did not so understand it," said
Choynski, but ho only brought wrath
upon his head.
"You are not an attorney of record In
I this case, Mr. Choynski, and will please
not enter this argument. Mr. Rix, did
yon bo understand it?"
"Iâ lâ don't knowâ your Honorâ"
commenced Rix, wishing to be non-com
mittal.
"I know that the court did allow the fee
last night," said Sullivan.
"It doesn't make any difference what
I the court ruled last night. I say now that
, the fee is not allowed. The record is the
i only evidence in the case."
"Well, let's have the record read," said
| half a dozen of the attorneys, but the court
j stopped them.
"I will not have any more of this." the
i Judge said. "Change that decree to $15,000
i including the $6000 already paid."
! "I except to this change of ruling," said
; Sullivan. "I will appeal from the order."
"Change that decree and I will sign it,"
said the court.
''I won't change it," answered Sullivan,
putting the paper in his pocket ; "they can
change it if they want to," and then all
but Hart and Rix trooped out into the
corridor.
Then they laughed. Sullivan as loud and
long as the rest, for the situation was ridic
ulous. Even the newspapers had gathered
different ideas from the Judge's remarks
of the night before, and their reports varied
accoidingly. Then every one commenced
explaining, each at the top of his voice
and each as fast as his tongue could wag.
They talked and argued and laughed and
shouted until riot seemed to have hold of
the place, and the bailiff had to shoo the
crowd further up the ball where the noisy
attorneys coulu not disturb the proceed
ings going on in the court.
In the midst of it all McEnerney gave
notice to Captain Freese that not a cent of
the $79,000 he holds in his hands should be
paid until the appeal from the decision
disallowing Greaney's cJaim, and Captain
Freese said he would see about it. Then
Sullivan went back into the court. He
still believed that the Judge had actually
decided to allow the $20,000 fee, and he or
dered the shorthand reporter to write up
such parts of the testimony as related to
the ruling so queerly misunderstood. The
stenographer wrote ur> the proceedings,
and he handed Sullivan the following as
his draft of the Judge's ruling:
This lady has agreed to pay Mr. Sullivan $26,
--000, including what he has received. She
wants to keep her agreement. I think a very
liberal compensation would be if 15,000 for the
same services. As to this amount, against
which I oiled Mr. McKnerney, not in prejudice
ot his client, who is here (Mr. Greaney), so far
as his accounts are concerned, tnat "does not
apply here. If this lady is goinn to be a phil
anthropist, so far as lawyers are concerned.it
is her right after the estate goes out of court.
I think, myself, compensation would be liberal
at about $15,000, and that far in excess of the
estimates, and that is why I make the turmoil
over these lost papers. That is far in excess of
the estimates placed upon the services of the
attorneys of the late Mr. McAllister by the liv
ing Judpe John Garber and by the living ex-
Judge Robert Y. Havne. That was in excess of
what they stated.
I state that now from memoryâ of course I
may safely state it since the records are de
stroyed without fear of contradiction ; and if
I should be contradicted 1 can only be contra
dicted by the developments of these records
by the persons who destroyed themâ that the
testimony was there inane that for services for
the first attorney in the estate, comprehending
a period of some years, for which he was paid
about half in that time, $12,500â 525,000
would be a good compensation. He subse
quently received $120,000 as compensation
fora period. I presume he received about
$80,000, if 1 am right in my figures.
Mr. .Sullivan, who is entitled to as much con
sideration as any of them, is ftbo,ut to receive
$26,000, and the court now states its opinion
the services will be liberally compensated at
$ 15,000, and that had the attorneys preceding
him been paid proportionately in like manner,
tiou would have received liberal compensa-

The remark to Mr. Hart was made be
cause that gentleman wearily looked at
nis watch during the Judge's remarks.
At the close of the words quoted, Mr.
builivan was jubilant. Had not the court
said: "Mr. Sullivan, * * * who is
about to receive $25,000," and was that not
enough to warrant his friends wringing
ms bands and speaking of future loan??
l.Â»e friends thought so, and had crowded
around him with congratulations.
After this, when the ruling they ex
pected was so changed, it caused conster

Later in the day the decree was fixed up

and that and the decree of final distribu

have, out it is more than probable that
Mrs. Hinckley will settle that as well as
Mr. Sullivan's fee herself.
A BURGLAR'S HASTY EXIT
He Entered the Residence of|
General Dimond, but Se
cured Nothing.
Mrs. John Jarboe, a Guest, Was
Awakened and Frightend the
House-Breaker Away.
A lone burglar effected an entrance
into the residence of General W. H. Di
mond, which is situated at the corner of
Washington and Taylor streets, early yes
terday morning, but fortunately before he
succeeded in looting the house he
awakened one of the occupants, who raised
an alarm. He made a hasty exit, but was
captured as soon as he reached the side
walk by Policeman Amos Williams.
Before the burglar succeeded in getting
into the house he tried three of the rear
windows, but these were securely fastened
and he was forced to abandon his under
taking. He then went to the south side of
the dwelling and managed to force the
dining-room window.
He entered the dining room and it was
presumed was making his way to the room
occupied by General Dimond, but he lost
nis bearings and entered the room occu
pied by Mrs. John Jarboe, who is a guest
of Mrs. Dirnond. Mrs. Jarboe was awak
ened by the burglar's fumbling about the
room in the darkness, and the lady suppos
ing it to be her son, Paul Jarboe, asked
him what he wanted. The house-breaker
made no answer, but ran downstairs and
jumped out of the window through which
he had a few minutes before effected an
entrance to the house.
He made his way to the sidewalk, but
was observed coming through the yard by
the policeman, who immediately placed
him under arrest. He cave the name of
Charles Miller.
The prisoner was taken to the Central
police station and detained to await an
investigation. No charge has as yet been
placed against him, andit is presumed
that he is an old hand at the lawless vo
cation, which has placed him behind the
bars.

PURSUING HER HUSBAND.
Mrs. Cleopatra Hill Seeks a
Divorce . on the Grounds
of Desertion.
HAS JOINED HIS FIRST WIFE.
. â 
All the Parties Are Prominent in
Oakland, Fresno and Local
Social Circles.
Attorney Porter Ashe, with the assist
ance' of the strong arm of the law, is
searching high and low for H. "W. Hill,
well known in business circles and until
quite recently proprietor of a drugstore
on Howard street.
Mr. Ashe's anxiety concerning the
whereabouts of the erstwhile druggist is
founded in the fact that he has a pretty
little client who is tired of her husband's
cruel ways and seeks redress in the di-
vorce courts. The husband is aware of
this, and he makes it his daily business to
keep away from people he does not know.
The attorney says, however, that unless
he comes forward and acknowledges ser
vice like a brave but erring knight, ne will
resort to the press, which in cases of this
kind do just as effective work as a score of
peace officers.
Bnck of this hunt for a missing husband
lies a pretty little romance, which had its
origin in Oakland some eight years ago.
At that time H. W. Hill, a druggist of
Oakland, wooed and won Miss Kitty Cham
berlain, the possessor of a handsome for
tune, and a great favorite in the 6ocial
world of the city across the bay. For
three years their domestic life was appar
ently one unruffled season of perfect bap
pin ess, and then something occurred which
is not down on the calendar of every day
events.
Miss Cleopatra Griffiths, a daughter of
S. \V. Griffiths of Fresno and a sister of
Banker S. N. Griffiths of the same place,
came to Oakland for a brief visit. It was
not long before she met Mr. Hill.
The druggist paid such marked atten
tion to Miss Griffiths as to arouse first the
jealousy and then the suspicion of his
wife that all was not as it should be. A
few months later Mrs. Hill applied for and
secured a divore and three days later Hill
married his second charmer.
For three years, according to the second
Mrs. Hill, all went well. They lived as
happy as love and money could make
them, and then the fickle druggist began
to amuse himself by seeking the society of
other ladies.
"His former wife seemed to think the
time had come for a grand coup," said
Mrs. Hill, "and she began to employ the
samp charms and wealth which had eight
years ago proven so irresistible. By de
grees her efforts told, and about seven
months ago Mr. Hill closed up his busi
ness with the avowed intention ox eoing to
Los Angeles to seek new iields. He told
me to await his return and I was foolish
enough to agree.
'â¢Well, he left, and I think really did go
to Los Angeles, drawn thither by the
charms of his first wife, and during the
three months he was gone not one cent did
he contribute to the support of myself or
little child. One day, about four months
ago, he suddenly returned to the City and
announced to me that he intended to go
back to his first and only love, and that I
could look out for myself. He intended,
he said, to make a flying trip to the East
and his divorced wife would accompany
him. She did co, the couple returning a
few weeks ago.
"He has visited me once since then, but
only to threaten my life should I take any
steps toward securing a divorce. I have
proof to back up all I say concerning his
conduct, and I intend to be free from such
a vile and fickle man."
Mrs. Hill is determined not to be de
pendent on her family for support, and,
with a view of providing some permanent
life work, is fitting herself for the stage.
She expects to make her debut in the
early spring, alter which it is her purpose
to organize a company of her own and
seek fame in new fields.
Their Comrade's Mother.
On December 20 David Hosran of 1535J4
Howard street died at the early age of 24
years, leaving his nged mother destitute and
alone In the world. Hogran was a plumber
and all his wages were spent for his mother's
benefit. He was an enthusiastic member of
the drum corp ot the Second Artillery Regi
ment. His comrades in the regiment upor
learning that Mrs. Hogan was in "need of their
sympathy and assistance at once began to
work in her behalf. Within a short lime ar
rangements were made for a ball, which took
Elace last evening for her benefit, which was

also said to be entitled to such a crest as is
granted to the gentry. The French and
Dutch arm? appear on the De la Montanya
carriages, arid the unique designs are re

The arms of the family of the late George
W. Gibbs consist of an o'd English design
surmounted by three broken tilting spears,
ensigned with a wreath, an effective con

TheHuhbard arms are quartered, with
three Hon.? passant, and the crest a boar's
head conped, collared and ringed, and in
its mouth a spear. The insignia was given
by Burke to the ancestral Hubbards of

The same arms are to be found on the

Dr. R. Beverly Cole is a direct descendant

'â¢My Americanism is of so sturdy a kind
} that I have not changed my mind even

I which I sprung," said the veteran physi

j Besides," continued Dr. Cole, "this is
serious business, going back too far in the
family history. You are in danger of find

Cole uses the armorial bearings of her an

The surviving relatives of Governor

The English line can be traced back as far
as the fourteenth century. There is a fam

however, and in the Heralds' College of
London an authority on German her
aldry has been found that cites the arms
of the Wastphalian family <>f Yon Hoyte,
which was modified to Haight. Simon
Hoyt was the lirst man who enjoyed the
distinction of being the tmigrant-in-chief
of the family. He came to Salem, Mass..
in 1628. The archives of pioneer Charles
town, Mass., contain the record that "the
family of one Simon Hoyt, with the ap
proval of hia Excellency, Governor Endi
cott, traveled through the woods from
Salem to explore and settle Charlestown,
where they found only one English house,
the palisaded and thatched house of a
smith."
A few years later Simon Hoyt was one
of the earliest settlers of Dorchester, Mass.
He was one of the first to take the oath of
freemen in Massachusetts, May 18, 1631.
An unbroken line of descent connects this
energetic pioneer with New England men
of local note, whose records for integrity
and enterprise reflected a luster upon the
good old name. Governor Haight's grand
father was born in Athens, N. V., in 1778.
He was equally distinguished as a lawyer
and soldier and was made major-eeneral
of the New York militia at the close of the
war of 1812.
Baron yon Schroeder's noble lineage is
recorded in all German heraldic works,
and boasts men of distinction in more
than one line of merit.
The late Leland Stanford came from a
line of English gentry. This is also true
of Timothy Hopkins.
The Babcock family has a line of titled
progenitors. Tne name has been modified
from Badcock, and the family is of Saxon
origin, the home of the direct ancestors
being in Essex County, England.
Among the representatives of the Hu
guenot families, which early found a home
in this country, are the Merrills. Peter
Merrill escaped from France during the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and served the
Virgin Queen with such heroism in the
held that she rewarded him by bestowing
& knighthood upon him. He emigrated to
America and settled at Newberry, Mass.,
whence the San Francisco branch of the
family come.
The Wingfield family, of which the
Bishop is the head, is of ancient origin.
The village of Wingfield, in Suffolk County,
England, is the ancestral seat. It derived
its name from the possession of the castle
at that point before the Norman conquest.
It is not generally known that De la
Fontaine, whose fables are a classic, was
endowed with the distinction of being
made a marquis to compensate him in
part for the pleasure he gave the people of
his mother country by his literary produc
tions. The acquisition of a coat-of-arms
and frequent association with other noble
men made no material change in his gen
eral habits, and he continued to write
fables and stories just as though he had
never received the approval of his Kinc.
Originally the Marquis sprang from the
peasantry and in consequence had a large
family of poor relations, who were ready
and anxious to receive assistance from
him. He administered it in the shape of
educations, and from this imaginative
man sprang one of the most substantial
families in the French kingdom. They
were educated, intellectual people.
Many of them came to this country dur
ing the Revolution, and three of the broth
ers were with the Marquis de La Fayette
in his struggle to assist the Americans.
One of them returned to France and was
knighted for bravery in the field. The
second was killed at the battle of the
Brandywine and the third remained in
this country after taking to wife the
daughter of a French colonel in Rhode
Island. From this couple sprang those o.
the #mily who still live in America, where
the name to-day, owing to intermarriage,
has become Kobair de la Fontaine.
There is in this City at the present time
one of the family in the person of General
Oliver Roberts, who prefers that rather
American cognomen to the French adapta
tion. General Roberts married the daugh
ter of State Treasurer Turley of Nevada,
but at the present time he is a resident of
this City. He has lived the greater part
of his life on the Pacific Coast, and instead
of producing fables like his illustrious
ancestor he has a fondness for gold
mining, which is both a pleasure and an
occupation for him. He still possesses
some of the characteristics of the earlier
French people, and is 6 feet in height,
with dark, curly hair, a massive head and
brown, impressive eyes.
A MECHANICAL HGURER.
The Best Calculating Machine Invented
lÂ»y a Frenchman.
A young Frenchman, Leon Bollee, has
succeeded in completing a most wonderful
calculating machine of his own invention,
which outclasses anything in the way of
comptometers, adders and registering ma
chines shown before. The new machine
does all the figuring automatically, and no
matter whether it is a question of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, equa
tion, extraction of roots, reduction or dif
ferentiation, the result is arrived at with
rapidity hard to believe, and is invariably
correct. At a recent meeting of the Insti
tute of France, Mr. Bollee showed and
demonstrated his new machine, and the en
thusiasm created by the exhibition was so
spontaneous that the members of the in
stitute present immediately addressed a
petition to the Minister of the Interior to
confer upon the young inventor the cross
of the Legion of Honor. As to its work it
is simply perfection itself. Examples were
given by several mathematicians present,
and they ligured out some of the results, to
test Bollee's new machine, without finding
a single error. One lightning calculator
tried to beat the machine with the aid of a so
called comptometer, but when Bollee gave
the result, the lightning calculator had only
just begun to put down the first row of
figures. It is almost impossible to explain
in writing how the machine works; one
example may suffice: It took Bollee a
trifle less than three seconds to get correct
results of the following multiplication:
6.222,3.33,444 by 8,888,111,224, which is in
figures, 55.304, 791, 72:;,05t;,Â«J75,45fJ, or, writ
ten out, fifty-five quintiliions, three hun
dred and four quadrillions, seven hundred
and ninety -one trillions, seven hundred
and twenty-three billions, eighty-six mil
lions, nine hundred and seventy-five thous
and and four hundred and fifty-six.
The machine is not only an arith
metical wonder, but it is equally interest
ing from the standpoint of mechanical
ingenuity. It contains no less than 3000
different parts of steel or copper. It is
divided into two distinct and independent
sections â the "receiver" and the "cal
culator." The "receiver" consists of a
rectangular framp, supported at the ends
by two vertical posts; this row is filled
in with two rows of twenty r.umber
wheels each, every one of these wheels
being fitted with a pinion and numbered
from oto9 on the rim. There is but one.
figure on each wheel visible from the
outside through a slot on the cover of the
frame.
Between every two wheels of each row
there are three thin steel rods, one before
the other; they are provided with cogs and
slide up and down vertically between
grooved rails. Each of these rods en
pages and turns a different figure wheel.
There are as many groups of these rods as
there are ligure-wheels; that is twenty
times three in each row, or 120 in all. The
"calculator" part of the machine 13 thg
principal organ of the whole. It is a sort
of metallic case, which has on its upper
surface ten grooves, each of which is pro
vided with ten notches, numbered from
0 to 9, in which the buttons of
ten so-called calculating plaques, glid-
ing on the flat bottom inside of the
calculator, may catch. By means of a
manipulator the entire calculator is moved
along on two horizontal steel rods, which
are themselves turning ten times as fast
as the small vertical-cogged rods spoken
of above. The advancement from one
wheel to the next is therefore determined
by a complete turn of the manipulator.
Each of the inner plaques is a representa
tive of a part of the multiplication table.
The present state of the machine permits
the figuring of all the problems likely to
occur, since a iigure containing more than
twenty ciphers is but seldom required;
and all the work on this machine is done
in less than one-thirtieth part of the time
necessary for a rapid calculator.
Leon Bollee is only 25 years old, but haa
an enviable record as an inventor. He is
the son of a wealthy bell-founder and
manufacturer of steamcars, and had excel
lent training in the mechanical arts early
in life. He began work on the calculating
machine just described in 1888 at the age
of 18, and has accomplished much success
in other directions, as there are no less
than thirty-seven practical inventions of
his now patented. Most of these are
improvements and independent novel
ties referring to the propulsion of boats,
bicycles, automobile carriages, printing
machinery, measuring apparatus, time
keeping apparatus for factories and many
other useful objects. Among his admir
ers he has been nicknamed the "French
Edison." and with his youth and his rec
ord up to date there is no telling where he
may bring up yet.â New York Times.
HE SPARED THE TREE.
A Curious Way of Baring an Old Land-
mark in a New Jersey Town.
It was announced a week ago that one
of the most notable trees in this country
was doomed by the march of improve
ment. It is a huge and ancient sycamore,
or buttonball, standing in the middle of
the sidewalk in Stephen street, Belleville.
Records show this tree to be at least '_'oO
years old, and in that time it has grown
to a diameter of seven feet at the butt.
The sycamore is invariably a mobt pictur
esque tree, and this is one of the most
picturesque of sycamores.
Contractor McCann, who is engaged
upon the task of widening and straighten
ing Stephen street, decided that the tree
must be cut down, and it really looked as
if the monarch would be overthrown, for
there is little of that sort of sentiment
in Belleville which would move to save a
tree when there is plenty to talk abcut in.
the political held.
There was one man who loved the
tree enough to go to the contractor
with the familiar lines, "Woodman,
spare," etc. It was Christian Or
tholf, the barber, whose shop 13
on the corner of \Viiliam and Stephen
streets, and is overshadowed by the big
tree. He is a good singer and he rendered
the old poem so well that tears came into
Contractor McCann's eyes and he prom
ised to "touch not a single bough," but
said that he would have to do something
to the old trunk, nnd finally decided to cut
an arched passage through it. This win
amuse the children and satisfy their eld
ers, as it will probably save the old tree for
years to come. When the electric-light
ing plant is completed an incandescent
light will be put over the arch on each side
of the tree. â Newark (N. V.) Sunday Call.

to Enlistâ How Deserters and
Criminals Are Detected.
"Recruits? Ye?, they flock in like ducks
in rainy weather," remarked Dr. Lowndea
of the United States marine recruiting
station. "The hard times drove them in at
a brisk pace, until now we can afford to
accept only first-class applicants for the

They are preferable of course, and espe

they are desirable. It may be said that
while 'many are called few are chosen.'
The other morning sixteen applicants ap

one was passed.
"The applicant who is successful here is
sent over 10 Mare Island for final inspec
tion, and if the commander there is satis
fied he is put in the reserve; if not, he is
returned to this office. So it is not a sure
for a recruit until he has passed offi
cial scrutiny on the island.
"i'es, we meet some strange capes," con
tinued the doctor. "Only a few days ago,
for instance, a tall, fine-featured man, in
rather a neat suit of clothes, asked to
be examined. He had the general appear
ance of a gentleman. As he prepared for
examination I noticed that the man was
exceedingly nervous. His face bore a
pained look. 1 gazed at him in astonish
ment whe n I felt his pulse and found it
beating as high as 120. The examination
went no further. The man tremblingly
explained to me that he hadn't tasted food
in nearly forty-eight hears. I judged him
to be speaking the truth and gave him a
dollar with the request that he eat and
sleep and return to me on the following
morning. The man was true to his word,
and he passed the examination both here
and at the island. He was fairly educated

When a man's body has been gone over

if he has any spinal trouble it will be made

war vessel examines applicants whenever
the crew is short. Good, able-bodied sea
men are hard to get. Applications, how
ever, are as numerous as they are in the
marine service. The navy, in fact, offers
more chances for enlistment than the
army now, for the navy, as a whole, is
really short-handed. Only American sea
men are taken, and there is a particular
bar a<_ r aini-t Englishmen.
'"There is a large market here from
which men can be picked," observed Al
White, who is recognized as every sailor's
friend. "The Navy Department is en
deavoring to man its vessels exclusively
with Americans. Take the Philadelphia
and 90 per cent of her crew are Americana,
nearly all of them obtained in the last live !
months. The native American is what is
wanted in the navy, and as opportunities

tion card is made out for identification in
i case of desertion or for other causes. It is
j now a hazardous thing for a criminal to
I use the service as a temporary refuge when
pursued by officers of the law.
Now all recruiting stations are provided
with identification cards bearing the out
line of an anatomical man. The cards are
about eight inches square, and the out
lined figure of a man is printed on both
sides. One side show* a front view of the
figure, with the hands and arms straight
down at the sides, and the other shows
the rear figure. Jllank epacefl are provided
for ttie man's name, age, height, nation
ality, color of his eyes and a few minor
Questions that might assist in identifying
him.
When a man shows up to recruit the
Burgeon stm.^ him and subjects him to a
scrutiny f . > r scars, moles, tattooing and
other permanent marks on the body, lie
indicates with ink on the card the nature
of any mark?, and the card is .vent to
Washington, Where there is a card on file
for every man in the service. In fact, the
military detective bureau, under the sur
geon-general of the War Department, is a
most important concern.
When a man is honorably discharged
his card is destroyed. When a man de-
Berts or commits apy other military
offense the commander of the post at
which he is stationed forwards his name to
tlie department and his card it removed
from the alpbabeticaJ liles. The man's
name is then tost sight of entirely and his
card is classified in a criminal file by the
section in which his most prominent scar
is located. If his most prominent scar is
on the right foot his card is placed on the
right-foot file. If he has several larce
scars in different sections duplicate cards
are made out and a card is riled in the
proper file for each scar.
It is claimed for this system that it has
never yet failed, No two men have ever
besn found to have scars just alike. Some
have half a dozen permanent marks,
others as many ay six times that many.
Criminals are not captured by any particu
car class of marks, but by a combination
oi marks.
When a man deserts his name is for
warded to the bureau by the commander
of the post and his card" is tiled with the
"undesirable men," according to his most
prominent scar. If the man re-eniists he
naturally presents himself in a strange re
cruiting office under a false name. He is
enlisted and examined like all new re
cruits and his identification card is for
warded to the department. Cards of cur
rent recruits are examined by a corns of
clerks for the most prominent scar. This
scar is marked with a circle of red ink and
compared with cards on rile of the crimin
als with scars In an identical location.
If the card shows no identical scars with
the card of a criminal, it is filed alphabeti
cally; but if one scar is identical with that
of a criminal all the other fo.irs are com
pared wiili that criminal's card, and if the
two cards tally the new recruit will find
himself in a guardhouse without much
more delay than is required to transmit a
telegraph message to the commander of
the post at which the enlistment tooic
place.
In the Naval Department a similar
bureau exists. It is separate and distinct,
of course, from the Military Detective
Bureau, but the system is identical. When a
marine or sailor "deserts or is dishonorably
discharged his name is dropped from the
alphabetical list, and his identification
card, by marks, is not only filed among
the "und-sirable men" at the Naval
Bureau but also sent to the War Depart
ment Bureau. Criminal cards are likewise
transmitted from War to Naval bureau.
Thus a double comparison is made, one in
each department, and a deserter or crim
inal from the navy is thus barred from the
army, while an army deserter or criminal
will seek to enter the navy in vain.
As was remarked above) hard times may
drive a great many into the ranks; but
still forever there will be the proverbial
recruit who is >ntent on "seeking the bub
ble reputation even in the cannon's
mouth' ; or the one who, crossed in love,
thus flees the vanities of a heartless world;
and still forever will the young seeker after
adventure in the service be disappointed
in the monotonous routine of a soldier's
life in time of peace.

SHORT LESSONS IN HORSE GUIDANCE.
r>:R,i"v-i:NrGr.
"Good hands" are as essential in driving as in riding, although we do n<jt hear so much of the need for them.
You should be able to feel your horse's mouth without worrying' it. This can only be done by keeping the reins in a firm,
light, gentle hold. The fingers, rather than the hands, should do the work
s The reins should usually be held in the left hand. Take the right rein between the middle and the index fingers and pass it
beneath the index finger, holding it firmly under the ball of the thumb. Let the left rein pass between the ring and little fingers,
and carry it, too, across the ring, middle and index fingers, to be held by the thumb.
If the reins are held in both hands the right hand should be always ready to seize the whip. ' If you have a nervous horse,
liable to take sudden fright, keep the whip in hand when passing through a crowded street, or any place of danger. In such case
keep both hands on the reins. Never jerk or flap the reins.
Never strike a horse for shying. If you notice that he is eying any object with suspicion give him a gentle tap with the
whip to distract his attention, but do not punish him after he has made the jump. He will be sure to associate the blow with
the object of his terror, and the habit will become confirmed.
Never strike a balking horse. Never drive one, either. Life and time are too precious and good animals too plentiful to
make this nuisance endurable.
In meeting a turnout you should keep to the right, but in overtaking one the rule is to pass on the left. Disregard of
this rule is the cause of many accidents and much profanity.
Keep as far behind another driver as you can conveniently. If obliged to drive close in the rear of another vehicle pull

your horse to a jog and have him well in hand. Otherwise the driver in front of you, by suddenly stopping or turning to right or
left, may cause you great discomfiture. Under such circumstances I have known a horse's leg to be thrust through a wheel of the
preceding vehicle and broken. Observe this rule, particularly on hilly roads..
Never start to' back or turn without seeing what is beside or behind you. Make a point to pull up a little at crossings. Be
courteous and keep a qool head, even when foot passengers get bewildered and dodge back and forth before you. In such case you
will often save time by halting.
In crossing a car-track make as sharp a turn as space will allow, and drive across directly rather than diagonally. Pay
attention to your horse, no matter.how interested you may feel in what is going on in the street. Never pull up suddenly on a
damp pavement, or on asphalt pavement, dry or damp. â 
Keep cool. Nothing is helped by excitement. If you cannot command your nerves in an emergency you will never
become a successful driver, and should not attempt to guide a horse in a busy street. :
Keep your horse well in hand.
Keep your whip in hand.
Keep your temper in hand. â .â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢__

DEATH
TRUCKEE, Cal., Jan. IS.â A band
of pioneers, ninety men, women
and children, toiling through the
Sierra storm; exhausted, starv-

Is the present winter scene.
Every Californ . knows of the Dormers
and their company : it is an old, old story
that has one of the first places in the pio
neer traditions; but to-day it looms up in â 
striking, thrilling contrast to the happy
carnival conditions.
Death was the Carnival King in that yet
remembered winter of forty-nine years ago.
Dormer Lake is one of Nature's gems, I
held in the stern selling of this California
mountain ranee. A creation more beauti
ful could hardly he imagined. But a grave
in the water's depth of nearly 500 ieet
would have been a mercy to those pioneers j
when they first saw that lake.
Eastern homes, places of comfort and
plenty, had been abandoned by the emi
grants in search of the Western dream
land â for in the lack of knowledge at the
time, California could have been nothing
more; and that was before the allurements
of the gold discovery. The adventurous
families came from lowa, Missouri, Illi
nois, Ohio and Tennessee, the Dormers
starting from Illinois.
There were troubles enough before the
Sierra grade was reached; company dis
sensions in the train, whose wagons and
cattle covered two miles, contacts with
.Indians, deaths from exposure and fatigue,
the division of the original train when the
ninety unfortunates took the latal Truckee
way, thirst on the alkaline desert, the mur
der of a leading member of the band, the
parting of relatives when Stan ton and Me-
Cutchen heroically volunteered to set out
Sbead and seek relief at Slitter's Fort.
Then James' F. Reed killed a young man
named Snyder in self-defense, as the
local historian McGlashan shows, But
Snyder was popular and Reed had
been the object of jealousy on ac
count of his superior possessions in
the train at starting. So the sentence
passed upon Reed was the sentence of
death, and the manner of the execution
was that the man, the head of a family,
should go alone into the wintry Sierra
wilderness, without food, without" his pun
or ammunition and with 110 more clothing
than he wore.
The sentence was accepted, for there was

from fear of detection, and Virginia Reed

to the trail of the slow-going, dejected

There is no prettier record of heroism in

and that the wisdom of the child's heart
vas greater than that which had prevailed
in the emigrant council is shown by the
succeeding events.

the westward.
The winter of 1846 set in early, and at !
the close of October six inches of snow
covered the ground this side of the Nevada !
line and at the Sierra summit there was I
five feet of snow. Still struggling onward, \
nearly crazed by hardship and suffering'
bo me of the emigrants fought their way
along where to-day stands the radiant ice !
palace; others followed a pass somewhat'
to tli| northward. Dormer Lake was the I
end Ol thai winter's expedition, and the
closing place of the lives of many in the ;
company.
One evening it was derided that the only
hope of surviving was in starting over the
summit on foot, carrying some of the meat !
of the cattle and rattles for food. That â 
night the Ice King barred the. way. A !
heavy snowfall, beginning then, lasted j
lever*] days. The cattle perished in the !
drifts and some were buried out of sight; j
the mules were never been again.
The work of constructing cabins was j
resolutely begun, and here was the pitiful :
little tirst home of the settlers on the ;
Sierras, a hamlet of terror, suffering, des
titution and distraction.
Then came the starting onward of the
'forlorn Hope," when there was not food
tnough fnr allâ a sacrifice of life if neces
Â«aiy lor the sake of those who were to re
main in camp. Mrs. Foster end Mrs.
Fike (sister?) went with the party on the
tnowsnoe contrivances that their "share of
the winter provisions might help to sus
tain the lives of their aged mother and
little children. Mrs. McCutchen vol
ired in a like duty and left her infant
in the rare of one of the older women at
tin' cabins. Men gave up the comparative
safety in the camp, though the camp was
doomed, for tbey knew that their going
would beep starvation so much loneer
from tlie helpless women and children.
Mere boy- and girls left their portion of
the food lor aged t.r exhausted parents.
Patrick Dolan, a bachelor, had no rela
tive in the camp, and the cattle that he
owned would have afforded him food for
the entire winter. Hut the wife and chil
dren of the banished Reed had little to
eat, and to these did Dolan gi -c all his
means of living. .Mrs. Reed handed a
watch and a Masonic emblem to the gen
erous man at parting, asking him to give
them to her husband if the two should
meet at Slitter's Fort. The souvenirs were
delivered, but not by that messenger, for
Dolan died in the snow.
It was after six weeks at Dormer Lake
that the "Forlorn Hope" crawled on. and
at the end of the first day tlie party had
traversed only four or five miles. The
I encampment was within sight of the
is where the men had left their
families, where the mothers bad left their
infants and where the bachelor, Dolan,

had abandoned his hope of life. Such
weather conditions as then existed would
imprison the Trockee of to-day, but every
morning the '-F.irli.rn Hope" suffered a
little distance onward.
The pioneers who perished in that grand
undertaking deserve a monumi ot as en
duringas the granite crags among which
they toiled.
Stanton was the lirst to fall. He was
blinded on the third day. Earl} in the
fifth morning when the journey* was re
sumed he said, in response to a call, ' Ye-,
I am coming soon,'; Out though .-nil reso
lute he rould not go and his companions
had to leave hi in there to die. 1 his man,
of literary ability and from an old New
England family, had proven his valor by
going back with j.rovisions for his com
panions after lie had once readied the
hoped-for valley.
That day the last of the meager food
supply was used, for with the weaker <>\n->
at Dormer Lake, nearly all the supplies
had been left. One member of the party,
a man named Eddy, found an unexpected
little bit of relief for tin; expedition % ben
the food was gone. It was a half pound of
meat that had been secreted by Mrs. Eddy
in her husband's outfit, and attached to it
was a strip of j.ai.cr with the words,
"From Your Own Dear Eleanor."
Another fierce etorm came on. Tbe
members of thÂ« party were starving. A
council was held. What was there to do?
Only one thing; to become cannibals.
For two days the party was without food,
and the allowance before that had been
one ounce for each meal. The thought of
cannibalism was horridâ horrid beyond
ordinary comprehension, but to most of
those in the council life was the first duty,
for the sake of the women and children m
the cabins beyond tbe summit.
Lots were cast. And who was chosen
for death in that awfui game? Who could
have been, in the tragic irony of all that
winter fate, but the generous Patrick
Dolan?
Dolan had given all his food; now he
bad to eive his life. And Dolan was will
ing to die. Bat nobody would perform
the duty yet remaining, and in 'silent hor
ror at the situation the women and men
picked up their burdens and staggered
away.
At night, during a storm of sleet, a bi"
camphre was kindled, and the starving
people fell to \ sleep in the warmth of it.
What invention of an Inquisition could
have been more ghastly, more cruel, than
the torture that came then? The camp
unknown to the sufferers, was on a frozen
body of water, and when the huge lire had
melted the ice the blazing logs all sank
from sight.
Franklin W. Graves and a Mexican
named Antoine died that night and before
the sun had set again Patrick Dolan had
found his executioner in starvation.
This was at Christmas time and the food

that had come was in the tlesh of the three
early victims. The two Indians grimly
i refused to eat that food, but there was no
reason why they had to survive. Their
wives and children were not among those
at the lake.
The journey was resumed and when the
last of the human food gave out it was de
cided to kill the Indians, but these guides
understood the plan and they ran away in
the darkness. Without the Indians the
party had no knowledge of the trail and
here was the new terror of being lost.
The death of a boy in the arms of an
older sister, Mrs. Foster, who then saw
the body used as food, and the death of
Jay Fosdick lessened the number of the
party. A few days more and again the
fooa was gone, including the meat of a
small deer that had been killed.
The two Indians wen overtaken, ex
hausted, after they had been for nine days
without food; and at that time the sur
vivors of the emigrant band were only five
women and two men. The Indian', had
sunk down to die when the white men and
women passed them. It was a duty to
kill the dying Indians for food and Foster
went back and performed it. The Indians
did not object, and they were glad that
the end had come.
The agony of climbing one moun
tain, only to find another beyond! That
was the experience for many a day. Feet
that had been frozen must st;ll cling to
the wornout shoeshoes.
At last a little trail was found. It led to
a mountain home of Indians. Arm, oh,
the joy of it! Far to the eastward the
Indian habitations had been avoided, but
then: was no thought of danger after the
weeks of starvation in the snow. Strength
came back, and hope was reborn, and the
famishing women and men even ran to the
little rancheria. The Indiana were startled
at the apparition, but soon understanding
the situation, they j^ave. shelter and such
food as they had, and it lias been said that
the Indian women cried in sympathy.
T;,e worst of the journey "was over and
the Indians aided and carried the men and
women down the mountains for seven
days until Johnson's ranch was reached,
after sufferings that seemed light only by
comparison with those that bad previously
been endured. A relief train was hastily
organized and sent back from Sinter's
Fort when the message was brought in,
and this train was re-enforced at John
son's ranch, thirteen hardy men, with
abundant provisions, climbing into the
hardships of the trail toward Dormer Lake
and the snow-bound emigrants.
Reed, having long before that reached
Slitter's Fort, attempted, in company with
iMcCutchen, to return toward Dormer
Lake with provisions that Gutter supplied,
but the attempt was a failure and Reed
went to Yerba Bnena (now San Francisco)
to consult Commodore Hull. Another ex
pedition was then started, the San Fran
cisco citizens contributing $1300. Going
by water to the Sacramento Valley that
relief party followed General Gutter's train
into the mountains.
Daring all this time the Ice King's
prisoners near the place where the
Truckee carnival is now in progress suf
fered like the people that had toiled over
the summit; but their sufferings were
drawn out iutolmonths. When the meat
was gone children were fed on hides.
Bones became food. The last of the flour
was reserved for the infant of the camp,
the child of Mrs. Pike â one of the mem
bers of the "Forlorn Hope."
On Christmas the Reed children alone
had enough to eat, while beyond the sum
mit the man who.had left the beef to them
was dead and was being eaten. Even the
Heed family had been on a small allow
ance, and in the duty of sharing their food
with those who had none starvation soon
was near.
The shelter of the cabins and tents was
inadequate, and sometimes the beds were
covered with snow at morning. The stump
of n tree, where the men stood on the snow
to cut firewood, was in later years fouud to
be twenty-two feet hitrh. As in the strug
gle of the "Forlorn Hope," the women best
endured the haidships.
The eating of the human bodies was not
resorted to by the people in this camp.
The others had done that only to sustain
life enough to accomplish the rescue.
Mrs. Reed and Virginia were the strong
est and most resolute persons at the lake
during the latter days. At last the brave
young daughter, the girl who had stolen
away and Draved the awful wilderness to
follow on her banished father's trail with
food and the gun, broke down in starva
tion, and on the evening of the liith of
February Virginia Reed lay dying. Gath
ered at her bedside in the comfortless
cabin beneath the snow were several of the
women, for Virginia was a favorite in the
camp. She had been the life of the camp.
There were no hopes.. No words were
spoken. The next day there would be
another body in the snow, and then â
A shout!
No famished man at the lake could
shout like that. Indians? No, those
were the shouts of the white men. The
rescuers hail come!
Virginia Reed was saved to the State
that may well be proud of her; and here
it may be mentioned that, marrying at
San Jose, she became the mother of
twelve native sons and daughters.
The relief expedition sent out by Gen
eral Sutter had arrived at the lake after a
mighty battle with the ice Kin^'sforcesand
had brought the food that was life to the
prisoners.
To-day the merry-makers at the carnival
skate thoughtlessly ana happily over the
places where those pioneers suffered and
hoped and died. The creek running there
has been made into a pond, so that now a
portion of the camp site is under water;
but rising from the ice is a huge wooden
cross to mark the spot at which the
Murphy cabin stood.
Butter's relief party had brought to the
lake the food that was considered neces
sary, and the remainder was cached on the
other side of the summit. An immediate
return with those who could travel was
therefore necessary. The food supplies
were quickly exhausted, and when the
summit was crossed the party found that
wild animals had reached the food stored
away for that trip. Starvation would have
been inevitable but for the arrival of the
banished Reed with the second train, tfo
Virginia Reed did not save her father's
i lne alone when she slipped from the
j earlier camp and followed on in the snow.
There are too many pathetic features of
the long-ago winter to De all related hereâ
the experiences of tlu Dormers in their
camp at Prosser Creek, the bufferings ot
those who could not start, from Dormer
Lake when the lirst relief party arrived,
the guidance of the rescuer uy the finding
of the dead body of Stan ton, the return of
Reed for his two children who had been
left at tne lake, and the awful journey of
Reed and the rescued on that final jour
ney toward the Sacramento plain. This
last journey was no less tragic than the
dreary attempt of the "Forlorn Hope."
Some died, and all the tortures and ter
rors recorded of the others were experi
enced by those who journeyed down the
mountain witti Keed in the "second re
lief. 1 '
Travelers in this region think little
about the exDeriences of those who catne
half a century before. Little remains to
mark the site of the encampments, but
preserved in McGlasban's lower are relics
that appeal to the sentiments of those who
know tin: history. There are crumbling
bits of the cabins, portions of wagons and
fragments of household goods. There are
weapons, a broken ax and a pistol, and
many such things as these.
A piece of a mirror and the sole of a
baby's sho<> are spoken of by all who gaze
at the collection ; and when the relics have
been viewed the visitors ha-.ten back to
the pleasures of the ice and snow, and re
joice and art- happy in the conditions that
brought terror and death to the pilgrims
of forty-nine years ago.
THE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR.
Some Obvious Lessons to He Learned
â  From It.
The great siege of Gibraltar, which, com
mencing in July, 1779, lasted till March,
1783, holds for us one or two obvious
lessons.
The extraordinary efforts to reduce the
place and the large force brought against
it (there were over 30,000 French and
Spanish troops before it in September,
1782, besides a large combined Meet and
several hundred cannon) stand out in re
markable contrast with the small garri
son, which at no time much exceeded
7000 men. We ask ourselves whether this
stubborn, lengthy and successful defense
was d ue entirely to the natural and artificial
strength of the place, and we are at once
convinced that such is not the case. Gib
raltar is strong, indeed, but she cliould
not have ood out for three and a half
years had England not been mistress of
the seas, capable of pouring provisions
munitions and re-enforcements into the
fortress. Few. events are more striking
than the relief of the place by Howe in
October. ' 1782, when the convoy in his
charge drove past the place into the Medi
terranean, and was followed by the
enemy's fleet from the bay, which thus
placed itself between the rock and the re
lieving fleet, but nevertheless completely
failed to prevent the relief.
"On the 19th,". says Mahan, "the Eng
lish fleet repassed the straits with an east
erly wind, haying: within a week's' time
fulfilled its mission and made Gibraltar
safe for another year."
Thus the power which would preserve its
naval bases outside its home shoresâhow
ever individually strong these bases may
beâ must command the sea.
The Spaniards and French undoubtedly
made a mistake when they spent so much
time and money, so many efforts and
men, upon the reduction of Gibraltar.
They would have been more likely to ac
complish their purpose, as Mahan points
out, had they sought to capture Gibraltar
on the shores of Englandâ had they
watched our home ports and prevented the
outgoing of our Meets. As it was, Gibral
tar, although a burden to us In the great
struggle, played a very important part in
absorbing so much energy and such num
bers of the enemy for so considerable a
time. â The Nineteenth Century.
SQUEEZING FRUIT MEN
Peculiar Business Methods of
Chicago Commission
Merchants.
HOW EENTS AFFECT RETURNS.
Rejection of Consignments En Route
Upon a Falling Market Is a
Common Trick.
From a recent Chicago dispatch it is
lamed that the California; fruit grower
and shipper, owing to their system of con
signments, are paying the rent of the
South "Water-street commission man of
that city to an extent that is as unwar
rantable us it is startling.
Quoting one of the most prominent com
mission merchants in the street the dis
patch says :
It is a fact too well known to be denied, many
commission houses do not give exact returns
to shippers. The last two years have been es
pecially trying to the street's honesty. While
the commissions asked atpresentare lower than
ever before, business is dull; competition for
trade never before was so so sharp, and rents
are being exacted moro rigorously than at any
previous time.
Instead of a reduction commensurate with
the scale of business, landlords in South Water
street are continually putting on the jack
screws.
The complaint against the rents has become
so serious that, a mass-meeting of Soutn Water
street commission merchants is culled for next
Saturday afternoon at the Produce Bxcbange.
A secret meeting was held there yesterday
afternoon and representatives of nearly every
prominent liou-^u in the street were present.
A committee ot twelve was appointed to devise
plans for either moving or securing a reduc
tion of rents. The names of the committee
men were kept seecet.
This is truly an honest confession that
ought to he good for the souls of these
apparently but not really dishonest com
! mission men. Because the rents are
| high in South Water street, Chicago, to
quote literally the words of another penitent
in the same dispatch, "the market does
net trive the grower t lie best of the deal."
The "jackscrews" which the landlords
put on tne merchant in the East squeezes,
by these peculiar business methods, the
grower in the West.
For some time the fruit men of this State
have been complaining bitterly of unsatis
factory Chicago returns, especially from
orange consignments. An unreasonable
number of cars have been reported in bad
condition ; false reports of selling prices
j are made, and the owner is called upon for
I expenses sometimes exceeding the value
iof the consignments. To these cum plaints
the commission man answers that ail this
"is due entirely to high rents exacted by
South Water-street property-owners."
"As well might the Chicago man use
the excuse that the price of ink has ad
vanced, or that he has been obliged to
raise the salary of his typewriter,'' said a
prominent Fruit Exchange man yesterday.
"When it becomes apparent that a cer
i tain number of re:d estate owners shall
| dictate to the South Water street commis
; sion man the expenses at which the latter
; shall make his returns to the producer,
; Has nut the time arrived v.iun the Califor
nia grower and shipper should unite, call
! a halt, and have a little something to say
1 as to the term 8 on which his goods shall be
i marketed ? How long is the producer to shut
liis < yes to the fact that be is '3tanding in
j the door,' and that through his own instru
mentality he is mating the South Water
( street commission man rich, while he is
j not only raying the,r rent, but is often
called on for expenses, sometimes exceed
' ing the value of the consignment, while he
; himself i s often glad if be can get enough
: out of his last year's crop to insure the
: cultivation of the next year's crop in the
vain hope of better times â which will never
I arrive until there is a radical change in his
: manner of doing business.
"There must certainly be a remedy for
this state of affairs, and the very first step
j t<> be taken in this direction "is for the
â  grower to meet the shipper and endeavor
to combine for each other's interest, for
the grower needs the shipper, who is ;i
1 man of commercial experience, which can
-1 not always be said of the grower; just as
i much as the shipper needs the practical
grower, which cannot he claimed for all
| the shippers. Let them clasp hands and
trust each other in California. Let every
one stop, and stop at once, the pernicious
system of promiscuous consignments, and
the California producer and shipper will
I be able to show a reasonable balance on
I the right side of his ledger. It is no longer
i a question of how long the California
j grower i.- going to submit to the extortion
jof the South Water street commission
â  man; it is a self-evident fact that unless
he takes the means at hand and combines
j with the shipper at once, and centers all
â  the fruit interest in a direction to tne end
that Californiaus shall benefit to a reason
able extent with the Eastern buyer, his
orchards will be plastered to such an ex-
I tent that foreclosure and ruin will follow."
"The California fruit man indeed gets
the worst of the deal.'' said Secretary T.
B. Taylor of the San Francisco Fruit Ex
change yesterday. "Often a big consign
ment will be sent East, contracted for by
sample, and before the curloads have got
beyond the Missouri River they will be re
jected by the Chicago man. Not even an
excuse will be made; the goods will sim
ply be rejected. That is a Chicago way of
handling consignments when the market
has dropped a little or the rent has been
raised.
"What can the shipper do? His fruit is
rolling on to its destination, and when it
gets there it is 8000 miles away from him.
So the South Water street man sells it and
suits himself about the returns.
"The San Francisco Fruit Exchange was
organized two years ago to protect all the
fruit men of this State against just such
extortion, and to establish an understand
ing between buyer and seller that will pro
tect both. Look at the Alaska backing
Association and its business method.
The salmon is purchased here and the
buyer abides by ib" terms of the contract,
and there are- no rejected carloads of lish
when the consignment readies its destina
tion.
"The Fruit Exchange proposes to have
sales made 'Â¥. O. B. common shipping
point,' "free on board,' and not cash on
arrival after inspection at destination,
whereby goods may be rejected on a fall
ing market. Inspectors will be provided
at the principal shipping points under
bonds and authorized to inspect and
certify as to condition and grade of the
consignment. Bills of lading will be for
warded with inspector's certiticate at
tached, and it will soon dawn upon the
consignees that payment will be expected
upon receipt of these documents. The
arbitration committee of the exchange
will take care of all disputed questions
regarding quality of fruits shipped, and
there will oe no more haphazard way of
doing the commission business between
California and the Eastern market. Then
the fruii-grower on the Pacific Coast will
not be in the hands of the rapacious land
lords of South Water street, Chicago."
Kenan's lSiblicul Library.
According to a Paris letter a catalogue
of the library of the late Ernest Renan has
now been published. The tirst part com
prises the Biblical or Oriental books, which
were carefully sorted by the exegesist him
self. The other division comprises work*
on general history and philology, the
classics and books relating to the "Middle
Ages, the Renaissance and modern times.
The Biblical collection contains :K>oo vol
umes. According to the express instruc
tions of the deceased writer the library is
to be sold en bloc, or in two divisions
marked in the catalogueâ that is to say,
the valuable Oriental part can be bought
alone. Jt is probable that an endeavor
will be made to keep at least the Biblical
collection in this country, and that it will
be purchased by the state.

SOCIETY
p^sy^HE feeling that we mnst harry up !
our entertainments before Lent is
rather a fictitious one, for the
season of "sackcloth and ashes" is
no longer a quietus on our gay
eties. It is true that we renounce for
a while our cotillons, but, literally, we
give up nothing else, and we are apt to add
card parties and clubs of various kind?,
for which we have no time in the earlier
part of the winter. Luncheons and din
ners are j ust as numerous and just as elabo
rate in Lent as at any other time, yet
there is so much in habit that we catch
ourselves saying constantly, "After Ash
Wednesday we will have a rest," and we
think we will be enabled to accomplish lots
of other duties which occasionally trouble
our sensitive consciences. But before
Ash Wednesday there will be a goodly
number of dances. There are to be at least
two more by the Monday Evening Dancing
Class, by the Friday Fortnightly two, and
the last concluding stroke will be the \
Mardi Gras ball given by and for the Art
Association in their magnificent building
corner of California and Mason. This will
be the first time in a number of years that !
this popular end most worthy institution
has given anything of thi9 kind. That it
will be the success of the season there is ]
not the least shadow of a doubt. Mr. i
Fhelan interviewed the most prominent !
ladies at the leap-year cotillon and they i
a-<':red him of their earnest support.
Already the committees have been chosen
and all the older girls as well as the debu
tante? have signified their intention of at
tendinc.
Quite a large number went up to Mare
Island to attend the hop given recently by
the captain and officers of the United
States steamer Adams in the sail loft. It
was a farewell affair, as the ship has been
ordered to Honolulu and will sail in a short
time.
The sail loft, which is the room u?ed as
a ballroom at the navy-yard, was prettily
decorated with flags of the various nation
alities. The band was stationed opposite
the entrance in an alcove of flags, behind
a sort of festoon of plants, which were
kindly lent by some of the officers' wives
living at the island.
The dance commenced at 9 o'clock and
wound up at 1, and all eeemed to have a
most enjoyable time.
Captain Watson, the commander of the
Adams, received the guests with Mrs.
Hams and Mrs. Greene, wives of two of
the officers of the ship. There were a
number of people present from San Fran
cisco and Oakland, among them Miss
Emma Butler and the Misses Mary and
Louisa Harrington, and quite a number
from the navy-yard and elsewhere.
There is to be another "hop" at the
Presidio on Tuesday next and quite a
number will attend from the City.
The leap-year dance to be given by
Colonel and Mrs. Burton and the Misses
Burton promises to be a very jolly affair.
The date settled upon fa January 29 at the
hoproom of the Presidio. Ladies will
appear in domino and masks.
The Deux-Temps Club of Oakland is dis
cussing the advisability of closing its
eeason with a large cotillon accompanied
with an elaborate Bupper and favors of
weight and interest. It has not yet been
decided whether the affair shall be a bal
poudre or the usual cotillon. Many would
like a real Mardi-Gras ball; others prefer a
valentine leap-year party, while several of
the patronesses think it would be a novel
idea to give the last dance on Washington's
birthday with colonial costumes.

Pritchard-Campion.
The nuptials of Miss Rose A. Pritchard end
E. J. Campion were celebrated on Tuesday
morning at St. Agnes Church, Rev. Father
Kirby officiating. In accordance with tho
wishes of the newly married couple the wed
ding was a very quiet affair, only the relatives
and immediate friends of the family being
present in the church.
Miss Frances McDevitt was bridesmaid and
M. J. Maloney of Chicago filled very grace
fully the position of best man. Immediately
after the ceremony a very elaborate wedding
breakfast was served at the residence of the
bride. 1621 Grove street.
There were numerous lovely wedding gifts,
which gave ample evidence of the high regard'
with which the young couple are held.
In the afternoon the newly married couple
left for Southern California, where the honey
moon will be spent, taking with them the best
wishes and congratulations from their many
friend.-.
The bride s a very estimable and highly ac
complished young. lady, well and favorably
Known iv society circles in the Western Addi
tion. Mr. Campion has been connected for
many years with a well-known publishing
Jiouse in New York, and at the preeeut time
! holds the very responsible position of general
, manager on this coast for the firm.
DINNERS AND RECEPTIONS.
Numerous Gatherings and an Agreeable Inter- j
change of Hospitality.
James D. Phelan entertained a number of
friends at dinner on Wednesday evening last â 
in the red room of the Bohemian Club, in |
honor of Mrs. Harold Sewall (ne9 Ashe.) Dur- i
| ing the course of the dinner the Hungarian j
| Orchestra rendered several selections, and sub- !
j sequently Frank Coffin's quartet favored with
a lew songs. Mr. Phelan's guests were Dr. j
and Mrs. Beverly McMonagle, Baron and !
\ Baroness yon Schroeder, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph
i B. Crockett, Mr. and Mrs. Frank .J. Sullivan.
j Mr. and Mrs. J. Downey Harvey, Mrs. Henry
j McLean Martin,- Miss Ashe,- Oscar T. Sewall,
i Colin M. Smith and the guest of honor, Mrs.
' Harold Sewall.
One of the most unique affairs of its kind
was the luncheon given last Wednesday by i
I Miss Lottie Woods at her home, corner of Oc- I
tavia and California streets, in honor of her
I cousin, Miss Mattie Whittier, who has just re
! turned to the City from, an extended trip
j abroad. This affair might be termed a feast of
i nations, and evidenced a wonderful amount of
j labor and executive ability on the part of the
! young hostess, for some of the dishes are al-
I most unknown quantities here, and it was only
j with great perseverance that they were finally
| obtained and prepared.'
There were no less than fifteen courses, each
j one being the national dish of one of the na
tions as represented by the fifteen tables, the
service and decorations of each being peculiar j
; to that country. The first course was Ameri- j
j can, and then followed others runningthrough i
i French, German, Italian, etc., and even Egypt '
, was represented by some delicacy.
The hostess with her guest of honor sat at j
T the American table, which had for its floral |
decoration violets, Miss Whittler's favorite
flower. The Holland table was attractive with
its service of quaint Delft, and among the
flowers was the first tulip of the season. The
center piece was a square of beautifully em
broidered fabric from that historic land, and
so on through the balance of tables, each one
exhibiting some relic or work of art manufac
tured in the land represented. Preceding each
course a national flag was placed in a cut-glass
stand In the center of each table, the band
playing the national air of that country, so
that at the end of the luncheon a bouquet of j
flags representing fifteen nations ornamented j
each table. The. souvenirs consisted of small
silk American flags, to the sticks of which
were attached the name cards. The rooms
were handsomely and appropriately decorated .
with flags and banners of the different nations, [
prominent among them being "Old Glory," j
gracefully entwined among masses of Holly '
and evergreens.
The following ladies who enjoyed this novel
and eminently successful affair, besides the
hostess, her mother, Mrs. Frank N. Woods, and
Miss Whittier, were Miss Eleanor Wood, Mrs.
Mr*. Louis F.Monteagle, Mi's

LEAP TEAR FETES.
They Are Likely to Prove a Feature Among
the Winter Entertainments.
Leap-year entertainments will be a feature
here this winter, more especially among the
younger set, as, after all, this mode of enter
taining only appeals vividly to the debutante.
Older women very much prefer to be served
than to serve, and even the rare privileges that
this year gives are not, as a rule, available in
our present state of society. But to the young I
maiden what is more delightful than to feel I
that for once things are in her hands, that she
does the asking for cotillon and supper, that
she. can walk unprotected and unescorted
through the breadth and the length of the
wide hall and can realize all the glories and
Independence of mankind in these scenes of
revelry. â 
The first ball of this kind this season was
given in Oakland last Wednesday evening.
There the leap-year features were carried out to |
perfection, and the young men behaved with a
modesty and discretion worthy of all imitation.
The Cotillon, or, more correctly speaking, the
Friday Night Club, is always* the signal for
much entertaining, both before the cotillon
and afterward. Quite a number of dinners i
were given last evening, among others those of
Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Knight, at their home, on
Van Ness avenue. Their guests were princi
pally composed of the wedding party and were
Miss Ella Goodall, Miss Bessie Shreve, Miss
Mamie Houghton, Miss Ella Morgan, E. 11.
Sheldon, Harry M. Holbrook, E. M. Greenway
and F. L. Owen. â¢
Among others who gave dinners were Mr.
and Mrs. Henry T. Scott, at their residence, cor
ner of Clay and Laguna streets.
The San Francisco calling list for 1896 is at
hand and shows evidence of the same careful
compilation and observance of detail that dis- '
tinguished this book when it was got out
several years ago. The book was got up by
Crocker <& Co. â 
The Bachelors and Benedicts of Oakland
gave their second cotillon of â¢ the season in
Militia Hall last Wednesday evening. About
seventy-five couples were present, who par
ticipated In the cotillon, which was a leap
year one and led by Miss Amy McKee. After
supper, which was served at midnight, in
formal dancing was enjoyed for an hour or so.
PRIVATE GATHERINGS.
Several Home and Friendly Entertainments
Promoting and Maintaining Sociability.
The Cosmos Cotillon Club gave a surprise
party to Miss May Smith at her borne at 423
Scott street last Monday evening. .''â  Â-..-;'?
There were songs and comic recitations and
music by George Kennedy and Miss Alice
Atkins.' .
The remainder of the evening was spent in
dancing and many jolly games. At midnight
the -guests retired to the beautifully decorated
dining-hall, where a bountiful repast was
served, after which the- never-tiring light fan
tastic was again tripped until dawning of
morn, when all left for their homes with happy
hearts and pleasant recollections of the 15t& !
of January. â 
Among those present were: Mr. and- Mrs.
Smith, Miss May Smith, Miss Alice Atkins,
Miss Jennie Fisher, Miss Edith White. Miss
Daisy Clark, Miss Alice Woods, Miss Lottie

FOR STREET-SPRINKLING
The Merchants' Association Pe
titions the Board of
Supervisors.
Belief That the Business Districts
Should Be Watered Regularly.
Aid Offered.
Anticipating the close of the rainy sea
son and the necessity for keeping the
City's thoroughfares watered, the Mer
chants' Association sent in a communica
tion to the Board of Supervisors yesterday
requesting that body to order the sprink
ling of the streets as soon as it becomes
necessary.
The communication calls attention to
the fact that the Supervisors appropriated
$75,000 for street-cleaning purposes daring
the last six months and that but $57,580 1!Â»
was used, leaving a balance of $17,419 81
to the creait of the fund. The association
claims that these figures show tnat there
are ample means available for street
sprinkling purposes. The communication
states that it is desirable that the whole
business portion cf the City should be sys
tematically sprinkled, and suggests that if
the Supervisors desire to have the associa
tion's system practically tried before
making a contract they should author
ize the association to engage, at the
City's expense as many sprink
ling-carts and drivers as may be
required to carry out the specifications
under the following conditions: That the
compensation for each cart and driver
shall not exceed $5 a day; that the total
expenditure shall not exceed $100 a day ;
that the experiment be made on days when
sprinkling is necessary and be continued
for thirty consecutive working days.
The association expresses its willingness
to furnish a superintendent and foreman
for the experiment without charge and
agrees that if after the contract is granted
the amount appropriated proves insuffi
cient it will raise the necessary funds to
make up the deficiency.
The communication closes with the
statement that if the funds for street
sprinkling are diverted to any otner pur
pose the association will not again step
into the breach and raise the necessary
money.
"Calnwnies Against CatliolicÃ."
A free lecture will be delivered under the
auspices of the Young Men's Catholic Union
in Metropolitan Temple on Tuesday evening,
January 21, by Rev. Terence Caraher of Mis
sion Ban Jose on "Calumnies Against Cath
olics."
THE PHILOSOPHY OF
A S ON OF THE SEA
He stood leaning against the capstan of
a deep-water ship and with the air of a
philosopher and iv a voice that bespoke a
deal of conscience at the back of hi? words
reeled off to a coup; â â¢ of interested listen
ers this characteristic story interlarded
with his nonest views:
"An old salt like me, as was brought up,
you might say, on the ocean, mayn't 've
got the same advantages as has fallen to
folkd as stayed with the shore â mayn't
'ye got the drilling in schools 'nd books
'nd churches â but old Jack has saved up
in his mind a few things which some a 9
knows more has rubbed off the slate 'nd
done with.
"I likes me grog and I likes me smoke
and I likes me joke â no harm I cakes it,
but I believes as what the Bible says is
right â I believes in a God as runs the
whole ship and the ocean. It's true â and
THE SEA PHILOSOPHER-
I'm sorry for 't â l don't know much, but I
believes there's lots more good among us
than we figures on.
"Things isn't so bad as half the creachers
preach about. It don't look right to see
'em pulling off the course to find some
thing black to paint when it's a long sight
easier to steer ahead and show up a little
of the white.
"Now, 1 hears some as says the rich is
a-sneering at the poor, and as the poor
won't stand it for long, but'll rise up, and
then'll come war and a cleau-up. I bas to
laugh at these long-faced yarns. Jack's
poor, but he never kicked for envy's sake
at a man as had more money or better
top:?, or as was over and above him in the
service. â â- <c- Â»Â» â â Â»
"Now, as 1 takes it, some men was cut out
for soldiers and some for sailors; some
men was born to be lawyers, some to be
reporters, some to be presidents, one tnin<j
or another; come was born smart and j
some slow, and I says to myself, "Jack, j
you was cut out for a seaman â just a com- I
mon seaman." And here's what I believes: j
If I does me duty as common seaman and
just keeps white, why, I'm as good afore
Bod as any as lives.
"The rich has always treated me w^ll.
No oilicer in|the navy as evpr I knew treated
me anyways but well. You never knew
Commodore Downes,mavbe? Old Jacic did. j
Why, I shipped in Bo3ton with Commo- â¢
dore Downes in '51. The old commodore j
treated his boys white, and hold ! I want
to tell you a thing as comes to me, seeing
as I've spoken of rich and poor and Com- j
modore Downes.
"It's throe years agone, and 1 was back in
Boston â taicin' shore-leave, you might call j

it. When old Jackeys gets ashore they
meets old friends and drinks their health,
which there's no harm in doing, and some
times they gets a load aboard as causes the
craft to roll. Well, I gets a load on and
gets as topheavy as a loon. My steering
gear wouldn't work, and still I knew in
my old head as I ought to get to Quincy
afore night. Quincy's the sailors' home,
you see, and I hangs out there when off
duty back in Boston. Well, I was three
sheets in the wind when I starts out to
find Quincy, and I'd be hunting for Quincy
yet, maybe, if it wasn't for a son of that
same old Commodore Downes.
"Why, he was dressed up fine â a gentle
man â was Lieutenant Downes. He sees
me, and he brings alongside and says:
" 'Where away, Jackey?'
" 'ToQuincy.'say I.
" 'You'll be in the bay soon if yon don't
reve-se your engines,' s;.ys he; "and then
he takes me arm â fine-dressed gentleman,
too, he was. Lieutenant Downes takes me
arm and fetches me to a car, puts me on
and pays me fare and says to the con
ductor: "Put the old lad off at Quincy."
And that's one thing I'll alwa3 T s remem
ber. My own flesh and blood wouldn't 'ye
done me no more kindness than tbat same
Lieutenant Downes â rich and fine gentle
man and oflicer as he was.
"I went through one war for this Nation
and I'd show up again if the call come,
old as I be. It's a proud thing to say, but
no nation treats her boys as white as ours.
I'm getting old, but I gets me $12 a month
as regular as thft days come round, and
sometimes I has me little time â no harm
in that.
"It won't be long before I hear the call
of the Caotain that's over us all, and then
I'll go without any hard feelings agin' rich
or poor or hisrh or low. The navy boys
never lacKs for a home as long as they
keeps naif white, and I thanks God, in
words as me mother learned me afore I

BLODES ON HIS DEFENSE.
The Young Pool-Seller Claims He Was
Only a Commission Broker.
Gilbert Blodes, proprietor of the pool
rooms frequented by women, testified in
his own behalf before Judge Joachimsen
yesterday. He and his brother and clerk
all testified that on the day mentioned in
the complaint all the money taken by
them was turned over to Hallinan's and
other poolrooms, leas a commission, which
went to prove that Blodes & Co. were only
commission brokers.
Attorney Lennon made a long argument
for the dismissal of the case, quoting
numerous authorities and laying partic
ular stress upon a recent decision of Judge
Low that he would not convict in a case
where the police were accomplices. The
case was continued until to-morrow, when
the Judge will give his decision.
DIE FASTER THAN WOMEN.
Startling Health Office Figures
on the Male Death
Rate.
BIRTHS DO NOT MAZE IT UP.
In the Year Ending June 30, 1893, 1335
More Males Than Females
Passed Away.
If the figures of the local Health Officer
are accurate and are a forecast of the
future, when the new woman comes into
the estate for which she is battling her
| victory over man will be a barren oneâ for
| man will be dead.
The erstwhile tyrant will be extinct.
In most communities the women out
number the men, and San Francisco is no
exception to the rule, but few places on
j the globe can show such avast discrepancy
j between the number of men who pass
i away, compared to the mortality among
the females.
The number of male children who are
born outnumber the females to a
slight extent, but the difference falls far
short of nuking up the difference in the
death rate.
The books of the Health Department,
which are so carefully kept as to be abso
lutely correct for all practical purposes,
show that for the last six months of the
| fiscal year that closed June 30, 1885, the
number of male children born in San
Francisco was 11G0. against 1019 females, a
difference in favor of the males of 141.
For the fiscal year the number of males
whose deaths were recorded exceeded those
of the females by 1335, the mortality being
3697 for the male's am? 2362 for the females.
The same startling difference in the
death rate appears in the reports of tie
months following June, 1395, as the ap
pended table will show:
1895 3Jnles. Females. Difference.
July 327 212 115

November. '-'98 108 100
December 324 190 134
Total 1786 1141 645
Thus the number of males who died
! during the last six months of 1395 ex
\ ceeded the females 645. During the same
! period the number of males born was 1160
j and the number of females 1019, showing a
difference in favor of the males of 141 to
offset the difference in the death rate
of 645.
The record by months is as follows:
1895. Males. Females. Difference
July 155 117 88
August 197 151 46
September 217 196 21
October 221 214 7
November 19.1 160 33
December. 177 181 4
Totals 1160 1019 Til
An examination into the causes of death
â¢ fails to show any adequate reason for this
; startling discrepancy. Zymotic diseases
, during August, 1895, carried off 24 males
and 17 females; constitutional diseases, 60
: males and 37 females; local diseases, 130
males and 90 females; developmental dis
eases, 16 males and 23 females; violent
â  'â¢ deaths, 27 males and 12 females; unascer
tained causes, 2 males and no females.
Practically the same ratio appears in the
month following and the inference is that
the males are decreasing so much more
; rapidly than the females that in the course
of time, unless some marked change taKes
! place, tne females will have San Francisco
! entirely to themselves. Opinions differ as
i to the causes of the differences in the
i death rate.
One prominent physician who would not
1 consent to the use of his name gave it as
| his opinion that the habits of the men were
j responsible for their being carried away by
I disease.
"Just stop a moment and think over the

\ you will find that ten men to one woman
â yes twenty to one â are addicted to tha
use of liquor, fifty to one use tobacco and
100 to one stay out nights and engage in
: forms of dissipation that are sure to un
dermine the health.
"Then, again women are much more
i cleanly than man, they take more care of
their persons, and this is calculated to
'] make them healthy. Still, the figures
seem rather startling and give food for

there for nearly two years it has at last i
touched the English fancy, and is the sen- i
fation of the day. It is to be played in
France, and in time the Russians and Ger
mans will have their Trilbies.
It is interesting to note and contemplate I
the different individualities that poor
Trilby has been trraced withal by the
several actres-es who have i>layed the role.
At present England boasts of only one
Trilby. Miss Virginia Harned was the
hrst to present "Trilby in America. Paul
I'otter's dramatization was produced by
A. M. Palmer in Boston at the Boston
I heater ia. ; April. It met with instan
taneous success. Miss Harned gave to the
character more of the abandon and
coquetry of a woman of the world than
the simple, o:>en-hearted frankness of Dv
Manner's unique heroine. Though Miss
Harned was tender and lovable in the I
emotional scenes she lacked the at- j
here which thould surround the ideal
Trilby.
Misa Mabel Amber, who has made such
an excellent impression in her portrayal
of the character, is charming in "her lack
of affectation. .She (rives us a robust, j
healthy pirl, true-hearted, unselfish and |

seded Miss Harned in the New York cast
of "Trilby," has met with public favor in
her interpretation; and yet Miss Walsh
tacks in a marked degree the sweet and
honest naturalness one instinctively longs
for and expects in the jolly, childish young
woman of the Quartier Latin. Blanche
Walsh is known throughout the United
States as a capable actress, intelligent,
painstaking and a loyal, true American.
She is one to be proud of; yet, with all
honesty, we must admit that she lacks the
undercurrent of heart-music which must
be heard in the soul ere success unchal
lenged comes to stay. Affectation and un
natural intonations soon form a debris of
contradictions through which even genius
cannot struggle.
Miss Edith Crane, who has come into
notice but recently, ha 3 been winning
praise and compliment in her assumption
of the role of Trilby in A. M. Palmer's
Western Company.
In the "Merry World" Miss Amelia
Summerviile presents the prettiest stage
picture of Trilby yet seen. Thou h she is
supposed to burlesque the part, her en-
Irance in the military coat and shambling
slippers is electrical, for at once one sees
the living picture of Dv Maurier's dainty
sketch, ''Wistful and Sweet."
The English Trilby, Miss Dorthea
Baird, who is playing the part in Mr.
Tree's company at the Hay market Theater,
London, is* undoubtedly the breathing
realization of Dv Maurier's brain-child.
It is said that he gasped with wonder and
amazement when lirst he beheld the living,

Miss Baird is tall and well formed. Her
English is pure, untainted with the con
glomeration of long-drawn, drawling
vowels, which is too often affected by the
imported Anglomaniacs who are totally
ignorant of the perfect mother tongue.
English, pure and simple, is musical
and pleasant to the ear, but when it
becomes jumbled with the lingo of a back
woods Vermonter, and the twang of a
Missourian, sprinkled with a trifle of the
New York vernacular, it becomes as harsh
and discordant as the din and crash of a

TELLS ONE ON HIMSELF.
A Xew Missouri Congressman Who Did
Xot Know Grover "Was I^oadecl.
Congressman Hubbard of Missouri tells
a good story on himself. A few days ago
he conceived the idea of calling on Presi
dent Cleveland at the White House in a
social capacity. He began to feel a trifle
nervous ovsr it as the hour drew nigh,
and in order to have no untoward happen
ing he rehearsed a prettji little speech of
which he would deliver himself when he
stood face to face with the President. The
speech ran like this:
"Mr. President, my name is Hubbard.
lam a Congressman from Missouri. You
will probably remember me when I tell
yon tnat I beat Silver Dick Bland."
Habbard committed his little speech
until he was perfect in it and could rattle
it. off in his sleep, and then started for the
White House, ever and anon, as he went
along, turning the lines over in his mind
to make cock sure of saying them just
right when the occasion should arrive.
He reached the White House, where his
name was taken to the President, and he
was ushered In to be received. Before
Hubbard could say a word the President
reached out his hand and said:
"Ah, you aro Mr. Hubbard of Missouri,
and you beat Bland."
The President had taken the speech out
of Hubbard's mouth, and the Missourian
had neglected to commit another. He felt
terribly confused and for several seconds
was at a loss what to say. But he finally
recovered his balance, and, remembering
that the President was fond of shooting
and fishing, he began to tell him what
treat hunting ihey have in Missouri. The
Pre-ident said he* was giad to hail a fel
low sportsman in him, and by this time
Hubbard's nerve was up to the required
notch for him to venture his congratula
tions upon the stand he had taken on the
Venezuelan question. By the time he left
the White House he felt confident of his
ability to unreel a tariff speech in the
House. â Washington Post.

A WONDERFUL MYSTERY WHICH
ONLY THE DIG CAN SOLVE
BY W. O. MORROW.
A few days ago G. W. Hoffman, the
electrician of the San Jose Electric Im
provement Company, went to the com
pany's power-house, passed through the
dynamo-room, in which the oiler, George
Johnson, was at work, and entered a small
room adjoining, containing the switch
board. He had been there but a few sec
onds when Johnson, heariag him groan,
hurried in and found him sitting on the
floor, evidently in pain. Hoffman looked
up, made a futile attempt to rise and
said: "George, I'm done for." Five min
utes afterward he was dead, having by
some accident received a fatal shock of
electricity.
The most peculiar circumstance in the
case is the man's knowledge that he was
killed. As the current bad entered his j
hand and passed out through his foot his j
brain had not been paralyzed; hence he
not only recognized the oiier, but was
conscious of being fataliv hurt. Tne enor- !
mous force of 2500 volts had passed j
through his vitals. That he lived any j
length of time at all is almost as wonder- j
ful as the clearness both of his external
and internal perception, for the frightful
violence which the current must have |
done to all the vital part of him below the |
head would seem sulh'cient to have dis- i
organized all his faculties. Had he not |
been fatally hurt it is likely that he would
have been unconscious, or at least in too
great pain to speak or to recognize his
surroundings.
His conduct was evidence that nature
had performed again one of its incredible
miracles â it had whispered to him and
made him understand within a sr>ace of a
few seconds a secret that no uninjured
man can hear, and that was the secret of
death. "Within recent years medical jour
nals have published able studies of the
proposition that death is generally wel
come and pleasant. Were it not so, then
life would be monstrous. But the great
mystery of a dying man's knowledge that
he is dying â that for Ihe first time in his
existence he has come to an understand
ing of deathâ is the more wonderful thing.
It is easy for all of us to speak of death.
We all know that at some time we must
die, and some of us announce that we are
dying when we are not, but there are few
of us who can realize that we can form no I
conception whatever of death except the j
trivial and wholly inadequate one based i
on its external manifestation. The sub- j
ject is so mysterious as to be alluring; but i
as I, being one not dying, can form no
idea of that condition I am able only to j
give the subject such a surface analysis as ';
may prove interesting if not instructive.
A dying man's cheerful acceptance of
death is the result of what pathologies
term the natural preparation for that
event. That is to say, if death be not in
stantaneous while the health is pood or
does not impair the perceptive faculties the
rational part of one is made aware of the
presence of death when it is at hand. It
is a marvelous adjustment of things that a
knowledge of this presence usually brings
no terror, but rather content. When there
appears to be fear it may be generally
ascribed to an automatic persistence of
tne instinct to live.
There is no better way to express the
matter than in the words of a thouehtful
physician, who once said this to me: "In
my opinion, that which makes ns avoid
dangers that might cause our death haaits
origin in a dread of pain and not in a fear
of death, for we can have no conception
of the condition of death in our own cases,
nor of the experience of dying. You will
observe among the lower animals that the
death of one of their kind gives them no
concern whatever, and yet they will en
deavor to avoid that which produced the
death of thtir comrade if they know that
it will cause pain. You make take two
dogs and give one of them poisoned meat
in the presence of the other." The one not
poisoned will see his companion die in
agony, and still will readily take other
poisoned meat. That is simply because he
cannot understand the action oi poisons.
The same dog would run as readily from
a small whip that would only sting him
as from a club that would kill him. He
runs because he wishes to avoid pain. He
did not run from the poison because he
did not know that it would produce pain.
"The conduct of human beings is in
fluenced by identically the same considera
tion, except that their higher intelligence
informs them that some things which do
not cause pain may produce death.
Among these are narcotic poisons. But in
thus avoiding death they are merely avoid
ing what they know only to be a condition
repugnant to the instinct of life. It is
only the man's wider knowledge that
makes him avoid dancers which a dog
would not comprehend; neither knows
death, and the instinct to live does not
carry with it the knowledge of death. Yet
the dog's instinct is safer than the man's
wisdom, for men acquire habits and per
sist in indulgences which they know will
kill them.
"There can be no such thing, in my
opinion, as fear of death. When a aog
knows that he is going to die he seeks a
retired place and dies in peace. 'We tro
through life with the utmost indifference
of the end, yet we know that we must all
die. The matter of preparing for a pos
sible life beyond th's is not a factor in the
case. That means life, not death. That
is to say, we can imagine a liie even be
yond this, but we cannot imagine death."
That ail sounds rational.
The condition of death and the act of
dying are separate matters. Even the
dying, though they may know they are
dying, give evidence of that fact only, so
far as we can be certain. The visions
which many of them see may be attributed
to a disorganizing mentality. Some of
them do know, however, that they are
dying, and as dying is an entrance upon
the condition of death it might be rash for
us to say that they cannot see the condi
tion behind the act. But that is mere
guessing; the subject is beyond the com
prehension of any except the one who is
dying.
"Returning to the subject of a natural
preparation for death, it may be seen ope
rating in a marvelous diversity of ways.
It is not dillicult to imagine how a fatal
disease of 'he body, progressing through a
considerable time, will gradually bring the
mind to accept the inevitable and so break
down the iustinct to live (for it would be
reasonable to suppose that this instinct
would die with the necessity for its per
sistenco), and m such a case it is not diffi
cult to imagine that the preparation would
end in a cheerful acceptance of death. It
is wonderful, however, to reflect that this
preparation of the mind through a fatal
bodily injury may consume but the small
est fraction of time, as it did in the case
of the electrician at San Jose. lam as
suming a complete preparation â not only
that which makes death acceptable, but
that which recognizes its presence when it
comes.
Take the case of a man shot through the
heart. If he is not instantly killed he will
very likely say, "I am killed." He will
not call for a doctor, for his knowledge,
acquired in an instant, is that a doctor's
services would be useless, and such a cal
would mean that the instinct of life hadl
not been destroyed. Nor does he betray
any alarm. He remarks, simply as a
matter of information to those about him,
"I am killed." Such cases have been in
numerable. A current of electricity tear
ing through a man's vitals or a bullet
plowing tl rough his body might be ex
pected to cause inconceivable pain. The
curious part of it is that an injury suf
ficiently severe to cause -death at" once
seems instantly to produce a condition of
insensibility to pain. This means to say
that dying is painless, whether it be
brought about by an injury or disease.
Were it not so the dying man through
whom a fatal current or a bullet had just
passed would be in so great agony that he
could perceive nothing, not even the ad
vent of death, and could much less an
nounce that he was dying.
Wore mysterious than the inconceivably
quick preparation of the man who has re
ceived a fatal injury is the readiness with
which condemned men mount the scaffold
to be hanged. lam prepared to hear all
sorts of arguments against an assumption
that in this case there has been effected a
natural preparation for death. It will he
said that the condemned has become "re
signed" (which is really but another name
for natural preparation), or that he is sus
tained by pride, or that lie has firmly
fixed his hopes on a future life of happi
ness (which again is but another wording
for natural preparation).
The subject is very obscure, but all the
more fascinating for that. Many men
who had been thoroughly resigned to the
scaffold have been reprieved, but none of
them has furnished a record of his exact
mental condition at the time when he
thought death was at hand. It is a sig
nificant fact, however, that when re
prieved, even after mounting the scaffold,
the condemned has never, so far as I have
been able to learn, exhibited any extraor
dinary emotion. There was no wild and
delirious joy over the return of a prospect
of prolonged life. On the contrary, it is
generally remarked in the reports of such
cases that the condemned showed no
marked emotion, being very much less
moved than the bystanders. We may
imagine that he was really ready to die;
that, as in the case of the well man shot
through the heart, nature had brought
him to accept death cheerfully. The
agitation which n: any condemned men
exhibit on the scaffold may or may not be
the operation of the instinct to live â there
are other ways of accounting for it.
The reprieved man, assuming that he
has parted with the instinct to live, will
recover it quickly and of course uncon
sciously. In other words, he will never
realize that he has been in any very strange
mental condition, vastly different from any
that he had ever experienced before, for
these changes must be beyond his percep
tion, just as an insane man rarely knows
of his infirmity. Hence we could not ex
pect a reprieved man to give a record of
his impressions.
The question now opens into a broad
and bewildering field. It brings us face to
face with martyrdoms, in which death has
been met with p< rfect cheerfulness. It is
conceivable that here, as with a con
demned man, there has come about a nat
ural preparation for death analogous to
that seen in the case of the man dying of a
slow disease or killed by a shot through
the heart. A knowledge of the certainty
of death within a definite time or under
known circumstances has performed the
function of disease or fatal injury. The
inquiry reaches far beyond this, but we
must stop it here. The suicide clearly be
longs in the category of those in whom
the preparation is complete, for in such a
case it must be that the Instinct Ol life
â the thing which makes us avoid causes
that produce death â has perished. The
fact that the suicide not only accepts
death, but goes out of his way to bring it,
often employing in that pursuit means
which inflict the most terrible pains, is
sufficient proof that death is welcome when
life is no longer feasible.
The subject is so involved in mystery
that little more than speculation is pos
sible in discussing it, but is sufficiently in
teresting, even though it may not be im
portant, to attract far more attention than
it has received.

The solicitors sent out to secure sub
scriptions in aid of the work of making
permanent exhibits of California products
in the Eastern cities are meeting with re
markable success. Those who would be
the most likely to be beneli ted are asked
to subscribe a dollar a month for a year.
These solicitors are to begin work in the
same direction in the other cities and in
the country.
The first move to be made with this
money will be to establish in Chicago a
general California State headnnarters, with
aline exhibit of all tlie products of this
State. The headquarters will also be a
bureau of information for those who are
interested in the Golden West. In time
excursions of tourists and prospective set
tlers will be started from that point. As
soon as the headquarters is established at
least twenty other exhibits will be placed
in as many other Eastern cities. With
these will be started out two lecturers,
who will be provided with a large collec
tion of stereopticon slides from all parts
Of the State, and lectures similar to tnose
given at Atlanta will be j:iven all over the
East. Two cooking exhibits of California
products will also be started out. The
cooking department at the Atlanta ex
position created a great demand for Cali
fornia products among those who visited
the big fair, and the intention is to con
tinue this lin-3 of work, so that the Euslern
demand for the products of this State will
become general.
Such exhibits as these, it is believed by
those who are hard at work upon the pro
ject, will have trreat influence upon thole
who leave the East and settle In the West.
Particular attention will be given to in
ducing only desirable people to come to
California, and principally those who have
money. The argument has been raised
that the unemployed of this coast should
be provided for before any others are in
duced to come this way. This is met with
the statement that this State is no more
unfortunate in the matter of its unem
ployed than the East. By bringing well
to-do people to California "the large tracts
of lands will of necessity be worked, and
this of itself will give employment to large
numbers of those who at present are un
able to secure work.
At any rate the State Development Com
mittee is thoroughly in earnest in its work
and ir is expected that the results of its
efforts will be made manifest before long

POLYPI PAIOTUESSI.T REMOVED.
The Experience of Mrs. A. M. Rudolph
of Oakland.
Mrs. A. M. Rudolph, whose portrait Is given
below, and who lives at 1471 Fifth street, Oak-
land, is a lady who is well and favorably
known in that city, She says:
Mrs. A. M. Rudolph, 1471 Fifth --i., Oakland.
My trouble commenced some twelve years
ago. It began with catarrh, the result of neg-
lected cold; this brought on a polypus growth
in my nostrils. My nostrils gradually stopped
up, and for years I could not breathe through
them, compelling me to keep my mouth open
all the time. I lost my appetite; could not
sleep; ran down in flesh and strength, and was
thoroughly miserable. I went to many doc-
tors, but could not obtain relief. I was afraid
of their barbarous methods of removing the
tumors. I had read so much of the Copeland
Medical Institute, and one day read of a case
exactly like mine. 1 then went to them and
placed my case in their care. They removed
the. tumors painlessly and without loss of
blood; the relief at once was worth a hundred
times what it cost. I can now breathe through
my nostrils freely and ieel better in every way.
I want every one to know the great good Drs.
Copeland, Neal and Winn have done for me,
and am only too glad to add my testimony in
their favor.

THE CONVENTION.
The convection of yesterday did its
work promptly and did it well. It
was at once aggressive and conserva
tive. It did all that was needed to
attest California's earnest opposition to
any form of a funding scheme and did not
weaken the strength and justice of that
position by attempting to go further. The
action taken and the resolutions adopt
ed can be ratified and indorsed by
men of all shades of opinion. They
do not undertake to declare what the Gov
ern mom should do with the road after the
defeat of the refunding scheme. They de
mand simply the enforcement of the law
against the railroad plutocrats as against
the poorest citizen, ami that is all Califor
nia asks or needs for her welfare and
prosperity.
A convention of this kind may be in full
truthfulness said to be representative of
the people of tne State. It was a meeting
of business men called to consider a
matter of most important business to the
public, who proceeded to perform tneir
work with a business-like precision and
directness. It stuck strictly to the task
before it and turned aside for no other
issue wnatever. Even those who may have
wished the convention had gone further
will certainly support it as far as it
did go. We are among those who hold
that it went far enough â that it did exactly
the right thing in the right way with the
right spirit and at the right time.
The whole tenor of the resolutions from
the first "whereas" to the closing expres
j sion of resolve is honest, virile, straight
! forward and just. They enter a solemn
i protest against any refunding bill what
ever and they request of the Govern
ment the beginning of foreclosure
proceedings at once. This is all that needs
â to be done at this juncture. New prob
i lems may arise in the future, but these
â  can be dealt with in the future.
j The issue now is clearly embodied
in the resolutions. There remains to
the people the plain duty of supporting
! the work of the convention by co-operating
vigorously with the committee appointed
' to carry it on. The prospects are pro
| pitious. The people are united, the cause
j is just, able leaders are to the front, and
with resolute action the victory will be
i ours.
A VOICE PEOM THE PAST.
The United States Circuit Court has
been engaged during the past week in
listening to the reading of the record of
the Pattison Railway Commission as a por
tion of the evidence introduced on behalf
of the People of California in the pending
action to enjoin their Railroad Commis
sioners from performing the duties im
posed by the express terms of the State
constitution.
The situation is somewhat singular. The
court is occupied in hearing the declara
tions of the controlling spirits of
the Central and Southern Pacific
railroads, made under oath almost
ten years ago before a Congressional
Committee, and now exhumed from the
uu.-ty archives of the past to be used
with overwhelming force against these two
corporations, although the lips of all of
the then living witnesses, save one, are
now closed in death. The incident illus
trates aptly the truth embodied in the
poem of "Eugene Aram's Dream" â
So wills the !Wce avenging sprite,
Til blocxi for bloo<i atones;
Aye, though he's buried in a cave
And trodden down with stones,
And years have rotted on" his flesh,
The world shall see his bones.
The Pattison Railway Commission was
one of the most remarkable bodies which
ever met in California, made an inquisi
tion or formulated a report. It was
an absolutely honest and perfectly fear
less Congressional committee, appointed
and equipped with power to investigate
the scandals â which had arisen over the
construction of the Pacific railroads and
of which the stench had blown east
ward and into the halls of Con
gress until some inquiry into their
origin and nature became a public ne
cessity. At the instance of Pattison of
Pennsylvania the commission was ap
â i with himself at the head. It came
to California, and during the years of
â 7 conducted the investigation which
is now finding its way into the
records of the Federal courts. For a
time the magnates of the railroad felt
themselves bound to submit to examina
tion and testified with a certain degree of
freedom. But they soon discovered
that the keenness of scent with
which Pattison sought for the
truth was more than their record of dis
honesty could endure and they then ap
pealed to certain of their pliant tools upon
the bench of the Federal courts for protec
tion. It was granted. The Pattison com
mission was told that it could not force
testimony from unwilling lips or compel
the production of incriminating records,
and the commission was obliged, re
luctantly, to forego its effort, and base its
report upon the evidence already ad
duced. That report, which was prob
ably written by Pattison himself, is
one of the most scathing arraignments of
the Pacific railroads which has ever been
put to print. The present Federal court
may feel impelled to refuse it admission
as a part of the evidence in the pending
case, but its conclusions, based as they are
upon the declarations of the railroad
builders themselves, it should hesitate to
disagree with or disregard.
There have been some singular things
developed recently with reference to this
report. It is contained in several volumes
of public records, and at one time was
easy of access upon the shelves of local
libraries. Strange to say, from every pub
lic library and from many semi-public
places such as newspaper offices these
volumes have mysteriously disappeared
until it is now almost an impossibility to
find a complete set of the reports in this
City. In view of this fact it is
interesting to learn that the substance of
the commissions work is to be made a
portion of the record of the Federal court,
from which it is hardly credible to believe
the same interested larcenist wil-1 have
the audacity to attempt its abstraction.
POSTAL SAVINGS.
In past years whenever an attempt to
pass a postal-savings scheme through Con
gress failed the cry was raised that the de
feat represented the influence of the banks.
We have not observed that attention has
been called to any such opposition in the
case of the postal-savings measures which
have been recently introduced in Congress.
The logic of the case is antagonistic to any
assumption of bank opposition, for the
reason that as the interest proposed to be
paid by the Government is much smaller
than that paid by savings banks a postal
saving account would more than likely be
transferred to savings banks after it had
reached a size sufficient for bank-account
purposes.
As a rule economy and its extreme ex
pression, penuriousness, are the result of
necessity. Californiana scorned to use any
coin smaller than a 25-OMit piece until op
portunities for making a great deal of
money with little effort became restricted.
The same rule applies to small saviDga;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
they are not likely to be made by prosper
ous persons. At the same time it is well
to teach children the importance of say
ing, and hence it is in the education of the
young that a postal-saving institution
would have one of its highest uses.
The best plan in operation in Europe
may be illustrated by using the names of
American coins in describing it. A person
may deposit a sum as small as a cent. An
account is opened with him. For his cent
be is given a card divided into ten com
partments, each the size of a one-cent
stamp, and a cent stamp which the post
master affixes to the card. For ten cents
the entire card is thus filled, and in ex
change for it the depositor receives a card
divided into ten compartments, each de
signed to receive ten ten-cent stamps.
Upon surrendering his one-cent card he is
given a ten-cent card with one of the com
partments rilled with a ten-cent stamp.
\Vhen this card is filled he surrenders it
and receives another card divided into ten
compartments, but each represent? $1, and
one of the compartments is filled with a
$1 stamp in exchange for the filled ten-cent
card which he has surrendered. The next
card has $10 compartments.
The system is so simple that any child can
understand it, our decimal system making
it peculiarly applicable to this country.
Whether or not any of the bills before
Congress embody this plan we are not
informed, but if not it should be presented,
and the measure could find no more suita
ble advocates than the great labor organi
zations of the country.
THE NATIONAL CONVENTIONS.
The contest among the larger cities of
the East for the Democratic National Con
vention became, toward the close, a rivalry
between Chicago and St. Louis, and re
sulted in the success of the former. The
result is regarded as something of a vic
tory for the gold wing of the party. Cer
tain it is that the New York influence,
when it was found imnossible to carry the
convention to that city, was exerted on
behalf of Chicago, and, as New York is de
voted to the gold interest, it is not likely
that her choice between the rival cities
was determined solely by geographical
considerations.
Now that the calls for both of the great
National conventions have been issued,
Presidential politics will rapidly increase
in interest until it becomes the absorbing
issue of the time. It seems evident that
we are to have a campaign widely differ
ent from any that have taken place since
the war. The breaking up of the Solid
South is but one of the many proofs of the
changed conditions that politicians and
statesmen will have to confront in making
the canvass. Along with these changes in
conditions there will be changes in the
issues that are to be discussed, and, ac
cordingly, tha campaign will have the
interest of novelty added to that of the
usual excitement of oratory and proces
sions.
It is satisfactory to note that all the
changes wliich have taken place either in
conditions or in issues have been strength
ening to the Republican party. The break â 
in the solid South, that stronghold of I
Bourbon Democracy, has not been more \
complete than the break in Democracy it
self. The very fact that the selection of a
site for holding the National Convention I
was regarded as a contest between rival !
factions of the party is an evidence of how
far the factional divisions are carried, and
how easy it is to rouse them to antagonism j
on any subject upon which the party as a
whole is called upon to decide and to act.
Both conventions will in all probability
be unusually exciting this year, but there
will be a wide difference between the two
in the causes of the excitement, and that
difference will illustrate the contrast that
exists betweei. the conditions of the par
ties themselves. In the Republican Con-
vention there will be harmony in the male
ing of the platform, and the interest will !
lie in the struggle to decide among many
able leaders as to which shall be chosen
for the Presidency. In such a contest
there will be much vigor and much enthu
siasm, but no sign of those dissensions
that weaken a party at the beginning of a
campaign. Very different will be the con
tests that will rage in the Democratic Con
vention. Xo great popular leaders will vie
with one another for victory there. The '
contests will be over the principles of the â¢
platform, and if they end without causing I
the convention to break up in confusion it
will he only because one faction or the i
other is willing to carry compromises to
the verge of subserviency.
WANTED- A VOLCANO.
A valued correspondent, whose imagina
tion has been fired by the news that Kil
auea. the famous Hawaiian volcano, is
again active, writes to secure the opinion
of The Call on the probability of renewed
activity in one or more of the ancient vol
canoes which constitute such remarkable
features of thÂ« topog.raphv of California,
and expresses a hope that such a happen
ing will occur to add to the already long
list of the State's attractions. lie in
geniously arjjue's that "in Mexico we have
active volcanoes to the left of us, in Alaska
an active volcano to the right of us, in the
Sandwich Islands an active volcano in
front of us, and at home many desolate
and dreary old craters that sit sullen, de
crepid and silent."
It is in the nature of all things earthly to
be born, to live and to die. This is as true
of wliimsies, humors and forms of badinage
as of races, dynasties and volcanoes. Read
ing the story of the rocks of California we
find that our great volcanoes have been
slumbering for a longer time than Vesu
vius and jfctna were ever known to remain
asleep, and this gives us cause to despair
of their awakening.' Since scientists have
disposed, in a rather high-handed manner,
of the connection between volcanoes and
earthquakes, which may crack badly built
houses, it might be pleasant to have
Shasta, or Lassens Peak, or St. Helena
"belch forth fire, smoke and lava," but it
is sufficiently interesting to reflect on the
wonderful things that our volcanoes did
while they were in business.
The greatest of them all was Shasta, but
the most wonderful was St. Helena, which
is so near San Francisco that it may be
seen from the higher eminences about the
City. While Shasta, commencing on a
plain 3000 feet above the level of the sea,
built a beautiful symmetrical cone nearly
12,000 feet above the p/ain, St. Helena re
versed the course of a river and created a
petrified forest. And this, in the slow
fashion of geology in telling its tales, was
only the other day â that is to say, many
thousands of years ago.
In the early days, before Dana saw ante
lope come down to the water's edge on the
Marin shore and gaze curiously at the
ship which passed through the Goiden
Gate with the author of "Two Years Be
fore the Mast," Russian River flowed
almost directly westward to the sea. About
the same time the volcano emitted an in
conceivable amount of ashes, which sifted
through and completely buried a forest of
redwoods near Calistoga. The ashes piled
far above the tree summits, and in the
course of the ages the trees were siiicified.
Then came the eroding rains, washing the
ashes away and leaving the stone trees
standing till an earthquake overturned and
shattered them ; but they lie there to-day,
silently telling their marvelous history.
No active volcano in California could be
more wonderful than the easily read his
tory which they wrote oefore they died.
AN ALLURING WOED.
The various schemes which have been
recently devised for securing the wealth of
gold that all reason teaches us must lie in
the beds of the rivers which come down
from the old hydraulic and placer gold
fields are remindful of the appropriateness
of the word "golden" in its application
to so many objects and conditions in Cali
fornia, and particularly to the Golden
Gate. It is a curious fact that yellow is
the predominating color in California.
Overshadowing all other colors is the yel
low of the sunshineâ a peculiar and dis
tinctive characteristic of the natural light.
The prevalent hue of the soil is yellow,
and in summer the plains are carpeted
with the most gorgeous of all yellow
flowers, the amapola, or eschscholtzia, or
California poppy, as one's jaw may be best
fitted to the name; and the gold of our
mines is more yellow than that which any
other part of the world has ever produced
except ancient Etruria.
The configuration of major California
discloses two great valleys forming a con
tinuous plain 500 miles long and 3ixty
miles wide, besides a number of smaller
valleys draining to the common basin into
which the two great valleys pour their
yellow wealth. This place' of common
assembly is the bay of San Francisco, and
thn bay opens to the great ocean through
the Golden Gate. Through this gateway,
so happily named, flows the great yellow
treasure in infinite variety, but nearly
always yellow, to every corner of the earth.
Through the long years of gold-mining
in the area which drains through the
Golden Gate there has been carried down
constantly a stream of gold which the me
chanical genius of men has not been able
to impound. It lies strewn along the beds
of the rivers, it freights the bottom of the
bay of San Francisco, it adds to the rigid
ity of the bar that guards the Golden Gate
in a wido segment of a circle twenty miles
to sea. During inconceivable ages preced
ing the era of gold-mining the streams had
been carrying down this precious treasure
and depositing it wherever it could find a
resting place. Wherever the lava cap cov
ering the beds of the ancient gold-bearing
rivers had been worn away the rains had
washed out the gold and sent it down the
streams and out through the Golden Gate.
Everything that work 3to the dislodging
and developing of the natural resources
that lie in the soil of the yellow plains and
underneath the russet of the hills and
mountains back of them partakes of the
color and value of gold. This must all
pass through San Francisco to be prepared
and refined and made useful, and in that
fact resides the coming greatness of the
City.

"Now consider for a moment the effect such

It should be made so attractive that the lay- |

true, nevertheless. Aye, indeed it is.

approval of the entire population to sell it for
anything like the amount it is really entitled

How can they? The Art Association is all
goofl enough in its way, but It is filled with
local work, and artists all of one quarter are
not likely to see many remarkable traits in |
their neighbors.

William Kelleher, a pioneer of California,
celebrated far and near in the earlier days of
the State's history for his hospitality and his
admiration and emulation of tne manners of
old Spanish dons, returned recently from Texas
to spend some time among friends here.
People who knew Kelleher had almost for
gotten him, and many had thought him dead,
for in a quarter of a century not a word had
been heard from the singular pioneer who
came back to California as he had left. The
only difference was Kelleher had amassed halt
a million or more dollnrs in his absence from
California, and was, therefore, a very rich man
when he appeared suddenly among old-time
friends with quite as much mystery as when he
left.
One of Kelleher's old associates told an in
teresting story about him the other day. It
made Kelleher a hero of romance.
"Thirty years ago he lived in Pacheco Valley,
up in Contra Costa County," said the vener
able pioneer.
"The boys used to call him the 'don.' He
was a typical old-time Caiifornian Spaniard
and his home in Pacheco Valley a typical old
time Spanish hacienda. That is" as far as hos
pitality went and the style of living that Kel
leher kept up. Every one was welcome there,
rich or poor; tramp, peddler or millionaire.it
was all the same. The wayfarer in Pacheco
Valley knew the house, and its fame was
spread far and near. Kelleher was a veritable
don in that country. To offer him money for
his hospitality would be an insult. Yet,
with all this generosity and free and open way
of living, Kelleher acquired wealth aa a
rancher.
"More than a quarter of a century ago when
he grew independently rich and was at the
height of his popularity, he was induced by
friends to run for the Legislature. But there
was one thing he had forgotten. Kelleher
could not write, and that crushed him. What
do you think his political opponents did?
They posted big signs all over the district iiko
this:
" 'William Kelleher, his signature, X.'
"The big X defeated Kelleher so Dadly that
with the ridicule it brought he pulled up his
stakes and got out. He sold his farm and the
growing crops, closed his hospitable house and
j eft it to a stranger, and moved far away from
California. In Texas he bought thousands o*
acres at nominal prices, and with the advance
in land values became immensely wealthy.
He is now a bank director in Austin, Tex. But
among strangers he set himself assiduously to
learn reading and writing, and succeeded
splendidly."
Kellcher put up at the Lick House while
visiting San Francisco. The clerk wrote his
name incorrectly upon the register.
"That's not right," Kelleher remarked curtly.
"Will you please correct it?" asked the clerk.
"I don't care how it's spelled in California;
that's good enoughâ we'll let it go at that."

THE BICYCLE AND THE RAILROAD.
The great bicycle army of the Empire State
is in the saddle at Albany, we understand, and
proposes to scorch through the corridors ol
the Capitol and into the very presence of the
Legislature, prepared to dismount only when
it has secured surrender to Its proposition that
the bicycle is Daggage so far as the railroads
are concerned. On the other hand we are in
formed that the railroads have steam up and
propose to make no stops until they are face to
face with the enemy, prepared to contest the
right of way through the Legislature on any
such proposition. Here, then, is an interest
ing opportunity for a collision, the echoes of
which will be heard in the spring, when the
highways and byways of the suburbs are ia
condition to woo the pneumatic tire
It is an old contest and a wordy one. Iten
gnged our attention in the summer and fall, as
it promises to engage our attention during the
winter. We learn that Assemblyman Arm
strong of Rochester has concealed about him a
bill id amend section 44 of chapter 31 of tho
lairs of the State which relates to the regula
tion of railroad business, by declaring bicycles
accompanied by owners to be baggage and'sub
ject to tne same liabilities; the bicycles to be
transported free where the passenger releases
the corporation from such liability, oti.
a charge of not less than 10 cents" and not to
exceed 2 mills a mile, may be authorized.
The contention of the bicyclist in brief is
that he is seldom accompanied by other bag
gage and as he is entitled by bis ticket to 100
DoundE there is no just reason why his wheel
should not be carried without charge In a
He-car. The raiload argues that if bi
cycles are to be- designated as bagguue it will
become necessary for the owners to crate them
so that they can be handled as such and piled
up in the cars; otherwise the companies would
be subjected to great hardship, for the reason
that bicycles must be treated with great care
and cannot be uiled one upon another.
They insist that they arc justified in levying
an extra charge because only the floor of a car
can be used for tlie.-o vehicles, thus calling for
of two or more cars where one would
suffice tor the same number of trunks. The
same argun â  I in the bundling of bicy
cles at st;::i..:;-. f â  , r the reason that trunks aro
piled high on the trucks, while the wheels
must be handled separately, greatly increasing
the cost to the railroads.
It will thus be seen that each side of the con
troversy is pretty well intrenched, and we will
await the verdict of legislative wisdom with
the same acute interest that must consume the
wheelmen. .Possibly much will depend upon

LOUIS JAMES has enjoyed a pros- '
porous season at the California
Theater, where he has shone as a
bright particular star, with an ef
fulgence that was not expected of j
him by people who had only seen .lames
when his lijzht was obscured if not hid
under Frederick Warde's bushel. His sue
with his own company has certainly
proved that he knew which side his bread I
was buttered on when he ceased the col- j
laboration which for the last few years I
baa made the namea <>f Warde and James
as inseparable as the Siamese twins. In
defiance of the alphabetical order of
things, it was always Warde's first and
.Tames' second in the days when the two
scintillated together, and James must find j
it praieful and comforting that his new
venture not only gives him an opportunity
of confining his exertions to the roles for
which he is best fitted but also drives him
a larger share of this world's goods than
he enjoyed when he and Warde shared the
spoils.
After the departure of the Tavary
Opera Company Frederick Warde comes to
the Baldwin Theater, and it will be inter
esting to see how he stands the test of
shining without his late collaborator. It
is announced that after this season Warde
lecided to appear in nothing but
arean dramas.

by James W. ilarkins, the author of "The
White Squadron" ana other popular plays
of the heavy type.
"A Man Without a Country" has never
before been produced in San Francisco.
The story is said to be strong in situations
which center principally round the mur
aer, by his spendthrift son, of a wealthy
New Orleans planter. The parricide, be
lieving himself to be dying, confesses his
guilt, but subsequently recovers and end
less complications ensue.
The comedy is said to be bright and to
counteract the graver element. The stock

make his initial appearance on this stage
in the role of Ruth, the blind girl.

LOOKS WERE DECEPTIVE.
How a Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren Officer Was Foiled.
Agent Wilson of the Gerry Society
called at Proctor's Pleasure Palace in New
York one night to investigate the ages of
the juveniles whose singing in the News
boys' Quintet is much applauded. One
wizen-faced youngster was regarded with
special suspicion and was subjected to a
rigid examination as to age, nativity and
parentage. He would not commit himself
on the question of age, but sullenly in
sisted that he was "old enough not to keep
Gerry awake nights." The agent sug
gested that the lad better have his mother
call at the society's rooms and answer a
few questions.
"Me mudder!" said the youth scorn
fully; "what's de matter wid having me
wife call and perduce me two kids?"
With that he whipped oat the photo
graphs of a couple of healthy youngsters,
the elder apparently 8 years old. Then he
explained that he was 25 years of age and
had been a respectable married man since
reaching his majority. : The Gerry agent
smiled sadly and withdrew.
THE STAGE PHYSICIAN.
A Character That Jerome Left Out of
His Book.
One of the best chapter.? in Jerome's
Stageland is that in which he describes the
stage lawyer, who never has an office, but
transacts all his business in the parlors of
his clients, concerning whose family af
fairs he possesses the most comprehensive
knowledge. There is a stage lawyer of
this description in "Liberty Hall," and in
a drama I saw recently there is another
character fully as well known to the play
goers of to-day, but one whom, unless my
memory be at fault, Mr. Jerome has
I slighted in his clever book. This character
i is the stage doctor, and, like his compan
ion of the legal profession, he is usually
shown to be a well-dressed, portly man,
full of years and whiskers. When invited
to a dinner party it is his custom to ar
rive after the other guests have assembled,
which gives the host an opportunity to
say :
â¢'Ah! here comes our old friend, Dr.
Catnip, famous as an authority on apo
plexy and well skilled in all diseases of the
heart.'"
It has been noticed by observant theater
goers that the stage doctor's arrival always
presages some accident, sudden illness or
death; but that fact does not prevent his
being a welcome guest in every theatrical
household. He has a large practice, which
may be due to the fact that he is always
within call when wanted, and never gets
drunk and prescribes arsenic in place of
rhubarb. He diagnoses all cases by feel
ing the patient's pulse, displaying at the
same time an enormous gold watch, which
his lucrative practice enables him to pos
sess. With the aid of this watch, which
he never looks at, and his linger on the
afflicted one's pulse, he makes the most
astounding discoveries, and will exclaim,
with his eyes fixed on the lirst balcony:
"I fear that he is beyond all human aid,
for his skull is broken in three places." â

Tli.. Original One.
Adam had slept too long.
He felt sure of it as he stretched himself,
yawned, and rose with a heavy sensation
in his head and a lightness round his
stomach, to take another turn about the
garden.
But, suddenly, he doubted whether he
was yet awake.
There, in front of him, was an animal he
had never seen before. He thought it was
an animal. But it was strangely like him
self, yet strangely different. His surprise
increased. For some moments he was
speechless. Then:
'â¢What are you?" he gasped.
The unusual creature smiled.
She picked a loose hair off one of his
shoulders, compared it with his wild, un
kempt locks and smiled agayi.

BOOKS AND BOOKMAKERS.
TT TT GRACE EATON WALKER is
== I the name of the latest aspirant
I for honors in the realm of poesy.
JJL JA If we judgecorrectly. Mr. Walker
is a man of wealth and leisure ; of
wealth because no publisher could be so lost
to his interests as to issue a volume of Mr.
Walker's roenis on speculation; while
only a man oi means could afford the ex
pensive pleasure of exposing his literary
shortcomings in the very best style of the
printer; and of leisure, because it most
have required an inconceivable amount of
time to put so many words into so many
shapes under the sole inspiration of get
ting together lines and rhymes and pages
enough to make a good-sized book.
The most pretentious thing in Mr.
Walker's volume is a "dramatic poem"
entitled "The King of Argos." Mytho
logical stories are tortured into service and
in the mouths of some of the classical
characters up-to-date slang is almost as
common as it is on Tar Flat or the Bowery.
The King of Argus ha? a daughter, but
prays vainly for a ?on. "A ghost" reveals
to him the fact that he will die sonless;
that the daughter will give birth to a sou
who will kill his royal grandfather and
reign in Argns. The old King decides to
kill off that daughter right speedily.
"I'll starve her stomach iot by jot, '"is the
poetic resolve that he comes to. .Mr.
Walker then makes his ancient history
monarch boast of being
Such a king
Af never ancient history found a greater.
Argos, having hit upon a plan of de
struction that suits him, cries out :
Ye power* of hell and all satanic regions,
I've done it.
He has concluded to build "a brazen
tomb for living corpses." and starts out to
find the brazier, who bears the familiar
name of Faldaff. Two heavy villains,
bent on robbery, dog the King's* steps.
"Where went he, BraskerV asks Hard
spur, the first villain.
â¢'Just through the grove, Sir Hard
spur," is the response, which goes to show
the wretched taste of modern nobility in
copying knightly titles from ancient
rogues. It now seems piain, too, that the
surname of Hotspur, [riven to Harry Percy,
thÂ« "valiant rebel" of Shakespeare's
"Henry IV," was simply nri idea borrowed
from the Argolian name of Hardspur.
'What matters it, lord or beggar, if he
have the stuff?" queries Brasker. The
Toques of Atl'os were very much addicted
to^ the use of slang, according to Mr.
Walker. Perhaps he can also trace to an
Â©rigin with Brasker and his fellow-rascals
euch expressions as "dowse the glim" and

1 "collar the swag." But let us pursu* the
\ conversation :
Hardspurâ King or prince, h!s moneys oars.
Rraskc râ For we need mouey more than we need
\ bread.
The first declaration sounds like a choice
passage from a Bowery-dive version of
Robin Hood; but the admission by Bras
ker is something startling. The author
: leave? us in vague doubt at this point.
i He throws no ray of light on the purpose
for which the money was needed. It may
be supposed, however, that the villains
had tired of ordinary fare and were re
solved, at all hazards, to wrest from their
sovereign the price of a pie.
The wicked twain approach the King
with drawn swordp; the monarch's purse is
yielded up, and then in a conversation
which follows his Majesty declares him
\ self, shows his signet-ring and pardons the
\ offending pair on their promise to do his
bidding. The villains are then employed
to steal the King's daughter from the
palace and imprison her in the brass cage,
that she may starve to death.
In p otting the destruction of his daugh
ter, Dans, the King makes his offense
more heinous by ruthlessly slaughtering
English grammar. Witness this assault
on the Anglo-Saxon toncue:
â²polio does decree that I
Shalt never h- a father, and decrees
That Dante shait become a mother, and
This son of hers shall slay the King of Argos.
The brass cage is built; the villains seize
the daughter and rush her into the death
trap. Just then an earthquake takes place.
Zeus, the pagan god, having witnessed the
prelude to the tragic deed, cracks the
earth in bis rage.
After hurling a thunderbolt, which plows
a furrow across the face of Argos, Zeus up
braids Hardspur in most undignified and
commonplace terms and then listenÃ to
this gem of a prayer from the robber:
O King of sods, and all God's deeds, I pray,
b thee. spare me is a victim of
Necessity. Klso I'd hit-d to Sistlne Chapel,
And in the p&r:)iqua!ie had my pater noster
Well waded through.
Thi3 is exceedingly rich. The Lord's
prayer, according to the New Testament.
in the mouth of a pagan Greek a thousand
years before the Christian era.
Zeus rescues Danre, wooes her, makes
her his queen; a son is born to her, and
mother and child miraculously escape the
King's wrath, and flee to a strange land.
Arrived at the gate of manhood, the son
performs feats of strength like another
Theseus or Hercules. He returns to Argos,
where, in throwing quoits, he accidentally
hits and kills the King, and then himself
takes hold of the monarch}'.
In turning over the pages of Mr. Walk- j
er's book one is almost sure to recall the i
couplet of Byron:
'Tis pleasant sure to see one's name In print!
A book's Â» book, although there's nothing in 't, j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
The author dishes up a dozen sonnets to
spring. Here is one fractional example:
Has summer such a loveliness? or fall?
Or autumn with his hoary fields of grain?
It is possible that Mr. Walker is color
blind. In this part of the world the
autumn grainiield is as yellow as Mr.
Walker's poetry. Mr. Walker is original,
however, in having the fall come between
summer and autumn.
If Horace Eaton Walker threatens to
print any more volumes of the sort we
nave partially reviewed, Sir Galahad will
be doing a very kindly thing, in a literary
sense, if he complies with the poetaster's
prayer and gives him a cupful â aye, a
bucketful if need be, of the "solace"" that
Mr. Walker hankers after in the following
strain :
O, what Is life that I can be so sad?
O, what is death that I am comfortless?
O, let me drain thy cup. Sir Galahadâ
Dare let me drain it, in my love's distress.
[Claremont, N. H. George I. Putnam
&Co.]
TRAVELING AT SHALL EXPENSE.
"Around the World on Sixty Dollars"
is Robert Meredith's account of extensive
travel for little money. The title is rather
misleading, however, as some $225 was
spent on the trip, "all but about $60" of
which the traveler earned on the road at
common labor. The time consumed was
a year and six days. Four months and a
half was spent in work on the Sandwich
Islands and in the Holy Land at wages
ranging from 40. cents to $2 50 a day, the
rest of the time being devoted to travel
and sightseeing. The distance covered
was 30,000 miles.
The principal thing to be learned from
the book is this: If (like Mr. Meredith) a
man is willing to suffer discomforts with
out number, live on rations th at would
not satisfy the average Chinaman, mingle
with the lowest classes even-where as a
rule, sleep in the worst hovels or in the
open air, affect direst poverty and let no
chance of alms-getting slip by, then he
may see the world without the expenditure
of much money.
There are very few men who will care to
emulate Mr. Meredith's example. When
he started out he had three objects in view,
so he states: First, to prove that an
American can live on as poor rations and
endure as many hardships as any other
human being; second, that he can earn
his living in any country; and third, that
a poor man need not be deprived of the
pleasures of travel and of seeing and en
! joying more than the rich.
The second proposition was never very
much in doubt with the genuine Yankee,
i but it is hard to reconcile the first and
third. The average poor man would
i hardly find pleasure in seeing how
j wretched he might become, or much
| enjoyment in traveling on the strength of
: one short meal a day. From a close
j scrutiny of the book "one is led to the
; conclusion that Mr. Meredith's "objects"
I were after-considerations of his tramp,
â¢ and that they were formulated simply m
, order to furnish the semblance of a pur
pose for the publication.
Here is the way the writer adapted him
seif to the "manners and customs" of the
1 people of the various countries: "I would
, eat poi with my lingers with the Kanakas,
, eat rice with the chopsticks of the China
; man, dip bread in the same sop with the
j Bedouin, of the desert and practice swal
; lowing the long, slimy sticks of macaroni
with the descendants bf the Csesars."
Mr. Meredith started from Kansas City,
â  and journeyed toward the sanaet. He
â  thinks California a wonderful State in
j every respect, and declares that "when the
j people there, like the people in lowa, learn
that no solid wealth ever comes except by
[ the slow process of hard knocks and dili
gent labor, they will have one of the best
States in the Vnion."
Had Mr. Meredith remained longer in
California, or had he traveled half as much
in our valleys as he did in the valleys near
Jerusalem, he would have discovered that
solid wealth is abundant here; that it
comes by quicker process than lowans are
able to realize, ami that comfort and Rood
living are obtained here with fewer '"bard
knocks" than in any other part of the
globe. Why, California plays second
fiddle to no State in the Union for re
sources, advantages and opportunities. It
is only the innate modesty of our people
tnat keeps back the boast which conscious
merit urgesâ that California, among the
States, is to-day unqualifiedly "the best."
A hard saving man is Mr. Meredith. Ar
riving in San Francisco he put aside $90
lor traveling expenses and cut him
self down to one meal a day. This single
meal and a bed cost him 50 cents. As he
sought the commonest fare he might have
gotten three or four meals and a room for
that 50 cents if he had not been too hasty
in selecting a boarding-place.
Working his way to the Hawaiian Isl
ands Mr. Mereditli obtained work on one
of the sugar plantations. There in keep
ing bachelor's hall he outrivaled the
Chinese in the cheapness of his fare, and
he makes it apparent that the Celestials
were more particular than he in their
mode of Jiving.
In Australia, â¢where other Americans
have made money, Mr. Meredith was the
victim of a cold frost and he left on the
first vessel bound for England, via the
Suez canal. The Holy Land interested him
JOHN" KENDRICK BANGS.
most of all. as he had studied the Bible
considerally, and he took great pleasure in
camping where he imagined Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob camped and fed their
docks by the River Jordan.
The author visits Egypt and climbs the
pyramids; goes to Athens, and muses on
the Acropolis; journeys to Rome, where
the wonders daze him ; tramps to Naples,
and then takes a "two days' trip to Vesu
vius and Pompeii, which cost him only 40
cents"; got glimpses of the darker quar
ters of Paris and London, and returned
home seemingly with as much satisfac
tion as might be entertained by one gifted
to view in classic light the vast history
breathing monuments of ancient glory,
near which the scholars of the world have
loved to linger.
Mr. Meredith's descriptions of cities and
places are hardly worth the reading. He
has learned something about the foreign
pauper classes and not much else of conse
quence. Nevertheless, the book, as a

JOHN KENJORICK BANGS.
John Kendrick Bangs, whose portrait
may be found on this page of The Call, is
best known as the author of that laughable
travesty, "A Houseboat on the Styx."
His reputation as a writer is quite of recent
date, though he has been known for some
years as the editor of and an occasional
contributor to New York Life.
Mr. Bangs was born in Yonkers, N. V.,
in 1862. In 1883 he was graduated a bach
elor of philosophy from the School of
Political Science of Columbia College.
For a year and a half he studied lawâ as
he puts itâ "at long range."
Disliking his legal studies he entered
the service of Harper & Bros., in 1888, to
take charge of the humorous department
of their periodicals, which position be still
holds.
In 1886, shortly after his marriage, Mr.
Bangs made a lengthened stay in Eng
land, where his first book, "Roger Camer
den,' was written. This was followed by
"New \VagginjÂ»sof Old Tales," "Kathef
me and "Mephistopheles," the latter
two of which were successfully dramatized.
His first substantial success, however, was
with the publication of "Coffee and Ke
partee," which is now in its fortieth
thousand.
Other books published since that time
by Mr. Bangs have been "Toppleton's
Client," brought out by a London house;
"The Water Ghost," "The Idiot," "Mr.
Bonaparte of Corsica,": "A Houseboat on
the Styx." "A Rebellious Heroine." which
will appear in Harper's next issue, and
"Three Weeks in Politics."
The "Houseboat on the Styx." already
mentioned, is one of the latest and best of
Mr. Bangs' works. In this he recounts
the doings of a select body of immortal
ghosts, who organize themselves into a
C Â« fo . r mutual intercourse and social ben
efit. Here we find old Charon the steward
ana general manager of an association
which generously permits such diverse
characters as Demosthenes and Dr. John
son Confucius and Lord Bacon. Nero and
Shakespeare, Emerson and P. T. Barnum
to hold sweet converse.
To get the full benefit of these gentle
men s conversation, it would ;be well for
Â»wmf rtÂ° take U P Marion Crawford's
fÂ«n he , Immortals." A perusal of this,
followed by a "Houseboat on the Styx, ;
possesses a sort of educational value, inas
much as it affords a favorable opoortunity
for comparing the work of two literary
Americans. It is also warranted to cure
the sharpest known rit of the blues.
THE NUKNBEKG STOVE.
A new edition of "Ouida's" charming
little story, published by R. F. Fenno &
Co., New York. It is got up in a very
dainty style, yellow and silver prevailing
in the binding.
A feature is made of the illustrations,
some of which are really exquisite. The
pictures are half-tone reproductions of
wash drawings, and serve to illuminate
the text in a very satisfactory manner.

CAPE OF STORMS.
The doctrine that the Jaws of morality
are the same for men as for women has
been the keynote of many a novel in these
later days, and various have been the
methods of expounding it. In anew story,
"Cape of Storms," Percival Pollard illus.
trates it in the lives of a young man and a
young woman who walk the primsose
paths of pleasure and acquire equally all
the experience that mutable loves can give.
The heroine and the hero having been
lovers in youth, meet after their various
experiences, and finding the old love still
strong within them, make a mutual con
fession of their "unworthiness" and re
ceive a mutual pardon. Afterward they
marry to live happily, according to the
example set in the old-time novel, and the
moral is made clear that a woman may
live as free as a man lives and suffer no
more shock to her womanhood than he
does to his manhood.
The subordinate characters of the story
are mainly artists and journalists of Chi
cago and a fascinating marri' d woman
who likes to have clever men around her
and aspires to have a salon. The book is
mainly made up of conversations, and in
all these there is an evident effort at wit,
satire, cynicism and general brilliancy,
but the success achieved is just barely suf
ficient to keep the story entertaining
enough to be a pastime. The incidents
are few and there is no attempt to give
them dramatic force except in one in
stance. Despite the rather risky nature of
the r>lot there is nothing at all risky in the
story as told, and it will have the usual
vogue of novels that claim to portray Chi
cago society as it is. ["Cape of Storms."
Percival Pollard, The Echo. Chicago.]
A MAN OF TWO MINDS.
Francis Tillou Buck is the author of a
little book entitled "A Man of Two
Minds." The book is little in every wayâ
in plot, in merit, in dramatic interest and
in size. This last is its redeeming quality.
The story begins as if it were intended for
a Sunday-school library, but the writer
(unconsciously perhaps) before the close
of his task ventures upon the borderland
of a theme that is permitted only to the
masters of literature. The scene between
Alfred Sheldon and the notorious Mrs.
Mills, for instance, is scarcely to be recom
mended for perusal by impressionable
boys and '.-iris, and the point sought to be
enforced is neither true nor healthful. The
affection of a simple-hearted maiden, the
pure love of a true woman, may not be
properly measured by the paroxysms of
an amorous woman of the world, who has
wearied of her own lawfully wedded mate
and is casting about to ensnare the hus
bands and sweethearts of other women.
The author who attempts such a measure
ment ia not to be congratulated. There is
relief in the reflection that "A Man of Two
Minds" is altogether fiction. This is a fact
which the author kindly impresses upon
the reader from the first pace to the last.
Some authors adroitly clothe their charac
ters with such human qualities and such
natural proclivities that the reader seems
to know them as if they existed in veritable
flesh and blood. Not so with Francis Til
lou Buck. His characters are mere shad
ows that seem to pass across the disk of an
obscurely lighted magic lantern, and that
at last disappear into airy nothingness, like
a will-o'-the-wisp or the phantom of a dis
solving view. [Published by the Merriam
Company, 67 Fifth avenue, New York.

CHAINED TO EARTH.
This is the age of novels, and every
cause, creed and controversy produces its
story with a moral as regularly as it pro
duces its arguments and polemics. ' It is
in the nature of the age, therefore, that
the present war on the church of Rome
waged by the A. P. A. has inspired the
writing of a romance to teach the doctrines
and conceptions of the attacking party.
The story is by a California author, Jane
Wooaworth-Bruner, and bears the title
"Chained to Earth." It is more of an
extravaganza than anything else. Three
spirits dwelling in another planet came to
this one in order to lead an earth life. Two
of them became Protestants and the third
a Catholic. The incidents of the tale are
of the character that are generally at
tributed to the Catholic priesthood by
their opponents of the most decided type.
The work can' hardly be called literature.
It was intended to present the Papal
church as an infamous institution, and to
the extent of the author's powers this has
been done without regard to anything else.

JOHN BOLTON'S CONTEST
He Wants More Than $15,000
From His Grandfather's
Estate.
â ..
Charges That James R. Bolton Was
Unduly Influenced Against His
Son.
The will of James R. Bolton. which has
been probated, and under the terms of
which the estate has been distributed, is
being contested by John R. Bolton, a
grandson of the testator. The grounds for
the contest are undue influence and un
soundness of mind.
James R. Bolton died on January 28,
1890. He left an estate valued at $.300,000.
Three days after his death Daniel Rogers
and Robert C. Bolton M!ed for probate a
will dated January 25, 18S8. Attached to
the will were two codicils, one dated April
6. 1889, and the other October 29, 1889.
Rogers and Robert Bolton were named as
executor*. The will was ad mil ted to pro
bate, the estate was distributed on Jan
uary 22, 1894. and on May 29, 1894, the ex
ecutors were discharged.
The petitioner is the 13-year-old son
of John M. Bolton, deceased, who was a
son of James R. Bolton, the testator, and
he has several brothers and sisters, all un
der age. In nis petition he avers that
prior to the execution of his will James
Bolton was afflicted with paralysis and
paresis, and that he was not in a mental
condition to sign any document, much
less a will disposing of an estate worth
$500,C00. It is also averred that Bolton
was for a lent: time, while mentally weak,
under the influence of Rogers, Robert
Bolton, Eutemia Estraca. Mary A. Bolton
and Frances P. Melliss. To these the bulk
of the property was bequeathed. These
bequests, he alleges, were secured by arti
fice and influence, for they forced him to
sign the will and the codicils as drawn.
Only a very small portion of the estate, a
piece of real estate valuei at $15,000, was
all that was left to John M. Bolton and his
family. This amount out of a $500,000 es
tate, it is claimed, is but an msigniticant
sum, and not at all like what the testator
would have left had be not been influenced
against John M. Bolton and his family.
The petitioners pray that the will ad
mitted to probate be declared not to be the
last will of James R. Bolton; that its pro
batn be revoked; that the order of distri
bution be vacated, and that an adminis
trator be appointed until the estate can be
properly distriouted.

[ WHOLESALE AND RETAIL.THE LATEST FASHION GOSSIP
FOR WOMEN
AND MEN
THIS week I give illustrations of a
girl's frock, a morning dress and
a ball eown. The girl is clad in
a dark blue poplin, trimmed with
velvet one shade darker, over
which is a cape collar of beautiful
silk guiDure. Poplins of a most superior
quality are now in vogue, and come in
every imaginable shade, making excellent
dresses for schoolgirls. The matinee is
composed of pale gray flannel combined
with dark crimson surah. The ribbon ia of
the same shade. This is very becoming for a
brunette or a demi-blonde, but the blue
eyed, fair-haired young mistress should
substitute pale blue or rose color.
The ball gown is a Parisian creation, the
simple godeted skirt being light blue
Batin, adorned only with three bows of
ribbon velvet placed at regular intervals
down the leftside; the bows increase in
size as they descend. The blouse corsage
is of mousseline de soie over satin of the
ume shade. It is beautified around the
Beck with white satin exquisitely embroid
ered with goid; this embroidery extends
in a V-shaped vest down the front. Around
the waist is a waistband of the black rib
bon velvet. The balloon sleeves are of the
Batin, studded with what looks like black
pearls, and ribbon velvet is run through
slashings in the satin and terminate in
sprightly four-looped bows.
The confection is delightful and abounds
in good ideas. With it co slippers of the
blue satin, and long glove 301 undressed
white suede stitched with white; they
reach the elbow and are worn in a thou
sand wrinkles from wrist to elbow, lalso
to pay particular attention to the
fact that tbis corsage is cut square in
front and V-shaped in the back, and the
latest style imperatively demands that this
V should be cut extremely low, thus neces
titating very low corsets for evening wear.
A correspondent in Paris while giving
an order to one of the roost distinguished
costumers there, saw an evening gown
intended for our new American Duchess.
It was a white satin, the skirt of which had
puffs of white silk gauze, between which
were more than thirty birds of paradise.
The skirt had a border of the heads of
these rare birds buried in rose leaves. It
is to be hoped that Consuelo will not be
Been by Queen Victoria when so attired, as
at a recent reception her Majesty saw a
fUrCountesa arrayed in crimson velvet
iie skirt of which were many birds of
paradise, and at once expressed dis
pleasure l.y remarking to her: "We
would think more highly of your character
did you not cover yourself with dead
birds?' Asa result, birds are not at ali
used in England for such purposes, but
B rage in Paris and Vienna. Speak
ing of Vienna reminds me that a visiting
costume there has been called the "Noel
dress." It is of rich crimson velvet,
trimmed with sable. On the jaunty coat
are rosettes of the fur, and a velvet toque
has a fur brim. It is completed by a muff,
which looks as though two fur cuffs had
been joined together. It is lined with
crimson satin.
Iv all gowns more vivid colors are seen
in combination. Among the favorite con
trasts are carmine rev with green, gold
Â»in blue, pansy withci%Â«ij. brown with
namois, nile proen with steel gray and
Lordeau with ff s .. llluc .
in Jans at;d V:.i, ria capes will soon be
things of the put to be had for a song
anywhere. As a ; ( . sUlt tne cloaks a^e of
marveioua elegauct, some have liniDgs of J
eiderdown, and princes 3 dresses are more
than ever in demand, some being made
entirely of fur, finished with a roll of sable
at the bottom and around the neck. How
ever, not only are these costumes ex
tremely expensive, but they weigh tre
mendously on account of the wide skirls,
so will not continue to be worn unless the
skirts diminish in width very rapidly.
They usually have epaulets composed of
pleated sable, and are only perfectly suc
cessful when made by an expert furrier.
Among the most unusual of evening
gowns are those bavins points of fur,
preferably sable or chinchilla. Vv'here the
fronts join the silk or brocade the seams
are outlined with precious stones. Such
toilet 9 are seldom seen, but deep bands
of chinchilla or sable border most of the
handsomest skirts. Many fronts are of
plain silk or satin in these princess gowns,
the train being of moire or the rarest of
brocades, and never have richer fabrics
oeen on the counters. Most artistic speci
mens of goldsmiths' work are seen on
many frocks, rare laces are in vogue, and
wonderful are the results produced with
precious stones and golden threads.
What do you think of an opera cloak
composed of black satin embroidered su
perbly in cut jet and lined with jonquil
satin? The bonnet worn with it consists
of a tiny jot crown. In the front arise two
large black butterfly wings, and I almost
forgot to tell you that the cloak has a huge
coliar of black ostrich feathers.
A pretty, plump matron received her
guests last week in a dress which admira
bly suited her. The plain skirt was of a
changeable velvet, preen, turning to odd
shades of rose. The corsage was likewise
absolutely plain, of a dark green brocade
covered with dull, pinkish flowers. It had
a square cut neck, not at all low. The
combination was perfect and the result
tres bien.
One of the most stylish of young women
wears a dress of a line mauve-colored
cloth, made absolutely plain, excepting
for an odd piece on the fight side, which
looks like a great rever, as it extends
from the neck to tho waist, being com
posed of petunia velvet covered with
guipure lace; the waistband and cuffs are
of the same. The wearer's throat is en
coded with a ribbon of petunia satin,
endimrin a bow with many ends.
A bright girl, noted for her tasteful cos
tumes, wore one evening at home a pretty
Dresden flowered skirt, a pink ground
covered with yellow roses and green
sprigs; the waist was of a green taffeta,
with a deep collar of old yellow lace; the
vest and stock were of yellow silk, covered
with the lace.
Absolutely absurd in most cases are the
huge bows of mousseline de soie or chiffon,
the ends trimmed with real lace. They
are tied under the chin, and for girls with
long slender throats the effect is very chic,
when in other ways the maiden fulfills the
demands of the bow. This is an expensive
fad, as a bow of either chiffon or mousse
line can only be worn two or three times.
Quite a number of articles were written
not long ago on the subject of how inap
propriately most women dressed for
church. Now, of course, a tailor gown or
a rich but quiet fabric is most appropriate,
but I must say that as far as I can 6ee the
women here cannot bo accused of over
dressing. There are some exceptions, how
ever, but few criticisms can be made on
this score. When peoDle wonder why
more of their neighbors and acquaintances
do not attend churcli I never do, for I am
surprised at the number who go regulariy

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
from headache for the remainder of
the day. Fancy holding Sunday-school
in a church not in a separate apartment
and before the last child has vanished ad
mitting the congregation. .Of course, the
pure air is exhausted, but what of that?
The furnaces or fires nave more coal piled
on, the windows, usually, are not made to
open and the doors are quickly closed and
then, in this particular case to which I am
alluding, the edifice is quickly filled.
There are some little ventilators here and
there, but a totally insufficient number.
As a result I have seen men doze, and
numbers of both sexes have complained
before me of headaches. It is all very tine
to say that we should not dwell on such
topics, that our minds should be fixed on
other things, but tvhen your head
is throbbing you begin to wonder
if you can punch a â¢ -hole in
a window, and while trying to overcome
this desire not Jong ago f fell into a par
tially unconscious state and dreamed of
carrying to church, in future, bags of fresh
air. Now the rector "may have preached
an instructive and interesting sermon, but
it was all lost on me, for matter triumphed
over mind. 1 have heard so many com
ments lately over this subject that I wish,
some attention would be paid to it, as most
of us are accustomed to fresh air and sun
shine, and will not relinquish them will
ingly for furnace heat and an atmosphere
laden with disease germs of every sort.
It is rather abrupt to leave this topic
and again speak of garments, but one of
our most beautiful young mothers across
the bay was extremely attractive at a
dance last week in a toilet of soft pearl
pray brocaded crepe, with sleeves of crim
sin velvet. Encircling the low-cut neck
was an odd puffy ruche of velvet, and
around the waist was a softly wrinkled
band of the same fabric, which tied at the
left side in bow with two long upstanding
loops, the ends of which reached the bot
tom of the skirt.
There is another way of making low
bodice. It is constructed with the point
in front, a narrow basque meeting it on
either side, while handsome lace or jet at
tached to net falls in graceful fril lings from
the neck, longer in the center; the sleeves
remain larire. Evening costumes which
are not trimmed around the bottom with
bands or roils of chinchilla or sable are
given the requisite touch in Paris by
means of a roll of silk, velvet or brocade,
which is very decorative and helps to make
the skirt hang well. In London the swell
est fabric for evening wear at the present
moment is white velvet, which must be
trimmed with gold passementerie or pearls
and rhinestone bands and ornaments, or
iridescent bands and Vandykes. - Ermine
or sable is also used. ' Such a gown costs a
small fortune, as also does a truly magnifi
cent cloak ordered in England by royalty.
It is described as a long seal mantle, with
bishop's sleeves made of the same fur. The
large shawl collar, front trimmings and
cuffs are of complete sable (royal) skins.
ThÂ« tails and little feet are left on as they
give a pretty effect to the trimming. The
lining is of white satin.
It is to be hoped that stout women wi 1
eschew white velvet bodices, even if they
have their skirts of it, as the corsages can
be of rich sitin, which does not give such
an effect of size.
In most of the latest trousseaux are two
or more tea jackets, delightful affairs com
posed of shot and changeable silks or
satins, much trimmed with all sorts of
dainty exquisite laces, and usually they
have vests of contrasting hues.
There is a revival in Paris of the once
most fashionable tapestry cloth it is be
ing combined with velvet, producing
gowns of exceptional charm, but then
they should be dreams considering that
the cloth is $25 per yard, although to be
sure it is very wide.
Slippers for evening wear are receiving
much, attention at present, many of the
leading dressmakers especially designing
them for their fair patron?.
I spoke last week of Miss Tyree's (or as
we know her better, Miss Tommy's) suc
cess in the "Home Secretary," and prom
ised to tell you something about her gowns
in this article, ana so I quote from Vogue.
Referring to her wardrobe Miss Tyree
said:
"I always dress a part with as much fitness to
the woman impersonated as I can. You see,
in the 'Home Secretary' I tried to wear just
what this society woman would, who had a bit
of (liable in her, and who would, you know,
affect outre costumes. For instance, such a
woman would never wear chiffons or clinging
materialsâ severe lines are for her appropriate."
In the flT6t act Miss Tyree wears a reception
toilet of a white silk ground with red and
yellow carnation scattered hero and there.
The skirt has a front p-nel, with t'ny double
tongues of scarlet ou^ming it. The bodice,
of white cloth, lias a yellow velvet front, with
exquisite Renaissance lace artistically arranged
over it, 'and the coat back, with its long
tails, is lined with the red. In front it forms
a sort of zouave effect, and the white cloth is
cut out and an applique pattern is done in red
and black. To complete this chic toilet is
a picture hat of white velvet topped with black
plumes and red and yellow orchids. Its liar-
Ing brim, perched so eoquettipiily on Miss Ty
ree's pretty head, is lined with black velvet,
and right at the crown, -so as to be against the
hair, is a steel ornament.
The style of gown is very dependent on
the tit, and yet many women expect their
dreesmafcera to fit them over old or ili
shapen corsets. If you cannot afford a
good, property made pair and a stylish
gown at the same time, first secure your
corsets, as no woman can obtain the de
sired result until your figure is properly
corseted. If you can pay to have your
corsets made to order by an expert French
woman do not hesitate, go to her direct;
but if you must count the dimes try and
see if you cannot be suited with a ready
made one, which you should have sent
direct to your dressmaker, as she v 111 tell
you if it is what you need, and if any
changes are necessary will nark where
the alterations are to be made, for once
equipped with a well-fitting corset a woman
can wear the simplest gown -with satisfac
tion and comfort. Stout women should
be careful not to let their corsets be too
visible; by this I mean that it is very well
to put them over their flannel snirts but
not over their silk ones, as the lower
edge uf the corset is then too distinct.
Many actresses even make this mistake,
and the result is bad.
I s-ee that puffed sleeves have been
successfully reproduced in marble by a
French sculptor named Verier, as he haa
made his figure of a woman reclining on
the marble bench at the base of the pedes
tal of the bust of Guy de Maupassant, quite
up to date, for her corsage 11 ts closely, and
the great puffed sleeves are saici to fall in
dc-corative puffs, the full skirt making
effective drapery, which Tails negligently
over the side of her couch. The puffed
sleeves are said to have given him an in
credible amount of trouble, but the result
is* so excellent that critics are saying that
his figure will probably not become
ridiculous, but always remain artistic and
presentable, with the change of fashion. As
:\ result a great many debates have been
in order as to whether or no the fashions
of to-day for women are not more sensible
and tasteful than formerly.
I understand that the H. H. wedding
wiil take place on the loth of next month
and will be a brilliant affair.
The Young Ladies' Orchestra is to be
given a benefit concert in the near future
which will not only be a source of keen
interest to music-lovers, but also to all
who have appreciated the noble charitable
spirit which has prompted these young
society girls to do so much for the benefit
of others, as they have given no less than
seven "chanty concerts."
This has been a dull week and as a result
there will be any number of affairs scram
bled into the two weeks preceding Ash
Wednesday. Marcella.
FOE MEN.
Mr. John Drew has been very wisely ad
vised by Kirn to make a study of the suits
worn by Mr. dOrsay in " The Artist's
Model." In the lirst act he wears a park
suit of a rough brown material. The
coat i 3 a frock, and fits like "a glove."
With it his tie is a puff Teck, and 1113 col
lar, which stands straight, is almost three j
inches in height. This excellent costume
is completed with patent-leather walking
boots, brown box-cloth spats, a silk hat
und white kid gloves with blacK stitching,
these being the latest style in gloves in
London.
1 notice that Him makes no remarks
about the white sputs Mr. d'Orsay some- j
times wears with this same suit. The |
effect is said to be "droll," causing some j
one to remark that "it made d'Orsav !
look as though he had porcelain insteps." j
The white spats are a result of hearing >
about the French President's freak, I pre- I
sume.
I recently noted in an article concerning
the son oi a millionaire the remark that
"his clothes were of course made by j
Poole." Well, lam sorry tor him if they
were, as "the great, original Poole" has j
been dead many years, and no tailor by
that name is now famous or especially
good in .London.
Very blue and equally pink bathrobes
are for the moment the most fashionable.
It is so extremely difficult nowadays to
have one's linen laundered in a satisfac
tory manner that even in New YorK many
have given up having attached collars, but
of course the attached cuff is a necessity
for any one pretending to underhand
what is what, and linen when correctly
laundered never has the slightest gloss, a
dull finish being demanded.
Men are included in many small informal
"at home" and tea invitations, and these
do not demand an after-call, but invita
tions to large receptions demand an after
call, which must be paid within a month
after the entertainment.
When a wife is in mourning and her
husband is not only her cards have a black
border, and, of course, if he is in mourn
ing he uses mourning-cards.
A man should never indulge in any
fanciful notepaper. Dead or ivory-white
paper is always correct, and may nave a
rough or cream-laid surface. All social
notes and letters must be sealed with
either a monogram or coat-armor. The
wax must be carefully selected with regard
to color.
A man wears a black satin tie at the
theater, at a small dinner, when calling
and at home, with his dress or Tuxedo
coat at dinner. A black patin one is buo
atituted when in mourning. A white tie
is aiwaya worn with a dress suit at any
large and formal entertainment such as a
ball, the opera, a wedding reception, a
wedding or a large dinner party.
This winter mackintoshes are unusually
well cut, and are made up in good colors
and mixtures. Browns are preferred.

A FASCINATING WOMAN
Bab Chats in an Interesting Way
of Her Visit to Yvette
Guilbert.
HOW SHE IMPRESSED HEE.
The Fair Singer Gives Her Opinion of
the Beauty of American
Women.
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â The very min
ute I saw the picture I said to myself, in
that confidential way in â which one does
talk to one's self, "I must see that woman !"
And by this I didn't mean simply seeing
her on the stage, or seeing her after the
fashion of reporters, but as one woman
sees another. The picture? Well, she was
standing in front of a mirror, witti her
face turned partly toward you, and draw
ing the laces of her stays. And she had
done it so correctly that my admiration
was hers, and mv curiosity to see her. per
sonally, was quire as great as Lom
broso says curiosity is developed in
a woman with fair hair and
dark eyes. (By the by, though, he
says this isn't a mean curiosity; it is an
intellectual one.) In the picture her stays
were drawn in properly at the waist line
and spread out broadly and beautifully
about the bust and hips. Said I, "The
woman who draws her laces in that fash
ion has brains." The average woman pulls
her laces up and down just as closely as
she can, so that neither bust nor hips have
an opportunity to develop; she can't
laugh with enjoyment, and her poor arms
have no opportunity to express them
selves. And Yvette Guilbert certainly
manages to express very much with those
long, slender arms and" wonderful hands
of ners.
Dumas, the master of the heart of wo
man and the art of the stage, said there
were only two things worth considering
in a play or a book, woman and love. Be
lieve me, Yvette Guilbert is â worth study
ing. It makes no difference whether she
speaks or not, and yet it does. For cen
turies poets have said there was a fascina
tion in the silence of the Sphinx. Take my
word for it there is more fascination
in the speech of woman, especially
when yon realize that her speech con
ceals her thoughts. Here is a woman,
not beautiful, as we reckon beauty, and
yet the greatest artiste in France has
thought it worth while to paint her,
while that artist who draws the designs,
the rinest ones, for the Sevres vases took
Yvette Guiibert as a model, and gave
thanks for the permission to picture her.
She belittles ordinary beauty. The pink
and white, the blue eyes, the small mouth,
the dimpled iigure with its 18-inch waist
becomes as notbipg beside thia woman,
whose ligure is natural, whose eyes are â
what color are they? I only know this
about themâ since they lirst looked on the
world, humanity has been their book, and
they, have read it well. Her hair is red, a
perfect red, with not a dash of crimson in
it; her skin is white; her mouth is large;
her teeth are exquisite, and in tsn minutes
speech with her that mouth assumes hun
dreds of curves that each mean something.
Sarah Bernhardt becomes nothing of a
riddle before Yvette Guilbert. She says
how kind the world has been to her. I
look at her, and she is Gavroche. The
poor little street boy, well acquainted with
the slang of the day, clever, sympathetic,
keen and yet willing, because sorneboay

Somebody, some reporter, wrote a story
which was said to tell of the love of Yvette
Guilbert's life.
Bab ! Women with eyes like hers don't
tell of their loves. They suffer them, they
live in them, and sometimes they die of
them. Somebody else, meaning to be
polite, and remembering her fondness for
the white gown and black sloves, compared
her to a bird. Never. Unless she was a
dove who sat on one of the trees in Para
dise and cooed and wondered as she heard
the serpent tempting Eve. She looks as if
she might carry out the theory of trans
migration â as if she had known the his
tory of every woman's heart since the
world began. And men see her and call
her chic, which she is, and call her pe
culiar, which she is; but it takes always
a won:an to discover what she reahy is â
the Sphinx of the nineteenth century.
I say to her, "What costume -do you
like?"
Inhere is a light in the eyes, those won
denul eyes, that suggests femininity and
its love for chiffons. ~ And she says, "I
like#a very quiet dress. I like a black
dres3, and one in which while I look well
I am not noticeable."
There is a toss of the head, a shrug of
the shoulders, a movement of the beau
tiful bands, and I realize that it is not
Gavroche. the gamin, up to all the argot
and all the tricks of the street, to whom
I am talking, but the grande dame.
"But for the evening?" The hands give
a kind of a whirl, as if they compassed all
the lilies in the world, and she answers:
"White before everything else. White in
beautiful clinging stuffs, and no jewels."
Then I remember what Balzac says about
colors. "Black apparently subdues, but it
has an inexpressible fascination, while
white, although it looks virein-like, is
powerful in its intensity to draw out."
With a woman's curiosity I ask another
question. "What do you consider a beau
tiful woman?"
She looked at me, and then .she seemed
to look far off in the distance before she
answered, "What is beauty in one climate
is not beauty in another. Ido not admire
the English women; they are too regular
and too lacking in expression. Your
American women come nearer the French
women than any other people, but then
you are a new race, and from you should
come the most beautiful women in the
world. And lime and time only will prove
whether you have them, although I have
seen many beautiful American women,
and I must say for them that they
dress elegantly and have that indefinable
something which we call 'chic' But a
beautiful woman to me and my people is
a woman of expression; a woman whose
eyes not only tell their story, but whose
body in its litheness is most artistic. No
fat â fat is not beautiful; no dimples
dimples are insipid ; but expression â that
is what makes a woman charming, and
that is what makes her fascinating to men.
I have been told that your American
men are generous â that they work,
work, work, and are satisfied if their
women are hapny. Ah! what superb
husbands they must make. What do I
love best to read? Old poetry. I like
some of the modern novelists, particularly
De Maupassant, because he wrote first
about this, then about that, was universal,
and an artist to his finger tips. I love
beautiful lingerie. How do you call it
here â underwear.' Ah! I can imagine a
lady wearing a plain gown, but I cannot
imagine a gentlewoman who did not wish
her underwear, so you call it, dainty and
exquisitely made and trimmed with lace
and ribbons."
1 hear it all. I hear the words, but be
fore everything else there comes the music
01 that Wonderful voice â I call it fine; I
can think of no other word for it. It has
strength, it is clear, ringing, distinct, and
there 13 never a note too high or too low.
Every syllable has its value, and I have
only heard one other woman whose French
compared with that of Yvette Guilbert,
and that was Sarah Bernhardt. Her work
well, you have heard enough about her
work, and yet I wish instead of teaching
her plantation naeiodies, so she may have
some English soi^ in her repertoire, that
sonifl one would make her understand the
meaning of the words, and once she did
that, neither you nor I need doubt her

A LIST OP ACQUAINTANCES.
Very Few Men Who Know by Name
. One Tiioti>an<l People.
A small party seated in the Manhattan
I Club night before last was discussing the
j question of acquaintance:?. One well
kuown lawyer ; said he knew as many
people as any man in the room, he did not
I care who he was. I asked if he could say
j how many, acquaintances he hadâ not
friends merely,, but persons known casu
ally and slightly." After thinking it over
he said "10,000."
"I bet $ijQ .to $5," said another of the
party, "that you cannot name 1000 per
sons of yourj acquaintance, and give vo'u
all night to do it." The bet was made,
and the lawyer began, a friend keeping
tally.
When, after two hour 3of hard thin King,
he had reached between 500 and (WO, he
was going very slow and straining terribly.
At midnight he was so far from the 1000
mark that the party broke up in disgust.
I doubt if there is a man in this country
who could write down the names of 1000
acquaintances at a moment's notice. I
don't believe there are five men in the
United States who are acquainted person
ally with 10,000 people. Dan Lamout>Secre
-1 tary of War, is said to know more faces than
any other man. He made a study of faces
when Mr. Cleveland's private secretary,
and became indispensable to the President.
It might be said that there are many poli-
I ticians who know more than 10,000 people
I personally, hut you can't rely upon a po
litical acquaintance. The politician has a
way of pretending to know every living
I man who has a vote. Dr. Chauncey M.
1 >epew probably has as wide an acquaint
ance as any man we know. Many men
remember faces without being able" to re
call names. That is not an acquaintance.
It will not do to say we have seen such
and such a man before somewhere, but
cannot recollect his name. â New YorK

"Something terrible to look at, isn't

Maybe she didn't actually mean exactly

her in just that way. Certainly that cor

DON'T you think it adds much to
the joy and interest of life to pay
a little attention to the senti
ment of things? I do. I thinÂ£ it
tinges our days with roseate
hues to be just a little sentimental.
What 1 have in mind particularly just
now are the flowers and stones for the
months of the year.
I'm sure you all Wk,c to know your birth
day stone and its meaning, likewise the
flower for your month, with its sentiment.
So I have just thought how pleasant it
would be to have published on the chil
dren's page of The Call the stones and
flowers for each month of the year.
Well, the flower for January is the pure,
delicate snowdrop, the sentiment of which
is consolation.
The bolly greets the red-breast
'Mid winter, drear and dark,
.And he snowdrop, wakened by his sons,
i'eeps tremblingly forth. Twambly.
The rich, beautiful garnet is the precious
stone for this first month of the year, and
the following little verse will enlighten
you as to its meaning:
l\y her who in this month is born
No gem save garnets should be worn.
They will insure her constancy,
True fnenilshiu anil fidelity.
How Denise and Tooriles Became Ac
quainted.
Many years ago (so many that the writ
er's little daughter, when told how many,
a=ked. "Mamma, are you a hundred years
old yet?") there lived in a pretty town on
the banks of the Hudson River, not many
miles from New York, a little girl namedâ
well, we will call her Denise. That was
not her real name, but someone who is
very closely related to her now bears it,
and so we will give it to her.
She haa neither brother nor sister and
was sometimes a little bit lonely, even
though . "-he had no end of pets, including
dogs, kittens, rabbits, birds and a beauti
ful big goat named "Tan" to drive about
in a little carriage. Tan loved her dearly,
and when not harnessed to his carriage
would follow her about like her big New
foundland doe, "Sailor." No matter
where Denise went, the goat "was sure to
go," until people used to laugh and say,
"Here come Tan and Denise," instead of
"â Denisu and Tan."
The little girl loved her pets as dearly as
they loved her, but the dream and desire
of her life was to have a dear little pony to
ride and 'Irive, andâ last, but by no means
least â to love, for her fondness for horses
amounted to a passion, and with them she
Was absolutely fearless. They, in turn,
seemed to love and comprehend her to a
wonderful degree, responding to her
voice and submitting to her caresses when
they were often fractious and quite unruly
With others.
- it seemed a very gratifying ending to
the long-cherished * wish, when, on her
tenth birthday, one bright October morn-
Ing, her father said to her: "Many happy
returns of the day. my pet! Run to
mamma and ask her to dress you for a
walk. I've a surprise at the end of it, for
both you and her."'
"Another surprise!" exclaimed Denise.
"Why, I thought L'd seen all the surprises
before breakfast!"
'â¢No, <l<;ir; I've another. It's a little
thing, and if you don't like it you may tell
it to just run away, as you've no place for
it."
"Now, whatever can it be?" thought
Denise as she hurried upstairs, and, burst
ing into mamma's room, cried, "Oh,
mamma, dress me quickly, ulease; for
papa has a walk at the end of a surprise â
and you're not to know a thing about it,
either!"
Never were curls made tidy so quickly,
or clothes scrabbled on in such a hurry.
Before papa nad time to rind hat, gloves]
or cane, a very excited little pirl stood
before him crying: "If you don't start
quickly, I just know my head will fly off
like a bottle of soda-water that's all fizz |"
About thirty minutes' walk along the
shore of the beautiful river, whose waters
Beerne'l to dance and sparkle in sympathy
with Denise as she pranced and skipped
along, brought them to the village, where
] -a pa turned down a side street which led to
a livery and boarding stable. Denises
heart began to beat so loudly that she felt
sure it could be heard, and her brown eyes
to sparkle as though some one had dropped
a lit'.le diamond into each.
"Oh, me!" she whispered to herself. "I
i'ust know it's a new carriage and set of
larnesa for Tan; and papa has asked Mr.
Andrews to get it for me, because he heard
me Â«ay that the old ones were getting very
eliabby for such a handsome goat."
Tan. by the way, was an unusually large
Bpecimen of his Kind, measuring" quite
thirty-two inches at the shoulders, and
buastmg a head and pair of horna that
were the admiration of all who saw them.
He was named Tan because of the color
of his hair, which was a bright tan and
shone like satin when well brushed by
Timothy, the coachman. So the prospect
of a new harness and carriage for Tan was
quite enough to 6et Denises heart danc
ing.
At last the stable was reached, and the
first thing her eyes fell upon was a beauti
ful little phaeton with bright yellow
wheels, and a shining top that could be
raised and lowered, "just like big folks's."
In the bottom, for her feet to rest upon,
was a little yellow Angora-wool rug, to
match the color of the wheels. On the
seat wa? a soft, white wool blanket, bound
with yellow silk, and in one corner was
fastened a big blanket-pin that was cer
tainly intended to pin that blanket snugly
around something's throat. Over the
shining dashboard was folded a handsome
fur robe, made of leopard's skin, and
trimmed all round the edges with wildcat's
fur.
The leopard's head looked very fierce as
it stared at Denise with big glass eyes, but
I hardly think that a live leopard would
have made much impression upon her, so
soeechiess and dumb this fascinating sight
had turned her. But when she went closer
and took out the exquisite little whip
which stood in the whip-socket, and read
her own initials on the gold band which
held the dainty ivory handle to the snake
wood stick, her joy began to pour forth in
a torrent of words which quite drowned
the remark of old Timothy, who stood by,
enjoying it as if the whole thing had been
planned for one of his own little Timothys,
at home.
â¢"Whist, darlintl while I roon and fetch
Up the little hoorse that tits insoide." said
he, as he disappeared through a side door.
Presently Denise'sears heard a patter, pat-
"TAV'AND DENISE.
ter! patter, patter! Looking behind her
she beheld the dearest, darlingest littie j
pony that any one ever saw! He was black j
as a crow from the tip of his saucy little !
nose to the end of the long silky tail that i
dragged on theground behind him, except- !
ing one little white moon just back of his |
right eye, which seemed to have been put i
there on purpose to kiss, it was soft and
round.
For a moment Denise did not move nor
speak, and then, with a cry of delight
which amply repaid her father for his long
weeks of searching and planning for his
perfect little turnout, she flung her arms
around the pony's neck and laughed and
cried and kissed, until the poor little fellow
was quite bewildered, and did not know
whether his new mistress was one to be de
sired or avoided.
Presently, however, he decided that it
was all right, and, with a happy little neigh,
he thrust his soft nose into her hands,
pressed his face close to hers, searched her
pockets for sugar and tried to say as
plainly as a horse could :
"This is my new little mistres?, and as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
she seems to love me already I'm going to
show her how much I can love her."
Then Timothy produced the harness
that fitted the "little hoorse" which "fitted
insoide," and the pony was harnessed to
the phaeton that had been made to his
measure.
No words can express the rapture of that
drive. To hold the pretty reins and feel
the prompt response given by the well
trained little animal; to watch His pranks
and antics as he dashed along, apparently
trying to show how graceful he could be in
order to convince his new mistress that he
left nothing to be desiredâ it really seemed
too good to be true, and Denise feared it
might all be a dream from which she
would waken ana find that pony and all
had vanished.
The little feet fairly new over the ground,
and the drive home was quite the shortest
she had ever known.
Mamma stood on the piazza, watching
| for the surprise to come, and when she saw
the handsome pony and the carriage with
her husband and her own little daughter
' sitting in it come dashing up the driveway,
she was as much pleased as mothers usu
ally are when they know that their little
girls' dearest wishes are realized.
The entire household had to be sum-
I moned to see and admire this pony, which
was surely more wonderful than any pony
I that had ever lived; and the charming
I little fellow was talked to and caressed and
I petted and fed witn apples and sugar until
; he was in a very fair way to be made ill.
'And now," said Denise, "what shall
we name him, mamma?"
"You must name him yourself, darling,"
answered mamma, "for he is all your very
| own, to love and care for."
"Well," said Denise, in a tone which
settled the matter beyond all question.
"i in noins to call him "Ned 'foodies'; Ned
because he is as olack as old darky Ned
who comes for the asties, and Toodies be
cause he is so little and round and roly
poly."
So "Ned Toodies" was the name given
to the dear little pony, who thenceforth
figured very conspicuously in the life and
pranks of his mistress, and caused no end
of jealousy among the other pets.
At last Denise was persuaded to let Ned
be led away to his new quarters, Timothy
exclaiming as he marched off with his
small charge in tow: "Faith! howiveram
1 to clane sooch a schrap of a thing as
this? I'll have to be hoontin' up a big
box to sthand him on !"
And sure enough, that was exactly what
he had to do, and it took but a short time
for the intelligent little animal to learn
just what the box was for. As soon as his
stall door was opened he would march out,
get uron the box, stand very still while
he was curried, and ttien lift lirst one foot
and then the other to have it cleaned and
washed.
Nothing gave Timothy greater satisfac
tion than to brush the beautiful coat until
it shone lite moleskin, and to comb the
silky maue and tail until each particular
hair seemed to stand out for very pride.
Ned s.)on grew to love his little mistress
very dearly, and to answer with a loud
neigh the queer, piping whistle by which
she aiways called him.
No pen can describe the delightful
drives of the charming autumn days.
Jack Frost seemed particularly gracious
that year, and painted the trees more
gorgeously than ever before.
At least it seemed so to Denise; but
perhaps seeing it all from her littie car
riage as she drove along in the golden
sunshine singing to Ned the little song ol
which he never seemed to tire gave an
added charm to everything.
This song was all about a "poor little
robin" whose name was "Toodle-de-too,"
and Ned seemed to think that it had been
composed especially for him, and would
invariably go very slowly as soon as Denise
began to sing it, and would turn back one
ear, as though to hear better.
When the song ended he would give a
funny little jump of approval, and then
trot on again.
And so the happy autumn days sped by,
and Denise felt that there never had been
| so happy an introduction before as that
j which made her acquainted with Ned
! Toodles.

A Mouse Story.
One bright moonlight night Mrs. Burns
I said to her two little boys, 'I'ome, boys,
I get your greatcoats and warm caps on
and you and I will go down to the Point
and see the moonlight on the water."
"Oh! goody, goody," shouted the
DONALD THINKS HE HAS A HARD TIME.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.}
youngsters as they rushed to the maid
and were hurried into their coats. They
were so delighted to think they were going
to have a walk with their Hear mamma,
and they did so love to see the lisrht of the
moon shimmering over the water â and
then the wonderful phosphorescent lights,
which were so strange and mysterious, in
terested them still more. "When they
came, all ready, to their mother's room
theytound she had put on her large soft
black straw hat, which was trimmed with
delicate pink roses and lined with soft
silk. Ihe little boys liked her to wear
that hat and always cailed her their
picture mamma' when she had it on.
After wrapping a warm shawl around
her shoulders they were ready to start.
Just as they were going to open the door
something stuck mamma's head. She
thought one of her hatpins was out of
place, so she put ud her hand and rear
ranged it. Again something pulled her
hair and scratched her head; again she
tried to get the pins in properly. Now
they could surely start, so they opened the
<loor and were just going to step out when
those naughty pins pulled mamma's hair
once more, so hard this time that she took
out both pins and gently lifted her hat
from her head, when, what do you sup
pose ran down the side of her head, across
her ear, down, clown to the floor, as fast aB
its little legs could carry it? Why, a tiny
irray mouse. How the little "boys did
..?i hl and . how their mother did scream!
"How did it get there, mamma, and
what was it doing? Did it hurt you
much? Did its tiny feet tickle your ear?"
were a few of the questions which Mrs.
Burns had to answer.
After examining her hat she told the
little fellows that Mrs. Mouse had been
ooking around fcr a soft nest in which to
keep her baby mice, and finding that her
hat, which had been hanging up in a dark
closet for four or five days, had such a
soft lining she decided to turn it into a
dainty bed for the precious little ones, and
probably when mamma had taken the hat
down and placed it on her head the little
mouse had either been asleep or too fright
ened to move, gaining courage only
through desperation when she found her
self an actual prisoner.
Well, after all this excitement, it was
quite late, but as the night was still so
clear and bright, the little boys had their
walk, and stood for some time on the point
watching the beautiful moon sailing so
slowly through the sky, and its reflection
in the waters of the bay at their feet.
'THE LITTLE FEET FAIRLY FLKW OVER THE GROUND, AND THE DRIVE
HOME WAS THE SHORTEST SHE HAD EVER KNOWK."
Although awed by the grandeur and sub
limity of the scene, every once in a while
they would have to give vent to a peal of
laughter, as they thought of the funny
little Mrs. Mouse, who, in mamma's hat,
did build her tiny house.
DONALD SERIES JNO. XII.
For Tiny Boys.
Donald lived in a country town where
he had beautiful grounds in which t^> play.
He had so much fun digging worms for
his chickens, pulling up weeds in his little
garden, picking violets for his mother,
and oh, lots of other things.
He had some rabbits in a hutch which
were a constant source of pleasure and of
trouble too, when he foigot to feed them.
Then there was Paul Pry, the pussy, and
Rags, the doggy. Donald and these two
passed many a merry hour in racing up
and down the broad carriage way or in
lying on the soft grass under the leafy fig
trees.
But there came a day when the whole
family moved to a big city, into a flat
without any yard at all, and what a mis
erable little Donald lived in that flat.
By and by he commenced to droop and
get pale, then the doctor said he must go
out on the sidewalk and play with the
other little boys. So pretty soon there
was again a hungry, bright, happy-faced
urchin in the house, full of funny stories
about Robbie and Joey, Willie and dear
little black-eyed Georgia, and all the rest
of the fellows he played with.
Alas! alas! After a year of so many
playmates and so much fun, Donald's napa
moved to a house with a large yard, and
the poor young chap has no one to play
with only just "Rags."
He thinks he has a hard time, and says:
"I think my folks act rather queer about
me. When I was used to large grounds,
they moved to a house without any yard
at all. Then when I enjoyed playing on
the sidewalk so much, and had such lots
of fun with my friends, ana could knock
out all the saucy kids, they moved again
to a house with a yard where I have to
play all alone.
"It's a pity of a feller anyhow."
Stories for Little Folks.
"Uncle Jerry's Platform," and other
stories, by Gillie Carev, make up a pretty
little volume for children. "Uncle Jerry's
Platform" is a plantation story, told in
iieirro dialect. Jerry has witnessed the
dread effects of intemperance in his mas
ter's household, and signalizes his enfran
chisement by declaring for the "dry j
ticket." The other contents are "Pop,"
the tale of a colored boy's noble lile
sacrifice, and "A Daughter of the Revolu
tion," a story of love and valor in Vir
ginia during the eventful year of 1781.
The book would make an excellent holi
da3' or birthday pift for a young boy or

And boats go a-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with "their own misty

And up, up and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
The fairies go winging!
Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny

â¢ Bright Saying*.
The other nicrning Donald was told to
button his shoes. After thinking for a
little he answered: "Mamma, it does not
agree with my system to button shoes."
A little boy about '1 years old was play
ing beside his papa in the sitting-room
while his mamma was engaged in some
household duty upstairs. Suddenly the
little hoy left his papa's side, and, going to
the foot of the stairs in the hall, called
"Papa, papa."
"What's the matter, little man? here's
papa," answered his father from the sit
! ting-room.
But the baby boy paid no attention and
kept on calling up the stairs. Finally, be
coming angry at his papa's answering each
call, he rushed to his side and, stamp
in;.- his Jittle foot, exclaimed, "I'm not
calling you; I'm calling Mrs. Papa."

GREAT BRITAIN ON THE LAKES.
The Agreement Faithfully Kept by the
United States.
Seventy-eight years ago this country and
Great Britain made an agreement limiting
the naval force each of them should main
tain in the great lakes. That agreement,
which has been kept faithfully by the
United States, has been violated grossly in
spirit by the Dominion authorities.
For instance, Canada has tbree vessels
| which are actually gunboats, but which
i nominally belong to the Canadian Fish
Commission, and in times of peace are used
to overhaul American vessels suspected of
lishinc in Canadian waters. They are steel
vessels with ram bows, and are equipped
witli modern six-pounder high-power i;uns.
These vessels, which have crews drilled
in the use of guns, are much of the time
in Georgian Bay. They are kept there so
that in the event of hostilities they could
command Lakes Huron, Michigan and
Superior without having to pass any fort
which might be constructed on the Detroit
River.
If war were to break out these naval
vessels would be in Lake Michigan within
forty-eight hours, and would proceed to
shell or put to ransom every city on it.
These ships have guns which can throw
shells three or four miles. Chicago has no
guns. The city would be given the option
of being burned down and having the
water cribs destroyed or of paying a ran
som of thirty or forty millions. The citi
zens would choose the latter, and thus
help the Canadians defray their military
expenses. For a long time, . too,
the Dominion Government has made
arrangements for the conversion of the
large fleet of Canadian iron and steel
steam freight boats into war vessels. They
are constructed with portholes and made
with decks strong enouuh to bear the
weight of gun platforms and guns. These
platforms and guns are all in readiness,
and it would take a very short time to put
these propellers in readiness to make raids
on American pons. The Canadians have
accumulated great quantities of ammu
nition and guns, and have men who are
skilled in the use of the latter.
All this has been going on for years and
this (Jovernment has been apathetic and
hopelessly remiss. The result is that the
lake coasts and cities are utterly defense
less, while the Canadian ones are safe.
There must be a sudden change of policy.
Congress must appropriate at once for
guns, which must be stored at convenient
points. It must build "rishboats" to look
after Canadian poachers. American pro
pellers must be modified and strengthened
so that they can be used for offensive arid
defensive puxpoges.^-Cbicago Tribune,
DAVID STARR JORDAN'S MISSING LINK
Dr. David Starr Jordan of Stanford Uni
versity has been varying his scientihc
studies of the origin of species lately by
experiments with monkeys with a view to
shedding light upon the problem of the
missing link. He has several pets of the
monkey tribe and among them is one
which, by reason of its display . of intelli
cence, has become his especial favorite.
The doctor has also a large St. Bernard
dog, which he keeps about his home. The
monkey and the dog get on well together
and hence Dr. Jordan often ties his pets
together in order that the former may be
protected and not get lost. The St. Ber
nard has one pleasure which he greatly

enjoys and that is to follow the family car
riage to the railway station.
"Well, last Sunday alternoon the coach
man started off with the carriage to the
station. The two pets were tied together
as usual, but the dog, in his eagerness to
follow, forgot the fact and bounded after
the carriage, dragging the poor monkey
behind him down the dusty road at a rate
of speed which threw him "off his feet and
rolled him over and over in the dust io the
most ridiculous way. At last one of the
students saw the monkey's plight and,
stopping the dog, ran off for Dr. Jordan
and brought him to the scene. Up to this
time the genial doctor and the monkey
had been on the best of terms, but now
the bedraggled ape regarded him as the
author ot his misfortunes, and would
not look at him, or follow him,
or allow himself to be taken
home. Dr. Jordan was nonplused to know
what to do with his monkey, until one of

the college boys happened along on his
bicycle, and seeing the doctor's dilemma,
offered to let the monkey ride home on

made to comprehend the idea of a bicycle '
ride he became mollified at once and |
perched upon the seat, where he sat in j
great state and hiirh glee while the doctor ;
and the student, wheeled him home.
Dr. Jordan is said to be of the opinion i
from the incident that a valuable contri- â¢
bution has been added to the cause of
science, and that the problem of the miss- j

toward solution.
THE AntlCAff PAREOT.
Some Idiosyncrasies of a Favorite
Bird.
Our parrot was the present of a kind
friend in the summer of 1877, having been
brought from Africa only a few months
previously. Her plumage is the same in
color as were her predecessors. She was,
when she first came, evidently a young
bird, and has grown since we have had her.
In spite of her eighteen years there is no
si<;n of age about her; she sings, dances,
climbs and whistles with all the vigor of
youth, and thousrh perhaps smaller in j-ize
than the other two birds, is quite as noisy
In many ways she is, however, different
from them, being, lor instance, much more
shy in the presence of strangers, before
whom .she will very rarely talk at all, and
is more curious in her habits, taking great
fancies to some people and decided dislikes
to others.
She has an unpleasant habit of scrae
timea wishing visitors good-by when she
does not approve of them. She also, if
she cannot get what she wants, gives
angry whacks and double knocks upon the
tin floor of her cage. Nothing appears to
delight her more than mischief. She posi
tively revels in it, and to get hold of any
thing she ought not to have is unmixed
joy. Evidently the bird has been at some
time very cruelly treated. For many
months she was territied at the sight of a
man or boy, and for years a brocmstick
was an object of horror* to her. Since get
ting over this fear she hassliown a decided
liking for the sweep and the coalman, and
the hitter has left the house with the bird
wishing him pleasantly good-by and af
fectionately requesting him to "kiss her,
which gives rise to the question whether
she may have had in her African past a
kind negro friend. Any one who has ever
had opportunities of studying the parrot
tribe must have been struck with their
extraordinary gift of memory, so long ago
observed by Plutarch.â Chambers' Journal.

May Be It's True.
The Grand Duke Alexis was at Kiel. He
is a full Knssiaft admiral now, and the
head of the Russian navy. He was a fre
quent visitor to the Americans, and, like
all other notables, talked with the utmost
frankness to our officers.
One day, watching the Columbia as she
rode tiie waves as lightly and with the
easy gniee of a blue-wing teal, the Grand
Duke said to a captain: "I'm L r ia<i you
Americans are rebuilding your fleet. Do
you know what most impressed me when
I visited your country? Let me tell you.
The iirst thing was your wonderful Na
tional wealth ; the second, the absolutely
inadequate means at your disposal for
National defense. You were like a
drunken man with pockets full of money
and two or three hungry ruffians on the
dark side of the street waiting a chance to
attack him."
"Why. <io you mean to say â " began the
somewhat startled captain, when the
Russian put his hand on the other arm
and said : "Twice in my career i have
heard the project of capturing one or two
of your great cities ami holding them for
ransom deliberately discussed by officers
of European fleets whose countries had
hard work to make both ends meet.
And they meant it, too. I once made
a sensation when, after listening to a con
versation of this kind, in which the officers
of four different fleets took part, I said;
'Gentlemen, the United States and Russia

ALAMEDA'S CANAL
RIGHT OF WAY
Litigation That Can Be
Made to Delay Fur
ther Dredging.
COHEN ESTATE CLAIMS.
Declaration That Land Con
demned Twenty Years Ago
Was Not Paid For.
THE RAILROAD POSSESSIONS.
A Freight Yard That the Govern
ment Dredger Would Have to
Cut Through.
An obstacle in the way of the Alameda
tidal canal's completion will be the litiga
tion that is sure to result when the pres
ent means of railroad delay are exhausted.
When Congress finally makes the ap
propriation that is needed for the work,
and when the Government engineers con
clude that harbor improvements more sat
isfactory to the railroad do not require all
the money appropriated, the canal project
will be taken from its place on the map
and will be transferred to the courts.
The Southern Pacific Company has a
right of way across the land just to the
THE ALAMEDA CANAL AT THE POINT JUST BELOW THE LAND-LOCKED DRAWBRIDGE
[Sketched by a" Call staff artist. ]
eastward of the present extremity of the
canal and has established a sort of freight
yard tnere. That can be made the suDject
of litigation for years, perhaps, when the
railroad company cannot prevent the open
ing of the waterway, and there is cer
tainty of a prolonged court contest arising
from another source.
Twenty years ago the right of way for
the tidal canal was established. A "strip
of land belonging to the Cohen Tract was
condemned for the purpose, the Govern
ment paying about $2700 for it. This strip
has not yet been cut away.
The money for the land was paid by the
Government to the court, as is stated, and
was then turned over to the Alameda
County Clerk. It was handed down from
one County Clerk to another until about
ten years ago, when it disappeared. No
demand for the money was ever made by
the Cohens, and the actual payment for
the right of way was never made.
Thai is the story, at any rate, according
to the statements made by men prom
inently interested in the matter, though
the complication is something that may
long trouble the courts.
An appeal by the Cohens concerning the
right of way has long been pending in the
courts, if not stricken from the docket
years ago. The matter has been ignored by
the Federal officials.
One point in the appeal is that the land
was condemned as the property of A. A.
Cohen, while in reality the title was held
by Emily G. Cohen, Mr. Cohen's wife.
It is the general understanding among
the people across the bay that the lack of
Federal appropriations has been the only
cause of delay in the canal construction;
but immense amounts of money have
been used in the work of improving Oak
land harbor, and only a small proportion
of the recent appropriations would have
been required to do the dredging.
All the improvements during the late
years have been in other portions of the
harbor, and, as has been already shown,
the work has been greatly to the advantage
of the Southern Pacific Company without
greatly improving the conditions of the
harbor for general navigation. Much of
the dredging done has given the railroad
company an opportunity to build up land
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896.
in places where it controlled the frontage,
as well as to make a solid roadway along
the entire line of the narrow-gauge trestle.
The company has obtained large tracts
of land along the line of the canal, and it
is expected that when other moans of de
lay are exhausted a direct fight in the
courts will be made.
The Cohen dispute has been allowed by
the Federal officials to remain unsettled,
and if the Government officials ever get
ready to resume the dredging operations
they will be stopped by injunction, and
the slow legal process will have to be taken
uj> anew.
Oakland and Alameda want the canal,
for both commercial and sanitary protec
tion. Candidates for Congress boom the
project, and the appropriations they get
for "harbor appropriations" after election
are used where they will do the most
goodâ to the railroad. Health officers
urge the value of a free and open water
way, but nobody in authority pays any at
tention to them.
Engineers declare that money is being
wasted in dredging out portions of Oak
land's harbor when there is no means of
keeping the harbor scoured out so that it
will not fill up again. They say that the
first thine for the Government to do is to
open the canal, but they also say that the
railroad company has the power to keep
that work from being done for many a
year to come.
THE PEDDLER'S CALLING.
ItÂ« Antiquity and Universality Has
Been Obncured.
The antiquity and universality of the
peddler's calling has been obscured by a
name given him in days when that calling
had lost much of its importance, a name
whose etymology, though still uncertain
unduly specifies or belittles it. Modern
philology dismisses with a smile Johnson's
explanation of a contraction from "petty
dealers," or the more picturesque deriva
tion from pied pouldrenx, and observes
that the word came probably with Danes
or Norsemen into England, and has its
origin in the ped or panier in which fish
were brought to market in Norfolk, while
the peddir(peddler) of Lowland Scotch is
equally of Scandinavian origin. Peddar
I (spelled peoddare) is found in the general
J sense uf a small hawker in the Ancren
Riwle, that is. before 1237; and peddler, or
pedlar, is probably formed from peddle, an
i unrecorded diminutive of ped.
But the point to observe is that all these
derivations, right or wronp, either unduly
narrow his calling or emphasize its hard
ship and insignificance. He is dowered
I with a name that unfairly depreciates him
I at the outset.
Nor has the historian been more kind to
him; as historian, indeed, it was generally
| out of his power. History has not been
slow to recognize the importance of trade
in the development of nations, and to
; show how the peaceful operations of com
j merce are often the precursors of military
conquest or at least of political dominion.
But history does not go back far enough.
When the historian speaks of trade he
i conceives it on a large scale, as an affair of
j ships and caravans, and neglects its hum
ble origin in the periodic fair and the itin
erant peddler. â Macmillan's Magazine.

WILL SELL RAW BORAX
"King" Frank M. Smith Decides
Not to Build a Refinery
in England.
CAPITALISTS ALL FIGHT SHY.
Attorney Chickering Talks of a Com
bine to Control the World's
Raw Product.
William H. Checkering, attorney for
Frank M. Smith, the "Borax King," re
turned from Europe yesterday, where he
has been during the past four months
looking after the interests of his client.
The attorney went abroad last Septem
ber with the intention, as understood at
that time, of forming an English stock
company to handle the California product.
The "Borax King" had an idea that he
could break tho gigantic trust in London
if one or two large refineries were estab
lished on the island, bo his legal adviser
was sent ahead to pave the way.
English capital did not take kindly to
the proposition, but offered to purchase
such quantities of raw borax as would ad
mit of a handsome profit to the producer.
TV. H. Chickering.
Mr. Smith was perforce satisfied with the
arrangement, and, according to his attor
ney, it is greatly to his advantage to sell
the raw material.
"For months," said Mr. Chickering yes
terday, "Mr. Smith has had in contempla
tion the organization of an English com
pany to handle the raw material as
shipped from this State. It was intended
to build one big refinery near Liverpool
This would have enabled him to dispose
of the refined article throughout Europe
"In company with Mr. Smith I made a
thorough investigation of the borax market
in Europe, and became satisfied that it
would be better to sell the raw material if
purchasers at good prices could be ob
tained. This was an easy matter Mr
Smith securing contracts for 6COO tons to
be delivered during the current year
W hat he will do in the future in the matter
of forming a stock company is something I
am not at liberty to upeak about. Of
course, he is not seeking to break the
trust, but simply wants a new market for
the refined article.
"The Pacitic Coast Borax Company has
made satisfactory rates on ail the raw
material for which they rind a European
market. There is some talk of pooling the
borax output of the world, and if this can
be done, the producers will be practically
masters of the situation. "We expect the
scheme to be consummated within a few
weeks.
''There is absolutely no truth in the
statement that Mr. Smith's trip to Eng
land has any connection whatever with
his railroad enterprises. His visit was
solely in the interest of the borax industry,
and I can state positively that railroads
were not even mentioned to those with
whom he had business.
''Mr. Smith is now touring France. He
has not sold any borax stocks, and 6O far
as I know has no intention of doing so."
HILL AS AN OEATOE.
An Occasion When the New York Sena*
tor Was Aroused.
The New York Senator is said to be a
cold man, with no passion. He does not
chew, nor smoke, nor drink, nor has he
ever developed any liking for cards.
Theorists are fond of propounding it as a
maxim that a man with a bloodless face,
like Hill's, can never be aroused to enthus
iasm. Those who saw him on Friday know
better. He was a picture of the fiery ora
tor and the aroused iion at once. He ges
ticulated, perspired, and thundered. He
paced this way and that, to and fro, with
every nerve strained and his voice pitched
to its highest key. He is not fluently given
in the way of speech. Words do not come
to him with the rapidity of thought, to be
poured out in a torrent of fiery lava, as
Mr. Mills does it. He does not utter his
sarcasms with a rigid face as Mr. Vest is in
the habit of doing. He resembles a bub
bling caldron which burns the fingers of
any one who touches it. He is relentless in
his bitterness. The more he is stirred the
hotter he grows.
His sentences are often pressed out by
BORAX KING SMITH.
I main strength. Words vrill not come fast
I enough, or they are not strong enough,
I and then he nets out his meaning. He
I forma his hands into claws and squeezes
i his elbows into his sides, leaning far for-
I ward, with an expression on his pale face
of bitterness or hate. Sometimes his pos
turing expresses triumph, sometimes the
mockery of humility; again he metamor
phoses himself into a panther ready to
pounce upon and tear to pieces a proposi
tion. As often he is the incarnation of a
sneer. The most dangerous man on the
i Democratic side, because of his fearless
j ness and unscrupulous disregard of Sen
; ate ethics, the Republicans stand in awe
i of him as of no other man on his side. He
! is the match of any one on the floor in wit
or sarcasm ; he has sounded to the depth
every proposition on which he speaks; he
is a thorough master of his subject, and he
is altogether the most dangerous man in
the Senate when aroused. â Washington

The Managers.
Managers are an ill-used race; they have
a bad name which they do not always de
serve. Considering all things, it la small
wonder that their tempers are occasionally
short; the wonder rather is that they are
as good fellows as they are. I remember,
in my salad days, asking an actress of
some experience what sort of folk man
agers were to deal with. "My dear," she
said, impressively, "they're angels if
you're making money for them, and
they're the very devil if you aren't." How
ever this may be, they certainly are not, as
is so often represented, impervious to or
jealous of rising talent. Like the equally
maligned race of publishers and editors,
they are quite awake to the value of a good
thing when they find it. So many people
dabble with the stage now-a-days, with'no
intention of taking it up eeriously, that no
wonder managers are apt to be skeptical of
genius in the bud.âMacmiilac's Maga
zine.
It is claimed that a man standing at
one end of the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado shouted the name "Bob," which was
distinctly audible at the further end a
distance of eighteen miles.

NA.VIG ABLE balloons operated by
electrical motors are a success
iand in the time of emergency
would become vastly more so,
says a writer in the Fittsnurg
Dispatch. As far back as ISB4 two French
army officers showed what could be done
in this respect, steering a big balloon
around freely and making five and a half
miles in twenty-three minutes. Such bal
loons as this could be admirably operated
and could drop explosives or suffocating
icais at will upon any ship. Recent
trials in Austria have shown that it is well
nigh if not altogether Impossible to train
guns up into the air and hit a balloon,
even if it be "stationary." Balloons
steered around by electric motor can go
out boldly to sea and a* freely regain the
Bhore. Half a dozen of them would be
worth untold millions, but the very finest
could be had for $100,000 apiece, fully

to ironclad a locomotive and car, and run i
them over a track, but it would be new to
adapt the liirht a;:d simple trolk-y to a sys
tem of movable patrol forts, each covering '
miles of coast, and each equipped
with as heavy a gun as could be mounted
on a big trirk of broad gauge. Dynamite
shells can from such a trolley fort
at any point along twenty miles of i
the v i- j 1.-eing located midway.
Ail the machinery for tiring dirigible tor- .
es could also be handled comfortably
on such a trolley fort. The recoil even of
rtillery is easily provided for. If the
road were shorter very weighty pieces of
on I . nance could be rucvi-d tbus up and
li-'wn a mile or two of earthworks or ma-
Bonry.
KUHBKB OF WORDS IX USE.
Those in General Use Are Few, but Some
Men Command Many Thousands.
It is generally recognized that the num
ber of words which we commonly use in
our daily lives is comparatively small, per
haps not more than 2000 or 3000 words,
but instances of individuals who are ac
quainted with and can use larger vocabu
laries are not unusual. Some stenographers
have declared that they have memorized
and have instant use of as many as 5000 or
word signs, while others in special
work or research have acquired larger vo
cabularies.
Dr. Eugene Murray-Aaron, in his enter
taining "Butterfly Hunters," has brought
together an interesting collection of facts
in this regard. The volume is not one
that takes particular note of language,
but ia one of adventure in the Antilles.
The doctor, who has charge of a party of
boy naturalists, gives to them much infor
mation on a very wide range of topics, in
formation which will, much of it, be new
to the old as well as young.
"It has been estimated," says the doc
tor, in instructing the boys, "that Victor
Hugo remembered and used accurately
over 8000 worda in his ordinary work as a
writer; Cnvier, the French naturalist, and
Louis A.gassiz, the Swiss zoologist, could
promptly give the names, according to
careful estimates, of over 5000 animals, in
addition to the ordinary words they knew
perfectly. It has been said of Dr. Asa
(iray, the great botanist of Harvard, that
be knew quite 8000 plants by name and at
Bight.
"But by far the most remarkably trained
memory with which I have had acquaint
ance was that of Dr. Joseph Lefuy, for
many years, and until hi.s death, president
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Pniladelphia. Dr. Leidy was not only a
foremost geologist and mammalogist,
having hundreds upon hundreds of the
terms of these sciences upon his tongue's
end, but he was a very good student of
birds, reptiles, fishe3, insects and lesser
thing?, and remarkably ready in rernem
berintr where their different species be
longed in tb? great order of nature.
"Besides this he was an authority on
miscroscopic life, especially minute para
sites, was a fair botanist, one of the lead
ing physicians and anatomists of his time,
and a perfect encyclopedia of geography
and exploration. Add to this a" good
memory for names and faces, and a fa
miliarity with several forei: n languaees,
and you get some idea cf this man's pow
ers in that respect. After a long con
versation with him one day on this sub
ject. I estimated that his memory enabled
him to use 25,000 words at will."
Dr. Murray-Aaron gives the details of
this esiiruate, which allows for English,
geolopital and general science, 3000 words
each; three foreign languages and geo
graphical, U'ooo each; and technical and
n-edical, 5000 each. This estimate does not
peern to be an extravagant one.â Pittsburg
Dispatch.
Decorating a Room,
To make a room appear higher the plane
surface of the ceiling should be decreased
by the moldings of the cornice, by panels,
or, in the absence of these, by bands ol
color performing the .*arae office. A verti
cal system of lines should l>e adopted in
mural decoration, and the mantel hhould
be lover.
To make a room appear lower exactly
the opposite treatment should be adopted ;
that :s, to increase the plane ceiling, adopt
a horizontal system of mural decoration,
with v da io ai)d a bigb uiantd.
To make a room appear wider is accom
plished, to a certain extent, by making it
apt ear lower; but wbere tins is undesir
able, or wbere it is insufficient, the effect
can be reached by adopting a mural dec
oration on a graduated Â±ci\e of form, de
creasing upward, so that two or mere pat
terns at tte top like those at the foot are
found to occupy the same space as one at
the foot, and this effect can be much in
creased by a gradation of color upward
from dark to lieht. To make a room ap
pear narrower is accomplished, to a certain
extent, by making it appear higher, but
where this is undesirable or insufficient,
it can be obtained by adopting a strongly
drawn large pattern in strong color for
mural decoration.
To m:ike a room appear longer is to an
extent accomplished by making it appear
lower and narrower, but where this is un
desirable or inefficient the effect may be
obtained by decreasing the scale and
strength of color of the mural decoration
adopted at the ends.
To make a room appear shorter is ac
complished to an extent by making it ap
pear wider and higher, but the effect can
be achieved by increasing the scale and
strength of color of the mural decoration
adopted at the en-is.
Any of those effects can be modified or
increased by the treatment of the floor sur
face, whether by the carpets, the rugs or
painted boards, or by parquetrie floorine ;
lines running across a room, or rugS laid
down at intervals, having the effect of
shortening, and consequently to an extent
of heightening and widening a room.
Lines running in the length increase this
dimension, and to an extent reduce the
height and width. A polished floor in

prolonging them. â English Mechanic.
GET A FREE RIDK.
A Car In Denver Especially for the Use of
Horses.
Here is a street-car for the accommoda
tion horses which is the very latest thing
in the West. Such a car is now in opera
tion in Denver, and it is pronounced a
great success by all able to give an opinion
on the subject. The iiorses themselves
are durub, but if their judgment could be
had it would no doubt be favorable.
The riding car for the horses consists of
a platform mounted on small wheels, pro
tected at the sides by a sufficiently high
railing, while the front and rear are pro
vided with gates. These permit the horses
to get on and off the car without backing.
"When the regular passenger car has been
drawn to the top of the long ascent, the
horse car is hooked to the forward end, the
horses, are driven aboard, and by a few deft
turns of the brake the descent is made
safely.
At first the horses showed some hesita
tion about embarking on what appeared
to be a perilous adventure. But they soon
became accustomed to it, and an? said to
even enjoy the experience, expressing their
pleasure by broad smiles and prolonged
whinnies. â¢
There is no reason why this plan should
not be adopted with protit elsewhere.
There are many car lines which run for
almost their entire length on more or less
steep inclines. The additional force re
quired to be exerted in drawing a car up
hill is turned into a propelling force when
the car begins the descent. This force
might well be employed in giving the
horses a ride, and thus saving wear and
tear on their feet.
It might be supposed that the addi- j
tional pull imparted to this human pas
senger-car, when on the down grade, might |
cause the brake to but this is not the j
case. It is only necessary to make the
brake a little more powerful than that on
the ordinary streetcar.
Having arrive; at the foot of the incline,
the gate of the horse passenger-car is un
fastened and the animals once more taKe
their places in the traces, drawing both i
cars behind them up the hill. The entire |
load is not much heavier than a single car |
on a level street, as the car in which the
horses ride is very light.
Story of a Bell.
The old bell of St. John's Episcopal
TUE CARIIOUSES 1 OWN CAR.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 19, 1896,
Church, Ellicottville, N. V., has an inter
esting history. It hung originally in a
monastery in Malaga, Spain. The monast
ery was sacked in 1832, and this bell, with
others, was shipped to New York. Nicholas
Devereaux, agent of the Holland Land
Company at Ellicottville, bought it and
sold it to iSt. Jonn's Episcopal Church.
The inscription on it is as follows:
"Abe soi labos del angel qve en alto
svena Maria Gracip plena Bargas
Mefeci Malaga, 1708." The meanins of
tnis was a mystery for a long time, until
Bishop Coxe studied it, and saia it was in
corrupt Spanish, in which b was often
used for v, and which changed many other j
letters. "Thus," he said, "abe" should be
"aye" and "Jabos" should be "la vos."
The inscription put in pure Spanish fol
lows: "Aye (soi la voz del angel qve en
alto svena) Maria, plena gracia." The
English translation he made thus: "Hail
(lam the voice of the angel who on high
stands forth) Mary ! full of grace!" The
last words, of course, mean Bargas made
me, Malaga, 1708." â New York Tribune.

Through the crowded streets returning, at the end
of the day,
Hastened one whom all saluted as he sped along
his way;
In his eye a gieam of triumph, in his heart a joy
sincere,
And the voice of shouting thousands still resound
ing in his ear.
Passed he 'neath a stately archway toward the
goal of his desire.
Till he saw a woman's figure lolling idly by the
lire,
"I have won!" he cried, exultant; "I have saved a
cause irom wreck, â . -
Crushed the rival that 1 dreaded, set my foot upon
his neck!
Now at las the way is open, now at last men call

Languidly she turned to listen, and decorous was
her pretense,
And her cold patrician features mirrored forth In

â¢â Men are always scheming, striving for some petty
end," said she:
Then, a little yawn suppressing, "What Is all of
this to me?"

Through the shadows of the evening, as they
quenched the sunset glow,
Came the other, faring homeward, with dejected
step and slow,
Wistful, pec-ring through the darkness, till he saw,
a.- oft before,
Where a woman stood impatient at the threshold
of the door.
"I have lost!'! he faltered faintly. "All is over,"
with a groan;
Then he paused and gazed expectant at the face
beside hisown.
Two soft eyes were turned upon him with a
woman's tenderness.
Two white arms were flung about him with a pas
sionate caress.
i And a voice of thrilling music to his mutely ut
tered plea
Said "If only you are with me what is all the rest
to me?"

' All night long the people's leader sat In silence
and alone,
Dull of eye, with brain unthinking, for his heart

While the hours passed all unheeded till the hush

NEW SYSTK3I OF COUNTING.
Numerals Represented by a Series of
Motions "With the Arms.
Here is something new in the way of a
deaf-and-dumb mode of represent figures
THE QLEER NEW SYSTEM OF COUNTING.
and numbers, says the New York World.
It is a new system of numeration resem
bling in no respect the Arabic or the
Roman, being less simple than the first
and more simple than the second. The
children in the French calisthenic schools
have become so proficient in it that they
can strike an attitude that will represent
any familiar date in French history or in
any other History, as far as that goes.
>>"o. 1 is formed by extending the left
arm in a straight line from the shoulder
so as to form a right angle with the body.
; No. 2 is made by dropping the left arm half
way between its former position and the
i hips, so as to form an acute angle with the
J body. No. 3is made by raising the arm
j the same distance above the shoulder as it
has just been below the shoulder, thus
forming an obtuse angle. These are the
three fundamental rules, and all the fig
ures that follow are variations of these.
The series four, five and six are created
| by analogous movements of the forearm
v ilk V pper arm neld horizontally. In
iso. 4 the forearm makes a right angle with
the upper arm, in No. 5 an acute angle, in
JNo. ban obtuse angle. Then lowering the
upper arm, so that it will make an acute
angle with the body, and, repeating the
movements of the forearm, executes the
series of 7, 8 and 9.
Having thus regulated the units the tens
are next provided for, and the very simple
method of determining these is" by the
movement of the right arm exactly"simi
lar to that which we have just seen in the
lelt. *or the hundreds the same move
| rnent is gone through with the left leg and
for the thousands with the right leg.
â i W r the application of these indi
vidual figures to make up a complete num
bs r, say 1895 for example. It must be
understood that these numbers are sep
arated into units, tens, hundreds and
thousands, and we make them represent
a thousand and eight hundred, not 1800.
inus one thousand is indicated by the
right leg being elevated to a right angle
with the body; eight hundred by the left
leg being raised to an acute angle with the
body and the knee bent so that the foot
hangs down perpendicularly on a line with
it; and ninety by the right'arm held at an
acute angle with the body and the forearm
at an obtuse angle with the upper arm.
W hat the practical utility ol this method
is supposed to be is not disclosed, but as it
affords the children in the French schools
considerable amusement and at the same
time impresses the numerals upon their
mind, it has doubtless been found useful
in their training. Several efforts have
been made to formulate an alphabet in
somewhat the same way, but that has been
found thus far too difficult, because of the
large number of characters to be repre
sented.

GROWTH OF BRITISH POLICY.
The Modern Carthage Was Founded by
William 111.
The unparalleled settlement accom
plished or at least organized by William
111, which dealt so successfully with ques
tions so fundamental, which at the same
time settled the succession of the crown,
waged war victoriously against France and
Spain and established the state of Great
Britain by the union of England and
Scotland, had created, as we have seen, a
commonwealth predominantly commer
cial.
The BritiÃh policy which, in spite of
some Hanoverian excursions, had ceased
to be dynastic, and had established itself
upon the national interests, recognized
those interests in trade. The eighte -nth
century was to show that in the notion of
trade was involved the empire of the seas
and a vast colonial dominion. But this
was not, as yt;t, distinctly comprehended.
Daring the early part bf the eighteenth
century, that is in the rei~nofAnne.it
was only visible that the Britannic state
showed* a military and diplomatic skill
which was wholly new, and interfered in
Continental affairs with more decision
than had been its wont under either the
Tudors or the Stuarts.
When the period of war was over the
house of Brunswick speedily succeeded to
an insular kingdom, possessing far more
consolidation at home than it had ever
known before. When, after a few years,
France recovered under the guidance of
Fleury from the serious blows she had re
ceived, and it seemed that the age of Louis
XIV was to be followed, as it had been pre
ceded, by the age of a great cardinal, the
total result of the remarkable transition
which â  England had undergone became
measurable, and the Europe of the
eighteenth century displayed its chief in
ternational features.
Looking about Dim, Frederick the Great
expressed the conviction that all the
states of Europe were drawn in the train
either of England or of France, and that
the standing hostility between those two
states ruled everything. This grand riv
alry between Englishmen ami Frenchmen
reminded Frederick of the Punic wars.
The French, restored to their old influence
by Fleury, struck him as the modern
Romans. Great Britain, he admits, cher
ishes no designs of Continental conquests;
she desires only to push her trade. k
She is, he sees, the modern Carthage:
but to his mind it is a great evil that all
the states of Europe alike are forced to
take part in the grand rivalry which em
braces the globe. Frederick was thus the
very first to form the conception which in
the first years of the nineteenth century
possessed the mind of Napoleon and led to
a Punic war indeed, which had its Hanni
bal, and had also its battle of Zama.
The international situation which led to
this result was already visible before the
middle of the eighteenth century, and had
begun to exist earlier still. It is the con
sequence of that transition which is con
sidered in these volumes, and the outcome
of which was the establishment of a com
mercial state, including the whole Britan
nic world. The modern Carthage was
founded when the revolution of 1688, fol
lowed by the Hanoverian succession, had
established a secure Government with a na
tional and no longer a dynastic policy; and
when this had acquired Britain, instead of
England, for its territorial basis, and was
able also to draw in its train Ireland, not,
indeed, united or satisfied, but pacified
and withdrawn from the influences of re
action. When, as time passed on. this
great Britannic state defeated in the field
the combined powers of France and Spain
and began to be acknowledged as the
leading maritime power, while, at the
same time, with omnivorous energy, it
devoted itself to trade, a state appeared
which resembled the ancient Carthage as
much as the great states of the modern
world can resemble the small states of an
tiquity. â Review of Professor Seeley's
"Growth of British Policy" in New York
Sun.
ORIGINALITY ON THE BENCH.
How a Nebraska Judge Dispenses
Justice.
No more unique figure is to be found in
the American judiciary than Judge Gashn
of Nebraska, and many are the stories told
of this interesting personality. When first
elected to the office he was long on sense
of justice and a determination to bring
about a more orderly condition of affairs
in his district, but somewhat short on his
knowledge of law. The latter he remedied
in later years by persistent study, but the
former characteristic he still retains.
His methods of administering justice
were decidedly peculiar and original, but
seldom led him amiss. Criminals brought
before him were tried and bundled off to
the penitentiary with such celerity and
given such severe sentences that he made
short work of the lawless element.
Succeeding these came the shark who
sought to rob the honest settler by the
forms of law, and the Judge soon became
recognized by this class as no less an
enemy than he had proved himself to be
to the criminal element. Concerning his
methods of dealing with them the follow
ing story is told:
A 4-per-cent-a-month money-lender had,
through the instrumentality of a small
loan, secured about everything a home
steader possessed except his farm, but
with all the payments the loan refused to
prow less. Finally action was brought in
court to enforce payment of the alleged
balance by means of a judgment against
the man's farm. A jury had been secured
which understood -its business, and in
spite of the instrvictions of Judge Gaslin,
which favored the defendant, brought in a
verdict for tbe plaintiff.
The Judge looked surprised, but was
equal to the emergency.
''Mr. Clerk," he said, "that verdict is set
aside. It takes thirteen men to steal a
man's farm in this court."
On another occasion a man who had
drifted over into Nebraska from Colorado,
who was not familiar with the manner of
administering justice on the Nebraska side
of the border, appropriated a horse which
he found hitched to a post in front of a
country store. The horse happened to be
the property of Judge Gaslin.
The thief was captured and later bound
over to await trial in the District Court.
A few days after Judge Gaslin met a fellow
Judge from another district and requested
him as a favor to come into his district on
a day specified and sentence a horsethief,
as Gaslin said he felt a little delicacy in
sentencing a man for stealing his own
horse.
The fellow-jurist assented and incident
ally inquired when the offender was con
victed.
"Oh, he isn't convicted yet," replied
Gaslin, "but I'll 'tend to that part of it,"
and he did. â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
A QtTAIXT NEW ENGLAND TOWN.
Where the Individualism of Early Days
Is Experienced.
The very name "Salem" is an index of
its character, as well in sound as in signifi
cation. How differently does its measured
cadence strike the ear, with how much
more of dignity, comfort, tranquillity than
that of its brisk neighbor, Lynn, whose
sharp monosyllable causes one an inadver
tent shock as the brakeman announces
these two contrasted sister cities to the
traveler upon the Eastern Kailroau. The
story is told of Phillips Brooks (with more
authenticity than belongs to most of the
stories attached to him) that coming into
Salem from Boston one evening he re
marked to a friend: "What do you sup
pose I saw coming up your quietstreet? â
a little dog going over to Lynn to bark."
The adjective which is oftenest used of
Salem is "conservative." It is well ap
plied. Her very appearance is expressive,
not of decay, but of conservatism. Her
old buildings and dwellings are not left
to disuse and ruin. Far from it. They
are tenanted with as much complacency
and pride (and at as high rentals) as if
there were no finer upon the continent â
and, indeed, there are not, if you accept
the criterion of those who say that the
best house is one that has been the longest
lived in.
In truth, many of the old houses are

possessed of great charm and beauty. Old
and exquisite carvings, generous fire
places (too often walled in), wide hall
ways, handsome staircases, old-fashioned
plate and china, antique furniture and
bric-a-brac, brought home from distant
lands, combine to lend many of these old
residences a rare attractiveness. In others
are to be found tokens of age of a different
kind, such as low ceilings, narrow stair
ways, uneven floors, diminutive window
panes and other tokens of the inefficiency
of bygone days. One virtue they all pos
sess, the beautiful and the ugly alike,
and that is individuality. Nowhere,
certainly, can there be found clear
er expression of the individualism
of early New England than in the
diversities in appearance and construction
of the dwellings of this old Puritan city.
Fronts of a thousand different designs;
ells and lean-tos of the most peculiar pat
terns; roofs of all descriptions, hip-roofs,
curb-roofs, gable-roofs, shed-roofs; win
dows of all sizes and shapes; doorways of
diverse types, many of them quite artistic;
chimneys that often look as if they were
the original structures and the houses
built round them, and interiors of equal
diversity , amuse as well as interest those
who have not been accustomed to these
old dwellings from their youth up.
There is a deal of picturesqueness about
them as well as a deal of distortion and
homeliness, much as it was doubtless with
the humanity which built them.â Boston

Specimens Made Before the Days of
Abraham.
It is to J. de Morgan, the antiquarian
explorer and historian of the Caucasus,
and now director of the important excava
tions at Dashour, near Memphis, in
Egypt, that we owe the discovery of what
must at present be accounted the oldest
specimens of the jeweler's art known to
exist. Until his first find of last year the
most ancient Wees of jewelry known were j
those discovered by M. Mariette, that had
once belonged to Queen Aahotep, mother
of the King Amosis of the eighteenth dy- j
nasty, who lived about 1700 B. C. *â 
Mr. de Morgan has brought to light, 1
AN ENGINE ON THE TOY RAILROAD.
among other things, so many specimens
of jewelry that we may now be said to
possess a complete knowledge of the art as
it was before the time of Abraham, which,
according to the most received chronology,
was about 2300 years before Christ, while
the dates to be assigned to these finds
range from tne reign of Amenemhat 11,
who began to rule 2714 B. C, to that of
Amenemhat ill. who died B. C. 2578.
The period v.as for Egypt one of expan
sion and conquest. The unruly tribes of
the Soudan and of Sinai were brought
into subjection, and were compelled to
pay a tribute of gold and gems. Much
later we learn from inscriptions that even
Assyria was obligea to forward to Egypt
quantities of lapis-lazuli and other stones.
In the Dashour jewels lapis-lazuli, tur
quoise, carnelian and the Egyptian
emerald are most frequently used, and ail
except the latter came most likely
from countries beyond the borders of
Egypt. They were used for engraved
beads, which were strung into necklaces,
bracelets and netted breastplates of the
richest effect; but were besides set in solid
gold, wrought into cloisonne-like com
partments to receive the stones, which
were cut to the shapes demanded by the
design. One of the most beautiful of these
iowels of gold and inlaid stones is the
breastplate bearing the cartouche of Ousir
tasen 11. The royal cartouche, with the
beetle (signifying immortality) and other
signs, is supported by two crowned hawks,
banded with turquoise and carnelian.
The sacred asp is coiled over the back of
each hawk, bearing on its neck the "tau,"
another emblem of immortality.
The whole is inclosed in a frame of an
architectural character. In addition to
this breastplate and that of Amenembat
111 were found the jeweled clasps of Queen
Noub-Hotep's necklace, in the form of
hawk's heads of solid gold, a hawk with
wings spread, and a clasp made of two
jeweled lotus buds of exquisite workman
ship.
The inscription on the breastplate reads:
"Amenemhat 111, the good god, the master
of the world and of the two countries (Upper
and Lower Egypt), subduer of the nations
and slaughtereitof the Mentis and Satis."
These two specially mentioned tribes were
inhabitants of Sinai and Arabia. The de
sign represents the King crushing with
his club these bitterest enemies of Egypt,
while the sacred hawk hovers over and
protects him. This is the oldest page of
history written in gold and gems. The
minutest details of the figures are engraved
/with the utmost skill in the gems which
compose the ornament.â Art Amateur.
Trains Delayed by the Wind.
Trainmen say it is not the "head-on"
winds that delay the cars, as the engine
presents a small portion of itself to it, and,
breaking through, the train can be ea?ilv
pulled along after it. But when the wind
strikes the train at an angle of 45 deg. the
trouble begins. The wind uses the whole
side surface as a leverage and gives the
engineer lots of trouble. The cars sway
over to one side and are dragged along
with difficulty. The engineers estimate
that in going 100 miles an extra ton of coal
is used in a strong wind at an angle, and
even then it is impossible to keep on
schedule time. The wind most disastrous
to travel on the Consolidated road is that
from the northeast. It strikes the trains
cornerwise and makes the engines strugele
and strain to counteract its force. This is
felt especially in crossing the Connecticut
River, where the wind has a full sweep,
and all the New York trains are a few
minutes late when the southeasters are in
force.â Springtield Republican.

Thousands of Americans Can't Get

Has Destroyed the Heart Action

Engineer Bates Discovers a Never-Failing and
Easy Remedy.
Delanson, N. V., Jan. 18.â Engineer
O. H. Bates stepped off Engine No. 275 to-
day, with a long oiler in one hand and a
bunch of waste in the other. Not a by-
stander there could help remarking big
youthful, healthy look and active, vigor-
| ous movement, and contrasting his ap-
pearance with his condition of two months
ago.
"Say, Colonel, how well you look!"
"Yes, I am well; better than I have been
for years."
"What have you been doing?"
"Oh, not much; No-to-bac cured me of
the tobacco habit, after using it 43 years
and braced me mentally and physically)
in fact, made me a new man in more ways
than one. I had no appetite; couldn't
sleep; now I sleep like a baby and eat
three times a day with a relish, for the
first time in years. My heart action is
regular and no longer a bar to increased
life insurance. You know throttle-pulling
requires a pretty steady nerve, and my
nerves are O. K. now. One box and a
quarter of No-To-Bac cured me completely
in ten days, after using tobacco forty years.
No-To-Bac is sold by all druggists. I see
the No-To-Bac stander on nearly every
druggist's counter, and made by the Ster-
ling Remedy Co. of New York and Chi-
cago. You ought to get one of their little
books called 'Don't Tobacco Spit and
Smoke Your Life Away,' and post your-
self. They send them free to any one that
writes. It cost me $1 to get cured, and I
spent three or four dollars a week for to-
bacco. If I had failed to get cured I would
have gotten my money hack, as the
makers guarantee three boxes to cure any
case. I have recommended the use of No-
To-Bac to many of the boys on the line
and every one of them who got the genuine
article, so far as I know, has been cured
Look out, don't let some of the imitations
be palmed off on you for No-To-Bac."
The cab bell rang, the engineer ciimbed
up quickly on the footboard, stuck his
head out of the cab window, pulled the
throttle half an inch and the big train
rolled away.THE COMMERCIAL WORLD.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, In-, Jan. 18.â Strength which de-
TelopeJ yesterday during the closing hours of the
session, and which remained in control of prices
on the curb, was still in evidence In wheat at the
ooening this morning, and with very little excep
tion held sway throughout the short session to
day. It was due more to local conditions than to '.
any important Information or imeJigenee, and the
crowd was ceneraily short of wheat, and the incli
nation to sell wus at a minimum, the demand
na urally casting an advauc*. Liverpool caoles
were firm and i^d hicher. Kradbtr^et's reported
vf-rv good clÂ«Â»arxincss Ol wheat a'icl fiour from boih
roasts '.or the w<vk, 3 -10 o<>o bosiiels. Receipts
In the Northwest showed a falling off, 409 cars
arriving as a?aiu.,t GB4 laÂ»t .'saiiiriar, and 190 a j
>ftrÂ«go. JCecei.'ita at Chicago were 11 cars, and ;
67.000 bushed were taken from store. Atlantic
scatjoard clearances amounted to 618,128 bushel*. '
These ehipmrnts co:;*r;buted to the final strength !
of the day. Continental cables were generally un- |
changed. May wheat opened at t>oi,4c. sold be- I
tw*en GOV&r&filc, closing' at6o^ g c, V*c higher than i
yesterday. Estimated receipts for Monday 65
cars.
CORNâ TLe corn market was firm, deriving its
stimulus from wheat. Only ;\ Saturday business
was tranÂ«^c;c-J. with shorts 1 xliioluiig more inter
est in buying lhÂ»n in endeavoriup to increase their
!ini\Â«. IJverpool cables v.-ere dull and l /i@ x /b4

PROVISIONSâ Prices of product failed to ad
vance or hold the full appreciation of the last few
days. 'I!. is was owing more to the desire on the
ran. of the holders to realize than to any abatement
of bull orders. The ho:: market, this morning early
was bigher. but the later advices quoted an easier
feeling. At the close Mar pork wÂ»a 12 y~c lower

COALâ Harris'on's circular says: "During the
week there have been eight arrivals from the Coast
nines with 15.379 tons of Coal, from Glasgow 1760
tons, from Australia 2400 tons.- These arrivals
only aggregate about half our actual consumption,
yet there is no visible scarcity of fuel of any special
grade; of Swansea Anthracite there is a larger
quantity in yard than at any period last year. The
rec>nt stormy weather has* materially diminished
the stocks of domestic Coals, Insomuch so that the
dealers take immediate delivery from ship's side of
all British Columbia cargoes now arriving. The
general rainfall through the interior is certain to
Induce ship-owners 10 become liberal shippers of
Coal cargoes in the near future, anticipating an j
abundant harvest this season; It is true that so far
we are behind 25% of our annual average of rain up
to date, still this last storm has been most propi
tious. The list of Coal carriers Is decreasing from
Swansea and Australia; Latterly there have been
over two arrivals here for each new name added
them. The last engagement from Swansea was
made at 14s; this shows no decline; from Austra
lia rates are merely nominal, but few charters are
being made." * Wellington quotable at $8 14 ton;

A NEW WATER
SUPPLY SOURCE,
Castroville Lakes to Yield
Eighty Million Gallons

NATURAL FILTRATION.
Could Be Brought in Steel Pipes
at a Cost of Six and a
Half Millions.
-PURE AND INEXHAUSTIBLE."
Plans and Estimates for a System
That Might Solve the Water
Problem for All Time.
What bears on the lace of it the stamp
of the best and most practicable plan that
has ever been broached for supplying San
Francisco with a cheap, ample and pure
water supply is that which is now being
pushed forward by the men interested in
the Castroville lakes.
If all that these men claim for this pro
jected system be true â and the statements
appear to be such as can be readily proven
or disprovenâ then it seems a safe pre
diction that not only San Francisco, but
all the near-by cities and towns will
eventually be supplied with water, from
the Castro lakes system.
No definite financial plan has yet been
formed, but surveys, tests, measurements
and estimates have been made, and upon
these two of the gentlemen most inter
ested, Attorney M. E. Babb and Civil En-
gineer S. L. Hansborough, make the fol
lowing statements:
The lakes at Castroville cover an area of
over 3000 acres. Their average depth is
from thirty-five to 3-50 feet, and at all
seasons of the year they remain at about
the same level. They are fed from subter
ranean springs in the coast range, and the
water is of the very purest and most whole
some character. The early padres, in
their report to the King of Spain, set forth
that these lakes were the sink of Lake
Tulare, which is in itself one of the great
est catchment basins in the world. It is
known that although Lake Tulare has no
outlet to the ocean its banks are not over
flown in the rainy seasons, and tliat there
are many other indications which seem to
prove that Lake Tulare must have a sub
terranean outlet.
But whether the guesses of the early
padres that the waier in the Castroville
lakes comes all the way through the
mountains from Lake Tulare be right or
wrong certain it is, at all events, that the
Castroville lakes are fed by a more admir
able system of filtration than human in
genuity could devise. The lakes are about
four miles from the ocean and the Jand
immediately behind them begins to slope
tip to the foothills, which are fifteen miles
to the west. All or most of the sloping
| land above the lakes forms a great, white
gravel channel, through which the water
percolates from the mountains into the
lake. This gravel channel is several miles
in width, and one using a spade in it at
any poini readily brings to the surface a
stream of crystal purity.
Engineer Hanstorough was sent to the
region to search for a solid stream of :
water, which it was thought must pour
i cut of the mountains at some point in
â¢ order to feed these great lakes at Castro
j ville. Instead of the solid stream gushing
j from the mountain-side or rushing down
I the gullies he found this great gravel
j channel. And he declares that he can
j convince the most skeptical by the most
casual or the most thorough examination
that this channel of line, white gravel
forms the most perfect filter in the world.
The region around these lakes is one of
those earliest settled, and the oldest in
habitant of the land, as well as the newest,
comer, lauds the purity of Castroville
lake water to the skies. The Hotel del
Monte used the water for years, before it
! put in its own pumping plant, and the in
habitants of Castroville ciaim to have
given the water, in all these years, a far
better test than the most perfect scientific
analysis could vouchsafe it. So much for
the lakes and the source of their supply
and the quality of the water. It is only
necessary to add that there are no cow
ranches near the lakes and no possible or
probable sources of contamination, either
at present or in the future.
Now, about the water system. Engi
neer Hansborough has located a solid
stream of water that runs from the lakes
to the ocean. This is called the Tembla
dera, and is a ravine eight feet deep and
twenty feet in average width, through
which there flows a steady stream equal to
thirty feet per second. At a point on this
channel, about 150 feet below the crossing
of the Southern Pacific's Monterey branch
railroad, Engineer Hansborough has lo
cated his site for pumping works. From
this point to the mouth of Lake Superiorâ
the largest of the Castroville group of
lakes â the distance is three-quarters of a
mile. And from this point, in the other
direction, the stream flows on down the
channel to the ocean, or rather to Monte
rey Bay, at a point about three miles from
Moss Landing.
Mr. Hansborough says that his experi
j ments at this point show a flow of 82,500,
--| 000 gallons in twenty- lour hours. These
measurements were taken at a time when
the lakos were at their lowest point, owing
Ito a long dry spell. When there is the
I ordinary rainfall each year, of course the
I How is considerably increased. Being im
pressed with the extraordinary advantages
of this stream and tne lakes which feed it
as forming the basis of a water system for
| Kan Francisco and the near-by cities the
following document was drawn up by At
torney Babb and d uly liled with the proper
j authorities. The document speaks its own
purpose and reads as follows:

This document is regularly sworn and
attested before a notary public, and seems
j to comply with all the requirements of
the law, so far as the preliminary steps
are concerned.
Those who have had the rmtience to
: wade through the legal verbiage of the
j document have seen that there is already
! a definite plan to pump the water from
OUTLINE MAP OF THE CASTRO LAKES, SITUATED ON THE BOLSA NUEVA V MUROCOJO GRANT.

largest catchment basins in the world.]
the Tembladera Channel to San Francisco
and adjacent cities.
Some estimates from one of the largest
g 'imping manufacturers in the world â the
oily Manufacturing Company of Locks
port, N, V.â are to the effect that for the
sum of $6,000,000 the Holly Company will
guarantee to convey to San Francisco
from Tembladera Channel, through a
half-inch steel pipe of the diameter of
sixty inches, 24,000,000 gallons of water
every twenty-four hours, with a perpetual
pressure at this end of eighty pounds to
the square inch.
And for the total sum of $10,000,000 the
came company will pump and pipe the
water to every householder in this City.
The cost of operating the pumping station
would be $100 a day.
The promoters of this plan do not hesi
tate to point out. anmng other things, the
financial advantages of the system. It is
known, they say, that the Spring Valley
system is not only antiquated' and impure,
but excessively expensive and inadequate
as weli. The people of San Francisco are
paying the interest on $15,000,000 winch
are said to be invested in the Spring Val
ley plant, and aside from this they are
paying the interest and principal of
the cost of an army of collectors and
clerks, including high-salaried officials,
whose sole usefulness is to collect the ex
orbitant tax and influence a majority of
the Board of Supervisors to keep up the
rates. Now if the municipality should
take hold of the Castro Lake proposition
and pay in cash or bonds for the entire
plain water could ultimately be as free as
air to the householders of San Francisco;
or at least the rate would greatly be de
creased, while the quality, quantity and
pressure would be well nigh perfect.
In this connection the recent report of
Engineer HanÂ»borough to Attorney Mil
ton E. Babb and those he represents will
be of interest. It reads as follows:
San Francisco, Jan. 15, 1896.
Milton E. llahb Eta-: In reply to your inquiry,
"Is there an available water supply near this
City, and what would be the cost of bringing it
here?" I desire to reply:
I have located a supply of over 80,000,000
gallons per twenty-four hours of water that is
within seventy-five miles of this City. The
water is cool, clear and absolutely pure, and
can be delivered to this City in pipes at about
the following cost:
100 miles of 60-1 nch steel pipe 96,000,000
HiKKinc, ditclilne am! layitiK pipe 100.0 JO
Cost of three 12,0u(),or;0 gallon pump
ng-eiiKines (high duty), including
boilers and buildings 350,000
Setting up machinery, building suction
pipes, etc 50,000
Tota ' '....96.600,000
The above machinery will deliver 24,000,000
gallons of water every twenty-four hours in
this City at a pressure of eighty pounds to the
square inch, and the daily cost of maintaining
me pumping station would be as follows:
1 superintendent's salary f 5 00
'J stokers salary . 5 00
2 engineers' salary 6 00
127 tons of coal at 91 108 00
Total $124 00
The Castroville lakes are seventy-live
miles from San Francisco as the crow
Hies, but the nearest available pips route
would be nearly a hundred miles. The
lakes are ten feet above the level of high
water, an elevation, of course, that is in
sufficient to give the proper pressure. But
the Holly Company is the owner of many
patents on pressure pumps, which are said
to have revolutionized pumping methods
in the East.
In the foregoing are most of the claims
set forth by the promoters of the Castro
ville Lake system of municipal water
supply. All of which look very alluring
on a surface view, and will certainly re
pay the serious consideration of San
Francisco taxpayers.
THE CITY'S WATER,
; Judge Beawell'B Decision in a Case Involving
the Snpply. at Fires,
The suit of James F. Hill against the
! Spring Valley Water Company, which in
cluded an interesting point involving the
liability of the company when the water
supply fails in case of lire, has been de
cided by Judge Seawell. He has sustained
tue demurrer of the defendant company.
The demurrer was made upon the ground
that facts sufficient to form a cause of
action had not been stated.
Tlie suit was for the value of a $5000
building belonging to Hili which was
burned on July 11, 1885. A building on
the corner of Bryant and Fifth streets
caught tire, and as the water supply was
very inadequate the flames spread until
they finally consumed the building on
Bluxonie street, which belonged to the
plaintiff. Had the defendant furnished
sufficient water, it was contended, the tire
would not have spread to the plaintiff's
building and consequently he sought to
have the company made liable for his loss.
In the act under which the water com
pany was incorporated in 1858, occurred
the following:
All companies formed under the provisions
of this act or claiming any of the privileges of
the same, shall furnish pure fresh water to the
inhabitants of each city and county or city
and town for family uses so- long as the supply
permits, at reasonable rates and without dis
tinction of persons, upon proper demand there
for, and shall furnish water to the extent of
their means to such city and county or city
and town, in case of fire or other great neces
sity, free of charge.
Subsequently, in 1873, the following sec
tion of the Civil Code was put in foree â
section 549:
All corporations formed to supply vrater to
cities or towns must furnish pure fresh water
to the inhabitants thereof for family uses so
long as the supply permits, at reasonable rates
and without distinction of persons upon
proper demand therefor, aud must furnish
water to the extent of their means, in case of
lire or other great necessity, free of charge.
It was upon the difference between these
laws that the case was based. In the act
of 1858 it requires that the water furnished
for fires shall be furnished to the City. In
the section of the code no distinction is
made. Another inference to be drawn is
that the water must be furnished to the
inhabitants.
In referring to the plaintiff's contention
that the water must be furnished to the
inhabitants and not to the city, the court
says:
If plaintiff's construction be correct, the de
fendant has not at any time since the codes
went into effect been untler the obligation to
furnish water free to the City and County in
case of fire or for sprinkling streets, flushing
the sewers or irrigating the public parks or
squares.
No good reason can be assigned for requiring
the defendant to furnish water free to the in
habitants instead of to the City and County in
case of fire. The inhabitants are not equipped
with the apparatus necessary for the ex
tinguishing of tires. Water for" extinguishing
fires has always been supplied to the munici
pality through its Fire Department. Pipes
and mains are laid in the streets and hydrants
erected from time to time as the public in
terest requires and are used in extinguishing
h" res, not by the inhabitants as such, but by
the Fire Department of the City.
It was admitted by plaintiff's counsel
that if the law required the water to be
furnished to the City and not the inhabi
tants then the City only can recover, and
this was Judge Seawell's position. He
sustained the demurrer, with ten days to
amend if possible.
PEACE IN THE LIBRARY.
Annual Election of the Mercan
Association Will Hsto No Oppo
sition Ticket.
The Mercantile Library Association will
hold its annual election of officers at the
Library building, on Van Ness avenue, to
morrow. Polls are to be open from 9a. m.
to 6* f. jr. and from 7 to 8 r. m.
As there is no opposition this year in the
field but little attention has been given
the election by members, and so the asso
ciation misses the turmoil of a political
campaign. All members appeared to be
entirely pleased with the regular ticket, in
which great hopes are placed for the com
ing year.
"The lack of contest," said A. E. Castle,
the recording secretary, yesterday, "shows
that the affairs of the library have been
brought into pretty good condition. The
library is beginning to do much better
than before, and new members are coming
in quite rapidly ; besides, we received two
large donations that helped us out mate
rially. So the incoming board can take
up the management with quite a satisfac
tory prospect ahead oi them."
The new board that will be elected Mon
day without opposition is as follows:
Thomas Magee, president: Samuel C. Bige
low, vice-president; J. J. O'Brien, treasurer;
Charles J. King, recording secretary; William
Doxey, corresponding secretary; trusteesâ T.

CHARLTON GOT HIS WIFE
The Kansas 'Man Starts for
Olathe With Her and Their
Two Boys.
SOME PATHETIC INCIDENTS.
Charlton's Story of His Wife's Journey
to Ohio and the Duplicity of
A. J. Rich.
E. L. Charlton, steward of the deaf and
dumb asylum at Olathe, Kans., whose wife
ran away with A. J. Rich and came to
California recently, induced Mrs. Charlton
to go back yesterday, and, in company
{ with their boys, the two started East.
Charlton had a bard time of it. j?or sev
; eral days his wife would have nothing
â¢ t to do with him, and she wouldn't give up
! the two little boys, who had come across
the continent with her and Rich.
As for the fellow Rich, he kept out of
the way of Charlton, for the latter had a
bad look in his eye. Rich knew enough
to stay out of his sight.
A bronzed, sunburned man, with a dark
mustache and dark eyes, stood at the desk
of the Russ House at 1 o'clock yesterday.
He had the air of one expectant and
anxious. It was Charlton. Friends had
finally arranged for a meeting of the mem
bers of the family after much effort.
The woman had even promised to brin<Â»
the two boys, meet her husband and go
back with him.
"She's liable to be along here any min
ute now, she and the boys," said the
bronzed man to a Call representative as
he leaned heavily against the desk.
"Strangest thing I ever heard of. I never
would have thought it. You see my wife's
a very sympathetic woman, and this fel
low Rich â well, he just wrapped her around
his little finger.
"While at Olathe I needed some paint
ing done, and got this man to do it. This
is how he rewarded me. He had been a
friend for five or six years. As he waa
hard up I employed him.
"I have been sending my wife to her
former home in Ohio every few years. As
she needed rest, I thought", I sent her and
the boys home again. Six days after they
started Rich started too. IMiey met at
Hamilton, Ohio, and then started for gau
Francisco, via New Orleans.
'â¢My wife was at Marysville, Ky., twelve
miles from Manchester, where her father
lived, yet she never went to see him at
all."
While Charlton talked a slender woman
in somber garb came in through the hall
from the side entrance. It was not Charl
ton's wife, but evidently a woman who
was bridging domestic chasms for them
Charlton went with her into the parlor
and there neliind closed doors met his
unhappy spouse.
Half an hour afterward the united fam
ily sat at dinner in the hotel, preparatory
to taking the overland train for Leaven
worth. When the repast was eaten the
reunited family came out. The woman
was dressed in deepest black and leaned
heavily on the arm of her husband.
Charlton says Rich's only resources
were lrom an insurance policy'of $1000 on
his wife, who died three weeks before he
ran away with Charlton's wife. Of this rÂ«
has but $340 left. 1S Ec
