MIGHTY DIN ON THE DELAWARE
Distinguished Persons Join the
Screeching of Whistles With a
Chorus of Cheers.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 28.â The
big battle-ship lowa slipped from her
cradle into the waters of the Delaware
shortly after 1 o'clock this afternoon, to the
accompaniment of cheer? from thousand?
of tnroat? and the indescribable din of
hundreds of whistles. The launching was
a success in every respect, and Mis? Mary
Lord Drake, the daughter of lowa's Gov
ernor christened the new monster "lowa."
The launching was witnessed by a dis
tinguished representation from the Hawk
eye State, headed by Governor Drake and
Secretary Herbert of the navy, lowa's
Congressional delegation, the members of
the House of Representatives Naval Com
mittee, several members of the Senate
Naval Committee and the principal heads
of the different navy bureaus.
;* Besides the party gathered upon the
christening stand the yard was opened to
the public, and thousands of people wit
nessed the event from various points of
vantage. The weather was delightfully
warm and bright.
The lowa representatives arrived here yes
terday afternoon. The party consisted of
Governor F. If. Drake, Secretary of State W.
M. McFarland, State Auditor C. G. Mc-
Carthy, State Treasurer John Herriott,
Colonel Joseph McGarraugh, Colonel B.
C. Glassey, Colonel J. R. burning, Colonel
F. C. Letts, Colonel George Bogart, Colonel
C. F. McCarty, ColonÂ»l L. ~M. Martin,
Colonel C. G. Saunders. Colonel H. O.
Weaver, Colonel W. A. McArthur, Colonel
Â£'. E. Drake, son of the Governor, and
Colonel W. H. HutUg, composing thÂ« Gov
ernor' Â« staff.
With the party were the following ladles :
Miss Drake, Mrs. M. D. Siiouts. Mrs. E. D.
Grace, Mrs. J. R. Ni mint-. Mis? Mary Car
penter. Mrs. McFarland, Mrs. Robert Rae,
Mrs. John A. Drake. Mrs. F. E. Drake,
Miss Clarisse McCarthy. Besides the fore
going, the party was completed by the fol
lowing invited guests: Hon. L. A. Ellis,
Hon. E. G. Penrose, Cyrenus* Cole, Hon.
.W. EL Boyer, Colonel Robert Rae, Captain
J. F. Merry, Captain John F. Drake,
Coldnel T. B. Shouts, J. A. Mills and L.
Shearman.
The lowans were driven from their hotel
to the shipyard and were early on hand.
There they were met by Messrs. Charles
H. Cramp and Henry W. Cramp, respect
ively president and treasurer of the com
pany. The Governor and Miss Drake and
Miss Carpenter were escorted to a small
inclosed space directly beneath the bows
of the ship. The towering sides of the
red and white painted hull rose many feet
in the air above their heads and the mass
of dead weight of iron and steel would be
come in time a floating fortress bearing
upon its decks tbe heaviest of guns and
thousand? of tons of armor and machin-
;ry.
After escorting the lowans to the plat- j
farm Charles Cramp returned to the
railroad siding running along the yard
md In a few moments a special train hav
ing on board the party from Washington
: teamed up. In all about 300 people came !
rrom the capital to the launch. After
Secretary Herbert and the party had dis
;mbarked they were taken to the christen
ing platform and the Secretary and mem
bers of the two naval Congressional com
mittees were given good positions close to
Miss Drake.
When Miss Drake had arrived at the
jrards Henry Cramp had presented her
with a bunch of beautiful roses, but up to
this time he had borne beneath his arm a
pasteboard box. To all the old launcn
zoers present the pasteboard box was an
jvidence that something more sparkling
:nan lowa water would baptize the vessel.
I'resently Mr. Cramp opened the box and
Drought forth a pint bottle of chamuagne
md presented it to Miss Dratfe. The bot
tle was encased in a gold netting and from
:he neck depended a long streamer of rib
bon, on which was painted in gold
â¢Cramps' Shipyard, March 28, 1896." On
the other side of the ribbon, in similar
etters. was painted "Launch of United
States Battle-ship lowa.'" On the side of
the bottle was a silk label, on which was
a. beautifully painted picture of the lowa
as sue will appear when completed. It
was with this bottle of champagne that
Miss Drake christened the vessel, and she
subsequently bore away iU shattered frag
ments as a souvenir.
A few minutes before 1 o'clock the con
fusion of sounds that had been arising
irom beneath the keel of the vessel ceased.
Then a period of comparative silence
and anticipation ensued. Henry Cramp,
as he has done on many other similar oc
croons, recited his last admonitions to
: >rake as to the best means of shat
tering the bottle upon the ship. Then the
peculiar hisaing sound made by a saw cut
.': .'_' through wood came up from near the
ground, and in a brief space the shoe
piece was cut throuch and the big hull
started down toward the river. As it be
gan to move at 1:14 o'clock Miss Drake
â¢ the bottle by the streamers, and as
n crashed against tbe keel and the
<:barapagne spattered the side she ex
ciained: "I christen thee Iowa!"
The hull Flipped smoothly and gently
into the river, and as it floated out with
a :> c.e n keel the big siren whistle of the
Mas&acnusetts was turned loose and made
& scene that was exceedingly effective.

\ But still more trying on the eardrums of
| every one in the vicinity, tugs screeched
| and whistled and people cheered, and
' those on the christening stand congratu
j lated each other on the success of the
| launch.
The men aboard the lowa let go two
bow anchors when the momentum she
had received in the passage down tbe
i ways died away and brought her up head
down the stream.
After the launch a luncheon was servad
in the mold-loft. There was no speecn
making, as the crowd in the room where
the lunch was served was so great that the
formalities had to be abandoned. After
the luncheon the Washington party re
turned to the capital in their special train.
GREATEST IX THE XAVI.
The fourth Battleship to Be Owned by
the United States.
The lowa, the keel of which was laid
two and a half years ago, is the fourth
battleship to be owned by the United
States.
She has been constructed for sea pur
poses, the first three builtâ the Indiana,
Massachusetts and Oregon â being coast
battleships. The lowa is of 1000 tons
greater displacement than her sister ships,
and several feet longer and broader. The
hull is of steel, with a double bottom and
close water-tight subdivision to ten feet
above the water line. Her battery is to
consist of four 12-inch, eight 8-inch and six
4-inch breech-loading rifles, 26 pounders,
four 1 pounders, four Gatlines and one
field gun.
Compared with the Indiana the lowa
has greater length, greater breadth, in
creased length of outer line belt and
greater coal endurance and speed, to
gether with the ability to work the forward
twelve-inch guns in almost any condition
of sea. The magnificent electric lighting
plant, weighing forty-five tons, will afford
means to discover the enemy or guard
against the attack of torpedo-boats. She
will require a complement of nearly 500
men, or greater than that of any preceding
warship of the new navy.
The lowa is constructed under the act of
July 19, 1892. which made provision for one
seagoing battle-ship of about 9000 ton*
displacement, to cost, exclusive of arma
ment and speed premium, not more than
$4,000,000. The details of the construction
have been in the hands of Chief Con
structor Wilson and Engineering Chief
Melville, the famous Arctic explorer.
Excepting her armor, the lowa is a cun
ning structural evolution of steel plates
ana angles, in all the delusive lightness of
white paint. She is 360 leet long and 72
feet wide, drawing 24 feet of water. Her
FLE-A-TOY FOR THE TIVA LS.
j weight is 11.410 tons, 3110 of which is wisely
! distributed in the shape of armor protec
tion, varying in thickness from 14 inches
: along the water line and sides, s}^' and 16
i around the guns, 2% and 3 over the vitalsâ
| as the engines, boilers and magazines are
! called â to 10 about the fighting position or
! conning tower, just above and abart the
i forward large turret.
The lowa carries but eighteen guns; but
such guns ! Four of them, in the two large
turrets, peering out through 15-inch walls
of hardened steel, proof aeainst the sharp
est drills, are 12-inch breach-loading rifles,
firing a combined mass of 3400 pounds of
tempered steel. From the four smaller
turrets, each of which houses two 8-inch
The lowa, Greatest of America's Battle-Ships, Successfully Launched at the Cramps* Shipyards at
Philadelphia.
I rifle?, can be discharged shells of 250
; pounds each, capable of penetrating eight
! inches of steel two miles away,
; with a possible range of one mile for every
j inch of caliber. From any one of the
I lowa's five tubes a torpedo can be dis
charged bearing 120 pounds of guncotton
! and speeding on its errand of demolition
at the rate of tliirty miles an hour. No
ship, past or present, could withstand that
j blow if fairly struck.
Away beneath the water, the protective
deck of steel and many feet of coal, thirty
two roaring furnaces will develop in those
five ponderous boilers a constant pressure
of 160 pounds to the square inch. Two
separate triple-expansion engines, one on
j each shaft, will constitute the motive
i mechanisms of the ship, while auxiliary
i engines for a hundred purposes will reduce
i the tax upon the crew and add to the etti
j ciency of the craft by lilting and lowering
i the boats and the stores, raising the
anchors, loading the coal, discharging the
j asheÂ«, pumping and draining the various
I compartments, bringing the shot, shell
j and powder from the storerooms and
] magazines to the gun stations and turning
i the turrets; and, but for the guiding
I hand, manual labor is practically needless.
The captain no longer stands the inspir
j ing center of his officers and an animating
i example for his crew, but is housed within
the shelter of his conning tower of ten
inch steel. Step within this citadel and
there upon its curved walls are speaking
tubes, mechanical telegraphs, electric but
tons and a steering gear, all leading below
through an armored tube on their several
missions of communication and control.
A pressure on one of these tiny buttons
will start a mass of steel and powder from
those mighty guns, or, perhaps, let loose
a destructive torpedo ou a silent errand of
death; or, again, at a signal, the massive
machinery will bejjin to turn and pres
ently, when the great engines have reached
a maximum of 112 revolutions a minute
and churn, with the two sixteen-foot
screws, the water aft with an energy of
11,000-borsepower the great ship, a mass of
11,410 tons, will force herself and an equal
bulk of water at the rate of sixteen knots
an hour. To stand in her way and stop
her then means to take a blow of 130,000
foot tons from her murderous ram, before
which the toughest armor must bend like
meadow grass in a summer storm.
With her bunkers filled with 1800 tons of
coal she could steam at a ten-knot rate for
thirty-one days and cover a distance of
7000 miles, and at full speed would have a
radius of action of 3000 knots in six days'
time. ______________
UNCLE SAM'S TREASURE MOVED.
Men With Guns Guard the Money During
the Transfer of Sixteen Mil/ion
Dollars.
CHICAGO, 111., March 28.â This was
the most important of the moving days
for Uncle Sam at the crumbling pile
known as the Government building, $16,-'
500,000 in gold, silver and copper beiug
safely transferred from the old sub-treas
ury vaults by an express company to the
second floor of the Rand-McNally build
ing, where the sub-treasury will be located
until the $4,000,000 Federal building is
completed. The treasure weighed over
111 tons. Officials of the treasury counted
and placed the coin in sacks and packages,
which were passed along a line of men
guarded with guns to the iron safes of the
express company in the wagons at the
street door. Four wagons were kept going
back and forth all day.

28. â A dispatch from iiuluwayo under yesÂ«
terday's date presents the situation as be
ing of the gravest character.
A thousand women and children burned
a store forty miles ont from Buluwayo on
Thursday and performed a dance around
the flames.
Many murders of whites of the most
fiendish character are reported. It is
learned that the native police induced the
Matabeles to revolt and joined them with.
7.50 rifles and a large quantity of ammuni
tion.
A force of British troops under command
of Captain Spreckeys defeated a large body
of Matabeles on Thursday, killing a large
number of them, 'fhe British force los

LONDON, Em, March 28.â Sir Hercules
Robinson, Governor of the Cape Colony,
has telegraphed to the Colonial Office that
the reports of the murder of the police in
spector, Jackson, and the desertion of the
native police to the Matabeles is con
firmed. The native police took their
Martini rifles with them. The dispatch
states that Mabel, son of the late Matabele
King, Lobengula, who was banished in
1895, has returned to Matabeleiand, and
that he incited the uprising.
KRZJGER JbORMS ALLIASCES.
The English Will Sot Conquer the TranaÂ»
vaal With Kane.
LONDON, Exg., March 28.â The situa
tion in South Africa is decidedly serious,
though the Government has not yet
abandoned hope of an amicable adjust
ment. President Kruger has notified
Chamberlain that he cannot visit London
until the Volksraad meets in April, and
then only if England will consent to
recognize the independence of the Trans
vaal:
In the meantime Kruger has formed
alliances in South Africa, so that if war
comes it will be war with England on one
side and all the Dutch population on tha
otherâ a war that will need for its sup
pression more than the 20,000 that Eng
land is reported to be ready to send there.
It is not known accurately at the War
Office what the strength of the Boer forces
alone is that is now ready to take the
field. The representative of The United
Press learns from an official source that
within three months 2500 Germans ars
estimated to have entered the Transvaal
as immigrants, and these are known to bo
obtaining Transvaal money. The force of
Zulus, trained and commanded by Boer
and German officers, is estimated to numÂ«
ber 60,000. Though their tribal fidelity to
the Boers is doubtful, they can be trusted
to hght against the British.

the troubles in Egypt and elsewhere, the
English people are not likely to approve
the gigantic task of conquering the Trans
vaal, yet they must face that or the alter
native of a declaration of independence
from the Transvaal, the Orange Free State
and probably Cape Colony, which would
form the United States of South Africa.
The most serious news yet received from
Rhodesia is that which came to hand this
evening, raying that the native police
had Joined the uprising. This puts an en
tirely different face upon the affair, and
the. suppression of the trouble, which at
o firstpromised to be an easy matter, now
-. threatens to be a somewhat large under
taking. The main anxiety of the authori
ties here was centered hi ttie conduct of
this force.
Though it is only 350 strong it will be a
powerful factor in spreading the revolt.
The natives who served as police were re
cruited from the crack regiments of the
old Matabele Kingdom. They are well
trained, well armed and command a copi
ous supply of ammunition. Altogether
the outlook is in no wise as favorable as it
_ was yesterday for the speedy putting
" down of the revolt. The Globe, comment
ing this afternoon on the subject, says that
the fever of revolt is likely to spread to the
tribes beyond Matabeleland, including the
Zulus in the Transvaal, who, it was sup
posed, would fight with the Boers in event
of hostilities with the British.
= Inquiries made at the War Office as to the
strength of the British troops within* range
of the revolt only resulted in making evi
dent the official confusion on the subject.
Two companies of the Black Watch Regi
ment are stationed at Mafeking, on the
Transvaal border, and these are the only
troops who are known to be in .Rhodesia.
The paper says that Sir Hercules Robin
son, Governor of Cape Colony and High
Chief in South Africa, has strengthened
the troops in Rhodesia recently, but there
â¢ are no official advices to that effect. The
truth 6eems to be that Governor Robinson
has not sent any troops into that country.
To-day's advices confirm the importance
of the Dutch agitation for the independ
ence of South Africa. A letter received
here from a member of the Cape Parlia
ment says the English and Dutch political
leaders concur in the belief that tne posi
tion never was so threatening in the Trans
vaal. The heads of the movement are first
amply providing for their own safety
against a British attack. Many newcom
ers who are seen in Pretoria are known to
be German soldiers. They look to be
ready to jostle the English off the side
walk. Every steamer calling at Cape
Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth brings
.groups of so-called prospectors, who are
unable to conceal the stamp of the dis
ciplined soldier who is still uuder military
command.
Besides the Germans, the Boers are re
cruiting a foreign legion. The letter con
cludes with the statement that everybody
knows that there is war ahead and that
plenty of British and Dutch blood will be
shed ere the summer's grapes ripen.
The Liberal papers profess to be satisfied
with the results of the conference of the
National Liberal Federation held this?
week at Huddersfield. In the foyer of the
National Liberal Club the members who
have returned to London do not conceal
their disappointment. Impartial opinion
cau only describe the conference as the
mo^t .-tolid and mechanical party gather
ing that was ever held in England. The
speedier utterly lacked personal inspira
tion and were kept within the lines dic
tated by the wire-pullers. Depression

PACIFIC ROADS' DEBTS.
The Joint Committee Is Working
Hard to Find a Way to
Settle Them.
Will Probably Report a Funding Bill
Similar to the Smith-Frye
Measure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 28.â The
joint committee of the Senate and House
is laboring industriously to reach a settle
ment of the Pacific roads debts problem.
They held another meeting to-day, with
all the members present except Suizer.
Chairman Powers of the House commit
tee said to The Call correspondent to
night: "At our meeting to-day we had
only an informal discussion in order to
get the views of individual members, but
reached no conclusion. No bill has yet
been prepared by our committee, nor have
we yet entered upon that work. Ido not
anticipate that we will have any difficulty
in reaching an agreement. The Call
statement that it has been decided by the
managers in the Senate and House to take
up the Pacific roads resolution and dispose
of it at this session of Congress is correct,
and we hope to have the matter settled
before Congress adjourn 3."
The Call correspondent, from talks had
with individual members of the Pacific
Roads Committee of both Senate and
House, reiterates the opinion heretofore ex
pressed that the bill reported will be prac
tically a funding bill drawn on the lines of
the Srcith-Frye bill. There is a disposi
tion manifest, however, to limit the time
to seventy-five years. The Reilly bill ex
tended the debt for fifty years and the
Frye-Smith measure for 100 years. It
seems probable that as a compromise the
time will be fixed at some point between
these figures. John Boyd, Huntington's
jighthand man, said to The Call corre
spondent that he believed tbe time would
be fixed at from sixty to seventy-five years,
with interest at 2 per cent.

HOHENLOHE MAY
SOON RETIRE.
Growing Discontent of the
Noted German Chan
cellor.
OPPOSED BY .WILLIAM.
The Prince Expected to Give Up
His Office About Next
Autumn.
POLITICS IN THE FATHERLAND
There Promises to Be a Struggle in
the Reichstag Over Civil Code
Amendments.
BERLIN, Germany, March 23.â Prince
Hohenlohe's discontent with his relations
with the Kaiser are reported to have been
expressed by him in the course of a con
versation with Herr Kickert, the leader of
the Radical Unionist party in the Reich
stag, at a recent banquet, when the Chan
cellor said that lie found increasing diffi
culty in getting the Emperor to approve
his line of action. Continuing, the Chan
cellor is reported to have told Herr Rick
ert that he did .not think he would be able
to retain office after autumn.
The .Berlin representative of the United
Press sought Herr Rkkert after hearing
this report and asked him in regard to it.
Herr Rickert denied that the report was
exactly accurate, but cautiously admitted
that it had the basis of truth.
'â¢Why,'' he said to the reporter, "men
tion autumn as the date of his retirement?
Prince Hohenlohe did not refer to autumn
at all."
The reporter suggested that the Chan
cellor might have suggested an earlier
period, but Herr Rickert maintained
reticence in regard to the matter, particu
larly as to the points in dispute between
the Emperor and the Chancellor, and, ex
cept to say that it would surprise no one
in political circles if the Chancellor should
resign immediately after the Emperor re
turned from his present tour, he would
tais no further on the subject.
Herr Rickert, alluding to the civil code
as the leading question before the Reich
stag, expressed himself as confident that
part of the code would be passed at the
present session of the Reichstag. The
coalition of the Centrists and Orthodox
Protestants, with the object of eliminating
from the code tfce civil marriage clause,
he did not think would be successful.
The reactionist proposals would not suc
ceed in getting a majority, and the Gov
ernment would not accept the amend
ments of the clericals. This is also the
course of opinion outside of Herr Rickert's
group. The Government in the meantime
will adhere firmly to the compulsory civil
marriage clause, but the Conservative mo
tion in favor of optional civil marriages
obtains many unexpected adherents and
may become the basis of a compromise.
The results of Germany's support of
England in Egypt as affecting the relations
between Russia and Germany are greatly
exercising the Bismarckian advocates of a
closer entente with Russia.
The Neuste Nachrichten expresses fear
that the attitude of Germany will lead to
a revival of the ill will of Russia toward
Germany and urges the Government to
take diplomatic measures to suppress the
Russian suspicions that Germany is sup
porting Great Britain, The paper adds:
"Germany ought to consistently follow
the German policy of consulting only Ger
man interest?, which are opposed to any
kind of conflict with Russia which is as
sociated with British interests."
The semi-official newspapers, on the
other hand, exercise great care in combat
ing the idea that Germany's action in
Egypt will involve a conflict with Russia.
The Hamburger Correspondenz says:
"Germany has supported England in
Egypt because her own interests are not
touched in doing so. Italy is likely to
reap the benefit of the Dongola expedition,
but will not interfere where German in
terests might be injuriously affected or the
peaceful aims of the Dreibund are injured."
The programme of the Kaiser's move
ments during the next month shows that
he will leave Italy for Vienna on A, Al 13,
and on At>ril 15 will go to Karlsruhe for a
season of woodcock shooting, remaining
there until April 19, wben he will go to
Coburg to be present at tne marriage of
the Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg to
Prince Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg,
which will take place April 20.
On April 22 he expects to go shooting
with the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar at
Wartburg and thence to Schlitz as the
guest of Count Goertz, where he will aeain
indulge in woodcock-shootine. His
Majesty will return to Berlin on May 1
and open the industrial Art Exhibition
on that day, and on May 2 he will open
the International Art Exhibition. On
May 10 the Kaiser, together with all of the
German sovereigns, will unveil at Frank
fort a monument to the memory of his
grandfather, Emperor William I.
J. B. Jackson, United States Charge
d'Affaires, dined at Potsdam on Thurs
day as thefguest of the Hereditary Prince

The statement was made in the Chicago
newspapers recently that Baron yon Der
Recke yon der Horst, Prussian Minister
of the Interior, had declared that Amer
ican insurance companies would soon be
readmitted to Prussia. This statement
â was wholly unfounded. The Minister of
the Interior, in response to inquiries,
states that ne has not yet received the re
ports of the subordinate councillor on the
merits of the question, and therefore has
not been able to give the matter considera
tion.
The Reicbsauzeiger publishes a decree
which affects the importation of . Amer
ican horses into Germany. During the
past year the practice has grown of im
porting horses into Germany from the
United States by the way of Holland.
Tne decree declares that all horses so
imported must be accompanied by a de
tailed pedigree and have the vise of a
Prussian veterinary surgeon and the per
mit of the district Governor.

HAJtJtl'l'T HAS MOPES.
Believes the Democrats Still Have a
Chance in the Coining Campaign.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 27.â A spe
cial to the Times from Washington says:
Chairman Harrity of the Democratic Na
tional Committee reached Washington
last night. He discussed National politics
in a way that conveyed his opinion that
the chances of the Democratic party in the
coming struggle are much better than the
Republicans are incliued to admit. He
thinks that the Democrats will nominate a
sound money man for President on a sound
money platform. He is not sure that this
course will be followed by'the Republicans
at St. Louis. It is significant to him that
the free silver Republicans appear to be
satisfied with the candidacy of McKinley,
and while be is by no means certain that
McKinley will be the Republican nominee,
it appears to him that if the Ohio man is
successful at St. Louis the sound money
men of the country will not turn to him.
The business interest, Mr. Harrity
thinks, will support the party and candi
date whose position on the currency ques
tion cannot be made a matter of dispute.
Pennsylvania, he said, will present the
name of ex-Goverr.or Pattiaon, and stand
by him as long as there shall seem to be
a possibility of his receiving the nomina
tion. Mr. Harrity will be very much sur
prised, he says, if the silver Democrats
bolt as a consequence of being defeated in
the convention. He sees increasing signs
that a sound money sentiment is growing
in the country, and apparently believes
that the Democrats who favor a strong
financial plank in the platform will have
little difficulty in carrying their point.
CUSTOMS INSTRUCTIONS.
Collectors' and Appraisers' Duties
Defined by the Treasury
Department.
To Remedy Perplexities That Are En
countered by Officials in the
Service.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 28.â The
Treasury Department has issued these in
structions to customs officers:
"As some perplexity appears to exist
among appraising and classifying officers
of customs as to the efiect of decisions ren
dered by the United States General Ap
praisers the department now instructs
such officers that appraisements of values
made by thg board under section 13 of the
act of June 10, 1890, are final and conclu
sive as to such values, and appraisers
should always be governed thereby in all
cases.
"Whenever a decision has been made by
the board under section 14 of the above
act in regard to the classification of any
kind of merchandise and no appeal has
been taken to the courts within the pre
scribed period under section 15 of the said
act, such decision will govern the liquida
tion of the particular case which was the
subject of the decision. In the absence of
such appeal and of contrary instructions
all similar goods will be treated in liqui
dation in accordance will the classification
established by the board. Should appeal be
taken by the Government against such de
cisions the classification will continue to
be made by Collectors in accordance with
that which was the subject of protest by
the importer.
"Due notice will be given of every appeal
and Collectors will thereafter be guided by
the judgment of the court.
"Whenever a protest has been filed
against the Collector's action and the final
decision of the court shall be in favor of
the claim made by the importer upon any
contention regarding the revenue laws,
reliquidation of the entries thereby af
fected will be made and duties wrongfully
exacted, if any, will be refunded, as pro
vided by existing regulations. While the
decisions of the board do not under the
law control any case except that which
was under review by the board, a proper
uniformity of procedure will be best pro
moted by the rules set forth above."
The department instructs Collectors that
no application to the courts for review
shall be made by them, except by the ex
pressed approval of the department.

HAWAII AND THE
WINE PRODUCERS
False Rumors of Increased
Duties Excite the Cali
fornians.
PORTUGUESE AND JAPS.
A Demonstration That Aroused
the Hostility of the Sugar
Planters.
DISGRACEFUL FLAG INCIDENT.
Stars and Stripes Soaked in Beer and
Trampled During a Midnight
Debauch.
HONOLULU. Hawaii, March 21.âRe
ferring to the excitement among Califor
nia wine-producera which was caused by a
reported intention to increase the Ha
waiian duties on California wines, Finance
Minister Damon on the 17tb in the Senate
put an end to the cause of the California
agitation by declaring: "There is abso
lutely no foundation for the report that
this Government has in contemplation
any advance in the duty on any American
products whatever."
The Portuguese residents in Honolulu
on the 18th celebrated a recent Portueuese
victory over blacks in South Africa by
mass at the cathedral and a procession
through the streets. The Independent
printed an incendiary article- declaring
the procession to be a hostile demonstra
tion against the Government. There ap
pears to be no truth in this.
The; Portuguese as a class are cordial
supporters of the Government. They
doubtless intended to assert their own
importance in opposition to the continued
Japanese immigration fostered by the
sugar-planters, which is extremely un
favorable to Portuguese laborers and me
chanics.
An act for the universal registration of
all persous in Hawaii, which is especially
intended to facilitate control of Asiatic
immigrants, is meeting unexpected opposi
tion from Minister Damon as being op
pressive and unfit for a free country.
Attorney-General Smith strongly sup
ported it. The measure is a popular one
with whites and natives.
Julien D. Hayne appeared in the Police
Court yesterday, charged with being a

precated all action for either opium license
or liquor reform as tending to a division of

OLD OLOttT nil. H M. ,-KIK
Soaked in Beer by Booty American
Youngsters.
HAWAII, Honolulu, March 27.âAl
though the incident happened as far back
as Tuesday, March 3, Honolulu has not yet
tired of gossiping over an insult to the
stars and stripes, in which several officers
of the United States army and navy were
mixed up in anything but an enviable
way. The affair happened at the Hotel
Richelieu, where three young American
tourists with more means than sense have
been staying, and in the room occupied by
them. Their names were Porter, Parker
and Barnsal, and they are described as
three unripe young Americans, who gained
their first notoriety in Honolulu by parad
ing the city in an elaborately decorated
wagonette on Washington's birthday.
On the occasion in question, which was
quite late in the evening, these young
bloods were having a little ''do" in their
rooms and the guests included Dr. Mur
ray, Bert Peterson, Dr. C. B. Cooper and
Captain Broome of this city, the latter be
ing a member of the National Guard of
Hawaii and on the staff of President
Dole; Lieutenant Lissak, U. S. A., who
came down with General Warfield's party :
Lieutenant Elliott, U. S. N., and Past
Assistant Surgeon Hibbett, U. S. N., both
of the Bennington, and Messrs. Hackett
and Grear, tourists, of Oakland, Cal.
The party were having an exceedingly
good time, and during a lull in the festivi
ties very small American flags were
handed out for the coat lapels. Dr. Mur
ray, who is a Canadian, and one or two
others declined the decoration. Nothing
was said of this. The room was not large
and was very crowded. Dr. Cooper and
Bert Peterson stretched out on one of the
beds and two others on the second bed.
A number stood, some about a table.
Porter went out after refreshments.
The story is that at this juncture Dr.
Murray, at least in plain sight of Elliott,
Lissak and Broome and perhaps of one or
two others, took one of the American flags
from the table, dropped it on the floor,
ground his heel into it and jumped upon
it. Why he did this no one undertakes to
explain. Those who were not under direct
obligation to resent the affront waited for
Elliott and Lissak to say something.
Elliott muttered some curses which were
indistinctly heard, and later, it is said, he
remarked to Dr. Murray that no further
insult to the American flag would be per
mitted. There was a coolness imme
diately, and considerable undertone com
ment, but the party did not break up for
three-quarters of an hour.
A continuation of the story is that an in
vitation to breakfast aboard the Benning
ton for the next morning was withdrawn
in a note to Dr. Murray, and that the lat
ter before leaving town for a circuit of the
island addressed an explanatory letter to
Ensign Blue of the Bennington.
The above account is the only one that
has been published, and as it has met with
no denial may be presumed to be substan
tially correct. Dr. Cooper in a short pub
lished card the next day after the affair
was made public said that his being there
was accidental, but made no statement as
to the flag incident. The three Americans
in whose room the affair happened have
left the country, as have the Benningtou
officers and Lieutenant Lissak, U. 8. A.,
and Captain Broome of our own National
Guard is now in San Francisco.
Dr. Murray has declined to be inter
viewed on the affair, but your correspond
ent is enabled to give his version of it. He
says that being a Canadian he courteously
but firmly declined to wear tbe flag, when
one member of the party proposed to pin
it on his coat by force, which was do
sooner said than done.
The doctor was grabbed by three or
four of those present and one of the flags
was pinned to his lapel. As soon as he
ould recover the use of his arms the doc
tor tore the flag from its fastening and
threw it on the table. He positively de
nies throwing it on the ground or stamp
ing on it or offering any indignity to the
flag other than has been described.
In the scuffle considerable beer was
spilled, and just as he threw the little Hag
on the table some one knocked over
another glassful, which went over the tlag,
and it was then thrown on the floor, but
by whom Dr. Murray will not state. In
fact, he says he does not remember. ThÂ©
Hag remained on the floor, soaked with
beer, in the presence of officers of tl|e
United States army and navy and a num
ber of United States citizens, an* in the
course of the three-quarters of an hour in
which the party were together after the
incident was probably unintentionally
trampled on by several of them.
To the Jocal press the only explanation
of the matter volunteered by Dr. Murray
is as follows: "I have no explanations .to
make. The twelve men in the room that
night did not take it np, and I do not see
why the community should do so."
Charles P. Bonsall, one of the three
hosts at the "affair of the flag," is very
much "cut up" over it. He did not see
the main incident â the trampling on the
banner. He says his attention was at
tracted when Lieutenant Elliott spoke
sharply to anticipate what he thought was
to be an affront to. the colors at and on the
table, and that a third party stepped be
tween Elliott and Dr. Murray.
Diright L. Wing Acquitted.
PARIS, France, March 28.â A verdict of
acquittal was to-day returned in the case
of Dwight L. Wing, the American who was
arrested about a year ago upon a charge of
having swindled "the Waeonlitz Company
of Paris. Wine was released shortly after
his ajrest on 5000 francs bail.
PREVENTED BY THE NURSE
Two Daring Attempts Made to
Kidnap the Son of Ralph
Modjeska.
Although Burned by Acid the Plucky
Maid Kept the Lad From Being
Carried Away.
CHICAGO, 111., March 23.â Twice with
in the last two weeks a young man, at
present unknown, Dut whom the police
expect to arrest soon, has made an at
tempt to kidnap Felix, the 8-year-old son
of Ralph Modjeska, son of the actress, in
the vicinity of the family's home on
Wrightwood avenue.
At the first attempt the nursemaid who
was in charge of the boy, taking him for
a walk, was badly burned with acid thrown
by the would-be kidnaper.
The suspected motive of the plotters has
not been made public owing to the illness
of Mme. Modjeeka, who, accompanied by
her husband, left for her California home
this week. The police are secretive about
the case.
The second attempt to abduct the child
occurred last Monday afternoon, and each
time the kidnaper seized and ran with
the child until compelled by the plucky,
screaming maid at his heels to let go and
escape.
There is to be an imposing christening
of a month-old baby in the Modjeska home
to-morrow, Mine. Calve, the prima donna,
acting as godmother and Jean de Reszke
as one of the attendants.
HISTORIC CHURCH BURNED.
Fifty Bui/dings Were Ablaze at One Time in
a High Wind at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire.
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., March 23.â The
Universalist church was burned this fore
noon. A gale of wind prevailed, and
sparks were carried a long distance. A
number of houses in the south end caught
fire, and a portion of the department had
to leave the church fire to save other build
ings. Between forty and fifty were on fire
at one time. Of this number the historic
Goodrich House, owned by Susan J. Went
worth, was destroweu. The church was
built in 1809, but had been remodeled
several times. The loss on other buildings
cannot at present be estimated. The bell
in the church was cast by Paul Revere of
Revolutionary fame, and weighed 2000
pounds.

ONE "VICTORY" IS EXPLODED.
Laborers on a Plantation Taken After
Buildings Occupied by Women
Are Bombarded.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 27 (via Rey
"West, Fia., March 28).â Immediately after
the landing of the Bermuda expedition,
Maceo. Calixto Garcia, and other leaders,
with a long string of pack mules, moved
southwest in the direction of the capital of
Pinar del Rio province. Rumors have been
current here two days that the city has
been attacked and captured. It is impos
sible to obtain definite news, the wires
being down.
General Weyler has sent nine columns
of troops, about 40,000 men, in pursuit of
Maceo. Ihe latter has 12,000 men and the
arms, ammunition and rapid-rire guns
landed by the Bermuda. The Government
is still silent in regard to Maceo's where
abouts. Other sources place him in Santa
Clara province, which was entered by the
rebels to-day. No official report of the
result of the attack has yet been made.
During the week half a dozen important
towns and cities were attacked.
The insurgents have taKen the offensive
since the Garcia and Collazo expeditions
arrived. Weyler's recent order declaring
small bands of insurgents in Havana and
Pinar del Rio provinces bandits is de
nounced by the Cubans, who say it opens
the way to wholesale slaughter. The
three brother Ferrar, American citizens
and owners of the Estrella coffee planta
tion near Alquizar, have filed a protest
with the Consul-General stating their resi
dence was bombarded with grape and can
ister, shattering the doors and windows,
on March 21, while occupied by their iami
hes only. Two small children were in the
house at the time. No insurgents were
present. The troops looted the wardrobes
and jewelry and money which were in the
house. Workmen were searched, and
twelve laborers were treated the same as
prisoners of war and a summary court
martial ordered. Ferrar claims damages.
General Bernal, commanding the trooo,
made an official report the next day,
describing a brilliant victory and dislodg
ing the enemy and capturing twelve
prisoners on the Jistrella plantation.
Domingo Betarte, a French citizen and
owner of the Oyalta estate, has arrived
here and filed a claim with the French
Consul for the destruction of his property
by Spanish troops. He describes the kill
ing of thirteen employes as previously re
ported. He says Durate, manager of the
estate, waa shot down while wrapped in
the French flag. Another Frenchman
named Drake, owner of the Saratoga
estate, has tiled a protest, claiming Colonel
Molina threatened to burn the buildings
and shoot all on tne estate in case Drake
failed immediately to notify him when
ever rebel bands passed near the planta
tion.
A ruob of 200 persons followed twenty
prisoners through the streets of Havana
Wednesday. The pinioned men were
struck, kicked and stoned. General
Ahumada dispersed the mob.
Yesterday 106 prisoners arrived from
Sagua. Weyler has ordered all stores
more than 2500 meters distant from towns
and hamlets closed and goods removed.
Rappeleye, correspondent of the New York
Mail and Express, was expelled by order
of â¢ General Weyler Thursday, on the
ground that his presence here was preju
dicial to the Government, his articles criti
cizing the troops and volunteers and army
operations creating a wronj* impression
abroad. Rappeleye observed all the rules
and regulations while here, apparently in
currinir displeasure entirely by treating
the war from an American rather than a
Spanish standpoint. J. Frank Clark.

NEW TO-DAY.
\jftt M^rs It isn't much trouble
man to be good hu-
mored. Jollity and exhuberant health
are a proverbial combination. The hearty
man who is always laughing doesn't
have any trouble with his digestion, It
has been said that laughing makes peo-
ple healthy. The truth is that health
makes people laugh.
There isn't any other thing so essential
to health as regularity in the action of
the bowels. Most all sickness starts with
some derangement of the digestive func-
tions. Good digestion means good, pure
blood, and that means strength. Once
let the bowels become clogged with
refuse matter, and the whole system is
deranged. Impure, poisonous matter
gets into the blood and plants the seeds
for all sorts of sickness.
Whenever there is a stoppage of the
intestinal action, help should be given
immediately. Usually a mild, gentle
laxative is all that is necessary. A vio-
lent, wrenching, griping cathartic 'is
never needed. Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pel-
lets are the most pleasant and successful
remedy for occasional or chronic consti-
pation, or costiveness. They are tiny,
sugar-coated anti-bilious granules that
even the smallest child can easily take.
They act in perfect accord with nature
and produce no griping or other disagree-
able feeling. They should be taken at
the first indication of digestive trouble.
They stop sour stomach, belching,
"heart-burn," flatulence and sick head-
ache. They cure constipation perma-
nently. You can stop taking them after
the bowels are thoroughly regulated.
Their help lasts. You do not become a
slave to their use as with other pills.

Great Britain Probably Backed in the

(Copyright, 1596, by the XeT York Times.]
LONDON, Esq., March 28.â The close
of the week finds Englishmen stiil striving
to believe that there must be some secret
bargain somewhere by which England is
not to be made an utter fool of in her for
eign adventures, but it grows increasingly
hard to preserve this sanguine mood. The
more people turn over the Soudan busi
ness in their minds the le*s they like it.
We hear now that Lord Cromer had actu
ally protested against it, and that a deter
mined effort is to be made next week to
compel the Ministry to cease shutting on
this point aiid tell the exact truth.
It is Leaking out, too, that the principal
military aurnorities here are openly
asainst the project, ana that only Sirdar
Kitchener and his staff, who sniff promo
tion in the desert air. really like the thing.
The older men :n the service clubs are now
all talking about the great risks to health
and Jffe. the probable big disaster and
the possibility of holding the Soudan even
after.. .it has been conquered, and even if
the fithting experts all took a hopeful,
eager view, the English would still feel
that they stood to lose more than they
could gain by the enterprise.
They might be reconciled in a reluctant
fashion to the- enterprise if it could be
ehown that sufficient provision baa De^n
made to secure their European flank in
* case their African front became crumpled
ur>. Of this, however, there is not tne
faintest sign. The German official papers
continue to abuse England and all things
Enziish and declare that Germany has
joined Austria and Italy in the matter of
releasing tbe Egyptian funds merely to
â  tnese allies, and hoids herself quite
free to stop this course at a later period
and even join England's opponents if it
seems to be to German interests to do co.
These statements might be ignored as
mere ill-tempered "blague'" if they were
addressed to British hearers alone, but
these German editors go to the lengths of
:gand bullying the Austrian press
for its pro-English leanings, and Berlin
I talked in this rude tone to Vienna
before since tne triple alliance was
founded.
There is an uneasy feeling, moreover, as
the Transvaal trouble, which seemed to be'
smoothing ii self over, is going to burst forth
a^rain worse than ever. No great appre
hension would be felt about this prospect,
perhaps, if the English felt sure that a
free hand would be left to them in South
Africa to meet whatever difficulties arose,
but if new disturbances occur there it is
practically certain that they will involve
. European complications. For instance, I
believe the truth is that England holds
the conditional consent of the King of
Portugal to sell Delagoa Bay and the
whole triangular block of Umhienga land
lying west and south of Limpopo, which
would draw a complete British girdle
around the Transvaal, but that King is
nervous about how his own Cortes and Ger
many wili take the announcement of the
bargain. If this Delagoa Bay bargain
comes off it is inevitable that Germany
will make an immediate row.
If any one of a dozen things happens in
which Krueger displays his inability or
unwillingness to withstand the tremen
dous anti-Enelish pressure of his burghers
and their German and Dutch backers it is
, hard to see how England can assert her
self without at once falling afoul of Ger
many, ev-en in the far East, where Russia
is now openly taking over Port Arthur and
putting into active operation all sorts of
projects of expansion which the English
have always sworn they would resist to the
death. It is a fact that Germany is Russia's
ally on the Pacific coast, which compels
the British to sit quiet and eat all their
brave words.
At the two point? on the map, then,
where English interests are the most
important and most gravely menaced
Germany is the enemy. At both points a
crisis is ''mminent and either may plunge
Englam ito the most arduous and serious
difficulties
This is plain enough to everybody, yet
to everybody's amazement this most
anxious moment is chosen for a fantastic,
meaningless campaign in the heart of the
desert, which, even it successful, can only
achieve results which nobody wants or
values, and which at the very outset
estranges and angers England's next-door
neighbor.
As was said at the start people try to
force themselves to believe that Lord Salis
bury has something up his sleeve, and
that Germany has really been put under
bonds to see England through this dark
sea of troubles on which she is embarking.
That would be distasteful no doubt, for
the Germans are at a savage popular dis-
count just now in British minds, but at
least would render the situation intelligi
ble; but weeks go on and bring nothing but
indications that no such defensive bargain
fja~ been struck, and people grow aghast
at the possibility that England is to be
caught in another Khartoum tragedy, this
time with enemies on both sides instead
of one.
The public suspense has not found voice
yet simply berause the mystery is so bope
:..j gratuitous that it seems incon- 1
ceirabfa tiiat a:i explanation should not
be forthcoming day by day, but it is in
cr'asirif.' in volume and in intensity and
the roar trM burst out soon.
A French ministerial collapse at such a
juncture in international politics would
i>e unusnally exciting. It is not so clear
as might be wished that this will not come
ext week in the remaining struggle over
the budget, but I am inclined to the belief
â he bourgeois Cabinet weathered its
n . t storms in the narrow straits of the
in omc-tai divisions Thursday. It had
no votes to spare, but an analysis of its
backers shows a fairly homogenous body
who ought to hold together in Monday's
final tussle. If they fail something more
than the fate of the Ministry is not un
likely to be pitched into the melting pot.
In other words, there will be a dead set to
drive Faure from the Elysee as well.
What effect Berthelot's retirement will
have on the possible crisis it is difficult to
guess. So long as England played the
game of Frencn reconciliation, he seemed
to be the ideal foreign Minister, but the
emergency of England's sudden shifting
found him lacking in diplomatic expe
rience and calm, and the French politi
cians seeing that he was. after all, only an
amateur began bumping on him. So
Bourgeois had been compelled to throw
him overboard.
The Germans have been having their
fill lately of quarter-century celebrations,
and have yawned perceptibly over some of
them, but none fell to the same level of
public contempt as the twenty-fifth anni
versary of the first session of the Reichs
tag. It was only after a prodigies amount
of correspondence and bargaining that a
majority of the members could be induced
to meet one another at a formal banquet,
and the only toasts that they agreed to
ailow wtre to the Emperor and to Bis
marck, wno may hardly be said to typify
the triumph of the parliamentary idea of
popular interest in the event.
There was not the slightest sign, and the
press comment on the thing was almost
universally disdainful. Eugene Richter,
in the Freisinniee Zeitung, says that after
twenty-rive years of the Reichstag Ger
many is more split and divided by fac
tions, jealousy and hatreds than it was tie
fore the empire was founded, and nobody
contradicts him.
Bismarck's specific ailments are not
more active than usual, but his general
strength is failing, and his eighty-first
birthday, Wednesday, will be kept very
quietly. Only a torchlight march of the
Hamburg Society is to be permitted in
siue the Friedrichsruhe grounds this year,
all the other organized pilgrimages being
warned off.
The vast crowds which gathered in the
streets of Constantinople this week to
watch the arrival of Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria and his subsequent public move
ments have surprised everybody who
knows Stamboul. They are said to have
iar exceeded anything in any une's recol
lection.
No one suggests a satisfactory theory of
its special meaning, but the fact itself im
pressed the imagination. The Sultan has
paid extraordinary honor to his visitor,
who will return to Sofia with a recognized
dynastic position, and apparently with a
Ru sso-Turkish mandate to co ahead and
make of h;mself the biggsst man in the
Balkans. It is said that in Stamboul the
Turks pointed him out to one another as a
prince who some day would be ruling
them and hearing the Greek mass in St.
Sotia. That Ferdinand would cut the Sul
tan's throat as readily as Stain buloff's
need not be doubted, and that his ambi
tions reach to the Bosphorus may be
taken for granted, but, be he ever so able
and audacious, Russia is more capable and
merciless still and when she has used him
to her needs she will break him like a reed.
If the medical faculty were recognized
enemies of the human race there could
hardly be a louder expression of general
joy than is called fort a by the jury's ver
dict yesterday of $60,000 damages against
the eminent and fashionable Dr. Playfair
for using knowledge obtained by profes
sional examination to discredit and im
poverish the poor lady wQo is his wife's
sister-in-law and had an allowance from
his wife's family. The development of
the case during the week excited all Eng
land, and it is hard to say wtiether the
revelations of treacherous meanness inside
ihe Piavfair family or the spectacle of
some of the most famous physicians in
London coming up one by one supporting
Dr. Playfair through thick and thin most
disgusted the enraged public. The dam
ages are by far the heaviest on record for
slander, but the jury arrived at the sum
by capitalizing at 3' 2 per cent the allow
ance of $2000 which Dr. Playfair's perfidy
robbed Mrs. Kitson of, and it is hard to
see how an appeal can upset that. It
should be added that the verdict is every
where taken as meaning not only that Dr.
Playfair's ethics are abominable, but that
his professional diagnosis which imputed
dishonor to tLe plaintiff is no good.
I suspect that if human motives could
be laid bare it would be discovered that
there is prevalent here just now a popular
anger against doctors in general, directly
due to the arbitrary muzzling iaws and
the consequent wholesale slaughter of dogs,
which we owe to a panic about rabies
stirred up by the medical press. Within
the past three months nearly 18,000 dogs
have been asphyxiated and cremated at
the dogs' home in Battersea alone, and
similar butchery is going on all over the
country. As Englishmen love dogs rather
more than they do their own children â or
at least are more solicitous about tneir
diet and comfort â this harrying of pets
amounts to a national grievance, and nat
urally the blame for it is put on the doc
tors, who, it is said, spread entirely fabu
lous reports of hydrophobia for their own
benefit. Indeed, half of the people in
England seem to be coming around to the
belief that there is no such disease at all.
Speaking of dogs, an ex-Cabinet Minis
ter, who knows the Queen very well, told
;ne the other day that she takes the keen
est interest in this Battersea dogs' home
and in similar institutions, and that she is
especially vehement in antagonism to
vivisection. Of his own knowledge, he
said, whenever an anti- vivisection society
seemed to be lagging in it 3 public propa
ganda, its noble chairman got a personal
letter from the Queen stirring it up to
fresh exertion?.
During the week local census papers
have been distributed by the police and
other enumerators throughout the admin
istrative district of London, which are to
be collected Monday, and- are expected to
show the whole number of living persons
inside the metropolis at midnight to-mor
row. The census is limited to sex, and
whether Douseholder, Jodger or servant,
and the numbers of houses is also to be re
corded. The object i? to secure statistics
for a municipal rearrangement of taxes,
and is in the hands of the Registrar-Gen
eral and of local registrars, who combine
the functions of surrogates and county
clerks, and the returns are expected to be
compiled by the cad of April. It being
passover time a special clause of the act
provides that Jews may withhold their pa
pers if they wish till Tuesday.
A more comprehensive census of all
France is to be taken to-night. This is the
quinquennial count of which I have spoken
before as being awaited with much patri
otic anxiety, as it is almost certain to re
veal meiancholv facts about the French
population, which for the tirst time is ex
pected to be less than that of the British
islands. For the first time, too, it will put
on the census record the fact that the Eng
lish sovereign and three of her children
are on French soil, not to mention the
King of the Belgians, the Dowager Empress
of Russia aud the Czarowitch, and an ex
ceptionally large n amber of other foreign
royal personages now in the Riviera. It
is feared, however, that this will not be

Americans are as much interested as
those directly concerned in the decision
reached yesterday at the Boulogne traffic
conference to initiate a new and additional
fast service via Folkestone between Paris
and London, the trains to leave each capi
tal at 4 p. m., the passengers reaching the
other side at 11:30 the same evening. Im
portant reforms will be made on both
sides of the channel to facilitate the trans
fer of baggage, and the promised service
will be a model one.
George H. Boughton's election to full
honor as a royal academician is the most
popular thing that the academy has done
for a long while. He would have achieved
it years ago had it not been for his sweet
good nature in standing out of the way for
younger men, to whom distinctions signify
more than to him, and in always lefusing
to make a strenuous, embittered personal
question of his selection. He reaps his re
ward now in seeing everybody rejoice at
his preferment, not only because he is one
of the foremost painters of England, but
also one of the soil of the earth at large.
At last night's quarterly dinner of the
Omar Khayyam Club, where Hardy.
Holman, Hunt, Bryce and many other
lights were gathered, a letter was read
from Swinburne, who never goes to pub
lic places nowadays, but who has numer
ous interesting things to say of Fitzger
ald's immortal translation. As to the
greatness of the poem he says: "I know
none to be compared with it for power,
pathos and beauty in the same line of
thought and work, except possibly Ec
clesiates, and magnificent as that is I
can hardly think its author comparable to
Omar either as philosopher or poet." In
the same letter he recounts how in 1860 he
and Rossetti bougnt tne first editions of
this great work at a bookstall for a penny
each, they having fallen absolutely dead
at the published price of one shilling.
Now they are scarce at $S.

ON THE VERGE OF A WAR
Bitter Feeling Caused in a
Louisiana Parish by a
Shooting.
Politicians Call at the House of a
Negro and Two Deaths
Quickly Follow.
NEW ORLEANS. La., March 28.â St.
Andry parish, in the western part of this
State, is almost in a state of war. Last
evening while a part}- of white men from
Arnaudville were passing on the public
road near the house of Julien Stelly, a
colored man, in the neighborhood of Port
Barr, rive of them turned aside and called
him out to have a talk with him. He had
used some threatening language to the
effect that he intended to register and
vote if he died in the attempt. Seeing
that would be against the wishes of the
white people of that section, he had sent a
message by another colored man to Dr.
Martin, the leader of the white supremacy
movement of that neighborhood, apologiz
ing for his words and promising to taKe no
part in Dolitics in the future.
The purpose in calling at Mb bouse last
night was to assure him that his promises
and' apology had been accepted and that
he might feel secure. He refused to open
his door or parley with the men, saying
that if Dr. Martin would come that way
he would come out and talk with him.
Dr. Martin then came and called to him
to come out and talk with him; but in
stead of doint; so, he opened a side window
and instantly shot dead Alcoe Bouett, a
resident of Grand Coteau and an excellent
citizen and young man of 10 years of age.
The men on the outside thereupon fired
into the house, killing Stelly and probably
one other negro. This is Dr. Martin's
statement of the occurrence. He is the
leading physician of that section and a
gentleman of the highest standing.

OLD SCENES REPEATED.
An Immense Crowd Witnesses
the Struggle Between the
Varsity Crews.
CAMBRIDGE AGAIN DEFEATED.
This Is the Seventh Consecutive Beat
ing Administered by the Cham
pion Oarsmen.
LONDON, Exg., March 2S.â The annual
rowing contest between the Oxford and
Cambridge eights took place over the
course from Putney to Mortlake to-day in
tne presence of the usual crowd of Lon
doners and provincials, and was won by
Oxford by a quarter of a Jength. The
weather was extremely disagreeable. At
10 o'clock the wind was blowing hard and
the rain was falling in torrents. This con
dition was followed by glimpses of sun
snine, but several times later there were
heavy hailstorms of short duration.
The length of the course was four and a
quarter miley. The boats got off at 1:03
p. m. Cambridge was pulling forty-eight
strokes the lirst minute and at the soap
works led by a half length. At Hammer
smith bridge Cambridge still held her lead
of a half length and at ChiswicK she was
nearly a length ahead.
From tbis point, however, Oxford be
gan to gain, and, nearing the bridge, drew
rapidly up on the leaders, who had lost
more than half of their advantage and
were only three-quarters of a length ahead.
In shooting the bridge Cambridge was
hampered by the rough water and failed
to maintain her lead. Oxford gradually
crept up on the Cambridge boat.
The Oxford boat from this point drew
ahead and reached the Ship Hotel at Mort
lake, the finishing point, a winner by a
quarter of a length, adding one more to
Oxford's list of six consecutive victories,
while Cambridge has won a varsity race.
The uaual cheers and screeching of whis
tles greeted the victorious crew, and the
usual scenes in other respects were en
acted. Only for slight differences made
by the weights, one year's show along ihe
Thames championship course from Put
ney to Mortlake is exactly like another.
Following are the crews and the last
weights posted, but the men were each
about a pound and a half lighter at the
start than these indicated.
Oxfordâ J. J. Deknoops (new), bow, 159
pounds; C. K. Phillips (new), 172; E. C.
Sherwood (Magdalen), ISO; C. D. Burnell
(Magdalen), 191; E. R. Balfour (Univer
sity), 190; R. Carr (Magdalen), 178; W. E.
Crumps (new), 171.
Cambridgeâ T. B. Hope (Trinity Hall),
bow, 155 pounds; H. A. Game (first
Trinity), 175; D. Pendington (Caius), 174;
R. Y. Bonsey (Lady Margaret), 180; W. A.
Bieber (Trinity Hall), l-O; T. J. G. Dun

Hall), 170; W. J. Fernie (Trinity Hall),
stroke, 170; T. R. Paget-'fomlinson
(Trinity Hall), coxswain. 117.
This is the seventh consecutive defeat
administered by Oxford to the rival uni
versity of Cambridge, and not since 1891
has the latter club given the winners so
close a race. In 1891 Oxford won by a
quarter of a length, as it did to-day, the
intervening races having been won by
from onÂ« and a half to three and a half
lengths. In the last twenty years the
time made to-day, 20:01. has only been
beaten twice. In the race of 1892 Oxford
won by two and a quarter lengths in 19:21,
and in 1893 she won by two and a half
lengths in 18:47.

AGAINST SANTA MONICA
Southern California Opposed to

Privileges.
TO STAY HUNTINGTON'S HAND.
Delegates in Washington Urged to
Defeat the Southern Pacific's
Scheme.
LOS ANGELES, Cxi.; March 28.â The
action of the House Rivera and Harbors
Committee in bowing to Collis P. Hunt
ington by deciding to report an appro
priation for Santa Monica Harbor had the
effect of spurring to spirited action the Los
Angeles Free. Harbor League, which was
organized in opposition to the attempt of
the Southern Pacific Company to monop
olism harbor privileges and facilities adja
cent to Los Angeles. At a meeting of the
league at the Chamber of Commerce this
afternoon, called to head off the machina
tions of Huntington, the following resolu
tions, proposed by Colonel 11. G, Otis, were
adopted after an animated discussion:
Whereas The matter of the securing of an
adequate harbor for the Los Angvles coast la
of the first Importance to all the people and
the com men Ea? Interests of this city ami South
â  m California^ an.i whereas, we believe there
is no prospect that Congress will appropriate
money for two harbor sites on this coast within
a few miles of each other; and whereas, the
harbor site at San Pedro has been repeatedly
officially and exclusively recommended by the
boards of I'nttod States army engineers as the
proper site for a permanent harbor for- Los
Anpeles, and is the site for which Congress lia.s
thus far made appropriations: and whereas,
appropriations are not granted in Congres
sional Districts In the face of opposition by the
representatives of such districts;
JiesoUnl.Vy the Free Harbor League of Lot
Angeles that we reattirni our allegiance to Ban
Vetlro as the true and proper, site, us the peo
ple's as Well as !!u< Government's site for
farther harbor improvements, and that we are
opposed to all legislation. .lf any such is con
templated by Congress, inconsistent with this
purpose so supremely essential to the business
Interests and commercial advantages of
Southern California.
Rtsolwd, That copy of. thtti resolutions be
ofllcially transmitted to the California Sena
tors and Representatives in Concrete, with the
request that they ad in accordance to the full
extent of their powers.
A. letter from Representative Hermann
of Oregon to President Patterson of the
Chamber of Commerce was road in which
that gentleman; writing under the date of
16, said :
â¢ At this hoar I have succeeded Ineacariosj
for Wilmington the continued system, which
means the immediate securing tor that place
of the entire $392,500 and the prompt com
pletion of the whole project. â¢* ' * Santa
Monica secures the same advantage. The
amount for completion, however, is much
larger. *-â *â¢-.* I for one desire to bring to a
happy conclusion the antagonism between
your two harbors, which has grown out of the
apprehension that one place might be reeog
nited by the Government to discrimination
against the Other. I wish that both shall have
the same iriendty treatment to the full extent
Of the maximum estimate! of both.
This solicitude on the part of Mr. Her
mann to heal the breach between San
Pedro and Sar.t.i Monica created some
what of â  breeze, as it was understood by
the committee recently sent tC Washing
ton in behalf Of San Pedro by the Free
Harbor League that Mr. Hermann fully
understood the situation here and would
use his best efforts to help San Pedro, be
cause it is the people's harbor. Colonel
Otis, speaking on thiÂ« subject, said:
"Mr. Hermann was, we thought, one of
our warmest friends. He questioned us
closely and drew out our best presentation
of the case. He said nothing about Santa
Monica before the committee, but at oar
hotel asked us if we were fighting Santa
Monica. We said we could not believe
that an - â  nation could be made for
two contiguou* places; that San Pedro
was the people's site and the Govern
ment's site.
"He said nothing, but it seems that he
later took the greatest interest in securing
money for both places, although we ex
plained to him thai is not what the people
here wanted. The Huntington inrlaence
has been strong enough 10 work this
through. One or both of the appropria
tions will be attacked. What the outcome
Will be I know not,"
General Charles Forman, Hon. T. E.
Gibbon, vice-president of the Terminal
Railway, and others spoke on the resolu
tions offered by Colonel Otis. Mr. Gibbon
said that it Santa Monica was given any
appropriation "the game was up" : that if
any sod) appropriation was secured it
couM be aone only through fraud and
chicanery. After the resolution was
adopted an adjournment was taken until
explanations supposed to be on the way
from Senator White and Representative
afoLachlan are reciered.

. LOS ANGELES, Cai.. March 25.â Ed.
Booth ended his life with a revolver bullet
yesterday M El Monte. Booth came to
El Monte one year ago last September and
applied for worK to the Cnmmings Bros.,
who are now undei sentence of death for
murder. For a snort time he did odd job?
about the ranch, and then took op his
abode in the cabin where he eventually
ended his existence.
While Booth was visiting the Cum- 1
mings' house last Saturday, bit cabin was '
broken into. He was not "rXade aware of !
the fact until Wednesday. When he heard
of it, he stated to three* different persons
that the thieves had taken some books and
papers that, should ttiey fall into the
hands of Americans, would put him into
a had predicament. A diary was found
giving the names of acids used in dissolv
ing metals, as well as a list of metals used
by eipert counterfeiters, and it Is surmised
that Booth was either in the counterfeiting
business, or that he was in with some gang.
The deceased was about 55 years of age

IN JAIL AT PORTLAND
A Squatter Who Believes That
President Cleveland Will
Liberate Him.
Intends to Remain a Prisoner Until
tho Executive Comes to the
Rescue.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 28.â Adolph
Mehri m;!* a squatter on th* land of the
Oregon and California Railroad in South
Portland. Being ordered by the I'nited
States COari to vacate, he refused, claim
ing the railroad company had no title to
the land. The matter was explained to
him and the absurdity of his position
shown; but nothing that could be said
altered the squatter's determination, and
eleven days ago Judge Bellinger was
forced to commit Mehrl to prison for con
tempt i>f court.
'When are you coniins: out?" he was
asked this morning.
"Well," answered the prisoner in a
strong German dialect, "they're pretty
busy at Washington now setting ready for
I the election, but I think President Cleve
i land and the German Minister will have
ray papers ready by next week."
"What have the President and German
Minister to do with your case?"
The squatter looked surprised.
'Tin Adolph Mehrl, ain't II I'm an
â  American citizen. Cleveland knows that,
I doesn't he? The German Minister knows
| I was born in Bavaria. Do ! you suppose
fora moment they are overlooking me?
I It I hadn't come to* jail it might be differ-
I ent; but now that I'm here tney've got to
I get me out like any other citizen impris
'â¢ oned against his right:*."
"Uut suppose you are disappointed and
the people at Washington pay no atten
tion to your incarceration, how long do
you propose staying here?"
"11l not be disappointed. This is a big
case. 1 know the company has no title to
my land, for a man in Oregon City told
me so, and when the Government knows
that 1 am in jail it will send on here pretty
quick and put all the people back OB the
land that have been driven off. It's a
good thine for the other people that built
houses in the gulch that I was arrested."
"Then you believe that you have been
specially * selected to right the alleged
wrongs of the squatters and propose to
stay with your land at all hazards?"
â¢ Yes. no matter what happens, I will
nevei say that 1 will vacate my land. It
jis my home, and everybody knows it. If
I the election prevents the people at Wash
ington from acting quickly, the citizens
here are waiting to lie.p me."
So thoroughly imbued is Mehrl with the
idea that his case is of paramount im
portance to the Government, and that the
attention of the entire United States has
been attracted toward him, that it is possi
ble he may remain in jail for years before
the fact that he is of small interest and
has been forgotten dawns upon him.
MOUNT TAMALPAIS ROAD WORK.
Rapid Progress Made by the California
Construction Company's Force of
Laborers.
MILL VALLEY, Cai,., March 28.â H0
time is being lost in the construction of
the Mill Valley and Mount Tanialpais
Scenic Railway. The first carload of
material was hauled across Blythedale and
Corte Madera avenues on Wednesday at 1
o'clocE, and the third rail for the narrow
gauge car of the North Pacific i Coast] road
has been laid as far as the proposed power
house on the Cnsning tract.
It is now stated that the depot will be
on the Mclnnes property, in Mill Valley
instead of on the lands of the North Pacific
Coast Railroad at Eastland station. This
will avoid the necessity of crossing Blythe
dale avenue during the day time, as all the
freight and.coal lor the power-house will !
be transported in the nigh; time.
The contempt proceedings against the
Mountain road and the California. Con
struction Company will be heard by Judge
Angelotti on Monday. Sidney B. Cashing.
Louis 1.. James, John Burt and others
have prepared affidavits to the effect that
the road was run on Corte Madera avenue
for only sixty feet, and that the workmen
did not know -they were laying the rails on ;
any of the lands upon wtiicn the injunc
tion forbade them. Mr. Windmiller, the
plaintiff in the injunction suit, will prob
ably not press the matter.
The construction company estimates
that the expense per day while the in- j
junction was in force was $2CO, and the in
junction blocked the work for four days, !
Including Sunday. It has not been de
cided as yet whether to brine suit against
Winamilier for this amount or not. .There
is serious talk about it, and if it is done ]
Windmiller will sue the company in turn !
for alleged damages to his property on ac- <
count of the road running on Madera i
avenue.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
BRIBERY CHARGED
AT SACRAMENTO.
Strife Over a Bituminizing
Contract Ends in a
Sensation.
TRUSTEE KENT'S STORY.
Says He Was Offered Money
for the Smuggling In of
Another Bid.
WILL NOT NAME THE CULPRIT.
Efforts of an Alleged San Francisco
Rock Combine to Monopolize
State Work.
SAGBAMENTO, Cal., March 28.-At the
meeting of the Hoard of City Trustees on
Monday night, the contract lor bituruin
izing the streets surrounding the Capitol
was let to James Touhey, a Sacramento
contractor, for the sum of |60,399 9(>, his
hid being some $2000 less than those of his
San Francisco competitors. Since that
time (ieorsre I'erine, who failed to put in a
bid before the City Trustees, has been en
deavoring to have considered one $2000 less
than that of Touhey's. This matter having
been brought to the attention of the Capi
tol Commissioners, they met to-day in con
junction with the Board of City Trustees,
and a stormy session was the result.
The proposition was advanced by the
members of the alleged San Francisco
rock combine tuat ttie State, owning one
| half i>f the frontage could, with the co-oy
eration of one-half of the property-own
ers, take the letting of the contract from
the hands of the city and award it to
others: and as the work would be done
I for $2000 less than Touhey's price, that in
dividual would be "frozen out' 1 and pre
vented from entering into the business of
bituminous street laying in competition
with members of the alleged rock coin
| bine.
The session was essentially a tropical one
and no definite conclusion was arrived at.
During one of the numerous discussions
which arose. Trustee Kent stated tuat the
members of the combine were extremely
anxious to beat Touhey, and that he had
been approached by an individual who had
said there was $800 for some one if another
bid could bo placed.
"Did you have that man arrested?" de
manded the Governor.
"Oh, no," answered Kent. "These kind
of things don't amount to anything."
The Governor wanted to know who the
man was, but Kent did not wish to expose
him.
"\ou know how it is, Governor," he
taUL
â¢ No, I don't," answered the Governor.
"I have never been approached myself,
but I want to know wno the fellow was
\\ ho wanted to pay a City Trustee $000 for
an opportunity to get in a bid."
Set 'retary of State Brown was in favor of
standing by Touhey 's contract. In speak
ing on the subject he said: "This man
Touhey has underbid these otner con
tractors and is a responsible man. Now
that thty are beaten they 'squeal.' 1 am
in favor of awarding him the contract
privately, so that ho ran give a bond that
hi* work will last at least live years.' 1
When personally interviewed on the
subject Touhey said: "There is no doubt
in my mind but that this combine of San
Francisco rock men will so to great
lengths to prevent rue getting this con
tract, as they know that if 1 once get a
foothold in this < !aÂ«s of work they will
never be able to compete with me again in
Sacramento. They have even advanced
the argument that I had no machinery to
work with. That is true, but I have
plenty of money with which to purchase
â¢t. After the rtme for placing bids last
Monday had expired I was approached by
one of the members of the combine who
desired to know what my price was. I
told him and then, I understand, an
attempt was made to have another
Did smuggled in. I was informed that
inferences were made that an attempt
might be made to bribe Mr. Diruond, clerk
ot the board, but that gentleman's honesty
was beyond cavil, and, besides, it was
found that any attempt to approach him
would result in prompt bodily injury to
Uu party making the attempt, so the
scheme had to be abandoned. 1 have also
heard that it was claimed that immense
influence was brought to bear upon the
Capitol Commissioners in favor of the rock
combine: still, as I made my bid in good
faitn and have the wherewithal to back it,
I am sure the Capitol Commissioners will
be just and not reopen the bids. Once be
fore I made members of this combine re
duce their price on a contract so that it
resulted in a saving of $4000 to this city. '
It was tinally agreed that Secretary of
state Brown and Treasurer Radcliff be i
appointed a committee of two to consult
with an attorney as to the legality of en
tering into a private contract, and also
whether Marsden Manson of the Bureau
of Highways could be appointed to act
without compensation as engineer of the
work en the part of the State.

BRINGS OVER THE OLIVE BRANCH.
Mrs. Booth-Tucker Arrives at New York
From London and Is Royally
Welcomed.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 28.â Mr*.
Booth-Tucker, wife of Commander of
the Salvation Army D. L. Booth-Tucker,
recently appointed by General Booth from
the National headquarters in London to
take charge of the Salvation Army in this
country, arrived to-day on the American
line steamer St. Louis. She was accom
panied by her son and daughter, her sec
retary and Major J. Malan, General
Booth's secretary.
Mrs. Booth-Tucker received a royal wel
come when she reached the steamship
pier, as many members of the Salvation
Army had gathered there to greet her.
Mrs. Booth-Tucker was to have been ac
companied bore by her husband, but the
latter left the ship off the English coast on
a pilot-boat and returned to his sick son.
"When asked if she had Drought the olive
branch to Ballington Booth, she replied:
"We of the Salvation Army bring the
olive branch everywhere. We bring the
olive branch to Ballington Booth and
every one else. I am sure that my dear
brother will be as glad to see me as I will
be to see him. I love him dearly and it
will oe the happiest day of my life when
1 have succeeded in bringing him back to
the army, even as it wa9 the most sorrow
ful when I heard that he had lett it."
She was then asked if the statement was
true that should Ballington Booth come
back the general would assign him to
Canada, and then, after two or three
months, reappoint him as commander in
the United States.
She answered that she thought such a
statement was unauthorized, but so far as
she knew and believed such was not tho
intention of General Booth.
"It has always been my firm conviction,"
she continued, "that had my brother seen
the eternal foe only rive minutes his resig
nation from the Salvation Army would
never have occurred. It is my desire still,
as it is that of the general, that there shall
be a personal talk between them, and I
i'eel sure that he will no longer be outside
of the army."
THAT BODY IN THE TRUNK.
It is Now Identified as That of Oliver Pike.
Who Disappeared From Seattle
Three Years Ago.
CHICAGO, 111., March 28.â Mw. Theo
dore Moshier of Kavenswood, a suburb of
Chicago, called at the County Morgue to
day, and claimed that the body of the
murdered man found in the unclaimed
trunk was that of Oliver Pike of Seattle,
vVash. He disappeared from that city
three years ago, and was tnen 29 years of
age. His mother lives in F%yette, Ohio.
Pike wore a truss, as did the murdered
man. and the peculiar formation of the
teeth, as described by Mrs. Moshier, match
the teeth of the corpse.
The police do not pin their faith to the
latest claim of identification, but are in
vestigating all such clews. A telegram
was sent to the Chief of the Salt Late
police, asking for investigation of the dis
appearance of Keidy, supposed to have
been murdered by an Knglishman. The
Coroner's inquest began to-day, and was
adjourned to next Tuesday after the evi
dence to date had been submitted.

PORTLAND MURDER PLOT
"Bunko" Kelly Believed to Be
About to Make a Full
Confession.
May Tell of the Conspiracy That
Resulted in the Brutal Kill
ing of Sayres.
PORTLAND, Or., March 25.-The aban
donment of Lawyer X. N. Steeves by the
heir to the W. O. Allen estate, who by
withdrawing from Steeves' bond has re
consigned the lawyer to the county jail,
pending his securing a new surety or his
next trial, is ominous. The oft-made state
ment that "Bunko" Kelly, Steeves' con
federate and the principal living actor in
the murder of Georg6 W. Sayres on a dark
night in the latter part of September, 1894,
was on the point of disclosing some ma
terial facts implicating others in the crime
is now confidently looked for at an early
date.
It is said that since Steeves' abandon
ment by the brother of the man having
had the greatest interest in the disappear
ance of Sayres, Kelly has given up all
hope of any assistance from the outside to
secure a pardon. If permitted so to do
by the State Prison authorities, a pretty
reliable rumor has it, he will relate the
history of that cold-blooded murder of an
inoffensive man from the incipiency of the
crime until the body of Sayrew was cast
into the Willamette River, only to rise a
few days later in ghastly evidence against
his mercenary assassins. Kelly, it is said,
when he begins to talk, will not omit an
incident attaching to that tragedy.
A statement was made last night that
while Kelly was lying in the county jail,
awaiting trial, he' in a confidential "moad
one night remarked to a felMw-prisoner
that if it were necessary $50,000 would be
expended to save him from the hangman's
rope. The inference was that Allen was
the man to make so great a pecuniary
sacrifice. Allen was not a philanthropist,
as every one knows, hence Kelly must
hare had a wonderfully strong srrapp on
the old man. The story goes that while
Kelly was quite sick recently he greatly
exaggerated his condition in the hope that
those he was shielding might put forth
s.nno extraordinary efforts in his behalf.
This faith was strongest during Allen's
lifetime, but was not altogether abandoned
after his sudden taking off. Kellv must
have believed that the olcl n\an had taken
his brother, the heir to his estate, into his
confidence, and that the latter might come
to his rescue. Now, though, since the
heir has surrendered the alleged chief con
spirator in the crime to the authorities by
declining to longer remain on his bond,
Kelly has reached the conclusion that he
need hope for no executive clemency.

BKATTLE, Wash., March 2s.â The
Alaska rush has developed a good market
in this city for cur dogs. A good-sized
canine, no matter how common the breed,
will bring from slo to f4o. For two month*
dozens of dogs have been shipped north
on each steamer, until Seattle's supply has
grown exceedingly short. They are used
m Alaska as beasts of burden.
Tne steamer Al Xi, which sailed this
morning, had no less than tifty canine pas
sengers. They were purchased by and
were in charge of persons who propose to
establish a trading station in the interior,
the dogs to be used for sledging in supplies.
Aside from their usefulness as beasts of
burden and draueht animals, they are fre
quently killed and eaten when other food
is not available. Several of the tirst drove
of canines sent to Alaska last December
to sledge in the mails were killed and eaten
dv their owners when confronted by star

SANTA EOSA, Cal., Marca 28.â 1n
Â» :e of the precautions taken since the
r-cent attempt to loot the ballot-box in
which the coin-laden votes for carnival
queen candidates are deposited, another
raid has been made upon the polling
booth. This time practical jokers were
the culprits, and, instead of attempting to
take away the little envelopes, they con
tributed a few score of them. "When the
large ballot-box was opened to-niglit to
count the votes the committee was agree
ably surprised to rind it rilled to a depth of
sii inches. The names on the top en
velopes appeared to be all in the same
handwriting, and showed a liberal disre
gard for favorites, some of the ladies voted
for being unknown in the contest.
On being opened each of these envelopes
was found to contain a round pewter
medal, about the size of a half dollar,
showing on one side the smiling faces of
Grover Cleveland and Adiai Stevenson
and on the other a picture of the White
House. Hereafter the box will be eOarded
from thieves, wags and stuffers by Henry
Haliman and a iaree redwood club, though
"repeaters" witn legitimate ballots will be
welcomed.
In addition to the bogus ballots there
were a good many envelopes containing
good coin of the realm and the result of
the count showed that Mrs. L. W. Burns
had wrested the lead from Mi?s Sara Hall.
ihe erstwhile leader had also gained
during the day, but not enough to retain

the result. The suspicions quietness in the
balloting is believed to be the calm that
precedes the storm. Every one seems to
be holding back to see if his or her favorite

lack of interest in the contest, but each
faction seems to be waiting for the other
to move.
W. H. Grissum, a veteran fireman of

I-os Angeles was brought to a close this
evening by the semi-official announcement
that that "honor has been conferred upon
Mrs. Mark Lewis, one or Los Angeles'
ijioit charming and accomplished young
women.
'the selection was made a month ago,

The ladies of the court, who up to this

SAN JOSE, Cal.. March 28.â Queen Flora
will reign in this city during the carnival
from Jlay 6 to 9, and the selection of this
ruler is attracting much attention. Acres
and acres of sweet peas, marigolds and
roses are now under cultivation for carni
val purposes, and the young lady who is
successful will preside over a domain as
fragrant and us brilliant in bloom as ever
did a Flora. Great arches of flowers will
be erected on the main streets, and the
city will be transformed into a veritable
flower-Ded.
There are thirty candidates for regal
honors at present, "but it is believed that a
Jarge number of the>e will withdraw, and
the contest for queen narrow down to half
a dozen. There has been but little change
in tne vote since Wednesday, and Miss
' Lulu Schemmel is still in the lead, with
Miss Metta Laisy a close second. Araone
the new contestants are Miss VevaÃnrrell",
Miss Nellie North and Miss "Wilhelmina

It is believed that during the corning
week Stanford University will put a con
testant into the field, and with the sup
port of the university and that section of
the county such a candidate would prove
a formidable opponent. Gilroy and the
southern end of the county will in all
likelihood unite in supporting Miss Lillian

IS JOHNSON IN FRESNO?
Irate Citizens Fail to Locate the
Evangelist Who Insulted
Their Daughters.
Rumors That He Will Sue the Press
and the Ccmmittee That Drove
Him From Town.
FRESNO, Cal., March 28.â 1f Evan- ;
' gelist Johnson, who was driven ont of i
; town because he declared from a pulpit j
| that a majority of Fresno's daughters |
! were unchaste, has returned he is kept
; well secreted. The wrath of the citizens
; has not subsided, and the search iÂ« being
i continued to the end that ;Â£ the ecclesias
tical accuser is found he will be made to
regrt't that he disobeyed the edict which
! exiled hiii from the city.
The Methodist Board of the K-street I
church met last evening and indorsed
i Johnson's offensive utterances from the
i pulpit. There is now tulk of su : .t> against
| th' local press for large sum--. Walier D.
Tunper and George E. Church have been
j retained to tiring these suits, which, it is
alk'ged, will be filed on Monday.
It is said that Johnson will al*o bring ac-
I tion against the citizens' committee which
conducted the interview with him and his
, friends in the rear of the First National
: Bank Thursday afternoon. This suit will
', be based on the grounds of unlawful de
tention. Many people believe these thincs
are given out as a mere bluff and that
there will be no litigation. George M.
Morse, the alleged wealthy friend of John
son's from Pasadena, is said to be furnish
j ing the sinews of war.
It is reported that Johnson intends to

BURIED GOLD IN
ALPINE VALLEY.
Charcoal-Burners Locate a
Fortune Hidden Many
Years Ago.
MINER JOHNSON'S CACHE
Mediums Had Vainly Invoked
the Spirits to Recover
the Treasure.
HIS SECRET DIED WITH HIM.
Braved Death Rather Than Surrender
the Metalâ Sequel to an Early-
Day Romance.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 28.â For
several weeks reports have been in circula
tion here that two charcoal-burners in
Alpine Valley had unearthed a large
amount of treasure. The laborers sud
denly quit work and began to consume
large quantities of red wine and otherwise
enjoy themselves. During one of these
periods of inebriety the men exhibited a
lot of gold coin and a quantity of gold
nuggets to a rancher in Alpine Valley.
The exhibition of so much wealth by the
heretofore poverty-stricken coal-makers
excited a lively curiosity among the resi
dents of that section, and the fact that tbe
two men had beer at work on the "'John
son place" went far to confirm the reports
of the treasure-trove. By M. W. Tarwater,
who has resided in Alpine Valley for up
ward of thirty years, the reports of the find
are confirmed.
The story of buried wealth on the John
son place has excited the cupidity of doz
ens of people in that vicinity and caused |
many a hard day's digging. More than I
thirty years ago an old miner named John- j
son came to Alpine Valley in search of
health and a quiet place to end his days.
He had plenty of gold dust and money,
and soon purchased a ranch of I'JO acres,
on which he erected a corufortable house
and otherwise improved the place. Shortly
after settling in the valley the old man re
ceived a legacy of over fWOO in gold by the
ileath of a brother in the Ea-t, and having
no confidence in banks the old gentleman !
hid the money with his gold dust in a Â»aie
place.
The fact that much money was hidden
upon the ranch was generally known to
the neighbors, and one night Johnson was
aroused from his bed by several masked
men who demanded, upon pain of instant
death, to know where the money was hid
den. The miner's answer was a round of
shots from his pistol, and during the con
fusion that followed he escaped to the
shelter of a neighboring ravine. He car
ried a bullet wound in the left shouider.
Here he was shortly afterward found and
removed to the hospital in Santa Rosa.
Johnson lingered between Jife and death
for several months, but finally recovered
sufficiently to be moved to the residence of
Milton Greenlee In Alpine Valley, who
then owned a ranch adjoining the "John
son place." Greatly enfeebled by con
sumption and living constantly in fear of
robbers the old man refused to even visit
his own place alone and soon became
loosed upon as a member of the Greenlee
family. He often said that since the death
of his brother he had no living relatives
and declared his intention of leaving all of
his property to John Greenlee, the six
montus-old son of his host. He delivered
to Mr. Greenlee a holographic will, in
which little John Greenlee was named a3
sole heir. The will particularly described
the ranch and stocK owned by Johnson,
but said nothing of the money. On being
asked as to the whereabouts of the buried
gold the old man said it was so well hidden
that no one but himself could find it, but
he promised to reveal the cache to Green
lee as soon as his health would permit a
visit to the ranch.
Cherishine the delusion that he would
ultimately recover from the dread disease
that was rapidly hurrying him to the grave,
the aged miner kept postponing the prom
ised revelation until his strength was en
tirely gone and he at last knew that he was
on his deathbed. He then vainly tried to
describe to Greenlee where the money was
hidden. He 5-aid that it was among the
roots of a certain madrone tree and told
bow the adjoining trees were marked.
After Johnson's death, Greenlee took
possession of the ranch in the name of his
son, and commenced a systematic hunt for
tne money. Failing, after a iong search,
to find any traces of the poll, the services
of two spirit mediums from San Francisco
were enlisted and their advice strictly fol
iowed.
One of the mediums went into a trance,
and among the visjons that floated through
his inspired brain was a picture of the old
man and three cans of gold at the foot of a
tree. This tree wr.s dug out bodily by the
root? and the ground torn up for a rod or
more around it without reward. The
mediums soon afterward left for San Fran
cisco, and Greenlee, believing that they
had found the money, abandoned any
further search.
Johnson's will, which was never pro
bated, is still in the possession of the
Greenlee family, the ranch having been
sold without the formality of a court or
der. From a daughter of Milton Greenlee,
"residing in this city, it is learned that John
Greenlee, to whom the property was left,
is now living in laiistoga and is about 27
years of a^e. It is al^o learned that the
young man has already retnined a Santa
Rosa lawyer and will invoke (he aid of the
courts to not only recover the money
found by the charcoal-burners but also to
try and recover possession of the ranch,
sold during his minority.
It is said tliat there were three of the
coal-burners who profited by the find, and
that one of them was wise enough to leave
for sunny Iraiy last week, where, under
his own vine and tig tree, he can enjoy his
suddenly acquired wealth without iear of
American courts or heirs.

fore the State Normal School Trustees at

to desist from plowing up the lawns
around the Normal School.
At the January meeting of the trustees
they decided to plow up the lawns, as they
claimed the yearly appropriation of $2,300
was not sufficient to maintain them. This
caused a roar of indignation from the pub
lic and the Board of Trade appointed a
committee to investigate the cost of main
taining the lawns. The report of the com
mittee fhows the grounds can be kept in
fine shape for less than the yearly appro
priation. The trustees will be asked to re

FATE OF A CARSON THIEF.
Henry Piper Sentenced to Pay
a Fine of $300 for Looting
the Mint.
The Jury's Recommeudation Tuat
Mercy Be Shown Results in
a Light Penalty.
CARSON, Nev., March 28.â Henry
Piper, the mint employe, found guilty of
stealing $1 worth of crude amalgam, was
let off with a light sentence to-day. United
States Judge Hawley fined the culprit $300
and waived the imprisonment penalty.
Tne courtroom was packed with people
and the aisles filled. Piper was ordered to
stand up. The Judge looked at him in a
kindly way and speaking quietly, with no
touch of asperity in nls voice, alluded to
the fact that Piper had been for years a
respected citizen of the State, where he
had reared a family and nad been esteemed
by hi' fellow-men." In a moment of weak
ness he had lost respect for his family, his
good wife and his previous good reputa
tion am! committed an illegal act. The
fact that the jury had made a recom
mendation for mercy and also that the
officers of the mint had condoned tne
affair and suppressed it for nearly three
years was taken into consideration. If
the mint officials had done their duty and
brought offenders to justice when the
crimes were committed, it seemed to him
that so much dishonest work would not
have existed in the institution. He was
unable to understand the principles of any
busineÂ«s man in a public institution who
permitted h thief to Â»o at liberty simply
with a discharge. tTe was satisfied that
mercy in this case would result in no repe
tition of tne offense, and felt from the bot
tom of his heart that the accused had
\ made a bitter repentence for his act and
â  iiad already suffered creat mental anguish:
i He would waive the imprisonment and fix
I the fine at $300.
The spectators had been listening with
j great attention to the words of the Judge,
! and when the merciful sentence fell from
! his lips there was a burst of applause
i which was promptly checked by the Court.
The tine was paid to-day.

JNO. MONAHAN, 432 Commercial Street.
As I live by the pen I must say that one of the most pleasant and affable gentle-
men it has been my good fortune to meet politely gave me an interview yesterday.
His name is John Monahan ami he is a printer. A printer known far and wide on the
Pacific Coast. People had told me of Mr. Monahan so that I had come prepared to
meet a good-natured man and was not at all embarrassed when he smilingly told me
what he thought of California, her products and her SarsapariUa. Said he: "On the
subject of Sarsaparilla my ODinion is fixed. While I have no reason to know or to say
that other sarsapariliaa are of no value, I have every reason to know and to say that
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilja is of inestimable value, for not only have some of ray
relatives used it, but I have actualiy tried the Sarsaparilla and know its true value.
It is a delicate matter for one to speak of the virtues of a proprietary remedy, never-
theless, the truth stands in the bright light of reason and overcomes delicate feelings,
for the truth is mighty, and the migtity truth is that Joy's Sarsaparilla Is made of
California herbs and contains no deleterious mineral poisons. I am personally ac-
quainted with a gentleman who suffered from violent headaches and he suffered con-
tinuously, and perhaps would have been suffering now but that he used the home
remedy. Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. He recommends Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
and so do I. It is a very pleasing remedy for women, because it is not nasty to the
taste and its effects are pleasant. In the Spring of the year when nature is at work
renewing herself, he who desires to renew and make rich the blood can do no better
than use the home remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsapariila."
As I left John Monahan the printer I could not help but think whattn abundance
of philosophic humor he possessed. HENRY TILLMAN.

Citizens Rise Up Against
a Christian Science
Doctor.
AN INFANT SACRIFICED.
Coroner's Jury Decides That It
Died Because of Willful
Neglect.
WAS GIVEN NO MEDICINE.
Piotests of Neighbors Ignored by the
Parents â The Community
Enraged.
BAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 28.â
The people of Chino are enraged because
of the death of a child under Christian
science treatment, and it is intimated that
Dr. Mrs. Viola Brown will be asked to
leave the town at once. Coroner Keating
was summoned to Chino on Tuesday to
investigate the death of the 13-month
old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. 0. Sedgwick,
who was taken ill ten days ago with a bad
cold. Neighbors visiting the parents, and
seeing the condition oi ttie child, had pro
tested ti:at a physician should be called in
to attend the little sufferer, bat as the
parents had been ill a week previous, and
had become well presumably through the
efforts of Dr. Brown, she was sent for to
pray and administer to the baby.
As the days went by the babe grew
worse and still the parents refused to call
a reguiar physician until the little girl
was beyond earthly aid. At the inquest
held yesterday the Coroner called the
father to the stand and in the coarse of
Sedgewick's testimony he said :
"I believe if Christian science could not
cure the child it would have died any
way."
After hearing all the testimony the jury
rendered the following verdict: "Died
from pneumonia through the willful
nPL'lect of the parents."
T c feeling against Dr. Brown is very
bitter and it is said that she will be com
pelled to leave Chino if she doe 3 not go
willingly.
JFOKGER I) ILL OS KEIAKEX.
Had Itcice Escaped J-'rom San JJernaT*
ditto County Officers.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 28.â
During the last three months Tod Dillon
has given the officers of San Bernardino
County as much trouble as could be ex
pected from one man. Dillon is a forger,
Having forged a pay check on the Sar.ta
Fe roa<i for $14 35. While en route to San
Bernardino from Barstow, he was arrested
and, when taken to ;he latter place, es
caped and was at liberty a few days. Then
he was recaptured. He was again taken
to Barstow, and put into the town jail
with both hands and feet ironed.
While the constable was going for a
meal Dillon slipped out, leaving the leg
irons, but retaining the fandcuffs. No
trace of him could be found until to-day,
when a telegram came from Los Angeles,
statine that villon was again in custody.
As Dillon is a desperate man he will be
closely guarded this time.

THEY PLAYED
FOR CHARITY.
The Alameda Boy Actors
in Leland Ramsdell's
Comedy.
SOME GOOD STAGE WORK
A Pretty Performance That
Brought Money for the
Alameda Poor.
GIRLS IN SONGS AND DANCES.
The Audience, Composed Mainly of
Students and Children, Was a
Merry One.
The comedy, "Fifteen Thousand Dol
lars, or a Lottery Ticket," written by Le-
Jand S. Ramsdel), a boy of 15 years, was
played in Alarneda yesterday afternoon.
CLARENCE OIIVSF*
LELAND.S RAM*>DIÂ»UU
Lcland S. Ramsdcll, the Alameda IBoy Dramatist, and Actors Oliver and Clark.
[Drawn by a "Call" artist from photographs.]
It was a charity performance, the pro. i
ceeds to be distributed to poor people of
the city by the "Woman's Exchange, and
it was a success financially as well as in an
artistic way.
Armory Hall was well filled, about 300
representatives of the leading Alameda
families being in the audience. Most of
those present were boys and girls. There
were tots of 4 or o years who stood up in i
the aisles or on the chairs and clapped
their tiny hands at every outbreak of ap- j
plause, tiny chaps who tumbled head over |
heels when they tried to walk rapidly over
the floor, which had recently been waxed
for dancing, and kindergarten delegates
who gazed at the weapons of Company G
and tried to identify letters in the big
black signs:
PLEASE PUT YOUR GLOVES
ON BEFORE HANDLING
THESE RIFLES.
There were laughing boys and pirls of i
from 5 to 15 years, there were quieter i
youths and maidens of more than the lat
ter age, and there were numerous grown
up people who watched the merry scene. I
In tlie comedy that was presented Le
land Ramsdell. the author, took the role
of Farmer Pumpkinhead. He played his
part with ability, and his acting showed j
that he has already civen study to the pro
fession that be is preparing to adopt.
Herbert Clark made the most decided j
hit, however. He assumed the character !
of Mrs. Pumpkinbead, and few of the pro
fessional impersonators on the theatrical '
Btage could have done better with the op- [
portunities afforded in the part written j
ior this boy. Of course, the boyish face
and voice were advantages, but the char- j
acter was well sustained in every wav and
the acting was excellent. The kitchen
scene, with Mrs. Pumpkinhead kneading '
<lough would have thoroughly amused j
any critical pudience.
Clarence Oliver looks aristocratic, and
perhaps that is why he was better as Mr.
Vanderbtlt tbanjas the bunko-steerer. His
make-up as an elderly millionaire was
effective and natural, and he played the
van with a quiet dignity that was very
becoming to him.
George Macaulay was a highly amusing
Dick Smart, particularly when he was be
ing mesmerized by Mr. Pumpkinhead.
As Sum Vandcrbilt, the mischievous son
of the millionaire, he was aiso successful.
In addition to the comedy, a pretty pro
gramme of music and recitations was pre
sented. Miss Helen Entzmann's solo,
"Angel's Serenade," was the opening se
lection. A skirt dance by Miss Daisy
Vcaco was beautifully performed ana was
one of the prettiest features of the enter
tainment.
Miss Isabella McCurrie of 2225 Clinton
avenue displayed her bjjth elocutionary
ability in a humorous recitation for the
children, and when tumultuousiy recalled
by the little ones she gave an exquisite
rendition of James Whitcornb Riley's
"There, Little Girl, Don't Cry."
Clarence Oliver, the young actor, sang a
couple of songs, one of which was "Ben
Bolt." Miss Isabel Lindeman recited "A
Mortifying Mistake" in a very pretty
manner. Miss Rita Mylotte of Oakland
gave an exhibition of club-swinging, with
a piano accompaniment by Miss LaUra
Kirknes^. Miss Mylotte handled the
clubs with skill. She is one of the most
graceful pc; formers on this coast.
Eileen and Sylvia McCurrie, girls of 9
and 11 years, were exouisite in their song
and dance, "Coming Through the Rye."
There was nothing more artistic on the
entire programme. The elder child re
sponded to the encore with "Won't You
Come Out and Play?"'
The song, "What Could Little Dorris
Do?" was sweetly sung by Miss Ruth
Sueldon. Herbert Clark, Leland Rams
dell and Clarence Oliver opened in char
acter as "Three Old Jays." A piano solo
by Miss Entzmanu concluded that portion
of the entertainment.
As may be imagined, the applause
throughout the afternoon was tremendous.
A schoolboy had some sort of a triangle
contrivance in the gallery, and he beat
time for the clapping and the whistling
and the occasional cheering with which
the encores were given.
It was a glorious day for the children of
Alameda, and with all the fun, a large
amount of money was raised for the poor â
just how much is not yet known. Among
the people prominent in the audience were :
HERBERT CuJfcx;
Mrs. Dr. Van Orden, Mrs. Linderman,
Miss Marie Hunter, Mrs. Justin Hopkins, j

CHARTER OF LYON POST.
Cause Shown to the Council of Admin
istration Why It Should Xot
Be Revoked.
ThÂ« council of administration of the
Grand Army of the Republic, Department
of California and Nevada, met at the St.
Ann's building last night to hear repre
sentatives of Lyon Post, Oakland, on an
order to show cause why the charter of the
post should not be revoked. The pro
ceedings grew out of the resolutions of the
post condemning tne management of the
Veterans' Home.
Department Commander Wilson pre
sided at the session of the council. Other
members of the council present were:
Comrades Sullivan, MastelW, Wiegand,
Jacobs, Burgess, Cahen and Robinson.
Among the comrades present from Lyon
Post were: Judge Gibson, Mr. Talcott,
Comrade Norton, the adjutant, and Major
Wood war. 1.
Ail the proceedings relating to the adop
tion of the resolutions were reviewed and
the position of the post explained.
The deuartment commander announced
that the decision of the council would not
be made immediately.
Several Grand Army men, who discussed
the matter on the outside while the coun
cil was in executive session, expressed the
opinion that the charter of the post would
not be revoked.
The Trades Alliance.
The leaders of the Trades Alliance "will
next week send invitations to each union
in the City to send delegates to the meet
ing which will be field next Sunday at
1159 Mission street. According to the de
cision of that body at its list meeting,
each union may be represented by one
delegate for its charter and one delegate
for each 100 members or the majority frac
tion thereof. Matters of great interest to
trades unions will be discussed.
Family Injured.
Patrick Crecdon, a laborer, 49 years of age,
died at St. Mary's Hospital last evening from
the rp=uit of injuries received in a railroad
accident at Fourth and Kin* streets yesterday
afternoon. The body was taken to the Morgue.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
A JOKER IN THE
CONVENTION CALL
McNab Worked in an Inno
vation in Democratic
Politics.
TO APPOINT DELEGATES.
The Junta Makes a Move Toward
Getting a Constitution and
By-Laws.
RAINEY GOES BUT TO RETURN.
Dick Creighton Tells a Story on Braun
hart and O'Donnell Starts for
Congress.
Chairman W. P. Sullivan of the Junta
! last evening announced his appointment
j of the following committee to prepare a
constitution and by-laws for the general
committee:
Twenty-eighth District, John Welch ; Twenty
ninth, John Allen; Thirtieth, John Devaney;
Thirty-tirst, W. A. Asmussen; Thirty-secoud,
W. H. Harrison; Thirty-third. S. K. O'Keefe;
Thirty-fourth, Paul B. Hay; Thirty-fifth, John
H. Grad} ; Thirty-sixth, E. P. Mogan ; Thirty
seventh," M. EL >iead; Thirty-eighth, M. <.;m;h
blatt; Thirty-ninth, \V. J. Gavigan; Fortieth,
M. Jasper McDonald; Forty-first, T. \V. DoyJe;
Forty-second, Frank MoKlfath; Forty-third, T.
J. Pinder; Forty-tilth, Thomas Murray.
Chairman Sullivan thought this would
start trouble enougn for one time, and so
the appointment of the committee on
grievances is delayed until next meeting.
The Junta has so long used the "oilroom'
at headquarters for a constitution and
Gavin McNab for its by-laws that there
are some doubts that the organization will
know what to do with the other kind.
There is also some surprise that the little
coterie of bosses should have the temerity
to risk the presence of written regulations.
This committee will meet to-morrow
evening at the headquarters in the Flood
building. It wilt not be likely to report
any fettering constitution for several
weeks, but one will be adopted just before
the State Convention, that it may be put
on lite a new suit to go to Sacramento
with.
It is through this committee that the
scheme of appointing delegates is most
likely to be brought forward if a possi- :
bility of doing it appears when the time |
comes. Whether delegates are appointed '
or not will depend upon how Sullivan,
McNab and a few others stand in regard
to Daggett and Rainey when the time
comes.
Daggett is bound to control the Junta's
San Francisco delegation to Sacramento,
with fair concessions to Welburn, and !
Raincy will backDagcettin the State fight
in retvirn for Dazgett's help Jater in his
Winning and using the organization in j
local politics for himself. Ed Lanigan's !
interests are all local or legislative, and so â 
he will stand in on the State Convention !
wherever his personal interests in local [
politics direct. Few people have doubts
that he will be with Rainey.
Sam Rainey goes to ban Bernardino
County this week, leaving his political ]
forces in the hands of George Maxwell and \
Eddie Greany, to be used as Daggelt
directs. Having secured control of the ;
Junta he sees that it is good politics for
him to clear out fora wnile. When the
State Convention is over, or before, he will
return expecting to go ahead with Dag
gett's forces and his own anU manipulate
local politics.
This plan of appointing deleeates to the
Slate Convention, something almost un
heard of in the party, appears to have been
early planned. It has been discovered !
that there was a little joker in the State
Convention call quickly read and adopted
at the recent meeting of the State Central
Committee which Gavin McNab passed
with Chairman Gould's assistance.
This call is a new thing in Democratic
politics of California in that it contains a
covert provision for the appointment of
delegates. The call says:
Resolved. That members of Â«nid State Conven
tion be selected in such a manner as the vari
ous county committees shall determine to be
expedient, the holding of primary elections,
therefore, being recommended wherever prac
ticable.
So far the Junta has been run on lines of
"expediency," and the State call was
especially framed so that McMab would be
free to manipulate an arbitrary appoint
ment of delegates if that course turned out
to be expedient in tne interests of "de
cency, clean politics and anti-bossisra."
Of course the same course is open to
county committees all over the State..
The universal custom of the party has been
to order primaries in the call fur the State
Convention. Tne corresponding paragraph
in the call of l&OO is typical of all fii the
history of the party. It was as follows:
Resolved, That in the election of delegates
from the different counties to the State con
vention ail such delegates shall be elected !
I either at open or club nrimuries held for that
j purpose, or by delegates selected at an open or
i club primary to county convention, called for
| the purpose of selecting such delegates to the
: State Convention.
The Junta is a queer mess of practical
j politics. With Ramey and Daggett in
i control for a division of spoils Ed Lani
j Kan "playing for place" and a number of
reformers who are struggling to make
the party decent and give the City a clean
| government by putting themselves in
; office, there is a lot of peculiar manipulat
! me: going on. McNab, Sullivan, Braun
hart, Hassett and a few more are still
loudly proclaiming that the "decent" ele
ment controls and will win out. Bam
Rainey doesn't say anythine, but lie
knows a heap.
The Twenty-ninth District is one that is
; Dcins watched with great interest. Sam i
j Braunhart declares that the Raineyites '.
' haven't a ghost of a show in his district, !
j and that the decent people there, who are
j standing by him in the interest of pure
politics, can even win at a primary.
However, Braunhart is mightily wor
! ried, and almost the entire band of politi
: cai workers of this famous south-of-Market
district are again.-t him. The Rainey
; Daggett boys are all working against him,
; and the Buckleyites, who have the largest
j numbers in that district, hate him.
But Braunhart is doing politics and the
| Twenty-ninth may yet stand forth tri
j umphantly for "decency,' 1 with "excel-
I sior" on its banner. Richard Creighton
j tells a story of politics in the Twenty
! ninth. '"Dick" is a member ol the Buck
j ley general committee from that district.
"I am out of politics," said Mr. Creigh
ton last evening, "and I'm earning an
honest living. Of course I know some
thing about how things are going down
there. Braunhart! Great Scott! That fel
low came to me about a week and a half
ago and he proposed to me that I stand in
with him with my friends, go over to the
Junta and name half the delegates.
"I was to help make him State Senator
and then take the works. Weil, 1 would
hardly go into another combination like
that when lam on the big end now. Me-
Nab, Braunhart and those fellows make
me laugh when they talk about 'pure poli
tics.' They would do politics with the
devil if they thought it was to their inter,
est to do t>o."
C. C. O'Donnell will not run for Mayrr
this year. He will run, though. He" is
going to be a candidate for Congress from
the Fourth District and bury Muguire.

THE STRIKE ALMOST OVER
Many Journeymen Painters at
Work for the Friendly
Bosses.
TWO IMPORTANT INTERVIEWS.
Union Men Say the Fight Is Rapidly
Narrowing to a Few Master
Painters.
The strike of the journeymen painters
is gradually narrowing down until it is
now practically directed against only a
few members of the Master Painters' As
sociation instead of the entire body of
bosses as it was a week ago. Since the
strike has been raised against the friendly
bosses others who held out are gradually
coming into line. While among the lat
ter there are a number who will not openly
declare in favor of the union's demands
they are allowing their shops to become
unionized without interference.
This, the strikers say, is all they want,
and these victories are of that nature that
they are not disposed to "crow," not wish
ing to lose the advantages gained by open
proclamation.
The strikers were much interested in the
way President Black of the Master Paint- ;
ers' Association said the card system could
be defeated. Mr. Black's method was to
keep union painters only on those jobs .
where other craftsmen of the Building j
Trades Council are employed and work j
non-union men on all otner job?.
President Rose said: "Mr. Black's sup- j
gewtion would be good if he could get |
union painters to work for him. Until he j
accedes to all the demands of the union he :
cannot get union men to work on any of '
his jobs. So you see his game will not
work."
When the union decided to allow the
men to go back to work for the friendly
bosses it was with the understanding that
those who worked would contribute 50
cents a day from their earnings for every
day t :ey worked to the union's relief
fund.
A large number of the boys were paid
last evening and they at once handed in
their donations. About $70 was received
last evening and more will come in Mon
day evening, as many of the bosses pay on
that day of the week."
The painters' benefit in the Bush-street
Theater next Wednesday evening will
probably add many hundred dollars to the
relief fund.
A BRIGHTER OUTLOOK.
The Strikers Receive Encouraging
Words From the Nevada City
Miners' Union.
The regular morning meeting of the
striking painters was held in the Temple
at 115 Turk street yesterday. The decreas
ing attendance at these meetings is re
garded with great satisfaction by the
leaders, as it shows that the men have
found employment in the shops of the
friendly bosses. The registration of idle
union painters, too, is lighter. Several re
ports were made of men having gone to
work. There were one or two reports of
men who had proved unfaithful to their
SEPARATE SKIRTS.

bosses who are recognized as enemies of
the union. These men will be investigated
and summarily dealt with by the union in
the near future.
A report was made that caused great
indignation on the part of the painters. It
seems that soon alter the strike began a
painter named Oliver McGinty caused the
relief committee to believe that he was in
destitute circumstance?. He was given $5
to tide over his distress, notwithstanding
that he had been in the union only a very
short time. Those who are watching the
unfriendly shops reported that McGinty is
at work in the shop of an avowed enemy.
When reproached for his conduct, ie was
reported that McGinty answered that he
would return the $5 and that the union
could go to a place where there is no need
for strikes. At this stage of the strike such
ingratitude is likely to cause trouble for
the ingrate.
A cheerful letter was read from the
Miners' Union of Nevada City, accom
panied by a set of resolutions indorsing
the painters' strike. The miners express
the hope that the strikers will win their
right. They promised to elect one of their
members to the Assembly at the next
election who will endeavor to have en
acted laws for the beneht of the working
classes.
A lettei was received from the painters
in Sacramento, asking for the San Fran
cisco union to send an organizer to the
capital and organize a painters' union
there. The wish will be complied with at
once. This will bring three painters'
unions under one head. It is expected
that nearly every journeyman painter in
Sacramento will join the union.
MAY YET AGREE.
Two Employing: Painters Confer
With the Leaders of the
Painters' Union.
Two important conferences were held
3 r esterday and last evening which will
probably have considerable bearing upon
the strike. One was between M. J. Dono
van and the strike leaders, and the other
was between J. St. Denis and President
Rose of the Painters' Union. St. Denis
and Donovan are among the largest of the
employing painters, and while neither will
"bacK ciown" in the position they have
taken they may be induced to entertain a
proposition that may lead to a better re
lationship with the union men.
Donovan is expected to start on a large
contract to paint Frank Sullivan's row of
houses, on Mission street, near Sixth, to
morrow morning. It is understood that
he will leave the entire job in the hands of
his foreman, who will hire only union
painters, at the rate of $3 for 8 hours' work.
Such an arrangement would unionize the
shop to all intents and purposes without
interfering with Mr, Donovan's position in
the premises. It iÂ« said that nearly all of
Mr. Donovan's old hands will return to
work to-morrow morning, and that such
additional help as will be required has
already been selected. If such be the case
a great pressure will be taken off the strike
aituation.
Last evening a long interview was held
between Mr. St. Denis, who has the big
painting contract on the Panott buildin<r,
and President Rose. Mr. St. Denis said
that he is losing money every day, and
he would like to tee the' difficulty settled.
Mr. Rose answered that the Painters'
Union has never yet refused to make a
settlement of any difficulty. Had the
Master Painters' Association presented
any kind of a proposition it would have
been respectfully considered.
They never submitted a proposition and
even ignored the suggestions of liieir own
committee appointed to confer with the
union's committee. Upon Mr. St. Denis
again stating that he would like very much
to see the matter settled so he could go on
with the work Mr. Rose told him to pre
pare a proposition, which would receive a
respectful consideration by the union.
The interview closed with the understand

A DESTITUTE STRIKER.
The Relief Committee's Timely Aid
to a Family That Had Been
Evicted.
One of those pathetic incidents that al
ways attend a labor strike came to light
yesterday through the relief committee.
The case was reported in the morning
meeting by Mr. Ames. It seems that a
union painter living on Bryant street, near
Eighth, went out when the union ordered
the strike. Like many of the laboring
class, he had not been able to save any
money ahead for the rainy day, and when
that day came he was unprepared.
Work as hard as he might the painter
had not been able to earn over $8 or $9 a
week, for even in good times he was un
able to keep continuously at work. When
he went out with the others he had only a
few dollars, which did not go far in pro
viding for a wife and live young children.
The greatest frugality was practiced in
the household and the family managed to
exist.
Yesterday morning a crisis came. The
landlord had on several occasions given
notice that the rent must be paid up or
the premises vacated. It was then that
the man laid the case before the relief
committee, who promised to be with him
in an hour. "When the man returned to
his home he found ail of his household
effects had been moved out on the side
walk. A. little later Ames and Me Ivor
reached the scene of poverty. Ames
started out and soon found another house
upon which he advanced the price of the
rent. \Mclvor in the meantime had not
been.idle and a little later the butcher,
grocer and baker were at the house bear
ing evidence of the relief committee's
â¢worn.
The painter said that he would attend
to the moving of his furniture, but he
made a miscalculation and again the com
mittee wa3 called upon. The expressman
had kept the until the cartage was
paid, it took an hour to find the express
man in order to get back the stove. The
members of the striking painter's family,
with tears in their eyes, thanked the com
mittee as the latter Hastened away upon
other missions of relief.
NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS.
On May 1 the Minimum, of Carpen-
ters' Wages Will Bo Three
Dollars.
On April 1, when the working-card sys
tem of the Building Trades Council goes
j into effect, there will not be a single con
| tractor in this City who can justly say
] that he has not been notified of the fact.
j The various unions in the trade are not
satisfied that the matter has been dis
cussed among the members of the jiuild-
I ers' Exchange, but each union workman
has been instructed to personally notify
his employer.
The same may be said of the carpenters'
, determination to secure $3 as the minimum
! for a day's wages. In order not to cause
] tbe contractors any loss in figuring upon
j contracts, the union set May 1 as the date
for enforcing the $3 rate. That all con
| tractors may be fully notified, the follow
ing circular will be sent out next week by
the carpenters' district council:
Haix of District Coi-ncil, 1

To Contractors aud All Interested Parties in the

is sent to notify you that on and after May 1
1896, the union carpenters will enforce the" $3

CANADA AND THE EMPIKE.
Independence Now Han Few Partisans
in the Dominion.
There can be little doubt that the past
year in Canadian affairs has witnessed the
final effacement of ideas which conflict
with British connection. Previously there
had been much discussion of opposing
theories as to the political future of the
Dominion; and imperial federation, inde
pendence and annexation had partisan?
who voiced the respective merits of each
in the press and on the platform.
Now there is no such uncertainty ap
parent. All shades of political opinion are
a unit in favor of remaining; within the
empire, tnough it is no less certain that
th" existing political status is not satisfac
tory. This doe* not imply a desire for in
dependence â at least it would be difficult
to reconcile any such deÂ«ire with the offer
of aid and willingness 10 share in sacri- j
fices BO readily expressed by the Dominion
Parliament. 'Correspondents of New York
journal* mar write as they please about
the annexation feeling alleged to exist in
certain parts of Quebec, but their state
ments do not count for much in the pres
ence of a patriotism which, when roused
by danger, shakes off doubts and fears aa
dust and shows the nation where its heart
lies.
That is what recent events have done for
Canada. Some who were in doubt are in
doubt no longer. English-speaking citi
zens of the empire are one people wherever
they may be, and, as a Toronto friend told
the writer, "Whether a toe is trodden on
in Guiana or a finger pinched in the Trans
vaal it matters not." Judging therefore by
Hrong manifestations of sentiment the
dominion hopes for a closer union with
tngland which will do away with the re
proach of subordination.â J. W. .Russell,
m the March Pveniew of Keviews.
EZETA'S STORY IS TOLD.
The Crew of the Barclay Golden
Give His Side of the
Case.
NOT A COWARD IN ACTION.
Ke Has Plenty of Money and Is Only
Awaiting Another Chance
to Fight.
The remains of General Antonio Ezeta's
expedition to recapture San Salvador ar
rived in port yesterday. The tug Barclay
Golden came in through the Golden Gate
quite unexpectedly and at once docked at
Main-street wharf. The officers of the
vessel bring quite a different tale from that
which was telegraphed, and they also deny
in most emphatic terms that Ezeta and
Casin are "hard up" and depending upon
charity for their bread and butter. Ac
cording to them Ezeta's wife keeps them
supplied with money, and he and his de
pendents are living on the fat of the land
at Panama.
They are particular in denying the sto
ries circulated to the effect that Ezeta and
Casin are cowards. According to them
two braver men never stepped in shoe
leather, and had there been fifty men at
their back when they landed at Acajutla
Antonio Ezeta would now be master of the
republic.
"We reached Acajutla on January 3,"
said Chief Oltieer H. Spring yesterday.
"We had been up and down the coast look
ing for some sign of Ezeta's friends, but,
as we learnt aiterward, the revolution had
been sprung too soon, and we were a day
behind the fair. The rendezvous was to
have been at a farmhouse near the coast,
and we determined to land on the pretext
that we wanted to get some mescal. In
the first boat were Casin, Kenealy (who
carried the demijohn), Bermudas and
three others. I was in command of the
second boat and had three men with me.
"Cann and his men got ashore first and
had reached the farmhouse before we
reached the beach. Before we could land
we saw a party of thirty Salvadorans sur
round the farmhouse, and we at once put
to sea again. Casin and his men did not
wait to be attacked, but began firing at
once. They then made a rush out of the
front door and the troops did not wait for
them, but ran away as fast as their legs
would carry them. Tneir leader, who was
on horseback, led the way. Had Casin
at that time Jiad fifty men behind him he
could have regained his kingdom. There
is no doubt about that.
"Well, as we were pulling back to the
Barclay Golden the troops came out of
hiding and began firing at us. Second
Mate Melander took the oars and Casin
and his men returned their tire and several
of the troops dropped, but how badly they
were hurt I don't know. Ido know, how
ever, thut some of their shots came too
uncomfortably close to be pleasant. Once
aboard the tug Ezeta and Casin took up
their stand behind the coal sacks and
returned the enemy's fire until we got
under way. I suppose that is what gave
rise to the absurd stories published about
the two men petting into hiding as soon
as the first shot was fired.
"At Pants Annas one of Ezeta's fol
lower? came aboard. He told me it cost
him $200 to get a boatman to row him out
to us. He brought the information that
twelve men who had favored the return of
Ezeta had been shot and that wholesale
arrests were being made.
"At Acapulco we took aboard fully
three tons of cartridges. They came to
Panama on the schooner Una, which also
brought down Dan McLean, the famous
poacher. Dan took command of the little
schooner Silver Wave, and on her the car
tridges were taken to their destination.
If Ezeta and Casin had 100 men like Dan
McLean they would overrun Central
America. After getting our powder aboard
we again cruised' up and down the coast,
but there was never a signal-fire. We had
a good time, as there was plenty to eat and
drink aboard and little to do. "Finally we
put into Panama and there our cargo of
arms and ammunition was seized.
"There is no truth in the report that
Casin was going to shoot everybody on the
tug. The only person he had a row with
was myself, and that was over an awning
he wanted spread at once, and I took my
time about doing it. It was all over in a
minute, and we were the best of friends
thereafter. Whe'i we left Panama on
February 24 it was understood that Casin
was to leave for San Francisco on the next
steamer. In fact, be may be here now for
all I know.
"Ezeta and his private secretary, W.
Devlin, were staying at the Hotel Marino,
and it cost them $3 each a day for their
meals, so that doesn't look as though he
was hard up. Casin also stayed at the
game hotel. The day before we sailed I
was in the general's room, and he then
li?.d a big pile of gold in front of him, so I
cannot conceive of his being broke.^ You
mark my word?, Ezeta has not made his
last attempt at recapturing San Salvador. 1 '
The Barclay Golden will go back into
the towboat business, or she may make
another trip down the coast.
THE MORNING STAR.
Her Successful Cruise Among the Bar
barian Inlanders of the Far
Pacific Sens.
Among the arrivals here yesterday on
the steamer Australia from Honolulu was
Captain H. T. Garland of the missionary
ship Morning Star, which has for several
years been running between Honolulu and
the Marshall, Caroline and Gilbert islands.
The ship is owned by the American
Board of Foreign Missions. The board
has missionaries in all those islands.
About June 1 of each year the Morning
Star starts out from Honolulu laden with
provisions and other needed supplies and
with several religious teachers aboard
visits in succession various islands of the
aforesaid groups.
Often a resident missionary will have
jurisdiction over several islands, and in
such cases the Morning Star people, after
holding services with him and his people
awhile, catch him up and take him on to
one of his other islands.
Thus the missionary ship is the connect
ing link between the islands and atols.
She carrirs bibles, hymn books, song books,
tracts and the other auxiliaries necessary
in converting the heathen.
When the season is over she comes back
and Btays till June again at Honolulu. It
is thus that Captain Gariaixl is here. He
is on his way to Boston, the headquarters
of the Mission Board. All he does, how
ever, is to manage the shin.
He says this has been a successful year's
work among the natives. He denies that
they are cannibals, and says they are tract
able and quite susceptible of being influ
enced to a better life. The captain is at
the California.
GOLDEN WEDDING BELLS.

WANT THE WILMERDING.
Dr. T. A. Rottanzi Warmly Ad
vocates the South Side
of the City.
He Says the School Shou!d Be Placed
;ia the Midst of Artizans'
Homes.
Dr. T. A. Rottanzi, the prominent leader
in South Side improvement, is enthusiastic
on the idea of locating the Wilmerding
School of Mechanical Arts in some central
part of the Mission.
"To thoroughly conform to the wishes of
Wllmerding himself," said the doctor yes
terday, "the school should be located in
this City, and the only proper place for an
institution of this kind is in the midst of
artisans and those who intend to earn their
livelihood by mechanical workmanship.
"Almost the entire artisan population of
this City reside in the Mission, therefore I
advocate that the school be placed in this
part of town.
"The most favorable location in the
Mission, to my mind, is in the vicinity of
Columbia Square. Several wealthy men
have large land holdings there which are
admirably suited for sites. It may be pos
sible that one of these owners would do
nate a part of his property to be used aa a
site for the school.
"Columbia Square is accessible by the
Bryant and Brannan street lines, the Fol
som street and Harrison street lines in the
Mission proper. From the Western Addi
tion by the butter and Larkin street line
and from the Potrero by the Fifth and
Bryant street line.
"Mayor Sutro is generous. and public
spirited enough in offering to donate his
land, and his good example should be fol
lowed by other wealthy citizens. Still the
objects of the school and the desire of its
originator should be first considered."

A PEOGRESSIVE HOUSE.
What One of the Leading Department
Stores of Thig City Is Doing.
A city's progress can be gauged from its
readiness to take up and adapt modern
ideas in every line of its development.
One of the most modern and progressive
ideas In the retail trade in large cities is
what is known as department stores, and
in this particular feature San Francisco
furnishes a striking illustration in The
Maze. It -was established about three
years aeo by the Hamburger Company,
and it has been eminently successful from
its inception. It is a mecca for the ladies
of this City In their shopping tours, for
within its walls can be found in system
atically arranged departments nearly
everything used for domestic purposes.
At this season of the year it is natural
for the attention of the ladies visiting the
Maze to be attracted more especially
toward the dress goods, cloak and millin
ery departments, as they offer induce
ments that are particularly alluring. In
the latter department a complete change
has been made this spring, and it is now
in charge of Mrs. Martin. She quoted
prices yesterday in an interview that are
unusually low. Large hats trimmed in
feathers are being sold for $10 each, and
turbans at $5. They have a fine stock of
imported French pattern hats, and all
their goods are an fine as any in the mar
ket. The showing made of Easter bon
nets and novelties is particularly attract
ive. To-morrow the cloak department
will be formally opened, and a fine display
will be made that embraces all that is
new, novel and stylish in suits, cloak? and
wraps.
An Extraordinary Wound.
An extraordinary tale is told by Major
Pryse Gordon of a wound received in the
Waterloo campaign by one Donald
of the Ninety-second Regiment. He
had been shot in the thigh by
a musket bail. The ball was ex
tracted, but still the wound did not heal.
A large abscess formed. Poultices wers
applied and on an incision being made lo
and behold ! a five-franc piece and a one
franc piece were extracted, together with
a bit of cloth.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
A Romantic Marriage on the
Steamer Australia at
Honolulu.
THE YACHT EMMA A SUCCESS.
Her Trial Trip Yesterday Was Satis
factory to the Builder and Also
to the Owner.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu after a smart
passage of b" days 12 hours yesterday. The
voyage was a pleasure trip up to the time
the Farallones were sighted. Then it came
on to blow and the waves broke over the
vessel and made things uncomfortable.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
Belgic was sighted March 25, and two days
later an English bark with a light colored
bottom and painted ports was seem steer
ing southeast.
The Australia brought forty cabin and
twenty-seven steerage passenger?. Those
in the cabin were as follows: General R. H.
Warfield, H. T. Allen, Dr. J. Reed, O. R.
Harrill, \V. L. Hackett, J. C. Nobraan,
Mrs. E. Larkin, Miss E. M. Wallace, Count
yon Markhof and valet, S. S. Hooper, Rev.
F. F. Galligan, Miss E. T. Crosby, A.
Ahrens, W. P. Whittley, Mrs. M. A.
Weaver, Mrs. M. Merithew and child, Dr.
E. M. Pease and two children, E. R.
Wheeler and wife, Professor Zamloch, C.
E. Van Horn, William Mark, Captain G.
F. Garland and wife, Mrs. J. H. Richards,
F. Gaudin and wife, Miss M. Maguire,
Airs. A. Gartenberg and child, J. L. Inc-
Cammon and wife, Mrs. E. A. Murphy and
child, Miss M. E. Murphy, G. Kunst.
There was a marriage aboard the Aus
tralia while she was at Honolulu. The
cabin-boys were all interested spectators,
and as soon as the ceremony was performed
they serenaded the couple with tinoans
and foghorns. The bride and groom were
mulattoes and were married by a negro
minister.
A little over a year ago Miss Vina King
was Known as the wife of George Washing
ton, a negro, well known in Honolulu.
George began to bestow his affections on
native women, and there was trouble in
camp. A quarrel ensued and Vina Btruck
George over the head with a pick and frac
tured his skull. He recovered and she was
sentenced to serve six months on the reef.
When her term expired, she came to San
Francisco and was engaged by one of the
dives as a hula-hula dancer.
Hearing that business was good in Hono
lulu, she determined to return there, and
so took passage on the Australia. When
the Paradise of the Pacific was reached,
the authorities refused to allow her to land
on the ground of her previous conviction.
The woman was disconsolate until a
happy thought struck her. She wrote to a
former admirer named Thomas Dorrell,
and he at once went to her assistance. He
procured a marriage license, and accom
panied by the minister, went to the
steamer in his overalls. Chief Officer Law
less would not allow the ceremony to be
performed until he saw the captain or the
ship's agents. While he was gone, how
ever, the marriage took place and the Sur
veyor of the Port allowed Mrs. Dorrell (nee
King) to land.
Chief Steward T. K. James was driving to
the ship in a hurry in order to be present
at the ceremony. A dog scared his horse
and it swerved. The wheel caught in the
cartrack and James was thrown out, break
ing one of his ribs. He was still a very
sick man when the Australia docked yes
terday morning.
Charles E. Taylor's new yacht, Emma,
had her trial trip on the bay yesterday.
She is a very handsome craft and a fast
sailer. Her dimensions are 39 feet 6
inches over all, 29 feet 6 inches water line,
13 feet 4 inches broad and 4 feet 6 inches
deep. Her centerboard has a six-foot
drop. The cabin of the new craft Ib hand
somely furnished in oak and cedar and she
will have accommodation for quite a num
ber of Mr. Taylor's guests. She has a
spoonbill bow and is sloop rigged.
Patrick Crosby, a longshoreman, came
near losing his life on the British ship
Beechbank yesterday. He was assisting
in unloading the cargo of cement, when
three of the barrels fell out of the sling
and one of them struck him a glancing
blow. He was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, where it was discovered that his
wounds were not fatal.
The American ship Elvrell, fifteen days
out from Nanaimo, B. C, arrived yester
day. When seventy-rive miles off Point
Reyes, on the 26th inst., tin: abandoned
huik of the schooner Helen Merriam was
sighted. The derilect is a menace to navi
gation and mariners are warned to look
out for it.
CAN'T VISIT THE RACES
Sir. Vining Discharge* an Employe for
Visiting lugleÂ«fde.
John Keefe, one of the oldest and most
reliable of the Jackson-street cable-car
gripmen, has been discharged by Manager
Vining for attending the Ingleside races.
Keefe took his wife and a lady friend out
to the Ingleside track on ladies' day, a
week ago last Wednesday, and was there
"spotted" by one of the streetcar auto
crat's secret service employes, and a few
days later an order was received for his
discharge.
Keefe admits that he was at the races,
but said last night that he was by no
means an habitue of the tracks and make!)
no pretense of playing the races. On the
day he was "spotted" he went with his
wife and friend for an aiternoon's outing.
The employes of the street railway are
very indignant at the severe punishment
that has been administered to Gripman
Keefe.
There are a great many of the employes
who occasionally go out to the track, and
they consider ie none of Manager Vining's
business what they do when they are off
duty so long as it in. no way interferes
with their duties with the streetcar com
pany.
An effort is being made by the friends of
the discharged gnpman to have him rein
stated, and, if necessary, they will appeal
to the owners of the Ingleside track to in
tercede with Mr. Vining to abrogate the
order which he has issued. No rule has
ever been posted by the street railway man
ager prohibiting the men from visiting the
racetracks.

HOW HE FOUND A FORTUNE
A Million-Dollar Estate Recov
ered Through a Clair
voyant.
Curious and Interesting Story How
Frank L. Roeder Suddenly
Became Rich.
A remarkable and highly interesting
story was related to a Call reporter Jaat
j evening at the Baldwin Hotel by Frank
L. Roeder of Cincinnati, Ohio, who is a
guest of that house. The story concerns
the recovery of a large estate in Germany
valued at nearly a million dollars, and the
| attending circumstances are of such a
character as to appeal strongly to those
who are interested in occultism.
Mr. Roeder's story is as follows: About
three years ago he was following the pur
suit of a traveling salesman and was
making the towns in the interior of Ohio.
Business had been poor with him and he
was feelinp in quite a depressed frame of
mind when he landed one day at Colum
bus. Failing to secure many orders there
he was pondering where his ill luck was
going to land him when he happened
to notice the advertisement of a
clairvoyant then sojourning in Columbus.
He had always scoffed at the possibilities
of any good to be derived from consulting
such people, but on the spur of the mo
ment went and had a sitting. He was told
many things that surprised him and
which he knew to be true, but gave little
heed to what the clairvoyant said, deem
ing it but lucky jmessworfc on the part of
the gentleman. When, however, the
clairvoyant tried to impress upon him
that there was a large fortune in Germany
to which he was entitled, it was more than
he conld endure; and so he left tne place
feeling sore and disgusted for having part
ed with a rather liberal fee for what he
considered a lot of humbuggery. Occa- !
sionally for some months atterward he
thought of the clairvoyant's predictions,
especially as many of them were being
realized from time to time. Naturally in
this connection he thought several times
about what he had been told concerning
the estate in Germany.
His great-grandparents had come to
this country many years before, and, as he
had never heard of any family traditions
about an estate in the old country to which
they were entitled, he continued to think
that there was nothing in it. He has a
brother in the wine trade who was obliced
to make a business trip to Germany nearly
a year after he had first consulted the clair
voyant. Mr. Koeder suggested to hig
brother that he make some investigation
of the matter while over there and Ec did
so. The result of the investigation was
that he found that two or three hundred
years ago their ancestors had owned valu
able lands in the famous Rhine Valley,
but had lost possession of them in some
manner, and the moat careful investiga
tion failed to disclose evidence that would
entitle Roeder brothers to make any claim
to these lands.
Upon receiving this report, Mr. Roeder
again consulted the clairvoyant, who told
him that he could trace the chain of title and
show him where to secure the necessary evi
dence, and would undertake the work for
a nominal commission on any amount
that might be recovered. Mr. Roeder,
still skeptical, agreed, and work was com
menced. The clairvoyant discovered the
missing evidence, actions were brought,
the entire estate was recovered, and Mr.
Roeder and his brother are now enjoying
the same. Since then Mr. Roeder has
reason to feel the utmost confidence in the
clairvoyant who assisted him to secure
such a large fortune, and he never makes
any business ventures without consulting
him. He came here all the way from his
home in Cincinnati to consult the clair
voyant in question, Professor F. Eugene
of 1728 Market street, about business mat
ters. Mr. Roeder is a gentleman of tine
appearance and well educated, and he
takes his good fortune philosophically.

WILL HAVE TWO CROSSES
Grace Episcopal Church Is to
Receive Gifts on Easter
Day.
A HIGH CHURCH DEPARTURE
Miss Hutchinson Gives a Memorial
and Miss Crocker a Proces
sional Cross.
Grace Episcopal Church is to be adorned
on Easter Sunday by two beautiful new
crosses, one a processional cross, the gift
of Mrs. Will Crocker, and the other a
memorial cross, for the altar, which Miss
Kate Hutchinson is presenting to the
church.
During the litetime of George W. Gibbs,
who was a liberal and enthusiastic sup
porter of Grace Church, no crosses were
used on the altar or in the service, out of
deference to his desire to avoid this form
o fsymoolism.
George W. Gibbs was senior warden,
and, though he died before his term of
office was fulfilled, his name still remains
by courtesy in the place of senior warden
till Easter day, when the year for which
he was appointed will have expired.
Miss Kate Hutchinson ordered her beau
tiful cross some months ago, before she
was aware of what been the senior warden's
wishes in the matter, but when it was ex
plained that George W. Gibbs had ob
jected to the symbolism of crosses Miss
Hutchinson readily consented to the de
sire expressed by Rev. Dr. Foute that out
of deference to Mr. Gibbs' memory ne
cross should be placed on the altar during
the period when, by courtesy, he was still
senior warden.
On Easter Sunday, however, the cross
will be placed on the altar and Dr. Foute
will read the benediction to dedicate it.
Miss Hutchinson's gift is considered one
of the most beautiful crosses in the City.
It was especially made for Grace Church
by Geissler of New York, and is in a beau
tiful style of workmanship. The cross is
forty' four inches hign and is made of solid
brass. It stands on three- steps, and is
severely Latin in outline.
In silhouette it is entirely devoid of
ornamentation, but at the intersection of
the arms with the upright in a wrought
wreath, which encircles a raised relief of
the Lamb of God.
It was the donor's intention to have the
cross quietly placed on the altar on Easter
day as a surprise to the congregation, but
a few people were let into tne secret, and
now the story of the cross is rapidly be
coming public property.
Mrs. Will Crocker's cross has not yet ar
rived from New York, though it is ex
pected to be here in time for use on Easter
day. The cross is said to be a very hand
some one, and it will be carried in ihe Dro- ,
cession with the surpliced choir.
A sensational story was published by an
evening paper last night to the effect that
George W. Gibbs dad strenuously objected
to Dr. Foute' s ritualistic tendencies, and
that among other innovations he had
strongly objected to the surpliced choir.
The superintendent of the Sunday
school, Mr. McCleilan, and George 11.
Hook were quoted as authorities for the
statement that there was a strong animus
The Memorial Brass Cross to Be Pre
sented to Grace Episcopal Church by
Miss Kate Hutchinson.
[Sketched by a " Call " artist]
against Dr. Foute among the late Mr.
Gibbs' friends in the church, and that
steps were on foot to oust tho rector.
Both gentlemen emphatically denied the
statements Jast night. "The church is
not divided," said G. H. Hook, "and no
one but the Bishop has any right to re
quest Mr. Foute' s resignation. There are
absolutely no ritualistic practices at Grace
Church.
"Mr. Gibbs used to object to surpliced
choirs, but a short time before his death
he requested the vestrymen to vote in
favor of having a surpliced choir. We
had no processionals till after his death
and we shall not have a cross on the altar
till his courtesy term of being church
warden has expired, but there is no dis
affection in the congregation on that ac
count."
Members of the congregation speak in
high terms of the efficient work done by
the surpliced choir. They say that the
good singing has greatly brightened the
services. Most Episcopalians smile at
the idea of Grace Churcn being considered
"high," though two crosses and one car
ried in procession will be a distinct inno
vation.
Miss Hutchinson's cross is a memorial
to her mother.

MISSION OF YAMAGATA.
The Japanese Marquis Is Em
bassador to the Czar's
Coronation.
TRAVELING IN MAGNIFICENCE.
He Occupies the Highest Rank as
Statesman and Soldier in
Japan.
Marquis Yaraagata, the Japanese Em
bassador, and his suite spent a rather quiet
day in thid City yesterday after tneir arri
val. The morning hours were occupied
with correspondence and recreation, and
the remainder of the time was passed in
Eight-seeing and social pleasures.
The principal men ot the party drove to
the Cliff through t ho Golden Gate Park, and
took in the Presidio in the afternoon. At
night they were guests of the Japanese
Consul at a brilliant dinner given in honor
of Marquis Yamagata.
This is one of the most important mis
sions that ever went out of Japan to
another country, and, whilÂ« the gentlemen
of hieh degree composing it pass quietly
about San Francisco, they are regarded
at home as pre-eminently quali
fied to represent their country at
a European court. .. They are indeed
distinguished men, not alone in Japan,
but ail tho world over, and it is highly
probable they will travel from here in
magnificence. They have a large portion
of the first Boor t>l the Palace Hotel,
where some of the most luxurious apart
ments are located. A retinue of secre
taries, clerks and valets swell. the number
and give the party an air of courtly, graii
deur. .
The fact that the. mission is to the coro
nation ceremonies of the Czar of Russia at
Moscow give? it a peculiar significance.
Russia's attitude toward the Oriental na
tions and her diplomatic relations with
them in connection with the Chiuo-.la
panese war are clearly remembered. The
great civilized nation of the Orient has
>hown a friendly feeling iGrthe. Muscovite
neighbor. .â¢';.'. : '
And now when there is peace and the
laitreis, so to Bpeak, are yet green on
Japan's brow, the opportunity ja almost
rjpe for Japan to ofi^r courtesies to the
â Russian court and people. Japan has ?e-
Ircted for this work Marquis Yamatrata,
who is beyond question the must <listin
cuished Japanese soldier and statesman of
tr.e time.
Dnrii ; g the war with China the French
papers spoke of him a? the Yon Moltke of
Japnn. ;ir<l he is said to combine the
qualities of a Bismarck arid a. Gladstone. .
H" is going to Europe surrounded by
soldiers, st:iT"sn!t'ii and scholars. With
him is Major Oshiroa, who; accompanied
him all through the war, an educated gen
tleman, and like many other confreres, a
hero; . .
The other member? of the suite are ac
complished, diplomatic courteous gentle
men, whospe.ik English, French and Ger
man without an accent, and' are equipped
by years of study at home and abroad to
discuss in various languages questions of
state, and in short to shiue among brilliant j
men.
Mr. Tsudzuki, the General Director of
the Imperial Archives of Japan, who is
acting as chief secretary of this mission,
speaks for the party to press representa
tives. He iÂ« a man of athletic build and
above medium stature, with a strong, in
tellectual face. p<~>;ite to the last degree,
and well versed in knowing how to make
ftimself interesting.
His conversation betrayed the strident
of political economy, the art of war and
diplomacy.
"We are going directly to the coronation
of the Czar in Moscow,"' he said, "to rep
resent Japan officially. There will be one
imperial Prince at the coronation who
will represent the court of Japan. Mar
quis "iamagata will represent tne country
officially as Embassador. Circumstances
will noi permit the Marquis to remain
long in Europe. He is the most influen
tial statesman and soldier in Japan and
cannot remain away long at this time.
"Marquis Yamagata is one of the sur
vivors of the creat revolution of 18(38. and
since then he has been prominently
identified with the reorganization. He
was responsible for every detail in the
strategy of the battle of Ping Yang, and
other battles also, and was one of the four
leaders to be honored by the Emperor
after the Chinese war with ihe title of
Marquis. He commanded the second
army at Port Arthur.
"Marquis Yama<:ata is one of these who
unite civil and military ability. A states
man and a stanch royalist, yet he per
mitted western liberal ideas to take root in
the country and let the Japanese Govern
ment be founded on the basis of self
government. He reformed almost even
branch of the Interior administration.
For instance, in the matter of church and
state, he reorganized them so that the
church became an independent body, but
controlled under the supervision of
the state while wholly free in t tie questions
of religion. He orsanized the police of
the country under western ideas, au<i has
done much in the rectification of rivers
and floods, a great work in old countries
where the forests have been cut down.
"After having tilled the office of Minis
ter of the Inf-rior for eight years he went
to Europe. On his return he was nominated j
Prime Slinisier, and while he was in that j
office the tirst parliament was revoked
in Japan. There were storms in the new
parliament, it is true, but the system has
succeeded. Soon after the parliament's
closing his health began to fail and
he resigned. The Emperor then appointed
him President of the Privy Council. In
that capacity he remained till the war
began. Th* Emperor called him to his
headquarters as aeutenant-general to ad
vise with him on military affairs, and
they worked out the plan of the campaign
tocether.
"Marquis Yamagata went to the scene
of action and was in the mid9t of the
fight as marshal, but was obliged to re
turn through failing health, which he did
only in response to imperial orders. At
home he began to recover slowly, and the
Emperor nominated him MiniÂ«ter of War,
and this office he held to the end of the
war.
"He was nominated special embassador
to the coronation."
It was Marqub Yamarrata who organized
the army of Japan on its present footing,
but that was possible only after his years
of study of the military and civil institu
tions of Western countries.
The day of the party's departure from
San Francisco has not been determined,
as the Marquis wishes to rest before con
tinuing the long journey.
THREE GREAT ARTISTS.
Ondrlcek, Matrrna and Schott Again
Appear in Concert.
Another splendid concert was piven yes
terday afternoon in the Auditorium by the
Ondricek-Materna-Schott combination.
It is difficult to say which of the three
great artists bore off the palm. Anton
Schott, as the newest comer, aroused per
haps the greatest amount of interest,
though his singing scarcely brought down
the house more than Ondricek and Ma
terna's contributions to the programme.
Scbott delighted the hearers with several
especially popular and cherished Wagner
selections, such as the "Prize Rons;" and
"The SonÂ« ot the Evenine Star." The
'Trize Song" and "Am stillen Herd"
from the "Meistersineers" were rendered
in magnificent style, lor even if cchott's
voice is a little worn, he is still a very
great artist.
As an encore he gave Schumann's "Two
Grenadiers" in splendid style, and when
the audience absolutely demanded more
ihe jovial singer responded with the
"Sons: of Sprine" from the "Valkure."
It was in the "Tannhauser" selections,
however, that Schott showed his marvel
ous versatility and compass, for he sang
the barytone aria, "The Evening Star," as
well as the tenor's grand scena, when
Tannhanser returns from Rome.
The latter, especially, was given with
splendid dramatic effect.
Vocal art could go no farther than the
way in which Materna sang the grand
aria from "La Jnive." As an encore this
gifted prima donna sang Schumann's
"Dv llein Herz." Her singing of Eliza
beth's prayer, from â¢Tannhauser," was
another piece of finished technical and
artistic skill.
Franz Ondricek played the Rubinstein
sonata on. 13, with Luckstone at the piano.
The violinist's miraculous technique, his
trio and his artistic inspiration were again
apparent in this, as in all his other
work. A "Barcarole"' of his own, a "Polo
naise" by Wieniawski and the "Rondo
dcs Lutins" ai-o aroused excited applause
and bravos. Luck*tone accompanied in
his usual sympathetic manner. Ficken
scher, who again appeared as a pianist,
rendered a waltz by Moskowky.
It is expected that two weeks hence a
final concert will be given by Ondricek
and the Wagnerian aingers.
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT.
Michael Kenny Wounded In the Leg
and Roxie Terrence Arrested for
Assault to Murder.
Roxie Terrence, the owner of some
horses at the Ingleside racetrack, and Mi
chael Kenny, an employe of John Bren
nick, another horse-owner, had been in
dulging in various stimulants yesterday
afternoon, and shortly before? o'clock last
night they got into an angry dispute out
side the racetrack.
Kenney pulled a revolver out of his
pocket and Terrence grabbed it. There
was a struggle for the possession of the
revolver and it exploded, the bullet strik
ing Kenny in the rignt leg, inflicting a
tlesh wound.
Kenny was taken to St.'Luke's Hospital,
where his wound was attended to. and
Terrence was arrested and taken to the
Seventeenth-street police station, where
he was booked on a charge of assault to
murder.
Terrence claims that the revolver acci
dentally exploded during the struggle and
witnesses to the affair bear out his state
ment, so that the charge will likely be re
duced to simple assault. Both are friends,
but whisky interfered with their friend
ship.
MENDOCINO WILD HOQB.
A Banchrr From That County Gives His
Experience With Them.
"Yes," said the gentleman from Mendo
cino, as he crossed his legs and gazed
contemplatively on the uncompleted dome
of the new City Hall, "this Central Amer
ican Pig' story in The Call reminds me of
the wild hog* of my county.
"A good many years ago some of the
ranchers turned their hogs loose on the
mountain ranges to find food and shelter
as best they could. "Well, many of these
brutes stayed domesticated and kept with
in easy distances of the farms, where they
could be found on short notice; a few,
however, wandered off into the mountain
fastnesses, and in a few generations lost
all resemblance to the domesticated ani
mal.
"I've heard that when chickens have
been turned loose in wild regions and left
to shift for themselves in a short while
they grew smaller, became of a uniform
color, got so they could use their wings as
well as quails or grouse and became finer
eating than in the tame state, but I can't
vouch for this. I don't know that I ever
saw any of them. But in the case of these
wiid hogs you may count me in with the
authorities.
"In the first place, their bristles are
longer than the ordinary animal, their
tusks are larger and keener, their eyes
have a sort of wicked way of rolling round
restlessly in the sockets, and holy smoke!
but ain't they vicious though!
"These hogs generally travel in groups,
but now and then you will meet some
surly oW boar alone, and then you want to
lookout. Unless they are pretty hungry
they won't attack a man without provoca
tion, but when they do, the safest place is
a tree. When one makes a run at you lie
generally moves too speedily to sboot, and
if you don't hit him fair and square, a bul
let will be reflected from his tough hide
like a boy's marble.
"I hate these wiid hogs; I've got a
gruuge against them. Laving aside the
fact that 1 once had a pretty narrow es
cape from their clutches about five miles
from Comptche, the best hound I ever had
was literally ripped into ribbons by one of
the ugly brute's tusKs. I was out after
deer, and in passing through some under
brush near a patch of chemisal the dog
ran into a big, ugly boar. That dog was
'came' to tackle everything, and grabbed
him by the ear. In about two minutes he
wus cut all to pieces.
"The way I put a Winchester 44 through
that nog would have delighted Buffalo
Bill. You see, in the scrimmage I was
airaid to sboot for fear of hitting the dog,
but his death is avenged."
The gentleman from Mendocino wan
dered away with a grim smile on his face.
He might have lost his hound, but the
despoiler paid the penalty.
Died From Mushroom Poisoning;.
Elia Casina, 41 years of age, a laborer by oc
cupation, died last evening at the French Hos
pital supposedly from mushroom poisoning.
Oasina was taken ill four days ago In his resi
dence, 1501 Powell street, "after having par
taken heartily of mushrooms. He was taken
to the hospitm yesterday morning and a few
hours after his arrival there was dead. The
body was taken to the Morgue, where an
autopsy will be held to determine the exact
cause of death.

An Italian Singer.
Signorina Estreda Belinfante, who is staying

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH Â«9, 1896.
DEFENDING THE MISSION
South Side Residents Will Stand
by Their Property
Rights.
THE NOE CLAIMS DENIED.
A Mass-Meeting to Be Held Next Sat
urday Night at Mission Turn
Verein Hall.
About?3oo property-owners of the South
Side were present at last night's meeting
of the Mission Defense Association, John
H. Grady presiding.
A. P. Van Duzer, secretary and attorney
of the organization, stated that since the
last meeting between forty and fifty new
members had been added to the ranks of
the association and twenty-five more had
signed the roll just before the meeting
opened, raising the membership to 410.
Referring to the Noe claims, he deprecated
the practice of certain building contractors
in refusing to accept mortgages on proper
ties whose owners would not pay for quit
claim deeds from the Noe claimants. He
said intending builders should explain to
the contractors that their lands were truly
unencumbered and their titles flawless,
and hence that they were in a position to
mortgage their lots in order to have build
ings erected upon them. Any other pro
cedure, he contended, might be construed
into a quasi admission of the validity of
the Noe claims.
The judicial trial of the issues involved
in the claims would, he believed, take
place in two or three weeks. In the inean
lime he had prepared answers on the part
of eighty-five property-owners which
would then come up for bearing. He had
every reason to hope that the Noe claims
would soon be definitely adjudged invalid
and titles to Mission properties set at rest.
He refeired also to the laws of Spain and
Mexico under which the Noe heirs ad
vance their claims, and said the matter
would be sifted to the bpttom and
decided once for all in a very short time.
The executive committee reported
having met with the Mission High bchool
Club on the evening before. At that
meeting the High School Club invited the
Defense Association to unite with it; but
the committee was not in favor of such a
union, the objects of the organizations
being separate and distinct.
Mr. Van Duser, in the absence of the
treasurer, reported that about $125 of the
association's funds were in the hands of
the treaiurer, $115 in the custody of the
secretary, and that about $100 had been
expended in the payment ol bills.
Judee Van Reynegom reported that ar
rangements had been completed by the
c remittee, whereof he was chairman, for
the holding of a mass-meeting on next
Saturday evening at Mission Turn Verein
Hall. Musicians and speakers had been
engaged, and J. D. Pnelan had promised
to preside and address the meeting.
Daniel Kelly further reported that he
had secured the use of twelve torches and
twenty-four band musicians for the oc
casion, wliich so delighted the younger
portion of the gathering that he was nom
inated grand marshal forthwith.
George Walton of the same committee
asked for donations in aid of the mass
meeting and a number of those present
subscribed sums ranging from 50 cents to
$5. Mr. Kelly, when asked to contribute,
rebelled.
"The grand marshal has to provide his
own horse," he contended, "and that will
cost him enough." He relented later in
the evening, however, and set his name
down for a generous donation.
The mass-meeting will deal principally
with the establishment of a park and high
school at the Mission, and as both matters
seem to interest all property-owners in thÂ«
section, it wjis decided that lists be in
readine3s and the attendants at the meet
ing given an opportunity to join a general
association of particular clubs to be known
as the Mission Improvement League. This
matter was turned over to the committee,
Judge Van Reynegom promising that it
would receive all due attention.
A discussion took place regarding the
park and huh school. Lake Merced and
the two Jewish cemeteries were men
tioned as possible sites for the park, while
many of the members were in favor of
purchasing the Cogswell College building
lor a nigh school or of leasing that prop
erty for a long period.
Judge Van Reynegom agreed with the
Cogswell project, but thought if that
school were selected the building and land
should be bought outright.
Other members spoke in the same
strain. It was decideu that, while the De
fense Association would always be in sym
pathy with any movement for the better
ment of the Mission, it would never lose
sight of its own main aimâ the protection
of South-side homes against the claims of
all who might seek to cast doubt upon the
present land tenure.
BROWN IN HIS PULPIT
Will Tell His Friends Again To-
Day What It Is to Be a
Christian.
The Kalamazoo Telegram the Worst
Yet â Mrs. Cooper's Class in Na
tive Sons' Hall.
If all goes well Pastor Brown will preach
at the First Congregational Church this
morning to his partisans and the usual
number of curious-minded who have only
seen the reverend gentleman in the pen
sketches of the recent scandal.
He also promises to entertain all who
care to attend the night services with a
dissertation appropriate to current events.
There is a prevailing belief among the
opponents of Dr. Brown that it is no
longer possible for the pastor' 3 friends to
pretend to close their eyes to the short
comings of their hero.
These friends were sensibly shocked by
the verdict of the council, but when Dr.
Brown literally hurled the findings back
into the face of his ecclesiastical brethren
they took courage and again pinned their
faith to their pastor. Tnen came the ex
pose of the United Press telegram which
Attorney Nagle made a show of sboulder
ine. Hardly had the excitement of this
incident died away when the Kaiamazoo
dispatch came to light, convincing those
who stili remained in doubt that Dr.
Brown had stated what was not true ex
cept so far as it reflected his own elastic
way of interoreting the findings of the
council.
This Kaiamazoo telegram, which says,
"I am acquitted on every charge â C. O.
Brown," has been discussed and severely
criticized on all sides. A prominent mem
ber of the Bay Conference said yesterday
that nothing could now save the pastor.
Hia case will come up at the April session
of the conference, and there is little reason
to doubt that he will be severely dealt
with. The New York Tribune of March
22 says:
Although the Congregational council of San
Francisco lias rendered its verdict on the Rev.
Dr. Charles O. Brown, accused of grave offenses,
this report has not ended the scandal. The
council found that the charge of adultery had
not been proved, but it declared that its mem
bers could not understand why the preacher
paid $500 hush-money to a woman whom he
declared a blackmailer, uor why he attempted
to intimidate a young woman of his congrega
tion, who he knew possessed a vote and was
not favorable to him.
Instead of accepting this mild reproof,
Brown at a church meeting criticized the
council harshly and succeeded in defeating a
vote ot thanks by his church to the council.
This has caused much ill feeling. But what is
worse, the preacher, on tno evening of the
council's decision, dictated a message to both
press associations declaring that he had been
acquitted of all charges, and the associations
sent this news to the East. This imposition
upon the public Brown will have to answer
for, and the feeling agÃinst him is so strong
that it may lead to a request for his resigna
tion. The whole scandal has been deplorable
in its effects.
Mrs. Cooper's Bible class will meet at
12:45 in the Native Sons' Hall, just one
door south of the Mason-street entrance of
the church. The subject for general dis
cussion is: "What is the governing force
within us? Where is the center of our life
and character? 1 '
The Society of Christian Endeavor has
withdrawn from the church, and until the
pastor resigns or is deposed will meet in
the Native Son's Hall. The first meeting
in the new place will occur to-night from
6:30 to 7:3o o'clock. Henry Littlefield has
been appointed to conduct the exercises.
Death of Alias Webb.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 28.â Miss Ade
laide Webb died yesterday at her home, 914
Eagle avenue, after having suffered from
lung troubles for the past two years. She*
was aged 28 years, 5 months and 17
days. Deceased was the dauglitcr of Mrs.
Adelaide E. Grennel, who was the widow
of the well-known mining man of Ca!a
veras, Eldridge Webb. Before her fatal ill
ness came upon her, Bhe was prominent
in San Francisco as an elocutionist, and
appeared at many entertainments given
for charity. It was at an entertainment,
in fact, that she caught a bad cold, which
soon developed into pneumonia and finally
caused her deatb. The funeral will take
place to-nlorrow at 2:30 o'clock. Rev. Lane
of the Episcopal Church officiating. The
interment will be at Mountain View Ceme
tery.
MURPHY WILL CASE ENDS
The Contestants Get a Share to
Prevent Further Expensive
Litigation.
Judge Frick Orders Distribution and
the Supreme Court Dismisses
the Last Appeal.
Oakland Oefice San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 28. j
The celebrated Murpny will contest,
which attracted considerable attention in
this State and in London about two
years ago, is ended. A few weeks ago the
fact that a compromise had been reached
was published in this paper and the news
was confirmed to-day.
This morning an order was made by the
Supreme Court that the appeal of the con
testants against the decision rendered last
January by Judge Frick should be dis
missed by stipulation. As soon as the
order was made the case was brought be
fore Judge Frick in the Superior Court
and he made an order distributing the es
tate of the late Anna L. Murphy of San
Francisco to the three daughters, Mary
Ellen, now the wife of Don Dominguez, a
Spanish nobleman, Frances J. Murphy
and Mary M. D. Murphy, share and share
alike.
The will of Mrs. Murphy excluded her
sons, Samuel and Dan Murphy, and her
daughter, Lady Wolseley, from any share
in the estate. The children not mentioned
in the will contested it, and the case was
probably the most celebrated ever fought
in Alameda County courts. It caused the
making public ot the famous Murphy
family letters, which eet society a-gossip
ing and which furnished interesting prat
tle for several days tor pages of newspaper
reading. Attorneys Wilson & Wilson,
Garber, Boalt & Bishop, Hall & Karl,
Victor and George Metcalf, A. A. Moore,
W. W. Foote and Deering all figured in
the case. The will was eventually set aside
by Judge Henshaw in the Superior Court,
but the Supreme Court reversed the de
cision. The litigation threatened to be
almost interminable, and finally when
there was a danger of the vast estate being
eaten up in litigation a compromise was
effected.
Under the terms|of the compromise the
contesting children will each receive about
$50,000 and the three sisters about $10U,000.
The exact terms of the compromise have
not been made known, but enough has
transpired to show nearly what figured
were agreed upon.
There were present this morning at the
time the order of tbe court was made At
torney Wheeler of San Francisco, repre
senting the contestants; Attorney peer
ing, representing the legatees, and Victor
Metcalf, the administrator of the estate,
who was also represented by George Met
calf and A. A. Moore.
When Administrator Metcalf made his
final report recently and asked for the dis
tribution of the esiate he showed that he
had $39,097 89 on hand. He states that
the estate, which was once of most liberal
proportions, has dwindled down to one
valued at about $500,000.
In tbe proceedings this morning Attor
ney Wheeler made several objections,
mainly in behalf of the minor children of
Eugene Murphy, but they were all over
ruled and exceptions noted. He took this
precaution in the event of a hitch regard
ing the compromise.
The Judge ruled against Mr. Wheeler on
all points, and finally ordered the estate
distributed to the three daughters in ac
cordance with the terms of the will of
Anna L. Murphy. The estate is in the
bauds of Victor Metcaif. It consists of
$39,089 cash, stock in various corporations,
a fourth interest in the Murptiy block at
Market, McAllister and Jones streets, and
also the property on Bush and Sansome
streets, in San Francisco.
"The dismissal of the appeal by the
Snpreme Court to-day ends this "case,"
said Attorney Metcalf "to-night. "There is
nothing now to hinder the distribution,
and it is safe to say that the Murphy case
will not be heard of again in the courts."

Demurrer Not Sustained.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 28.â The city
received the worst of the legal battle to
day over the injunction proceedings
brought to stop work on the electric plant.
A general demurrer was interposed to the
complaint, which, had it been sustained,
would have put an end to the litigation.
The demurrer took the main trend that
the complaint did not state a cause of ac
tion, and that the City Trustees .had not
transcended their legal rights. Judge
Frick refused to sustain the demurrer, and
the city's attorney was then given ten
days to answer. Lawyers are generally of
the opinion that under the present Jaw the
Trustees have exceeded their authority in
going into the business of selling commer
cial lieht.
EDOFF`S ANSWER TO MAY
The Policy and Work of the
Prohibition Party Caus
tically Reviewed.
RESPECTIVE LABORS COMPARED
The California State Protective Asso
ciation in Favor of Local
Option.
For the past two days the communica
tion of O. G. May of Berkeley, published
in The Call of Friday, criticizing the work
and aims of the California State Protec
tive Association has been largely the
topic of conversation among the liquor
men and the prohibition people on both
sides of the bay. In reply to Mr. May,
J. P. Edoff, president of the association,
had this to say yesterday :
"It has not been my habit to notice the
vaporings of obscure assailants who are
always rushing into the public prints,
when they can secure the consent of the
editor, to hurl venom at an imaginary foe,
and I see no substantial reason why Mr.
May snould be made an exception to my
general policy in this respect.
"The subject-matter of his communica
tion is the old threadbare sermon which
has been preached and sung by the Pro
hibitionist for a century, and its teachings
are regarded as so impracticable by
modern civilization as to scarcely merit
consideration.
"In this State the prohibition party has
been in active existence and operation lor
more than a quarter of a century, and yet
at the last election their vote was so insig
nificant as to scarcely entitle it to be
dignified by the term scattering. I men
tion this simply for the purpose of calling
attention to ihe fact tnat the prohibitionist,
as represented by Mr. May, ib narrow, con
tracted, intolerant, bigoted, selfish and
opinionated, and hence it is that t:;ey
make such little headway in their attempt
to persuade the body politic into the adop
tion of their views.
"That they as a whole mean well may
be admitted, but to differ with them upon
the subject is to invite a 'cyclone of vituper
ation and abuse, which is always the
ready weapon of a narrow intellect.
"A fair sample of this intolerance and
bigotry is conspicuously apparent in the
communication of Mr. May. Without
any knowledge or acquaintance with my
self, or, so far as I am aware, with any
other member of our organization, he
proceeds to launch a tirade of billingsgate
and falsehood against us.
"His reference to other matters and the
interests they represent shows the flippant
and recKiess use of a dagger in the hands
of a fool.
"Now, with regard to his opinions as to
the objects of our association I have no
desire to make any comment or to enter
into any discussion with Mr. May through
the press or elsewhere. His gross perver
sion of the facts is so marked that any
thing like a fair basis of argument with
men of his mentality is utterly impossible,
and therefore such a discussion would
prove not only unproiitable, but absurd,
lie is either ignorant of the truth respect
ing the present status of the liquor traffic
in California, or does not possess sufficient
moral courage to admit what is common
knowledge, and that is that our association
has accomplished greater results in the
two years of its existence in the line it is
following than all of the Prohibitionists
s<ince the organization of the State
government.
"Neither is his statement true that it was
or is our purpose to wrest from the local
authorities the right to regulate or sup
press the traffic. Upon the contrary, at
the last session of the Legislature we at
tempted the enactment of a local option
statute, submitting to a vote of the people
of each county the question of license or
no license, which cannot now be done by
any valid enactment. This measure was
defeated by the efforts of people fashioned
after the caliber of Mr. May, and for no
other or more substantial reason than that
the measure proceeded from the liquor
dealers them. elves.
"We also attempted to increase the
license revenue by more than $2,000,000
in the State, with a view of thereby les
sening the number of retail saloons, and
by so doing very greatly diminishing the
opportunities for low or disorderly places,
and yet this action upon our pare is con
strued by the man from Berkeley as an at
tempt to plant a saloon at every man's
door. In other words, he seems to con
sider that to double or treble the tax upon
the traffic will have the effect of multiply
ing instead of diminishing the number of
establishments, which is quite in keeping
with the logic of his position throughout
his whole vicious tirade.
"And finally he says that our avowed
purpose to eschew politics is a mere pre
tenbe and a sham. I wish only to add in
this connection that the example, as well
as the results accomplished by the politi
cal efforts of the Prohibitionists, is well
calculated to persuade sensible people to
enter M>me other field than the political
arena if they desire to be a factor in pub
lic affairs."
TANGERMAN TO GO BACK
Hale & Norcross Directors to
Support the Superin
tendent.
Stockholders Willing That the Mine
Shall Be Closed Down During
the Lawsuit.
The board of directors of Hale <fc Nor
cross have formally determined to send
H. W. Tangerman back to his place as
superintendent of the mine at Virginia
City. As for Tamre.-man himself he says
he is quite ready to go at their bidding.
"I have a clear consciance and am not
afraid," he said yesterday. "I never did
anybody there any harm, much less any
wrong, and I stand in no fear. Had they
not taken me at a complete disadvantace
thfy would not have succeeded as they
did. I was fully heeled ; twice they at
tempted to enter my house, but they did
not succeed. Had they come in there
would have been a dozen of them fair in
their tracks. So you see I was quite pre
pared, and had they tackled me on the
street the incident would not have re
sulted as it did.
"They came upon me while I was sit
ting in a barber's chair â half a dozen of
them with revolvers pointed at my head.
They marcbed with me in that way, giving
me no chance at all. 1 asked them what
they had against me and they said I was
an A. P. A. When I denied this they said
I had been tried and found guilty, and
that was all the satisfaction I could get.
"Now. the fact is," continued Mr. Tan
german, "I was taught to deal witli my
iellowman as I would have him deal with
me and I have always done so. I have
lived in Virginia City for many years. I
was in the grocery business there, and
wheu I sold out I had $37,000 on the books
that people owed rae and I have never
asked one of them for a cent. Some of
these very people were among those debt
ors â peopie whom 1 have fed. They say
there were 150 of them. That is not true.
I counted twenty-eight who were con
spicuous. There may have been thirty
altogether.
"As I have never done them any harm
on the contrary, Dave befriended some of
them, never said a word against the Min
ers' Unionâ it is pretty clear to me tnat
they have been paid to do this thing.
"You see 1 have been on the directors
Bide all through this lawsuit. The other
side know that they cannot use me many
way; that is to say, I cannot be bought to
do anything that is not exactly square.
As a witness I was very lenient witn them.
I did not tell near all f know. I let them
down as easy as I could. But they insti
gated this outrage upon me, 1 am sure oi
it. It was easy enough to buy a few lead
ers who couJdwork upon the others with
the A. P. A. story, or some other equally
as foolish and unfounded.
"It was not a pleasant experience. The
directors say they will stand by me and
see me vindicated. They nave engaged
counsel for the purpose. I shall not hesi
tate to go back wuen they are ready to
send me. I do not knew when that will
be."
M. W. Fox, speaking about the matter,
said: "The looters of the mine are the
rioters. It is all one affair. The stock
holders are not worrying about the mine
being closed down. It so huppens that
the closing of the mine at this juncture is
a saving of money. The stockholders are
perfectly willing to have it closed down
until the end of this lawsuit. Mr. Bag
gett, the company's attorney, is out of the
City. His letter to the Governor of Ne
vada was sent away before he left. No
action will be taken until after his return. "
Miner* Still Triumphant.
CARSON, Nev., March 28. âThere is
likely to be nothing further at present in
the Hale & Norcross Company's demand
for troops to protect Tangerman. Yester
day, after acting Governor Sadler's refusal
to call out troops on the ground that no re
quest had been made by tlie Sheriff, he left
for the eastern part of the State.
Objection to a Portuguese Funeral.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 23.â The sud
den death of Giuseppe Vignolo, a promi
nent Italian resident, and the removal of
his body to an Oakland undertaker'sestab

King," haÃ caused unfavorable comment
among ihe Italian citizens. Visrnolo

The Famous Explorer Discovers a

Professor P. E. Wolff, M.8., E.L., a
noted naturalist and traveler, who has
been exploring British New Guinea an>l
the Solomon, Friendly and the Fiji islands
for the last fear years, is in the City.
He came by the Warriruoo to Victoria
and thence down by coast steamer. He
brought boxes and bales of anthropological
and ethnological specimens, some of which
are entirely new.

plored many wild countries during the

past dozen years, is looking much the
worse for the siege he has run. In some
of the islands he had as many as a dozen
guides, all well armed, and along with them
were as many more natives, who were
used as carriers. He traveled like Stanley
in Africa when ne was making his way
through the Dark Forest.
Dr. Wolff looks frail of constitution,
and his face is drawn and yellow. His
hard experiences seem to sit lightly on his
mind, however, now that he is through
them. He has been in a half dozen great
enterprises at different periods of his life.
He is an American, horn in New Jersey,
and his father was a manufacturer of oils
in New York. He went abroad early. He
studied in .France and Belgium, where he
obtained his degree, and after that "was
attached to the Franco-Egyptian College
in Alexandria. Then he went to Jerusa
lem and made explorations for nearly a
year.
In the past thirteen years he has been
collecting for various governments. He
has been during this time collecting for
the Smithsonian Institution, the War De
partment, and various institutes, societies
and museums of France, Germany and
Italy.
He was the secretary of the famous Ant
arctic Commission, organized some time
ago, with the celebrated Baron Nordensk
jold us president, and served for one year.
He also succeeded in raising $28,000 for the
Antarctic expedition, whose purposes were
not then earned out. but which now seem
in a fair way to be successful. Dr. 'Wolff
save he was able to become secretary
through Baron yon Mueller, the famous
botanist, who was his warm friend.
At the solicitation of Dr. David Starr
Jordan and President Kellogg of Stanford
and Berkeley universities, he will deliver
several lectures, which will be illustrated
by photographs in some instances.
*"I left for an exploration of the islands
in 1892, after 1 had visited Samoa." sail
he "and went to the coast of Northwest
ern Australia to investigate the pearl shell
fisheries. I thence proceeded to Albany
and Port Darwin. I explored parts of
British New Guinea, the Solomon Islands,
the Friendly group and Fiji.
"I found many new and strange things
in science and" had some very narrow
escapes from ferocious natives. I went in
the British ship Royalist to toe Solomon
Islands I then set out and managed to
Ret between fifty and sixty miles in the
interior, as far as I dare go. I had ten or
twelve guides, all of whom were well
armed and my supplies were brought
along by carriers. The country was so
beautiful: there was so much to interest
me from an ethnological and anthropo
logical point of view that* I desired at all
hazards to go farther. It was extremely
dangerous to attempt it.
< The Governor was appealed to by me
to send lip fifty Snyder rifles, but he
wouldn't do it. The fact is the Govern
ment was afraid I would be killed. They
dida't want anybody to go up, because if
anyone was killed a lot of talk would
result and they feared it would be bad for
them. " . -
"Daring this expedition to these islands
I, earl}' one morning, plunged into the
bush from the ship, and against the ad
vice of the captain, and got forty skulls
from one of their shrines. These' skulls,
although they are of enemies whom the
cannibals have eaten, are sacred to them,
because the pile takes on the nature of a
shrine. Luckily, I got away without any
of the natives seeing me. If they had, it
would have been almost certain death.
"I found in the^e islands the rare iory
lorias solatirus, a species of the parrot. Its
breast was a bright scarlet, while the back
plumage was a peacock blue, turning
green toward the tail. It was an exceed
ingly pretty bird, of the size of a young
cockatoo.
"In Samoa I found the dodo, a bird sup
posed to be extinct, but which is repre
sented there by a unique species. Tlie
bird is called the manuma by the natives.
The scientific name is didiincnla strigi
rostris. The bird is worth $300 in Eng
land. I obtained a number of specimens,
one of which went to Chief Justice Ceder
crantz.
"Strangely enough in one of the islands
I explored 1 found a bay full of whales. It
is a new whaling-ground unknown to the
world. It was in Blanche Bay, of the
Solomon Islands. I saw forty whales in
line, followed by their calves, all moving
out of the bay. It was a remarkable sight.
The adult whales were monstrous creatures.
The discovery of whales in that locality
will no doubt, be of great interest to the
world.
"In all my work I was collecting speci
mens as a general thing relating to man.
I had great success, and am glad to get out
of the wilds after so long a time."
Dr. Wolff is on his way to Paris. He is
the particular friend of Sarah Bernhardt

SHARP CONFIDENCE GAME
Arthur H. Steil Swindled Out of
$iooo by a Bogus Foot
race.
J. W. Fiynn and James Ryan, Two
Sporting Men, Arrested for
Grand Larceny.
J. W. Flynn and James Ryan, sporting
men, were arrested yesterday by Detectives
Bee and Harper on the charge of grand
larceny. The complaining witness is
Arthur H. Steil, son of Henry Steil, the
tailor, in the Chronicle building, 646 Mar
ket street.
Steil is $1000 out of pocket by a clever
confidence trick which has been success
fully played in this City on more than one
occasion. He has a friend named C. C.
Mclver, and a few days ago Mclver went
to him and represented that he bad a
'sure thing." He told him there was to
be a foot race between Flynn and Ryan in
Golden Gate Park last Thursday, and as
Ryan was the champion 75-yard runner of
the world he could easily defeat Flynn.
Mclver suggested that Steil should bet
$1000 on Kyan. Steil demurred, but was
finally persuaded to put up the money on
the understanding that he should be pres
ent to see the race.
On Thursday Steil and Mclver went out
to the pars and Ryan and Flynn were
there, the latter stripped for the race. As
soon as Steil appeared Ryan ran up to him
and said: "How much money have you
gotto put up on me?" Steil" pulled the
$1000 out of hiÃ pocket and Ryan grabbed
it and ran, picking up his clothes as he
passed them. Steil started to go after
nim, but Flynn pulled a revolver out of
his pocket and threatened to shoot him
if he followed Ryan.
Flynn then handed the revolver to a
man" named Kerr. who was supposed to be
the stakeholder, and he kept Steil at bay
while Hynn ran in the direction Ryan
had taken. . 8
Steil notified the police and they ad
vised him to swear out a warrant for the
arrest of Flynn and Ryan. It was placed
in the hands of detectives Bee and Harper
and yesterday they arrested the two men.
Kerr, the stakeholder, has disappeared.
Captain Lees said last night that he did
not think Molver was a party to the con
fidence game, but had been made an inno
cent tool of by Flynn and Kyan.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
SHAW SHOWED HIS WORTH
Landed Wheel of Fortune a
Clever Winner for the
Burns Stake.
LOVDAL FINISHED SECOND.
The Crack Crescendo Was a Hot Favor
ite, but Faltered the Last Furlong.
Favorites Beaten.
The Burns stake, worth $6000 to the win
ning horse, was decided at the Bay Dis
trict Track yesterday, and resulted in one
of the prettiest contests of the season. Of
the ten starters the v. inner turned up in
Joe Harvey's grand mare Wheel of For
tune, ridden by Al Shaw. The event was
formerly known as the Spreckeis stake,
and over a year ago was captured by the
black colt Lissak, with the horse owned by
the' turfman after whom the stake was
named finishing in the place. Yesterday
Lovdal, owned by the senior partner of the
firm of Burns & Waterhouse, also finished
in second place.
The opening betting favored Lovdal, who
opened a 7 to 5 favorite, but closed at twos.
The big plunge was made on Crescendo,
who was backed down from 2% to 1 to 6 to
5. All of the other starters went back in
the betting, Wheel of Fortune being quoted
at 15 as tne norses were called. At the
post the lower strand of webbing was twice
broken by over-anxious starters before the
field was sent away to a fine start. Pass
ing the stand Service was lirst. followed in
close order by Silver State and Crescendo.
The pace set was a slow one, the old
horse still maintaining first position as the
stretch for home was reached, with Cres
cendo and Lovdal at his t<ide, fighting for
the lead. Isaglee Burkes bis chestnut
soon took command, and looked to have
the race at his mercy a furlong from the
wire, but he faltered perceptibly nearing
the paddock, and Lovdtrl torged to the
front. All of this time Shaw on Wheel of
Fortune had been persevering, and the
mare, finishing with her accustomed
gameness, took the big prize by
a long neck. The favorite was third,
a short length further away. The time,
2:o9}Â£, was good, considering the condition
of the track, which was not of the light
ning order.
The big event attracted a far smaller
crowd than on the occasion of its former
decision. It was large, though, compared
to the e very-day attendance, and the fifteen
bookmakers did a lively business.
The various events were all well con
tested, the recent exposures of fraud evi
dently having as enervating effect on the
jockeys. At that it was a poor day for
first choices, but two of them getting to
the wire in front.
The opening race, a cheap six-furlong
affair, was gathered in very handily by
the 7 to o choice Mirambo, with Shaw up.
Veva. the second choice, was a close j
second.
The four-furlong scramble ended in] a
head finish between Caspar, Lumina and i
Rev del Tierra, the former ruling a hot U
to 20 favorite gaining the verdict.
This was followed by another six-furlong
run for the selling-plater division. Palo
macita, with Jones up. and a sto 1 shot
in the hotting, led the 9to 5 favorite. Sera
pnin, from the start, winning easily by
three lengths.
The mile and a furlong steeplechase I
resulted disastrously for the talent. Three
Forks was heavily" played, goi-ng to the j
post 7 to 5. After leading to the last jump, j
tipence on Sir Keel brought the old sulker
up and, outfooting the first choice^home,
won by a neck. W. L. Munson was a dis
tant third.
Sixth on the card was a six-furlong spin,
with Ricardo, Sir Play, Kamsin and
Realization facing the issue. Sir Play was
a pronounced 7 to 10 choice, but after lead
ing to the stretch was easily beaten in the
run to the wire by Kamsin. The winner
opened at even money, receding to 7 to 5.

Valuable Gift to the University.
The mining and mineralogtcal departments
of the University of California have received
two very valuable donations from J. B. Ran
dol, for many years manager of the New Al
maden quicksilver mine and now one of the
owners of the Mirabel quicksilver mine.
For many years Mr. Rando ]has gathered
together all the available literature on the
mining and metallurgy of quicksilver, as also
many valuable manuscript reports and collec
tions of newspaper clippings on the statistics
of the subject. The collection includes books
and pamphlets in French, German and Span
ish, as well as in English. The entire collec
tion has been given to the University.
He has also presented a number of valuable
quicksilver ores from Now Ahnaden and other
puns of California, as well as specimens of ores
from Almaden In Spain and Idria in Austria.
The collection contains many rare and perfect
specimens of cinnabar crystals and illustrates
me varied form in jvhicn. quicksilver occurs
in all parts of the world, and will be of great
use to mining students.
ANNUAL SCHOOL REPORT
Superintendent Babcock on the
Various Institutions of
Learning.
Great Progress Has Been MadeâObitu
aries on Deceased Teachers
and Statistics.
The annual report of the Superintendent
of Common Schools, compiled by the
incumbent, Madison Babcock, has just
been issued, showing the great prog
ress during the past twelve months of
the various institutions of learning under
the control of the Board of Education. In
his introductory remarks, Mr. Babcock
says :
Gentlemen: Herewith please find report for
year ending Juno, IS'.)5. But for the sickness
and subsequent death of Superintendent
Moulder, this would have appeared as his re
port. He had devoted much time and thought
to a study of the conditions of the schools, tind
hnd he lived, would have written a report lull
of wise and helpful suggestions.
It is with no small degree of embarrassment
that I assume the duties of an oflice ihat has
been filled by such men as Denman, Mann, An
derson, Swett and Moulder. No one who has
not undertaken it knows how great the re
sponsibility. To fill such a position even con
scientiously, not to say aDly, requires no small
degree of wise forethought and careful discre
tion. A Superintendent of Schools in a large
city finds it quite as difficult to tell what not
to "do as what to do. Any one can tear down
and terrorize, but it remains for few to uuild
with wisdom and courage.
In thl3 connection, permit me to say that
my highest ambition is to assist in some de
gree in the creation of higher ideals among
principals and teachers, and thus secure to the
children in our schools such instruction us
shall fit them for tiie highest type of Ameri
can citizenship.
Considerable space is devoted to the
various brandies of study anil the im
proved methods of teaching* and biograph
ical sketches of the most prominent edu
cators in the department are also given.
Obituary notices of Andrew J. Moulder,
whom Mr. Babcock succeeded, and Miss
Lillie E. Gallagher, Miss Helen A. Sing
ley, Miss Mary Batten, Mrs. F. E.
Reynolds, Mrs. A. C. Palmer, Miss Caro
line K. Putnam. Miss Eva White, Dudley
C. Stone and James G. Kennedy are made
a feature of the report, which concludes
with a complete statistical report of the
condition ot the schools during the year
past. In conclusion Mr. Baocock says:
In conclusion I wish to express in most posi
tive phrase my high appreciation of the people
and the press of ban Francisco for their veiy
cordial support of the schools; of the pupils
for their uniformly studious habits and their
almost always good-natured, cheery obedience :
orthe teachers for their genial, earnest, able
devotion to duty, and of the members of tho
present Board of Education for the intelligent
courage with wnich they manage the schools.
BOTH DOWN ON COBBLES
Street Superintendent Ashworth
to the Merchants' Asso
ciation.
PLEADS THE LACK OF FUNDS.
The Association Is to Make Plans for
Needed Improvements in the
Near Future.
Conditions on the principal streets are
commencing to receive some degree of con
sideration. The cobblestone, that marvel
to the . tourist, is apparently doomed;
though, like other bad things, it will prob
ably be long a-dying. The following let
ter on the subject was received at the head
quarters of the Merchants' Association
yesterday :
San Francisco, March 26, 1896.
I F. ! W, Dohrmann Esq., President Merchants' As
sociation, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: I herewith
submit to your consideration a statement of
the condition of the Street Department fund
for the liscal year ending June 30, 1896, show
ing the expenditures made up to March 1,
1896, and the balances to the credit of the de
partment on that date, as also a list of out
standing liabilities against the fund.
I desire to specially direct your attention to
the fact that in submitting to the Auditor an
estimate of the amount required for the use of
the Street Department for the fiscal year, I in
cluded therein an item for the amount required
for "repaying streets now paved with cobbles
151 blocks and forty-eight crossings," which I
estimate would cost $452,690.
In the "Keport of the Superintendent of Pub
lic Streets, Highways and Squares," submitted
to the Board of Supervisors on July 15, 1895,
appears the the following: "The cobble pave
ment should no longer be allowed to disgrace
our City, and I earnestly recommend that on
streets of suitable grade the cobbles be re
moved and replaced with a smooth and noise
less pavement." â¢
Municipal Reports, San Francisco, 1894-95.
Of a total appropriation .of $326,500, not
more than one-third of this appropriation is
within the control and at the disposal of the
street Superintendent.
The only portion of the fund over which he
exercises any disposition is that which is com
prehended within the scope of the immediate
necessities incident to the department. The
remainder is subject to the special appropria
tions made by the Board of Supervisors for
particular improvements and the subsequent
pleasure of said board as to other improve
ments petitioned for from time to time.
Your notice is respectfully directed to the
balance available lor accepted streets and
sewers of $08,899 52, out of a specially fixed
appropriation of $200,000. The drain on this
special sum by reason of expenditures for
necessary repairs of accepted streets, cleaning
and repairing sewers, in addition to the de
NEW TO-DAY.
Do You Want
â¢~n A STRONG MAN who is vig-
(^'â¢\ ** orous in muscular power is
Â£& _^JA2J' x '" v >-/ v *n^ the envy of his fellow-man. He
â  i ~lJ.*'?j ! ' "^T-S; is looked upon as one of nature's
- ,â i - ;â¢?- â 'â¢ d f/J noblemen. And yet how many
5 J?r~i men there are who would gladly
i~Ji!K-) - sacrifice that muscular strength
/jC^^^u^u** l^ for the recovery of a still more
Jhwj?^^/ precious element that has been
sk \ )<\ lost. Men are not always what
fjsj&h^j^:> they seem. Almost daily we come
\ WK^'^X * n conversation with men who
)^tjo\\ v\ seem strong, vigorous, but who
I ' \\\ l\ â¢ have begun to fail in the force of
| jjflj /a â¢ manhood, and who would, in a
V J^'=^ â ''-L^ few years, on account of this
y^ss^^w^Miamml- treacherous, secret waste, fail vie
w '- t tims to that most hateful disease
âNervous Debility. This is the enemy which in time destroys
even the muscular power and all power of mankind.
Would you protect yourself against any possibility of this
calamity ? Ignorance of the symptoms is no excuse for permit-
ting the weakness to grow on you. If you would study this sub-
ject for your own good send for the little book, ''Thr-ee Classes of
Men," which will be mailed free, closely sealed. It is plain and
honest, and its contents are instructive.
SCIATICA.
"I want you to know what your Electric Belt has done for me. I have been a sufferer from
Sciatica for rive years or more, and It just did me up at times. When I would stoop over I would
be unable to get up again without great pain, and suffered a great deal from it. 1 got relief in
two days from your Belt, and my back is now as well as ever. It has done me much good in
other respects also, and I know it to be a good thing. I believe that people who need it ought to
know of its value. I wouldn't part with mine for any consideration."â S. D. VALENTINE of
Francis- Valentine Company, Printers, 517 Clay st., San Francisco. ;'i?/'n^
RHEUMATISM.
"I bought your Belt last October for muscular Rheumatism. I had great pain in my arms,
! legs and back. 1 could not stand in an upright position without severe pain; my arms were so
bad I could not raise them to my head. I saw an improvement as soon as I put the Belt on, and
since then I have felt like a different man. Your Belt has done wonders for me, and I would not
part with it for $100."â C. L. LAMOREAUX, 517 Wall st., Los Angeles, Cal.
LAME BACK. /_
"You ask me for a statement concerning the full effect of your Belt on me. I suffered for 14
years as bad as any man could. I used to have to roll out" of bed, and if I sat down I could not
get up again for ten minutes. I would almost cry with pain at times. I tried everything and
got no relief till I got your Belt. I received the Belt on the 7th of February and put "it on in the
evening of the same day and wore it all night. I had not a pain in the morning and have had
none since."â TlloS. O'CONNOR, 64 South River St., San Jose, Cal. 'â¢ <
VARICOCELE.
r rll\lV\/VL<L<Lit
"I bought one of your strong-power Belts for Varicocele and weakness. My case was one of
long standing and was aggravated by the use of all kinds of medicines, from which I got no
relief. It made a change at once, and in a week or two the swollen veins were greatly reduced,
and for the good your Belt has done me I will always recommend it."â UEO. E. NASH, Fifth
aye. and Crocker st., Los Angeles, Cal.
PARALYSIS.
"Five weeks ago to-day, when I got your Belt, I was helpless in bed with Paralysis. After
wearing it one week I could raise myself up in bed and sit on the bed. The second week I could
walk about twenty feet with two canes; fourth week I went outside down a flight of; six steps
and walked about a hundred yards and back; : and this mo'ning I went out and walked very
Rear a quarter of a mile. I can now get around and help myself without bothering any one.
It was a blessing to mi the day I got your Belt."â F. A. MONARCH, Gilroy, Cal .
Think of the happiness, the
deep, heart-whole content that *$$&Ff&ss^s&fe-
settles upon your mind when
you say to yourself, ''I am
strong and manly ; I have pre- f^^^^^^^y^^W
served the gift^of manhood that KKL7 ' .Â«i /
nature gave . me." Yes, you Wp^^^^^^-^J^^P
who can say that, and say it
honestly, think of how much "â â  v ,' j^^^^^^r
you owe to nature, the giver of -**W^
manhood. Yet not many can say it. There are too many pit-
falls, too many temptations in the path of young men, and too
many of them fall.
It is to correct the error of youthful folly, and to point out
the happy recovery of manly vigor by his wonderful Electric
Belt, that Dr. Sanden has given to the world his famous book,
"Three Classes of Men." He will send a pocket edition, free,
sealed, to any sufferer, or to any man who does not feel himself a
man. Get it. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt cures weak men.

mands approved on account of contracts let
by the Roard of Supervisors for new work,
has left this special mv.i in an unsatisfactory
condition.
In fact, jn order to meet the actual require
ments of this department for the balance of
tne fiscal year it will be necessary to en
croach upon sums appropriated for other pur
poses.
This is also especially true as to providing
funds for the pay ment of the contracts for repay
ing Folsom street, Van Ness avenue, Mason
street, between Pacihc and Jackson, Taylor
street, between Pacific and Broadway, and
other contracts already awarded by the Board
of Supervisors.
I appreciate fully the necessity for replacing
tne cobble pavement in the business section of
the City with a more desirable pavement, but
in the matter of projecting this much needed
work I am subjected to the discretion of the
Board of Supervisors. lam endeavoring now,
with the limited means at my disposal, to re
construct pavements on the "streets in that
portion of the City near the wuter front where
heavy drayuge is conducted, and for which
there is pressing necessity. 1 am s-atistied that
the efforts of the Merchants' Association to se
cure a special appropriation in the levy to be
made in June next, for the removal of cobbles
and the substitution of bituminous rock for
the pavement of the streets in the business
center of the City would be crowned with suc
cess, and I can assure you that in this behalf I
shall heartily co-operate with the association.
Respectfully yours, Thos. Asijworth,
Superintendent of Public Streets, Highways
and Squares.
To this the secretary of the association
made answer in the following terms:
San Francisco, March 27, 1896.
Hon. Thomax Ashworth, Superintendent of Pub
lic Streets, Highway* and Squaies, City and
County of San 'Fiancixoâ Dear Sir: Your es
teemed favor of yesterday has duly reached
this ottice and has been submitted to the presi
dent of this association. He requests me to
acknowledge the receipt of the same and to
assure you thftt this association fully recog
nizes the difficulties, as presented in your
communication, of making the suggested im
provements during thi\tiscal year. The op
portunity, however, will be taken shortly by
the board of directors of this association to
formulate plans for 6ecuring these improve
ments during the next fiscal year. These plans,
as soon as prepared, will be submitted to your
consideration: and it affords us pleasure
to be assured that the association will have
your hearty co-operation in this important
matter. J. Richard Freud,
Secretary Merchants' Association.
A former City and County official, when
shown the correspondence above copied,
remarked:
"Triere may be sopiething in it, who
knows? But my conviction is that there
will be cobble pavements in San Francisco
fifty years from now, unless the rising
generation takes more interest in public
works than the element which now holds
the reins.''

"CANCER
ON FACE CURED
By Dr. C. A. Uaseall, ISo2 Market St.
Dr. Hascall referred to me in last Sunday's is-
sue, as one he had cured of cancer. I wish to
say to those who are suffering from cancer if
any one can cure you he can. My treatment
with him was for a large cauliflower cancer on
face and neck. It had reduced me in flesh un-
til I was so weak I could hardly get to his office.
My stay at the Sanitarium was three weeks. In
four weeks I had gained fifteen pounds and
was all healed up in six weeks. His treatment
does not burn it out, but seems to kill the can-
cer completely and is not painful. If you have
enncer don't wait but go to see him at once.

Interesting Items From Important Points in Alameda County.
TO PREVENT COLD FEET.
Mayor Davie Given a Unique
Task by the Board of
Works.
SEEKING A HEALTHY FLOOR.
The Prisoner in an Iron Cell Is so
Warm That He Upsets All
Calculations.
Oakland OpnrE Sax Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, March 28. f
The matter of keeping the feet of prison
ers warm and at the same time maintain
ing a healthy floor at the City Prison is
now being investigated by the Mayor, who
was appointed a committee of one for that
purpose by the Board of Public Works.
The Health Board has demanded that
something should be done with the
noisome place and the City Engineer and
the Mayor have commenced a series of ex
periments to determine how to best recon
cile a humane feeling with hygienic rule?.
Engineer Wilson objects to a cement
floor because it would be cold for the pris
oners' feet. Mr. Peirsol rather favors bitu
men, while the Mayor says the hole be
neath the lioor should be filled up and
cement placed on top. Mr. Davie seeks
durability, Mr. Wilson comfort and Mr.
Peirsol wants the cheapest. Councilman
Bassett interjected an opinion at the meet
ins; of the board that if the lioor was cold
the prisoners could put on their socks. He
said the prisoners had no right to expect a
comfortable prison and should not be
there anyway.
Mayor l'avie made an inspection of the
floors of the cells to-day. He questioned
all the prisoners about the comfort of their
feet, and compiled some data, upon which
he is figuring. Some of the prisoners had
not given the matter a thought, and
| strange to say the man who said he had
! very warm teet was in a cell built of iron
and with a metal lioor. As the city's
chief executive officer went from cell to
ceil to inquire about prisoners' feet he
"â¢l< urt'd some strange answers.
"I am not prepared to say at present
what report I shall make to the board,' 1
said the Mayor, '-but although 1 do not
believe in making a prison as comfortable
as a notel I think we should be humane.
It appears like a trivial matter, but 1 do
not so regard it.
'â¢It is not merely a matter of cold feet,
but of the general health of the prisoners.
If it were simply a question of warmth
for prisoners' lower limbs I should feel
that it is a subject of importance. I know
how hard it is for some people to keep
their feet warm under the most favorable
cin-umstances and I have some sympathy
for people troubled with mid feet â even
prisoners.''

A Bond in Dispute.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 27.â When the
Gier-Kreuper slander suit was filed in
court a short time ago Kreuger filed a
bond with F. N. Barney and J. R. Drury
as sureties. They both qualified in the
sum of $WOO. Gier objected to the sureties
and asked for an examination. Barney
DOW cktims that he never qualified in any
amount and that the signature is a forgery.
The signatures were acknowledged before
Notary A. 0. Holman, who said to-day :
'â¢Yes; I drew up the bond in my office
and had Kreuger sign it. I then notified
him to secure two bondsmen who would
swear tliey were worth $1000. It took him
some time to look after the matter, and
one day, when I was at the Sheriff's office,
I was introduced to Mr. Drury and told
these word?: 'Here are the bondsmen.' 1
didn't wait to 'cc the signatures, but there
were none on the paper before that time.
1 went to my office after they had started
to sign, ami left instructions to send 'the
bond to me and I would acknowledge it,
which I did. I don't know either of the
f-ipners, for I never saw them before."
Barney declares he never signed any
bond in the Sheriff's ofiice. He did sigh
one in a coalyard at Eighth and Market
streets, with the understanding that it was
to be stricken off the morning following.
Still Fighting for Freedom.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 28.â Attorney
Nusbaumer has not relaxed his efforts to
secure the release of Andrew Root, charged
with being an accomplice in the gold brick
swindling. As predicted in to-day's Call
he applied for the third writ of" habeas
corpus on behalf of his client to-day, and
was successful in securing it before Judge
Ogden. who made it returnable Monday at
2 P. M.
The petition states that the charge is the
same as that upon which he was released
by Judge Frick. and that there is no new
evidence upon which to base a new charge.
Hence there is no more probable cause
than in the last case.
Root appeared in the Police Court to
day to be arraigned upon the charge of
grand larceny. He was represented by
George \V. Ileed, the partner of Nus
baumer, who asked that the case be con
tinued until Monday to be set. This was
allowed and Koot went below.

to prove that Banks is out of the State,

against the boys this morning at their

rents promised to keep them out of any

the evidence against them he took the
matter under advisement until Monday. *â

A CHURCH ANNIVERSARY.
Rev. Mr. Scudder's Congregation
is Seventeen Years
Old.
The Misses Pattison and McKeon to
Receive Medals for Life-
Saving.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 28.â The seven
teenth anniversary of the founding of the
First Congregational Church was cele
brated without ostentation in the church
parlors last evening. The church was
organized in a little hall over a stable on
Webster street, March 25, 1879, with eleven
members. There were at that time come
fifty other congregations in this State
exceeding it in number. Now, there Ere
but six nortn of Bakersfield. The present
membership numbers 315. The first pastor
was Rev. George Morris, who came direct
from the missionary fields of Tahiti. The
present pastor is Key. \V. W. Scudder, who
has ministered for twelve years. In his
address to his parishioners he called atten
tion to the need of more room to accom
modate the growing social and other work
of the church, and it is not improbable
that additions may be built to the edifice,
or the structure remodeled in the near
futi're.
Alameda Newi Notes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 28.â There is
talk of having a bicycle lantern parade
and entertainment in this city, to fake
place some time in May. Captain V. A.
Dodd of the Alameda Cyclers, is the gen
tlonian who proposes it and no doubt if it
meets with the approval of other clubmen,
will be a success.
Veterinary Inspector Dr. Thomas Car
penter met with a mishap in Oakland yes
terday afternoon. He wa9 thrown out of
his buggy at Thirteenth and Washington
Btreets and somewhat cut and bruised. He
will be around again in a day or so. One
of the wagons of the People's Express
Company was struck at First and Broad
way, Oakland, last night by the 6 o'clock
local from Alameda. The flagman at the
crossing did not notice that the wagon had
been caught between the rails and gave
the signal for the local to come ahead.
The result was a demolished front wbeel
and a horse so badly injured that it haa to
be shot. The driver, J. Berry, was thrown
from his seat, but not injured.
Elijah Clark appreciates genuine hero
ism and especially bo when two young
ladies appear as the rescuers of an almost
drowneu old man. He is endeavoring to
raise enough money by subscription to
purchase two medals and present them to
the Misses Pattison and McKeon, whoso
gallantly rescued from drowning an old
man named Baker a few weeks ago. Baker
at that time was digging clams at the foot
of Versailles avenue and, getting caught
by the tide, was fast getting nearer un
consciousness when the two fair heroines
came and extricated him by means of
some boards and a rope.
Y. M. I. AT HAYWARDS

the Coming Grand
Council.
A EOYAL ENTERTAINMENT.
Generous Contributions of the Citi

Pageant.
HAYWARDS, Cal., March 27. â A
largely attended meeting of the general
committee having in oharge the prepara
tions for the Young Men's Institute State
Grand Council was held to-night. The vari
ous sub-committees made very flattering re
ports, and the delegates will be nand
someiy entertained.
The arrangements for the barbecue are
in an advanced state, and this feature will
be one of the mpst notable during the
holding of the Grand Council. Mr. Creelin
of the Kuby Hill vineyard has promised to
donate all of the wine for the banquet,
and the numerous other things incidental
to a royal feast are also being promised.
Bids for music were received from several
bands in Oakland and San Francisco, and
also from one at Mare island. There was
a difference ot $100 between the union
prices ana the Mare. Island band, and the
committee on music thought this was too
much. A conference was held with the
representatives of the various bands, and
the matter was left undecided. The com
mittee expressed a desire to employ union
men, and offered to meet the difference

representatives will confer with their
unions and report next Monday night.
The secretary was instructed to confer
with every institute in the State and find
out bow many bands and drum corps will
be on hand, so as to make arrangements
ior the grand parade. There will be ample
accommodations for all visitors, as the
committee reported 250 available rooms in
private houses in addition to the hotel ac
commodations. The subscriptions to the
entertainment fund are being paid in an
encouraging manner and the finance com
mittee reported that they had arranged to
make a thorough canvass of the town next
week. The programme arranged for the
session of the council will be as follows:
May 18, open-air concert and general
reception; May 19, high mass in the morn
ing and a session of the Grand Council in
the afternoon, followed by a ball in the
evening, for which 3000 invitations are to
be issued.
Ou the 20th the great parade will occur,
in which all the institutes in the State
will be represented. In the evening tAvo
private dances have been arranged for the
members of the council and their guests.
That evening the boys will hold what tney
call their "nigh jink's," which is a myste
rious demonstration indulged in at every
session of the Grand Council.
On the 21st the morning will be occupied
by a session of the council, and in the aft
ernoon an old-fashioned barbecue will be
held at a farm near the city. That even
ing the banquet of the council will take
place at the Native Sons' Hall.
The 22d will be devoted to the work of
the council, which will be in session all
day. Native Sons' Hall, where the ses
sions are to be held, is a spacious and at
tractive building. It is being put into
shape for the use of the crowds that are
expected. A grand arch will also form
part of the decorations on the street.
The manner in whicn the citizens of
Haywards have responded to the call for
entertaining the Grand Council, Y. AI. 1.,
has encouraged other organizations to try
to secure the holding of their annual State
conventions here. C. W. Heyer and T. W.
Thorndyke, delegates from the Foresters
to the convention at Watsonville, are now
taking steps looking toward securing the
next annual State meeting at Haywards.
BASEBALL AT BERKELEY.
The Reliance Nine Beat the
Varsity Team in a Score
of 8 to 2.
Butcher Ashworth's Widow Will
Receive Substantial Help From
the Union.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 23.â The Re
liance Club baseball team played the
Varsity nine a hard-fought game on the
Berkeley diamond this afternoon, which
resulted in a score of 8 to 2 in favor of the
Reliance men. The Reliance team showed ,
up in good form, considering the fact that
they have practiced together but little.
The" Berkeley players , did not show the
spirit "they did in the game on last
Monday with the University Club nine,
and in consequence lost the day by six
runs. ; The game was practically a
pitchers' battle, with odds equally divided
between Morden and Oliver. The infield
work was weaker than usual. ;
Oliver's speed with . the ball seemed to
frighten the batters as they took their
places at the plate. The errors were ; few.
Following were the players and their posi

J.iquor Refused.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 28.â Marshal
Lloyd yesterday offered to return to the
liquor-dealers who were raided by him
last October the liquor taken from them
at that time and which has since been
kept in the Town Hall as evidence.
The ordinance under which the seizures
were made has since been declared uncon-
stitutional. Yesterday Lloyd made ten
ders of wine, whisky and beer to A. Berg,
Joseph Doran, Mrs! A. Mullgren, Mrs. M.
Silvershield and Mrs. Foster. The parties
all refused to receive the liquor offered
them, excepting Mrs. Silvershield and
Mrs. Mullgren.
It is supposed that the liquor men are
acting under the advice of their attorney,
M. C. Chapman, with a view to possible
damage suits against Hie town.

BERKELEY, Cal., March 28.â The re
port that Joseph B. Ashworth, the butcher

THE DISCOVERY
IS CONFIRMED
Further Experiments as to
the Source of the
X-Rays.
USED THE TESLA COIL.
A Dozen of the Wonderful Pho
tographs Taken With
Great Success.
PROFESSOR CORY IS PLEASED.
Expects to Finally Demonstrate the
Origin of the Ray by the
Shadow It Casts.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 29.âNot
withstanding the fact that Saturday after
noon is ordinarily a holiday for all State
employes, Professor Cory, Mr. Le Conte,
the instructor in mechanics, and Mr. Loh
man, besides their corps of assistants, spent
the entire day in the effort to cast addi
tional light on the test? already made as
to the origin of the wonderful, penetrating
ray. So deeply interested in the work
were some of the experimenters that they
did not take time to eat their noonday
luncheon until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
As to the results of their work no more
definite proof as to the source of the ray
was secured than that of several days
ago, but from ttie fact that the indications
point so strongly toward the theory
held by Lodge, Porter and Hicks, Pro
fessor Cory is constrained to believe
that he has found out the question
which has been such a puzzle to scientists
pince the discovery by Dr. Roentgen of the
magic ray. It has long been known that
the cathode ray produces positive electrifi
cation on the first solid which it strikes.
It seems that the X-rays, therefore, are
produced on the solid, which is thus posi
tively electrified. Since metals are good
conductors they seem to give out the
greater number of X-rays. "All that I can
state positively with regard to the matter,"
paid Professor Cory to-day, "is that the
theory which I have mentioned seems to
hold true. I should like to be able to
speak more definitely, but just at present
I am unable to say any more than that it
setms to be the correct one. 1 '
At least a dozen photographs were taken
to-day by means of the Tesla coil, and the
Crookes tube with single connections.
Some were overexposed, and some under
exposed, but in others distinct shadows of
the objects intended to be reproduced were
cast on the plate.
The device used in the attempt to deter
mine the origin of the ray is simple in the
extreme. A thin piece of white cedar
large enough to cover the greater portion
of an ordinary platebolaer is selected, and
in it are driven rows of small nails so as to
stand perfectly upright. The board witii
the nails is then piaced on the face of the
plateholder, which in turn is fixed in a
stationary position directly opposite the
point where the ray is supposed to have
its origin. The electric fluid Is turned on
and permitted to run until an impression i
of the shadows cast by the nails is made
upon thp photographic plate. Jnst as we
are able to locate the position of the sun
by the shadows cast from objects upon
which its rays are directed so do the exper
imenters believe that they will be able to i
locate the source of the Roentgen ray by '
the shadow it casts.
"ThÂ« source, however," says Professor .
Cory, "depends upon the tubes and the
shape of the electrodes. In other words,
One of the Negatives Taken by the Experimenters at Berkeley Yesterday, Showing
Shadow of Nails Driven in a Strip of Wood Exposed From the Solid, Which He
ceived the Cathode Ray, and by Geometrical Computation the Exact Point From
Whence the Kay Came Was determined.
the X-ray may come from the anode, or ,
the glass, or any solid upon which the
cathode rays impinge the tube. Many
experimenters have found that in the par- '
ticular tube they have used the X-rays
seem to emanate from the anode, while
others have found that they came from
the fluorescent glass. All these various I
niethodH of tracing the X-ray by means of j
photography with differently shaped \
tubes have been tried at the university, \
but the one theory that the rays seem to
be sent out, not from the cathode, but
from the solid that receives the negative
charge from the cathode, seems to be the
most palpable."
Late this afternoon a photograph was
taken of the piece of board in which the j
nails were driven, and upon beingdeveloped i
showed much more clearly than any yet j
taken that the ray must emanate from the j
solid that receives the negative discharge '.
from the cathode. When Instructor Lo
Conte came out of his photographic dark
room holding in bit bund the newly de
vcloped negative a shout of joy went up
from the interested bystanders, and Pro
fessor Cory was heard lo remark, "Well,
now I know that 1 can do most. anything
with the Tesla tube." Upon this he went
back to his laboratory and began again
the work of determining! the relative util
ity of certain tubes which were on
hand, with the view to making further
photographic impressions. An hour was
spent in illuminating the new tubes. In
some of them the yellow and violet
fluorescence was most beautiful. It re
minded one of a brilliant pyrotechnic dis
play on a clear, dark night. The room
was darkened and all that could be s^en
was the brilliantly illuminated bulbs on
the sheet iron apparatus, with an occa
sional spark of electricity from the regu
lator. Professor Cory was more than
pleased with the workings of the new
Tesla coil. He said: "The coil which
Mr. Lohman, the student in mechanics,
has made is the best I ever saw and has
been of material assistance to us in making
our experiments."
The work ot further attempting to locate
the origin of the X-ray will be continued
on Monday.
Camera Club Exhibit.
At the urgent request of the many friends of
the California Camera Club, the print com
mittee have decided to keep the annual print
exhibition open to the public for another week.
Although many have visited the rooms, still
the unsettled state of the weather kept others
away, and to give all an opportunity to attend
the exhibition will be open from March 30 to
April 4, between the hours of 10 a. m. and
5 p. M.
There were a very large number of visitors
present last evening to view the annual print
exhibition. Among them were W. Street. J. <;.
Thomn, Ed. Jensen, Mr. and Mrs. Hocdstudter,
C. Weidner, Harry Banner. Mr. Zeile, Shirly
Kyan , Miss Morris, Miss Banks. Miss A. K.
Ycy and Mr. Hatchings, a pioneer of Yosemite
Valley, who was much delighted with the
photos of his old h ome.
VALLEY ROAD SOUVENIR
An Elegant Book Giving the
History of the Project
Up to Date.
Profusely Illustrated With Half-Tone
Portraits of Prominent
Citizens.
As a souvenir of a California enterprise
that stands to-day as the only one of any
magnitude ever inaugurated and success
fully carried on in the face of the opposi
tion of the hitherto all-powerful Southern
Pacific monopoly there has been issued
from the establishment of the Wheeler
Publishing Company a handsome volume,
profusely and elegantly illustrated, en
titled "The Valley Road."
This volume in its 224 pages of heavy ;
supersized and calendered paper tells in â 
brief the salient features in the history of i
the Tratiic Association, tlie League of
Progress, the North American Navigation !
Company, the Merchants' Shipping Asso- j
ciation and of the San Francisco and San |
Joaquin Valley Railway.
As a frontispiece it has a full-page half
tone portrait of Clans Spreckels, who, j
1 with his munificent subscription of half a
million dollars, together with those of his !
sons, John D. Spreckels and A. B. j
Spreckels, of $100,000 each, made the com- '
peting line an immediate possibility. '
Then scattered through the book on :
. nearly every page is a half-tone illnstra- i
tion of one or more of the most promising j
and enterprising men of this City and ;
Stockton, and more particularly of those j
interested in the great railway project,
the place of honor, the page following the
title-page, being given up to the news
paper proprietors of this City. In the
center of the page is the half-length por
trait of Charles M. Shortridge of the San
Francisco Call, and this is surrounded by
bust likenesses of W. R. Hearst, Ex
aminer; M. H. de Young, Chronicle; R.
A. Crothers, Bulletin; William M. Bun
ker, Report; ancU George K. Fitch, for- j
merly of The Call and Bulletin.
Arthur Wheeier, in his preface, briefly, j
yet clearly, tells the scope and purpose of. :
the work. He says:
"It will be the object of this history to
show how the people of Colifornia have at |
vanuus ximes ana in aiviaea groups en
deavored to extend and free their com
merce from the control of a great monop
oly, and iiow it was not until they were at
last united, led by men whom they could
trust, that they were able to make head
against ttie otherwise invincible corpora
tion.
"This, however, is but the history of all
popular struggles against vested preroga
tive and entrenched capital. There must
be deep feeling among the masses and
there must be the strong, inspiring leader
ship to direct tiie movement.
"Much of this feeling has been worked
up in the case of California's railroad tight
by the aid of the great San Francisco
dailies, whose constant support to any
movement looking to the liberation of the
people has held up the hands of our mer
chants and made* possible the success of
the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway."
Among other features of the volume are
complete lists of all the citizens of Stock
ton and San Francisco who have sub
scribeU to the stock of the railway.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
BUTCHERED BY A
VENGEFUL MALAY
Razor Wounds End the
Life of Miss Edla
Meyer.
HER ASSASSIN'S SUICIDE
Philip Raymer, Jailbird and
Ship's Cook, Wielded the
Fatal Steel.
THE DOCTOR CAME TOO LATE.
Prompt Medical Attendance Might
Have Saved the Life of the
Wounded Girl.
Edla X. A. Meyer, a pretty little Ger
man girl residing with her parents over
her father's saloon at the corner of Sacra
mento and Drumrn streets, was murder-
iDI.A MEYER, THE IIAPLESS VICTIM OF THE MURDEROUS MALAY.
[Reproduced from a photograph.]
cusly attacked in her mother's bedroom
yesterday morning by Philip Raymer, a
Malay sailor and ship's cook, armed with
a razor. Hhe was horribly cut, but made
a brave fight for life and finally escaped
from the room and ran down into the sa
loon, whereupon the Malay turned the
weapon upon- himself and with one slash
across the throat ended his worthless ca
reer. Three-quarters of an hour later hia
victim expired in the saloon below from
loss of blood. Her life might have been
saved, but no physician could be secured
in time. The motive for the crime was
revenge.
The Meyers occupy the entire building
at the corner mentioned. The second
floor, reached only by a stairway from
Drumm street, was used exclusively for
sleeping apartments, while downstairs in
the saloon and a small kitchen adjoining
was passed the family's daily life, the
two daughters assisting when neces
sary m serving the sailors at the bar.
The family's respectability is, however,
unquestioned, and neither the neighbor
hood eossin nor the post-mortem exami
nation has aught to say against the dead
girl's good name.
Raymer, with other seafaring men, met
the girls in the saloon. Despite his color,
which won for him the title, "the nigger,"
he took a fancy to the bine-eyed maids,
and spent considerable time about the
place. His language, however, was such
that his presence was considered undesir
able and he was forbidden tbe house.
Later clothing was missed from the rooms.
One day the Malay was found concealed
under a bed upstairs. The missing gar
ments were found in his room in an ad
joining boarding-hou?e, and on a charge of
petit larceny he was sentenced to three
months in the County Jail. The dead girl
was the principal witness against him, and
when he was released on the 13th ult. he
swore revenge.
While at the jail Raymer was considered
somewhat crazy, and since his release
he has haunted the corner on which the
Meyers live. The family had heard of his
threats, yet, though fearing him, they con
tented themselves with watching him and
made no complaint to the police. The
crime is the result.
When discharged from the jail Raymer
took up his residence at Peter McMahon's
sailor boarding-house on Drumm and
Commercial streets, where he had already
run up a large account. The proprietor,
anxious to get his money, shipped Ray
mer as a cook on the whaling schooner
Rosario, and he was to sail this morning.
He did visit the vessel and put the galJey
IB order, but left without a word, and when
next seen his body was lying in its own
blood in Mrs. Meyers' bedroom.
"This morning after breakfast," said
Clara Meyer, sister of the dead girl, "Edla
went upstairs about 7:30 o'clock to make
the beds. About twenty minutes later she
came running into the saloon, where
father and I were, and fell bleeding to the
floor. She could not speak, but I knew
who had killed her. I asked her, 'Who
cut you? The nigger? 1 She nodded 'Yes'
several times. She lived three-quarters of
an hour, but we could not get a dootor till
just at the last. Then it was too late."
A survey of the scene of the crime tells
the story. Miss Meyer had been kneeling
before a trunk witli her back to the door
when Raymer burst it open. She was in a
narrow ppace between the trunk and bed,
but made a hard fight and was severely cut
about the hands. Once she grasped the
blade and as he jerked it away it cut her
fingers lo the bone. Finally in despair
she threw herself down beside the oid
fashioned four-post bedstead and crawled
beneath. Even there the Malay followed
and the gushing spurts of life blood there
tell of the struggle. At least, however,
she jerked herself loose, crawled out on
the other side of the bed and fled down
stairs. A gaping| wound, twelve inches
long, extending from two inches below the
right ear down and across the chest to the
center of her breast, let ont her life.
During the struggle the girl screamed
repeatedly. Mrs. Rodgers, who lives in
an adjoining house, heard, but could not
locate the cries. Alf Lewis, an employe,
asleep in an adjoining room, was awak
ened, but before he could dress the tragedy
was complete.
The sadness of the affair is increased by
the fact that the dead girl was engaged to
be married, and when attacked was lov
ingly fondling her bridal finery. Her
fiance is Captain Fritz Flath of the bark
Ceylon, which plies between this port and
Honolulu in the sugar trade. This is Cap
tain Flath's first trio as captain, he hav
ing been recently promoted from chief
mate. His vessel is due here in June and
the wedding was to have been celebrated
in July. A brother of the dead girl is
Eugene Meyer of the United States Life-
Saving Service. J. Herman of the Her
man Safe Manufacturing Company is a
brother-in-law.
Deputies from the Coroner's office re
moved the bodies to the Morgue, whence
Miss Meyer's remains were afterward
txansferred to Metzler's undertaking estab
lishment. A search of the murderer's
body brought to light a bottle of vitriol
anu a life-insurance policy. The latter
was made out in the name of Thomas
Holmes and was made payable to his sis"
ter, Ella Holmes. It was issued by a
Wakefiold (Mass.) insurance concern. This
causes some doubt as to the murderer's
real name, and the Coroner will write East
lor any information obtainable.
VISITING CITY OFFICIALS
Minneapolis Municipal Authori
ties Arrived Here Yes
terday.
The Mayor and His Chief Aids on a
Mingled Business and Pleasure
Trip.
The largest party of officials from any
one Eastern city that ever visited San
Francisco arrived yesterday in a private
car. and is now engaged in touring t ho
City. The party is frcm Minneapolis, and
comprises Mayor Robert Pratt, City Clerk
Charles F. Haney, Aldermen P. A. Long,
Burke O'Brien, Q. A. Durman, H. Jen
nings, :S. B. Loge, S. E. Adams. Erik
Rhode, F. A. Schwartz, P. W. McAllister,
Jay W. Phillips, F. S. Drew, Charles E.
Dickenson and G. L. Fort; Chief Engineer
F. W. Cappelen, Chief Engineer of the
Fire Department F. L. Stetson, Health
Commissioner H. N. Avery, Assistant At
torney Avery, Registrar of Water Works
F. T. Moody, Sealer of Weights A. G.
Mosher, Sergeant-at-arms T. P. Gaylord.
Accompanying the party are L. J. Hill
house, Tribune reporter; Adolph Edsten,
Journal reporter; H. A. Luxton, Penny
Press reporter; Dr. A. H. Heddely and
Caterer John Dormer.
The party is out for pleasure as well as
to gather any ideas that may be used to
advantage in the municipal Government
of Minneapolis, and will spend at least a
week in San Francisco before departing
for Los Angeles and Southern California.
The entire delegation made a call on
Mayor Sutro yesterday, but that official
was not in his office and the tourists were
entertained by Colonel Rogers. A visit
was then made to the rooms of the Board
of Supervisors, where Clerk John Russell
did the honors. Last night the party took
a trip through Chinatown and were enter
tained by a number of prominent mer
chants.
While in this City the Eastern officials
will reside in their car, which lies at the
depot at Third and Townsend streets, and
will make a number of short trips to points
of interest about the bay.
Novel Advertising;.
At the corner of .Sixth and Market
streets for two years past the Owl Adver*
tising Company has furnished nightly to
the people of this City a unique and novel
entertainment in the shape of a stereopti
con display. Instead of using the old
style of magic-lantern a more modern de
vice wherein a several candle-power elec
tric light is used to throw the oDjects on
the screen. Handsome scenic views and
comic pictures are shown, interspersed
with advertising, each nieht. As the as
sortmint of views is a large and well
selected one, the display attracts a large
audience nightly, and advertisirs find this
an unusually good and novel mode of ad
vertising thgir wares to the people of San
Francisco. *

stock of any country in Europe.
SAYS THEY ARE DAUBERS.
Oscar Lewis Admits His Em
ployes Are Not Good
Painters.
BILLS MAY NOT BE ALLOWED.
Auditor Broderick May Withhold Pay
ment if the Labor Leaders Claim
the Work Is Illegal.
The representatives of the labor unions
who were reported in yesterday's Call as
having discovered what appeared to them
very suspicious circumstances in connec
tion with the painting of the dome of the
City Hall were by no means satisfied with
the result of their continued investiga
tions yesterday. Several days ago a com
mittee from the Building and Trades
Council, consisting of Mclvor, Rose and
Zant, undertook to investigate the work
bring done on the City's municipal monu
ment. As a preliminary step, they en
deavored to ascertain just what the con
tract and specitications called for, ana in
this they were signally successful.
In 1892 the Board of City Hall Commis
sioners were greatly annoyed by a strike.
as a result of non-union men having been
put to work. In order to avoid a repeti
tion of the embarrassment, and also with
the avowed purpose of placating laboring
men, the following order was passed:
Eight hours constitute a full day's work for
all workmen employed upon any 6f the work
referred 10 in this specification.
No Chinese or Mongolian shall be employed
upon any of the work reierred to in this speci
fication, either directly or indirectly, nor shall
any material be oaed upon which Chinese or
Mongolian labor is known to have been em
ployed. No scab labor is to be employed on
any portion of the work herein to be executed.
For some time the labor unions watered
assiduously to see that the provisions of
the order were stipulated in every con
tract, but of late their vigilance has been
relaxed somewhat, and as a result it was
not until non-union men were put at work
on the dome that they bethought them
selves of the contract. They claim they
were given evasive answers as to whether
or not the clauses were contained in it, but
the non-union men continued to do the
work. Moreover, it is claimed many of
the men worked overtime.
The culmination of the union men's in
dignation was reached when they ascer
tained facts regarding the painting of the
ironwork of the dome. In this R. T. Mc-
Ivor is authority for the statement that
the poorest quality of paint was used, and
the men applying it were wholly un
skilled in the painters' craft. He asserted
that they were being paid only $1 a day.
Not only were they smearing on the paint
in a most unworkmanlike manner, but it
wa^ asserted they were neither scraping or
cleaning the iron preparatory to applying
tlie brush.
City and County Auditor William Brod
erick, ex-ottieio member of the Board of
City Hull Commissioners, was inclined to
lay the entire resj onsibilsty for the work
upon the architect and superintendent.
"I do not see,' 1 be said, "how the board
can do anything at present. The law con
templates that in such construction we
rely entirely upon the expert knowledge
of uiir architect and superintendent. It is
their place to see that the work is done ac
cording to specifications. If, after the
completion of the work, any one can show
us that the specifications have been
violated or that the men â  have
worked more than eight hours a
day or thnt the law has in any way been
violated we will refuse to allow their bills.
I do not see how we can do anything in re
gard to the wages the men are being paid,
as the law says the work must be given
out by contract. Personally lam in lavor
of high wages, as 1 am myself a mechanic,
but it seems to me the only thing to do is
to demand of men who are known to be hir
ing incompetent workmen tae highest
class results."
Oscar Lewis of the linn of o'Connell <fc
Lewis, who have the contract for the iron
work, does not deny that the men doing
the painting are mere laborers. "That
kind of work," he said, "is usually done
in the factory, and we generally put a boy
at it if we have one. It is not ornamental
painting; that will come later. Whenever
there is any dirt or scales on the iron it is
scraped off, and that is all that is neces
sary. Ido not know how much the men
are getting as we 'jobbed' it out to a
young fellow who frequently works for us.
We pay him enough to allow him to pay
the men $2 or $2 50 a day and retain a
good margin. The paint is exactly accord
inc to contract.''
Ernest D. lfelliss, the City Hall Com
missioners' superintendent, says the work
lias all been done to his satisfaction. He
also says the work does not require
painters, the object of the paint being
merely to prevent rust. The paint used
he admits is very cheap, but lie claims
it is the best that can be used for the pur
pose.
The buiidingand trades' committee will
continue their investigations.
Interested in Young Men.
Chauneey M. Pepew and Cornolius Vander
bilt, who are expected to arrive in San Fran
cisco early this week, are deeply interested in
work for young men, as prosecuted by the
Young Men's Christian Association. Cor
nelius Vanderbilt is chairman of the finance
committee of the New Voik City Young Men's
Christian Association. Mr. Depew lias been
invited to lecture before the association of this
City during his stay, and will probably accept,
as his treat interest in the moral welfare of
young men throughout this country is well
known.
The board of directors of the local association
will hold tneir regular meeting to-morrow
( Monday) evening, and renewed efforts will be
put forth to raise the balance of $12,000
which is needed to make up the $100,000
necessary to save the splendid property in this
City. A determined effort will be made within
the next week or ten days among the citizens
with the hope of bringing the amount up to
the .f 100,000 mark. The pledges now s'.and
at $Â»8,000.
Commerce of the Great r.3Â»kea.
The commerce of the Great Lakes is rap
idly exceeding the American commerce on
the ocean. The number of vessels now
contracted for or building for 1896 is sixty
live, with a valuation of $8,549,000. Of
these forty-two are freight boats, with a
capacity of 136,600 gross tons. The coast
ship-building for the year will be only 105
vessels, with a total valuation of $6,040,400,
and most of these are passenger or pleasure
boats. In the river yards twenty-four ves
sels are being conitructed to cost $537,650.
The largest vessel planned in the coast
yards is 480 feet long, while the smallest of
the lake freighters is 326 feet in length.
These figures, of course, do not include the
work in the many yards. It is evident that
the Great Lakes are to furnish the traffic
route of the future from the interior, and,
with a ship canal to the Atlantic Coast,
which must eventually be constructed, the
next generation will see their waters cov
ered by a fleet whose numbers are beyond
the reach of imagination at present.â St.

Not aÂ« Good aa Whist.
An amusing story is told of a Chicago
whist-player, who thinks he is a great
player, and isn't. He recently wrote and
published a book on the .came, and sent
one copy to a famous Milwaukee player
for his opinion on it. In about a week the
book was returned to him with the follow
ing letter: "My dear sir: Your favor of
the â inst., accompanied by your book,
was duly received. I have read it care
fully. It seems to be a very good game,
but I don't think it is as good a game as
whist."

FROM
HILL AND PAY
BEAUTIFUL for situation is San
Francisco on her hundred hills.
How heautiful, we who come and
go, daily, within her gates, are too
apt to foreet. At least I think it
must be forgetfulness that makes so many
of us speak slightingly of this wonderfully
picturesque city, comparing it with the
more conventional loveliness of others,
famous for their beauty. It is a misfor- j
tune when we allow the things of every
day life to become commonplace. It is
just this tendency of the human mind that
is at the root of so much carelessness and
bad citizenship. We ought to take seri
ously the dignity and beauty of our City,
and bring our standards of life and build
ing up to it.
There are many approaches to Pan
Francisco, but none without its peculiar
charm, unless one excepts the nrosaic i
entrance of the Menlo Park railroad by \
way of the south. 15ut it is the lay of the |
road rather than the surrounding country
that is at fault. It creeps through cuts
and devious ways and one gets but a
meager glimpse, here and there, of the
Tity. Outdoes better from the cars of the
6an Mateo electric road, where, from many
a commanding height, the City i? seen
spread out in what might be calied its
working garments. Tt is the horny hand
of toil that is here extended to greet you.
The City along this side is a thing of
higti towers and chimneys, lines of
tall masts and raking smokestacks along
the water front, Â«tockyards and factories,
docks and warehouses, grim and sug
gestive oi' toil, yet suggestive, too, of the
strange, picturesque, half-foreign flavor j
that is a part of all San Francisco. It is
grimy and smoky. Most of the buildings
are old and weatherbeaten; many are!
mossgrown and falling into premature de
cay. The}' were never intended as busi- i
ness buildings, and even in their old age
they seem unable to recover their aston
ishment at the surroundings in which
they find themselves.
There is a deep and pathetic interest,
too, in the once fine old homes along this
route, in tne vicinity of Harri-on, Bryant \
and Second streets, survivals of the days, \
not yet a Â«.oove of years ago, when Rincon
Hill was the most desirable site in the ''
City, and South Park the Pacific hoiqhts
of to-day in aristocratic exelusiveness.
There t? no more significant comment i
than tt-t .3 old homes ur on the wonderful !
growth of our City. They have far more ;
of an air of permanency than have nine- j
tenths of our more fashionable, modern ;
houses, yet they have for the most part
fallen into the neglect and decay of tran- j
sient and frequently changing tenancy.
Coming in from the park or the Cliff
House one gets a wholly different yet
equally picturesque view of the City.
Here again what at tirst seems a stretch of
dull gray houses hemming in dull gray
streets resolves itself, as the panorama
unfolds, into an interesting study in color.
There has been, on the whole, wistlom In
the apparent stupidity that has painted
our houses what a sarcastic observer
recently termed, "A uniform mud tint."
Whether by accident or design our painters
have produced a thoroughly democratic
effect of "the greatest good to the greatest
number." It is a general effect of restful
neutrality, pleasingly broken here and
there, and more frequently than the casual
observer would suspect, by bits of bright
ness. Were there greater diversity of
color a wooden city, such as ours, spread
out to view from hundreds of eminences, as
San Francisco must always be, would
present the appearance of an unspeakable
crazy-quilt with every patch the result of
separate and individual selection.
Perhaps of all the park routes the
Haight-street line presents the most won
derful view of the City as the descent is
made into its business center. From this
line, on the downward trip, one looks
across to the dark, smoky south, with its
teeming life, eastward, down Market
street, the great artery of the City, with
its hurrying multitude running to and fro
on the countless small errands that make
np human existence, and then northward,
where row upon row rise, beautiful homes
crowning the hills and resting in the val
leys between. Across the bay gleam the
three sister cities, Oakland, Berkeley and
Alameda, and far on the left the Marin
shore shows purple in the mists that pre
vail at this season.
Or. if one desires an impression of San
Francisco's great extent, such an impres
sion as cannot really be obtained from a
height, with eyes sweeping the whole City
at a glance, the drive in along the San
Bruno road will afford this, and is very
likely to cure an imaginative mind of any
iingering predilection for a level town.
Bui choose your day for this drive. It is
a ihing to be shunned and feared when
the trades are blowing.
But if, viewed from the land ways, San
Francisco is beautiful, seen from the water
Bhe has become famous. Where are our
poet.* ihat they have not long since sung,
our artists that they have not painted,
over and over again, the fair citj- on her
matchless buy? Whether one sails through
'he Golden Gate and up the channel, past
her sloping beaches and bold bluffs, or
ef her come nearer and nearer,
?" ; -ing Higher and higher, as the San
. and hausalito ferries round the
to their slips, or whether the more
direct trip is made from the Oakland
s, the picture is beautiful and com
plete; the majestic city is ever the same,
smiling upon allcomers from her count*
â is, waiting only the loving human
eftori to make her the wonderful thing she
shall yet be.
I low to insist upon this view of San
1- rancid!,. It cannot be urged too strenu
ously. Tjipj-e jf< no other city in America
so royally enthroned. There is no city
Â»ore or greater blunders have been
made in government and building. Per
' haps there is no other city so little appre
> ciated by its own people. But we are in;
--; proving in that regard, and awakening to
a sense of our City's possibilities It is not
a "boom" that San Francisco needs, nor
yet the "few nrst-ciass funerals" that im
patient spirits are wont to urge as a desid
eratum to progress, but an awakening, on
all sides, to a sense that nature has dealt
generously by us, and that we shall do well
I to plan and execute our City along the
; lines she has indicated.
These are very wonderful days in which
to study San Francisco from the water.
The "white day*" so prevalent just now
invest her with a new and weird beauty.
The fogs at this season are very different
from those we shall have a little later.
They are torn and drifted, showing the
City in snatches as the approach is made
by the ferries. Perhaps a long, snowy
ledge of vapor will stretch clear across the
water front, with the parallel lines of
streets climbing heavenward from out
: it. Or the mist will lift and drift above
the slips, cutting* off all but the higher
points of the City, the water front,
: the shippinz and wharves showing
darkly clear and distinct Deneath it.
Again, it floats in great banks, drifting
against the tallest buildings and hovering
in ragged, tossing clouds over the highest
heights. Beneath it the City lies, blue and
beautiful, and the smoke from her chim
neys sets the mist a-quiver with color â
rose and purple, orange and red, and
wonderful greens where it rests over the
wharves. There is something fascinating,
1 too, in the approach through a dense sum
, mer fog, when only the constant clangor
\ of the bell at the slip guides the steersman
i into port. From out the white mystery
â  come all the sounds of the City's busy life,
the clans; of cable-cars, the rolling of
i heavy wheels, the vibrating sounds of ma
: chinery, and even the calls of vendors
1 about the ferries, but of City there is no
\ glimpse until, at the very last, as the
j steamer creeps on through the mist, dim
and ghostlike, an outline looms up, dark
and low, that we know is the ferry build
ing.
I have seen the City a shimmerof vibrat
ing opaiescence in the delicate haze of an
autumn afternoon; clean and clear-cut as
a cameo after the early rains. It takes on
rare blues and purples, then, seen from
across the bay. and a little later, when the
surrounding hills are ciothed in green, the
effect is still more beautiful.
The approach at night is very lovely;
to watch the City light? climbing upward
to meet the stars, but more wonderful still,
on a clear starlight nigHt, is it to watch it
A FRENCH DINNER ON THE BEACH
BY W. O. MORROW.
There are just two men in San Francisco i
(if there are more they have a superb art I
\ for concealing their genius) who under
stand the art of cooking a delicious dinner
on the beach without any of the appli- I
! ances of the kitchen, and who in the em- I
; ploymer.t of their skill give a few of their I
! nearest friends an occasional outing which
! furnishes deligtits unknown to the great j
I sordid masses who cannot appreciate the
' charms of San Francisco. As might be
supposed, botli of these men are of foreign
birth and training, albeit one of them had
an American mother. Of course both were I
poor in their youthful days. One of them
is of Italian birth, the other French ; one
is a physician and popular man of society,
tne other a publisher enjoying prosperity
and confidence. Either one of them might
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
SAN FRANCISCO FROM BAIGHT-STREET HILL.
[The photograph from which the sketch uas made uas taken by Tabcr.)
from the hills across the Bay. The star- !
lighted heavens are not more beautiful
than that up-going, outstretching sweep
of vibratile light. The lights of the
City do not dance and flicker,
seen thus, but they seem to breathe and
pulsate with life and motion. The electric
lights, in particular, have this effect.
From height to height they seem to signal
and answer one another. The ships' lights
on ihe hay maintain a sort of connection
between the cities on either side the water,
and the stars above, rounding out the
mystical, sparkling sphere, complete a
spectacle worth making a pilgrimage to
behold. I know of no other locality or.
the continent that affords such a sight. I
know of no other sight so full of hopeful
inspiration. It reconciles one to all the
blunders cf thfi City's past and rills one
with hope for its future, when its citizens
shall know and love it as it should be
loved and known. Adeline Knatp.
make a fortune by writing a book on the
art oi cooking.
As the physician always has ladies in
his pleasant little picnic parties, and as
the Frenchman confines himself to male
quests, it has fallen out that! although
both these men are my good friends, it
has been only with the Frenchman that I
have enjoyed some wonderful days on the
sandy beach and in the brushy dunes of
this humpbacked peninsula. It is for the
purpose of describing one of the events
and showing the less fortunate residents
of this magical City how they might en
joy a similar pleasure that this is written.
We may be sure that no two of our trips
are alike, that the camp is never pitched
in the same place twice, that no two din
ners are similar, and that the inevitable
long drive that forms a part of it all is
sure to be taken into strange and odd
places unknown to the greater crowd that
grinds and groans in the City. One day it
may be a tour through the Potrero to
Hunters Point, where the big stone dry
dock is, and the dinner on a strip of sand
under the bluff not far away, with a subse
quent drive over the San Bruno road, the
most lonely and picturesque in town, re
turning by way of Baden and the San
Jose road. On another day it may be a
straight drive to Crystal Springs by way
of Milbrae, a dinner on the shore and a
return by way of San Mateo. Still another
day may find us threading the Presidio
and losing ourselves in a deep canyon be
tween the Marine Hospital and the park.
Again, it may be a drive out Point Lobos
avenue and down the ocean beach six or
seven miles past the Cliff House, with a
return by way of Ingleside and the Cor
bett road (a particularly favorite route for
us by reason of the fact that in a small
canyon at the base of Twin Peaks is the
hospitable home of a Frenchman with an
English wife, and if that is not a combina
tion of hospitable elements we must go
far afield to seek it).
For these trips my friend has a sturdy
two-wheeled cart that can go anywhere,
and it has an ample box body, closed with
a lid, for carrying the provisions. The
horse is one of those wise and uncanny
creatures that knows how to make an easy
grade for himself by zigzagging up a hill.
PORTION OF THE CITY SEEN FROM THE BAY.
[From a photograph by Tuber.]
These precautions are all a part of the able
skill of my friend.
On the last trip he took two of us in the
cart. As composed the party represented
France, England and America. The day
was gray. The spot selected was one
familiar to the Frenchman, and was chosen
with exquisite judgment. It was on the
ocean beach, far from the possibility of
intrusion. At the foot of a towering bluff
a ridge of sand, overgrown with the lush
mesembryanthernum of the peninsula,
separated a littlb trough from the beach
and shielded it from the wind. In that
nook, perfectly concealed from any chance
stragglers on the beach, a few yards away,
my friend unhitched his horse and started
England and America on a wood-gathering
expedition.
That was an ea?y task. The beach was
strewn with dry flotsam. I have stopped
with this Frenchman in places where it
seemed impossible to find even a twig for
making a tire, but he never worried about
that.
"Fuel always comes to a cook," he would
say; and it always did, although it re
quired two or three hard lessons line that
for me to acquire the art of getting fuel.
The Frenchman produced two steel rods
the size of a pencil. They were about
thirty inches long and sharpened at the
points. The ends of them were bent at
right angles, forming legs about eight
inches long. He stuck the rods in the
ground about an inch and a half apart,
GENERAL VIEW OF SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE TWIN PEAKS.
[From a photograph bylTaber.]
built a fire under them and waited for the
coals to appear.
Then he produced three dozen small
oysters from the mysterious cart-box,
opened them deftly with an ordinary table
knife, spread them on the half shell on a
newspaper and they constituted the first
course of the meal. A touch of lime was
their only seasoning.
By this time the coals were ready. The
box yielded up a dozen softsbell crabs
still alive. A quick pinch removed the j
tail and the crustaceans were laid on their j
backs on the parallel steel rods over the
coals. In a short time they were turned
on their bellies, then soon again on their
backs. The signal for this last turn was
their beginning to drip. This meant that
their fat was melting and must be saved
by turning them upon tueir backs. The
notice of their being done came when the
backs began to crack and the melted fat to
escape. Then they were removed. The
under shell was quickly stripped, and the
crab buttered and eaten out of hand, and
held very carefully so as not to permit the
best part of all to spill. This came last.
The cup of the upper shell after the meat
was gone was half full of a savory liquor.
A pinch of butter, which soon melted, and
a few drops of lime transformed it into a
delicious BwaJlow of something better than
a cocktail. No softsbell crab prepared
in the linest restaurant ever could be as
sweet and luscious as that. Three were
cooked at a time un til the twelve were gone.
Simple as all this iooks in the reading,
there is not one person in a thousand who
knows how to cook a softshell crab like
that or who has the smallest idea how de
licious it is. It was the perfect art of our
friend that produced the result.
The next course might have been tender
chickens to broil, but as on this occasion
it was a skirt steak, and as that article and
i the manner of preparing it are unknown
' to any but epicures who can cook, I shall
I select the mysteries of the skirt steak for
exposition. This steak is not a steak at
ail, but the diaphragm of the beef â the
long, strong muscle, as thick and as broad
as one's hand, that produces the inflation
and deflation of the lungs. The Frencn
artist-cook selects his steak usually eight
days in advance of the picnic. During the
I first four days it is kept hanging in a cool
\ place and the succeeding four in an ice
chest. That makes it tender and sweet.
This is the only steak that can be per
fectly broiled over coals. The reason for
this is that as the muscle runs lengthwise,
i instead of transversely, as in an ordinary
I steak, and is of just the proper thickness
! and is covered by a strong thin membrane,
â  its texture and vessels remain uncut, and
i it cannot "bleed" in the process of broii-
I ing. lience there is nothing to make a
j smudge by dripping, no creosote is formed
and not a drop of the juices and fats is lost.
A bed of coals had been made for the
advent of the steak. The long narrow
strip of muscle was laid lengthwise upon
j the rods. As these were so close together
as to permit the edges of the steak to hang
\ over the lire it looked awkward, but the
Frenchman, who is wise and knows his
business, gave this explanation:
"You see, a steak should never be turned
more than once over the coals. The hang
ing down of the sides and the setting of
the steak in that position produce a cup
when it is turned, and it holds all the
juices that may come up." And sure
enough it did, for although nothing
dripped from the lower side the "heat did
drive sorue juices to the top, and there
they were he!d. Into them the salt was
sprinkled just before the steak was ready
to be removed.
Then came another ingenious prepara
tion. A French loafâ none other will an
swer â was cut transversely in two and the
parts split lengthwise and spread with
soft butter. You never catch a sane
Frenchman using iced butter. Upon one
of these strips of buttered bread was laid a
strip of steak cut of a lengtn to fit it. With
a sharp penknife the steak was then
slashed through in a number of places.
Instantly the hot imprisoned juicea
poured out and mingling with the butter
soaked into the loaf. Before this had pro
gressed too far the upper slice of bread
was laid on the meat and the whole turned
over, so that both should be soaked and
none of the juices lost. In devouring this
delicious morsel either the method of the
cave-dweller or the penknife is suitable. I
submit that this entire process is a rare
combination of philosophy and art.
Of course there has been an abundance
of light red wine, an honest, California
article. This yielded to burgundy in the
succeeding course, and that in turn to
what my. friend called champagne; but
this is anticipating.
Tt> have hot black coffee without
even the coffee-pot is ununusual, but
my friend accomplishes it. He makes
coffee at home and brings it in a
bottle. This he sets to the leeward of the
hre and about a foot from it. In half an
hour it is hot. If he has a stone ale bottle
he quietly remarks that it will inform us
when tne coffee is ready. This it does by
ejecting the stopper with a pop. If he
uses a glass bottle he puts in more sugar
than in the case of a stone bottle, as the
sugar prevents the cracking of the glass.
At least that is what he says, and ha
knows. But the curious thing about it is
that the stopper does not pop out of the
glass bottle, and so the scheme is hardly
so complete and fascinating. The coffee
is drunk out of the glass tumblers used
for wine, and it is flavored with a little
raw rum.
The course following the steak is a littla
French sausage, of the bologna type,
sliced thin, or a small pudgy garlic sausage,
which is best of all. In spite of Italy's
superior refutation for sausages the French
kinds seem to me to be far daintier. Fol
lowing the sausage comes fruit, and then
the "champagne." This consists of good
California white wine mixed with soda
water.
Thus we have had a French dinner at a
trifling cost and cooked by a artist without
any kitchen utensils. In the meantime
we have been enjoying the great green
waves combing the beach, have clambered
over the hills strewn with wild flowers,
have luxuriated in the lawless fun and
frolic of the outing, have sung songs and
toid stories, and then go home with,
browned faces and contented hearts. It i 3
the easiest thing in the world to enjoy an
outing in San Francisco.
LINCOLN WAITED.
The President at MoClellan's Head
quarters.
General Sickles rareJy sits down to a
table with old soldiers without contribu
ting some valuable historical reminiscence.
At a banquet the other evening he told
this story: "It was, I should think, very
early in the winter of 186L-6:J that having
some business with General McClellan, I
walked up one forenoon to his headquar
ters â in Admiral Semmes' house, opposite
the Arlington. The man on duty said the
general was engaged, and asked me to
wait. I took a seat, and shortly the
Secretary of War came in and inquired
for the general. An officer came out of
the next room, said the general was busy
just then, and asked the Secretary of
War to take a seat and wait. Mr. Cam
eron sat down and we fell into conversa
tion. In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln cama
in and inquired for General McClellan. The
officer repeated what he had said to us,
that the general was very busy, and Mr.
Lincoln would have to wait. The Presi
dent sat down with us and said, 'All right,
I'll wait.' The Secretary of War re
marked that the President ought in some
way to have access to one of his generals.
Lincoln threw one leg over the other, as
if prepared for a long siege, and said:
'Oh, no. It's all right. My time is of no
special value and the general is engaged,
in attending to our business. I can wait
as well as not.' And he fell into his
famous story-telling, showing not the
slightest impatience at the necessity of
cooling his heels in the anteroom of a
man who was a civilian less than a year
oefore, and whom he himself had ap
pointed to office. The incident illus
trated," added General Sickles, "two
things â first, that Mr. Lincoln wtl one of
the most unpretentious of men, and
second, that at that time everybody, in
cluding: McClellan himself, expected McÂ«
Clellan to put down the rebellion."â

A Frenchman named Villon has in*
vented a novel method of sealing cham

of champagne due to the escape of gas

accomplishes this by covering the cork
and part of the neck with a thin layer ol
copper electrically deposited.

flourishes a fraction of the City's popula

which does not figure on the voting regis

role of absorbing interest in the complex
drama of everyday life, and which con- |
stitutes a rather striking factor in the sum
total of the metropolitan makeup. The
members of this fraction of the population
carry on commerce without capital; they
are wreckers without license; tradesmen
unknown to trade; philosophers without
learning; speculators who invest nothing |
and make something out of it; strangers \
to the schoolroom and apt pupils in the i

shrewd, sroaxt, bold, saucy, quick with

toward the needy as well as mean turns j
against the objects of their hatred. They
are called the "White Rats of the "Water

They know nothing of Altruria, but j

GATHERING FIREWOOD.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]'
Yf N the thirty-nine years of his experi-
I enoe on the turf Orrin A. Hickok, the
I famous trainer and driver of trotting
J^ and pacing hor-ses, has handled the
ribbons in a sufficient number of mile
heats in public races to cover a distance
which, on a straightaway course, would be
a little greater than the distance between
San Francisco and Xew York. If the
average gait were 2:20, which means a rate
of 37 5-7 feet per second, the actual time
consumed in traveling 3038 miles, or a
distance equal to that between this City
and the metropolis of the Atlantic side,
would be 4 days 22 hours 8 minutes and 40
seconds.
Orrin Hickok is 56 years old. and since
he turned his seventeenth year he has
been continuously occupied in training
and driving rrotters and pacers. His
father was a great horseman and main
tained a horse farm in Ohio. In his
youthful days Orrin had a fancy for riding,
but, growing rather too heavy for that
styie of racing, he made driving his
specialty, and to-day his trim figure is
familiar in all the grand circuit tracks of
America. From his father's farm in his
native Buckeye State, therefore, Orrin
drifted into the racing Held, beginning his
pubiic career at Chicago in 1856.
''The first celebrated trotter brought out
by me," said Mr. Hickok the other even
ing, "was the mare Lucy. In 1871-72 the
two fastest trotting horsea in the world
were Goldsmith Majd and Lucy. In 1872
the latter won the $10,000 trotting purse at
liufialo, N. V., in 2:1 X%. Ii was wonder

cuss the Brown scandal,, and laugh at the
shortcomings of humanity in general.
Take some of these "white rats i: out of
their miserable haunts, give them a bath,
dress them in neat ciothes and their bright
ness and good looks might attract atten
tion. Christian charity need not sail to
Asia for subject* â there are very appropri
ate subjects for treatment here. They are
little books, containing tales of poverty,
and they are bound in rags.
Stroll down to "Whitelaw's wharf some
morning when the sun is smiling, and you
may witness an exceedingly common ex
ample of wharf-rat industry. There is a
loose board at the beach end of the planks,
one foot wide and two feet long. This is
raised up and a couple of urchins â 8 or 10
years old, perhaps â lower themselves to
the rock foundation underneath the wharf.
There the teredo has been pursuing his
work of destruction ; and there laborers
are engaged in replacing the ruined spiles.
A teredo-eaten spile is rolled aside ; but
it does not block any passageway for long,
for the urchins twain are on hand to grap
ple with it. They do wonderful thingsâ
these little fellows; they carrry burdens
as big as themselves. A head is poked up
through the hole in the wharf, and a voice
cries, "Hey, get a move on â lower de
rope!" An arab aloft on the wharf lets
down the rope, and straightway rises an
indignant voice fFom below, "Make a loop,
you Chinaman!" The loop is made, the
rope let down, and soon the signal to j
"pull away" is wafted up from the
ful time ia those days. In the spring of
that same year Goldsmith-Maid electrified ,
the sporting world by rounding the mile :
in 2:15% at Boston. The astonish ing ,
records of these latter days are attributable ;
in no small degree to the assistance of the
bicycle sulky. Since Lucy's time I have
driven Huldain 2:03 and Angie D, the :
pacer, in 2:07. One of my present string j
of trotters, Buzzeta, has a record of 2:06^,
and at Lexington, Ky., last October, I won I
the record for double teams with Miss i
Bita and Josie I) in S:I3W.
"You seldom hear of long-distance trot- j
ting races in these times, but in 1874, at I
Oakland, I drove Jack Stewart in a race of
twenty miles, circling tbe mile track
twenty times in 58 minutes and 59 seconds |
and winning a purse of $3000.
"In the best racing years I have driven
from forty to fifty races, generally the best
three in rive heats, but twenty races a year
would perhaps be a liberal average. Last
year was an exceedingly poor year and the
number only reached ten.
"Horseracing has been my life business,
and it is a hard business to break away
from. If I had my life to live over again,
though, knowing what I do of my chosen
field, I would never engage in horseracing.
It has pleasurable excitement to the
throng; it has moments that thrill one
through and through; but the business of !
horseracing is fraught with much worry

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
gloom of the pillared cavern. A trio
of ragamu.'rins pull and haul till beads
of perspiration gather on their foreheads,
and, rolling down, make creases in the
dirt from brow to chin.
"Once more â everybody â now!" is
shouted In an ascending scale, and now
the spile is landed on the sunlit ground.
Again and again the operation is repeated
on new-fallen spiles until the arabs
have realized an ordinary cord of wood.
They gather about and, as far as possible,
make an equal division, after which the
child laborers proceed to bear away their
respective shares to their homes on the
rocky hill. The arabs laugh as they
march away shouldering sticks that one
would think were burden enough for a
full grown man. The "wharf rats" do not
groan as they tug; each vies with the other
in overcoming difficulties, and failure in
an undertaking would mean the onslaught
of chaffing critics.
The wood being stored the gang takes
another tack. Under the wharf with crab
nets they go to emerge later with a num
ber of big, fat crabs. These are carried to
the base of the giant hill, where, in a pro
tected nook, the "white rats" kindle a
flame in an improvised fire place of rocks.
A great rusty powder can is called into
requisition and a committee brings tip
water from the salty bay. Tiie crabs are
dropped into the powder can, a sheet of
tin is used for a cover and the "rats" sit
around and swap stories, or limber them
selves and turn somersaults, or do some
| thing else of a diverting nature until mi
i vestigation proves that the crabs are suf
! ficiently boiled.
Crab after crab is fished up; the shell
goes here, the legs there, and in a few sec
onds every one of the gang is picking
| away at the crustaceous delicacy and
working his jaws as an indication of
healthy relish.
Are these street arabs gallant? On that
point you may stake your life. A little
girl, poorly clad and with a look of hunger
written oil her thin face, happens along.
She stops and gazes with half a sigh at
the banquet in the rocky nook. Ah!
there's where little hearts respond â under
the brow of Telegrapn Hill. Xobody talks
about giving. Bat the last crab in the
powder-can is fished out of the boiling
brine and a barefoot boy is running with
it to the side of the little maiden.
"Do not give me all â it is too much,"
ahe says.
"We've got heaps more," cries the boy
and scampers back to his comrades, leav
ing the little girl smiling through tears of
gratitude.
The "white rats" think nothing of this;
they would scorn to boast of such little
things. They merrily laugh and play
again, and if, perchance, their appetites
are still unappeased the bay is populated
largely with crabs and the boys under- i
stand how to reach them. Crabs prepared
by royal chefs and served in palaces taste
not half so good to the epicurean million
aire as these crabs, boiled in sea brine, to
the "white rats" of the beach.
Not many yards removed from White
law's wharf are ;o be seen a number of un
sightly piles, known as the dumps. From
all parts of the City come the trash and
refuse that build up these hills of rubbish ;
and dirt. It is attornoon and the "'white
rats" are busily delving in the black heaps.
"What are you seeking, my boys?"
"Spec," is the quick reply.
"And what is 'spec,' pray?"
"Junk!"
A kindly disposed person inquired tho
name of the youth who Acted as spokes
man for the gang.
"Willie ShaiiKhnPssy," said the boy;
"dey dubs me 'Baldy' fer short."
"Have you ever attended school, Willie?"
"Yep."
"How long, my son?"
"Eight mont's."
"Why did you stop?"
"Fired !'
"And whit for?"'
"Being good. "
One of the arabs stepped up, y,itn the
query, "Ha'hi't you never heard o' Baldy?
Don't read de papers, I guess. Say, he's
de geeser dat dug iip all de swag on Bay
street. Say, it was hot times den."
"And what is the story about this 'swag,'
as you terra it, Willie?" the curious
stranger'asks.
"W'y, y'see," replies Baldy, striking an
attitude of self-importance and throwing
his head back so as to peer straight into
the eyes of the questioner; "y'see, I was
under de sidewalk ratting for bones, and
wat does I do but hits ke'plunk against
two big sacks covered wid dirt. I ?ays,
['Wat's here?' says I. I opens one od e
I sacks, and gee-whizâ it made me head

"There is not so much money in racing
as many seem to believe. They hear of
large sums won, but not so much about
the big sums lost. On this coast the run
ning horse holds the leading place of inter
est at iÂ»resent, and trotting is necessarily
dull. I now have a string of sixteen trot
ters in training at Oakland. These I will
take East for the grand circuitâ Detroit,
Cleveland, Chicago, New York and other
big tracksâ about the Ist of May. This
string represents the finest stable I have
ever had. I always drive my own races
and superintend the training of my horses,
having trustworthy men to assist me."
Twenty races a year for thirty-nine years,
if we accept an average of four heats to each
race, would make a grand total of 3120
miles traveled by Mr. riickok behind his
trotters. This, if he were driving on a
straightaway course across the continent,
would leave him eighty-two miles to spare
after a journey from here to Gotham.
Long ago somebody suggested a National
boulevard from the Atlantic to the shores
of the sundown spa. If tit* bicycle and
the electrocycle do not retire the horse too
soon the country may yet stand along a
3000-mile paved highway and witness a
passing race (drivers and trotters chang
ing half hourly or thereabout) across the
continent from sea to sea.
A EOMANCE OF SCIENCE.
Approaching Semi-Centennial of the
suiii hs.iiii:m Institution.
Next September will b? celebrated the
semi-centennial anniversary of the birth
of the Smithsonian Institution. The fact
that this event will excite a most sympa
thetic interest wherever throughout the
world there is a home of learning or a
place for the pursuit of knowledge is the
strongest possible testimony to the unique
character of our National center of scien
tific research. Its history reads like a
romance rather than a leaf from the
most commonplace period of American
annals. The impulse that prompted
James Sraithsonâ an illegitimate son
of tbe first Duke of Northumberlandâ
to write in his will in 1826 the follow
ing passage came from nobody knows
where: "I bequeath the whole of my
property to the linked States of America,
to found at vV'ashinpton, under the name
of the Smithsonian Institution, an estab
lishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men." Smithson never
visitsd this country, and there is no evi
dence that he had any but the most super

Maybe we didn't sport, eh? De whole
gang fed in de high-toned hash factories,
and I bought meself a suit o' clothes 'way
up in G. De big blokrs blowed demselves
all over the water front and up in de stores.
De swag was all 'round â everywhere â
w'en de cops got onto it. Say! De whole
cheese was bogus!"
Baldy stopped a moment to allow the
fresh Jistener to his ott-told story to re
corer from the surprise that should follow
all such climaxes. Then He scratched his
head and wound up: "Dem was high
rollin'days on de front. 1 wa9 10 years
ola den, and dats four years ago. No more
boodle found down here â dis ain't no safe
deposit!"
"You spoke of hunting for bones, Wil
lie?"
"Yep. Bones is t'irty-rive cents a sack.
De bones is used to pure de sugar up de
refinery."
"Well, what do you find, for the most
part, in the dumps? and what profits do
you make?" pursued the inquisitive man.
"Scrap-iron â lots ol it â quarter cent a
pound. Brass â one cent pound. Rags â
say, dey rob u.s on rags â live cents for do
sack! Ain't dat robbery? Bottles â one
cent apiece. Beer bottles â two and a half
cents."
The boys pick rags and hunt scraps and
bottles on a strictly partnership baÂ«is.
When a sack is filled with scraps it is
dragged to the junkshop and the money
realized from the sale is divided among
the numbers of tne gang. The money 13
spent in such luxuries as swimming at ttie
baths, crossing the bay for an excursion,
visiting the Ciiff or in feasting at a chop
house.
"We finds loads o' stuff we don't look
for in de dumps," observed Baldy. "Once
dere was a pair o' roller skates â good as
new. Den dere was a pair od ese â w'at

ficial knowledge of the character of its
people and its institutions. His library
contained only two volumes relating to
America, but the writer of one of these
predicted that Washington, then a town
of 5000 inhabitants, with the stumps of the
virgin forest still remaining on Pennsyl
vania avenue, would one day rival in mag
nificence and splendor the cities of the
whole world. He may have heard, too, of
hlack eye and a sharD face sauntered up.
He introduced himself as Georgie Lang.
Baldy supplied the information that Lang
was "de champion fist-fighter o' de gant;,
but I licked 'im wid de gloves."
Lang said he learned to light "up in Gir
van's lot on Bay street."
"Billy Wilson loaned us de gloves," said
the champion, "an' I done up all de kids
but Baldy. Baldy put me out wid de
gloves, but w'en he tackles me fair fist,
den's w'en you'll see who's de champion."
This intimation was too much for Baldy,
who cannot afford to allow such doubts to
shake his prestige with the gang. A chal
lenge immediately followed Lang's clos
ing sentence. The date of the fight re
mains to be set. "Tilly, the Rat," a de
scendant of the Ctrsars, and Patsy Kelley,
a bright roguish-looking lad of 10, vol

no aanger of police interference in this
championship battle, because the "White
Rats of the Wharf," unlike the Corbett
and Fitzsimmons ilk-, are genuine sports,
mean what they say, and abhor the name
of "faker."
The "wharf rats" range in a?e from 8 to
! 14 years, Baldy having reached the latter
\ figure. Could many of these boys have
I proper care and training, they might dis
i tinguish themselves as men. Perhaps
I some of them will, in spite of their youth's
â  environments, in spite of associates with
I vicious elements; in spite of all the evil
i influences around their daily lives: for
I they are not ail bad, and some of them are
surely "diamonds in the rough."
But any article that touches, even thus
lightly, upon life among the youth of the
water front would be incomplete without
some reference to the endeavors of a num
ber of good-hearted people of means to
smooth the rough lot of the urchins of that
locality; and, of course, the youngsters
i thereabout are not all to be deemed "white
I rats." There are many little boys Â»nd
i girls on the front who are positively eager
j to acquire the mental arms of learning;
I caper to improve themselves by all avail
-1 able means. There are more, however,
the passage in Washington's farewell ad
dress recommending as an object of the
highest importance the founding of insti
tutions for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge.
In any case Smithson, who was himself
a scientific investigator of no mean fame,
and was, indeed, declared on competent
authority to be one of the most accom
plished mineralogists in Europe, doubtless
who must be attracted and lured by amus
inglpastirnesand healthful diversions from
the influences of the street?.
There is a City Front Boys' Club in the
second story of the brick building at 615
Sansome street. That ciub is a scheme of
splendid promise. It has ncariy a hun

for the benefit of the boys.

concluded that here was the place where a
fair endowment for the promotion of sci
ence would do the most good. He must
have reached this conclusion after mature
deliberation, for he evidently cherished
the most sanguine expectations of the lus
ter of tin; institution which he was to
found. "On my father's side," he wrote,
"I am a Northumberland, on my mother's
I am related to kings; but this avails me
not. My name shall live in the memory
of man when the titles of the
Northumherlands and the Percys
arc extinct and forgotten." And
yet it seemed for a while as if his bequest
was to be futile. He died in 1820, and it
was six years after his death that the
United States legation in London was no
tified that his estate, amounting to about
one hundred thousand pounds sterling,
was held in possession of the accountant
general of the Court of Ciiancery. There
came from Congress a chorus of objection
to the acceptance of the gift on the ground
of National dignity and of the Jess worthy
consideration that Smithson had tried
to get immortality at too modest a price.
It was mainly due to the efforts of John
Quiney Adams that this opposition was
finally overcome, and Richard Rush was
sent to England to prosecute the claim
of oin* Government to tne Smitnson be
quest.
The decision of the court was reached
with a celerity quite unexampled in the
history of that tribunal, and by Septem
ber, 1838, the first proceeds of the legacy,
in the form of 104,960 gold sovereigns, were
duly delivered to the Philadelphia mint,
where they were promptly recoined into
508,318 American dollars. Two supple
mentary returns from the bequest were re
ceived, amounting to about $;>O,OQO, and
the permanent fund, swelled by tome re
cent bequests, now amounts to $911,000,
which is held as a deposit bearing 6 per
cent interest in the United States treasury.
It took eight years after the receipt
of the bequest to enable the wise men
of the Nation to decide what to do
with it, and to Joseph Henry, who became
the first secretary of the institution, is
mainly due the credit of showing how the
intentions of the founder could be most
effectively carried out. Henry's plan was
based on the conviction that Smithson's
intention was to advance science by orig
inal research and publication; that the es
tablishment was for the benefit of mankind
generally, and that all unnecessary expend
itures on local objects would be violations
of the trust. In that spirit the institution
was conducted through a whole generation
by Professor Henry himself, and through
another by his successor, Proiessor Baird.
In that spirit it is directed now by Pro
fessor Langley and his associates, each
year of its history making substantial ad
youngsters, and they are taught by kind
ladies who devote afternoons from 3 to 6
o'clock to the work of instructing the little
fellows in such useful trades as may be
easily mastered.
The members are taught, for instance,
the art of making wicker-baskets and
demijohn-covers; how to make mats out
of rope, and hammocks out of cording.
Their work is sold at the market price and
the profits are divided among the workers.
Here is the beginning of a trade education,
with an immediate incentive to learn.
The boys work faithfully, spurred by the
knowledge that their labor will bring re
-1 quitement. The club is not a religious
i affair, but is maintained by contributions.
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst is one of the most lib
eral among the supporters of the plan.
In the evening the club is open from 7
to 9:30 o'clock, and Manager Hughson,
who has had experience with boys in con
nection with the New York Tribune's
fresh-air fund, acts asÂ» athletic instructor
and defender of the peace at these evening
meetings.
It is not only in Girvan's lot on Bay
: street that boys can with the gloves.
j In the City Front Club there are boxing
mittens of superior make. There in the
evening the arabs gather and have set-tos
I that awake enthusiasm and thunders of
vocal as well aa pedal applause. The boys
have beautiful scraps at the club, but they
j never get ill natured about such affairs.
Each one learns to take his medicine like
a man, and although some hard hitting is
indulged in nobody whimpers and nobody
complains.
In the athletic-room there are pendant
rings and turning-boards, horizontal and
; parallel bars, trapeze and mat ami dumb
j bells and swinging clubs. If anything
j would attract the average boy of the
i water front these opportunities for athletic

are not chairs enough to seat all the toys
the floor is not too good to squat down
upon, and the boys are not a bit averse to
â¢ settling down on the floor and there pur-
I suing their reading or picture studies.
The shelves in tlie reading-room contain
many picture-books, magazines and
periodicals that good people send in. The
Youth's Companion, Puck, Judge, Har
per's Young People, Life and a host of
I other publications are strewn about.
There is also the nucleus of a library on
the shelves. Robinson Crusoe is in evi
| dence, besides Fenimore Cooper's stories,
'â  Pilgrim's Progress, Fairy Tales, Dickens'
works, Scottish Chiefs, Mark Twain's
"Merry Tales" and a number of stories of
travel and adventure. And tlrere is also
I an American Encyclopedia.

married, but as to her husband she says,
"We are two." That is her affair and no
part of the story. She became converted at
San Jose not so very long ago and soon after
came up and applied for a place in the
"social wing" of the Salvation Army. At
the opening of the Shelter last January
Bhe was appointed to take charge. When
she looks at you, ana before she has spoken,
you know that she has had experience.
Her expression is not sad, for she has
not only her religion of "blood and tire,"
but a philosophy that is much cooler. She
will not fail to see what ever of grim humor
there may be in all the familiar horror of
the days and nights at the Shelter.
"One day a clean woman came here"
this little bit for instance. ''Her under
skirts were not much soiled, her nails were
cared for. I selected the best bed for her
and did not think of asking her to take a
bath â which with the others I insist on.
I went about telling the sisters of what
had happened. They were as much i
affected as I was. But the next morning â 
one of them expressed the fear that I had
made a mistake. We went into the new
comer's room, which she had already put
in order, turned back the covers and there
were three large 'graybacks' snuggled up i
so comfortably in one of the creases of the
sheet that it almost seemed a pity to dis- \
turb them."
She keeps a "register" of her guests j
with running comment that may serve the
purpose of a background against which j
they may stand in relief should they some
time be saved. It runs like this:
Mary Davis â Intelligent girl. Knows
enough to come in out of the wet. It waÂ»
raining. Three days from the County Jaii.
Kas had great success in her rustle for drinks
Jennie McCarthyâ Bugs. Knows the loca
tion of the County Jail. Sober and much dis
heartened.
Kate Duncanâ Clothes torn and a large con
tused lump on her head. Says her husband
disputed with her.
Mary Melville â Young; pretty; very
dirty; physically unable to speak the truth.
Says she is a stranger in town.
At first glance Mrs. Carson is not pretty.
Her mouth is large and is set out of cor
rect lines. Her eyes do not fill with tears
because of the sins of the world nor do '
they beam unduly in the conscious merit
Ol her occasional jest. They are large
and brown and full of knowledge. An
old woman figures in the story as break
ing a uniform silence at table by a fit of
laughing and explaining it by saying, "I
was thinking of how I fooled Judge Camp
bell." When the sergeant quotes herself
as saying, "Well, now. Mary, tell us how
you got to the Judge," it gives you no sur
prise. Not the sergeant alone, but all
these army people, have an exemplifica
tion of all their methods in their manner
of speech. It is so much the practical,
out-of-doors way of saying things that,
taken in connection with the business of
saving souls, it passeth all understanding.
Understand the sergeant does not get
into print willingly. In fact she only
came into the room after considerable per
' suasion on the part of her assistant, and
there was an interval of fully fifteen mm
ules by the somewhat faulty clock on the
mantel that was filled with broken and
irregular approaches to this story.
As sue tells it she sits a little awKwardly
in her chair, her knees apart, and one large
shoe that appears from under her dress is
tipped over on its side. She wears a
blue cloth, stiff-rimmed hat, the rim
drooping a little with time and
wear and the hat not sitting
squarely on the head. Her dress is of
green cloth, with a bit of velvet trimming
about the neck and lie breast. Altogether
she is neat and sightly. There is no touch
of the red of the army about her. Neither
is there in the calico-clad, stouter, older,
more voluble assistant that' sits at the
other end of the table, leaning interestedly
forward, eager with frequent interruption.
As I shall not myself interfere with the
sergeant once she gets started, I shal l not
allow the assistant â a very kindly old
woman â to do so.
She had been talking about the women
who seek the shelter, how some of them
came rolling in at all hours, how bathing
was a necessary incident to their recep
tion and before they were given a clean
nightdress and a clean bed, how they
fought against it generally, and how one
of them, after having been persuaded,
against long and bitter protest, had passed
the ordeal, and had finally reached com
fort between the white upper and nether
sheets, clad in a clean night robe, was
overcome in the silence of the nights'
brooding upon the insult, and, leaving the
bed, rushed into the street crying for help
and neaping curses upon the place. The
policeman that responded she begged to
go in and get her clothes, as she would
have no more of it.
'.rail, jail, jail, jail, jail, jail, jail. That
â¢ is what's the matter with the women who
come here. They have been sent to jail so
much. They cannot be made to understand
that there is some one who really cares
for them. They understand the jails. The
police they look upon as a uniformed or
ganization to get rid of them. It is their
one speculationâ how many days they will
get next time. They come out of the jail
and go into hilling until perhaps about the
third day when they are drunk enough to
be bold or careless. Then they go up again.
The police courts depm it their business to
free the cleaner public from contact with
these people; these people know it, and
that is all they know of societyâ that it is :
organized to get rid of them. Therefore
they find it difficult to associate any other ,
idea with our relationship 'to them j
and they fret and fight when
they encounter, a rule which we require
them to observe. The police themselves
smile at our efforts in the case of the
wrecks familiar to them. They say. 'Oh, |
yes you mean â¢ well, but we know this
one'; we have been passing her along for
lifreen yearÃ.' .. ..,
"But out of this ruck once in a while a
woman lifts up her head. There has fil- ,
tered through her brain a realization of i
the meaning of our care of her. ~lt is not |
long after that until she is doing good in I
the world. . . .
"There was the case"â now this is the ,
story-"of Old Kate. I will call her Old i
Kate. I met her just after I came to town â 
and frequently. = . J
"She was on the Barbary Coast and I was
! a soldier attached to the corps at the Sal-
i vation Dive on Kearny street. 1 met her
! often on tie street, and, ah! she was a
i disreputable Kate â filthy in her person
! and her language. You know we have
regular visitors to the jails and prisons. I
â  was assigned to the branch County Jail,
i and there 1 met Kate on a better footing
; than I ever had before. She was sober,
1 and could understand what 1 taid. I sat
! with and talked to her. I said: 'Kate, bear
this in mind. lam your friend. There is
j no need of your spending any more years
!of your life in this place. When ynu get
i out this time come to me. I want to help
you; I am your friend.'
"She said she would, but I was sure she
wouldn't. There was that little incredu
lous giimmer in the eye that speaks of
i unbelief. I did not leave her at that, but
every time I visited the prison I talked to
j her, "for she seemed at least well pleased at
j my attention. Her time expired and she
1 went back to Barbary Coast. Where
j would she go? What can they do? Their
I old habits and associations are strong
upon them. Set down in the streets by
the prison van, they know they are marked.
j There is the prison look about them, and
j they turn, with hardened, hopeless faces,
! back to their haunts aii'l into hiding until,
I as I said, emboldened by whisky, to take
their chancos with the police again.
"Kate had forgotten all about me, I am
I sure, until this period returned to her.
People criticize our methods. Well, never
i mind that. We were holding our services
: on the street, corner of Pine and Kearny,
a week or so after that, and were about to
take up our march to the meeting hall
down in the basement, you know, called
' the Dive. The bass drum had been struck
to give us the step, when the captain, as
I he tells me, was impelled as though some
; one had whispered fo him, to ask me to
\ sing. He stopped the march and I sang
j alone 'I Know That My Redeemer
j laveth. 1
"At that moment old Kate stag-
gered along. In another half hour
she would have been in the patrol wagon.
She heard '.he voice of the woman singing.
It was the woman who had said to her, 'I
am your friend,' and whom she had prom
ised to come to see when she got out, and
which promise she had not kepi â and
heie she was gettine ready to go back to
jail. She knew, she was.
"Swaying about on the outskirts of the
crowd, I did not notice her. We took up
our march and trailed down into the Dive
with a considerable following. The crowd

! had got seated and services were about
! to begin when there was a sound of a
j heavy fall at the door. I thought
! somebody was throwing bricks, and
ran out. There lay Old Kate at the
foot of the stone steps insensible. She
had staggered along after the flag and
drum, but was unable to get down the
; steps. I took the Jimp body in my arms
j and carried it down into the room. What
! a sight it was! It was raining in the street
: nnd her clothes were wet and bedraggled.
Her hair had not been combed since she
â¢ left the prison and there was an ugly cut
on her forehead that was bleeding in a
distressing way. 1 found a basin and
water and held her over it while I bathed
her face. Presently she came to and I
I talked to her reassuringly. The cut and
\ the bleeding and the dirt and chill
; and sickness that she must have felt were
I entirely ordinary to Kate. It was the
I other, the touch of kindness, that to other,
i better conditioned people would have
J come as a matter of course in her condi
! tion, that caught Kate. She looked up at
j me curiously now and then as I talked
and bathed her forehead, and after a bit
she threw back her hair from her face and
said:
11 'I believe you care for me.'
" 'Of course I do,' I said.
" ' Do you really care what becomes of
me?'
" 'Certainly I do.'
" 'But what could become of the likes
|of rue? What could I do â what could you
j do with me?'
"Ah! there was the rub. This shelter
had not been more than thought of at that
time. But I said: 'I am going to put you
on your feet â make a woman of you, if you
i will let me.'
"She did not talk any more, but re
mained entirely docile as though willing
to at least wait and see how the miracle
might be worked. I bound up her head,
' gave her a comfortable place on the
| benches and then went up to the street
i into the air to think.
" I was new to this business. 1 had
never asked for money from anybody at
that time. The door of a saloon across
the street was open and there was quite a
crowd there spending freely the money
that I needed. I went in among them
and said :
" 'Boys, I am in trouble.'
" 'What'B the matter now ?'they asked.
"When I had told them I said: 'I want to
save this woman. I want enough money to
pay for a room for her for a week until she
is sober and I can find a place for her.' Of
course, they gave me the money instantly.
That night I went to a lodging-house with
Kate. I washed her and rixed*her up. The
next morning her amazement grew upon
her as she awoke and found me with and
still interested in her.
"I had a great deal to do that day, but I
must not lose sight of Kate, so I took her
with me. She was full of anxieties and I
knew that she would have given the re
demption I promised for one drink of
liquor. But 1 talked to her and tried to
divert her thoughts until along in the
afternooon, when I saw her nerves were
giving way. I took her into a drugstore
and got a dose of something for her.
Later she snid she wanted to get some
thing from the room she had been stop
ping at, and I said, 'Very well, Kate, I
will Wan here at the foot of* the stairs.'
" 'Ah ! you are going to trust me alone,
then,' she said.
"'Why not?' I said. "Haven't you
promised you will come with me?'
'â¢ 'Yes, ard I would rather die than de
ceive you.' she said.
'That is the end of the story. Old
Kate is now an honest, sober woman."
But Sergeant Carson went right along.
"The aoors here are open all the time,
but we have not room for the entire popu
lace and we have to discriminate some
times. Our aim is to afford a shelter to
those seeking shelterâ who may at the
time they turn to us be in need of a friend
âand not to set up a place where the
utterly indifferent drunk may come to
sober up, get a meal and return at nighc
to their haunts. Our charge is 10 cents for
a clean bed. with nightdress, bath and
breakfast. But to most who come here
the bath is a horror against which the
comfort of all the rest will scarcely balance.
"We have to be very careful with their
clothes and all that, as we have no fumi
gating facilities as they have at the men's
shelter. We also require them to do a
little work about the place before they
leave in the morningâ clean up their own
room for instance. That done and breakfast
eaten they drift away.
Just then a little black-eyed merry
faced two-year-old on hands and Knees
crawled down the hall. The sergeant
stopped talking to watch its. progress. As
it came over the threshold it stopped to
survey the situation, and then went in
dustnouoly toward the sergeant, sat down
and tendered to her the piece of cracker it
held.
The sergeant leaned forward, elbows
upon her knees and looked at the little
thing.
"It is a girl," she said, and paused long
enough to allow thai statement to stand
distinctly by itself. Then :
"To think of the hard knocks that lie in
wait for this wee thing."
The baby made another smiling tender
of the bit of cracker, and the sergeant
picked the child up and held it on her
knees contemplatively and said, somewhat
to herself, "Baby, if you were very sick I
would not pray for you to get well."
Then she laughed quite merrily, touched
the baby's dimples ami set it down asrain.
"Whose is it? It's the child of a rescue
girl. The rescue girl is upstairs. You see
this house has several functions. There is
the shelter downstairs. There all appli
cants come. The rescue girls are sent up
to the top floor, where they may be by
themselves. We charge them nothing. We
are only too glad to have them come here.
Then the second floor is devoted to the
care of nirls who come to the City in
search of work and want a cheap and safe
lodging-house. That girl who passed
through here just now is such a one.
"The rescue department is a sort of pro
bationary precautionâ preliminary to their
going to the Rescue Home at Beulah.
Oftentimes great harm has come from
sending girls there who were really not
sincere in their wish to reform. Return
ing to their former life, they have led
away those who otherwise would have
stood firm. They profess a desire to re
form for their own ends, some of them,
and the ends are sometimes very evil.
They have been known to go to Beulah,
gain an entrance in the regular wav, for
the purpose alone of inducing the girls
there to return to their old life. Lieuten
ant had a case, two cases, of such
imposition. She found them in Portland;
two pretty young pirls who gave every
sign of repentance, and their rescue was
reported about as something calculated to
place two very bright diamonds in Lieu
tenant 's crown." And here the faint
glimmer of a smile came out of the brown
depths of Sergeant Carson's steady eyes
and even touched her lips.
"The girls wanted to be removed from
temptation â tqg6taway from their asso
ciations for a time and be surrounded by
better influences. That meant Beulah, for
we have no other place for these girls on
the coast. Transportation was secured for
them, and in company of the lieutenant
herself they came down and were placed
in the home. Three days they ate, drank
and slept comfortably there, and then, in
company with two other girls whom they
had influenced, they took up lodgings on
the lower end of Ellis street. I think it
was. Their only purpose in seeking our
aid was to get from Portland â where they
had gone hrokeâ to San Francisco. But
it was the loss of the other two, who really
intended to get away from that life, that
hurt us.
"To prevent that sort of thing we have
set apart the rooms upstairs for the early
steps of those returning. By the way, I
hear a deal about the great work tbat has
been accomplished in the closing of Mor
ton street. What has become of the girls?
"The door here is always open for these
and for any woman seeking friendly
shelter," continued the sergeant, "and
while advantage is taken of it to a great
extent by the jail-hardened class I have
described, it has already served the pur
pose of the rope to the drowning man â in
this ease drowning womanâ many times
in the brief months of its existence.
"It is getting dark. I must light the
lamps."

âEmerson. nas a very nice sense as to the
propriety, or impropriety, of
talking about the people in her care, even
without the names. That is a handicap.
Howeverâ
She is sitting in Mrs. Ensign McFee's
rooms on Market street mending a rent in
an apron, preparatory to taking the train
the next day: "When Captain Wise died
I took charge. There are seventeen girls
in the home now. In the four years we
have cared for 149 who saw their error
and have striven to escape from it."
"How many out of the number have
really done so?"
Captain Wagner kept to her sowing.
There was a slight chance of expression,
but it was not of sadness. These Salva
tion Army people have such an absurd
faith. They will see their whole fabric
fall to pieces, and at once begin twisting
the hair to the back of their heads in hard
knots so that it will not be in the way and
industriously begin to build it up again.
"That is scarcely a fair question," she
said. "At least it is haid to answer.
There is a woman now in the home who.
since she came under our care, has turned
back and fallen and turned back and fallen
again. And yet, having again turned
back I believe that her feet are firmly
placed and tliat she will go steadily for
ward.
"So you see you can't tell what will come
to all those girls at last. Some of them
are safeâ quite a number of them I think.
1 carry letters East with me to the friends
of a girl â a woman rather â whom I'm sure
you would have had doubts about a
year ago, but I certainly have none now,
although she fell away from us once and
laughed at our efforts to recall ner. We
found her in the first instance at the Re
ceiving Hospital.
"There had been a question whether they
should drive the wagon to the Morgue or
out to the Hall. In fact I believe they did
take it to the Morgue.
"And it was largely the fault of her
parents," she said. "Oh, the responsibility
that mothers have. I want to get her a
position as companion to some wealthy
person, for she is not fit for work like
some of the others. Oh, yes, she reads
beautifully and plays like a cultivated wo
man. And yet at 14 she had given her
parents so much anxiety that they sent
her out here. Think of "that as a remedy.
Her parents live in Philadelphia. They
wanted to get her away from the influence
Of some man and there were willing rela
tives here.
"She is not a child now, of course â
but is still young. When they
brought her to at the hospital we took
her to the home and she seemed quite con
tented for awhile. But as lier health re
turned she became restless and fitful. She
told me something of her story, but it was
the common one in her case. Absolute
willfulness, I gathered, was the chief cause.
She had no notion of restraint. A sug
gestion of it on tne part of the relatives to
whom she came threw her into transports
of passion. Then there came a man and
he was thoroughly bad. She used to sing
a song that somehow seemed peculiarly
applicable. She must have felt the song,
for I have seldom heard anything that
touched me so as her singing of it â we have
our piano, you know, and she played the
accompaniment. I recall only one verae
of it:
Like a jroang bird just left by its mother,
Its earliest pinions to try,
Round the nest will still lingering hover,
Till its trembling wings can fly.
"I have seen all the girls go to bed crying
after hearing that song. But, recovered by
our treatment from the sudden despond
ency that carried her body to the door of
the Morgue she became the most cheerful
of all our girls. I trembled a little at the
sign. She had a way, too, of looking put
of the western window that I did not like.
"One day a man in a buggyâ drunk and
swearing â drove down the road past the
home. Just in front of the cate his horse
became fractious and the man more and
more profane. Ho struck the horse and
it made a lunge sideways and the man fell
out.
"I ran into" the road as a passer-by
caught the horse. With a crushed hat
and torn clothes, and bleeding from a cut
on the face, the driver climbed back into
the buggy, took the reins, struck the horse
and drove wildly away.
"The girl I am telling you of saw the in
cident from her window. The next morn
ing her room was vacant and not even a
line told us where she had gone or
said good- by. For two years I did not
see or hear of her. But one rainy night
one of our lieutenants who knew her was
passing along a street of the Barbary Coast
and was attracted by the sound of a
woman's voice in one of the cellar dancing
halls. She was singing that song, 'A
young bird just left by its mother, its ear
liest pinions to try"'
"The lieutenant went down and spoke
to her, but with no sign of pleasure at the
meeting the girl laughed and said, 'Don't
mind me. I was not cut out to be good.'
"The man who had fallen out of the
buggy at our gate came up, put his hand
on the lieutenant's arm, laughed coarsely
in her face and pointed to the steps that
led up into the street.
"Now that was a case that you mi<*ht
have thought was hopeless. In the first
instance she had not come to us volun
tarily and had voluntarily run away. But
when, a couple of months ago, sick and
penniless, she found hersehf again de
serted it was not o* the bay or of morphine
that she thought, but of Beulah. You
I cannot say in figures the proportion of the
I backslidersâ at the last I mean. I know
! how the memory of a kindness will cling
j to these women" 1 take with me letters to
! this girl's people in the East telling of her
complete repentance and how she is over
come with homesickness and is willing to
be anythine to them if they will only say
to her, 'Come.' "
This is still another story. It is by Cap
tain John Wood in charge of the Food and
Shelter depot, known as the
Lifeboat, down on Oregon At
street, near the water front. . -
Theie a man in hard luck can LOST
find a bath (a square, tin ft e
tank), a nightsnirt (clean, but
made out of flour sacks), a Have
sleeping cot, with plenty of ix
covering, and a big tin of cof
fee and crackers in the morn- This
ing, all for a nickel. Every #.
night this place is filled. The A
decently disposed are given a "the
place upstairs. The drunks -Â
and disorderlies are kept in Utner
separate quarters âin what Story."
is known as the "tin room"
on the first floor. It was formerly a ware
house.
The walls inside are covered with, sheet
iron to keep out the rats. There is an im
mense amount of work about this big es
tablishment that is performed by soldier*
without pay. Twelve men are kept busy
all the time cooking and cleaning. The
bed coverings are subjected to constant
fumigation. They are hung in a room
next the bathing tank and the room is
shut up and a quantity of sulphur is
burned. The sulphur is said to kill things.
A large proportion of the applicants are
well-disposed men wno are simply "down
on their luck."
Many of them are thankful for a
chance to take a dip in the Bathing tank.
These are the men who are sent upstairs.
The practical eye of the otricer on the
door is quick to distinguish between them.
The others â the drunks and "fiends," the
ruck and wreck, of men â are sent along
into the tin room, where the smell of sul
phur is stifling and tne air is palpitating
with oaths and obscenity.
All the other stories, it will have been
noticed, pitiful as they were, are redeemed
by the triumph of virtue in the end. That
ot Captain Woods, in not being so, is the
most, pitiful of all. In telling his story he
did not say a word. He walked on through
the little* dark passage, rolled back the
heavy door of the old warehouse and
made a light.
There is still another story by En
sign McFee out at the array head
quarters on Market street, where
troops of barefoot children come and
are supplied with shoes, and where,
on the books, there is a long list of the
names of women, poor, desolate and
otherwise deserted in their age, who are
constantly looked after and cared for, and
where the very wretched go daily and are
supplied with medicine and necessaries.
There is still another story down on
Bryant street, and a very pretty one.
There is a house full of children under the
care of Lieutenant Ella Fisher. A one
time mansion in the one-time aristo
cratic quarter of San Francisco has been
turned into a "children's shelter," and
presents some interesting contrasts.
With some fine old trees still standing
guard in front the big bay-windows of the
mansion look out from their slight retire
ment upon unpaved streets and surround
ing squalor. Inside the place is alive with
little ones. Children of 6 are dressing;
and attending the wants of children of 3.
In a room somewhat removed from the
clamor there is a sick child under the
especial care of the lieutenant. In another
room a feeble-minded Japanese child sits
on the floor and sways its little body in
silence by the hour. A troop of
healthy children are romping in the
yard. Toe walls of the * long draw
ing-room of the old mahsion are half
covered with a blackboard upon which
are figures and rude drawings. In the
parlor across the ball, and standing by a
piano, are a banjo and a tambourine and
the red flags of the army. The dining
room is a little story in itself. It is a long
one, intended evidently for a hospitable
table. One end of the room is occupied
by an immense old fireplace with big pro
truding chimney, crane and andirons. The
floor is bare, and down ihe length of the
rcom stretches a plain board table and
plain benches. Forgetting the time and
place these benches naturally fill up with
bearded knights in big top boots who
drink deeply out of long pewter mugs and
sing ribald songs and toast the barony
and mingle strange oaths.
But over the center of the table, sus
pended from the gas fixture, is the still
stranger legend, destroying at once the
baronial idea : "Christ is the head of this
house, the unseen guest at every meal, the
silent listener to every conversation."
There are twenty-nine children in the
shelter, ranging from Ito 10 years. Lieu
tenant Fisher, with three assistants, takes
care of them. Neither of these four receives
any pay.
There are still other stories, but these
will do.
I was present when General Booth first
met his congregated soldiers on this coast.
It was at the pavilion in Oakland. The
big building was crowded beyond the
doors. When the commandant came
upon the platform with his lieutenants
there was an uproar of drums and Jiorng
and cheers and waving of flags that lasted
many minutes. With exhaustion, how
ever, a aeep stillness followed, while they
waited to hear the commander speak.
With hands on the red-covered desk in
front of him, his long body leaning over it,
he addressed them like a father, saying:
"My beautiful, beautiful people."
I greatly regret what I said about Ser
geant Carson not being pretty. For it is
' not true.

DON'T WANT A BOULEVARD
The Property-Owners on First
Avenue File Their Ob
jections.
Several Reasons Advanced Why the
Proposed Improvement Should
Not Be Had.
The heretofore peaceful spirit which pre
vailed in the progressive movement of
the residents of the Richmond district
has been somewhat marred by the propo
sition to boulevard First avenue from its
intersection with the Government reserva
tion at the Presidio boundary to Fulton
street on the south or Golden Gate Park
at the northern terminus.
The adaptability of making First avenue
an acceptable driveway from the park to
the Presidio has been foremost in the
mind 3of the army officers stationed on
that reservation for a number of years.
The Merchants' Association, the Rich
mond District Improvement and the Point
Lobos clubs also indorsed the plan. With
this pressure from such representative
bodies the Supervisors, on the 29th of
February, passed a resolution instructing
the Superintendent to recommend to the
Street Committee the grading and paving
of this avenue.
In compliance with this resolution the
recommendation was tiled with the clerk
of the Bourd of Supervisors. The next
step taken by the Supervisors was on the
9th of March", when a resolution was passed
giving notice of intention to grade and
pave with bituminous rock the street from
its intersection with the Presidio reserva
tion to I<ulton street and at the same time
to place cesspools at the proper street
crossing, together with granite curb
atones and artihcial stone sidewalks the
entire length of the street.
This notice of intention aroused the hos
tility of the majority of the property
owners, and no time was lost in riling a
series of protests against the proposed im
provements.
The number of protestants so far heard
from who have signed their names object
ing to the work number forty-seven, with
more to be heard from.
The protests as riled do not set forth the
reasons why objections are made, but in
oral statements made they assign that
there are only about twenty-seven houses
built on the entire avenue; that the gra<ie
has not been satisfactorily fixed ; that as
other property-owners build by and by the
street must oe torn up to make sewer, gas
and water connections; that there is no
proper sewer on the avenue.
The Odd Fellows' Cemetery faces on
quite an extensive frontage, south of
Point Lobos avenue, and according to the
law under which this cemetery was formed
the property cannot be assessed for taxes,
liens cr mortgages, consequently no con
tractor will bid on that section of the work.
On the west side the Bay District Race
track occupies almost the entire distance
from Point Lobos avenue to Fulton street.
This property belongs to the Stanford
estate, and may in a measure be tied up in
litigation for years to come.
From the objections raised together with
the determination of the protestants it
would seem as if the First-avenue boule
vard would be an uncertainty in the Rich
mond improvement scheme. At all events
the present objectors will have the satis
laction of stopping the work for six months.
BACK FROM KAWAII.
General Warfield Says the People Want
Uncle Sain to Guvero Themâ An
Efficient Army.
General R. H. Warfield of the California
Hotel returned yesterday after some three
weeks in the Hawaiian Islands. He says
that it is pretty prosperous in the islands,
and that altogether he found the trip very
pleasant. Anent a story that he had gone
down to the islands in connection with a
new hotel, and that capitalists there were
willing to build a hotel according to plans
he might submit, he said there was some
foundation for it. It had been proposed to
erect such a hotel, but still it appeared
that it would be a long time in the future.
"The islands," said he, "are in excellent
shape, but 1 found everywhere, and among
the natives as well as others, a desire that
the United States would in some way or
other take them under their protection.
They didn't care much in what way, so it
was done. They would be satisfied to
stand in the same relation as a Territory
to the Government.
"The array, too, I found was every way
efficient. It is a good deal better army
than is generally supposed, and is amply
able to look after the interests of Hawaii.
If the United States had the country fifty
police would be enough to handle it."

STAMP MEN HAVE A DAILY
Unique Distinction Achieved by
a Popular Hobby of the
Day.
BIG AUCTION SALE OF LABELS.
Nations of the O.d World Petitioned
to Suppress the Issue of Specu
lative Stamps.
Stamp-collecting bears the unique dis
tinction of being the only bobby that has a
daily publication issued in its interests,
but this it has had only since the first of
the year. On the Ist of January, more as
a joke than with any serious purpose, the
C. H. Mekeel Stamp* and Publishing Com
pany of St. Louis sent out copies of a four
page paper which bore the title of The
Daily Stamp Item. The "office cat" ap
peared as editor. It contained news and
contributions concerning stamps, and the
announcement was made that subscription
in the United States, Canada and Mexico
would be $3 a year and $6 abroad, and that
"the publishers reserve the right to refund
subscriptions and discontinue publication
any time the 'office cat' gets tired of edito
rial work."
'Ihe monthly and weekly competitors of
this enterprising publication were almost
unanimous in their expressions that the
time was not ripe for such a move, but
while they were indulging in these dis
couraging prophecies tne publishers went
right ahead. They arranged for regular
correspondents in all the large cities of the
United States, including fcfan Francisco,
during the early period ot publication, and
later made arrangements for telegraphic
dispatches concerning auction sales of
stamps and other important news matters,
and it now publishes each day telegrams
from New York, Chicago, Boston, Phila
delphia and occasionally, as the news war
rants, from this City. It will also soon
have cablegrams from the European stamp
centersâ London, Paris, Berlin, Brussels,
etc.
It is looked upon by collectors as a per
manent institution, for, though it has been
tamed for but three months, it has demon
strated fully that there is enough of inter
est transpiring to furnish quite a lively
aad valuable daily Etarnp paper.
Auction sales of stamps are now at their
height in all parts of the country, though
none have been or are to be heid in this
City. The largest sale of the season thus
far, and one that is likely to remain such,
was that held at Boston by "Woodward &
(Jo. The sale occupied three days and was
attended by all the prominent dealers and
collectors of Boston and neighboring cities,
while New York, Washington and Canada
were also represented by gentlemen from
those places, and San Francisco and other
more distant cities were represented by
proxy.
The total amount realized from this
sale was $13,078 58, no Jess than twenty
tive lots bringing in excess of $100 each,
and these lots m nearly every cuse con
sisted of but a single stamp. The highest
priced lot was a pair of Canadian 12d of
1851 on laid paper, which realized $1320.
One of the worst banes of the stamp
collector, and the cause of greatest dis
couragement to those deeply interested in
philately, are the class of stamps termed
speculative. These comprise particularly
the product of people vrho contract to
furnish Governments with stamps free of
charge, on the understanding that the
surplus stamps revert to the contractor,
and that a new issue be put into use at
frequent intervals. So groat has this evil
become that it has resulted in the forma
tion of societies^in both England and in
this country for the special purpose of
discouraging the collection of such stamps
and of preventing their issue. These
bodies comprise the most influential people
connected with the hobby oi" stamp col
lecting.
Not long ago a petition was addressed
by the American committee lor the sup
pression of speculative stamps to the Cen
tral and South American countries, who
were serious offenders ill the practice
Charged, with the result that they were
successiul in inducing Honduras and Ecua
dor to cancel their contracts. Encouraged
by this success, the same committee has
now addressed a similar document to the
sinning countries of Europe. Excerpts
from this petition read as follows:
As spokesmen for millions of earnest men who
devote their leisure time and surplus energy
ftndresoarees to the scientific study of postage
stamps, we, the undersigned representatives of
philatelic societies, respectfully memorialize
all enlightened Governments to discountenance
certain evil practices which tend to demoralize
and degrade the postal service.
The evil practices which we condemn may
be classed under three separate heads, differ
ing more in form, however, than in substance:
Firstâ Farming out to printers, or private
speculators the monopoly of balances remain
ing after a stamp issue has been withdrawn,
the tendency being to withdraw issues fre
quently so as to make the monopoly more prof
itable to the speculator 6nd his official confed
erates.
Secondâ lssuing stamps for temporary use as
a commemorative emblem rather than" for the
legitimate purpose of acknowledging prepaid
postage, the tendency being to destroy the
usefulness of the token as a postage stamp
and to make it the subject of speculation.
Thirdâ The reckless or deliberative super
fluous multiplication of unusual varieties of
the same stamp by means of surcharging
(overprinting) oftener than the legitimate
needs of the postofflce require, the tendency
being that officials will create new varieties for
purely speculative purposes.
This petition further says that these
practices "shake the confidence of stamp
coilectorg in all the postal issues of the
offending Government, and it even affects
national credit by creating the impres
sion that the nation is too poor to raise
revenue by legitimate methods."
In conclusion the petition says: "We
solemnly protest against all these vicious
methods. We appeal for the historical in
tegrity of the postage stamp, and for na
tional dignity in the administration of the
postal service, as a factor in the intel
lectual, social and moral progress of all
enlightened nations."
FOSTER AND JONES TO RACE
The Two Retired Cracks of the
Olympic Wheelmen to Re
sume the Sport.
A Special Prizs Competition Draws
Them Backâ Plight of a Cycle
Writer.
. The idea of giving away an especially
valuable prize by bicycle manufacturers to
riders making certain records on their
make of wheel has been a popular form of
advertising, both to the makers and riders,
during the \ past year. One company ' of
fered a thousand-dollar grand piano to the
man riding the fastest twenty-five miles in
competition on the road, and it was won by
a Buffalo rider in 1:02:25 last October. A
tire firm offered a $750 gold ; ; brick to the
man ; riding the fastest unDtced mile on
any wheel fitted with their tires. There is
a dispute now as to whether ;..W. C. Sanger
of Milwaukee or W. W. Hamilton of Den
ver, both champion riders, is entitled to
it, and it seems likely that Sanger will
get it.
It has remained for a Chicago firm, how
ever, to make the best offer of them all,
and one in which the wheelmen of this
coast will be particularly interested, as it
seems more than likely that the prize will
go to a California rider. The Rambler
makers exhibited at the Eastern cycle
shows a special wheel valued at $1000. It
is decorated in gold and silver and set
with ieÂ»vels. The enameled parts are em
bellished everywhere in the must artistic
designs in silver. The bright parts are
silver-plated and the brake ia covered witn
silver and gold enamel. The spoke nipples
are of gold and glisten through rims of
polished mahogany. This beautiful wheel
will be presented to the rider who before
the first day of next November shall have
ridden the fastest mile on a Rambler
bicycle in competition at any meet held
in "this country sanctioned by the League
of American Wheelmen. Further, the
company will give $500 in gold coin to the
meet promoters at which such fastest mile
shall be ridden.
Mr. Varney, the Rambler agent in this
City, is particularly anxious that both
these prizes should come to California,
and will do all he can to that end. The
races must be amateur events, and it is
said that with so many fast amateurs on
this coast and the fast tracks now here
and to be built it is more than likely that
some California man will get the wheel
and some California club the track prize.
This competition will have the effect of
bringing LacK into the ranks of the coast
racers Walter F. Foster and Allan N.
Jones of the Olympic Club Wheelmen, who
retired last season, but have now an
nounced their intention of going on the
path again, principally to compete for
these prizes.
The offer of the Rambler people was the
principal subject discussed around the
clubs last night, and lor the time being
the coming relay race was forgotten, but
not for long, however, as that race is only
distant two weeks from to-day, while the
Rambler prizes cannot be competed for
until next November. The impression is
general that a Californian will get the
prize wheel, and that the record will be
made on the fast track of the Garden City
Cyclers at San Jose, which is surfaced with
cement, three laps to the mile and is
a record-breaker. The first meet to be
held on it this year will bo on May 9.
To-day mostof the local wheeling clubs
will go to San Leandro to try out their
men in ten-mile events for tne coming
relay race, as stated in The Call yester
day.
The members of the Bay City Wheel
men are much incensed at an article which
appeared in an evening paper Friday,
written by one of their own members, and
which they claim is wholly untrue, in
which no names are mentioned but the
club and several prominent members are
by inference severely censured. The
writer of the story did well to stay away
from the clubhouse that evening, as a self
appointed committee chosen from among
those who felt the slight was intended for
them hovered around the front door of the^
wheelroom, each armed with a bucket of
water, in the hope that they would be
given a chance to dampen his spirits. But
he came not.

Coming Sale of the San Fran

tric Railway.
WHO WILL THE BUYER BE?
Successful Effort of the Labor Bureau
to Secure an Adjustment
of Claims.
Apparently the Labor Bnreau does not
exist in vainâ at least, so say the hitherto
sorrowing employes of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Electric Railway. In 1894
the road, which for some time had been
running at a los?, went into the hands of a
receiver, Sanford Bennett, treasurer of the
Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden Company.
By order of court the employes to whom
â wages were due were to receive a certain
proportion of the earnings of the road
until the property should be sold and
their claims satisfied in full. In pur
suance of this order two dividends were
paid, each workman receiving; $20 in two
installments, after which they were forced
to possess their souls and their claims in
patience.
These claims for services rendered ag
gregate over $18,000. The workmen began
to fear that they would never be paid, and
under pressure of dire necessity some of
the men sold their claims at rates as low
as 25 cents on the dollar. Others, to the
number of 200, appealed to the Labor
Bureau, begging that its influence be ex
erted in favor of their lawful demands.
Mr. Fitzgerald, the Commissioner, and
Mr. Dam, his deputy, did all in their
power to further the cause of the work
men. At length, after many trips back
and forth and the expenditure of many
good and legal postage-.stamps, not to
mention floods of eloquence, another
order of court was secured, commanding
that the electric tramway with all its
rolling stock and franchise privileges be
sold forthwith aud claims aeainst it satis
! fied in the following order: *irst, the
receiver's foes and expenses; second, the
bill of the Risdon Iron Works for materials
used in the laving of the road, and third,
the claims of the employe?.
The order of court, however, did not
bring the overdue wages into the hands of
the waiting workmen. Weeks and months
passed ; the sale was. frequently announced
and as frequently postponed, but no one
could perceive any money in sight. Mean
while the Labor Eureau gave the
matter a little friendly jog now and then
in order to remind tne employes, the great
public and all others concerned tnat a day
of reckoning would have to come, ft
now seems as though that day were about
to dawn.
Yesterday information was received at
the headquarters of the bureau to the
effect that arrangements had at length
been perfected whereby the sale of the
roiid will take place on the 11th of April
without fail. Mr. Bennett, wno supplied
the information, was very reserved as to
the bidders for the property, but empow
ered Mr. Dam to assure the employes of
the road that their claims would be speed
ily adjusted in full, since he had reasons
fur being convinced that the price to be
paid for the road would cover all claims
against it.
Considerable speculation as to the prob
able purchaser is rife, most of the business
men inclining to the belief that the Mar
ket-street cable railway will come into
possession of the road.

ROMANCE OF LITTLE MOTJNDS.
In This Strange Company Are Gathered
Men of Almost Every Nation
on Earth.
If you are fond of long walks in the
suburbs of San Francisco, and you hap
pen to wander over the United States mili
tary reservation, your steps may lead to
a lonely spot out near the Golden Gate,
where, in a vtilley dreary with stunted
growths and hummocks of half-tamed
sand dunes, long rows of white posts bear
ing names and dates, and strangely sug
gestive of plantation nurseries, intrude
upon the landscape. There are fences
round these rows of painted boards, and
then, as you draw near, there are mounds
side by side, all of an equal length, and
all sandy, save where nature has spread
the golden eschscholtzia, and the blue
nemophila amid the tufts of weeds.
The garniture of the wilderness is in
perfect harmony with this desert spot,
for the place is very wild indeed, secluded
from worldly sight by kindly hills and
groves, and unknown only to an occasonal
pedestrian who leaves the beaten path for
the Presidio hills. With all its wildnesp
the mounds and the white boards within
its rugged borders contain many a roman
tic story. The story, however, in each in
stance is a buried romance of the sea.
Every little hill marks the grave of a
sailor â the resting-place of Jack, where
there are no storms â for the acre of
mounds in the sailors' cemetery in San
Francisco.
Strange as it may appear, this burial
ground has at least 200 hardy fellows
under its sod, the men who came from all
quarters of the globe to the port of San
Francisco and never sailed away again
through the Golden Gate. They are the
tailors who came up from the sea in ships.
It was their lot to brave the ocean through
many a tempestuous mood and at last go
aloft like any ordinary land-lubber, and
after all their watches and wanderings to
have only a place among the dreary sand
bills, with bits of white-painted boards at
their heads.
How they came to meet this fate is an
other stor\' that has various interesting
points, for around Jack in his troubles and
nis last struggle the men beside him say
there is ever something of the romantic
side of life. It may be fate, as the sailor
himself would call this characteristic fea
ture, but anyhow it i? present. When
Jack coraoÂ« into port from another part of
the world and feels the hand of sickness
pressing heavily upon him, he forsakes his
bunk for a bed provided by Uncle for
him in the Marine Hospital. It matters
nut what his nationality may be. so lone
as he is a sailor he belongs to the Republic
of the High Seas and the great leveler in
lifeâ t c M*aâ is his guarantee of solicitude.
And so out in the Government institution in
Richmond there are constantly 100 s?.ii<>rs
gathered from all lands and suffering the
common ilis of hamanity. Too often the
journey to the hospital proves to be Jack's
last voyasre on earth, for every month the
ro.icalf fail 1 - short in the local institution
by four or rive names. A short walk over
the hi. l and those same names may be
upon the white board-, where flowers
have not yet begun to bloom upon the
sand freshly turned. The rows of whitened
:s have simply stretched otit a trifle
longer in the month, and the extension
represents the names that were dropped.
For this almost unheard of cemetery
within the City's limits is the burial
pround of the United States Marine Hos
pital.
And what visitor to the spot cao say that
. Jack has not a tender heart? Here are
sermons in simplest form. Even amid the
' unlovely headboards and weeds one may
learn a homely lesson from the work of
some rou-h sailors, who are now God
knows where. The touches of tenderness
left upon the sandy mounds appeal to one
with a pathetic earnestness, though, after
all. they be nothing more than wooden
monuments and frames, or fences, for an
occasional grave, a tiny marble slab or a
cluster of flowering plants.
:> About the last thing the crews of ships
have done in San Francisco before sav
ing," said an officer of the hospital, point
ing toward the few monuments, "was to
come out here and decorate the graves of
their dead comrades.
"The crew of an English ship lost a cora-

rade. who was buried here. They con
tributed enough out of their wasres to bay
a fence and head monument, and the day
before their ship saile I for home they
w.-re out here at the grave. Then they had
a photograph taken of the monument to
show in England that they had done
everything in their power for their ship
mate. . a
"Some of the other fences and flowers
were placed there by friends of the sailors.
Those people knew the men buried here
and they came and put *ip monuments
ioÂ»ed rinwers upon the graves. They
were all seamen, and as far a-i I knew had
nothing in commcn more than a warm
heart for one another."
These dead sailors form a strange com
pany as they lie side oy side. They sailed
Francisco in ships from every land
Ibe B ,n, except Turkey. As an ll-
I stration of the extraordinary diversity
of nationality, it was stat-d that the sail

arises, what is it that carries off so many
able men?
There is a belief that sailors succumb to
acquired diseases, accidents on board ship
and sickness brought on by exposure. The
United States Marine Hospital Service re
port for 1894 shows that hfty-six men of
the sea died that year. TheÂ«e cases are
divided into general diseases, 25; local, 20;
injuries, 2. Consumption ended the days
of seventeen of this number and only one
man succumbed to scurvy.
The other diseases that proved fatal were
of the nervous, circulatory, respiratory
and digestive f-ystems. This is news to
many landsmen^ who imagined that Jack
was usually drowned, or died according to
some queer belief about sailors. The
strantrestof it all may be thisâ that as a
rule Jack finds his last resting place ashore,
and that the number who go to Davy
Jones are infinitely in the minority.
When the summons comes for Jack to go
aloft he is dressed in hi 3 own clothes, that
is the apparel he wore on entering the
institution. Then they place him, this
rough sailor, with his dress of the sea,
which perhaps still savors of the salt air
and the unctuous pitch, into a plain, stout
redwood coffin. There is not much ado
over his interment. He is put under the
sand wich a board at his head, and, at least
â he is with his mat's.
COWS WILL BE KILLED.
DiseaHed Bovines Under the Ban of the
Board of Healthâ Dairymen
Arrested.
Milk Inspector Dockery's crusade against
the dairies that have failed to comply with
the Board of Heaitli regulations prohibit
ing the keeping: of sick cows will begin
some time during this week, and the in
spector expects to destroy a large number
of bovines. The dairymen have b en given
ample notice to rid themselves of their
tuberculous cows, and will be allowed no
further time in the matter.
It is also expected that during the pres
ent week a number of restaurant and notel
keepers who nave failed to take out per
mits to f-ell milk will be arrested and
prosecuted in the Police courts.
Dockery was on the San Uruno road
blight and early yesterday morning, and
while the milk" examined was of good
quality, and, therefore, passed muster, he
caught two milk-men without the required
registered numbers on their wagons, and
arrested them. They were L. de Santi
and Z*no Gwerder, proprietors of the San
Francisco dairy.

CAPTAIN HEALTH'S CASE.
The DUpatfh Announcing His Dig-
missal Is Not Believed to Be True
by UN Attorneys.
"I can't believe the report, and I won't
until it is confirmed."
Such was Frederick A. Healy's comment
on a published telegram announcing his
father's dismissal from the United States
revenue service. The popular young bar
rister was much grieved and incensed at
the report, and finds it impossible to give
credit to it.
"If my father had been dishonorably
dismissed in the high-handed fashion
which the dispatches indicate," lie re
marked, "surely he would have received
some notice of it. He has near and dear
friends in Washington, who would see to
it that the earliest news, good or had, as
to the result of the inquiry would reach
hi*n without delay. It looks as though
tne dispatch had been evolved from the
fertile brain of some one of the gentry
who trumped-up the charges against my
fa' her, which the testimony at the trial so
triumphantly refuted."
MfS'rs. Henley and Costello, Captain
Healy'fl attorneys, also regard the dis
patch as meriting no high degree of
credence.
"Ii Captain Healy had been thrust out
of the service," remarked Mr. Costello
yesterday, "we would have heard of it
before now. It seems to me the most that
can befall the captain is a transfer, vr per
haps only a reprimand. Until we receive
some confirmatory intelligence we cannot
repose any confidence in the dispatch."

THE WONG KIM ARK CASE
Question of Chinese Citizenship
Will Not Be Decided
This Spring.
Attorney-General Harmon's Attitude.
A Decision Wanted on the Merits
of the Case.
The case of Wong Kirn Ark, now pend
ing in the United States Supreme Court, a
decision in which will definitely settle the
question of whether a native of this coun
try, born of Chinese parents, is or can be
come a citizen and a voter, will not be
heard at the spring term.
Word to this effect was received by
United States District Attorney Foot" and
George 1). Collins in this City yesterday.
Attorney-General Harmon had hoped to
have the case advanced and placed on the
spring calendar, so that a decision could
be reached in time to pievent the voting
of the 500 Chinese in San Francisco who
claim to he native sons of California. It
transpires, however, that the Supreme
Court's calendar is so crowded that the
Depuitment of Justice could not have the
case advanced, and it will now come up at
the October term.
"It is to be regretted, of course, that the
case could not he advanced, " said Attor
ney Collins yesterday, "but Mr. Harmon
has informed us that the calendar was in
such a condition that the desired advance
ment was impossible.
"There is just one thing to be done now,
and that is, in October when the case is
signed, to ask the court to defer its decis
ion until after the elections. I believe Mr.
Harmon is in full accord with our views
on this matter, and that this course will be
pursued.
"There is every probability that should
the Supreme Court be called upon for a de
cision before the date of election a decree
! miobt be rendered not so much upon the
bare merits of the case as we could wish.
It is our contention that the sons of aliens
who may not or have not become citizens
of the United States arc not, by reason of
their birth alone, citizens of the United
States. This is a point that ha* never yet
been brought before the Unite! States
Supreme Court. It is not the only point
we rely upon for a reversal of Judge Mor
row's perfunctory ruiint;, yet the point is
of such a nature that we desire a decision
upon its merits alone, aside from any
question of policy which, should the de
cision be given just before election, the
court would certainly be juscitied in con
sidering. Hence we shall ask that the
decision be postponed till after November.
"If this is complied with and the point
ruled upon, as we hope it will be, ihere
will be ample time before another election
for the Caucasians who may be dis
franchised by tne ruling to make good
their citizenship."
Notwithstanding that the Supreme
Court of the United States will not be j
likely to afford relief from the 500 Chinese
of this City who threaten to cast their bal
lots in the fall, there is quite a strong feel
ing in this City over the question, and ef
forts will be made to put a quietus on the
ambition of these young Chi no- Americans.
They will be, at least and by all means,
examined most severely on the educa- j
tional qualification, and to this end the j
"native sons" are now learning the consti- <
tution by heart.

A graphic idea of tuft immense size of j
Siberia may be gleaned from the following j
comparison: All of the states, kingdoms, j
principalities, empires, etc., of Europe j
(except Russia) and all of the United |
States, including Alaska, could be placed j
side by side in Siberia ana yet but little
BOff than cover that immense country. >

TOE SUNDAY THOUGHT.
The task of suppressing lotteries is one of
those issues which Lord Bacon described
as appealing to both the business and the
bosoms, of men. It appeals to business,
for tne lottery swindles waste the money
of the people. It appeals to the bosom, for
it is a matter of morality that fraud should
be punished and law sustained. Appeal
ing, therefore, both to the economy and
to the honesty of men, every issue involved
in the suppression of lotteries should re
ceive the vigorons championship of all
those whose intelligence and morality is
sufficient to give them an influence in the
community.
The contest against lotteries has been
carried far enough to place upon the stat
ute-books a law providing a penalty for all
engaged in it. In all of its forms and
phases, and in every step of i'.s processes,
the lottery business is an illicit traffic.
Nevertheless it flourishes. Hidden from
the police, it yet makes itself known in
almost every household. It manages to
(achieve this by the aid of newspapers that
circulate everywhere. The freedom of the
press has been cunningly used to serve the
violators of the law in their efforts to swin
dle the people.
As the law stands to-day, it would be
comparatively easy to so far suppress the
operations of the lottery swindlers that but
a very small proportion of the people
would be reached by them, if it were not
for the freqnent publication of lottery lists
and notices of lottery prizes by newspapers
that otherwise maintain such a degree of
respectability they are received in the
homes of the City and read by young and
old.
Police officials have repeatedly stated
that they could virtually eradicate the
evil from this City if it were not for these
publications, and their statements have
never been refuted. The suppression of
lottery advertising in all its forms is there
fore an essential step toward tne suppres
sion of the lotteries themselves. It is,
moreover, the step that must be taken
next.
A defect in the law prevents the punish
ment of certain forms of this advertising,
and the police and the courts are power
less. The only recourse therefore is for
the business and the moral influence of
the community to exert itself. Lottery
notices are published simply because they
are better paid for than any other form of
advertising. With the newspapers that
publish these notices it is a matter of coin
merely. If any of them found that they
would lose subscribers and advertisers by
lending tne aid of their columns to an
illicit and swindling traffic they would
soon adopt a different policy and become
as free from such things as The Call
itself.
We recommend to the people of San
Francisco on this day of rest a serious
thought whether they will any longer sup
port a newspaper that aids swindlers in
robbing the people of the City, taking
money from the home and from business,
deriding law and corrupting morals. If
the strong elements of the City put away
from their homes all papers that advertise
lotteries it will not be long before all
papers will refuse such advertising and
the victory will be won.
THE WILMEEDING SCHOOL.
The suggestion to combine the Wilmer
ding School with tho Lick School ol Me
chanical Arts offers a solution of many of
the difficulties that have presented them-
selves in regard to the establishment of
that institution. The Wilmerding bequest
of $400,000 is hardly sufficient to develop
the usefulness so greatly desired for the
institution. The Lick bequest is $540,000.
Of this amount $115,000 was expended in
starting a school, leaving $4^,090 as a per
manent fund for its maintenance. This is
none too large, but it is about $140,000
more than be left in the Wilmer
ding fund if the proposed school be set up
on a scale of excellence equal to that of the
Lick. This, of course, would not produce
as good results as would be possible under
some plan of combining the two schools.
The details of the proposed combination
aretbat the regents of the State University,
who are the trustees of the Wilmerding
bequest, lease one of the two excellent
buildings of the Lick School and erect an
additional house in the near vicinity, the
two schools to be then conducted so as to
be mutually helpful. As the Lick is more
for theoretical instruction than the Wil
merding was intended to be, each school
can be made a complement of the other
and an aid to the other's efficiency. Thia
suggestion has received an added interest
from the recent movement to locate the
Southside High School in tha immediate
vicinity of the proposed combined schools
of industrial art.
The placing of the Wilmerding School
anywhere but in San Francisco would be
a subversion of its purpose. It was clearly
the intention of the founder that the
school should be located here, and it is
equally clear that in no other locality in
the State could such a school be advan-
tageously and conveniently used by so
many students. Several sites have been
offered in the City, and each has its pe
culiar advantages. It will be the duty of
the regents to weigh these and select the
site that i 3 likely to conduce most to the
fulfillment of the will of the founder â
that of providing the best training possible
for tne greatest number of boys and girls
in trades that will enable them to be
self-supporting, helpful citizens of the
community.
AN IMPORTANT INQTJIKY.
The commission recommended in a re
port from the Senate Committee on Edu
cation and Labor will have some heavy
work to do if Jhe suggestions contained in
the report arc carried out. It provides
that the commission shall be composed of
twenty-one member?, drawn from leading
labor, industrial and agricultural organi
zations, that it shall be non-partisan and
that it shall investigate the subjects of
labor, agriculture and capital and recom
mend legislation concerning them.
Among the suggestions contained in the
report is the following: "The universal
dependence upon transportation com
panies is a fact or a question of prosperity
or lack of prosperity of agriculturists
which demands attention. In some States,
as in California, this factor is of supreme
importance; in others less. The fact that
oranges from Spain and Italy compete
successfully with oranges from California
in the great markets of the country is
wide-bearing. The cost of transportation
of California fruit to market is 90 cents
to $1 a box, whiie foreign fruit pays 32
cents. In less than carload lots it now
costs about $2 a box to lay down Califor
nia fruit in New York. Spanish ones pay
50 cents a caÃe, but the case is twice as
laree as that containing fruit with which
it competes. These facts tend to show
one of the principal causes of complaint
that is now being made by a very impor
tant industry of a great State, and the
present case would fairly come before such
a commission as is proposed. Lower
freight rates and a measure of protection
by tariff for domestic fruit would revive
this now languishing branch of horticul
ture."
That is a plain and truthful statement
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
of the case. In fewer words it means that
a protective tariff and tne removal of a
transportation power which is able to de
termine prosperity or its opposite are the
great considerations before the country. A
commission composed on the lines laid
down in the report would be something
uniaue in the history of the country. Its
report would represent the great produc
ing classes and would not be inspired by
any influence that England and Wall
street might be able to brine to bear. It
would open the eyes of the Nation to the
possibilities residing in a legitimate en
couragement of those industries and inter
ests which must be considered if the pros-
perity of the country is desired, and would
call attention to this splendid Western
empire which will in time become the
leading source of National wealth.
A NOTABLE EVENT.
The elaborate preparations which the
people of San Jose are making for their
rose carnival which will open May 6 indi
cate that a spectacle of uncommon mag
nificence will be presented for the enter
tainment of residents and visitors. Its
principal feature will be a street parade of
gorgeously decorated floats, and in order
that its composition may be a surprise
even to tnose who participate in it all
parties concerned will be bound to secrecy.
Colonel A. K. Whitton, who has charge of
this branch of the festival, will alone have
knowledge of the details, and his tact and
skill will be called into play to prevent
duplications and produce a general har
monious effect. The indoor feature of the
festival will be managed with equal abil
ity.
It is in the month of May that the
witcheries of the Santa Clara Valley are
presented in their most charming aspects.
Although only fifty miles from San Fran
cisco the climate is quite different from
that of the larger city. Between the val
ley and the ocean are reared the Santa
Cruz Mountains, which deflect the trade
windÃ and fogs and leave the glowing
plains to sunshine and balmy airs. As
one of the comparatively few cities in Cal
ifornia that appreciate the wonderful pos
sibilities of a semi-tropical climate in the
production of floral effects San Jose is
famous for its gardens and for that reason
has come to be known as the "Garden
City." "When to this intelligent adorn
ment are added miles of clean and smooth
bituminous streets and an abundance of
deciduous shade trees we find perfect con
ditions of beauty.
The Santa Cruz Mountains on the west
and the Coast Range on the east form a
noble setting for the exquisite valley of
which San Jose is the center. The floor of
the valley is carpeted witn orchards and
vineyards, and they are threaded with
hundreds of miles of roads which the
State Bureau of Highways nas proclaimed
to be the best in the' State. Here rural
life in California is found developed to its
highest perfection. Bordering the smooth,
dustless, tree-lined avenues which stretch
away through the valleys in all directions
are thousands of artistic homes, each with
its well-kept lawn and flower garden. The
finer parts of rural England and France
present no picture more alluring. Pros
perity, comfort and good taste and an
utter absence of squalor and neglect indi
cate a fecundity of soil that makes indus
try profitable, and a pleasant climate that
renders existence a delight.
Such are some of the charms that await
a visitor to the approaching .carnival of
roses at San Jose during the fairest month
of the year. It will not be sufficient to
confine the visit to the city itself. Its per
fectly kept country roads leading away in
all directions are an invitation which none
can afford to neglect. Those running to
the east and the west ascend the moun
tains on either side, and from these heights
one may look down upon a scene whose
enchantments can never fade. The splen
did winding road to tbe summit of Mount
Hamilton, whence the Lick Observatory
watches the whole stretch of the valley
and the shining Bay of San Francisco, is
the most famous and wonderful drive in
California, terminating at the greatest ob
servatory in the world. It is not alone
strangers who may learn something of the
infinite variety and beauty of California
by visiting the carnival of roses; every
Californian who embraces the opportunity
will acquire an added fondness for the
charms of his State and an increased pride
in its glories.
OPENING THE SEASON.
More and more are Californians learn
ine to appreciate the advantages apper
taining to summers that are free from
rains, mosquitos, malaria and oppressive
heat. The season opens propeilythe Ist
of April, when trout-fishing becomes al
lowable by law. In that matchless sport
its devotees have a large choice of con
venient streams stocked with trout, pro
tected by law and threading forested
mountains of incomparable beauty.
The next great outing event will be the
100-mile relay bicycle race round the
southern end of San Francisco Bay from
San Francisco to Alameda. This is a
gentleman's contest, and with eight re
lays for the trip the run will be full of
excitement and will be participated in by
scores of contestants. Then the regular
fiesta season will open. The cities pre
paring for these are Los Angeles, Santa
Barbara, San Jose, Oakland, Santa Rosa
and Healdsburg, and others are talking of
falling into the procession. Each festival
will have a distinctive character, all are
projected as spectacular events and the
wealth of flowers that bloom in California
will be the chief decorative feature.
The seaside and mountain resorts are
preparing for a large business. The com
pleteness, elegance and variety of these
are a marvel to strangers, but the wonder
ceases when it is learned that these estab-
lishments are free from the annoyances
attendant on similar placea in the East
and that the natural charms environing
them ana the royal health and pleasure
which they afford are more than the pros-
perous residents of the State can afford to
neglect. Besides the resorts devoted more
particularly to the furnishing of elegant
ease and rest are the innumerable medici
nal springs of every conceivable variety
that offer a wonderful combination of
cure, comfort and entrancing mountain
scenery.
There are so many chrantes that a resi
dent of any part of the State may fiud a
delightful and wholesome change in a few
hours' travel. From the comparatively
hot plains of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin valleys the residents may run
over to the coast and find a climate
cool, bracing and altogether different from
that to which they are accustomed, and
the coast dwellers can find in the moun
tain resorts the dryness, calm and brilliant
sunshine that are sometimes withheld
from the coast. Thus the opening of the
season means a constant shifting and in
terchange and a valuable accession of
health, pleasure and happiness.
When San Francisco comes to be better
understood by the millions who exist in
the refractory climate of the Eastern
States, it will be the "great health and
pleasure resort of the United States. Not
only is it a city having peculiar attrac
tions as the result of its bewildering cos
mopolitanism, but it is the center of a
marvelous group of natural charms. To
ward its completeness everything that
niaKes California unique contributes it 3
separate quota. A climate that gives birth
to the choicest semi-tropical products and
the finest wines is reflected in the balmy
and stimulating quality of San Francisco's
sunshine, ocean winds and comfoitable
cheer. The whole coast from San Fran
cisco to San Diego is another Riviera, and
the fragrance of roses and orange blossoms
is perennial. The destiny of the City is
foretold in the qualities which distinguish
it, and that will be accomplished when the
people of the United States have learned
the beginning of prosperity is health, com
fort and pleasant occupation.
THE NEGLECTED LEOTUEE.
Professor Barnes recently stated that the
lecture is no longer so popular as formerly
and that those given under the auspices of
the California Academy of Sciences had
been Badly neelected. This is the more
remarkable by reason of the fact that the
lecturers, supplied largely from the corps
of able teachers in the Stanford and Berke
ley universities, were conspicuously intel
ligent men and thorough masters of the
useful subjects which they treated.
Professor Barnes is right; the lecture is
no longer a popular metbod for the educa
tion of the masses. The reasons for the
fact are obvious. One is that it is impos
sible for any lecturer to present the whole
of an important subject in the course of an
hour or two, and the other is that the orig
inal high function of the platform has
been degraded into a show-place for the
exhibition of notorious personages.
Lecturing in schools is a very different
matter. There the lecturer has a year in
which to present his subject, leading his
classes steadily on while his theme en
larges and matures. The casual lecture of
instruction to the public must be either
a sadly maimed condensation, lacking pro
portion, perspective and comprehensive
ness, or a mere slice out of the heart of the
subject. The wonderful cheapness of tbe
printing-press has made books accessible
to all, and the wise student knows that
lectures are wofully inadequate as com
pared with books. There are many per
sons not sufficiently developed intellectu
ally to have mastered the art of learning
from books and magazines. They are the
primitive members of society and as such
they can learn through the ear better than
through the eye. But it is evident that in
their case the subjects presented must be
correspondingly simpleâ must be confined
to tne very rudiments of knowledge â or
they will be listened to unheeded.
The mistake of most scientific lecturers
is that they do not comprehend the situa
tion. The earnest student knows that the
memory of the ear is unreliable; with
books he has a constant and ready means
of correcting errors by reference. He is
aware that a lecture is merely an oral essay
md knows that if he has the essay in
print, to be studied and criticized line by
line, he has a reliable guide that discredits
the spoken word. The lecture was useful
before books became plentiful and cheap,
but the printing-press lias reduced it to a
folly.
NEW PRESIDENTIAL CONDITIONS.
Changes in Dovbtfvi, States and Rules for
Choosing Candidates.
In one particular at least the National con
ventions of the two political parties to be held
this year will differ radically from Naiional
conventions of recent times. Continuously since
the close ot the Civil War tho three States which
have exercised a determining influence upon
Republican National conventions have been
Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania. In all throe,
us well as in lowa and Nebraska, preliminary
elections were held in October, and it was
thought essential to Republican success that
these States or a majority should go Repub
lican.
After 1872 Pennsylvania fell out of the num
ber of October States and it has ceased to be
contested seriously at Presidential elections,
hs since '.hat time the Republican lead has been
overwhelming. Before 1872 Pennsylvania was
regarded as a close State. Even in the prelim
inary October election of 1808 the Republican
majority \tas only 9000, and at the election of
the year before the Democrats carried the State
by a plurality of 900 votes. Ohio and Indiana
remain not merely October States, but closely
contested States as well, and the importance of
their electoral vote is such that both parties
continue to compete for it actively. The Demo
crats went to Ohio for their Vice-Presidential
candidate in 1804 and to Indiana for their Vice-
Presidential candidate in 1870, 1880 and
1884. In 1888 they went a?ain to Ohio. The
Republicans went lot their Presidential can
didate to Ohio in 1876 and 1880, and to In
diana in 1888 and 1892. While Ohio has
been regarded uniformly aR indispensable
to Republican success, New York State, with
New Jersey and Connecticut, has been re
garded as essential to a Democratic triumph.
The Democratic delegates have shown
themselves as solicitous for the electoral
vote of New York as the Republicans have
been for the vote of Ohio, and there has been,
therefore, the peculiar spectacle in modern
American politics of an almost unbroken suc
cession of residents of New York nominated
on the Democratic side, and an almost un
broken list of residents or natives of Ohio
nominated on the Republican side.
Tne political conditions which may be said
to contront the two parties this year are radi
cally different from those which have existed
i:i times of previous National conventions.
The State of Now York, for the Jirst time since
the days of William H. Reward, who was
New York's favprite for the Republican nomi
nation at the Chicago convention of 1860,
has an earnest and sanguine candidate
of its own for the Presidential nomi
nation on the Republican side. In the
1860 convention Mr. Seward received 137
votes on the lirst ballot to 102 for Abra
ham Lincoln mid 49 for Salmon P, Chase
of Ohio, and was therefore the favorite
candidnte. While the Republican party
is visibly stronger in the lormer doubtful
States of 'the East, New York, New Jersey ami
Connecticut, than It has been at any time for
many years, the success of the Republicans in
their former strongholds of the West is seri
ously threatened by the defection of the Popu
lists, who complicated by their action all the
most confident prophecies made in 1892. The
Democrats, too, are without any enforced de
pendence upon doubtful States, East or West,
tiiis year, and Illinois and Minnesota seem to
promise better results than New Jersey and
Maryland. The contest of 1890 at the conven
tions will be a free-for-all one, as fÂ»r as prece
dents and past conditions will be involved.â

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Harry de Windt of London, the noted trav
eler and author, who has arrived here, en
route to explore new and wild regions in
Alaska and Siberia, and who Is at the Palace,
said yesterday:
"It is my present intention to form my expe
dition at Mount St. Elias, having reached that
vicinity by the regular steamer. Then I will
attempt to cross that absolutely unknown part
of Alaska lying between Mount St. Ellas and
Cape Prince of Wales, the extreme northwest
ern point of the American continent.
"I understand that in crossing Alaska there
is little danger from natives, but ttie extremes
of temperature are great and climatic condi
tions terribly severe.
"On reaching East Cape, the most easterly
part of Asia, which at one time I expected to
accomplish largley on the ice, I shall proceed
Harry de Windt, Now Here, Who Is to Explore Alaska From Mount St- Elias to
Cape Prince of Wales, and Siberia From East Caps.
[Sketched by a "Call artist."]
to Ghijiga, a distance of about 1000 miles, !
thence to Okhotsk, a further stage of 800 miles, '
and thence to Yakutsk.
"This part of my journey â¢will be performed
first by reindeer, then by dogs, and finally by
hoian. At Yakutsk I shÃll proceed, in the i
summer, by river to Irkutsk, then by post
road to Tomsk, and, by my old route, home, ;
through Russia. Should I reach England ;
safely at the end of 1^97, as I expect, I shall
have traveled about 22,000 miles; but as this
journey has never been attempted, it is impos- >
sible to say how long it may take to accom !
plish.
"My object in undertaking it is first to ex- i
plore Alaska in regions unvisited hitherto by
Europeans, to make a further study of North-;
east Siberia, and to ascertain the conditions of ]
political exile at Yakutsk, one of the remotest â¢
settlements in Siberia."
Mr. de Windt says that George Kennan's sto
ries of maltreatment of Siberian prisoners are
greatly exaggerated.
"The knout is now completely abolished, and
even the net is only used on the island of
Saghalien," he said, "where its employment is
absolutely necessary for the preservation of
human life. Any one who has seen the vil
lainous ruffians I saw there, living and enjoy
ing all the privileges of free and enlightened
citizens, would have no difficulty in believing
this."
Mr. de Windt is about 40 years old. He hus
been traveling all hia life, has been in nearly
all the countries of the globe. He has by the
various means of travel, including going afoot,
on elephants' and camels' backs, by rail, boat
and otherwise, compassed hundreds of thou
sands of miles. He -.v ill remain in San Fran

A charming collarette for theater or opera
wear was made of rose-colored velvet, with a
frill of chiffon to match seam inside the col

inches all around the ccllarette, over the ruffle,
which was of velvet.

A top of royal blue velvet edged with sable

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Divorcesâ N. N., City. The law of this State
says that divorces are granted for adultery, ex
treme cruelty, willful desertion, willful
neglect, habitual intemperance and conviction
of felony.
Fractional Currencyâ Frank, City. The
only 25-cent fractional currency for which a
premium is offered is the one that is known as
"the Fessenden '-5,' on solid bronze." For
such the sum of $2 30 is offered, providing the
bill is new and crisp.
AN Old Paperâ C. C. H., Dixon, Cal. The
old paper you mention in your communication
is probably one of a million fac-simiie of a
Pennsylvania paper containing an account of
the death of Washington. Were it a genuine
one it would have a value for those who are
hunting curios, but afac-simile has no value.
Manuscriptâ Roy, Santa Cruz, Cal. AH
manuscript for compositors' use should be
written only on one side of the paper. If you
desire to retain the friendship of the com
positors write on paper not wider than com
mercial note, but typewritten copy is the.
which is most preferred by readers of manu
script and by the majority of printers.
Leap Yearâ C. 8., Tracy, Cal. Any of the
hundredth years that cannot be divided by
400 is not a leap year, and as 1900 cannot be
divided by 400 without a remainder the next
leap year will not be until 1904. The Gregor
ian calendar, established in 1582, # then and
ever since known as the new style, was so ar
ranged that of the hundredth years to come,
only 400 years were to be bisextile years hav
ing 3GG days, whereof the year 1000 was the
first.
First Day of thk Weekâ S., City. Dif
ferent authorities agree that the first day of
the week is Sunday. One authority says:
"The name of Sunday or day of the sun belongs
to the first day of the week on astrological
grounds, and has been so used from far beyond
the Christian era and far outside of Christian
countries." Another authority says: "Sunday
is the first day of the week observed by Chris
tians in honor of the resurrection of Christ as a
day of rest from secular occupation and devoted
to the worship of God."
Expenditures and Resultsâ J. N. S., Van
couver, B. C. If we assume a community in
which all labor can be employed in remunera
tive work then the employment of $1000 worth
of labor to produce only $100 is a loss to the
community. If, however, there is much labor un
employed the expenditure of $1000 to produce
$100 more would be a gain to the community.
The $,1000 paid out in either case would be
neither lost nor gained, but simply transferred
from the pooketof the employer to those of the
workmen and its potency to employ other la
bor would remain undiininished. The wort
done at a mine, in which the sum named has
been expended to produce $100, however,
would begone, and the solution of the problem
depends upon whether in a given community
the men who did the work could have been
more profitably employed or not.

AND
BOOKMAKERS
IT is a peculiar fact which has never
been paraded in print that the leading
humorous writers and lecturers of
America started out to make their
living in the world by acquiring a
knowledge of the printer's trade. Some
body may now venture the supposition
that years of familiarity with serious edi
torial copy has had the strange effect of
inspiring the genius of humor. Be that
aa it may, the fact remains that our best
humorists have been printers. Mark
Twain was a printer's devil at thirteen in
Hannibal, Mo., and he worked at the case
for many a year in the Golden West.
Charles Farrar Brown (Artemus Ward)
followed the printer's trade for years,
i'avid K. Locke (Petroleum V. Nasbv)
served an apprenticeship in a printing
office at Cortland, N. Y. Charles B. Lewis
of the Detroit Free Press learned the trade
in Lansing, Mich. George W. Peck ac
quired his Knowledge of the "art preserva
tive" at Whitewater, Wis. Bob Bimlette
knows all about a newspaper office; and it
was probably the regret or Josh Billings
that instead of devoting his boyhood to
farming and his young manhood to auc
tioneering he had not taken a course at j
the case and through the typesetters' tui
tion put the finishing touches on his
humorous bent.
THE AMERICAN IX PARIS.
This biographical novel, by Eugene
Coleman Savidge, is now in its second
edition. It views the Franco-Prussian i
war, the siege of Paris and the commune I
from an American standpoint. Among
the actors in the book are Bismarck,
Moitke, "William of Prussia, Napoleon :
111, Eugenic, Thiers, Favre, Labouchere, j
MacMahon, Bazaine, Grant, Sherman,
Sheridan, Washburne and Zola, and he j
declares them to be the authors of the '
words they speak in his volume. The in- I
cidents of the world-changing struggle ;
between France and Germany, according !
to the author, were selected from the most j
effective records made by various
dramatic observers. Mr. Savidge has I
certainly built up a remarkable
story and clothed incidents of the
long ago with fresh and deep interest
'â¢from the American point of view." The .
chief character running through the vol- j
ume is Kent, the son of a California mine
owner and ranchman, who has been sent
Bast to college, and then dispatched abroad j
by his father speculatively to sell beef and
. â â â¢ eto the commissary departments dur
ing the anticipated war between the (it-r
--man and the Frank. By accident, young
Kent becomes attached io the American
legation at Paris, where he seeks, with
enthusiasm, to acquire the diplomatic
talent. He falls in love with one of the
court ladies, and is soon aware that those
charmers of the gentler sex are often the
most valuable diplomatists of royalty.
His career is influenced by Hortense Le
Bianc, in spite of himself. She is i
one of Napoleon's favorites, and an adept !
in the diplomatic art. The incidents which
bring these characters together are alive
with interest, from the first meeting of the
twain at a royal fete in Paris to ttie trag
edy which ends Hortense'? career in the
midst of the commune. From learned
Americans in Paris Kent is made familiar
with much unwritten history. "The Fall
of Richmond," for instance, "presaged
that of Louis Napoleon." He learns that ;
the French throne was tottering and a
European war was imminent because a
Kepublic existed securely in America after 1

foreign attempts to undermine it. He
learns that Bonaparte and Lord Palmer
ston had conspired against American
liberties; and that Bismarck had prac
ticed brilliant duplicity on the strength of
the result of the American Civil War.
That result and the emphatic American
protest against French occupation of
Mexico, followed by Maximilian's down
fall, had weakened Napoleon's xirestisre.
Then Bismarck hail tempted Napoleon
iuto changes that would restore the tar
nished prestige. Napoleon listened and
agreed. He remained neutral while
Prussia vanquished Austria and Sadowa;
but Bismarck never fulfilled the promise
to join with France in a division of Eu
rope, and France was suddenly con
fronted by a United Germany. This
was the Dries of American intermed
dling. Bismarck had all the time been
vetting ready for the conflict that was
bound to come when France realized tbe
deception. ''The American Republic
tempted Napoleon into loss of prestige;
that loss of prestige gave Bismarck his
01 portanity to make Sadowa and united
Germany, and that lies at the base of the
war between France and Germany." The
book contains much historical data.

ADVENTURES OF HATIM TAI.
This Persian romance, in its English
version, was originally published s-ixty
rive years ago, but it was i-sued in the
form of a costly folio, buried in great
libraries and scarcely found its way at all
to the general public. It is now brought
out in available shapes in the "Classics
for Children" series, and readers young
and old will be delighted and ed'ried by it.
The story consists of seven connected
tales of the same general character with
those of the "Arabian Nights Entertain
ments." It compares with those master
pieces in exciting interest and imaginative
richness of startling adventures. Hatirn
was an Arabian tribal chief of the latter half
of the sixth century. He is held up to-day as
the embodiment of the Mohammedan
ideal of human excellence. He represents
what man should be according to the
standard of Islam; and in that the four
chief virtues are faith, veracity, kindness
and blind submission to the decrees of fate.
Duncan P^orbes was the translator and
William Rounseville Alger is the editor of
the revised edition. [Boston: Qian it Co.,

A WOMAN INTERVENES.
Robert Barr's reputation as a novelist is
enhanced by bis latest production, "A
Woman Intervenes, or the Mistress of the
Mine." Jennie Brewster, who is really as
much of a heroine as the good angel, Edith
Longworth (although the author intended
the latter for a model worthy of example
and Jennie for a character to be execrated),
is employed on a New York newspaper.
She i.-j "a sweet, innocent-looking girl,"
who boasts that she tuts lured state secrets
out of members of the Cabinet, while ordi
nary Senators and Congressmen are her
lawful prey. She had gone to a hotel as
chambermaid in order to write up
her experiences, and had been ar
rested and locked up that she
might write a three-column account for
the Sunday edition of "How Women Are
Treated at Police Headquarters."' Miss
Brewster is detailed by the editor to cross
the ocean in the same steamship with two

experts, who have with them a confiden
tial report as to some important mines in
Canada. To male reporters on this side of
the water those experts have been impen
etrable. Miss Brewster secures a seat at
table next her intended victims. She fas
cinates Wentworth, the more susceptible
of the two, gets him to talking about him
self and obtains the whole story. The
guileless Wentworth has been led on under
the impression that he was talking to the
daughter of an American millionaire. If
the report i s published before its delivery
in London it means disaster to a big
scheme. Jennie intends sending the story
by cable from Queenstown. Near this
port the ship breaks down, and Miss
Longworth keeps the newspaper woman a
prisoner in her cabin until the boat has
pushed off and it is too late to send the
cablegram. Both young women exhibit
much bravery. It* turns out, of course,
that Edith, although for long unknown
in the premises, is the real "mistress
of the mine." Jennie redeems herself
somewhat by obtaining information while
masquerading as a housemaid for pro
fessional purposes in the villain's house
that saves the mining enterprise from
wreck and ruin. The two experts, botli
heroes, pair off in the end â Edith and the
man she has aided, John Kenyon; Jennie
and the man whose secrets she once un
locked, Wentworth. [New York: Freder

THE AUTHOR OF "CLEG KELLY."
S. R. Crockett is one of the English au
thors who in the last lew years have writ
ten themselves into popularity. He is a
new light in the literary firmament, and
his few volumes have received praise from
no less capable authority than the Hon.
W. EL Gladstone. His best known works,
perhaps, are "The Lilac Sunbonnet" and
"Bog-Myrtle and Peat," but his most re
cent production, "Cleg Kelly, Arab of the
City, promises to greatly enlarge his cir
cle of admirers. In the new novel the
lights and shadows of curious phases of
Edinburgh life and of Scotch farm and
railroad life are pictured, it is said, with
an intimate sympathy, richness ot humor
and truthful pathos which will make
"Cleg Kelly" welcome to readers every
where. The novel, finely illustrated, has
just been issued by D. Appleton & Co.
"THE CHARLATAN."
Robert T. Buchanan and Henry Murray
have written in collaboration a novel,
"The Charlatan," founded on the drama
of the same name. The story has appeared
serially in the newspapers, and is now re
published for the first time in book form.
The work is intended as an exposure of
humbugs and charlatans, especially those
who use theosophy and hypnotism as the
rallying ground for their imposture. The
book, itÂ«is contended, is not an attack upon
theosophy, nor a satire against hypnotism.
The authors acknowledge indebtedness for
the original idea, and notably for the
sleepwalking incident which figures in
the story, to an unpublished sketch by
Miss Harriet .lay, authoress of "The
t^ueen of Connaught. 1 ' The book cannot
fail to interest. [Sew York: P. Tennyson

THE APRIL 31AGAZINES.
St. Nicholas.
St. Nicholas for April is a fine issue
from whichever standpoint it is regarded â
literary, artistic or typographical. It
opens with some account of flying ma
chines by Tudor Jenks, who inclines to
the belief that "all signs seem to show
that many boys and girls now living will
see flying machines traveling through the
air, and some, perhaps, will ride in them,
which, oi course, is quite within the
bounds of possibility, peeing the advanced
stage reached in the experiments of Maxim
and others, a very curious feature of
tli is article is a picture illustrating a
German artist's idea of warfare in
the air, where sturdy Teutons are
shown with wings and manipulating
rifles from aerial points of vantage.
John Vance Cheney has a pretty piece
of verse in St. Nicholas entitled "Cloud
land," which will be read with interest by
his admirers in this City. "Mardie's Ex
perience" is the name of a story dealing
with the ambitions of a country girl to be
come an authoress. Mardie pines for the
larger life of a great city, so she goes to
New York, where her manuscripts, deal
ing of the sayings and doings of dukes,
baronets and duchesses, are persistently
rejected by steely hearted editors. One of
these gentlemen gives Mardie some trood
advice, handing her at the same time a
copy of a book that has made its author
famous. To her infinite surprise the*
would-be authoress discovers the writer to
be her own mother. The story, by Kate
Dickinson Sweetser, is cleverly worked
out, and prettily written.
Other ieatures of this excellent number
include:
"Two Maidens" (verse); "Little Bob Kim
ball" (verse); "The Scissors" (verse); "Teddy
and Carrots": "Clondland" (verse); "A Won
derful Trick" (verse); "Lieutenant Harry";
"The Prize Cup"; "A Puzzling Example";
"Sinbad. Smith & Co."; "How the Whale
Looked Pleasant": "A 'Dare'"; "Stalled at
'Bear Run'"; "The Olympian Games"; "The
bwordmaker's Son," etc.
The Cosmopolitan.
Tbe Cosmopolitan is a well-filled literary
dish served at the modest price of 10 cents.
The opening article, entitled "A Word
About Golf, Golfers and Golf Links in
England and Scotland," by Price Collier,
contains many interesting data on the
sport that is dear to the heart of the Hon.
Arthur James Balfour; "Vicissitudes of
the Dead," by Eleanor Lewis, is an ably
written article on a rather gruesome sub-
ject. Ex-Postmaster-General Thomas L.
James gives a history of tbe development
of the overland mail service in this coun
try.
Miss Beatrice Harraden of "Ships that
Pass in tne Night" fame contributes a
story under the caption, "Hilda Strafford."
Like much of this author's serial work, it
professes to describe life in California, or
at least, t!ie southern portions of the State.
'â¢â¢An Imperial Pleasure Place" is described
by Isabel F. Haugood, and incidentally
treats of the life of the Emperor and Em
press of Russia.
"Civitas Dei" is the title of some verses
written by Sir Lewis Morris, who was
mentioned prominently in connection with
the laureateship prior to the selection of
Austin.
In The World of Art and Letters Ed
ward S. Martin makes comment on tbe
London Spectator's remark: "That the
Americans should believe that they hate
us, or at any rate should profess to do so,
is a very grievous wound to Englishmen ;
but what is bitter beyond all bearing is
the thought that the Americans not only
do net like us, but do not even know that
we like them." Mr. Martin thinks that
rich Americans have been drawn to imi
tate rich Englishmen; that London has
tbe same attraction for wealthy Americans
as the candle to the moth; and that for
these reasons the American is bound to
disguise, as it were, his natural brotherly
love for his friend across the water.
"And," adds the writer, "the instinct of
self-preservation leads us to pitcn into
thsse intolerable countrymen of ours who
show themselves so irresponsibly overap
preciative of British delights!"
Toward the close of his article Mr. Mar
tin protests the friendship of America for
England in this wise:
But how can the Spectator believe that the
majority of the Americans hate the English?
Don't we descend upon their plensaut island
every su::irner like a swarm of locusts (except
that unlike locust* we pay for what we eat)?
Has any eminent Briton come to these shores
withinhalf a century that we have not stood
on our heads to welcome and entertain? Were
we pruff to the Prince of Wales when he
camel Were we iuliospitaDle to the English
sailors who came to the Columbian cele
hration? Do we refuse to be entertained by
English actors, or to read Knglish books? We
have our Jingoes, but the Spectator knows
Jingoesâ it has them at home. Perhaps some
of our Bchooibooks need rewriting; that will
come. Do our young women frown on Eng
lishmen. (iood grncious, good Spectator, we
are not hostile, \vt- are merely coy ; coy becauso
we are conscious of tendencies that require
restraint. Take comfort about us, friend. If
we were half as attractive to you as you nud
your country are to 111 you would "visit us

Some beautiful specimens of half-tone
work bring the contents-list of the Cos
mopolitan to a close.
Srribnor's.
Scribner's opens with a history of the
late Lord Leifhton, by Cosmo Monk
house, which derives additional interest
from the fact that it was already in type
when the new- was received of Sir Freder
ick Leighton's elevation to the peerage at
the beginning of the year; and it was pre
paring for the press when word came oj
his death on January 25. The deceased
Royal Academician himself assisted in
choosing the subjects for illustration. J.
M. Barries novel, "Sentimental Tommy,"
is continued in its serial form. The re
vival of the Olympic carnes at Athens is
admirably treated in an article by Rufus
B. Richardson. Richard Harding Davis
contributes to this issue a short
complete story entitled "Cinderella." The
"History of the Last Quarter Century in
the United States," Professor E. Benjamin
Andrews, is brought down to the events
of the panic year 1893-94. The writer dis
cusses the closing of the mints by the
British Indian Government to tbe free
coinage of silver, and its effect upon the
commercial world both here and in
Europe. The Pullman strike, which crip
pled railroad travel in America, is well
covered, and in a manner particularly in
teresting to citizens of California.
Professor Andrews handles the Southern
Pacific Company in a rather rough-shod
manner, narrating many Instances of how
nstute merchants have contrived to beat
that company and its allied corporation,
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Of
the Valley Kdilroad he has this to say:
"The experiment (of a competing road)
was watched with de?p concern owing to
the fear that this young plant, should it j
mature, would go the way of preceding
roads into the clutch of the 'Octopis." j
Though a careful plan was devised to pre- \
vent this, by placing the shares of the new j
corporation in the hands of a trustworthy
trust, acute student" of the movement and
of the events leading to it believed that |
nothing short of a governmental or State
railway system would meet the require
ments of California."'
There are two other important articles
in the April "Scribner's" which are wor
thy of particular mention : one entitled
"The Ethics of Modern Journalism." by
Aline Gorren, and "The Quarrel of the
English-speaking Peoples," by Henry Nor
man, who recently acted in the capacity of
Wabhington correspondent for the Lonuon
Chronicle.
Harper's Monthly.
"Harper's" for April opens "with a con
cluding installment of Louis de Conte's
"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc."
"The Voice of Authority," by E. A. Alex
ander, is the story of i Nebraska girl's
experience in Paris. Katarina Trask has
a piece of religious verse entitled "A Night
and Morning in Jerusalem." The serious
side of a university man's life is dilated
upon by Henry T. Fowler in a well-written
article tinder the heading, "A Phase of
Modern College Life." The illustrations
of Mr. Fowler's articles show Murray
Hall, at Princeton; Dwight Hall, Yale;
Stiles Hall, at the University of Califor
nia, and Barnes Hall, Cornell, all being
devoted to purposes of a reiigious or seini
religious character.
George W. Smalley discusses the im
portance of Mr. Lowell's residence in
London. He came to that city, Mr.
Smailey thinks, "the man he had been
all his life longâ a man of books and of
literature, a thinker, a dreamer, a poet,
alnsost a recluse." He cared not at all for
society, and during the first part of his
life in London "he would hardly accept
an invitation which was not official and,
therefore, compulsory." A great student,
Lowell was not mucn of a judge of char
acter till he discovered that "London
society was * * * a kind of microcosm,
or the whole world in little."
One cause for the interest Lowell aroused
in London was the intensity of his Ameri
canism. About this, Mr. Smalley remarks:
"It was not merely that the flavor of it
was piquant, and that London is ever
eager for new sensations. It was still more
that this trait was so obviously genuine,
and genuineness is a part of character
on which the English set a high value.
There may have been Americans who
thought they could make their way in
London by renouncing their Americanism,
or by disparaging their own country. If
so, they knew nothing of the English
before whom they abased themselves. If
ever Lowell's large charity grew strict, it
was for such as these."
There is much work of real interest in
Mr. Smalley's article, which is probably
the star feature of this month's Harper's.
Other interesting contributions, besides
tbe regular departments, include:
"The Final Word," a poem, by Alfred H.
Louis; "The Voice of Authority," a story, by
E. A. Alexander; "A Spring Flood in Broad
way," a story, by Brander Matthews; "Mad
Anthony Wayne's Victory," by Theodore
Roosevelt; "On Snowslioes to the Barren
Grounds," by Caspar W. Whitney; "Briseis ." a
novel, part V, by William Black; "Lite," a
poem, by Julie It. Ltppmann; "The German
struggle for Liberty," part X, by Poultney
Bigelow; "A Dream," a poem, by Margaret E.
Bangster; "The Missionary Sheriff," a story,
by Octave Thanet.
Lippincott'fi.
The complete novel in the April issue of
Lippincott's is "Flotsam," by Owen Hall.
The scene shifts from England to India
and Australia, following the fortunes of a
heroine who through a severe experience
at sea loses track of her past life, so that
her identity is established only after many
months and much difficulty. "The Vivi
section ist,' by Carolyn Wells, describes
the conduct of a novelist whom no scruples
deter in the search for literary material.
Lieutenant Thomas 11. Wilson, in "Be
tween Reliefs," tells of a not wholly un
rig ntfous revenge. "On the War-Path
with Kit Carson," by William Thomson,
is a true story, and so probably is "Dream
ing Bob," by' Dr. Charles C.Abbott. The
incidents of the first occurred on the Cali
fornia trail in 1850; those of the other
more recently in New Jersey.
"The Drama of One Hundred Acres," by
Calvin Dill Wilson, is an imaginative
sketch of the development of an Ohio
farm. Ellen Duvall, in "An Old Testa
ment Drama," comments on the tale of
Naaman the Syrian. I. J. Wistar, in a
brief article on "Penal Administration in
Pennsylvania," tells what has been done
and what may or should be done in the
way of prison reform. O. L. writes of
"Holy Week in Mexico," and Cleveland
Moffett of "Paris Swindles." K. G. Robin
son recalls the case of "An Expensive
Slave" in Florida, who caused the war of
18:15-39 and the loss of 1500 white live?.
The poetry of the number is by Susie M.
Best, Mary Bradley and Madison Cawein.
An illustrated supplement, by Anne Hol
lingsworth Wharton, treats of "The
Wellingtons in Virginia Life," and tells
much about the early life and legendary
love affairs of the Father of his Country.
The Forum.
The Forum has for its leader this month
a noteworthy paper by .Senator Sherman
entitled "Deficiency of Revenue the Cause
of Our Financial Ills." The Senator con
tends that the President and Secretary
Carlisle mistake the cause of our present
linancial condition in attributing it to the
demand tor gold for United States notes,
and he thinks that the facts which he
submits in his paper will convince
every one that the true financial policy
is to supply the Government with
ample means to meet its current expendi
tures and to pay off each year a portion of
the public debt. He criticizes the Wilson
bill very severely, declares that it has pro
duced a deficiency every hour since its
enactment, and attributes our linancial
ills â especially the continued exports of
goldâ solely to its workings. lie say-; that
he prefers a law that will impartially pro
tect and encourage all home industries,
and he considers the McKinlej law inti
j nitely better than the Wilson law. The
i Right Hon. .lames Bryce, M. P., author of
l that most popular ana successful work,
1 "The American Com no on wealth," has
written an article entitled "Two South
African Constitution*" â an elaborate anal
ysis of the systems of government in the
two South African republicsâ the Trans
vaal and the Orange Free Stnte. Professor
Arthur W. Wright of Yale University,
who lias lately conducted some leniark
ably successful experiments- with the '*X"
rays, writes about "The Cathode Ray â Its
Character and Effects."
BCcClore'a Magazine.
McClure's April number has for frontis
piece an excellent portrait of Professor
Roentgen, whom the German Emperor has
within these few days made a baron for
his marvelous discovery of the cathode
! rays, and the leading article is almost the
j lirst account yet given of Professor Roent
! gen as seen in his own laboratory in the
! actual conduct of his experiments. The
â  new Anthony Hope romance begun in this
number promises to supply the most at
; tractive company of people and the most
enthralling series of adventures that the
fruitful author of "The Prisoner of Zenda"
has yet created. An account of Lincoln's
courtship and marriage based on the tes
i tiniony of intimate friends of his still liv
ing completely disproves a shameful story
! accepted by some of the. best biographers
i that Lincoln once subjected the lady who
afterward became his wife to the unsneak
: able humiliation of absenting himself
; without warning or explanation on an
I occasion appointed for their marriage.
Along witn this is given an account ot a
debate, with passages from a little known
speech of Lincoln's, wherein he had Doug
has for an opponent and completely dis
! comfited him, twenty years before the bis-
I toric debate of 1858. The pictures are
abundant and apposite.
Meehaiis' Monthly.
Meehans' Monthly seasonably has for its
Prang colored plate a representation of the
beautiful blue Kocky Mountain Colum
bine. The columbine history is as inter
esting as the plate. It appears that the
botanical name, aquilegia, is not given as
our botanists teach us, simply from its
resemblance to an eaele, but it commemo
rates the beautiful daughter of Jupiter of
that name who died for the love of Gany
mede's beautiful bird. Treating of bees
and clover, the conclusion is reached that
they are non-essential in the production of
seed. The proper potting of window
plants is prettily illustrated. In a two
column article the history of cotton in our
country and the phases of the cotton in
dustry in the South to-day are discussed.
Over 3,000,000 spindles are running in the
South to-day. Dean Hole, who, like many
foreigners, has recently "booked Amer
ica," gets a snubbing for his enjoyment of
vulgar tastes. Specimen copies are fur
nished gratis by the publishers, Thomas
Meehan it Sons, Germantown (Philadel
phia) Pa.
The Centtiry.
Tlie Century for the coming month is a
richly illustrated number. It contains
many beautiful engravings, the most
notable being those used to illustrate Pro
fessor Sloane's history of Napoleon. Pro
fessor Allan Marquand of Princeton
University contributes an article on the
"Old Olympic Games." This is timely in
view of the forthcoming revival at Athens.
"Four Lincoln Conspiracies" is the title
of an article by Victor Louis Mason of the
War Department which contains a large
amount of new matter relative to the as
sassination of the President.
In "Plain "Words to Californians" an ap
peal is made to public-spirited citizens of
California to support the effort of John
Muir, the Alaska and Sierra explorer,
to procure the recession to the United
States of the Yosemite Valley so that it
may be merged in the Yosemite National
Park, which surrounds it, and which
under military control has regained its
beauty and value as a conservator of the
water supply for agricultural regions in
the San Joaquin Valley.

Frontier; or Nepal, the Gurkha's Myste
rious Land," and is being published in
London by George Redway.
Baron Ferdinand Rothschild, whose
literary tastes are well known, has written
a series of anecdotal sketches relating to
French history. They are being published
by Messrs. Macmillan under the title,
"Personal Characteristics From French
History." Some of the people dealt with
are Jxniis XIV, Louis XI, Francis I,
Mme. de Pompadour, Cardinal Mazarin,
Voltaire, Marie Leczinska and Cardinal
Richelieu.
The coming publications of Messrs.
Routledge include a book entitled "Dr.
Jameson's Uaid: Its Cause and Conse
quences." The volume, which is almost
ready, la written by the Rev. Mr. King,
and is an impartiaraccount of all the cir
cumstances connected with this affair.
"William Black's new novel. "Briseis,"
will be published by Messrs. Sampson Low
about the end of April. Almost immedi
ately the same linn will have ready
R. D. Blackmore's volume of stories,
"Tale 3 From the Telling House." There
are four stories.
Clement Scott, the leading dramatic
critic of the London Daily Telegraph,
wrote his lirst criticism on "Romeo and
Juliet" in IS6S. i?ome of his notable
plays are "Diplomacy," "Off the Line."
"Cape Mail" and "Peril." "TheMidahip
mite" tfi one of his popular songs.
A marole statue to Lord Byron has been
unveiled at Athens, presented to the city
by Mr. Demetrius Stefanovic Schcylizzi.
The suggestion has been made that a
miniature of the work might appropriately
be presented to any one who can pro
nounce the donor's name without sneez-
ing.
With the April number ends the first
book of the Lark. The price of single
copies of the Lark will be hereafter 10
cents. Wings will be added in the form of
an extra cover sheet to contain advertise
ments and announcements, by which
financial aid the Lark may fly another
year. All business letters and orders |
should be addressed to William Doxey,
631 Market street, and personal communi
cations and manuscripts to Gelett Burgess,

Bangs <fc Co., New York auctioneers,
have issued a forty-page catalogue of a
choice lot of original manuscripts and au
tugraph letters of celebrated American au
thors, including what is claimed to be an
unsurpassed series of letters and MSS.
from the pen of Edgar Allan Poe, all
of which will be sold at auction on Satur
day, April 11. It will be interesting to see
whether Americans can be counted en to
pay as liberally for American literary
relica as Britons do for similar treasures of
British origin.
An interesting feature of the April
Ladies' Home Journal is a series of hith
erto unpublished letters from Louisa M.
Alcott to "five little girls" residing in
Pennsylvania. In thÂ«se epistles the
author of "Little Women" is said to have
most delightfully revealed her extraor
dinary nature, She takes her young cor
respondents into her closest confidence,
anu writes them of her work, her re
muneration, her daily life and cares, of the
influences that directed her to literature,
of her spiritual belief and faith, her views
upon immortality, with passing reference
to spiritualism ana kindred topics. They
begin in 1873 and continue at intervals un
til a short time preceding Miss Alcott's
death. One epistle, in which the beloved
author deals at length with religious mat
ters, is of singular interest, as it presents
her view upon the immortality of the soul.
Womankind for April is a creditable
number, containing a great variety of in
teresting matters that will prove enter
taining and instructive to the reader.
As "Lounger," in the New York Critic,
observes, Miss Harriet Man roe must look
upon the World's publication of her
Columbian Ode before the appointed time
with somewhat mixed sentiments. An
ode that can earn for its writer $0000 is an
ode worth writing, and that is just wt at
Miss Munroe's ode has done for her. She
was paid $1000 by the Columbian commit
tee, and now the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals has just ordered the New
York World to pay her $5000 for printing
the ode before it became public property.
,T. Norman Lockyer, the well-known
writer on scientific subjects, has, in con
junction with W. Rutherford, written a
handbook of golf for beginners. It will be
published by the Messrs. Macmillan.
In "A Few Memories," the autobiog
raphy of Mine, de Navarrq, better known
as Miss Mary Anderson, will be included >
portraits byO. F. Watts, G. H. Boughton j
and F. Millet. The Messrs. Harper will
publish the book toward the end of the
month.
According to the Westminster Budget,
Mrs. Craigie has announced her decision
not to write any more stories of the type
of "The Gods, Some Mortals and Lord
Wickenham." Her next novel, "The
Herb Moon," is of a very different stamp,
the heroine being of a noble type of ;
womanhood. A correspondent who has
read the creator part of the story expects
that it will add considerably to Mrs.
Craigie's reputation.
The effects of Paul Verlaine consist of
some papers in a table drawer, a bundle
of MSS in a handbag, anotherâ the work
he was engaged on last- in the portman
teau which was presented to him the day
before he went to London in 1893, half a
dozen clay pipes and a clay cigarette
holder, two pairs of eyeglasses, a hat and
a nightcap.
Matthew Arnold's early poems, "The
Strayed Reveller" and "Empedocles on
Etna,' ; with some other verse by him, are
to be issued in Walter Scott's Canterbury
series.
The announcement is made that the So
ciety of the Philistines has arranged with
Walter Blackburn Harte, the editor and
publisher of the Fly Leaf, Boston, Mass.,
to acquire and incorporate the Fly Leaf
with the Philistine. Under this arrange
ment the services of Mr. Harte will be re
S. R. CROCKETT.
tamed by tne society, and he will hence
forth devote his time and efforts to fur
thering the interests of the Philistine and
the Koycroft Printing Shop. After April
1 Mr. Harte's address will be hast
Aurora, N. Y. All unexpired subscrip
tions to the Fly Leaf will be rilled by the
Philistine.
Tyndall's Alpine book, "Glaciers of the
Alps," which gives a narrative of excur
sions and ascents made by him, is to be
reissued. It has been out of print for
years, and Mrs. Tyndall has written a
preface for the new edition. Messrs. Long
mans, who announce it, also promise Mr.
Lecky's historical work, "Democracy and
Liberty," at an early date.
A curious volume will soon be published
dealing with the cafe concerts, the circuses
and the showmen of Paris. The text is by
Georges d'Esparbes, Andre Ibels, Maurice
Lefevre of the "Chien Noir" aDd Georges
Montorgueil, all of them writers who are
known as specialists on the subject. The
book will contain a number of illustrations
by H. G. Ibels.
Max Pemberton'B diary of a valet, which
he now entitles "A Gentleman's Gentle
man," will be issued at once by Messrs.
Innes.
It appears that Saint Thomas d'Aquinas
was an anti-Semite. Such, at any rate, ia
the contention of the Abbe Gayraud, who
iÂ« about to publish a volume in support of
his views: "L'Antisemitisme de Saint
Thomas d'Aquin."
The Roycroft Printing Shop announces
a sister book to the "Song of Songs,"
which is Solomon's. It is the "Journal of
Koheleth," being a reprint of the Book of
Ecclesiastes with an essay by Elbert Hub
oard. The same Romaneaque types are
used that served so well in the songs, but
the initials, colophon and rubricated bor
ders are special designs.

THE most graceful and comforting
dramatic announcement made
this season is that the Columbia
Theater has engaged Elenora Du?e
for part of June. She is a marvel
ous artist, this sad, homely, unpretentious
Italian, whose art Has grown to a great
extent out of her disappointed life. Duse
was an idol for years in Italy before the
rest of the world discovered her, and by
the time that universal fame began to
become hers, she was ready to say, "This
also is vanity." Behind the scenes her
life had been as great a failure as her stage
career had been a success. From' her very
Buffering, However, much of Duse's mar
velous art springs; she has learned to de
spise the pomps and vanities and shams of
the world, and as a conseqence has flung
aside posing and artistic bravado. So
natural does she dare to be that as you
watch her you are reminded of your own
observation of every-day life. And how
many mummers are there who give you
this impression? It is hard to remember
one, except Duse. Paul Schenther, a great
German critic, says of the Italian actress:
"A human being! That is the final im
pression of almost every one of Duse's
performances." The probability is that
after seeing Duse, this City will experience
a revulsion of feeling against the stilted,
declamatory ladies and gentlemen who
are too often put forward as "exponents
of the legitimate drama."
A "turn" entirely new to the vaudeville
business has been introduced at Grover's
Alcazar. It is called "Passing Events,"
and consists of an illustrated lecture on
the most thrilling event of the week. The
Abyssinians lirst held the stage, but as
they were found to be too remote to arouse
much intere-t, these dusky warriors were
withdrawn to make way for representa
tions of Dr. Brown, Mrs. Davidson, Miss
Overman et al. A gentleman, who had
evidently studied the pulpit style of ora
tory, accompanies the pictures with didac
tic remarks, and at the opening perform
ance the public do not seem quite :o know
whether the address was to be listened to
with respect as a moral lec.ure, or was to
be derided as a piece of buffoonery. As
the gentleman progressed with his re
marks, however, the audience evidently
decided that the pictures were being shown
more to adorn a tale than to point a moral,
and some of the views were greeted with
loud hisses, while others called forth un
qualified applause.
The Orphpum has a very remarkable
ventriloquist in Se_ommer. It is a pity
that he considers it necessary to season
the first part of his performance with
horse-play, for the skillful manner in
which he endows his stageful of marion
ettes with speech is enough of itself to win
him the admiration of the gallery boys.
Baldwin Theater.
The old California favorite. James
O'Neill, will open a two weeks' season at
the Baldwin Theater to-morrow night.
His career ha 3 been a long and interesting
one. Years ago, when he appear, din
"The Passion Play" in this City, heat once
jumped into National fame and was one of
the most discussed and abused actors of
the period. His long reoord with "Monte
Cristo'' followed; in vain did O'Neill try to
produce other plays, such as the "Dead
Heart," "Tne Envoy," etc. ; their success
was only mediocre and ' -Monte Cristo"
continued to he his mascot. At last
O'Neill resolved to return to tragedy,
which had been his lirst ambition, and ne
produced "Virginias" with marked suc
cess.
Tbe play winch Mr. O'Neill produces
under its original title of "The Courier of
Lyons" has been acted successfully by
Henry Irving for many seasons under the
name of "The Lyons Mail." Dubose, the
villain, and Lesurques, the honest mer
chant, are the two central characters. A
fatal resemblance exists between Dubose
and Lesurques, and the latter is accused of
a murder which the former committed.
The fact that Mr. O'Neill plays both char
acters necessitates his presence on the
stage during most of the performance.
The supporting company includes Florence
Rockwell, Kate Fletcher, Josephine Foy,
Marie Floyd. Halle tt Thompson. William
Paaooe, John F. de uez. W. J. Dixon, F.
G. Lingham, Thomas McLarney, Percy
Cooke, Herbert Fortier and Ralph Lan^.
The repertoire for the first week has been
arranged as follows: Monday night, which
it* to be souvenir night, "Monte Oristo"
â¢will be presented; Tuesday, "Vir<:inius";
Wednesday, M ThÂ« Courier of Lyons"';
Thursday, "Monte Cristo"; Friday,
"Hamlet"; Saturday matinee, "Vir
ginias"; Saturday and Sunday nights,
"Monte Cristo."
California Theater.
The last week of the Milton Royle Com
pany at the California, which opens to
morrow night, will be devot'd to a revival
of the comedy-drama, "Friends." T..e
play, which was Edwin Milton Royle's
first success, will be produced by the per
formers who have been producing "Cap
tain Impudence."
The part of Adrian Karje, the pianist in
"Friends," will be played by Lucius Hen
derson, a favorite pupil of Joseffv, who
recently appeared with success upon the
concert stage in New York. He bad the
advantage of studying with the great
Josefly while that eccentric genius was
obstinately remaining in retir?ment in
order to work ten hours a day at the
piano. Once a week Joseffy took an ad
vanced class at the National Conservatory,
and Lucius Henderson had the rare ad- j
vantage of being one of its members.
"Friends" at the California Theater will |
be followed by Peter P. Dailey in his farce
comedy, "The â : Night Cierk," which was,
written especially lor him by John F. Me-
Nally. Fine ;-owns and pretty girls are
cited as b ing tbe chief attractions of the
production. . â 
Columbia Theater.
The second and last week of "Sinbad"
opens at the Columbia Theater to-morrow
Dight. The production has proved a de
cided success, in suite of the absence of
several familiar names Irom the cast, for
THE
THEATRES
it has been found that the new-come: s
were folly equal to the requirements of
their roles. The book of ''Sinbad" has
been revised and brought up to date, ami
the costumes and scenery are as new and
gorgeous as ever.
On the 6th of April "Pudd'nbead Wil
son" will make its lirst San Francisco ap
pearance at the Columbia Theater. The
play is a dramatization by Frank Mayo of
Mark Twain's story, rmd it possesses
special interest from the fact that Mayo
first gained fame as an actor in California,
while Mark Twain is also identified with
tne State. "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was
first produced, less than a year ago, at the
Herald-square Theater, New \ork, and
proved an immediate success. In the com
ing production Mayo will play the title
role, supported by the same cast.
Grand Opera-Houge.
A French melodrama adapted from the
original of Foumier & Meyer by the clever
author-actor Louis Imhaus will be the at
traction for the week at the Grand. The
work is called "The Red Pocketbook" and
is said to abound in interesting situations
and clever dialogue. The story takes the
audience back to the days of the fifteenth
Louis of France, with ail its artificiality o:
court life, gorgeous costumes and artistic
accessories, so that the plot might lack
none of the interest which it is said to pos
sess and still prove attractive from a his
torical and spectacular standpoint.
The cust is a very large one, some fifty
odd people being encage.l in the produc
tion, half of whom have speaking parts.
Miss Minna Ferry, a recent debutante at
the Columbia, is" to appear in "The Reii
Pocketbook." Among the mechanical ei
facts announced are a novel ship scene, a
storm with new electrical accompaniments,
a desert scene with a moving caravan and
other touches of realism. The famous
'Monkey Men," Paine and Garbatt, have
been expressly engaged to appear as tÂ«vo
orang-outangs.

anions the most accomplished canines in
the theatrical profession.
The drama. "The Homestead," will be
produced at the Alcazar tins week and will

Mansfield* Friends.
Truly Mr. Mansfield suffers more from
his friends than hia enemies. Here is a
line sample of the kind of rubbish that is
! written occasionally about him and ac
! cepted by some as hne writing: "Ground
i lings disturb him, upstarts offend all na
| ture for Mansfield, and incompetents coax
j him perilously near the murderous turn.
His brain, his nature are bo large, so
spirited, so exalted, that it is not the huge
oppositions or tragedies of life that enrage
him, but the witless, contemptible things
which stick pins into his pulsing horizon
of achievement and blot the glow of exist
ence for him."
"To stick pins" into Mr. Mansfield's
"pulsing horizon" is a flight of fancy on
the part of his admirers which deserves to
be recorded side by side with the best
things ever written by Josh Billings or
Mark Twain. It would be very difficult to
invent a metaphor in which the sublime
and the ridiculous are in closer contact.
Some of Mr. Mansfield's friends, like
some of his speeches, should be sup
pressed. They are a positive detriment to
him.
WANTS A CONSERVATORY.
| How Bernhardt Was Startled on Her
First Appearance in America.
Sarah Bernhardt has written to the New
York World pleading for a National
' American conservatory. This is how
i Sarah puts her case :
"I am making my fourth tonr in Amer
ica. The extraordinary progress of this
public has astounded me.
"When I came here first, some sixteen
' years ago, I made my debut as Adrienne.
! At the end of a few minutes I was discon
! certed and alarmed by a strange noise.
Five minutes later the same noise dis-
t urbed me. It sounded like the dull and
muffled hissing of a multitude. I heard
i the sound a third time, and at last I
understood what had been troubling me.
The ladies in the house had all come
armed with copies of the play, and as they
! turned the leaves they made the rustling
1 sound which seemed so terrible.
"On the occasion of my second visit to
! this country, some ten years aeo, aboat
' half the women in my audiences began to
' dispense with books.
"When, lor the third time, I appeared
i here, at most ten or fifteen of them had
brought copies of the play with them ; and
I this year not one woman â not a single
; oneâ had any need of books. This seems
: to me no less remarkable than admirable.
"I have t>ern taxed with being very nar
-1 tial to America. I see no reason to* deny
i that I air. heartily in sympathy with thfs
i free, vigorous, vibrant j eople, which is
!so quick to welcome new inventions.
science, art and genius, irrespective of
their origin.
"Yes; I ndore this country, in which
i woman reigns and reigns so absolutely.
i She comes and goes. She orders, wills,
exacts, instructs, spends money recklessly i
and irivt's no thank?. This shocks tome
people, hut it only charms me. What is
more idle than a 'thank you?' As if one I
were not thanked enough by the mere
pleasure that one gets in doing service to
a woman !
"Ah, American women are fortunate!
"A very i retry woman whom I met here
in society â she was renowned not only for |
her beauty, but al-o for her wit and ;iter- j
ary gifts â once broke out with this icrr.ark:
"'But, Mme. Bombard*, we think we are
too much ' respected. Our husbands work
incessantly, from morning till night.'
"Trie intelligence of your worn on lias as- |
serted itself in a surprising way. Your i
women know a great deal, and what they j
do Know they know thoroughly. They !
are less superficial than we are; and, |
though they discuss dress so much, they
dream of serious things. Many of them
are journalists or doctors. And. unlike
our own viragoes, who shriek for women's j
rights until they make themselves ab
horred, they contrive withal to be true I
women.
"1 regret that you have no conservatory
here ( as yet. Many of your men and i
women only need a little training to be- j
come good artists. If you had a conserva
tory in America there would be no room
here for foreign companies, and some of
your young actresses woul i soon develop
into 'stars' of the first magnitude.
â¢_ "Nearly all of them are pretty and attract
ive. Their tendency to overact might
easily be cured. A little training, with
their natural grace and love of the esthetic
to help it, would enrich America with the I
best artists in the world. 1
'â¢How is it that there are not a few rich, '
influential people here to found a con-
Be; vatory ? i
"I do not know if I shall ever come back .
to America, but if I do I most devoutly i
hope my dream will have been realized.
"In the name of your young artists i cry
out for a 'A conservatory, a conservatory 1'
"I make this appeal for the sake of the
American stage, which should and could
support itself. I make it on behalf of
American literature and of American
authors, some of whom, despite their real
and striking talent, cannot now get their
plays interpreted. I make it, lastly, in the
name of this public, which is longing
to applaud its own artists and its own
i writers. Sabah Beknhakdt."

The Press Cries for Wagner and More
Wagnerâ Damrosch's German
Operas.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 21.â 1n ad
dition to the operatic season, which in
itself is sufficient to occupy the attention
of the musical portion of the population
of New York, there is a constantly swell-
ing flood of orchestral, chamber, vocal
and other concerts. At present the inun
dation is such that the wonder is that the
city is not quite submerged.
Not only is there a weekly symphony
matinee and concert given alternately by
the Philharmonic Society, under Anton
Seidl, and the Symphony Society, with
Walter Damrosch as leader, but every four
weeks the Boston Symphony Orches
tr.". play at the Metropolitan Opera-house.
And now comes Theodore Thomas with
his Chicago orchestra, booked for a # series
of seven performances, also at the Metro
politan. An idea oi the labors of the
orchestral musicians during these
especially trying times may be obtained
from tne fact that the gentlemen of tiie
Damrosch Opera Company during the
Txist forty-eight hours nave given two
symphony concerts and two heavy operas.
1 Ins evening there are two orchestral con
certs >:oing on, at the Metropolitan and
Carnegie Hall, under the direction of
Thomas and Damrosch respectively. As
it was impossible to get a iair idea of both,
I compromised by attending neither, a
negative procedure for which a tine per
formance of "Die Goetterdaemmerung"
this afternoon peculiarly fitted me.
"Tannhaustr," "Lohengrin" and "Siez
fried" have been repented this week and
"Der Freischutz" was given a first and
only hearing last evening. It used to be a
standing joke in Munichth.it if any opera
was "postponed on ac< ourrt of the indis
position of Filn.lhis or Herr That' tiie
manager always shoved in "Der Frei
schutz," for it always "went by itself."
This merely serves to show what an old
standby and universal favorite this truly
beautiful opera has been ever since its tirst
appearance in Germany. The greatest art
ists have sung in it and yet we find that as
a n-?ult of theory of the local press for more
Wagner and more Wagner, not only
the old Italian operas are, for the most
part, ue ervedly done away with, but the
works oi masters like Beethoven, Weber
and Schumann are severely criticized or
even ridiculed.
Those wt.o went to the Academy last
evening with the expectation of listening
to a good prediction of Weber's master- I
piece most have been sadly disappointed,
for it was rendered as though it hud never j
been rehearsed. Indeed, between the acts I
the prima donna was heard practicing her
scales, etc., behind the curtain. The ring
ing and acting of Herr Fischer as Caspar
was excellent, as it always is, but the rest
of the cast were not at ail equal to their re- ;
spect.ve tasks, or if they were the indiffer
ence shown was unpardonable. Herr â¢
Lohse, w..0 conducted, brought out the
effects of the wonderful orchestral score in !
such a manner as to make one wish that
he had as good a band of artists on the j
sta"e.
Walter Damrosch distinguished himself,
this afternno'i by his contracting of Wag- j
ner's crowning "triumph and the virtual]
culmination of his carerr as a composer â j
"The Waning of the Gods," as a friend I
aptly renders "Die Goeiterdaemmerung."
It would be difficult to conceive a more '
dramatic rendering of the part of Brnen- i
hilde than that of Frau Klatskv. The
work of this remarkable woman grows on
one the more she is seen and heard. By
the time she leaves (therj is to be an addi- '
tional week, in which she appears once ',
more as Isolde) there wiil be a sense of j
dcet> regret in the hearts of hundreds of |
well-earned friends.
Alvary as Siegfried was new to me in
fchifl work. What has been said of him as j
Siegfried in the drama of that name ap
plies to him equally in this. He seems as
if made to order f^r the part. If the cer
tainty of his intonation and the evenness
of his phrasing were only equal to the nat
ural beauty of his voice nothing would re
main to be longed for, as his personal
appearance and acting are ideal. Fischer
was the same reliable Hagen as when he
first pave ttie drink of forgetfulness to j
Siegfried at the Metropolitan in 1888.
fraulein Eibenschutz made a sweet Gu
trune and the King Gunther of William
Mertens is the be>t work he has done yet.
The Rhinedar.ehters and the choruses I
were very effective. The scenery, as in all j
productions of this work In America, left a |
great deal to be wished for.
Thursday evening, the 19th inst., I had
the pleasure of listening to a most uniaue
en-teriaiiinient given at Carnegie Hall "by
the Musical Art Society of this city.
This organization consists wholly of vocal
soloists, chiefly church singers, for the
purpose of rendering the works of the
earlier church composers and other choral
compositions which are rarely ueard in
the ordinary concerts, owing to their
diliiculty.
So great is the expense involved (the
chorus numbers hfiy-two high-priced
artists) that but two concerts a year are
possible.
On this occasion compositions by Palev
trina, Lot!i, Felice Anerio and an "Ancient
Eastern Hymn," wonderfully harmonized
by Liszt, iornied the first portion of the
programme. The absolute fidelity to the
pitch observed by all, even throughout
the longest numbers unaccompanied
without falling a shade of a tone, was
astonishing and would be impossible ex
cept with just such a band of vocal vir
tuosi.
Still more trying in a way was the last
part of the programme when Frank Dam
rosch the director, led them through all
the harmonic tortuosities of an eight-part
song, by Peter Cornelius. Here, too, the
encore allowed no falling from the original
key. The quality of tone throughout was
exquisite aud the shading ideal. I could
not repress the desire to hear some time
somewhere, the works of Wagner sung
with such truth of intonation and with
such lovely tone color.

Lights
THE history of the Oakland bai*
bor ligbts is iong and discon
nected. Just when the first bea
con was placed at. the entrance to
the creek is a matter of which
there is no record, but it is supposed to
have been done by some of the whale-
Ferrymen early in the '50s. About
ild boatmen say. there was a IL-hi
â  c end of the then newly dn
channel. It remained in service for a
many years and was lighted with
comparative regularity, but who paid for
mystery. It didn't amount to much,
â nly a pole stuck in the mud, to the
which an ordinary railroad lantern
battled by a cord. But it answered
every purpose, as it remained alight in
calm weather, and no vessel ever at
tempted to go near the locality when the
water was rough.
It was not until I?7*j that any systematic
v as done toward maintaining lights
for Oakland harbor. By this time the nar-
Qge railroad was being constructed,
tannel had been deepened and there
was a rtoal ferry line in operation. The
railroad company put in two lights on
â¢ppbaite sides of the channel, but they
were shifted around for a number of years
according to the way work progressed on
the jetties. When the north jetty had
reached its present stage of completion a
lighthouse was built on a rock that lav a
few hundred feet in front of it. and a red
Btakelight was located an eighth of a mile
back i:i the channel. The Government
â¢ i some of the money for their main
tenance, hut they wore in charge of the
id company, who furnished the
keeper and paid for all materials.
In 1889 the Government took full charge
of the lights and arranged them. It waa
t hat the red light in the channel was
bat confusing, as it lay in line with
other lights further in the harbor. It was
ntinued ana the present light in front
of the sooth jetty established. The large
white light on the rock in front of the
jetty was-changed only a few yards
stward of iis present position. * This
was done as it was intended as a teru
-. rary structure, and it was much easier
to drive piles in mud than to anchor them
to the rock. It is the intention of the
Government to extend the jetties about

< oirgrett has already authorized the work

priate money for the purpose. An effort
is being made to have the work put in
La known as a '"contract." That is,
to have Co&gtess make a permanent ap
propriation of a certain of money to
be drawn each year until the work is fin
ished. Should this succeed there is some
possibility of the work being proceeded

house, which is built on a group of piles,
has a tioor area of 100 square feet. This la
divi-led into four roomsâ one for the log
bell, one for the kitchen and a sleeping
room for each of the keepers. A small
space is cut from one of the rooms to allow
room for a nairway to the light-tower.
This i- -10 feet above low tide and exactly
tne same size and shape as the Goat Island
tower. The lamp is almost a duplicate, it
is of th> lifch order and has leuses made
by Sauuier & Co. of Paris. The lcrnp has
circular wicks and burns mineral oil. The
lenses are made to cover the whole horizon
and the steady white light can be seen
Irom almost any part of the bay, as well
as from Oakland harbor. On account of
the limited space the light-tower has also
to do duty as a iamproom and repair-shop.
In spite of the close quarters everything is
neat and clean and all tools are where they
can be found at a moments notice.
The question of a storeroom was a seri
ous one and remained unsolved fora long
lime, the keepers putting al! extra material
in their rooms. The difficulty waa over

under the house that is reached by a stair
way leading down from the porch. . To
be sure this is not very convenient, but it
gives the keepers a few more feet of space
and somewhat modifies the strong odor of
oil.
Thefugbell machine is located on the same
floor as the sleepinc-rooms. It is made to
run an hour with one winding and gives
one stroke every minute. It is one of the
late patterns of these machines and does
its work easily as well as occupying a
small floor space.
The sooth jetty litht is a "steady red"
twenty-five feet above water and fixed on
the top of a tower of piles. A stairway
leads up from the water to a platform on
which a small house is built for the pur
pose of storing tools, oil and other mate
rial. The lamp is on top of this house and
is reached by a ladder. The lenses are of
the sixth order exactly the same shape as
in the larger lamps. The lamp burns
mineral oil and is arranged with a reser
voir so that it will burn several days with
out attention if necessary. The lens is
pure white, but the lamp is made to show
a red ray by having a chimney of red
glass. lii spite of the amount of light ab
sorbed by the colored glass it can be seen
for seven miles in any direction if there is
no fog.
The Oakland harbor lights are in charge
of C. McCarthy, the same man who first
lighted them in 1890. He has only one as
sistant. Samuel Hounsell occupies that
position at present and has held it for the
last two years. It has been a difficult mat
ter to get men to stay there on account of
the cramped quarters. There is, in fact,
less room' to move around in than there
would be on board a ship, and no man who
had not been a sailor could stand it long.
The work is hard and dangerous at times.
The only way to reach either of the light
houses is from a small boat and in stormy
weather this is impossible. To attend to
the south jetty light is often a difficult
matter. The sea runs high if there is the
least bit of a blow and to make a landing
is an almost impossible task. On several
occasions the keepers have been compelled
to remain there many hours, because the
.sea was too rough to allow them to leave.
On one occasion Mr. Hounsell went over
to attend to the light and had started back
when the sea became 80 rough that he
found it impossible to even get near the
large lighthouse and was compelled to re
main on the bay all night and a part of
the next day. The keepers divide the
night into two wa.U-.hes, a scheme that
works very well in fine weather, but when
it is necessary to use the fogbell it is im
possible to sleep on account of the noise so
close to the bedrooms. Mr. McCarthy and
Mr. Hounsell are both old seamen, and,
while they do not exactly enjoy the mo
notony they are sometimes compelled to
stand, they* say the lite is a pleafiant one
and a great deal safer than being on a
leaky ship._
Trench Sailor's Minstrel.
An official sailor's minstrel is, says our
Paris correspondent, a picturesque inven
tion of M. Lockroy, the French Minister of
Marine. Yann Nibor, the bard in question,
has just returned from a long tour of in
struction. His mission has been to gather
material for new patriotic ditties and to
instill those already composed into the
voices and memories of the crews. Yann
Nibor is the pet of French naval officers on
active service, for they honestly believe that

Whist
[All communications concerning whist, an
swers to problems, etc., should be addressed,
"Whist Editor," Call, City.]
WHEN the original leader
opens the game by leading
any card that is won by his
partner the question arises,
what should the partner
lead in return?
There is no question in whist play that
Mizzles the beginner more than this
one. In the majority of cases you should
at once return your partner's suit â and it
does not mean that you want to trump it.
There are times when you should not do
so, and again there are situations when
you should lrnmediutelytlead trumps; but
how is the whist-player to know these
things? It is very simple when you stop
and think. Not one beginner in twenty
five will ever try to draw inferences from
each card as it falls; it cannot be done in
a second and you should always take time
enousih to size up each play. Do not play
too fast, and do not sit down to play with
any one that will grumble at your playing
slowly.
"When the leader places his card on the
table it speaks volumes, and when it shows
both elements of strength â length and
master cards â and one lead establishes the
sun his partner should lead trumps at once
if he holds three or more; they can be led j
once with absolute safely. Tteonly way
you can Dring in an established suit is to
get trumps out of the way, and it is quite
certain your adversaries will refrain from
leading them when they have reason to
suspect an establis'ied suit against them.
If you hold but two trumps it is better to
return your partner's suit than open a new
one. The original leader will "read the |
drop," which says, "my partner is weak in'
trumps, not more than two, and leaves it
to me to open trumps or continue my
established suit, with a fiood chance of
forcing the strong trump hand."
Again, when the partner wins the first
trick and it takes another round or possi
bly two to establish it. he should return
the suit immediately! unless he has four
ur mure trumps, or has a suit of Ins own
that he knows beyond the question of
doubt is better than his partner's. |
in this case he should open this suit and |
say to his partner â speaking by the card â j
"Abandon your suit and let us try to es
tablish this one, for it is a stronger one
than yours." I do not believe there id a
case on record where two plain suits were
established and brought in at one deal; it
is very seldom you can bring in one long
suit. "But the hardest stumbling block for
the beginner to get over is the trunip
suit le<id. How many times have you
heard this, "Always return your partner's
lead of trumps."
As a general rule it is the proper thing
to do, but there are times wi. en you should
not return it (speaking now of his original
lead of trumps).
For instance, the original lead is a small
trump marking four with leader; partner
wins. He should not return the trump
in this case withe ut grave reasons of his
own for so doing. If lie has a very strong,
plain suit, it is well to at leastlead one
card from it and then return the trump.
If he is very weak in the other three suits
and has only two trumps originally it is
better to switch to a strengtheninc card in
a short suit or even a singleton and not
lead a trump, for one of your adversaries
holds as many trumps as your partner,
and they also have two chances to your
one of having a suit to establish and
bring in.
We think the original leader with five
small trumps and no strong plain suit
should open with the lowest trump in
stead of the fourth best, and if the devel
opment show 3 thore is no strong suit with
the leader or pnrtner it is then a good
time to go in xor a rutting game.
A "lad" that has been going the rounds
and is still in vogue with some players is
making an irregular opening lead from a
short suit to ask for a lead of trumps
through an honor turned. The tricks that
are lost in trying to catch that honor "would
win many a whist match.
A situation that many whist-players
never seem to understand is what finesses
are proper or should be made. "When a
low card ia originally led and partner
holds ace queen and at least one more he
should finesse the queen and lead the ace.
This is the only finesse justified in plain
suits. If holding ace and queen only, play
ace and return queen. The exception to
this is, with very great trump strength
you migit finesse tbe jack from ace jaclc.
It is generally best to let the leader do the
finessing in his own suit. It should not
be forgotten that holding king jack and a
small card led you should play king and
return jack.
Always tell your partner how many
cards you hold in his suit, whether plain
suits or trumps, and do this as quickly as
possible. When a high card is led, hold
ing four or more on his original load, play
your third best first round and second Dest
on second round. Whether the original
lead was from four or rive cards ii? suit, it
enables you to unblock and also to count
the number of cards you hold. This is
not according to "whist authority," but is
our way of doing it and a trick-winner. It
enables your partner to place every card
in the suit led almost to a. certainty after
the second round.
So far we have been the partner of the
original leader. Let us continue and read
what inferences should be drawn from the
leads, from ace down to the deuce.
The lead of in plain suits:
Aceâ Proclaims the presence of king or queen
jack, five or more in suit.
Kingâ Says ace or queen, possibly both, but
only four cards in suit.
Queenâ Marks the king in hand, with possi
bly the ace, but five cards at least in suit, or
queen jack ten, lour or five cards in suit.
Many players of the first class lead ten from
queen jack ten, not that it is a better lead
than queen, but it simplifies the queen lead.
Jackâ is led from king, queen jack and at
least two others. (King queen marked with
leader) Add the ace to the above and the lead
is the same.
Ten is led from king jack ten and others.
Some players lead tho fourth best from this
combination, but N. B. Trist says he sees no
reason for departing from the time-honored
custom.
Nine is led from ace queen ten nine, and
ace jack ten nine; with or without one more
small card we lead the nine. Cavendish says
five In suit lead ace.
Eipht to deuce is led as the fourth best from
all combinations, not including the above.
In trumps the leads vary a little. Our
advice would be to get a little whist book
â they are all good.
When your partner opens the game hesi
tate long enoueh before you play to read
as much of his hand as his lead will tell
you. Don't hurry; if you do you are lost.
We have often been asked this question:
Is a player ever justified in leading a
"sneat" or singleton as an original load?
The answer is, "ever" is a long time.
There is no law to prevent any person do
ing this if he wants to. It could happen
that you would be justified in making sfich
a lead, but the writer never held a hand
that he could say he was justified in so do
me. Now, dear reader, do not confound
this with any other than the original lead
âthe first card played next to the dealer.
No other lead during that game can be an
"original" lead. When the same is once
opened or under way a singleton lead
would be the best you could possibly make
at times and always right and proper,
laughs and sneers to the contrary notwith
standing, when the player uses good judg
ment.

TO GUARD RESERVATIONS.
Four Troops of the Fourth Cav
alry Detailed for the
Duty.
New Trails to Be Opened and Old
Ones Improved in Yosemite
and Sequoia Parks.
The purpose of the Interior Department
to guard the National parks of California
with greater vigilance is manifested in the
annexed communication recently received
by General Forsyth:
Headquarters of the Army, A. G. Office,)
Washington, March 21, 1806. j
The Commanding General, Department of Cali
fornia, San Franasco, Californiaâ Sir: I have
the honor to inform you thut the Secretary of
the Interior huving requested, if compatible
with public interests, that two troops of cavalry
be assigned to the Yosemite National Park and
two troops of cavalry to the Sequoia and Gen
eral Grant National Parks in California, for the
protection of those parks during the current
year, the Major-General Commanding the
Array, under the approval of the Secretary of
War, directs that you issue the necessary
orders for the detail of two troops or four
troops of cavalry, in your discretion, for tins
service.
The Major-General Commanding concurs in
your views as to tbe advisability of designating
the superintendent a month or so in advance
of the arrival of the troops in order to allow a
Buflicient time to send notifications to the
various stock men surrounding the reservations
to keep out of the parks. Very respectfully,
Geo. D. KruGLES, Adjutant-General.
An official copy of the foregoing was
transmitted yesterday to General Graham,
commanding officer at the I'residio, for his
information. General Forsyth, in accord
ance with the above instructions, directs
that Troops B and X, Fourth Cavalry, be
sent to the Yosemite, and Troops C ana I,
Fourth Cavalry, to the Sequoia, in order
that by a division of the duty time may be
afforded to improve some of the old trails
and to open new ones for future use. Fur
ther instructions will follow later.
When General Forsvth visited the
Yosemite and Sequoia National parks last
summer he made an inspection of the res
ervations and was impressed by the insuf
ficiency of trails and the impassable con
dition of many of the existing roads or
paths. It is presumed that a report of his
observations were transmitted to general
headquarters and that the improvements
now authorized were suggested in his re
port.

the United States in the person of James

All the fields a glow with popples,
Poppies on the mils:
Waving, swaying golden poppies,
Poppies by the rills;
Poppies, poppies everywhere,
Blooming in the balmy air.
Aren't they lovely, and isn't it fun to
get right down in among them and feel we
may have as many of them in our arms as
we can possibly hold?
In the great flower parade of the year on
our western coast there is none better
known or loved than the California poppy
or eschscholtzia. There, I didn't mean to
call it that at all; but that's its "big"
name, all the same, but you do not need
to learn it or use it unless you choose. I
can remember so well the day it was in
troduced to me. We were having a spell
ing examination and it .was among the
words and was missed by the whole class.
My, what fun our professor made of us
because we could not spell the botanical
name of our own flower! "We bad to spell
it every day for a week and "I've never
forgotten it."
Amapola and copa de oro are other and
prettier names which have been given to
this brilliant favorite. You'll be sur
prised when I tell you that it is not a true
poppy at all, nor are its flame-painted,
satiny cups kissed by California's sun
alone, for we also rind it in great numbers
in Oregon and Washineton, Nevada, Ari
zona and New Mexico; while the very
largest and most gorgeous specimens are
found on the little island of Santa Cataliua.
From now until fall the orange poppy is
the glory of our hills and fields, dazzling
the eye by its wonderful richness of color
and sheeny brightness as if it were the ex
pression of the store of gold which lies
hidden in the bosom of the land where it i
so freely blooms.
During the fail it lingers along as if loth
to leave, but blooms a very different poppy
than the great, deep orange one of the j
earlier year, growing low to the ground
and having only small, shallow cups of a
light yellow.

There is one little dream of a big sugar-plum,
And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
Of popsuns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
And a trumpet that blowetb!
And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams
With laughter and singine:
And boats en *-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty
gleams.
And up. up, and up, where the Mother Moon
beams.

With poppies that bans: from her head to her feet,

A Country Newsboy.
Living in a town far away from any large
city are four little boys. These little boys
have very happy lives, but the best hour
of the day is when their governess takes
them into their mamma's sitting-room.
I shall tell you how they spend this hour.
These small boys know that about this
time the "donkey boy* comes down the
street with the evening paper. He is
hailed with many a smile and nod while
the one whose turn it is runs out to get the
paper for papa.
But I must not forget to tell you also
how the boy's dog, Snip, greets the donkey
boy. Snip comes tearing around the home
and over the fenct , barking ail the while
as hard as ever he can. Sometimes the
donkey is not very good-natured, and
Snip's barking makes him very angry.
Then you should see him kick! The

donkey boy puts his papers in his mouth
and holds on to the reins as tight as he
can to keep from falling off. The little
boys think that he is very brave, and they
watch their donkey boy until he turns the
corner. Although they are sorry to see
him go, they know that another pleasure
is in store for them, and that is to see the
electric street-lamp lighted. As soon as
its bright rays shine out through the dark
ness the four small boys pull down the
curtains; then, drawing their chairs around
the lire, ask their mamma to sing to them.
After a while we hear "good night," and
our four little boys march to "Bhuteye
town" to play with the "chocolate cat"
and the "gingerbread dog."

A Bunch of Grapes.
Once upon a time, ever so long ago; how
long? oh, about twenty-live or thirty years
ago, one afternoon a kind neighbor sent
Mrs. Wat Kins a basket of luscious grapes.
Ihe little nnes were wild with delight.
California's sunny hillsides ana gentle
slopes are now dotted here and there with
many line vineyards, but in those days
there were very few. so grapes were con
sidered a great luxury.
What a kind man was Mr. Stevens. He
had not forgotten one of the family but
had sent a bunch for each, even for little
John and Mary.
They took theirs outside under the trees
and ate them just as slowly as they could.
wbicb was about as slowly as little piggies
gobble their food.
Alter the last grape was swallowed they
ran back to the house, hoping to get a few
more from their mamma or sister, but
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
they wore not in the kitchen; something
else was in it, though.
Grandma was not at home and mamma
had left the very finest and largest bunch
in the basket on the table for her when
she would return from her walk.
The bright eyes of the children soon
spied it and one of the naughty thoughts
popped into Mary's head, you know the
kind of a thought that always pops out at
the finger-tips.
SHASTA AND THE POPPY.
Have you not seen a little child
Smile sweetly in the face of Age ;
Whose hopeful trust in all mankind,
'Found naught forbidding in the sage?
Â¥Â¥Â¥
So Shasta stands, in purple state,
Snow-crowned and wisely old :
While straight in Shasta' s awful face.
Smiles up this flower of gold.
Cora E. Chase.
Â¥Â¥Â¥
"Let's just take two â one for you and
one for me," were the words which the
naughty thought popped out of the little
girl's mouth.
"All wight," said Jack, and two fine
grapes promptly jumped from grandma's
bunch into the little greedy mouths.
Two more soon followed, theji two more,
still another and another, until all were
gone.
The tiny thieves began to feel a little
sick, and frightened, too. They wished
they had not touched the grapes.
They thought Mr. Stevens was a real
naughty man to do things to make so
much trouble. Then two very quiet babies
stole out through the open door.
"When grandma came back, tired and
warm, after a long tramp over the hills,
mamma felt very glad to tninfc she had
A COUNTRY NEWSBOY.
such a pleasant surprise waiting for her.
So she hurried to the kitchen, her face
beaming with smiles, to get the delicious
fruit which she was sure would prove so
refreshing to her dear mother.
Oh, imagine how surprised and shocked
she must have been when she saw in the
dainty basket only a brown stem ! All the
grapes gone ! Phe sat down on a chair ana
if she hadn't been a big lady she would
have had a good cry. As it was her eyes
did fill with tears as she shook her Head,
saying -"Oh, dear; oh, dear; those two,
those two!"
Of course, when Jack and Mary came
in, or, rather, were brought in, they knew
nothing about it; but the spotted table
cover, ashamed eyes and drooping heads
told another story.
Then two sorry babies stole out of the
room very quietly once more; but they
did not go through, the door which led out
to the silvery stream, the pretty flowers
ana the lovely trees. Oh, no! This time
they went through a door which led to a
room where two little white cots stood.
And now you know that they were pun
ished by being sent to bed in the daytime,
while the creat big sun was still blinking
and winking in the blue, blue sky; and
poor grandma had no nice, cool grapes.

She Only Cracked It.
Little girl goes with her mother to the
grocer's. There is a basket of oranges at
the door. The little girl looks at the
oranges and thinks she would like one.
Her mother being some time in the shop
the temptation becomes too strong and
she takes one and puts it in her pocket.
. Her mother still has not finished buy
ing what she requires and the little girl
has' time to repent and puts the orange
back.
. When the mother comes out the little
girl begins crying and tells her, and then
says:
"I didn't break the commandment,
mamma. I only cracked it."â Youth's

- Room to Cry In.
In Sweden, according to travelers who
have resided in that country, it is a house
hold custom to provide rooms where the
children may go and cry and scream and
make all the noise they need to. In all
other parts of the house they are expected
to be quiet and mindful of the presence of
their elder*. On the whole it seems rather
a good planâ good for the children and
good for â¢ the elders, too. â \ York

THEEE MICE THAT SANG.
Oi^e Now in the House of a Norway
Music-Teacher.
George H. Martin, the veteran music
teacher of Norwich, Conn., says the New
York Sun, has a wonderful singing or
chanting mouse in his home on Williams
street. The mouse is qutie as retiring as
any human musician, and as it kept itself
in the bacKground, inhabiting a crevice in
the cellar, a long time passed before Mr.
Martin knew that he had the prodigy. To
a reporter Mr. Martin said :
"I recently read an article stating the
effect that music has upon different ani
mals, and it recalled an incident that oc
curred in my own household. One morn
ing after playing upon the piano and
singing several songs when the whole
house was quiet, it seemed to me that I
heard music in the distance. I listened
and heard it distinctly, a wee, fine note
like the chiming of a little glass. After a
moment it died away; then it tinkled
again. Now and then it rose a little higher,
and it seemed to me it must be the voice
of a tiny canary in a remote part of the
house. But the song was sweeter than
any canary's, sweeter than any bird's note,
and it was different, too.
"Fora long time I tried in vain to lo
cate the place whence the strains came.
After a while the music ceased, and I gave
it up for the time: But it was not many
days before the singing came again. I
had been playing and "singing as before,
and had stopped suddenly, when for a
second time 1 heard the tiny notes. They
continued for a minute or more, then
ceased, and again 1 sought unsuccessfully
the place where the singular singer was to

weeks, the hidden musician chiming in
with my playing and singing, but success
fully concealing his identity and place of
abode.
"One morninz, finally, right after I had
ceased playing and the little minstrel had
struck up with his own song, I casually
noticed that the cellar door, opening out
of my room, was ajar. I was passing the
portal at the time, and the idea suddenly
crossed my mind that the singer very
likely was secreted in the cellar staircase.
So, without noise, I stepped to the door
and peeped within. At rim I could see
little in tne obscurity of the passage, but,
opening the door a peg further, I caught a
glimpse at last of my musicai friend.
"There, perched upright in the shadow
on the chine of a barrel, sat my singing
mouse, and he was as cool as you please,
singing right along as fearlessly as ever.
He appeared not at all alarmed by my ap
proach. It was plain from the movements
of his jaws and the trembling of his tiny
whiskers that the wonderful musical
strains came from him. I listened a full
minute while the songster went on with
his lay, and then a sudden and unpremedi
tated movement un my part startled my
small friend, and with a whisk of his tail
he darted behind his barrel. After that I
tried to capture the singer, but ineffectu

While singing mice undoubtedly are
quue as rare as white blackbirds, never
theless, Mr. Martin is by no means the
only person who has hoard a mouse sing.
Not long ago a singing mouse was the
wary pet and prime attraction of a grocery
in the seashore village of Mystic, south of
this town. It was a white mouse, too. It
sung usually in the evening, standing
erect on a dusky little shelf above the
molasses barrel at the back of the store.
The notes were as thin and fine and
sweet as the melody struck of! from the
tiniest wind harp. At times the mouse
sang every evening for a week, and again
it was silent for a week or ten days. The
storekeeper was very proud of the musi
cian, which not infrequently, when the
grocer was alone and all was very quiet in
the shop, tuned up a little concert for hia
sake alone. Its best singing, however,
was done on winter nights, when the
great baseburner threw showers of heat
and radiance into every corner of
the store, and the cracker-barrels
there were thronged with stalwart, cow
hided, longshore marines, who forebore
to spin yarns momentarily or omitted
their plug tobacco artillery practice be
cause they wanted to near the mouse sing.
The singing mouse lived in the store for
more than a year. The grocer has notions
that the grocery cat has ideas about its
mysterious disappearance.
Still another singing mouse has been re
ported in the history of the Nutmeg State.
It sojourned in a village dwelling in the
Connecticut Valley, but history has been
culpably remiss in recording this singer'B
accomplishments. In another home in
the valley a mouse built its nest and lived
some time in a young woman's piano, but
the mouse did riot sing.
A Singing Hen.
J. W. Walker of McConnelJsville, Ohio,
has a remarkable hen. Ruby, as she is
called, is a genuine Plymouth Hock fowl,
and she has taken more than one prize for
the purity of her breed and other good
qualities. What is not generally known
about her is that she sines, As soon aa
Ruby hears the sound of the piano she
will "start on the run from wherever she
may be and scamper up the steps and en
ter the house by the door or window as op
portunity serves. She is a great pet with
the only child of the family, and if the lit
tle girl wishes for her company or desires
to display Ruby's talents she will take her
up on the piano-stool beside her, where
from that much prized position Ruby will
hold forth.
She will roll her head from side to side,
croak and croon, sometimes softly and
sometimes loudly, but always following
the music and apparently with rapture at
her own performance. Nor is she soon
tired of singing either.- She will keep it
up as long as the accompanist is willing
to play, and even alter a lengthy perform

long, narrow mail vehicles which are used :
now as "postal cars" on the street railways
of many cities.
The project of the horseless vehicle for
mail matter has been on foot for six
months. General Neilson of Washington
has been working at it and interesting
capitalists. It is not a capitalistic enter
prise by any means. It is a means to as- ;
Btst the Government, but the United '
States rioe-? not appropriate any money ]
"for experimental purposes," and when i
new thins? are to be adopted they mast be i
tried first before the Government will take j
them up. It is the arduous task of finding \
moneyed people to build the horseless ,
mail vraeons and experiment with them, '
that has co long delayed the horseless
postal-car project.
The plan of the nÂ°w motorcycle isacom
riiex and remarkable one. So strange does i
it read that it sounds more like a chapter
from an advanced "Looking Backward" or
a paragraph from "Wonderland" than the
doings of the year 1896. If all works well i
this machine will mark a greater epoch in j
progressive history than the telephone
did and will be second only to the tele
graph and steamboat.
The plan of the motorcycle begins with
a postal car. This, for Washington, will
tea long one; for New York a smaller
one, and for different cities according to
their situation and size. A hilly <-ity, with
irregular streets, can use a smaller oar to
better advantage than a long one. Level
ciiies, with broad streets, can handle a long
car easily.
The Washington car will he twelve feet
long, about six feet wide and <ix feet hieh.
Tin- will mate very good dimensions. The
color will probably' not be white. "I do
not want to say'wbat the color will be,"
said an official of the New York postom'ce,
speaking of the new motorcycle, "but I
gnould say it will be some distinctive
shade that will be handsome, yet tell the
siory of the United States mail service."
The inside of the car will be arranged
like the inside of any mail car. There will
be a counter for sorting the mail, a seat for
the man who sorts, pigeon-holes overhead
and certain strongholds for containing reg
istered and other valuable mail matter.
It will be complete.
The work of the horseless mail car will
begin at the time of starting out. The
motorman will turn the lever that sets the
car going, will place his feet upon the
steering gear and will head for the nearest
letter-box. "Tapping the letter-box" is
the term applied to gathering up the mail
from a box.
It is probable that the driver will "tap"
the box. Through a window he will
throw the mail inside to the sorter, who
will receive it on the fly and go to work
upon it. Meanwhile the car has started
on a keen run toward the next letter-box.
Here it gathers up more mail and tosses it
inside to the sorter, and BO on to all toe
boxes on the route. The sorter meanwhile
is working as fast as he can, and so much
must be said for hi.s agility in handling

When these horseless wagons return to
their headquarters, which in lare;e cities is
a sub-station, or sub-postoftice, the mail is
taken out and placed in the different
pouches to be carried to stations and sent
outward to the different destinations.
Horseless wagons again come into play in
carrying the mail pouches to the trains to
connect with the mail cars.
Such an interest is beine taken in this
new postal delivery by foreign cities that
letters arrive daily at the Washington
postofiice from different parts of Europe
asking what success has been achieved.
and urging the advancement of so brilliant
a thing.
The plan of running the motor-car is a
: simple one. No experienced motorman
will be needed, though before being put in
charge the motorman must show his in
telligence. There will be a lever, which he
pulls to set the car going and which he
reverses to stop it. The steering-gear is
simple.
The cost of operating is slight and will
; save the general p >stoftice enough money
to meet the annual postoffice deficit.
The new motorcycle now being experi
t mented with at Washington is kept as
i secret as possible. Pictures of it are not
j distributed, but enterprising artists have
; caught glimpses of it and have penciled
its design. Within a few weeks it will be
! a common si?ht all over the country, and
will be used as rapidly as new cars can be
built.

Perpetual Motion.
A James County boy is said to have dis
covered the long-sough t-for "perpetual
motion."
The latest claimant for this honor is
Bert Rowell, atred 20 years, who lives on
hi 3 father's farm in James County, about
twenty miles from Chattanooga. He has,
by a comoination of cogs, wheels, springs,
etc., produced a machine which of its own
volition, -without assistance, has been run
ning for several weeks.
When Howell returns from his plow at
the end of each day he finds his little ma

When he arises from his bed in the morn
ing that little mystery is found to be still
at its incessant work, and it keeps up its
movements from day to day as though it
were tryins to annihilate time.
Young Howell thinks he has produced
perpetual motion, and is so jealous of his
secret that he has his machine nailed up
securely in a box, and the only part visible
is a snaft, to which a flywheel is attached.
The wheel never stops in its endless whirl.

Effect of Plants in Sleeping-Rooms.
The question as to the effect of plants in
I sleeping apartments on the health of the
i occupants would seem to have been satis
factorily determined by recent tests at a
London" conservatory. In the latter, con
taining some 6000 plants, in the middle of
the day oxygen had so far increased on
the carbon dioxide that out of 10,000 parts
chemical examination proved only 1.40 to
be carbon dioxide, whereas the normal pro
portion of the purest air is about four parts
in 10,000. After being shut up tome
twelve hours the air in the greenhouses at
noon thus proved to be surcharged with
oxygen. The same air was analyzed just
j before sunrise and the carbonic dioxide
' had so far gained on the oxygen that the
proportion ot it was almost exactly four
j uer 10,000. Taking, therefore, the twenty
â  four hours round, the day is found just
. about to balance the night.
To Have the Right of Way.
More than 100 Chicago physicians have
! obtained permits under an ordinance re
j cently passed by the Council giving them
i the right of way in the streets. The new
departure seems to be popular with the
doctors, and every man who called and
obtained a permit and paid 50 cents for a
little badge with a red cross upon it ex
pressed himself as pleased with the plan.
The ordinance is known as the ambu
lance ordinance. It contains a provision
that every physician having a permit and
displaying a badge to be procured from the
City Clerk shall have the right of way for
hiniselfand his vehicle in the streets as
against all processions, persons, vehicles
or animals when answering professional
calls. City Clerk Van Cleave has pre
| pared a neat badge witu a red cross upon
â  it, with the words: "Physician, Chicago,"
, and the number of the permit.
A Marine Freak.
Secretary Herbert has directed the test
at the New York Navy-yard of a machine
designed to send a vessel through the
water without propellers. It will be fitted
'. in a 28-foot boat, that being the choice of
the inventor, though the department de
sired to use a 104-ioot boat now at the
yard. By burning oil a gas is generated,
which is allowed to enter a cylinder. There
it is ignited by means of a spark. The
fo>-ce of repeated explosions drives the
piston up and down. As a result of the
explosion a jet of air is blown out of a
tube in the stern of the vessel and the re
sistance of the water causes the boat to
forge ahead. The engineering experts say
that the invention, which has been
tried privately, has not given very good
results, and they do not believe it will be
useful for naval purposes. The inventor
claims it will be of service in torpedo
boats and will drive them with phenome
nal speed.
What Cathode Means.
Let us first Bee what we mean by the
term cathode. If we should break the
tiny filament of an Edison incandescent
lamp at the middle of the glowing loop
the light would go out. If, now, we con
nect the two ends of the broken filament to
the poles of a battery of a great many
thousand voltaic cells, such as are com
monly used to ring house-bells, we should
be able to light the lamp again, not by in
candescence, but by a feeble glow which
Eervades the whole bulb. The ends of the
rokeh filament would glow â and the glow
at one end of the filament would be
different in appearance from that of
the other. The broken filament, by
means of which the electrical energy
enter* the bulb, is called the anode, and
the filament by means of which, in or
dinary language, it leaves the bulb, is
called the cathode. Now the great pe
culiarity of the cathode rays is this â they
seem to be independent of the position of
the anode, and they stream out from the
cathode like the beam of a searchlight,
striking the walls'of the inclosing vessel. â

To Foil the Burglar.
The invention of useful trifles has often
been the foundation of large fortunes, and,
to judge by its instantaneous success, the
novelty described here will handsomely
pay its originator. Small enough to
be carripd in the vest pocket, this
little appliance will effectually pre
vent the picking of the lock by a burglar
while it is slipped over the key on the
inside of the door, and at the same time
peeping through the keyhole becomes an
impossibility. These two qualities alone
insure great popularity to the little inven
tion, which is quite simple and cheap.

a watchcase, only a little larger, is cut

lowed to remain upon the inside of the

key is held in position a burglar cannot
possibly throw it into the room; he will
simply fruitlessly attempt to revolve the
key from the outside without the possibil
ity of inserting a skeleton key of his own.

The man quickly replied : "Why, that's

An ingenious little instrument of much
practical value has been patented in
France and is freely sold by cutlers and
silversmiths there. It ia an orange-peeler
of novel form. There are practically three
instruments combined in one â an ordinary
knife-blade along the back of the instru
ment, a short hook sharpened to an edge
on the inside and a little round
edge in the point of the hook. The
oranse is taken in the left hand and the
short hook is then inserted in the rind and
drawn down straight, care being taken to
follow the lines of the sections of the fruit

of the hook cuts the rind, which is
loosened by the hook, and if the points of
the section of skin thus cut are taken be
tween the thumb of the rii'ht hand and
the flat edge the skin is easily detached.
Several oranges peeled in this way and
arranged on a plate make a very artistic
effect on the dinner table.
Various Notes.
Herr Notbe. a German scientist, is said
to have discovered a means of cultivating
the nitrogen-absorbing bacteria which are
the cause of the assimilation by legumin
ous plants of the atmospheric nitrogen,
and he believes that the productiveness of
certain soils can be increased by sowing
these bacteria. As the experiment would
cost the farmer ?2 50 an acre, he is not
likely to try it on an extensive scale.

on the bay, and appears to be a combina
tion of Italian fishing vessel and Chinese
junk. But no matter what it looks like it
is certainly a good sea boat, for it has been
seen on the bay when the surface was a
seething mass of foam, and the waves
were so high the big river steamers would
not venture out. The vessel rides like a
cork, and the sail, with its cumbersome
ribs of wood, has withstood the hardest
gales that ever blew in that locality.
When the weather is fine Charley adds
to his income by making purchases for
people that live along the shore of the
bay. He stops on his way to San Pablo
ami asks what is wanted, and on the way
back delivers it. He is a good-natured
Chinaman, and always has something in
his pocket for the children at the house
w.'iere he stops.
The white people who know Charley say
that he is the strongest man they ever
saw. He will pull his 24-foot boat against
the tide as if it were a 100-pound skiff. The
loads he carries frequently weigh more
than a ton.
He Had It Yet.
"You must not touch the top of the
baby's head," said a mother to her four
year-old boy. "She has a soft spot there
that is very tender."
The youngster gazed at it curiously for
a moment and then asked :
"Do all babies have soft spots on their
heads?"
"Yes."
"Did papa have a soft spot on the top of
his head when he was a baby?"
"Yes," replied the mother, with a sigh,
"and he has got it yet."
And the old man, who had heard the
conversation from an adjoining room,
said:
"Yes, indeed he has, my dear boy, or he
would be a single man to-day." â Spare
Moments.
One Dead.
A good joke happened to a certain doc
tor the other day.
He ordered some very powerful medicine
for a sick boy ; and the father, not liking
the appearance of it, forced it down the
cat's throat.
Wben the doctor called again and in
quired if the powder had cured the boy,
the father replied :
"No; we did not give it to him."
"Good gracious!" said the doctor, "is
the child living?"
"Yes ; but the old cat isn'tâ we gave it to
her!" â Spare Moments.

ANOTHER Lenten week has passed
and Easter is almost here, but
now comes the long solemn
week observed by all the Chris
tian world, and during it no
large affairs will take place, but we will
probably continue to hear discussed the
latest engagements, the reception which
will follow a certain quiet home wedding,
the last luncheon at the University Club,
the most lovely hats seen at the openings,
the merits of small sleeves over large ones
and the hang of the most fashionable
skirts; so topics of conversation are not
lacking.
Almost every day in Easter week is
already crowded with engagements, and
on every side we hear of teas, lunch, card,
dinner and theater parties, and speaking
of theaters reminds me that on Wednes
day the Century Club gave a pretty recep
tion to Mrs. Royle, who has made many
friends in tnis City by her charming and
unaffected manners. This same club has
also issued invitations for its annual break
fast, invitations for it being always in
j:reat demand, as they are always for the
D. A. R. receptions.
I hear rumors of more than one stag
dinner which wiiJ be given in the near fu
ture, but of course such things do not in
terest us. However, the charity concert
will be so excellent, I hear, that all will
readily part with &orne of their ducats to
help tbe good cause. The list of patron
esses makes its success a foregone conclu
sion.
Gowns for bridesmaids and the sweetly
pretty graduates will shortly command
our serious attention, ana one lovely New
York maiden will wear at a wedding
which takes place Easter week a delightful
French gown, composed of a new silk
>;auze wonderfully ethereal in texture. It
looks as though the threads composing ir
were made of woven sun and moon beams.
It is made over a lustrous buttercup satin,
the sleeves being composed entirely of
Marechal Niel roses; they are moderately
large and scarcely reach the elbow. Rose
petals and rose leaves trim the bodice, and
they are used with rare artistic results, as
the whole dress is so delicately beautiful
as to be quite fit for Queen Mab,
but a word picture does it injustice.
"With it will be worn slippers of
yellow satin and a hat made to go with it,
a dream composed of roses, lace and dew
drops, and when have we ever seen such
artificial flowers as can now be purchased?
They are marvels of artistic beauty, and
wonderful are the filagree laces which are
indeed costly novelties, being of gold or
silver which "imitates perfect. y the gold
and silver work of the Deccan and also the
filigraine employed by the lovely daugh
ters of Holland to make their becoming
peasant caps with," and far from Oeing
stiffy it is soft and pliable and falls in grace
ful folds. But to return to my graduates â
the most youthful, those wno still have
& few years of school before them, they
Bhould wear only simple gauzes, organdies
or muslins made up in a youtnful
manner, but for those about to l^ave
college glace taffetas and Dresden
silks are sometimes appropriate with
white or light grounds, as in most
cases after graduation comes the
debut, when a bud is trnly attractive in
snowy white with just arose or so. Young
girls make such a mistake in desiring to
dress like young women who were buds
some six or eight years ago. However,
few girls can be made to realize the fact
that the white muslin, so much talked
about, has a rare and mysterious attrac
tion for almost all men, and I suppose even
the "new girls" have not ceased to feel a
mild pleasure in being admired by the
masculine sex. I will leave the discussion
of the style for such frocks for a week or
so, as then I will be ready with the latest
styles.
All of us who have not as yet secured
our hats and bonnets still feel an interest
in millinery, and Vogue, I see, makes this
week a valuable suggestion : "As women
along the fifties have invariably gray if
not white hair, the proper selection of their
bonnets requires great care, without which
they are in danger of looking loud and
conspicuous. A black lace and jet bonnet
runs no danger of going amiss, neither
does one in black and gold, black and steel
or black and white. But as tulle bonnets
are to be the summer's rage, there is
further choice in dark blue, cranberry red,
ivy-green and orchid mauves. It is under
stood thai they are to be touched up with
lace flowers and ribbons In a way suitable
to mature year?."
A good imported hat for a young girl is
somewhat of the mushroom shape of chif
fon straw of shot heliotrope. Ribbon bows
and outspreading wings are in the center,
while on either side rests a spray of mauve
lilac, and at the back is a bunch of violets.
WhethfT we like it or not we are to wear
our hats well over our foreheads, for the
fashionable cachc-pelgne across the back
of all lame hats pushes them over the eyes,
completely concealing the front hair.
A noted French miiiiner nas just sent
out a larue black hat of sequin covered
crinoline; pleated chiffon ed^es the brim,
and bunches of rose-colored and white
azaleas nestle beneath and upon it. She
also produces a novt-1 effect in a picture
hat by placing black ostrich tips beneath
the brim so as to be visible at the sides.
This hat is adorned with black and cerise
tulle.
Moss green straw blended with black
chenilie is becoming to most women, and
the newest toques are so stylish that they
will be much in demand. For a garden
party one made of cream horsehair edeed
with Valenciennes lace, trimmed with
Binai! bunches of violet and completed by
a large upstanding bow of maize ribbon, is
said to L;e very fetching. Great bows of
chine or point adour ribbon form the
trimming for many a stylish hat in com
bination with a few bunches or sprays of
flowers.
For the ever-useful coat and suit com
bination the principal materials used are
eerge, alpaca and covert coating: however,
bine serge is really the most useful and be
coming, and those who ran afford it are
indulgin-z in the newest and smartest
waistdats, which are made of pleated
tulle, hanging from a bow at the neck.
These are delightful affairs, but even with
tlie greatest care will only last a week, if
worn daily. The best London tailors are
trying hard to introduce the close-fitting
coatsJeeves, but one of the swellest reports
that he recently made two coats with
quite tight sleeve, and had them returned
for large ones to be substituted, and it is
only in tailor suits that the really small
sleeve is likely to be tolerated. In other
gowns the sleeve puffed on the tnp holds
its own, the sole difference in outline con
sisting in the fact that the puff terminates
about six inches above the elbow, instead
01 below it.
An excellent example of the new sack
backed jacket, quite short, is to be ad
mired made in black poult desoie, lined
wit ti black place silk, the yoke striped
diagonally with jet; a kilted ruffle of net
round the neck tails with long ends in the
i^-nr-x; the sleeves have the same tinish at

the wrists. Another model of a loose short
coat has been designed of black satin, with
an applique of watered ilk. The fronts
are very narrow and are outlined with
black satin and display a wide vest of
black velvet with an applique of pearl
gray satin traced with silver, steel and
gold. The lame collar is cut in tabs round
the neck, while frills of lace fall over the
top of the sleeves.
An ideal coat is of the new blue Vene
tian cloth, with vest revers and cuff* of
mushroom-faced cloth, braided in blue of
the same tone as the coat. The lining is
ot a fancy glace silk. Another coat of blue
gros Venetian cloth is inlaid with biscuit
color, the collar being of blue velvet; on
the bottom of the coat the same kind of
Btrappmg is applied.
The Princess of Wales, who certainly
has good taste in dress, has just appeared
in a stylish jacket of fine soft black vicuna
cloth, which is made with very moderate
sized sleeves, the fronts hanging loose
and double breasted, li ve buttons being on
each side.
The truly charming young lady's
dinner dress illustrated on this page is
of pompadour China silk. Low bodice,
pointed in front, and extending at the
back into a short fluted basque of velvet
and brocade. The two tapering strip 3of
moss-green velvet are introduced to di
minish the size and lengthen the waist.
A lace edging borders the low bodice.
Torsades in satin ribbon cross the balloon
sleeves, veiled with silk gauze, and are fin
ished off on the shoulders with floral
sprays. The dark fawn-cloth gown has a
DARK FAWN CLOTu GOWN.
waistcoat of purple cloth, opening over |
white and fastened with tiny pearl but
tons; light fawn iloth revers.
Two bodices worthy of admiration and
imitation have just been completed and |
| both have the sleeves falling soitly from j
j the shoulders and are complete â . with v
deep cuff. The most vivid colors are to be ,
used for home and evening wear, and we ;
are informed that we must, if well up in I
; what is correct, greet warmly the doable '
j bodice, to which I have not yet had the
i pleasure of an introduction, but one is de
li scribed as being of rich red petunia silk i
gathered from the waist and brou ht up i
: back and front to beneath the iirra, but j
I opening sliphtlv in front to show a full â 
! Ottoman soft silk covered with a chine
j design of the same petunia mixed with
I gold on a cream ground. The sleeves, as
i so many sleeves will this season, reach
| to the elbow with a bnttlemented cuff j
i turning upward. From the de=cription a :
I graceful garment for a slight figure, and I j
jam told it will suit the stout also. Of this j
i 1 have very serious doubts.
The new canvas c.'osely resembles crepon, !
but has a smoot er suriace and so will less i
readily catch the dust. This fabric sets I
i remarkably well and is admirably suited !
to the present style of skirt, which a!- j
though it rits closely around the hips the
hem has a considerable circumference, but
it is far more satisfactory now that more j
attention is given to placing the fullness j
properly.
The fashion of trimming with black vel
vet ribbons is a revival of an old fashion
and wiil be the thing th;s year, as it is to j
j trim dresses of every description and has I
been used wiih good results with small !
diamond buckles to stripe a corselet of ]
| turquoise blue cloth, which completed a ;
i dressy turquoise blue, which had a white j
j mousseline de soie fishu. This confection '
I was worn witn a large black hat to a wed
ding and had many admiring glances cast
upon it.
Black velvet ribbons of an infinitesimal
width trim the frills of many of the tichus
which beautify otherwise plain silk waists j
and blouses, such fichus beinj: made of
either chiffon, mousseline de soie or spot
ted net. It is also seen alternating with
frills and insertions of lace forming epau
lettes over plain sleeves and also vests in
tight, short-basqued bodices, but let us
hope that the tas ion may never be re
vived of wearing a band of black velvet
around the throat, for this style, although
becoming to most, causes many a lovely
throat to be orematurely wrinkled, and
black will darken the skin, so here let me
give a word of advice: io tie collar of
THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
your dresses, if they are of any dark fabric,
sew a piece of white silk or white muslin,
for no French woman ever allows anything
dark to come in direct contact with her
skin. 1 exceedingly dislike dark or black
underwear, as white or li^ht colors seem
so much more appropriate, but for those
who wear it, let me assure you, you
will find that it darkens your skins per
ceptibly after a few months' wear.
Baby ribbon worked in a floral design is
! effective, although not new; however.it
! will appear not only on cotton materials,
j but on silken ones as well. Grass lawn so
j treated is simply exquisite and proportion
ately costly.
A bodice known as "the coat of mail"
I is formed of a very fine black straw plaited
! on a tulle foundation, interspersed with
j green, aud silver and gold sequins. At
! the neck and waist of this are bands of
! lime blossom green velvet, and the sleeves
are of crepe de chine. What a truly
unique and Parisian conception! A model
frock of alpaca canvas in dark blue has a
novel trimming of cornflower blue canvas
embroidered in white and lined with yel-
I low. Original also is a bodice of white
! glace silk, with an applique of chintz flow
i ers worked in colored silks and sequins;
j band 3of black velvet complete it at the
â  neck and waist. Purple, violet and helio
: trope are vying in favor with turquoise
i blue, as all such shades so charmingly
| combine with black and white.
Collars are now being sold separately in
| Paris, mounted on straight bands, cut into
â  points to turn down over a ribbon bow or
cravat, or "Windsor tie. The Windsor, the
! genuine article, is extremely easy to mani
-1 pulate and is less expensive than other
: styles, which is certainly a point in its
' favor, as the little extras mount up very
| considerably. Black ties should be of
i twill silk, with pointed ends. For slender
: women the belts of white kid or the belt
\ of suede are popular, as are also those of
! gold galoon, but these latter are suitable
only for more fanciful costumes for in
stance, a dress of the new canvas looks well
witn this touch of gold.
Stout women should avoid belts as much
as possible, only moderate ones of black
satin being at all becoming.
In spite of all contrary predictions capes
and mantles will hold their own, certainly
until autumn. Numerous are the beauti
ful models imported.
Our couturiers are gladly bidding adieu
to the heavy bro< ades, velvets and tapes
tries for ihe delightfully aerial gauzes,
mousselines de srie, dace silks and crepes,
which are certainly more in keeping with
the flowers and verdure. I must not for
get to give you a bit of information which
has just come under my observation in
Vo ue :
"There are some new materials to be
found here at present which almost eclipse
the i-ctais of the t'lossoras from which they
are copied. For instance, I saw a so-called
gauze de printempj so beautiful that it
seemed spun from moonbeams. The
pround is of an indescribably sweet shade
of palest silvery gray interwoven with the
sli litest suspicion of silver threads, ana
highly embroidered with clusters of spring
flowerets done in slender floss silk which
give no sign of having been touched by
human fingers. A gown made of this
gauze was draped deftly over a slip of
shell-pink sole glace fringed out at the bot
tom in imitation of a monster carnation,
and was finished off at the neck, the wrists
and the waist by corresponding ruches of
extreme fluffiness. The hat built to go
with this costume was of drawn pink gauze
covered with a shower of white and pale
lilac violets, knots of which were also at
tached to the corsage. Another and nearly
as pretty a stuff is ihe soie Casino, a very
brilliant and remarkably shimmering silk,
somewhat more consistent than the ordi
nary taffeta glace and adorned with moir
ures in a color contrasting with the ground
of the material.'
Such dress can be owned by but few of us,
but youth and beauty can be charming in
very inexpensive toilettes. This reminds
me that at one of our principal stores the
exquisitely fine organdies which sold ~ for
65 cents last summer are now being dis
posed of at less than ; 20 cents per yard,
and over an old silk evening gown or a
delicately tinted, sateen will be a joy as
long as fresh. Properly adjusted ribbons
make such a toilette positively smart. > '

What a pity that so many are brightening
their hair, they must know that in a brief
time the result of even simple chemicals
will cease producing the desired result,
and stroneer onos will cer.ainly be a

to be grotesquely striped, so bo sensible,

lamentable results.

The monogram and embossed creÂ«t,
which has begun to flourish in San Fran

It is quite shocking to read that women
in England are becoming addicted to
gambling. An example is given of one
who lost, one Sunday evening, about

FOE MEN.
Tne collar of dress coats should be of
cloth. The silk or satin facings of such
coats should be brought to the edge of the
lapel.
Spring suits for men show no radical
changes, but perhaps trie collars of the
waistcoats are to be slightly higher and
the jackets are not to be so long, and
trousers are to remain th â â¢ same width.
The spring overcoats are not so long as
those of last year. Tan covert cloth is
smart, but gray clot i is also in demand.
Suits for spring are seldom of late
made of black excepting for those in
mourning; then either serge or cheviot is
selected.
For a youth of 1G a frocK coat is too old ;
a cutaway of black vicuna or a rough

Extremists only are experimenting with

apropos of shirts, some very stylish material
for them has just been received by a Mont

A tendency to individuality in dress at
the present moment is being very general
ly manifested, and speaking on these top
ics, "Him" remarks:
'"Men more or le3s adopt some little
variation which stamps them. For in
stance, take Crei^hton Webb, lie always
wears white ties. His Ascot* and flat
scan's are made of pongee silk, and his
evening t>s are just of a peculiar width
and length to enable him to arran.e them
in the ore-fa-hioneii bow. Like a number
of men Creighton Webb has his ties made
by a private tiemaker. Other men select
various desijzns or various patterns or
colors. One is a little squeamish about
purchasing a tie which one sees exhibited
at a haberdasher's, because one discovers
that a number of ot er men have the same
thing, and nothing exasperates me so
much as to find some one else with a tie
and a coat like mine. I must and will be
original. I have found, of cour-e, at many
haberdashers quite an assortment of silks
and stuffs from which I can order my ties
to i.c made. "
An attempt is being made to revive the

was an ugly style and should never be
countenanced.

There is a black cat at present in the
sedate seclusion of the Hampton Court
cloisters which has spontaneously '"sworn
off" from all kinds oi flesh food. Its
favorite diet is uncooked scarlet runner
beans, which it cats as an Italian eats
macaroni. Cucumbers it likes, and carrots
which are boiled, out fruit it will not touch.
The Hampton Court cat seems to stand
alone in a partiality for food which none
of its race could hitherto be induced to
ookat.
BAB'S IDEA OF HUSBANDS
She Catalogues Them for the
Benefit of Complaining
Women.
THE KIND MOST WIVES PREFER
It Always Takes Two People to Make
a Married Home Perfectly
Happy.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23, 1896.â
She was a very nice woman. And when I
read the dainty little letter I felt myself
growing taller, and it seamed as if my head
was growing just a bit bigger. Still, it was
rather a pleasant feeling. But what she
asked was a question easily answered,
"Are there any bad husbands?" I began
to think of the different ones. And first
of all there came before me the sullen
man. He's the one who comes home at
night with a growl and wakens in the
morning with a complaint. Neither of
these is loudly spoken, but he mutters
them with his teeth half closed, and his
wife wishes she knew how to make "dear
Charley perfectly satisfied. But dear
C arley is the sort of man who will net
be happy either in heaven or the other
place. At the breakfast-table the chil
dren have been taught not to speak for
fear they will irritate their father, and
at the dinner-table they don't appear at
all, not even when the other sweets come
on, for it is possible he is a little bit
more sullen and a little bit more hang-dog
looking than he was at breakfast. He's
been forced to associate with men all day,
and of course there is always the chance
of a man kicking him if he triÂ°s any of his
nasty business with him, but with the
little woman at home, whom he has prom
ised to love and protect, he feels at ease,
and finds no fault with himself when he
bullies, in hi- horrid, sullen way, the crea
ture that is bigirer and better in* every way
than himself. She can never get an opin
ion from him., a sullen look, words that
are muttered and a "grumpy" manner
being hh every-day conduct in his home.
Which <>f Dante's hells do you think he
will be found in when Gabriel's trumpet
sounds?
Next cam to my mind the fault-finding
man; the man who is never suited; the
man who, if you offer him mutton on
Tuesday night, wonders why it wasn't
served on Friday, and, if you happen to
have it on Friday, is surprised tuat you
didn't remember the cook and serve fish.
He isn't satisfied with your gown, and he
sends you off into a shower of tears by
reminding you of what he thought you
would he when he made love to you. He
forgets how he has changedâ he forgets
that there is no possibility of suiting him.
If you are lively he makes the cheertnl re
mark that all women are gossips and never
stop talking. If you are quiet he wonders
what you are sulking about, and
if you try the happy medium of
mixing chatter and stillness he asks
where you got your wisdom from when
you talk, and he inquires wat
you are complaining about to yourself
when you keep quiet. He finds fault with
the cook, and you discharge her; then he
is surprised that you were such a fool,
with a very expressive adjective before it,
as to get rid of a woman who knew ;he
difference between grouse and pork, and
who could boil water well. He interferes
with your management of the children,
and the result is that they are impertinent
and can never be called good ; but this, of

course, he considers your fault. I think
with pleasure of the fault-finding man s
hereafter. He will ne married, it there is
such a thing as marriage in nell, to a >ew
Woman, who will treat him as he did his
wife, and th<Â»n he will know the rather
doubtful pleasure of continual mental and
physical pin-pricks.
Usually the fault-finding man combines
another vice with his chief one, and that
vice is the abomination of desolation
stinginess. He is not at all inclined to be
stingy vith himself, but he wants to
know* what becomes of every cent which is
spent by his wife. The fact that she is his
wife and lias an absolute right to a certain
part of his income never seems to dawn
on him, and nothing gives him greater
pleasure than to discuss with two or three
of his cronies the extravagance of the
woman who bears his name. If she looks
shabby he blames not himself, but her.
He doesn't know and doesn't care how the
little bit of money which he gives her is
so well managed that he always has a
good breakfast and a good dinner, while
she and the children have a starvation
luncheon. If he happen? to take her out
he scoffs at her quiet black frock, never
dreaming that it has gone through all the
economical possibilities that only come
when a woman hasn't much money and
must freshen her old frock. The 5 cents'
worth of soap barK to wash it. the as
sistance of a little dressmaker whose value
lies in her cheapness, the careful arrange
ment of the riLoon bows here and a trim
ming there, concealing a bad place, are,
to you and me, pitiful, but to the stingy
man it is all no more than his wife ougct
to do. He is as stingy with his love and
his pleasant words as he is with his
money, and, although, before he was mar
ried, he used to make most ardent vows of
iove, love that was to last till death and
after, he doesn't think it necessary, nowa
days, to even express his approbation of
the way the woman he has married tries
to cater to bis wishes.
He is apt, in addition, to be suspicious.
Stinginess and suspicion are close kin, and
usually go hand in hand. He questions
the children as to their mother having
seen anybody during the day; he manages
to drop into the kitchen, and, by being
pleasant to the cook, gets her to admit
that Mrs. Dash rnixht have been more
economical if she tried. He knows some
jolly pood fellows and is forced to think
that when their wives call upon his wife
they must discuss him and compare him
to them to his disadvantage. He forgets
entirely that he is married to a woman â
and when one says a woman one usually
means a something that ban all the faith
fulness of a dog without his occasional
lapse into a bad temper, and, as a natural
sequence, a bite. If the mother of his
wife visits her he is never quite sure that
the days would pass by so quickly unless
his vices were under discussion, and if his
own mother happens to be to the fore he
feels sure that she tells his wife what he
vs 1 d to be and that they both sigh over
what he is now. Oddly enough in his
heart of hearts is a positive contempt for
himself, for he knows that he is a cad.
One or two thrashings a week might, per
haps, make a man ot him, but I doubt it.
When fault-finding and suspicion control
the heart of a man he is about as near
degradation as any human being can be.
She asked me another question â did this
little woman wno wrote the charming let
ter. She said, "Do you believe in divorce 7"
I wish I knew how to say "No" so loudly
that it would reach the ears of each
woman who had ever thought of it and
convince them that one of these wonder
ful new guns was near her and that she
was struck by one of the five hundred
shots thst they sent out every minute.
Sometimes between two married people
things reach such a point that it is wiser
for them to separate â to Jive apart and to
lead lives that give no scandal. .But the
divorce â oh, no! Once a woman is di
vorced from one man and marries another
Bhe becomes demoralized and fails to see
why she may not continue the divorcing
and the remarrying as long as she
pleases. She forgets that the day will
come when the only bloom on her cheeks
is an artificial one; when the beautiful
hair is false; when the eyes have lost their
glow and the is tired of lfie. What will

| she think about then? Always of her

: not been so easily irritated about this, so
i suspicious about "that, or so determined
about something else, she might still be
an honored wife.
It is a beautiful thing, to my way of
thinking, to see two people, no longer
j young, the woman no longer beautiful
from that standpoint that 4 demands rosy
cheeks, bright eyes and sunny locks,
happy with each other. Of course they have
had their misunderstandings; of course
â  there have been times when it seemed to
! each as if the other could no longer be en
dured, but then one of the two remembered
the vows they had taken, and yielded, and
so all life was made smoother and they
grew gradually to understand just what
j each liked best, what each most enjoyed;
j and, although the big world was around
them, it was outside them ; and love and
peacs reigned in the little world made by
these two.
I wonder if I have said all there is about
bad husbands? I don't like to attack the
men. They have always been good and
kind to me, and I am forced to judge them
by what I see of them. My friend, you
may take it as a truth, that two people are
required to make a har.py home. Many a
bad husband has been unconsciously re
formed by his wife's wisdom. I don't like
to say that women ever need reformation.
But there are bad husbands. Else women
wouldn't be glad when they went off in the
morning and didn't return until night.
But so much is in the hand of the woman.
Man is the lower auimal. To be quite
honest, 1 have never been quite sure
whether he was above or below the mon
key. So it is in the finer, better nature ot
woman to train him in the way he
should go; to train him to be "more
gentle, to be more affectionate, more gen
erous and less fault-finding. I don't be
lieve there is any redemption for the sul
len or the stingy man. However, it is
pleasing to think that he will have a here
after, and I can imagine that heaven, to
some women, will mean looking down to
where their husbands are and reminding
them of the past. It would be a ratber
nasty thing to do; still, there would be a
certain satisfaction about it, and no woman
could be blamed for doing it who had lived
with a man who was all-round horrid.
But then there are so many good men.
And nice men. And lovable msn. And
considerate men. And unselfish men.
And generous men. And among these
there ought to be a man pleasing to that
nice little woman and her neighbor and

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, IliÂ», March 28.â Wheat had a quiet
and uneventful short session to-day. Beginning
firmly the tone varied but little from that through
out. On the curb and at the regular opening local
professionals bought, and, when pr'ces had ad
vanced moderately, they sold out. There was no
outside trade and the room operations were en
tirely of the scalping sort. It was rumored that
Thoman's report on the crop, which was in the
bands of subscribers to-day, and which would be
(liven publicity on Tuesday, was rather bullish.
The trade was disposed to look with some doubt
upon the story. The M. Louis Modern Miller
siated that the condition of the wheat crop had
notably declined during the past week.
A morning paper gave a comprehensive review
of the crop situation which was decidedly favor
able. Export clearances for the week from both
coasts amounted to 1.744,000 bushels. Liverpool
cables were quiet and tirui. Paris lower and Berlin
higher. -Receipts at Chicago were 11 cars and 198,
--800 bushels were withdrawn from store. North
western arrivals were good at 408 cars, against 661
las; Saturday and- 224 a year e.ga. Argentine
shipments ast week were 1,136,000 bushels. The
last half hour's trading was marked by consider
able strength, thÂ« nest quotations of the day being
then established. Export clearances at Atlantic
seaboard were 187.626 bushels. May wheat opened
from 68^4c to 633/ s c, sold between t>By,s(3j63Vic
and 64(ii64y B e, closing at 6.U s ia,6-lc, %@%C
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for
Monday 10 cars.
CORN-A bout held its own but achieved no dis
tinction in the way of activity or feature. The busi
ness ran 'o the closing up kind, covering by shores
and selling out by those who were long. Receipts.
346 cars, were about the number expected. There
were no withdrawals from store. Liverpool cables
were quiet and firm. Argentine shipments last
week were 888.000 bushels. . Export clearances
were 147,240 bushels. M: y corn opened at 2P5/ B e,
advanced to 29% c, where it closed, VsC higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for Monday
270 cars.
OATSâ Sympathized with wheat and corn in
tone. A moderate business was transacted, the
character of which was similar to that seen in the
other markets. Receipts, were 220 cars and 80,000
bushels were withdrawn from store. The close
was at the outside. May being Vs c higher fian yes
terday. Estimated receipts for Monday 175 cars.
FLAXâ Was weak. Cash declined from 89Vi
to 89c; May from B'.' l to 87% c; July sold at
&9%c and September was 91c asked. Receipts
20 cars.- â¢ - ' â¢â¢ â¢
PROVISIONSâ The feeling In product was not
weak nor was it strong. Professionals were not
forcing sales, but in some cases covering a portion
of their shorts. This afforded steadiness to prices.
Tnere was no well defined bull feeling in the mar
ket. At the close the feeling was less steady than
it was earlier in the session. May pork rested 6c
I under yesterday; May lard and ribs were un
i changed.

the installment plan. Make your own
terms; we never disappoint a subscriber,

OAKLAND SHOTS AHEAD.
The Result of the Police Rifle
Match at Shell Mound
Park.
SAN FRANCISCO "NOT IN IT."
The Winning Team Entertained at
Dinner at the Expense of the
Losers.
The rifle match between ten men from !
the San Francisco and Oakland police de- !
partments, which nas been for some
months rapt arousing the greatest interest
in the departments, toot place at Shell
Mound Park yesterday afternoon and re-
Bolted In a victory for the Oakland men by â 
14 points.
lhe Ban Francisco team, accompanied
by Ceptain Wittman and several friends,
went across the bay with the 12 o'clock
boat, and on arriving at the park they â 
found the Oakland men with Captain
Fietcher waiting for them. Chief Lloyd
of Oakland was also with his men and j
watched the contest with the greatest in
terest. Among others present were: Gen
eral J. G. Wall, Captain Bradley, Captain
Hindeof the Pinkerton agency, Colouel j
Burns, ex-inspector of rifle practice in the ;
militia, ex-Captain Short, Sergeant Bethel
and ex-Sergeant Harmon.
Colonel Sam Beaver of the Bank of Cali- j
forma and Colonel McKillican, ex-Sheriff
of Alameda County, wore referees for the
Baa Francisco and Oakland teams respect
ively. Policemen C. Peters and Merrick
were scorers for San Francisco and police- .
men ?t:ihl and Careen for Oakland.
After Captain Wittman and Captain
Fletcher had each taken his team quietly ;
aside and spoken a few words of caution i
and encouragement to them no time was
lost in starting the shooting.
The team* were as follows: |
San Franciscoâ Harry Hook. 0. C. Phil- |
lips. L. C. Peters, W. W. Wilson, John !
Fleming, Thomas A. Atch son. George F. j
Mulcahey, J. H. Flinu, Smith Carr and !
Sergeant Nash.
Oaklandâ D. W. Swain. J. M. Cockerton,
L. E. Andrews, W. Kingsbury, C. E. I
Clarke, J. F. Sill, Frank Schroder, J. J.
McCarthy, Nick Williams and H. C. Ar
nest.
The distance was 200 yards, each man
firing ten shots, the possible being 50. j
There were two targets, M and P, and a '
man from each team tired alternately at
eaclÂ» target for his ten shots. Each man
was allowed two sighting shots.
Harry Hook ana D, W. Swain, two old- ;
time rivals and comrades, laced each other
at M target. Hook firing the lirst shot in I
the match and scoring a center. Swain j
followed with a center, and the pair tin
ished with Swain, who is 61 years of age, 3
points ahead.
Phiilips and Cockerton opened the ball
at P target, the former firing the first shot,
a center. At the finish Cockerton was -
ahead.
The prettiest and most exciting compe
tition -was between Peters and Andrews,
who followed Hook and Swain. Peters
opened with a bullseye, Andrews with a
center. Peters scored another bullseye
and Andrews a center, and the spirits of
the ban Francisco men rose. Peters then
made four centers and Andrews two bulls
eyes and two centers, which made them
equal. Then each made a bullseye, a cen
ter and two bullseyes, ending in a tie â 15
each.
After this Oakland increased their lead. â 
The greatest gain was that of Schroder
over Mulcahev, seven points. Sergeant
Nash was unfortunate. His rifle was a
little under weight at the trigger and was j
rejected. He borrowed Fleming's, and as
he had never shot with it before he made
the poor score of 39, while his opponent j
made 4-' >. Flinn defeated McCarthy by i
four points and Smith Carr defeated Wil
liams by one point. These were the only
two of the San Francisco team to defeat !
their opponents. As stated before Peters !
and Andrews tied at 45 and Atchison and ;
Sill tied at 41. Schroder, with 40, was
the highest scorer of both teams and he '
won a pair' of trousers as the highest 1
scorer of the Oakland team. Peters, with (
45. won an ivory police whistle as the j
highest scorer of the San Francisco team.
None of the San Francisco team shot up !
â¢to .'their average, with the exception of j
Peters. On the contrary all the Oakland I
men, except McCarthy, were up to their
average and two or three were ahead of it. '
McCarthy of Oakland was the lowest ;
scorer, with 36, and "Wilson of San Fran
cisco next, with 38. .
The total for the San Francisco team !
was 409 and for the Oakland team 423, a !
majority for Oakland of 14. Following is j
the score :

When the result was announced,- Cap- ]
tain Wittman jumped on top of one of the
tables and called for three cheers for the
winning team, which were given with
lusty rigor, Andrews' voice rising above
the din with a yell of
Who arc, who Â»re, who are we?
We are, we are O. P. I).
Captain Fletcher then called for three
â¢ cheers for the San Francisco team, which
" were given with equal vigor.
The teams then adjourned to the dining
hall in Captain Siebe's. hotel in the park
' where a sumptuous dinner was partaken
* of at the expense of the losing team. Chief
Lloyd sat at the head of the main table,
and Captain "Wittman at the foot, Captain
Fletcher being at the head of the other
table and Sergeant Bethel at the foot.. Be
sides the teams, the referees, scorers,
markers and a few invited guests were
present. .
â¢ After dinner several speeches were made
of congratulation to the winning teem and
of encouragement to the losers. A couple
of hours were pleasantly spent in toasts
and song, the party breaking up after sinir
inp "Auld Lang Syne."
The weather was all that could have
been desired for good shooting. The wind
was light, and although the light was a
trifle fluctuating it was not enough so as
to interfere with the shooting. The San
Francisco men acknowledged they were
beaten on their merits. They are not dis
couraged, however, and as Chief .Lloyd
threw out another challenge in the exuber
ance of victory, which was promptly
accepted by Captain Wittman, they expect
to get even with Oakland in the near
future. Captain Wittman will not make
the arrangements till after his return from
his three months' tour of the leading cities
in the Union.

NOTED TEMPERANCE MEN
Monsignor Nugent and Bishop
Montgomery Will Witness
Cadets Drill.
AN AUSPICIOUS MEETING.
One Founded the League of the Cross
in England, and the Other in
San Francisco.
Among the persons that will witness the
coming competitive drill of the League of
the Cross Cadets in the Mechanics' Pavilion
two are especially noted in the cause of
temperance. Right Rev. Monsignor Nu-
Right Rev. Monsignor Nugent of J iverpool and Right Rev. George Montgomery

gent, the founder of the now world-wide I
total-abstinence movement known as the
League of the Cross, and Right Rev.
i George Montgomery of Los Angeles, who
established the league in this City, will be
present on the occasion.
The fact that two such distinguished
leaders in the temperance crusade will be
among the spectators would of itself be
sufficient to attract great crowds. Both
i are earnest and successful workers and are
I endowed with v personal magnetism to
win respect and admiration.
Monsignor Nugent has been in the
United States for the past eight months
seeking to recuperate his health, which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 1896.
had been run down by constant work.
Notwithstanding his 74 years he is very
active. The scene of his labors for the
past fifty years lias beeu the great com
mercial port of Liverpool, which has a
Catholic population of 200.CXX). But
"Father Nugent," the name by which he
is popularly known, is universally re
spected by all, independent of creed.
In 1872 Monsignor Nugent inaugurated
the great temperance movement in Eng
land. He is most thorough in his meas
ures and almost in every great city of
England preached total abstinence. His
success was marvelous. Often after a lec
ture he administered the pledge to thou
sands.
He is a personal friend of Archbishop
Riordan, whom he is visiting at present.
He only intended to stay a few days, but
when he heard of the competitive drill of
the cadets he postponed his departure. He
says lie would not miss the event under
any consideration.
The committee in charge of the drill in
vited Bishop Montgomery to be present,
and he has accepted. The Bishop is an
enthusiast on temperance questions. It was
he who founded the League of the Cross in
San Francisco. Naturally he will be
highly gratified to meet all the young men
again. It is expected that he will deliver
an address on the occasion. He is a man
of marked personality and an earnest
speaker.
He has many admirers in San Francisco
among all classes.
There will be many other interesting
features on the occasion. Judge Sullivan
will present a magnificent stand of colors
to the regiment from Council 35, Y. M. I.
Although all the different companies have
been presented with American flags by
their many admirers, still there has been
no regimental stand of colors. The two
flags are very r>retty, and will be a great
set-off to the handsome uniforms of the
boys.
General Graham will review the cadet
on the occasion. Eigbt uniformed corns
panics will pass before him. The cadets
are preparing very bard for the coniDeti
tion, and the entire regiment drills every
Sunday in the Presidio grounds. The an
ticipations are that it will be most
successful.
TROUT AND BASS.
No Morning Train to Paper-MIU Creek.
Bass From San
Diego.
Anglers who have decided upon a day's
trouting on the Paper-mill and Lagunitas
creeks next Wednesday, which will be the
first day of the open season, must not for
get that the North Pacific Coast Railroad
has made a change in its time table, com
mencing to-day.
On Wednesday and during the week
days only one train, connecting at Sausa
lito with the ] :4. r > o'clock boat from this
City, will puss the trout streams on that
line.
As there will not be a morning train
anglers who propose whipping; the Lagu
nitas, Paper-mill and Olenia creeks on
Wednesday must leave this City on Tues
day afternoon, so as to have the cream of
the sport on the first day of the season.
Excursion tickets will not be soid on week
days, consequently the fraternity must
pay hi^h for sport if they desire to visit
streams on this line on the opening of the
trout-hshing season.
Owing to the change of time, a large
number of anglers will try their luck on
the creeks which can be reached by trains
of other lines that leave this city at an
early hour.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Wilson and
Cross have taken their departure for San
Diego for the purpose of securing a num
ber of large-mouth bass tbat were planted
in a lake near San Diego four or five years
ago by the United Slates Fish Commis
sioners. It is said that the bass have
grown large and strong, and if the depu
ties succeed in making v good catch, it
will not be many years before the anglers
of this city will" have a chance of trying
their skill in catching these game and
edible fishes. The bass from the San
Diego lake will be planted in Battle Creek,
which is tributary of the Sacramento
River. If they increase in numbers, the
Kus>i:in River and other waters adjacent
to this City will be stocked with large
mouths.
A JUSTICE'S FAITH.
He Trusted a Tout at the Racetrack
and Thereby Lost. One Hun
dred Dollars.
Justice Carroll suffered a loss at the Bay
District track recently for which he blames
one Ransome Elm wood, a tout with whom
he was slightly acquainted.
Mr. Carroll was accosted by Elm wood,
who asked him to cash a hundred-dollar
check drawn by himself on the Wells-
Fargo bank. The justice found he had
not the necessary com at that time, but on
expressing regret Barney Schreiber, the
well-known turfman ana friend of Car
roll's, offered to supply it. Carroll ac
cepted the offer and turned over the
money to Elmwood, who indorsed the
check. The paper was dishonored at the
bank, although it is reported that Elm
wood had intended making it good had the
speculation with the justice's coin "turned
out right."
Easter Tea and Sale.
The members of the Ladies' Guild of the
Howard Presbyterian Church are making
elaborate preparations for the Easter tea and
sale which is to be held on Saturday afternoon
and evening, April 4, in the spacious parlors
of Mrs. William Jones Somers, 1034 Mission
street. A unique collection of Easter novel
ties, fancy work, bric-a-brac, etc., has been
donated for the sale table. Refreshments will
be served nfternoon and evening, and In the
evening a very select musical programme will
be renderea. Friends of the church are cor
dially invited.
Parlor Suffrage Meeting.
There will be a parlor meeting at the home
of Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-Blinn, at 1527 Post
street, to-morrow evening in the interests of
woman suffrage. Miss Anthony and Miss
Yates will address the guests.
FOR EJECTING TENANTS
A New and Unfailing Scheme
Is to Remove Doors and
Windows.
DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.
How the Siege of a Tremont-Avenue
House Was Met With Equal
Strategy.
There is a new way of removing objec
tionable tenants, and it might, from its re
cent origin in this City, be called the San
Francisco tenant-ejecting process.
It consists simply of removing front
doors and windows and instituting a sort
of freeze-out game; but in the artistic and
The House on Tremont Avenue. Near Frederick Street, With Inside Doors Nailed
Across the Window and Front Door by the Tenants After the Owner Had Re
moved the Regular Fixtures in Order to Force the Family to Leave.
[Sketched by a "Call artist.]
legal method employed lies the secret of
its great success and efficiency-
After all attempts at pleading for pay
ment have failed and every one of the old
methods of getting rid of the tenant have
been exhausted, then it is that the agent,
accompanied by two mechanics and a
lawyer, makes his final strategic move.
The attorney is on hand to see that no
ground is afforded the tenants on which
to base an action for forcibly entering the
premises. At the same time care is taken
that there is not in the house any sick
person who might suffer from the ex
posure and sue for damages.
Then the nice part of the work begins.
An entrance must be gained in a legiti
mate way. And this is usually accom
plished under toe pretext of making some
repairs or of altering the door and window
fastenings. The doors and windows are
then removed and carted off in the express
wagon used by the mechanics.
The most recent operation of the new
scheme was upon a house on Tremont
avenue, near Frederick street. The family
were "stayers," and smooth talk, argu
ment and threats did not avail with them.
About a month ago A. M. Spectc & Co.
began the siege on behalf of the loan asso
ciation that owns the property.
The water supply was cut off, but that
never worried the occupants of the
house. They borrowed from their neigh
bors. A whole week passed and there was
no sign that a water famine existed.
Late one Saturday afternoon the men
came to repolish the oak door
and to repair a front window, the glass in
ozie sash having been cracked by the force
of the blasting on Ashbury Heights near
by. The man was not at "home, but his
wife opened the door and afterward stood
unsuspectingly by while it was beingj re
moved from its hinges.
Everything progressed smoothly until
after the lower sash of the large front
window had been taken down to the side
walk and placed near the door. Then the
little woman seemed suddenly (not too
suddenly) to apnreciate what it all meant.
She rushed frantically down the long
flight of step? and graeped the sash. The
men tried to take it away from her, but she
clung desperately on to the frame, even
alter most of tne glass had been smashed
out in tne struggle.
The men loaded the door on their wagon
and drove away.
But the tenants were not immediately
conquered. Next morning the neighbors
were surprised to see two basement doors
nailed across the large window, and the
main doorway was supplied with the two
interior folding-doors that had been re
moved in the night and nailed in place by
the man of the house on his return home.
For several days things went on as usual,
only the postman handed in bills through
a front window and collectors and delivery
men went round to the backdoor.
Nearly a week had passed when one day
a hack stopped in front of the house and
the old lady and the little girls got in.
"Now you wait untii I get 'Polly' and
birdy," called out the little woman, and
when two cages had been placed in the
carriage it drove away, whither the neigh
bors have not yet found out.
Late that night an express wagon
rumbled in the street. The next morning
the neighbors and the anxious agent
learned that the tenants had evacuated
their fortifications.
CORBETT AND MAHER.
They May Sleet in This City at the
Olympic Club Entertain
ment.
Rumors were floating around the Olym
pic Club yesterday that the directors in
tended making a proposition to Champion
Corbett to box ten rounds with Peter
Maher at the boxing tournament of tha
ciub, which will be held in the Pavilion in
May.
Some of the officers who were inter
viewed on the matter laughed at the idea,
but it can be safely said, however, that il
the club can secure Corbett and Maher as
the star attraction of the boxing festival
those famous knights of the glove will be
seen here in May.
Corbett lias intended paying this City a
visit for some time purposely to see his
parents and as Fitzsimmons'has persist
ently refused to notice Corbett's challenge
until the latter has met and defeat* 1 Peter
Maher it is not by any means improbable
that Corbett, will* agree to any reasonable
offer made to him by the club in which he
learned how to box.
In case Corbett should meet Maher in
this City and whip the Irishman inside of
ten rounds he would instantly challenge
Fitzsimmons and force the New Zealander
into the ring, where the world's euampion-
Bhip contest would be decided.
Market-Street Hallway Dividend.
The Market-street Railway Ci â  ipany has de
clared a dividend of GO cents for the quarter
ending March 31. This reprev uts a return o!
about 5 perjcenton the present value of the
stock, which is quoted at abc:t $47 a share.
The total number of shares on which this
dividend is to be paid is something over
180,000, and the stockholders will thus re
ceive an aggregate net income of nearly
$450,000.
