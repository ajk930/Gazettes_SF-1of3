MORE THAN AN INSURRECTION.
The Fact That War Is Being Waged
Is Too Pair le to Be Longer
Ignored.
WASHINGTON', D. C, Jan. 29.â The
Committee on Foreign Relations of the
Senate took iinal action on the Cuban
question to-day. As predicted in these
dispatches would be the ca&e, the commit
tee found itself unable to report resolu
tions favoring belligerent rights, but it
took such action as may soon lead to prac
tically the same thing. Immediately after
t!ie Senate met Morgan reported to the
Senate the following resolutions:
ived. By the Senate (the House of Repre
sentatives concurring) that the present deplor
able var in the island of Cuba has reached a
magnitude tnat concerns all civiiized nations
to the extent that it should be conducted, if
unhappily it is lonp.>r to continue, on those
principles of law ana -warfare that are ac
knov.icdged to be obligatory on civilized
nations when engaged in upeu hostilities, in
cluding the treatment of captives who are
enlisted in either army ; due respect to cartels
for exchange for prisoners and for other mili
tary purposes: truces and flags of truces; the
provision ct proper hospitals and hospital sup
plies and services to the sick, and wounded of
either army. Be it further
Jtct;ulvâ¬d, That this representation ol the
views and opinions of Congress be sent to the
President and that if he concurs therein that
he will ie a friendly spirit use the good offices
of this Government to the end that shall
be requested to accord to the armies with
which it is engaged In war the rights of bellig
erents, as the same are recognized under the
laws of nations.
The resolutions were accompanied by a
comprehensive report. Among other things
the committee says:
"The Congress of the United States,
deep]}* regretting the unhappy state of
hostilities existing in Cuba which has
again been the result of the demand of a
large number of the native population of
that island for it? independence, in a spirit
of respect and regard for the welfare of
both countries earnestly desire that the se
curity of life and property and the estab
lishment of permanent peace and of a
government that is satisfactory to the peo-
pie of Cuba should be accomplished. And
to the extent that the people of Cuba are
peeking the rights of local self-government
for domestic purposes the Congress of the
United States expresses its earnest sym
pathy with them.
"The Congress would also welcome with
satisfaction the concession by Spain of
complete sovereignty to the people of that
island, and would cheerfully give to such
a voluntary concession the cordial support
of the United States.
"The near proximity of Cuba to the
frontier of the United States, and the fact
that it is universally regarded as a part of
the continental system of America, identi
ties that island so closely witn the political
and commercial welware of our people that
CongresÃ cannot be indifferent to the fact
that civil war is flagrant among the people
of Cuba. Nor can we longer overlook the
fact that the destructive character of this
xvar is doing serious harm to the rights
and interests of our people on the island
and to our lawful commerce, the protec
tion and freedom of which is safeguarded
by treaty obligations."'
The committee emphasizes the fact that
the United States, in the various strug
gles between Cuba and Spain, has always
observed in perfect faitli all of its duties
toward the belligerents. Although diffi
cult, the task was performed with vigor,
impartiality and justice, in the hope that
Spain would so ameliorate the condition
of the Cuban people as to give them peace,
contentment and prosperity. The com
mittee says this result has not been accom
plished. The hospitality which our treat
ies, the laws of nations and of Christianity
have extended to Cuban refugees, has
caused, the committee adds, distrust by
the Spanish Government as to the fidelity
of the United States Government to its
obligations of neutrality. This distrust
has become a source of serious annoyance
to our people and has led to a spirit of re
taliation toward Spanish authority in
Cuba, thus giving rise, the committee
says, to frequent controversies between
the two countries. Continuing, the report
says:
"The absence of responsible government
in Cuba, with powers adequate to deal
directly with questions between the people
of the United States and the people and
political authorities of the island, has been
a frequently recurring cause of delay, pro
tracted imprisonment, confiscations of
property and the detention of our people
and their ships, often upon groundless
charges, which has been a serious griev
ance."
Further along the committee says that
the contemplation of unlawful invasion by
reckless persons when insurrections have
occurred in Cuba has given the Govern
ment of the United States anxiety, trouble
and much expense in the enforcement of
our laws and treaty obligations of neu
trality, and these occasions have been so
frequent as to mate these duties unreason
ably onerous upon the United States Gov
ernment. On the present struggle in Cuba
the report says:
"The devastation of Cuba in the war
that is now being waged, both with fire
and sword, is an anxious and disturbing
cause of unrest among the people of the
United States, which creates strong
grounds of protest against the continuance
of the struggle for power between Cuba
and Spain, and which is rapidly changing 4
The San Francisco Call.
the issue to one of existence on the part of
a preat number of the native population.
"It is neither just to the relations that
exist between Cuba ana the United States,
nor is it in keeping with the spirit of the
age or rights of humanity that this strug
gle should be protracted until one party or
the other should become exhausted in the
resources of men and money, thereby
weakening both until they may fall a prey
to some stronger power or until the stress
of human sympathy or the resentments
engendered by the long and bloody con
flict shouid draw into the strife the unruly
elements of neighb oring countries.
"This civil war, though it is great in its
proportions and is conducted by armies
that are in complete organization and di
rected and controlled by supreme military
authority, has not the safeguard of a car
tel for the treatment of wounded soldiers
or prisoners of war. In this feature of the
warfare it becomes a duty of humanity
that the civilized powers should insist
upon the application of the laws of war
recognized among civilized nations to both
armies. As our own people are drawn
into this struggle on both sides and enter
either army without the consent of our
Government and in violation of our laws,
their treatment, when they may be
wounded or captured, although it is not
regulated by treaty and ceases to be a
positive care of our Government, should
not be left to the revengeful retaliation
which exposes them to the fate of pirates
or other felons.
"The inability of Spain to subdue the
revolutionists by the measures and within
the time that would be reasonable, when
applied to occasions of ordinary civil dis
turbance, is a misfortune that cannot be
justly visited upon the people of the
United States, nor can it be considered
that a state of open civil war does not
exist, but that the movement is a mere
insurrection and its supporters a mob of
criminal violators of the law, when it is
seen that it requires an army of 100,000
men and all the naval and military power
of a great kingdom even to hold the al
leged rebellion in check.
"It is due to the situation of affairs in
Cuba that Spain should recognize the ex
istence of a state of war in the island and
should voluntarily accord to the armies op
posed to her authority the rights of
belligerents under the laws of nations."
In conclusion the committee says that
"the Congress of the United States, recog
nizing the fact that the matters herein
referred to are properly within the control
of the chief executive and within the prin
ciples of our constitution, it becomes the
duty of Congress to define the final atti
tude of the Government of the United
States toward Spain. It presents these
considerations to the President in support
of the resolution which the committee this
morning reported favorably to the Senate."
A minority report was submitted by
Senator Cameron. Cameron favored the
immediate passage of a resolution request
ing the President to interpose his friendly
offices with the Spanish Government for
the recognition of the independence of
Cubr, and in his report he cited much of
the history of the late War of the Rebel
lion to show the attitude of the Spanish
Government toward the Uniieu Siatea at
that time.
Wh^n the vote in committee was taken
several Senators were absent, but all pres
ent voted for the resolutions, which were
drawn by Morgan, among them being
Morgan, Todd, Gray, Turpie and Frye.
Members of the committee say that un
less Spain shows a speedy determination

to conduct her warfare against the Cubans
after the fashion of other civilized coun
tries she will be brought face to face with
the power of the United States exerted in
behalf of the Cuban insurgents within a
very short time.
The minority report of Senator Cameron
consists of twenty-four typewritten pages,
much of which is historical matter. Cam
eron says that early in 1869, during the
previous revolution, a proclamation was
signed by President Grant recognizing the
Cubans as belligerents, although the fact
was Known to very few persons. This
proclamation was not promulgated, owing
to the opposition of Secretary Fish.
During that war Mr. Cameron shows
that our Minister was directed to impress
upon the Spanish mind the advancing
growth of that sentiment which claims for
every part of the American hemisphere
the right of self-government and freedom
from trans-Atlantic dependence. The
| good offices of the Uaited States were
offered to the Cabinet at Madrid for the
purpose of bringing to a close the "civil
war now raging in the island of Cuba."
. Mr. Cameron reviews in detail the in
cidents connected with the proclamation
of ISG9, and coming down to recent times
1 says that President Cleveland has cleared
the subject of all preliminary doubts; that
a state of war exists in Cuba'and with that
and that alone we have to deal. Con
tinuing he says:

PINAR DEL RIO OVERRUN
General Maceo's Small Force
Has Captured the Entire
Province.
Gomez' Passage to the Westward
Not Checked by the Spaniards.
The Hawkins' Loss.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 29.â Gomez has
gone to Pinar del Rio to join Maceo. The
latter has made a marvelous capture of the
western province. Xearly every town ex
cept the capital city and its port (Colma)
are occupied. The townspeople welcomed
the insurgent army, hoisted the Cuban flag
over the Town Hall, gave balls and fur
nished provisions, ammunition, horses,
supplies, etc.
Maceo Â»tarted with 200fcmen, brai now he
has over 5000 and is turning others away.
Several companies of Spanish volunteers
have joined Maceo.
The only serious engagements were
those of the 17th and 18th at Taironai,
which the Spaniards claim as victories but
which resulted in the capture of 100,000
rations by Maceo.
In the following towns Maceo appointed
Alcaldes and Secretaries and formed local
governments^ San Crystobal, Piacios,
Paso Real, Consolacion del Sur, San Juan
Martinez, San Luis, Guanemantua and
others of less importance.
It is reported that General Luque is mor
tally wounded, but this the Government
denies. Generals Navarro, Arison and
Luque are endeavoring to crush Maceo.
Gonez crossed the Trocha south of
Havana Sunday, going west, and ap
parently had no difficulty. He burned a
train Sunday afternoon this side of Guana
jay. He had an encounter with the
columns of Linarez and Algecom on the
Santa Lucia estate, twenty-five miles
southwest of Havana, Monday. The
troops used artillery. The officials ad
mit twelve killed on their side, but do not
give the Cuban loss. It is said to be
small.
The insurgents camped near the scene of
battle Monday night; Tuesday they en
tered Pinar province and proceeded in the
direction of Cuxajabos.
Gomez liaa about 4000 mounted men,
well armed, but short of ammunition.
With Gomez's army are four women sol
diers, wives of men. Each carries a rifle
and belt tilled with cartridges. They are
dressed in men's clothes. Maceo is said
to have the largest force now and also
plenty of ammunition.
The censorship is absolute. It is impos
sible to cable the truth under present ar
rangements. The only matter allowed to
go is highly colored accounts of battles,
rebel defeats and rebel atrocities. The
battles prove to be mere skirmishes, the
defeats fail to stop the rebel advance and
atrocities are never committed. The pa
triots preserve strict disoipline, and hang
camp followers whenever the latter com
mit crimes.
On the other hand, the withdrawal of
Campos is followed by reports that Span
ish volunteers have already begun shoot
ing suspects. The Cubans are fleeing from
the interior, where a reign of terror is said
to have already begun. Hundreds of
Cubans thrown into jail in Santiago prov
ince remain with only suspicion against
them.
The Aledo estate is the only one in
Havana province grinding cane. The in
surgents attempted to burn it Monday,
but driven away by a heavy guard of
troops. One estate in Santa Ciara is grind
ing and two in Santiago are reported to
have begun grinding.
The railroads operate spasmodically.
Armored cars containing troops are at
tached to every train.
The Cubans are greatly disappointed
over the disaster to Garcia's expedition.
The Government now has Gomez and
Maceo in the Western province and is in
creasing its force of men to prevent their
return. Horses are being taken for the
purpose of forming a cavalry force.

WAS THERE A TRAITOR?
An Enemy of Cuba May Have Cauted
the Haickin*' Xoft.t.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 29. â The
utmost secrecy was maintained by the
Cubans in this, city regarding the move
ments of the filibusters who were on
board tue fishing steamer J. W. Hawkins
which foundered on Monday forty-five
mile east-southeast from Barnegat. A re
porter to-day found Salvador Arbors, who
had charge of the medical department of
the steamer Hawkins expedition. He said
that the trouble began on the steamer
Hawkins on Sunday at 11 o'clock.
In fact, she was then in a sinking con
dition, but the filibusters worked man
| fully to save her and the ammunition they
| had on board for their fighting countrymen.
But the vessel was doomed, and the am
munition had to be sacrificed and thrown
into the sea.
It is said that Mariano Alberich, one of
the men drowned, had resided in this city,
and that he was a member of a rich and
influential family in Cuba. He had been
sentenced to life imprisonment, but while
on parole in Madrid, two years aco, had
broken his parole and escaped. He came
to the United States, and he was enthusi
astic in the Cuban cause.
Jose Beneche, Albert Geleat, Captain
Gastan and Victor Gomez were among the
unfortunates who lost their lives.
At the office of the Cuban Junta to-day
one of the leaders, who refuses to allow
his name to be used, said there were grave
suspicions that the ship had been sunk by
i treachery.
"The situation is just this: Either the
ship was bad and we were terribly de
frauded in its purchase, or it was good and
there was bad faith among those on
The Hawkins was purchased through a
responsibie firm of high standing. She
was bought in Baltimore and was there
examined from stem to stern, hull and
machinery. She was pronounced stanch,
swift and seaworthy. The price paid was

Sonoma County Proudly In

Exhibit.

CLOVERDALE. Cal., Jan. 29. â To
night Sonoma County invites all Cali
fornia, Sunnyside and the favored spots of
the south especially to show cause why
she (Sonoma County) shall not be known
hereafter as the place peculiar to the
orange and lemon.
To be sure, this challenge has been
posted up quite a long while, but to-night,
at Cloverdale, the county has set forth her
proofs, and declares that by them she will
insist upon her claim until some other
shall show a betterâ not in the quantity of
her product, be it understood, for she has
not long turned her thoughts that way,
but in the high average of what she has
produced.
The annual exhibition of the Cloverdale
Citrus Fair Association was formally
opened to-night, and will remain open
until Friday night, possibly until Satur
day, and, if there be any citizen of this
great State or any representative body
from any ambitious citrus-growing com
munity who may be disposed to take issue
in this matter, this is the time, here the
place. To facilitate the matter the rail
road rates nave been made especially low.
The great pavilion where the lair is
being held is at this writing crowded with
people, the Cloverdale band has just burst
into an inspiring air as though joining the
people in their applause at the close of
Professor E. W. Davis' address, which sig
nalized the opening of the fair for 1896.
Oranges are piled upon oranges in col*
umns, pyramids and arches. Orange ex
hibits flank orange exhibits in every
direction, relieved by exhibits of lemons,
olives, nuts, prunes, figs and the infinito
variety of citrus and allied fruits. The
crowds in attendance rind them on the
right and the left, in front and behind
them. And the air is fragrant and deli
cious with the commingled aroma.
And the odd part of it is that one man
in this crowd carries in his pocket written
orders for more than all the product of
â¦his county and the three adjoining coun
ties in these several lines.
So it is not to induce purchasers or aid
sales that this exhibition is being held, for
the sales were secured before the fair was
planned. It is simply the pride of the
natives in their ownâ the things they have
accomplished. They build pyramids and
triumphal arches in oranges because they
can't very well help it. The oranges
themselves suggest such things. They
like to handle and smell them, and they
are certain that many other people from
less favored places would want to do the
same. So they heap them together in
prodigal profusion and start the band
playing and secure a reduced railroad rate
and then stand around and take delight in
the results.
To-morrow they have set apart to bestow
rewards uppn those among them who have
done better than their neighbors, and then,
the night following, all Cloverdale and the
surrounding country will go to dancing on
the wide floor of the pavilion above the
fair.
The exhibits this year are very properly
a matter of pride. They astonish unfa
miliar visitors, very many of whom have
not learned to what perfection the orange
and lemon grows at a day's journey north
of San Francisco. The exhibits brought
together under the roof of the pavilion by
the Fair Association are only a small part
of what these visitors are treated to. For
the orchards immediately in and about
CJoverdale are, this 29th day of January,
80 laden with oranges and lemons that the
careful grower has supplied another forest
of props for the limbs. A complete ex
hibit of oranges is credited to one man â
the secretary of the association â measur-
ing l'S}i incheo in circumference, and
there is a single orange that measures 14}^
inches.
It is generally admitted that the fair is
dated too early by two or three weeks.
Many of the exhibits show fruit of the
finest quality that is still somewhat green,
and shows further possibilities as to size.
There was some misunderstanding also
as to the date of opening, both with the
general public and the exhibitors. As a
result many of the exhibits even to-night
require a finishing touch or two. The cut
rates on the road do not go into effect
until to-morrow, so that the attendance to
night was almost entirely of Cloverdale's
own people. To-morrow, however, big
delegations are expected and promised
from Santa ltosa, Healdsburg and other
points along the line, as well as smaller
representations from places further away.
This fair is an exclusively Sonoma
Connty institution. No man living be
yond its boundary can lay claim to any
part of the credit f or the very handsome
showing made. It is the direct work of
the Cloverdale Citrus Fair Association,
which this year has incorporated with a
capital stocic of 15000. The purpose is to
encourage the cultivation of citrus fruits
within the geologic and climatic belt which
ha 3 its center here and extends through
two adjoining counties, and which, it has
Champagne Imports in 1895.
According to Customs Statistics G. H.
Mumm's Extra Dry aggregate 79,049 cases,
or 45,125 cases more than of any other
brand. By chemical analysis of Professor
R. Ogden i)oremus, Mumm's Extra Dry is
the purest and most wholesome champagne2
been demonstrated, so greatly favors their
growth. To that end, as stated, no out
sider is permitted to encroach here, and a
very persistent applicant for space here
from San Francisco was refused.
Captain John Fields is the president of
the association and W. T. Brush vice
president and treasurer. George B. Baer
is secretary, and C. E. Humbert, F. W.
Brush and M. Minehan are directors.
Ground has been bought on Main street
opposite the pavilion, where the preeent
fair is being held, where a new brick pa
vilion will be built for the permanent use
of the association.
It was 8 o'clock when the opening exer
cises began. The pavilion was brilliantly
lighted, and the general decoration of the
hall, which has gone forward day and night
during the week under the intelligent and
energetic direction of T. 15. Wilson and
Sam Sample, was complete. The walls
and pillars of the big hall were swathed in
white and orange and olive buntine, which
accorded very prettily with the color tone
of the exhibits.
A small forest of palms was arranged at
the entrance, and other palms and vines
were made to play an artistic part in the
sreneral decoration within. A part of the
hal: is Riven over to refreshment and candy
booths, while two or three native wine
exhibits and a big windmill made almost
entirely of dried fruits add variety and
eive life to the scene. The bip arms of the
windmill are kept revolving by a water
motor.
The Cloverdale brass band had hepn dis-.
coursing music for some time, while the
people gradually rilled the aisles in the big
hall.
President Fields and others of the offi
cers took their places on the platform, and
with them Professor E. W. Davis of Santa
Rosa, principal of trie public schools of So
noma County, who was to make the open
ing address, and was so introduced. He
was primed to the topic in hand, and
began by congratulating the people of
Sonoma County on the favors that nature
Lad 30 liberally bestowed upon them. He
had the best of authority for saying that
the orange, lpmon, lime, citron and shad
dock felt more at home in this valley than
in almost any place in the world. The
reason was the peculiar climatic and geo
logical conditions that exist here. The
evidence of these peculiar conditions was
shown not only in the fruit which they
had grown but in the world- famed eeysers
only a few miles removed from this build
ing, together with other signs of internal
heat. Within this belt were thousands of
acres adapted to the culture of these
fruits.
These geologic conditions gave to the
fruit their quality of flavor and the acids
that made them so paiatab!e and refresh
ing. No other single fruit had the great
medicinal value as had the lemon, for
which man everywherecraves. in 1592,
he said, according to Government reports,
there were imported into this country
$4,831,334 worth of citrus fruits, and in
ieÂ«rly as much more. Why not sup
ply this splendid value from the orchards
at home? This same Government authority
asserts that California was better adapted
to the culture of these fruits than any
other country in the world.
The speaker then went on to say that in
this valley there hre more favoring condi
tions at hand than had yet been even
brought into use. These fruits could be
bttter grown under the electric light than
otherwise. They developed more rapidly
and possessed finer qualities than' was
possible by the mere light of the sun by
day.
This valley by use of the electric light,
which could be secured at trifling cost,
might be brought to its very highest devel
opments. The Russian River and the
reservoirs of Blue Lake and Lakeport
could furnish vaterpower for a thousand
dynamos, besides supplying the means of
irrigation if need be. He had it from the
lip 3of Luther Burbank, he said, that
wizard of fruit and vegetable culture, w!io
had given to the world so many new
varieties of both, that Northern Sonoma,
Southern Mendocino and Western Lake
counties were the natural home of the
best varieties of nutsâ the place where
they could be brought to their bestâ the
almond in its softest shell, the English
walnut, the pecan and also the Smyrna fig.
"It is a part of the history of the world,"
said the professor, "that where these
things nourish there is also a healthful
climate, a natural sanitarium. There
men and women grow, like their
fruits, to a physical perfection
matched nowhere else, and with these
to also morality, social and intellectual de
velopment â manhood and womanhood
treading toward their highest planes.
"Now," continued the speaker, "what is
there that we lack? We have abundant
water for every need, we have climate,
soil, the means for transportation and the
people to produce and to exhaust our sup
plies. The market? San Francisco will
distribute your wares whithersoever they
may be called for. It is the key to the
whole world. I may say right here that I
have in my pocket orders for more than
this big valley or the hills, too, for that
matter, for what I have said applies in a
large part to them, have produced this
year."
The speaker then went on to explain the
value in the matter of health of the mere
presence of trees, how they absorbed and
gave out moisture. He encouraged the
young to plant trees as being an excellent
monument to themselves.
The entire address was timely and in
structive and was well received. It formed
the only ceremonial of the opening. The
people applauded, the band played and
the business of the fair began. Much of
this immediately centered about the re
freshment booth, keeping Mrs. F. W.
Brush, Mrs. J. N. Athertonand Mrs. U. A.
Thilo, who are in charge, busy for the bal
ance of the evening. The candy booth, in
charge of Misses Lizzie Hall and Maud
Graham, shared these honors.
Prizes will be awarded to-morrow, and
on Friday evening the fair will close with
a grand ball. On account of the mis
understanding about the opening day it is
possible that the fair may continue through
Saturday.

TILLMAN UTTERS
BITTER WORDS
Denunciation of Cleveland
and Carlisle in the
Senate.
RULED BY WALL STREET.
The One Styled a Hireling and
the Other "That Judas From
Kentucky."
" WHY IS HE NOT IMPEACHED ?"
President and Secretary Accused of
Prostituting Their Offices to
Monopoly.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 29.-The
speech of Senator Tillman to-day, ostensi-
bly in favor of the free" coinage substitute
to the bond bill, but really in denunciation
of the President ana the Secretary of the
Treasury, was one of the most bitter.' -
worded orations ever delivered on the floor
of the upper chamber.
Tillman was on this occasion a splendid
combination of actor and orator, giving
the Senators and spectators two hours of
entertainment. The way in which he
spoke of the President might have exposed
him to interruption and censure, but
seemed to be rather enjoyed than found
fault with. He described him as bull
headed and self-idolatrous.
"Never," said he, "had the high office of
President been so prostituted and never
had the appointing power been so abused.
With relentless purpose he had ignored
his oath of office and given no heed to the
interests of any but his moneyed friends â
his owners or partners."
He spoke of Secretary Carlisle as "that
Judas from Kentucky, who had in his old
age come to a pitiful pass," and referred
to the other Southern members of the
Cabinet, the Secretaries of the Navy and
Interior, as "apostates from the prin
ciples."
"Mr. President," the Senator bDgan, "it
is not saying too much, and I feel war
ranted in charging, that the derangement
in our finances and all this cry about
sound money and maintaining the honor
and credit of the United Slates are all
part and parcel of a damnable scheme of
robbery, which had for its object, first,
the utter destruction of silver as a money
metal; second, the increase of the public
debt by the issue of bonds payable in gold,
ami third, the surrender to corporations
of the power to issue all paper money and
give them a monopoly of that function."
Senator Tillman referred to the Sher
man silver law of 1890, and in this connec
tion said:
"The silver Republicans of the West,
who had deserted the silver Democrats of
the South and accepted the com promise
offered by Senator Sherman, may take
warning as to what faith and trust they
can put in any utterances or actions of
the Senator of Ohio as to legislation in re
gard to cur finances. Tlie time for an
other Presidential election approaches.
They must understand that the election of
any man to the Presidency who would
veto a free coinage bill means defeat. It
means more; it means continued disaster
to our industries and increased poverty to
the masses of our people.
"Under the Sherman law," he con
tinued, "there was a diminution of the
amount of free gold in a gradually
decreasing scale, but not enough to cause
any alarm. During tiie entire year of IS9I
and and the entire year of 1892, there was
approximately as much gold as there was
during ISS4 and 1885."
Discussing the repeal of the purchasing
ciause/>f the Sherman law lie said:
â¢'Democrats and Republicans vied with
each other in the furtherance of the policy
which had been formulated and steadily
pursued by the Senator from Ohio. When
the Senate met there was an acknowledged
majority of men open and outspoken in
their determination to stand by the white
metal, and who were elected on that issue.
But the process of debauchery oegan and
slowly the Senate yielded. In ninety
days the deed was done and the chains
were riveted on the wrists of the toiling
millions. Did the raid on the treasury
stop?"
Discussing then the tariff bill, which
passed in the regular session following, he
said:
"It is true he (the President) did not
sign and allow it to become a law with his
approval; but here, again, we have a spec
tacle of charlatanry and hypocritical as
sumption of superiority to his party, which
has always marked his career. The tariff
law which he repudiated as unworthy, in
volving 'party perfidy and party dishonor,'
is the sheet-ancnor to which he clinga."
And, again, referring to the President:
"If he was honest at the start (and I am
willing to grant that much), his associa
tion with Wall stree'. and his connection
with wealthy men had debauched his con
science and destroyed all sympathy with
the masses."
Further on, in discussing the gold ques
tion, he said:
"Rothschild and his American agents
graciously condescend to come to the help
of the United States treasury in maintain
ing the gold standard which has wroujjht
this ruin, and only charges a small com
mission of $10,000,000 or so. Great God!
that this proud Government, the richest,
most powerful on the globe, should have
been wrought to so low a pass that a Lon
don Jew should have been appointed its
receiver and presumes to patronize us !
"The responsibility of providing reve
nue and looking after the solvency of the
treasury, which rests with Congress, has
been usurped by the President. Why is he
not impeached?
"The encroachments of the Federal ju
diciary and the supineness and venality â
corruption I may say â of the representa
tive branches of the Government are causes
of deep concern to all thinking and patri
otic men. We are fast drifting into gov
ernment by injunction, in the interest of
monopolies and corporations, ana the Su
creme Court, by one corrupt vote, annuls
an act of Congress looking to the taxation
of the rich.
"The struggle from 1861 to 1865. which
drenched this fair land with blood, was to
emancipate 4,000,u00 black slaves. We are
fast approaching a condition which will
place the collar of industrial bondage
around the neck of ten tirues that many
white slaves. A day of reckoning will

come unless there is no longer a just God
in heaven ; and when it does come woe be
to those who have been among the oppres
sors of the people.
"The present struggle is unfortunately
too much like that which preceded the
late Civil War, inasmuch as it is sectional.
The creditor and the manufacturing
States of the North and East have
grown inordinately wealthy at the expense
of the producing classes of the South and
are urging this policy with the be
sotted blindness of Belshazzar."
It was easy to see, the Senator said in
conclusion, that the struggle for the new
emancipation had been begun. There
were millions now on the march and they
tramp, tramp, tramp â tramp sidewalks
hunting work and the highways begging
breadâ and unless relief comes they will
some day take a notion to come to Wash
ington with rirles in their hands to regain
the liberties stolen from them or which
their representatives have sold.
Mr. Tillman spoke for exactly two hours,
delivering with great dramatic power and
effect the last sentence in whiA be pre
dicted a National cataclysm unless "you
take your hands off the people's throat
and give them an opportunity to breathe,
to work, to live."
As soon as he resumed his seat the
session practically broke up, nearly every
Senator rose and left the chamber and the
crowds Hocked out of the galleries.
TAKES UP THE
CUBAN CAUSE,
Continued from First Page.
recognizing the belligerency of the in
surgents after conclusive proof of the fact
the reason doubtless is that in the absence
of any legal complications the question
becomes wholly political and its true solu
tion must lie not in a recognition of
belligerency, but in a recognition of in
dependence.
"In 1375, when the situation was far
from being as serious as it is now, Presi
dent Grant, after long consideration, de
cided against the recognition of belliger
ency as an act which might be delusive to
the insurgents and would certainly be re
garded as unfriendly to Spain. He de
cided upon a middle course. He proposed
to the Spanish Government a sort of inter
vention which would establish the inde
pendence of Cuba by a friendly agreement.
In doing so he not only necessarily recog
nized both parties to the conflict as on an
equal plane, but he also assured Spain
that if such mediation should not be ac
cepted, direct intervention would probably
be deemed a necessity on the part of the
United States. Spain proffered a promise
to the insurgents' terms so favorable as to
cause for a time the cessation of hostilities.
"Siuce then twenty years have passed.
The insurrection, far from having ceased,
has taken the proportions of a war almost
as destructive to ou-r own citizens as to the
contending Darties. The independence of
Cuba was then regarded by the President
of the United States as the subject of his
intervention, and has now become far
more inevitable than it then was. Evi
dently the Government of the United
States can do no less than to take up the
subject precisely where President Grant
Jeft it, and to resume the friendly media
tion which he actually began, with all the
consequences that would necessarily fol
low its rejection.
"Confident that no other nation than
this accords with our friendly relations
with Spain, our just sympathy with Spain,
our just sympathy with the people of Cuba
and with our own dignity and consistency,
I recommend the following resolution to
the consideration of the Senate:
Resolved, That the President is hereby re
quested to interpose his friendly offices "with
the Spanish Government for the recognition of
the independence of Cuba.
A resolution heretofore offered by Call
(D.)of Florida, requesting the President

zens, Mark E. Rodriguez and Louis Sou

mediate release, was reported back from
the Committee on Foreign Relations with

STILL FAST IN THE SAND.
Wreckers Unable to Move the
St. Paul More Than a
Few Feet.
Will Make a Supreme Effort to Float
the Steamer With This Morn
ing's High Tide.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Jan. 29.â The
silvery January full moon beamed brightly
on the steamer St. Paul to-night, but con
trary to expectations the event of the oib
of the night was not attended by the
presaged full tide, consequently the ship
remains on the beach. Neither was the
longed-for easterly wind forthcoming.
At the morning flood tide, which was
full at 8 o'clock, an attempt was made to
float the ship. Three monster tugs pulled
themselves aimost out of the water in their
efforts to move the vessel. The kedge
anchor and capstans were utilized, but
with this combined power the ship moved
only fifty feet and then refused to budge an
other inch. No attempt was made to move
the St. Paul this afternoon.
During tne morning the crew set to work
lightening the ship. The lifeboats, davits
tackle and in fact every piece of detach
able dect fixture was removed and piled
on a lighter.
The two topmasts were also lowered to
centralize the weight. The last piece of
cargo was taken out this morning, conse
quently the ship is many tons lighter than
yesterday.
President Clement A. Griscom of Phila
delphia, with his son Clement Jr., arrived
to-day by special train over the Pennsyl
vania road. They boarded the steamer at
4 o'clock with the intention of remaining
on her till she floats, providing it is not
later than to-morrow evening. Mr. Gris
com is satisfied that everything possible is
being done to save the vessel.
The wrecking masters have everything
ready for the supreme effort which is to
be made to-morrow to float the steamer.
The trial will take place after 8 o'clock,
and if this is unsuccessful they will not
renew their efforts until there is a storm
tide. The railroads carried thousands to
this place to-day. Some of the visitors
came from a distance of 300 miles to view
the ship.

CHOATE PLEADS
FOR HIS CLIENT
Eloquence in Behalf of
Mrs. Stanford and the
University.
END OF THE ARGUMENT.
Decision in the Famous Case
May Not Be Rendered
Before March i.
SUPREME COURT'S ATTITUDE
Significant Remarks in a Colloquy
at the Close of Conrad's
Efforts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 29.â The
argument in the Stanford case was con
cluded to-day in the Supreme Court, J. H.
Choate speaking for Mrs. Stanford ana
Solicitor-General Conrad for the United
States.
A colloquy at the close of Mr. Conrad's
efforts was believed by those who heard it
to have a significant bearing upon the
attitude of the court. The Solicitor-
General was urging upon the court his
contention that under the constitution
and laws of the State of California the
stockholders of the Central Pacific Com
pany were individually liable to the
United States for its debts to the Govern
ment, when Mr. Justice Gray remarked:
"Mr. Solicitor-General, I did not know
that it had any bearing on it, but in 127 th
United States Statutes this court held
that the Central Pacific had a franchise
from the United States."
Solicitor-General Conrad â Yes. sir; they
did, but that was where there was an at
tempt on the part of California to tax the
franchise of that company, and this court
did hold beyond question. Judge Bradley,
I believe, delivering the decision, that the
California company had a franchise of its
own.
Justice Gray â The difficulty, ''n my mind,
was this: That the court there, as I re
member it, in reference to the taxation of
franchises within the State of California,
said that must have included the fran
chise from the United States, and because
it included a franchise from the United
States, therefore the taxation was void.
The reason I suggested it was to see how
you reconciled that decision <Â»r what you
thought should be done with it in order to
carry out your view in this case.
The Chief Justiceâ lt seems to me that
Judge Bradley's language is that the fran
chise of the United states is independent,
though collateral to the State franchise.
Mr. Conradâ He does say so; and Justice
Davis says that this company was invested
with every important franchise. Justice
Bradley, in another place, says that this
company was invested by the United
States with a fundamental franchise. I
do not know the meaning of those terms.
I suppose a fundamental franchise is the
franchise of being a corporation, it is a
creative act, and 1 had supposed that
those terms were just as my learned com
petitor here has referred to as terms that
were used by the .] adges arguendo â not in
volved in the decision at all.
At this point the Solicitor-General be
gan arranging his papers, as if to leave,
although he had spoken only about an
hour, when the Chief Justice said: "You
may have more time, Mr. Conrad."
Mr. Conrad â I am tired.
And the presentation of argument in the
creat case was ended.
In concluding his plea for Mrs. Stanford
Mr. Choate said that he rested the case
upon these propositions:
"First, that Congress, for its own ends
and purposes, intended in the whole busi
ness covered by the Pacific Railroad Com
pany to make itself and did make 'itself
absolute master of the situation, not to
rely upon the aid of any State, or the laws
of any State, nor to permit the interference
of any State, or the laws of any State, but
to be self-sovereign, supreme, absolute
and sufficient for the whole business, and
by its own laws to cover its whole scope
and to regulate the entire relations of par
ties in lespect to all that each party was to
do or receive; that all companies were to
be on a footing of absolute equality, and
â¢ the Central Pacific was not singltd out
alone among them all to furnish to the
Government substantial indemnity in the
shape of stockholders' liability to the
amount of $60,000,000, while no other com
pany was to furnish a dollar of such in
demnity.
Secondâ That by the law of Congress, as
construed by its own courts, which this
court will follow, there was no such thing
a? an individual liability of stockholders
existing in the California corporation at
the time the contract was made between
the Central Pacific Company and the Gov
ernment, and hence the defendant cannot
be liable.
Thirdâ That by the law of California, as
construed by its own courts, which this
court will follow, if there was such liability
it was only qualified liability, limited to
the condition that it should mature and
be enforceable within three years from the
date when the liability was created, and
when the United States made their bonds
for thirty years they necessarily excluded
the possibility of any stockholder's lia
bility being predicated upon them or at
tached to them.
FouTth â That by the true construction
of the act of Congress, illustrated and
guided by the Thurniun act and by the de
cisions of this court, the companies them
selves are not absolutely unconditionally
liable for the repayment of bonds, but
they are only to be paid upon the condi
tions and in the manner provided in the
act, and therefore defendant is not liable.
"I wish 10 call the attention of the
court," said he, "to some matter contained
in a brief of special counsel in California
which I think the learned Attorney-Gen
eral must have inadvertently adopted,
wherein certain gross personalities against
the memory of Senator Stanford are in
dulged in as arguments to the court. It
is suggested that somehow or other those
projectors, as lie calls them, have made
profits which they ousht not to have
made. If the estate of Senator Stanford
is liable to the Government on any such
ground let them come boldly forth and
say so. Let tiieni come out into the open
and not skulk behind this artificial,
lictious, pretended, unfounded claim of"
stockholders' liability.
"And now, if the court please, I earn
estly ask for as speedy a decision of this
case as is consistent with the other duties
of this court, and I think I may properly
in this connection refer to the terrible ex
igencies pressing upon this defendant,
whom I represent. Her time is very short,
necessarily short. The great university to
which she and her husband have dedicated
this property is in daily danger of being
compelled to close its doors. Will not the
court give her an opportunity in her own
lifetime, either to reinstate it so that it
may recover from the shock that this liti
gation has put upon it, or, if there must be
such an end, then to bury it with honor
and decency?"
"Perhaps I have gone too far in making
that suggestion or speaking of this uni
versity at all, but if I have there is great
precedent for it in the history of this court.
I have read that when the greatest of
American lawyers was pleading here for
Dartmouth College at the close of the
greatest argument, perhaps, ever delivered
in this court he appealed to his personal
love and the love of many others for that
little college in the hiils where he was
nurtured, and you could hear his great
heart beat, they said, in tne silence that
followed tnat appeal. And may not this
defendent appeal, not only to her own
love for thi3 great institution which she is
founding, but to the love of all the people
of this country â for the steps of its youth
are trending there from every State in the
Union â may she not appeal at least for a
speedy decision of the cause?"
The Supreme Court will take a recess in
few days and the decision cannot be hand
ed down in the Stanford case before March
at the earliest.
KRUGER FEARS TREACHERY
Warns Possible Disturbers That
They Will Be Severely
Dealt With.
Consul Manion Denounced to Secretary
Olney by a Johannesburg
Citizen.
PRETORIA, South Africa, Jan. 29.â 1n
view of the fact that several of the mining
companies operating in the South African
Republic are considering the project of
closing their mines, President Kruger has
issued a proclamation asserting that he
has reasons for suspecting that this action
is prompted by the same spirit that pro
voked the recent disorders in the Trans
vaal, and he therefore, while promising in
every way possible to promote the supply of
native labor and otherwise to protect and
develop the mining industry, warns any
persons who may create a disturbance in
the republic that the most severe penalties
will be enforced.
OLNEY'S AID INVOKED.
Consul Jtlanion'a lneomjtetency Made
Plain to the Secretary.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 29.â Henry
Butters of San Francisco arrived at the
Shoreham Hotel to-day in company with
Mr. Trusto of New York. The latter is an
intimate friend of John Hays Hammond
and Mr. Butters' brother, who was im
prisoned at Pretoria, but was released on
bail.
The gentlemen consulted Senator Per
kins this morning about the character of
Manion, consular agent at Johannesburg.
Mr. Butters resided for four years, at
Johannesburg and is well informed as \to
ti.e situation there. Trusto also lived in
the Transvaal. They both alleged that
consular Agent Manion was altogether
unfitted to act as American agent at
Johannesburg. Acting upon Senator Per
kins' advice, they saw Secretary O'ney this
mornine and represented to him that
Manion was an ignorant man and not able
to write a grammatical or respectable com
munication to President Krueger.
They told Olney that Manion was sent
there by William R. Grace of New York
as a mechanic to introduce a drill, and
that through Grace's influence he was
made American consular agent. Butters
declares that Manion, although ignorant,
was egotistical and ambitious to shine in
society; that he was practically ostracised
by the best Americans of the Transvaal
country, being blackballed from several
clubs, and consequently Manion had no
love for Americans there.
''He hates the American colony as much
as they despise him," declared Mr. Butters
in a conversation with Secretary Olnev,
"and will do as little as he is able to do to
protect their interests."
They asked that a special diplomatic
agent be sent to Johannesburg. Mr. Olney
did not promise to do this, but suggested
that it might be as well to appoint a con
sul at Cape Town. American Consul Bene
dict died some time ago, and since that
time Mr. Knight, a British subject and
also consular representntive of France and
Germany, had acted as American vice
consul.
The salary of the American Consul, held
by Benedict, is only $2000 per annum. Mr.
Olney can appoint his successor at that
salary, but if it seems desirable to raise
the grade of this office he will recommend
to Congress that the salary of this office be
increased so that a first-class man may
represent American interests in Africa.
The diplomatic and consular appropria
tion bill passed the House yesterday, but
it could be amended in the Senate through
the efforts of Senators White and Ferkinb
if Secretary Olney should make this recom
mendation.
The Idaho Senators have received a
cablegram from V. H. Clement, one of the
Americans arrested, stating that every
thing is <juiet at Pretoria and Johannes
burg, and that there is no imminent
danger to any Americans, but urging that
Shoup and Dubois co-operate with other
Senators to secure fair treatment and trial
for all Americans. Mr. Butters declares
that the Boers have no use for Americans.
He says Krueger is the real power and
there is no Richelieu behind the throne
and that Krueger is the man to communi
cate with.
DUCK-HUNTING AGAIN.
The I'resident Goes Upon a Jaunt to the
Virginia Marshes.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 29.âPresi
dent Cleveland returned to Washington at
8:45 this evening from his Quantico duck
hunting expedition. His only companions
on the voyage were Dr. O'Reilly and Cap
tain Laruberton, lighthouse inspector, with
Captain French in charge of the Maple.
The party reached Quantico at 2 o'clock
this morning and at 0 o'clock began their
sport, which continued, excepting ail in
terval for dinner, until late in The after
noon. The Maple did not leave the hunt
ing grounds until 6 o'clock in the evening.
Captain Lamberton was the President's
companion on the hunt.
No unusual incident characterized the
Presidents reception at the wharf. Hl3
carriage was there in waiting, but with no
attendant beside the coachman. No van
was necessary to convey the pame that fell
victims to the President's gun. The total
number of ducks was thirty -two.

OUT OF THE STATE'S CONTROL.
Branch Lines Onerated Under Outside
Chartersâ No Kentucky Office
Exists.
LOUISVILLE, K.Y., Jan. 29.â 50 far as can
be learned, that astute eld 'railroad king,"
Mr. C. P. Huntington, has left very im
portant points of attack on the charter of
the Southern Pacific Company uncovered.
He has apparently neglected to comply
with the only provision of his charter that
has any reference to the State of Ken
tucky, Section Bof said charter provides
as follows:
The company shall keep an offir-o for the
transaction of business, and the clerk or assist
ant clerk of said corporation shall reside
within the State of Kentucky; but the said
corporation may keep offices at such places
outside of this State as in the judgment of its
board of directors its business may from time
to time require; provided that nothing herein
contained shall be construed as granting any
lottery or banking privileges.
Sec. 9. This act shall take effect immediately
Upon its passage.
This provision has never been amended
or repealed. It is plainly mandatory and
not permissive.
Presumably such office would be located
within Frankfort, the capital, or in the
city of Louisville, the metropolis and rail
road cenier of the State, where the general
offices of the Chesapeake, Ohio and South
western Railroad, t!ie western division of
the Newport News and Mississippi Valley
system, one of Huntington's transconti
nental links, are located. There is no such
office in Frankfort nor has there ever been,
nor, as far as The Call's correspondent
can learn, in Lexington or Covington.
If it is in the city of Louisville it is not
easily found. A careful examination of
Caron's Louisvilie directory from ISBS to
:1s to find any mention even of such
an office or such a company as the South
ern Pacific Company. Men intimate in
Louisville railroad circles for the past
twenty years fail to remember ever having
heard of or seen such an office. The
directory for 1895 gives H.s other offices in
this city as follows:
Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, ticket office
253 Fourth street.
Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Rail
road, general offices I'nion depot, 126 Seventh
erreet; ticket offices 403 West Market street.
short Route Transfer Company, 126 Seventh
street.
But it maTces no mention of the South
ern Pacific office.
In KentuckyJMr. Hnntington follows his
general plan of operating his roads in each
State under charters obtained in other
States, so as to avoid being responsible to
or under the control of the State courts.
His lines from the Mississippi to Newport
News are operated by the Newport News
and Mississippi Valley Company under a
charter procured in the State of Connecti
cut, and whose general offices are in New
York City.
This company, of which Mr. Huntington
is president, operates the lines east from
Louisville to Newport News under the
name of the Chesapeake and Ohio Rail
road, of which the general offices are in
Richmond, Va. It operates the line from
Louisville to Memphis under the name of
the Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern
Railroad, with the general offices at Louis
ville, where General John Echols, the sec
ond vice-president, is stationed. This gen
eral office, as well as the office of the
Louisville Short Route Transfer Company,
by which the Eastern and Western divi
sions of his lines are connected, are in the
new Union depot building at Seventh and
Water streets, which Mr. Huntington built
Borne years ago. The general offices of the
Newport News and Mississippi Valley
Company are not located in Kentucky,
but in New York City.
So the people of Kentucky are as much
in Mr. Huntington's power as those of
California. They have felt and groaned
under the burden for years. The principle
of charging all the freight that the shipper
could bear has been persistently followed
all along his lines in Kentucky, and enter
prise has been throttled and the projectors
bankrupted. The disposition of the peo
ple and the temper of the Legislature are
certainly hoÃtile to Huntington's sys
tem, and the opportunity to strike a
killing blow to the octopus will hardly be
allowed to slip. It will soon pass and will
probably never come again. The Legisla
ture i 3 full of new men pledged to reform
existing abuses, and their disposition is to
do so.
But Huntington's lobby is on the ground,
and its members know how to use "argu
ments" to advantage. It is possible that
in a few days more they might have
enough of the new men committed to
them to give them, with the old standbys
whom the late election tiaal wave left, a
safe majority.
Goebel is a strong man and an energetic
one, but lie has other matters to look aftÂ°r
besides this, and even if he had not- he,
with such volunteer assistance as he may
have from other members, can hardly hold
his own against the powerful influences
thru Huntington is bringing to bear in
Frankfort.
With the proper support Goebel can
pass bis repeal bill; without it Hunting
ton will win.
BOWERS' ELOQUENT PLEA.
An Appeal for California Before the
llotitr Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 29,'â The
House Committee on Pacific Railroads re
sumed its hearings to-day, Representatives
Bowers, jiarham, Hiiborn and
Johnson and ex-Representative Geary be
ing present. The Central Pacific attorneys
were also on hand. Mr. Bowers talked
for an hour and a h-lf and was followed by
Barnam. Mr. Bowers said :
Duriiig t.ie bearing yesterday one of your
number asked Mr. Thurber, who came before
you, whom he ap D eared for. The answer, if I
remember correctly, was, "For the New York
Board of Trade," and I think for some other
business organization or Its agent, to urge the
passage of the funding bill. Anticipating the
same question 1 desire to say that I claim to
represent in this matter 150,000 American
citizensâ the great majority of the people of
the Seventh Congressional District of Calitor
nia, a very large proportion of whom are farm
ers or producers, who make railroads possible,
who furnish them business. I am opposed to
the passage of any funding bill, and in this
position I am confident I represent forty-nine
out of every fifty voters of the district which
sent me here.
I am opposed: Firstâ Because it is against
public policy. Secondâ lt would be a premium
offered those who have misused the Govern
ment's bounty. Thirdâ lt will in my judg
ment establish a fact beyond any argument that
there is to be one code of civil and criminal
law in this country for powerful corposations
and multi-millionaires and another and differ-
ent code for common citizens; that an act
which is held to be dishonest and a misde
meanor by a common citizen, Â»nd for which
act he shall be punished, is to be condoned
and rewarded when committed by any of these
great corporations or persons counting their
wealth by millionsâ it is impossible to escape
this conclusion. Fourthâ To my mind no
justification can be offered for a funding
bill in these cases. It is asked for by
those who have profited by abusing the
people's bounty, by speculators and bond
manipulators. Fifthâ Any funding bill will
continue in power the grievous monopoly
which has for the past twenty-five years
held the Pacific Coast in its merciless grip, and
which has been enabled to do this only through
the powerful aid of the Government, which has
built and turned over to the use of said mo
nopoly nearly 2000 miles of road free of cost,
thus enabling it to dictate to every other road
and to all the people. Sixthâ The funding bill
is not a pood business propositionâ a proposi
tion solely in tne interest of parties who have
betrayed every trust committed to them, whose
every promise has proved false. Seventhâ ln
view of the past record of the parties for whose
benefit the proposition is made, no guaranty
can be given that they will prove more faithful
to any contract now made for future fulfill
ment than tney have been in keeping their
contracts in the past.
I am amazed that these parties, in view of
their past record, now have the hardihood to
ask the Governmeni â without apoiogj or ex
cuse for their misdeedsâ to ask them to con
tinue their outrageous business methods for
fifty years more; that through the strong arm
of the Government the people of the Pacific
Coast shall continue to bear this grievous yoke.
I know, of course, that no person who is un
acquainted with the workings of this Govern
ment-established, Government-assisted and
; Government-protected monopoly realizes whÃt
; this proposition means; that to those who are
I not informed it appears a mere question of
money.
But there is a question above this mere mat
ter of money. Xo funding bill gives any prom
ise of recovering any part of a debt; better by
far surrender all claims, make the whole debt
a present to these parties at once and done
with it.
But I assert there is no need to sacrifice any
part oi the debt due the Government, and in
support of this assertion I propose to quote the
last, report of the Secretary of the Interior. He
shows that the average net receipts for the
past ten years of the Union Pacific were nearly
$4,000,000. The annual interest on first
mortgage bonds, amounting to $1,633,740, is
included In expenditures.
That the average net receipts of the Central
| Pacific were $1,415,206, and that the interest
on first-mortgage bonds is included in expen
ditures, thus bringing the total net receipts of
\ the roads to an average ot $5,229,380. Add
i three millions that the Government would save
on interest if it took the roads and it would
make a net sum of over eight millions a year
above expenditures. The Secretary goes on to
say:
"It will be seen that the average net earnings
of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific main
lines during the past ten years had been
$8,181,220, while the total amount of the
firit-mortgage bonds and Government bonds
issued upon the main line, less sinking iund
for the main line, is $152,245,551.
"This annual net profit shows the properties
to have earned nearly 6 per cent on the entire
amount which the Government has paid and
would pay if it were compelled to discharge
the first-mortgage bonds. This being the case,
it would seem to "be a clear business proposi
tion that the Government ought not to lose,
even if it should be compelled through fore
closure to collect its debt."
Again he Eays: "As the original Government !
bonds and first-mortgage bonds are about j
due, they might be paid off at their face value,
and as a Government 3 per cent bond is worth
more than par at the present time, there would
be no difficulty in utilizing a new 3 per cent I
bond to pay off or call in both of the other is- !
sues.
"It will be seen that if such course were pur
sued by the Government, and this property
averaged in the future the same net profit that
it has during the past ten years, it would earn
sufficient to pay 3 per cent on the bonds which
the Government would be compelled to issue
and yet leave a yearly net margin of $3,089,
--963."
Thus the Secretary clearly shows that these
roads are paying 6 per cent, and the Govern
ment can get money at 3 per cent, which
would in effect make the net receipts at least
$10,000,000 per year from the two roadsâsuf
ficient in twenty years to pay the whole debt.
Besides this, there would be over 16,000,000
acres of unpatented lands returned to the
public domain, worth at least $25,000,000. It
must be remembered that during these ten
years the Central Pacific has been leased to
the Southern Pacific and all the trade possible
diverted from it to the Southern Pacific.
There is no doubt that during the first fifteen
years of life of the roads, their earnings were
enormous through excessive tolls collected for
freights and fares.
It is probable that not less than $300,000,000
! was cleared up by their directors during this
period, and yet with all those immense profit?
the owners of these roads refuse to pay one
penny of interest on bonds, the Government
having paid $105,000,000 for them. The
i whole transaction was deliberately planned Dy
running lawyers to swindle the people, and
. that the scheme should pass the scrutiny of so
many great lawyers and statesmen then in
Congress calls Into question either their hon
esty as representatives or their capacity as
lawyers.
Where have theFe railroad earnings gone?
The immense aggregations of wealth now con
trolled by a few individuals, being the result
of the earnings of these roads, compounded
with the great Government subsidies of lands
i and bonds, are apparent to every man who has
I eyes to see. To-day, while these roads have
! contended that they were unable to pay in
j terest on these bonds, wp find that every real
j director and owner (I don't refer to numerous
â  dummies employed by real owners as direc-
I tors) have grown enormously rich.
It is apparent that there is a scheme to be
I engineered by certain parties to urge foreclos
; ure i roceedings, and have these roads imme
diately sold at prices not to exceed forty mil
lion, and thus get possession of these proper
ties cleared of all incumbrancesâ a speculation
that in the matUr of profits would discount
the Belmont-Morgan syndicate operation.
Mr. Chairman, if there is any one thing that
I railroad corporations of this country do not
i want to see it is the experiment of Government
i operation of a railroad upon an honest bisis;
I the water-soaked, sodden corporations of this
country will prevent this experiment being
| tried if in their power to prevent.
They fear the result, and so they attempt to
scare the people away from a plain bu.siness
proposition whereby they may protect and
benefit themselves. These corporations know
that in other countries government ownership
of railroads has proved a great success, and we
believe It will be a success in this country.
You have all probably read a notice in the
papers within the last few days that freights
were to be advanced 70 per cent by the South
ern Pacific Company, and from $7 to $ VI per
ton by thy Ppcific Mail Steamship Company.
As you all knuw, the latter company is a part
of the Southern Pacific system.
Now that company has renewed Its contract
with the Panama Railroad, giving it substan
tially a monopoly of that road, destroying any
competition and placing California absolutely
at its mercy, at such rates as the road may
charge, and the Pacific Mail refuses to take
freight at any price, that the same may be
forced over the railroad.
Mr. Chairman, it is time to call a halt. We
believe tiiat funding bill will be a glittering
cheat, but will only glitter till it ripens into
law; then the tinsel mask will fall away and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1896.
there will stand revealed that same old grind
ing monopoly grinning at us and saying,
"What are you going to do about it?"
The man who first gave currency to that
question learned in his lifetime that "though
the mills of the gods grind slowly they grind
exceeding fine." The American people are slow
to anger, but once aroused their power is irre
sistible, and I caution the toll-takers not to
press the producers, the common people, be
yond the limit of endurance.
Bowers was frequently interrupted by
questions asked by members of the com
mittee, but was quick-witted and ready.
He not only answered every question, but
invited attack.
Judge Barham also addressed the com
mittee, opposing the funding scheme and
favoring foreclosure. Judge Magulre said
to a Call correspondent to-nifiht:
"From the questions asked and the sug
gestions made by the members of the Com
mittee on Pacific Railroads, I judge that
the majority of the committee is already
predisposed in favor of what is known as
the 'Smith funding bill.' Under the
terms of that bill the debts are to be
funded for a period of 100 years, with in
terest at the rate of 2 Der cent per annum,
except for the first ten years, the rate for
that time to be 1 per cent.
"I do not think the difference between
that bill and the Reilly bill worth discuss
ing. Either bill would continue the
monopoly of that company for at least
fifty years, unless the States should, for
self-protection, build or in some way se
cure a new competing transcontinental
road. Of course, the Central Pacific Rail
road Company will not, except perhaps
for the first ten years, carry out the terms
of any refunding bill. Nobody expects it
to do so. But it will pay the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company for that period
to make the 1 per cent payments required
by the Smith bill in order to prevent com
petition with other railroads.
"At the end of that period the wrecked
and dismantled road, -with neither rolling
stock nor traffic, will be surrendered to the
Government, which will then, in fact,
acquire practically nothing more than
what Mr. Huntington has facetiously
called 'two streaks of dust and a right of
way.' As everybody Knows the life of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company is ab
solutely limited to fifty years, and no
contract made by that company will be
worth the paper on which it is written
after June 1,1911."

HOPEFUL OF SUCCESS.
Mi** Clara Barton and Her Party Arrive
at Southampton.
SOUTHAMPTON, Eno., Jan. 29.â The
American line steamer New York, having
on board Miss Clara Barton, president of
the American National Red Cross Society,
and her staff, who are on their way to
Turkey to distribute relief to the suffering
Armenians, arrived at her dock at 11
o'clock to-night. A representative of the
United Press boarded the steamer when
she reached the dock and secured an inter
view in her stateroom with Miss Barton
and Mr. Pullman, her secretary.
When shown by the Press representative
the announcement that the Porte had
agreed to permit persons nominated by
Hon. A. W. Terrell, the United States
Minister at Constantinople, to distribute
the fund for the relief of the Armenians,
Miss Barton said she was very glad to see
that the Sultan had accorded such permis
sion, which she considered a great conces
sion after all that had been said against
Turkey.
She preferred to say nothing concerning
her mission, except to tell the American
people ihat the committee of the Red
Cross Society had not altered its plans,
which were to proceed to Turkey and
there decide what to do. Further than
this they really had no plans.
Mr. Pullman said it was possible that
the Sultan would permit the relief fund to
be distributed under the auspices of the
Red Crescent Society, which is the Turk
ish branch of the Red Cross. If this be so,
the committee will avail themselves of the
privilege.
Miss Barton and her companions will
proceed to-morrow morning to London,
where they will remain for a few days.
They will then proceed for Constantinople,
stopping in Paris for a short rest on their
way.

WILL ACCEPT THE TEXAS.
Machinery of the yew American Battle
ship Gives Satisfaction.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 29.â A Herald
special from Washington says:
There is a strong probability that Secre
tary Herbert will accept unconditionally
the machinery of the battle-ship Texas.
All but $80,000 has been paid to the Rich
mond Locomotive Iron Works, the build
ers of the machinery, and in view of the
time that will elapse before the Texas is
again ready for sea the linn is anxious to
get its money.
For more than a year the machinery has
been completed. It gave satisfactory re
sults during dock trials at the Norfoli
Navy-yard, and on the showing thus
made the Secretary directed that all but
but $30,000 on the contract be paid,
\ the remainder to be settled when the
I official trip of the shin took place.
The trial occurred several weeks ago,
and a satisfactory run of three hours Mas
had, when the water Hooded the engine
rooms and prevented the successful com
pletion vf the trip. Then came the orders
to put the ship out of commission. An
i other trial cannot be run off until about
| six mouths hence, when it is expected that
the alterations to the battle-ship will be
completed.
The Navy Department is making prepar
ations for the trial of the torpedo-boat
Ericsson in Long Island Sound when the
weather permits. I'assed Assistant En
gineer Bryan and Assistant Engineer
Beach will represent the bureau during
the run. Upon the results obtained dur
ing this trial will depend the enforcement
of Secretary Herbert's decision to accept
the vessel preliminarily.

Robert Lout* Steventon's Friend Re"
ceives Impressions in Samoa.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. 29. â Judge
James H. Mulligan, United States Consul
to Samoa, who returned to his homo here
Saturday night, was given a banquet last
night at the Navarre. At the banquet he
made an address, the most remarkable
part of which was the following:
"When I was away off on that little
speck of land in the Pacific Ocean and
looked across the vast stretch of sea to the
storms that were agitating this country I
could see no Democrats and no Republi
cans. It was America. The English, the
Germans and all the others are against
America, no matter what the diplomats
may say.
"I feel that I have learned more in the
last two years than I have ever learned
before. I have borne my part in the bat
tics of politics, Dave spoken bitter words,
but when I stood under that mighty crag
on tliat far-away speck in the ocean and
helped to lay him to rest whom I had
learned to love and who I believe had
learned to love me, Robert Louis Steven
son, I felt that if I ever got back home
I would never speak an unkind word to a
fellow-countryman, but would do all I
could to bind ud any wounds that I may
have caused."
JUROR SOULE WAS DRUNK.
Bis Untimely Debauch Regarded as Con-
tempt of Court.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Jan. 29.â At the
opening of the trial yesterday of Dan
Keller, his wife and his sister on the
charge of murdering Clara Shanks, the
court and the counsel on both sides were
surprised to find one of the jurors drunk.
The jury had been sworn in the night be
fore but allowed to separate to arrange
their domestic and business affairs prep
aratory to a long siege in what promises
to be one of the most famous murder trials
over held in this State.
Juror Soules, a well-to-do farmer, had
been out all nijiht, and, after he had made
his devious way to the one vacant seat in
the jury-box, blinked for an hour while
the crowd stared at him and the Judge
and lawyers were consulting ns to the best
method of proceeding without the danger
of mistrial.
Finally the defense, by agreement, made
a motion to discharge the jury and excuse
permanently Juror Soules. Then the
eleven were resworn and a new juror ob
tained. Soules was placed under bond to
answer for contempt of court.

the grounds cleared for the erection of the
pavilion and it is expected that building
will commence about February 15. The
committee proposes to let the plumbing,
tinniner, painting, sewering and founda
tion work by contract. The rest of the
work will be done by day labor, and me
chanics and laborers of this city will be
given the preference. Eight hours will
constitute a day's work and mechanics
will be paid from $2 50 to $3 per day and
laborers $1 75 to $2.
The Garden City Cyclers will dedicate
the pavilion on April 25 by giving a first
class entertainment, in which only local
talent will participate.

THE TRUCKEE
ICE CARNIVAL
Excursion Trains Will Run
Next Saturday and
Sunday.
MANY PEOPLE EXPECTED
The Toboggan Slide in Fine Con
dition and the Fun Will Be
Fast and Furious.
GOOD SLEIGHING TO LAKE TAHOE
The Round-Trip Figures Nominalâ A
Healthy Outing That All Will
Enjoy.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Jan. 29. -Excursions
have been arranged for Saturday and Sun
day, and the Ice Carnival Company have
assurances of hundreds of people coming
to witness the many winter scenes of this
mountain town. The toboggan slide is in
good condition once more, and will fur
nish rare sport for the excursionists. It is
conceded by people who have experienced
it that this alone is worth a trip to Truckee.
Secretary Burckhalter of the carnival
company returned to-day from San Fran
cisco and reports that there will be at
least three carloads of people up here at
the end of the week, and the company are
preparing to entertain them on an exten
sive scale. The most enjoyable and inter
esting attraction will be a sleighride to
Lake Tahoe, which will be the first excur
sion party that has visited the lake and
seen it in the solemn and impressive
grandeur of its winter robes.
Teams, have been employed for several
days past breaking ihe road to Tahoe and
to-night the road was clear from Truckee
to the lake. It is as hara as ice and smooth
as glass and a ride over it is a treat seldom
offered to people in this State. The charge
for the round trip will be placed at a nomi
nal figure. All the sleighs have been
bountifully provided with warm rugs, and
excursionists need have no apprehension
of cold or discomfort. Ben Campbell, who
has charge of the hotel at Echo, was sur
prised to see men coming in there at this
time of the year. Usually he sees no
white men from early winter until spring,
and with the exception of a few Indians
he is the only inhabitant within a radius
of fifteen miles.
The railroad has volunteered to come to
the assistance of Truckeeites and it is
learned from Trainmaster Akers will show
an inducement to excursionists in the form
of exhibiting the mammoth rotary snow
plow in operation, which augers its way
through huge drifts of snow and out of its
funnel-shaped stack throws clouds of
beautiful snow high into the air.
In addition to this there will be the or
dinary pushplow rotary Hanger and the
headlight clow.
All in all there will be such a host of at
tractions as will be a surprise to the
most skeptical. For those who wish to
indulge in the pastime of tobogganing
while at the lake a natural slide 300 feet
long has been broken for that purpose.
Here the tobogganists may slide down the
hill between the lofty pines and stop a
short distance from the edge of the water.
Skating contests have been inaugurated,
and many experts will perform on the
glittering ice. Visitors will have an oppor
tunity of witnessing the harvesting of ice
from the ponds and see it drawn up into
the immense houses by means of an end
less chain and blocks which run down into
the water.
HIS ANTICS WERE QUEER.
Testimony of Witnesses in the
William Christ Trial at
Sacramento.
The Man Was Unnaturally Cool
and Seemed to Be in a
Dazed Condition.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 29.â Almost
all the witnesses who testified in the Christ
trial to-day claimed that they had noticed
that defendant's actions were not those of
a rational being, and, although testifying
for the prosecution, they one and all had
observed the same peculiar air and manner
in which Christ had acted when in the
presence of the dead body of his wife.
Dr. Haight, after describing the appear
ance of the room in which the woman lay,
said: "I told Christ to run back to the
house and get some ammonia, but Christ
said he did not think it was necessary, as
his wife was dead."
Witness then said that he examined the
body and found that life was extinct. He
then asked Christ to give him his revolver
and Christ did so.
Witness then told the story of the killing
as related to him by defendant. Christ
seemed to be perfectly cool. He stooped
down over the body once and said, "Oh,
my poor wife." He said this in a very
peculiar tone. He explained several times
how the shooting was done.
Once witness saw Christ step across the
body of his wife, instead of going around it.
On cross-examination, witness said that
Christ was unnaturally cool. He seemed
to be in a sort of dazed condition. His
manner was altogether out of the ordinary.
Witness did not believe that Christ real
ized what he was doing when he stepped
over his wife's body.
At the time witness took the revolver
from him he did so because he feared that
Christ might take his own life. Christ
was perfectly docile, and gave up his pistol
without a murmur.
A number of other witnesses were pnt on
the stand, but their testimony elicited
nothing new in the matter. It is thought
that the prosecution will conclude their
testimony to-morrow.

A BUTTLE ROYAL
AT SANTA CRUZ.
All the Newspaper Men of
the Seaside City Get
Tangled Up.
HOW TEE WAR BEGAN.!
Business Rivalry and an Accu
sation of Overcharging for
County Printing.
ARMISTICE DECLARED AT NIGHT
They Fought All Day With Varying
Success â One Journalist Lost
His Whiskers.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 29.â There
was a war among the newspaper men of
Santa Cruz to-day that began at noon and
kept the atmosphere of Pacific avenue
blue until after dark. The trouble started
with Phil Francis, editor and proprietor of
the Penny Press, assaulting Editor Braun,
editor of the Evening Record.
The Record last night contained a scur
rilous article reflecting on Francis without
mentioning directly his name.
Francis replied this morning through
the Penny Press with a sarcastic paragraph
deeming the article unworthy of direct
reply, as it was merely a reiteration of a
former quarrel that had been exploded.
Bat meeting Braun on the street at noon
to-day, the Penny Press man determined
to give him a drubbing. He struck him
with an ordinary cane, which was broken
by the blow. The two men then clinched
and were separated by an officer.
At 5 o'clcck this afternoon they met
again, Braun being accompanied by a
printer named Ernest Warren. Some
twenty persons who saw the second light
say that the two men first attacked Fran
cis and that he returned the assault with
another cane â one that would not break.
It was of leather with an iron rod through
it, but instead of a loaded head, as such
canes have usually, it had an ivory top.
He succeeded in knocking Braun down
and had a very lively time with the two
men.
A charge of assault with a deadly weapon
was brought against Francis, and his bonds
of $1000 for trial on Friday were given oy
D. K. Abeal and H. D. C. Barnhardt, both
well - known capitalists who are worth
$2,000,000 each.
The trouble between Francis and Braun
grows out of a charge that the Penny
Press has made against the S.ontinel and
Record, which are controlled by the same
management, of county printing over
charges.
There was alsu an old quarrel between the
two men growing out of an effort made by
the Record man some time ago to have
Francis charged with stealing 70 cents,
and which was exploded. At that time
Braun sought to have Francis put under
bonds to keep the peace, but Justice Crag
hiil, on discovering that Francis' enemies
took advantage of that to abuse him, de
clined to accept the bonds.
Within an hour after the first meeting
of the men to-day, noon, another alterca
tion occurred.
Expert Wright, whose report caused the
Orand Jury to recommend that Duncan
McPherson, editor of the Sentinel, be
prosecuted for overcharging the county for
printing, attacKed McPherson and charged
him with blackmail on account of an
article that appeared in the Sentinel this
morning. McPherson called him "a liar"
and the expert struck him and pulled a
handful of hair out of his beard. They
were separated by the officer. This after
noon the Surf published an advertisement,
"Lostâ a bunch of McPherson'? whiskers."
McPherson met Will Raymond, city
editor of the Surf, and they came near
having a real fight, but were prevented in
time.
A SANTA CRUZ COMPLAINT.
The Condition of the Southern Pacific's
S'arrotc-dauyn Causes Alarm.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., Jan. 29.â Great an
noyance and great inconvenience is caused
by the condition of the narrow-gauge line
and the lax attention given it by the
Southern Paciiic Company.
Trains and mails are irregular. Pas-
Bengers are frequently delayed and more
often transferred along the line. Last
summer some heavy blasting was done in
the vicinity of the ledge and Feiton Junc
tion, which dislodced the loose earth and
stones composing the embankments. The
winter rains have added to this and the
sides of the mountains are continually
caving and sliding on the track, to the
great danger of alt travelers.
The morning train could not get past
the slide and its passengers were brought
back to t liis city. The noon trains in and
out were transferred, and no afternoon
train or passengers got in at all. The
slide was cleared away this evening, how
ever, but the delays are serious and annoy
ing, and passengers are afraid to make the
trip. The whole road is in a eliding con
dition, so that at any minute a serious
accident might occur, as there are insuffi
cient track-walkers.
POST TOWN SEND SCANDAL.
Two Hank Officials Hue a Capitalist for
Slander,
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 29.-
Business circles here are all worked tip
over a slander suit involving $75,000 which
was begun to-day in the Superior Court by
Colonel Henry Lanaes and Robert C. Hill,
respectively president and cashier of the
First National Bank, against Francis W.
James, a well-known capitalist. James is
a School Director, and was one of the prin
cipal promoters of a case against the bank
officials to recover a bonus on bonds which
he aliened were illegally collected in nego
tiating a sale. The case created a great
sensation all over the Sound, and was
recently decided in favor of L,andes and
Hill.
STANFORD'S CARNOT DEBATERS.
Only Two Men to Uphold the I'reslige of
the University.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cat.., Jan.
20. â Stanford will be represented by I
but two debaters this year in the Carnot i
debate. By the resignation of H. D. Shel- i
don from tiie trio, but two men are left to |
uphold Stanford's prestige in the contest i
for the Conbertin prize medal. The other !
two debaters are B. I. Miller, '96, and F. I
S. Howard. 'iÂ»8. The latter is a cousin of |
Professor Howard, head of the history de- j
partment here.
According to the terms of the contest
each university may be represented by
three men, but if a university sees fit it
need send but two men into the match.
The interest taken in this debate at
Stanford has been very slight, and but live
contestants presented themselves for
honors. No preliminaries were held, but
tne faculty committee, consisting of Pro
fessors E." A. Ross and H. B. Lathrop,
assigned a set of questions, the winners to
be selected on the merits of the paper they
should present. But three papers were
prepared and handed in. Professor Lathrop
says that the chief trouble has been in
lack of interest. The topic assigned for
the paper was. "The Effect of the Decay
of Local Self-government Upon French
Political Life."
There is a possibility that Sheldon may
be induced to continue in the contest.
The debate will take place February 7.
INDIGANT NAPA STUDENTS.
They Strongly I'rotest Against the Closing
of Their Colleyc.
NAPA, Cal., Jan. 29.â The students of
Napa College are in open rebellion against
the trustees of the University of the Pacific
on account of the action of the board in
deciding to close the Napa institution at
the end of the present school term and to
centralize the educational forces of the
university at San Jose College.
An indignation meeting of the students
was held this morning at which resolutions
were adopted commending the stand
taken in behalf of Napa College by Rev.
E. M. Hill, '93, before the Methodist min
isters' meeting in San Francisco last Mon
day.
A number of passionate speeches were
made by prominent students and Chan
cellor Jewell of the University of the Pa
cific was given a severe roasting. The
students charge him with making a syste
matic right against Xapa College, and the
senior class has declared that he shall
in'ithfr sign their diplomas nor appear
upon the rostrum with them at commence*'
ment.
The students contend that the Napa Col
lege is in a more flourishing condition
linancially and in the grade of scholarship
of her students than the San Jose institu
tion. Feeling runs very high.
FISTICUFFS AT SALT LAKE
; A Cousin of Utah's New Sen
ator Attacks a Political
Enemy.
Two Encounters, in the Last of
Which Cannon Tries to Draw
His Pistol.
SALT LAKE, L'tah, Jan. 29.â An at
tack was made to-night by Angus M. Can
; non Jr., son of President Cannon of the
Mormon church, on Charles Crane. The
latter was the original organizer of the
Republican party in Utah and for a num
ber of years was chairman of the State
Committee. He opposed the election of
F. J. Cannon, cousin of Angus M. Cannon
Jr., to the United States Senate, and
Angus ha 3 since had a bitter hatred for
Crane.
lie first assaulted Crane on Main street
and apoligized for it, but later followed
him up to his office and while Mr. Crane
was seated in a chair with his fists dealt
him several blows in the face. In the
struggle which followed Cannon got the
worst of it, when Crane alleges Cannon at
tempted to draw his revolver, but was pre
vented by outsiders, who arrived in time to
probably save Crane's life.
ITALIAN WARSHIP AT ESQUIMALT.
)(Â«Â«Â» Itemonatration in Her Honor by
the Kvitisli Squadron 2'here.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 29.â The Italian
warship Christoioro Colombo, which is
soon to visit San Francisco, arrived in
Esquinialt from Vancouver to-day.
Her arrival was heralded with the boom
ing of cannon from the British squadron,
the demonstration indulged in having a
doublefold significance as marking the
twenty-third birthday of Lieutenant Prince
Luigi, nephew of King Humbert, whose
father, Prince Amadeo, was once King of
Spain. Among the festivities of the re
ception of the ship and gallant crew was
a "banquet given aboard the Colombo,
which was made the occasion of extend
ing warm congratulations to the popular
and handsome young Prince, as also an
exchange of much friendship typical of
that which now exists between Italy and
Great Britain. The Prince is studious,
youne and very anxious to secure a
thorough education in naval matters, his
great ambition being to secure a position
of rank.
According to arrangements the Chris
toforo Colombo leaves here for San Fran
cisco on Saturday.
GUNS AND BOTTLES AT NEEDLES.
A Little Diversion in Which a Party of
Mexlcmn* Were Worsted.
NEEDLES, Cal., Jan. 29.â Last Satur
day James Stewart and William Miller
were in the former's place at Bagdad when
a number of Mexicans under the influence
of liquor entered the place.
They commenced to shoot at the lights
to intimidate Stewart. Miller came to his
icscue with his gun. After the fusillade of
revolver ana rifle shot?, together with
rocks and bottles, had ceased the place
j looked as if a Kansas cyclone had struck
it. Three Mexicans were wounded and
Mr. Stewart received a severe scalp wound
from a bottle.
On Monday evening the Mexicans re- 1
turned, and one of them tried to run a '
bluff on Mr. Stewart and advanced with a j
pick. Mr. Stewart, after Saturday's j
trouble, was prepared and told him "to
stop, but he kept advancing with oaths ;
and Stewart stopped him with his gun. A !
| Coroner's jury exonerated Stewart, as he
; acted in self-defense.
Libel Suit Filed at Lot Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 29.â This
afternoon a libel suit was filed in the
United States Circuit Court against the
Times-Mirror Company, Harrison Gray
Otia and Miss Maud Irwin. The actual
damages are set. at $10,000 and consequen
tial at $15,000. This case originally came
to trial in the Superior Court, and upon
appeal to the State court the decision of the
lower court, adverse to the plaintiffs, was
affirmed.
1jOÂ» Angeles' Coroner Acquitted.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 29.â Coroner
George W. Campbell walked out of Depart
ment 1 at 12:15 o'clock to-day free of the
charge which the Grand Jury laid against
him in two indictments of perjury. The
case against him was called this morning

duced was that in the case of the death of
the child of Henry Locke. The court then
advised the jury, saying tliat there was
no purpose on the part of the doctor to
commit perjury.

The San Jose Pugilist Whips His Man in
the Second Hound.
HOLYOKE. Mass. Jan 29.â Dick Burley
of San Jose, Cal., to-night defeated Ed Mc-
Glory of Hol.voke easily. The fight, which
was under the auspices of the Paper City
Athletic Club, called for ten rounds, but
Burley had his man out in one and a half
rounds.
Jiuriey played horse with McGlory, out
classing him in weight and reach. He
knocked him down in the first round and
the men were sent to their corners before
time was called. In the second round Mc-
Glory was knocked down again, and a dis
iocated ankle put him out of the fight.

The Oregon Murderer Seems
to Have No Chance for
a Respite.
THE SCAFFOLD FRAMED.
The Doomed Boy Loses Much
of His Bravado as the
Crisis Approaches.
HE HAS PUT AWAY HIS VIOLIN.
A Prolonged Fit of Weeping Which
Created an Uproar in the Jail
Last Night.
ALBANY, Or., Jan. 29.â A message from
Lloyd Montgomery's attorneys says that
they have met with no success in obtain
ing a stay of execution or executive inter
ference, and the murderer will undoubt
edly be hanged Friday. Preparations for
Montgomery's execution are not heing de
layed by the efforts of his attorneys to
secure a stay. The scaffold is all framed.
It is not believed here that a stay of ex
ecution will be granted by the Supreme
Court.
Deputy District Attorney N. B. Hum
phrey said he did not think an order of
that kind could be expected from the Su
preme Court in view of the fact that the
case had not yet been appealed to a higher
court.
Montgomery has lost much of his bra
vado. The lively strains of his violin are
not heard so often in his cell, and he has
frequent tits of weeping. To-night he cre
ated quite an uproar in jail. He had a
prolonged and violent fit of weeping, and
declared he did not believe he could live
until Friday.
He said he could see his fatner and
mother, and they were pleading with the
officers not to haner him. After quieting
down, he asked the Sheriff to send for his
little brothers and sisters, as he wished to
see them once again. Sheriff McFerroa
has notified them of his request. Two
men are constantly with the condemned
murderer to prevent any attempt at sui
cide.
CONSUL TYSON ACQUITTED

and Some of the Tickets Still
Unpaid For.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 29.â Monsieur
H. P. Tyson, the French Consul, had a
preliminary examination this afternoon
on the charge of embezzling $63 from
Madame Marie Louise Loyez of San Fran
cisco and was discharged. Monsieur Loyez
was the only person Monsieur Tyson
recognized as'the owner of the picture out
of which the alleged embezzlement arose,
and it was for his account he tox>k upon
himself the trouble to dispose of it by raffle.
The painting was raffled off in Unirer's
saloon and the bulk of the proceeds Mons.
Tyson turned over to him. partly to make
him whole in the event that he (Unger)
should be called upon to pay a certain
oond for Loyez. Proceeds for the sale of a
number of tickets, Mons. Tyson stated,
had not yet been collected. He claimed
that in doing as he did he was not
prompted by any dishonorable motive,
but believed himself to be performing a
duty.
SESSION OF THE CIRCLES
Catholic Educational Union Has
a Literary and Musical
Meeting.
Metropolitan Temple Crowded at the
First General Gathering of the
Reading Clubs.
The first open session of the San Fran
cisco reading circles of the Catholic par
ishes was held last night in Metropolitan
Temple, and it was a full success. Every
seat in the house was occupied, and even
the aisles were filled toward the doors and
along the walls. On the preceding nights
the Educational Union was entertained
and instructed by speakers who lectured
on questions of special interest at the
present timeâ questions of a religious and
political character; but last night's efforts
were conrined to members of the different
reading circles â an open session, as it \va3
called, at which some representative mem
bers of the union read clever essays and
entertained the large audience with music
and recitations.
The papers read had a peculiar interest
for women, the subjects being "Romance,"
"Cleopatra," "Heroines of America" and
"Poems of Father Ryan," and every one of
them evinced thought, much conscien
tious study, a wise course of reading and
well-disciplined knowledge.
It was evident, judging from the ap
plause that greeted each essay, that the
efforts of the young iadics were thoroughly
appreciated and received at their true
value. It was a Catholic ladies' nightâ a
brilliant oneâ for the ladies who partici
pated acquitted themselves creditably.
The "open session," a rather decidedly
pleasant entertainment, opened with an
instrumental duet by Misses to. Parker
and A. Erwin, which was received with
applause.
Miss E. McDonald of Montgomery Cir
cle read an essay on "Romance." This
proved to be a thoughtful paper full of evi
dences &f careful reading and conclusions
âa literary criticism of considerable merit,
largely historical, yet withal a most en
tertaining and instructive paper. Miss
McDonald added to the programme title
of "Romance" "Its Rise and Character
istics.'' She held that romance was justly
the delight of all people, since it carried
men "away from the everyday world,
with its worries and cares, and carried us
off to a world of imagination, where the
heroes are all good and the heroines all
beautiful. Virtue la always rewarded aud
wickedness puuished."
"Then when the story is well written,"
she continued, "it is not only entertaining
but highly instructive. We gain an idea
of the manners and customs of different
people, a knowledge of human nature, and
learn to look upon historical characters as
real living persons, whom we love or dis
like according to their desertsâ a result
seldom attained, I am sure, by the mere
study of facts and dates,
"Virtue is rewarded and wickedness
punished. Is it not a satisfaction to find
this in a book? In this life it may not be
so evident to us, although we are sure of
it in the hereafter, and can the effect be
otherwise than to incite us to fresh efforts
to be good and true?"
The essayist went into the history of
romance, and dwelt upon its various
characteristics, its rise under different in
fluences and its effect upon different peo
ples. Coming up to the present when it
was opportune to discuss the novel of the
day, she said :
"Of late we hear a great dea< of realistic
fiction in which real life is supposed to be
depicted, but which seems to me merely
to portray the bad and flippant part of onr
nature. Although it may not be strictly
true to life, alter reading a good romantic
novel, we feel pleased with ourselves and
with our fellow-creatures, but after read
ing the so-called realistic novel, we may
think it is very clever, but it does not leave
us quite easy and satisfiedâ it leaves a kind
of bad taste.
"As there is some romance in life, let us
hope that, no matter how ordinary or com
monplace is the subject of his novel, the
author will never do away with romance,
the poetry of prose literature."
Mrs. T. H. Griffin sang "I Love Thee" in
a sweet contralto voice, with such sweet
ness that the audience insisted on an
encore, for which she gav6 "Good-by,
Sweet Day."
Miss N. Sullivan of Thomas Aquinas
Circle read an essay on "Cleopatra " This
paper was mainly Historical, though the
subject wa3 made really interesting, ana
showed that the essayist had given the
subject much thought. It was full of facts,
and portrayed Cleopatra in a true light. In
closing Miss Sullivan said:
"Neither beauty nor power can conduce
to real happiness; but after all virtue is
the only true foundation upon which
happiness rests." The paper was ap
plauded.
Miss E. McDonald of the Cathedral Cir
cle recited William Greer Harrison's poem,
"The Celtic Priest." The poem and the
pretty way in which it was given were
warmly applauded.
Miss Anna Doyle of Faber Circle read a
poem by herself, "Onward," which was
well received.
Miss Catherine Black sang "Jerusalem,"
and was loudly called out a second time.
Miss Duraind of the Cathedral Circle
read an interesting paper on "Heroines of
America," Her first heroine was Poca
hontasâthe heroine of fiction and song.
The career and example of Elizabeth Ann
Bayley were treated in glowing style.
Miss Bayley married William Seton and
while in Italy joined the Catholic church.
On her return she found old friends alien
ated. She taught school and at last be
came the founder of the Sisters of Charity
in America.
"The world knows no truer heroine than
these angels of mercy â children of Mother
Seton," said the speaker.
Dorothea Dix of Hampton, Me., born
in 1802, was another heroine. She went
from State to State doing philanthropic
work, crossed the Atlantic, and in Europe |
changed the methods of treating tlie in
sane* In the civil war b-iie lived upon the
battlefield â a merciful visitor among the !
sick and suffering.
Clara Barton, born in Oxford, Mass., in
1826, was taken as still another of Ameri
ca's noble women. She led in organizing
the Sanitary Commission, and went into
the battlefields to care for the wounded.
She also organized the Bureau of Kccords I
and traced the fate of 30,000 fallen heroes, j
She helped to organize the German hos
pital service in the Franco-Prussian war, I
was a foremost figure in the organization i
of the Red Cross Society and its tirst. presi
dent in America. "Margaret" of New
Orleans â Margaret Gaffney of Baltimore
was a heroine, whose motto was "God has
been so good to me I must be good to all."
She never asked about creed or color in
giving charity or performing her good
services.
Members of Taber Circle, all young girls,
sang in chorus "Come, Join the Dance,"
very prettily, and were called out a second
time when they gave "0 Haste, Crimson
Morning."
The last paper, which concluded the
evening's entertainment, was an essay on
"Poems o! Father Ryan," by Robert
Richards of Archbisbop'Riordan Circle.
Father Byrne announced that the
tickets of admission were exhausted and
asked that those people Holding season
tickets would either be present at future
meetings or loan the tickets to their
friends.
RED MEN AT THE BOARD
Twenty-Eighth Anniversary Ban
quet of Manzanita
Tribe.
Elaborate Menu, Followed by Toasts
and a Fine Musical and Literary
Programme.
It would have been hard to find through
out the City a more jovial gathering of
men than the participants in last night's
Danquet of Manzanita Tribe No. 4, Im
proved Order of Red Men. The occasion
was the tribe's twenty-eighth anniversary.
The larger banquet-hail of the Red
Men's building on Post street was regally
adorned for the event. The table, accom
modating over 300 guests, was arranged in
the form of a hollow square. At the four
corners were female figures iv statuary
bearing candelabra.
Clusters of waxlights illuminated the
other portions of the quadrilateral festive
board.
When champagne corks commenced to
pop, Charles L. Patton, the toast-master,
made a brief speech, after which ue an
nounced the toasts, which were as follows:
"Manzanita Tribe No. 4â The oldest of the
tribes, but one of the most zealous in its
devotion to the principles of the order,"
responded to by E. \V. Thoman, sachem
of the tribe. " The Great Council of
California," A. Jackson, great sachem.
"The Great Council of the United States,"
Frederick Brandt, great representative; "The
Young Men of the Order, the Prop of Our Old
Age," F. J. Fuller, senior sachem
of Tribe No. 4; "Our Visiting Breth

Parrish, rendered a number oi choice vocal
selections. Recitations were also Riven by
Edward M. Sweeney and Murdoch Camp
bell and vocal selections by Messrs. Finni
gan, Webbor, Golde, Gosliner, Valerga and
Parrish. Too much credit cannot be given
the anniversary committee, consisting of
William J. Smith, J. B. Griffith and Henry
A. Cfiase, for their successful endeavors.
Mr. Chase signalized the occasion by pre
senting the tribe with a collection of
badges collected by him during the last
sixteen years from'various tribes which he
has visited. The gift, enclosed in a hand
some gilt frame, was hung in the wigwam.

NOT IN A COMIC ROLE
Charles W. Swain Wants a
Legal Separation From
Mabel Hudson.
THEY ARE NOW LIVING APAET.
The Concert Hall Singer Left Her
Husband Before the Honey
moon Ended.
Charles W. Swain, the comedian ab Mo
rosco's, has sued his wife, who is known
on the variety stage as Mabel Hudson, for
a divorce. The latter is now singing in a
concert hall at Boston. She went East
over a year ago.
The couple lived together only a few
months after their marriage. They agreed
Mabel Hudson.
to disagree and have since been living
apart.
Mabel Hudson is well known in San
Francisco. Her first marriage was with
John Holmes. This alliance turned out
disastrously to both. Miss Hudson brought
suit for divorce on the grounds of cruelty
and neglect. The divorce was granted on
November 27, 1X94. On the evening of the
same day the singer and C harles \V. Swain
went to Oakland and were united in the
bonds of matrimony.
Mabel Hudson was then singing at the
People's Palace, but she left the boards at
the request of her husband. She soon
longed for the old life, however, and
despite her husband's protestations she
returned to the concert stage.
She lived with her second husband just
two months. Then sue went away and
the comedian cut off all communication
with her.
Now he brings action for a legal separa
tion through his attorney, W. H. Gobb.
Much interest is taken in the case since
the principals are well known in San
Francisco theatrical circles. Mabel Hud
son is a handsome woman. She was quite
popular at the concert halls where she ap
peared.
MR.STORY HAS RESIGNED
The President of the Home
Mutual Insurance Com
pany.
He Has Been in the Business in This
City a Quarter of a
Century.
President Charles R. Story of the Home
Mutual Insurance Company has resigned
his position and will retire from the
business.
This is one of the most important
changes that has recently occurred in the
control of the local insurance affairs, and
it was the topic of discussion among the
brokers yesterday.
Mr. Story has been concerned in insur
ance here for twenty-five years and three
years ago he became president of the
Home Mutual Company.
This is one of the California companies
issuing lire and marine policies and it was
bought up by the Fireman's Fund Com
pany, which now controls it. The stock,
it is stated, is all owned by the Fireman's
Fund Company excepting what the officers
are required to own.
Letters have been sent to all the agents
of the company, notifying them of Mr.
Story's retirement.
Mr. Story says that when he went into
insurance here a quarter of a century ago
the conditions were for a time much the
same as they are now. He expects to see
improvement come soon.
The reuson for Mr. story's resignation is
a desire to get away from active business
cares.
INSTALLED LAST NIGHT
Rev. E. H. Jinks Is Now Dr.
Mackenzie's Assistant
Minister.
Rev. Donald Ross Was the Moderator,
and Other Pastors Delivered
the Charges.
Key. E. H. Jinks of Red Bluff was in
stalled by the Presbytery as co-pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church last night.
The house of worship on Van Ness ave
nue was filled with members of the parish,
and the installation followed a full service
in which Dr. Mackenzie preached the ser
mon. Immediately after the regular ser
vice J. Cumming Smith of Trinity Pres
byterian Church delivered an able charge
to the new pastor, whose *'ood works and
worthiness were the groundwork of his
call to this City, and in a masterly way
painted a word-picture of the work before
him and the parish.
Rev. R. Ferrand, pastor of the Howard
Presbyterian Church, delivered a charge
to the ceople and called upon them to use
every power in assisting their new pastor
to build ud and foster the teachings of the
church. It was a righteous appeal to the
faithful members of the Christian people
assembled there and was in every way
strengthened with sincerity.
The Rev. Donald M. Ross acted as
moderator at the installation, as he has
frequently done before on similar occa
sions.
During the service and the installing
ceremonies the reorganized choirâconsist
ing of Mrs. Riggs soprano, Miss Daisy
Cressy contraito, Dr. G. F. Graham tenor,
and J. C. Hughes basso, under the direc
tion of Organist Otto Fleissnerâ sang in
quartets, duets and solos, "Show Me Thy
Ways," "In the Cross of Christ We Glory*"
and "The Lord Is My Shepherd, I Shall
Not Want."
The regular service closed aDout 9
o'clock, and the attendants at the instal
lation, repaired to the Sunday - school
room on the ground floor, where the ladies
had set a most sumptuous lunch and ar
ranged for a musical programme by the
selected orchestra that has been formed
from among the pupils of the Sunday
school.
A special table had been arranged in the
center of the room for all of the Presbyte
rian ministers and their wives in this City,
and the young ladies made it very pleas
ant and agreeable for them by attending
to the wants of the inner man and in every
way adding to the general pleasure that
was the order of the hour.
The tables were decorated with all sorts
of colors and chandelier effects, while the
whole was daintily set off by exotic plants
and ferns so arranged as to give the whole
place the appearance of being a floral exhi
bition. The festivities were kept ud until
about 11 o'clock, when the merry-makers
departed for their homes, confident that
their new pastor, who is to assist Dr. Mac
kenzie in guiding the destines of the First
Presbyterian Church, would be a grand ad
dition to the strength of the church and a
power to be considered in its future.
The reverend gentleman succeeds Rev.
W. C. Merrill, who is soon to depart for
Boston with a record behind him of which
any minister can be proud.
ODD FELLOWS AT PLAY.

Patrick Moran's Money.
The State is suine to have the estate of
PatricK Moran escheat to itself. Moran
died intestate in 1877, and it was only last
year that it was discovered he had a de
posit of $3400 in the Hibernia Bank. His
stepbrother in Ireland heard of it and he
wants possession of it, but the State came
in first.
The State claims the property should
have been applied for within rive years of
the owner's death, but the counterclaim is
made that the existence of the estate was
not known until a year ago. and there are
four years to run before the property can
escheat. The case has been submitted to
Judge Coffev.

All Three Reports to Be Woven
Into One Complete
Document.
THREE CLAUSES ARE OMITTED.
Friday Morning the Entire Petition
Will Be Submitted for the
Committee's Ratification.
Friend? of the anti-refunding agitationâ
nnd their name is legion on this coast â re
gret exceedingly that a dissension has
in the committee selected by the
State Ami- Refunding Convention to draft
a menu rial to Congress that shall rapre-
Bent the feeling of the people of California
on the measure now pending to refund the
Paciric railroads debt.
Nevertheless the dissension is there.
Mr. X.-tee has disagreed with the re
mainder or tne committeeâ or the re
mainder of the committee has disagreed
with Mr. Estee. The report submitted by
Mr. Estee, who is chairman of the com
mittee, was, with the exception of three
paragraphs, unanimously indorsed by the
meeting of the whole committee held at
the Mayor's office yesterday morning. It
is feared, however, that Mr. Estee will
not agree to this mutilation, for though
the stricken paragraphs are brief in words
they are yet pregnant with meaning and
mark rather plainly the line of difference
between Mr. Estee and the remainder of
the committee. The nrst of the para
graphs which are to be eliminated from
Mr. Estee' s draft for a memorial to Con
gross is as follows:
One of the reasons given for the organiza
tion oi these corporations was tliat Mr. Iluiit
iuÃton imd his associates might own and con
trol bridges and ferries on the line of the rail
roads, like the bridge over the Colorado Kiver
on the line of the Southern Paciiie Kailroad.
These bridges, although belonging to the rail
road system, built by its mouey or credit and
â forming a part thereof, are Vet apparently
owned by C. P. Huntington and his associates.
Think of one corporation owning a railroad
track on the land and another corporation
owning a uart of the same line aud belonging
to the same system, over all the main bridges
and ferries, and imagine the rent the first com
l>any would have to pay if the second company
was" unfriendly. What Bflow would amort
gage creditor have against such a combina
tion, and especially when the facts as to the
bide ownership of the bridges, and ferries were
not thought <>f or mentioned in tfie original
mortgage? What would be the effect of a fore
closun oi a mortgage on the main line under
such circuit- ' '- most the mortgagee
would only obtain pieces of railroad tractâ an
owner under a mortgage sale made pursuant
to the terms of the Government mortgage
could i.ot move a train over the line of the
Central Pacific Kailroad. liuntinjrton and his
i'es in ihe Pacilic improvement Com
pany would still command the situation.
The second clause to be eliminated is
that which touches directly on the ques
: Government foreclosure. It reads
as ivl
Whatever difference of opinion may exist
us to whether foreclosure ot
the Government mortgage on this property is
the correct remedy, or whether such steps
; be taken a> will secure to the Govcrn
j-\ nership of a line of railroad from the
Pacific to tne Missouri River, there is but one
ent among our people on the proposi
tions.
The reason for eliminating the foregoing
. raph, ;ts stated yesterday at the com
mittee meeting in the Mayor's office, was
tliut the memorial committee was esne-
cially instructed by the convention
which gave it existence to draft a memo
rial declaring, lir.-t, against refunding the
debt, and second, in favor of foreclosure
by the Government. It was unanimously
decided by the committee that to go con
trary to these instructions would be to fail
in their duty of representing the will of
â ople of California. Mayor Davie of
Oakland, who originally signed Mr. Estee'a
report and agreed with him on the point
of not demanding the foreclosure, yester
day voted with the rest of the committee
to expunge this paragraph.
Tne third clause to be omitted reads as
follows:
We do not ask that the dead be arraigned at
the l.ar o; public opinion, or thru worthy
women be sued, or that a great university be
dismantled, but we do demand that the chief
actor and most commaudiuÃ figure in this
great iraud be brought to the bar of public
It was further voted by the committee
yesterday mat Mr. Estee's report, thus
amended" and coupled with the drafts sub
mitted by Jonn T. Doyle and Henry E.
Highton, should be tbe authorized memo
rial of the committee. And Henry E. High
ton was appointed to amalgamate the
three reports, weave them together in an
acceptable manner and submit the entire
document to tne committee, thus con
structed, to a final meeting of the commit
tee, which is to be held at the Mayor's
office Friday morning at 10 o'clock.
Judge Gibson of Oakland, one of those
whose names were signed to the report
submitted by Mr. Estee. declared to the
committee yesterday that he had not
authorized "the signing of nib name to an
individual report, but that he had only )
authorized Mr. Esiee to place his name to
any memorial that should be adopted by
the committee.
A. Caininetti and Marion Gibson, both
residing out of the City at some distance,
were absent from the committee meeting
yesterday morning and could not there
fore be heard from on the question as to
whether they had given Mr. Estee consent
to sign their names to his individual re
port.
Mr. Estee was also absent from the
meeting. Those present were: Mayor j
fcutro, Mayor Davie, Henry E. Hifihton,
Judge E. M. Gibson and John T. Doyle,
being a clear majority, or five of the eight j
committeemen.
All the documents that are to be woven
into the memorial are considered very i
strong arguments and plain statements of i
the position taken on the question in
volved by the people of California, and it
is thought that the entire committee, with
the possible exception of Mr. Estee, will
readily sign the completed memorial and
heartily indorse it. It is not thought un
liKely, either, that Mr. Estee will also sign
the amended and amalgamated document.
In that case the memorial will go to Con
gress with added strength and as express
ing the united sentiments of the eight
men chosen to represent in this matter all
the people of California.
MR. ESTEE'S DENIAL.
The Chairman of the Committee Re-
Iterates That He Had Author
ity to Si?n the Names.
Morris M. Estee, chairman of the com
mittee selected to draft a memorial to
Congress against the refunding act, pro
test?, in the following communication to
The Call, that he had ample authority to
Bigs the names which appeared under the
report submitted by him to the commit-
W-. His communication is as follows:
San PBAKCUOO, January 29, 1896.
Editor Callâ My J>kai: Siu: Contrary to my
usual practice! in the pÂ»t>t, 1 venture to write
h loiter contradicting what the Mayor of ban
Kranctsco has falsely stated of my position in
the report made by me regarding
Funding bill.
1. As to his statement that he appointed me
chairman "f the committee named to draft a
memorial Co Congresa "pimply hs a matter of
courtesy" I have nothing to say. for lean jciiow
nothing ol hits reasons for making such ap
aent
ter be lia<l made the appointment and I
had a< nine, then it wasdue to the
r.:i<i to mysell that I should perform
me duty .isi,:gned'nie not as the Mayor wanted
me to, hut as my own coiibcieuce jind best
judgment dictated.
'S. 1 prepared that memorial with the advice
and counsel of all the members of the commit
tee but oneâ every member of the committee,
including the Mayor, but one, having been
present at two meetings at which the memo
rial prepared by me was read. The whole mat
ter was fully discussed by all the members
present. A majority of the committee in
dorsed the memorial made by me, because it
seemed to be a concise statement of the facts,
and it was thought Congress wanted facts and
not recommendations. A minority of the com
mittee wished to petition Congress to foreclose
the mortgages on the railroads, although the
United States stutute now gives to the Presi
dent and Secretary of the Treasury full power
in this regard.
The majority of the committee believed that
tho great tight was to defeat the refunding
bill, because if the bill was passed there could
be no foreclosure of the mortgages. If the re
funding bill was defeated then the statute of
the United States passed on the 3d of March,
l>7>>. in express terms, makes it the duty of
the President and the Secretary of the Treas
ury to foreclose these mortgages.
The Mayor of San Francisco has seen lit to
publish to the community that I have sur
reptitiously got the signatures of a majority of
this committee. The iaets are these:
After Mr. Cannon had heard read the me
morial prepared by me, rik' he had made two
or three suggestions which were adopted by
the committee, he authorized me to sign his
name to thut report, and 1 did so.
1 hold the dispatch of Mr. Caminetti, who
also had heard it read and who made some
valuable suggestions in relation to it which
were also adopted, and which dispatch reads as
fo lows-
M. M. Estee. San Francisco : Yes. I authorize
you to sigu for me. A. Caminetti.
I hold also the dispatch of Judge Gibson, who
had been notilied both by letter and telegram
to attend our meetings, but who, owing to ill
ness, was unable to be here, and who, in a let
ter addressed to me. staled that he could not
be present, but thst he would conform to our
wishes in the matter. I then telegraphed him
and asked him if we should sign his name to
the report, and at the same time tequested
Mayor Davie of Oaklund to see him und ex
plain to him the contents of the report. His
answer, addressed to me, is as follows :
M. M. Estee. San Francisco : Yes, you sign
my name to the report. E. M. (Jibson.
Mayor Davie signed his own name to the re
port "written by me.
So much for the false charges made by
Adolph Butro against myself in relation to my
surreptitiously signing the uames of members
of that committee to this report.
I feel almost ashamed to make any reply to
these charges. However, in a matter of such
public gravity, iv which every citizen should
be united, and as Adolph Sutro happens to be
I Mayor of San Francisco, and people who do not
know him might believe him, I am compelled
to say this much In defense of my personal
honor. Had it been a political proposition I
should have treated these charges with the
contempt they deserve; but as it attacks my
personal integrity and my honor I feel it my
duty to tell the people exactly the truth.
Yours respectfully, If. M. Estee.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Continued Success of "In Old
Kentucky" at the Cali
fornia.
Veiled Allusions in "A Canting
Scoundrel " at the Alcazar â " Uncle
Tom's Cabin."
"In Old Kentucky" continues to afford
satisfaction to large audiences at the Cali
fornia Theater. The cleverly constructed
play is sufficient in itself to appeal to the
theater-going public, but in the present
performance the playwright's efforts are
not only enhanced by an excellent all
round performance, but are also eked out
by some remarkably clever specialties,
which served as a foil to the melodramatic
incidents which occur during the course
of the performance.
The pickanniny band is one of the best
bit? among the "specialties," so to speak,
which abound during the course of "In
Old Kentucky." The colored children evi
dently enjoy their part in the evening's
entertainment quite as much as the audi
ence does, and they act with a spirit and
abandon which add immensely to the
mirth aroused by the comedy part of the
play. Taken altogether, with its thrilling
racing scene, its sensational leap across
the canyon and atrone local Kentucky
flavor, the melodrama now running at the
California Theater is one of the best per
formances that has been seen in this City
for a long time.
"Men and Women" at the Columbia
Theater is one of the most successful per
formances yet produced by the Frawley
Company. Macklin Arbuckle and Gecrge
Osborne. among the "men," are especially
at home in their roles, and the "women"
are all so good that it seems invidious to
make distinctions between them.
"The Editor" continues to please the
audiences at Morosco's by its breeziness
and its suitability to the company that is
performing it. Swain is in his element as
Tim the Porter, and Coulter Brinker is es
pecially suited to the part of Stephen
Marton.
The more or leas veiled allusions to local
people of light and leading in church cir
cles which "A Canting Scoundrel" con
tains are proving interesting conundrums
to the audiences at Grover's Alcazar. The
play contains plenty of fun and is acted in
a sprightly manner.
Dr. Bissell's lightning modeling is
teaching Orpheum audiences how to make
a portrait bust while you wait, and the ex
cellent likenesses achieved by the model
er's apparently haphazard way of pelting
a board witn handfuls of clay proves a
never-failing source of delight to the be
holders. Rachael Walker's singing is
meeting with more success this week than
ever.
"liion" will be succeeded next Monday
at the Tivoli by "The Gentle Savage."
The Bush-street Theater is to see a per
formance of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," next
week which has been spoken of in high
terms in other cities. The Cook Twin
Sisters' Company wiil play the favorite
drama.
Tbe Pan Francisco Symphony Orchestra
wiil give a grand concert on Friday after
| noon in Golden Gate Hall. The following
; programme will be performed: Overture to
; "Titus," Mozart ; Transcription, "Faust."
j Gounod; Vorspiel, "Lohengrin," Waener;

REVERSED ITSELF.
The Supreme Court Hag Changed Front
on a Sun Francisco
Appeal.
Filed Dec. 30, 1895.|Fiijcd Jan. 29, 1896.
Tne order appealed | We think the order
from is reversed, and below was right in
the court below is di- both respects appealed
rected to modify its from, and it follows
order so as to direct that it should be af
and require the satis- firmed, each appellant
faction of the judg- to pay his own costs
merit in full, incluo- on appeal,
ing both damages and â¢
costs.
These paragraphs are the conclusions
of opinions filed in the case of Hannah
Butler against Thomas Ashworth, Super
intendent of Streets, a suit to recover
damages for destruction of property by a
pooriy constructed sewer.
The plaintiff sued first for the breaking
of the sewer and for the neglect to repair
the same, and for the improper manner
in which the sewer was repaired. The
plaintiff recovered judgment for $1190 and
costs. Wituin two years after the plaintiff
sought to recover damages for the same
breaKing of the sewer, and she again got
judgment for $800 and costs. Tne court
reversed this last judgment from which
an appeal was taken on December 30,
1896. The court below refused to .make
this $394 part of the judgment, and it was
this order which was reversed. It was
this order also which has been affirmed
upon more mature consideration by the
court.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1896.
WENT TO BRIGHT PHÅBUS
The Realization Winner Took
the Naglee Stake Galloping
From Crescendo.
ABLY RIDDEN BY MILLER
Outsiders in the Betting Won Most of
the Pursesâ Coleman the Only
Favorite First.
Even the announcement that those two
great performers Bright Phoebus and Cres
cendo were to meet in a stake event failed
to attract more than the ordinary crowd of
race-goers to the Bay District track yester
day. This fact is attributable, no doubt,
to the downtown "commission joints."
The betting, too, was sluggish, very little
big money being in circulation in the ring.
Naclee Burkes crack son of Flambeau
and Millionaire Hobart's winner of the
classic Realization stake came together in
the Naclee handicap over a distance of
seven furlongs. The total value of the
stake was $1500, of which amount $1200
went to the winning horse. Of the original
fifty four entries, all declined the handi
cappers' allotment of weights but four.
The conditions of the stake called for two
and three year-olds of 1895, and the weights
were assigned accordingly. As a clever
sample of the handicapper's art, the race
was a complete failure. Crescendo was
asked to give away pounds to Bright
Phoebus, and this in the sticky going, for
which the latter has an especial fondness.
In spite of this, Crescendo, with his 118
pounds, opened a 6 to 5 favorite in the
"THE CALL" RACING CHART.

but Rosebud went betreing at 20 to 1.
There was but slight delay at the post,
Ferguson sending them away well fined
up. George Miller, on Bright Phoebus,
had his mount well in motion when the
flag fell and was first to show in front. He
held the lead until swinging in the back
stretch, where Doggett, on Star Ruby, let
out a wrap and the imported horse's
friends were in high spirits as they saw
him full of run, a length in front. At the
half Rosebud was at bis head, followed
half a length away by the favorite. Bright
Phoebus was a length further off.
On the far turn Sloan on Crescendo took
his horse out wide on the dry going and
moved for the lead. In this he was suc
cessful, for, as the stretch for home was
reached, Crescendo hard ridden, was a
length in the lead, with Bright Phoebus at
his heels, merely galloping. The weight
was now telling heavily on the favorite,
and despite Sloan's desperate efforts to
keep the lead Bright Phoebus assumed
command of things over a furlong from
the wire and won by a length under re
straint. Nearly a dozen lengths away
Rosebud took third place from imp. Star
Ruby in a hard drive.
The winner was beautifully handled by
George Miller, and it was, indeed, a
pleasure to see this accomplished horse
man at his very best.
The balance of the racing was very ordi
nary. The colors of the favorites loomed
up in front on but one occasion, ousiders
predominating.
The day's sport opened with a big upset.
Carrie M*was sent to the post a heavily
backed 2 to 1 favorite, with University
almost as strongly supported at 11 to 5.
In a drive Jack AtKins, a 10 to 1 shot, cap
tured the race by a length from Peixotto,
another outsider.
Summertime was a prohibitive favorite
for the following event, a short six-furlong
run for mares, the books holding her at
Ito 3. She was never able to head Levena
C, and although ridden hard from start to
finish was beaten out a length and a half.
Gussie made a good showing, finishing
third.
A cheap lot of "dogs" started in the
fourth race at five furlongs. Coleman was j
made a warm 7 to 5 choice and won pull
ing up, fully a dozen lengths in front of
Addie M. Dorsey was a good third.
Old Cicero did not have his jumping
boots on and let the crowd down hard in
the steeplechase. He was balked down
froir twos to 7 to 5 and failed to get
a mark. The second choice. Colonel
Weightman, took the lead at the third
i"ump and yon in a common canter, witu
OC in the place. Galindo brought the
outsider, Adelante, in third.
The selling platers had another go at 5
furlongs in the last event on the card.
The 2 to 1 favorite, Clare N, loomed up
prominently in front until well on toward
the wire, when she began tiring and wound
up an ordinary third. Clara Johnson won
easily by threa lengths, with Catalogue in
the piace.
Track and Paddock Items.
Tom Griffin was reported to hare bet
$500 on his mare Carrie U, the favorite in
the opening race.
The Call is in receipt of a handsomely
bound copy of the "American Turf Con
gress Rules" from the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club, for which it returns thanks.
Tod Sloan stated after the stake race
that he did not think Crescendo could
have beaten Bright Phoebus on any kind
of a track yesterday. Mr. Burke has given
the name of Dolce to the big colt's two
year old sister.
Gorgon, by Racine, from the grand mare
Gorgo, is a very racy-looking individual
and is very apt to bring the name of his
sire into prominence.
Through the error of an operator the
poolroom on Glasgow street laid 3to 1
against Summertime. When the error
was discovered there was a big "kick"
among the proprietors, and at one time
they seriously considered declaring bets
off. The track odds were Ito 3.
Cicero took the first jump in the steeple
chase in the lead of the field, but he was
in the air so long that when he alighted
on the opposite side he was the tail-ender.
THEY WANT MORE LIGHT
Waiting to Hear "The Call"
Man's Testimony on the
Baden Accident.
Conflicting Evidence Given as to the
Time the Washout Occurred â The
Roadbed Was Low.
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Jan.
29. â The jury impaneled by acting Coro
ner E. E. Cunningham to hold an inquest
over the body of Engineer Keyer, who
was killed in the Baden accident, held an
other lengthy session to-night and ad
journed without accomplishing any actual
work.
Two new witnesses were called, Joseph
Morgan and Antone Buffet. Both were
very willing witnesses, though their testi
mony was mostly hearsay. Both swore
that Tilton told Watchman Murphy that
the water was over the track and it was
his duty to Hag the train.
"With the conclusion of this testimony
there followed a long wrangle among the
jury as to the advisability of bringing in a
veniict without securing the testimony of
Fireman Gill or J. P. Reynolds, the re
porter for The Call who was with Murphy
when the latter made a desperate but fu
tile effort to attract the attention of En
gineer Keyer. Juryman Neff was out
spoken in his desire to have the jury reach
a verdict. It was finally decided, how
ever, to adjourn over until Saturday morn
ing at 10 o'clock, when an effort will be
made to ! aye Loth Fireman Gill and Mr.
Reynolds present.
There seems little reason to doubt that
two-thirda of the jury are inclined to fix
the blame on Watchman Murphy, although
the ten witnesses so far examined have
given no evidence to show that the watch
man did not show the danger signal.
Every witness seems to be very much at
sea as to time. Section Foreman Wren
testified that he was at the scene of the
fatal disaster at 5:20 and that later he sent
an assistant back over the track. At that
time the water was not running over the
track and there was no reason to expect
the flood, which came almost as soon as
their backs were turned.
Antone Buffet swore that the bulkhead,
which the railroad people claim caused
the washout, broke between 4 and 5 o'clock
in the afternoon. This assertion is cor
roborated by others, though the time is set
from half to three-quarters of an hour
later. If Buffet is correct is it difficult to
understand how it is that the great volume
of water just released did not reach the
end of Mr. Wren's beat until after s:iO
o'clock, and had not even begun to gather
when he says his assistant appeared on the
scene some minutes later.
W. J. Martin, agent of the South San
Francisco Land and Improvement Com
pany, is the only man who bears out the
statement of Murphy, though even tuia is
in a faint-hearted sort of way. He saw a
light near the bridge just above whore the
accident occurred, and the light, whether
it was white or red he could not say, ap-
Deared to wave.
If the suggestion of acting Coroner Cun
ningham is followed, the Southern Pacific
will come in for a certain amount of cen
sure whether the jury find Murphy guilty
of criminal neglect, or the railroad merely
lax in its track-walking system.
When the new line by way of South San
Francisco was completed three years a;>o
the swamp lands between here and Colma
were thought capable of producing trouble
at any time. To obviate this as much as pos
sible the railroad was raised an average of
eight feet. The heavy rains of the last two
years have washed in so much loam and
debris as to practically level the bed. It is
now on an average of" only about two feet
above the swamp. When a heavy rain
comes it is matter of a few hours only for
the swamp to become entirely covered with
wat r.
The bursting of the bulkhead, whether
it occurred at sor 6 o'clock, threw such a
volume of water against the thirty-foot
culvert as to completely block it up.
Something had to give way, and it did, in
the shape of the loose sou and gravel of
which the embankment is made.
It is contended by Mr. Cunningham that
had the Southern Pacific kept the roadbed
at its original height the storm of Sunday
could not possibly have done any harm, as
the culvert wouln easily have carried away
three times the amount of water suddenly
released by the breaking of the Spring Val
ley bulkhead.
LANG QUONG SHOT HIM.
VerdJct of the Coroner's Jnry at the
Inquest Yesterday on the Body
of Yung Vow.
The jury at the Coroner's inquest on the
body of the Chinene, Yung Vow, who was
shot in Lou Fat's disreputable den in
Bartlett alley on the night of Friday, the
24th inst., brought in a verdict yesterday,
charging the murder to Lang Quong, who
is now under arrest.
According to the statements made by
Laundiymen Hoo Woey of 827 Clay street,
Wong "Fong of 10 Church alley and
Laborer Owe Foo, who lives on Stockton
street, between Jackson and Pacific, Lang
Quong started the quarrel over a, glass of
liquor, and challenged Yung Vow to go
outside and have a duel with him with
pistols then and there. On the advice of
friends Yuna- Vow went outside with him
and Lang Quong fired three shots at him.
There were eleven men and three women
in the <len at the time. The names of tha
men are Lang Quong, Yung Vow, Owe
Foo, Hoo Woey, Wong Fong, Dong
Chung, Quan Chat, Tsang Yee, Weng Bin,
Wong Ho and Lou Sing, and those of the
women Fong Lean, Ah Gum and King Fa.
WANTED, A LEADING MAN.
Frank Armstrong Did Not Sail
With the Carrie Warde
Company.
THE ORLANDO OF STANFORD
A Well-Known Actor Who Has De
serted a Starving Wife
and Child.
There was an exciting scene at the wharf
yesterday morning, just before the steamer
National City sailed for Eureka. On board
were the Carrie Clark Warde Company,
bound for a theatrical season in Eureka,
to be followed by an extended tour of the
northern counties.
What spread consternation in the ranks
of the company was that Frank Arm
strong, the dashing leading man, who
had been engaged especially for the tour,
came not and inquiry developed the fact
that he had sent no baggage on board.
The telephone was put into requisition
and messengers were dispatched in haste
to visit Armstrong's favorite haunts, but
all to no purpose. The leading man had dis
appeared. Another actor, who guaranteed
to play lover's roles with as much in
tensity as Armstrong, was induced to rush
on board at the last moment and the com
pany set sail for Eureka, giving thanks
that it had providentially been spared the
painful embarrassment of beginning its
tour without a leading man.
On the wharf an officer of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
had been an interested spectator of the
company's tribulations. When the anxi
ety to find Armstrong was at its height he
stepped on Doard. and all but exasperated
the manager by inquiring pleasantly: "Is
there a man narara Frank Armstrong in
your company?"
"I wish there was," replied the manager,
devoutly; "he ought to be here, but "
The officer held a warrant for the arrest
of the missing man on the charge of de
serting his wife, Junie Armstrong, and
their young child and leaving them en
tirely destitute. It was then that the
manager decided that Armstrong's services
were not needed by. the company, though
he had no opportunity of formally telling
the actor so, for, though the officer waited
and watched till the steamer sailed away,
the leading man did not materialize, aiid
all efforts to find him yesterday proved
unavailing.
Frank Armstrong will be remembered

THE POT CALLED THE KETTLE BLACK
BECAUSE THE HOUSEWIFE
DIDN'T USE
SAPOLIO
as the handsome, dashing actor who
played Orlando to Miss Pauline French's
Rosalind in the "As You Like It" per
formance at Stanford a few months ago.
His manly, spirited acting "under the
greenwood tree" won any amount of ap
plause and made the matinee maidens
declare that he was "just lovely." It was
a case of masks and faces though, for the
careless Orlando knew what it was to want
for a square meal himself, and he knew
also that in a poor room on Sixth street
his wife and little child were almost
hungry at that moment.
Speaking of tne Stanford engagement
S. Friedlander of the Columbia Theater
said yesterday: "Armstrong is quite a
well-known California actor, and he never
need be a day out of a position if he would
give up h is dissipated habits. When he
asked me to take him on as Orlando I
guessed he would act the part to perfec
tion, though he looked to me to be starv
ing, in spite of his dashing, manly bearing.
He made a I it as Orlando and he was well
paid for playing the part.
"Last week, during the run of 'The
Ensign,' Macklyn Arbuckle was playing a
part that was very exacting on the voice,
and, as he wanted to reserve his energies
for 'Men and Women,' we had to find a
substitute. 'There is only one man here
who can play that part perfectly,' I said,
'and that is Frank Armstrong.' We sent
for him, but in his place came his wife
with a littie baby in her arms, saying he
had disappeared two days before."
At the Alcazar, where Armstrong played
until a couple of weeks ago, the statement
was made that nothing was known about
him, except that he had been dismissed
from the company.
The young wife of the missing actor,
with her baby, is at 28^ Sixth street in an
entirely destitute condition. The As
sociated Charities sent her a few immedi
ate necessities yesterday, and the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
is striving to locate the missing husband.
Olh'cer Holbrook stated yesterday that it is
believed he has run away with an actress
to whom he has been paying considerable
attention of late.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
California is in danger.
Now is the time to protest.
The refunding scheme is infamous.
We cannot accept Hote Smith as a
referee.
Bonds for 100 years at 2 per cent 1 Think
of that.
Smith introduced the bill of abomina
tions, but who wrote it?
The Reilly bill was bad, but the Smith
bill discounts it.
The wnolo Pacific railroad muddle can
be settled in the one word: foreclosure.
Now that the monopoly has shown its
hand all the world can see how unclean
it is.
As a bond fiend Mr. Smith is even more
abominable than Cleveland and without
half his excuse.
Surely no Californian can hesitate to
oppose such a refunding scheme as that
which is now proposed.
The people will have to wait a long time
to hear any one explain the "equities" of
ttie latest refunding scheme.
The refunding biil has been referred to
Hoke Smith, and there is no telling what
hocus pocus may come next.
Smith's refunding scheme cannot possi
bly be made decent by any amendment; it
must be blotted out altogether.
While every nation on earth seems
eager to offer England a lizht, Turkey is
oiling for one and can't get it.
When Grove L. Johnson needs enlight
enment he should apply to his constitu
ents, and not to the attorneys of the rail
road.
The proposition to refund the debt of
the Central Pacific for 100 years at 2 per
cent is in plain terms a proposal of in
famy.
The fight against the refunding scheme
has reached the critical point, and those
who intend to oppose it at all must oppose
it now.
It may prove a fortunate thine in the
end that the railroad asks so mucn, for
those who show themselves too greedy
very often get nothing.
We shall see from the vote on the coast
defense bill just how far the Senate was
moved by a war spirit, and how far by a
desire to make speeches.
Pattison of Pennsylvania is coming for
ward as a Democratic candidate for the
Presidency, but he can hardly be called
promising, for he cannot promise to carry
his own State.
Railroad Attorney Tweed says if the re
funding biil passes freights will not be
raised on the Central Pacific because of
the conjpetition, but where is the competi
tion to come from ?
Since the Government of the United
States cannot borrow money for Jess than
3 per cent, why should it lend money to
the railroad for 1 per cent for ten years
and for 2 per cent for ninety years?
Every board of trade, every industrial
organization, every newspaper and mass
meetings in every city and town in Cali
fornia should send protests against the
passage of the Smith biil, and should send
them at once.
The London Chronicle favors a move
ment among the powers to get the United
States to stop the barbarism of Turkey,
Congress favors a movement to get tbe
powers to do it, and so the world's move
ments go on while the Turk remains where
lie is and does the same old business in
the same old way.
It was asserted by the free-traders that
free wool would promote the manufacture
of woolen goods in tnis country, but the
result of the experiment for a year shows
that British manufacturers of such goods
sold us four iimes as much in 1895 as in
1894, and during the same period the im
portations of foreign wool increased 150
]>er cent.
The Chicago Newt Almanac for the cur
rent year gives a list of American
women who since 1870 have married titled
foreigners, together with the amount of
their dowries so far as known. The ag
greeate of known dowries amounts to
$.170,653,000, and it is estimated the un
known amounts will raise this sum con
siderably above $200,000,000.
When the Democratic National Commit
tee met to select the site for the party con
vention some of the onlookers in Washing
ton endeavored to find out the Eentiment
of the committee on the Presidential ques
tion, and while, of course, nothing positive
was learned, the conclusion was that the
eilver men of the party have no candidate
ir.id the gold men are in favor of Olney.
The argument for the establishment in
tiic National Government of a Department
of Manufactures and Commerce is ably
expressed in an open letter addressed to
the Chicago convention of the National
Association of Manufacturers by Richard
!!. Edmonds of the 31 anu fact tire rs' Record,
Baltimore. The movement is an important
one, and will doubtless receive the support
of all who have given the subject the
study it deserves.
TIME TO PROTEST.
If any Californian has indulged the
pleasing hope that the defeat of the Reilly
bill in the last Congress had taught mod-
eration to the railroad monopoly and that
there was no pressing need of an aggres-
sive fight against anything it might ask of
this one. that hope was rudely shattered
by the publication in The Call yesterday
I of a synopsis of the Smith bill, which the
House Committee has approved, referred
to the Secretary of the Interior and will
I probably report to Congress.
Bad as the Eeilly bill was the Smith bill
is worse. It contains every objectionable
feature of the most extreme demands of
the railroad and offers no compromise with
the sentiment of the people or with a due
regard to the public welfare. Despite the
fact that in the Cleveland loans the Gov
ernment itself has had to pay a fraction
more than 3 percent for money, the bill
provides that in computing the debt due
Government by the Central Pacific, money
sball be estimated as worth only 2 per
cent. It further Drovides that when the
total indebtedness has been thus com
puted the debt shall be funded by issuing
bonds to run for 100 years; for the first
ten of which the interest is to be 1 per cent
and for the remaining ninety years 2
per cent.
This scheme, if carried through, will
fasten the cinch of the monopoly upon Cali
fornia and the great central road across the
continent for a century to come, and will
impose upon the industry and commerce
of that region a heavy burden of debt to
be paid off through exacting freight rate 3
extorted by the monopoly which the debt
itself has been the means of perpetuating.
The most greedy and grasping of monopo
lies could not ask more than has been pro
posed in this scheme. It is in plain terms
an infamous proposal. There is not a re
deeming feature in it. It carries millions
for the monopoly and not a cent for the
people, and moreover violates every law of
justice and every principle of finance, In
order to continue the power of a corrupt
and corrupting corporation.
It is significant that this measure, ap
proved by the Pacific Roads Committee in
secret session, was sent to the Secretary of
the Interior for his opinion. That means
of course that Cleveland is to be consulted.
Before Congress has a chance to discuss the
measure, even before it is reported to Con
gress, the big bond-dealer of the White
House and his Secretary, Hoke Smith, are
to give it their approval. By this scheme
it is made certain that if the bill passes in
Congress the President will sign it. It
must be beaten, therefore, either in the
House or in the Senate. That is the issue
now' before us and to that issue every
energy should be directed. Every Board
of Trade or Chamber of Commerce, every
industrial organization, every newspaper
and every city and town in the State by
mass-meetings or by its official authorities
should send protests against the bill and
send them at once. Tne danger is immi
nent and the infamy is threatening.
TOBACCO IN CALIFORNIA.
The success which tobacco-growing has
enjoyed for years in the southern end of
the Santa Clara Valley has induced a
strong movement to engage in the indus
try. It has never been a question that
tobacco would nourish in this State, the
more important considerations being the
quality of the product and the cost of la
bor. On the score of quality it has been
asserted that while the crops are bountiful
the product is coarse in texture and heavy
in essential oils, the principal one being
nicotine. It might be expected that in a
country where, under liberal irrigation,
vegetation tends to rankness tobacco would
develop a coarse fiber; but as this depends
solely upon its method of treatment dur
ing its growing it can be governed almost
with mathematical precision. As for an
abundance of essential oils, that is as valu
able a thing in tobacco as an excess of su
gar is in wine grapes. There is an unfail
ing market for "strong" tobacco.
Cotton will grow better in California
than in the South, but it is not cultivated
hero because of the absence of cheap labor.
The same condition operates in the case of
tobacco culture. But within recent years
there has grown up within the State the
employment of children in the fruit-drying
industry, and as the labor is light, pleas
ant and profitable the country schools gen
erally time their vacations to suit the fruit
drying season.
The heavy labor required in the cultiva
tion of tobacco is similar to that employed
with other crops. There is, howevei, a
vast amount of light work to be done, par
ticularly in keeping the plants Iree from
worms. Children could do this with
creater ease and celerity than adults, and
their labor might be profitably employed.
The opium poppy will grow well in Cali
fornia, but it is not cultivated because of
the expense of labor. Tea, also, would
doubtless thrive, but it would be impos
sible to compete with the cheap labor
which produces it in China and Japan.
j Considering the higher and more prolit
i able results which can be made to attend
fruit-growing, it hardly seems worth whiie
to experiment with staples which are pro
duced elsewhere with the aid of degraded
labo.\ Far more inviting than experi
ments of that kind are the possibilities
which lie undeveloped in the Slate, and
! which are features of the monopoly which
' California enjoys in this country as the
producer of fine fruits and wines.
The extraction of perfume^, from odor
iferous plants which grow here in so re
j markable luxuriance should be developed
into a profitable business, as it would be
one iv which women and children could
find pleasant, profitable and healthful
exercise. Silk culture remains to receive a
more thorough test.
TALKING OF MONEY.
The rapid publication of books and pam
phlets on the silver question, which, fol
lowing thick and fast in the wake of Coin's
Financial School, formed so striking a fea
ture of the financial discussion last year,
promises to be repeated this season. The
year is young yet and the opening of the
Presidential campaign is still far off. but
already no less than three new books ad-
vocating with more or less wisdom the re
monetization 01 silver have been sent to
us by the publishers.
One of these books, "Statesmen Three,"
issued by the Statesman Publishing Com
pany of New York and written by A. C.
Fisk, hardly deserves comment, and is not
likely to find favor among intelligent ad
vocates of bimetallism. It represents the
whole of our financial legislation since the
outbreak of the Civil War as having been
dictated by a conspiracy of bankers, refers
to the demonetization of silver as "The
One Hundred Billion Dollar Robbery,"
and even goes so far as to insinuate that
the assassinations of Lincoln and Garfield
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1896.
were committed at the instigation of the
conspirators of the money power.
A much more reliable book is "The Ef
fects of the Gold Standard, or Bimetallists'
Catechism," by W. H. Smith, M.D., pub
lished by Charles H. Kerr & Co. of Chi
cago. There is much in this book that
will repay the reader who wishes to study
the subject without resorting to the more
abstruse and technical works on finance.
It is not likely to prove so popular as
"Coin's Financial School," but is never
theless written in a simple direct style
easy to be understood, and will have con
siderable effect in determining waverers to
take a decided stand in favor of the free
coinage of silver.
Quite different from the other two in
styie and method of treating the problem
is the' third work, "Money and the Money
Power." This is a compilation of a series
of articles contributed to the Middlebury
(Vt.) Register by Joseph Battle and is pub
lished by the Register Company. The
value of the compilation is largely en
hanced by the fact that in addition to the
articles of the author it includes all the
important laws of the United States rela
tive to money, several notable essays by
high authorities in England on the effect
of the gold standard on British manu
factures and numerous quotations from
other writers of established repute on
financial subjects.
"With so many books on the financial
issue pouring out from the press the
chances are it will be worn threadbare be
fore the campaign opens and the orators
wiil have nothing new to say. This will
not be altogether a loss either to the speak
ers or to the public. Both will probably
be perfectly willing to set the money ques
tion aside until we have re-established a
protective system that will give the peo
ple a chance to earn money of any kind.
A STRANGE QUESTION.
Our dispatches from Washington giving
an account of the proceedings before the
House Committee on Pacific Railroads on
Tuesday report Grove L. Johnson as say
ing to Mr. Tweed, the attorney for the
railroad: "It has been asserted, particu
larly in California, by tome politicians
that if the Pacific Railroad debts should be
refunded the people of California would
be obliged to pay the debts in increased
freight charges over the roads. Is there
any foundation for such a statement?"
Coming from a representative in Con
gress from California this is a strange
question most strangely expressed. Why
should Mr. Johnson seek from a railroad
attorney information as to what would be
the effect on California of the refunding
scheme? Why should he fay that "some
politicians" assert that if the railroad
debts are refunded the people of California
would be obliged to pay the debts in in
creased freight charges? The assertion
spoken of is not made by some politicians
merely. It has been made by commercial
bodies, by mass-meetings, by newspapers
ana, in short, by everybody who has given
the subject the consideration it deserves,
with the exception of those who either are
or have been employes of the railroad.
Is it possible that Mr. Johnson has over
looked so notable s fact as that in his own
State?
In reply to Mr. Johnson the railroad at
torney is reported to have said : "The
proposition is absurd. Freight rates on the
Central Pacific Eailroad, as on all other
railroads, are kept down by competition,
and they could not be increased to cover
the funded debt." If that answer satis
fied the questioner, as it seems to have
done, he can hardly have been Mr. John
son of California. It is true there are
competing routes for the terminal points
of the Central Pacific, but there is no com
petition for all the length of line that
stretches between the terminals. It is the
local freight rates that will be raised to all
the traffic will bear, and, except where
the competition of the new San Joaquin
road prevents, those rates will be certainly
raised to meet the interest due on the re
funded debt. How ebe, in fact, is the
money to be raised ?
In his position as member of Congress
Mr. Johnson represents the State of Cali
fornia and also the Republican party. He
is aware that both the State and the party
expect him to oppose the refunding scheme
now before Congress, or any other that
may be brought forward. To do this in
telligently he must, of course, have in
formation; but the next time he wisties
enlightenment he had better apply to his
constituents and not ask questions that
imply a total ignorance of what is going
on in California.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Charles \V. Tozier, the mining engineer, who
has figured in one way or another in many
camps of the West, is one of the familiar fig
ures at the Lick House.
Mr. Tozier has been fifty years in mining
and forty years on the Pacific Coast. As the
erpert for Alvinza Hayward and T. D. Lane,
he reported favorably on the now famous Utica
mine, one of the richest, it is believed, in the
world.
For many years Mr. Tozier was a hydraulic
miner, and in this capacity he got out at vari
ous times and in various places a large amount
of gold. When the excitement broke out at
CHARLES W. TOZIER, THE PACIFIC COAST MINING EXPERT.
Virginia City he went there and took a hand at
quartz mining.
At an after period he returned to California
and resumed hydraulic mining, which he fol
lowed for some years. But about a dozen
years ago, when the anti-debris laws were
passed, he turned his attention again to quartz
mining.
Though he has been among the first at every
big camp in Nevada, Utah, Montana, Idaho,
Colorado and Arizona, and has also had much
experience in Mexico, he thinks there is no
place like the mother lode of California. In
Mariposa, Calaveras and other counties on this
lode he foresees the development of enormous
additional wealth.
â¢'You go up and down the country, wherever
you will," said he, "but you can find only ono
mother lode. That lode is in California. It is
a plenty good enough thing to tie to. I have
been all over the West, and am satisfied with
it. I don't believe, either, that Africa or Cool
gardie is equal to it."
Mr. Tozier says he knows of considerable
Eastern and British capital that is coming to
the mother lode far investment. Syndicates
are being organized, and the indications are
that big developments will take place on the
lodo in new and old places in the next rear or
two.
The veteran expert is a talented story-teller.
He usually has a lot of men around him, and
invariably he interests them. The larger num
ber of his stories relate in some way to mines
and mining, the subject that lie 3so near to
him.
THE PIXY BAND.
When I forsake the busy street
And train my footsteps borne at night,
A band of naughty pixies meet
Me on the steps with keen delight.
They nimbly steal my hat and lake
Away my overcoat and cane;
My wet umbrella seize, and shako
Adown my back the drops of rain!
In vain i plead, "Oh leave me; go,
And bar the way no longer, please;
Why will ye clog my footsteps 80?
Why will ye hang about my knees?"
They bend me down and mount my back
And, heedless quite of bump or fall,
They make the floor a racing track.
And speed rue through the entrance hall.
We reach the parlor; there they place
For mo my easy-cushioned chair.
And pull my beard and pinch my face,
And comb away my scanty hair.
They rail me "papa"â man alive!
Sure, fortune smites with heavy hand,
When I, a youth of thirty-five,
Am father of a pixy Dand !
L'KXVOI.
Beside a row of drowsy heads,
With moistened eyes each night I stand.
And bend and kiss them in their bedsâ
God bless my little pixy band !

TRIED TO BUY CUBA ONCE.
Thirty-seven years ago this morning, says
the New York Mail and Express of the 24th
inst., Senator Slidell, chairman of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Affair?, reported back
to the Senate from his committee his bill au
thorizing the President to purchase Cuba from
Spain and appropriating $30,000,000 for that
put pose. Slidell introduced the bill on January
10, 1859. It was referred to his committee
and favorably considered. The Democratic
Senators met in caucus on January 15 to con
sider President Buchanan's recommendations
concerning Cuba and voted to support the I
Slidell bill as embodying the President's views.
Buchanan intended to make the acquisition
of Cuba the leading feature of his administra
tion, and it is probable he would have brought
about war between Spain and this country if
he could have had his way. President Pierce,
who preceded Mm, desired to annex Cuba, but
the Kansas-Nebraska question prevented the
accomplishment of this project. The slave
Democrats had for some lime recognized the
necessity of additional slave territory and rep
resentation, in order to hold their fast waning
power in Congress, and the Slidell bill was the
outgrowth of this policy. Every added West
ern State weakened the power in the Nation of
the slave Democrats, ana they saw in Cuba two
slave States.
The Republicans fully appreciated the
dangi;r in the Slidell measure, and it was
fought desperately at every turn. It became
the feature of the session, and almost every
prominent man in the Senate delivered a set
speech on the preat questions it involved.
When SliaeU's bill was reported from the
Foreign Affairs Committee the New York
Tribune, from whose Hies the Mail and Ex
press gets the data for this sketch, character
ized the measure as "a cunning complication
of claptrap arguments." Senator Seward of
New York, representing the minority of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, opposed the bill
when it was reported back, and succeeded in
having its consideration postponed until
January 31. He pointed out the dangers in
the measure, nnd said that to put the army
and navy and 5f30,000,000 iv the hands of the
President was a surrender of the constitu
tional power of Congress to make war. He de
clared that the proposition to buy Cuba when
Spain refused to sell was ridiculous and an in
sult to Spain. In a later speech he read from
the debutes of the Spanish Chamber of Depu
ties, where the members demanded reparation
from President Buchanan for his gratuitous
insult to the kingdom iv virtually proposing to
force the sale of Cuba.
The consideration of the bill was prevented
by the opposition, which gained strength as
the questions involved were diseased. .The
newspaper correspondents came to mention it
as the "thirty million bribery and corruption
scheme." It occasioned an all-night light on
February 25, when its friends thought to pass
it in its original form, but the amendments
and substitutes came thick and fast, and at
daylight Slidell withdrew, with the bill on the
table. On this night Senator Wilson presented
a substitute appropriating $50,000 for the ac
quisition of Cuba and all the other countries
on the continent south of the United States.
At the close of the session two days were
devoted to the Cuba bill, but when the Senate
adjourned without day the measure was on
the presiding officer's table and was never re
suscitated.
One of the leaders in the opposition to this
measure was Senator Doolittle of Wisconsin,
who is still a vigorous man, actively engaged
in the practice of law in Chicago.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
A musical season late is better than none at
all, and as Lent approaches announcements of
musical attractions are beginning to increase.
All through the early part of the season Pader
ewski was the only glittering concert, bait
held before our eyes, and the Tavary Opera
Company the only grand opera organization
we were promised. Then came tne announce- I
ment that the Abbey, Schoeffel <fc Grau Com- j
pany would come in May, and now the man- j
agement of the Columbia Theater announces j
that it has taken Beheel's Auditorium for a
series of concerts and has just concluded
engagements for Marci with Frau Materna
and Franz Ondricek, the latter of whom has
proved by far the most successful of the many j
Imported violinists who have been playing in
the East this season. Materna, Wagner's ac
knowledged ideal in his principal creations, as I
Isolde, Elizabeth, Brunnhilae and Ortrud, will i
sing excerpts iromthe Wagner operas. She is
an artist of marvelous genius and achieve
ments, whose work in the field of music-drama
has become a matter of history. Her o!d
friends will no doubt, rally to her standard,
and those to whom she is but a name will be ;
eager to lay by the fruitful memory of having I
heard Materna, though no longer in her zenith.
In the East she is being rapturously greeted by I
alt good "Wasnerians, with whom Materna is [
part of the Bayreuth master's creed.
"Evangeline," ai> opera based on Longfellow's
poem and set io ir.usic by Xavier Leroux, lias
just been produced with success at the Royal
Theater of La Monnaie, Brussels. Leroux i3a
pupil of Massenet, and "Evangeline," the first
opera he has ever produced, was written when
he was only 27 years of age. Le Menestrelsays
of the new work: "A short prelude is played
while we are shown 'the primeval forest,'
whose mysterious voices are one oi the leading
themes all through the work; then the first act
transports us to the rustic peace of Acadia,
where the songs of the people recall the French
mother country. The act ends in a love scene
by starlight between Gabriel and Evangeline.
Nothing in the opera being prettier than this
love duet. The betrothal of the lovers is be
ing celebrated in the next act with a hallelujah
of joyfulness, when suddenly the victors ap
proach, the happiness is changed to desolation
and the famous episode of the church of
Grand-Pre, described by Longfellow, is enacted.
The fourth act transports us to the arid shores
of ihe Teche, in Louisiana, where, in a scene
full of poetical music, Evangeline and her ser
vant are welcomed by a shepherd; the voice of
Gabriel is heard from afar and he shoots past
in a rapid bark, lamenting his lost Evangeline.
The last act passes in the hospital in Pennsyl
vania, where the lovers sing- their tarewell to
earth and hopes of meeting in the world be
yond the g.-aveâ then the scene fades away and
one sees again the primeval forest of the pre
lude and hears the music that suggests the
voices of the forest."
In the memoirs of Sir Charles Halle, which
are soon to be published In London, will be

Violinist, Who Will Bo llcard at the Auditorium.
known singer, was giving a concert in a town
in Cape Colony, where the only available hall
had been used to exhibit trained animals. As
the evening was very warm the doors and
windows were all left open. Clifford Halle had
finished the first part of the programme,
when in response to warm applause he sang
as an encore the beam if ul Hod, the last phrase
of which en<ls"Bruder, sage ja" (Brother, say
yes). The singer was just emitting a beautiful
hi^li mte on the final "ja" when a burro
thrust his head through the half-open door
and in a rlcn barytone voice began a loud
"Yah, yah." This response to the singer's
poetic appeal gave rise to a tumultuous scene
of laughter and applause, led by the officers of
the garrison. The comraandent said to Mr.
Halle: "You will never create a greater sen
sation than to-day, but I do not advise you to
take back your 'brother' when you return to
London."
The audiences at the great Italian opera
houses have strong opinions of their own on.
the subject of music, and never hesitate to ex
press them. At San Carlo in Naples, the other
day, the first Neapolitan performance of "The
Viilkyrie" was given, and the opera gave rise to
tumultuous scenes of disapproval. The public
remained quiet enough tili the second part of
the first act, when they began to make fun of
what was being sung. During the third act
the demonstrations of ' disapproval became
tumultuous, and people who wanted to listen
were unable to hoar the music. At last the
audience began to cry: "Hurrah for Verdi!"
"Down with Wagner!" and every on* lett the
theater, most of the people whistling and hoot
ing. The impresario is afraid to put on "The
Valkyrie" again, though he went to consider
able expense in staging the work.
Luigi Arditi's memoirs are almost ready for
publication, and* will first be printed in Lon

has been a long and active one, and should
contain some interesting incidents. In 1850
Arditi directed the Italian opera at Castle Gar
den, New York, and there he made the ac
quaintance of the Patti family. He afterward
became chef d'orchestre at Covcnt Garden,
London, and In 1889 he conducted when Patti
made her London debnt. Maurice Strakosch,
Patti's brother-in-law, and her impresario,
then engaged Arditi for his troupe, and in
18G2 hÂ«Â» wou great success at Vienna with his
waltz "11 Bacio," which Patti has sunfc ever
since in "The Barber of Seville." Arditi has
known almost all the great artists for the last
fifty years, and has toured all the civilized
and half-civilized countries in the world.

The Woman's Christian Temperance

The recent issue of the Saloonmnn con
tains the following :
Such a bill, if passed, would strike a deadly
blow at the most remunerative department of
several thousands of groceries scattered
throughout the City. These groceries are
largely dependent upon the bars at the back
for tneir profits. Were they deprived of this
source of revenue, it is doubtful whether in
the majority of instances they would -not be
compelled "to go out of business altogether.
This result has already appeared in the decay
of this class of business in New York and
Chicago, where it was once on* of the flourish
ing industries, ana all through the enactment
of one-sided and pernicious legislation, like
that now proposed to be enacted here. Our
grocerymen must remember that the contest
will be a hard one, and mat war will be waged
to the bitter end by their opponents. They
must lose no time in realizing Hint the ques

that the influence which will be Drought

Stories of Storm Told by the
Coasters That Came in
Yesterday.
THE THAYEE'S MAIDEN VOYAGE
A Disabled Schooner, Thought to Be
the Free Trade, Seen Off
Cape Mendccino.
The old bark Germania, which arrived
from the north yesterday morning, reports
that on January 19, off the Mendocino
coast, during a tierce southeast ca!e, the
schooner Fr^o Trade from this port was
seen with her jib carried away. Both ves
sels were laboring hard and no communi
cation was had with the disabled schooner.
This seems to meet with the statement
of the steam-schooner Sunol, which came
in Tuesday, that a lumber-laden schooner
was seen with flag inverted as a signal of
distress. She was under a double-reefed
foresail and appeared to be disabled. The j
Free Trade was at that locality and in
j about the condition described.
The little schooner Bessie K. staggered in
! Tuesday night very much wearied after
her rough trip from Albion. Her cabin
was Hooded, the galley swept clean into
the sea and her deckload of railroad ties
went plunging and banging around in the
air and water like the Cohma's fatal load
| of lumber.
When almost all of that deckload had
left the half-foundered Bessie she labortd
\ less heavily and managed to escape the
I tierce southeaster.
The schooner Wins & Wing, from Coos
j Bay, had her hands full for twenty-seven
days struggling with a series of heavy
gales. Her cabin was flooded and the
ueckload shifted by the constant pounding
I of me seas.
The schooner J. M. Coleman, which ar-
I rived yesterday from Tacoma, is another
j craft with an interesting experience. She
j was seventeen days on the passage and,
her carjro shifting, her starboard rail was
I under the water.
The new schooner C. A. Thayer, from
Eureka, a short time azo came in on her
maiden voyage, and her first experience
with the Pacific will last her a lifetime.
For five days she v:as hove-to, with the
seas going over her continually. Fhe lost
some of her new white sails and much of
her prettiness in that terrific storm. She
was only saved from foundering by the
use of oil bags, which deadened much of
the force of the pounding seas.
William Deacon, proprietor of the Main
street Iron Works, m a sworn statement
! tiled with the Board of Harbor Commis
, sioners, says that during the last five years
; his linn has done over $12,000 worth of
work for the State. No commissions were j
ever paid for any work until Julius Haste,
the late State Superintendent of Tngs and j
Dredgers demanded them, the firm re- j
luctantly submitting to the extortion.
Mr. Deacon also states that ex-superin
tendent William Cruse aid not receive a j
cent in commissions from the Main-street
Iron Works.

TEN THOUSAND SUED FOR
Water-Front Brick-Handlers and
Their $8000 Benefit
Fund.
An Injured Member Wins One Suit
and Will Bring Another for
Big Money.
Recent and current events on the water
front have forcibly demonstrated the fact
that the brickbat is harmful not only as a
projectile, but as a peace-destroyer when
the handling thereof is made the basis of a
labor organization.
The water-front handlers of brickbats
are in trouble. Peter Ma<_Â»uire is the man
who suffers, and in a lew days he will
I, ring suit for damages in the sum of
$10,000.
In 1887 some of those who were em
ployed in handling bricks on the water
front, loading vessels and otherwise, or
ganized a protective association. Benefits
in case of sickness ormjury and protection
to the members from wage-cutting were
the primary objects of the organization.
Tiie charter membership numbered lorty
seven, and new names were added to the
roll at every meeting.
The contributions to the treasury were
liberal and regular, considering the kind
of work performed and its remnneration.
A short time ago there was $8000 and over
In the society's official repository, and the
story of varied woes which follows has
much to do with these funds.
When the Brick-handlers' Protective
Association was organized, the intemion
of its founders was to confine it exclu
sively to the Irish nationality. They were
all Irish, honest, sincere and hardworking.
The members and the bricks they
handled pursued the even tenor of their
way for years. Their reserve and benefit
funds increased, and when any part of the
anatomy of a member came in serious
contact with a falling riece of compact
clay, or he was injured in any other mari

difficulty. But there came an end to this i
harmonious state of affairs, and for the I
cause thereof the Irish members look to
the admission of the Swedish members.
"There can be no doubt about it," said
Attorney Keys yesterday. He lias charge
of Magnira'a damage suit, and has already
obtained a judgment for $IGO against the
association, the amount judged to be due
Maguire as benelit dues while suffering,
from an injury.
"Yes," he continued, "Maguire tells
the truth, and it is emphasized by the fact
that the Irish membership in the organiza
tionâthe t=ocietv being originally exclu
sively Irishâ has decreased from fifty odd to
live. Their places have been taken by the
Swedes. lam free to admit that the Swedes
were too much for the Irishmen. The latter
admitted them to their association, accord
ing them all its privileges, but while thoy
were napping the new members succeeded
in getting in a new clause in the consti
tution which virtually accomplished their
undoing.
'â¢That obnoxious amendment referred to
whisky and its social use?. It was written
to read that any member who was seen at
any time to be under the influence of liquor
was liable to summary expulsion. It even
went so far, 1 am informed, as to make it a
supreme offense for a member to be seen
drinking promiscuously. Therein exists
the cause of Mr. Magulre's downfall. He
fell off a barrel-head, on which he was
seated in solemn meditation, and sustained
a fracture of one of his legs. The commit
tee, on investigation, said it was a case of
plain drunk, but eyewitnesses to the
downfall said that Mr." Maguire was sober
when he took his tumble to the floor and,
incidentally, to the significance of the con
stitutional amendments.whicti the Swedish
j members had succeeded in incorporating."
Whether Peter Maguire was drunk or
sober he won his case, and as soon as the
appeal is decided he will sue the organiza
tion ior $10,000 damages. By reason of
being laid up for several weeks on account
! of his accident and being refused aid from
j the $8000 in the benefit fund, he and his
I family are in destitute circumstances. His
I case will be brought up before Judge
j Sanderson on the sth of February.
G. Hanekomph, a Swede, is now the
president of the association.
BRONZE BUST OF GRANT.
It May Be Placed Near the
Museum in Golden Gate
Park.
Amcunt of Money in the Fundâ The
Collection Committees Appointed
in 1885.
It is not definitely settled that the Grant
monument in Golden Gate Park will be
placed on the knoll near the Starr King
statue. Cornelius O'Connor of the Grant
Memorial Association had a conference
with Park Commissioners Austin and
Scott yesterday, and it may be decided to
erect the monument on a site near the
Park museum.
The bronze bust, from Munich,' reached
here a few days ago, and was unpacked at
Rupert Schmid's studio last Tuesday.
Directions were civen by Mr. O'Connor
yesterday to have it transferred at once to
the Casino in the park, where a proper
guard will be placed over it.
Messrs. Reichert and O'Connor, the act
ive surviving members of the executive
committee, do not expect to encounter any
diliiculty in raising money sufficient to \
complete the monumententerprise. When '
the project wa.< first advocated by the press
and leading citizens of San Francisco a
fund of |100,000 was contemplated.
Amonj; the subscribers were Leland
Stanford $5000, James G. Fair $1000, J. C.
Flood $1000, Claus Spreckeis $1000, AlaSka !
Commercial Company $1000, W. 08. Mac- :
donough $1000, and many others for I
smaller amounts. It is not deemed proper â 
now to ask the subscribers who made their i
subscriptions with the expectation that
an expensive monument would be
reared to pay the full amount, but some
thing will be called for to carry out the
pJans.
For three years or more after the death
of A. J. Bryant it was not known that
there was any money deposited to the
credit of the fund. Finally Mr. O'Connor
found a bankbook showing that Mr.
Bryant had deposited $2300, all the money
collected, in the Anglo-California Bank.
It is understood that the Anglo-California
Bank will pay such interest on the deposit
as would ordinarily accrue to a trust fund,
and this amount will materially assist in
completing the monument.
As a leaf of history in connection with
the monument scheme it may be men
tioned that the executive committee met |
at the Palace llotel October 3, 1885, and !
denned the boundaries of eighteen collec- â 
tioa districts and appointed the following !

THE COSTA RICA'S TRIP
Swept by the Seas of a Furious
Gale on the Northern
Coast.
A STEWAED BADLY INJURED.
He Was Knocked Down by a Huge
Wave and Crushed Against the
Iron Bulwarks.
The bright, summery weather yesterday
brought in a large fleet of coasters, and by
them came accounts of the gale that last
week blew furiously off the Oregon coast
and around Cape Mendocino. AH of
these vessels experienced more or Jess
rough treatment in the high winds and
seas that raged over the ocean in that
locality.
Among the smaller fry of the fleet were
two big coal steamers â the Costa Rica
and the Peter Jebsen, from Departure Bay
and Nanairuo respectively. They both
had a stirring time of it, being delayed
about forty-eight hours by the strong
sontheast gale, but the Costa Rica had an
especial experience with the tempest. Off

gan to encounter v heavy sea and Captain !
James Mclntyre put the vessel's head
SQuaiely into it. The twenty-year-oJd
Costa Piica is one of the stanchest craft in
the Pacific, and she drove her sharp metal
| nose through those big rollers with grace
and ease.
Bat she did not wholly escape the visita
tion and the vengeance of the waves. The
seas dashed aboard heaving tons of
furious water around the house and among
the alleyways on deck. But everything
! touched by the waves, except a hand steer
| ing wheel near the stern, being of iron
I and uninovable, no particular damage was
| done. The wheel was of wood and ex
j posed and movable; the sea "didn't do a
thing to it," nor to its accompanying bin
nacle and compass. A few splinters in
I the deck told where it once stood.
Several of the crew did not escape the
i savage charge of the billows ana were
I pitched around against the metal bulk
| heads and bulwarks and more or less se
! verely injured.
Alexander Wallace, the second steward,
on the morning of January 2<>, was
j knocked down and frightfully mangled.
j He was carrying a tray of dishes along the
deck, between toe cabin and galley, when
a huge sea came over the bows. The |
great flood of water rushed aft, catching j
Wailace in the covered alleyway, between I
the eneine-honse and the ship's side. He j
| was borne down under the torrent and
! hurled here and there against iron doors,
ladders and stanchions with great vio
lence. The high rail of the steamer pre
j vented his inert body from being washed
i overboard, but the pitch, roll and jerky
motions of the vessel flung the imprisoned
water around the deck with great force.
Alter the deck had become partially
clear the first oflicer from the bridge
1 noticed what he took to be a bundle of
| rags lying in the scuppers. Looking
i closer he saw the water around it turning
! red. On making his way to the spot he
found the luckless steward lying on his
face unconscious and bleeding from a
dozen deep wounds. He had been gashed
across the back, abdomen, limbs, his head
battered, nose and ribs broken ana tlie
breastbone crushed in, besides being
bruised all over the body. Captain
Mclntvre states that it seems uJmost in
credible that the man should have been
mangled in so short a time and in that,
manner.
The unfortunate steward was placed in
his berth and everything possible done for
him, but that was little, as no ordinary
treatment could relieve those frightful in
juries. He held on to his tray and a large
coffee-pot, which was battered out of
shape, and it is thought that some of his
; knife-like cuts were caused by falling
: against the sharp edges of this utensil.
The rocking of the vessel in the terrioie
storm intensified the disabled man's sut
! ferings, though he was unconscious part
of the time.
Upon the arrival of the Costa Ptica yes
terday morning Wallace; was taken to St.
liUke's Hospital, when his injuries were
! examined and attended to. The physician
| gave it as his opinion that the patient
could hardly recover, as in addition to the
severe wounds, cut* and fractured bones a
broken rib had punctured one of the lungs,

\V. C. Hamilton, in order to make them
eligible as candidates, and left the remain
-49,890 shares in Hardee' â  name, with him
self as proxy. W. B. Lake, F. W. Lake,
F. D. Peterson, F. H. Culver, E. 0.
Humphrey and Joseph Harrison were
elected, but not until the votes of the plain
tiffs had been rejected. The candidates
voted for by the plaintiffs would have
been elected had the rejected votes been
counted, and so they sued to have the di
rectors placed in office removed.
In rendering his decision Judp;e Seawell
declared that the proxy given by Hardee
to Jacobs did not authorize him to make
any transfers of the stock winch he held
as proxy, and that, therefore, the plain
tiffs were not qualified to be ejected. The
subsequent ratification by Hardee of this
transfer of Jacobs vii not have the effect
of rendering the plaintiffs eligible as di
rectors at the time of the election. They
should have been eligible at that time.
The ballots thus cast for the candidates
not eligible to office could not, therefore,
be counted.
CENSUS OF CHINATOWN.
Collector Wise Will Now Begin to Take
Lists of Both Registered and
Unregistered Chinese.
Now that he has learned what the Treas
ury Department requires, Collector of the
Port Vise has decided to set his Chinese
bureau to work at once and take a census
of Chinatown.
Mr. Wise had been supposing that the
department wanted precise data as to the
sex, class and age of the Chinese, and
asked for blank books to be furnished so
as to facilitate the work, but instructions
have been received advising him to simply
procure separate lists of those who are
registered and those who are not. The
bureau would have begun taking the cen
sus yesterday, but it had not quite com
pleted its steamship reports. It may atart
10-day.
From Chief Deputy Internal Revenue
Collector Loupe it was learned yesterday
that there are about 27,000 recisiered
Chinese in this City alone and 55,000 in the
district. This revenue district comprises
all California south of Sacramento. How
many unregistered Chinese there may be
nobody knows. They have been constantly
'smuggled into the State over tb.3 Mexican
| boundary, it is said.
In Los Angeles Inspector J. D. Putnam
has prepared a fairly complete list of the
Chinese there and lie has a record of a
large number of unregistered Chinese.
Chinese who have not been registered
may be deported at anytime; also those
1 who are registered but who have been
convicted of felonies may be deported un
der the McCreary act.
PEOPLE'S HOME BANK.
An Effort to Preserve the As
sets of the Institution
Fails.
M. H. Sherman Granted Time to Amend
t
His Answer â Attorney Flournoy
Indignant.
The directors of the People's Home Sav
ings Bank held an exciting session in the
Mills building yesterday. Coutrary to the
advice of the attorney, John Flournoy,
and in disregard of a minority protest
against p.xposing the assets of the institu
tion to danger of loss, the majority granted
M. H. {Sherman's application for sixty
days' time to amend his answer to the
bank's suit for foreclosure on hi 3 property
in Arizona.
It was pointed out clearly in the discus
sion that it was the duty of the directors
to preserve the assets of the bank, but four
of the directorsâ Phelps, Thornton, Dorn
and Fremontâ voted in favor of giving
Sherman \kw time desired.
A resolution in favor of referring the ap
plication, in the usual manner, to the at
torney, was rejected on the ground that
the legal adviser would report against it.
As far as can be ascertained, Stone,
Davidson and Truman favored the refer
ence on the ground that the advice of the
attorney should be followed on all ques
tions pertaining to suits in court.
It is open talk that Mr. Flournoy will
not obey the resolution granting time for
Sherman to amend the answer. The at
torney is so indignant that he will disobey
the order and refuse to tender his resigna
tion, which will force the four directors to
remove him for endeavoring to protect the
property of the institution.
On the other hand it is maintained by
the majority that Sherman will pay the
note of $25,00G and that the action of the
board will not in any manner delay the
payment.
Sherman wishes, so it is said, to prevent
judgment against his wife. There is ap
vrehension, however, that the time de
sired will be used to set up some defense
against the bank" which is not at present
disclosed.

DANGER IF NOT DEATH
Exists in the Downtown Monte
Carlo of the Local Pool-
Sellers.
There Is but One Small Exit Out of
Which to Battle in Case of
a Panic.
The downtown poolrooms are again
running in full blast.
They have managed to overcome the
apparent reluctance of the California
Jockey Club to give them the use of a wire
from the Bay District track by having the
news of the race 3 sent them from San
Jose, where it is received by direct wire
from the track.
Under these circumstances, and unless
the California Jockey Club adopts the
S3me stringent measures as did the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club when it leased the
only wire out of its track, the poolrooms
will continue in active operation, wreck
ing the morals of the public.
The eight pool-sellers who had influence
enough to make Supervisor King intro
duce a measure to license their business
and wealth enough to stand repeated ar
rests for violating the Eliert ordinance
have joined in one vast establishment and
have opened up for business on Anna
street, back of the Columbia Theater.
They believe that on account of their
establishment being off the main thor
oughfares they will be permitted to ply
their nefarious trade, and they have fatted
up the old Baldwin stables with all the
paraphernalia necessary to their business.
There is one thing, however, that they
have overlooked, and it is probable that in
this they have made a vital mistake, as
they have placed themselves in the hands
of Fire Marshal Towe, who has the power
and the natural inclination all good citi
zens have to prevent the endangering of
human life.
The new room covers an area of over 3600
square feet, and the only entrance and
exit, for that matter, is but twelve feet
wide. The law requires that all rooms,
halls or places of amusement should be
provided with adequate exits, irrespective
of the point of entrance.
In this gambling resort yesterday more
than 2UOO people were packed at one time,
righting, cursing and inhaling the fetid at
mosphere in their endeavor to get next to
the bookmakers' stand.
The situation at all times from 2 o'clock
to 5 in the afternoon was a menace to the
safety of every individual present.
The cry of fire or a brawl occurring at
any time, both of which are strong possi
bilities, would mean a panic, which must
naturally result in injuries and deaths.
A PALL reporter wedged himself through
the crowd on a tour of investigation, and
it took him twenty minutes to reach the
pool-sellers' window and return. In the

Father Yorke Declares That the State
and Not the Church Was
Responsible.
Father Yorte contributes the following
letter in answer to the Key. Charles W.
Wendte:
January 29, 1896.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In his
last letter Dr. Wendte attempted to prove that
the Jesuit theologians taught that regicide was
lawful. By regicide Dr. Wendte meant the
killing of an heretical king at sicht. Of course
the learned exponent of "Protestant scholar
ship" was content with second-hand informa
tion, and the only answer necessary was to
describe the true teaching of the Jesuits, es
pecially as found in Suare.z.
CONCERNING REFERENCES.
In order to back up his theory that excom
municated persons were considered as outlaws
and that the killing of them was no murder.
Dr. Wendte produced that battle-scarred vet
eran of anti-Catholic controversy, the "Papal
Bull of Urban II." He says:
"Those writers appealed among others to the
papal bull of Urban 11, which declares that the
murderers o f excommunicated persons are to
be subjected only to a penance corresponding
to the motives which they had when they
committed the deed. 'Such are, indeed, not
to be considered as murderers if they happen
in holy zeal for the church to kill an excom
municated person.' (See Decret. p. 2, causa
23, q. G, cap. 47.)"
SJORE SCHOLARSHIP.
Of course, I need not inform those who have
followed the methods of Oakland "scholar
ship"' that there is no papal bull ol Urban II of
such tenor. Dr. Wendte has again been mis
led by Ins autuorities or he has constructed
this bull on the lines of his pterodactyl. The
document to which he refers consists of just
three sentences irom a letter addressed to a
bishop of Lucca. The letter itself is not extant
and the occasion on which it was written is a
matter of conjecture among scholars. So
therefore, far from being a papal bull, Dr.
Wendte'a excerpt is only the quotation of a
quotation.
Moreover. Dr. Wendte evidently does not
know what is meant by the reference he so
ostentatiously parades atthe end of his para
graph, "Decree p. 2. causa 23, q. b", cap. 47."
What "Decret" stands for the word itself does
jiut tell. It might mean a decree or a decretal.
If it means a decretal it would take a mind
reader to lind out whether Dr. Wendte intend
Â» d me Sezt or the Clementines or the Extrava
ge.:::s Common, or even the Kxtravagants of
John XXI I. I>r. Wendte might as well enter a
lawyer's library with the reference "see law
-1 o.'k part -, chap, 0", sec. 34."
However, I>r. wendte's vagueness worked no
hardship, lor the excerpt is well known to
.vho are compelled to deal with contro-
Jt i? taken from what is known as the
"Decree of Gratian." Strangely enough "Gra
tian's Decree" is not a decree at ali, but a text
book of law, and H possesses no more authority
than any other textbook of law. Dr. Wendte
evidently imagines that it is a cross between a
Papal bull ana au act of Parliament. As a
matter of fact it was nothing more than the
Blackstone's Commentaries of the middle
ages.
URBAN" II AND THE EXCOMMUNICATE.
If Dr. Wendte had taken the trouble to ex
amine Gratian's Decree before accusing Cath
olics of pothuntinp for heretics he might
have been spared this exposure. It must be
painful to the learned gentleman across the
bay to have his references continually invali
dated. I am sure the process must "be very
monotonous for your readers. Still the claims
which have been made to accuracy and to
scholarship have been so large and so loud
that I am compelled to show that Dr. Wendte
is dealing with documents about which he
knows as much as astronomy knows of the
other side of the moon.
Let us now look at Gratian'p Decree and try
to discover Dr. Wendte's quotation. As usual
the reference is wrong; but when figures nave
been handed down from author to author this
is not surprising. The second part of the text
book we find taken up with "causes" or im
aginary cases. The twenty-third makes the
following supposition: "Certain bishops with
their flocks fall into heresy and begin to com
pel tne surrounding Catholics by threats and
torture to follow them. On this the Emperor
confers civil authority on the neighboring
bishops and the Holy See commands them to
protect the faithful from the heretics. The
bishops accordingly collect an armed force
snd begin to contend against the heretics and
with success. Some are slain, others stripped
of their private or ecclesiastical goods, some
are thrown into prison and at last the schism
Is extinguished."
Having stated this supposed case Gratian
uses it as a peg on which to hang a number of
moral questions: First â Is it sinful to wage
â¢war? Secondâ What wars were just and how
were just wars car-ied on by the children of
Israel? and so on. The solutions to these
questions are given by passages selected from
a variety of sources: the writings of the
fathers, general or local councils, rescripts of
Popes, imperial statutes of Christian and even
of pagau times. The passages on each ques
tion are divided into little chapters or capi
tula, each with a title setting forth the point
specially illustrated by it. The fifth question
is this: "Whether it is a sin for the judge or
his officer to put to death those condemned of
a capital crime? r>
In the course of the answer to this question
occurs the passage of Urban II along with such
capitula as "It is not a sin to put a man to
death ex-oflScio." For instance, it is not mur
der for a Sheriff to execute a condemned
murderer. <% A soldier who kills a man in
obedience to authority is not guilty of
murder." "He is not a shedder of blood who
punishes murderers; and the sacrilegious."
"He does not sin who kills a malefactor ex
officio."
All these answers deal with persons who kill
because the law lays that duty upon them.
The killing may take place after judicial con
demnation, as in the case of executions at San
Quentin. it may take place by command of
authority u.s when soldiers shoot down rioters.
It may take place in the administration of the
law as in the case of Evans and Sonntag.
Now in the midst of these replies occurs the
fragment of Urban 11. It runs us follows :
"Bnjofa upon the slayers of excommuni
cated persona a measure of suitable satisfac
tion, according to their intention, as you have
i.Kr:nd m the practice of the Roman church.
For we do not look upon those as murderers
who. burning with zeal for their Catholic
mother against the excommunicate, mcy hap
pen to ha\e slain some of them. But in'order
that the discipline of the said mother church
may not be departed from impose upon them,
in the manner u L - have said, a suitable pen
ance by means of which they may appease the
eyes 01 the divine simplicity (i. i-. holiness) in
cm-e they may have incurred any guilt (du
pneitas, contrasted with the BimpUcltM of
Oodl through the human frailty in the said
deed of violence (flugitium),"
>"ow from this we see that Gratian is dealing
(l) With acts done under public authority.
(2) That the "excommunicate" here men
tioned are not aii excommunicate, but certain
bands of excommunicated persona who for
some reason or other were condemned to
death.
(3) That the persons who tlew thorn were
not private person*, but persons aeputed to do
t<> by the public authority.
(4) That these persons were not considered
murderers not because their victims were
excommunicate, but for the sume retison that
a police officer would not be considered a mur
derer if he shot an assassin resisting arrest.
WHO WERE THO*E E.XCO.MMINICATE ?
Now what is the historic meaning of this ex
tract? Who were these bands of excommuni
cated persons who were outlawed? As I liuve
said the whole letter is not in existence and
scholars are reduced to conjecture. However,
the opinion in almost unanimous that Urban
II is dealing with violators of what was known
as the Treuga Dei or Truce of God.
THE TRUCE OK GOD.
After the invasions oi ihe barbarians the
Teutonic system of private warfare took the
place of the old "Roman peace." During the
ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries Europe
was in a perpetual turmoil. A baron who had
a grudge against another baron proceeded at
once to mnke war upon him. As a result there
was no security for life or property, ior gen
erally these marauding barons were little bet
tor than bandits.
During this time there was no central civil
authority and the church undertook to rem
edy the state of affairs by instituting what is
known as the Truce of God. ily it all warfare
whs suspended from Wednesday evening until
Monday morning in every week. I'ilgrims,
women, merchants, monks and clerks, the
cattle and agricultural implements of the
!>easant â his ox, horse, plow and even his
olive trees. were declared inviolable. The pun
ishment whs excommunication and banish-
incut for seven or thirty years. At the Coun
cil of Cluremont, in 109'j, Urban II proclaimed
this truce for all Christendom and enjoined
on all men the duty of seeing that it was car
ried out. Of course, the only way in which
that could be done was by meeting" force with
force.
Bands of private marauders, excommuni
cated of course, wandered thruiigh the coun
-â  , and tit times these were attacked by the
d 'fenders of the Truce of God. burning with
I ze 1 for their holy mother. If any of Lbe ex
co nmunicate were slain they richly deserved
| it, and even Dr. Wendte would not call their
1 si tyers murderers. This is all that is meant by
I tile letter, "We do not call them murderers,"
|et". But as it might easily happen that men
i would use this provision of the law to wreak
, private vengeance on their enemies the Pope
I < r ten the Bishop to inquire into the cases of
i Lilling alleged to have occurred in the defense
I Â«,f the Truce, and to inflict a suitable punish
ment for any duplicity or double dealing he
vi 'it discover.
He rightly remarks that the punishment
C ...i not be death, for the slaying tooK place
;by public authority. But private spite and
j private malice are sinful, and it such motives
were present they should be expiated by peu
auce.
CRIMINAL CAJRELESSNESS.
Such is the exrlnnation of this provision of
the law, and \ou will see, Mr. Editor, how little
I'r. Wendte Knows about these quotations he
flings against the church. During the middle
ages Europe was full of persons excommuni
cated for one cause or another, yet we find no
trace in history of a law permitting them to
be killed at will. Surely the German Empe
rors and their adherents who wrote so many
bitter things against the Pope would not have
failed to bring up such a law, especially as it
was contained in the legal handbook ot the
time.
It would have been a telling accusation
against a Pope that he permitted his adver
saries to be shot down like wild beasts. Asa
matter of fact no such charge was made, and
there is not a single occurrence in history to
juHiiy Dr. Wendte's extraordinary teachingâ
that in the case of the excommunicate killing
was no murder. Such teaching is opposed to
all the teachings of morality, not only Chris
tian, but even pagan.
A STRAIGHT QUESTION.
And now I wish to put Dr. Wendte a straight
question. He says that the Jesuit theologians
appealed to this letter of Urban II as proof that
heretic kings could be put to death at will.
What are the names of the authors who make
that appeal and what are the passages in their
writings wherein the appeal is contnined?
This is a straight question. I want a straight
enswer.
A CUKTOrS WITHDRAWAL.
Dr. Wendte quoted Bellarmine as saying,
"Heretics when strong should be commended
to God, and when weak to the executioner." I
called this a monstrous sentment and I chal
lenged Dr. Wendte to produce the reference.
In answer Dr. Wendte Bays:
1. I quoted it from memory.
2. It is in my notes I took at school years
ago.
3. 1 have no time to look it up.
4. I withdraw it.
5. But (aside) 1 believe he said it, all the
same.
6. Because he said heretics should be burned,
which is just as bad.
Now, Mr. Editor, how am I to characterize
this manner of acting as it deserves to be char
acterized? If I should say out what I think
Dr. Wendte would rush into print, threatening
to give up the controversy because I am such a
bold, bad man.
I may be bold and bad, but I would never ap
pear before the people of San Francisco with
my schoolboy notes in my hand as evidence
against a great man like Bellarmine aud a
great church like the Roman Catholic. If my
cause was so bad that I had to manufacture
quotations, I would have sense enough to take
refuge in silence when my manufactory
was found out. I do not think it
would be manly for me to say to
the public, "I withdraw this quotation be
cause I cannot find it, but I believe it is true,
all the same." If Bellarmine had written fifty
volumes instead of only live, and if I had to
stay up all night to search them, I would do
so sooner than make iuch an exposure of the
tlimsuiess of my scholarship. 1 have no right
I to get into a controversy unless I Lave time to
devote to it. I have no right to accuse an
j author of making any statement unless I have
I that author under my eyes. Let me inlorm
Dr. Wendte that Bellarmine made no such
statement. If he was acquainted with contro
versial literature he would have traced that
calumny back beyond his Harvard notes. The
pussage which it purports to represent is found
| in the midst of a quotation which Dr. Wendte
himseif gives farther down, but which, of
course, he did not recognize. In future I
would advise him to burn those distinguished
monuments of Protestant scholarship, his Har
vard notes, and trust to the copy-books which
contain his earlier attempts at the art calli
graphic, known as "Pothooks and Hangers."
BELLARMIN'K'S DOCTRINE.
Dr. Wendte believes it probable that Bellar
mine used these words because he taught that
heretics might be burned. 1 wonder does Dr.
Wendte understand the force of language? He
makes Bellarmine a ferocious heretic-hunter,
barred from his prey only by fear. To justify
the picture, he quoteÃÃellm -'s statement
of fact that heretics were pu: lsk â  1.
Is this fair? Bellarminc 1.. what all the
medieval theologians Heldâ that the civil
power punished heresy; but neither he nor
any Catholic theologian held that the spiritual
power should shed blood. Moreover,"Bellar
mine himself was a man of the most gentle
disposition, and the cynical temper which Dr.
I Wenate imputes to him is utterly unfounded
in fact. The reverend gentleman tells me to
turn to pc Lulcls, cap. lil. I have done so.
Did Dr. Wendte ever see the book? If he did
he would have found that Bellarmine was
proving persecution out of the mouth of
Calvin.
MORE PARALLEL COLUMNS.
Moreover, Dr. Wendte falsities Bellarmine.
I am very sorry to be compelled to use the
word, but I cannot lind any other to suit the
case. Let me put Dr. Wendte's version of
Bellarmine and the original in parallel col
umns:
WKNDTE. I PKLLARMINE.
Heretics condemned 1 We therefore shall
by the church may be briefly show that iucor
puni.shcd with temporal rigible heretics, und es
punishment and even pecially those who nave
with ffeath (posse hte- relapsed, may and ouahi
reticos mb ecclesia dam-to bt; cast out from the
natos temporalibus pas- church and be punished
nis etium morte mulc-lbv the secular powers
tari). I with temporal puuish
|nient, and with death it
self. (Nos igitur brevi
ter ostendemus liareti
cos incorrigibeles, :ic
pr*sertim relapsos,
posse ac debere ab eccle
sia rejiel et a sajcuiarl
bus potestatibus, tempo
ralibus |'O ins atque ipsa
etiam morte mulctari.)
You will remark that in Bellarmine's thesis
there are two propositions:
(1) That heretics may and ought to be cast
out ot the church.
(2) That being cast out, the civil power (not
the church) might punish them even with
death.
Bellarmine's doctrine is the doctrine of
Thomas Aquinas, which I explained last week.
The state at that time looked upon heresy as a
civil crime, and the question arose whether
the church was justified in excommunicating
heretics when the state would punish them.
The answer given was that the church could
use her right even though the state did inter
fere, but nowhere was the answer given that
the church could or should kill or burn
heretics.
When, therefore, Dr. Wendte says that intol
erance was once the doctrine of the church I
beg to deny the statement. Intolerance was
once the doctrine of the state, aud the church
had to acquiesce in it because it was a matter
outside of her sphere. If Dr. Wendte really
understood the doctrine of the separation of
church and state he would see that the church
has no more right to fix the civil punishment
for heresy than she has to fix the civil punish
ment for housebreaking. Whether heresy
j would be considered a civil crime or not was a
I matter entirely within the power of the state,
and let me inform Dr. Wendte that:
(1) The Citholic civil powers were never so
intolerant as when they were at loggerheads
with t tie Pope.
(8) That even in the reign of Bloody Mary
Alphouso Di Castro, a Spanish friar, preached
agmnst the persecution and was not molested.
(3) That in the days of Louis XIV Fenelon
advised the civil powers to grant toleration.
(4) That no Catholic ecclesiastic protested
against the abolition of the civil laws making
heresy a civil crime.
(5) That not a single measure of toleration
was granted to Catholics by Protestant nations
which was not bitterly antagonized by the
preachers.
1 regret making this letter so long, but I am
compelled to follow up the ways that are dark
and tricks that are vain. "Protestant scholar
ship," like the heathen Chinee, is "peculiar."
Yours truly, p. c. Yorke.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1896.
GRAND JURY CENSURED.
The Board of Education Adopts
a Strong Answer to Its
Strictures.
NOT IN FAVOR OF MR. HYDE.
The Late President Also Comes In
for a Good Share of
Epithets.
If the ears of P. A. Hyde, once presi
dent of the Board of Education, did not
tingle last evening, it was because the old
saw that ascribes this sensation to those
who are being scored has lost its meaning,
for Mr. Hyde was hauled over the coals
and belabored with terms of contempt
and derision in a manner seldom heard
among the School Directors. Resolutions
setting forth his unworth and communi
cations calling attention to his short
comings were read and adopted unani
mously. The main broadside, however,
came from Superintendent Babcock, who
presented the reply to the report of the
Grand Jury on the Board of Education
which he had been requested to prepare.
The reply denied most of the allegations
of the jury, attributed all of them to
Hyde in scorching terms, and closed as
follows:
In conclusion permit me to say that no one
conversant with the facts can read the Grand
Jury's communication without a feeling of
wonder at tne gullibility of excellent men. In
my mind's eye, 1 6ee an earnest and innocent
educational committee ot the late Grand Jury,
seeking the best interests of the children of
the schools, with the unspeakable oleaginous
Hyde in the back ground, holding his sides as
he gleefully contemplates with what a master
hand he manipulated enough of the committee
to be permitted under cover to open his mud
vulves on the present Board of Education.
And yet I believe, as I write this closing sen
tence, that it would be sufficient answer in
this community had I said the Grand Jury
heard Mr. Hyde and refused to hear, when in
vited, the Board of Education, to besmear
whom seems to have been the only object of
their letter.
The entire communication, occupying
eight typewritten pages, was ordered
spread on the minutes.
At one time in the meeting there was
considerable excitement caused by Presi
dent Dodge declaring the meeting ad
journed in the midst of the proceed
ings. The report of the Committee
on Supplies, which occupied many pages,
was beine read by the secretary, "wnen a
number of the members quietly withdrew.
Soon it was found that no quorum was
present, and the delinquents were sent for.
Some refused to return, and President
Dodge, declaring that he had no power to
force them to appear, announced an ad
journment. Enough votes were mustered,
however, to pass a motion to have the
reading go over to the next meeting, and
the business betore the house was pro
ceeded with.
Director Clinton introduced a resolution
replying to the accusations of the late
Grand Jury, to the effect that the board
was guilty of an illegal act in raising the
salaries of teachers, referring to the salaries
of Superintendent Babcock and Principals
James O'Connor and Albert Lvser. The
resolution explains that the salaries were
merely restored to the amount received
before the reductions ordered by the last
board went into effect.
Regret was expressed that the Grand Jury
had not seen fit to consult with members
of the present board before rendering a
report and make an examination of the
records of the School Department as it had
been invited to do.
Superintendent Babcock introduced a
resolution providing that the salaries of
teachers held back in October last be paid
at once, in view of the fact that the report
of the State Superintendent showed that
there would be plenty of money for the
coming year. This was amended to pro
vide for the payment as soon as the money
is in the treasury, and it so carried.
The report of the Committee on Classi
fication, containing the following recom
mendations, was adopted:
That the history department of the Lowell
High School be permitted to make certain
modifications in text books; that Miss May F.
Fitzgerald, recently relieved from duty on ac
count of consolidation of classes in the Webster
School, be assigned to the charge of a new
class in the Harrison Primary; that a new
class be formed in the Sutro Primary School
with Miss Maggie J. O'Brieniin charge; that a
new first-grade class be formed in the Peabody
Primary School with Miss Jessie I. King in
charge; that Miss May E. Morrow be appointed
a primary teacher and assigned to Starr King
Primary School; that James Dwyer be regu
larly assigned principal of the Horace Mann
School; that Miss Catherine Riordan be given
charge of the new class established at Sunny
side; that Miss H. B. Steele De employed as a
teacher of history, with stereoptican, at salary
of $100 per month.
The report of the judiciary committee
recommending that the application of Miss
Victoria M. Raclet and Miss Cornelia B.
Campbell to be placed on the retired list
and given pensions be granted, was
adopted.
The Committee on Qualification reported
in favor of the following recommendations
to the State Board of Education:
Miss Francis Hodgkinson for Hisrh School
grade of life diploma, Miss Jessie P. Banks and
Miss Tillie McCarthy for grammar grade of life
diploma, Miss Matlie A. Watson and Miss Mary
J. Dolau for grammar grade diplomas.
The following probationary teachers were
also recommended for election as regular
teachers: Miss Rosa Murdock, Miss Fran
cis and M. Edwards.
The resignation of Miss Eldora Sewell
Deacon as a teacher wa9 accepted.
The City Board of Examiners sent in
the following recommendations that were
adopted:
Miss Mary McVerry, Miss Lillie K. Piper, Miss
Helen Hefron, Miss Lucy M. Wade and Miss Ida
K. Kerran for grammar grade life diplomas;
Miss Sarah F. Goss for grammar grade of State
educational diploma; Miss Lillian M. Ltbbey,
a grammar grade certificate; Miss N. K. Gal
lagher, a grammar grade certificate; Paul
Bomau. a High School certificate.
The grammar grade certificates of the
following teachers were renewed :
Miss Lena Cole, E. W. Engs, Miss M. A. Fen
nell, Miss Julia G. Maher.Miss J. A. Michelson,
Miss Mary McVerry, Miss M. E. Mower, Miss
Augusta Keinstcin, Miss S. A. Webster, Miss C
Kewhall, Miss Jessie I. King.
THE BRITISH MAILS.
They Are to Be Assorted While In
Transit, anil Thus Much Time
Will Be Saved.
Postmaster McCoppin has brought about
a change in the process of distributing
British mails which will effect a saving of
several hours' time.
Heretofore the mails from Liverpool
Glasgow and Dublin have come in a closed
pouch to San Francisco without any effort
having been made to do some of the work
of assortment and distribution while in
transit on the overland train. The Amer
ican mails are assorted on board ship by
what is known as the sea postoffice, and
pouches are thus made up for the various
destinations. Upon this system Mr. Mc-
Coppin thought some improvement could
be made by having a City distributor meet
the incoming Ogden and San Francisco
train at Winnemucca, and then open the
pouch and do the work of assortment
while the train was on the way here.
So he communicated with N. M. Brooks,
general superintendent of foreign mails,
and asked to be allowed this privilege.
Mr. Brooks was agreeable and the plan
will be put into operation at once.
The mail on the overland train arrives
at the San Francisco Postoffice at 9:45 a. m.
By the new method the spr.ks for stations
D (foot of Market street), iv (Palace
Hotel) and B (City Hall) will be ready as
soon as they reach the depot, and a great
saving of time can be effected, as the
necessity of having the entire mail co to
the Postoffice to be assorted will be done
away with.
A MAN DROWNED.
Body Found by a Soldier oiÂ» the Pre
sidio Beach Yesterday Morn
ing.
A soldier of Battery D, Fifth United
States Artillery, named Philip Martel,
found tbe body of an unknown man lying
on the Presidio beach near the Fort Point
life-saving station yesterday forenoon,
and notified the station-keeper.
Coroner Hawkins received word later,
and the remains were conveyed to the
Morgue. The action of the waves had so
disfigured the face as to make it totally
unrecognizable. The flesh was entirely
gone, and there was no name or memoran
dum of any kind about the clothing to in
dicate identity.
The unfortunate was well dressed. The
clothes consisted of a black pique cutaway
coat and vest, blue striped trousers, light
brown overcoat, white shirt, dark tic and
gloves. In the necktie there was a pin
containing seven small diamonds, and a
gold chain and silver watch completed the
dress.
Several bone 3 were broken, but this
might have been due to the buffeting of
the body on the rocks. It may have been
that the man committed suicide, at least,
such is the Coroner's opinion. Evidently
the body had been in the water several
days. As nearly as could be judged it was
that of a comparatively young man.
The following telegram from Fresno
TIIE DESK THAT HELD THE HIDDEN TREASURE.
concerning the disappearance of a Mr.
Wolcott, who has been missing from there
for some time, is self-explanatory:
FRESNO, Cjo.., Jan. 29.â The party in San
Francisco who has been working on the Wol
cott disappearance this evening telegraphed to
Mrs. Wolcott that a body had been found which
might be her husband. Masonic walchcharm,
such as Wolcott wore, was found on the dead
man. Investigations will be made to-morrow.
FOR BEATING HIS CHILD.
John St. Clair Found Guilty and Ordered
to Appear for Sentence.
John St. Clair of 20 Everett street was
found guilty by Judge Low yesterday of
cruelty to Sadie, his seven-year-old daugh
ter, and was ordered to appear for sentence
to-day.
The little girl testified that her father on
January 23 slapped her in the mouth with
his open hand and in falling upon the
floor she bruised her face.
Secretary Kane ainl Officer Cod burn of
the Pacific Coast Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children told of the
girl'B condition when they found her.
Her face was bandaged and they found
her nose was injured, her eyes blackened
and her mouth cut. St. Clair admitted
punishing the girl, but said he did it with
a strap. Tbe girl said her father hit her
with his closed fist, knocking herxiown.
AVitnesses for the defense testified that
St. Clair was a peaceable man and at
tended to his work and family. Evidence
was also given that the girl had a very
bad temper.
ARE BEING IMITATED.
What Caused a Reduction in the Sale of
Peruvian Bitters.
Mack & Co., the manufacturers and pro
prietors of Peruvian Bitters, are hot upon
the trail of some people who have been im
itating the product of the injured firm.
Three suits have already been commenced
against as many saloon-keepers who have
been selling the imitation, and more will
be brought so soon as sufficient evidence
can be gathered.
The sale of Peruvian Bitters had been
running down for some reason, and it w:is
finally decided to put a detective upon the
matter and have it investigated. He soon
found that an inferior imitation of the
genuine article was being sold in bottles
similar to tbat in which the real article
was offered by Mack & Co. Complaints
for damages followed at once, and as the
investigation progresses more complaints
will t>e filed.

CLOAK \AJJSTH SUIT HOUSE,
ISO Kearny Street.
FOUND HIDDEN TREASURE.
Henry J. Crocker Discovers a
Secret Spring in an
Old Desk.
MONEY AND JEWELRY THERE.
Maurice Casey and Harry Lanberton
Might Have Owned the Valu
able Curio.
Henry J. Crocker is being gazed upon
with envious eyes just now by Maurice
Casey and Harry Lamberton. These three
gentlemen occupy the same office at 508
California street and have a similar love
for that which is artistic and antique.
This made them all desire the possession
of a unique, brass-bound writing desk,
which Crocker succeeded in winning, and
in which he ha 9 just found unsuspected
treasures.
The writing desk was offered them by a
dealer in curios named Belasco. Belasco,
it will be' remembered, a fortnight ago
bought some old boxes which once be
longed to Conley Leach. He paid $10 50
for them and found among the other con
tents old coins and rare stamps to the
value of $800. He had come to sell Mr.
Crocker some of these stamps when he
began telling about the writing desk.
The next day he brought the desk up.
Its age was apparent. It was made of
rosewood, was bound heavily with brass
and was prettily inlaid with the same
metal. Substantial brazen handles sunk
in brass shields showed that the desk was
not a mere ornament, but was intended for
traveling. This fact was attested also by
the capacious interior, -which waa divided
off into smaller compartments by shelves
of sandalwood.
The -workmanship shown in the chest
and its oddness made each man desirous
to become the owner. None wished to
put up the entire cost, however, so after
they had lowered the dealer's price of $7
to $4 50 they each contributed ?1 50, and
the ownership of the desk was left to the
arbitrament of fate.
It was suggested first that they throw
dice for it. Nobody had any dicej so Mr.
Crocker borrowed three 50-cent pieces
from the janitor of the building:. Then
they "matched." The odd man was to
take the desk.
At the word the three put down their
coins. When Casey removed his palm the
money showed tails. Mr. Crocker's coin
was heads. Mr. Lambertson's coin was
still concealed. When lie withdrew his
hand a tail was exhibited, making Mr.
Crocker winner.
That evening Mr. Crocker prepared to
take his prize home. Casey at once pro
tested.
"You don't know anything about that
desk," he said. "It might give your whole
family Bmallpox or somethin^'else that's
dreadful. You'd better get the old thing
disinfected before you take it to your
house."
Then he smiled in a superior way and
told how clad he was he hadn't won the
desk. As the days passed and the antique
bit of furniture still remained in the office
Mr. Casey grew to be quite a chaffer. The
result was that the writing desk was a
matter of constant thought, and Monday
afternoon, spurred on by Mr. Casey's
charting, Mr. Crocker looked it over thor
oughly to see if he could not convert it to
some use about the office since he could
not take it home.
Tiie desk was a strong one and with the
cubbies removed would make an attractive
receptacle for papers. While Mr. Crocker
was examining its interior to see how it
could be altered, his ringer touched a
hidden spring. A panel in the side of the
desk at once fell out, revealing three small
drawers.
His cry of astonishment brought Casey
and Lamberton to his side. Their chuff
ing all died awny as the first drawer
showed two $50 bills issued nearly fifty
years ago, but undoubtedly genuine". The
second drawer contained anold-fashioned
gold watch curiously carved and a daguer
reotype, on the back of which was an al
most obliterated inscription. Some ear
rings of ancient pattern and a finger-ring
beautifully chased rested on some stained
cotton-batting in the third drawer.
The jewelry was so curious and the hid
ing-place so deftly fashioned that the spec
tators were dumb with astonishment.
When they regained their tongues they
overwhelmed Mr. Crocker witn congratu
lations. Casey admitted that there wasn't
so much of a "josh" on Crocker after all.
Then he said :
"What will Belasco say?"
But Belasco didn't say a thing. As soon
as he heard that he had dropped down
f rom $7 to $4 50 on a "lot" consisting of
two $50 bills and some valuable jewelry he
made a bee-line for his store. Word came
from the neighbors yesterday mornine
that the curio-dealer was carefully prying
out the entire interior of ail the many
desks, chests and boxes in his possession.
There were no reports of his having found
anything.
.Mr. Crocker is looking for more brass
bound, rosewood writing desks with hid
den springs.
A VERY BRAZEN SWINDLER.
Trying to Extort Money in the
Name of Prosecuting At
torney Dare.
The Police Invoked to Unearth Pecu
liar Practices of a Habitue of
the Courts.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare of Judge
Joachim sen's court has a grievance, and
he has asked the aid of the police in put
ting an end to it.
Some unscrupulous person, who is try
ing to corrupt court procedure, has
been going to people representing him
self as coming from the Prosecuting At
torney and asking for money for favors
done them.
It not infrequently happens that a case
in the Police Court has to be dismissed for
lack of prosecution. The complaining
witness has left the City or may refuse to
swear to a complaint, and theie the mat
ter ends. This knowledge has been util
ized by some person to attempt to extort
money from the fortunate defendant in
such cases, the rascal declaring himself as
acting for the Prosecuting Attorney.
Two cases have within the nast few days
been brought to Mr. Dare's attention. On
September 24 John T. Harris, real estate
broker, was arrested on the charge of ob
taining money by false pretenses. The
complaining witness was Mrs. Marearet
Madden, who had purchased a lot from
Harris which was afterward found did
not belong to him. Harris' friends came
to his relief by purchasing the lot and pre
benting it to Mrs. Madden. On this rep
resentation being made to Judge Joachim
sen the case was dismissed on October 18.
Not long afterward a man called upon
Mrs. Madden, representing that he had
been sent by Mr. Dare. He told her it
was through Mr. Dare that she had got a
$350 lot and that Mr. Dare expected to get
$50 for his trouble. Mrs. Madden refused
to pay anything, and lately she toid a
friend about it. and the friend felt called
upon to speak to Mr. Dare on the subject.
In the other case the defendant was dis
charged for lack of prosecution. When it
was first called the police asked for a con
tinuance, as they could not rind the com
plaining witness. That night a man
called upon the defendant, who was out
on bail, and told him Mr. Dare had worked
it so as to get a continuance till the com
plaining witness could be got out of the
City, and when the case had to be dis
missed he called again and demanded $50
which was declined.
"Any man," said Prosecuting Attorney
Dare, "who says that he has been sent by
myself or any officer of the court to de"
mand money is a liar and swindler. Some
unscrupulous scoundrel, who knows what
is going on in the court, is using my name
to extort money, and if I can discover as I
hope to do, who he is, I shall make'hini
suffer for it.
"Only two instances have recently come
to my knowledge, but heaven knows how
many more there may be, and what will
people be thinking about me? I only
hope we will be able to trace the im
postor."

Grand Rally of the Brownites at the
Prayer MeetingâFemi
nine Hysterics.
Dr. Brown has Deen rehabilitated. It is
possible that the newly anointed gar
ment in which he is clad will prove to be
of even a imore fleeting character than
MRS. SARAH B. COOPER DEMANDING AN EXPLANATION OF THE MATTIE OVERMAN LETTERS, WHILE DR. BROWN
AND DEACON DEXTER LISTEN. HER REMARKS CALLED FORTH HISSES FROM THE AUDIENCE.
[Sketched in the church last evening by a "Call" artist.]
most earthly joys, yet he wore it with
pride and there were many hands to help
him don it last evening.
The Sunday-school room of the First
Congregational Church was crowded like
a playhouse at a free performance. Parents
brought their children, who found the pro
ceedings of ereatest interest.
The oiiicers and trustees of the church
and members of the Bay Association were
present to lea-rn what disposition would be
made of their reports. Dr. Brown was in
his place, looking no whit worse for the
ordeal of the past month. He presided
during the prayer- meet ing proper, which
was of the stereotyped form. There was
no special relevancy in the reading nor in
the prayers nor hymns. Deacons Barnard
and Dexter invoked divine help in all good
;;nJertakings whatsoever. Dr. McLean
made some commentaries upon the scrip
tural passage read.
The audience grew restive under the
prescribed form of procedure, but settled
back into a comfortable and attentive at
titude when Dr. Brown stated that he !
would resign the chair in favor of Deacon
Dexter while reports were niade by repre- |
-entatives of the joint committee from the ;
Bay Association and standing committee
of the church. This report was presented
by Dr. McLean, who prefaced it by a criti
cism of what he regarded a3 the hostile
Ettitude of ihe press shown in its dealing ;
with Dr. Brown's case. The Brown con- |
tingent applauded at this point.
Deacon Barnard read the report of the
officers and trustees of the church. Dr. i
Brown followed with a statement of how '
much he desired to present ijjeontrovert- I
ible proof of his innocence and how rigor
ous his attorneys were.
All was going smoothly until Mrs.
Cooper sought permission to speak. This
was obtained atter some difficulty, for Dr.
Brown demanded why she hud not com
municated with him before censuring him
in the pre-s. She replied that she had j
written him, but had received no reply.
Her pastor denied having received her
iettei.
Mrs. Cooper was permitted to make her j
statement, which she did simply and
forcibly. Bin had believed Dr. Brown in- i
nocent, she said, until Miss Overman's j
letters were published. These, she said, j
corresponded so perfectly with letters re- j
ceived from Miss Overman by her that she j
waa forced to believe the evidence of his
guilt conclusive. She would be alad to be
corrected if dM were wrong. Dr. Brown
a-ked her to call at 11 A. m. to-day and
proof would be furnished. She promptly
accepted the invitation.
Mrs. Dr. Rogers rose at this juncture to
say :
"We are with you, Dr. Brown.''
C. P. Wolcott made a rousing address,
In which there was much about Dr.
Browns service in the army, but was
ostensibly a plea for the postponement of
action on the resolutions until the church
might vote on it without interruption j
from outsiders.
"That would be the course followed in
other secret societies, " he declared.
Deacon Barnard's motion, seconded by
C. G. Nagel, that the resolutions be
aaopted at once, was not put because of
Comrade Wolcctt's objection, and action
will be taken upon thtm at the next meet
ing.
Dr. Brown declared bis intention to fill
the pulpit of the First Church until he
was deprived of the right to do so. This
was in answer to Deacon Brown's aues
tion, "Will the pastor rill the pulpit dur
ing the interim?"
There was handshaking in plenty at the
close of the meeting. Dr. Brown and Mrs.
CooDer divided honors pretty equally in
that retrard. The feminine contingent of
Dr. Brown's sympathizers wns divided be
tween smiles and tears. "I worship the
ground ne walks on," asserted one of the
fold. "Who can look at that face and say
he is guilty?"
It was whispered about that Mrs. Stock
ton was a witness of the evening's proceed
ings. "How horrid of her!" said one
woman. "The fool!" said another.
It was true. The winsome widow could
not restrain the curiosity inherited from
her grandmother, Eve, and was moved to
look in upon the meeting. She tripped
through the library and took a seat near
the door, looking on with a mischievous
expression. She left early.
Mrs. Cooper was the heroine of ths occa
sion. Tt was evident that she made her
protest with difficulty. She was pale and
her voice trembled, bat Dr. Brown's
frown did not deter her. "It nearly killed
me to do what I did, ri she said afterward,
"but I felt I must. It Â«eemed to me if I
did not discharge that duty some awful j
calamity would befall me. I considered
those letters, corresponding in all their
idiosyncrasies to those I had received at
nearly the same time, as irrefragable proof.
I do not see how they can be explained
away."
It'is no easy task for a gentlewoman to
endure an outburst of hisses such as
greeted her from one quarter when she
went upon the platform; but she only
grew a little paler, and said: "There is
but one animal that hisses."
Of all Dr. .Brown's antagonists a woman
was the one who raised her voice in
protest to the adoption of the resolutions
practically exonerating him.
It is noteworthy that no attempt was
made to control applause when it greeted
) the pastor, while ii was promptly sup
| pressed when Mrs. Cooper held the floor.
After Rev. Dr. J. J. McLean had made
J the last talk on the Bible lesson read by
j Dr. Brown the latter came to the front of
' the platform and said:
The joint committee appointed by this
I church and the Bay Association and the offi
j cers and trustees have certain reports to
I make to the church, and I will ask Deacon
Dexter to take the chair while this business is
being transacted.
Deacon Dexter promptly left his seat in
the rear of the packed room and pro
j ceeded to the platform. He then ex-
J plained the proceeding which had been
i tauen by the joint committee and the
1 officers and trustees of the church at their
< various meetings, adding that Rev. J. J.
! McLean would present a renort for the
[ consideration of the members of the
! church. Dr. McLean, in presenting the
! report, said :
1 would like to preface this matter by saying
| that I do not know why I should have 'been se
j leeted to come to the meeting and make this
! report. I came under my continued Hnd earn
| esc protest. But the voice of the general com- i
I mittee was so strong that I could not resist the
; call to be here. The officers of this church I am
i sure are perfectly competent to act in this
1 emergency.
The short resolutions that have been adopted
I by these bodies seem to need no explanation.
They are of no uncertain sound. Dear brethren,
' we hereby submit them. They sufficiently ex
plain themselves.
He then read the following preamble
and resolution, which was passed at the
meeting of the general committee on Mon
day night:
The committee, having canvassed the whole
subject, have come to the unanimous con
clusion that it is unwise to enter upon any ex
tended investigation as expressed in the fol
lowing statement:
This joint committee, consisting of the
standing committee of the First Congrega
tional Church and a special committee of the
Bay Association of Congregational Ministers,
submits to the public the following statement
bearing on the case of the Rev. C. 0. Brown,
P.D., against whom serious charges are cur
rent in the community.
The committee of the association desires to '
be understood that it is notintrnsted with any j
authority under the usages or according to tho
principles or the Congregational churches to
either convict or acquit or even to investigate.
This is the function of the local church, as
sisted at its own request by an ecclesiastical
council.
The standing committee of the church, while
recognizing the fact that it is its duty to take
the initiative in this as in all matters of church
discipline, yet asks the attention and the can
did consideration of the public to the follow- I
ing facts, and the committee of the association
indorses most earnestly this request.
Firstâ That there are possible contingencies
in the processes of the Superior Court in which
our brother will be arraigned, as well as the
defendant, in view of which he Is forbidden by
the evident necessities of the ca^e ami by the
imperative interdicts of his counsel, from
making public those statements wbicli he con
fidently believes would remove the suspicions
now existing, and that we deem it inadvisable
for him to make any statements to us privately
which he is not allowed to make publicly.
Secondâ That we have found our brother
eager to welcome, and impatient to insist upon, I
the most thorough investigation of hisconduct.
And as toon as the impediments now existing
are removed by the conclusion of the legal trial,
he has assured us he will ask the church to
institute this investigation, assisted by an ec
clesiastical council duly convened; and,
Thirdâ That in view of theso things, we pro
pose for ourselves and we ask of all others a
suspension of judgment in the case of Dr.
Brown, and we hereby express our confidence
in his integrity.
In speaking to the report Dr. McLean
said:
The Doint that I wish to call attention to is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1596.
the fact that Dr. Brown cannot make any
statement for the public without breaking
with his counsel, who have adviaed him not to
make any statement at all. I wish to state
that this has been the attitude of Dr. Brown
from the very first. He said that he was
anxious to make a full reply to all tne charges
brought against him. It was only with great
difficulty that he could refrain from doing so.
But hi has been compelled to silence by his
attorneys, who believe that any statement he
might make would be construed against him.
He suggested the appointment of the joint
committee himseif. He asked that the Bay
Association would appoint a committee to
whom he could make a statement in confi
denceâone that was to be withheld from the
public, not because he wanted to withhold it
but because he was compelled to withhold it.
He said that he felt assured that we all would
retain our confidence in him when we heard
liis statement, and we cheerfully assented.
We did this not from any sense of duty but
spontaneously.
Dr. McLean then denied that the joint
committee was one appointed to either
investigate the conduct of Dr. Brown
or to try him, and added that
the erroneous impression that existed
in the public mind on this point
made it apparent that the joint committee
would not be able to accomplish its true
purpose without being misconstrued. He
then continued:
The only thing left for us to do was to re
mand the ease to a council by the local cnurch.
Last Monday aiternoon after due consultation
with the members of the Bay Association we
proceeded to the house of Dr. Brown, he having
no previous knowledge of our visit, and told
him we thought it inexpedient to do anything
under the circumstances for the reason that it
would be misunderstood, and that far from
being able to keep anything private it was
lound that it was impossible to keep anything â
even what was thought to be must secretâ from
the press.
Dr. Brown, when he learned the reason for
our decision, readily consented to have the
matter referred to a council. He was perfectly
willing to trust himself to the action of his
brethren, and asked us to take whatever
course we thought best. He said he was will
ing aud able to trust his character to God and
his brethren. Dr. Brown did not make the
suggestion to the committee to hare the mat
ter remanded to a council. He said further
that he would never consent to have this mat
ter rest until it had been fully investigated.
This report was drawn up at the meeting of I
Monday night and adopted unanimously.
At this point Dr. Brown, who was sitting
just back of the speaker, arose and ad
dressed him as follows : "Dr. McLean, may
I ask you to state the spirit of my message
to your committee on that matter that
night?"
To this request Dr. McLean responded as
follows :
As I came out of the office where the meet- '
ing was in progress Dr. Brown was sitting and
waiting for our action. 1 told him that the
report which had been adopted by the Bay
Association had been presented to the com
mittee, and 1 felt sure the whole matter could
be discussed witbont his presence. It was en
tirely amicable. I simply said we were going
to take tne course that had been determined
on that afternoon.
When Dr. McLean finished speaking the
pastor of the First Church arose and in
feeling tones, addressing Dr. McLean,
said: "I thank you for that."
Deacon Barnard, who has acted as sec
retary at all of the meetings of the com
mittees, then read the preamble and reso
lutions adopted at the meeting of the of
ficers and trustees of the church on Tues
day night, as follows:
At the meeting of the officers of the
church and the trustees of the First Con
gregational Society held January 28, 189(i,
the following preamble and resolution were
unanimously adopted:
Whereas, Certain intimations of immoral
conauct have been made against C. O. Brown,
D.D., by irresponsible persons and without any
proof as to their credibility, now be it
Jiesolvcd, That this body expresses full and
entire confidence in Rev. C. O. Brown's Integ
rity and good moral character, and will not
credit vague and damaging insinuations until
they are proved before a competent tribunal.
Chairman Dexter then said:
You have heard the reading of the findings
of your joint committee by Dr. McLean. I
could not say a word addliional if I tried.
Let us suspend judgment before we accuse, be
fore we take action.
I have been accused by some of my friends in
this matter. I am sorry that they have mis
judged me. The time will come when you will
be sorry for what you have said against me.
It is unchristian.
One of the most peculiar remarks has been
madeâ that we were going to whitewash some
body. Let me say that I am the last man in
the world, to whitewash any friend or any
enemy.
Let us wait at least before judging until the
result is known in the right and the legal way.
Dr. Brown here arose and returned his
thanks and gratitude to the members of
the joint committee and the officers of the
church who had passed the resolutions,
and apologized for the remarks which he
made concerning the press at the prayer
meeting two weeks ago, excusing his faux
pas by attributing his words to a nervous
and irritable frame of mind. He then
added :
Gladly I would open the whole record con
cerning the matter, but I recognize the fact
that I am fighting a battle for my brethren
throughout the country. It I should not fight
this there is not a minister in the whole
United States whose salary is known to be
large enough to make it worth their while,
who would not be made the victim of black
mailers.
He concluded by citing the case of the
Rev. Henry Ward'Beecher and the man
ner in which his congregation treated him
pending his trial, and said he felt his con
gregation held him in similar estimation.
His closing words elicited considerable ap
plause.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper arose and said she
wished to say a few words, but she was
summarily interrupted by Deacon Bar
nard, who moved the adoption of the re
port of the joint committee.
Charles G. Nagle seconded the motion.
Mr. Warren arose to make some re
marks, but got no further than: "I would
like to say a"â when Mrs. Cooper suc
ceeded in being recognized. She said:
I have felt anxious and pained over this mat
ter ever since it was made public and was loth
to believe there was any ground for such a
charge as has been made. lam Very glad to
see that our pastor is here to hear what I have
to say.
Hisses from various parts of the room
interrupted the speaker. Among those
who were most energetic in producing the
sibilant disapprobation of the lady was
Valentine, a son of Dr. Brown.
Deacon Dexter admonished the audience
to refrain from disturbing the meetinp,
and said he would not submit to such ex
hibitions. Mrs. Cooper then resumed:
If I am wrong in what I am about to say I
would esteem it a favor for any person in this
cnurch to get up and say lam mistaken. It is
simply a matter of conscience. 1 feel that what
I say is true. I must say it.
Dr. Brown broke in here and asked Mrs.
Cooper whether she was proceeding ac
cording to the prescribed rules of the
church. He declared he should have been
informed before she undertook to publicly
denounce him. She replied:
â¢'1 wrote you a letter informing you of
my purpose*."
To this Dr. Brown retorted by saying
that she should have called upon him
personally. She resumed, however, as
follows:
During the last few weeks I have been asked
many times what I thought about Dr. Brown
keeping his place in the pulpit, and I said I
thought he would not desire to do so, know
ing the sentiment in the church. I have also
been asked many questions by members of
the press.
I iong belonged to the press and I could not
very well refuse to answer some of these ques
tions. I have also had scores of letters ad
dressed to me, making inquiries regarding this
case, and the only reply I did make was, "Let
us wait and see what the end will be."
I had every confidence in the doctor despite
the evidence that had been developed, until I
saw the letters known as the Overmun letters
published in a paper. These letters were
similar in purport to some that I had received
from Miss Overman and related to her enter
ing the Golden Gcte Kindergarten.
Reference to my diary comirmed every fact
stated in these letters. Then there was pub
lished a statement that the ehirogrÂ»phy in the
Overman letters had been oompared with the
known handwriting of Mibs Overman and
found to be identical.
The style of writing, the syntax and other
points corresponded exactly. I even went so
Jar as to employ an expert, who decided that
theso letter? published in the newspapers were
in the handwriting of Miss Overman.
Where we have not the full evidence we can
only judge from that portion which we have.
Can you wonder that I have wanted a satis
factory explanation of the Overman letters,
which have caused me unspeakable pain ever
since I knew of their existence?
Jn view of all these circumstances I think it
would be best for our pastor to refrain from
teaching until all these things are explained,
and for this (turniug to Dr. Brown), my pastor,
I fervently pray.
As soon as Mrs. Cooper had concluded
Dr. Brown came to the front of the plat
form and said:
I want to say that Mrs. Cooper rould have
had the explanation she desired if she hod
come to my house instead of making a public
statement. 1 will say further that she can
have it by coming to my house to-morrow or
at any time that suits her conTentoaoe.
The explanation Is absolute, absolute, and
in the estimation of any fair-minded person
would free me from ail blame in connection
with those letters.
Mrs. Cooper promptly accepted the offer,
and it was finally decided that she was to
call at Dr. Brown's house at 11 o'clock this
morning to receive his explanation and
which Dr. Brown asked her on her
"womanly word" to keep secret.
Cnarles G. Nagle arose and expressed
his confidence In the pastor.
Deacon Dexter then put the motion to
adopt the report, but a vote was prevented
by C. P. Wolcott, who demanded a roll
call.
There being no roll available Deacon
Dexter attempted to have the motion acted
upon by a viva voce vote, but before he
could carry out his purpose his attention
was called to a rule which provided thai
no resolution could be acted upon at the
same meeting at which it was presented if
there was any objection.
Mr. Wolcott having objected, it was
finally decided to have the matter come
up for action on next Wednesday evening.
In response to a question by W. H.
Brown, a member of the church, Dr.
Brown said:
I don't desire to avoid any question, and I
propose to attend to my pastoral duties till the
church which gave them to me deprives me of
them.
Supposed to lie Criminal Practice.
Mrs. Kate Gauch, 31 years of age, died at her
home, 013 Buchanan street, Tuesday evening.
It was thought at the time that her death was
due to blood poisoning, resulting from crim
inal practice, but her husband, Adam Gauch,
a storekeeper, had never been able to learn
from her whether or not she had been a victim
of illegal practice. Dr. F. H. Hund was called
to attend ncr a few days ago, aud he treated
her for blood poisoning. An autopsy was held
yesterday by Dr. Barrett and he pronounced
it a case of peritonitis.
In Ashanti and around the woods near
Kabba grows a tree resembling in appear

dition.
THE "STOP-OVER" CROWD
Evidence That the Plaintiffs Got
Together and Then
Talked.
TESTIMONY FOR THE RAILROAD
Progress of the Suit to Consolidate
the Ticket Contract
Cases.
The taking of testimony in the railroad
case against the stop-over suitors has com
menced before Juiige Sanderson.
The testimony of the witnesses was to the
effect that what was known as the "stop
over gang were frequently seen together
in earnest conversation, and further, that
they Dad agreed to take people in on the
scheme, and generally that they seemed
to be going into the stop-over business for
profit.
J. H. Bruns told how he had been told
by Poole, one of the defendants, that he
could come into the deal for $200; but it
was discovered by further evidence that
this offer was made after the present suit
had been commenced, and he was told
that money was needed lor the defense.
John T." Hail also testified. Hall had
once been a partner of Poole in the real
estate business. He said he had once
spoken to Poole about these stop-over suits
and Poole had told him he could make
more money in that way than in the real
estate business. The process of buying
the tickets and demanding the stop-over
privileges was explained by Poole to the
witness, and also how he himself kept
memoranda of the tickets he demanded.
Hall said be tried it once; he demanded a
stop-over ticket and was refused and he
made a memorandum of the occurrence,
but he had subsequently lost his memo
randum.
Albert Kamp, a policeman, used to see
the defendants, or some of them, assem
bled nearly every night in the week when
he was on his beat in the early part of the
evening. They used to meet in Poole's
office, but he could not tell what they
used to talk about. Poole's office, he said,
had quite a reputation, and to Mr. Cator's
questions he said the reputation it had
was as the headquarters for the "stop-over
gang." The case will continue to-day,
when more of the plaintiff's witnesses will
be examined.
CORINTHIAN YACHT CLUB.
Officers Who Have Been Electedâ The
Matter of Incorporation Settled.
The annual meeting and election of the
Corinthian Yacht Club was held last even
ing at 510 Bush street. The following
members were elected to office: J. W.
Tew, commodore; Carl Westerfeld, vice
commodor ; Alexander J. Young, secre
tary; Charles L. Barrett, treasurer; J. H.
Keefe, port captain; W. F. Stone, meas
urer; directors â C. K. McKee and John V.
O'Brien: regatta committee â W. A. Bar
lage, C. W. Platt and H. E. Pennel.
It was unanimously decided that the
club should incorporate and with that ob
ject in view papers will be signed to-day.
The by-laws of the club were altered so
as to suit the civil code of the State and
some improvements and amendments

How many hours do you sleep during
the twenty-four?
Two hours, doctor.
Have yon been in the habit of retiring at
a regular hour previous to your sickness?
No, doctor.
Have you a disposition to sleep during
I the day?
No, doctor.
Do you feel restless and despondent?
Yes, doctor.
You say that you feel as though you
would never regain your ambition ? -
;â¢: Yes, doctor, I am blue.
Is insanity hereditary either on your
father or mother's side ?
No, doctor.
Do you take opiates now?
No, doctor.
Insomnia or. loss of sleep is always the
result of some abnormal condition of the
system in general. What is necessary in
your case is to put all the organs to work
actively, so that the blood will circulate
freely and not stagnate or remain in the
brain. Your nervous system needs atten-
tion. I will write you a prescription, and
when you ask your druggist for the remedy
take nothing else.
Yes, doctor.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 1n.., Jan. 29â The selling of wheat
this morning proved more powerful . than the de
mand. It wes scattered, but of liberal proportions
In the aggregate, and the general opinion leaned to
the theory that Armour was still disposing of more
of his property. The Tlioman crop report was out
to-day. It gave the condition of winter wheat as
79.2, against 82.6 last month. The figures were in
the hands of a few people early, but did not become
public news until about th- mid-.ile of the session.
Liverpool stocks for the month showed a falling
oft' of 1,200.000 bushels. Liverpool cables were \
easy and i/id lower. Receipts In the Northwest
were 441 cars, against 265 last Wednesday and ,
227 a year ago. Chicago received 67 cars and in
spected out 44,976 bushels. Reports of export,
sales of from 30 to 40 loads at . the seaboard
changed the course of the market and a complete
recovery followed and an additional gain occurred.
Export sale? at Atlantic ports amounted to 258,
--794 bnshels. Paris closing cables were lower for
wheat and unchanged for flour. Berlin and Ant
werp were unchanged. May wheat opened from
63' ' a c to 633/ B e, sold between 6S@tS3VB9 and 64%
Â©tssc, closing at 64y 2 .'ri;6is.4Â»c, I@lVsC higher than
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 70
cars.
CORNâ Eased away further this morning. The
receipts were larger than expected, 267 cars arriv
ing. Liverpool cables were quiet and unchanged.
The principal reason for the weakness was the de
clining tendency of wheat. . Trading was not brisk,
only occasional spasms of moderate activity being
noted. Withdrawals from store were liberal at
263,977 bushels. Prices rallied with those of wheat
later in the session. Export clearances were 298,
--743 bushels. May corn opened at 29 3 /4 c, sold be
tween 29V->@295/ g c and 301.4 c closing at SOygC,
3 4 ',is a c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 310 cars.
OATSâ Slipped away a few notches through the
popular feeling of weakness this morning. 'Re
ceipts were 164 cars. There were no withdrawals
from store. Later there was a better feeling and
an Improvement In values. May oats closed i,4@
%c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts lor
to-morrow 180 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 93c: March, 93c;
May, 96(a'963. 4 c. Receipts 26 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The receipts of hogs seemed to
have picket! up very suddenly this morning, the
run being about 7000 in excess of the estimate.
Prices were unable to withstand the oversupply,
and the product found weakness in that fact. The
strength of wheat in the latter part of the session
assisted the product, prices recovering almost all of
the early loss, and closing with but 7y 2 c decline
from yesterday on May pork, 5c on May lard, and 1
a shade on May ribs. Stocks of provisions in j
Chicago as estimated by George W. Phillips Jr. 1
are: PorK, 125,000 barrels: lard, 65,000 tierces,
and ribs 20,000,000 pounds.

THE STOCK MARKET.
Prices were off again somewhat yesterday, as
will be seen by the list of sales. Occidental Con.
recovered some of Tuesday s lost ground, however,
and sold up to $1 10, but the other stocks aid not
respond. The higher priced ones were about 6c
lower than on the preceding day under quiet trad
ing.
Advices received from the Occidental reported
the southwest drift on the 650 level in three feet
of ore that would assay from $35 to $10 per ton.

tons and 9cO pounds of ore, which was taken prin
cipally from the old stopes on the 1000 and 1100
levels.
G ray Eagi/eâ On the 19th bedrock was struck
in face on north side of tunnel, showing gravel of
the same quality they had 400 feet farther back, it
being mixed with many large and small bowlders.
The eruvel at first showed a prospect of $5 per
car, but since a daily improvement has taken
place, and it will now prospect about $7 per car,
the rock In face now beiii^a little more than one
foot and the gravel two feet in width, with indica
tions of getting thicker and the channel wider.
They have put sixteen curs of ore in the mill, and
the average will be much more as they work ahead
and open out.
Savahe- On the 950 level the north prospecting
drift started from the west crosscut, eighth floor of
north upraise, is advanced 22 feet and continues in
ore of good quality, end they have extracted and
hoisted 51 cars of ore from this drift. Car samples
average $33 80 per ton. In the north lateral drift
from the station on this level work has been dis
continued temporarily. In the north drift from
the eighth floor of the north upraise, at a point 26
feet north of the upraise, they have started an east
crosscut and advanced same 6 feet. Face is in
porphyry and bunches of quartz. The west cross
cut, started 90 feet nor;h of the north upraise, is
advanced 45 feet. Face is in quartz. Have cleaned
out and retimbered the west crosscut on the fourth
floor from the north upraise for a distance of 26
feet, at which point they have started a north
prospecting drift and advanced same 10 feet. Face

FOR CRUELTY TO A GIRL.
Professor Semati yon Hirsch, a
Musician, Arrested Yes
terday.
THE CHILD A STEPDAUGHTER.
Mrs. Prescott of the Children's Society
Obtained a Warrant on Com
plaint of Neighbors.
â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Jan. 29. )
Professor Semati J. yon Hirsch, a well
known local musician, was arrested to-day
for cruelty to his stepdaughter, Miss Alfie
Stiner. He has frequently, it is alleged,
beaten the girl, who is 15 years old, in a
cruel manner, and the Children's Society
caused tne musician's arrest.
Mis- Stiner has resided with her mother
and stepfather at 16 Telegraph avenue.
The mother of the girl is slichtly demented,
it is said, and was at one time in an
asylum. Owinc to her weakened mental
condition she has been unable to interfere
when Yon Hirsch beat her daughter, and
for her mother's sake the girl has never
complained.
The state of affairs has been imown to
the neighbors for some time, but came to
the ears of Mrs. Prescntt recently. As
s>oon as she heard of it commenced an
investigation, and this morning decided t<>
take the girl and nave the stepfather ar
reaied.
Accordingly she went to the school and
took the daughter, and together they went
before Prosecuting Attorney Moore and
swore to a complaint.
The girl is in appearance gentle, and
those who have interested themselves in
her case say she does not belie her look?.
":i t:.e other hand, they r.s?ert that Yon
Hirsch is a tyrant, and they tell tales of
the young laay bein^ covered with black
blue marks made by the h*eavy cane
with which the stepfat er would beat her.
Mrs. Prescott has taken charge of the
girl, and the professor is under arrest.

Mrs. Godfrey Remarries.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 29.â Jackson W.
Hart and Alice Earl Godfrey of this city

bride is the widow of George Godfrey, the
capitalist, whose divorce experiences fur

had so routed his estate that his widow
did not receive over $20,000 at the final dis- !
tribution. .

THE BOOTHS ARE TO GO
Official Information Sent to Every
Auxiliary Salvationist on
the Coast.
The Matter of Discipline Must Not
Re Viewed Frrftn a Purely Ameri
can Standpoint.
Oakland Office Bab Fkaxcisco Call,)
806 Broadway, Jan. 29. f
Some surprise was created among the
thousands of members of the Auxiliary
League of the Salvation Army yesterday by
the receipt by each of a letter from Mr?.
BalHngton Booth stating that the report
that she and her imsband had been ordered
toleave this country is true. Only a few
days aco the organ of the army on the Pa
cific Coast denied the report, but there is
now no room for doubt in the face of Mrs.
Booth's letter.
This news will be received with regret,
as while Mrs. Booth was at Dr. Coyle's
church recently several hundred of the
most influential members were enrolled in
the Auxiliary League. In San Francisco
Mayor Sutro, Judge Campbell and many
others joined the league at the solicitation
of the earnest young wife of the comman
der of the army in the United States, and
all looked forward to her future visits to
the coast.
The letters were all sent out from New
York and state that Commander and Mrs.
Booth are now preparing to leave.
The letter is replete with interest and is
as follows:
The Salvation- Army National Bkadqtjatbsso
120-1-4 West Fourteenth street, >
New York City. )
.*/â '/ Dear Friend : Both the commander and
myself feel that a; this time it Is only fair to us
and to you that we should write you a letter
explanatory of the newspaper reports, most of
which have been grossly incorrect and sensa
tional.
The farewell orders which we received were
by some means or other conveyed to the prc-ss
before the time we were j>repared to make
them known. This placed us in an exceed
ingly awkward position, as we had not suffi
cient facts to explain the matter to the public
at the time that tho press was already agitat
ing and sensationalizing on the matter.
We wish to state emphatically that we now
learn from international headquarters that
the orders for us to relinquish our command
are only iv accordance with orders issued to
other parts of the world at this time. Whereas
naturally the public of America are inclined to
look at this matter from the purely American
standpoint. There iÂ« also its world-wide aspect
which makes it difficult to countermand orders
in any one country without affecting others.
We are in no way responsible for the re
marks in the press concerning the relinquish
ing command. We have stated that there is
no idea of nnglicizing the army in this coun
try, nor are we being moved from any reasons
of dissatisfaction in oar work.
Loving the American field ns we do, and
feeling intensely for the welfare of our dear
people and their glorious misMon here, we call
most earnestly upon all friends to help them
and stand by them at what must be to them a
time of triiii. We do hope and trust that our
friends will crove their love for the cause by
continuing their friendship to the movement.
We have never, in any sense, sought to make
friends for ourselves personally, but in every
word of pen and Up WÂ« havacliampionod tiio
cause of God- and the army, and have striven
to Inculcate confidence in arm affection for the
movement in the hearts of our friends and of
the public.
In accordance with military discipline we
are preparing to fulfill the orders that have
been received by us, and our friends can best
show their confidence in us and their appre
ciation of our work by lovincly and prac
tically standing by the army throughout the
country.
Trying that the dear Lord's richest blessing
may rest upon you, and assuring you that our
hearts will ever be bound to yours, believe me,
dear friend, yours very truly, in loving interest
for America's welfare, Maud B. Booth.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1896.
NO WORD OF MISS PARKER
The Missing Girl Has Now
Been From Home Over
a Week.
WAS NOT ALWAYS HAPPY.
An Unfortunate Speculation in Busi
ness May Have Affected Her
Mind.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,'
008 Broadway. Jan. 29. f
The story of the mysterious disappear
ance of Miss Annie Parker of the First
Baptist Church, told exclusively in this
morning's Call, created a profound sensa
tion throughout the city, and especially in
chnrch circles. Although all efforts to
locate the missing young woman have
been redoubled, nothing has been learned
by the family and the affair is as much a
mystery as ever.
A. P. Parker, the brother of the missing
girl, has been telegraphing and telephon
ing to all points where it is thought any
information might be obtained, but he
learned nothing. The police on both
sides of the bay have received descriptions
of Miss Parker and several detectives are
following 'clews, but the case is so com
pletely wrapped in mystery that there is
absolutely no lead to follow.
It was learned to-day that Miss Parker
was frequently subject to periods of moodi
ness, although her relatives have not
noticed anything of the kind at home.
"Everything is as much a mystery as
ever," said Mrs. Parker this afternoon.
"Since Annie left, a week ago to-night, we
have been entirely in the dark as to her
whereabouts. We kept the affair a secret
as long as possible and hoped, of course,
to find her long before this.
"We cannot yet discover a single reason
that would throw any light on her disap
pearance. We can look back now and
think that we noticed some periods when
her mind eeemed to be engrossed with
something and she did not look particu
larly happy, but I do not think we should
ever have thought of it had it not been for
recent developments."
Mr. Parker furnished the following de
scription of his sister in the hope that it
might lead to her identity :
Height, 5 feet 3 inches; weight, 125 pounds;
brown hair and eyes. She wore a black sailor
hat trimmed with blue and a short black coat
with large sleeves. Her dress was of a brown
striped pattern.
Some of Mies Parker's friends said this
evening that the missing woman recently
started a dressmaking establishment that
did not prove the success that was antici
pated. This might have depressed Miss
Parker's spirits and have acted seriously
on her mind. The family will not discuss
the matter at all.
ATHLETICS AT BERKELEY.
Possibilities of Another Big Mccl
at Chicago Consid
ered.
Good Government and Progressive Clubs
Take Action Regarding a $200,000
Bond Issue.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 29.â Matters in
university athletic circles have begun
within the last few days to point very
strongly toward another big meet at
Chicago during the coming summer, with
the possibility of a second team entering
the list under the colors of the blue and
gold.
The letter received by A. W. North,
president of the Western Intercolleciate
Amateur Athletic Association, from Cap
tain Sheldon of YaJete track team Jast
week, expressing hope that a meet be
tween his men and the California boys
could be arranged for this season, was the
iirst spark which rekindled the tire of en
thusiasm in the breasts of the U. C.
athletes. Last year, when the California
team was in the East, they did rot meet
Yale at all, excepting in the Mott-Haven
games, and the prospect of arranging a
single contest with them for this year, as
well as with other teams, has awakened
much attention.
Heretofore it has not been possible to
determine who were the champion athletes
of America because of the fact that there
has heretofore existed and does now exist
an Intercollegiate Association, comprising
the colleges in the extreme East, and a
Western Intercollegiate Association, in
cluding in its scope about twenty colleges
near Chicago and west. President North
has suggested that the winners in these
two great associations meet each year to
determine not merely the collegiate cham
pions of a section of the country but of the
whole United States. The executive com
mittee of the Western Association lias
agreed to his proposition, and it now re
mains for the other association to fall in
line.
To-day a letter was received by the Uni
versity from John V. Crum, the noted
sprinter, who is now at Bedford, lowa, in
which he offers suggestions as to how vic
tory in the great National meet may be
made possible for Western men. Follow
ing is the purport of Crum's letter:
Being a Western man, I would like to sec
Western-colleges make better records in track,
athletics. I know that such things are possible.
The Western Intercollegiate Association meet
at Chicago. June 2, 1895, compared very favor
ably with the intercollegiate held at New York,
May 25, 1895, and the latter meet represented
ail'tho older â¢ colleges in the country. Now
what I wish to see is a meet between 'the win
ners of the intercollegiate and the win
ners of. the Western Intercollegiate, and I
believe the .Western team can -.win, if
the Western colleges begin to train
their men at once. The East has the best hur
dlers, weight men ana long-distance men, but
our long-distance men are fast coming to the
front, and so will our hurdlers and weight
men if they give it their attention. The East
has the advantage in having older men, but
the West has the advantage in numbers, hav
ing a greater number of colleges from which to
choose. This meet will not bo brought about
unless the Western colleges unite and pull
together. The West has been successful when
they have sent their baseball team Eastâ for
instance, Ann Arbor. Now, I have heard
judges say that several of the Western fool
ball teams would make the best Eastern teams
play, football to: beat them. Michigan has
proved this to bo true. .If this is true in re
gard to baseball and football, why will not the
Western colleges combine and take the win
ners of the Western intercollegiate East next
spring, and show that the : West amounts to
something in track athletics? But to , have a
successful meet the track captains must begin
work at once and the students must take some
interest. Colleges that have never taken any
interest should wake up and send a team to
Chicago. . .-â â â¢.-.'
I would suggest that the colleges pay all
their expenses to -Chicago and take the pro
ceeds to pay their expenses East. â¢ *- : .
I em out "of college athletics, but suggest this
meet, as I think it will raise the standard of
Western athletics. If the idea is carried out
it would be the largest athletic meet held this
year. . " . ' .. : .';- "â  j ._â¢ .

THE OLD MAN ELOQUENT.
Captain Healy Cites His Official
Record Against His
Accusers.
_â _____
NO KID GLOVES FOR HIS MEN*
Close of the Investigation Into the
Unalaska Episodeâ To-Day's
Programme.
"My services are a matter of record, and
I have no need to mention them."
Proud words they are, and prouder yet
they seemed when voiceu by Captain
Healy yesterday as he stood before his ac
cusers.
The investigation into the first set of
charges against the old captain is over.
These charges refer to alleged inebriety
and unofficerlike conduct on the captain's
part while at Unalaska in September of
last year. Ihe morning session was con
sumed in receiving the final testimony for
the defense.
H. N. Nice, agent of the North Ameri
can Commercial Company at Unalaska,
said he had seen the captain fall from the
wharf on the 18th of September. A num
ber of officers, with their wives and others,
numbering in all about fifty persons, were
on the wharf at the time. The witness
baa taken lunch with the captain and ac
companied him to the wharf. He ap
peared to be perfectly sober. After being
attended on the cutter Grant the captain
seemed to recover from the immediate ef
fects of his involuntary salt-water bath
and came ashore in a boat with Lieutenant
White, who walked with nim to the North
American Commercial Company's oflice.
W. O. Ditson, thirrt officei of the whaler
Mary D. Holmes, which was lying in
Unalaska harbor at the time, testified that
shortly before falling from the wharf the
captain boarded the Corwin, which was
alongside, walking over a narrow plank
which extended from the cutter to the
wharf. The distance from the wharf to
the surface of the water was about twelve
feet. He saw the captain fall, and thought
he had lost his balance. In all he observed
the captain's movements for about half an
hour, and discerned no indications of
intoxication.
Dr. Tnomas P. Bodkin, surgeon of the
Bear on her last cruise, said he did not
attend tne symposium aboard the Pheas
ant, but noticed Captain Healy going there.
He seemed sober then, at all events. After
the social Captain Garforth and other
officers of the Pheasant told him Lieuten
ant Berry had tried to pick a quarrel with
Captain Healy. Berry' 3 language was
characterized as very insulting, coming as
it did from a minor officer to nis superior.
Captain Healy seemed much hurt by
Berry's lacK of courtesy, and remarked
that if such a thing happened in the
British service the offender would be dis
missed forthwith. Though evidently much
incensed, Captain Healy's demeanor on
this occasion was that of a gentleman.
The witness further testified that he at
tended Captain Healy immediately after
his (all from the wharf. He found the old
man suffering from a severe strain in the
back. He displayed no signs of being un
der the influence of liquor. The witness
ordered the captain to remain ashore for
for nearly a week and submit to medical
treatment for his injuries. During the
trip from this port to Unalaska the cap
tain had suffered from la grippe and
from an obstinate congestion of the lungs
and was under treatment most of the
time. The witness emphatically denied
that he had ever treated the captain for
alcoholism, referring to a statement to
that effect as an unmitigated falsehood.
F. Wadsworth, first lieutenant of the
United States revenue cutter Rush, who
had been one of the witnesses for tne
prosecution, wa3 recalled, and in answer
to a question by the defendant's counsel
said he had known the captain for two
years and considered him in all respects a
competent officer, though rather too severe
in the matter of discipline.
The morning session here closed. After
lunch an unusual hurrying to and fro,
anil, if possible, a greater splendor in the
display of cotton gloves, gold lace and
other millinery, evinced that something
out of the common was about to take
place. As the afternoon session opened
Captain llealy took the stand and told his
story. He was asked very few questions,
being allowed to make his explanation in
his own way. At times during the recital
his voice trembled slightly and his eyes
flarhed with a fire like that of youth. The
mysterious, hostile wink, which had so
terrorized the tender heart of Lieutenant
Berry, was not called into requisition.
"I have been, in the United States reve
nue servicp," said the captain, "since
March, 1860, and have b en a seafaring
man for about forty-two years. It seems a
little stranpe after all those ysars to find
myself accused of unotficerlike conduct by
men whom I have formed. It looks as
though the surest way to gain an inferior's
hatred is to treat him with kindness and
indulgence. 1 know of no other way in
wnich to account for this combined effort
on the part of a few of my subordinates to
down me.
"On the evening of the 16th of Septem
ber, 1895, I accepted an invitation todinner
from Captain Garforth of the Pheasant.
Several other officers, among them Cap
tain Hooper, were also invited, and
formed part of the tratherintr. After dinner
we had a 'smoker,' and the sideboard of
the captain was at the disposal of his
guests. Lieutenant Berry of the Grant
addressed some impolite remarks to me.
I told him he was altogether too fresh, '
and hoped he would learn in time that
young and subordinate officials should
treat even their equals and inferiors, not
to mention their elders and superiors, with
gentlemanly courtesy.
"I think I also said such things wonld
not pass in the British service. I was
sober at the time, and here brand any
statement to the contrary, from what
source soever it may come, as a willful
and malicious lie.
"At the social in the quarters of the
North American Commercial Company,
on the following evening, I was not under
the influence of liquor, as ha? been falsely
sworn. A friend had warned me that
every word of mine wouid he noted and
every action watched. Then I realized
that, a conspiracy was on foot for my un
doing, and this thought grieved and an
gered me to such an extent that my man
ner must have betrayed the harassed and
disturbed condition of my mind. The cir
cumstances of my fall from the wharf at
Unalaska were as detailed by Dr. Bodkin,
who attended me. I lost my balance and
fell, because I did not, in the excitement
of leave-taking, look carefully where I
stood. Can that be an infallible proof that
I was drunk, against the word ol over fifty
witnesses?"
.When asked whether he was unduly
stilct in the enforcement of his com
mands, the captain replied :
"Perhaps I was. I have always done
mv duty as an officer, and I expect my
subordinates to do the same. However, I
do not recollect having treated any officer
with discourtesy during my entire official
life, and I have always worked harder
than the men whom I commanded. At
the same time, in the management of a
vessej, I allowed myself to be guided by
no other compass than my own, and did
not relish taking orders or impertinence
from my men, whatever their rank. When
I gave an order I did not smile, nor bow,
nor say 'if you please' ; and when I told a
man to haul a line, I did not have a
lackey near by to give him a pair of white
kid gloves beforehand.
"But no man could say I have pushed
myself ahead over the shoulders of my
subordinates. I have worked harder than
the best man among them. For 83 much
as forty-eight hours nt a stretch, when I
was afraid, as any sensible man would be,
to trust the fate of the vessel in their
inexperienced hands, I have stayed on
deck" to see the vessel through a storm or
pilot her throu-h some dangerous pas
sage. For two consecutive daja and
nights 1 have stayed alone in the crow's
nest on more that one occasion, suffering
from hunger and exposure, in order not to
fail in the performance of my duty.
"But no one can say that 1 have bragged
of my efficiency. Indeed I have never
needed to do so. " My services are a matter
of record and I am not obliged to speak of
them in order to bring tlieai to my coun
try's notice. In my reports there was no
big letter 'I,' was there, Reynolds?" and
as the old captuin put the question lie
looked the judge-advocate squarely in the
eye.
"Xo, captain," responded Lieutenant
Reynolds with unusual cordiality in his
expression and tone; "there was no 'l' in
your reports, and that was the only fault
in them. I am glad to have a chance to
answer your question, since my present
position renders it improper for me to
express my personal opinion of your ster
ling qualities as an officer."
A lieutenant and a young engineer were
introduced in rebuttal. They said the cap
tain did drink too much, whatever any
body else might say, and that Dr. Bon
kin's evidence was too much in the defend
ant's favor.
This closes the local procedure in refer
ence to tne Unalaska matter. To-day the
investigation into charges of misconduct
in this port and at sea will open. When
asked bow much longer the affair would
last a dear boy in a bewitching uniform
replied with a sigh:
"About two weefcs; at least I'm dread
fully afraid so."
OUT OF THE RED HILLS
A Queer Mining Region in the
Little Known Okancgan
Country.
Story of New Discoveries as Given by
C. S. Jennings, the Pioneer of
Coeur d'Alene.
C. S. Jennings, who has been for some
time in the new and little known Red Hill
district, in t':;e distant Okancgan country,
is in the City. The Red Hill region is
really a part of the Trail Creek country,
whose gold discoveries have attracted a
C. S.Jennings, Who Has Arrived From the
Red Hills.
good deal of attention during the past few
months. But it is a few miles this way
from the line of British Columbia, on
American soil.
"The Chawahwah River," said he, "runs
through the district, though until a year
or two ago nobody had ever heard of it.
There is also good pine and spruce timber
there. We are almost at the head of the
Chewahwah now, and only a couple of
miles inside Okanogan County, Washing
ton.
"The region is really a part of the Trail
CreeK country, whose gold discoveries
have grown important lately, many big
mines having been developed there.
"I have for a long time been interested
in Cceur d'Alene, Idaho, and was, in fact,
one of the first to go there. I have visited
almost every new region in that part of the
country, but never saw one more a'luring
in every way than that of Red Hill. It is
about fifty miles north of the Great
Northern Railroad."
Mr. Jennings, Sam Drumheller, the
Spokane banker, and others have lately
secured mining interests there. Mr. Jen
nines brought down samples of the ore.
"The district is a unique one," said he,
"and unlikje what most people would 01
--pect for a country promising riches 19
pretty to look at. 'it is called the Red Hill
District, because of the peculiar red color
of the hills thereabout. Mr. Drumheller,
myself and other associates have secured
ten properties there.
"it is not an arid region. Grass grows
all over the hills. The ore of the Red Hill
mines carries gold, silver and copper."
Mr. Jennings' home is at Spokane. He
will remain in San Francisco most of the
winter.
A Carpenters' Mass-Meeting.
At a meeting of the District Council of the
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners last
evening it was decided to hold a mass-meeting
of carpenters of this City and Oakland on the
evening ot Saturday, February 13. The pur
pose is to discuss matters of interest to the
unions and the adoption of ideas and plans
that have proved successful in the East. The
carpenters are looking for a prosperous season
in tne building trades and it is the desire to be
thoroughly organized so as to oe up with the
times. An invitation is extended to non-union
as well as union carpenters to attend the mass
meeting.

DAVIS TELLS HIS STORY.
The Board of Health Examines
the Market Inspec
tor.
WHY HE RELEASED SOLOMAN.
Some of the Points That Were Both.
ering the Health Officials
Cleared Up.
The Board of Health investigated the
sensational charges recently made by a
morning paper against Meat Inspector Ben
Davis, and while the latter had a bad hour
of it he came out with torn but flying
color?.
The charges were based on a transaction
that took place at the New City Hall some
time ago, when Milk Inspector Dockery
and Veterinary Burgeon Creely of the
board seized a cartload of calves which
were being brought into town by J. 8.
Soloman. Davis happened to come up
and learning of the seizure grew indig
nant at what he called interferencs with
his duties, and released the meat, saying
that it was all right.
Later he claimed that his indignation
was all feigned and that he had released
Soloman and his load so that he could re
arrest him in the act of seHinc it and thus
get a stronger case against him.
He declared that he had arrested Solo
man, taken the calves from him and deliv
ered them at the fertilizing works. The
main point made by those who were press
ing the charges was that it had been dis
covered that Soloman had sold Mark
Strouse ten calves, when if Davia had
seized three out of the eleven first found
in the wagon and Dr. Creely one, he could
not have delivered that number.
The defense explained this away by
producing a receipt from another butcher,
named Levy, showing that on the date of
the transaction Soloman had bought three
calves from him for $11. Soloman testi
fied and was corroborated by Strouse that
he had agreed to deliver ten ca!vi?s to the
Market-street butcher and that he had
therefore purchased them from a rival in
order to fulfill his contract. Davis' story
of the seizure after having once released
the butcher was corroborated by Soloman.
Soloman claimed that in spite of his ar
rest the calves he was selling were all of
sufficient age to make them lit for human
food. When asked why he had pleaded
guilty in the Police Court on a charge
growing OTit of the same transaction, of
selling immature veal, he said that he bad
done so to get out of the case as quickly as
possible, and because he did not wish to
get into trouble with the Board of Health.
Dennis Spencer, the attorney of the
board, and E. D. Crawford, the newspaper
reporter who wrote the articles reflecting
on Davis, cross-examined the inspector
and endeavored to draw from him certain
facts regarding the time he had taken to
follow Soloman to Strouse's market, make
the seizure, convey the three calves that
were seized to fertilizing works and return
to the new City Hall.
According to the line of their questions
he must have accomplished all this within
forty minutes. Davis claimed that this
might have been possible, but declined to
accept their estimates of time, saying that
as he had not consulted his watch he was
not at all sure that he had left the hall or
any other place at any certain time.
The board was evidently not much im
pressed by the evidence of the prosecu
tion, as shown by the manner in which
the testimony was handled, and took the
matter under advisement, promising to
examine the transcripts carefully and ren
der a decision at an early date.
y , V NEW TO-DAY.
Gladness Comes
With a better understanding of the
V V transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâgentle efforts â pleasant efforts â
rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it 'is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial effects, to note when you pur-
. chase, that you have the genuine article,
which is manufactured by the California
Fig Syrup Co. only, and sold by all rep-
utable druggists.
If in the enjoyment of . good health,
and the system is regular, then laxa-
tives or other remedies are not needed.
If afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the roost skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
then one should have the best, and with
the well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

BUYING NATIONAL BONDS
Alfred Tobin of the Hibernia
Bank Is Busy in Wall
Street.
WANTS AT LEAST A MILLION.
The Bank Refused to Enter Any
Syndicate for Manipulation of
United States Bonds.
San Francisco is to get its share of the
new issue of United States bondsâ pro-
vided the AYall-street syndicate does not
raise trie premium or secure the control of
the whole issue. At the present time
financiers are gathered in New York, all
imbued with the one common desire to
buy bonds from Uncle Sam, and for that
reason financial circles are deeply inter
ested in whatever transpires in connection
with the gigantic deal.
The Hibernin Bank wants to invest a
million or more in the new bonds, al
though its last dividend is just the same
as the interest to be derived from the Gov
ernment. A week ago Alfred Tobin,
attorney for the Hibernia Bank, went to
New York to mingle among the money
dealers. He arrived t.'iere Monday, and
has since been making a quiet investiga
tion of the situation in Wall street. His
mission is to secure United States bonds
of the new i.-stu-. and to do so at the beet
terms possible â that is, CO buy from the
Government without having to pay out a
heavy premium.
James K. Kelly, president of the bank,
Eaid yesterday that Mr. Tobin would be
guided by the board of directors in his ac
tions.
"The understanding at present is that
a premium of 1Â§ per cent will be charged
fvii the bonds," said Mr. Kelly. "At that
rate the interest would be not more than
about 3 1-10 per cent. This is a very
small return, it is true, but United States
bonds are always readily converted into
cash. In case of any unusual demand a
bank with 52.000 depusitms, as we have, it
would be necessary to control several mil
lion dollars without delay. Now, if cash
in that amount were kept in the vaults we
should have to pay the taxes of -'.25 per
cent UDon SO much idle capital, whereas if
invested in United States bouds it would
be exemiit from taxation. These are
points which we consider, as a matter of
course, in making investments in Govern
ment bond ? ."
"Then how can you pay 4 per cent?"
"1 am not certain that we will pay that
for this naif year. The dividend of 4 per
cent to depositors recently declared was
upon deposits up to January 1, 1896. No
one can say what the dividends will be for
the ensuing six months, for who can tell
what the tax levy will be? Taxes may
be lower this year, but there is no appar
ent reason now why they should be. So
if taxes remain the same I have no doubt
but that interest on savings banks depos
its will be still lower than for the last
term. We really did not earn 4 per cent
all round, although that was our dividend.
The possibility is that interest will be
lower in future."
'It has been stated that the Hibernia
Bant, through Alfred Tobin, was negotiat
ing to enter the bond syndicate."
"There is no truth "in that," Mr. Kelly
replied. "We are not uniting with any
body to manipulate United Stmes bonds.
Mr. Tobin is doing his business alone and
making inquiries as to vrhat premium he
must pay for the bonds. "\Ve will likely
buy $1,000,< 00 In bonds if we can get them
at a premium of 15 per cent or less; and if
jnucii better terms were made we might
buy more.
"These bonds are issued at 4 percent.
Now, if Congress was patriotic and de
clared &n issue at 3 per cent the President
could sell $1,GUO,OOO : OOO of bonds in the
United States as readily as $50,000,000 at 4
per cent. As it is the bonds are worth
more than their face value, though they
are ultimately redeemed only at that
value.
"We have not yet heard from Mr. Tobin,
but I can assure you he has nothing to do
with the syndicate. Mr. Kelly, ihe son of
Eugene Kelly, suggested our rafting with
him in buying bond", and he wa: desirous
of placing some of the oonds here in San
Francisco. We declined, however, so
even in this particular there could be no
syndicate."

Some of the leading t. layers of the Occi
dental Handball Club have had trouble
with the managers of the court and are
now members of the San Francisco Hand
ball Club. It apcears that jealous rivalry
has been existing between the courts' man
agers, and recently some of the players of
the San Francisco ball court were invited
by two of the leading representatives of
the Occidental Club to play a few games in
the court of the latter. Manager McGlynn
took umbrage at this, and informed 'the
athletes who had extended an invitation to
outsiders to play in the Occidental court
that they had transgressed the rules of the
club, and must not do so again.
The upshot of the whole affair is that
James C. Nealon, John Bonnet and one or
two others have resinned from the Occi
dental Club and are now full-fledeed mem
bers of the San Francisco Handball Club.
This afternoon a very interesting match
will be played in the San Francisco court
between Bonnet and Hutchinson and
Nealon and Donnelly, best three games of

his opinion of me and wish himself back in

A SECOND TEST SUIT.
Los Angeles Wants the Primary I,aw
Decided and Accordingly Files
a New Appeal.
The Supervisors of Los Angeles County
have added another suit to the one already
pending in the Supreme Court to teat the
validity of the new primary law. This
second suit is an appeal from the decision
of Judjje Van Dyke, which declared the
law spec'.al and local, and therefore uncon
stitutional.
The case was filed in the Supreme Court
yesterday morning and was submitted at
once. The issues presented are more gen
eral than those in the suit of Getz against
the Supervisors of Sacramento County,
and it is quite probable that a decision will
be reached in the Los Angeles case before
the Sacramento case has been decided.
Judge Van Dyke's opinion is made part of
the record.
To be of any use the opinion in each case
must be in before to-morrow.
The original case was brought by Martin
C. Marsh ;m<i was for an injunction re
straining the Supervisors of Los Angeles
trom purchasing the ballot-boxes necessary
to be used in the primary election under
the new law. The injunction was granted.

JOHN ROGERS,
BORN IN 1792.
The Story of a Man From
Malta, Now in Poverty
at Oakland.
ALONE IN AN OLD BARN.
Penniless and Without a Rela
tive, and Waiting Only
for Death.
HE WAS IN THE WAR OF 1812.
Coming to California in the Early Min
ing Eays, He Acquired Wealth
and Lost It.
Oakland Ornrr Sas Fbajtcisco Call,)
roadway, Jan. 29. \
Never has an otlk-L-r of the Humane So
ciety visited a place of squalor that can
compare with the miarters occupied by
John Rogers, 104 years old, near the foot
John Hogers of Oakland, Who Was Born in .Malta in 1792 and Came to This Country
a Century Ago.
of Jefferson street. The sole human occu
pani of the place which was visited by the
Humane Society's secretary to-day baa
lived four years longer than a century,
and, with his horse, he inhabits an old
barn turough which the bright sunshine
came generously. During the recent
storms tne rains came with equal freedom.
The seepage from the portion of the
shanty that is partitioned off for the horse
trickles across the portion occupied by the
centenarian and keeps muddy the floor of
earth. Ail around the walls are rags and
refir'tcff tinware that have been gathered by
the old man during many years. The bat
tered stove, held together by rusty wire,
was bought thirty years ago at a second
hand store in San Francisco, and is long
past the age of usefulness.
A fewcracKed and rusty pans and pots
complete the apology for eating apparatus,
and of furniture there is not a vestige. A
sack of rags is the only bed the old man
ha* slept on for years, and now it is soaked
and covered with mildew. There is not a
dry corner in the place and the rats hold
high carnival night and day.
But although he lacks any comfort
known to civilization, old John Rogers is
careful that his poor old horse shail be
made as comfortable as circumstances will
permit, and the only tight piece of roof is
over the trembling, shaggy quadruped.
The neighbors say that when they give
John food the horse will be attended to
first, and if there is any left the old man
will eat it.
Rogers is a study, no matter from which
standpoint he is viewed. The abject pov
erty and squalor are pitiable. The man
does not seem to feel the cold, and bis skin
is like -wrinkled leather. For half a cen
tury he has worn a rosary around his neck,
and has never failed to daily use it. The
beads have been so long around his neck
that there is a groove into which they fall
from having been so long, buttoned close
to the skin. Rogers prizes th.3t rosary and
says the Archbishop of Malta pave it him
more than a lifetime ago. Hunger and
privation do not seem to have lessened his
devotion, for old John still retains all his
early reverence.
In one respect nature has been kind to

the centenarian. During the past few
months his mind has shown signs of giv
ing way and what would be hardship to
others are unnoticed by him. As he sat
this afternoon, cold and hunprry, on the
top of an old chest, his greatest anxiety
was for his horse and he feared that the
bowl of boiled potatoes with which he fed
his favorite was not sufficient. For him
self he had no thought.
Little by little the centenarian un
folded the romantic chapters of ois life's
history.
He was born at Malta in 1792 and came
to this country when he was 7 years of
age. In the historic war of 1812 Rogers
was a soldier and, although he does not
remember the details of his early warlike
experience, he still retains his recollection
of dates.
Years ago, in the early fifties, Rogers
came to California in the ship Thompson,
of which he was the second mate. Ke
deserted, like thousands of others, and
rushed to the gold mines, and although
then a comparatively old man he took
quite a fortune out of the earth.
"What did you do with it?" he was
asked.
"It went just as fast as I could throw it
away â yes, throw it away."
While in Seattle twenty years ago Rogers
was robbed of what little he had and since
then he has been a broken-down peddler.
During the last year he has been unable to
go around with his horse and wagon and
has received some aid from the Super
visors. Now he is utterly incapable to help
himself at all and it is urged that he should
be housed in some public institution.
Words cannot picture the extreme priva
tion that Ropers now struggles against.
He has not a friend or a relative, is with
out a cent, a bed or a meal ; yet he uncom
plainingly looks forward to the grave
daily, deriving some little solace from
faithfully going through his rosary without
missing a single bead.
ARCHITECT AIKEN'S WAY.
Throws the Blame for His Delay
Upon the Federal
Judges.
Accordingly They Have Interested
Senators Perkins and White as
to Their Needs.
United States Judges McKenna and !
Morrow have evidently been made use of j
by Government Architect Aiken as scape
goats to explain his delay with the plans
for the new Federal buildine.
Some time ago they found that the
plans which Mr. Aikon inherited from his
predecessor provided for much poorer ac
commodations in the way of courtrooms,
chambers, clerks' offices and libraries than
they have now. The Judges need more
room, instead of ltss, and tne man who
drew the original plans seemed to have
had a very poor appreciation of the de
mands of justice. The way the rooms
were located, too, did not allow for light,
ventilation or quietude, to say nothing of
space. The Federal Judges are the cus
todians of the old Spanish archives, and
they need plenty of room, and they are
naturally entitled to decent accommoda
tions.
Mr. Aiken had allowed the impression
to get out that the delay in the plans was
due to the tardiness of the Judges in mak
ing known to him their needs, but the
fact is, according to statements made by
both jurists yesterday, that they had al
ready sent on to "Washington their sug
gestions as to the alterations required in
the plan?, but heard nothing more of the
matter until Mr. Aiken's visit here. They
then called upon him and talked things
over and they learned that he was totally
unaware of their communication. How
ever he suggested that they formulate
their plans again, and they did so, audit
was supposed Mr. Aiken would remodel
his plans after his return to Washington.
Their recommendations went no further,
though, and even when they sent on a po
lite note of inquiry the supervising archi
tect did not have the grace to reply to it.
All the satisfaction they ever trot was the
quoted newspaper interview of Mr. Aiken
throwing the blame for the delay on them.
Finally Judge McKenna, on behalf of
Judge Morrow and himself, communi
cated witn Senator Perkins. The Senator's
answer came promptly and informed
them that both he and Senator White
would give the matter immediate atten
tion.
Mr. Aiken still tries to make them the
scapegoats for his own carelessness, pro
crastination and neglect of duty.
Once More the "Chutes."
At last the sun has made its reappearance
after an absence of many days, and the some
what damp "chutes" and "trolley," on Haight
street, have put on a cheerful appearance oiice
more and resumed operations. The manage
ment is now prepared to comfortably accomo
date crowds of any size, and business will be
larger, if anything, than before the rains.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 1896.
ITS SCHEDULES
DEFY THE LAW.
: The Southern Pacific Run
ning High-Speed Trains
in the City.
THIRTY MILES AN HOUR.
An Entire Disregard of the Legal
Provisions for Safety at
Crossings.
TWO SETS OF INSTRUCTIONS.
1
Employes Asked to Conform to Each
Though One Is Directly Opposed
to the Other.
In connection with the two wrecks that
have occurred on the coast division atten
j tion has been drawn to the methods em
! ployed by the Southern Pacific to evade
I both the law and the responsibility for ac
cidents.
According to the company's printed
rules and time-tables directly contradic
tory orders are given to the men who oper
ate the trains on this division.
In the special instructions to employes
rule G is as follows:
Trains will not run faster in city and town
limits than the speed allowed by law, namely,
fcan Francisco, eight miles per hour. * * *
The time-table of the coast division line
from here to Monterey shows tiiat trains
are run within the City limits of San Fran
cisco at a speed that is never less than an
average of fifteen miles an hour, and which
in two instances is an average of thirty
miles an hour, or nearly four times the
legal rate of speed.
Where the company comes nearest to
observing the City ordinance prescribiug
the eight-mile speed limit within the City
is on the daily passenger train which
leaves here at 6:45 a. m. and runs through
to Hillsdale, five miles the other side of
San Jose. The run from Third and Town
send streets to the Valencia-street station,
a distance of three miles, is made in
twelve minutes, an average of a mile in
four minutes, or fifteen miles an hour.
Then from Valencia street to Ocean
View the train reaches the thirty-miles
an-hour speed. The distance between these
points is four miles, and it is covered in
eitiht minutes, or should be according to
the time-table, thus giving a speed of a
mile in two minutes. But this is not an
isolated instance, for the same speed is
shown by the time-table for the daily San i
Jose express, which leaves this City at
5:30 o'clock, the train on which Eugineer
I Keyer lost his life last Sunday,
n trains leave this City from Third
Townsend streets each day, a few of
h, however, do not run on Sundays,
every one of them is operated on a
time schedule that is a gross violation of
the law, and the same holds good of the
ten trains that arrive daily at this point.
This state of affairs is one that has] long
been a source of bitter complaint with
people who reside along the line of the
road, and the killing of Mrs. Ellen Fury
on Monday last would have been avoided,
it is claimed, had the trains been operated
according to law.
Railroad men who are familiar with the
coast division run, and who knew Jack
Keyer, the victim of the wreck near Baden
on Sunday, are positive tnat the dead en
gineer did not know of a red light signal
Hashed for him. They say Keyer was too
old a man in the business and too careful
to have taken any chances such as Fireman
Gill says he took. The general opinion is
that Gill was not properly attending to his
duty, ana that in order to make it appear
that he was he claimed to have seen ihe
signal, and to have communicated the fact
to the engineer.
One of these men explained his reasons
for believing this theory as follows:
"In making the run between Ocean
View and Baden the encine is generally
allow to run by gravity, as there is
Kicient grade. In consequence there is
need of the fireman attending to the
ies of keeping up the fire in the furnace
01 the engine, and when a fireman is not
employed in 'tiring' he is expected to
keep on the lookout for danger of all
kinds. Now, the chances are that Gill was
I not strictly attending to his duties and
failed to see the signal, which was on his
side of the cab."
It was further stated by a former rail
road employe that the accident at the
| Santa Clara crossing was not a matter of
much surprise to those who have worked
on either the narrow-gauge or broad-<Â»auge
road. It is almost the invariable rule for
the trains at this point to violate the State
1 law, which requires all trains to stop not
! less than 200 feet from a railroad crossing.
I In this case the railroad men say ihere
i was the same disregard of rules and law
I and that in the race that took place to see
; which train could make the crossing tirat
j the collision was brought about.
They add that had tbe law been com
| plied with such a collision as that which
I occurred on Saturday would have been
impossible. The trains wonld have come
j to a full stop each about 300 feet from the
crossing. Thus there would have been no
danger of a collision. But trains moving
toward one another, they say, present a
very different proposition.
The railroad officials who have been in
vestigating the train wrecks of Saturday
and Sunday are not ready to make public
their conclusions as to who is to be held
responsible. They claim they are waiting
for additional witnesses, among others
Engineer Stanley, who is still unable to
give testimony.
It has been feared that the injured engi
neer would have to lose his leg, but it was
concluded by the physicians yesterday
that amputation would not be necessary.
Huelinantel'g Alimony.
Bernard Huelmantel had been ordered to
pay his ex-wife, Caroline Huelmantel, $15 a
month alimony, and he is now under contempt
of court for not doing so. He was before the
court on an order to show cause yesterday and
he was adjudged guilty of contempt. He was
given until to-morrow to pay up his alimony,
however, and if he has not settled up by that
time he will be sent to jail.
A Jeweler Fails.
Nat M. Raphael, retail jeweler, on Kearny
street, near Sutter, has failed for about
$40,000. He owes his father $5000 and his
father-in-law $2000. He also owes Phelps &
M iller $1 '2,000 and M. Schussler $2100. There
is due Eastern cieditors about $20,000. The
assets of the store are of uncertain value. He
attributes his failure to depression in business
and will make some settlement with his
creditors.
