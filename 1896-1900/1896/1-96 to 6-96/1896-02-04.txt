Color Every Defeat With a Tinge

HAVANA, Cuba., Feb. 1 (via Tampa,
Fla., Feb. 3).â Gomez has crossed the
strategic line between Havana and Bata
bano iwice witnin a week. He had no
serious difficulty either time, although
the wall of men is the strongest one ever
thrown across the island by Spain.
Troops have been drawn from all parts of
tbe island to" make it invulnerable and
several thousand volunteers have been
added to the force of regulars along the
line. With these preparations and the
building of blocK houses of wood and stone,
the throwing of earthworks and the
transforming of railroad stations, churches
and dwellings into forts, the daring rough
riders of Gomez pushed through the lines,
leaving at each dash a few dead and
wounded Spaniards to mark their passage.
Every time the line is crossed the authori
ties at the palace, who sift all news pub
lished here, or cabled direct, eliminate all
reference to the crossing, and state m offi
cial reports that Gomez was driven away.
After the rebel chief had gone west to
the line an official report of an encounter
with him near duanajay revealed his
whereabouts. He was officially reported
to be in Pinar del Rio Thursday, but was
giving General Canelia a. serious time on
the line south of Bejucal. It is two days
since that right and no official report of
the encounter has been given out. It is
pretty well understood that General
Canelia and 800 men would have been
wiped out by Gomez and his 4000 men had
not Colonel Galvis come to tbe rescue
with re-enforcements.
â ttbe hospitals i are^f oll^of wounded â sol â¢
th . usaiuTs nave died on the'.field,
aespite'" the light losses given in the
Spanish reports. Twice each day i the
Government issues reports to the local
papers and the foreign correspondents.
The press censor hands them out and all
news published here or cabled abroad must
conform to these reports. Similar reports
are cabled to the Spanish Ministers at
Washington, London and Paris. Mar
tinez Campos said that these reports were
ludicrous, every press ceusor who has held
the position has said that they are absurd ;
no intelligent American has any faitL in
them; but, forsooth, the correspondents
are compelled to send these misleading
reports or give up the use of the cables.
General Marin is now at Quivican, eigh
teen miles south of Havana. He missed
his great opportunity of penning both
Gomez and Maceo in Pinar del Rio pro
vince by starting one day late. Now he
has Gomez on one side of the line and
Maceo on the other and will try to prevent
their meeting.
While practically all the Spanish forces
which can be spared from guarding the
cities are concentrated about the strategic
line in an effort to maintain its impregna-
bility the various bands of insurgents
roam at will in all the provinces of Cuba.
In Santiago there are frequent encounters
and all grinding of cane has been
stopped. The same is true of Santa Clara
and Puerto Principe. In Matanzas the
whole interior of the province is alive
with rebels. La Crete has united a dozen
small bands, and has nearly 2000 men un
der him. They have had daily encounters
with Spanish troops, and continue gaining
in strength.
In Pinar del Rio, Maceo is returning to
the Havana border after a triumphal cam
paign, and had turned away thousands
who wished to join his army. The few
Spanish troops in the province had suc
ceeded in holding the capital city and.
Coloma, its port, but every other town has
been entered and occupied by Maceo in
Havana province.
Spain has over 50,000 troops and holds
one railroad line â the one now converted
into tne trocha due south from this city.
Every town on it is now occupied by a
strong force, and every train has several
carloads of trooos. The Western Railroad
is partially abandoned beyond Salud, which
is fifteen miles from here: the Guanajay
road is abandoned beyond San Antonio,
about seventeen miles from here, and the
Matanzas road operates only about eigh
teen miles to the eastward. The road
from San Felipe east of Guines and Union
has been in the hands of the enemy for
days. Tne last attempt to run a train re
sulted in the capture of the engineer and
lireman of the exploring engine.

TORTURED- AXl> HAXOEI).
Cruelties Inflicted Vpon Cubans Cap
tured by the Spanish.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba, Jan. 26
(via Tampa, Fla., Feb. 3).â A horrible
crime was perpetrated on the estate of the
Juragua Iron Mining Company on the 20th
inst. Three Spanish soldiers armed with
guns left the village of Armesa to ask alms,
and were met by a party of rebels who
killed the soldiers with machetes, taking
their guns and ammunition. As soon as
this -was known the chief of the Spanish
forces of that place ordered the imprison
ment of all the Cubans working the Jura
gua mines. The order was obeyed, but of
the entire force of Cuban laborers in the
mines the Spaniards could catch only
eighteen or twenty, as che others ran away
and joined the insurgents.
Some of the unfortunate prisoners, after
having been barbarously beaten, were
hanged, some by the neck and others by
the feet, or tortured until they died. A
few escaped, but they were in a terrible
state. The survivors have been brought
to this city and are in jail, twelve in
number.
The steamer Maria Herrerera brought
yesterday from Puerto Fardre twelve politi
cal prisoners, all prominent residents of
that place. Among them were the presi
dent of the Autonomist party of the town,
Dr. Jose Maceo and his son. They were
all handcuffed and have been lodged in
jail.
On the 20th inst., a Spanish column
under Captain Sosa met the rebel party of
Colonel Delgado, 300 strong, in Los Llanos,
Sabana ai\d Far.rallones, Baracoa. The
troops had six killed and thirty wounded.
The rebels abandoned the camp, leaving
four killrd. Yellow fever has caused 490
deaths in the military hospitals of this city
from July 1 to December 31 of last year. In
this number are not included the soldiers
who have died in the hospitals of Congo,
San Luis, Cobore, Canye. Palma, Soriano
and Juragoa.
On the 18th inst. the Spanish colonel,
Moncado,with his column, entered Bayamo
after being out of the city for several days.
He had several light encounters with the
rebels, who killed five of his men. He
brought to Bayamo nineteen wounded and
forty sick soldiers.

HATRED FOR AMERICAN'S.
The Spanish Take A'o I'aina to Conceal It
in Cuba,
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 1 (via Tampa,
Fia., Feb. 3).â American residents here
are becoming alarmed as to their safety in
case tbe report of tiie Committee on For
eign Affairs becomes a law. The news of
the action of tbe committee caused many
bitter utterances in the local papers against
Americans. The feeling against Americans
has been fed by newspapers and public
utterances . of rabid Spanish office-holders
to the effect that the United States is to
blame for all the trouble that has come
upon Spain. The feel ing has been intensi
fied since the recall of Campos, and Amer
ican citizens who are merchants, business
men, professional men and who are per
manent residents here are very much
worked up over the outlook. They would
feel mucti more secure if one of Uncle
Sam's warships were anchored in the har
bor.
Already reports of severe measures
against suspects are coming in. The in
tense Spanish hatred for Cubans which
led to horrible atrocities in the last war is
beginning to manifest itself. Only to-day
at Hoyo Colorado, a little town eighteen
miles southwest of Havana, a Cuban
named Venatio Suarez, who had been ar
rested on suspicion, was shot dead oy his
guards. A list containing 100 names of
suspects was made up to the commander
of the volunteers. Most of , those
on the list fled to the city,
bat others were arrested. One of
them was the unfortunate Suarez. Re
ports of arrests are made daily, but no
further mention of trial or release or exe
cution of prisoners is made. In some
cases the persons arrested are members of
prominent families and political influence
is used to save them. The fear of these
arrests and of harsh measures when
Weyler arrives crowds every going
steamer with Cubans who are fleeing to
the States or to Mexico and South
America.
HASTILY BEXT TO BAT Ay A.
A Warship Dispatched to Protect British
Subjects.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Feb. 3.â The Brit
ish warship Mohawk was dispatched has
tily this afternoon from this port to Ha
vana. It is thought by many persons here
that the cause of her sudden departure
was that there had been a revolt among
the Spanish volunteers in the Cuban capi
tal and that the Mohawk has been sent to
protect the lives and property of British
subjects.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â The ru
mor from Kingston, Jamaica, based upon
the departure of the British warship Mo
hawk from that port, that a revolt had oc
curred among the Spanish volunteers in
Havana was pronounced as absurd by
Senor Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish Min
ister, to-night. He said he had no infor
mation on the subject.
"Just look at the map and see the rela
tive positions of Kingston and Havana
and you will understand how impossible
it is for persons in Kingston to be pos
sessed of information on the subject while
the rest of tne world is ignorant," said the
Minister.
Senor de Lome this evening received un
official Information of a victory of seven
troops of Spanish cavalry under the com
mander-in-cbief over a body of insur
gents on the Ban Antonio plantation, near
Artjmisa, and he said the rumor may have
had its origin in that occurrence.

SAX FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
UNDER THE CATHODE RAY.
DR. M`GLYNN
ON SINGLE TAX
In the Discourses He Has
Not Violated Rules of
the Church.
SANCTIONED BY SATOLLI
Careful in the Speeches Not to
Conflict With Teachings of
Moral Law.
IN THE DELAWARE CAMPAIGN.
The Noted Priest Making Good Prog
ress in Expounding the Theories
of Henry George.
WILMINGTON, Del., Feb. 3.-Dr. Ed
ward McGlynn, the famous priest and ora
tor, arrived here last night to deliver a
series of lectures in this city on the single
tax. In an interview to-day Dr. McGlynn
spoke of the story published a few days
ago that he was jn trouble with the church
again. The story, which came from New
York and appeared in a Philadelphia
newspaper, said that Dr. McGlynn had in
curred the displeasure of Archbishop Wil
liams of Boston by delivering a lecture on
the single tax in that city on Sunday
evening, January 26. after the Archbishop
had requested him not to do so. The
story further stated that Dr. McGlynn's
conduct had given the Archbishop such
great offense that he was constrained to
bring the matter to the attention of Arch
bishop Corrigan.
Speaking of his visit to Wilmington and
his right to lecture on the single tax, Dr.
McGlynn said:
"I cannot forget that I am a Christian
and a priest, and, while I am not endeav
oring to commit the Christian church to
the single tax, I will always be careful to
teach nothing that will conflict with the
teachings of the moral law and of re-
ligion."
Referring to the statement that he was
in trouble again, Dr. McGlynn denied it
emphatically, and then said:
"If any one should still doubt my right,
though a Catholic and a priest, to teach
the doctrine of single tax upon secular
platforms it should be sufficient in order
to remove such doubt to recall the fact
that a very iull, explicit and unreserved
exposition of the single-tax doctrine was
submitted by me to the apostolic delegate,
Monsignor now Cardinal^ Satohi, and by
him submitted to .the fpur theologians of
the Catholic university in Washington,
who gave written attestation that the ex
position of the doctrine contained nothing
contrary to the teachings of the Catholic
religion.
"I submitted at the same time to Mgr.
Batolli an accurate Italian translation
made myself of the paper and without
any retraction of the doctrine. He de%
clawd nift fr<? s.il ecclesiasii<Â»i cen
sure and to be -a; priest in f eood and full
standing in tbe Catnolic cbui%h. ; ; 1
"Some of the portions of my paper sub
mitted to Satolli which seems to be most
radical and almost socialistic were taken
verbatim, although without quotes, from
the authorized encyclical of Pope Leo
XIII on the condition of labor. One
might also think it to be a minimizing of
the doctrine of single tax taken verbatim,
although without quotation marks, from
the letter of Henry George to Pope Leo
XIII."
Dr. McGlynn further said that when he
delivered a lecture on the single tax he
simply exercised his right as a student of
political economy, a free, untrammeled
thinker and a moralist. In his address
at the Grand Opera-house he spoke of
"The Politics and Economics of the Lord's
Prayer."
To-night he delivered a lecture at the
Auditorium in which he explained the
practical side of the single tax.

MISDEEDS OF DE ANDRADE
Recall of the Governor- General
of the Portuguese Colony
of Goa.
Sent Untrue Reports and Permitted
Adherents to Plunder and
Murder.
LONDON, Ekg., Feb. 3.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Lisbon say's that
R. de Andrade, Governor-General of Goa,
the Portuguese colony in India, has been
recalled by the Government. Goa has
been the scei of a revolt against t^e
Portuguese ay norities and a number of
the troops there have joined the rebels.
It has been discovered that the tele
grams Font to Lisbon by De Andrade, tell
ing of bloody combats with and victories
over the rebels were apocryphal, in his
dispatches he mentioned officers who were
worthy of distinction for the valor dis
played by them in face of the enemy.
These officers, it transpires, are personal
friends of the Governor-Generai, and it
has been further proved that neither they
nor the troops have ever met the rebels.
De Andrade increased his own salary
from six to tencontosof reis and permitted
his adherents to plunder and murder peo
ple in the colony. It is likely that he will
be severely punished,
HUNTINGTON`S
MEN NOT IDLE
Forces Combined for the De
feat of the Repeal
Bill.
TO SAVE THE CHARTER.
Probability of Col. Breckinridge
Joining the Army of
Lobbyists.
AN ANTI-POOLING MEASURE.
â 
It May Cut Off Some Support From
Goebel in His Fight Against the
Southern Pacific.
FRANKFORT, Xt m Feb. 3.â The fight
against the Southern Pacific charter is
quietly being made, and besides an array
of lawyer lobbyists who have been ad
vising members and Senators against the
bill, literature, pro and con, is pouring in,
addressed "personal" and marked with
red pencils. Personal letters have been
indited to each legislator.
Among these documents are letters re
ceived to-day and marked: "Compliments
Â©f Adolph Sutro, Mayor of San Francisco,
California." In each of tbese letters were
printed extracts from The Call of January
25, 1896, reading: "The funding bill is
doomed," and on the 22d, "Resolutions
regarding the funding bill passed," and
printed with heavy red letters across the
back, "Corruption and bribery will not
carry the day," and "Chamber of Com
merce demands foreclosure."
Senator Goebel is awakened to the oppo
sition to his bill that is now developing,
bnt is confident of its passage.
Sunday morning found but a minorit y
of either house of the Legislature in
Frankfort. The town itself, with some
6000 inhabitants, has but few attractions
to keep them here. Many went to ttieir
homes, some to Cincinnati and Coving
ton, while quite a delegation went down to
Louisville. Some of these returned to-day
at 11 o'clock, while some did not show up
in their seats at all to-day. They usually
take the precaution to "pair" off before
they leave.
Nothing, however, has transpired to-day
calling special attention to their absence.
Little work is expected from the Monday
session. Huntington's lobbymen, leaving
enough hers to guard the "slain," went
with the crowd and contributed their
small mite to the jollity of the occasion.
Things were "wide open" at Sulbach &
Rassinier's, the usual stopping place of
the Frankfort Saturday night delegation.
In the private parlor upstairs at the for
mer there was an ail-night session, to
which some well-known Louisville men
lent their presence and, it is said, created
some surprise on the part of certain mem
bers of the Legislature at the interest they
took in the Southern Pacific bill and the
warmth with which they opposed it.
Among them was a prominent Louisville
attorney who was before- the Judiciary
Committee of the House in Frankfort last
week opposing the anti-poolroom bill.
Some of the members were guests of the
Pendennis Club, of which General John
Echols anil St. John Bogle, receivers of
Mr. Huntington's C. and O. and S. W.
Railroad, General Basil W. Duke and
James P. Helon, the railroad attorneys,
are members. It is, of course, not sup
posed for a moment that "Old Smoothing
Iron" would intrude any remarks about
vested rights or power to repeal a charter
to disturb the conviviality of a Saturday
night supper, or let such things come to
disturb a quiet Sunday conversation, or
that his interest iv any railroad in the
world keep him from church; nor should
his associates be suspected of such things
any sooner than he.
It is also safe to say that Huntington's
men, like the "busy bee," have been im
proving each shining hour, and that
their work during this recess will count
when the bills come up. This will be seen
first in the delay of the Senate committee
in reporting the bill. Last week it was
said that they would report it to-morrow.
That is now impossible as they have not
yet considered it in the committee and
they can hardly do so before Wednesday
at the earliest with the other work they
have before them.
Senator Goebel, as usual, went to his
home in Covington to spend Sunday. The
Huntington people know that it is useless
to work with him as well as some others
on the committee. It was said positively
iast week that the committee would agree
on a favorable report- when it met. While
this is likely it is by no means certain.
The anti-poolroom bill, now before the
House Judiciary Committee and which is
directed against the poolrooms in Louis
ville, Lexington and Covington, will nave
at least two strong opponents on the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee, if not three, and
it is thought that it will affect the har
mony of the committee on the repeal bill.
Senator Goebel is said to be in favor of the
anti-poolroom bill, while at least two of
his associates on the committeeâ Senator
Weissinsrer of Louisville and Senator
Bronston of Lexington â are strongly
against it How far this difference will
affect their position with regard to the
Southern Pacific bill remains to be seen.
The other members of the committee â
George S. Fulton of Bardstown, Nelson
County ; John Bennett.of Richmond, Mad
ison County, and John I. Landea of Hop
kinsville, Christian County â represent
large horse-breeding interests, but -whether
any of them will resent Senator Goebel's
advocacy of the anti-poolroom bill far
enough to cause them to vote against his
charter repeal bill cannot be said as the
members of the committee are not given
to talking much as to what they will do.
Their difference on this should cut no
more figure in the agreement of the com
mittee than their difference as to choice
for Senator.
Goebel was for ex-Governor Brown and
is now for Blackburn. Messenger was for
McCreajy and i* now for Curlisle. Fulton
Sims and Bronston are for Blackburn,
while L&ndes and Bennet are for Dr. Hun
ter-, the nominee of the Republican caucus.
Huntingdon's workers, however, see all
these points and they are making all the
use of them possible.
While it was rumored Saturday that' W.
C. P. Breckinridge, ex-Congressman from
the Ashland district, would be here this
week to take the lead in the fight against
the repeal, no authority can be found for
the statement and it is hardly probable
that the Huntington management would
select him for such work when there are
other men to be had equally capable and
popular, and who are not weighted down
with the odor of a scandal. There is uo
telling, however, and it is well known that
BrecKinridge stands very close to General
Echols, who represents Huntington's in
terests in Kentucky. Breckinridge's
cousin, General John B. Castleman, is the
chairman of the Democratic committee of
Louisville and Jefferson County, was lately
adjutant-general of the State and is a
strong personal friend of General Echols.
There was aiso a report current that the
Louisville Senators would oppose the
measure. This may be true in regard to
Senator Weissinger, but is not in regard to
Senator Stege. Mr. Weissinger is not in
clined to talk, as he is a member of the
Judiciary Committee. Left to his own un
biased judgment he would in all proba
bility vote for the bill, but with the social
and business connections that he has with
those opposed to the measure he may vote
the other way. He is a man some 47
years of age and of the highest profes
sional and social standing.
Senator Stege, his associate from Louis
ville, can be counted on to oppose the bill.
Stege is one of the newly elected Senators.
He is a self-made man and was for years
in the wholesale grocery business, but
now gives all his business attention to the
Crystal Springs Distillery at Louisville.
He is a lifelong Republican and has repre
sented the Sixth Ward in Louisville in the
â¢Commoa Councill several terms. He has
a clean record and is only in politics at
the urgency of his constituents.
Senator Charies H. Hayes, a "hold
over," who represents Jefferson Conn ty,
can be counted against the bill. He Jives
out on Huntington's road about eight
miles from Louisville. He was for a num
ber of years a director in the Southern
Pullman Palace Car Company, and tttjl
has some connection with the Louisville
office. He is said to hold passes over the
principal railroads in the United States
and can get others when needed. Senator
Hayes has been connected with the organ
ization of several of the roads now a part
of Huntington's Kentucky system, and
was at one time a man of considerable
wealth, though not so rated now- His in
fluence in the Legislature is very great, es
pecially with the Democratic members.
ESfJA.fJE OF A LEOPARD.
It Seriously Wounded John Robinson's
Son and Was Killed.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 3.â A fierce
leopard belonging to Robinson's circus, in
winter quarters a few miles east of the
city, escaped from his cage yesterday to a
hedge near by. The keeper and others
tried to scare it back to the quarters by
firing blank cartridges at it.
John G. Robinson, son of Manager John
F. Robinson, fired a round when within
twenty-five feet of the animal. This so
enraged the brute tbat it leaped upon
Robinson and almost killed him. Its long
claws lacerated his head and body and it
sank its teeth into his acalp. The animal
was finally beaten off and killed with a
load of buckshot. It was valued at $2000.
Young Robinson's condition is serious.

THANKFUL FOR PAST FAVOBS.
Determined Not to Permit His Name to

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Feb. 3.-At an
early hour to-night, John K. Gowdy, chair
man of the Republican State Central Com
mittee, called by invitation at the resi
dence of General Harrison, when the ex-
President handed him the following letter:
lion. John K. Goxcdy, Indianapolis, Ind.: In
view of the resolutions passed by the State Cen
tral Committee at its recent meeting, and of the
fact that delegates to the National Republican
Convention are soon to be chosen in this State,
I have concluded that some statement from me
as to my wishes and purposes should now be
made to my Indiana friends. Hitherto I have
declined to speak to the public upon this mat
ter, but scores of friends to whom I have talked
and ; ,many. scores more to whom I have writ
ten, will recognize in this expression the sub
stance of ,' what I have said 16 them. To
every one who has -proposed to promote my
nomination I have said o." There never
has been an hour since I left the White House
that I have felt a wish to return to it. My In
diana â  friends have been most devoted and
faithful and "I am their grateful debtor. The
Republican party has twice in National con
vention given me its iadorscment and that U
enough. I think the voters of our party are
now entitled to ; have a new name. For the
sentiment, great or small, that has been mani
fested for my nomination, I am grateful, and
of that wider respect and kindnessâ breaking
party linesâ which have been shown me in so
many ways, 1 am profoundly appreciative.
I carinot consent that my name be presented
to or used in the St. Louis convention, and
must kindly ask my friends to accept this as a
sincere and final expression on the subject. Â
. â¢ . Â Benjamin Haerison.
Indianapolis, Feb. 3. ."â¢ . . . \
The politicians close; to General Harri
son have feared he would flatly refuse the
use of his name if crowded too closely upon
the subject, and they regard the "resolu
tions of loyalty," adopted by the State
Committee last week, as the prime cause
of the letter.' "Even'in spite of these reso
lutions they had continued *to hope : that
he would say nothing and quietly permit
the use of his name. Nobody here ques
tions the entire sincerity of the letter and
they regard Harrison as : definitely out of
the race. In this "situation there is little
question that the Indiana delegation will .
be largely, if not soiidly, for McKinley. It
is the opinion that : Reed alienated what
friends he had in the State by flatly refus
ing to make any speeches here during the
campaign of 'I8y4; McKinley has spoken
thrbugn the State'so often that he is
Known to thousands, and there is very
strong sentiment ,in his behalf, ,particu
larly throughout the "gas belt.
Wnen General John C. Xew was seen
this evening relative to the letter of Gen
eral Harrison, he said the letter meant
what it said.
"It takes General Harrison entirely out
of consideration as a candidate before the
St. Louis convention, 1 ' he said. "General
Harrison is not accustomed to fight behind
disguises and it would be unjust to General
Harrison to suspect there is offered any op
portunity for reading between the lines.
The letter says what he has said tome and
others of his friends for a year past. We
had hoped he might be induced to change
his mind, but he had evidently made it
up and his declaration should be regarded
as final."
"Do you think General Harrison will
take any hand in the selection of a candi
date?"
"I don't think be will turn his hand over
to forward the chances of any man. The
.Republicans of the State, so far as he is
concerned, will be perfectly free to exer
cise their own wishes in the matter, but he
will not try to influence the vote of any
delegate."
"For whom will the vote of the Indiana
delegation probably be cast?"
"I think that in the great manufactur
ing districts of the State the sentiment
will be for McKinley. In some parts of
Indiana Senator Allison has a following
that will probably get him some delegates.
I don't think that Speaker Reed will de
velop much strength."
"Will General Harrison be a quantity in
the Senatorial race to succeed Voorhees?"
"I don't have any Idea that he will. In
this, however, I am only speaking for my
self. General Harrison desires to get
away from official life and public notice.
He wants to become a private citizen
again in truth am? in fact."
Hon. G. \V. Fairbanks said: "I regret it
very much. The country would have been
very much better off with Mr. Harrison
nominated and elected. With Harrison
out of the race, it is impossible at this
time to predict what the delegation at St.
Louis is likely to do."
Hon. E. H. Nebeker said: "It does not
surprise me. It is difficult to tell whom
the Indiana delegation is likely to favor at
St. Louis. It is just as likely aa not to
scatter."
John K. Gowdy, chairman of the Re
publican State Committee, said: "I am
sorry to learn it. As far as I know the
State will be almost evenly divided be
tween Allison, Reed and McKinley. All
three have strong friends in different parts
of the State."
CLEVELAM* *OT FAVORED.
Morrison the Choice of the Democrat* of
Illinois.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 3.â The â¢xocutiv*
committee of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee held a meeting to-day at
ftie Sherman House, the occasion beina2
taken advantage of by many prominent
party leaders from city and country to
meet informally and exchange views and
experiences of a political character. Pot
ter Palmer was unanimously indorsed for
the German mission and the President was
requested to make the appointment.
Peoria and Springfield are contestants
for the State convention, with a predom
inating sentiment in favor of the whisky
city. The general sentiment of the com
mitteemen was in favor of a late State
convention, which would, mean early in
June, in opposition to the April conven
tion of the Republicans. The wishes of
Governor Altgeld will be carried out in
this respect, as he will again be the stand
ard-bearer of the Democracy of Illinois.
The members of the executive commit
tee talked freely on the Presidential nom
ination question, with particular refer
ence to Cleveland and Morrison. A ma
jority of the committee were vigorously
outspoken in their opposition to the Presi
dent being nominated again, basing their
objections mainly on the third term idea.
All the anti-Cleveland committeemen are
Etrong supporters of Morrison. The oppo-
Bition of the State committee to Cleveland
was expected as the logical sequence of
the breach between the Governor of Illinois
and the President.
MSCUSSED McKIXLEY'S CHAXCES.
Meeting of the Ohio Republican Delega-
(ton in Congress.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â A1l the
Republican members of the Ohio delega
tion in Congress, with tht exception of
Senator Sherman and Representatives
Watson, Fenron, Dewitt and Beach, met
to-night in the apartments of Representa
tive Grosvenor to discuss the prospects of
Major McKinley for the nomination of his
party at St. Louis. It was stated after the
meeting that Senator Sherman was not
expected to be present, and of the other
absentees one was sick and three were out
of town. The object of the meeting was
to indorse Major McKinley's candidacy,
but this was not done, and probably will
not be done by the delegation on the
ground that there is no necessity for it,
after McKinley has been approved as a
prospective presidential nominee by the
Ohio Republican State Convention. The
strength of McKinley throughout the
country in comparison with that of the
other party candidates lor the nomination
was discussed, the entire time of the meet
ing being consumed in this exchange of
views. It was decided that weekly meet
ings of the delegation should be held, and
en adjournment was taken until next Mon
day night at the same place.
MARIO2T BUTLER'S ADDRESS.
Desires Aorf/t Carolina's Electoral Totes
for Silver Candidates.
RALEIGH, N. C, Feb. 3.â United
States Senator Marion Butler, who is
State chairman of the Populist party in
North Carolina, sent out an address to
night to the members of the Populist party
in North Carolina and to all others in this
State opposed to a single gold standard
to unite and vote so that the eleven elect
oral votes of North Carolina in the forth
coming elections shall be given to candi
dates favoring the free, coinage of silver.
KEXTUCKI'S DBADJjOCK.
Friends of Blackburn and Hunter Are
Yet Hopeful.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 3.â The Sena
torial deadlock is apparently as far from
a solution as ever. This morning's ballot
developed nothing to vary the monotony
of the situation, but politicians anticipate
lively times before the week is out. Sena
tor Oeilvie (D.), who was ill, has arrived,
and Beckham (D.), who was elected Satur
day in Nelson County to succeed Wilson,
deceased, will come to-morrow. This
makes the Assembly again a tie on joint
ballot, and it is thought the Republicans
will report and act favorably on the con
test of Dunlap and Werner, unseating two
Democrats.
What the Senate would do in case this is
done is not known, but it is certain that
Blackburn's friends are more hopeful, and
openly assert that Hunter is defeated.
They claim the logic of the situation now
means Blackburn or nobody. On the other
hand the Hunter forces show equally as
much confidence in their ability to elect
Hunter before the week is out.
PROHIBITIONISTS XOT USITED.
Women Denounce the Men and Then Try
to Apologize.
DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 3.â A meeting
was held this evening of the Prohibition
Amendment League of lowa at the State
House. There were present a large num
ber of the leading prohibition lights of the
State and about a dozen mernDers of the
Legislature who are leaders in the cause
in that body.
The meeting was made up of about equal
numbers of women and men, and in a very
ehort time the meeting developed into a
fight between the men and the women.
The women denounced the men becaube
Boiue of them, in the Legislature
two years ago, had voted for the mulct
law and now were, declaring their fears
that if prohibition were resubmitted it
would be defeated. Representative Funk
made a speech in which ne resented
the imputations that had been made as to
the motives of the friends of prohibition
in the Legislature and left the meeting,
the ladies trying vainly to apologize. The
other members of the Legislature were
almost asj much offended.
TJie meeting to-night means that there
is no further hope of an organized fight by
the temperance forces of the State against
manufacturing of liquors in the State or
m favor of resubmission. It is the most
notable victory foi the liberals in years.
F&OM THJ2 LIXMs OF THIS A.RMY;
Recommendations to Shut Out Appoint
ment of Civilians.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â Hull of
lowa, chairman of the Committee on MiJ
iiary Affairs, in his report to the House on
the army appropriation bill, makes the
following recommendation to change the
law so as to provide that hereafter ap
pointments to the pay department of the
army shall be made from the line of the
army:
"Your committee recognizes the staff
appointments as the most desirable posi
tions, and thinks the officers of the army
should have reserved the right to receive
the appointments to all vacancies in the
staff. The officers of the army are re
stricted to one line of ambition, and your
committpe believes it unjust to permit an
appointment from civil life to any staff
corps of the army."
if this provision shall be adopted, it will
leave only the Judge Advocate's depart
ment open to appointments from civil life.

AID FOR THE
NAVAL MILITIA
Governor Budd Writes to
Secretary Herbert of
the Navy.
VESSELS ARE NEEDED.
Request Made for the Monitor
Comanche and a Suitable
Steam Launch.
NO BOAT FOE TORPEDO PRACTICE
It Is Also Desired That a Naval Officer
Be Detailed to Instruct the
Reserve.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 3.-Secre
tary Herbert has received the following
letter:
Executive Department, j
. Sacramento, Cal., January 25. j
. To the Honorable Secretary of the Navyâ sir: I
would most respectfully request that the moni
tor Comanche. now at Mare Island, be turned
over, temporarily to the State of California for
the training of her naval militia. If this were
done we could place on board a full corps of
competent engineers and crew of naval
officers, seamen, etc. This vessel could be
returned to Mare Island, in case of neces
sity, in a few hours. It would be kept,
in or about the bay of San Francisco
I would also ask that you order that the steam
launch formerly attached to the United States
ship Mohican be turned over temporarily
to California for the purpose of torpedo prac
tice. We have recently received a torpedo out
fit and should have a launch lor practice in
that arm of the service. I would also ask for
the detail of an officer of the United States
navy for the purpose oJ inspecting and in
structing the Naval Battalion. I understand
that on the Atlantic Coast an officer is detailed
for this purpose, but the great distance at which
this State is situated renders it impracticable for
him to give any assistance to the naval militia
here. In this connection 1 would respectfully
call your attention to two inclosed copies of
letters from Lieutenant-Colonel N. T. James of
my staff who is acting inspector of the naval
militia of this State. I will gay that there is
now organized in this State five divisions of
naval militia numbering on December 31,
1895, 480 officers and men, all well equipped
and ready at a moment's notice to take the
field, but lacking in the matter of suitable ves
sels in which to acquire the drill necessary to
make them successful seamen. Very respect
fully, James H. Budd,
Governor of the State of California.
Lieutenant-Colonel James' letter reads
as follows:
A. W. -Barrett Esq., Adjutant-General of the
State of California, Sacramento: I would re
spectfully request that headquarters make a
requisition upon the United States Navy De
partment for the use of the steam launch for
merly attached to the Mohican for the purpose
of topedo practice with the outfit which has
recently arrived. Without a boat of that de
scription the outfit is practically of little value
for the protection of the harbor, and no oppor
tunity is given the men in that arm of the
service. I would also strongly recommend (if
it meets with the approval of yourself and the
commander-ln-chief) that the Governor ask to
be detailed for duty upon his staff (in the
same manner as Captain Carrington was de
tailed), an officer of the United States navy for
the purpose of inspecting and instructing the
naval battalion and imparting to it the esprit
which can only be obtained by contact with an
officer in active service, who is in full touch
with all modern ideas and improvements.
East of the Rocky Mountains an officer is de
tailed for this purpose with the naval battal
ion, but at this distance from headquarters, it
Is of course impracticable lor him to give the
naval battalion of California any assistance or
benefit of his experience. The battalion of.Cal
ifornia being scattered, as it is from the north
ernmost to southernmost part of State, it would
require the entire time and attention of one
officer, and especially when the torpedo branch
is placed in active commission. lam led to
beheve that a requisition upon the Navy
Department from the â¢ commander-in-chief
through Senator Perkins and Representative
Hilborn (both of whom are members of the
Naval committees of Congress), setting forth
the foregoing needs of Rn officer for this pur
pose may be granted and an officer detailed.
In case that this should meet with your ap
proval, I would respectfully suggest the name
of Lieutenant Fechteler (who is at present in
charge of the hydrographlc office In San Fran
cisco) for the reason that this gentlemen is
identified with the interests ot California, De
ing familiar with our coast, our people, and
having married a California lady. From my
acquaintance with him I believe he is the man
for the position, and bis record (as far as I can
learn) conforms wit a this opinion. In case
that this meets with approval I will also ask if
you will kindly notify Die, as there are many
matters pertaining to the battalion which ere
in need of attention, but which would be in
fluenced somewhat by your decision in the
case. Yours very truly, A. T. James,
Lieutenant-Colonel A. D. C. and Inspector.
Representative Hilborn was at the Navy
Department to-day and strongly urged
that these recommendations be carried
out. The Call correspondent understands
that Secretary Herbert will accede to the
requests as made by Governor Budd.
BELKXAV XOT LIAIiLE. i
But He Had No Bi t iht to Usurp the Patent
of Sehild.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.-In the
Supreme Court to-day Justice Gray an
nounced the opinion and judgment of the
court upon the appeal of George F.
Belknap, an officer in the United States
army, from the judgement of the Circuit
Court of the Northern district of Califor
nia in favor of George E. Sehild et al. The
latter were owners of a patent caisson gate
used by Belknap in prosecution of the
Government work without permission of
or compensation for the owners. They
sued for an injunction and accounting.
The court granted the injunction and fixed
damages of $40,000.
Justice Gray stated that the invention
being used by an officer of the United
States for the common defense and gen
eral warfare, an injunction could not lie
against him, neither could damages, the
only damages proved being those in be
half of the United States, for which he
could not be held liable. The judgment of
the lower court must be reversed, with in
structions to dismiss the bill without
prejudice to a suit at law against the
officer for damages or against the United
Stales in d court of claims.
Justices Field and Harlan dissented,
holding that the fact that the defendant
was an officer of the United States gave
him no more right to appropriate a man's
property without his consent than a pri
vate citizen possessed.
PBINCESB KAIULANI NEEDS HELP.
Guardian Varies Says She Should Be
Recompensed.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 3,-Theophilus
H. Davies, guardian of the Princess Kaiu
lani of Hawaii, arrived in this city yester
day on the steamship Umbria. He is on
bis way back to Honolulu, where he was
j British Vice-Consul for thirty years. He
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
Bays that the Hawaiian Government
should take steps at once to indemnify the
young Princess, who has now only a mod
erate income, supplied by her father.
She is now with her father, A. S. Cleg
horn, in the south of France, and Davies
says the Princess has not received a six
pence since Queen Liliuokalani was re
moved from the throne. He says in the
recommendation to the Harrison adminis
tration the Hawaiian M inister urged tnat in
the event of annexation the United States
should pay the Princess $150,000. As an
nexation is no nearer than at the close of
the revolution, the Hawaiian Government,
Davies thinks, should give the Princess
some recognition at once. While in sym
pathy with the deposed Queen and the
Princess, Davies does not think the
dynasty will ever be revived in Hawaii.
PI AMO MANUFACTURERS FAIL
Concerns of Which William Â£. Wheeloek
Was at the Head Are Forced
to the Wall.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 3.-William E.
Wheeloek & Co., piano manufacturers , at
One Hundred and Forty-ninth street and
Third avenue, Mott Haven, and 23 East
Fourteenth street, assigned to-day. They
also have interests in the concerns at
Norfolk, Richmond and Portsmouth, Va.,
Chicago, Denver, Pittsburg and Water
bury, Conn., which were considered as
branches.
Mr. Wheeloek has also been president
of the Weber Piano Company of New
York and vice-president of the Stuyyesant
Piano Company of New York. Business
has been dull for a year past, and a large
part of their capital was tied up in their
diversified interests and in plants. The
immediate cause of the assignment is that
the firm is unable to meet obligations
assumed by the firm for the account of
the Weber Piano Company.
The Stuyvesant Piano Company, 202-206
East One Hundred and Seventh street, ap
plied for a receiver to-day and Robert F.
Tiiney, the treasurer, was suggested by
the officers for temporary receiver. The
company was incorDorateri in April, 1886,
with a capital stock of $40,000. The lia
bilities are $48,000 and the nominai assets
$50,000.
Application was made for a receiver for
the Weber Piano Company to-day. It is
thought the assets are sufficient to meet
the liabilities at a fair valuation. Dull
trade is given as the cause of the failure.
William Foster, the vice-president, was
suggested for receiver. The liabilities are
about $364,000; assets at least $150,000, con
sisting of factory mortgaged for $200,000
and eight lots in Seattle, Wash. William
E. Wheeloek is president.
Justice Lawrence this afternoon ap_
pointed William Foster, one of the peti
tioners ana director?, as temporary re
ceiver of the Weber Piano Company, with
bonds of $50,000, and appointed Robert F.
Tiiney temporary receiver for the Stuy
vesant Piano Company in similar bonds.
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
The Davis Resolution Will Be
Argued Secretly in the
Senate.
Various Reasons for Not Desiring
Heated Sentiments to Be Given
the Public.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â When
the Davis resolution on the Monroe doc
trine reported from the Committee on
Foreign Relations is reached oh the calea
dar or is made the uqtinished business of
the Senate a motion will be made to pro
ceed with the debate behind closed doors.
As such a motion only requires a single
second it is possible for two Senators to
compel such action lo be taken. Many
Senators believe that this is the proper
course with respect to this question and
the statement is made witn positiveness
that at the outset, at least the doors will
be closed to the public and the official re
porters of the Senate debates will be ex
cluded from the chamber so that the words
spoken in debate will not be taken down.
A leading member of the Committee on
Foreign Relations said to-day that no
harm could come from the carefully pre
pared essays on this resolution, but that
harm might grow out of the impromptu
debate that would certainly follow this
question when it came' before the Senate
regularly for consideration. That the res
olution will pass, although it may be mod
ified somewhat, there is no doubt, and
some members of the committee hold that
in the future, when this Government has
occasion to invoke the doctrine as enun
ciated by the Senate, the debate may be
called in to interpret the construction
placed upon the resolution at the time it
was adopted. As the Senate desires the
text of the resolution to speak for itself it
will see to it that the debate does not ap
pear for the future use or misuse of any
Secretary of State or foreign diplomat.
This appears to be the judgment of a ma
jority of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions.
VIEWS OF ARTHUR BALJFOUR.
favors an Alliance Betieeen England
and the United States.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 3.â The Right
Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, First Lord of the
Treasury, delivered a speech at Bristol to
night. He announced that the Govern
ment would introduce a bill in the House
of Commons to increase the ai.d given to
sectarian schools. He made an incidental
allusion to Great Britain's foreign rela
tions and said he felt that England and
the United States should work together
each in its own sphere to promote and
extend the Anglo-Saxon ideas of liberty.
If, he declared, Great Britain was in
alliance with the United States she could
fulfill the duties providence had entrusted
to her aud not fear a foreign foe or inter
national diversions.
HOVSE SILVER REPUBLICANS.
Will Call a Caucus to Consider the Sub-
stitute to the Bond Bill:
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 3.â The sil
ver Republicans in the House are consider
ing the advisability of calling a caucus of
their party associates who favor the Senate
substitute to the bond bill. The purpose
of the caucus, if it be held, will be to se
cure harmonious action in support of the
Senate substitute and to formulate a mode
of procedure with referenco to its consider
ation. The bill will be sent to the Ways
and Means Committee and will probably
be'reported back to-morrow with a motion
that it be not concurred in. The silver
Republicans think that they can muster
thirty votes in its favor, and that the ad
ditional votes from the Democratic side
will increase their vote to about 100.
NATIONAL BANK CUJtJtJS NCT.
A 11 ill to Amend the Existing Law on the
Subject.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb.3.-Hill(R.)
of Connecticut offered in the House to-day
a bill amending the existing law so as to
permit National banks to issue currency to
the par value of bonds deposited. When
currency is issued to the banks the Secre
tary of the Treasury is required to redeem
and cancel a corresponding amount of
legal tenders. Should no legal tenders be
presented for redemption then the Secre
tary is authorized to redeem and cancel
notes issued under tne Sherman act. To
carry out the provisions of this bill the
Secretary is authorized to issue a 3 per
cent gold bond, payable in twenty years,
to be sold as occasion requires.
BAYARD SAYS
HE WILL RESIGN.
That Is in Case of Being
Censured for Those
Speeches.
REGARDED AS A THREAT.
Friends of the Embassador, How
ever, Believe That He Avoids
Embarrassment.
WOBSE THAN HIS ADDRESSES.
Grosvenor of Ohio Classes the Diplo
mat's Move as an Attempt to
Bulldoze Congress.
LONDON, Eng., Feb: 3.â The United
Press learns that Hon. Thomas F. Bayard,
United States Embassador here, has au
thorized President Cleveland to announce
his resignation in the event of a vote ad
verse to 'him upon the House of Represen
tatives resolution censuring him for his
utterances in his speeches in Edinburgh
and elsewhere in Great Britain. .
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 3.-Noth
ing authoritative can be learned here con
cerning Embassador Bayard's seported
conditional tender of his resignation to
President Cleveland, but despite this lack
of information in the matter, there is a be
lief among Government officials corrobo
rative of the news. Friends of the Em
bassador who were seen were inclined to
believe that Mr. Bayard had tendered his
resignation conditionally, mamly to re
lieve the President of any embarrassment
in the affair, and incidentally, perhaps,
through not thoroughly understanding
the resolution of censure was adopted by
the House Committee on Foreign Affairs
by a party vote.
At the Capitol the announcement
created something of a sensation among
the members of the House. By Repub
licans generally it was reearded as a
"threat," and some of those spoken to
were disposed to resent it. Grosvenor of
Ohio, for example, characterized it as "an
attempt to bulldoze Congress." He also
added that he regarded it as "worse than
the sentiments contained in Mr. Bayard's
original speeches." The principal effect
of the announcement, he said, would be to
pass the resolutions by a larger majority
than would otherwise have been the case.
McCreary of Kentucky, chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee dur
ing the past two congresses, and who is
now its ranking Democratic member, de
clined to express an opinion regarding the
dispatch. He stated subsequently that
whatever he had to say regarding the
matter would be contained in his speech
defending Bayard when the resolutions of
censure shall come before the House. He
will assert in this speeclv that the action
of the House is unprecedented and that it
is an invasion of the executive power. He
will also produce data showing that it has
been the habit of American Ministers to
En.lana for fifty years to make public
speeches.
Taft of Ohio, one of the Republican
members of the committee, expressed a
an unwillingness to make public the de
tails of the discussion in the committee
room on Saturday last, but said that the
Republicans would have met the Demo-
.crats more than half-way in the adoption
of a mild resolution of censure.
It is now learned that the proposition
placed before the Democrats by the Repub
licans was the adoption of a resolution
stating in terms that American represen
tatives abroad should not discuss publicly
the affairs of their country. It was in
tended that this admonition should be
general, and that Bayard's name should
not appear in the resolution. The refusal
of the Democrats to agree to this resolu
tion resulted in some of the younger
members of the committee forcing
through the resolutions, the substance of
which has been already made public.
SYMI'ATHY FOR BAYARD.
The Embaaandor Eulogized by Some of
the English rapers.
LONDON, England, leb. 3.â The Daily
News will to-morrow comment upon the
fact that Embassador Bayard has issued
to the press his correspondence with the
Washington Government on the speeches
delivered by him at Edinburgh and Bos
ton, England, which called forth the reso
lution of censure adopted by|the Committee
on .foreign Relations of the House of
Representatives.
The paper says that Mr. Bayard has
shown by his action that he is as much
without fear as his ancient namesake, the
Chevalier Bayard, who was without fear
and without reproach. It adds that many
of those who read the correspondence with
candor will think that he is almost equally
without reproach. It concludes :
"He makes merry at the expense of
Congress". We firmly believe for the sake
of our kindred people that the affair will
amount to nothing. All the same Mr.
Bayard had better not do it again."
In its comment on the subject the Morn
ing Post displays sympath y for Mr. Bay
ard. Itcontends that according to the view
of the Republican majority the busi
ness of the Embassador in Europe is to de
clare that the American people are the
highest product of civilization and tQ dare
anybody else to disprove this opinion ai
their peril. It adds that the affair is ap
parently an illustration of the humors of
the Presidential election.
The Standard will say that there is a
painful want of dignity in the manner in
which Mr. Bayard's official critics dis
played their resentment. The resolution,
the dispatches to the embassy and the
curtness with which Mr. Bayard is taken
to task, exhibit tho harsher side of public
life in America in an unpleasing light.
The paper expresses sympathy with the
Embassador and say it hopes that if he
retires America will share the regret that
this country will feel.
IXCRJEAaEp -â  A V I* H OJPJiI A. TIONSi
The Senate Committee Will Report Two
Important JiiUg.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â The
Senate Committee on Appropriations this
morning ordered the pension and Military
Academy appropriation bills to be reported
to-morrow. The estimates for the pension
bill amounted to $141,384,575 and the
House passed it with an appropriation of
$141,325,820. The Senate committee in
creased it by $52,760, the two items of in
crease betas $50,000 for fees and expenses
of examining surgeons and $2760 for rent
of pension agencies. As it will be re
ported to the Senate the bill will carry
$141,378,580. For the current year $141,381,
--570 was appropriated.
As this bill passed the House it provided
that during the fiscal year 1897 whenever
any claim for a pension under the act of
June 20, 1890, has been or should be re
jected, suspended or dismissed and a new
application shall haro been filed and a
pension shall hereafter be allowed in such
claim, such pension shall date from the
time of the filing of the first application.
The Senate committee struck out the limi
tation confining such action to the fiscal
year 1897 and made the provision general
in its application until the law may be re
pealed.
A. net increase of $2048 has been made in
the bill for the support of the Military
Academy.
DESCENDANTS OF WASHINGTON.
Two Women of Ohio Who Possess Relics
That Belonged to the Father of
His Country.
WASHINGTON, D. G., Feb. 3.âSecre
tary Smith's mail to-day contained a letter
from Virginia S. Washington and Mary L.
Washington of Portsmouth, Ohio, stating
that they had proof that they were de
scendants of General George Washington
and bad in their possession several relics
that belonged to the Father of his Country.
These include a tortoise-sheJl snuff-box
given Thomas Jefferson by Washington
and subsequently returned to the Wash
ington family; a toddy-spoon, Washing
ton's Freemason's apron, Bible, gold
headed cane and cavalry saddle. It is
also asserted that they had a sword and
cane belonging to Washington for whtcfe
Cougress at one time agreed to make a
handsome donation, provided they were
presented to the Nation. These valuable
relics, they say, were intrusted to Con
gressman Summers (presumably of Vir
ginia), who served in the Twenty-seventh
and Twenty-eighth Congress, and who,
they sa.y, presented them to Congress in
his own name.
The heirs assert that they afterward
received a letter of thanks from Congress,
but that the letter was unfortunately lost
by their relative, Samuel T. Washington,
who '"died among strangers in Texas,"

NEW YORKERS PROTEST
They Do Not Desire to Part
With Ballington Booth and
His Energetic Wife.
Resolutions Adopted at a Meeting at
Which Many Distinguished Per
sons Were Present.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 3.-The meet
ing to-night to protest against the re
moval of Commander and Mrs. Ballington
Booth from the leadership of the Salva
tion Army in this country, rilled the main
floor of Carnegie Music Hall comfortably
full of the friends of the deposed leaders.
Chauncey M. Depew presided, and minis
ters of almost every denomination were
present.
Mayor Strong sat at the right of the
chairman and made an . address, as did
also Bishop Andrews, Key. Dr. Strong,
William E. Dodge and Rev. Dr. Bradford.
Mr. Depew opened his address by reading
a telegram from Bramwell Booth, chief of
staff, to the effect that General Booth was
now in India, but that the recalling of his
son was intended as no discourtesy. With
this little prelude the speaker went on to
say that that was all very well, but that
New Yorkers had a way of doing things
and saying things without much re
gard as to what London thought
about it. This was not done,
he said, in any bragging spirit,
but in the interest of letting the kindred
across the sea know that the infant hero
hat" views of its own. Mr. Depew then
eulogized the great work of Commander
Booth and his followers in the army, and
explained in his felicitous way just why
there was such objection to the removal of
Commander and Mrs. Booth. He had hig
audience wfth him, and every mention of
the two names around which his remarks
were woven brought out storms of ap
plause. Other speakers followed in a sim
ilar vein.
Resolutions were then introduced and
adopted urging, if consistent with the best
interests of the whole world, "that Com
mander and Mrs. Booth be allowed to re
main in the positions in which they have
been so abundantly blessed by God; in
which they have won the honor, gratitude
and love of the American people and have
led on with inspiring zeal all the members
of the army in their rescue work."
TO GIVE UP THE STOCK
Rather Pointed Request Made at
the Meeting of the Rich
Portland Company,
Claims of an Illegal Transfer Made
After New Officers Had Been
Elected.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, Feb. 3.â The
annual meetinc of the Portland Gold Min
ing Company of Victor, Colo., was held in
this city to-day. General Manager J. F.
Burns' report showed the net earnings of
the company to be $1,014,745 72. The fol
lowing officers were elected: J. F. Burns,
president; John Harnan, vice-president;
James Doyle, secretary; J. F. Burns, treas
urer and general manager; Frank G. Peck,
assistant secretary. All the officers are
directors. W. S. Stratton was also chosen
a director.
Attorney Daniel Prescott of Denver
presented a request to the stockholders on
behalf of A. J. Mackey, owner of 100,000
shares, to compel the directors to restore
to the company 704,000 shares of treasury
stock alleged to have been illegally trans
ferred to them. The price paid by the
directors is said to have been 12% cents.
This transfer was made in the latter part
of 1894, when the market value of the
stock was greatly in advance of this price.
The stock thus taken by the directors is
now worth $1,5Q0,0Q0. Action on the re
quest was deferred for a month. If the
directors do not accede to the demand
made upon them expensive litigation will
follow.

ROUTINE WORK
OF THE HOUSE
The District of Columbia
Appropriation Bill
Discussed.
AMENDMENTS ADOPTED.
Right of Way Through the
Choctaw Nation Granted
to a Railroad.
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
An Appropriation Asked for the Fam.
ilies of Italians Killed in
Colorado.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â The
House spent nearly the entire session in
committee of the whole to-day, discussing
three amendments to the District of Co
lumbia appropriation bill. Two of these
amendments were agreed to, and the third
was pending when the committee rose.
The army appropriation bill for the
coming fiscal year was reported.
A bill was passed granting a right of way
through the Choctaw Nation to the Ar
kansas and Choctaw Railroad Company.
The Senate free-coinage substitute for
the House bond bill was received and re
ferred under the rules to the Committee
on Ways and Means.
A message from the President asking a
reasonable appropriation for the families
of the four Italians killed last spring in
Colorado was referred to the Committee
on Appropriations.
The correspondence which accompanies
the message consists of letters exchanged
between Baron Fava and the Department
of State and Governor Mclntyre of Colo
rado. Baron Fava, March 13, 1895, the day
following the lynching, called it to the at
tention of the State Department on the
basis of newspaper accounts.
Immediate action was taken by Acting
Secretary Ãbl to ascertain the facts in the
matter. This was so satisfactory to Baron
Fava that he repeatedly expressed his be- j
lief that the Federal Governmant would
not hesitate to do all that could be done to
bring the guilty parties to justice. Under
instruction from Baron Fava, the Italian
Consul never made an investigation of the
circumstances attending the lynching and
also the political status of the victims.
Without finishing the consideration of
the District of Columbia bill the House at
4:50 P. m. adjourned until to-morrow.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.âRepre
sentative Grove L. Johnson appeared be
fore the House Committee on Immigra
tion and Naturalization to-day and in the
course of his lone argument declared that
the influx of the lower classes of Europe
and Asia was responsible for most, if not
all, of our labor troubles. He urged the
passage of a bill absolutely prohibiting
immipration of all laborers into this coun
try. It was manifested in the committee
that several members were disposed to
disapprove the adoption of so radical a
measure.
Bills were introduced to-day as follows:
By Barharnâ To establish a lighthouse
and fog signal at Point Gorda, Hum

By Hilbornâ For relief of settlers on the

When a man knows anything that is for the
general benefit of his race it is strange that he
does not see -how absolutely unfair it is to keep
EXPERIENCE,. which cannot be bought with
money, to himself to the exclusion of all others.
And yet the men who do this continually are
to be counted by the thousands.. A conspicu-

infinitely more public-spirited â  and of those
who abhor anything like injustice; is Mr. S.J.
Baily, the well-known ' and , highly respected
thinker, "whose home is now in Marysville.
Like most men occasionally subject to nervous
strain, Mr. Bailey became once the viotim of an .
Insidious disease, which s vr as : gnawing at his
very heart's strings, and he was at a loss as to
what it was best to do. That he did'the very
best thing possible is now not a matter of doubt,
for he applied to the managers of the great
medical institution which is located in the big
white building at the junction of Market, Ellis
and Stockton streets, and of what was done for
x him by the specialists of that grand establish-
ment he speaks in plain terms. And he tells of
what he knows well. Read his letter; it is
right straight to the point: '

Great Devastation Among the
Armenian Residents of Large
Districts. â¢
SOME RETALIATORY TORTURES.
Moslems Said to Have Been Murdered
and Mutilated After the Attack
on Zeitoun.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 3.â The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a letter from
Urfa, iii which the vrriter estimates that
the victims of the massacre that occurred
there on December 28 numbered 3500.
The correspondent of the Times at Con
stantinople telegraphed that Sir Philip
Currie, the British Embansador, has re
ceived a dispatch from Consul Barbam
fully confirming the Turkish official report
of the barbarity displayed by the Ar
menians at Zeitoun towara their Moham
medan captives. The dispatch says that
â¢slems were tortured, murdered and
mutilated.
The correspondent furtuer says that the
speech delivered Friday night by Lord
Salisbury to the Nonconformist Union at
London, in which he declared that Great
Britain was powerless to do more than she
had already done for the benefit of the
Armenians has greatly pleased the Sultan,
who has ordered Costaki Pasha, Turkish
Embaspador in London, to express his ac
knowledgments.
The following is a translation of a letter
received at Constantinople from a trust
worthy source in Caesarea and handed to
the United Press correspondent at Con
stantinople:
CAEbAREA, Jan. I.â ln the district be
tween Guerun and Chelerig twenty-seven
Armenian villages have been pillaged and
burned. Thirteen villages, five or six
hour* from Ghemesek, have likewise been
pillaged and ruiufd. Raiders carried the
plunder from Denteil for three days con
tinuously. No clothes or bedding or
kitchen utensils and nothing to eat were
left the surviving villagers. In the district
of Tonnog three Armenian villages were
pillaged and burned, many of the inhal
ant* butchered and young women ravished.
Otner villages were entirely ruined. No
place inhabited by Armenians escaped,
except Tals and Ghemenek. In the latter
place the Turks joined the Armenians in
driving back the rai iers.

WASHINGTON," D. C, Feb. 1 3.â ln a
special message s<?nt to the Senate Decem
ber 19 last in response to a resolution of
that body, President Cleveland inclosed a
communication, from Secretary of State
Olney statinp that the aggregate loss at
H:. p<Â«ot in the burning of the American
Theological School and missionary resi

hood ol $100,000." â¢ . '
Is way further s-tateil in t!ie same com
munication that "the United States Minis
ter has notified the Porte that the Turkish
Government will be held responsible for
the immediate and full satisfaction of all
injuries on that score."
This demand, was of course, made some
days before the sending of the communi
cation to Congress, but the news has ap
parently only just reached the cable artist
of the Chicago Associated Press, who an
nounces it this morning under a Constanti-
nople date line. The President's message
of December 19 last also refers to damages
done the American missionary school of
science at Marash, but he said that the
value of the property in this case had not
been ascertained, adding that "after
prompt investigation the Minister will
make a like demand for an adequate in
demnity."
All of the facts were laid before the pub
lic by The United Press December 20, 1895.

at Barberton Inn.
Interesting Incidents of a Wedding In

Barberton Inn. Barberton, Ohio, at Ã o'clock
this evenine by Archdeacon William W.
Brown of the Cleveland Protestant Episco
pal Church.
Not more than half a dozen guests at
the ceremony were aware of the fact that
they were not witnessing an actual mar
ri:t?e. When O. C. Barber attempted to
Bccnra a license here last Thursday he
could not swear that ins daughter was a
resident of Ohio, he having removed to
Chicago five years ago because of tax laws.
Dr. Bevan accordingly secured one in Chi
but the laws of Illinois stipulate that
the marriage is not legal unless solemnized
in that State.
Miss Barber accordingly left Barberton
Thursday night and was wedded to Dr.
Deyan in his rooms at the Lakota Hotel,
Chicago, returning to Barberton Saturday
morning.
BARBERTON, Ohio, Feb. 3.â Mrs.
George Kewberry, mother of Dr. Arthur
Dean Bevan, who was married to Miss

FORT SMITH, Ark., Feb. 3.-Judge
Parker, in his charge to the jurors in em

the United States Court this mornifur,
quoted statistics showing that the average
nnmber murdered in the United States in
the last rive years was ereater than the en
tire Continental army to w.hich Washing
ton bid farewell. The last year the num
ber murdered, he said was in excess of the
standing army at the beginning of the
Civil War.
For these murders one oat of sixty were
legally punished, and one out of forty
lynched. He was particularly severe upon
the appeal courts, and charged them with
hairs and siding; with design
ing, unscrupulous lawyers, for the defeat
of justice."
He read from an address by Justice
Brewer on the abuse of the appellate sys
tem. He referred to Brewer as "a great
commoner, who has not lost his touch
with the people on account of his positton
on the Supreme bench."
"The mails are making a school house

which are educating the people," said the

CAN SAVE THE ST. PAUL
Successful Attempts Being Made
to Move the Stranded
Steamer.
After Persistent Efforts the Tugs Are
Making Headway in Hauling
Her Off.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Feb. 3.-The
big steamer St. Paul was moved about 125
Jeet to-day, and hopes are high that she
will float before sunrise. The wreckers went
to work early this morning, being aided
materially by the high tide and a north
east wind. The tugs bcean hauling on the
big ship as early as 10 o'clock. She rocked
in her cradle in the sand, and this gave
the wreckers an advantage that they had
not yet had in their work.
When all preparations had been made
the iugs out from the stern of the St. Paul
began to haul on the big hawsers, and
soon the vessel was seen to move. She
moved slowly, but enough to encourage
tuose at wort. The weather conditions
ttiis morning were more favorable for get
ting the St. Paul off than they had been
at any time since the big ship ran aground.
The wind at 10 o'clock blew at the rate of
about twenty-six miles an hour.
At noon the wreckers c ased hauling on
the stranded steamer. When work was
stopped they had moved her fully twenty
five feet, and the officials and wreckers
were jubilant.
NoattemMtn work oil the steamer wp.s
made ihis afternoon because of the low
tide, but operations were resumed about 10
o'clock to-night. At midnight the snip'B
officer-, reported over the telephone that
the four tugs at work had succeeded in
moving the ship about 150 feet in a north
easterly direction.
At 1:30 o'clock this (Tuesday) morning
the tide commenced falling, but work was
not relaxed. The waves beat atrainst the
broad side of the steamer with great force,
but it is not thought that she has sustained
any damage.
Notwithstanding the heavy storm to
nigh, hundreds of people braved the ele
ments and stood on Ocean avenue watch
ing the boat move.
At midnight it was stated that if the
steamer is not floated to-night she will go
out with the next Hoodtide, which occurs
about noon Tuesday.

Sausalito. â¢
ASTORIA, Or., Feb. 3.â The steamship
Columbia had a very narrow escape from
serious disaster this morning as it. was
bound out over the bar for San Francisco.
There were 185 passengers aboard and a
full freight cargo when Captain Bolles at
tempted to take the Columbia out when it
was withintwo inches of low water.
The bar was rough, but with the pas
sengers all locked in the cabin the steam
ship drove inte the breakers.
Captain Bolles was on the bridge, and
the spray dashed over him as he directed
the course of the steamship.
When the bar had been nearly crossed,
an immense sea raised the Columbia high,
and as it dropped the vessel's stern struck
bottom. Shortly afterward the steering
gear became unmanageable, and as soon as
the steamer got into smooth water outside
where there was good anchorage, the
anchors were let go.
The Columbia began sounding its
whistle and showing signals of distres3,
which, were seen and h<ard at the Fort
Stevens Life-saving Station, about three
msles away. Word was sent to this city,
and the tugs Relief and Escort were at the
vessel's side within an hour, The light
house tenders Columbine and Manzanita
also hurried to its assistance.
The Columbia was found to be in no
danaer, but helpless, its rudder-stock hav
ing been bent and choked. A few hours
later the Relief took it in tow, with the
Escort taking a line from the stern to keep
the vessel in position. The Columbia was
brought back to this city and made fast at
its dock.-
During the entire time there was little
or no excitement among the passengers,
and the officers and crew showed perfect
discipline.
Captain Bolles this evening stated to a
representative that although the Columbia
did strike lightly once it did noi cause the
accident, but that it was the result of a
cross sea striking the rudder and twisting
the stock.
To-morrow morning the Columbia will
be towed to Portland, where it will be re
paired sufficiently to enable it to De taken
to San Francisco.
The Columbia's passengers will be given
the choice ofsailing upon the next steamer
for San Francisco, or receiving back their
fare money. The Queen, one of the best
equipped steamers on the Pacific Coast,
and which is no\y lying at Sausalito, Cal.,
will at once come to Astoria to replace the
disabled steamer.
SAN BEItXAItniXO QUAIIREL.
Conip l {cations Arising From the Borti
eulturnl Cotntnls\ion Contest.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 3.â lf
the Horticultural Commission matters
were mixed before, it is hard to get the
status of affairs now. The question now
agitating the Supervisors is: Where will
it end? This was the day for auditing
bills, and before the Supervisors were the
claims of old and new commissioners and
inspectors. The District Attorney says
emphatically that he will not approve any
of the bills, so the Supervisors are in a
quandary as to whether they can legally
issue warrants or not County Auditor
piss says he will refuse to draw' warrants
if issued by the board.
What farther troubles the Supervisors is
that the District Attorney told them that
they could be forced to appoint successors
to Messrs. Muscott and Pierson. Matters
are further complicated by the Southern
Pacific agent of Redlands coming before
the board and stating that he had a sup
ply of trees on hand. One commissioner
ordered him to deliver them, while the
others told him to destroy them, and be
hind all are the consignees,- threatening a
damage suit if something is not' done at
once. The board aoes not know how to
act to get out of the muddle.

Supervisors Itetnand County Treasurer
Montgomery' s Resignation.
HOLLISTER, Cal., Feb. 2.â The Board
of Supervisors today directed the County
Clerk to demand the resignation of County
Treasurer Montgomery. In June, 1895,
a deficiency in the accounts was made up
by Montgomery's relative, and he was
continued in office by his bondsmen. A
recent Grand Jury was not informed of
the matter and adjourned without action.
Another Grand Jury has been called for
next Monday, when an expert will be em

1880.
Montgomery prefers to make a statement
and hand his resignation to the Grand
Jury, and upon advice of his attorneys will
not obey the Supervisors.

PINE VALLEY'S TRIPLE CRIME.
Ketsay Porter on Trial at Union for Mur

Mache Family.
UNION, Or., Feb. 3.â The trial of Kel
say Porter, charged with the murder of
three members of the Mache family in
Pine Valley on New Year's day, was begun
to-day. According to the evidence
gathered by the Deputy District Attorney,
who is to prosecute the case, it appears
that Porter expected the coming of the
Maches by a road passing near a shed.
Armed with a Winchester rifle with maga
zine loaded full, he eot on the sht i and
awaited their approach. When near b>
he opened fare on young Mache, who w.is
riding"a horse, a bullet, hitting him and
causing him to fall from his horse, dead, a
short distance away.
Porter then followed the old people, who
were in a sleigh, and shot at them, firing
sixteen shots at the mother and son pre
vious to killing the father. The post
mortem on the body of the elder Mache
showed that his skull was fractured, and
it is believed that, after tiring all the shells
in the magazine, Porter struck him with
the rifle, and then reloaded it and fired
two or three shots into his body.
Porter continues to keep silent, so far as
making any statement for the benefit of
the public is concerned. '

BASEBALL AT STANFORD.
Candidates for Diamond Favors
Appear for Their First â 
Practice.
Track Athletes Desire to Save Berke
ley the Necessity of Going East
for a Match.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
3.â The baseball men were to-day at work
for the first time this season. So far the
rain has kept the iield in such bad shape
that a regular practice was impossible, but
the past few days of warm weather put
the diamond into fine condition, and at
Captain McLaine's call to-day a large
number of candidates appeared for honors.
There will be plenty of seekers for all
vacant places, but it will require a long,
severe course of training to put this raw
material into the proper shape for a good
team.
Manager Watson says that every effort
will be bent to administering another de
feat to Berkeley tins season, but lie freely
asserts that a baseball year never opened
les3 auspiciously for Stanford. Six of last
year's men have left the university, and
all their places will have to be filled. The
management expects to see one thing,
however, as the reazilt of tins fact â it an
ticipates a hot figijt for ail places, and, as
competition makes good players, Stanford
may. yet put a good team of ball-tossers
against Berkeley.
Trackmen to-day began actual work for
the first time this year in pursuance to
! Captain Toombs' directions issued to the
i men at the meeting last Saturday. Toombs
1 s?ys that nothing but hard work and lots
lofit by all the atf Jetesâ old and newâ can
I give Stanford a victory this year, or can
; even give U. C. a gooa shake-up. About
thirty-live or forty men are eager to do
i their best, and if "nothing but the unex
pected happens Berkeley will fin-J foemeu
worthy of her steel without going East
for them.
'Students' are on the gui vive over the
belief that.a decision in the Stanford case
may be handed down within a day or two
by the Supreme Court Should a favora
bJe decision be rendered there will be a
thanksgiving celebration by the entire

BUTTE CITY ADVENTURE
Stage-Driver Grigsby and a Pas
senger Narrowly Escape
Drowning.
Attempt to Ford a Swollen Stream and
Are Carried Down by the
Current.
CHICO, Cal., Feb.. 3.â Morris Miller, a
prominent merchant of Butte City, and
Samuel Grigsby, a stage-driver, hart a
thrilling experience Saturday as the re r u!t
of attempting to ford a swollen stream be
tween Chico and Butte '"'ity, and toey are
now felicitating themselves upon being yet
in the land of the living.
Morris was a passenger on Grigsby's
stage to Butte City. The recent rains
have caused the creeks in this vicinity to
run bank full, and when the stage arrived
atone of these swollen streams the bridge
was found to be entirely submerged.
Grigsby. trusting to his fcnowledee of the
road, believed he could drive. on to the sub
merged structure without difficulty, and
plunged his horses into the water. Tue
horses splashed along for a few yards, and
then, reaching the natural bank ot the
creek, suddenly disappeared under water.
They had missed the bridge.
The/animals immediately arose to the
surface and struck out for tbe shore. The
current was so strong that horses and
stage were carried down stream, and
despite its struggles the team could
not reach the bank. The horses were be
coming exhausted, and there was danger
of their giving out and sinking, in which
event tueir weight would have dragged
the coach to the bottom. The driver re
tained his presence ot mind and with taut
reins kept the horses' heads above water,
while he urged them on with shouts.
Finally a bend in the river appeared and
the current swung the stage toward the
opposite bank. The horses gained a foot
hold and dragged tue coach to dry land.
Miller and Grigsby cume through the ad
venture unharmed, though both received
a wetting and the merchant an excusable
fright.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 3.â The fol
lowing letter has been mailed to Senator
Stephen M. White by Adjutant-General
Barrett in regard to the National Guard of
California:
My Dear Sir: As the National Guard, in many
instances, throughout the United States are
not equipped and armed us should be done
by the. United states Government, I would
earnestly request that you use yonr influence
in getting 1 arger and more appropriate allot
ments from the Government than haa hereto
fore been the custom, as it is absolutely neces
sary that our guard be placed on a par with
any nation in the world iv regard to modern
arms and equipments. Even the little
Dominion of Canada equips its militia better,
ana has of a recent date ordered 40,000 of the
most modern improved rifles to equip its
militia with.
'iiie United States certainly cannot overesti
mate the necessity of at once placing our 115,
--000 National Guardsmen in the United States
in as good a condition as the regular army.
The National Guard Association of the United
States has a committee at Washington, D. C,
comprising General AlDert Ordway and Gen
eral Samuel Daltoii, who are working for the
interest of the Natioual Guard throughout the
United States, and 1 hope you will be able to
assist them in their undertaking. Geueral
Dole, the Assistant Secretary of War, is also
very enthusiastic in these matters.
Trusting that I am not encroaching too much
upon your valuable time I am very respect
fully, A. \V. Barrett, Adjutant-General.

FIGHTING SANTA CRUZANS
Editor Francis Arraigned for
Striking Editor Braun
With a Cane.
The Pumineled Man and a Friend Tell
the Story of the Attack and
Defense.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 3.-The pre
liminary examination of Philip Francis,
editor of the Penny Press, for assault with
a deadly weapon upon Ed Braun of the
Record, was begun this afternoon before
Justice of the Peace Gardner. The evi
dence of the prosecution was adduced,
and the defendant's motion for a dis
missal denied. The defense will put in its
evidence to-morrow.
The prosecution to-day presented only
lour witnesses, out' of the twenty-five or
thirty who saw the trouble.
Braun testified that he was talking to
E. W. Warren, and that his back was
turned toward Francis when the latter
passed and then turned and struck him
with his cane. He was knocked down, he
said, but immediately got up and
"jumped" Francis again. When closely
questioned by District Attorney Lindsay,
he said he did not mean tbat he "jumped
Francis again," but that he meant that he
merely "jumped" him.
W-aTren swore that neither he nor Braun
rushed at Francis before the blow, which
was dealt with the small end of the cane;
but after Braun had fallen he (Warren)
caught the cane and wrested it from Fran
cis, Trending" it in the struggle. He was
unable to identify the cane, saying the one
exhibited was not the one used in the
.fight. The District Attorney contended
that it was the same, and then Warren
admitted it. lie said Francis struck him
a couple of time 3 before he got the cane
away from the Penny Press man. He en
gaged no further in the trouble, he said,
because somebody held him.
Tliese two were the only witnesses who
testified to having seen the beginning of
the fisht, though there are other wit
nesses who did see it, and one who saw all
of it and got mixed up in it. Attorney
Netherton, in his motion for the discharge
of the defendant, asserted that the evi
dence had not shown that the cane was a
deadly weapon under the law.
Tjf.COMA'B MYSTERI.
Offldalt Are Certain That Sir*. Cody of
Chicago Committed Suicide.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 3.â The police
have reached the conclusion that Mrs.
A. B. Cody of Chicago, who disappeared
Friday, has committed suicide.
They have searched for her all day in
vain. To-day her parents discovered a note
which she had left, stating that she in
tended to end her life.
The police also learned to-day that she
bought a revolver Friday afternoon and
that she trembled as she paid for the
weapon and asked to have it loaded.
It is feared she. went to the woods on
the outskirts of the city and there ended
her life. A conductor of a suburban line
says a woman answering her description
rode with him Friday and Saturday. A
large number of men spent the day search
ing the woods for her.

ARGUED AT SAN RAFAEL
The North Pacific Railroad
Injunction Suit Comes
Up in Court.
Lengthy Affidavits Denying Sydney V.
Smith's Right to Voto His
Stock.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Feb. 3.â After a
series of postponements the injunction
suit instituted by Messrs. Foster, Mark
ham and others of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway Company to re
strain Sydney V. Smith of the same com
pany from voting his stock therein except
as a unit with their own, was called here
this morning before Judge Angelotti.
Mr. LihenthaK representing the plain
tiff, occupied the morning by reading a
number of affidavits prepared by his cli
ent, including Messrs. Markham, Newhall,
Fugazi, McDonald, Overton and Wicker
sham. They were practically to the same
effect, their purpose being to reaffirm the
assertion made in the complaint that they
invested their money in the purchase of
stock in the railroad on the express un
derstanding that Mr. Smith's interest
should be pooled with theirs and all the
stock voted as a unit for five years. They
further stated, which Mr. Smith denies,
that he assured them that the agreement
was valid.
Attorrrey Lilienthal argued at length to
prove, first, that the agreement executed
between the parties was valid. Second,
that if it were invalid the defendant,
Smith, was, under the circumstances,
estopped from proving it bo. Third, that
the proposition of the defendant to make
a combination with the narrow-eauge
road, in' which the plaintiff had no inter
est whatsoever, was not one which they
could in law or equity ba expected to
support.
Continuing, Attorney Lilienthal warmly
eulogized the pood management of Presi
dent Foster, who, he declared, had during
the last two years carried the road forward
in an uninterrupted course of- prosperity.
He declared further that he could scarcely
conceive of any ground upon which it
could be proposed to displace him, except
in pursuance of a deliberate plan to sad
dle a prosperous road with one not paying
expenses and generally rotten.
Attorney Lilienthal's argument occupied
the remainder of the afternoon.
GHASTLY FIND AT FRESNO
Boys Stumble on a Coffin Con-
taining a Body Stolen by
Ghouls.
Was That of a Man Who Had Been
Killed by a Southern Pacific
Train.
FRESNO. Cal., Feb. 3.â Boys who were
hunting about two miles south of town
made a ghastly find in a ravine this after
noon. In crossing a slough thick with
weeds they stumbled on a crushed coffin,
containing the body of August Modenbach,
a former butcher of this city.
Modeubach was injured by'a train on the
Southern Pacific r<3ad just north of town
last September and soon afterward died.
He was crossing the track with a four
horse team when the wagon was struck.
After Modenbach 's death, physicians who
conducted the autopsy stated that death
had ensued as a result of a skull fracture
received in the accident. This the com
pany physician disputed hotly. A con
tusion on the skull was sewed up and the
body interred in the town cemetery.
Soon afterward it was discovered" that the
grave had been opened and the body re
. moved. It was not found until to-day.
The deceased seemed to have no friends or
relatives who took any interest in the mat
ter so the affair was dropped and no action
was ever instituted against the road on
account of the man's dea.th.
Coroner Long and others to-day readily
identified the body from the skull incision.
It was, by order of the Coroner, returned
to the cemetery. The theory at first ad
vanced, that medical students had taken
the remains up, seems to be now thorough
ly disproved.
Railroad Fatality at Gazelle.

SAD TRAGEDY
AT BELLEVUE
A Woman Throws Herself
Before a Fast-Moving
Train.
DEATH IN AWFUL FORM,
Locomotive and Cars Pass Over
Her Body Before They Can
Be Checked.
TROUBLE DEPOSED HER REASON.
Believed to Have Been Temporarily
Insane When She Committed
the Suicidal Act.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 3.â Mrs. H. H.
Button threw herself before a swiftly
moving train to-day at 2 o'clock and was
instantly killed. Ttw tragedy occurred at
Bellevue station, three miles south of this
city, on the Donahue road, and it was
clearly a case of determined suicide. The
engineer of the train, John Hyde, saw the
young woman standing near the track as
the train was approaching,. but did not an
ticipate her purpose. She waited until the
ponderous construction engine was almost
abreast of ncr, when the engineer was hor
rified to see her throw herself headlong
across the rails. The train was quickly
brought to a standstill, but not until the
entire train had passed over her body.
The proper officers were notified, and
Officer Yoho removed the mutilated body
from the rails out of the way of passing
trains. The body was horribly mangled,
both lees being cutoff and the head al
most severed.
The unfortunate woman was about 28
years of age. She was married and was
the mother of three children, who are liv
ing near eanta Rosa. Her husband is the
well-known horseman "Doc" Button of
this city. The couple had been living
apart for some time. Mrs. Button lately
applied for a divorce from her husband,
and it is believed that the worry ana trou
ble over this litigation had unbalanced her
mind. It is also said that the unfortunate
woman was subject to epileptic fits, and was
often attacked by spells of dizziness.
A Coroner's jury was empaneled, and
after a short deliberation rendered a ver
dict of "Stiicide while temporarily de
rangred." No blame is attached to the
railroad or its eraployesi

SENSATIONAL SUIT
AT LOS ANGELES
A Daughter of the Late
Allen G. Thurman Is
Defendant.
AFFAIR OF RELATIVES.
She and Her Husband Accused
of Maliciously Causing an
Arrest.
FANNIE HOLLIDAY'S PLAINT.
Wants Heavy Damages for Having
Spent Several Days in a
Prison Cell.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 3.â Attired
in deep mourning, a daughter of the late
Hon. Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Mrs. M.
P. T. Bolliday, and her husband, Edward
T. Holnday, known a? "Bug" Holliday in
baseball and sporting circles, sat side by
side in Judge York's courtroom this morn
ing, as defendants in a $25,000 damage suit
brought against them by Mrs. Fannie L.
Holliday.
The plaintiff is a slender woman, and
did not look with an amiable glance at her
relatives.
The occurrence which led to this suit
took place last August, when the arrest of
the young woman was caused by Mr. aad
Mrs. Edward IJolliday, She claims her
arrest was malicious and not justified by
the facts.
F-or some reason, which wili no doubt
materialize during the trial, the wife and
the distant relative of the same name-were
bad friends, and their feelings culminated
in a series of pyrotechnical word battles
which upset the nerves of toe ex-base
ballist and his wife.
They told the District Attorney that
Mrs. Fannie Holliday had threatened to
burn their furniture and kill tnem.and
upon their representations a complaint
was tiled in Justice Young's court. Mrs.
Fannie L. Holliday was arrested and kept
in jail for eight days, when she obtained
her release from captivity through the
habeas corpus route.
The Hollidays were still afraid that
their relative would shoot, stab or kill
them, and immediately had her arrested
again. The young woman was kept in
custody for three, hours under this com
plaint, when she was released upon
motion of the District Attorney.
In their answer Mr. and Mrs. Holliday
admit the arrest, but claim that they were
justilied in the course they pursued, and
that although Mrs. Fannie Holliday was
released, it was not done until her attor
neys had promised the attorneys on the
other side that she would not attempt to
carry out the threats that she had made.
LOST OFF CAPE FLATTERY
Shipping Men Certain That the
Burning Vessel Sighted Was
the Ninevah.
Believe That the Crew Took to the j
Small Boats and Were Cap
sized in a Storm.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 3.â
The description received to-day of several
unusual features in the rieging of the ves
sel sighted burning off Cape Flattery on
January 28 by the barkentine Modoc
confirms the belief that the unfortunate
craft was the British Dark Ninevah, lum
ber-laden, from Vancouver for Sydney.
No particular effort will be made by the
tugs here to tind the derelict, although if
sighted she will be looked carefully over
with a view to saving anything that has
riot been consumed by the flames.
There are two theories regarding the
total absence of life aboardâ one, that the
crew took to the small boats in the hope of
getting ashore, and the other that they
were taken off on some outward-bound
vesbei. If the first surmise is correct,
there is little doubt but that all found
watery graves, as the storms have been
particularly severe since the middle of
January.

Toboggan Slide and Skating Court Are
Again Thronged by Pleasure-
Seekers.
TRUOKEE, Cal., Feb. 3.â A meeting of
the directors of the Ice Carnival was held
to-day to consider important matters In
connection with the carnival. It was de
cided to lengthen the toboggan chute con
siderably and maks other improvements
which will greatly add to the attractive
ness of the palace.
To-day has been exceedingly cold, the
highest the thermometer registered being
fifteen degrees above zero. To-night is
the coldest since the carnival opened, and
with the mercury several degrees below
zero skating for the balance of the week
will be unexcelled and the ice men, who
have been doubtful as to the outcome of
the winter's crop, are now satisfied that
they will fill their huge storehouses.
When interviewed tonight on the ice
palace and toboggan slide Director-Gen
eral McGlashan said to a Call correspon
dent :
"We have the weather just as we have
wanted it for two weeks, and now we are
in a position to show the people just how
an ice palace should look when in its best
condition. We are all very enthusiastic
over the carnival, and have every reason
to feel proud T)f our efforts.
"I was talking to a gentleman from
Montreal, to-day, and he reluctantly told
me that although he had seen numerous
ice palaces this was most unique and
original method of building one he had
ever seen or heard of, and in his opinion
it was superior in most respects to the
method of building with block ice.
"I tell you," continued Mr, McGlashan,
"we have the chief attraction in California
to-day and the people will soon find that
out."
The interview was interrupted by a party
headed by a Mormon elaerfrora Salt Lake,
who wanted to see the famous rocking
stone. - /
Mirth and cayety reigns in the skating
rink to-night and all sizes and conditions
of people are whirling around the elliptical
court of ice."
Even watching a skater is amusing and
interesting, as one sees the novice sudden
ly having nis feet taken from under him or
else frantically attempting to catch one of
the numerous" posts at the side of the rink.
On the other hand are expert skaters,
gracefully eliding and turning, cutting
figures in the icy floor and fully conscious
of heir importance."
The toboggan slide is the Mecca of a
large following, who never tire of this ex
hilarating 6port and who seem to grow
more enthusiastic each trip. The toboggan
runs fully an eighth of a mile, and people
who live along the slide use this means of
saving the trouble of walking home.
Next Saturday has been set apart as
Knights of Pythias day, and several if not

WAS DISCOVERED BY DOLBEAR.
Professor Roentgen's Wonderful Fents in
Photography Not New by Any
Means.
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 3. â Professor
Roenteen is perhaps the last of the army
of inventive geniuses who find after their
laborious investigations are brought to a
successful conclusion that there "is noth
ing new under the sun."
In conversation with Professor A. E.
Dolbear, the noted physicist of Tufts Col
lege, regarding the recently published ex
periments in photography by means of
light of slow vibration, it was brought out
that as early as May, 1892, Professor Dol-
Dear had performed many photographic
experiments by the aid of the same agent
as used by the German professor, and ob
tained results quite as remarkable. He
went still further and succeeded in photo
graphing through wood an inch in thick
ness by the ether waves set up by the sim
ple sparkling of a static electrical machine.
Professor Dolbear published the theory
on which hia remarkable results were
based in the science department of a lead
ing monthly magazine in April, ISLM,
under the heading "Electricity -and Pho
tography." This article gave proof thnt
Professor Dolbear used exactly the same
process as did Professor lloentgen, and
that the identical results of Professor
Roentgen were proved and given to the
world in May, 1892, by Professor Dolbear,
though first recorded in public print in
April, 1894. Professor Dolbear secured his
results without the aid of a Crook's tube,
simply by the sparking of an ordinary
static electrical machine in the atmos
phere, and in perfect darkness.

MAY BUILD TO BOLINAS BEACH,
A Branch Likely to Be Extended From
the Mountain Heights to
the Ocean.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 3.-After
monthÃ of planning and surveying, work
is to be commenced in earnest upon the
[ Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
t Railroad. The California Construction
Company has secured the cou tract to do
\ the grading, and a large force of men will
be put at work on Wednesday. A great
many laborers are flocking here in the
hope of securing work, but the construc
tion company has already employed the
necessary number of men.
It has been decided to build the power
house on the Cushing tract just above
East land station, and contracts are soon
to be let for the necessary machinery and
electrical appliances for generating power.
At a meeting of the stockholders held on
Saturday, Sidney B. Cushing was elected
president of the road- David McKay, vice
president; Louis L. James, secretary, and
the First National Bank of San Francisco,
treasurer.
Louis R, James, the newly elected sec
retary, said to-day that the graders would
be put at work Wednesday. The location
party has been out a number of days and
is rapidly pushing its part of the work.
It is hoped that the road will be in run
ning order in time for the large summer
travel.
While the projectors of the enterprise
will say little about the extending of the
road to Bolinas it isgenerally believed that
they will do this as soon as the road is in
running order from Mill Valley to the
summit of Tamalpais. The cost of con
structing the road from the top of the
mountain to Bolinas is estimated to be
about $120,000.
Le Roy G. Harvey has for a number of
years been attempting to Interest moneyed
men in the scheme of building a railroad
to Bolinas, and his estimates have reached
past the million mark, while a branch of,
the electric road will cost but little over
$100,000 to construct.
Bolinas has one of the finest beaches on
the coast and is now a town of consider
able size, considering the fact that its only
communication with the outside world is
by stage coach. If the mountain road is
constructed to Bolinas, one of the finest
parts of Marin County will be opened up.
The terminus of the road will be East
land station. The idea of purchasing the
O'Shaughnefsy tract near Eastland sta
tion and building a large depot has been
given up. .

mirer of spry Jimmie, launched out into a
technical disquisition upon the tactics, the
science, the physique and the achieve

"He has all the agility and intelligence
of a lightweight and the force of a heavy

that he fights with his bead, his heart, his

none could be simpler, as everyone knows

constant exercise, plain food and farm in

plenty of simple common-sense.
As a boy ho was a great walker and

sport afforded by that part of Italy, and
practiced there in those times, as it is now,

MOURNED BY CREDITORS.
He Leaves the Country Without

Consignments.
DENOUNCED AS AN IMPOSTOR.
The Firm He Pretended to Represent
Denies That It Had Any Deal
ings With Him.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 3.-P. H. Foster,
who dealt in green and dried fruits under
the firm name of P. H. Foster & Co. in this
city for the past two years, is being anx
iously sought for by a number of creditors.
About ten days ago Fester and his family,
after selling off their household effects,
left the city, and are now supposed to be
in Honolulu.
A year ago Foster had a young man
named Fisher associated with him in the
business, but this past season Foster con
ducted the business himself. He repre
sented himself to be an agent for the
great fruit-buying firm of Delafiejd, Mc-
Govern & Co., of Mew York, Chicago and
San Francisco. He bought largely of
growing crops and as soon as the fruit was
delivered he would make a small payment
on it. It is thought that Foster has
mulcted fruit-groweis to the extent of
several thousand dollars.
In o*ne case Foster bought dried prunes
from E. McKee, a rancher near Santa
Ciara, amounting to $1418, paying $1062
down. He subsequently paid another $100,
but owes $254. As Foster had represented
that he was buying for Delatield, McGov
ern <fe Co., the bill was sent to the firm's
New York headquarters, but was returned
with the statement that the firm had not
authorized Foster to buy fruit. Only on
one occasion did the firm do any business
with Fo3ter, and it now holds a bill against
him.

"NOBODY CAN DENY."
Joseph Howard Tells How a Califor
nian Good Fellow Died in
Poverty.
Jo Howard, the prir.ee of New York
correspondents, nas written a few words
in regard to an old-time Califoroian who
was once rich, but who died poor in New
York 4ast week. Those who have known
San Francisco for a great many years will
recognize the picture.
"It is customary, after a man has made
a good speech, in a public entertainment,
banquet, or whatever," says Mr. Howard,
"for the company to start up with enthu
siastic fervor and more or Jess harmony,
the inspiring refrain, 'For he's.a jolly good
fellow, which nobody can deny, which
nobody can deny, which nobody can
deny.' And nobody does deny it. In
1859 I was traveling in California, and
attended a fancy dress ball given in the
leading theater in San Francisco. Ad
joining the ballroom was a private supper
room, not whore the great multitude ate
and drank, but where some thirty or
possibly ff.ty politicians and leading men
in the theatrical profession, with news
paper men and others were having a
pleasantly exhilarating experience. The
host of the occasion was the manager of i
the theater, and the projector of the ball,
which was a great social success.
"During the banquet the Mayor of the
city proposed the health of the manager,
which was drunk in bumpers and with
wild enthusiasm, for he was really a
most popular as' well as most pros
perous man. He" responded in a few
words, with no special felicity, for that
was not his forte, and at the close of
his talk loud cheers resounded through
the room, winding up with the old
time refrain. 'For he's a jolly good fe'.
low, which nobody can deny.' I was a
stranger in the town, and regarded the
picture through comparatively youthful,
eyes. I remember admiring the hand
some face, the elegant figure, the all
around gracioti3nes3 of the gentleman
thus honored by his friends and asso
ciates, and was not at all surprised
when told that this personal magnet
ism, the cheery charm of manner, added
to marked ability as a business man, all
steered by intelligent industry and earnest
ness of pumose, had made him very rich,
so that he owned two theaters in San
Francisco, one in Sacramento and one in
Marysvill", besides other property in
ranch and mine, warranting his classifica
tion as Al in mercantile books of reference.
"This week charity buried him. It ap
pears that, more or less intoxicated by
success, this favorite of fortune came East
years ago and interested himself in wide
honzoned dramatic enterprises, one of
which wrs the introduction of a fa
mous troupe of celebrated Japanese
acrobats, jugglers and trapezists.
Although easy come had not
been his motto, for he worked very hard
always, easy go became his financial habit,
for hie gave away large sums of money to
his friends, loaned much to comparative
strangers, and woke some fifteen years
ago to a vivid appreciation of a sad
reality. His friend, Mr. Cash, had gone,
and his other friends followed the
example. Without tracing with unneces
sary detail the good fellows down
ward path. Jet me say that no face has
been sadder, no form more familiar
among the great crowd of expectants
and hopers against hope on Broadway
for the past ten years! than his. Men who
knew him when He held property worth
$1,000,000. men who knew him when liter
ally he rode on the very crest of the wave
of prosperity, men v;ho enjoyed his hos
pitalities on the golden shores of the
great Pacific, and others bound to him by
no tie save that of good fellowship, helped
him now and then, but such help affords
about as much genuine relief as a few
drops of rain falling upon the parched
tongue of one dying of thirst could
give. The man was naturally proud,
sensitive, Kindly hearted, as his jopen
nanded generosity to people in trou
ble abundantly proved. He knew
the condition of his wardrobe, he appre
ciated the scant furnishings of his life,
and the iron of disappointment entered
his kindly soul, piercing the innermost
cockles of his generous heart. During the
past three years his descent into the depths
of grievous poverty was rapid, and his.
eyes were closed at the l.ast by. the More or
less sympathetic hand of periunctory
charity."
PILLATJ THE TAVORITE DISH.
How It Is Concocted by the People of
- . Afghanistan.
A book recently published in London,
entitled "At the Court of the Amir," de
votes considerable space to the cnlinary
methods of the Afghanistans. Pillau is
the favorite dish, and is made either of
fowl or lamb or mutton, or all combined.
The meat is amalgamated with rice, butter,
almonds, raisins, allspice, cardomans, saf
fron, cloves, onion, ginger, bait, whole
peppers and dhiey. The rice is first boiled
until half-done, the onioas and raisins
fried and the fowl cut in pieces and rubbed
with ginger and dhiey. The meat is al
lowed to remain in this state for two hours,
when it is put in some butter at the bot
tom of the pot; over it is placed a layer of
rice, then another of onions, raisins and
almonds, sprinkled with saffron and
water, then a layer of meat, and so on al
ternately until the pot is filled, when
melted butter is poured over the whole.
The pot is then subjected to a braising
heat or put in an. oven and cooked three
hours. The edges of the pot are sealed
with paste so that no steam can escape.
The next favorite Afghan dish consists of
knobs of meat grilled before a lire. Res
taurants are very numerous, but they are
described as conveying an idea of filth of
which the most imaginative Occidental
cannot conceive. Even the Afghanistans
do not enter them, but eat their meals out
side or carry away the cooked food. Con
fectioners' shops are more cleanly, and are
famous for iced sherbets of various fla
vors. Bread is composed entirely of flat
cakes of dough cooked against the sides
of earth ovens. Vegetables and fruits in
summer are plentiful and cheap.
The Doctor and His Faticnt,
The Parisian wits are reviving an old
story about the wonderful cure from deaf
ness of a patient who was recommended
to go hear "Lohengrin," and to sit near
the orchestra, by Ihe trombones. The
doctor accompanied his patient and snt
beside him. All of a sudden, while the
noise of the instruments was at its loudest,
the deaf man found he could hear. "Doc
tor," he almost shrieked, "I can hear."
The doctor took no notice. "I tell you,
doctor," repeated the man, in ecstasy,
"you have saved me. I have recovered
my hearing." Still the doctor was gilent.
He had become deaf himself!

Opening Night of the Grand Opera
Season at the Baldwin
Theater.
THEA DORRE'S FINE AMNERIS.
Corinne and Comic Opera at the Cali
forniaâ"Joe's Girls" and "Sins
of a Night."
The Baldwin was crowded from floor to
ceiling last night by a brilliantly dressed
audience, eager to welcome the first pev
formance of grand opera this season.
There was more toilette display than
is usual at the local theaters, and the cart
wheel hats that so frequently obscure the
staee were scarcely at ail in evidence, their
places being taken by tiny opera bonnets.
But in spite of its brilliant appearance
the housr , with some exceptions, was not
the usual Baldwin first-night audience.
The Grant-Pond wedding is supposed to
have kept many of the regular habitues
away and the corning Goad-Hooker and
Jarboe-Bull weddings may Lave helped to
thin out the regular frequenters. The
audience contained a large number of well
known people in musical and artistic cir
cles and the spontaneous applause which
always greets anything eood at the
Baldwin Theater was not lacking.
It is difficult to say why "Aida" was
chosen as thp opening opera, for it does
not display the company to such good ad
vantage as some of the other works in the
repertory. Not that the performance last
night was unsatisfactory ; on the contrary
it was marked by some brilliant work, but
it was an uneven performance, marked by
too many ups and downs. "Aida" also
proved trying to the orchestra, particu
larly to the horns, ana its requirements in
the way of grandiose scenic effects and
costumes were scarcely adequately ful
filled.
The overture and the beginning of the
first scene were practically inaudible In
the noise of a late-arriving audience.
Payne Clark was the Radames, and his
"Celeste Aida" won him some applause,
though his rendering of the aria left a
good deal to be desired. Thea D qrre as
Amneris had not much opportunity in
the opening scene to show her mettle, and
â¢ what practically saved it was Mme. Tav
ary s excellent singing in the llnale.
All through the opera, in fact, Mme.
Tavary's singing was an artistic pleasure.
Her acting *ras neither passionate nor con
vincing. She elected to use the Italian lan
guage,which she pronounces execrably, and
she adopted a make-up as. novel as it was
hideous, but she redeemed everything by
her singing. Her voice was clear, ringing,
generally true â even her highest tones
were bell-like, and she sang without effort.
In fact Mine. Tavary proved herself to be
an accomplished vocal artist, and that
covers a multitude of shortcomingsâ even
a weird make-up.
But who ever heard of an Aida whose
"golden hair was hanging down her back " ?
Mine. Tavary indulged in this adornment
last night, but in deference to Aida's Afri
can origin she had compromised for her
blonde locks by painting her face a dusky
brick red, and she wore a cafe au la ft
colored jersey, which did not produce the
illusion of being epidermis, and which
taken in conjunction with lily-wuite
hands, produced a decidedly patchwork
effect. But Mme. Tavary sang as an artist |
should sing, and that is saying much, very
much for her.
Beautiful Thea Dorre did not indulge in
startling skin effects. Nature made her a
brunette, and she only wore an inky wig
and some costumes which would have
been considered ravishing confections in
ancient Egypt. The effect was entirely
satisfactory to the beholders. She threw !
so much majesty into the part of Amneris
that she seemed to have grown inches ,
taller than when she played "Carmen" last i
year. Her acting of the wily imperious i
princess who tries to wrest Radamea !
from ponr Aida was marked by passion j
and intensity. There were moments
when she rose to the height of tragedy, as
in the prison scene with the tenor, whom
phe positively inspired into distinguishing
himself, a feat which he had not
accomplished before during the evening.
Loud and long applause greeted the duet.
All through "Aida," however, Dorre
proved herself to De a brilliant actress and
singer. She sang in Italian, which she
pronounced in a way that won the
"bravos" of the members of the local
Italian colony present.
A. Abrahamhoff, a new basso, dis
tinguished himself greatly as Ramfis.
He has a fine, well-trained voice and a
majestic presence. Max Eugene, another
new-comer, did well as Anionostro.
Both these siilgers have won distinction
in Europe. â¢
The ensemble work in the triumph
scene was one of the best parts of the per
formance iast night. The choruses all
through the work were satisfactory and
the orchestra did some good work, though
the brass strayed off the pitch occasion
ally.

At the California.
Corinne was greeted at the California last
night by an audience that filled the theater.
And it was a very well-pleased audience from
â the moment the curtain went up until Hen
drick Hudson kissed his hand to them and
bade them good-night. The musical extrava
ganza was broken with bits of spe
cialty that varied and relieved the spec
tacle. The company is a strong on c
throughout, although the voices are not of the
highest order. Corinne's singing and dancing
and dressing were fetching. Charles Kostalla
as l' isabel, the Marquis' daughterâ as haughty
as her sire, if not more soâ was a star part. His
dancing was something in the nature of a rev
elation. Ben. E. Grinncll, the comedian, was
especially happy as Kill Yon Kull, a real estate
agent, the first of his tribe. Among the
specialty bits was Lindsey Morrison's anvil
song and the Nichols sisters as the "plantation
swells:"
A little touch of Trilbyâ a parodyâ was in
! troduced before the closing tableau, in which
Grinncll does his Svengali hynotic dance and
Corinne, ablaze with diamonds, sings Ben Bolt
quite effectively. The California is certain to
have crowded houses all the week. By invita-

At thÂ« Columbia,
The second week of "Men and Women" was
ushered in by an audience which filled every
seat in the Columbia. The Frawleys have cer
tainly made their mark in this City. The
plays which they have presented have ah been
fresh, well acted and replete with interest.
'Men and Women" is one of their best and
gives all the members of this well-chosen band
of finished actors a chance to shine.
l>aniel Frawley as the assistant cashier is at
his best, while Jennie Kennark as the govern
or's daughter shows a fine appreciation of her
exacting part, which she has mastered to per
fection. The otaer characters are well taken
and the general effect of the piece is harmo
nious and pleasing, while the sensational
scenes, though full of fire, are never over
drawn.
At the Tivoli.
"The Gentle Savage" met with a warm re
ception last night, and both piece and savage
deserved it. The composition is a fantastic
and certainly much overdrawn picture of bor
der life and the strange manner in which In
dians and cowboys, monks and ballet-girls,
drummers and Spanish hidalgos come and go is
rather bewildering. The capricious piot hinges
upon the efforts of a savage American Indian to
attain a higher moral and social plane. Hav
ing money, he is able to observe civilization,
and becomes so disgusted with its hidden can
cers and worthless shams that he turns from
modern culture with loathing. Unable to re
lapse into his native barbarism, he com
promises by becoming half-civilized, in which
condition he is charming. Ferris Hartman
makes a great hit in the part, which, in other
hands, might be an utter failure.
Gertie Carlisle, as the little drummer boy, is
effective to a remarkable degree for her "ten
der years. She gives promise of making a
brilliant record as an actress, while her voice,
strong, accurate and expressive even novr,
must develop into something far above the
ordinary if not too severely taxed during its
formation period. Much care has evidently
been taken in the rehearsals for the piece, for
all the paits are exceedingly well taken. "Der
Freischutz" is promised for the next week,
but it looks as though the "Savage" might re
tain his gentle sway for at least a fortnight.
Morosco's,
The melodrama had its usual large following
at Morosco's last evening to witness the dark
enterprises and hairbreadth 'scapesâ that did
not all get away- as presented under the title
of "The Sins of a Night." The play is charged
with exciting situations, which keep the audi
ence under the influence of a thrill from the
first act to the final climax. It will enjoy good
business through tne week.
At the Ornhenm.
Rachel Walker's soft, silvery, high notes seem
to drive her audiences to a veritable frenzy of
applause, the gifted Creole girl being obliged
to reappear again and again to bow her ac
knowledgments. Last night she sang the airy
waltz song irom "Romeo and Juliet." and
threw into it such a wealth of artistic fiora
turn, especially in the intricate cadenza at the
end, that she was obliged to repeat the closing
movement in Miswer to a most enthusiastic
and prolonged recall. Her other numbers*.
"For all eternity" and "Love's old sweet song,"
were equally good.
Billy Carter, the comedian banjo specialist,
gave a number of very taking selections in his
inimitable style, while the Fonte Bons Broth
ers, in their imitation of the sound of bells,
were exceedingly effective. The dancers,
Howley and Doyle ; the De Witt Sisters, and
the other participants in the long and inter
esting programme, all contributed to render
the bill most entertaining and enjoyable.
At the Alcazar.
"The Arabian Nights" at the Alcazar is not
a spectacular, spangle and gilt entertainment,
smelling of the incense of the far East, as its
title might lead one to suppose. It is, on the
contrary, one of Sidney Grundy's' rollick
ing comedies. ATthur Hnmmingtop (Here
ward Hoy te) thought himself a * Caliph
and under that impression tansies him
seti up in a maze of difficulties in
which Mrs. Hummingtop and her mother and
several qther relatives figure, and keep the
audience in an uproar. The play is in thrpp
acts, and was followed by "Joe's Girls "a iarce
comedy in one act. "Joe's Girls" is a very
funny skit. It is presented in fine style. Leon
ard Grover Jr. does Ira Bagstock and does it in
a form supported by a cast that entitles the
play to the magnificent run â which it enjoyed
in New \ ork, extending over 1400 nights.
Bush-Street Theater.
People call it the "New Bush-street Theater"
now, but last night the ancient temple of the
drama proved itself an old favorite. A large
and appreciative audience filled every portion
oi the house and laughed and wept in genuine
old-fashioned style over the changing scenes in
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." The old play is well
staged and its characters ably sustained. Edna
Clare, as Topsy. is a revelation. The strange
mixture of brightness and ignorance, wit and
stupidity with which she endows the unique
part renders it most effective. Maud Brink Is
hard worked in the dual role of Aunt Ophelia
and Eliza, but makes a success of both. Harry
West as Uncle Tom is a good interpreter ot that
pathetic part, while J. Hartwell as Simon Le
gree, the planter, makes a villain with the
real old ring to him. The other char
acters are well sustained and some of
the groupine-s and tableaux exceedingly
effective. The music between the acts is des
tined to become a feature of the performances
at this place of amusement if it sustains its
present high standard. Last night's entr'acte
programme was notably good, the rendering
of the "Light Cavalry Overture" being particu
larly fine. ;
BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR `96
The Hopeful Words of the Pres
ident of the Board of
Trade.
Proceedings at the Annual Meeting-
Officers Electedâ As to Home
Industries.
The Board of Trade of San Francisco
will have for president until next Febru
ary A. A. Watkins, he having been re
elected at the nineteenth annual meeting,
held yesterday afternoon.
The president read his annual report,
from which it appears that during the year
the association donated $1000 to the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, to be used in
defraying the expenses of a protest to the
Secretary of the Interior against issuing
patents to mineral lands claimed as agri
cultural lands. The mining industry, he
declared, is undergoing a great revival
and promises soon to resume its former
magnitude. The association also con-
tributed $250 to defray the expense of
printing an illustrated description of the
Nicaragua canal and $100 to defray part of
the expense of sending Mrs. .Lucy McCann
to the Atlanta Exposition and $20 to the
Manufacturers' Association.
The membership of the association is
201, and during the year there were five
deaths â Adolph Glootz, Isaac Hecht,
Joseph A. Ford, C. M. Kutz and R. F.
Bunker.
He called attention to complaints about
settlements without sufficient investiga
tion and said that while thrse settlements
were made through the Board of Trade
they were the acts of the creditors only
who were directly interested. He expressed
himself in favor of being merciful to mer
chants who have become embarrassed
from any cause beyond their control, but
that when failures are tainted with frauds
the parties should be ptished to the wall.
He deplored the system of indiscrim
inate credits, and suggested a careful
scrutinization of the people asking it
and asked whether credits ought not
to be restricted, and if it would not be a
kindness to many who are striving to start
in business by buying a stock on credit
from wholesale dealers.
The custom of extending dates, he said,
is injurious alike to debtor and creditor.
He then spoke of home industries, and
declared that the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association is doing good work in
that line. He spoke of the work of the
San Francisco committee on commerce .
Iv closing he said:
The outlook for 1896 is certainly very en
couraging. Greater employment lor the in
dustrious, better wages for services rendered,
higher prices for our staples are among the
certainties, the only uncertainty clouding the
situation being the derangement of the Na
tional finances. At present it is impossible to
predict what the action of Congress will be in
regard to currency, the bond issue and, the
proposed change in the tariff. The questions
all have the greatest influence upon busi
ness, and it will continue to depend upon
these subjects being handled intelligently and
patriotically without regard to party or to
section.
The report of Secretary H. L. Smith
shows:
Receipts of the board â¢ for the year ending
February 1, 1896, $4T.770 38, including a bal
ance on hand February 1, 1895, of $23,463 06.
Of these receipts $12,525 were derived from
members' dues, $7046 30 from non-members,
commissions, $659 46 from interest on deposits,
and $4076 56 from law department fees. The
disbursements 6f the past year amounted to
$31,405 78. including $23,9il 23 for salaries,
rents, insurance and other running expenses,
$6124 55 for furniture and renovations to the
rooms, $20 for the Manufacturers' Convention,
$1000 donated to the California Miners' Asso
ciation, $250 for Nicaragua canal literature,
and $100 given to the State Development Com
mittee. There is a Dresent cash balance of
$16,364 60 in the hands oJ the treasurer, and
sundry bills for the month of January due and
unpaid, amounting to $2029 75.
The total membership of the Board of Trade
February 1, 1896, was 201. During the year
eleven new members were admitted, and six
teen members resigned and retired from busi
ness.
The number of cases reported to the board
A. A. Watkins, President of thÂ© Board
of Trade.
[From a photograph.]
for the year was 1028, of which 662 cases were
acted upon. The amount of liabilities as re
corded was $2,697,671. The number of credi
tors' meetings called was 723, and 477 com
mittee meetings were also called. Of the 662
cases acted upon, 294 were actually settled and
368 are still pending.
The average percentage of the settlements
was 50.6. There were 863 dividends, amount
ing to $673,194 33, paid through the office of
the board to creditors of estates.
Of the 662 failures reported to the board dur
ing the year 519 were in the State of Califor
nia, and 130 were in San Fraucisco. The great
est number of failures in any line of trade was
160 in the general merchandise business. The
grocery business had 139 failures, furnishing
goods fifty-five, dry goods forty-eight, hardware
thirty-three, boots and shoes twenty -one, and
liquors eighteen.
At the next special meeting an amend
ment to the by-laws offered by J. Lievre
will be acted upon. It provides that if any
creditor-member objects to a settlement it
shall be referred to an arbitration commit
tee, to be composed of persons not related
to either creditor or debtor.
The following directors were elected for
the year: A. A. Watkins, to succeed him
self; H. M. Hoi brook, to succeed E. K.
Newhall. and Frank Brigham, to succeed
Webster jomes. S. Feuchtwanger was
chosen for one year, vice Henry Payot, re
sitrned.
The board then elected the following
officers: A. A. Watkins, president; S.
Nickeiburg, first vice-president; F. J. Par
sons, second vice-president; A. L. Scott,
treasurer; H. L. Smith, secretary, and
Joseph Kirke, attorney.

appointed to look into trie standing of the
concern.
A meeting was held yesterday, but the
expert could make no report as the ac
counts are in such a tangle that he iinds
great difficulty in unraveling them. About
the only thing done during the day was
the appointing of Charles Nelson to the
agency for the bark Colusa and barkentine
Mary Winkleman.
In connection with the cashing of an $80
check by Gus Gerdau. as stated in yester
day's Call, there was a mistake made.
Mr. Gerdau says tbat he has honored
thousands of checks drawn by George F.
Smith & Co. and never knew one of tnem
to be dishonored. According to him the
story originated as a joke.
The old-time ship Glory of the Seas got
in from Nanaimo, B. C, yesterday after a
amart passage of fourteen days. She was
caught in the southeaster that damaged
the other vessels that have been dropping
in for a week past and was rough ly
handled. Fifty feet of her bulwarks was
carried away, her cargo shifted and one of
the crew was washed overboard. It was
about 11 o'clock on the night preceding
the big storm. Everything pointed to
dirty weather and Captain Freeman
ordered four men out on the bowsprit to
secure the jib. A big wave came along
and when it had passed there were only
three men on the bowsprit. Thomas Dick
son had been washed away. He was a
native of Ireland and well known on the
water front. This was the fourth round
voyage he had made on the Glory of the
Seas.
The Italian man-of-war Cristoforo Co
lombo is daily expected from Fuget Sound
and the Italian colony here is all ready to
give her a right royal weldorne. Many of
the crew have relatives and friends in San
Francifco. so the stay of everybody con
nected with the ship is sure to be enjoy
able. Among the officers is Lieutenant Et
tore Frieerio, second aid-de-camp to Prince
Luigi of Savoy, who is also a lieutenant on
the vessel. Lieutenant Fr'gerio is well
known in San Francisco and his friends
will be glad to meet him again.
The following notice to mariners has
been issued by the Inspectors of the Light
house Board :
Notice is hereby given that the Coos Bay ouÂ£
side bar â whistling buoy, painted black ana
white, perpendicular stripes, marked with the
letter "X" in white, has gone adrift from its
moorings, about one and a quarter miles out
side of the bar. It will bo replaced as soon as
practicable.

There was a row on the schooner Marion,
lying at Fremont-street wharf, that re
quired the assistance of the harbor police
to quell yesterday. Axel Wilson and Carl
Richardson started in to run the ship, and
when .Officers Cockrill and Shaw appeared
on the scene they showed fight.. Cockrill
soon had the irons on Wilson, but Rich
ardson and Shaw had a rough-and-tum
ble, of which the former got decidedly the
worse.
Thursday last Wilson and Richardson
got drunk and deserted the schooner. On
Sunday they returned and gave Mate
Charles Braun a licking because he would
not give them everything they wanted to
eat and then ran away. When they showea
up yesterday two new men were in their
I places and they started in to run them off
tUe vessel. Then the row began.
At the Harbor Police station Wilson and
Richardson were charged with disturbing
the peace and resisting an officer.
ALL FOR THE ACADEMY.
President David Starr Jordan on the
Latest Departures in -the
Interest of Science.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University came up from Palo Alto
yesterday on business in connection with
the Academy of Sciences, of which he is
also president by recent election.
Dr. Jordan has been doing a lot of think
ing lately as to the best ways of advancing
the Academy and its varied interests. He
has completed arrangements for an inter
esting course of lectures.
"The object is to eÂ«t lecturers that people
will come and hear." said Dr. Jordan.
"We want to popularize the Academy and
yet we want to give thoroughly scientific
information. E. J. Molera, who has spent
some time in Mexico and become possessed
of very important facts regarding the Az
tecs, will &peak on their early history. Dr.
Rosenau of Washington, D. C., who is
now here, will deliver a lecture on the re
lation of bacteria to dairying. It will be
important.
''There are bacteria in milk that are very
deleterious to health, and again there are
bacteria that give to butter its fine flavor.
It has been shown lately that if bacteria
are removed from milk it will keep sweet
for a great length of time.
"Dr. Frank Angel will deliver a lecture
on an equally important subject, namely,
illusions ana hallucinations as a basis of
spooks and apparitions â that is. as a sci
entific basis, for there is some little basis
in everything of this sort. The most of
the people who attempt to teach things
about spirits, the supernatural, are frauds.
Some of them honestly believe what they
say, because of illusions and hallucina
tions which they are laboring under. Yet
the dollar is a potent thing, and I have my
suspicions of most of the people who take
money in connection with the spook and
spirit'basiness. We will go into the sub
ject a good deai at the Academy.
"Rain-making will also receive its proper
attention. Of course, nobody can any
I more make rain than he can make the sun
shine. Yet so many people have been go
ing about making money out of this
alleged power to produce rain that it is
time the whole matter was thoroughly ex
posed. Professor Stanford of Stanford
University will take up this topic.
"There will be many other lectures on
other important subjects. These, how
ever, will be the first. We have also com
pleted arrangements for a number of lec
turej in the Stanford extension course.
The first six of these will be on society.
Professor H. H. Powers of the chair of
economics in the university will deliver
the first. It will be on the abolition of
poverty. Professor Thoburn will deliver
the next on some phase of society. Others
will follow regularly from other sources."
FREIGHTS TO THE NORTH
A Letter of Suggestion Sent Out
by the Traffic Associ
ation.
It Points Out How Trade May Be
Increased in Oregon and
Washington.
Traffic Manager W. B. Curtis of the
Traffic Association of California has issued
the following self-explanatory letter to tha
members of the association:
Xhe trade of San Francisco has for some time
felt that it was handicapped in Ore
gon and Washington owing to the com
petition of Portland, Or., and Seattle
and Tacomn, Wash., in those fields, and
to an adjustment of freight rates- from San
Francisco not consistent with, our position.
The difference between rates â say from Port
land, Or., to interior Washington and from San
rrancisco to the same pointsâ has been so
great as to almost stifle competition from this
City; or at least make it next to impossible for
a San Francisco merchant to do business there
at a profit.
This rate adjustment is brought about by an
agreement between the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company, the Northern Pacific
Hailroad, the Southern Pacific Company, the
GrAt Northern Railroad and the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company.
Some members of the combine may or may
not be willing signers, but are swayed by tne
majority.
Therefore, the best interests of the San Fran
cisco trade demand that some step betaken
to strengthen its position in the territory men
tioned, and we should therefore lend support
to the line or lines that would extend to us a
helping hand.
A siatement is attached showing the rates in
effect Via the Southern Pacific Company's all
rail line, with the published tariff o: the Ore
gon Railway and Navigation Company, or the
Northern Pacific Railroad, as compared with
the rates obtainable by patronizing the steam
ers Alice Blanchard or Empire to Kalama or
Portland, plus tne looal rates of the Northern
Pacific Railroad.
The rates in effect on the steamers Alice
Bianchard and Empire apply upon weight or
measurements and at present time are $1 per
ton from San Francisco to Kalama or Portland.
For all points 6ho\vn in this paper you should
consign via Kalama, wnere transfer is effected
and delivery made to the Northern Pacific Rail
road Company.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany has put on a steamer to ply between
l'orland, Or., and way ports south and carry
freight at $1 per ton. This action is m direct
opposition to San Francisco's best interests, as
it serves to draw trade from this port.*
The North Pacific Steamship Company, own
ing and operating the steamers Alice Blanch
ard and Empire, do not take freight south
bound from Portland to way ports at less than
$3 per ton.
On the other hand, we do not expect or be
lieve that any line can long continue to exist
at a rate of $1 per ton from San Francisco to
Portland, yet when it comes to a point where
the lines again agree to and do advance rates
we should aim to be in position to say that
rates shall not advance beyond a reasonable
figure, and to that end the support given to the
Alice Blanchard and Empire will work.
The rates named in the attached sheets are
made by adding 5 cents per 100 poundsâ sl
per tonâ to the local rates applying from Port
land inland. These rates will therefore apply
only when your shipments go at actucl weight.
If taken by steamer at measurement your rate
will be increased by the difference in the meas
urement weight over the actual weight. Steam
ers ot this line sail from pier 13â Vallejo-street
wharfâ the next sailing being the Empire, Feb
ruary 7, 1896.
The table referred to in this letter shows
that the differences in favor of the line
supported by the Traffic Association range
from 10 to 25 per cent.
LE CONTE TELLS OF DANA
A Scholarly Memoir Delivered
at the Acdaemy of
Sciences.
ELOQUENT AND ERUDITE.
He Characterizes the Departed Scien
tist as the One Master in
Geology.
Professor Joseph Le Conte delivered at
the Academy of Sciences last evening a
scholarly and eloquent memoir on the late
James Dwight Dana of New Haven, Conn.
He said :
By the death of Professor Dana, the fore
most geologist not only of Ataerica, but of the
world, hus been taken from us.
My first meeting with Professor Dana was in
the year 1850, when I listened at New Haven
to his paper on the analogy of reproduction in
hydroids and plants. This subject is well
known now, but was new then. His slender
form, agreeable, resonant voice and magnetic
personality, together with the deep philosophy
of his thought and its poetical expression",
made a great impression upon me.
Among such men as Agassiz. Henry, and
William and Henry Rogers, Dana, although ;
only 37, was a prominent figure, for at that
time he had published some of his greatest
scientific works.
If it is true, as the positive philosopher Kant
has it, that a noble life is one in which a noble
fundamental idea is conceived in youth and
which the remaining years of that life are
spent in developing, then the life of Dana was
eminently noble, for in his early manhood he
conceived the idea of evolution in geology,
and the efforts of bis entire remaining years
were directed to the aevelopment and elabora
tion of that idea.
The idea of evolution in geolojry was not
clearly known at that time. Although it per
haps was dimly seen by the leading lights of
science, it did not become a vitalizing idea
until Dana. Then it was set forth clearly, like
a revelation, in his "Manual of Geology."
The publication of this idea marks an impor
tant epoch in the history of this science.
The idea of the development of theearth as a
unit reconstructed geological science, and on
this basis geology became one of the great
branches of abstract science, and all through
the efforts of Dana.
The professor outlined a brief history of
the laic scientist's life, dwelling on those
epochs when he had achieved fame by the
fruits of his research and discoveries.
He was born February 12, 1813, at Utica.
N. V., of intelligent New England parents,
â¢ana died iv New Haven, Conn., April 14, 1895,
aged 82 years and 2 months.
His early taste was fostered by direct contact
with nature and under the guidance of such
men as Fay Templeton and Dr. Asa Gray. In
1820 he entered Yale College, and on his
graduation began a sea voyage on one of the
Bhips of thfc-United States navy as an instructor
of midshipmen. During this voyage he care
fully studied the phenomena of volcanoes, and
on his return in 1835 he published his first
scientific paper, which was on "'Vesuvius."
Subsequent to this voyage he made another
around the world, and afterward lived the
usual uneventiul life of the scientist. His
achievements and activity were in the world,
of thought, and whatever field of science he
touched he illuminated. There are few men
.vhose thoughts have ranged so widely as have
Dana's. He became the highest living autnor
ity in geology and zoology. In these he was
foremost, and in such sciences as physics,
chemistry and even mathematics his knowl
edge was vast and thorough. As he grew
older his chief interest and his highest activity
grayitated to geology.
Dana's wide and exact knowledge in other
sciences peculiarly fitted him for ecologyâ
fitted him even better than though he were a
specialist in that science.
The subject of corals, coral reefs and coral
islands interested him greatly, and the mighty
and gradual movements of the earth's crust as
set forth in the subsidence theory of atoms
powerfully affected his mind. This theory
that originated with Darwin, that the flora of
the mid-Pacific is sinking, and in correlation
to it that the American continent is rising,
particularly along its western border, and has
been rising for ages, la one on which he. threw
much light and to which he furnished many
substantiating proofs.
Another theory that originated from his
labors and that received his earnest attention
was the theory of capitalization or "headvrard
development"â the increasing of the head
function over the bodily function. Dana an
nounced this as a law of evolution, and as a
guide for classification. He discovered it while
classifying crustaceans.
Like all great thoughts its application is
Doundless, and, like great thoughts, it is ac
corded many applications. I myself apply it
as the increasing dominanceof the higher over
the lo%ver and of the highest over all. Begin
ning with the lowest form of lifeâ the
protozoan â and ascending upward to man we
lind the numerous functions to have a ten
dency toward more rapid and more perfect de
velopment. In tne numerous functions the
highest part, the brain, receives the most at
tention; in the brain the highest ganglia or
the cerebrum; in the cerebrum the external
gray matter, and in the gray matter the domi
nating development of the highest part is evi
denced in the increasing proportion of the
frontal lobe.
As there is an increasing disposition of mind

9ver body,- so is there of the reflective faculties
over the faculties of action and of the moral
over all, and in civilization we find the same
analogy.
The most potent causes are slow in effect and
are remote from ordinary notice. It was
these causes that took a great hold on Dana.
Geology before Dana was a hfstory, and with
him it has become a philosophy of history of
absorbing interest. For the first time there
was recognized a tiny cosmoÃ. Before him.
geology was a study of a succession of forma
tions, and after him it became a study of eras
of development tending toward a definite per
fection. He shadowed forth the evolu
tion of the earth as a whole. To show
the development of the earth he chose
North America as â¢ an epitome of the
earth's history. This idea of our organic
development of the continent he worked out
in all its details, and this has come to be the
working idea for scientists generally. lithe
American geologists have beÂ°n especially suc
cessful in developing the theory of the forma
tion of mountain ranges it is because Dana led
tne way.
Another idea that received an ardent accept
ance at his hands was that put iorth by Agassis
of the early existence of the great northern ice
sheath.
As a teacher Dana stands in great eminence.
He could never have written such a book as his
"Manual" had he not been a life-long teacher. 1
I Teaching and research are closely ailiedf-the
one reacts upon the other.
It is impossible almost to separate the
teacher from the man. 1 dare not finer the
inner sanctuary of his home or his home rela
tions, but no one has becti with him who has
not been impressed by his simple earnestness
of character and his ardent love for truth for
j truth's sake. In all his works may be seen his
open receptiveness of mind and a perfect will
ingness to modify his own views to laudable
correction.
Our master in ceology is taken from us.
Let us hope that if the whole of his mantle
cannot fall on one of us, it may be parted ana
the fragments fall on some of us.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Business will improve with: the passage
of the reform tariff.
There are more citrus fairs to come and
then the flower shows will open.
This week the House will either put
Bayard in the soup or roast him.
We are proudest of our school system
when we are not looking at it closely.
The silver bill has been sent to the

it along.
If Hammond suffers in the Transvaal it
will be Cleveland that will be condemned
in America.
Judging from Salisbury's speech there
will be no rest for the Armenians until the
Turk gets weary.
Putting Huntington under the cathode
ray is the way lo show the skeleton in the
monopoly closet.
Out of all the war talk in the Senate
there should come at least a vote for an
increase of the navy.
The fight against the monopoly at
Frankfort is not so big as the one at Wash
ington, but it is just as lively.
If Congress wishes to refund anything
for 100 years at 2 Der cent it should make
the trial on the Cleveland debt.
There may be some rural industries over
done in California, but there are a hun
dred that haven't been done at all.
With eight queens and a poetess the San

The revival of hydraulic mining and the
improvtment of the rivers should go hand
in hand as two parts of one movement.
The Czar will never be known as the
arbitrator of Europe until he establishes a
free press and works it for advertising.
Germany and England continue to make
faces at one another, but they are only
dough faces and neither side is scared.
The defect in Huntington's bureau of
promotion is that it is also a bureau of
publicity and its falsehoods get detected.
If we intend to prevent the struggle in
Cuba from degenerating into a war of ex
termination it is time for us to intervene.
The new phase of the funding-bill fight
shows that the strength of the monopoly
is not so great as some people thought it
was.

THE BEST PAVEMENTS.
The report made by Engineer Ernest
McCullough to the Merchants' Association
on the subject of street pavements con
tains much information of the greatest
value. Its most significant feature is its
showing of thÂ« rapidity with Which
asphalt pavements are coming into use
and the effect which they have on the
health of tne people and the values of
fronting property. A great deal of paving
with stone is still done, but that is merely
because it is very durable and the people
are accustomed to it.
With reference to the effect which
asphalt pavements have on the value of
property Mr. McCullough makes the fol
lowing statement: "A ital estate man in
New York City figured that if Eighth
avenue were paved with asphalt from
Fifty-ninth street to One Hundred ana
Tenth street the 224 building lots on the
avenue would be built upon at an average
expenditure of $15,000. This would make
the total productive expenditure $3,300,000,
which, assessed at half its value and taxed
2 per ceat, would yield the city a revenue
of $33,000. The city could borrow $130,000,
the money necessary to pave that part of
Eighth avenue with asphalt, at 3 per cent,
so that by accomplishing this work it
would be a gainer to the extent of $29,000
per annum." Mr. McCullough therefore
suggests that it is in order for some real
estate man to do some figuring of the
same kind on the proposition to pave
Market street in this. City.
On the subject of the better health of the
people, resulting from the use of asphalt,
Mr. McCullouKn quotes the Health Officer
of Philadelphia, where the streets have
been recently paved with asphalt, to the
effect that the death rate from consump
tion in that city had decreased from 31.93
in 10,000 to 22.04, solely as the result of
employing asphalt. The reason is that
asphalt streets are perfectly clean and dry;
no filth can lodge and decompose in them.
He might have added that there was aJso
a great improvement in the nervous tone
of the residents, as the noise from stone
pavements is acknowledged to be in
jurious.
Mr. McCullough suggests tha,t Market
street be paved with asphalt or bitumi
nous rock, both of which are abundant in
California, and insists that the European
plan of requiring guarantees for a term of
years be strictly followed, as that offers
the only assurance of honest work.
Market street will have to be paved
sooner or later, even though the City may
have to issue bonds for the purpose. The
completion of the ferry building will
make this improvement imperative. With
such a pavement as that which Pennsyl
vania avenue, in Washington City, has, it
would be one of the famous streets in the
world.
BUILD THE OBSERVATORY.
Messrs. Hammon and McAdie, who have
charge of the local weather observing sta
tion, have announced their intention, of
canvassing among the wealthy people of
the City for funds with which to construct
and equip a meteorological oOservatory on
the summit of Tamalpais. All that is
asked for is the trifling sum of $25,000. It
is really the duty of tne Government to
make an appropriation for the purpose,
but as that is a slow and uncertain process,
and as the benetits of surh an institution
would be very great in view of the neces
sarily restricted and inadequate means at
present possessed for observing and fore
casting the weather, it is eminently proper
that the observatory should be constructed
by private donation.
We beg to suggest, hawever, what we
deem a better and simpler plan than that
proposed by Messrs. Hammon and Mc-
Adie. It is that all the money be sub
scribed by some individual wealthy citi
zen and that the observatory be given his
or her name. The amount called for is
1-800 part of Leland Stanford's endow
ment of the university which bear? his
name, 1-28 of the amount which James
Lick gave for the establishment of the
great observatory on Mount Hamilton,
1-16 of Mr. Wilmerding's bequest for a
polytechnic school, something less than
the sum which it cost Mr. McSweeney to
erect the handsome structure on the sum
mit of Strawberry Hill, and exactly what
it cost C. P. Huntington to render his
fame imperishable in the shape of a cas
cade in Golden Gate Park. The value of
Mr. Sutro's completed and promised gifts
cannot now be estimated, but they will
run far above $1,000,000.
The Call would be very happy to an
nounce the name of the citizen who is
willing to perform this valuable public
service to the commerce of San Francisco
and the agriculture of California. It
might be well to present the observatory
to the State University, as Mr. Lick did
the astronomical observatory, and make it
v part of the State's meteorological serviqe.
[ts active conductors should be furnished
by the Weather Bureau of the National
Department of Agriculture, and such stu-
dents of the State University as rr>ay want
to make the higher study of meteorology
which will be possible at the proposed ob
servatory could receive a regular training
there as do those at the Lick Observatory
who take a course in astronomy.
A BEAVE PROPOSITION.
There is something fascinating in the
declaration made hy a member of the
State Bureau of Highways that it is the
intention of the bureau to see that a finely
macadamized highway is built from one
end of the State to the other. Such a road
would have a value apart from that of
another railroad or the improvement of
the rivers, and as each county which it
traverses would doubtless construct its
own section the cost would- be widely dis
triouted and would not be a burden. The
road should be made, however, under the
direction of the State Bureau of High-
ways, in order that uniformity be secured,
and legislation should be provided for
placing the care of the highway in charge
of tbe bureau and for compelling the
various counties to make sufficient appro
priations for current repairs. It would
not be at all improper for the State to
assist with the cost of construction and
maintenance, for as the road would beneht
the whole State, including the counties
which it would not touch, a sharing of the
expense would be fair.
Such a road would be as beneficial to the
mountain regions as to the great basin of
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.
Those who traveled the Oregon State road
before the railroad was built remember
vividly its terrors and dangers. In spite
of the fact that it carrieil for many years a
heavy passenger â travel a.nd enormous
amounts of treasure from the gold mines
it was the worst road in the United States.
The old ioad running from San Fran
cisco down through San Jose and San
Luis Obispo to Santa Barbara and Los
Angeles was much better, as the Spaniards
looked after it. And the present roads
through these counties under the manage
ment of the Supervisors are among the
best to be found in any country.
The suggested new road^would not take
that route, out would best cross the Te
hachapi Mountains and run northward
through the San Joaquin Valley to Sacra
mento, and straight up the Sacramento
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
Valley over the old Oregon stage road.
From Redding north this road, in spite of
its own terrors and the blood which
drenched it in the early days, is one of the
most picturesque in the world, and trav
erses a region of inexhaustible wealth, as
yet but w eagerly developed.
It should be borne in mind that no rail
road can take the place of wagon roads,
and that good wagon roads are better in
ducements to settlement and development
than railroads. When it is reflected that
careful estimates, based on large experi
ence and close study, show that 25 per cent
of the value of farm products is consumed
in hauling them over bad roads, and when
in connection with this fact we consider
the heavy charges of the great California
railway monopoly, we can readily under
stand the need for such a highway as that
which is now proposed. The subject should
be vigorously agitated.
AN OLD PRINCIPLE.
The Supreme Court enunciated nothing
new when it decided the other day that a
franchise for a railroad is not a grant of
land but the granting of a privilege, and
that the privilege is granted in tl;e in
terest of the public and not that of the
grantee. Hence the court's conclusion
that a franchise held and not employed
for the public convenience is void. The
decision is important, however, particu
larly at this juncture, in that it establishes
a clear precedent, for attacking some fran
chises which are held in this City and
which are not employed.
The decision should be made to have
even a further effectâ a destruction of the
speculative character of franchises. There
is nothing more dis raceful in municipal
history than the way in which franchises
have been secured in San Francisco and
held for speculative purposes, and San
Francisco has not by any means been the
only sinner in this; regard. Still another
effect of the decision should be the deter
mining of the faith in which a franchise
is procured. It has often happened that
franchises were secured merely for the
purpose of keeping a rival out of the field.
The evil was fostered by the long time
given for the beginning and completion of
construction, and etill further increased
by repeated extensions of time.
This decision will doubtless bring some
comfort to that part of the population
which believes that railroad interests
should be made secondary to those of the
public. To advocate such a doctrine might
look like treason to the imperious power
of the Southern Pacific Company, but it is
good law for all that.
The decision may have still another
effect on the progress of the Valley road
through the San Joaquin. The case de
cided was that of the Southern Pacific
against the Southern California Railroad.
The latter had secured a franchise for a
road along Park avenue in Lagonia Park,
but had delayed a long time in laying its
track. The Southern Pacific demanded
and was granted the right to run its road
over the route, whereupon the Southern
California laid a track which it never
used. The court decided in favor of the
Southern Pacific on the grounds already
stated and on the additional ground that
the Southern Pacific was entitled to
prior consideration by reason of the fact
that the route waa needed as part of a
through line.
The same argument might be made to
apply to the Valley road. Aa the court
has decided that the franchise through
Fresno must be sold at auction it is clear
that every bidder must make as good a
showing as the Valley road before iris bid
can be considered. That will be impossible.
OUE EUSAL INDUSTEY.
It ie reported by the State Board of Agri
culture that the past season has been the
most unsatisfactory in the history of grain
growing in California, and the conclusion
isdrawn thatit is about timefor the wheat
growers of the State to turn their atten
tion to other things. This, of course, does
not mean there shall be no grain-growing
at all, but only that farmers should cease
to depend mainly upon grain for the prof
its of their labor and their farms.
The recent advance in the price of wheat,
with the good prospects of a greater ad
vance to come, will probably maÃe the
current year much more satisfactory to
grain-growers than that of 1895. Neverthe
less the conclusion of the State Board will
need very little, if any, .modification to
correspond with the changed conditions.
Wheat - growing is rapidly becom
ing an industry that can be car
ried on. successfully only in regions
where land is comparatively cheap
and the standard of living much lower
than in California. The vast plains of
Manitoba, Russia, Argentina and Australia
under machine cultivation are producing
wheat too cheaply to make it worth while
for our people to enter into competition.
"We can lind more profit in other things.
The State Board has very properly
pointed out some of the profitable rural in
dustries that can be undertaken by those
who have, hitherto devoted all their energy
and land to grain-crowing. In the further
cultivation of fruit, in the raising of chick
ens either for their eggs or for the ponltry
market, in the dairy business, in the grow
ing of tobacco or sugar beets, there is yet
room for a' large expansion of farm work
in California before the limit of profit will
be reached or the line of overproduction be
anywhere in sight. These, moreover, are
by no means ail the avenues of profit open
to the California farmer, for there is
scarcely any kind of the higher forms of
rural industry known to the world that
cannot be successfully carried on here.
A feature of the report worthy of special
study by merchants as well as farmers is
the consideration given to the possible ex
tension of the market ior the products of
our rural industries. It is certainly pos
sible to make a much larger demand for
such goods than exists at present. As yet
our fruit, wine, oil, nuts and raisins can
hardly be said to be known to the consum
ers of the world. To make them known
affords a task of vast importance for en
terprising men to engage in, and fortu
nately there is no doubt we have the men
whaare capab'e of accomplishing it.

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR.
The Federation of Labor is working steadily
toward the affiliation of all labor organiza
tions of every sort with itself; and there is the
disposition to concede the utmost latitude of
opinion and action consistent with -progress
and unity.
To this end overtures were made to other
labor organizations, and time only can settle.
whether this federation will finally include
everything and be the one all-comprehensive
organization of labor in this country. It has
now come to' be a body of immense power; its
legislative functions are large; its principles
and methods are openly known, and it has
been hitherto cautious and yet pronounced in
its positions and policy. To the extent that it
is tolerant and broad-minded, intent on lifting
up the laboring class, and uses its influence to
improve the environment and opportunities of
the latter will it be respected and its achieve
ments be hailed with gladness by every friend
of social progress. In the election of Mr. Uom
pers to the presidency of the federation this
hope for its future is assured.
The treud of labor sentiment is toward the
extension of municipal power and the social
izing of functions now exercised by private
corporations, and, if with this is united ad
herence to a gradual evolution along this
line, no harm can accrue. It is a hopeful sign
that a representative body like this could hold
an eight days' session in the city of New York,
where it was closely watched and exposed to
the severest criticism, and command, as it did,
the confidence and sympathy of the general
publicâ From "The American Federation of

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
PROPOSED FREE MARKET.
Major C. J. Berry Shows How It Would
Benefit Everybody.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
The new Call has ever been ready to advocate
any measure for tne. benefit of the public, and
Its columns are alwayg at thÂ« disposal of
writers whose Ideas are In unison with that
policy. That free market the Hnrbor Com
missioners are talking about establishing in
San Francisco is a measure that, interests all
I the horticulturists, dairj-men, poultrymen
' and general produce-raisers throughout the
Bau Joaquin Valley and doubtless all over the
State. It is a need long felt and very much
wanted by the farmer, and it seems to the
writer the City will receive great benefit by it,
too. Every fruit season for several years past
thÂ« newspapers of San Francisco have com
plained abo"ut the poor, trashy fruit that the
City was afflicted with, while everybody who
cared to investigate knew that California pro
duced some fruits that were better than is
grown anywhere else on earth. The fruit
grower knows this, too, bin whenever an effort
has been made to furnish the San Francis
cansâthrough commission-dealers â with our
fine fruits the net returns were no better than
that which the "trash" sold for, and the pains
taking horticulturists became, discouraged or
disgusted; so San Francisco went without good
fruit and grumbled in consequence of it.
The free market would g-ive us all a chance
to do business together. The fruit-grower, the
honeyman, the poultry-raiser and the butter
maker would come directly in contact with the
consumer and in a very "short time business
connections would be established between
them.
City families would get a better class of
country produce and doubtless closer friend
ships would be established between the City
and the country. The man who loves "good
things to eat" won't quarrel with those who
furnish those good things, and the seller will
be foolish indeed to "fuss" with his customer.
To all parties in California the free market
will be beneficial and the wonder is it has not
been established long ago.
It is not the raw material alone of our farms
that the free market will aid the farmer in
selling.
There is another item in which our women
folks are properly interested. The farmers
wives are ready now, with sleeves rolled up, to
begin putting up rich, ripe, juicy, canned
fruit*, jams and jellies, made from sure enough
fruits â not gelatine and tartaric acidâ and
good, wholesome, toothsome preserves of all
kinds. Once the City people enow now good
these home-made things are, orders for the
household's luxuries will be forthcoming. The
demand will be remunerative, so that these
jellies, preserves, etc., can be prepared when
the season is at its best.
I believe that every thoughtful farmer in the
country will join in saying, "Let's have that
free market." C. J. Bekp.y.

ORGANIZATION OF MUSICIANS.
San Fhancisco, Cal., February 3, 1896.
To the Editor oj the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sir : I was glad to see that you favored the San
Francisco Symphonic Orchestra with a just
nocice. I have ascertained that the plan of the
organization originated with the musicians of
this City. In London, Vienna, Paris, etc., all
the fine institutions were started by the musi
cians and not by capitalists or theatrical man
agers. Of course people with money and the
general public helped with their patronage,
but the idea was from the musicians.
Judging by Friday's concert, there are musi
cians enough, both as to talent and experi
ence, to form a nucleus of such an institution
as I spoke of if the people of San Francisco
give their support. 1 beg to remain, yours re
spectfully, A. Fbidekbeicu.

Willows Review.
The news of wheat advancing in price is al
most too gooi to last long. The wheat in most
cases is out of the hands of the farmers and in
the hands of the grain speculators, and the
latter will profit by the advance until the next
crop comes on and the farmer has some to sell,
when the bottom will again drop out of the
market aud the farmers' fond hopes and ex
pectations will not be realized. It is to be
hoped that this reasoning is incorrect; but it
is plausible, just the same.

MISSES' REEFERS.
The sailor collar with square fronts forming
revers is the new feature of this season's reefers.
They are fitted with the usual seams in the
back, the fronts toeing loose and seamless.
The model is used for costumes of serge,
cheviots, etc., as well as for separate jackets.
For the latter plain cloths are preferred for
older girls. A stylish coat of browu had the
collar light-brown silk in leather color, with
buttons of the same. For a seaside mountain
garment red cloth is much used.
A jacket of mixed cheviot in light brown,
with a skirt to match, makes the most service
able cofitumejfor geueral wear.
Serges of all colors are used for the same sort
of costume. One pf blue had the collar in red
cloth, with trimming of blue braid.
Waists of cotton, cheviot, chambray, linens,
etc., are worn with these suits.

San Jose Railkoadâ R. D., San Jose, Cal.
The San Francisco and San Jose ttaiiroad was
incorporated July 21. 1860, with a capital of
$2,000,000, of which $400,000 was sub
scribed by San Francisco, $100,000 by San
Mateo County and $200,000 by Santa Clara
County ; $500,000 was reserved by the board
and the balance was secured by the issuance
of bonds. The road was not completed until
the lUth of January, 1864, but on tue 15th of
October, 1863, it was formally opened and the
first train passed over that portion from the
Mission of San Francisco to Big Tree station, on
San Francisquito Creek. On the 16th of Jan
uary following trains commenced to run to San
Jose from the depot at Valencia and Sixteenth
streets. On the 14th of February, 1864, the
line was extended in this City to the corner of
Fourth and Townsend streets.
Diamondsâ Q. L. T., City. The primary form
of the diamond is a regular octahedron, bat it
appears also in rhombic dodecahedrons; and
its crystals often have curvilinear faces and
c'ges. They are cut into various forms, prin
cipally into brilliants and rose diamonds.
The brilliant cut is the most expensive and
difficult, but is also that which best brings out
the beauty of the stone; it has an upper or
principal octagonal face surrounded with
many iacets, and other things being equal,
the greater number of facets the more valuably
is the diamond. Rose diamonds have a flat
base, above which are two rows of triangular
facets, the six uppermost uniting in a point.
Rose diamonds are made of those stones that
are too broad, in proportion to their depth to
be cut as brilliants. Stones still thinner are
cut an table diamonds. Diamonds are gener*
ally colorless and clear like pure water, though
sometimes from some slight foreign inter
mixture they are white, gray, yellow, green,
brown and more rarely orange, red, blue or
black.

TUGBOATS AND
TOWAGE BILLS
A Serious Squabble Over
the Docking of the
Roanoke.
THE STATE IS INVOLVED.
At One Time the Governor Mark
ham Is Said to Have Lent
Assistance.
CHIEF WHARFINGER CENSURED.
Captains of the Two Towboat Lines
Say He Had No Right to
Interfere.
The most sensational incident on the
water front for years happened yesterday,
Mixed up in it were the Btate of California
as represented by the State Harbor Com-
The American Ship Roanoke, Over the Docking of Which the Ship-Owners* and Merchants' Towboat Company, the J. D. Spreckels Tow
boat Company, Williams, Dimond & Co. and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company Are at Outs.
_____^ . [Sketched yesterday by a "Call" artist.]
missionere, the J. D. Spreckels <fe Bros.
Company, the. Shipowners and Mer
chants' Towboat Company, Williams,
Dimond & Co. and the owners of the
American ship Roanoke.
As a matter of course Collis P. Hunting
ton, in the shape of the Pacific Mail Com
pany, had a finger in the' pie, and it was
his tug the Millen Griffiths, that caused
all the disturbance. When the towboat
companies refused to handle the big ship
the owners of the Griffiths stepped in and
offered to do the work. Hence the storm.
The beginning of the trouble dates back
to last year, when the ship Benjamin F.
Packard was run on a rock in Mission Bay
by the tugs Sea Queen and Hercuk s. At
that time all the vessels controlled by
Williams, Dimond & Co. were under con
tract for towage to the Shipowners and
Merchants' Towboat Company. This con
tract is binding, and the Spreckels Com-
Eany and the Shipowners' Association
aye an understanding by which neither
concern will touch a ship contracted to the
other.
When the Packard was finally towed off
the rock she was run on tde mud flats and
there her cargo of wheat was partially dis
charged. Later she was docked and after
all the grain was out she was put on the
Merchants' drydocfc. A new stem was put
in, the copper stripped off and the vessel
recalled and other damages were repaired.
The bill amounted to tens of thousands of
dellars, and when it was sent to the Ship
owners and Merchants' Towboat Com
pany it was repudiated. The value of the
tugs Sea Queen and Hercules was not suf
ficient to cover tbe loss, so the owners of
the Packard libeled the company to
recover tl>e money paid for damages.
The suit is still pending in the United
States District Court, but the breach
between the Shipowners and Mer
chants' Towboat Company has not les
sened because a judicial settlement of the
difficulty is pending. Instead, it has
grown wider day by day until now the
whole State of California is involved.
When the Roanoke, in the same line as
the Packard, arrived off the Farallones, ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBI>TARY 4, 1596.
Captain Hamilton signaled for a tug. The
Fearless of the Spreckels line was close at
hand, but Captain Dan Haskell, knowing
she was a "contract ship," did not at
tempt to go near her. A few minutes
later the shipowners' tup Monarch hove in
sight and took the big vessel in tow. This
was nearly two weeks ago, and as space at
the wharves was very hard to get she was
unable to dock until yesterday.
When Chief Wharfinger Root notified
Captain Hamilton that there was a vacant
wmV? at Howard No. 2, the latter went to
W llliams, Dimond & Co. and informed
them of the fact. In view of the fact that a
suit against the Shipowners and Merchants'
lowboat Company was in the courts ask
ing damages in the case of the Packard, it
was decided not to employ that company's
tugs. An attempt was made to secure one
of the Spreckels tugs, but Superintendent
iiawlev in conforiuance with his agree
ment refused to do the work.
Then it was that Williams, Dimond &
lx>. and the captain of the Roinoke found
themselves in deep water. The onJy other
tug in the bay that could handle the ship
outside of the two regular companies was
the Millen Griffiths, owned by the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company. Overtures WÂ£r<Â»
made to Agent Center and after a great
deal of backing and filling an agreement
was reached by which the Millen Griffiths
will handle all the Sewell line of clippers
for some time to come.
It was when the docking of the Roanoke
began that the excitement started. The
Griffiths was not powerful enough to
handle the heavily laden Roanoke, so the
khzabeth was called in to assist her.
Chief Wharfinger Root anticipated some
damage to the State property and he
ordered out the Governor Markham. The
towboat men assert that the State tug
assisted in docking the vessel, but the men
on the Markham and the State em
ployes protest that she never turned
a wheel. Nevertheless the matter is
to be brought to the attention
of the inspectors of hulls and boilers and
somebody on the Markham will have to
suffer. "The law says that the State must
not enter into competition with private
individuals or corporations," said Captain
Hawley yesterday, "and the fact that the
State tue Governor Markham was along
side the Roanoke when she was docking is
a breach of the law."
The actual, work of getting the big ship
into her berth was one of great labor and
narrow escapes. By a strange coincidence
thu Seafarer was being moved from Howard
No. 2 by the ShiD-owners' and Merchants'
tug Rescue and the shio Dundonald was be
ing docked at Mission No. 2 by the Ship
owners' and Merchants' tug Sea King just
as the Millen Griffiths and Elizabeth were
attempting to get the Roanoke in on the
south side of Howard No. 1. The ship John
McDonald, which had occupied that berth
was removed early in the morning by the
tug Active of the Spreckels Company so
that once the vessel was. in to the dock the
way was clear. Twice, however, she had
to be stopped â once in order to avoid run
ning into the Seafarer and the other time
to allow the Dundonald to cross her bow.
Among those who witnessed the docking
of the biggest American merchantman
afloat were Captain Hawley, superintend
ent of the Spreckels towboat line; Captain
Gray, superintendent, and Captain Groper,
assistant superintendent, of the Ship-own
ers' and Merchants' Towboat Company;
Captain George Hanrey of the tug Mon
arcb, Captain Clem Randall of the tug
Vigilant, Captain Ike Smith of the tug Sea
Queen, Captain J. Biiovich of the tug
Active and Captain Dan Haskell of the big
tug Fearless. They all agreed in saving
that Captain Driscoll of the Millen Grif
fiths had done remarfcably well in the cir
cumstances, and praised him for the man
ner in which he had kandled a very diffi
cult
"The towboat company seems to have
boycotted up," said A. Chesebrough of
WilliamÃ, Dimond & Co. yesterday.
"SprecKels says we are under contract to
the Ship-owners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company, and that therefore he cannot
handle our vessels. Of course an agree
ment is an agreement â and I respect a man
who will keep his end of it. In the case of
the Shipowners' linje, however, they <lam
aj*ed one of our vessels to the extent of
over $20,000, and now they seek to limit
their liability to the value of the tug. Of
course on that basis we refused to do busi
ness with them until the court had. de
cided the matter. We have now entered
into an agreement with the Pacific Mail
Company and their tug will in future do
our work. Just what will be the outcome
of the fight remains to be seen."
Chief W harfinger Root says the tug Mark
ham was only alongside the Roanoke in
order to save State property from damage.
He is positive that the engines were not
turned over until the Markham started to
back out, and is confident that he was in
the right. Nevertheless Hawley and Gray
of the two boat lines intend finding out
just what right a State towboat has to be
alongside a vessel that, is being docked.
After docking the Roanoke the Millen
Griffiths went to the Iroquois of the same
line and took her to sea. As the much
tugged ship was passed the Iroquois
dipped her flags and the tug blew her
whistle. The Roanoke responded and
that was the last of the exciting occurrence.
WANTS A REHEARING.
Steinberg Thinks Another Argument
Will Clear Him.
Counsel for Louis Sternberg has applied
for a rehearing, the petition being based
upon purely technical points. Sternberg
was granted a new trial upon one of his
convictions and was held on the other by
the Supreme Court.
The principal point of the petition for a
rehearing is the misconstruction by the
lower court, by the jury and by the Su
preme Court of the charge against the pe
titioner. It is argued that the charge
against Sternberg is that he did "cause,
procure and allow" A. Gutman to be reg
istered as a voter. The question which
counsel wishes to bring out is. Did the jury
convict him of causing, procuring or al
lowing Gutman to falsely register? This
is considered a strong point.
Other points are that the court misdi
rected the jury in matter of law, and that
there was no evidence to establish the sub
stantive elements of the crime outside of
Gutman, the accomplice. The court also
erred, it is claimed, in decisions on two
motions of iaw during the course of the
trial.

' THE WILMERDING SCHOOL.
A Fine Site Ottered at the End of
Castro Street.
At the meeting of the Board of Regents
this afternoon the matter of selecting a
site for the Wilmerding School will be one
of the principal subjects discussed. Mayor
Sutro has offered three desirable lots for
the college, but so far he has failed to give
the regents descriptions of the prop
erties. The fact that the regents have re
quested descriptions is taken by many as
an indication that they are favorably dis
posed toward locating the school in San
Francisco.
Among tnose who have been in hard at
work to accomplish this are the Mer
chants' Association, the Mechanics' Insti
tute and the Half-million Club. Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda also are desirous or
obtaining the prize, but from indications
San Francisco has tbe preference.
When the Board of Regents meet to-day
another offer of a college site will be made.
The Castro Land Company has offered a
fine lot in ita tract near the terminus of the
Castro-street cable-car line. The offer
comes from A. S. Baldwin, the secretary of
the land company, who states that the
proffered land is beautifully located upon
rising ground on th<2 lower slope of the
Twin Peaks hills. It commands a fine
view of a large portion of ti-e City.

CHINATOWN
SHOWS DECAY
Some Significant Signs of
Rapidly Dwindling
Population.
REAL ESTATE FALLING.
A Financial Man Recommended
the Rejectment of Any
Loans There.
WENDELL EASTON'S OPINION,
Rev. F. J. Masters Says There Are
10,000 People Less Than Eleven
Years Ago.
If Chinatown continues to contract in
both population and area as it has in the
last ten years it will not be long before the
dream of Denis Kearney will become a
reality, and the Celestials will pass away
from our shores.
There is no longer any possible doubt
about the rapid depopulation of the Chin
ese quarter. If the exodus keeps up and
the exclusion act prevails it will be but a
few short years before the terrible minor
music of the Chinese theaters, the wails of
professional mourners and the sharp bark
of highbinders' sixsbooters will be stilled
forever.
People who are in a position to observe
the rapidity with which Chinatown is fall
ing under the pressure of restriction and
exclusion laws see all the signs that come
with the dismemberment of a section of
the City which has been the scene of
many incidents that mark its growth, it
has been a scene of murder, intrigue, de
pravity and vice. If any goodness ever
lived tliere it was driven out by the fail
ure on the part of the inhabitants to com
ply with the provisions of the cubic-air
law.
To-day, however, the population is
dwindling away and the actors in the
drama are only called upon for an occa
sional rehearsal. The full blast of iniquity
is taking a breathing spell once in a while
and purer atmosphere rinds itself consumed
by less lungs than of old.
'One of the best informed men on China
town in San Francisco is the Rev. F. J.
Masters of the Chinese Mission on Wash
ington street. The gentleman speaks the
language fluently and has written a great
deal of valuable matter in relation to the
people. He said in an interview yesterday :
"Estimating the' number of people
roughly I should say that there are 10,000
less Chinamen here to-day than there were
eleven years ego when L first came among
them. At that time the streets . were
crowded night and day, but at present they
are becoming thinned out, and notwith
standing the fact that they are a people
wbo live in very close quarters one can
easily see that they are not so plentiful.
"This fact is particularly noticeable
among the tenement-houses where they
used to be crowded in in unlimited quan
tities. I recollect the time, and it was not

so very long ago either, when every room
in Chinatown had a tenant, and some of
them two or three and perhaps four. To
day they are not living that way, as rents
are becoming cheaper, owine to the failing
demand for quarters, and people can afford
to put on a little more style. Some years
ago L attempted to rent a store on Dupont
street, and the agent wanted $150 for it.
Now I can get tne same place for $75.
Chinese merchants tell me that they have
had to g6 out of business because the Chi
nese working men were becoming so
scarce. 1 hear the same complaint all over
the quarter, and there must be a great deal
in it.
"Another sign that I consider the best
evidence of a decided decrease is the fall
ing off of trade at the entrance to the Chi
nese temple. Some years ago the privi
lege of selling wax tapers, idols, blessed
paper and other idolatrous paraphernalia
brought the temple keepers something in
the neighborhood of $5000 a year, but now
it is difficult to get any one to take the
privilege at $1500. This state of affairs
does not arise from the destruction of idol
worship, but from the fact that there are
not so many people engaged in it.
"Take it all in all I think we can at
tribute it /to the exclusion act of 1888,
framed by Scott, and the McCreary act of
1892 authorizing the issuance of certifi
cates. These two acts and their effects
combine to bring about the result that to
day seems to point to a gradual reduction
of the Chinese population of this City.
No one knows it better than the China
man and he i<Â» preparing to move himself
and hi 3 effects to other parts of the coun
try. The exodus has really begun and is
destined to last until most of them are
gone."
This opinion by one of the best authori
ties in San Francisco would seem to bear
out the general impression and eive
Btrength to added information supplied
by Wendell Easton, who says:
"Chinese real estate is tailing in value
all over the section of the City occupied
by them. I have eiven the realty question
in that quarter a great deal of attention of
late and find that white people are gradu
ally crowding the Chinese out of their old
precincts. The putting in of electric-cars
has facilitated travel at that end of
town and people who might have been
ultimately driven out by the China
man have concluded to stay. They
see, as does everybody else, who has
paid any attention to the question, that
the Chinese are preparing to go, and the
result is that white tenants are dictating
prices in the realty market. It is only a
question of time before all of that prop
erty will be occupied by white people,
and during the interval the Chinese are
concentrating themselves nearer the cenr
ter of what is known as Chinatown.
There are a good many influences that
will work to the detriment of the Chinese
in the long run, aÂ«d I think we will see
very few of them here in a few years from
now. They are becoming scarcer all over
the City, and 1 am told that Chinese cooks
are not nearly so plentiful to-day as they
were three or four years ago. This state
of affairs has resulted in a decided raise
in salaries for Chinese domestics, and
those who remain reap the benefit of the
market.
"Another thing that will have con
siderable weight in driving them off their
old streets is the fact of the new City
Prison being prepared for the spot wnere
the old hall stood. That will bring con
siderable business down to that end of
town, and it must necessarily follow that
real estate will pick up. In the meantime
there is nothing particular to keep the
Chinese here, as their support â princi
pally of their own people â is dwindling
away. It is bound to come, and nothing
can stop it. White people are gradually
spreading over the territory, and the
Ceiestiais will in time depart."
Another significant thing is the fact that
many Chinese land-holders are mortgag
ing their property as high as possible
with the intention of forfeiting the mort
gage when it falls due. A financial man
of this City was recently called upon to in
vestigate the financial condition of China
town for the purpose of reporting to cer
tain banking-houses. He recommended
the rejection of all loans on. the ground
that property-owners there were seeking
to secure good mortgages, and then give
the property up to the mortgagees and
join the rest of the tribe who are seeking
new fields.

BIGGEST COPPER BUYER
S. M. Green, the Extensive Oper
ator and Smelter-Owner,
Is in the City.
LOOKING OUT FOX PROPERTIES
He Says Everything Indicates That
This Will Be a Great Year
for Mining Progress.
8. M. Green of Milwaukee, one of the
largest mining operators in the West, and
who buys more copper than any other
man in the United States, is at the Palace.
Mr. Green is president of the Standard
Smelting Company of Durango, Colo., and
has invested $175,000 more in a smelter at
Salt Lake. He is also largely interested
in gold and silver mines near Silverton, at
Cripple Creek and elsewhere.
Mr. Green has came here, as he said yes
terday, in connection with important gold
properties in one of the outlying counties,
but the negotiations have not yet. been
closed.
In regard to the Salt Lake smelter, of
which he was the projector and which
enterprise was not carried to completion,
though $600,000 was put into it, Mr. Green
M. Green of Milwaukee, Now Here, the Heaviest Buyer of Copper in the Country.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist, j
says it will be finished as originally
planned.
"We are just waiting for our people to
get together," he said. "This I think they
will do at an early date, when the smelter
will be thiished and started. It is a good
point for a large enterprise of this kind.
There is an abundance of ore and there is
no reason whatever why it should not be
a success.
"I have not yet been at Cripple Creek,
though I own some interests there. For a
number of years I have been mining near
SilytltOÃ, in the San Juan country, and
other parts of the State. It is surprising
what an amount of gold has been found
there during the past year.
"Gold has been discovered all over.
Every camp has had a renewal of life.
Leadvilie, which was once the greatest
silver camp in the country, is now more
than holding its own as a gold camp.
"The miners there have gone below the
silver ores and found gold. This has been
done in nearly all the old mines. It Is a
cold camp, though the owners of silver
mines are going right along getting out
silver, as formerly
â¢'The indications are that this will be a
good year for mining all over the country.
There is an increased interest in it. :>
Mr. Green has long been a heavy buyer
of ores. For some years he has given par
ticular attention to'copper ores. He bought
and handled a great deal of the product of
the Lake Superior mines, and al?o of those
of Montana and elsewhere. He will be
here several days.
POKER IN THE BARROOM
The Civic Federation Proposes to
Stop the National Game
There.
They Are in Fear That the Recently
Passed Ordinance Contains a
Fatal Flaw.
The Civic Federation and the Chief of
Police are in daily expectation of the sig
nature of Mayor Sutro to the ordinance
recently passed by the Board of Supervi
sors, prohibiting the game of poker in bar
rooms.
Rev. Thomas Filben of the First Metho
dist Church, and chairman of the commit
tee on public morals, connected with the
Civic Federation, has been active in the j
matter of suppressing gambling in any
shape in this City, and he stated yesterday
to a Cam- reporter that he and his asso
ciates were anxious to go ahead ana stop
the evil, but could do notning until their
acts could be sanctioned by law.
"Our position is simply this," he said.
"We want to stop all kinds of gambling,
and will aid the police with our backing in
raiding all the dens of vice in this City. If
the City's officials wiM not go to thefront
and make arrests we will do so ourselves."
Mr. Filben is an enthusiast on this sub
ject. He has spent an evening or two vis
iting the gambling resorts in the tender
loin, and he believes they should be abated.
He is a little dubious, however, as to the
validity or rather the effectiveness of the
ordinance, the wording of which is some
what obscure.
"At all events," the reverend gentleman
stated, **the Civic Federation proposes to
go ahead, make arrests and get a test case
which will decide the validity of the ordi
nance jqst passed, or show its inefficiency.
In the latter case, why, we must look to
come other and better framed ordinance."
In speaking of the poker games Chief
Crowley stated yesterday that he had
already arrested about forty people in one
resort under former ordinances and had
got no satisfaction from the courts. "I
<ion't propose to move now," he said,
"until the Supervisors enact a law nnd
then I will take tne matter in bund. T here
in one. thing, however." added the Chief,
"I would sooner see poker or even faro
banks running open in this City than to
Fee the poolrooms openly conducted. I
positively believe that the poolrooms d o
great deal more harm than any other
gambling games can possibly do."
The men who conduct the poker-rooms
throughout the City and in hotels declare
that they are willing to immediately close
their resorts if the courts decide in a test
case that poker games are. not legal. They
are of tne belief, however, that the inten
tion of the Supervisors is only to prohibit 1
such games as are conducted upcnlr in
barrooms, before the bar proper, and not
in rooms partitioned off for that purpose.

[EMMET ANNIVERSARY.
Elaborate Preparations Being Made for
the Reception of John 11.
Finerty.
The Knights of the Red Branch and
other Irish-American societies are de
termined to make the reception to John
H. Finerty something to be long remem
bered. He is coming to this City to de
liver the oration on the occasion of the
celebration of the one hundred and
eighteenth anniversary of the birth of
Robert Emmet on March 4.
A general meeting of the committee of
arrangements was held in the Knights of
the Red Branch Hall on Saturday night,
when Supervisor King was elected chair
man of the reception committee. It was
arranged that the reception committee,
which consists of T. B. O'Brien, .). J.

is also chairman of the general committee,
should go to Sacramento on the evening
of March 2 to meet the distinguished
visitoi' on his arrivnl there from the East.
The rooms to be occupied by Mr. Fin
erty in the Occidental Hotel will be ap
propriately decorated, and elaborate prep
arations are being made for a banquet in
his honor, far surpassing anything of the
kind ever given by the' societies to a die.
tinguished American citizen. The date
and location for the banquet are not vet

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
DANIELS MAY BE TRIED.
Captain Healy's Accuser Is Said
to Be Mentally Un
balanced.
POOR WHISKY AND QUININE.
A Physician Tells of the Prescription
He Gave the Revenue Com
mander.
A new complexion is given to the Healy
investigation by the startling announce
ment that when the case against the cap
tain is over charges against Lieutenant
Daniels will be taken up. It is understood
that these charges are of a graver nature
than those against the captain, but all
parties concerned are dumb when ques
tioned on the matter. Dr. Bodkin, who is
said to have made the accusation, was
questioned, but refused to say anything
definite. His veiled remarks conveyed
the impression that he considered Daniels
mentally unsound and that some of the
charges were based on that supposition.
Daniels is to be examined by Drs. Blue
and Oakley of the United States Marine
Hospital as to his mental condition, but it
is announced that under no circumstances
will the result of the examination ba made
public.
''Captain Healy made his men toe the
mark," testified Lieutenant Dunwoodieyes
te:duy morning when the investigation
was taken up.
Mr. Dunwoodie further stated that he was
aboard the Bear at the time of the. meet
ing between the captain and Mr. Gray of
the Alaska Commercial Company. Not
being in tne cabin he did not see the cap
tain, but he heard his voice, which was
unduly raised as though he had been
drinking. Tlie witness had been with
Cantain Healy for three years, and said no
competent officer need hpve anything to"
fear from the old coinmauder. He had
never known the service to suffer in the
least through any intemperance or neg
lect of duty on tlie captain's part. He had
had no difficulty with the captain during
vis entire term on the Bear, and had
found him uniformly just and impartial.
Engineer Dorry, the next witness, had
*een the captain apparently under the in
fluence of liquor on the sth, 6th and 7th of
June, 1?95, while the Bear was off Cheri
koff Island, and again during the inter
view with Mr. Gray, on which occasion he
jaid the captain's language was most in
suiting. He could not, however, remem
ber what the language was.
Chief Engineer (Schwartz of the Bear had
frequently seen the captain take a drink,
but never had known of his being under
the influence of liquor. Once, off Cheri
koff Island, the "old man seemed to have
taken all he could stand," but was not
drunk. The witness had never had any
trouble with the captain.
Lieutenant Howard Emery testified that
at various time?, most particularly on the
three days in June mentioned in "the com
plaint, be had seen Captain Heaiy in a
glorious state of exhilaration, which, he
opined, could result only from constant
and ardent devotions at the shrine of Bac
chus. The captain's conduct during the
interview with Gray at Unalaska was, he
said, to the last degree disgraceful, and
most, insulting. He could not recollect his
superior's language on that occasion, but
was certain it was not profane, though
very strong.
Boatswain James Brown of the Bear, the
first witness for the defense, called at the
opening of the afternoon session, said that
Daniels had frequently, in his presence,
alluded to the captain as a "damned old
fool." The witness had never seen Cap
tain Healy intoxicated.
Dr. Thomas P. Bodkin, surgeon of the
Bear, testified that during the vessel's last
trip to Unalaska he had Been treating the
captain for a severe and obstinate pul
monary trouble, the captain's lungs being
more or less consested during the entire
voyage. Captain Healy persisted in going
on deck to superintend the men, which,
the witness believed, retarded his recovery.
Among the remedies which the surgeon
prescribed for his superior were whisky
and quinine. He did not believe the cap
tain took more of the first-named medici
nal agent than he needed. The witness
had the captain under continual observa
tion, being obliged to watch the progress
of his illness from day to day, and at times
hour by hour. He had never seen him in
toxicated.
Dr. Bodkin went on to state that during
the voyage he had occasion to mention the
captain's name in the presence of Lieuten
ant White and that on hearing it the lieu
tenant had devoutly responded. "By God
we'll do him up." At another time White,
referring to the captain's fall from the
wharf at Unalaska, sail: "I wish to God
the had killed himself."
The doctor mentioned White's language
to Daniels, which caused that gentleman
to exclaim "I wish the old fool had broke
his neck," with many profane and nn

complimentary references to the captain's
parentage, religion and nationality.
v\ hen asked whether he had treated the
captain for alcoholism, the doctor replied
that he had not. there being no occasion.
He had treated Daniels for alcoholic gas
' rub and Emery for a trouble of a differ
ent nature, but"his chief employment dvr r
ing the trip was to attend the captain, woo
was constantly getting into trouble with
Ins lungs on account of his rashness In
venturing on deck when he should have
remained in bed.
H. M. Nice of the North American Com
mercial Company recounted the story of
the Unalaska ball and its aftermath,
stating that the captain was undoubtedly
sober during his interview with Mr. Gray
on the Bear.
Richard Keane, ship carpenter on the
Wear, swore that during his entire life he
had never taken a drink of liquor. The
captain, however, occasionally did so, but
never, to the witness' knowledge, to ex
cess. He had been with Captain Healy
three years and three months, and had
found him strict but courteous with his
!"w r m rs * He had heard Daniels say,
Well get him out of the way," re
ferring to the captain, the lieu
tenant s remarks being garnished with
profanity in great profusion. On another
occasion the witness and Daniels were on
the beach at Unalaska, when Daniels be
came confidential, and said he would like
to cet Captains Healv.'Tozier, Smith and
Mungeroutof the way, in order tuat the
young men might have a chance.
Joseph Byrne, a seaman, testified to the
captain's uniform sobriety, and to profane
disrespect toward their commander on the
part of Lieutenants White and Daniels.
Coxswain Herrmann Dunberg and Chris
Hansen, A. P. Hourigan and Chris Jen
s-en, members of the" crew, corroborated
the testimony of Byrne, and said the cap
tain, while strict, was just and impartial.
An adjournment wa3 here taken until
to-day.
STRONG AGAINST FUNDING
Residents of Ashbury Heights
Enter Their. Unamimous
Protest.
They Also Demand That Part of the
Market-Street Car System Fran
chise Be Revoked.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Ash bury Heights and Stauyan-street Im
provement Club was held last evening at
137 Carl street. In the absence of Presi
dent George A. Rankin Vice-President F.
L. Koster presided and A. J. Fritz officiated
as secretary.
The principal business of the meeting
was to hear the report of the legal commit
tee appointed at the la3t meeting to bring
suit against the Market-street cable sys
tem to annul its franchise so far as it calls
for a right of way over the old Metropoli
tan electric system. The president of the
club, also chairman of the committee, not
being present, no report couid be made
excent in an informal way by. Treasurer F.
W. M. Lange, who stated that the suit w.as
bronght one week ago.
The residents of Ashbury Heights are
very much dissatisfied with their streetcar
service. During the Midwinter Fair they
had the Metropolitan Car Company run
ning carÃ every rive minutes durinsr the
day and far into the night. Subsequently,
when the Market-street system embraced
the Metropolitan line, the cars were run
Oi:ly evevy half Hour or not at all, accord
ing to the will oi the railroad company.
The franchise calls for a car to be run
every rifteen minutes from early morning
until midnight and it is the intention or
the club to see that this is done.
Secretary Fritz was instructed to draft
resolutions in behalf of the club strongly
oppt sing the funding bill.
E. M. Fritz, J. W. Hansbrongh and W.
D. Meyer were appointed' a committee to
request the Supervisors to cause the re
moval of the steam car station at Haight
and Stanyan streets.
F. VV. M. Lange, D. L. Westover and J.
D. Cranston were appointed a committee
to. request the Supervisors to order cement
sidewalks on' Cole street between Haight
and Carl.
Hifrtory of Watermarks.
According to Miss E. E. Thoyts, who has
contributed an interesting article on
"Ancient Watermarks" to the Antiquary,
about the earliest date at which they were
used was 1301. The pai>er of the first
books printed in England by Caxton bore
the watermark of a small black 'letter,'
which Was used from the time of Duke
Philip de Romiere in 1349. As the marks
came to distinguish various kinds and size
of paper they soon gave their names to the
kinds of paper, as "foolscap," "pot,"
"post," "hand," and other designations
still familiar. The watermark designating
"foolscap" has been traced back to 1479.

THE COURT OF APPEALS
Nine Decisions Handed Down
the First Day of Its
Session.
SOME INTERESTING CASES.
Questions Affecting Land Titles, Min
ing Rights, Life Insurance and
a State's Power.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals began its session yesterday with a
pretty good day's work. It handed down
nine decisions, some of which are of more
than usual importance.
Probably the most important, from a
local point of view, was that affirming the
judgment of the lower court in the case of
Henry C. Morris against A. G. Johnson
over a portion of school land which the
State had selected in lieu of the sections
set apart for school purposes in the for
feited grant of the Southern Pacitic be
tween Tres Pinos and Huron.
Johnson nad contended in his appeal,
first, that the act of September 29. 1890,
did not restore the forfeited lands to the
United States; second, that the forfeiture
did not enure to California; third, that
the act of February 28, 1891, amending sec
tion 2275 of the Revised Statutes, granting
lieu lands as indemnity for school sections
found to be mineral, did not apply to Cali
fornia; and fourth, that the regular
school sections in question had not been
finally adjudicated by the Land Depart
ment as being mineral in character.
In the grant of July 27, 1866, to the At
lantic and Pacific Railroad, section 18 of
the act, authorizing the Southern Pacific
to connect with the Atlantic and Pacific,
made a similar grant of land to the South
ern Pacific, but required the latter road to
be completed by July 4, 1878. On this last
mentioned date the Southern Pacific had
builded its road as far as from San Jose to
Tres Pinos and from Huron to Goshen
and Mojave, but the portion between Tres
Pinos and Huron, 100 mile 3 in length, was
not completed as required. The grant
along this portion was, therefore, forfeited
by the act of September, 1890, and in the
forfeited land was included section 33,
township 3, range 9 east, Mount Diabio
meridian.
Joaquin Vinagre applied to the Surveyor-
General of the State for the purchase of
this section 33. It had been recommended
by the Surveyor-General to the registrar
of the land office and selected as lieu
school land. The land was sold to Vinagre,
who conveyed it to Morris. Johnson
claimed the land upon the railroad's sup
posed title, and Morris brought suit to re
cover possession.
Judge Morrow, who wrote yesterday's
opinion, held that the surveyor's report,
classifying the regular school lands as
mineral, was conclusive; that the land in
question did belong to the State and that
Morris' title was good.
Considering the big mining suit now on
trial in the United States Circuit Court
before Judge Beatty, namely, that of the
Carson City Mining Company against the
North Star ' Mining Company, and the
claim of extra lateral rights made by the
defendant, the decision in the case of Aus
tin Walrath (appellant) vs. The Champion
Mining Company (appellee), included
among yesterday's batch, has a timely in
terest.
This case was a brilliant success for At
torney Curtis H. Lindley, who is now de
fending the Nortn Star Company. It is
true tiiat the two cases are not parallel,
but the decisidn, which, by the way, Judge
Ross wrote, is favorable so far as it goes
toward the claim of extra lateral rights.
Complainant Walrath and the Cham
pion Minine Company own adjoining
mines in Nevada City. The decree of the
lower court, which was in the Champion
â Company's favor, is considerably modified
by Judge Ross. His words were:
The opinion of the lower court, in so far as it
limits the extra lÃter*l right of the complain
ant to follow the vein calk-d in the record the
backwr central vein in its downward course, is
erroneons.
It Is conceded that whatever right the com
plainant has in or to the ledee in controversy
is derived from the act of May 10, 1872. em
bodied in the Revised Statutes as section 23'J2.
Unless that ledge has its top or apex within
thÂ« lines of the surface of the location of the
Providence claim the complainant has no ex
tra lateral rights to that ledge at all. But that
it does have Its top within the surface lines is
an uucontroverted fact aud was so found and
adjudge! by the court beiow.
The complainant, therefore, has the extra
lateral risht cdnferred by the statute, which is
the right to follow the dip of the ledge in. its
course downward outside of the vertical side
lines of the surface location of the Providence
claim wherever it goes until it comes to the
vertical planes drawn downward through the
end lines of the location continued indefi
nitely in the one direction. Beyond those
points of intersection the extra lateral right
did not go.*
In no case can the extra lateral right of a
first locator in respect to a vein, lode or ledge,
having its top or apex with the lines, be
.bounded by the side lines of the surface loca
tion extended downward or otherwise.
A decision which will greatly interest
insurance companies was rendered in the
case of the Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany, plaintiff in error, vs. Christine
Selb} T , defendant in error, and most in
surance companies may feel inclined to
question the justice of it.
It seems that a soldier on the pension
roll named William Selby insured his life
for $10,000. In his statement to the com
pany's medical examiner he represented
that he had secured a pension on the
ground of general disability, but that he
had no acute or chronic diseases. Inves
tigation of the pension list developed that
he was afflicted witta several acute and
chronic diseases.
The company refused to pay the policy
on the ground that the statements made
by the insured had been false, and that a 9
his false warranties were a part of the
contract, and the company's promise to pay
was based upon tbeir supposed truth as a
condition of the contract, the policy was
actually void.
For some reason or other much of the
evidence which the company offered to
show that Selby had made false statements
was ruled out by the lower court and the
jury returned a verdict favorable to the
Selby claim.
Judge Gilbert, in writing the decision,
admits that questions of fact did not come
up before him for reviewâ only questions
of law â consequently the appeal of the
case was not heard on the real merits of
the facts involved in the controversy,
but as be saw no reason in the questions
of law considered for reversing the judg
ment of the court below he affirmed it.
General Agent A. B. Forbes explainpd
yesterday that nis company would
liever have accepted Selby as a risk had it
been properly informed of his true physi
cal condition, and that in. justice to its
thousands and thousaudsof policy-holders
it stood iipon its right to contest such a
claim, as it could not afford to jeopardize
the interests of its policy-holders by pay
ing claims which are based upon false
representations.
The ris;ht of a State to tax the property
of its citizens on an Indian reservation
was involved in the appeal of County
Treasurer John S. Truscott of Custer
County, Mont., in his case against the
Hurlbut Land and Cattle Company of Illi
nois. The appellate court held that Mon
tana had the right to tax the cattle of the
defendant grazing on the leased Crow In
dian reservation, and that the treaty
rights of the Indians were not impaired in
any way thereby.
Judgment was affirmed in the two cases
of Joseph Naphtaly against Julius Bixby
and Josiah S. Smith. Tne title to a Mex
ican grant of land in Contra Costa Cuunty
had been railed into question. The land
was originally owned by the Romero
brothers.
The court held that the men who had
"jumped" Naphtaly's land were intruders,
and that the court in sustaining Naph
taly's objections to a great deal of im
material documentary evidence produced
by the defendants did not err.
Another land case was that of the
Northern Pacific against James D?lacey.
and the court decided against the railroad
company. Delacey had pre-empted a
piece of land before the general route of
the Northern Pacific had "been made. Ho
contended that his prior claim excluded
it from the company's grant. The ap
pellate court so held and reversed the
court below.
Judgment was affirmed in the replevin
suit of James C. Drake and Samuel Vin
son against the St. Paul, Minneapolis and
Manitoba Railroad Company to recover
two locomotives valued at $10,000.
The appeal of Twymen O. Abbott from
the victory gained by the Government in
the Circuit Court of the Western Division
of Washington (State) failed, and the
judgment was affirmed.
BAENES' ASSAILANT.
He Is John J. Kreiss a Well-Known
Bartender.
John J. Kreiss, bartender for James
Gibbs, was arrested early yesterday morn
ing on Green street by Sergeant Anderson
and Policeman Matthewson and booked on
the charge of assault to murder.
. Kreiss is the man who stabbed Thomas
Barnes, a blacksmith living at 17 Russell
street, in Slavin's saloon on Hyde, and
Broadway Sunday night. He admitted
the crime, but said it was done in self
defense, as Barnes first assaulted binÂ»and
being a much heavier and stronger man he
was afraid of his life. His face and scalp
bear evidence of rough usage. The case
was called in Judge Conlan's court yester
day morning and the Judge fixed Kreiss'
bonds in $10,000.
Barnes is in a critical condition, as the
knife pierced ihe loft lung. He has a pow
erful constitution and the physicians at
the Receiving Hospital are hopeful that it
will pull him through.

DECLARED VOID
Judge Slack's Decision Is in
Favor of the
Heirs.
GOODFELLOW TO APPEAL
The Court Holds That the Trust
Clause Would Lead to
an Absurdity.
THE WILL GOES TO PROBATE.
Validity of the Trusts Concerning
Personal Property Not Involved
in the Decision.
Judge Slack rendered the first big de
cision in the Fair will case yeÃterday morn
ing. In a document of more than 32,000
words Judge Slack ruled that the trust en
acting clause of the will was invalid, be
cause to follow its terms would lead to an
absurdity and defeat the testator's purpose
in framing it.
The trust, as sought to be created by sec
tion 15 of testator's will, was also contrary
to the provisions of section 738 of the Code
of Civil Procedure as amended in 1895, the
court held. As to the contention of Mr.
Goodfellow and his co-trustees and exec
utors that this amendment to the code was
invalid because it had not been passed by
the Legislature in the constitutional man
ner, Judge Slack held, first, that according^
to rulings of the Supreme Court of the
L'nited States legislative journals should
not be examined to ascertain the validity
of the passage of an act, and the enroll
ment ot the act itself was evidence of it
having been properly passed, and, second,
that it did appear that the amendment to
the act had not been passed in an uncon
stitutional manner.
Of course, the effect ot the decision is,
supposing Judge Slack's ruling to be up
held by the Supreme Court on appeal, that
the four trustees named in the will of the
late Senator Fair of September 21,1694,
wiii hereafter have no standing in court in
this issue, and that npon probate of the
will the entire estate will go directly to
the heirs without the intervention of a
trust.
The plaintiffs in the case were prac
tically Charles L. Fair, Hermann Oelrichs
and his wife Theresa A. Oelrichs, and Vir
srinia Fair, being the children of deceased.
These, at least, are the ones to profit di
rectly by the decision, should it be up-.
held in the Supreme Court, though as a
fact Charles L. Fair alone appeared as
plaintiff, and Miss Fair and Mr. and Mrs.
Oelrichs appeared as defendants in the case.
However, the real defendants â those
against whom the great legal battle was
Vongln and ag&inst whom the decision
weighs â were the four trustees named in
the will, W. S. Goodfellow, James S. An
gus, Louis C. Bresse and Thomas G.
Crothers.
When court opened yesterday morning
me entire space- inside the railing was oc
capied even to the point of crowding by
the attorneys and counselors directly or
indirectly to be affected by the decision
promised at that hour. Tne principal con
testants in the great case were represented
as follows:
Messrs. Knight & Heggerty, Garber,
Boalt. Bisbop & Wheeler, and Wilson 4
Wilson for the plaintiff.
Messrs. Pierson & Mitchell for the de
fendants James S. Angus, Loui3 C.
Bresse and Thomas G. Crothers.
Garret W. McEnerney for the defendant
W. 8. GoodfelioT.
Messrs. Lloyd <fc Wood for the defend
ants Hermann Oelrichs, Theresa A. Oel
richs and Virginia Fair.
John A. Percy for certain beneficiaries .
Messrs. Rodgers & Paterson for certain
beneficiaries.
Frank P. Deering, Esq., smicus curia.
Aside from these there were a number of
other interested well-known attorneys
within the inclosure, of which the following
is nearly a complete list: E. J. Pringle,
8. K. Thornton. Guy C. Earl, John E.
Richards, Van R. Paterson, Horace G.
Platt, Fisher Ames, Donzeli Stoney, J, T.
Tyler, William P. Lawlor, John Flournoy,
WilJiam Rix, Alexander Heyneinann,
John 0. Byrne, Jo ri A. Percy, William
G. Grant, Lester Jacobs, James L. Kobin
ton, Herbert Choynski, Frank M. Stone.
The Rev. Father Mulligan, secretary to
the Archbishop, was also an interested
listener. Seldom, if ever before in this
City, has the reading oi an opinion by a
Superior Judge beeu listened t> as ap
preciatively and by so learned and dis
tinguished an audience.
Judge Slack did not read (he entire de

more hours than there are in a court day,

JUDGE SLACK'S DECISION.
Main Points In the Lengthy Docu-
ment Upon Which the Find
ings Were Based.
To quote"- 1 Judge { Slack's decision in full
would take pages of The Call, even
thougli set in the smallest'type.; The fol
lowing excerpts will -be found to contain
at least the consecutive argument, though
in a much abbreviated form and with most
o! the numerous authorities cited omitted:
The action' is in form suit to quiet title,
but its objects, dii-giiised as they may be, are to
obtain a construction and to determine, the
valMity.br rather invalidity, of the trusts con.
talned in the fifteenth paragraph of an. alleged
will of James G. Eair, deceased, dated Septem
ber2l,iÃ94. 'Â :-: -â >:;;:*' 1
It 1b contended; on \bebalf of the plaintiff,
that thisf action can be maintain^ upon .the
general principles of equity Jurisprudence, in
dependently of any recent express statutory
authorization. ! There are tw > answers to ! this
position : first, the will is unprobated and the
action i*, theielore, premature; and, ri second,'
the plaintiff is asserting a claim against the
executors and trustee* , in. opposition to the
will.' wfcy<&aiwa^ffl<|^njg(TQafft";.'^Jft^Jilji p_h*T
Even U the will were admitted to probate, it
would be necessary for the plaintiff in this
State to show some special and extraordinary,
leason in order to justify an applicarlon to a
court of equity ' for the constraction Â« of * the
will. In Siddall vs. Harrison, 73 Cal; 500. an
action was broujjht by.thu heirs at law against
the executors, for the purpose of declaring cer
ain legacies glvenby'the will to be void, and !
hence to establish the rights of the plaintiffs, i
as heirs, to the property, embraced in the be- >
quests. The Supreme ' Court, by \ Mr. Justice '
Temple, in determining; that the action could
not be maintained, said : . v
I am convinced the Jurisdiction ogght not to be i
excrcUed unless some cood reason is given for I
thus inierferinj* with a matter pending in anotner !
court, Jhe iuconvenlence may be very great.
â  It is not denied that the Legislature may, if
it sees fit to doso, confer jurisdiction upon a
court of equity to construe an unproi.ated
â will, at the suit of an heir at law claiming. in
antagonism to the will, and the plaintiff, in
fact, mainly relies for the bupport of. this ac- i
tion upon such a legislative. authorization. I
Section 733 of the Code of Civil Procedure as j
amended in 1895. â¢ * â¢
The wisdom of such legislation, which is j
opposed to the scheme of â¢ the pro bale law as it j
exists in this State, may well be doubted; If j
an action is brought under the statute for the
construction of a will in the- court in which an j
application for tne probate of the will is pend- i
ing, the discretion which the court unques j
tlonably possesses to proceed cither firsl with
the application for probate or with the action j
for the construction of -. the will should, under i
ordinary circumstances, be exercised against i
the suit. -Such o course would -least- interfere
wish settled practice, and the court, in tiie i
probate proceedings, could as well construe the |
will after its admission to probate as could be :
done in the action brought, for the express i
purpose of obtaiuing a construction.. The ar- |
Kumtntthat if a favorable construction of the
Will can be secured a contest of the will may,
thereby be avoided, possesses little weight. ]
It savors too much of a request to permit specu- |
lation upon possible results tobeoJ great force. !
. Were it not for the fact, in this case, that j
three of the four trustees have urged the prose- ;
cution of the, action to construe the will, and :
that already much time has been consumed '
und labor expended, there would be liule liesi- i
tancy iv requiring the probate proceedings to j
go ou to k hearing, instead of determining the i
questions presented iv this action for the cou- i
struction 01- the will. Â â  â¢;"â¢;,
The plaintiff, as has been said, must rest his
case upon the amended section of the Code of !
Procedure above quoted, v The defendants, tha i
trustees, contend that the amendment to the i
original section, beginning j. wit hi the words j
"provided, however," was never pasted by the
Legislature, inasmach as a majority of the
members elected to the Senate never concurred
in the amendment, as an inspection of the jour
nals of the two houses will demonstrate. If it
is the right and the duty of the court to go be
hind the enrolled, authenticated and approved
bill in the office of the Secretary of Stat*-, and
to inspect the journals of the "Legislature to
ascertain whether or . not the amendment
was passed, by a constitutional majority of the
members elected, and ii it- should appear from j
the journals that such was not the fact, then i
the .amendment must be declared invalid and I
the plaintiff's case must fall. The plaintiff af- i
firms, .first, - that the enrolled, authenticated
and approved bill is conclusive .and that its
passage, in accordance; with the provisions of
the constitution, cannot be contradicted by j
the journals; .and, second, that if resort may |
be had to the journals the journals will show
that the amendment was validly passed, or;
father, the journals will not show that it was
nnt passed: The trustees, on the other hand, j
maintain that resort -may be had to the jour
nals for the purpose of impeaching the bill,
and if the journals be examined they will es
tablish' that . the amendment never received
the concurrence of a constitutional majority
of the members of â each house of thÂ« Legis
lature. ' ' â¢" "â¢ . â 
The trustees principally rely, in support of
their contention, upon sections 10 and 15 of
article IV of the constitution, which provides I
that each house of the Legislature shall keep a
journal of its proceedings, aud that upon the
final passage of bills the vote shall be by yeaa
and nays, and shall be entered on the jdurnal.
and no bill shall "become a law without the
concurrence â¢of a' majority of the members
elected to each house. The argument is that
the constitution having required the houses of
tne Legislature to keep journals oi their pro
ceedings, and to enter thereon the yeas and
nays on the final passage of all bills, thereby
makes the journal's records, which must show
that the vote upon final passage was by yeas
â¢ and nays, and that the bill w.as passed by the
constitutional majority, and if these facts. do
not affirmatively appear, .the act must be pro
nounced invalid. The argument is supported
by a number of Cases, where : the journals are
silent as to* the yeas and nays, no presumption
being indulged in that the bill passedby the
required majority. * * * ' \
But if the journals are to be examined in
disproof of the existence of an act of the Legis
lature in-all matters iv thq passage of the act
which they may recite, yet it is uniformly held
that the journals must clearly and convincing
ly show that the act was not passed at all, or
not passed in the manner required by the con
stitution, and tliat everyre'asonable "presump
tion is to be indulged in to uphold the act, and
if it b3 at nil doubtiul whether or not the act
was passed, or passed according lo the consti
tutional requirements, the act must be sus-'
tamed. â¢ V* â¢ ' - :â¢
The rule that resort may be nad to the jour
nals to ascertain whether or not a statute has
been passed by the Legislature has been con
demned in a number of the States the consti
tution of which", similarly to the constitution
of this State, provide that In certain case.*
entries of the legislative "proceedings shall be
made on the journals, a rule wholly unnec
essary and most mischievous and disastrous' iv
its results. In these States the enrolled bill in
the office of the Secretary of the State , authen
ticated by the officers of the Legislature | and
approved by the Governor, is conclusive as to
Its regular and valid enactment. * * â¢.Â«â .â¢
And this rule has received the sanction of
the Supreme Court of the United States under
both the United States constitution and the
organic ect of the Territory of New Mexico.

. But, it is said that the California codes
authorize a resort to. the journals "and plnce
the journals upon the same footing as the stat
utes themselves, and in support of this posi
tion the railroad tax CM, 8 Saw. 238,294; is
referred to. The op.inion in that case on this
point might have some weight were it not for
the fact that one. of the sections .of the Code of
Procedure referred to is materially, misquoted,
and no mention whatever is made of otber sec
tions. The truth is that the codes do uot pro
vide that the journals maybe used ior the
purpose of impeaching a statute, or - even that
they snail evidence the existence of a statute.
Section 1887, C. C, says that "Writings are of
two kinds:" â¢.*â¢â¢... 'â â Â " â¢ .
â¢ Applying the foregoing results to the facts of
this case, the conclusion in the first place is
that the journals should not be resorted to for
the purpose of impeaching the amendment to
the section of "the code under consideration,
but that the act as enrolled, authenticated and
approved is conclusive that it was regular iy
adopted by the Legislature. In the second
place, it is concluded that if the journals may
be examined at all for the purpose oi ascertain
ing whether or not the | amendment I received
the concurrence; of the majority .of the
members elected to each house ot the Legisla- '
ture, on its final pas^a 1 ge t by a vote of the ayes
and noes entered on the journals. In other
words, if the journals show that noon the final
passage of the bill, as the term "final passage"
is to be understood, the bill' was concurred in
by the constitutional majority, by. a vote of
ayes and noes entered upon the journals, then
ihe act is to be sustained, whatever el6e other
iournal entries may show. As It appears to
have been the fact that the amendment did re
ceive such concurrence the act must be upheld.

'. If the court were permitted to resort to evi
dence outside of trie journals, or even indulge
in inferences of fact from the Jouruals them
selves, uncontrolled by contrary, presumptions
in favor oi the regularity of legislative action,
probably a dilt'erent result would be reached;
but such a result is not possible under the law,
which seeks to'sustain the enrolled, authenti-"
cated and Approved bill as, a valid enactment.
Hence in every possible view of the law which
may be taken the amendment to the section In
question must be upheld. â '.'â¢;. . :
The technical objections to the maintenance
of the section being thus disposed of. ttie mir
its of tne controversy, the validity or invalid
ity of trusts, are to be determined. - In thisdis-'
Ciissioh the trusts will be takunasdealing with
real property only. V" Any inquiiy into the
legality of the trusts, in so far as they.- concern
the residuary personal estate, is .beyond'- the
scope of>he present litigation. The : principal '
provisions of the Civil f Code of this State
which are ; involved in < the ; solution of the :
questions, and which are to be first considered,
are Fections 847, 857, 803 and iHHi. * * * ;,.

time of the son for the; benefit of persons not'
necessarily minors,' and as such a direction for
accumulation is not jpermitted'under the laws
of this State the direction is void. (C. C., sec
tion 723). This result seems, bowever,"to be of
no consequence in this case if the ultimate
limitation of -: the "future r interest under i the
first .'part of : the . paragraph .be â  valid, for. the

I is not so much that it constitutes an essential
part of a general scheme of the testator tor
! the disposition vof the ' residue :of his i estate
failing with the destruction of an Integral por
i tion that scheme as that to preserve -it will
lead to an absurd and impossible result, which
I the testator could not have contemplated nor
intended in the event that the finalUrust
should become inoperative. For if the trust be
upheld, the testator has virtually devised the
land to trustees for the benefit of his children
for. life, remainder to the children in fee when
the survivor of them is dead. Such a conse
t quence cannot be justified by any presumed
intention of the testator, and" hence the prece
dent trust of the income must fall with the
ultimate trust to transfer and convey. 'â¢'" â

the trust renders it really unnecessary toijon
stder the plaintiff's further contention nhat

j GOODFELLOW SURPRISED.
â i â :
He Says the Decision Was Based
on a Simple Phraseology In
the Will.
W. S. Goodfellow when seen at San
: Rafael yesterday afternoon had heard of
the decisicn only by telephone.
"The decision comes in the nature of a
surprise to me," said he. "It isentirely dif
ferent from what we anticipated. Whether
an appeal will be taken or not I cannot
say definitely as the matter is wholly in
| the hands of my attorney, Mr. McEnerney.
j However, I think the case will be ap
pealed.
"The whole ground of the Judge's de
cision may be resolved down to a simple
phraseology in the will. Had it read that
the children's children would be entitled
to the property on the death of the present
I heirs the will would have stooti, but on
â  the wording that the trustees shall con
| vey the property to the grandchildren on
the'death of the children the Jud^co bases
his decision. We believe that the pro
visions of the will in'effect were that on
the death of the children the property
! would come iuto the possession of their
I children.
"The Judge holds that giving the trus
tees the obligation of conveyancing the
property to the issue of the "chiibren on
their death is not provided for in the code.
I We consider this as inconsequential. '
''We never believed in the trust as being
a perpetual trust, but believed that on the
death of the children our trusteeship
would cease. We hold that it was the in
tention of the testator m place the prop
erty in our hands for the benefit of the
children ?o lone as they lived, but, as I
sail before, in the event of theirdcath we
would have no mere connection with it.
j The decision was an nonest decision, but
I not a just one from the facts as they
1 exist."
Garret McEnerney, representing Good
| fellow, stated there would- be an appeal.
j He said that if the decision should be bus-
I tajnea the children of James G. Fair
! would take the estate as if there were no
j trust clause.
j Charles J. Hejrgerty, the attorney for
Charles Fair, was enthusiastic over the
victory. "We shall now proceed," he said,
I "to probaie the will without the trust
i clause, and if it shall be admitted to pro-
I bate the estate uill be distributed directly
j to the children."
Robert B. Mitchell said: "This decision
means that the will shall stand without
; the trust clause, and that the trustees shall
| hold the property pending distribution as
j special administrators instead ot aa
i trustees. Ifhink the opinion is the most
I learned document ever handed down by a
| nisi priOs court. It bears evidence of
great deliberation and profound thought,
aud I am confident it will stand."
LANDED IN SAN QUENTIN
Jerry Bruggy Has Reached Here
Safely From Santa
Barbara.
He Is Brother of a Santa Rosa Mur
derer Who Escaped and Is
Still at Large.
Deputy Sheriff J. F. Walsh of Santa Bar
bara County is in this City, after a rather
exciting trip from the sunny south in com
pany with Jerry Bruegy, convicted of as
sault to murder, whotu he safely delivered
to the San Quentin authorities on Satur
day. Bruggy will be remembered as the
man who shot his employer on a ranch in
Santa Maria some months ago, and seri
ously wounded him, simply because the
man would not get off a tree quick enough
to suit the fancy of the would-be assassin.
Fourteen years' imprisonment was the
sentence imposed op Bruggy by j^ie Sape
! rior Court, and to serve that sentence Mr.
| Walsh escorted him to the penitentiary.
: Every precaution to prevent the prisoners
escape was taken, lor he was known to be
a desperate character, with a long criminal
record. An Oregon boot ornamented one
of his pedal exiremitiea and jliackles un
well as handcuffs were adjusted. Never
theless he. with an extreme bravado, an
nounced, beiore his departure for a north
ern prison, tUat he would be able to maKe
Ins Â»â¢ scape before he was turned over to the
tender care of Warden Hale.
Deputy Walsh knew of this and closely
watched his charge, beinÂ« rewarded at the
start with the discovery of two tiles Brug.y
had concealed in the" lining of his coat.
They were, of course, immediately con
tiscated. During the trip, in .-ome manner
unexplained, the prisoner managed to
divest himself of the 18-pound Oregon boot,
and when his custodian found him minus
this appendage. he laughingly said: "You
don't know how I got this off and you
never will find it out."
A close watch was kept over him after
this and he was not able to play any more
tricks on Walsh, who was determined to
take no chances with a man so desperate.
It was one of Brugpy's schemes that as a
last chance he would brain Walsh with his
handcuffs and jump overboard on the
Tiburon boat on his way to San Quentin.
To prevent this Walsh telegraphed anend
to his friend George Jennings, now in thu-
City, and the latter met the party as it
arrived on the boat from the south and
accompanied it to Sao Quemin as an
assistant to the Santa Barbara deputy.
Bruggy is a brother of the much-dis
cussed Santa Rosa murderer, who, on the
eve of going to the scaffold quite recently,
escaped being hanged.

FATHER TURK'S
FIRM STAND.
The Chancellor Discusses
the "Infallibility of
the Pope."
HIS GREAT ELOaTJENCE.
For Over Two Hours He Holds
the Attention of His
Hearers.
THOUSANDS TUKNED AWAY.
The Claims of the Catholic Church
Brilliantly Championed by
the Priest.
When Father Yorke stepped on the plat
form at Metropolitan Temple last night he
was greeted â with tremendous applause by
the great audience ttiat had gathered to
hear him lecture on the "Infallibility of
the Pope."
There was a tremendous crowd at the
temple. Every seat was occupied and the
aisles and corridors were crowded. Ad
mission was by ticket ajid several thousand
peopie were turned away.
The audience that Kistened to the dis
tinguished speaker was most enthusiastic
and at times the. popular feeling ran very
high.
The platform of the temj)le was deco
rated wiih National colors, ferns and
flowers. Prominent clergymen of the
Catholic church, men prominent in busi
ness affairs, legislators, lawyers and phy
sicians occupied seats on the platform.
When the brilliant young Chancellor
was introduced he received an ovation
that touched his heart. The applause
and cheering continued for over a minute,
and through the discourse the feelings of
the audience were expressed in frequent
storms of hand-clapping.
A large force oÂ» polioe was present to
handle the immense crowds that clamored
ior admission to the hall.
Father Yorke spoke for two hours and a
half. He was in splendid voice and his
words were uttered with great force and
eloquence. He said:
Ladies and gentlemen: The subject of my
lecture this evening is Uip infallibility of the
Tope. Like all the dogmas of the Catholic
church, this one has been misrepresented. In
deed, there are few non-Catholics who have
< < rr -it ideas of what it means. My object to
night will be to explain the doetrineas clearly
as I can, to set before you the chief reasons
which support it, and to consider its bearings
on that ailegiance which we owe the Kepublic
and which we give in as full measure and as
freely and unreservedly as any other denom
ination i:i the land.
Kach of these points, you will readily ob
serve, would iurnish sufficient material for a
very long lecture, "i uu need not be afraid that
1 intend to inflict upon you three k-ctures in
one. It is true I have been accused of ver
bosity and longwinciedness, ana half a dozen
other disagreeable things, but. I always re
mark that they who accuse me are not sparing
of their words. Still this evening Ido not in
tend to try you beyond your strength. There
is a. limit to human endurance, and I am afraid
that limit is nearly reached now. Therefore
this evening I will barely ou-tline the argu
ment you will find developed in Catholic books
of instruction. All who take an interest in
these matters should go to the documents in
which Catholics express their own belief. It is
only a certain kind ot pseudo-scholarship
which contents itself with fourth-hand in
formation. It I hear stories or complaints
about my neighbor. I do not go prowling round
the block interviewing all the old women
about his character. If I respect him and wish
him well and am anxious to know the truth I
go to him like a man and put the question to
him face to face. No one lias a right to judge
of the teachings of a religious body by the in
terpretations of its enemies. The Catholic
church is not a secret society. She
is not an affair of yesterday. The
greatest minds in the world have believed
in her doctrine and have set it forth in writing.
The shelves of the libraries of Christendom
groan with the learned labors of her sons. It
is easy to find out what she believes. She
courts investigation. And if there be any one
here to-night who cares to study this subject
of infallibility or any other doctrine of the
church let me *ay to them that there are thou
panas of books at your disposal which will ex
plain and will defend it. There is not a priest
in this City who is not only able but willing to
assist you to reach those books. We do not
parade the town boasting of our scholarship,
but we claim to know our own business. We
believe and we are proud to proclaim our be
lief that God's church is as the light which
should not be concealed under the bushel; that
she is as the city seated upon the mountain
top which cannot be hid.
Many of you ladies and gentlemen remember
the outcry which was made over a quarter of a
century ago when it was proposed in the Vati
can Council to define the doctrine of Papal in
fallibility. The wise men of the period prophe-
Bied all kinds of trouble, but the church was
not afraid. Those who are familiar with her
history know of her splendid courage. She be
lieves that she possesses the truth and she is
not afraid to say what the truth is. From the
earliest times when question arose about the
extent of dogmas and about their rela
tions one to another or to human
science; when men and nations were divided
in opinion, then the church spoke. It did not
matter that heretics shook the dust from their
feet and went out from her. It did not matter
that whole nations threw off her yoke and set
tled into schism. It did not matter that em
perors and kings smote the chief pastor and
harassed the flock. Line a mother her soul
yearned after her rebellious children and her
heart was sore for the faithful slain before her
eyes. Still she could not keep silent. She has
been set for a sign and a testimony unto the
truth and speak she must. Greater than
princes, kings, nations, aye, greater than the
blood of her bravest and her best is that of
which she is the witnessâ the truth of the liv
ing God.
And so in oar generation, ladies and gentle
men, when the need arose she proclaimed the
truth as it is in Christ Jesus. The need came
from the logical development of thought since
the Reformation. You know that in the six
teenth century the reformers went out of the
catholic church to found churches of their
own. They abated to the Bible as the sole
and supremo judge in matters of religion nnd
rejectea tne authority of the Pope. You all
know, too, what the result was. They divided
Into numerous sects, each heartily hating the
other and united only in their common hos
tility to Rome. As lone as the chief Protestant
churches were state churches and were pro
tected by law, and as long as conformity
with their teachings was enforced by fines',
imprisonment, stripes and death, a "certain
pc rijianency was assured them. But during
this nineteenth ceutury the old penal laws
hove been Tepealed. The bond between church
nnd yta-te has grown much weaker, and, as a
consequence, Protestantism' has had full scope
to go to its logical extreme. At first it pro
tested against the church, then it protested
aeainst the Bible, soon it protested against
Christ and finally it protested against (iod. 1
do not say these things to offend the feelings
of Protestants or to imply that all Protestants
reject the Bible or Christ or God. I merely
wish to draw your attention to the fact that
the original protest against the church has
produced all these other protests. J wish to
make clear that a system which is based ution
protest only must end by protesting against
everything. I do not mean to say that every
man or every woman runs through the whole
gamut of protests. We are not altogether
governed by logic, but m the long run logic
tells. From the denial of the church to the
denial of God is a straignt road and though va
rious bodies of men have chosen to camp at
Various points intermediate between the two
â¢xtremes their choice does not disprove the
existence of the road. The Episcopalians pro
test against the Pope and they march along
the road and settle down at thÂ£ first milestone.
The Presbyterians protest against the Pope
and against the Episcopalians an<i settle down
at the second milestone. The Congregational
isis protest against the Pope, prelacy and the
prc-bvtery and settle down at the third mile
stone. The Baptists protest against Popo. prel
acy, presbytery and infant baptism and they
settle down at the fourth milestone. The Uni
tarians protest against Pope, prelacy, presby
tery, congregation, baptism and Jesus Christ,
and they settle down at the fifth milestone.
Colonel Bob Ingersoll protests against Pope,
presbytery, prelacy, congregation, iufant dam
nation, baptism, Christ and the Bible, and he
sits down with bia legs dangling 1 over the abyss
and laughs the whole procession to scorn. Be
sides the sects here mentioned, thereare others
encamped at almost every intermediate stage
of the road between the Pope and infidelity.
So you see, ladies and eentiemen, that I did
not exaggerate when I said that a system of
religion based upon protest must logically end
by protesting against everything.
Now 1 do not make these reirfarks to attack
or annoy Protestants. God forbid. I simply
state them as facts which Protestants them
selves acknowledge and as facts in which many
of them glory. We Catholics have no attack
to make upon Protestan-ts. We believe In our
own religion, we believe that it is the best re
ligion, but we do not go around abusing the
religion of our neighbors. I do not think,
ladies and gentlemen, that we can be justly
charged with stirring up religious disserfsion
in this community. It is true that the San
Francisco Chronicle has charged us with this
crime and me in particular. That paDer has
for two years printed everything to make
Catholics odious to the people oi this State
and still continues to print it. When
we asked for space to defend ourselves to speak
a word for the loyalty of Catholic men and the
honor of Catholic women that poor privilege
was denied, and is still denied us. Protestants |
as well as Catholics repudiate, such tactics as |
these. And now when we have an opportunity
to speak for ourselves, the editor of that paper
lifts up his hypocritical hands in horror and
deprecates religious controversy. When his
disingenuous plea wasfdisregarded he commit
ted a crime oil the uoodnameof this-City by
printing a fake story that Catholics had at
tacked a Protestant churcii. That story tfas
ialse from start to finish, and no one was' more
energetic in asserting its falsity than the pas
tor of ihe church himself, Dr. : Bovard. He Is
a Protestant minister, and has no leanings
toward Catholicism, but he is too much of a
gentleman to descend to the tactics of John P. ,
Young. '
No, ladies and gentlemen, it is. far from my
intention or the intention of any Catholic iD

[From father Yorke's address last evening at Metropolitan Temple.]
this town to attack or annoy our Protestant I
fellow-citizens. Since the foundations of this
City we have lived in peace and harmonvand
we are the last to wish to break the tradition of
peace and harmony now. But there is no
lair-minded Protestant in San Francisco to-day
who does not approve of our policy in defend
ing ourselves. When Catholic priests take to
the platform and begin to slander Protestant
women .by raking up old scandals against
Protestant churches and to advocate the ex
clusion of Protestant men from office because
their fathers persecuted our fathers, then it will
be time for the respectable element of this City
to cry halt'to the Catholics. But if such a time
should ever come that any misguided
Catholic priest or layman should embark
on such a career of slander then
there will be found none more anxious to
crush out such a crusade than the Catholics
of San Francisco. But as long as we act on
the defensive and protect our honor and the
honor of those who are near and dear to us we
are not to be cowed nor yet to be (silenced be
cause a newspaper is afraid of losing a few
nickels. The millionaire patrons of that jour
nal may noi feel the necessity of our course,
but the poor, the workingman who has been
thrown out of employment, the girls who have
seen their positions jeopardized by the de
mands of a gang of foreign conspirators, they
feel it; and to them and to all true Americans
I appeal to-night to judge between the Chroni
cle and me.
Hence, ladies and gentlemen, when I speak
of Protestantism and the doctrines of Protest
antism let me not be considered as making an
attack on our separated brethren. Though we
worship at different shrines tney are still our
brethren, and we have no right "to insult the
belief of any honest man.
It is true I have been accused In the public
prints of not saying nice things about them.
[Laughter and appluuse], I have been told that
the whole Protestant world in San Francisco
has its mouth wide open for the nice sweet
things I would put down that mouth. But
deeds speak more than words. When the time
comes that we can go to the Protestant and
say, "You are a nice loyal man," and then
stick him with a dagger; when the time comes
that, like the snake, we are to smooth over our
victims with saliva, then it will be time for me
to waste. my time with saying nice things about
Protestants, which they don't want and which
would be valueless to them and to any other
honest man.
But what I wish to draw your attention to
this evening is the fact that the result of the
Protestant Reformation was a church divided
in many parts.
This is a very peculiar thingâ that all
Protestant churches believe in the right of
private Judgment; believe that a man should
have an open Bible and that he should search
it intelligently and should draw his own re
ligion therefrom.
The result of all this has been to make men
indifferent. Sensible men who have made a suc
cess of business and who think lor themselves
look upon all these churches which contra
dict each other and they come to the conclu
sion that either thÂ°y are all farse or that one
religion is as good as the other. No country
has shown this tendency more than our own.
Out of our population of 65,000,000 people
about 45,000,000 do not pretend to belong to
any church. Only 20,000,000 are members of
churches in the United States, and half of
these are Catholics.
So in looking to see what has been the re
sult of private judgment and an open Bible
we hnd that out of a population of 50,000,000
which should be Protestants by descent or
training only 10,000.000 of thorn believe in
the dogmas of the churches of our fathers.
As a matter of fact, all over these United
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
States to-dayâ and this is also true of Europeâ
the old idea of revelation is practically dead.
Men seem to have forgotten i:i the strife of
sect the right idea of religion. It was to meet
this idea that religion was nothing but a mat
ter of man's "speculation, and that there was
no such thing as a speakinglof God to man,
that a Vatican council was held some twenty
five years ago.
As I told you, the churches are witnesses to
the trutn. Peter's rock stands as a watch
tower. The sentinel looks out over the world
looks out upon the race of men. He knows
which way the current sets, and so it was that
when, in our generation, he saw this tide
of indifference sweeping things ftway from
the faith, he warned the world against
this tendency. It was nothing to him that
contradictory voices were raised up against
nim. He was set upon the watch-tower to do
God's work, and he should do it as his prede
cessors did before him.
When air the nations of the earth were wan
dering irom the true faith there was no fear in
the breast of the Pope. He called to Rome 700
or 800. Bishops, who. gathered around him.
They spoke with the wisdom of the Holy
Ghost to proclaim to the world that there was
a revelation from God to man, and that that
revelation was true and infallible.
What is meant by revelation? From the
earliest times men have asked what is truth.
And in their hurry to give h reply they have
missed the answer. We are like men sitting in
a room. We neas noises outside, and we ask
what are these noises. Each may explain the
noise differently,. giving his best sense of the
sound as it strikes his ear. But one comes in
from the outside and can tell you what are
the noises, for he comes from where they
originated. You believe this one man against
all the many conjectures that have been made.
One is faith ; one is reason. Without raith, one
man thinks the noise comes from a tramcar,
another believes it to have originated from a
peddler's wagon, another thinks it was some
thing else. Which are you to believe? It so
happens that all are wrong, but you only dis
cover this by. faithâ from the man who comes
in from the scone of the noise.
In this world we are shut in. â¢ imprisoned
within our five senses, as an audience iii this
hall. We only know by the five senses. Now,
by the senses* we can perceive many things.
By belief we know most, however. All of us
have laith. We all believe there is a land

Christ came to iound a church. He speaks
of it as a sheepfold, as a city, and as in various
ways, but always as a body, as a society. His
mission was but brief ' in . years and it f was
necessary, that he should organize some society
to carry on the work when he was departed.

one among you for^whom I have prayed and
who shall be set above you all to keep your
feet in the true path."
That one who had to rally the routed-army
oi Christ, who was given full authority, who
was set above all, was Simon Peter, prince of
the Apostles. This was not the first time
Christ had spoken to them. When Christ es
tablished this little society he did not tell
them all at once Mho he was. They were
ignorant men, and he taught them
slowly. He let the light in upon their mind
carefully. When Christ passed through Gali
lee some said he was John the Baptist, others
Elias and others Jeremiah. So toward the
close of his life Christ gathered about, him his
disciples and inquired of them: "Whom do
men E ay I am?" and they answered
him that some declared him to be
John the Baptist and Elias and so on. And he
asked them: "And whom do you think I am?"
and Simon Peter said: "Thou art the Christ,
the son of the living God." Then our
â¢Lord -said: "Blessed art thou. Simon, and I
say unto thee that thou art a rock
and upon this rock I shall build my church,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it. And to thee I will give the keys of the
Kingdom of heaven and what thou shalt loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven, and what
thou shalt Dind on earth shall be bound in
heaven."
If those Words mean nothing then they are
tne.mo.st misleading everj>enned by man. They
imply tl\at Christ was to build a society that
tne_ very gates of hell should not prevail
against. How was he to make it strong and firm?
Just like the architect who goes down to the
rock tv begin his structure. So it was with
Christ. He went down to the rock, and that
rock was Peter. He wanted to found an or
ganization that would carry on his teachings
for all time. All the old philosophers who
founded schools saw them split up in sects.
And so it is with all human societies.
Christ had to face the difficulty of leaving his
truth in the hands of men and he did not in
tend that the new society should split up as
do all human schools of thought. In order to
preserve his church 'as oiie and make it last
until the end ot time as the repository of
his truth, he founded it on a rock,
which is St. Peter. You will discover how this
nas worked out in history. Every sect that
separated from the rock of Peter has split into
smaller fragments.
There are in the United States alone 242 re
ligious sects. There is only one church that
has remained one, and that church is founded
and rests on the rock of Peter

him. But we do not hold him infallible even
in the^e matters.
But between God and man's conscience
neither Pope nor priest can come, and the
Catholic church itself teaches this great truth.
If our conscience tehs-us this line of action is
right, or that line ol action is right, though it
carry us in the fat of the Pope, that is the
Catholic conscience, we are moral cowards if
we hesitate. ' .
There are those who would bind us over
hand and /oot to the state! What is the state?
What is a State? Turkey is a State, Armenia is
a state [applause] and in a very bad state, at
LllÂ£lt.
Those men who talk about a state do not
know what a state means. When the state in
Turkey goes out into the mountains and
shiughters the Armenians are they obliged to
bend their necks and receive the blow? So.
According to the Catholic theory of conscience,
they would betray the reason which God gave
to them if they were to follow out this idea.
The authority of the Pope has nothing to do
witn our civil allegiance. We are as undi
vided as any other class. For nearly three
months certain persons in this community
have been endeavoring to find some Drools
against the loyalty, of Catholics and
though we have a history of 120 years in this
country they have not found a Catholic
traitor. Surely, if what they say about us
were true they could at least produce a Bene
dict Arnold. One of our opponents the other
day said of one of the soldiers of the
lAvil War, and one whose name we cannot
hear without cheering, that if on the
day General Sheridan [cheers] was sweeping
down the Shenandoah, if a Catholic priest had
put-up a. crucitix before him he would have
turned back. Well, I happened to be reading
"Memoirs of General Sheridan" at the time,
and I found that when he was riding to relieve
the army he met a clergyman on the road.
He was not a Catholic clergyman, either. He
was the parson who was chaplain to the regi
ment. The general asked him where he was
going; but he only cried out "Things will be
all right, General,, when you tfet there," and
the parson continued his forced marchâ to the
rear.". [Laughter and applause.]
If there had been a traitor among us our ene
mies would have found us opt.
If we have liberty we owe it to the old
church. When the barbarians swept
down on civilization and buried it
the Popes .went out to meet the
enemy and finally conquered, and they sent
out missionaries to teach them. There is not'a
liberty for which the Popes have not fought.
The history of the papacy is a glorious one.
No one can look upon that long procession of
old men, strong and vigorous, standing up for
God's truth for 1900 years, without feeling
his heart throb. Nothing has ever been
seen like it in the world. They had neither
wealth nor arms to support them and yet they
ruled the world. The last of them sits a pris
oner iv the Vaticanâ the aped and Illustrious
Lto XIII. [Great applause.]
They say that with our idea of the Papacy
we can have no allegiance to this, our coun
try. Yet Leo XIII has fearlessly said to the
people of Europe: "Look at the constitution of
the United States. There is your model. [Pro
longed cheers.] They tell us that the Papacy
is failing. It would seem otherwise.
When we look at the condition of the world
to-day, we find those not of the old church
tossed about on the seas of uncertainty. Still
the rock of Peter is firm. For 2000 years it has
remained unshaken by the storms. The empire
of Rome thought to sweep it away in a torrent
of blood. Where is the empire to-day? Where
is the church? The barbarians swept down
upon her, but she rose nrore glorious than be
fore, and to-day she stands before the world un
scarred and unscathed by the stormt of centu
ries.

PIETRO GORI, ANARCHIST.
Arrival in This City of an Ora
tor Who Has Attracted
Attention.
He Will Preach His Peculiar Doc
trines Before the Italian
Colony.
Pietro Oori, a well-known attorney, who
has attracted a great deal of attention by
reason of his utterances that border on
anarch ism, arrived in this City last Sun
day, and he proposes to, in the near
future, address the people of* this City on
the subject of the doctrines he advocates,
which are more than socialistic.
Gori is well known to the Italians of
this City and other parts of the world by
the beautiful sentimental poem addressed
to his mother on the eve of his departure
for America. While there are' many who
are not in sympathy with the ideas he ad
vances, "they," said a prominent Italian,
"will go to hear him, for he is an eloquent
and forcible speaker."
Pietro Gori was born in Messina in 1869,
his family being quite prominent. His
father was colonel of an artillery regiment.
In 1886 he entered tte University of Pisa,
and it was not ions before his socialistic
ideas drew the attention of those around
to him. In the contest for the crown of
laurels he presented, a forcible and bril
liant thesis on "Misery and Crime."
When he graduated he went to Milan,
where he entered the law office of Filippo
Plctro Gori.

Turati. In the great metropolis of Lom
bardi he soon acquired fame as an orator
arid he was listened to with marked atten
tion by all classe.3, who were charmed by
the simple yet sincere language he used.
He, however, soon advocated his pe
culiar doctrines and thus drew the atten
tion of the Government officials 10 him,
and to avoid arrest and a term within the
walls of a prison he left the country and
went to the canton of Ticino in Switzer
land, but there he met with no better re
ception from that Government than he had
in the country he had left, and he was
driven out of the Swiss republic. He
went to Germany, to Belgium, to
England, and finally to Holland,
where he shipped as a common
sailor and after a long voyage
reached the United States and located in
Paterson, N. J. He shortly after his ar
rival gave expression to his views and it
was not long before he founded an anarchist
journal. He went to New York ana from
there started on a tour of many cities of
the United States and some in Canada.
He was in West Hoboken, Oran?e Valley,

TO GET BACK THE LAND
Civil Suit Arising Out of the
Old Redwood King
Frauds.
ACTION BEGAN YESTERDAY.
Special Attorney Bergen's Bill to Re
cover $1,000,000 Worth of Hum
boldt County Land.
As a sequel to the old Redwood King
timber land frauds suit in equity was
brought by the Government yesterday in
the United States Circuit Court to" set
aside the 168 patents to timber land claims
in Humboldt County, which King, his
associate, Evans, and their company of
Scotch capitalists secured between Novem
ber, 1882, and August. 1883.
A bill was filed by Attorney Benjamin
F. Bergen under the title of The United
States of America vs. The American Lum
ber Company and the Central Trust Com
pany. Mr. Bergen, who came to the coast
in 1885 as special agent for the Land De
partment and who succeeded in prevent
ing the patentine of about 250 claims be
tween that year and 1890, and worked up
the criminal cases against King, Evans,
Walker and tiieir two sub-agents, or
"rustlers." Beach and Marks, was ap
pointed special United States attorney
last June to prosecute the big action he
has just begun. The land, he says,
amounts to between 26,000 and 27,000 acres
of the finest redwood timber, valued at
nearly $1,000,000.
Altogether ovrr 400 entries were made
through the King-Evans- Walker combina
tion on the choicest quarter-sections of the
belt. They extended from Trinidad to the
Klamath River.
To do this a syndicate was formed Octo
ber 21, 1882, at Edinburgh, Scotland, com
posed of Charles H. King, now of East
Oakland. David Evans of Eureka. H. C. Put
nam of Eau Claire, Wis., James D. Walker,
Thomas Nelson, William J. Menzifts, J. D.
Lawrie, R. Bruce Johnston, J. Campbell
Pennie, D. Forbes Dallas and others, and
the language of Mr. Bergen's document
charges these gentlemen with having com
bined to acquire large tracts of land by
means of fraudulent entries for the timber
thereon and for speculative purposes. The
400 and more entries covered about 75,000
acres and the entries were made under the
act of June 3, 1878. For awhile the syndi
cate was known as the California Redwood
Company, but finally, in July, 1888, it was
incorporated as the American Lumber
Company.
It was necessary to have the land located
in an apparently regular manner. King
and Evans were made managing directors,
and Charles E. Beach and Harry C.
Marks, as sub-agents, contracted to find for
them what locations were needed. Beach
and Marks had an obscure office in
Eureka, and the men necessary to locate
the land were found. The locations were
duly made, the entries recorded at the
land office there, and "mense convey
ances" were executed by the locators to
Agent Evans of the company for a consid
eration of $50 each.
Beach and Marks were successful "rust
lers" and had little trouble in securing
over 400 men, who for $50 each would go
through the form of making the entries.
It soon became known among the irre
sponsibles who constitute the floating
population of any place of consequence
that a man could make $50 very easily â
that all he hadto do was to" sign a blank
enny, acknowledge it before a notary
public, execute a deed "to the company aud
draw his money.
The office had a big supply of all the
requisite blank papers on hand. F. W.
Bell was the notary public before whom
the locators all went, and there were six
men who, under the pay of the company,
acted as regular witnesses when the entries
were filed in the land office. These six
men were W. P. McCormick, James iVlc-
Cormick. James Gregory, O. A. Homer,
George Lewis and William Wriirht. They
did all the swearing required and Receiver
Solomon Cooper and Register Charles F.
Roberts accepted everything, apparently,
as a matter of course. The deeds to the
company were all drawn up by one man
(David Cutten), under a contract made
with Evans. At that time it was not
necessary under the law for the man mak
ing the entry to appear personally in the
land office.
Truly a "land office business" was done
by Beach and Marks. They made.as many
as eighty-two entries In one day without
the Registrar and Receiver appearing to
suspect anything. The witnesses were
paid $3 every time they put down their
name, and the scheme proved highly
lucrative to everybody concerned.
Then came the expose. Beach, Marks,
Evans, Walker, King, Joseph Russ and
M. E. Roberts, a brother of the Registrar,
were all indicted in course of time. Beach
was convicted and sentenced to pay $3000
tine and to serve three years' imprison
ment. He asked for a new trial, and is
now at large under $25,000 bonds. Marks'
case did not come to a trial, and the in
dictments against Evans, Walker, King
and the others were quashed. As already
stated, Mr. Bergen prevented 250 patents
from being issued, and now brings suit to
have the 108 patents secured set aside and
the land thrown open for settlement. He
alleges in his bill of complaint that the
applications and their accompanying affi
davits were false because not made in
good faith.
The Central Trust Company of New York
is made a party respondent because the
American Lumber Company a year after
its incorporation bonded its land thus ob
tained possession of to the Central Trust
Company for $300,000. It gave its trust
deed to the Central Trust Company De
cember 21, 1889.
Tuere may be some difficulty in winning
this case because the Government will
have to run' up against the prevailing doc
trine of the Federal courts that a patent is
conclusive evidence of the facts that were
supposed to have warranwd its issuance.
The Government will have to show that
the patents were obtained by fraud.
After the redwood land frauds had been
perpetrated under his- regime Register
Roberts became Collector of Customs,
FOREIGN GAME AND FISH
Thousands of Trout Eggs That
Arrived in Splendid
Order.
What Commissioner Babcock Says of
the Pheasants Liberated Near
Folsom.
Chief Deputy Fish and Game Commis
sioner â¢ Babcock said yesterday that of
the several consignments of eyed fish eggs
the State Commission has received, the
lot that recently arrived from the State of
New York was the most perfect in every
detail.
"The several thousand eggs of the
brown trout that journeyed across the
continent to their destination at Sissons "
said Mr. Babcock, "arrived in -magnifi
cent condition. They were packed by
some one who certainly understood
hia business, as only a comparatively
small number of the eggs perished before
the consignment was received by the chief
deputy of the Sissons hatchery. The eggs
although not as large, are of a more lumin
ous color than those of the rainbow. I
think that the brown trout will prove a
great acquisition to the fishing interests of
this State.
"We are now pretty well supplied with
trout of many varieties. Two years ago
we received from the United States Fish
Commission at Washington a consign
ment of eggs of the Loch Leven trout,
and it would have greatly pleased you to
see the little fellows, which are now about
eight inches in length, enjoying them
selves in the small lake in which they are
placed. They are fed twice or three times
a week through holes cut in the ice, and
next spring some of them will be liberated
in streams adjacent to the hatchery.
"Before the cold weather arrived I con
cluded to try the game qualities of the
little fellows, and placing a cast of small
flies on a leaderâ of course, the barbs of
the hooks were broken â I made a cast
over a spot where the Junior Lochlevenites
were congregated. The water actually
boiled when the flies landed. I think the
entire school made a dasn for the artificial
lure. Anyhow, I caught three, one on
each fly, which, of course, were immedi
ately returned to their element. I am
satisfied that the Loch Leven trout will,
as a game fish, more than please the
wishes of the most fastidious of anglers.
"Of the trout family we now have on this
coast the steelhead or rairbow, golden,
dolly varden, cutthroat, New Hampshire,
brown and Loch Leven. This is an excel
lent variety and in a few years hence the
lovers of trout-fishine will have sport i ;ir
excellence within a day's journey from
this City.
"The pickerel which were planted in
some of the lakes in Southern California
are doing splendidly and the commission
will stock Clear Lake, which is in Lake
County, with a number of those lighting
fishes in the spring of the year. The pick
erel is a splendid food fish, being large of
bone and winged in such a manner as to
â  give it great power and speed. Those
fishes will aid to a great extent in ridding
Clear Lake of its most undesirable inhab
itant, the German carp.
"Departing from the fish question 1 am
pleased to be in a position to say that the
Mongolian pheasants which were planted
in the vicinity of Folsora are getting along
first class, and* the residents are sanguine
that, in a few years, they will have multi
plied to such an extent as to afford grand
sport to those who have a predilection for
shooting.
"Referring to the statement that poach
ers have been killing steelheads in Lagu
nitas Creek, in Marin County, and the
Sonoma Creek, in the vicinity of Glen
Ellen, you can say that deputies will be
instructed to patrol those streams until the
opening of the trout-fishing season in
April, and the Commissioners propose to
teach those trangresscjrs of the fish laws a
lesson this year which they will not very
readily forget."
CHEFS IN NEW TOEK.
They Are Generally Persons of Con-
sideration.
Cooks were men of high pay and much
distinction in old Greek days, and they
have come to be persons of consideration
in modern New York. When a man
lunching at a club the other day found a
particular dish especially to his taste he
asked with some hesitation whether the
cook could be persuaded to reveal the
secret of its coiiDosition. The head waiter
thought he might and undertook- to be the
diplomatic intermediary between the din
ing-room and the kitchen. There came in
reply an inquiry from the gentleman below
stairs as to whether the gentleman above
stairs could read French, and when this
query had been answered in the affirma
tive, there came from the nether region
the recipe, neatly written and well ex
pressed in that language, upon the note
paper of the club. The club member sent
his respects and acknowledgments to the
invisible potentate of the kitchen, and
thus an agreeable incident came to an end.
Nearly all clubs and considerable hotels
have French cooks, male, of course,
though it is usual in small clubs to employ
as second cook a woman. The cbef in Â»
large club has as many assistants as lie
demands, and is a personage of the high
est consideration, well paid, much deferred
to, and, as far as possible, conciliated.
Cooks maintain ancient reputa
tion for ill temper, and the com
pany in the luncheon - room of a
Fifth - avenue ciub was startled one
day to see some sort of kitchen underling
burst into the apartment, actively pur
sued by the raging cook, butcher-knife in
hand, oent upon doing execution upon the
frightened offender. A good club cook
costs from $750 to $1200 a year, and tnere
are some who receive much higher salaries.
One finds in some of the smaller French
restaurants a woman cook, perhaps the
wife of the proprietor, a tireless creature,
who labors late and early, and manages
by her peculiar gift to confer a special
reputation upon the place. A wife such
as that is an unspeakable treasure to any
restaurant-keeper, for not only does she
do the work of a skilled and well-paid
man, and keep it up for twice as many
hours as he can be induced to stay in the
kitchen, but, above all, the cooks that are
at the same time wives, whatever their
peculiar traits, and however ill their tem
pers, do not "give notice." The services
of such a wife can hardly be valued in
money, and widowed indeed is the man
that loses her.
A pleasing feature of a reasturant that
has now,- alas, deserted the old French
quarter for the new was the occasional
presence of the cook, clad all in white, his
paper hat on his head, in the dining
room among the guests. He knew
some of the regular patrons, and
it was his custom to honor one or
another by taking a seat at his side
and entering into conversation. The
chef in most clubs, hotels and restaurants
is an object of awe to all his fellow-serv
ants, if, indeed, the cook may, even by
implication, be called a. servant. His
moods are watched, his moments of rage
are indulged. The waiter that must carry
to the kitchen a dish that has been re
jected in the dining-room sneaks in
with fear and trembling and endeavors
to propitiate him whose art has been
called in question. The cook comes in for
a Jarge share of the Christmas box at every
club. Though he may be unknown by
sight to any member of the cluo, and ;i
stranger even to the House Committee, he
is Known by his deeds and he stands firmly
for all his rights and privileges. To dis
miss so great a man is a duty that few care
to take upon themselves, and to admonish
him is the most delicate and diplomatic of
tasks.â -The Sun.

ESBERG, BACHMAN & CO., Wboletalart.DR. BROWN TALKS
OF HIS FRIENDS
Hundreds of Letters Full of
Sympathy and Con
fidence.
HOPEFUL OF THE FUTURE
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper Thinks the
Church Will Ultimately
Divide.
ANOTHEB LETTER OF PROTEST.
An Exciting Time Is Promised at the
Regular Wednesday Night
Prayer-Meeting.
Dr. Brown does not indorse the method
adopted by Mrs. Cooper in the matter of
giving to the public letters supporting the
position she has assumed.
"VVnile he does not think this the proper
thing to do UDder the circumstances, he
has not one word of "censure for the woman
whose determined stand has brought no
end of trouble to him.
Ever since this unfortunate scandal was
brought to the attention of the public
through the arrest of Mrs. Davidson, now
nearly five weeks ago, Dr. Brown has been
the recipient of hundreds of letters full of
v sympathy, love and confidence. ' With ex
treme reluctance and against the original
advice of hia wifeâ though later on she
agreed â the pastor consented yesterday to
the publication of some of the letters.
"I am opposed, heartily so, to giving
out these letters," said the pastor yester
day. 'It seems a childish thing to do,
/ though this statement is made with no
reference whatever to Mrs. Cooper. It is
her unquestioned right to do as she thinks
best, and I also reserve the same for my
self.
"In that desk just behind you are two
or three hundred letters, which have come
to me since the arrest of Airs. Davidson,
and the charges have been preferred
against me. Twenty-eight States arejrep
resented in that pile of letters, -and it
makes me feel good to know that my
friends still have faith in me. At the
proper time it will be shown that it is
not misplaced.
"Just back of you are the letters I refer
to. You will find more than 200 there.
Read and copy such as you like. Pick
them at random or take them one by one.
You will rind them all the sameâ simply
expressions of confidence and sympathy."
The following letters, selected from the
piie at random, are fair samples of the
whole. The first is from a Los Angeles at
torney and reads as follows:
Los Angeles, Cal.. Jan. 26, 1806.
Rev. C. 0. Brounâ MvDeab Friend: Of course
I have not hesitated to declare my belief in
your innocence of the charges made.
I hope you may soon see clouds roll away.
â \Vjih .kind regards to Mrs. Brown â  and much
Â«yÂ»ip*tllj\ â. â¢ .-. -- - ,- Walter Uobdwell.. Â
The next letter given here is from a gen
tleman well known in this City, but his
name is not given, because Dr. Brown
thints it better to withold it. It reads:
College Park, Cal., Feb. 2, 1896.
My Dear Dr. Brown: I greatly desire to see
you and take you by the nand and tell you I
am your friend. You will come out of this
terrible ordeal as clear as the sunlight at mid
day. We don't believe you are guilty of any
misdoing, but that you are the victim of a
conspiracy started by Mrs. Davidson, and
backed up by the enemips of religion and by
those Christians who, if they would take the
example of the Divine Master, would certainly
wait, as recommended by the joint committee.
I am sorry for what Mrs. Cooper has done.
She has simply added fuel to the fire, which
would have smoldered until the time came
for you to make your statement As ever,
your friend, .
The editor of the Advance, a Congrega
tional publication circulating throughout
America, writes as follows:
Chicago, 111., Jan. 2, 1896.
Rev. C. 0. Brown, D.D.â Dear Brother: Allow
us to assure you of o.ur confidence and svm
pftthy in the painful trial you have been called
upon to meet. Such afflictions are among the
fortunately infrequent penalties of eminent
services, but these whom you have served so
Mt.il trust you and suffer with you. Sincerely
yours, The Advance.
"Take all you want," said Dr. Brown
when tbe reporter had satisfied himseJf as
to tbe genuineness of the letters. "It
would take some time to copy more, how
ever, and what you have are sufficient to
show the tenor of them all."
"Id it true, Dr. Brown, that when the
Bay Association committee called on you
for the evidence which you claim will es
tablish your innocence, you refused
to give it up?" was asked.
"No, it is not," he answered. "Such a
statement as that is unqualifiedly false.
I was ready to make my statement a week
ago to-day, and so told them. They
called at my house during the day and
informed me of what the public is now
aware, that they did not think it wise to
prosecute the investigation at that time.
It was & surprise to me, but I cauld do
nothing less than submit."
"Is it your intention to lead the prayer
meeting next Wednesday night?"
"Well, I cannot say at this time. In
fact I have given the matter but little
thought as yet."
Dr. Brown courteously but firmly refused
to discuss in any way the charzes that
Lave been made against him. "Do not
ask me to do that which you kt.ow my
attorneys have forbidden," he said, and
with that the matter was dropped.
The following letter relating to Mrs.
Davidson's Eastern career has just been
received by Mrs. Brown and explains itself:
Washington, D. C, j
Y. M. Christian Home, Jan. 4, 1896.)
Mrs. C. O. Brown: The article was received
by me, sent from Boston, with regard to the
blackmailing ot your husband by Mrs. Mary A.
Davidson, formerly of Boston.
I think her smooth tongue capable of ac
complishing most anything she attempts.
The wrong I suffered through her oily tongue
under the cloak of religion was In .a business
way, but my lawyers Were too smart for her to
carry it on "long, and I was cleared of her at
once. The shock was so great to me it teems
1 can never get over it.
She (Mrs. Davidson) was to buy my business.
I will not go into details, as it is too much for
me to even thiuk about now.'
I ftel that I have done wrong in not reveal
ing her true character after she left Boston to
some one th3re, as many of my friends 68id she
will get hold of some one there before they find
her out. Ido hope that Mrs. Davidson will get
her just dues, and the next time she gets be
hind the bars it will be for life. Mrs. Davidson
and ruyself were members of the same church
and in the same class in Sabbath-school. When
her true character was exposed to me and the
dreadful things she had done, claiming to oe a
m Christian woman, it was a great strain on my
system, from which I may never recover. I
came South for my health, and have just re
turned to Washington, D. C, from Atlanta, Ga.,
where I received this article. It is no surprise
. to me, as I think Mr*. Davidson capable of do-
ing anything for money.
I want her to suffer for ihc wrongs she has
done me, and no doubt Mr. Marville, whose
name you sec on this card, feels the Mine way
toward the woman, at whose hands he, too,
has suffered. * â¢ â¢ I will soon leave for my

MR.BARNARD'S RESOLUTION
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper Thinks It Will
Causa a Division In the
Church.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper has two letters in
her possession which ehe will not give to
the public until they are brought before
the council. Those letters are supposed to
have a direct bearing on the relationship
existing between the Rev. C. O. Brown
and Miss Mattie o"erman, as well as the
correspondence that passed between them.
"I am determined not to give those let
ters to the public, until the council meets,"
she said yesterday afternoon. "It would
not be right. There is justice in all things
and an exception should not be made to
whet the appetite of the curious public.
Mr 3. â  Cooper, though apparently fa
tigued by her labors at a- meeting from
which she had but just returned, was
willing to discuss the sensational condi
tion of affairs in the First Congregational
Church, and by way of introduction the
resolution to be presented at the church
meeting to-morrow night was made the
subject of conversation.
That this resolution will cause a division
in the church there can be little doubt,
according to Mrs. Cooper.
"It is ambiguous, to say the least," she
said, as she brought forth a copy of the
collection of sentences. "In the first
clause it sets forth that we withhold judg
ment, or suspend final opinion, until the
investigation has dispelled or confirmed
suspicion (that being 'understood), and in
the next clause explicit confidence is ex
pressed in the integrity and morality of
the pastor.
"When this resolution is brought be
fore the church meeting the intelligent
members of the congregation cannot fail
to note the ambiguity. We are called on
to suspend judgment, and yet enunciate
our belief in the pastor's uprightness and
so on. I am free to say that to my mind
the resolution is either the result of most
careless construction or "
"Possibly a purpose," Miss Cooper in
terposed.
"It is incomprehensible," continued Mrs.
Cooper, "and will call for a decided di
vision."
The conversation then reverted to the
sensational meeting at which hisses were
mingled with plaudits when Mrs. Cooper
addressed a portion of Dr. Brown's con
gregation, and that lady spoke in the
kindliest terms of Dr. Brown's son, who is
said to have started the hissing.
"I cannot find it in my heart to blame
the boy," she said, "though he miirht
have expressed his fiiial feelings in a dif
ferent way "
"It does not speak well for his. bringing
up," interpolated Miss Cooper.
"No," continued the mother, "I would
not have felt unkindly toward the lad if
he had come up to me and said, 'I hate
you,' but I had to do what my conscience
dictated. The church is greater than the
individual."
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
The Minutes of the Bay Association
Not Fully Understood by
the Members.
There seems to be considerable doubt as
to what the future action of the Bay Asso
ciation committee appointed to investi
gate the charges against Dr. Brown will
be. It cannot adjourn before April 13,
when the association holds its next meet
ing. In the meantime they have the au
thority to resume the investigation at any
tune they see proper.
The right of the committee to investi
gate Dr. Brown is a mooted question with
Dr. Pond. That gentleman declares that
tlie minutes, as prepared by Rev. Mr.
Tubbs, are entirely incorrect. He does not
accuse him of falsifying the records, but
he does say that Mr. Tubbs has a very
mistaken idea of wbat actually trans
pired. Dr. Pond, however, does not ven
ture an opinion as to what the accused
pastor reaiiy intended when he appeared
before the Bay Association.
"Mr. Tubbs is certainly wrong in his
minutes," he said yesterday. "I cannot
for the life of me understand how he could
have made such a mistake. It looks very
much as if they were specially prepared.
The committee found objections to pro
ceeding with the investigation and so they
made their report, expressing confidence in
the integrity of the pastor and formally
dissolved. There is the whole thing in a
nutshell, and that is all I care to say about
it."
Dr. Williams seems to take a different
view of the matter from his brother
members.
"There is no question at all but that the
committee had and still has full power to
investigate the charges against Dr. Brown.
The minutes are correct and they certainly
tell their own story. Candidly speaking,
I do not anticipate any further action by
the Bay Association committee. No meet
ings have been or will be held until after
the prayer meeting Wednesday night and
not then unless the charges resting against
Mrs. Stockton should be pressed to an
issue. If that should be done, then in all
probability tbe committee will be forced
to take some action. I, for one, however,
will make no move in that direction.".
"Is it true, Dr. Williams, that when the
committee asked Dr. Brown to produce the
evidence of his innocence he flatly re
fused to do so, and that too without offer
ing any good explanation?" was asked.
"Well, that is a question I must posi
tively refuse to answer," he replied, and
that was as far as he would discuss the
matter.
THE WEEKLY MEETING.
The Indications Now Point to a
Lively Session â Counter
Resolutions.
The prayer meeting to-morrow night
promises to be lively in more ways than
one. If Dr. Brown leads, or attempts to,
there are those who stoutly declare that
they will practically break up tbe gather
ing.
In spite of the statements of Deacons
Barnard and Dexter ihat the charges
against Mrs. Stockton would not be inves
tigated at that time, the author of the
request, Dr. Warren, is equally sure that
they will be promptly and properly inves
tigated.
Then there are the resolutions of confi
dence offered by Deacon Barnard at the
last meeting. That seems to be the rock
upon which the congregation will divide,
if it does at all. A few leaders of the church,
representing they claim over half the mem
bers, will be on hand with a set of con
demnatory resolutions, in which among
other things the demand will be made that .
the pastor's alleged misconduct be sub
jected to a thorough and immediate in
vestigation.
"The disaffection of Mrs. Cooper," said
a prominent member yesterday, "who con
trols fifty or more votes, and the Christian
Endeavorers, who- are very strong, practi
cally seals the doom of Dr.. Brown. I can
didly think that all he is fighting for now
is a letter of recommendation. If he can
get that I think he will be willing to step
down and out. Just think of Mrs. Coop
er's influence alone. On Sunday last she
had 119 in her class, while there were only
sixty-one in the Sunday-school below."
This last statement is emphatically
denied by both Dt. Brown and the secre
tary of the Sunday-school. The latter says
that in Mrs. Cooper's- room there were
eighty or ninety people, while in the Sun
day-schcol proper there were nearly 200.
A LETTER OF PROTEST.
Mrs. A. E. Dooley Szanlk Defends
Her Pastor.
The following letter, written by a mem
ber of the Young People's Christian En
deavor Society of the First Congregational
Church, was received by the City Editor of
The Call yesterday morning:
Editor Call: Will you please insert this little
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4. 1896.
.notice for me In justice to our Society of
Christian Endeavor?
It Is true that there are a certain
few, whose grievances I do not know, who
oppose our pastor, but we the majority do
not care to be classed among those, who in
Deing so openly in opposition know not the
harm they are doing.
If you could see how the best people In the
First Congregational Church crowd around
the beloved pastor, and with what joy his
presence is received by the best people of his
riock (and those not of his flock) you would
wonder how any one with the least sense of
honor or justice could send or give, or cause
to be given, any misleading notices.
The Christian Endeavor Society met and our
beloved pastor addressed us, and there was no
division in the society.
â \Ve are only waiting a little to see our be
loved pastor cleared from the slanderous re
ports. We all, that is the greater portion of
the Christian Endeavor Society, stand wiih
him-, for we know right is might and he is sure
to come out unsullied. Sincerely yours,
A. E. Dooley Szamk.
As the above communication openly and
directly conveys the impression that the
statements published 1 to the effect that
there was a division of r opinion among the
members of ;â¢. the Young People's Christian
Endeavor ; Society about the Rev. .C. ;-;â ' 0.
Brown were v without foundation, if not
absolutely : false, the matter was laid be
fore Secretary J. F. Mason,' accompanied
by a request for his official and individual
opinion.- .:'â¢*â  ' \ . :^1
He smiled when the contents of the letter
were made known to him. He tapped his
forehead â significantly. v
"Of course," he ; began, "you must re
ceive many communications of that kind.
As to there being no division of sentiment,
why it i$ all nonsense. A lar^e majority
of the members of the society were ' op
posed to Dr. Brown occupying the pulpit
until the â¢ cloud of suspicion has been
lifted. â  :.v ' â¢ " ' . [-:{\J-H 'â â  '.
'â¢That, I think, was clearly.shown by the
fact ihat when the doctor made known his
intention not to occupy the pulpit those
who had temporarily withdrawn from the
society came back at once. - â 
"As to euch enthusiastic members as '
Mrs. A. E. Dooley Szanik all that can be
said might better be left unsaid. While |
there was no direct ' declaration made
referrible to the guilt or innocence of the
pastor the members were very outspoken
concerning the propriety of his occupying
his pulpit until the charges have been
thoroughly : investigated. : I cannot say
that the division of * sentiment has any
thing to do with the belief of the members
in Dr. Brown's innocence or. guilt; lean
only speak for myself. ' ', " . 'Â»:; ''
"Yes, I have an opinion, but you must
know bow one feels about expressing one's
self an affair of this kind. It is not.
based on the evidence : so ' far brought
forth, but on incidents * and occurrences
within my own knowledge. . However, I
am like all the otner members of the so
ciety; my judgment is held suspen
sion.. ; But as to the propriety of Dr.
Brown's preaching in the church ; until
after his case has been thoroughly investi
gated, there can be but one. reasonable
opinion." -",. ,-. y^r -.- ,-V .. -: - .

MRS. DAVIDSON HOPEFUL.
She Thinks Dr. Brown Is Shewing
His Hand Undeniably.
Attorney "Walter Gallagher was asked
yesterday if he had any idea when the in
formation would be hied against his client,
.Mrs. Davidson. He said:
It must be within the next seven days or not
at all at tliis time.
The information must be filed within thirty
days of the time the defendant is detained in
custody, and that must be by the 10th of the
present month.
Wbat is the reason for the delay? Well, I
suppose it Is due to the bulk of matter the
stenographer had to transcribe and prepare
for the prosecution. I can see no other reason.
Mrs. Davidson is cheerful under her restraint
and says she is confident the public can see
that Dr. Brown is showing his hand more and
more every day. As the case continues, it be
comes more apparent to her, as it ha 6 to oth
ers, that her arrest and incarceration are not the
result of Dr. Brown's wish or intent. He was
forced into the position he now occupies,
partly by circumstances and nartly through a
subtle purpose on the part of the Police and
Detective departments, as I intimated some
time ago.
The joint committee c onsulted the heads of
the Police Department, and the arrest of my
client was decided upon. The deacons con
curred in the views of the officials, and, of
court-e, Dr. Brown could not back: down then,
though he did not. perceive the joker which
was up certain sleeves.
. The duplicity of the man is shown in more
ways than one. When Dr. Brown was trying
to hush up the Stockton affair he went' to a
tenant of mine at 10 ALvarado street, in the
Mission. His name is Unsworth, and he is
with the Associated Press. Dr. Brown asked
him to keep the story from being sent broad
cast, and as an inducement assured Mr. Uns
worth that it would not appear in any of the
San Francisco papers.
"It appeared in one of the papers, as you are
aware, and in violation of a sacred promise.
An evening paper complains of the same false
faith. A scoop was promised, and 10, and be
hold, all the morning dailies had the same
story in advance of the date.
"If the case is carried to the Superior Court,
I shall askâ and have no fear of refusalâ that
the door shall be opened to admit of all evi
dence bearing on the several charges of Im
morality, bribery and blackmail brought dur
ing theprogress of the case. If those doors are
shut justice cannot be done.
The pastor's attorneys have been unsuccess
ful in proving that Mrs. Davidson was impris
oned for a felony, and a glaring inconsistency
was developed in the accusations of the attor
neys that she had not been employed by disin
teiested parties.
GREAT CHESS PLAYERS.
A Young American Boy Who Â£cltpses
Paul Morphy.
Paul Morphy reigned in the chess world
from 1854 to 1860. He was only 35 years of
age when he died, and to those who know
the intensity of intellectual work required
for championship chess it will not sound
surprising to record that be flickered out
with a diseased brain. It would be strange
if it were otherwise. Gray jnatter becomes
tired as well as muscular tissue. But in
his day he was phenomenal. He was the
first man to play chess blindfolded, meet
ing in this darkened contest from six to
eight opponents at one time. One who has
not witnessed this feat cannot appreciate
its marvelous character.
The blindfolded contestant sits far away
from the table of his antagonist and carry
ing in his mind the positions of every
piece upon the checkered square, meets
move alter move, when inarmed of it
without seeing either piece or table. To
do that he must have photographed upon
his brain every table upon which he is mak
ing battle. The next man to accomplish
this feat was Ziikertort, a German, who
played blindfolded at one time sixteen sep
arate games, and the estimate in which
this feat was held was displayed by the
fact that by special solicitation it was done
in the presence of Queen Victoria; the
Prince of Wales and all the other members
of the royal house of Great Britain. That
is now outdone by Pillsbury, the American
boy.
What Sisyphus Complained Of.!
Sisyphus was busily engaged in rolling
the stone up to the top of the hill, and
finding it slide back again. "It's pretty
monotonous, isn't it?" remarked one of
his acquaintances. "Yes; but I could get
used to it. I could get along very well if
it wasn't for people who come along and
make remarks. I guess about 700 people a
month tell me 'never to mind; life always
has its ups and downs.' And not less
tfian twenty a day ask me if I don't know
that a rolling stone gathers no moss." â
Washington Star.
The parchments and papyrus used by the
ancients seem to have had a special prepa
ration, by virtue of which they absorbed
tbe ink and caused the writing to be al
most indelible.
The Sultan of Turkey is enabled to buy
new bonnets for the ladies of his harem
frequently, as his daily income is Â£4000.
A Canal Choked Up
Ts practically useless. The human organism is
provided with a canal which sometimes becomes
choked up, namely, the bowels, through which
much of the effete and waste matter of the system
escapes. Wheivthc-y are obstructedâ constiputed,
in other words â Hosteller's Stomach Bitters will
relieve them effectually, but without pain, and in
stitute a regular habit of body. This medicine also
remedies malarial, bilious, dyspeptic, rheumatic,
nervous and UHney trouble, and strengthens the
entire system.

; Victoria
:
evidently hoped to seÂ« Logan finish in
front, but the big coin favored Thornhill
with his ninety-seven pounds in the
saddle, and at poet time the bald-faced
horse was a6to 5 favorite. At one time
as good as 2 to 1, Logan closed at 8 to 5.
The race was Thornhill's from the jump.
Tod Sloan Bet sail for the lead to get the
good going, which he secured, and never
dangerously pressed, passed the judges
two lengths in advance of Logan, who had
held second position throughout the run
ning. Gilead was a poor third. Sir Wal
ter and Moderocio, the other starters, cut
but slight figure in the race.
The attendance was only fair, and spec
ulation was but lightly indulged in on the
different events. Favorites captured three
races.
As usual. Realization was a decidedly
warm favorite for the opening rive-furlong
dash, 6 to 5 being accepted as a eood price.
He led throughout and woa with nothing
to spare, a length in front of Pecksniff,
against whom 20 to 1 was laid.
The next event, over Eeven furlongs, was
exclusively for three-year-old fillies. The
knowning ones thought the distance in fa
vor of Barney Schreiber's entry, Theresia.
and she was made a 4 to 5 chance. Easel
was proninent to the stretch, where
Coady, on the second choice, Summertime,
let out a wrap, and, taking the lead, won
easily, three lengths before the favorite.
If it is the glorious uncertainties of the
game that make racing so attractive, it is
rendered doubly so by runniug over the
inside course with its sharp turns. All
Over was heavily backed at 7 to 5 to pull
off the seven-furlong run, but getting shut
off, was unable to even show. Backed
from fours down to 2% and 3 to 1, Perseua
made a fine run from last place, and show
ing in the lead as the stretch was reached
won easily, three lenghts in front of the
rank outsider Â£,wiftsure, against whom the
ring offered 100 to 1 for the place.
The Burns and Waterhouse stable
turned out another hot favorite for the
fifth race, a short six-furlong spurt, ajid
following in the footsteps of so many more
from that unfortunate stable finished sec
ond. Midlo, with 86 pounds up, looked a
"lead-pipe," and it was'not to be wondeTed
at that ne was hammered down to 7 to' lo.
He did finally manage to beat the 20 to 1
shot, Catch Em, as the stretch was reached,
but was beaten easily in the run to the
wire by the second choice, Highland.
Hermanita, the werl-plaved third choice,
finished in the show.
Fourteen members of tbe ''lower five"
were herded together and started iv a tive
furlong scramble that wound up the day's
sport. The very warm tip from the sage
brush State, Todhunter, was started and
was pounded down from 10 to 4, starting
equal favorite with Comrade. The horse
from Nevada took the lead as soon as the
flag fell and opening up a gap, looked a
winner up to the last thirty yards, when
he began to back up, and was nipped on
the wire by Comrade.
Track and Paddock Items.
Alex Shields, the owner of Logan, had a
good-sized bet down on his horse yester
day,
Stufflet on Perseus did not prevent Rlley
Grannan from bettiug a chunk of coin on
the fast gelding.
Green Morris will shortly ship imp.
Star Ruby to Rancho del Paso, where He
will be mated with a number of richly
bred mares at the big breeding establish
ment. Strathmeath will also be turned
oiit at pasturage for a long rest.
As the flag fell on the starters in the
handicap, Cochran on Moderocio pulled
his mount up slightly, which did not im
prove his chances any.
Betting in the downtown poolrooms
must have been very light yesterday, es
pecially on the handicap. The commis
sioner employed by the rooms to place
money at the track was at his post flash
ing his usual bunch of "phony" telegrams.
After carefully scrutinizing the betting on
the handicap the commissioner leisurely
wandered out to the field boot ana made a
dollar bet on Thornhill. This was the ex
tent of his wagerine- on this particular
event, the liveliest betting affair of the
day. Could it be possible that on this sort
of a flimsy pretext the brazen keepers of
these gruesome "joints" would have the
audacity to testify in court tnat they were
merely doing a commission business, and
that all the coin they took in was bet at
the racetrack?
NEW USE POE BANK NOTES.
Edison Said to Be Buying Up Old Con
... ; federate Bills.
It is pretty generally known that before
Edison could find the material suitable for
the filament of the incandescent lamp he
had to ransack nearly "every country in
the hope of meeting with the kind of bam
boo which he had decided was what he
wanted.
He tested over 400 kinds of bamboo, and
finally came across the species for his pur
pose in the interior of Japan. From there
he has since drawn his supplies regularly.
A story is now going the rounds which, if
it is as truÂ£ as it is interesting, will ex
plain where the greater part of the Con
federate paper money with which this
country was flooded some years ago goes,
and shows that Japan is not the only
source of filament material.
An old man of Atlanta is said to make a
business of quietly gathering iv all the
Confederate bank notes he can put his
hands on. This paper was issued by the
ton during the war, and a great deal of it
is still floating around. Tbe story goes
that when the old man gets a big bundle
of the paper he sends it to Edison, who
pays a good price for it.
Edison uses it to make carbon for his in
candescent lamps. It seems strange that
this substance has been hit upon for the
purpose until it is explained that the
paper on which these notes were en-
f rayed was made of the pulp or sea grass,
his branch of the paper-making industry
has become a dead art.
Sea grass paper, when chemically
treated by Edison, has been found to make
the best sort of carbon for incandescent
lamps, and so there is always a demand
for the Confederate bills.â Pittsburg Dis
patch.
The Emperor of Japan, who has prom
ised to visit England, is an individual who
would appeal to the English heart. He is
an all-round sportsman, devoted to riding,
shooting, tennis, fishing and billiards, and
a patron of football.
NEW TO-DAY.
Gladness Comes
With a better understanding of the
transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâgentle effortsâ pleasant effortsâ
rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. It is therefore
all important, in .order to get its bene-
ficial effects, to note when you pur-
chase, that you have the genuine article,
which is manufactured by the California
Fig Syrup Co. only, and sold by all rep-
utable druggists.
If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, then laxa-
tives or other remedies are not needed.
If afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
then one should have the best, and with
the well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

THE SECRET OF .SUCCESS.
Many People Could Become Rich .If
They Only Knew How.
Statistics show that 95 per cent of all person!
engaged in business in the United States fail!
In other words, only 5 per cent of all our
business men. are fortunate enough to make a
competency and keep It.
Do you know what is the cause of thl6?
Wise men who have investigated the matter
tell us that the men who succeed are men ol
brain*, with strong nerves and great will *
power. The men who iail are the weak, irri
table, dyspeptic persons. .
; Is there any way In which such people can
Improve their health? Yes, undoubtedly there
is. Many people have fortunately discovered
th.v it is quite possible, and some of them are
giving others tho benefit of their experience.
Mr. Selden Fiih, a prominent Chicago attor
ney, recently said: "I was completely broken
down through too close application to business
when I was persuaded to try Dutty's pure malt
whiskey. Before many weeks had passed I was
completely restored to health. lam convinced
that this whiskey is nature's great remedy for
any wasting disease."
Mr. E. C. Avilla of the Association for Im
proving the Condition of the I'oor, Brooklyn,
N. V., says: "I used to suffer terribly from
severe headaches and nervous prostration, bnt
I have been completely restored by tho use of
Duffy's pure mait whiskey."
It should be remembered that ordinary food
and drink cannot supply the great vital force
which people with active brains and bodies
require. This great, stimulating principle,
however, is contained iv Dutty's pure mult,
and that is why every person wbo takes it
receives such wonderful .Benefit. There is
nothing like it for building up the health and
giving weak, weary people new life and vigor,

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 3.-The passage of a
free coinage bill by the Senate on Saturday, as
generally expected in well-informed financial cir
cles, had no special influence on prices at the
stock Kxchange. In fact the reactionary ten
dency of the stock market, which was its charac
teristic to-day, was chiefly due to lower cables
from London and to a disposition on the part of
local operators to reaiice their lines until the out
come of the new Government loan subscription is
known. Tnere were a few stocks which displayed
weakness, notably Lead. Sugar and General Elec
tric Lead lell iV 2 t025, the death of President
Thompson having been used against the stock.
Sugar sold down from loss's to lOoig, the
rumors about the probable action of the Reichstag
in the matter of a bounty on exported German
sugars having bad an adverse effect. General
Electric dropped from 30&g to 27^ on aeniuls of
the stories current last week that the company had
secured the contract to equip the Manhattan
Electric road with electric power. There was no
pressure to sell, however, and late in the day,
when the posted rates of sterling exchange were
reduced to $4 8." and $4 88V2> a net decline of 1
per cent for the day, the market for .stocks
showed an improving tendency.
'1 he importations of gold and a belief that the
new Government loan will be largely oversub
scribed added to the slimness of slocks in the late
trading. The heaviness of sterling exchange was
generally accepted as meaning that the foreign
subscriptions will be large, and this added to the
anxiety of the shorts in the late trading. The
market closed about steady in tone. Net changes
show loss-s of i/B@l'VÃ percent, Missouri Pacific,
General Elennc and Lake Shore leading. Total
sales were 148,350.

CHICAGO, lix., Feb 3.â The snowstorm which
set in last night and which was is full blast this
morning cooled the ardor of wheat bulls, although
It did not infuse a great amount of courage into,
the bear ranks. ; The snowfall ' affords ; protection
; to the growing winter wheat In, many places, where
'it was badly needed. Prices '; around the opening
did not break with any great' violence, but rather â¢
seemed to . sag > from lack of support. Liverpool
quoted = Vad ? advance â  In - 1 reflection of American
strength of Saturday. Receipts .at : ChfcaÂ«p were
143 cars and the Northwest had . 644. , Last Mon
: day Northwestern : arrivals were 724 ' cars â  and n
year ago :- 173 : cars. 'â¢ Local : Inspections from store
amounted to â  82.833 1 bu Â«hels. '.â â  At the end of the
first hour the tone of the market underwent a radi
cal'change,' prices quickly recovering all they had
previously lost and making further sharp .gains
under an ludux of buying orders from the otnsidc
The feeling subsequently was very sensitive ana
fluctuations were quick and erraiic. The visible
supply decreased 789.000 bushels and tho amount
on ocean passage 320,000 bushels. The English
visible supply showed a decrease of 1,270,000
bushels. Closing Continental cables wÂ«re all
higher. Exports at Atlantic ports wpre 376,446
bushels, wheat and flour included. May wheat
opened from 67y 8 c to 66T' B e, sold between 665/sC
and 683^ c. clostue at 6Â«Â»/sc, 1 Vttc hlguer than Sat
urday. Estimated receiots for to-morrow 105
cars. â¢ â¢ . â¢ ,
CORNâ Was governed by the fluctuations and
temper of the wheat market. At first the inclina
tion was downward, and prices lost a portion of the
gain of last week, but when the bulge In wheat
took place corn promptly responded, And In a short
time had recovered what had been previously lost.
Receipts were 435 cars, and 65,670 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables quoted
V 4& advance. The visible supply Increased 1,545,
--000 bushels, and the amount on ocean passage
1,520,000. The extreme strength of wheat was
not participated in by corn, the large increase in
stocks mentioned checking advancing prices. : Ex
port clearances were 334,394 bushels. : May corn
opened at 30-% c, sold between 31c and 30%@
30 C/ B e, closing at 3034@30%c, a shade under Sat
urday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow .(â  350
OATSâ Like corn depended mainly on the
strength or weakness of wheat for motive. A fair
business was transacted, the upward tendency of
prices brineing forward <juite a few buying orders,
and causing some covering of short stuff. Re
ceipts were 261 cars. The visible supply Increased
191,000 busht-ls. May oats clcsed unchanged from
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 280
cars.
FLAX-Was steady. Cash, 92@92i/fec: May,
95i/^c. Receipts were S9 cars.
PROVISIONSâ A steady feeling ruled In pro
visions with no remarkable happenings in the way
of business or news to note. The attention of
traders was distracted by the more active charac
ter of the wheat market. Hogs were higher, but
late reports quoted an easy tone. May pork closed
10c lower than .Saturday, May lard a shade lower
and May ribs unchanged.

GOOD GOVERNMENT CLUB.
Councilmen Surprised by the Ap
pearance of Its At

THE CALL'S STOEY VERIFIED.
Shattuck Withdraws His Offer for
a Wilmerding School Site
. .at Berkeley. . .
' " -
â¢ -
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
003 Broadway, Feb. 3. .).
The report in The ( Call two months
ago of the existence and purposes of a
Good Government Club to keep watch oJ
the city officials and finances was solidly
corroborated to-day by an interview with
ex-Congressman John R. Glascock. -
For some months there has existed an
organization which considered as its work
the guarding of the public funds. It was
said that the- organization was brought
â¢ about by the desire of a certain citizen
clement to see Mayor Davie's dollar tax
levy carry the city through the year and
not cause any deficiency or shut off any
needed improvements.' â /.;
John K. Glascock was the first to an
nounce outright that there was such an
organization, and his announcement was
made at a special meeting of ; the Council
when charges acainst ' School . Director
.Moody an \X City Engineer Wilson were
being considered. He .was allowed the
floor to speak, but was asked whether he
appeared as an* attorney or as a citizen.
He replied that he -appeared in both ca
pacities and also as a member of the Good
Government Club.
In reply to further questioning Mr. Glas
cock said that tba club was still in the pro
cess of organization and its purpose was
to protect the city from dishonest officials.
He said he had always taken a deep inter
est in the city affairs during his residence
of thirty years, and that all he wanted
was to see the city have a good, clean, hon
est government. " He denied thestary that
be hid advised the Mayor to sign a requi
sition Wilson presented so as to ; get a
chance to throw Wilson out of office. .
Speaking of the matter â  afterward . Mr.
Glascock said ; "1 went to tie rueetins
as chairman of the Good. Government Club
to oppose the payment of the claims for
the plat books made in the City Engineer's
office. I did not go as the attorney for the
Mayor as has been saici. The clnb is only
in its formative staie and its intention i's
to have it consist of leading and influen
tial citizens. No charge has been made to
the club that a fund of $3500 had been
raised to help out the tax levy failed ta
furnish the city sufficient to run on until
the next ievy,"and I believe it is only the
work of Eome dissatisfied Populists." '.
Mr. Towle said he knew nothing about
the charge, save that it was a general
rumor that a purse had been raised to pre
vent the passage of an ordinance provid
ing for more than a levy of $1. - ' .'.<>
City Expert Kaufman was asked whether
his salary is paid out of the money alleged
to have been raised to prevent the passage
of an ordinance calling for more than a
tax levy of $1, as alleged. .
I Said he: "My salary is paid by' the
Mayor and the city. Partof it comes out
of the general fund. I have also private
employment which enables me to make
I enough to live." â  â ,- ',' - : . -"â 
Mayoi Davie said: "Tdwle and Wilson
maite the charge of a fund being raised,
but there, is not a . word of truth in it.
That rumor was started a month ago, and
was intended to injure me. When I asked
Wilson who had told him, he said he didn't
want to tell. I told him |iiat â¢ lie ought to
have kept quiet then until he could sub
stantiate the charge. 1 asked him whether
he would not have collected the money if
I had signed the requisition. With me,
it was simply a. standing under the
charter." ~
SHATTUCK WITHDRAWS,
His Wilmerding School Site Offer Open
...-â¢'â¢' No Longer.
, OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 3.â F. K. Shat
tuck has withdrawn his offer of a block of
land in Bertceley for the Wilmerding
School site. " When . asked for his reason
to-day he said: .
â¢ "Something over six months ago I ad
dressed a letter to Albert Miller, one of
the regents of the University of California
and chairman of â¢ that body's committee
to select a site for the Wilmerding School,
I offering to them' the site referred to, and
to this day - have never received any
acknowledgment of . the letter or offer. I
lad concluded they did not want it; so
last week I wrote 'him referring to this
fact and concluding by saying I took their
silence as meaning that they preferred
tome other aite/so would withdraw
offer. â¢â¢ That is the situation at present."
In response to a letter cent to Mr. Hil
born a week ago to-day the following tele
gram was to-day received: ' .-
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â Put me down
on your hundred-dollar list to secure to Oak

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
WOES OF THE MEAGHERS
A Story of the Foothills Told
Yesterday in an Oakland
Court.
THE HOUSE LONG UN TENANTED.
Meagher Committed Suicide and His
Wife Became Insaneâ The
Place Now Avoided.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call;)
008 Broadway, Feb. 3, 1896. f
A curious story developed during the
hearing of the Meagher estate case to-day.
It was the story of a haunted house, of
the people who lived in it being driven in
sane and of an estÂ»te that has been eaten
up to the last penny by a dozen j r e,arji of
administration.
Twelve years ago old John Meagher
passed away. He bad lived in his house,
on his own property, about a mile this side
of Haywards and about midway between
the electric-car track and the sloping hill
side. He was a thrifty rancher, but trou
ble of different kinds pressed heavily on
his mind and rendered him despondent,
He lived in the house with his wife, but
there were no children, and from chance
remarks dropped by Meagher the absence
of boys and girls from the family heartn
helped to bring about the feeling of indif
ference that he felt toward all the world.
The (iual straw that broke the desire to
live any longer will never be learned, but
one morning nearly fourteen years ago
Mrs. Meagher arose to discover that her
husband had taken his life.
The effect of the tragic discovery on the
wife was to shock her reason. She became
violently hysterical and after three days,
as there was no improvement, she was
pronounced insane. . She was sent to Napa
Asylum and the cl<>ud upon her intellect
lias never been lifted. She is an old
woman now and an attorney who visited
her recently says she is of a" docile dispo
sition except when her mind reverts to
the fearful event that dethroned her rea
son and then she has to be restrained.
After Mrs. Catherine Meagher was taken
away friends went into the house and
tidied up the furniture. Then the door
was locked and ps there were no heirs
Louis Gottsball. who was then Public Ad
ministrator, took possession of the estate,
i-ome years ago a Chinaman got into 'he
house and next day he was iiiscovered in
the hills insane. He told a wild story of
visions and noises that he had seen and
heard in the house, and as his experience
had evidently ruined his reason he, too,
was sent to an asylum.
The place was rendered more mysterious
by a party of young men who, knowing
the reputation of the place, went there
one dark night and burned blue lights and
axplotled firecrackers.
Attorney W. H. Waste was ordered by
the court to sell the property some time

Insane.

ago, but there is some dispute over the
biris and the matter is azaia in the courts.
The property was worth at one time
$3000, but the entire lack of income to
keep it in repair and the expenses of liti
gation and administration for twelve
years have eaten up the estate. It is im
possible now to make it pay the expenses
that have accrued against the estate.
NO DIPLOMAS RECEIVED.
Exhibitors Have Grievances
Against the Mechanics'
Institute.
Three Months After the Show Closed
a Letter Expressing Sorrow
Was Received.
Oaklasd Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway. Feb. 3. \
There is a general grievance against the
directors of the Mechanics' Institute,
San Francisco, because of the fact that
the exhibitors who were awarded di
plomas on September 14 of last year have
as yet received no certificate of award.
The fortunate exhibitors who moved their
Mechanics' Institute exhibits to the Oak
land Exposition were anxious to display
their diplomas at the Tabernacle, but were
unable to procure them. Neither have
they yet been forwarded. The manner of
making the awards is also seriously ques
tioned, and Oakland's commercial bodies
have concluded that their exhibits at in
dustrial expositions will be confined to
this side of the bay.
The recent disagreement between the
Mechanics' Institute and the Manufactur
ers' Association has been watched on this
side of the bay and grievances freely aired.
The oojection most forcibly made comes
frjm the Keller Company, whose experi
ence with the Mechanics' Institute was
told to-day by the president of that con
cern. M. J. Keller is a vice-president
of the Kan Francisco Manufacturers' Asso
ciation and also president of tbe Oakland
Board of Trade. His story was borne out
by the various notices and' letters that he
has received, and represents the griev
ance of hundreds of exhibitors. At the
Oakland Exposition the diplomas were
eivon to exhibitors on the closing ni?ht of
the show. The Mechanics' Institute fair
directorate has not yet awarded its
diplomas, although nearly rive months
have passed since the fair was closed.
"It 13 not surprising that the manufac
turers have lost faith in the management
of the Mechanics' Institute," said Mr.
Keller to-day. "We have not been fairly
treated, and in fact I know of scores of
manufacturers who will never again pat
ronize the Mechanics' fair.
' r Our company placed nnd maintained a
working exhibit of a shirt factory at the
fair. Those are the most expensive kind
of exhibits, because we had to pay for ex
tra help, and for meals and transportation
for our workers. It cost us hundreds of
dollars and was a very attractive corner
of the fair. There were Rome things which
I wished to explain to the judges when
they made their inspection of exhibits. I
wrote and asked for that privilege. I was
told that I would be duly informed of the
time and would be accorded the privilege
asked. 1 knew nothing more till I was in
formed that we had been awarded the
highest diploma for 'dressing.' We were
indignant, and informed the directors that
the diploma was a farce, as there was no
such exhibit as that named in the cata-
logue.
"1 went to the City and made formal
complaint. I met the committee, and
about two months after the fair closed I
was told that the matter had been recon
sidered and I had been awarded the high
est diploma for our entire exhibit. I
waited a few days for the diploma, and as
it did not come I .again went to the City. I
said that exhibitors made the fair, and
that they had the right 10 reap all the ben
efits from it. We wanted our diploma to
hang in the Oakland Exposition that
opened on December 16, ana we were anx
ious to have it. I saw the secretary and
he told me that the diplomas were in the
hands of the engraver, and were to be ready
that day. We called up the lithographers
and they said they were just sending a
bundle of diplomas to the office. I waited
till they came and then took the wording
of it for use. The secretary told me that
he would have them signed right away
and would send them out. I left feeling
somewhat satisfied.
"On December 14 I received a letter from
the secretary and he 9aid: 'The diplomas
that you saw the day you were here are not
satisfactory and will have to be changed.
We are sorry to disappoint you, but will
send diploma as soon as possible.'
"That letter came on December 14, three
months after the fair closed, and as I have
heard nothing more, I conclude that they
are still sorry. I have lost all interest in
the diploma now. and am perfectly indif
ferent as to whether it comes or not.
"I am not alone in this matter, for I be-
Hsve that hundreds of manufacturers feel
the same as I do."

LIQUOR RAID RESISTED
â¢
Berkeley's Town Marshal At
tacked in a Saloon in
West Berkeley.
RESULT OF A LONG CAMPAIGN.
Plot to Break the Town CharterâUni
versity Baseballâ lnteresting
Brief News Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Feb. 3.â Town Mar
shal Lloyd was assaulted last night while
enforcing the liquor laws. Tbe Marshal
entered tbe establishment of John Hig
gins, at the corner of Third street and
Town Marshal Lloyd of Berkeley.
[From a photograph,]
University avenue, West Berkeley, at
about 10 o'clock in the evening. Lloyd
says the proprietor was serving whisky
and beer to several custoraer.3 and the
officer endeavored to seize the bottle from
which the liquor was poured. In order to
do bj Lloyd jumped on the bar.
According to Lloyd's story Higgins
quickly overturned the bottle and, aided
by a customer, attempted to prevent it
from falling into the officer's possession.
The officer received two blows on the head
from his assailants, but managed to get
hold of the bottle.
Higgins was arrested for selling liquor
without a license and the customer who
attacked the Marshal was charged with
battery.
The arrested saloon -keeper denies that
any assault was committed by him or any
of his customers, and says that no liquor
has been sold in his place. Marshal Lloyd,
however, has the bottle over which the
struggle occurred, and, though it was
empty before he secured it, it has an
odor that shows its content? to have been
whisky.
Lloyd is decidedly unpopular among the
illicit saloonmen and their customers in
Berkeley, and his assault is not occasion
for surprise. He has conducted a vigorous
anti-liquor campaign in the town for many
months.
Baseball to the Front.
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. 3.â The man
agers of tne baseball teams at the law,
medical and dental colleges met t>day at
the university and with Manager Friend
of the college teams at Berkeley outlined a
schedule of games for the coming season.
The recitations, both in the Affiliated Col
leges and those at Berkeley, are so ar
ranged that it will not be possible to play
off the series at any other time excepting
Saturday afternoons. All the games will
take place on the Berkeley diamond. A
wire fence is to be put around the field
and a small admission fee charged
for admission to the games.
The first match game of the season will be
that of the freshmen and sophomores on
next Wednesday afternoon. The sopho
mores seem to have vantage ground, pos
sessing at the present time two complete
nines of well-trained players. The game
between the football men and glee club on
next Saturday will be something of a
novelty and promises to attract a lar>:e
crowd. The football team will appear in
complete football uniform, while the mem
bers of the glee club will be attired in duck
trousers, negligee shirts and straw hats.
The management has suggested that the
fraternities give a basket luncheon before
the game and that the entire student body
join in making it the ga.'a day of the base
ball season. Following is the schedule of
games, with dates, as decided upon by the
several managers to-day:
Freshman-sophomore, Wednesday afternoon,
February 5; football team vs. glee club, Satur
day, February 8; detital college vs. Berkeley

winners of the second game against winners
of the third, Saturday afternoon, March 7;
winner of iho last-mentioned contest against
winner of the fourth game in the series, for
the Untvemty of California championship and

To Break the Charter.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 3.â lt became
known to-day that a plan is toeine quietly
but energetically pushed in West Berkeley
which, it carried to a successful issue, will
attract considerable public attention in
the near future. The scheme is nothing
less than to overthrow the present city
charter, and the work of so doing is said
-to be in the hands of a number of indi
viduals who feel that they have grievances
to right as things now stand.
One ground of procedure in the matter
of breaking the charter was to have been
the alleged fact that two of the freeholders
who originally framed the document were
not citizens; but this plan has now been
abandoned, as it is conceded that as a ma
jority of the freeholders were citizens the
work of that body would stand. A peti
tion has been in circulation for several
daya, the object of which is to secure funds
to carry on the case, and it is stated that a
liberal sum has already been subscribed
and paid for that purpose, and that a well
known Oakland attorney has been secured
to represent the interests of those corf
cerned in overthrowing the charter.
l,tmrh for the Students.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 3.â The co
eds at the university will meet again to
morrow afternoon at Stiles' Hall for the
purpose of further discussing the practica
bility of supplying hinch to the students
brigade during the labors of the latter on
the university grounds. Since their first
meeting, called by Mrs. F. V. Paget, the
supporters of the plan have been working
vigorously among the heretofore non-in
terested 'element, with the result that
many converts have been made. One of
the lenders in the movement to supply the
toiling collegians with coffee and sand
wiches stated to-day that she was very
hopeful for the -favorable outcome of the
plan.
New Water Supply.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 3.â The Ala
meda Water Company has announced to
the Board of Town Trustees its inability to
develop a sufficiently large water supply
to meet the demands of West Berkeley.
The company has expressed its willingness
to abandon the territory to the Contra
Costa Water Company, which company is
said to be ready to extend its mains to that
section if suitable terms can be* reached
with the Town Board. The Trustees will
meet next Thursday evening for the pur
pose of further discussing the matter.
Disease Germi In Vegetables.
. BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 3.â The class
m bacteriology at the university, under
the direction of Professor Wood worth, is
conducting a series of experiments with
the view to determining whether the con
jecture that certain diseas.es are brought
into homes through vegetables is true.
The methods being used by them are
simple, consisting merely of planting
vegetables in media favorable to the
growth of bacteria, inoculating the roots
with germs and determining the results.
The Next Blue and Gold.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feo. 3.â Plans are

ELOPED FROM ALAMEDA
Annie Francis, a Girl of Fif
teen Years, Runs
Away.
It Is Supposed That She Has Married
Edward Cpwellâ Search by
the Police.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 3. )
This city and Alarneda were scoured to
night by relatives and friends of Annie
Francis of Alameda, a 15-year-old girl who
is supposed to have eloped with Edward
Cowell, a young man about 22 years of age.
Mrs. Francis has watched the progress of
the love affairs of the young couple for
some weeks, and she suspected that they
were planning marriage. Miss Annie
made no secret of her attachment for
young Cowell, but it was not supposed she
would run away. According to the re
ports of the girl's relatives Annie had
some valuable jewelry, and as it has disap
peared at intervals it is supposed that she
has sold it to help out the financial end of
what her mother says is an elopement.
Annie's father is a ship-captain and is
away from home most oi the time.
Annie obtained a situation, but yester
day her mother learned that she had gone
with young Cowell.
A systematic search was commenced
this afternoon, as the girl bad been ab
sent since yesterday. Mrs. Francis applied
to the County Clerk to see whether a mar
riage license had been issued. No license
had been taken out in this county. A
visit was made to the Humane Society,
and Mrs. Francis told her story of Annie's
elopement and asked for assistance in lo
cating her. The usual methods were fol
lowed, but nothing could be learned of the
taissing girl or Cowell.
A visit was made by the girl's friends to
the Sheriff's office and orders were issued
to intercept any one answering the given
description. Then the aid of the police'
was invoked, but nothing was learned of
the youthful couple in Oakland, and it was
concluded that they must have gone across
the bay.
No license was issued to them in San
Francisco, and it is supposed that they
have gone farther away. Mrs. Francis is
convinced that they are married and is
anxious to know where her daughter is lo
cated. The girl looks older than she is,
but hardly as though she had reached the
legal ace of eighteen.
Edward Cowell, with whom the missing
girl is supposed to havb eloped, is a dretsy
young man, about 22 years of age, and is
well-known about Alameda. Annie's
father is expected to return from a voyage
shortly and her mother says it will break
his heart to find his daughter gone.
SAYS THEY READ POORLY
Rev. George Gibson Scores His
Brethren's Pulpit De
portment.
Californian Ministers Listen Meekly,
While Their Oratory Is
v Derided.
The mem bers of the Baptist Ministerial
Union received a number of hints on pul
pit deportment yesterday morning from
Rev. J. George Gibson of Emmanuel Baptist
Church. There was a very full attendance,
and the eminent gentlemen listened with
politeness, though not with complacency,
while Mr. Gibson criticized them for using
manuscript instead of preaching extem
pore. He also expressed strong disapproval
of the grammar, pronunciation and gen
eral methods of pulpit oratory which pre
vails in America, particularly on the Pa
cific Coast.
Mr. Gibson, with a rich accent which at
once proclaimed him as hailing from *he
banks of the Frith of Forth, vigorously at
tacked the Englisb of his American breth
ren, assuming himself the position of a
man whose lips are a well of English unde
tiled, and whose gestures bristle with
eloquence and grace. He regretted in
touching terms that so many Baptist min
isters in California lessen their efficiency
â¢by using manuscript in the pulpit.
"All the great preachers have been talk
ers," he said, and after intimating that he
himself shared Smirgeon and other pulpit
orators' fluency in the use of the tongue,
he went on to ridicule the hesitancy, want
of precision, want of system and want of
thought that characterize so many Califor
nia preachers, who, he said, are also in the
habit of adjusting a style of voice that
kills effect.
'â¢I so often see," he said, "that a preacher
does not know how to use his hands or his
feet, or to turn his mouth around. I urge
you to try to acquire the. art of speaking
beautifully and naturally in public."
Rev. Mr. Boynton enumerated the min
isters of the Baptist Union, stating that
almost without exception they are in the
habit of speaking extempore. He also
quietly and firmly drew attention 10 a few
of Mr. Gibson's Jforth Country peculiari
ties of speech, such as 4 'gud" for good,
and asked whether the pastor of Emman
uel Church had used the expression "on
the 'spot' of the moment" advertantly, or
merely as a flower of speech.
Rev. W. T. Jordan intimated that if Mr.
Gibson turned his attention to criticizing
the dialects of England he would find no
rest for the sole of his foot.
Rev. Robert Whittaker remarked:
"Brother Gibson's talk this morning has
been disorderly and desultory. He would
have spoken better if he had used a man
uscript. 'Fools rush In where angels fear
to crenel,' and f. have found a great many
extemporaneous preachers who -rushed
in."
Rev. E. H. Hayden gracefully thanked
his brother Gibson for his rating of The
California ministers. If there was a tinge
of sarcasm in the thanks it was not ap
parent on the surface.
In closing the discussion, Rev. G. Gibson
threw more slings and arrows at "Eng
lish as she is spoke" in California pulpit-.
"I have the greatest difficulty in speaking
American English," he said pathetically.
"I hear so much bad grammar arouti 1
me that I really find difficulty in speaking
well myself. Brother Whittaker has made
a criticism that has never been made on
me since I was a minister, and I deny his
charge that my remarks were disorderly
or desultory. Brother Wbitiaker says he
became a preacher with difficulty. I can
quite believe U. I once heard him speak
in Metropolitan Temple, and I thought at
the time that if he hail written hia address
down beforehand he would have burned it.'
This caustic remark caused the brethren
to exchange locks of surprise, as Ilev. Mr.
Wbittaker is considered one of the finest
preachers in the Baptist conference.
Mr. Gibson, blandly unconscious of the
sensation he had caused, went on to say
that in bis estimation Genera! Dickinson
and Eugene Dupre'y would make very poor
preachers, though District Attorney
Barnes he considered to be a more accom
plished speaker than most pulpit orators.
He also exp-essed surprise that i!ie Baptist
brethren in California are in the habiÂ» of
speaking their sermons extempore.
"Whenever I have heard them," he con
cluded, triumphantly, "they have read
their seirnons, and them very poorly."
Presbyterian Ministers.
Rev. Dr. Maihetia scored the vices of
this and other large cities yesterday, in a
paper on "The Evangelization of Ban
Francisco," which he read before the
Presbyterian Ministerial Association.
"What the churche3 in the City of
San Francisco ne&d mest," he said, "is a
revival of religion." Dr. Mathena also
said the City needed a revival of Snbbath
keeping. "1 plead for a Sabbath day and
for Sunday closing. There are thousands
of temptations to lead ihe- young astray.
We do not see so much of it from our own
firesides, but if we believe all we hear there
are scenes which would make the devil
himself ashamed. Ido not, however, say
this is the worst city in the world, and I do
not hold with those Eastern novelists who
come here, abuse us and whitewash their
own cities."
Dr. Mathena proceeded to lash the vices
of San Francisco, the poolrooms, side
entrances to saloons, gambling and
kindred vices, and concluded by urging
ministers to unite in evangelizing the
City and preaching the thunderbolts of
God.
Rev. Francis King, in discussing the
paper, said he believed \n preaching love
rather than thunderbolts.
Rev. slr. Burnham spoke enthusiastic
ally of the good a rich man might ac
complish who would build a palace,
where between services on Sunday the
people might see art treasures and hear
music of the highest kind.
Dr. Bevier thought that great cities had
always been more or less cities of iniquity.
Dr. Farrand pointed out that people are
apt to forget the heroic struggles many
Christians are continually making to do
their duty.
Methodist Club.
Rev, Carlos Martyn delivered a lecture
on "Civic Reform" before the Methodist
ministers yesterday morning. The speaker
made practically the same remarks that
he used in addressing the Presbyterian
Ministerial Association two weehs ago.
In Europe, the ordinary color for mourn*
ing is black, which, being the privation of
light, is supposed to denote the termina
tion of life. In China, it is white, the
emblem of parity, which color was the
mourning of the ancient Spartan and
Roman ladies. In Egypt it is yellow.which,
representing the color of leaves whÂ£n they
fall, and flowers when they fade, signifies
that death is the end of all human hopes.
In Ethiopia, brown, which denotes the
earth.

THE PINE-LUMBER TRUST.
Denial of the Existence of the
Combine by a Few Deal
ers Here.
IT WILL CONTROL THE TRADE.
Even the Redwood Lumbermen of This
State May Enter the Recently
Formed Compact.
The combination of Pacific Coast lum
bermen into the "Central Lumber Com
pany of California." reported to have been
formed. at Port Townsend February 1. if it
is as stated, is the result of deliberations
going on amon? dealers for some time.
The dispatch from Puget Sound alleges
that the great trust represents a combined
capital of $70,000,000, and includes in its
membership every lumber mill and all the
wholesale and "retail dealers and ship
owners on the coast; and that the first
move of the combine will be an advance in
price of $2 per thousand.
It was also stated in the dispatch that
prominent lumbermen of the north say
they have been steadily losing money for
several years through competition with
each other, and that tha combination is
for the purpose of regulating prices and
stopping ruinous competition. They
claim that the Port Townsend announce
ment it premature, but acknowledge that
all arrangements have been completed and
that the news of the combination will be
made public soon.
Queries among lumber-dealers in this
City elicit both confirmation and denial,
but a general agreement prevails upon the
fact that prices have been going to ruin.
The larger linns contradict the statement
of a combine, even going in some cases so
far as to deny that any conditions exist call
ing for such a combination. However,others
freely acknowledge that they have been
losing money in lumber, and efforts ha.-c
been made to establish a trust that would
control all the details of the trade, regu
lating the output from each locality and
the proportionate amount of lumber each
carrier shall transport to market. The
estimated output of the Pacific Coast for
last year was 600,000,000 feet and the pro
posed advance of $2 per 1000 feet will in
crease the profits of the mill-owners lor
the coming year over $1,000,000.
A meeting was held yesterday afternocn
in the office 01 Edward M. Herrick, presi
dent of the Pacific Pine Lumber Company,
bj a number of prominent iumber-dealers
in this City. No details of the rii:-cussion
could be learned, and to all questions re
traiding the existence of the combine em
phatic denials were returned.
F. F. Finley. a redwood lumber man at
10 California street, said in an interview
thut a combine of the pine lumber men of
Puget Sound and British Columbia would
not affect the redwood business of this
State.
"But the same conditions prevail in bpth
classes of lumber,'" said he, "and for some
time the output of the lumber mills have
been greatly in excess of. th â  demand. All
lumber sawed here must be consumed on
this coast with the exception of a little sent
south.
"Of course. I do not know what the pine
men intend to do, but some kind of com
bination is needed to regulate the lumber
business. The depression in the trade
began with the collapse of tne Southern
California boom when people stopped
building wooden houses. During that
period everybody in the north who had a
iew acres of trees went to lumbering and
the usual trouble. and ruin ensued.
"Don't call it a 'trust.' No trust can
live in the lumber trade. The peculiar
conditions that govern the'business would
break it down if an attempt were made to
push prices above a reasonable limit. I
understand it is only a com bine to regulate
the output and price so that miil men can
work without Joss. Efforts have been
made among the redwood people to form
Buch a company and for a like object, and
I believe this combine of the pine lumber
men will be followed by others."
S. A. Harmon of the Harmon Lumber
Company, 43 Market street, said that he
did not believe that the lumber combine
was yet complete, but efforts were, being
made for that object.
"Lumber men have come to the conclu
sion," saitl he, "that something must be
done to put life in the business. Lumber
is oeing sold for actual cost and absolutely
nothing .is being made in that commod
ity."
H. D. Peete, publisher of a lumber
journal at' 10 California street, said that
more failures had been recorded in the
lumber business the last year than in any
other period, and that the trade was at
stagnation.
A builder and contractor who is thor
oughly acquainted with the lumber trade,
but does not wish his name published,
stated yesterday that the dispatch re-
Jating to the lumber trust was correct in
every particular.
"That combine has really been in exist
ence for some time," said he, "because
about a month ago wholesale lumber
prices were lifted through the efforts of
the combination. Pine lumber went up
about 20 per cent and redwood about 80.
Of course the big companies here deny the
existence of the trust ; they deny tne exist
ence of conditions making a combine a
necessity. But a trust exists and future
prices will show it. With about ? 50,000 ,000
represented capital the Central Lumber
Company of California will dominate the
Jumoer business on this coast in the fu
ture."
A PANIC 35 YEAES AGO.
It Wag During the Exciting Convention
That Nominated Douglas.
The Friday-night calamity in the Front
street Theater, in Baltimore, recalls the
panic in the same theater during the Dem
ocratic National Convention of 1860, pre
sided over by Caleb Cushing. An angry
feeling prevailed amons: the delegates,
which was fostered openly by such fire
eaters as William L. Yancey and others,
and secretly by such anti-Douglas politi
cians as Caleb Gushing and Benjamin F.
Butler. The admission of new Southern
delegates favorable to Stephen A. Doug
las in place of those who had withdrawn
at Charleston intensified the Soutliern
feeling, and when the convention met it
â was evident that very little was needed to
provoke an outbreak.
Caleb Cushing was in the chair, smooth,
plausible and unequaled as a parliamenta
rian ; Benjamin F. Butler was on hand,
the crafty representative of Massachusetts
secessionists ; Yancey was present, bril
liant, earnest, impassioned snd eager for a
light; Richardson of Illinois was there,
stern, determined, immovable; Dean Rich
mond was in his place, in charge of the
New York delegation, heavy, phlegmatic
apparently half asleep, but in reality wide
awake to all that was going on, and ready
to meet every emergency.
For the purpose of the convention the
Etage had been thrown open to its furthest
extent. In the rear wall appeared a good
eized square window, evidently designed
for ventilation. On the stage were ar
ranged ttie officers' desks and seats for
the vice-presidents, secretaries, etc. The
reporters' tables were directly in front of
the stage. The orchestra pit had been
boarded over so as to make an even floor.
The seats were so arranged that the
Western delegation* were in the front
rows on the rieht, facing the stage. The
New York delegation was seated in the
center aisle near the stage. The Southern
delegations were on theieft of the stage.
California was in the center ais!e, back.
The Maryland delegates, of course, took
their places in the rear of all.
During a morning session of the conven
tion, in the midst of a hot debate, some of
the"plarflcs in the temporary flooring im
mediately under the seats of the New
Yorkers broke. There was no danger, be
cause if the floor had really given way it
would have meant only a trifling drop,
]Jut the snapping of the boards sounded
like pistol shots. Instantly tbere was a
stampede in the convention. One fat but
nimble delegate mounted on the reporters'
tables, jumped from there to the stage,
bounded like a hurdle-racer over the chairs
of the vice-presidents and made a bee-line
for the bafk of the stage, reaching the
square window ahead of all the others.
His intention was to escape by way of the
window, but on thrustinir his head out he
saw before him considerable of a fall and
below him the water of Jones Falls. Then
he called lustily for those who were beliind
him to pull him back, by this time the
panic was over.â New York World.

THE DEL MONTE
MILLS WRECKED.
Work of a Miscreant Under
Cover of Dark
ness.
SLASHED ALL THE BELTS.
The Crime Was Committed Un
observed After the Fire a
Week Ago.
REVENGE WAS THE MOTIVE.
When the Machinery Started Belting
Flew in All DirectionsâDe
tectives' Theory.
Some miscreant has been at work in the
mills of the Del Monte Milling Company
at Brannan and Second streets, with the
result that the works were practically
wrecked and heavy loss sustained by the
proprietors. He perpetrated his neiarious
task under cover of darkness and at a time
when the mill was lying idle and deserted
after the lire a week ago. And so cun
ningly was the crime committed that no
body can be found who saw- him about the
; premises, nor did the mechanics or pro
prietors have the faintest icea of what
had been done until the machinery was
set in motion some daysjater.
Then it was that the truth flashed upon
the superintendent and millers. The big
engine was started and the wheels began
to move. But suddenly a strange noise
resembling an explosion startled the men
in the mill. The sound had a sudden
snap, as if something liad been rent in
twain with tremendous force, and the
wild burr of flying wheels followed. This
was enough to create a panic, for under
tne excitement of the moment the work
men thought that a terrible accident had
happened, caused no doubt through over
heating of machinery dr.ring the fire.
Almost instantly mere was another
crash, and still another, until it seemed as
if the works were tumbling down with each ;
successive jar and loud report. Those peo
ple who were on the floors where the I
wrecking was thus in progress saw belts
flying from pulleys in all directions, filling
the air with long ribbons of leather or cot- !
ton, and coiling around the driving shafts
in creat tangled masses.
In a minute, or probably less, for the '
time could not be accurately determined
under such circumstances, the works were
Btill. And yet the engine pounded at its
cylinders and flew oh at renewed speed,
having been relieved of the machinery |
before stvarn could be shut off. Little
time was Jost, however, in stopping the
engine, anci then the large flouring-niilis j
were paralyzed.
It did not take long to find out the cause
of the wreck wiiich had taken place before
the millmen could realize what it was, or
what it meant. The machinery appeared
to be in perfect order, after a hasty inspec
tion.
Attention was then turned to the belt
ing. The superintendent discovered that
in every instance Uhe burst and torn belts
had been hacked viciously, and then it
dawned upon him that a crime had been
committed by some evilly disposed person.
The matter was hushed up by the com
pany for reasons best known to itself. T.
J. Parsons, the president of the corpora
tion, said he did not wish to speak about
it.
"Is there any special reason for secrecy ? :|
was asked.
'â¢Well," he replied, "if anything were
said now it might interfere with our ar-
rangements.
"In a week or possibly a few days more
we may be in a position to tell all we know
about it."
Though the president would not make
any further statement, yet it was common
talk among millmen that the Del Monte
mills had been wrecked. As related by
one of these business colleagues of Mr.
Parsons the act was one of revenge on
the part of a discharged employe. A little
group of millmen chatted about the vicious
act yesterday en 'change, when one of
them said :
"The belting throughout the Del Monte
mill has been ruined. Some fellow got
into the mill and cut the belts everywhere
he could. I understand that the convpany
suspects one of its recent employes. There
was a man woricing ip the mill and they
discharged him. The belief or supposition
is he felt that he had been badly treated,
and in consequence owed the company a
grudge, which he paid by wrecking the
mill. Detectives have been put upon the
case and they are shadowing this fellow,
as well as working up whatever evidence
they can find."
"Do they know the man who did it?"
"That I cannot say. All I have been
told is that suspicion is directed toward
one man who was discharged gome time
ago from the mill, but I did not hear any
name mentioned."
Those conversant with the facts agree
that the belts were cut shortly after the
tire occurred in the mill a week ago. Of
necessity work had to be suspended until
the burned parts were cleaned up and re
paired and an adjustment of the loss made
by the insurance companies. Millmen
were not at their customary places and so
the mill was almost deserted. This gave
an opportunity for the wrecker to steal
into the mill and through the machinery
unobserved, and then to make good his
escape. He worked in dark places and
with a skill that betrayed Jus knowledge
of the most vulnerablepoints.
Fire Marshal Towe was informed of the
miscreant's deeds, and lest it might have
had any connection with the fire ne made
an investigation yesterday. â¢
"I found that the man who did this
dirty work did it all in out-of-the-way
places, where it could not be been," Mr.
Towe said. "He hacked pieces out of the
belts, cut holes in the beiting nnd slashed

body saw what he had done until the
machinery was started, and ttien the belt
ing all flew to pieces.
"At first I thought that the belts had
been cut by members of the Frie Patrol, to
enable them to lay covers over Jstock, but
the patrolmen did not cut any belts. Cap
tain Comstock made an inquiry and was
told that his men had not touched the
belting. In any case they would cut. at
joints where connections could be easily
made, and would never hack property in
the vicious way these belts were chopped
and slashed."
The fire insurance adjusters also made an
investigation of the wrecking of the Del
Monte mills and were satisfied that it was
the work of some fellow whose motive was
revenge.
The loss by fire and water on the build
ing and stock was adjusted at $7000, but
the mill company had to stand the loss
caused by the belt-slasher; and in addition

SIMPSON AGREEMENT.
In Trying to Extend It One or the
Boneficlaries Has It An
nulled.
Judge Seawell has annulled the agree
ment entered into by James Simpson and
Ada Simpson, his wife, whereby, to pre
vent, difficulties over th-_- distribution of
the property, it was deeded in trust to
James \V. Kerr. Judge Seawell holds that
the agreement was made to facilitate di
vorce, arid so was void as being against
public policy.
The suit was based upon a complaint
filed by Randolph Simpson, who, feeling
that he was not receiving the share which,
as a son of the contracting parties, he was
entitled to, commenced suit for a greater
proportion of the trust income than the
agreement allowed. His suit has been the
cause of knocking the trust out alto
gether.
MUST KEEP THE STATION
Police Quarters Located on Wash
ington Street, West
of Polk.
Garbage Franchise Not Awarded
to L. V. Merle, but Laid Over
for One Week.
The question as to whether or not the
Board of Supervisors should locate a po
lice station on Washington street, near
Polk, in the residence district, was the
subject of a warm discussion in the board
yesterday when the matter came up for
passage over the Mayor's veto.
M. J. Sullivan appeared for the property
owners to protest against the favorable
consideration of the measure. He inti
mated that there was a scheme some
where in the matter and said that he had
heard that the members had already made
up their minds to pass the ordinance in
spite of the veto and the almost unanimous
protest of the residents. He told of the
efforts that had been made to buy the lot
which is to be used and said that the
owner had been offered $7000 and later
$8500 for a lot which real estate dealers de
clared was not worth over $6600. He asked
the board to pause before it saddled a po
lice station with its attendant evils and
nuisances on one of the best districts of
the City and stated if the intention was
carried out the property in the neighbor
hood would depreciate to such an extent
as to cause a losn of thousands of dollars
to those who had invested their money in
homes in that district.
He called the proposed action an out?
rage and arraigned the board for its disre
gard of the wishes of .the people who had
elected it.
Supervisor Taylor also took the floor in
opposition to the measure, but when a
vote was called the necessary nine votes
were cast in favor of the ordinance, Super
visor Dimond voting with the majority
and Supervisors Spreckels, Taylor and
Hobbs voting to sustain the Mayor's veto.
Tha expected battle over the garbage
crematory franchise did not come to a
head, Supervisor Dimond, a member of
the Health and Police Committee, stating
that he had not had time to look into the
matter and that he believed that the
lowest and not the highest bid had been
accepted. He asked that the matter go
over for a week, a request that was granted.
The report of the committee appropriat
ing $11,000 to make a survey of the district
south of the park, and ordering the Super
intendent of Streets to draw up plans and
specifications for grading and sewering,
was adopted unanimously.
The board failed to take action on the
Pesthonse-site matter. The committee, in
its report, advocated the placing of the
hospital for contagious diseases on the
Almshouse tract, but as the Mayor has de
cided to continue his search for a suitable
site, it was concluded to give him further
time, and a delay of two weeks was
granted.
Supervisor Benjamin objected, but the
vote went against him, the Mayor an
nouncing the result in a voice that be
tokened great satisfaction.
A resolution was introduced directing
the Sheriff, in view of the bad
condition of Branch Jail No. 3, to re
move the females confined at that in
stitution to other places of incarceration
under his care as early as possible. As the
board desires to condemn the structure, a
delay of sixty days was asked for and
granted.
NO EXPLANATION.
Mrs. Brnner Did Not Appear at the Meet
ins of the Woman's Federation.
It had been announced that a delegation
of doctors from the Receiving Hospital
would attend the meeting of the Woman's
Federation yesterday afternoon and their
advent was momentarily expected all
through the proceedings.
No doctors materialized, however, 'and
the only man who entered the cbarmed
circle, which is usually closed to the
stern.er sex, was Rev. Carlos Martyn, who
took no part in the proceedings.
It was to protest against Mrs. Bruner's
report on the Receiving Hospital that the
doctors Were expected to attend the meet
ing. Mrs. Bruner did not put in an ap
pearance, Mrs. Fairbanks reporting for her
that she was too ill to come.
"Mrs. Bruner says she refuses to make
her renort;to any one but the Board of
Health," said Mrs. Fairbanks. "She wili
explain her repoTt to the ladies here
when she is able to come, but she will not
give any explanation to doctors from the
Receiving Hospital." Mrs. Rose French
stated that the federation, as an organiza
tion, was not responsible for Mrs. Bruner's
report on the Receiving Hospital.
A number of reports from committees
were received and Mrs. North, Mrs. Luse,
Mrs. Bates, Mrs. French, Mrs. Harnish,
Mrs. Matheson and Mrs. Wheeler were ap
pointed a nominating committee for per
manent officers. It was resolved to hold a
mass-meeting next Sunday, with Rev.
Carlos Martyn as the speaker. The fol
lowing ladies were appointed a committee
on the mass- meeting: Mrs. Lose, Mrs. Mc-
Coy. Mrs. J. M. Brown, Mrs. Payne, Miss
Smith, Mrs. Cook and Miss Wheeler.
Koenig 'Wins Second Prize.
Edward G. Koenig of this City entered the
bird which won the second prize in the race of
homing-pigeons on Sunday. Through an error
in computation this honor was yesterday ac
credited to George T. Marsh. Mr. Marsh's bird
was liberated at 9 o'clock Sunday morning at
Marysville. That of Mr. Koenig was not liber
ated till TO o'clock, an hour later. Marsh's
bird reached the cote at 3:46 o'clock, and that
of Koenig at 3 :s&}4 o'clock. Thus Mr. Koenig's
bird had occupied 57% minutes less in making
the flight than that of Mr. Marsh. A second
bird of Mr. Koenig's arrived half a minute after
the first oue.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1896.
FOR OAKLAND'S HARBOR
The Work That Is Yet to. Be Done
at the Estuary and the
Tidal Canal.
DR. M'LEAN AND CONGRESS.
Arguments That Will Be Used to Show
Why the Canal Should Be
Completed.
The prospect of securing the required
appropriation for the completion of the
Oaklandjharbor improvements has aroused
great interest and enthusiasm among the
shipping men and merchants across the
bay, and it is confidently expected that
within a year or two it will be possible to
run the largest of the ocean-going ships as
far as the foot of Broadway. ~
Then the improvement of the upper
harbor will be undertaken m earnest and
Oakland vs ill assert its claim to the title of
an actual seaport city.
The amount of money required to carry
out the present project of improvement,
according to an estimate made for the
Tribune, is $741,000, and the amount that
can be profitably expended in the next
Dr. J. T. McLean of Alamcda, Who Has Gone to Washington to Work for the Im
provement of Oakland Harbor.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
fiscal year is $300,000. If this money can
be obtained several of the separate works
can be carried on simultaneously; other
wise operations will have to be confined to
one or two of the branches.
The improvement plans prepared by the
Government engineers include two mud
tide training-walls of stone from the shore
westward into San Francisco Bay about
two miles, a connection by a canal one
and a half miles in length with the estu
ary of San Leandro, a dam at the mouth
of this estuary, and the dredging of basins
and channels to give a depth of twenty
feet at low tide, which at high tide will ac
commodate-vessels of the largest class.
Changes from the original plans call for
the increase of the tidal canal's width
from 300 feet to 400 feet and for a greater
height of the jetties.
The contract under which the work of the
present year, is being done calls for a low
water depth of twenty feet for a distance
of 4600 feet in front of Oakland. This is a
mean increase of about five feet in aepth,
nearly one-half of which work has been
done, the remainder to follow in the next
few months, after which it is expected to
extend the depth of twenty feet to San
Francisco Bay.
An immense amount of dredging has al
ready been done, but one drawback is that
the channel fills up again on account of
the lack of tides that should keep it clear.
During the past year alone there has been
a shoaling at the eastern portion of the
harbor by which a depth of eight feet has
been reduced to seven and one-half feet,
and the experts declare that the filling-up
process will extend all over the harbor un
til the tidal canal, intended to remedy
that trouble, is completed.
Captain yon Schmidt, who has done a
large portion of the dredging at Oakland,
declares that the channel will keep on fill
ing until the canal affords a current that
will carry the mud away. The dredging
that is now being done at great expense
to the Government will have to be done
all over again, and the only remedy is in
the canals.
Dr. J. T. McLean of Alameda, who has
been for many years eminent in the State
Board of Health work, has gone to
Washington to urge the appropriation of
money needed for this harbor worK, as
announced in The Call last week, his
special mission being to work for the com
pletion of the canal as a sanitary measure.
The arguments that Dr. McLean will
use are well understood. Oakland and
Alameda are among the best cities in the
world as far as sanitary conditions are
concerned, on account of the natural ad
vantages of location. There is not, how
ever, the current that is needed to keep
the water of Oakland harbor as it ought to
be, and in the Lake Merritt vicinity there
is almost actual stagnation.
The mouth of the creek, which is the
Oakland harbor outlet, is toward the west,
and the wind blowing so much of the
time from the westward prevents the out
ward flow of the surface water. The fresh
water, being lighter than the salt water, is
at the surface, and that, with its impuri
ties, is what is prevented by the wind
from freely (lowing out into the bbar.\ r .
If the tidal canal were completed, there
would be a continual, cleansing current,
and the sanitary conditions would be im
proved by the- same agency that would
keep the harbor- bed scoured out and iree
from mud.
Some of the business men want the
lower creek dredged out immediacy to
obtain the advantages of unobstructed
water navigation, but others insist that the
work ought to be carried on accoiding to a
system that will give the best general re
sults.
Senator Perkins and Congressman Hil
born are pledged to do all in their power
to obtain the needed appropriation, and it
is expected that they will succeed in get
ting at least $300,000 for the work to be
done during the next fiscal year.
The men who want the dredg ing of the
lower harbor done first have begun action
in opposition to Dr. McLean's project and
their arguments will be telegraphed to
Congressman Hilborn.
Two memorials were circulated in Oak
land yesterday. One is being signed by
city officials who are convinced that they
subscribed to the McLean memorial not
comprehending its meaning. The other
asks Congress to order the appropriation
to be spent in accordance with the recom
mendations of the Government Engineer.
The City Council, the Health Office and
the commercial bodies are much worked
up over the matter and are striving hard
to get the affair straightened out.
President Manuel of the Oakland City
Council is one of those in favor of dredg
ine; the lower creek first, and he said yes
terday :
" Dr. McLean's memorial is a peculiar
document. The first two-thirds are, to my
mind, the right thing, and having heard
tliat much, I concluded that it was all in
the same tenor. Having satisfied myself,
that the memorial did not express the
opinion of the people most interested in
it, I hastened to correct it. This morning
I received a letter from Dr. McLean, writ-
ten on the train, and he assures me that
his memorial shall not be used. I would
have felt better, however, if he had left it
behind. What is first needed undoubtedly
is to deepen the harbor so that there is
navigable water from all the wharves to
the bay and the -extension of the south
training wall.
"Dr. McLean's memorial provides for
dredging through the tidal canal and
making a great flusher of the estuary.
This is a splendid thing to do, but it is not
paramont at this time. "
"Senator Rose has pledged to us that
Dr. McLean will act witn the whole dele
gation and that nothing will be advocated
except the general idea of inducing Con
gress to appropriate as large an amount
as possible for the improvement of Cali
fornia harbors and rivers. Under these
circumstances I should feel justified in
recommending the Council to pay the $250
appropriated for Dr. McLean's expenses."
The new memorial setting forth what
Oakland officials desire starts out with the
following paragraph taken from the last
report of Colonel Mendell to tne Govern
ment:
"Extension by deep water to San Fran
cisco Bay is regarded as of the greatest rel
ative importance and together with it
the completion of the jetties."
The memorial further states that the
commerce of the port of Oakland would
be best subserved by dredging till there fs
at least twenty feet of water from the
end of the wharves to ship channel, and
that can be done for $200,000. All the city
officials of Oakland have signed it and all
who signed the McLean memorial have
also subscribed to the petition asking Con
gress to disregard the McLean document
Bhould it be presented.
The McLean memorial, taking a broad
view of the general improvements, starts
out by describing all the needs of Oakland
harbor, including dam and floodgates for
the tidal canal. It refers to the needs of
dredging Oakland harbor and contains a
summary of all that is required to im
prove the whole of the harbor.
The McLean. memorial says:
To the end that the tidal canal and floodgate
may be completed and this great expense of
dredging and most desirable improvement in
the sanitary condition of 100,000 people be
accomplished, representing these people and
aware of tlieir sanitary needs, we respectfully
ask that an. appropriation of $500,000 be made
at this session of Congress to complete the tidal
canal and floodgate, and that it be specifically
applied, In the terms of the rive* and harbor
appropriation bill, to these special parts of
Oakland harbor. We are informed by Colonel
Mendell, United States civil engineer, lately in
charge of construction of Oakland harbor,
that this sum will complete and bridge the
tidal canal and construct the dam and flood
gate.
If It is found to be impossible to secure an
appropriation of the above-named amount
then the unoersigried would urge that as large
an appropriation as possible be made for the
harbor, and that by the terms of the appropria
tion the amount appropriated be directed to
be expended in building the tidal canal in said
harbor.
Acknowledged by All.

AT A DAFFODIL WEDDING
Nuptials of Edward Pond and
Miss Isabelle Grant Last
Evening.
ARTISTIC HOME DECORATIONS.
Rare Old Laces and Silver for the
Bride â Gowns Worn by the
Bridal Party.
St. Luke's, the pretty little church on
Van Ness avenue, was crowded last even
ing by a fashionable audience assembled
to witness the nuptials of Miss Isabelle
Grant, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles
Watson Grant, and Edward Pond, son of
ex-Mayor and Mrs. Pond.
Long before the hour announced for the
ceremony, 8:30 o'clock, the invited guests
began to arrive and much praise 19 due to
the ushers for the happy manner in which
they discharged their arduous duties. St.
Luke' 8 lends itself readily to decorators,
though the cozey little edifice requires but
little in the way of floral arrayment. Pot
ted palms only were used to decorate the
church and daffodils made a most artistic
altar decoration.
Promptly at the hour announced the
strains of the wedding march announced
the arrival of the bridal party. First came
the ushers, Messrs. Phillip Thornton,
Henry Whson, Charles F. Grant, Samuel
Pond, Charles Furquaharson and Alpheus
Clement. Directly behind them, and pre
ceding the bride, who entered leaning on
the arm of her father, walked the maid of
honor, Miss Fanny Grant. The groom,
accompanied by his Dest man, Albion
White, met his bride at the altar, where
the Rev. Dr. Brewer of San Mateo, assisted
by Rev. VV. W. Moreland, rector of St.
Lukes, united the happy young coupte.
After the ceremony the bridal party, rel
atives and a limited number of invited
guests repaired to the residence of the
bride's parents. 2017 Lyons street, where
an informal reception was held.
At the home the decorations were sim
ple, but extremely artistic. That skillful
decorator, Miss Mary Bates, had entire
charge of the arrangements, and the re
sults were more than pleasing. In the
drawing-rooms acacia-lilled vases and
bowls scented the rooms with the sweet
breath of spring fields. In the basement,
where the supper was served, great palm
leaves skillfully concealed the walls and
converted the many corners into seem
ingly enchanted arbors.
Multi-colored lanterns in all varieties of
shapes, some swinging from the ceiling,
shed a soft light over the pretty scene.
The toilets of the ladies were all ex
tremely handsome. The brideâ a dainty
and petite brunette â looked extremely well
in ncr elegant white satin gown. The
jupe, exquisite in its rich simplicity, was
made perfectly plain in the- prevailing !
flowing style. The corsage was trimmed I
with a most superb bertha of rare old lace
that had done similar duty on the gowns
of the bride's grandmother and mother.
The two long ends fell almost to the hem
of the jupe, and the many little flounces of
the "set" almost completely hid the full
elbow sleeve.
â J."he bridal veil was fastened to the coif
fure by a diamond pin, the gift of the
groom I
Miss Fanny Grant, the maid of honor,
wore a gown of yellow satin. The yoke
was made dancing length and the corsage
and elbow sleeves were draped with chif
fon. Miss Grant carried a bouquet of daf
fodils.
Mrs. Grant, mother of the bride, wore a
handsome gown of black brocaded silk,
trimmed with point.
Mrs. Pond, the mother of the groom, was
attired in an elegant gown of pale pink
brocade. The. full yoke was made per
fectly plain and a bertha of duchesse lace
ornamented the bodice.
Miss McNeil, aunt of the groom, wore a
very elegant gown of white satin. The
skirt was full and flowing in the prevailing
picturesque style. The bodice was covered
with soft folds of mull and knots of cerise
velvet at the throat and belt lent a daÂ«h of
color to the exquisite gown. Miss Sbep
aru, cousin of the groom, wore a dainty
gown of light blue uresden silk brocaded
with pale pink rosebuds and trimmed with
pearl passementerie.
Mr. and Mrs. Pond received many costly
and elegant presents. The gift of tlie
bride's parents consisted of several pieces
of rare old plate, that had been handed
down from mother and daughter for the
past six generations. Mr. and Mrs. Pond
presented the young couple with a coin
plate silver service of exquisite design and
delicate workmanship.
THE WINNER IS A BOY.
Art School Teachers Defeated
in Competition With Their
Own Pupil.
How the Mardi Gras Ticket Afforded
an Opportunity for Young
Sidney Armer.
There has been considerable discussion
and comment on the action of the execu
tive committee of the Mardi Gras enter
tainment of the Art Association in select
ing a design for a ticket, which, it is
claimed, was submitted by Edward
Bosqul, the well-known lithographer. AH
artists were invited to suumit designs
without their names, so that the choice of
the committee would be impartial and on
the merits of the work.
Mr. Bosqui was not present at the
meeting, said an officer yesterday, being
confined at his house by illness, and he
knew nothing of what was going on.
There were four designs submitted and
the one selected was full of life and the
spirit of the carnival and full of color,
while the others reproduced dull effects
with all tne figures at rest and which are
now conceded to be, by those competent
to judge, as inappropriate, although
equally artistic. They lailed to catch the
spirit of the occasion.
But of course artists were disappointed
that the prize should have gone to a litho
graphic establishment, for when the se
lection was made the committee was in
formed that the Bosqui firm claimed the
winning design. It aid not take the com
mittee long, however, to decide that the
winner was fairly in the competition be
cause it was evidently the work of an
artist, whether he was regularly employed
by the lithographer or whether he was
seeking employment for this special work.
Now it turns out that the winning de
sign was really made by a clever student
of the Art Association itself, Sidney
Armer, by name. This young man has
been a student some time at the Art As
sociation and occasionally gets orders from.
Mr. Bosqui to do such work as this. In
the secrecy of the competition it was
thought that the design came from a pro
fessional, whereas it was submitted by the
association's own pupil. The artists now
feel in better humor when they know that
one of the boys to whom they imparted
their knowledge entered the competition
and carried off the prize.
"This proves the benefit of the competi
tive system," said the association officer,
"which the arts and crafts have been try
ing to force upon the University Regents,
the Park Commissioners and other public
bodies, which could well emulate the ex
ample set by the Art Association in its
own affairs. The card will be sent to the
invited guests of the Mardi Gras ball and
to all persons whose names are approved
by the invitation committee, which, by
the way, is private, and there is consider
able interest being manifested in what it
looks like."
ROBBED IN A SALOON.
Unpleasant Experience of Frank Bar
zouri of Asti, Sonoma County.
Frank Barzouri, a member of the Swiss-
Italian Colony at Asti, Sonoma Cir.inty,
arrived ia the City on Saturday to spend a
few days in seeing the sights. He had
$100 in gold with him and now he is with
out a cent.
On Saturday evening he met a man
named De Martini, and together they
went to a saloon on Broadway, where they
had several drinks. Barzouri became
stupid from the effects of the vile liquor,
and was taken into a back room where he
was beaten and robbed. He was then
thrown into the street, and was arrested
on a charge of drunkenness.
Barzouri cannot speak English, but
with the help of an interpreter he told his
story in the City Prison yesterday morn
ing.'and was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Bunnell sewed up two or
three wounds in his scalp. He then swore
out a warrant for De Martini's arrest on
the charge of robbery.
ALMOST ENDED IN A ROW
A Stormy Meeting of the Board
of Election Commis
sioners.
Exception Taken to Startling State
ments That Were Made by
Mayor Sutro.
The first meeting of the old Board of
Election Commissioners since the Supreme
Couri decided that the board appointed by
Mayor Sutro was not entitled to the office
of commissioners came near breaking up
in a row, because of the friction between
Mayor Sutro and Auditor Broderick.
Mayor Sutro's feelings regarding the com
mission are well known, and he makes no
pretense of concealing them.
The meeting had hardly been called to
order yesterday morning when his Honor
remarked that the decision of the supreme
Court declaring the old board, wh-ich con
sists of the Mayor, Auditor, Tax Collector,
City and County Attorney and City Survey
or, the legal boaid, was a public calamity
and that had the Supreme Court sustained
his appointees honest elections would have
been possible.
Auditor Broderick took exception to the
statement, believing it to be a reflection on
the members present.
"What do yon mean by that?" he de
manded. "Do you say that I am not as
honest a man "as any member of that
board?"
"Oh, I don't mean that," the Mayor
hastened to say, "but elections have been
badly not to say dishonestly conducted,
and I hoped that under the rule of a
strictly non-partisan board many abuses
would be remedied."
City and County Attorney Creswell took
umbrage at this statement, saying:
"Do you mean that this board is incom
petent? I will not contradict that state
ment as far as you are concerned, but I do
not want any such statements made re
garding myself."
The business of the meeting went on
for a brief period, until the Mayor added
fresh fuel to the fire by saying :
"Huntington owns this City, but you will
see that he will not elect his own officials
at the coming election as he did at the i
last."
"Who was elected by Huntington?" de
manded Broderick and Creswell in a
breath.
"â¢I was elected and so were you," said
Broderick, "do you mean to say that he
had any hand in my election? Perhaps he
did in yours."
The Mayor glared at this, but Broderick
continued :
"You are a very rich man, Mr. Mayor,
but you can't run this board or me."
Mr. Sutro said something about the
bosses dictating the elections if Hunting
ton did not, and Mr. Broderick fla~^d up
again.
"I don't know that Buckley is any more
of a boss than you are trying to be," he
said.
The discussion between the Mayor,
Auditor and Attorney became so
heated that the latter two, with
Surveyor Tilton, pot up aud started
to leave the meeting, but were prevailed
upon to stay until the payment of the
debts accumulated by the illegal board
had been disposed of.
The board was divided on this question.
Auditor Broderick and Attorney Creswell
believing that the salaries of those ap
pointed by the ousted Commissioners
could not be legally paid. The majority
prevailed, however, and unless Auditor
Broderick refuses to sign the warrants the

Before the meeting adjourned Mayor
Sutro announced that he did not think he
would be able to attend any more of the
gatherings of the commission, but would
send a substitute.
"He will not be recognized," promptly
answered Mr. Broderick. "If you could
send a substitute so could Mr. Creswell,
Mr. Block, Mr. Tilton and myself, and we
would soon have a board of deputies."
The Mayor said nothing more and the
meeting adjourned.
A PIOTUBE OP SHAKESPEAEE,
It May Be That the Poet Sat for
This One.
'If we can trust the "Willra. Shakes
peare, 1609," in the left upper corner of
the portrait of the poet now for a few days
at the Antiquaries in Burlington House,
we have at last an authentic picture of the
bard in his habit as he lived. For, on
comparing this oil painting with the
Droeshout engraving in the ftrst folio,
every one must see that the two are sub
stantially the same. At first sight the
spectator feels convinced that the portrait i
is by a poor artist, who tried to
:econcile the engraving and the
Stratforft bust, for the face ia rather
shorter and broader, more jowly, than the
engravine. and the braid on the coat
slightly differs. And if the date, 1609, is
laterâ as our correspondent thinks it is â
this view will be held permanently. But
if the date is genuine, the conclusion must
be that the portrait has no pedigree to
speak of. In 1892 the widow of Charles
Flower of Stratford-on-Avon bought it of
a member of the Clements family in War
wickshire and gave it to the Shakespeare
Memorial at Stratford, which her husband
built ana endowed with very little outside
help. The tradition in the Clements fam
ily is that the picture came to them from
a descendant of Shakespeare. This is very
vague. We should have expected any
genuine portrait of the poet to have been
in the possession of his granddaughter.
Lady Barnard, and in that of her husband
at Abingdon Hall, Northampton, after
her death. But the portrait speaks for it
self. Ben Jonson guaranteed the likeness
of the engraving; that guarantees the like
ness of the portrait. Whether the latter
was made from Shakespeare himself de
pends on the genuineness of the date 1609.
Our correspondent as we have snid dis
believes in the genuineness but holds the
picture to be of the seventeenth century
and made up from the Droeshout engrav
iag and the bust. The frame is old enough,
though later than the picture.âWestmin

NON-PARTISANS MAY ACT
Chairman Magee of the Cam
paign Committee Will
Not Issue a Call.
STEWART MENZIES TO THE FORE
Vice-President Frank J. Sullivan Will
Probably Act and Convoke
the Committee.
A movement is on foot to organize for
political activity theNon-Partisan party of
1894. A request to the chairman of the
campaign committee, Thomas Magee, was
made by Captain Stewart Menzies a few
days ago for the purpose of calling that
committee together. This Mr. Magee de
clined to do.
"I have no time to give to this busi
ness," he said. "I am too busy with my
own affairs. I told Captain Menzies so
when he requested me to issue the call.
"He was chairman of the last conven
tion and he can issue the call if he wishes.
I will not. That's ali there is about it."
F. J. Sullivan, vice-president of the cam
paign committee, was asked whether he
intended to issue a call for a meeting of
the committee. He replied:
"Yes, I will. Mr. Magee is a very busy
man and no doubt he has no time to give
to politics this year. I being vice-presi
dent of the campaign committee have a
rltht to issue a call, which I will do some
day this week.
"Captain Menzies, the chairman of the
last convention, has spoken to me about
doing so and I have consented on the
matter.
"Some may think that this being a Pres
idential year we should not put a Non-
Partisan party ticket in the field. But
with those I disagree. There is a neces
sity for such a party. Just look at the eight
Supervisors who now govern this City.
See the enormous t*axation that the people
are saddled with. There is no reduction
in the water rates, but rather an increase,
when the number of hydrants that have
been put down during the year is con
sidered. The Call published not long
since an article on this subject that showed
what was being done in that direction by
the Supervisors and the Spring Valley
Water Company.
"We think we will be able to elect a
Board of Supervisors that will look after
the interests of the people instead of after
the interests of the corporations."
Captain Menzies reiterated these senti
ments by saying:
"There never was greater necessity for a
taxpayers' or Non-Partisan party than
there is this year.
"I asked Mr. Magee to call the cam
paign committee together, but he declined
on the ground of having no time, so I
went to Frank Sullivan ana he consented
to issue the call, which will be done, and
then we will go to Work right away and
organize all over the City. In addition to
putting municipal officers *Â»efore tbe peo
ple we will nominate Senators and Assen -
blymen who will represent the people and
not the bosses and the corporations.
"We mean to go ahead, president or" no
president. This City must take a firm
stand for good government. This mast be
done -first, by passing the proposed char
ter, and secondly, by electing men to office
who are not owned by the corrupt bosses
and grinding corporations.
"We mean business. That's all there is
to it."
