THE BILL TO BE REPORTED.
No Relief to the Coast Will Be Given
in the Measure Prepared by the
Joint Committee.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 30.â The
joint sub-committee of the Senate and
House on Pacific railroads has completed
a bill which will be reported to the full
committees of both houses at their next
meeting, and with the exception of some
changes of little importance it will un
doubtedly be reported in the Senate and
House at an early date.
The bill is divided into two parts, that
referring to the Union Pacific and
branches and that relating to the Central
Pacific.
For the Central Pacific and Western
Pacific companies the bill requires the
Treasury Department to determine their
indebtedness as it will stand on the first
day of 1897. Precise directions for this are
made at length. The companies must de
liver to the Secretary of the Treasury a
mortgage to bear date of January 1, 1897,
for the full amount of indebtedness and
covering the entire property of said com
panies of any and all description, real, per
sonal or mixed, or in securities and all
beneficial interests which it may have in
the lease of its property to the Southern
Pacific Company.
An inventory of all said properties shall
be filed at the Treasury Department. This
mortgage shall be he id as security for the
payment of the principal of the debt and
the interest on bonds.
The Central Pacific Company is to issue
bc:iJÂ» in an amount equal to the full in
debtedness of the roads. These bonds
shall be of $1000 each, to bear interest at
2 per cent per annum payable semi-annu
vith the Ist of July, 1897,
at,<i c-"rit'nulncr with ttie life of the bona.
The bonds shall be delivered to the Secre
tary of the Treasury as provisional pay
ment of the indebtedness. The corporate
character of the Central Pacific Com pan y
shall continue until the bonds shall have
been fully paid.
The Central Pacific Company shall on
the Ist of January of each year fora period
of ten years, commencing January 1, 1898.
pay into the treasury in addition to the
interest then due on its indebtedness, the
siim of Â£300,000 per annum, and for a
period of ten years following it shall pay
in addition to the interest $500,000 per an
num, and thereafter, in like manner, com
mencing January 1, 1888, it shall pay an
nually $730,000, until the whole amount of
the bonds shall have been paid.
These payments shall be applied to Ihe
redemption of bonds of the Central Pacific
in the order of the numbers of such bonds,
beginning with the highest unpaid num
ber, and no other bonds under said mort
gage shall be issued by the company in
lieu thereof. As soon as all the bonds
have been redeemed the total indebtedness
BhalJ be wholly discharged, and the Secre
tary of the Treasury shall discharge the
mortgage.
The statutory lien now subsisting under
the acts of Congress approved July, 1862,
July 2, 1864 and May 7, 1878, is to stay in
force for the security of the Government
debts until all liens on the property af
fected by the company's mortgage shall
have been paid and discharged. When
ever the President of the United States
shall deem it necessary for the preserva
tion of the security of the United States
in respect to its mortgage or other
interest in any of the company's property
named in this act, upon which paramount
title is held by the United States, the Sec
retary of the Treasury may be authorized
by him to redeem any such paramount
title or other incumberanee by paying the
sum due thereon out of the treasury, and
the United States shall thereupon be sub
rogated to all rights pertaining to the
deots of the title when tuch payment shall
have been made.
It is provided that in such case of pay
ment by the United States repayment may
be required from the company of all money
paid for such purpose, with costs; and if
the company fails to make such re pay
ments within one year after notification
the entire indebtedness of said company
may become due and payable, and all the
Government's rights thereon shall be en
forced.
The Central Pacific Company is allowed,
without injury to the present lien thereof,
to extend the payment of, or refund, by
issuing new bonds secured by mortgage,
any of its indebtedness authorized by sec
tion 10 of the act of July 2, 1864, as
amended by the act of March 3, 186 a, at a
lower rate of interest than it now bears,
not to exceed S per cent, payable semi-an
nually. Should tnere be default continu
ing for six months in the regular pay
ments of interest on bonds or of principal
required in this act, the entire
debt due tne Government shall, at
the option of the President, imme
diately mature, and the United State* may
take possession of the mortgaged prop
erties of such companies without applying
to court or Congress, or may institute pro
ceedings in any court of competent juris
diction to enforce its claim. The bonds
muet include such stipulations as shall
B.;cure said bonds and the application
thereto of the money paid to the Govern
ment, these to be approved by tbe Secre
tary o f the Treasury. Certified duplicates
of boii'is snail be kept for public inseer
tion an : shall be placed for that purpose
with the clerk of the Circuit Court of ihe
United States and of tlie Superior Court of i
The San Francisco Call.
territories wherever any part of the rail
road lines concerned traverse their do
main.
While any bonds ivmain unpaid no
dividend shall be declared by the com
pany which issued the same, unless really
earned, nor unless the company shall have
paid all the interest due on the debt hav
ing a lien prior to the Government and all
matured installments of the principal and
interest (hen due on the Government debt,
nor unless said earnings snail warrant
such dividends.
Dividends of more than 4 per cent shall
not be paid unless an amount equal to
siioh excess over 4 percent shall be paid to
the treasury to be applied to the redemp
tion of bonds. Fines and penalties are
provided for any action subverting this
requirement. The act is to go into effect
upon the written acceptance of its
terms being tiled with the Secretary
of the Treasury on or before January 1.
1807; for the Union Pacific Railroad, and
within three nonths after the passage in
the case of the Central Pacific, subject,
however (as to the Central Pacific), to the
adjustment of the debt as provided for.
The Central Pacific is required to change
the terms of the lease of its road to the
Southern Pacific Company. The latter
company must guarantee the payment by
the Central Pacific Company daring the
continuation of such lease of the interest
and installments on the principal of the
bonds provided for in this act. The modi
tied lease shall be worded, that should the
Southern Pacific Company agree to ter
minate it before the payment of the debt
it shall guarantee that the Central Pacific
Company pays such interest and install
ments while any of such bonds remain un
paid.
The lease shall require that sums
amounting to about $2,439,000, now
credited in the treasury to the Central
Pacific Company for services rendered on
non-aided lines, a portio'i of which is now
in the judgment in favor of the Southern
Pacific Company, shall immediately be
applied to the cancellation of the bonds
as herein provided for.
A duplicate original of the modified
lease shall be riled at the Treasury Depart
ment by the Central Pacific. Should the
lease be abrogated by the parties thereto
the principal of the bonds shall, at the
option of the President, mature at once.
As long as the bonds are owned by the
Government any of the railroad com
panieÃ may redeem the whole of them.
The United States will sell any of the
bonds at any time for not less than their
face value and accrued interest.
"When this act is accepted the Govern
ment directors are wiped out and all the
laws relating to the collection of any per
centage of the net earnings or to the with
holding or application of any sums due to
the Government other than provided for
in the bill shall end.
The railroad companies must transmit
dispatches over their telegraph lines, and
mails, troops, munitions, public supplies
and stores whenever called upon, allowing
the preference to the Government at all
times, and the Government shall pay a
reasonable price, not greater than what
would be charged private parties.
The Attorney-General shall enforce this
act and shall report to the President
every year (or oftener) thereon, which re
port shall be transmitted to Congress.
This act is to be subject to alteration or
repeal at the hands of Congress, and noth
ing contained in it shall impair any right
or remedy in the premises now existing in
favor of the Government.
The provisions of the Union Pacific Com
pany require that its mortgage shall em
brace all property, terminals, land and
everything pertaining to it, real personal,
or in security. Interest and principal on
its bonds are arranged on the same basis
as is shown in the foregoing for the Cen
tral Pacific Company. It may issue a cer
tain amount of stock, provided that from
the proceeds of the same all existing
bonds upon its property or lands or hold
ings be extinguished and all mortgages
cancelled.
Such new mortgages as are authorized in
the bill must be a new lien on the property
of the railroad covered by existing mort
gages and the second mortgage authorized
in the bill to be made to the Government
shall be junior and subject to no other lien
than the new first mortgage. The Union
Pacific may execute its bonds under date
of January 1, 1897, to mature January 1,
1947. Interest is not to exceed 4 per cent
and principal not to exceed the
face of the amount of the out
standing first mortgage bonds prior to
the lien of the United States on subsidized
pirts of its railway, and those secured by
mortgages constituted for liens on parts of
some or on terminal properties, equipment
or upon lands of said company and those
secured by "mortgage upon the Omaha
bridge, aggregating $54, 731,000.
Bonds must be secured by a firÃt mort
gage upon all properties, terminalor other
wise, and all the then unsold land grant
lands and all the then outstanding lands
and all other property shall be included in
such existing mortgages of the Union Pa
cifi Railroad Company and upon all of its
rights, titles, privileges and franchises.
The Union Pacific may issue its pre
ferred stock to not more than its present
stock ; but no dividends shall be paid upon
it over 4 per cent nor except out of such
net or surplus earnings as shallte acquired
by the company in that year of the divi
dend and as shall remain after the pay
ment of operating expenses and interest
upon new first mortgage bonds and on the
fixed annual sums required to be paid upon
its second mortgage bonds.
Should the railroad and property of the
Union Pacific Company contemplated to
be included in the new mortgage be sold
under pendinc foreclosure proceedings, or
other proceedings, but subject to all the
existing liens of the United States, or
parts thereof, the purchasers of said rail
way and other property who shall have
acquired the same, subject to Government
liciiF, and who shall have filed with the
Secretary of the Treasury their written
acceptance of this act within the time
limited, or within such extended time not
exceeding six months as may be pre
scribed by the President of the United
States, shall be, together with their asso
ciates and their successors, created a cor
poration by name and style of the Union
Pacific Railroad Company.
These purchasers and their associates
must file with the Secretary of the Treas
ury a written instrument executed by
them as incorporators indicating fifteen
persons who shall act as directors of said
corporation, and such persons so desig
nated, or a majority of them, shall meet
within thirty nays afttr the filing of such

Why the War Secretary Thinks
the Lieutenant Generalship
Should Not Be Revived.
NEVER COMMANDED AN ARMY
Gallant Record of the Man Who Was
Not in West Point Is Skimmed
Over.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 30.â The
letter of Secretary of War Lamont, re
turning to General Hawley, chairman of
the Senate Committee on Military Affairs,
without approval, a bill pending before
that committee bestowing upon General
Nelson A. Miles, the General commanding
the army, the grade of lieutenant-general,
was to-day made public. Accompanying
the letter were voluminous extracts from
the military records of Generals Scott,
Grant, Sherman, Sheridan and Schotield,
wbo held tne grade of lieutenant-general,
and of Generals Miles, Ruger and Merritt.
The letter follows:
War Department, Office of the Secretary J
Washington, March 5, 189.t>. j
. Hon. Joseph R. Hawlcy, Chairman Committee
on Military Affaire, United States Senateâ Sir:
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
through your reference of Senate bill 113,
also Senate resolutions 41 and 81, now pend
ing in the present session of the Fifty-third
Congress, and relating to the revival or be
stowal by assignment of the grade of lieuten
ant-general. In response to your request for
information and remarks respecting these
measures I respectfully submit the following:
Since the organization of the Government
but six officers of the army have held the grade
of lieutenant-general and in no instance has
an officer attained this rank until lie has suc
cessfully commanded the whole or separate
army in battle and campaign. The grade was
created in 1708, when a Commander was to be
provided for an army expected to be required
in the impending war with France. Washing
ton, who had been general-in-chief throughout
the seven years' war of independence and had
been eight years President, wasrhost-n to fill
the position. Fortunately the expected hos
tilities were averted, only a small part of the
army was enrolled and the necessity for a com
mander-in-elnef was of short duration. The
office ceased to exist fn December, 1799, with
the death of Lieutenant-General Washington.
The grade has been revived three times since
its first creation and always with the object of
conferring complimentary rank upon generals
who had rendered "eminent and distinguished
services" or those "most distinguished for
courage, skill and ability' 1 in war. Five be
sides Washington were thus honored, of whom
four had received the thnnks of Congress by
name for most distinguished military service,
wails the fifth had commanded a separate
army during the late war, had attained the
highest regular grade thirty years before his
promotion, had held the chief command of
the whole regubir army for seven years
und had successfully discharged most
delicate and responsible military and
civil duties. The officers promoted in pursu
ance of the statutes reviving the grade of lieu
tenant-general were Major-Generals Scott,
Grant, Sherman, Sheridan and Schofleld. The
promotion of General Scott was not authorized
until eight years after the service thus recog
nized was rendered, and General bcaofleld's |
! advancement was postponed until the eve of
: his retirement from active duty. Lieutenant
! General Sherman while on his deathbed was
promoted to general. The reorganization act
of 1806 fixed the strength of the army at sixty
i regiments, and the corps, of general officers
â  consisted of General Grant, one, lieutenant-
I general, Sherman; five major-generals,, Ha
l! leek, Meade, Sheridan, Thomas ! and Hancock,
! end ten brisradier-eeneral*. Powell,' Cooke,
Pope, Hooker, Schofield, J-r^tfard, Terry, Ord,
Canby and ' Rousseau.-. }â .{**/ "â  '
lint four year* later force v.cÂ« reduced
to forty regiments, the major-generals were re
duced to three, the brigadiers to six and the
grades of general and â¢ lieutenant-general,
when next vacated, were not again to be con
ferred. At the time of the enactment of this
statute forbidding further promotion to lieu
tenant-general there still served on active duty
several officers who had successfully . com
manded the whole army, separate armies or
army corps during the Civil War, and as such
had rendered most distinguished services, but
the power to reward by further promotion
such men as Halleck, Meade, Hancock and
others was deliberately taken away. -It
was enacted in 1870, during the administra
tion of President Grant, that the offices then
held by Sherman and Sheridan, when next
vacated should .not be filled. The, present
major-generals of the army attained brilliant
reputations for gallantry while commanding
subdivisions of army corps during the late
conflict and have added to their laurels since
by efficient performance of arduous ; service
upon the Indian frontier but it is no reflection
upon these excellent officers to say that the
services they â¢ have so far rendered are not of
that exalted character that has hitherto been
regarded as a prerequisite to the advancement
now proposed: â¢
Noting that the grade of lieutenant-general
has not been, regarded as a permanent office
necessary to our "army organization, and has
been conferred t only ; upon a few officers who
have rendered marked service in war; that tha
complimentary rank, when bestowed, has
often been withheld until years after the de
monstration of their superior ability, and has
only been voted as a reward of great military
genius and a conspicuous leadership, the con
clusion is reached that whatever the merits
and promise of any officer of our peace estab
lishment they will as yet have no'opportunity to
demonstrate their genius and capacity as com
manders of large armies, but the measures here
tofore required and the existing conditions do
not demand its revival at this time. Very re
spectfully. .! .- . â¢ I '.-â¢â¢, ' . .

Plantation.
OUTRAGE CLASSED AS VICTORY.
Cuban Insurgents Declared to Be More
in Need of Arms Than
Sympathy.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 30.â The rebel
leader, Eprique Aleman, was shot this
morning in the Cabanas fortress. Other
executions will take place this week.
General Melguizo had an encounter yes
terday with a rebel party under the leader
Aguirre at a point one kilometer south of
Bninoa, between Havana and Matanzas.
One Spanish captain and three soldiers
were wounded with machetes. Eighteen
rebels are reported killed.
Here is the story of the three brothers
Farrar, all American citizens and joint
owners of the coffee plantation Estrella in
Havana province, near Alquizar. It does
not differ greatly from the experiences of
many other owners of estates in the inte
rior, but as these men happen to be Amer
icans and have made sworn statements
protesting against the excesses committed
by Spanish troops and demanding dam
ages, the affair has become one of official
record. The papers are now in the hands
of Consul-General Williams. Miguel Far
rar, one of the brothers, has furnished me
with a copy of his statement. It is as fol
lows:
â¢'On Saturday, March 21, the dwelling
house of the coffee plantation Estrella
was the oDject of a wanton attack by the
column of General Bernal, operating in
that region. The said building received
cannon shots of grace and cannisier,
breaking the doors, one window, several
piazza columns and greatly endangering
the lives of the families of my brothers,
Don T.i sco and Don Luis Farrar, both
American citizens. There were two small
children la the house. From information
it appears that the troops mentioned
had sustained fire with a rebel band
in Paz plantation, a quarter of a
league from Eatrella. The rebels hav
ing flea toward Buena Esperanza
Plantation, the Government troops
advanced toward Estrella. in quite an op
posite direction from that taken by the
rebels. On arriving at the borders of Es
trella plantation the Spanish troops began
firing cannon at the dwelling-houoe and
we were immediately invaded by soldiers
who ransacked the house, carrying off
wardrobes, all jewelry, men's clothing, as,
well as the sum of $60 in money. They
also took away everything found in
the workmen's dwellings, arresting at the
same time twelve of the occupants whom
they conducted to Alquizar as insurgents.
It should be observed that the cannon
were fired soleiy at the dwelling-house of
the ownera, although there were twenty
other buildings on the plantation and the
place was entirely clear of insurgents.
In consideration of all the above, and
particularly on account of the danger to
which his relations were exposed, and also
for the unjustifiable looting on the part of
of the regular troops in the service of a
constituted Government, the undersigned"
does most solemnly protest and asks an
immediate indemnity for the damages
suffered, which he values at $5000, as all
work has been stopped on the plantation
and everything abandoned.
The Spanish official account of what
happened qn the Estrella plantation is as
follows:
"The column of General Bernal found
several bands of rebels, who made them
selves strong in the house of the planta
tion Estrella, where they were beaten, and
by artillery shots and cavalry charges the
enemy were dislodged from their position.
Twelve were captured, besides arms, am
munition and instruments to destroy rail
road tracks. It is believed by the trails
of blood seen that the rebels had many
doad and wounded. All the prisoners will
be summarily court-martialeu." ,
On Wednesday twenty prisoners, taken
in the recent operations around Artemisia
and Alquizar, arrived in Havana. On
being escorted through Obispo street to
the palace they were followed by a mob,
who shouted "Viva Espana" and "Death
to the rebels!" The men were kicked,
beaten, and one had his head cut open by
a flying missile. It was a pitiful sight to
see the poor wretches with arms pinioned
and a mob at their heels shouting for
blood. By the time the prisoners reached
the palace the mob numbered between 200
and 300. General Ahumada, the second
chief of the Government, came out and
ordered the guards to disperse the mob.
' General Weyler has had several inter
views with Jose Maria Calves and other
leaders ol the Autonomist party. He asked
if it was true that the party intended re
maining away from ths polls in the com
ing election. Senor Calves said no de
cision had yet been reached. General
Weyler then said:
"If you do not take part in the elections
it will be because you are enemies to
Spain, but have not sufficient valor to go
to the held. I will guarantee your party
three Deputies, and in case you do not
take part in the elections I shall treat you
as I treat our enemies."
In all probability the Autonomists will
go to the polls. The reformists still say
they will not take part in the elections.
During the past week the principal war
news has been the destruction of the
c;imps, hospitals and strongholds ef the
insurgents in Siguanca Valley, near the
Cienaga. and at Los Palos. While Maceo
wa.s in the west and Gomez moving east,
columns acting under special ordprs have
razed these camps and many wounded
lebels have fallen into the hands of the
Spanish troops. J. Frank Clark.
REBELS WELL ORGANIZED.

*vT: ler- for Hi* Blunder*.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 30.â Elbert
Rappelve, the Cuban correspondent of
the Mail and Express, who was recently
expelled from Havana, arrived here to
day on the steamer Yucatan. In an inter
view with a reporter of the United Press
Mr. Rappelye said :
.'. "I come ' bacK from Cuba as a deportado
of General Weyler. * In his ( decree ex
pelling"â  me from â¢â  the island â¢. I :am
called an enemy of ' Spain, that
charge being based on letters pub
lished in the Mail and Express over my
signature. Any person familiar with ex
isting conditions in the island of Cuba
will know that the only enmity, if any,
I've shown toward Spain has been in tell
ing the truth without fear or prejudice. \
This, of course, has resulted in my expul
sion. As an impartial observer sent to
Cuba to study and inform myself and re
port the progress of events there without
restriction having been placed upon me
when I accepted the mission, I unhesitat
ingly wrote that within throe months the
insurgent cause would be triumphant if
the United States Government . would
grant the belligerency rights and give the
Cubans anything like a fighting opportu
tunity.
"The Spanish are now on the defensive.
Every . battle fought in Cuba in the past
thirty days has been invited by the rebels.
They have more ammunition now than
they have ever had, and if they can main
tain a source of supply there is not any
thing that can prevent them from winning.
General Weyler has been Spain's greatest
mistake in the war. â ; His name and repu
tation carries an odium which attracted
the attention of the world. The best evi
dence! of his bad generalship is bis com
plete failure to hold the insurgent armies
back after they .had; left the western
provinces of Cuba. Maceo started bis
western 'campaign, which is now com
plete, with 15,000 men, one-third of whom
had not a single "arm to right with. Those
who had guns went into Catties with one
or two cartridges and fought, knowing
that unless they captured the enemy's
ammunition they would have nothing to j
fight with the next day. ' They are coming
back now with the whole cargo from the
Bermuda and General .Weyler is S.'with
drawing the Spanish defenses from at
least one-half of the principal points of the
island to bar, their progress. f'_ \'_', '
"This leaves Gomez with a larger army
than Maceo, practically unrestricted to do
as he pleases in three-quarters of the area
of Cuba, while the barrier which Weyler
is attempting to place before Maceo is ac
knowledged by one of his own generals
with whom I talked before my departure,
to be much stronger numerically than
Maceo's army, notwithstanding the fact that
in all tl>e invasions heretofore the Spanish
have unsuccessfully attempted to prevent
them with the numbesr in their favor, of
at least 4 to 1. While there have been
doubts, perhaps justified, about the military
organization of the rebel armies, they
need not exist any longer as they are per
fectly organized with commanders of
every rank at this time, and all their op
erations are being conducted as systemat
ically as those of the Spanish. Their one
appeal to the world ia not for sympathy,
but for ammunition."
YOUNG DYGART'S CASE.
Boyish Enthusiasm That Will Probably
. . He Excused. â  .'...'â 
. WASHINGTON, D. C, March 30.-Gen
eral Weyler cabled to the Spanish Minister
to-day that the case of young Walter
Dygart, who : was captured near Guines
February 22, is under investigation. When
Dygart was captured by Spanish â¢ officers
he was wandering'- helplessly ; about in the
interior, trying to find a band of insurgents
which -i he ; wanted to > join. The Spanish
think he was led by * boyish enthusiasm
and as he had not accomplished his pur
pose they are disposed to release him. ,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ATTACKED ON A
PHOENIX STREET.
Governor Hughes Struck
Down by a Newspaper
Correspondent.
HIS FACE BADLY CUT.
The Blow Breaks His Eyeglasses
and Causes a Serious
Wound.
ASSAILED WITHOUT WARNING.
No Opportunity Given Him to Defend
Himselfâ Result of a Political
Feud.
PHCENIX, Ariz., March 30.â Governor
Hughes was assaulted at noon to-day by a
newspaper correspondent named P. J.
Clark. He was walking up Washington
street with Price Behan and Colin Cam
eron, members of the Livestock Sanitary
Commission, and, when on the corner of
Center street, was accosted by a friend who
handed him a letter, which he paused to
read. While engaged in reading the let
ter, Clark approached, and, before his
presence was known to any one, dealt the
Governor a stunning blow in the face,
breaking his eyeglasses and sending him
stunned to the sidewalk.
The broken glasses cut Governor Hughes'
eyelid badly and the wound bled pro
fusely, and the bystanders feared that the
sight had been destroyed; but this proved
erroneous. His cheek was also cut.
Clark was seized by the Governor's com
panions before he could do any further
damage and placed under arrest. One
peculiar and yet unexplained feature of
the assault is that the blow tore a hoie
through the rim of the Governor's hat im
mediately over the eye, as though made
by some pointed instrument. Whether
Clark hpld a weapon in his hand or not is
not known. He is out on Bonds, furnished
by B. A. Fickas and Tom Smith, two.lead
ing anti-Hughes Democrats.
This assault is the denouement of a
long and bitter political fight made against
Governor Hughes by members of bis own
party. Clark has been a very pronouncod
enemy and has worked with those who
sought to secure his removal. This has
provoked the Tucson Star, the Governor's
paper, to speak of Clark in very uncom
plimentary terms on various occasions,
which served to intensify the hatred. It
is believed that this assault was pTecipi
tated by an article which appeared in ihe
Star a few days ago, which reflected upon
Clark.
HUGHES TO BE REMOVED.
President Cleveland yominates a Succes
nor to the Governor.
PHCENIX, Ariz., March 30.â A1l Phoenix
is alive With excitement to-night. Bands
are playing, and bonfires burning around
the executive chamber and on the princi
pal streets to celebrate the appointment
of Colonel J. B. Franklin as Governor of
Arizona.
At the Commercial Hotel hundreds
called to serenade the new Governor. He
made a brief address, simply expressing
the hope that his administration would
meet the approval of loyal Arizonian3 of
the better class.
This afternoon Secretary of the Territory
Bruce received this dispatch from Wash
ington :
Order for Governor Hughes' removal signed
by the President to-day. Reynolds,
Acting Secretary of Interior.
The news soon spread over the city, and
it was later learned that the President had
nominated Franklin for the place. Gov
ernor Hughes was seen by The Call cor
respondent to-night and said he had re
ceived no intimation of his removal except
the dispatch to Secretary Bruce. One
year ago charges were preferred against
htm by members of the Democratic party,
some of the charges dating back twenty
five years.
Special agents of the Interior Depart
ment were sent here to examine into
them and made a most thorough ana
rigid examination. The Governor appar
ently answered these accusations satisfac
torily, for nothing was done toward his
removal. He requested that the depart
ment inform him it he had failed to refute
the charges in a single instance, and in
formed Secretary Smith that his resigna
tion was ready at any time it might be
wanted.
Through a friend the Governor had reÂ«
ceived the most positive assurances during
the past three months that the President
and Secretary Smith were entirely satis
fied with him and that he need give him
self no uneasiness, and he had no intima
tion that other charges had been preferred
within twelve months.
The news was a surprise to him and he
was at a loss to conceive the cause. He
will insist on a thorough examination by
the Senate into the causes which prompted
the President to remove him and will meet
all charges that may be preferred.
Secretary Bruce gave out to-day that he
would assume the oflice of Governor at
once, but leading lawyers express the
opinion that while the Senate is in session
the President cannot remove the Governor
without its consent, and that be should
continue to discharge the duties of his
office until his successor is confirmed by
the. Senate. It is safe to say that a lively
fitiht will follow.
Colonel B. J. Franklin, who has been
nominated by the President for Governor,
is a lawyer of ability and stands well here.
He came here about three years ago from
Kansas City, Mo., and has established a
lucrative practice. Two years ago he was
the Democratic nominee for District At
torney of Maricopa County, but was de
feated by Hon. Jerry Millay. During
Cleveland's first administration he was
Minister to China and he has served two
terms in Congress from Missouri.

CONSOLIDATION
IS DEFEATED
Victory of a Stockholder in
the Great Northern
Company.
COMPETITION MUST LIVE
Justice .Brown Reads a Most
Important Decision by the
Supreme Court.
MONOPOLIES CANNOT RULE. â¢
An Opinion Also Rendered in a
Similar Case From the State
cf Kentucky.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 30.â The
effort of Thomas W. Pearsali, a stockholder
in the Great Northern Railroad Company,
to prevent a consolidation of that corpo
ration with the Northern Pacific had a
successful issue to-day when Justice Brown
announced the oDinion of the Supreme
Court of the United States.
The case came up from the Circuit Court
of the Eighth Circuit, which ruled against
Pearsall. He contended that the propo
sition to unite the two railroads was in
violation of the law.of Minnesota enacted
in 1874, which prohibited the consolidation
of competing lines of the road.
On the other hand it was the contention
of the managers that the law was a viola
lation of the provisions of thÂ«> charter of
Minneapolis and St. Cloud Kailroad, the
original link of the Great Northern line,
tuthorizing it to lease or purchase other
lines of the road. The question before the
Supreme Court of the United States, said
Justice Brown, was whether or not the law
of 1874 was an impairment of. the vested
rights. of the Great Northern Company.
Discussing the meaning of the term of
vested right the opinion stated that in
the view of the court it did not extend be
yond a right acquired by or under exe
cuted contracts.
It was within the power of the Legisla
ture under a general permission such as
is expressed in the Minneapolis and St.
Cloud charter to reqnire other roads to de
clare that it shall not be used to acquire
competing lines and thus construct a mo
nopoly, which for 300 years had oeen held
by the courts in England and this country
to be odious and against public policy.
The judgment of the Circuit Court was re
versed and the case remanded with in
structions to proceed in accordance with
the opinion.
Justice Field and Justice Brewer dis
sented from the judgment of the court.
Justice Brown also read the opinion of
the court in a similar case of the Louis
ville and Nashville Railroad Company vs.
the Commonwealth of Kentucky, appealed
from the Court of Appeals in that State.
The Louisville and Nashville had ar
ranged to purchase control of the Chesa
peake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad
Company, which would give it a practical
monopoly of the railroad business between
Louisville and Nashville, and the State
brought suit for an injunction to prevent
the carrying out of the contract on the
ground that it would be a violation of the
law of the State forbidding the consolida
tion, by lease or purchase, of competing
lines of roads within the State.
The injunction was issued by the inferior
court and sustained by the Court of Ap-'
peals. This judgment the Supreme Court
of the United States affirmed. The opin
ion declared it to be the opinion of the
court that not only was the Louisville and
Nashville Company forbidden to purchase,
bat by the constitution of Tennessee, of
which the Chesapeake. Ohio and South
western was a citizen, it was incompetent
tolsell. The conclusion of the court was
concurred in Justices Brewer and White.
TEXAS PACIFIC WINS.
The Supreme Court Oterrules the Inter
state Commission.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 30.â 1n
the case of the Texas Pacific Railroad
Company against the Interstate Com
merce Commission, involving the order of
the commission requiring the railroad
company to carry freight arriving at New
Orleans from a loreign country to
San Francisco at the same rate as
freight originating at New Orleans,
or at other points in the United States,
shipped via New Orleans, the Supreme
Court of the United States to-day over
ruled the commission. The court con
cluded that the commission wan bound to
consider all the conditions governing the
carrying of traffic and was not bound to
any hard and fast rule. The interests of
others besides shippers at Atlantic ports
are to be considered by the commission
and when thus considered the court is of
the opinion that the order of the commis
sion will be found to be unwarranted.
The judgment of the courts below, sus
taining the order of the commission, was
reversed, and the Circuit Court directed to
dismiss the bill against the railroad com
pany. From the judgment in the last case
Justice Harlan dissented. Chief Justice
Fuller and Justice Brown united with
Justice Harlan in dissenting from tne
judgment of the court.

APRIL 5TH IS THE DATE.
Easter Sunday Occurs on the Same Day A/I
Over the Wide, Wide
World.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 30.â
Easter Sunday occurs on the same day the
world over. A statement published that
Easter Sunday occurred this year a week
earlier in San Francisco than elsewhere in
the world is declared by scientists here to
be ridiculous, based, perhaps, upon the
erroneous supposition that the astrono
mical full moon had anything whatever to
do with fixing the great church festival.
If that assumption had been in any way
warranted it would be Easter throughout
the country west of Pittsburg. The date
of Easter depends on the calendar moon
And not on the true astronomical moon,
which generally occurs one or two days
earlier, and this fact has led to many mis
understandings in the past. According to
the regulations of the council of Nice,
Easter must fall on the 14th day of the
Paschal moon, being that of which the
14th day falls on. or next follows the day
of vernal equinox. Easter is fixed wholly
by the ecclesiastical calendar and neither
by the lunar nor the solar year as such.
In 189(5 it occurs April 5.

Representative McLachlan was asked by
The Call correspondent to-day wnat he
thought the Committee on Rivers and Har
bors would do in relation to the improve
ment of the harbor of San Pedro. He
said :
"I have strong personal assurances that
San Pedro will get all we have asked for,
namely, $390,000, and also that an addi
tional appropriation will be made for the
survey of the inner harbor to deepen the
same to twenty-five feet at low water
tide and extending it back to Smith
Island. This improvement of the harbor
will admit the largest vessel on the Pacific
Coast."
McLachlan was asked if Santa Monica
would receive any appropriation. He said
that all his efforts were centered on San
Pedro, and at present he had no other pro
ject in view and he could not see
how Santa Monica could receive any
appropriation as the engineers had
never reported favorably on this project.
McLachlan is highly elated over the pros
pects, and said : "Tliis improvement will
be made on a continuous plan. If tne
river and harbor bill becomes a law it
will be the largest appropriation ever
Given to Southern California. I hope the
overzealous friends of San Pedro will not
spoil tne pood work we have tried to ac
complish. 1 '

claims for the principal and interest due
on State bonds held by the United States
and for lands claimed by the State under

sitions that have been taken up within
the last few weeks."

Before Retiring He Buys Four Million
Bushels of Wheat in the Chicago
Pit.
CHICAGO, 111., March 30.â Ed Pard
ridge, the millionaire plunger in the
wheat pit of the Board of Trade, and the
most conspicuous figure in the speculative
line since the days of "Old Hutch,"
bought 4,000,000 bushels of wheat to-day
and says he will now retire from the
market, having no further interest in it.
He said he was a aick man physically and
would have to give up speculating. His
appearance bore out his statement as to
his ill health. His buying of such an im
mense line of wheat was merely to cover
his short sales so that he could quit the
market even. The market inconsequence
was very much agitated and the price rose
from 63% cto 61% c a bushel while the re
tiring plunger's brokers were clamoring
for his 4,000,000 of short wheat. "When
they had secured all they wanted k the price
dropped to 63^c
SAVED BY A LITTLE DAUGHTER.
Despondent Grove L. Sprague Made an
Ineffectual Attempt to Commit
Suicide.
HAZELTON, Pa., March 30.â Grove L.
Sprague was prevented from committing
suicide yesterday by his six-year-old
daughter Mabel. Sprague has been the
victim of a series of misfortunes. His
latest affliction, blindness, is responsible
for the attempt at self-destruction.
While his family was out he secured two
towels, of which he made a noose on one
end and tied the other to the bedpost. In
serting his head he threw his weight on
the loop and was strangling to death when
his little daughter Mabel came upstairs.
The child ran back to the street, scream
ing wildly for help, and several men ar
rived in time to save his life. He was
unconscious when cut down, but revived
later.
It was then learned that his wife was
also ill from overwork, trying to support
the family and attend the patient, and
they were in destitute circumstances.
Sprague stated that he realized he was but
a burden to himself and family and that
if he were out of the way his wife would
be better able to care for their children.

The report of a possible alliance between

READY FOR THE RALLY
Final Agreement Made With the
Business Men's League of
St. Louis.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE TICKETS
There Is Much Speculation as to How
Long the Great Gathering
Will Last.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 30.â The hall
sub-committee of the Republican National
Committee met here to-day to make final
the agreement entered into with the Busi
ness Men's League.
The committee is composed of Chairman
Thomas H. Carter of Montana (ex-officio),
Joseph H. Manley of Maine, William
Hahn of Ohio, Henry C. Payne of Wiscon
sin, General Powell Clayton of Arkansas,
ex-Governor Joseph Fifer of Illinois, Gene
ral J. S. Clarkson of lowa and Richard C.
Kerens of Missouri. Senator Payne of
Wisconsin is represented by Hon. John
M. Ewing of Milwaukee.
After an informal exchange of views on
the chances of the candidates the com
mittee went into executive session at 10:30
a. M. The printing and distribution of
tickets was the first matter considered.
This brought out wide variance of views
on the probable length of the convention.
Friends of one le.viing candidate seemed
to think only threo days would be con
sumed iv getting a nomination, while
those of the other extreme thought tickets
were necessary for six days, one member
from the far East hinting at a necessity for
ten days before the right mau could be
named.
It was finally decided that one ticket
should admit to all sessions. The distri
bution of press tickets is given to the local
press committee, but all applications for
press tickets and of tickets of courtesy to
distinguished men should be made to Ser
geant-at-Arms T. E. Byrnes of Minneapo
lis. All other applications for admission
must be made to the various State and
Territorial delegations. Tickets will aiso
be issued to the National Council of the G.
A. R. for distribution at their discretion.
Tickets will be issued on Monday, June 15,
at the convention auditorium by Sergeant

DEMOCRATS OF COLORADO.
At Their Convention They Will Declare
for Silver.
DENVER, Colo., March 30.â The Demo
cratic State Convention will be held in
Denver Aipril 15, on which date, also, Sen
ator Tillman of South Carolina will ap
pear to address the Democracy. In call
ing the State committee to order to-day
Frank Arbuckle, chairman, made a brief
address in which he denied the accuracy
of a recent press dispatch from New York
which quoted him as favoring the financial
poJicy of President Cleveland. He read
his letter to the members of the commit
tee in which he declared himself a silver
man regardless of the action of the Na
tional Democratic Convention. In this
connection he continued to say:
"I now reiterate the sentiment contained
in my letter to you and hope that our con
vention will elect men to represent us at
the National convention who are as good
Democrats and as good silver men as the
delegates will be from Virginia, Missis
sippi, Texas, Missouri and the other South
ern States, all of which are Democratic.
I venture to repeat what I have said be
fore that the Democratic party contains
80 per cent of the silver forces of the
country, and our party gives five times
more strength to silver than the Repub
lican and Populist parties combined."
A resolution recommending the appoint
ment of Chairman Arbuckle as State mem
ber of the National committee was de
feated.
PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCES.
Uncertainty Regarding the Choice of the
Republicans.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 30.-The
Herald this morning says: A careful can
vass made by correspondents of the Her
ald in every State and Territory in the
Union to determine the Presidential pref
erences of the delegates to the Republican
National Convention, which will be held
in St. Louia on June 16, shows that on the
first ballot McKinley will poll more than
double the vote of any other candidate,
and that he will fall only sixty-t"vo votes
short of the nomination.
As nearly as it is now possible to make
a forecast of the situation, the outcome of
the convention is still uncertain, and it is
possible that after all a struggle will be
precipitated that will result- in the selec
tion of some candidate whose name does
not now appear on the list. The total
number of delegates will be 909. and 465
will be required to nominate. McKinley
will probably go into the convention with
393 votes on the first ballot. Reed will be
second in point of strength with 152 votes,
including solid New England. Morton
will stand third with 69, and Allison will
have only 38.
CYRUS LELAND JR. LEADER.
Anxious to Manage the Republican Cam
paign in. Kansas.
TOPEKA, Kans., March 30.â Cyrus
Leland Jr. will be candidate for chairman
of the Republican National Committee,
and it is claimed by his friends in Kansas
that, he has consented to stand for the
position at tne request of William Mc-
Kinley, who wishes him to manage the
campaign in case of his nomination for the
Presidency. Leland has been a member of
the National Committee from Kansas for
twelve years and the State Convention in
structed the delegation to the St. Louis
Convention to elect him for another term.
He was chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee and redeemed the State
two years ago from Popnlist rule.
DEMOCRATS NOT IN IT.
But Mr. Campbell Would Like the Com
plimentary Tote.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 20.âEx-Goy
ernor Campbell would like the comoliment j
of the solid vote of Ohio's delegation in |
the National Democratic Convention for i
President. Yesterday he said* "I am not i
a candidate for President this year, for I i
do not believe that any Democrat can be |
elected in November. It is unjust, but j
nevertheless true, that the people blame
the Democratic party for the hard times, i
and that will beat us. However, it would j
be pleasant, and a great honor besides, to j
receive the complimentary vote of the
Ohio delegation, and if the 'boys' want to
give it to me I shall not object."
BUNKOED BY AN PLD TRICK.
Greengood* Men JFind a , Victim in a
c yew Jersey Fanner*
BOUND BROOK N.J.; March 30.â 8.
D. Y. Andrews, a farmer, who claims to
live near Milwaukee, Wis., was bunkoed
out of $1000 Friday by New York green
goods men. About a month ago Andrews
received the usual circulars from New
York. He went through all the formali
ties of writing and telegraphing and
finally started. He was instructed to stop
at Phillipsburg, N. J. There he was met"
by the steerer and taken to Easton, Pa.,
j and the steerer said he would show him
how easy it was to pass the greengoods.
When Andrews was â  worked up to the
proper pitch the steerer brought him to
this place. They reached here at 12:04
yesterday.
A carnage was waiting. In it was the
second swindler. Andrews was taken for
a drive in the country. The drive was ex
tended so that the' carriage reached the
station just as the train was about to pull
out. The box exchange was worked on
Andrews in the flurry of catching the
train. Andrews, with the box of cut pa
per, had to jump to get on the train. He
discovered the swindle when a few miles
out and alighted at Flemington Junction
and came back, but the men and the car
raige had disappeared. Andrews would
not make a complaint to the police, as he
was afraid he might be arrested.

for the Colonies, stated, in reply to a
question upon the subject by John Red
mond, that there was not an atom of truth

Transvaal republic to the invitation ex
tended to him to visit Great Britain and
discuss the situation in the South African
Republic, and also to state the position of
the Government in regard thereto.
Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, declined to give any informa
tion concerning the matter.
Mr. George X. Curzon, Under Secretary
for the Foreign Office, stated that the
Sultan of Turkey had requested the
Khedive of Egypt to explain the advance
of troops up the valley of the Nile and
that the Khedive had replied that the
Bri ish and Egyptian Governments had
agreed that the moment was opportune
fer the recovery of the province of Don
gola.
Mr. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury,
announced that the House would adjourn
for the Easter recess for ten days.
Mr. Labonchere moved a resolution
against adjournment for so long a time
unless the House had .more information in
regard to the Egyptian situation than had
yet been given.
-Mr. Labouchere's motion was rejected
by a vote of 233 to 67.

blows wore weakening in their force. Horace
kept rushing his man and as they came
together Everhardt landed a left-hand hook on
the point of the chin and Leeds went to the
floor. To the spectators it looked as if Leeds
fell more from sheer exhaustion than from
the force of the blow. He was unable to get up
and was counted out.
It was a long time before Leeds recov
ered consciousness. He lay prone in the
corner of the ring with his seconds work
ing over him trying to bring him back.
He was breathing hard, but was uncon
scious. He had to be carried from
the ring and regained consciousness in
tbe dressing-room. The knock-out came
unexpectedly. Leeds did all the leading
in the first ten rounds and was completely
exhausted when he was put to sleep. The
blow was a mild one and Leeds went out
from sheer exhaustion. The utmost
secrecy was observed while Leeds lay in
the dressing-room. The newspaper re
porters were denied admission and the
police were called in to help keep the re
porters out. It was learned that when the
ammonia bottle was placed to Leeds' nose
after he was brought to the dre3sing-room
he became conscious for a moment. It
was only momentarily, however, for he
relapsed into unconsciousness again soon
after.
Physicians worked over him from 11:10
until 11:40 o'clock before signs of return
ing life became manifest. At just 11:40
o'clock Leeds opened his eyes and moved
his head. Consciousness returned slowly
but surely, and a few minutes before 12
o'clock LÂ»eds was assisted from the club
house and taken to New York.

first ga^me in the series of international
billiard tournaments fora purse of $2000
was played to-night in the concert hall at
Madison-square Garden â  between Albert
Gamier, the champion ot Belgium, and
Jacob Schaefer of Chicago.
When the tournament was arranged it
was expected that there would be at least
six entries, but for some unexpected rea
â  son only Gamier. Schaefer and Ives were
j willing to accept the conditions and put
i up $7f>o each as a sweepstake in addition
! to the added money.
Three tournaments are to be held, the
j one now in progress being the first. Ti.e
: other two w:il be played in Boston and
| Chicago, tne same conditions to rule upon
all three occasions.
The conditions are: Six hundred points
to constitute a game, the balk-line to be
eighteen inches from the cushion and each
player to contest twice against each other
in each city, 50 per cent going toth 1
winner, 30 per cent to the second and 'JO
percent to the third. The tournament
: will last six nights, concluding next Sat
urday.
One of the condition of the game is the
! barring of the anchor shot, only shots be
â  ing allowed within the anchor lines, seven j
! inches in length and three and a half |
inches aeep.
Colonel W. H. Foster, who has been
chosen referee, introduced the players. In j
the eichth inning Gamier followed up
three by Schaefer.with a twice-around-the
lable hazard and made it. It was a star
| shot and drew forth a round of applause.
In the twelfth Schaefer landed the object
I balls in the anchor space and played the
; old anchor game, fully demonstrating that
jhe is still the "wizard" of old. Before he
tripped on an up and down the table shot
he had gathered up seventy-six buttons.
In the thirteenth inning Schaefer scored
before he lost his shot. Gamier seemed to
pick up his stroke and made a combina
tion of very pretty shots of all kinds, from
the ordinary masse to the difficult twist,
when all three bails were lined up along
the rail. He tripped at 35.
The finai score: Schaefer 600, Gamier
197. The nighest runs were: Schaefer !ti,
Gamier 35. The average was: Schaefer
20, Gamier 6 23-29. _

round ended with honors even.
In the second round landed sev
eral heavy blows on Husbana's ribs.
Neither man had any advantage in the
third round.
In the fourth round Smith got in a
heavy blow on Husband's head that

dates who are willing to be Queen of
Healdsburg's Floral Festival, and when
the votes were counted to-night a large
crowd gathered around the polling-booth
to learn tbe result.
There are many in this city who believe
Mrs. C. Thilo of Cloverdale is to be the
Queen, and these are going around to
night saving: "I told you so," for the can
didate from the Orange City now leads,
with Miss Edna Bidale second, Alice

SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 30.â 1n the
contest for queen to-day Miss Sara Hall
once more assumed the lead by about
fifty votes. Mrs. L. W. Bnrris, who has
been leading for several days, gained some
during the day, but not enough to retain \
supremacy.
The contest now seems to have narrowed j
down from forty candidates to four, with I
the lead alternating between Mrs. Burris
and Miss Hall. Important changes are j
looked for, however, on Wednesday, as ;
that day has been selected as a general !
voting day. Each resident of this city- is ,
asked to deposit one vote, and it is be- !
lieved that several thousand ballots will j
be cast.
Wednesday is also election day for city \
officers, and more than fifty candidates
will be callc*d upon to drop votes into the :
carnival boxes. These, of which there j
will be three, are to be located on the prin- ;
cipal streets of the city and a guardian j
placed over each.
The accommodation committee reports '.
ample provisions tor visiting guests. All J
tbe available rooms in town have beon
listed with the committee, and reasonable

SAN MATEO BELLES.
Miss Hoggin Leads in the Race With a
Handsome Majority.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., March 30.â
contest for Queen of the Rose Carnival
promises to be quite spirited for the next
three weeks. J Many fair maidens are now
taking an interest in the result. At South
San Francisco Miss Goegin, a very popular
young lady, leads the county vote by. a
nice majority and is booked for a winner,
but there are other favorites who are re
ceiving strong support. At Menlo Park
Miss Law lor has received a most com
mentary vote. . At Redwood City Miss
Ollie Christ leads, with Miss Lizzie- Hall
second, and Miss Nellie Hammerson of
Menlo Park a close third. Miss Hammer*
son is a new candidate for honors, but has"
many friends both ;in Redwood and at
Menlo Park to be heard from. Miss Ham
merson is a graduate of the Golden Gate
Kindergarten Association of San Fran
cisco, and is the bright young instructor
retained by the San Mateo County Free
Kindergarten Association, under whose j
auspices the Rose Carnival is* to be given.
The people of the town of San Mateo ! are
said to have a young lady whom they will
elect for Queen of the Carnival at the last
moment, and rumor has it that Miss
Gracie Lawrence is the one, as she is very
popular. "; / '-â ...â¢â â â  ."â¢â¢ .' â¢ â 
BRANDY SEIZED AT MODESTO.
Revenue Officials Take Possession of the
Lagomarsitio Gardens.
MODESTO, Cal., a â¢h 30.â The gar
dens of S. Lagomarsino on Dry Creek, a
mile from Modesto, are now m the hands
of internal revenue officers. They were
seized by W. Craven, a revenue collector,
because Lagomarsino had unstamped ,
brandy in his possession. A week ago
revenue officers found three bariels of
brandy which had been sent to Newman,
and seized it, then came to the gardens of
the owner and took possession of all his
property. On Saturday a man from the
gaugers' department of the revenue service
arrived and measured tie wine on hand,
and tookan inventory of the stock.
FRESNOITES TO BE SUED.
Evangelist Johnson Will Seek Balm for
His Wounded Feelings in the
Courts.
FRESNO, Cal., March 30.â Evangelist
Johnson has not been in evidence to-day
on the streets of Fresno, owing, perhaps,
to the prevalence of a severe sandstorm.
He is in the city, however, and has, so
It is said, been in a secret conference with
his lawyers and financial backer, Rev.
George Morse of Pasadena. It is under
stood that papers in several libel suits
were completed to-day and signed by
Johnson, but they had not been filed at
the close of business hours this afternoon.
The suits will be for laige amounts, the
heaviest being against the Morning Re
publican for $;')0.000: the Evening Exposi
tor for $'Jb.ooo and the Examiner and
Chronicle of San Francisco for large sums
in each case.
Papers in behalf of Johnson, charging
about a dozen members of the citizens'
committee which waited upon him in the
First National Bank with unlawful deten
tion, are also, it is alleged, in preparation.
FRESNOITES DECEIVED.
How the Southern Pacific Secured a
Jiitjht of Way.
FRESNO, Cal., March 30.â 1t is prob
able that suits will be brought here against
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
for obtaining rights o: way under false
pretenses.
In 1891 Marcus Pollasky came to Fresno
and represented that he proposed build
ing a railroad from this city about seventy
live miles into the mountains northeast.
He assured the people that the Southern
Pacific had nothing to do with the scheme.
and on this pretense obtained rights of
way worth $40,000.
In Pollasky's suit against C. P. Hunt
ington in New York, filed a few days ago,
he alleees that he built this road for the
Soutiiern Pacific. Many people here sus
pected this at the time tbe road was
planned, but Pollasky stoutly denied it.
HUNTINGTON'S
SCHEME GOES.
Continued from First Page
Pacific Railway Company are held and
shall elect officers of said new company
under the same conditions and require
ments as to the official organization as
represented by the by-laws of the Union
Pacific Railway Company.
This corporation may acquire all or part
of ihe railways and properties of the
Union Pacific Railway Company and may
provide for the indebtedness of the last
named company to ttie United States by
the issue to the Secretary of the Treasury
of bonds of the same character and amount
as those herein authorized to be made by
the Union Pacific Railway, secured by
mortgages of the same nature, extent and
relative lien as that authorized to be
made by it in section 2 hereof, they to
enjoy and exercise all rights, powers, priv
ileges, franchises and immunities equal in
character, extent and duration to those
which the Union Pacific would have had
and enjoyed had i. accepted and carried
out the provisions of this act, and may
make, issue, negotiate and deliver its
bond?, mortgages and stock corresponding
in character and extent to like securities,
which in such event ihe Union Pacific
Railway would have been entitled to retain
in existence and to make and issue, and in
all its relations and duties to file Govern
ment and to the public, and in regulation
and management of its corporate affairs it
shall be substituted to and governed by
the provisions of law which would hi such
event have been applicable to the Union
Pacific Company.
It is said tbat the only change which
will be suggested in the full committee of
the House will be one affecting the amount
of installments to be paid on the principal
by the Union Pacific Company.
One member of Congress thinks that
$385,000 should be paid annually for the
first period and fOOO.OOO for the second pe
riodâan increase of $65,000 and $100,000 re
spectively. But this proposition will prob
ably be overruled. It is probable that the
end of this week will see the bill reported
to both houses.
It is said to have been prepared by Hun
tlhgton, after consultation with the Union
Pacific people and leading members of the
committee, and to have been swallowed
with alacrity by the joint sub-committee.
The full committees -are practically coru
niitteii to anything prepared by their sub
committee.

SEQUEL OF THE
CARSON SCANDAL
Trenmor Coffin Indicted
for Bribing William
Langevin.
PLACED UNDER ARREST.
Bondsmen Come Forward and
He Is Immediately Given
His Liberty.
FINDINGS OF A GRAND JURY.
Go-Betweens Refuse to Testify, but
Are Balked by the Circe
Affidavit.
CARSON", Nev., March 30.â Trenmor
Coiiin was indicted by the Grand Jury
to-day. The indictment alleges that on or
about November 25, 1895, while the trial of
James Henev, the mint bullion thief, was
pending, Trenmor Coffin "corruptly and
feloniously obstructed and impeded the
due administration of justice by paying
$100 lor the purpose of influencing Joseph
Langevin to not appear in the United
States District Court to testify; also to
avoid the service of a subpena."
| iThis is a very busy day around the Gov
ernment building. It was definitely set
tled in the public mind thai the United
States Grand Jury had tne Coffin contempt
i:ase under consideration. When the jury
went into the building, in the morning D.
Circe was along, and it was known that he
would be required to tell further of his
dealings with Coffin, when he, as alleged,
took money for tiie attorney to the Lange
vin house.
It was also rumored that ma memory
regarding the identity of the person who
gave him the money and the general de
tails of the affair had tiecome somewhat
impaired. The grand jurors, however,
had Circe's original affidavit to refresh his
memory, and they made a very searching
examination.
Joseph Langevin was also before the
jury, with William Langevin, his son. At
about 3 o'clock tne jury came down, and
the news spread rapidly about the town
that it had tiled an indictment with the
clerk.
Coffin was expecting the indictment and
his bond, fixed at $300, was at once pro
duced, with Jacob Klein and Dr. Lee as
sureties.
Judge Hawley was asked to consider the
case of Langevin, who refused to testify,
but he said that, as the j'iry had found on
indictment without his testimony and ad
journed, he would not act in the matter.
Both Langevin and Brule, another go
between, will have to face contempt pro
ceedings later on if they refuse to testify.
TWICE STUCK IN MUD.
But the Paris Was \ot Injured by the
Mishaps.
SANDY HOOK, N..1., March 30.â The
American line steamship Paris, which ar
rived to-day from Newport News, Va.,
where she has been undergoing repairs,
stuck her nose in a mud bank while going
up the ship channel during a dense fog.
She backed off very soon as the tide was
rising.
QUARANTINE, L. 1., March MiâThe
Pari* again went aground southwest of
Quickstep buoy.
The Paris lifted her anchors and left
quarantine for her dock in New York at
1:90 this morning.
The exac: location of the groundine of
the Paris, according to a report made at
the office of the American line by the
officers on the vessel, was 900 feet north
east of east, off tiie Quickstep buoy. At 3
o'clock in the afternoon the water on the
draught marks showed that she drew
twenty-two feet and two inches of water
on both sides, beine; on an even keel.
At that time all the water except sixty
tons id the port fresh water tank 7 had
been removed and later that was taken
out.
During the afternoon five coal barges
were alongside receiving the 2(XX) tons of
coal from the bunkers of the Paris, a
greater part of which was removed before
she got off. She used 150 tons on her trip
from Newport News. It was said by the
American line officials that tlve Paris
would sail as scheduled (Wednesday), her
experience in the mud not injuring n^r in
the least. She got off easily with the
rising tide and the help of the tugs.
COMBINING THE STEEL TRADE.
Preliminary Steps to Fix the Price and
Control, the Output.
PITTSBUKG, Pa., March 30.â A gigan
tic industrial combination went through
the preliminary stage of ; formation and
was practically effected at -a. 'meeting of
steel-producers held in New York last
week. Another meeting will be held in
Pittsburg soon for the arrangement of de
tails. It is proposed to regulate the pro
duction of steel to actual requirements by
methods similar to those used by the rail
pool. â¢
At the start the price -will be fixed at $20
a ton, and will be changed according to
! price changes of raw materials. Pending
' completion of the combination: steel-pro
| ducers have withdrawn from 1 the market,
and will make no new contracts. Nearly
the entire production of the United States
was represented at the New York meeting,
embracing capital of several hundred mil
lions of dollars. . ,

ley road has beeu making purchases of
real estate here within the past week. A
deal was concluded on Saturday by which
a full block was turned over to the railroad

SAN BERNARDINO BUNKOED.
Relief for a Snotcb&untl Settler Fails to
Jieorh Him.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 30.â
The county of San Bernardino has been
bunkoed out of $40 and someone will have
to pay the penalty.
Three weeks ago one S. S. Guffy came
before the Board of Supervisors and told
of the predicament of his snowbound
neighbor, Edward Lawrence, who wouid
perish if relief was not given. The board
authorized Guffy to take provisions and
hurry to Lawrence's relief.
Guffy, on Saturday, hlei a bill for $40
with tlie Supervisors, together with a let
ter of thnnks from Lawrence. The bill
was approved and paid tnat day, but now
comes Lawrence in a letter declaring that
he got no provisions or aid from Guffy.,
nor did he write a letter of thanks to the
Board of Supervisors.
The letter written by Lawrence bears no
resemblance to the handwriting in the
letter given the board by Guffy, while the
writing of the name Guffy in the letter
purporting to have Deen written by
Lawrence is identical with the writing of
the name Guffy signed to the warrant.
Lawrence says in his letter that he did
not need relief. The Supervisors will ask
Guffy to explain the mystery surrounding
the transaction.
LOS ANGELES CONTEST.
Judge Clark Holds That the
State Can Contest a
win.
Granted the Same Privileges Under
the Statutes as Individuals
Enjoy.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 30.âSupe
rior Judge Clark handed down an opinion
to-day on a demurrer to a contest to a peti
tion to probate an instrument purporting
to be the last will of C. de Reynolds, de
ceased. The demurrer is sustained and
ten days are granted to amend.
The contest is by the Attorney-
General, and the court says that, al
though the demurrer must be sustained,
the question is whether, if a person dies
leaving an estate which, had he died in
testate, would under the statute have
passed to the State., the State is entitled to
be heard in opposition to the probate of
an instrument propounded as the will of
such deceased person.
On principle the court is of the opinion
that this question should receive an affirm
ative answer. The Code of Civil Pro
cedure (sec. 1307) provided that any per
son interested may appear and contest the
will.
That the State is an artificial person â
a public corporation embodying the
sovereign power â will of course be con
ceded, and no reason is given or authority
citea why the word "person" in that sec
tion should be confined to natural persons
or should not embrace artificial persons as
well.
The court holds, in short, that the State
is entitled to contest the probate of a will
as much as any person under the law.
MEDILL PROPERTY SOLD.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 30.â An

THE GREAT MAIL ORDER lIOVSK.
county seat and ordered primaries to be
held throughout the county for the elec
tion of delegates to the coming Republican
State Convention, with the exception of
two delegates "at large, which were ap
pointed by the committee, to wit: W. B.
Parker of Yataville and W. IX Pennvcook,
editor of the Yailejo Chronicle. This aft
ernoon the chairman of the committee
made the following public announcement
for the government of delegates:
To the Editor of the Vallejo Chronicle: There
was one important fact which was omitted in
your report of the proceedings of the Republi
can County Committee, and that was that the
delegates elected and appointed use their
every endeavor to prevent* the nomination of
Congressmen at the coining state convention,
as it is the sense of the committee that the call
was for tiie selection of delegates to the Na
tional Convention at St. Louis, and only that.
It hardly seems probable that such a step will
be taken, but as the State Central Committee
or, rather, several oi the Congressional dis
tricts have taken powers to themselves which
are unprecedented, there Is no knowing what
is possible and how far they may go to gain,
their object. The people comprising the party,
wherever you meet them, are suspicious, and
it will oe a fatal step if anything is done in an
underhand manner at the'beginnine of a cam*
paign which has every indication of success.

the cheerful, healthful face of William

he thought of the great Californian herb

suffering from liver trouble, then pains in
his back, how he kept awake at night,
scratching, scratching â always scratching;
how he took a medicine with iodide of pot-

then he used the Californian herb remedy,

He mended from the first week. He got
better and better; was now well. He said:
"I am glad 1 insisted on getting JOY'S

THE BAR AGAINST
COAST CATTLE
Lassen and PJumas Grow
ers Seeking to Raise
the Quarantine.
DECLARED AN OUTRAGE.
Northern California Entirely
Free From the Dreaded
Texas Fever.
ALL WILL APPEAL TO BUDD.
Appointment of a Stock Inspector
By the Governor to Be
Urged.
CHICO, Cal., March 30.â The stockmen
of Lassen and Plumas counties are up in
arms against the quarantine against Cali
fornia cattle, imposed by the Agricultural
Department, beause Texas fever is preva
lent somewhere west of the Rockies. They
declare that this quarantine has been es
tablished because Eastern stockmen de
sired it in order to shut out Pacific Coast
growers. W. T. CressUr, who is now at
Amadee with a band of cattle, which he
can neither ship nor dispose of because cf
Secretary Morton's order, is endeavoring
to arouse the cattlemen to take instant ac
tion for the removal of the bar against
their herds. Afl Cressler remarks, "Sple
netic or Texas fever is as scarce in this
section as ice in hades." Not a single case
in either of the counties of Plumas, Mo
doc, Sierra or Lassen has ever been heard
of.
It seems the lines were drawn with a pe
culiar regard to the exclusion of any Cali
fornia cattle from the Eastern market.
Considering this condition of affairs it
would appear that other motives than sim
ply to subserve the public interests have
been the animus for including the- entire
State of California and omitting all of Ne
vada, lying a3 that State does directly to
the east and extending no further north
than the prescribed territory. Whatever I
the motive the effect is plainly to be seen.
The cattle men interested intend to
make the proper showing at once to have
the discriminating lines redrawn. If they
are not it is probable that the 4000 or more
cattle remaining in this section and which
would seek a market this spring will have
to be sold at a loss or driven back to the
ranges.
The hay men ol Honey Lake also have
an interest in seeing this quarantine
removed from cattle. If it is to continue
in force it will interfere materially with
this valley as a feedinc-groumi.
The most direct and quickest plan to
have the ban removed from our cattle is
found in Cressl p rs suggestion that a
petition be sent to Governor Budd from
this valley as soon as possible askine the
appointment of a cattle inspector, in order
to satisfy Secretary Morten that there is
no Texas fever in this part of the State,
even while there may be some in sections
a thousand miles from here. This was the
plan pursued in Texas, and tne districts
found free from disease are allowed to ship
their cattle north at any time.

cisco Via Jieno.
Sr>ANVILLE, Cu.., March 30.â The
quarantine law recently imposed against
the cattle of northwestern California is
destinea to work great hardship to all that
portion of the State lying east of the
Sierra.
To all intents and purposes it is an em
bargo that affects not only the cattle
dealer but the farmer who sells hay.
Practically it prevents the shipment of
any cattle from this section to the East,
and it is a matter of fact that beef destined
for San Francisco and billed through from
Amedee, in Lassen County, is hable to be
quarantined as soon as it crosses the State
line to reach the Central Pacific at Reno.
There are 2503 cattle feeding in Honey
Lake Valley at this time that are thus de
nied a market, while it is a fact that no
reason exists or has ever existed for a
quarantine so far as this section is con
cerned. John Sparks' cattle, quarantined
at Omaha and ordered killed, came from
thi< valley and were in ' perfect health.
Why the Jaw should have been invoked
against them is a question which may be
best answered by those whose interests are
subserved.
The peneral opinion of the cattlemen
and farmers of this valley, who are affect
ed by this unjust application of the law,
which is of too extended scope, is that the
recent activity in the matter is due to the
coast purchasers, who desire the reserves
of this part of tne State for their own use.
No conjoint action has yet been taken
here, the outcome of Governor Budd's let
ter to the Department of Agriculture
being awaited with the greatest anxiety.
RESTS WITH THE GOVERNOR.
Can Draw the Discriminating Line Be
tween Any I'oiutn limired.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 30.âRep
resentative Johnson of California, has been
asked t>y Governor Budd and Dr. Lane,
. the latter the Secretary of the State Board
of Health of California, to protest to the
Secretary of. Agriculture against the quar
antining of California cattle, which are
â¢ alleged to be affected with Texas fever.
Johnson saw Secretary Morton this
mom ing and informed him that Dr. Lane
insisted that the cattle were healthy. Dr.
Salmon, the chief of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, presented reports, however,
from the agents of the department of the
Pacific Coast showing that the disease exr
isted, but that it was confined to cattle
coming from the southern part of the
State.
Secretary Morton explained to Johnson
that before issuing his circular quaran
tining California cattle he had notified
Governor Bndd of his intention, and that
he set forth the legal difficulties which
would prevent him from drawing a divis
ional line between the two sections. To
this letter he received no response. The
remedy, he added, was in the Governor's
hands, inasmuch as be might draw this
line between any points desired, in order
that the quarantine remain in force only
against the affected section without having
any influence upon the remainder of the
State.

FUROR AT THE CAPITOL
Bureau of Highway Members
Resent J. W. McDonald's
Charges.
Deny That They Gave Inside Infor
mation to Contractor Touhey
at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 30.â The
statement of J. W. McDonald in The Call
to-day, wherein he declares that Contrac- j
tor Touhey was given inside information
enabling him to put in a lower bid than j
other contractors who were after the con- i
tract for bituminizing the streets surround- '
ing the Capitol has raised a storm of in
dignation from the members of the Bureau i
of Highways. Mr. Irwin, when inter
viewed this evening, said:
"The statement that we gave Mr.
Tuohey inside facts as to the price of '
rock furnished from Folsora is an abs >â¢
Inte falsehood. It would have been im
possible for us to give exact figures, as
Warden Aull did not inform us as to the
exact cost of crushing until the evening j
tnat the bids were opened, and I was then
enabled to give the exact figures in my
public address to the Capitol City Wheel- i
men. Every one ol the San Francisco I
competitors called at the office of the â 
bureau before formulating his bid, and re- ,
ceived t;;e same information given to Mr.
Touhey â that is, that we thought the rock '
could oe furnished at 50> cents per square |
yard.
"The idea that any one could get inside
points is simply absurd, as the press of the i
State for months past has published the
tact that ttie establishment of the rock- ;
crushing plant depended on the previous '
contracting for at least 50,000 square yards !
of road material with satisfactory trans-
Donation rates. The fact that such had i
been procured was published in The Call I
of June 22, 1895, and the Record-Union of 1
August 6 published the message of the
Mayor of Sacramento, guaranteeing rock
at 70 cents.
'"It is impossible that contractors who j
keep up with the times would figure on
procuring rocs from private ind ; viduals at
$1 50, when the press of the State gave
publicity to the low rates at which State
rock could be procured, and also stated
that the contract for bituminizing the ,
streets surrounding the Capitol was being !
withheld for the purpose of including the |
16,000 square yards necessary for that work |
within the 50,000 square yard contract neÂ«
essary to the establishment of the rock- :
crushing plant.
"None of us have been approached as â 
was Mr. Kent, and the only interest we ;
have in the contracts is to see just as
many miles of good road laid throughout
the State as possible."
Mr. Touhey emphatically states that he
personally told Mr. McDonald on the 22d I
of the month that rock could be procured
from Folsom at 50 cents a square yard,
landed on the cars in Sacramento." He :
toid McDonald this on an estimate, as he :
never obtained positive figures from the
Bureau of Highways. He claims that ;
every one of the contractors bidding knew j
this rate and used it as a basis in their |
bids."
Mr. Touhey also denies that he ever
bought any cobbles from Trustee Kent or
the city, and retaliates by stating that
McDonald took cobbles that he never paid
for, and claims he has proof to that ef
fect.
SLA IN IN SELF-DEFENSE.
Officials Investigate the Killing of a Jap- \
anese at hair Oahs.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 30.â Cor- |
oner Clark, in company with Lakanye, '
the Japanese, who confessed to having
killed and hurried a companion Japanese 5
last Tuesday, went to Fair Oaks this
morning to exhume the body. On arriv
ing there, Lakayne pointed out the grave I
which is in a circle of dense underbrush. '
The assistance of a number of Japanese \
was procured, and in a few minutes the
body was exposed. From the waist up- i
ward, the corpse was wrapped in a blanket,
and it was lyini: face downward in a hole
from which an immense stump had been
grubbed.
There were two ax wounds, one three
inches long through the center of the head, i
penetrating the skull, and the other across I
the forehead, over the right eye.
J3y inquiry it was found that the dead i
man was a vicious, quarrelsome fellow, al- '
ways seeking trouble with his compatriots, i
The previous evening he had thrice at- j
tempted to pick a quarrel with his slayer, j
Lakanye's story is to the effect that 'the j
other Japanese rushed at him and struck |
at him with the ax, cutting him in the lei;. !
Lakanye then disarmed him and struck
him on the head, but did not intend to i
kill him. When he found th.it the man
was dead he wrapped him in a blanket and I
buried him.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1896.
SUFFERING IN
ALASKAN WILDS
Hundreds of Men Unable
to Purchase or Beg
Food.
SUBSISTING ON CLAMS.
The Beach at Juneau Covered
With the Rude Huts of the
Unfortunates.
NO LET-UP TO THE RUSH.
Penniless Men Pouring Into ttie
Country and Without Means
to Return.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 30.â "Tell the
people who have no money to stay away
from Alaska. The newspapers must stop
this ruinous stampede," said T. C. Ashby,
a pioneer Alaskan packer, who passed
through Portland to-day en route to the
northern El Dorado.
"The giving of wide publicity to the
certain hardship, suffering â yes, even star
vation â that surely* confronts the money
less Alaskan adventurer is all that can
turn back the present rush to that
country," he continued. ."The people of
San Francisco, Portland. Seattle, Tacoma,
Victoria, B. C, and other points from
which the raake-np of ihis stampede is
coming, have no idea of its tremendous
proportions, but we of Alaska, who every
few days have seen land on our beaches |
150 to 200 men, three-fourths of whom are
penniless and have to be fed, are the ones
who are cognizant of the situation in all
its desperation.
"Hire you see a party of twenty or
thirty men leave on the steamer or train
bound for Alaska. Of the number pos
sibly five are supplied with funds sufficient
to take them to the Yukon with a proper
outfit. The balance are trusting to luck
and the chance of obtaining work. This
party makes no impression on leaving
here, nor are its members missed, but at
every other city on the route north, up to
the very last point where the steamer
makes a stoppage before steaming off into
the great inland passage, these twenty or
thirty men are joined by twenty or thirty
more, until at last a steamer overloaded
with lively humanity, willing to eat and
sleep anywhere or everywhere aboard the
craft so long as they are permitted to jour
ney toward the Mecca of their deluded
hopes on a cut-rate fare, leaves Nanaimo.
There is no stopping now except at a few
isolated canneries and semi-abandoned
camps, where, even were one of the pas
sengers offered a job at fair wages, he
would refuse, so intent are they all to get
north, until Juneau is reached, and there
the whole crowd pours from the steamer
and spreads out onto the little semi-circu
lar beach of the bay on which Juneau lies.
"Inside of two hours after the passen
gers land the wheat has separated itself
from the chaff. Those who have money
have engaged rooms and board for the few
days they expect to stay and are busying
themselves about the stores, either getting
together an en'ire outfit for the Yukon or
making purchases of articles that have
been overlooked. On- the other hand, the
'broken' men have divided themselves
into squads of ten or twelve, and each squad
. has a committee out, searching for a cabin
or some kind of shelter under which they
may spread their blankets and cook the
sack of flour, piece of bacon and few
pounds of beans the funds of the entire
party will afford to buy. There are no
cabins, even far back up the canyon, to
rent, and when I left Juneau there was
not a bit of cloth for tent-making to be
bought until the arrival of the next
steamer.
"The result is, the men without money
are forced to take to the beach. They are
strong and wiiling to work, and by bor
rowing an ax soon succeed in throwing up
a brush house, which, with the constant
rains of the country, is almost worse than
nothing. In front of this hut, as best they
can, the men cook the little food they
have been able to buy. This lasts possibly
a week, during which time each of the
party has done his best to rind work.
There is none. For a few days longer
they 'live on the beach,' as it is termed in
the north when a man looks for food to
the clams, mussels and fish, with which
the country abounds. Without Hour,
grease of some kind and the condiments
of civilization, this beach grub is hard
going, and in four days, we'll say, the men
are desperate in their hunger. Their
pride gives away and they try to beg a
meal from the hotels or restaurants, but
there have been a hundred ahead of them,
no matter how early in the morning -they
may make their plea for food, and they
are refused.
"If a man has theÂ«money to come to the
country, and after purchasing an outfit,
spend a season in the interior and have
sufficient funds left, providing he is un
successful, to pay his way back to civiliza
tion, I say let him come. There is virgin
country, miles upon miles, never trod by
the foot of a prospector; but for the man
thinking to take advantage of the cheap
steamer fare to reach Juneau and then by
some hook or crooK make his way into the
interior or find work on the coast, I say,
in the name of humanity, stay away."
TAMALPAIS ROAD TROUBLE
California Construction Company
Is Found Guilty of Contempt
and Fined.
Affidavits Allege That the Men Did
Not Know They Were Violat
ing an Injunction.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., March 30.â Judge
Ancelotti of the Superior Court to-day
found the California Construction Com
pany, which is encaged in building the
Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
Railroad, guilty of contempt and fined it
$25. This is the lirst fine ever imposed by
Judge Angelotti ana was occasioned by
the company laying about sixty feet of
rails on Corte Madera avenue in Mill Val
lej', in violation of an injunction issued
by Judge Angelotti at the instance of
Maurice Windmiller, who claimed the
running of the mountain road on this
avenue would damage his property.
The California Construction Company,
through its attorneys, filed a number of
affidavits in support of its contention that
the men did not know they were laying
rails on Corte Madera avenue. After the
reading of the affidavits Judge Angelotti
said that while the injunction had been
disregarded it was plainly evident that it
was done by accident, and the defend
ants had done everything in thej.r power
to remedy the matter, having pulled up
the track "the same afternoon it had beea
laid.
MILL VALLEY DIVORCE SUIT.
Mrs. Josephine liorgeson Accuses Her
Husband of Cruelty.
SAN RAFAEL. Cal., March 30.â The
domestic life of Mrs. Josephine Borgeson
of Mill Valley has not been a bed of roses,
according to her complaint for divorce
filed with the County Clerk to-day. She
accuses her husband, Henry Borgeson, of
almost every charge under the statute.
The Borgesons are well known in Mill
Valley, especially the husband, whose
craving for liquor'has led to all the trouble
between his wife and himself. It was be
lieved at one time that he was insane, for
not long ago in a drunken rage he threat
ened to murder his wife and children.
Deputy Constable E. E. Gray, who inter
fered, was assaulted by Borgeson with a
pair of pru:ung-shears, but the young dep
uty saved himself by a well-directed blow
with his fist. Borgeson was allowed his
freedom at the time on condition that he
would leave Mill Valley, but he kept com
ing back, and while under the intluence of
liquor has repeatedly beaten his wife and
applied vile epithets to her.

Desertion.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. March 30.-Charles F.
Wilcox and G. W. Appleton, trustees of
the estate of George \V. Rutherford, who
died in this city in February, 1801, to-day
petitioned the court for a partial distribu
tion of the estate to them. Under the will
the property, valued at $l_'M,ooo, was left

BARRO N CASE AGAIN.
Motion to Quash a Citation and Service-
Is Iten ied.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 30.â The mo
tion made by J. C. McKinstry, attorney
for the Protestant Orphan Asylum of San
Francisco, came up before Judge Reynolds
to-day.
M. C. Hassett and H. V. Morehouse
were present as the legal representatives
of George Barron, who had the citation in
question issued on a motion to revoke the
probate of his father's will. It being
proved that the citation and service as to
the Protestant Orphan Asylum had been
lost, the court ruled that the motion could
be made on a copy of those documents.
Attorney Hassett moved thatJ. C. Mc-
X in B try be excluded as not being i he prop
erly accredited attorney of the Protestant
Orphan Asylum, but the motion was de
nied, on the ground that Hassett had no
right to question the authority of an op
posing attorney. HasMtt'fl motion to
amend the return of service was also de
nied, and the attorneys then proceeded to
argue on theoriginal'motion.
McKinstry stated that the citation had
been served on Mrs. Edna McNear, matron
of the asylum, and not on the person or
persons properly in charge, and the re
turn was, therefore, clearly defective. He
argued that the law required it to be
proved that the service must be upon the
proper parties, and cited numerous au
thorities purjHjrting to have bearing on
the case.
Judge Reynolds denied the motion to
quanh the citation, stating that if the
| Protestant orphan asylum had not been
i served it was not bound by the judgment,
i and therefore could not reasonably com
plain. This decision leaves the case ex
acilv where it was before the motion was
i made.

WOODRUFF TO
LEAVE STANFORD.
A Popular Instructor Lost
to the Palo Alto
Students.
HE GOES TO CORNELL.
Tendered a Chair in the Law
Department of the Eastern
College.
END OF THE EASTER VACATION
Studies Resumed After a Brief Period
of Rest â The Presentation of
"Said Pasha."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., March
30. â President Jordan this afternoon re
ceived a dispatch from Professor Wood
ruff, who is now in the East on a leave of
absence, announcing liis resignation from
the Stanford faculty in order to accept a
|3000 professorship of law at Cornell.
Professor Edwin Hamlin Woodruff was
one of the youngest and brightest men in
Stanford's corps of professors. In 18Â»8 he
took the LL.B. degree at Cornell and was
at different times assistant librarian at the
Astor Library, chief cataloguer at the
Cornell University Library, instructor in
English at Cornell University and tnen
librarian of the Fiske Library at Florence,
Italy. He accepted the librarianship of
Stanford University Library while travel
ing abroad and in 18H3 became an instruc
tor in Jaw here. His wonderful aptitude j
for work made him a favorite with the
students, and he at once stepped to the
front as one of the most thorough instruc
tors at Stanford. Professor Abbott, at the i
head of the law department here, says [
that Professor Woodruff, who was ap- ;
pointed to a full professorship last year,
was one of the most skillful tutors in ele
mentary law and contracts in trie United ;
States.
Professor Woodruff in June last received :
a leave of absence for one year, being en
gaged with Professor Huffcut of Cornell in
compilation of a new law textbook. They
were already authors of a well-known text
book on cases in contracts. At that time or
a little later Professor Woodruff was offered
a chance at Cornell, but refused. Hi 3 loss
will be keenly felt at Stanford. Dr. Jor
dan says :
"Although his resignation has been ac
cepted, no steps as yet have been taken to
rill his chair."
Instruction began again to-day after the
week's Easter intermission. Many of the
| students are still absent, but ciass work
will not be delayed by that fact, ior
1 hard work begins at once with the open- ,
ing day. This begins the final eight weeks
of the college year.
The performance of the opera "Said
Pasha" is billed for April 11, and. the
scores of students who are to participate
are rehearsing diligently. A stage is in
process of construction in the gymnasium,
while the elaborate scenery and costumes
are to come from San Francisco. Those
in charge assert that this will be ooe of '
the most elaborate presentations of an
opera ever given by college students.
Stanford's glee and mandolin clubs have j
not yet returned from their tour of the
southern part of the State, but are ex
pected back to-morrow. Since the middle
of the montn these musical organizations
have given more than a dozen concerts,
and the tour has been comparatively suc
cessiul. It is probable that, financially, I
the clubs will not quite make expenses,
but the slight deficit is much more than |
offset by the good impression made on
their first tour.
Discussion on the question of a uniform
varsity sweater iÂ» not yet ended. The
final disposition of the matter will doubt
less be made at another student body
meeting, for that alone will satisfy the
football men.
OROVILLE EDITORS FIGHT
Result of a Feud Between the
Mercury and Register
Forces.
George H. Crossette and S. S. Boynton
Engage in a Hand-to-Hand
Contest.
CHICO, Cal., March 30.â A fierce storm
is raging on the journalistic sea of Oro
ville, and the whirlwinds of editorial
wrath are lashing the billows of vitupera
tion into a foam. Editor Crossette of the
Mercury accused the Register of being Re
publican "for revenue only" and its euitor
simply a partisan for Postofflce purposes.
Editor Boynton indignantly denies that
his party fealty is measured by dollars
and cents, and charges his accuser with
being a hypocrite, coward, liar ani Demo
crat.
About 3 o'clock this morning, as a result
of this squabble, a list tight too-k place near
the OroVille Register office between
George H. Crossette of the Mercury and S.
B. Boynton of the Register. Boynton was
badly battered about the head and face,
and mourns the loss of a necktie. Officer
Fox happened to be near and separated
the editors, and the matter has been
settled for a time. No great damage re
sulted from the set-to, but it has created
much excitement among the citizens, as
the editors are two of the oldest residents
of Butte County.

TO SAVE A GREAT INDUSTRY.
Output of the Mills Will Be Regulated
to Suit the Demandâ Effect '
. of the Change.
The redwood merchants and manu
facturers of California have united for
mutual protection under the business-like
title of "The Redwood Lumber Company."
Their object is to regulate the product of
Mendocino, Sonoma, Humboldt and Del
2sorte counties, and to raise the price of
redwood lumber to a figure that will assure
protit to the millmen.
It was a struggle for them to become
unanimous on some questions which are
practically determined by their associa
tion, and only last Saturday the solitary
and stubborn concern, the Casper Lumber j
Company, fell into line, and so completed j
the solidity of the organization. The full
list of redwood manufacturing houses was
then as follows :
Albion Lumber Company.
Caspar Lumber Company.
Couoneva Lumber Company.

understanding that the prices should be ;
subject to change without notice:

I p. list, which, it is understood, they
red exclusively.
We have notmng to say at present,"
tHe secretary ?-;iid,' "because we have not
I definitely on any one point. The
prices is under consideration, and t
v by Wednesday we will be able to I
â  Vown prices. The price list issued I
Saturday was really only a temporary
matter and does not count for much."
"Please understand us correctly," inter
the president. "We are not a com
bine or a compact agiinst public interest.
I neeu not tell you or the public that the ,
redwood lumber business has been carried j
on at a loss for nearly five years. Up
along the coast the riullmen have been
working two or three days a week and
for reduced wages. There was not a
Bring in the business. In fact redwood
has been selling right here in San Fran
cisco for less than it cost to get it out.
That is briefly all there is to tell of the
| condition thathas confronted us.
"We saw that nothing could be done to
| benefit the redwood industry, to keep it
! from demoralization, but for us to unite.
j This we have done. Our aim is to regu
i late the product of the mills according to
the demand and to raise the price enough
to give us a living profit. The capacity of
the mills far exceeds all demandsâ a con
dition that is not healthful.
"This is not such a dreadful thing as
some people might think. Ttie advance
in price will be about $1 a thousand feet.
Now, while that might appear big, it means
t at a man building a $15U0 or $2000 house
j will have to pay about $10 more for his
I lumber, ami a man putting up a $5000
i house must give $30 to $50 more. That is
all. but look at the other eide of the ques
tion.
"The $1 a thousand, which is but a trifle
to the buyer, means much to OS. It will
assure a profit and enable us to buy new
machinery and spend more money for la
bor. It will tend to prosperity, since it
will give an important industry a new
lease of life in California. Our association
cannot be a compact, because if it were
and we raised the prices too far the pine
i lumber would compete with us and drive
us from the market.''

this the output of Del N'orte and Sonoma

portion of the redwood product is sold out

REVISION OF THE BIBLE
It Is to Be Undertaken by the
Rabbis of England and
America.
DR. VOORSANGER A TRANSLATOR
The Work Specially Designed fcr
Jews â Expected to Be Completed
by 1898.
English-speaking Jews, more particu
larly those of this country and of Great
Britain, are soon to have a Bible, or at
least the Old Testament, which alone is
acknowledged to be an inspired work by
the descendants of Abraham and Jacob,
translated from the original Hebrew by
the most prominent rabbis of the two
countries named into English.
There has only been one previous at
tempt to translate Holy Writ directly into
English for the benerit of those of the
Jewish race who are unable to read it in
the original Hebrew, and there are to-day
multitudes of them in both the Old and
the New World all of whom, when desir
ous of becoming familiar with the word of
God a3 most recently interpreted, must
resort to the Gentile version.
It is to supply this Jack of a modern
translation from a Jewish standpoint that
the â work of preparing a new translation
has been undertaken by the Jewish Pub
lication Society of America, Philadelphia,
Pa. Rev. Dr. M. Jastrow of Germantown,
Philadelphia, Pa., has been honored with
the editorial supervision of the great work,
while on the revision committee are sucn
noted names as Rev. Dr. K. Kohler and
Rev. Dr. F. de Sola Mendes, both of New
York, and Rev. Dr. Herman Adler of
London. Eng., and Rev. Dr. Isaac M.
Wise of Cincinnati, Ohio, will be corre
sj>onding members of- the revision com
mittee.
Among those â who are to contribute to
the work is Rev. Dr. Voorsanger, the por>
ular rabbi of the Congregation Emanu-El
of thu City. The actual labor of transla
tion has been apportioned as follows:

There being no truer and purer democ
racy than the Jewish church there can be
no "so-called authorized version of the
translated Bible for the Jew, for there is
neither a King James to attest its correct
ness nor an iniallible Pope to give it hi 3
approval. Each Jewish synagogue is a
law unto itself, and there is consequently
no one who can claim to act or speak for
all the Jews, but this translation will
nevertheless have all the force of an
authorized version.
According to the instructions to the
translators, "the new translation of the
Bible has been undertaken with the object
of obtaining a version of the Holy Scrip
tures which, while taking full account of
the results of modern research, shall be
characterized by the simplicity of a book
to be used in the home and at public wor
ship."
The suggestion is then made that "as
the Jew considers the original text alone
invested with authority it should be our
aim to approach it as nearly as possible,
and for that reason we should avail our
selves of the extensive fund of traditional
and philological interpretations in our
Dossessioo."
T hese instructions further read : "Inas
mu :i as some basis must be adopted to
sacurt uniformity of style, and as the only
compl-te English translation prepared for
Jews and embodying Jewish traditions and
conceptions is that known as the Leeser
Bible, this; version has been chosen to serve
as a foundation for the proposed work.
At the same time the translators are ex
pected to consult the 'authorized version'
and the 'revised version,' the former as
the undisputed guide for diction and the
rhythmic How of language, the latter be
cause of its correction of many erroneous
renderinzs in the older versions in accord
ance with the advance of scholarship since
the days of King James."
All contributors are expected to hand in
their work not later than August 1, IHO7.
It will then have to undergo the scrutiny
of the revision committee and the editor
so that it is not likely that the edition will
be out much before the year 189*.
Rabbi Vooreanger has not yet begun the
task assigned him, but expects to shortly, i

HE WANTS BIG DAMAGES
Gardner Landon's Suit Against
the Tallant Bank Com
menced.
Â»
SENSATIONS ARE PROMISED.
The Five Criminal Indictments That
Were Quashed â Mr. Foote
Says "Blackmail."
The trial of the damage suit of Gardner
Landon against the Tallant Banking Com
pany was commenced in Judge Hunt's
court yesterday. Landon asked for $500,
--000 because the TaJlant Bank procured his
indictment on a charge of obtaining money
under false pretenses and then failed to
continue the prosecution.
Yesterday's proceedings were interest
ing only to those immediately involved In
the intricate tangle of live criminal indict-
Scene in Judge Hunt's Court During tbe Trial of Gardner Landon's Damage Suit
Against the Tallant Banking Company.
[Sketched in court yesterday by a "Call" artist.]
ments, several accommodation notes, the
lost books of the defunct Mutual Oil Com
pany and the ledgers of the Tallant Bank.
Nevertheless sensations are promised for
the near future.
Attorney George W. Monteith handles
the case for the plaintiff. Arrayed against
him is W. W. Foote as the active leader,
immediately assisted by 11. A. Pringle and
John Desbeck, and remotely aided by the
benevolent appearance of Reuben Lloyd
and the robust appearance of George A.
Knight.
The two latter counsel took no part in
the proceedings yesterday, and after M. H.
de Young, the proprietor* and J. P. Young,
the managing editor, of the Chronicle,
hava been examined, Knight and Desbeck
will probably retire from the case.
The story of the case begins in 1893, when
the Mutual Oil Company, of which Gard
ner Landon was the secretary and a prime
mover, became insolvent through the
machinations, it is claimed, of the Stand
ard Oil Company, assisted by the Tallant
Bank. When the bank withdrew it? credit
the Mutual Company failed, involving the
bank to the extent of some thousands.
Then Mr. Desbeck, on behalf of the bank,
secured certain depositions from the sign
ers of the notes indorsed by the Mutual
Oil Company, which note* proved worth
less to the bank that had advanced the
usual discount upon tnem. It is now the
contention of the plaintiff that these depo
sitions were not secured in the legal man
ner, and that they are not only false, but
fraudulent as well. The depositions were
from W. E. Rogers, Albert M. Panzer and
Oscar Jonnson. They are to the effect
that Landon and his partner Blank se
cured their signatures to the blank notes
of hand for sums ranging from $400 to
$14,000, though they did not owe the Mu
tual Oil Company any such amounts, and
were and always had been practically in
soivent. In effect these depositions charged
that Rogers, journeyman taiior, Panzer,
able seaman, and Johnson, journeyman
painter, conspired with Blank <fc Landon
to obtain money by false pretenses from
the Tallant Bank.
And upon the face value of these depo
sitions, corroborated by the statements of
John D. Tallant. president, and John Mc-
Kee cashier, of the bank, Litndon was in
dicted urkm hve separate counts.
But the case never came to trial, and
after hanging lire for a long time the in
dictments were quashed. "Malicious per
secution" says the plaintiff in the present
case, and Monteith claims for him, that
he was at all times ready and willing to be
tried; that the prosecution, under the
guidance of Attorney De-beck, always
sought and secured postponements; that
the bank secured injurious publications in
the Chronicle concerning Landon, and
tnat at last the indictments were quashed
in order to prevent Landon from securing
complete exoneration in the court.
Mr. Foote, for the defense, denied all
this yesterday. He said the reason for
quashing the indictments was the death of
Cashier McKee. McKee and Landon were
fellow church membersâ members of Dr.
Brown's church, in fact, and "brothers in
in the Lord," as Mr. Foote called them.
McKee had the utmost confidence in the
integrity of Landon, said Foote, and that
â was why these doubtful notes were ac
cepted by tie bank without question.
"This is blackmail," said Foote in conclud
ing his statement to the jury.
The jury, an intelligent set, was secured
without much trouble, its members are
J. J. Pastene, Thomas Blanchheld, John
F. Quale, Charles Whelan, Frank Matlan,
John Watkins, John Corbett, James
Badger, L. M. Ringwald, E. F. Heed,
Victor Williams, Ludwig Behrman.
Once Henry Root, the civil engineer, sat
in the box and had fears of being sworn
as a juror.
"Are you prejudiced against corpora
tions?" asked Mr. Foote.
"Well, I'm prejudiced against some of
them ; I don't believe every peanut stand
should incorporate," replied Mr. Root in
his Quick, nervous way.
"You think there are a good many of
them organized just to swindle the public,
don't you?" said Mr. Foote suavely and
insinuatingly.
"V*Â» â y â yes."
"Did *y<> v know the Mutual Oil Com
pany?"'
This was Mr. Foote's first point in the
case. He carried it off with gusto, but its
full "iorce and effect" was rather dulled a
moment later when Monteith asked of
Root:
"You have done a good deal of work for
the Central and Southern Pacific and for
the Market-street railroads, have you not?"
"Yes; quite a good deal in my line."
"Do you include these corporations
among those organized to swindle the
public?"
Judge Hunt was Sitting over by the win
dow in the sun reading a brief, but, of
course, he heard the question and looked
over his spectacles long enough to remark
that both sides had better stick to the
facts of the case in hand.
District Attorney Barnes was the first
witness. M. H. de Young and Jonn P.
Young have been subpenaed to testify.
Monteith expects to examine them to-day,
but he will have to best Lloyd and Knight
iv a pretty hot legal and technical battle
before he does it.
Mr. Barnes testified all about the indict
ments, or as much as he could remember,
and Mr. Foote was not allowed to ask him
whether he still thought Landon ought to
be indicted.
Mr. Foote afterward read the three depo
sitions unon which Mr. Barnes said he
very largely based his recommendations
for "true bills aeainst Landon.
In the afternoon Plaintiff Landon him
self became a witness. He denied all in
tention to defraud the bank and all ac
tions to tiiat effect. This morning he will
be cross-examined by Mr. Foote.

HE WILL REFUSE TO SIGN
Auditor Broderick Is Firm on
the Question of Regis
tration.
The Election Commissioners Are Still
Struggling With the
Problem.
Auditor Broderick announced yesterday
that if the election commission decided to
begin registration I*so days before election
instead of ninety days, as he believes the
law requires, he will refuse to audit the
warrants of the clerks who conduct the
registration.
The commission was having its usual
weekly wrestle with the registration ques
tion and trying to find its way out of the
muddle in which conflicting laws have
plunged it.
Auditor Broderick is firmly of the
opinion that the last Legislature in
tended to abolish precinct registration
by its amendments to the registration
act providing for the beginning of regis
tration 160 days instead of ninety days be
fore the general election. As the other
Commissioners were in doubt as to their
duties under the mixed condition of affairs,
they deemed it advisable to take the ques
tion into the courts, for this purpose
City Attorney Creswell moved to-day that
it was the sense of the commission that
there should be no registration of voters in
tne City for general election of 189(5, except
in accordance with the provisions of the
act of March 18, 1878, which requires regis
tration to begin ninety days prior to the
election, and tnat therefore authority
should not be given to the Registrar to
purchase stationery necessary for earlier
registration under a different act.
The motion was adopted, but Tax Col
lector Block and City Surveyor Tilton ex
plained that they voted for it only to ob
tain a decision. Should the courts not de
cide the matter in time they will be in la
vor of following the law of 18B&
The Mayor voted against the resolution
on the ground that should the Registrar's
office be tiea up by litigation until after
the time registration should begin under
the new law, and the courts should then
decide that the law of IKOo was to be fol
lowed, the election might be invalidated, j
The Tramp's Proposition.
A writer in the Independent tells a story
of a tramp whom he heard one day abus
ing his servant. "1 tuought," he said, "it
was time to Interfere. He said he was an
old soldier. 'Of the Evil One? I asked.
'Yes, of the devil; and if you will give me
a quarter I will come round to your prayer
meeting in these rags and warn the young
folks against falling into strong drink, like
I did.' 'You can't have the quarter,' said
I; 'and, what's more, we don't want
any dirty rapscallions parading their
vices a: our prayer-meetings.' 'Oh,
that's all rigut,' replied the cool
rascal. 'I Know where to get a
decent coat, and I will come around in it
and tell how I was rescued from the mire
by the blessed gospel. Only you must
make it 50 cents for the rescue and the
good coat.' I couldn't contain myself and
longer. I ordered the wretch off my ver
anda, and when he hesitated helped him
off. Then he stood around in the roya
and dared me to come down and tight."
Horse Flesh as Food.
The statistical bulletin of the French
Ministry of Agriculture, dealing wirh ttie
consumption of horse meat in Paris last
year, gives the number of horses killed for
consumption at 23,1^6, exclusive of 45 mules
and 383 donkeys. The total weight of
meat sold was 5130 tons, and this was
sold at ISO shops or stalls, which are not
allowed to sell any other kind of meat.
Prices range from 18 cents a pound for the
lillet to 4 cents a pound for the necks and
lower ribs. The report adds that not more
than a third of the meat is sold at the
stalls, the remainder ia used to make
sausages.
IT MAY BE ARBITRATED.
A Speedy Termination of the
Painters' Strike Looked
For.
IMPORTANT MEETING TO-DAY.
The Building Trades Council Anxious
to Settle Differences Without
Further Strife.
The most important feature in the
painters' strike yesterday was a conference
between the painting firm of St. Denis &
Co. and the grievance committee of ths
Building Trades Council. The purpose of
the interview was to arrange, if possible,
terms upon which a settlement of the
present troubles could be made. As St.
Denis & Co. is one of the largest employ
ing paint firms, it was believed that a set
tlement with them by arbitration would
lead to similar arrangements being made
with other firms.
Another conference will be held to-day
in St. Denis' office, at which the interested
parties will come to an understanding.
There will be present St. Denis and his
partner Macauley, Saunders and McCart
ney representing the Building Trades
Council and Ames and Shields represent
ing the painters' union.
The painters are canvassing the City for
the purpose of learning the exact stand
ing of every snop and contract.
The committee having in charge the
theatrical entertainment for the striking
painters stale that it will be a grand suc
cess. A friend of Mis 3 Annie Roney states
that the lady will be unable to sing at the
benefit to-morrow evening.
MAY YET BE SETTLED.
St. Denis & Co. Willing to Confer
With Representatives of the
Building Trades Council.
Tne prospect of a speedy settlement of
the painters' strike becomes brighter every
day. The matter has been virtually placed
in the hands of the Building Trades Coun
cil, of which the painters' union is a part,
and the grievance or arbitration commit
tee of the council i 3 hard at work endeav
oring to adjust the differences so that both
interested parties will be satisfied. It is
the wish of the council to start the work
ing-card system on Thursday with a clear
tield and no strike to combat.
To this end two of the committee called
upon St. Denis it Macauley, one of the
largest linns employing painters and who
declined to yield to the demands of the
striking pauiters. This firm has the con
tract to do the painting on the big Parrott
building. Committeemen McCartney and
Saunders called at St. Denis 6c Macaulev's
office, and the interview was very friendly
and evidently very satisfactory to both
parties. The painters said that they do
not like this trouble with the union jour
neymen, but they do not wish to concede to
ail that is demanded. They want some
voice in the matter of laborers, appren
tices, foremen, etc. On a number of the
other points they are not opposed to the
union and are willing to be lair and meet
the journeymen more than half way.
Mr. St. Denis said that in the matter of
wages and hours he is paying as high or
higher wages tnan is demanded as the
minimum rate by the union, and he offered
to show his payroll to the committee.
There was one matter that he feared would
interfere with a satisfactory settlement and
that was that the union painters are not
inclined to concede any points.
Committeeman McCartney told Mr. St.
Denis that the strike has been placed in
the hands of the Building Trades Coun
cil, which authorized the grievance com
mittee to make every effort tolbring about
an amicable settlement of the existing
differences.
Mr. Macauley answered that if he could
deal with the representatives of the Build
ing Trades Council he would be pleased
to adjust the matter and he believed that
a settlement satisfactory to all parties
could be arrived at. He for one would be
willing to receive such a commute and
discuss the situation in detail. He would,
however, insist that the com -littee be
authorized to make and agree to such
terms as would be decided as being to the
best interest of all.
Mr. Saunders called attention to the fact
that on April 1 the Building Trades
Council's working card will go into effect
and the presence of non-union men on
jobs with union workmen would surely be
productive of other complications. This
would be very undesirable, and it is to
avoid such annoyances that the committee
is now striving.
As stated the interview was very satis
factory to all present and resulted in the
first steps leading to a settlement being
made. It was acreed that this afternoon
St. Denis <t Macauley will again meet
Saunders, McCartney and two represent
atives frona the painters' union. All mat
ters bearing on the card system, wages,
hours, journeymen, apprentices, laborers,
foremen, etc., will be discussed and no
doubt arraneed to the satisfaction of all.
Mr. St. Denis assured the committee
that in the conference to-day it must be
understood that he and his partner will
simply represent the firm and not the
Master Painters' Association.
A SPIRITED MEETING.
Two Commltteemen Appointed to
Meet the Building Trades Dele
gates In Conference.
An animated meeting of the Painters'
Union was held last evening at 115 Turk
street.
Nearly the whole session was devoted to
the discussion of a report sent by the
grievance committee of the Building
Trades Council upon the proposition of
holding a conference with St. Denis, de
tailed elsewhere in this column. The re
port stated that Mr. St. Denis will ask for
one foreman to eight men; and further,
that his firm would sign an agreement
with the union upon the lines of the
mutual understanding with the Building
Trades committee.
After much discussion it was decided to
send Mr. Ames and Mr. Shields to repre
sent the Painters' Union, and they will re
port to the union at 7 p. m. the result of the
conference.
The conference will be held to-day in
the office of J. St. Denis & Co., on S utter
street, near Grant avenue.
The recommendation of the grievance
or arbitration committee is not final, al
though it is likely to be accepted by the
council. The full delegation to the coun
cil will act upon the report on Thursday
night.
If the decision of the council be not ac
cepted by the Painters' Union the refusal
will amount to the withdrawal of their
delegates from the council, and they would
have to hght tfceir battles alone and un
supported. It is not at all likely that the
latter situation will arise.
The relief committee was instructed to
discontinue soliciting help from the pub
lic for the striking painters after the
money already promised is collected. This
order does not apply to the entertainment
committee haying the theatrical enter
tainment benefit in hand.
Special committees reported that the
Coast teamen's Union had subscribed $25
ana taken forty benefit tickets. The Plas
terers' Union purchased $50 worth of tick
ets.
Twelve new members were initiated.
Special couuuiUeea reported Jour noa
union men and two paperhangers at work
for Frazier in Armory Hall on Ellis street.
Two non-union men are at wort on Kae's
job on Filbert street. Two men from New
York are at work on Frazier's job on Mis
sion street.
The committee in charge of the picnic to
be held in Sunset Park on May 17 reDorted
that everything was ready for the merry
makers.
READY FOR THE CARD.
The Painters' Union Gathering Im
portant Data for the Building
Trades Council.
The usual morning meeting of striking
painters was held yesterday at 115 Turk
street, and great satisfaction was expressed
at the present situation of the strike. Re
ports were received from many shops
showing that the influence of the union is
spreading, and that there are more union
shops now than there were a week ago.
The large force of union painters who re
turned to the friendly bosses have been a
great benetit to the union, as they are ail
contributing to the relief of those who are
still out on strike and who are in want.
The relief committee has its hands full of
business, and is assisting many worthy
people. There are a number who are
endeavoring to impose upon the commit
tee, but that Is to be expected in large or
ganizations. The relief committee, how
ever, carefully investigates every applica
tion for help, and very few unworthy peo
ple have succeeded in imposing upon the
committee.
Considerable preparation was made for
the reception of the building trades' work
ing card on the Ist. In order to learn the
status of every job and shop in the City
fifteen investigating committees were se
lected. Their duty will be to visit every
place in the City" where painters are at
work and secure positive proof as to the
character thereofâ whether union or non
union. Each committee as soon as it cov
ers its district will report to the union,
and that body will prepaie a complete re
port, which will be presented to the Build
ing Trades Council. It will rest with the
council to enforce the union rules ana the
card system.
The union has in its possession now an
interesting report. It is a list of all the
painters in the City, and shows wbo are
true union men, non-union men and union
men who have proved false to their obliga
tions. It is likely that the latter will be
dealt with by and by more severely than
those who never joined the union." This
list may be placed in the hands of the
walking delegates of the Building Trades
Council on April 1.
The Carpenters.
Carpenters' Union No. 483 met last
night in B'nai B'rith Hall, A. E. Carlisle
presiding.
Sixteen candidates were initiated, ard
the union purchased $25 worth of tickets
for the painters' benefit. It also adopted a
resolution to stand by tne Painters' I'mon.
The cards were issued to go into opera
tion to-morrow.
On next Thursday night there will be a
mass-meeting of the carpenters' unions of
this City in the Temple for the purpose of
discussincr the card system and other mat
ters of interest to the trade.
The Plasterers' Union.
At the meeting of the Plasterers' Union
last evening D. Sullivan was re-elected
president; J. Kyan was elected vice-presi
dent: John Lawless, recording: secretary;
D. Marron, financial secretary; P. Cor
coran, sergeant-at-arms; trustees â Georpe
Wheaton, William O'Brien and Michael
Kelly. The union issued cards that are to
go into operation to-morrow, and pur
chased $50 worth of tickets for the Paiflters'
Union benefit.
The Iron Moulders.
The iron moulders at their meeting last
night. W. T. Bouce in the chair, received
a delegation from the Painters' Union and
after listening to the statement they had
t to make the union decided to give the
i painters its moral and financial support
and to patronize the benefit to be given
for the painters.
A delegation from the Labor Council also
waited on the union and after some dis
cussion on the matter it was decided by a
unanimous vote to stand by the Labor
Council and not have anything to do with
the Alliance on the ground that it is a po
litical organization and the union does not
desire to mix in politics.
SELF-SUPPORTING INDIANS.
Hoopa Valley Agency to Be Abolished.
Red yten I'nder State Laws.
Captain W. E. Dougherty, First Infantry,
U. S. A., who is on duty as agent of the
Indians at the Hoopa Valley reservation,
returned from Washington yesterday.
While in that city he had a long confer
ence with the representatives of the Inte
rior Department.
He will return to the agency shortly and
proceed to put things in shape to give the
Indians a fair trial of government under the
laws of California, without advice or re
straint on the part of the United States
Government.
The captain believes that these Hoopa
and Klnmath Indians are now able to
goverr: themselves under the laws of this
State. They are self-supporting now, and
sJightly increasing in number. All ot the
youth can read and write, and some of the
older Indian? can do the Â«ame. The land
has been allotted and is all under cultiva
tion.
"I propose," said Captain Dougherty,
"to abolish the agency and allow the In
dians to proceed with self-government
under the laws of this Â£tate. Yes, the
young men have the knowledge and edu
cation to serve as Supervisors, Trustees and
School Directors.''
'â¢Has this scheme been tried at any
other Indian agency?" was asked.
Captain Dougherty replied: "Not to
my knowledge, but it must have a begin
ning. I believe that these Indians, num
bering 1800, will get along very well. They
are industrious. The land is cultivated
intelligently and profitably. No, I do not
think that saloons and dancehouses
can be introduced to corrupt the Indians.
The land has been allotted and that
diminishes the danger of such Invasion."

The passage of the funding bill would
not be sufficient to maintain the Southern

it fights foreclosure.
Among the things that need explanation
just at this time is the curious fact that
the Armenians are asking aid of everybody
except the Russians t who are their kins

Christian neighbors.
France has had little to say during the
recent babblement over African affairs,
but perhaps the order for the reserve
I .squadron of the fleet to bold itself in read
iness for war may be considered a case of
\ pawing wood and talking at the same time.
FIGHTING THE CANAL.
It may be much easier for the people of
the Pacific Coast than for those of the
Eastern States to understand why the
Southern Pacific Company is nsinj; its in
tluence against the proposed measures for
governmental aid in construction and con
trol of the Nicaragua canal, but to the
Western mind the ground for the opposi
tion is clear enough. It is now said that
the friends of the canal proposition are
determined to blocK the funding bill until
the Nicaragua question baa been decided.
It the present indications of Mr. Hunting
ton's strcneth In Washington are not mis
leading this contest may result in a com
plete victory for the Southern Pacific, both
with regard to its funding bill and thÂ«
suppression of competition by way of the
Nicaragua canal.
In an able discussion of the report made
by the Government engineers sent to in
spect the canal, Captain W. L. Merry has
presented to the readers of The Call some
facts that deserve the attention of Con
gress. It will be remembered that tue cost
of construction, as computed by the en
gineers, was $133,472,893, while that of the
company's engineers was $69,893,(W0, or
about half. While the larger estimate in
cludes expenditures for double-track con
>truction railways, an increased number
of locks, larger dimensions of canal sec
tions, $4,000,000 for management, $500,000
for lights and buoys, and $1,000,000 for
sanitariums, the greatest difference is pro
duced by the high units of cost adopted by
the Government engineers. These are from
SO to 40 per cent higher than are being paid
at the Chicago Drainage and Ship Canal;
whereas labor is much cheaper in Nicaragua
than at Chicago and work can be prosecuted
more rapidly by reason of the absence
of ice. Captain Merry, while showing that
the units of cost adopted by the Govern
ment engineers are manifestly too high,
points out a curious inconsistency between
that feature of the report and the one as
serting that from 15,000 to 120,000 Jamaica
negroes, excellent laborers, are available
at fair wages. It seems impossible to re
concile these two antagonistic leatures of
the report.
The very short time taken by the Gov
ernment engineers for studying the situa
tion, and their evident desire to be more
safe with their estimates, may be taken to
explain the high figures which they pro
mulgated. Unfortunately, however, this
is an official report, and Mr. Huntington
hardly requires the services of Mr. Xhnnio
in urging reasons against a proposition
which would break his monopoly of trans
portation between the Pacific and the
Atlantic, and, like the reduction of railroad
fares proposed by the California Kailroad
Commission, "impair the earning capacity
of the aided roads."
A MEASURE OF DEFENSE.
Pan Francisco has repeatedly demon
strated that when once properly aroused
to action she is capable of protecting and
preserving her interests. In the present
controversy between the local merchants
and Goodall, Perkins & Co. regarding the
treatment to be accorded to San francisco
in connection with the competition of
Portland, Or., for the business of Eureka
the San Francisco people have been
taunted with asking concessions in face of
possessing the natural advantage of being
more closely situated to Eureka and of
having a better transportation service to
and closer business relations with the port
of Humboldt Bay.
The concession asked for is a difference
in rates from San Francisco and Portland
respectively to Eureka, based on mileage.
This rate at present is $1 per ton from
either point to Humboldi Bay, but it is
claimed by the transportation companies
and admitted dv shippers that this is not
a profitable rate. It is a war rate and one
that is not likely to be maintained for
any great length of time. With the re
organization of the Transcontinental
Traffic Association will come a better
feeling among all the competing lines em
braced in it, and it is highly probable that
the local war that has raged for more than
half a year between the Southern Paciiic
Company and the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company will be settled and
harmony restored, with accompanying
peace rates on freight and passenger busi
ness. This consummation will also ease
up the strain on the Eureka controversy
and rates will be readjusted so as to leave
a reasonable profit to the carriers.
But the lesson taught the merchants of
San Francisco should be heeded. There
has been frequent talk of extending the
Donahue line to connect with the Eel
River road and thus give Eureka rail
facilities to San Francisco and the whole
outside world, and this scheme has been
revived within the past few days. It is
claimed by President Foster of t!;e Dona
hue that suca a through line would not
pay at current rates with the existing
amount of business. Undoubtedly he is
right, but railroads are seldom built in
expectation of immediate dividends.
There can be little question, however, that
if this project were carried out normal
ratet- and the natural increase in traffic
that would be sure to come with the de
velopment stimulated by the existence of
the railroad would soon put the road on a
satisfactory footing for the stockholders.
To all these reasons why San Francisco
capital should enter this lield is the added
one now causing so much contention and
anxiety â the competition of Portland in
the Eureka field. If Portland is once
allowed to wean any considerable portion
of this trade from San Francisco the joint
efforts of the Portland merchants and the
transportation company operating the
water route between Eureka and Portland
will make it a difficult matter to recover
that business. Prompt and energetic
action is necessary.
A BEVY OF QUEENS.
A pretty feature of the festivals which a
number of California cities are preparing
to hold is the selection of a "queen" to
lend an added charm to the occasion. The
custom is so old that its beginning is lost
in the mists of the vanished ages. It is a
tribute to the grace and beauty of the sex
that mankind was glad to pay even before
the dawn of chivalry. Even in these
practical times what Mayday celebration
is complete without its May Queen, wear
ing her crown of roses and graciously re
ceiving the adulation of her subjects of an
hour?
The custom has always been fitted to
pastoral times and countries. With the
growth of large cities and the consequent
sinking of individualities, hardening of
custom and character and creation of class
distinctions, it has necessarily fallen into
unpopularity in the great centers of popu
lation, but in the rural districts of the
civilized world, where life is simpler and
freer, where one knows all one's neigh
bors and the beauties of nature still keep
the heart green and a wholesome life
lends roses to the cneeks of the maidens.
the custom is observed with all its old
sweetness, and thus it will continue to the
end of time.
And where better than in California can
it be becomingly cherished? The finer
happiness, health and freedom here are
associated with the industries to which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1896.
the natural charms of the State give life.
The tiller of the tree and vine, even he
who grinds out a mere livelihood or a
competency from the commonplaces of
trade or profession in close neighborhood
with orchards and vineyards, takes on too
gentler temp3r that comes from the asso
ciation. The cities and towns environed
with these peaceful scenes contain a popu
lation in harmony with them, and so
queens of festivals and Maydays represent
what is best and most wholesome in Cali
fornia.
Sunshine so constant and genial, Hovers
so gorgeous and abundant, and fruits so
rich in substance, fragrance and color
need a queen to stand forth as the cham
pion and exponent of their worth, to ex
press their grace and beauty and give evi
dence ot their value. And we shall have
May queens and queens of festivals so long
as California retains its charms and men
and women accept their benefits.
THE RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.
According to all reports from Washing
ton California will be served fairly well in
the river and harbor bill, which will prob
ably be reported to the House to-duy. We
shall not get all we asked for, of course,
but there are reasons for believing that
this Congress has had a better understand
ing of our needs than any which has
recently preceded it and that within the
limits of economy which the condition of
tue treasury imposes some of our long
needed river and harbor improvements
will be undertaken.
Something of this kind was, of course, to
be expected. The Republican party has
always been the champion of internal im
provements. It has favored everything
that tends to improve the condition of the
people, advance public welfare and develop
the resources of the country. The present
Republican majority has been hampered
in work of this kind by the deficit in the
revenues caused by the Democratic tariff.
It cannot, of course, do so much as it
would otherwise have done, since the lack
of revenues has made a restriction in public
improvements a matter of necessity.
The enforced economy resulting from
Democratic bungling will of course have
weight in determining public judgment
upon the bill when it has been reported
and the details made known. If all the
improvements we have a right to hope for
from the Government are not provided for
to an extent sufficient at least to make a
beginning the people will know the reason
why. Meanwhile we are pretty sure of
better treatment than we ever received
from a Democratic Congress, and if such
information as has leaked out at Washing*
ton be correct the bill as a whole is likely
to be fairly satisfactory to the Pacific
Coast.
In one respect at any rate we have been
more than usually fortunate this year.
The contest against the funding bill has
united the California delegation as it was
never united before, and as a consequence
there has b;en more harmonious and
more vigorous work for all California
interests, it is pleasing to note that
Representative Herman of Oregon, from
the vantage ground of his position on the
River and Harbor Committee, has been
very helpful to every California interest
that came before it. He has not been
afraid that he would nurt his own State by
helping another on the coast, and his
course in this respect merits the recogni
tion, the commendation and the thanks of
all Californiftns.
THE IMPROVED NAVY.
The marine engineers of San Francisco
and elsewhere are properly urging the
paÂ«safje of the Wilson bill to reorganize
and increase the efficiency of the navy.
This country has been very slow to ap
preciate the revolutionary effect produced
by the modern high development of
marine steam machinery. It is now more
than a mere matter of driving vessels by
steam instead of sails, for both high speed
and the employment of steam for working
the heavy armaments of warships have
introduced complications imposing the
severest exactions on engineering skill.
While this standard of duties has been
raised enormously there has been nothing
like a corresponding increase in the num
ber of engineers and their official grade in
the service. The Wilson bill is intended to
cure these shortcomings along with others.
England show? a better understanding
iof the matter. Her men-of-war carry a
! larger number of engineers than ours.
j Compare, for instance, the American
Cincinnati of 10,000 horsepower and the
British SybiHe of 9000 horsepower. The
i Cincinnati carries eight Jine officers and
the Sybille six. But when it comes to en
gineers we find the Cincinnati with three
j and the smaller English vessel with four.
The same disproportion exists in the case of
the American Bennington when compared
with the English Brisk. On the other
hand, we find that some of the American
ships have twice as many line officers as
the same class of ships in the English
navy, while the English ships almost in
variably have more engineers than ours.
The Wilson bill, besides increasing the
number of engineer?, raises their rank and
thus justly recognizes their skill and re
sponsibility. The present attitude of the
line officers toward the engineers is a rem
nant of the time when steam was in its
infancy as a factor in determining the ef
ficiency of a fighting ship. The bill ny
raising the dignity and rank of the engi
neering corps removes the unwillingness
of young men to enter the naval academy
for the purpose of learning the engineer's
art and thus reduces the pressure for posi
tions as line officers. In these days of
very high attainments necessary to handle
the machinery of a modern warship it is
time that the efficiency of the navy should
be increased by investing the engineer
corps with the dignity and prestige it so
eminently deserves.
The resolutions adopted by a Democratic
convention in Missouri on Saturday con
gratulating Cleveland on his ability as a
duck shooter and expressing regret that
he had not devoted more time to killing
teal and less In issuing bonds have just
enough of jest and earnest in them to be
fully representative of the American
humor of the day.
The deficit in the revenues for March
shows that once more Carlisle's sanguine
hopes were unfounded and that business
has not revived as much as the administra
tion hoped for. It certainly should now
be clear, even to the free-traders them
selves, that the low tariff is a failure, and
there will be no complete prosperity until
we return to protection.
The reported alliance of Republicans
and Populists in the Southern States may
be fairly good politics under the excep
tional conditions that prevail there* but in
the Nation at large this is going to be a
year of straight politics, and to the people
all illogical combinations will seem
crooked.
King Menelek claims to be a lineal de
scendant of King Solomon and the Queen
of Sheba, and, under the circumstances,
the claim goes, but if he had not proven
himself srch a good fighter everybody
would have called him a liar.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
GOLD MEN DEFIANT.
Silver Men Are Challengedâ Line of Battle
Drawn.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sin:
The Slogan, 'Ninety-six or Never, clearly an
nounces the stand taken by the gold men.
The largest commercial organization in the
United States, the New York Chamber of Com
merce, met in that city March 5 and as the ad
vance guard of the money power made a demon
stration in force against silver men and issued
this declaration:
"To the commercial bodies and business men
of the United States: The Chamber of Com
merce of the State of New York believes that
the time has come for a movement on the part
of the commercial bodies and all men â¢ â¢ â¢â¢:
to create a strong public opinion in behalf of
an unequivocal declaration : by the political
conventions of both the great parties in favor
of the 'gold standard' and the elimination of all .
doubtful expressions in respect to the free coin
age of silver."
They further declare: "Therefore we ask all
citizens to unite in a vigorous effort to urge
the selection ot delegates to the political con
ventions of both great parties who will advo
cate clear and distinct platform utterances in
favor of the maintenance of the present gold
standard of value.'' â¢-â¢ Â«. â - -..,-..< \
||Six days later, March 11, the execu
tive council of the American Bankers'
Association "held a meeting at the Cham
ber of Commerce in New York City and
the dispatch says that "members from all
parts of the country were present." and the
council .unanimously adopted the following:
JtcxnlvftJ, By the executive council of the Ameri
can Banners' Association, that it declares un
equivocally in favor of the maintenance of the ex
istlns; cold standard of value and recommends to
all bankers and the customers of all banks to ex
ercise all their influence as citizens in their vari
ous States to select delegates to the political con
ventions of both great parties who will declare un
equivocally in favor of the existing standard of
value.'
These bankers seem to be making history.
The next day, March 24, the New York State
Republican Convention met and placed these
words in the financial plant of its platform:
"The agitation for the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 1G to 1 seriously disturbs all in
dustrial interests and calls for a clear state
ment of the Republican attitude upon this
question, to the end that the trade of the coun
try at home and abroad may again be placed
upon a sound and stable foundation." Then,
niter denouncing "the movement for the free
coinage of silver' as "an attempt to degrade
th". long-esiablished standard of our monetary
system, and hence a blow to public and pri
vate credit," they declare that "\vbile;gold re
mains the standard of the United States ana of
the civilized world the Republican party of
New York declares itself in favor of the firm
and honorable maintenance of that standard."
Passing by the high compliment paid Japan
as no part of the civilized world, I wish to re
mark that to the average Populist it would
seem as if one great State of the Union accepts
the terms of the money power in complete do
cility; for it is not to be presumed possible
that the Cleveland Democracy of New York
will favor the free coinage of silver.
But there was another great State heard from
by the American Bankers' Association on the
same day. Minnesota spoke on the '24th day
of March also, through the Republican State
Convention, and this was the message sent to
the money power: "We are earnestly opposed
under the present conditions to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver," and believing
that "international remonetization of that
metal" is the true course, "the Republican
party of Minnesota most heartily favors an in
ternational conference."
To-day's news (March 2(i) is far more sieni/I
cantâis, in fact, rather startling. Pettigrew's
silver State, South Dakota, yesterday declared
through the Republican State Convention for
MeKinley and "sound money." "There was not
a dissenting vote" in favor hi silver, the dis
patch informs us, and adds that "Senator
Petiigrew made a powerful fight to prevent any
expression on the silver question," but to no
purpose. The eight delegates elected are
pledged "not only to vote but to work for
'sound money' at the Republican National
Convention," which meets at St. Louis June
10.
Thus one Republican silver State had fallen
prone in gold dust at the feet of the money
power. Poor Pettigrewfell with his State, say
ing that he "bowed to the will of the major
ity," and took the pledge to work for "sound
money" with the other delegates. Bin this
did not sayÂ« him from further humiliation,
for we aro told that "the other sevan delegates
held a meeting and pledged themselves not to
allow Pettigrew to be on the credentials or
platform committee at St. Louis or to vote for
National commiiteeman"; and thus a distin
guished United States Senator Is humiliated
because he has strenuously advocated the free
coinage of silver. Indeed, we are told that
'â 'it was proposed for a time to leave Pettigrew
off the delegation, but the Senator had threat
ened, in a speech In Sioux Falls, that his de
feat meant a Populistic victory," and "the lead
ers decided that the lnterestsof the party were
opposed to further humiliating him."
The situation of the silver forces, thus chal
lenged by the money power, is reserved for
another occasion, as I have reached the limits
of my letter. Poor Pettigrew! I fear he has
one other misfortune in storeâ his name will
become a by-word to characterize other* who
may "Pettigrew" themselves.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
SLAVONIANS IN AMERICA.
San Francisco, March 27, 189 G.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sib: As pub
lished in your valuable paper of March 24 a
certain Major Ryan addressed on the previous
evening a large audience in the Metropolitan
Temple. Among other things this stevedore
to use his own wordsâ said that "the Slavo
nians are the most ignorant race ot people in
the worldâ people who come to this country
with a torch in one hand and a stick cf dyna
mite in the other." *
Such a calamity and vituperation is worthy
only of a background. The Slavonians are a
law-abiding and peace-loving people and dyna
mite they ablior just as much as Ryan detests
the truth. Kvan cannot name a single in
stance where Slavonians were mixed up witn
any rioting.
Most of the Slavonians come to this country
with small capitals, buy land and cultivate it;
raise cattle and are good and experienced
ranchers. They become citizens of the United
States and are happy to enjoy the freedom
which is denied them in their fatherland.
They never land as paupers and very few of
them take the hard-earned money back to
Europe. They settle to stay and soon assimi
late with Americans.
Speaking of the colonizers of Mendocino
County especially, let us explain to Ryan that
the statistics show that there are only 1% per
cent of illiterate people in a population of
1,500,000â i. c., the provinces of Carniolia and
Styriaâ where the colonizers come from. And
mind you that the statistics were compilated
trader supervision of the Austrian Government,
which is all but just to Slavonions. Ryan
knows absolutely nothing of the Slavonions.
We can find only one reason why the would
be reformer detests Slavoniansâ it is that they
prefer hard work to bumming from town to
town and Indulging in malicious insinuations
und attacks on foreigners.
admire the zeal of Ryan, but still more
do we admire the simplicity of the A. P. A.'s
who allow such an ignoramus to deliver ad
dresses under their auspices.
If Americanism is threatened by a handful of
honest Slavonians, surely a poorer defender
than Ryan could not have been found. Re
spectfully yours, Mato Zvanxjt.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
San Luis Gbispo Keasoner.
In this connection we desire again to call the
attention of our readers to the large amount of
space that is devoted to impartial news of our
party by the San Francisco Call. The Call is
bolidly Republican, but it shows an impar
tiality and a disposition to give the news that
has never been shown by either the Kxaminer
or the Chronicle. On the contrary, two years
ago both these papers systematically suppressed
and avoided every item of news tiiat they were
not forced to give. The Call is giving much
Bpace to "Letters From the People," in which we
notice that Populist writers are a.s numerous
as any. and seem to be allowed to express
their sentiments with very little censorship.
This is a matter of considerable interest to
Populists in this State who wish to get news
that can only be had through the dailies. Jf
THE Call continues its policy during the cam
paign it should be patronized by Populists to
tne exclusion of the other San Francisco news
papers. In its issue of the 21st The Call gives
a long review of the situation, including inter
views with leading Populists and bimetallists,
from the reading of which the foregoing edi
torial was suggested, and in which it alludes
to Mr. Johnson, quoted above, as being an able
writer in the cause of Populism, who has at
tracted the attention of politicians throughout
the State by his letters in The Call.
A HANDSOME CAPE.
So long as sleeves^do not decrease in dimen
sions capes will lose none of their deserved
popularity. Jaunty garments reaching only to
the waist are worn, even on the coldest days,
a chamois jacket worn under the waist making
this possible. The richest materials are em
ployed in fashioning these garments. Fur
overlaid with a very open design in cloth or
velvet, which is edged all over with beads, is
one of the newest fancies. The cloth or velvet
is only lightly tacked on and is easily removed,
leaving the fur intact. Persian lamb, with
green velvet or brown cloth, is rich and hand
some; others show a yÂ«ke of fur with the cape
of velvet or cloth, edged with a band oi fur to
match the yoke. Such a cape of bluet cloth,
with beaver trimming, made to match a cos
tume of the same, makes a handsome calling
sown for a young lady. Brown cloth, with
skirt to match, trimmed with mink as shown
in our illustration, makes a very swell cos
tume, with a waist or Louis XV coat of figured
light but subdued green silk. Tails of mink
ornament the front of the cflpe.
A cape of preen velvet with sable trimmings
may be made even more dressy by the addi
tion of lace arranged at the throat in jabot
effect on both sides, with two crushed roses as
a finish.
Theater and opera capes of light velvet are
charming of crushed rose velvet with sable
and lace trimmings.

Washington's Signatureâ C. R. 8., Berkeley,
Cal. There are no large collectors of auto
graphs in this City. In the city of New York
the signature of George Washington to letters

collectors of autographs would offer for "a
blank parchment certificate of the Society of
thfc Cincinnati, which is signed by George
Washington as president thereof and J.
Kuox, secretary. The Call is unable to
learn, as several curio hunters of this City
refused to plact any valuation on it. One of
these said: "If it is genuine, it is worth just
what some individual who would like to be
possessed of it would be willing to pay for it."
Theodore op Abyssiniaâ A. S., City. Theo
dore, King of Abyssinia, when the Egyptians
in 1862 were advancing on his territory wrote
letters to the French and English governments
claiming their protection. 1 hat to the Queen
of England was delayed on the way and over
looked after reaching London and was not
answered for two years. The answer from
France to his letter was unfortunately worded.
Theodore became irritated, threw the British
Consul and missionaries into prison and vio
lently maltreated other European residents.
After this period, in 1863, he conducted him
self like a madman, causing women and chil
dren to be tortured, dishonored and murdered,
"Out of 3,000,000," says Dr. Blanc. 1867, "he
has destroyed more than one-third by war,
famine and murder. After unsuccessful
attempts to negotiate with Theodore, followed
by a refusal to notice the demand to deliver the
prisoners, a British expedition of more than
10,000 soldiers was fitted out st Bombay for
invasion of the tablelands of Abyssinia, and
\pril 18, 1868, it came within sight of Mag.
dala April 10, near Magdala, Theodore gava
battle to the British forces and was defeated.
He then surrendered the European captives
and retired into Magdala. The place w aa
cairied by storm on the 13th with httLe diffi
culty. There was no less of life on the British
side and only a few men were wounded. The
Abvssinians lost 500 killed and 1500 wounded ;
tne" King himself was found among the dead,
he having committed suicide."

Mrs. Susan Martin shot and fatally
wounded her husband, John F. Martin, a
deputy County Clerk, yesterday morning
at 9:30 o'clock in a corridor of the City
JOHN F. MARTIN, THE DEPUTY COUNTY CLERK WHO WAS SHOT BY HIS WIFE
Hall at the entrance to Chief Crowley's
-office.
The woman is a frail and sickly little
thing, upon whose face deep lines of care
and worriment have settled, and as she
lay sobbing hysterically after the shoot
ing on a cot in the matron's room at the
City Prison, she was no more the same
buxom and pretty girl who as one of the
Wilde Bisters delighted the audiences at
the variety theaters of this City.
Two years ago she married the roan she
shot yesterday. At that time she and her
sister were playing at the Bella Union
Theater, where he was working as a bar
tender for Ned Foster, the proprietor.
Subsequently Foster, who married one of
the girls, presented Martin with the down
stairs barroom, that he might do better
for himself and Susie, whom he had asked
in marriage.
Martin proved to be a model husband
for the first year. Then he had a severe
spell of sickness and was )aid up for
many weeks. His wife watched and
nursed him night and day until Dr. C. W.
Card, who was in charge, had to compel
her retirement. From 167 pounds she had
fallen away to a mere skeleton and she
soon required the physician's attention
herself.
It was at that time that her husband's
bad traits came to the surface. Having
recovered his health he deserted his wife
and home and began a series of misdeeds
that culminated in driving the woman to
attempt bis life. He drank very heavily
and especially after the first of the month
when he would receive his wages for
driving the California police patrol wagon
he would go on sprees which would in
variably leave him a penniless and broken
down man.
Mrs. Martin and a 10-year-old son of her
husband by a former marriage frequently
had to call upon Ned Foster and his wife
for the necessaries of life. Martin never
took any money home, and quite re
cently the landlord of their home at 545
California street threatened to eject them
unless the long overdue rent was forth
coming.
A short time ago Mrs. Martin was
obliged to send the boy to Mrs. Daniel
O'Keefe's home to be cared for. The lat
ter lady is a sister of Martin and she pre
ferred assuming charge of the lad rattier
than see him starve.
Martin, who secured a position as dep
uty County Clerk about one month ago,
MRS. JOHN F. MARTIN.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAKCH 31, 1896.
discounted his warrant last Saturday and
immediately started out on a debauch.
He failed to go home, and on Sunday
night he was conspicuous in a drunken
state in the saloons about the City Hall.
His unfortunate wife, who is in a deli
cate condition, started out early yesterday
morning hoping to find him and take
him home. She carried an English bull
doe pistol, which she secured some weeks
ago, and was determined if her search was
unsuccessful to put an end to her own
life. She had already many times before
said she found her life unbearable and
would end it in suicide.
Taking her station on McAllister street,
near Larkin, she saw her husband step off
the car.
"Jack!" she exclaimed, running toward
him. "Jack, won't you please come home
to me; my heart is just breaJcing."
A number of people heard the woman's
words and saw her sobbing.
Martin barely looked at his wife and in
a low, husky voice grunted something un
intelligible and passed up the stairs into
the nail.
Mrs. Martin followed him closely, ap
pealing to him to stop and lister: to her
as they proceeded along the corridor.
He finally stopped when he reached the
entrance to Chief Growley's office, and,
turmng to his wife, began abusing her in
an undertone, saying he did not propose
to have her following him around where
ever he went. Finally he called her a vile
name and, turning on his heels, he started
away.
At this moment the woman drew her
pistol and almost point blank she pointed
it at his back.
The bullet entered near thÂ« middle of
his back and took a downward course,
making its exit through his abdomen.
Martin fell to the floor and screamed
witli pain. Mrs. Martin, half crazed,
pulled the trigger once more, but the
bullet went wide of its mark.
Captain Spillane, Detectives Crockett
and Â£agan, who were close at band,
jumped forward and seized the woman.
In their endeavor to wrest the weapon
from herjit went off once more, lodging in
the wall.
The officers hurried the woman into the
detectives' room, where she became
hysterical and fainted. Recovering shortly
afterward she exclaimed between sobs:
"My lod, he drove me to it!"
Martin was carried by some of his
friends to Â»he Receiving Hospital, where,
after examining his wounds, Dr. Fitzgib
bons declared them fatal.
Deputy County Clerk Piper, a clone
friend of Martin, asked him who did the
shooting. To this Martin cave the same
answer he gave to all other inquiries made
later on.
"I don't know who did it. I was shot
from behind."
"When first taken to the prison Mrs.
Martin had a brief explanation to make,
but after she was put to bed she refused
absolutely to converse excepting with her
sister. Mrs. Ned Foster, who was sum
moned to her side.
"I did not intend killing Jack," she
said. "He just drove me to it. For the
past year he has driven me almost insane.
Night after night he has remained away
from me, breaking my heart. I have
pleaded with him repeatedly to come home
and quit drinking, but he would not listen
to me. He spurned me and called me
such vile names I could not stand it any
longer. When I drew the pistol I had no
idea of using it excepting upon myself. I
don't know how it occurred â I shot him
instead of myself."
Stole Cigars :tiul Whisky.
Some time early Sunday morning thieves
j entered the store and saloon of Henry Meyer,

SHE SINGS IN DARKNESS.
A Young Italian Prima Donna,
Who Is Touring the World
Alone.
CONCEBTIZED IN SIBERIA.
Blindness Compelled Miss Belinfante
to Give Up a Brilliant Operatic
Career.
"I am alone and blind, but people have
been so kind that I have never felt forlorn
or helpless."
The girl who said these words yesterday,
in her room at the Grand Hotel, was sur
rounded by outward and visible proofs of
the fact that people had not neglected her
on account of the total darkness which is
slowly but surely settling down upon her
beautiful dark eyes. She is a singer who
has just arrived here from the Orient, and
her room is full of the trophies which ad
miring audiences gave heron her travels.
Lacquered and silver ware, gorgeous em
broideries, and, above all, endless ribbons
and sashes, whicu the people of Japan pre
sented with floral tributes. Miss Belin
fante is not quite blind yet; she can dis
tinguish objects when they are held close
to her eyes in certain lights, but slowly,
day by day, the shadows are gathering
deeper round her, and before many
months are past the doom of total dark
ness will be upon her. Even now she does
not dare to venture out alone, though she
is making the tour of the world by herself
and is her own impresario.
The young girl's history is a singularly
pathetic one, though it shows what can be
achieved by talent ana pluck. Estrella
Belinfante, whose fatder was Spanish and
her mother Italian, was left an orphan
when a few years old. A Scotch family in
London adopted her and gave her every
possible educational advantage. Although
rather frail in physique she was found to
have a phenomenal voice, and in order
that it might have the best musical cul
ture she was taken when quite young to
Naples and placed as a student in the con
servatory.
After seven years' study Estrella Belin
fÃiite made a debut which created quite a
sensation, even in muMcal Italy. Her
voice, a magnificent mezzo soprano con
tralto, attracted the attention of Sonzog
no. who engaged ber for "Carmen" and
other operas, of which he possesses the
Italian rights. The composer, Pietro Mas
cagui, was also greatly delighted with tbe
young girl's singing. At that time he was
at work on "L'Amico Fritz," and at once
secured her to create the role of Beppo.
when the work should be produced.
Meanwhile Miss Belinfante continued to
appear in Milan and Naples with success.
One day, in the latter city, when she vai
singing the role of Zingara. in "La Forza
del Destino," she noticed that in the rat
aplan, where the burden of leading all the
choristers falls on the mezzo soprano's
shoulders, the conductor's baton suddenly
grew blurred and faded. S!ie went on
with her rol â¢, however, and before the rat
aplan was ended, by straining her eyes,
she could see the baton a2ain. A few days
after, the experience of ioss of vision was
repeated, and then Miss Belintante con
suited an oculist.
The oculist's verdict was too grave
to be realized or believed, at first.
The nerve which connect the eves with
the brain was said to be affected* on the
Estrella Bclinfantc, the Blind Singer Who Is Touring the World Alone.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
left side, and all the medical skill in the
world, said the physician, could do noth
ing to save the sight of that eye. "You
must leave the stage entirely, unless you
wish to lose the sight of your right eye
also," said the oculist.
Sonzogno, who refused to lose such a
vocal treasure as Miss Belinfante, made
light of the verdict, and persuaded the
singer to consult another eminent oculist.
His diagnosis was if anything more dras
tic, and when the great impresario, Son
zogno, realized that the conductor's baton
would soon be invisible to the girl he
called the "coming contralto," he ex
claimed: "Give up singing entirely; a
woman with your voice must be a great
celebrity or nothing." Mascagni also ex
pressed bitterness that "L'Amico Fritz"
was to lose its Beppo.
But the greatest bitterness was felt by
the singer herself. She was yonng and
impetuous, and in her agony of mind at
having to lose the fame that seemed al
most within her grasp, she tried to com
mit suicide by throwing lierself from the
top story of a house in Naples. She was
taken up alive, but with shattered bones,
and for months lay between life and death.
At last she recovered, and though she had
lost the sij:ht of her left eye, she found
that the long rest and nursing had Droved
so beneficial that the doom of the right
eye which the oculists had pronounced
seemed to have been averted, for she
could see well enough to follow the con
ductor's baton.
Estrella Belinfante went back to the
stage and sans: with renewed success in
some of the leading cities of Italy. But
the doom was only averted, not gone.
Last February, just as she was to have
sung at San Carlo, Naples, darkness benan
to settle upon her right eye. This time
she was older and braver. Determined to
bear her fats without a murmnr she
listened to the advice of her oculists, who
said that a sea voyace waa the best means
of husbanding her sight as long as possi
ble. Japan was attracting considerable in
terest and attention at that time, and with
a lady to act us companion and chaperone,
Miss Belinfante set out toward the Orient,
via the Suez canal. ;â¢ '; , . :
>On board * the - singer ; who was slowly
going blind was made much of by the pas
sengers, and when she arrived z. in j China
her friends insisted on ; her giving a con
cert. An accompanist A was ':., hunted up,
some local talent was engaged, and Miss
Belinfante's singing proved such a succes
that she was emboldened;, to give several
more concerts jin Yokohama and; Shaugs
hai. .At this point the chaperone became
smitten with . malaria and ; homesickness
and had to return to Italy, but Miss Belin
tante. was resolved | to continue her tour.
She visited Siberia, and even went a -little
way along the new trans-Asiatic line to
give a concert, meeting with suc
cess. ... â  .... :
"It was after those concerts that I felt I
had found.a vocation again," she said yes
terday. "I shall lose my sight entirely
very soon, but before that happens;! want
to make a place on the concert stage. As
for the kindness of the people in Siberia
and Japan I cannot rind words to describe
it. At Vladivostock 1 was treated â  like a
little queen by the officers of the fleet and
the Governor and his family. The hotels
there are simply . atrocious, but \ the ad
miral said: 'We are not allowed to have a
lady on board after dark, though by day
the fleet is yours.' . " In Japan, too, the
people were charming." . ' -. '
Miss Belinfante has a number of letters
of introduction to residents of San Fran
cisco, and she asked almost with the eagei
ness of a child what was the character of
the Californians. "Are they kind? Will
they come and take me fora walk gome
times, these people who are friends of my
friends? This is my first visit to America,
and though I cannot see the town, I' can
feel the air and : hear the bustle of the
streets. It is lonely to sit in one's room
all day, but in San Francisco I mean to
inaugurate my fresh hold on life by en
gaging an accompanist and studying all
my old operas â this time for concerts only
though, for 1 shall never tread the stage
again." .____Â«Â«__Â«_â_
DOCKERY MAKES ARRESTS
Managers of Prominent Hotels
Will Be Taken Into Cus
tody To-Day.
The Recently Enacted Milk Ordi
nance Will Go Into Effect
at Once.
Milk Inspector Dockery will swear out
warrants to-day for the arrest of J. C.
Kirkpatrick, manager of the Palace Hotel;
Major Hooper, manager of the Occidental
Hotel; General R. H. Warfield, manager

205 Sixth street; P. C. Kaufman, grocer,
Fourth and Tehama streets; and Paul
Christianson, restanrant-keeper, 111 Mar

All will be charged with violating the
new milk ordinance, which says that all
hotel, restaurant or boarding-house keep
ers, as well as dealers in milk, must obtain
permits from the Board of Health to carry
on the business.
The ordinance went into effect some
time ago, and the Board of Health de
cided to give those who came under the
measure ample time to take out their
permits.
Recently notices were sent out to all
! those who were delinquent in the matter,
warning them to call at the office of the
board and go through the nec-.ssary form,
but those mentioned, as well as many
others, have failed to comply, and their
arrest will be followed by many more.
The hotel-Keepers are said to have deter
mined to combat the ordinance, and will
make a bitter legal fight to have it declared
invalid.
Inspector Dockery arrested A. Betti,
fruit-dealer, Eleventh and Mission streets;
â¢Joseph Lander, baker, 121 Sixth street;
George D. Starr, cafe-keeper, 9 Sixth
street, and M. Johnson, restaurant-keeper,

AID FROM THE FAIRIES.
The Children's Hospital Operetta
Is in Preparation at
Alameda.
AN ORIGINAL MUSICAL WORK.
It Is a Bright and Catchy Production,
With Libretto by Miss Lies
of This City.
An original operetta written by Miss
Camilla E. Lies, a young lady of this City,
. is to be produced nt Alameda on April 17.
The object is to endow a bed in the Chil
dren's Hospital, the same to be known as
tbe "Alameda Bed."
Mrs. Charles L. Tilden of Alameda is
the promoter and manager of the affair.
Miss Stella Lies, a sister of the author of
the libretto, is drilling the choruses. Miss
Isabelle McCurrie is the director of elocu
tion and will act as stage manager. Miss
Gamble is drilling the fairy dancers. Miss
Clara Fisher will have charge of the stage
settings.
The operetta is to be presented entirely
by children under 14 years of age, but the
principal singers have already established
local reputations for proficiency.
In the story of the "Rival Queens," that
being the name of tbe operetta, it is told
that Prince Leon, becoming separated
from his companions while hunting, falls
asleep in the fairies' bower. He is found
by Nightshade, who was once an attend
ant of Rose, Queen of the fairies, but
being banished for bad conduct fled to the
goblins, who made her their Queen.
Nightshade determines to add the Prince
to her household, and in weaving a magic
spell over him, that her goblins may bear
him away, is suddenly interrupted by
Telfa, an elf, page to Queen Rose, whose
presence destroys the spell. The Prince
expresses to Telfa a wish to see the Fairy
Queen. He is warned of the danger, as
the Queen has not as yet been seen by
mortal eye, but is promised safety if he
will resign himself to Telfa's care. At
midnight the fairies hold their revels.
Of course, on beholding the beauteous
Queen the Prince forgets his promise and
rushes forward to declare his love.
This haste displeasing the Queen, the
Prince is ordered from the court. At this
tairy meeting Queen Rose announces that
the day has arrived when, according to
fairy rules, every queen must lose her
jower ior a month and wander on earth
in the guise of a beggar. The reward of
any one doing her a Kindness during her
wanderings will be the granting of the
dearest heart wish of that person.
The opening of the second act is at the
Palace of Nightshade. The goblins, hold
ing high revels, have captured Queen Rose
and drair her to the foot of Nightshade's
throne. Telfa's arrival interests the
goblins, distracts their attention from the
captive queen and leads to a proposal for
indulgence in goblin wine. Telfa drugs
the wine and the goblins succumb to the
potion as they sing.
In act 3 Prince Leon is discovered alone
in the fairies' bower. Nightshade arrives
and seeks to lead him away. Refusing he
is bound by her summoned goblin* and
released again by Telfa. This enables the
Prince to prevent ill treatment; of a poor
gypsy by some of his noble lords. He is
thanked by the gypsy and promised his
dearest wish and told to be there aiiain at
midnight. At that time and place the
poor costume of the gypsy is suddenly
removed. Queen Rose is beheld and the
hand of the Prince is accepted. Thus ends
the story.

Queens" is as follows:

MILK COMBINE
ON THE TAPIS.
Dairymen Pool Interests
Hoping to Increase
the Profits.
CONSUMERNOT AFFECTED
Biggest Expense Now Encoun
tered Is Found in Deliv
ering the Milk.
TO INCORPORATE THIS WEEK.
The Company Will Have Its Own
Blacksmith and Work Shops,
Effecting Large Saving.
Before the end of the present week the
big dairies of San Francisco and adjoining
counties will pool their interests in a cor
}X>ration to be known as the Milkmen's
Union.
The object of the new association is not
to increase the price of milk to the con
sumer, but to augment their own profits
by decreasing the expenses incident to the
business. It is claimed by those at the
head of the movement that through con
solidation of the various dairies the cost
of delivering iniik, which is the biggest
item milkmen are called upon to shoul
der, will be decreased from 25 to 50 per
cent.
The plan as proposed means nothing
less than a gigantic trust, without the ob
jectionable features attached to such a
concern. In fact, under the system as
devised by H. A. Clifford, such a thing as
increasing the price beyond the figures
named by the dairymen at the time of
joining the corporation is out of the ques
tion.
'The articles of incorporation are now
being drawn up."' said Mr. Clifford yester
day, "and in a very few days the company
will be formally 1 lunched on the milk
world. The main object to be attained is
the reduction of expenses and the doing
away with any cut-throat business. Every
nun joinioc the union will go in on his
own merits. That is to say, his interest in
the corporation will be governed by the
paying ability of his business. His stock,
route, wagons and harness will be taken
by the company at their market value,
stock in the corporation being given in
payment. This proposition cau be better
illustrated as follows:
40 cans, wholesale trade, at 50 cents per can
per month ? 800
17 cans one-quart traOe at $2 50 eaoh per
month 595
1 horse valued at 70
1 wagon vaiut-d at 100
â arness valued at 15
Total $1580
"This $1580," continued Mr. Clifford,
'â¢would represent the amount of stock re
ceived by the milkman. Now, in order to
be sure that the value of the trade wnich I
will say has been turned in by the would
tx' stockholder at 50 cents per can is really
not less than that, the company accepts
the business with a sixty-day saving
clause. If at the end of that time the
trade holds up to SOcents per can the stock
is issued. Should it fall below that sum
the dairyman is offered exactly what his
route pays, with the privilege of refusing
if he so desires.
"Contracts will De made with each man
owning cows, and turning his route into
the company, each contract being made i
for a number of years with permission to i
the dairyman to sublet his contract if he i
so desires.
"Every dairy will of course be under the
control of the company, the latter fixing a
time for milking and imposing such other
conditions as the business might warrant.
There is to be an inspector, whose only oc
cupation will be to visit twice each month
every dairy belonging to the corporation,
paving particular attention to the quality
ol the food and water given the stock, and
to see if each ranch is in a perfectly sani
tary condition. Milk received from a
dairy not up to the standard, or which
sours before a reasonable time, will be
charged to the dairy delivering it.
"Dairymen not owning routes in the
City will be approached with a view of se
curing, if possible, the control of the entire
milk supply, thus establishing a uniform
price, with a reasonable certainty of ulti
mately decreasing the cost to the con
sumer. Under this plan two men with
one horse and wagon will be able to put
out 1/K) cans of milk between the hours of
3 and 7a. m. The City will be figuratively
cut up in sections, doing away with fifty
or sixty wagons delivering milk on the
same street, and in many instances in the
Â«ame building. In other words three
wagons will be able to do the work of ten.
"With only a few hours' work each day a
horse will Jast for years, his shoeing cost
ing less than 50 cents, instead of $2 as now.
The company will have its own blacksmith
and general work shops, where all th's can
be done, as well aa wagons painted and
cans manufactured.
"It can be readily seen what a handsome'
dividend all this will yield to the stock
holders, .in addition to the regular profit
on the milk. It is also our purpose to
handle the butter of all dairies wishing to
send to this market. This butter will be
sold on the niilk routes, thus bringing a
new and paying industry into the business.
"The largest dairies in San Francisco
have joined the corporation, and I venture
the assertion that in less than thirty days
every milkman of importance will beseek
iug admission. The milkmen need just
sqct an institution as this to do away with
the present expensive manner of con
ducting the business." â 
DR. YORK'S LECTURE.
Declares Our System of Kducation In
ooinpetent to Cure throwing Kvilg.
l>r. J. L. York was tendered a benefit by j
the San Francisco Liberal Union and
friends of liberalism at Scottish Hall last
evening. The doctor lectured on "Educa- j
tion, Marriage and the Family." He said:
In a certain sense everything that we hear,
see and feel helps to educate us. In a broad
sense education means the drawing out by cul
ture and discipline that which is germinal in
human nature. We lin<l that man is dual in
his nature, and In the constitution of his facul
ties he is a physical, mental and moral being.
And any system of education, to be a tr 10 sys
tem, must educate thewiiolo man and bring
out this trinity of human powers into harmo
nious action, and thus develop well-balanced
character. And the great object of education
should be to produce true, sell-sustaining man
hood and womanhood. Or, in other words
salvation for body, mind and moral being '
The physical and moral culture of the young
is the inundation upon which depends the suc
cess of human life.- We believe that ail crime
is a disease and; needs social remedies. Jails,
prisons and the hangman's rope do not stay
the tide of ; vice, misery . and crime which
seems to keep pace with our civilization.
<â  To expect good mental and moral results
from a rickety body and a badly formed skull
f would be to reap withoutsowing and to gather
where. we had not strewn. And the idea of
driving poor feeble children into a schoolroom
to pet them out of the way of the overtaxed
mother is simply absurd and cruel. Some peo
ple act as though the sehnolhouse were a tank
where knowledge is stored < up, and that the
children, like so: many empty jugs, are sent
there to be tilled; and the teacher, supposed to
be the boss of the tank, is expected, with little
or L ' no help from "the ,Â» parents nt home,
To put the same quantity in each jug regard
less of constitution and capacity. And as a
result of such pushing methods of education
we have intellectual dyspeptics and educated
fools without common sense enough to care
tor their own bodies nnd utterly unfit to fight
the batile of life.
We were pained this week by the appeal of
Â»the 400 typesetters of this City, men, women,
hoys and girls out of employment, many of
them in consequence of typesetting machines
that have come to take the bread from the
mouths of the hungry poor. So it is. Art and
invention lends its cruel hand in creating idle
ness, poverty and misery among the people.
And with our present system of financial ruin
and depression of labor our Bchooi facilities
only augment their misery by rendering them
more susceptible to the unfavorable conditions
which surround them. What we need is better
industrial conditions and technical schools for
our young people. The school training which
does not tit both mind and body for useful citi
zenship falls short of a true education.
It Was Collusion.
Judge Sanderson has sustained the demur
rer of Sofre Alexander to the suit of his ex
wife, Sophie Alexander, to set aside a decree of
divorce. Since the divorce was granted the
lady has found that Alexander has more
money than she thought, so she wanted a
chance for alimony. But Judge Sanderson
found that the divorce had been granted to
Alexander by the collusion of his wife, and so
he held that she could not profit by her own
wrong and have It set aside. He therefore sus
tained a demurrer to her complaint without
leave to answer.
Miss Culbertson's Return.

THE ART ASSOCIATION
Annual Election for Directors and
: President Takes Place To-
Bay.
Joseph D. Grant Placed on the Regu
lar Ticketâ No Opposition in
Sight.
The annual election for directors of the
San Francisco Art Association will take
place to-day at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art. The polls will open at 1
o'clock p. m. and close at 6 p.m. The an
nual meeting and election of president
will be held in the evening, the board con
\ veiling at 8 o'clock. So far there is only
the regular ticket in the field.
In order to attract as mauy members of
the association as can attend the new
; paintines recently received have been
! placed on exhibition.
The annual report, ready for submission
j to the directors, shows a loss in member
ship during the past year of thirty. "In
cash on hand the institute holds its own.
About twelve years ago, when Colonel
A. G. Hawes was elected president of the
association, the institute was in debt and
the (membership slight. He took hold of
affairs with a good deal of vigor and
j recruited the membership. When he
handed' the scepter to Joseph D. Redding
there was a good membership and no debt.
Under Mr. Redding's administration the
association prospered. He held the new
members secured by Hawes and added to
the cash reserve. There was a lucky fire
during Redding's career and $2000 insur
ance money was collected. The enter-
I tainments during his terms brought in
; nearly $3000.
Under the presidency, of the late L. L.
i Baker there was not an active canvass
made for new recruits and the member
ship declined.
Fred Zeile was inaugurated president.
He devoted great personal effort to increas-
I ing the membership, and success crowned
! his work. . %
James D. Phelan during his . two terms
i of office as president has not increased the
! number of members, but his career has
! been distinguished by liberality to the in
! stitution and generous help to deserving
! artists.
Since the regular ticket for to-day's elec
! tion was printed and sent out to members
i Joseph a. Crockett declined to serve and
i Joseph D. Grant has .been placed on the
| ticket to fill the vacancy. ,
CHARGED WITH MURDER
Michael Costello, Grocer, Arrested on
the Complaint of Hit Father
in-Law.
Michael Costello, grocer on the corner of
Brannan and Gilbert streets, was charged
at the City Prison yesterday with murder.
On March 9, last year, Costello's wife
died suddenly. An inquest was held and
a verdict rendered of death from natural
causes. The inquest was held at the re
quest of John Lynch, Costello's father-in
law, who expressed his suspicions that his
daughter had been poisoned.
The body was interred, and now, after
the lapse of over a year, Mr. Lynch has
sworn to a complaint charging Costello
with murder, alleging that he has pro
cured evidence to sbow that the death of
his daughter was not from natural causes.
Costello said yesterday that the charge
was absurd. On the day before her death
his wife appeared m her usual health, and
that morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock,
when he left the house, she was asleep.
When he was notified that she had been
taken seriously ill he called in three physi
cians, but they were unable to save her
life. The records in the Coroner's office, |
he said, would show the real cause of his
wife's death.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1896.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Strong Gale of Yesterday
Did Very Little Damage
to Shipping.
SOME VESSELS BROKE ADRIFT.
A New Patent Screw Will Be Tried
in the Tug Reliance Next
Week.
There was quite a storm on the bay yes
' terday and a number of vessels were
\ slightly in while the ferry-boats found
lit difficult to leave their landings. The
bark Coryphene was at anchor off Lom
bard-street wharf and was exposed to the
I full force of the wind and tide. About
| noon she . began to drift, and her anchor
i only held when she was within a few feet
of the British ship Walden Abbey. The
j tug Sea King of the Merchants' and Ship
owners' line stood by her for over two
I hours, and finally towed the Coryphene to
j Mission Bay. With the turn of the tide
both vessels came together, but no damage
I was done.
"When the Umatilla was leaving for ,
Puget Sound ports the wind and tide
caught her and she was carried from
] Broadway wharf to the ferries before Cap- I
tfÂ»in Hunter could get her straightened j
' out and on her course. The San Rafael, ]
in backing out from her slip, had her stern
slewed around by the winn anu she went
broadside on across the opening. Captain
McKenzie got a breast-line out, and after
some skillful manuvering got the steamer
| head on to the breeze and then all was
\ plain sailing.
One of the State dredgers was badly
bumped at the north end and had to be
moved by the tug Governor Markham.
The yacht Hurricane was driven against
the piles when passing through the Oak- i
| land drawbridge and had about twelve
: feet of her sail carried away. At the
I south end no damage at all was done.
The delegation oi municipal officers
\ from Minneapolis now visiting San
! Francisco will be treated to a sail on
â¢ the bay to-morrow. They will be the |
: gnests of Supervisor A. B. Spreckels and i
I will leave Mission-street wharf at. 10:30 j
ia. m. All the points of interest, such as [
â  the Union Iron Works, Hunters Point j
! drydock, the rolling-mills. Presidio, Fort
! Point and others, will be visited.
The Willamette Valley, which is sched- ;
' uled to arrive from Mexican ports, will !
: nave her name changed as soon as she gets '
j in. When she sails again she will be j
called the Orizaba.
The steamer George \V. Elder, which
broke her rudder-post some months ago,
is now almost repaired and will resume
her running to Portland next Saturday.
The Willamette and Columb a, which also
broke their rudder-posts when attempting
to bring down the Elder's cargo, are now
nearly repaired and will start running
again some time next month.
The stoamer Coptic brought a very valu
ble consignment of opium from Hongkong
this last trip. The duty on it alone will
net Uncle Sam $125,000." When the Peru
sailed the customs authorities thought
there was opium aboard, and in conse
quence the cutter Hartley followed her
down the bay in order to see that no at
tempt was made to throw it overboard.
Chief Engineer Fred Helland did not go
out on the Peru, his place being taken by
John Stevenson. It was given out that
Helland was sick, but he was down to see
the vessel away nevertheless. The Peru
had no cabin passengers and only a thou
sand tons of cargo.
Peter McQuilan, a fireman on the tug
Reliance, had his foot badly crushed yes
terday. He was taking a bucket of water
and got his foot botween the tug's fender
and a pile. The Reliance is to have her
new screw put in this week. It is auger
shaped, will be made of composite gun
metal and will weigh two tons. There
will be a six-inch flange on the outer rim
to keep the water from being tnrown
against the outer edge. The new screw is
not altogether an experiment, as the
Messrs. Spreckels have tried it on their
San Diego ferry-boat, where it has proved
a splendid success. A vessel equipped
with one of these augers can go ahead or
astern on the instant, and there is elso
less slip than with the ordinary propeller.
It is expected that the Sf.eed'and towing
power of the Reliance will be considerably
increased.
Considerable work has been done on the
Reliance in order to fit her for the new
screw. A new stern-post has been put in
and in about four days she will go on the
drydock to have the wheel fitted. Then
by about Monday next she will be ready
for her trial trip. Steamship men are
loud in their praise of John D. Spreckels'
public spirit in giving the new screw a
thorough test at his own expense.
The schooner Del Norte is expected to
morrow from Coquille River with a cargo
of coal from a new mine just opened. F.
W. Kronenberg of Oakland has developed
the mine and he is about to put the prod
uct on the Oakland market. Should it
turn out as good as expected a regular line
of vessels will be put on the route.
FRED YATES COMING.
The Distinguished Artist Kxpects to Be
In San Francisco This Summer.
William Doxey has just received a letter
from the distinguished artist Frederic
Yates, in which the latter states that he
will probably make a flying visit to San
Francisco this year.
In the letter Mr. Yates refers modestly
but frankly to his success in England, and
speaks of the pleasure he anticipates in
meeting General Barnes, Dr. Stebbins,
Arthur Scrivener, Dr. Barkan and many
good Bohemians who were so helpful to
him in the beginning of his career in San
Francisco. He mentions the late Tiburcio
Farrott as. one of his stanchest friends.
During his career in San Francisco Fred
Yates did some notable wort on portrait
painting, and the Bohemian Club it par
ticularly fortunate in owning some of the
best pictures that he painted. His success
in London was not gained in a month or a
year, but he has been gaining steadily un
til he now ranks as one of the foremost
portrait painters of the day. The Sketch
of March 24 contains a full-page represen
tation of one of his latest pictures, "Ma
dame la Comtesse." The St. James Budget
of December 6 reproduces his portrait of
George Allen. Speaking of his visit to
Newark on Trent to paint Mr. Allen's pic
ture the artist says in nis letter to Doxey:
"I came down here to paint one grand old
fellow which led to nine other commis
sions and no end of work waiting to be
done in London."
Mr. Yates was in New York two years
ago and then expected to continue the
journey to California, but had to return to
London to paint the Bishop of Ports
mouth.
Brothers at Law.
Judge Coffey has refused the application of
Adolpu Soher to have his brother removed
from the position of administrator of the
estate of Lewis Soher, father of the litigants.
The men are administrators of the estate. For
years the eight children of Lewis Soher have
been fighting over his estate, and the end is
not yet. Adolph charged mismanagement of
the estate in all its phases, hut Judge Cofley
decided that no mismanagement had been
proved, and so refused to remove the distaste
ful officer.
Thrown From HU Wagon.
Henry Hart, 1604 Pacific avenue, an Dm
ploye of the quartermaster's department of
the United States army, was driving a wagon
with locked wheels down Pine street yester
day nfternoon. When between Stockton and
Dupont streets the wagon switched around
and Hart was thrown to the ground. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where it was
lound that his right collar-bone was broken.
OLD-TIMERS ARE JOYFUL
They Are Laughing at the
Trouncing Received by This
City's Police.
Other Police Sharpshooters Would
Like to Compete With the Oak
land Fcrce.
It is advisable to know Just at this par
ticular time that there are two very dis
tinct divisions in Company A of the Po
lice Department. It was division 1 that
got the walloping on Saturday in the rifle
match against the Oakland team. Its
members are sore and are chafing under
the jibes of their fellow orhcers of the
force. As a matter of fact, it might be ad
visable not to seek information or favors
from members of division 1 of Company
A just at this particular time.
On the other hand, any officer wearing a
broad grin and â  particularly charming
manner may be called upon at any mo
ment for almost any service, for ho' surely
belongs to division 2, the members of
which have been giving the members of
division 1 the grand ha! ha!
There is a bit of a story in this situation.
When the Oakland policemen began toot
ing their own horn as to their clever
marksmanship, Captain Wittman, com
manding division 1 of Company A, de
clared he had material enough to plug a
bullseye full of holts, while the Oakland
"cops" would be shooting all around the
target.
A match was made and instead of select
ing the crack shots from both divisions to
represent the police force of this City,
Witt man selected ten men of his own com
mand. They were all novices excepting
Harry Hook and Sergeant Nash, who were
members of the old unbeaten team. They
went to the butts and were given a most in
glorious beating. But the Oakland locust
wielders must not run away with the idea
that they are the crackajack marksmen of
this State, for there are seven other divi
sions yet to pick men from and each of the
seven thinks its men the best. There is
one thing certain, division 1 is no longer
in the Hold, at least until its members can
do bt-tter than average 40.90 out of a pos
sible 50.
Ii is probable that the recent match will
bring about a series of shooting matches
between tue various divisions, and uiti
â  mately the best men in all the divisions
will be picked out as a team to compete
against all comer.".
It will be as-in the pood old days when
1 P. I>. Linville, Charley Nash, Harry Hook,
i Nels and Andy Field, Bixley. George Gan,
Caiileau, E. C. Wells, J. C. Lane, BodwelJ.
tHiram A. Robinson, John Glanz, Bailey,
; Clark, Oaks Erskine and the old Veteran
| Captain Douglass, held out against the
; world both at pistol and rifle shooting.
These men were never beaten at the
range. But, in turn they defeated teams
from the Presidio, tho San Francisco and
Oakland militia, a citizens' picked team
and the celebrated Carson Guards.
It was nothing for the old-timers to
; average 43 or 44, and they were never hard
pressed either.
An amusing incident in Saturday's de
| feut is the fact that four of the Oakland
i team's best shots were in the Carson
Guards at the time the latter were so
badly trounced by the old-timers.
SAN JOAQUIN BANES.
The CominlHsionera Keport That They
Found Them All in Good
Condition.
Messrs. Magee and Fuller of the Board
of Bank Commissioners have just re
turned from an official tour through the
San Joaquin Valley. During their absence
from the City, which was over three weeks
in duration, tue Commissioners visited all
the banks in the section lying between
Bakersneld and Modesto. They found all
the banking-houses of the district covered
in good condition financially, indications
being that the "hard times," Â»o far as the
San Joaquin Valley is concerned, are a
thing of the past.

BENEATH THE PIE CRUST
The Labor Commission Is Inves
tigating the City's Bake-
Shops.
PASTRY COOKS IN FLAGRANTE
Two 'Special Deputies Inaugurate
the Practical Work of
Inspection.
A day of reckoning for the beings who
preside over the kneading-trou-h has
come. The Augean bakeshops of the City
are to be cleansed, and the Hercules who
is to undertake the job is none other than
Hon. E. L. Fitzgerald, the genial Labor
Commissioner.
Since he assumed charge of the Labor
Bureau Mr. Fitzgerald has had in view a
sweeping reform in the present manner of
conducting many of the smaller City
bakeries. In his last official report he uses
the following language:
I detailed my agents to investigate this par
ticular industry carefully, instructing them to
take cognizance of every detail of the work,
making a thorough and careful report of every
place visited. They began with the larger
bakeries, whose business is strictly wholesale;
they were found to be in a good condition.
One in particular I deem worthy of especial
notice. Upon entering the factory and pre
senting their credential!- they were taken by
the manager and shown every nook and corner
of the establishment.
The factory, from the ground floor to the top,
every floor, machine and other appurtenances
showed ii studied care and neatness. In the
packing-rooms were bevies of young ladies ut
ihe tables, chatting gayly over the events of
the day, packing in the various boxes the crisp
crackers, nicnacs or macaroons. The air whs
pure and refreshing, the tloors were white as a
man-of-war deck, and everything had an air of
wholesomeness.
The scene presented a pleasing spectacle to j
the eye i:nd one felt reluctant in leaving. In j
conversation with the manager it was learned
that for the many years he bad been in the i
manufacturing business it had always Men Â«
study with him as to what more be could do
for the convenience of his operatives, thor
oughly believing that attention and care in!
this regard insured better results from a busi
ness standpoint I understand that this es- j
tublishment is about to open a hospital annex
for its operatives. He complained that the \
product of the biscuit and cracker companies
of this State is subjected to a competition with j
goods of Oregon, which is damaging to the
business, as the goods imported were of a very I
much inferior quality, ami consequently bring
a less price, to the injury of our home institu
tions.
Tlje work of investigation covered the in
spection ot about 150 bakeries, whose opera
tives numbered variously from two to ten
each, which said places were found to be in in
diflcreut conditions. Some were good, many
fair and many in bad condition. In many
places where improvements were necessary
the respective proprietors promised faithtully
to make the needed changes, hence 1 will not
particularize or call by name any of these per
sons, who are inclined to do right and have
confessed to carelessness in the past.
However, it may be well to describe one or I
two of the places where the breadstutfs con
sumed by the thousands of San Franciscans !
are prepared. Entering by a precipitous stair- i
way from the sidewalk to the foul-smelling
cellar, over which the fat and grease for years :
were allowed -to accumulate, you proceed to
the tables where the bread is made. Tne I
operative is a sickly looking man, pale and ;
thin, whose features bear the result of the
labor from day to day in this place, which is
not lit for the "abode of the despicable rodent.
Here lie toils, breathing the odors of the de- ;
caved fruit, which was too bad to use, and the
neglected eggs, which some time before had
outlived their usefulness, all thrown into a ,
barrel near by. whose effluvia vied with the ;
few remaining atoms of oxygen for supremacy.
On the right stood an open tierce of lard half i
used, which showed the fingernails of the hand
that had used the spoon, which marks showed :
quite a contrast to the dust which had settled >
upon the rest. While there 1 watched the
dough neatly rounded and cut upon the top,
and afterward sew it come from the. oven, well
browned, and tine, Riving forth the ;
which reminded us of our mother's kitchen.
It looked decidedly out of place and inhar
monious with its filthy environments. ,
Proceeding a short distance further, kicking
here and there the molded crusts and' decayed
fruits, one felt .like -rolling up his trousers or j
wearing gum-boots- for protection. I came to :
the pastry department, where the lady finger,
macaroon : creamcake and the different
varieties of pie are manufactured. Here und
there were the, open and partly used cans of j
pie fruit, here drawers of berries of different
ages and more pale and sickly bakers, who,
when interrogated, said they were compelled
to work in this grimy place for twelve to six
teen hours per day. Passing on from this de- j
partment to examine the sauitarv condition of \
the plumbing we find a broken door partially
-hiding a closet of ancient design, which had
refused some time since to perform the work
for which it* was intended. This feature did f
not materially improve the already existing j
model filth, and in disgust and a nauseated
I feeling I left the hovel. â  ..
A visit to another place disclosed the follow
ing: Entering a cellar that from a sanitary
point of view quite excelled the former, the I
rotten boards in places bearing down under
the weight of the tody, permitted the -filthy
water to exude, which resembled in color the
contents of a sewer. Passing, on from one.
operative to another, the same pallid expres
sion was noted, until one , was encountered j
whose physique denoted the ravages â¢ of
scrofula, a sickening sight, busily engaged in j
compounding the ingredients of sponge cake
or some other like substance. I was astounded, i
not at finding * this individual, as nothing
would have surprised me in this place of rot
tenness, but I was astounded at the manner in
which thousands of the residents of Sari Fran
cisco kept their blood pure after the consump
tion of this life-destroying, germ-carrying
produce.
. This investigation has developed a singular
and surprising fact. The above recited con
ditions of filth are not only found in the
cheaper and remote bakeries, as inspection re
veals' that some of those centrally located, most i
elaborately decorated and patronized by the
most exclusive class, while not the worst are
far from being the best, and it is to the interest
of the patrons of these high-priced and so-called
first-class establishments to give this matter
the consideration that their condition justifies
and co-operate with me in remedying this un
fortunate state of affairs.
Now for the remedy. After a" careful con
sideration of the. matter 1 am satisfied. that
while the . enactment of a law requiring a
perfect condition of sanitation with a penal
clause tor its violation might prompt pro
prietors to its observance, there still remains
the difficulty of its proper. execution by sala
ried officers, who are apt to slight the same, as
other laws are now allowed to slumber j un
heeded, so in' order to effectually remedy this
matter 1 have had printed a certificate, which
reads as follows:

v In the issuance of this certificate, I shall take

quires that the operatives shall have one day's

more effect than though it was never written;

man bakers work the s full seven. It ;is in this ;

law governing the condition of labor. = â .-â - :>> '.
The want of sufficient funds will prevent
my carrying this investigation %to the interior
cities and ; towns, but I sincerely hope that the I
effect of this report will cause a like effect in I
the " different | localities iof â¢ the State; and that I
until such time as the State Legislature sees lit
to arm with the proper means with which to
prosecute this work the residents of the various
cities will constitute 1 themselves examining s
boards for the inspection of such places. â¢â  â  ; :
Mr. 4 Fitzgerald, however, is not conduct
: ing ; the V cleansing operation's f. in person.
; Yesterday afternoon O. Grassmann and G." (â¢
Postier of the Bakers' Union were sworn
in as deputy commissioners for the work.
Last night they commenced a searching
personal investigation into the condition?
of the bakeshops. No resistance was of
avail, since the new deputies, besides being
men of muscle, were further re-enforced by
a written authorization from Mr. Fitz
gerald, in which all persons guilty of in
terfering witti them in the discharge ot
their official duties were threatened with
prosecution to the full extent of the law.Â§|
G. Postier and 0. Grassman last night,
began an investigation of the condition of
the bakeries. They will visit all the baker
ies of the City, and report to the State
Labor Commissioners as to the number of
men employed in each, the number of
working hours and also as to sanitary con
ditions. The object is to secure informa
tion, with a view of having the laws
changed for the benefit of the journeyman
and the protection of the consumer.
TANDEM ACCIDENT.
Serious Injury to S. F. Thorn of the
Grand Hotel and E. H. Breiden
bacli of St. Louis.
As S. F. Thorn of the Grand Hotel and
E. H. Breidenbach of St. Louis were rid
ing on a tandem bicycle near Stow Lake
in the park yesterday they were the vic
tims of a jminful accident.
They were going quite rapidly down the
precipitous grade when suddenly they be
came aware of an obstruction in the road.
It was too late to stop, do as they would.
The obstruction consisted of a couple of
heavy planks that had been "put on each
sidft of a hose to protect it from the wheels
of heavy vehicles.
It meant destruction to run into it, but
there was no way to avoid it. Mr. Breiden
bach was ahead on the tandem. When
the front wheel struck it was literally
smashed to pieces. Mr. Briedenbach was
thrown several ieet in tne air and came
down violently, injrnng one knee and
badly bruising himself over different parts
of the body.
Mr. Thorn was thrown completely over
Mr. Briedenbach and sustained very pain
ful injuries. He came down on his left
shoulder and was so crippled that he could
scarcely get about. The body of the bicycle
was completely bent and broken.
The injured gentlemen managed to get
back to tne City, and Mr. Thorn at once
called a physician and went to bed. He
is unable to teli yet whether he is injured
internally. Mr. Breidenbach is a business
man of St. Louis, a guest of the Grand.
THAT BOGUS FOOTRACE.
Frederick Broshard, Another i
Party to the Scheme,
Arrested.
Flynn and Ryan Identified by a Man ;
From Cleveland, Ohio, Who Was
â¢ Tricked by Them. ;
James W. Flynn and James Ryan, the j
sprinters, appeared in Judge Low's court!
yesterday morning to answer the charge
of giand larceny, and their preliminary ,
examination was fixed for April 2.
Flvnn and Ryan are the men accused of
: swindling A. H. Steil of $1000 last Thurs
day in Golden Gate Park by the old con
fidence game of a "fake" footrace.
Detectives Bee and Harper have been \
. working on the case and yesterday morn- i
ing succeeded in locating the old man
who was with Fiynn and â  Ryan in ,
the park last Thursday. They found him
with his | wife in their room on Sutler
street. j He denied being the person wanted,
but the detectives sent for Stei! and he at
once identitied him. He was taken to the
City Prison,' where, he cave his name as
Frederick Broshard. â¢He was charged with
grand larceny. -
Between two and three years ago. when
the proposition was made to bring some
Eastern men here to revive baseball,
Broshard brought a team with him. They
played here and then went to Los Angeles,
afterward returning here. They played
for a time and disbanded, the venture
having proved a failure. Since then Bros
hard has been living in this City. He told
the detectives he was Flynn's backer and
was related to him by marriage. . â 
â¢ John Fafter of Cleveland, Ohio, who is
in the City on a visit, called at the City 1
Prison yesterday and had a look at FJynn j
and Ryan. He recognized them at once j
and said , they had : played the same con
fidence game on him about a year ago in j
Cleveland and swindled him out of $1000.
The detectives are still hunting for Kerr, '

MAY LOSE THEIR HEADS
A Warm Reception Awaiting
the Captain and Officers
of the Rio.
AN INVESTIGATION ORDERED.
The Master Blamed for Not Heaving
To and for Burning Up
the Staterooms.
There is trouble brewing for the officers
| of the steamer City of Rio de Janeiro of
j the Pacific Mail line, and the chances are
that Captain Kussell and his subordinates
will get a warm reception on iheir arrival.
In fact, it is openly stated on the Mail
dock that all the heads of departments
will be told that their services are no
j longer required and a new set of men will
I take the vessel out.
The whole trouble is over the long run
of the Rio from this port to Yokohama
| ami the burning of the deck staterooms
j and spars in order to pet steam on the
! boilers. When within 1300 miles of Yoko
! hama the vessel was put about ana made
for Honolulu. In his official log Chief
Officer J. T. Robinson says:
We were just 1300 miles from Yokohama
when the captain decided to return. We hod
experienced bad weather lor a number of days,
and the force of the wind registered six, seven,
eight and as high as nine. When you consider
that a hurricane is reckoned as ten, you will
understand the kind of weather we had.
Sixteen days out from San Francisco, the day
we were actually due in Yokohama, we con
sumed tifty-six tons of coal and made Mxty.
two miles. At this rate every particle of our
fuel would have been exhausted had we con
tinued, and we would have been miles a\vÂ«y
from the port with winds and currents against
us, while in going toward Honolulu we would
have had both in our favor. It was after
mature deliberation and after a thorough
canvass of the situation that the steamer was
turned abont.
The result was satisfactory to every one, us
we had wind and currents with us and made
200 miles on the consumption of fourteen tons
of coal. If thy current had not been with us
we could not have done this.
What the officials of the Mail Company
are anxious to have explained is why Cap
taih Russell kept "bucking into" a head
sea and a heavy gale instead of heaving
his ship to and waiting for the storm to
subside. Tlien, again, they cannot under
stand why the deckhouses and spars were
burnt up when there were twenty tons of
coal left in the bunkers when the vessel
reached Honolulu. The wood burned up
could not at the outside have kept steam
on the boifers for more than two hours,
and as it cost more than $i:000 to replace
them, the managers of the concern are
mad clean through.
Those who will be called upon for an ex-
I planation will be Captain W. J. Russell,
i Chief Officer J. T. Robinson, Chief En
, cineer J. H. Matthews, and Second Officer
:J. C. Johnson. It will have to bea thor
j oughly satisfactory explanation, or all four
I will lose their official heads.
In talking over the matter yesterday a
â  well-known steamship captain said: "I
know of mv own Knowledge that all the
1 Mail Company's steamers carry extra coal
durine the winter months, and that the
\ Rio de Janeiro had the usual winter sup
| ply aboard that she has been carrying for
months. The fact that he held on instead
i of heaving to will not tell so much against
Captain Russell and his men as the burn
ing of the staterooms for fuel. The wood
would not hold the steam, ana in any
â  event it should not have been used until
the last pinch. With twenty tons of coal
in the bunkers there was no necessity at
' all for tearing down the mast and deck-
I houses. Of course there may be circuin
i stances in the case that we have not heard
| of, and Captain Russell may have b:en
I perfectly justified in his course.
The Rio de Janeiro is now out six days
I from YoKohama. and may be expected
i here about April 8 next.
Up in Washington they tell a certain
; story when they want to illustrate what
] they think of a mean or stingy man. Old
i man Bills was a rancher who had a lot of
i sheep that were tended by his son Jim.
One night the sheep camp was attacked by
I three wolves. Jim killed two of them with
! his double- barreled shotgun, and then
j clubbing the piece, knocked out the brains
!of the third wolf. In doing so he broke
â  the gun stock, but saved his own life and
the sheep. His father refused to listen to
! argument, but after deducting from the
i boy's wa^es the cost of repairing the gun
stocK, discharged him, with the remark
that he couldn't afford to encourage ex
travagance, no matter what were the cir
cumstances.

j â Exclusive Cloak and Suit House*COLONEL McDONALD
WAS OUTWITTED.
How His Officers Ousted
an Armorer in Spite
of Him.
RETALIATORY THREATS.
Result of the Fight for the
Command of the First
Regiment.
THAT INNOCENT RESOLUTION.
Officers of the Old First and Third
Put Their Man in the Cov
eted Position.
The knowing ones in the National Guard
who predicted friction and possibly schism
in the organization as a result of the re
cent election for colonel of |the con
solidated Frst Regiment are seeing the
matter in a fair way to turn out as they
thought it would, and Colonel McDonald
is even now wondering just how he failed
to see certain moves of the men who op
pose his wishes and frequently checkmate
them.
As a matter of fact the colonel was out
witted regarding the patronage of the reg
iment and is not feeling very comfortable
over the matter.
The struggle for the command of San
Francisco's new and only regiment was
a long and bitter light, and the trading and
political manipulating that were resorted
to by the workers of both candidates
rankled in the breasts of both factions and
particularly in those of the losers, who
openly predicted that Colonel McDonald
would' not have things so much his own
way as he hoped. ,
One of Colonel McDonald's first official
acts was to orderthe companies of the (iuard
stationed in the armories at Market and
Tenth streets and on Golden Gate avenue
out of their quarters and distribute them
bet.veenthe Ellis street and Page and
. Gougta street armories. In doing this he
unwittingly played into the hands of his
opponentsâ the officers of the pld Frst and
Third regiments.
The same strength that insured his elec
tion as colonel in the face of determined
opposition would have enabled him to ar
range the patronage to suit himself had he
kept that strength together, but this he
failed to do. Naturally, having been long
associated with the old Second Regiment",
he knew and favored the veteran armorer
of that. organization and desired him to
retain the position and also his assistant
at theGougli-street armory, which became
the headquarters of the consolidated First.
This he was enabled to do while the
board of officers from both armories voted
together. Recently the old officers of the
First and Third, who are in command of
the companies at the Gough-street armory,
put up a little job on Colonel McDonald
that worked like a cnarm and has placed
them in virtual control of the establish
ment. At the last meeting of the board of
officers an innocent-appearing little reso
lution to the effect that the separate sets of
officers of the two armories should have
control of the establishments in which
they are stationed was offered and ac
cepted without a murmer by all present.
Its significance did not appear until the
next meeting of the officers of the Gough
street armory.
Out there are eight companies, only
two of which came from the old Second:
and the officers of the consolidated-out
First and Third have a decided majority.
Shortly after the meeting of the Regi
mental Board the Gough-street miiitia
men held a meeting, and a resolution was
quietly introduced declajing the positions
of Armorer Woodall and Assistant Fords
ham vacant.
The officers who had been in the Second
opposed the resolution on the ground that
the armorer had b"en in his place for
years, was a tried man and acceptable to
t:;e commanding officer. They talked
strongiy of retaliatory measures if Wood
al! were removed, but they stormed and ex
postulated in vain. The majority pointed
calmly to the resolution passed by the
board of officers giving the Gough-street
people absolute control of t heir own arm
ory, and passed the resolution in spite of
i.'ie opposition.
When the officers of the old First and
Third proceeded to elect Armorer .Shel
don, who had presided over their.estab
lishment at Tenth and Market streets,
with Assistant Sullivan to aid him, the
race of the defeated ones broke out anew.
TTiey attempted to fctsre off the action
by a postponement, but did not succeed,
:tnd hheedon i? now in possession. Colonel
McDonald is not expected to take the
matter easily and the officers who effected
the change are waiting anxiously for hi*
next move, which will probably be made
at the next meeting of the board of
officers.
They say, however, that they had a per
fect light to take the action they did, as
They are responsible for the bills and

CITY GUARD CLUB.
Â°* 'Auxiliary ; . Institution of Com
"j^iy B, First Infantry Regiment,
;p;.; N. G. C.V Elects Officers.
' Yesterday was the forty-second anni
versary of the City Guard, now Company
B, First Infantry, Regiment, N. G. C. Last
evening the City Guard Club was perma
nently organized by the election of the
following officers:
President, Colonel George R. Burdick; vice
president, K. C. Liindquoist; treasurer, Charles
' I). 'Sieiger; secretary, W. J. Hayes; trustees-
Colonel George \v. <;rnnr;i<: Colonel W. C. I.it
: tie, Captain George Filmer, McD. O'Brien, Jo
seph Fetz, Charles Bone and P. J. Kennedy.
The roil was signed last night by 125
men and among the signers were: Colonel
Grannies, W. V. Burke, Colonel Little and
others who served with honor when the
service of loyal men was needed mo3t in
Calilornfa. . . ,; :
Company B, a3 a military organization
of the First Regiment, is stationed at the
armory on Page street, but the City Guard
Club, which owns much of the valuable
â property, trophies, ornaments and treas
ures acquired during the past forty years,
has leased apartments in the old armory
of the First on Market street, near Tenth.
The purpose of the club is to .strengthen
and preserve the ties which : . bind.. together
the comrades of the military organization
â whose history is a part of San Francisco's
renown.

= . A pretty military ceremony will take
â¢> place this evening at the armory of the
, consolidated .Regiment on Page and
Goush !' streets, c when a new stand of colors
c will be presented to thÂ« organization.
It has been the custom in militia organ
ization* from time immemorial for the
commanding officer, when retiring or
when the regiment disbands, to take the
flags as his own property. This custom
was followed when the First and Third
Infantry regiments and the Second Artil
lery Regiment of this City were consoli
dated into the First Infantry, and the new
organization was without Hags.
Colonel McDonald of the old Second be
came the commander of the new regiment
and had the Hags of the consolidated-out
Second, but they were artillery flags and
therefore not lit for an infantry regiment,
so that new ones became necessary. Colo
nel McDonald and his staff concluded that
the regiment should have as tine a stand
of coiors as money could buy, and for seve
ral weeks past skillful fiagmakers have
been at work on them.
Governor liudd was asked, as the com
mander-in-chief of the militia of the State,
to make the presentation speech, and has
signified his intention of being present
with his staff to do the honors.
The occasion will be unique, from the
fact that the parade that will take place
after the ceremony will be the first parade
of a twelve-company regiment to take place
in this City.
The captains of the various companies
have notified their men that a full at
tendance will be expected, and the occasion
is expected to draw almost the entire
strength of the regiment. The evolutions,
on account of the number of men and the
size of the assembly room, will be rather
limited, and the affair will probably par
take njore of the nature of an inspection
than a parade, though the Governor may
review the regiment on the street.
MR, MURPHY MUST SUE.
His Only Way to Get a Com
mission From Mrs. Ellen
Colton.
A Verdict for the Defendant in the
First National Bank's
Action.
Judge Hunt has decided that S. G. Mur
phy, president of the First National Bank,
must sue Mrs. Ellen Colton for his com
mission for selling her house or go with
out hi
This decision ends the Colton-Murphy
fight for the time being, but it is not un
likely that it will start up again in a suit
j brought by Murphy himself in his own
private capacity. The suit just decided
by Judge Hunt was brought by the First
National Bank to recover from Mrs. Col
| ton the amount of an overdraft for $5250.
j She claimed the overdraft was the result
of the action of Mr. Murphy, president of
the bank. She said he deducted the
amount from her account as a commission
for the "sale of her house on California
j street to C. P. Huntington after he had
promised her it would not cost her any
thing. The checks in payment were de
po-ited in the First National Bank and
from them the $8250 was deducted.
Murphy claimed that the checks were
made out to him personally, but the
checks themselves showed that they had
been made out in favor of the bank. Upon
rhis showing Judge Hunt instructed the
j jury to find for the defendant.
In instructing the jury Judge Hunt said
! that the question whether or not Mr. Mar
j phy was entitled to a commission could
i only be determined by a suit brought by
: Murphy to recover the commission he
I sought. As to his acton in deducting
| from the deposits the amount claimed, the
! Judge said it was clearly wrong, and he
i ordered the jury to find "for the defendant,
Mrs. Colton.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1896.
Mayor Pratt of Minneapolis Sitting With Mayor Sutro at the Meeting of the Board of Supervisors.
[Sketched by a H CaU " artist.]
TWO MAYORS PRESIDED
The Chief Executive of Minne
apolis Sits With the
Supervisors.
ARCHITECTS ARE IN SUSPENSE.
A Tie Vote Prevents Action Regard
ing the Hog Ranchesâ Bids for
Public Lights.
Mayor Pratt of Minneapolis occupied a
seat beside Mayor Sutro during the meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors yesterday,
while the other members of the Minneapo
lis city government who are visiting this
City were given places of honor about the
assembly chamber.
Mayor Sutro introduced his guest to the
board in a few well-chosen words, and
then the regular business of the meeting
went on. At the close of the session
Mayor Pratt thanked the board for tbe
courtesy shown himself and hi- associates
and spoke of the benefit that they hoped 10
derive from watching the workings of the
San Francisco government. He was en
thusiastic of the beauties of San Francisco
and remarked that it was a revelation to
those who were unfamiliar with the City
by The (Jolden Gate.
He mentioned that the party had been
invited by Supervisor Spreckeis to make
an excursion about the bay, and stated
that his friends, as well as himself, would
be ver\' glad to take advantage of the offer.
Supervisor Taylor extended the glad
hand to the visitors, and moved that they
be tendered the freedom of tne City and
an invitation to drive through the park
pnd to the principal points of interest.
Three weeks of suspense is before the
architects who hope to receive the con
tract for supervising the construction of
the new municipal building. When the
matter was taken up yesterday the dead
lock which has existed ever since the bal
loting began still existed, and though the
roll was called three times Shea A Shea
lacked one vote to get the prize. There
suit each time was Shea A" Shea <!, Banks
. r >, Mooser & Mooser 1.
A motion from Supervisor Spreckels
that the matter go over three weeks was
carried unanimously. Later Supervisor
King made a motion that the subject be
left to the decision of a special committee
consisting of Supervisors Hobls, Spreck
els, Dimond, Morganstern, Hirsch, Taylor
and Benjamin. As this would give the
Shea forces a majority of one in the com
mittee the measure was not acceptable to
the friends of the other architects, and it
was opposed until Mayor Sutro voted it
out of order, the whole matter having been
postponed three weeks.
The action of the board in relation to
the hog ranches leaves the matter in the
hands of the Board of Health, and unless
that body decides to condemn and remove
them under present existing laws they
will remain as long as it pleases their own
ers. The matter came up when the report
of the Health and Police Committee estab
lishing new hog limits, but deferring put
ine them into effect for six months, was
read.
Supervisor Dimond "objected to the re
port, on the ground that it had been agreed
at the last meeting of the board to allow
the ranchers but three months to move.
He made an amendment that the time for
putting the new limits into force should
be made ninety days from the date of the
pas?aire of the measure. The vote on the
amendment resulted in a tie, King, Scully,
Benjamin, Dunker, Morganstern and Wag
ner voting against ii.
The same nix voted in favor of the origi
nal report, the tie vote rejecting it and
leaving the matter in the same condition
it was before the board took it up.
The ordinance declaring Van Ness ave
nue a boulevard over which no heavy
traffic will be allowed, and on which no
street railway franchise may ever be
granted, was finally passed.
Supervisor Hirsch introduced a resolu
tion, that was carried, directing the clerk
of the board to advertise for bids for
lighting the public buildings for two years,
beginning on May I. 1896, according to
specifications prepaied by the Committee
on Street Lights.
The Judiciary Committee was instructed
to investigate the following communica
tion :
To the. Honorable Board of Supervisorsâ Ge.v
tlk.mkn- : I have reported a dangerous sidewalk
on Bernice and Thirteenth streets tlmt was
complained of over a year ago. a depot; un
der Mr. Ashworth told me that the owner hurt
received six months' extension t<> do the work
of repairing, so 1 went with another property
owner (Mr. Ryan) to the Superintendent of
Streets' office to-day, and he called a Mr. Ho
gHii, who said that the owner had received an
extension of three months more, j asked him
to allow me to see the order but be refused to
let me see anything he had on rile. Being a
public document, J thought I should be per
mitted to see it, and do not now understand
Why my request whs denied. Kindly investi
gate the matter.

WOMEN PETITION BARNES
Their Federation Calls His At
tention to the Lane
Case.
Mrs. Rose A. French, Chairman of a
Special Committee to Look After
the Prosecution.
The Women's Federation yesterday de
cided to call District Attorney Barnes' at
tention to the pending cases growing out
of the North Beach scandals in the follow
ing language:
Whereas, The Women's State Federation for
Public Good learns with deep regret that there
are cases on the docket pending against Peter-
F. Lane and ether men who have been accused
of awful crimes against the morals of the
youth of our City, and that the trial of these
cases is liable to be deferred in order that
other cases not so important be decided, there
fore the Women's State Federation for Public
Good respectfully requests tne District Attor
ney to use his utmost diligence, power aud
well-known ability that the cause of honor
may be maintained and justice upheld.
Mrs. Bates recommended that a Home
of Refuge be established under the aus
pices of the federation. Mine. Sorbier op
posed this on the ground that there were
plenty of institutions in the City.
Dr. Janes, Mme. L. A. Sorbier," Mrs. Eva
E. Bates, Mrs. Florence Percy Matheson
and Mrs. Rose M. French were appointed
a committee to draft resolutions urging
the District Attorney to push the prosecu
tion of these cases.
There was a discussion of the work of
the federation for the coining year, which
resulted in the apportionment of the work
as follows:
Legislative departmentâ Mrs. Rose M.French,
chairman; (a) suppression of vice, (b) courts,
Mrs. h. B. Griffiths. Protective department -
Mrs. K. K. Bates, chairman; (a) protection, Mrs.
McKerritt; (b) sweating system, child labor,
etc., Mrs. Peoples. Investigation departmentâ
])r. Janes, chairman ; (a) prisons and boflpltali,
Mrs. M. J. Payne; (b) almshouse and asylum,
Educational departmentâ Mrs. K. M. North,
chairman. Press committee, Mrs. Matheson;
free baths and sanitation, Mrs. L. B. McCoy;
mothers' meetings, Mrs. Luse.
Mrs. French was appointed the chair
man of a special committee to work for
the prosecution of the North Beach cases.
She was instructed to appoint the other
member? of the committee.
Mrs. J. E. Elkington of Council 17, W. A.
P. A., was accepted as. a delegate from
that organization.
. Mrs. McKirvitt was appointed chairman
of a committee to visit undertakers' estab
lishments and request that women be em
ployed by them.
A JUDGE ON THE STAND.
Judge ColJV.v Had to Strike Out His Own
Kvidence.
Judge Coffey was a witness in his own
court yesterday in the Heydenfeldt case,
and he was under the painful necessity of
afterward striking out all his testimony.
He was called by the defense to testify as
to whether or not, during the probate of
the will of Mrs. Katherine Ilydenfeldt,
Judge Solomon Hoydenfddt had said she
was his wife. Judge Coffey could not say
positively, but he swore the custom of the
court had always been to ask that question,
and he had no doubt bu t that he had done
so on that occasion.
Then his Honor reascended the bench
and Mr. Crittenden, plaintiff's attorney,
moved to strike out his testimony, on the
ground-that it was not the best evidence.
Judge Ooffey was convinced and struck
out all he bad sworn to.
The record will now be consulted.

REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES.
â 
County Committee to Issue the
Call and Start Activity
This Week.
VOTES WILL BE COUNTED.
John D, Spreckels on a Story About
the Railroad and Local
Politics.
This week will see the completion of ar
rangements for the local Republican
primary for the election of delegates to the
State convention, and likewise the in
creased interest and activity that will fol-
Jow the call for the election.
A meeting of the County Committee
will probably be called to-day by Chair
man Manwanr.g for gome evening later in
ihe week. At that meeting the represen
tatives of the Fourth and Fifth Congres
sional districts will form separate official
bodies and issue separate calls for prima
ries. The calls will be similar, however,
and provide the same date, so that the
election will practically be as though con
ducted by the entire committee as usual.
Republican headqiurters at 850 Market
street were crowded last evening with
members of the County Committee, repre
sentatives of district organizations and
active members of the party. Each day
increases the general interest in the cam
paign just opened, and removes still fur
ther the little factional dissensions that
bobbed up as usual in the start. The
regular party organization, under
the leadership of John I). &preckel<,
now possesses such overwhelming
control of the affairs of the party and has
so clearly set forth its policy of letting the
voters, and none others, say who shall
represent them in the convention, that all
elements of the party are practically
united in support of regularity, fairness
and decency. The very small following
which Martin Kelly and Jerry Mahoney
were able to rally at theotuset has already
largely deserted these tricksters ana noth
ing has been heard from them for some
time.
"The County Committee will call the
primary this week, and everything prom
ises a quiet election, 7 ' su4 Chairman Man
waring last evening. "No one who has
not made special efforts to canvass the situ
ation can realize, after the re;:cnt talk that
has been sroing on, how solidly the people
are standing together in support of John D.
Spreckels and the policy he is carrying out.
I have been about a great deal allover the
City, and everywhere the people inter
ested in party affairs realize that the com
ing primary will be one in which their
votes will be honestly counted; that it
â¢will not be dominated by corrupt bosses,
ajid that the party is on the high road to
success in the Nation, State and City.
The party is toing to pull together, and
the campaign will be carried out without
scandals' and corrupt jobbery on the part
of those in control."
An evening paper published last nigbt a
story to the effect that the railroad was
going to support John I). Spreckels and
his friends and the rumor set the politi
cians talkinz and wondering. 80 far the
tracks of .Steve Gage have not been discov
ered in the San Francisco political field,
and while in the Second, Third and other
Congressional districts the railroad hand
and its victories have been plainly evident
the relation* of the railroad to the politics
of the Fourth and Fifth districts
have been mysteries about which people
have been able to only guess and wonder.
There has not yet been a move on the local
checkerboard mat has been ascribed
to the railroad with the exception of the
desperate and 'utile attempts of Kelly and
Mahoney to get hold of something. Many
have supposed that the raiiroad was
quietly backing these two politicians.
"What the raiiroad proposes to do in San
Francisco remains as much of a mystery
a? ever. That it should decide to have
nothing to do with Kelly and Mahonej* is
not strange, for the railroad's power could
not now put vitality into that disreput
able combination. John D. Spreckels said
last evening that the report was all news
to him.
"If the railroad is going to support the
Republican organization I don't know
it," he said, '-but i will be glad
to have all Republicans support the
ticket, whether they are railroad men
or not. I have had no conferences with
railroad people and there is no agreement
or understanding looking to their support.
If the railroad wants to come in and sup
port the Republican party without con
trolling it I suppose there will be no objec
tion. That is all I know about the story. : '
The Howard Republican Club will hold
one of iis rousing fortnightly meetings at
Pythian Castle, on Market street, near
Fifth, this evening.
AT THE CITY THEATERS
James O'Neill Reappears in
"Monte Cristo" at the .
Baldwin Theater.
Miss Lisle Leigh, Late of Boston, to Be
the Leading Lady at the
Opera-House.
James O'Neill and his company opened
their season at the Baldwin Theater last
night in "Monte Cristo." It is two years
since the actor last appeared here before
in the role with which his name is so thor
oughly identified, and he now conies back
with an almost completely different com
pany.
The fact that this is Holy Week was
largely responsible for the fact that the
audience might have been larger. The
house was a fairly good one, however, and
it was not grudging with its applause. As
the Count of Monte Cristo O'Neill made
hi? usual snocess. He was dashing, he
roic, astute and revengeful as of yore, and
carried most of the burden of the play on
his own shoulders, as be always has done.
The supporting company contains two
or tnrer good actors. "M onte Cristo" does
not contain a female role that gives an
actress much opportunity of ingratiating
herself with the audience. As Mercedes,
Miss Florence Rockwell certainly acted as
naturally as the part allowed, but she did
not succeed in conveying a very strong
impression of the unhappy Countess' per
sonality. Mile. Danglan was played by
Miss Josephine Foy, ana Miss Marie Floyd
took the part of the fishcrwoman.
Hallett Tnoninson was ver-atile Â«nd
interesting a? Nortier, and "William H.
Pascoe gave a manly, sincere Interpreta
tion to the part of Albert de Morcerf.
Albert Sackett and William H. Dixon
were good as Villefort and Cade-rouse re
spectively, and Herbert Fortier was duly
villainous as Fernande, Count de Morcerf.
The rest of the cast was satisfactory, and
the staging, particularly that of the
storm and of the conservatory scenes, was
good.
To-night an elaborate production of
"Virginius" will be given.
California Theater.
Edwin Milton Royle's play of "Friends"
was produced last ni^ht at the California
Theater for the rirst time this season. The
cast was almost the same as when the
drama was played here before, the only
important chamre beini: that the role of
Hans Otto, the opium fiend, was played
by Ben Johnson, instead of by .Lyons.
"Johnson gave a realistic and carefully
studied picture of the unhappy Hans Otto s
struggles and sufferings from the nateful
drug; in fact his interpretation was natural
enough at times to seem reality and he
won some of the warmest applause of the
evening. Lucius Henderson played the
pianoforte with his usual skill, Edwin
Milton Koyle was as drily humorous and
natural in his acting^ as before and Selina
Fetter Royle and Gretchen Lyons were
charming in their respective parts.
"Friends" will run for ihe rest of the week.
Among those present in the audience last
night were Mayor Pratt of Minneapolis ana
about thirty visitors from the same city.
Colombia Theater.
"Sinbad," with its pretty girls and brilliant
costumes, continues to fill the Columbia Thea
ter. The extravaganza company is enjoying
an exceptionally successful season, consider
ing that this is the time of Lent.
Tivoli Opeia-Honse.
"Said Pasha," In consequence of its success
last week, is to hold the boards at the Tivoli
till Easter Monday. The opera is being pro
duced without any changes in the cast.
The Grand Opera-House.
Good acting and fine scenic effects combine
to render 'The Red Pocket-book" a play of
rure interest. The large audiences at the
opera-house are obliged to keep their nerves
under control in order to avoid being fright
ened out of their wits by the succession of
storms, explosions, wrecks, fires and other dis
asters with which the piece abounds, and
which give opportunity for some magnificent
displays of stage mechanism.
According to the plot M. Durome, a banker,
is robbed of a red ponemonnaie, containing
30,000 livres, by M. de Folbert, who murders
his victim after robbing him. Tlie crime is
charged against Maurice Count de Uoche
brune, who suffers all manner of tribula
tions in consequence. His name is at
length cleaved, the villain is led off
to the guillotine, and the hero marries the girl
he loves in ihe pro?>er, orthodox fashion. Par
rell Vinton, Fred Butler and Essie Tittel shine
in virtuous roles, Eugene Moore seeming to
have a monopoly of the villainy. Miniia Ferry,
a San Francisco "girl, who made her debut with
the Frawleys during their last engagement at
trie Columbia, is charming as Mademoiselle
Dufrenee, and last night received a number of
beautiful floral tributes.
One 01 the most effective scenes is in the sec
ond act which takes place on a ship that moves
and sways in a most realistic fashion and at
length blows up, jo everybody's consternation.
The hero and heroine escape, as they always
do in properly conducted plays, and are seen
clinging to a spar afloat on the bounding bil
lows as the curtain goes down.
The Grand Opera-house company is to have
n r.ew leading lady, Miss Lisle Leigh, late of
Boston, who has met with much success in the
Kust. Miss Leigh arrived yesterday and will
commence her engagement next week. Mr.
Morosco has had agents in the States for the
past few months looking for a leading lady,
and Miss Leigh seemed to them to be the one
they sought.
At the Alcazar.
Within a brief space of time drama will re
sume sway at the Alcazar. The "continuous
show performances, while excellent in their
way and fairly successful, have not come up to
the expectation of the management. A fine
stock company is being organized and some
fine plays will be presented.
This week's show is bright and varied.
The opening piece is a dramatic sketch, in two
short acts, "rlie Homestead." in which Leon
ard Grover, Fanny Young, Gordon Foster and
several other footllght iavorities say their
briei say so well that one would wish the com
position were of longer duration.
Miss Josephine ("iassman, Miss Victoria Black
and William Duvall contriDute some lyric
gems, while Messrs. Lorraine and Howelb, in
thpir famous travesty act, introducing th>*
gifted dogs, Grip and Jo, scored a great hit.
There is also a farce, "My Wife's Husbands,''
the programme ending with a series of
stereopticon views, representing scenes
in the Erown trial. The portraits of
the Rev. Dr. Brown, Miss Overman,
Mrs. Davidson, Mrs. Stockton and Mrs. Tunnell
are very lifelike, while views are also given of
the residences of Dr. Brown and Mrs. Sarah B.
"Cooper. The pictures are explained by Mr.
Foster, who accompanies the exhibitionby a
brief lecture, giving a synopsis of the famous
church trial and the events leading up to it.
At the Auditorium.
Somehow the minstrels attract people. It
may be that their jokes are coarse and stale,
thpir voices poor and their elocution noticeable
only by its lack; yet even a poor minstrol show
can" draw a crowd. But there are minstrels
and minstrels! Those now at the Auditorium,
while funny enough to keep the audience con
vulsed, display so much real artistic merit in
their methods that critics who go to scoff re
main to praise and enjoy. These minstrels are
no lampblack or burnt cork affairs, but the
i genuine Georgia article, and their perform-
I anee throughout, while displaying careful
| p reparation and study, is marked by a natural
â  nÂ«->- positively charming.
The African Orchestra is specially deserving
of mention on account of its fine rendering of
classic and popular compositions; nor are
bones, tambourines and the jovial middleman
lacking. The first part of the programme
comprises a list of plantation sonfjs and banjo
melodies, terminated by n comic sketch, in
i which Messrs. Hi 11 man and Moore have a
chance to show off their skill as mimics, which
they do to perfection. During the second part
a boneless wonder, Craig by name, ties him
self up into the most alarming knots: Messrs.
Moore and Kemp give s-ome clever impersona
tions of old men, and "the only Jaloon" goes
through some interesting feats of parlor
magic. Mr. Hillman's song and dance, "La
Pasamala," some fine singing by the Crescent
City Quartet and neat comedy" work by Wil
liam Kersands are also features of this part of
the programme.
"Lucy's Lawn Party," a farce in two scenes,
by Neil Moore, is the last number, and has
thus far l.ecu erected with every mark of ap
preciation. The acting is excellent, there be
ing not the slightest approach to anything
forced or overdrawn. It looks as though the
Georgia Minstrels had "tcok."
At the Orpheom.
This week's programme at the Orpheum is
much like that of last week, the usual list of
acrobats, singers and comedians contributing
to make up a fair vaudeville bill. Segommer,
lightning caricaturist, does some clever work,
while (Jertie Carlisle, the child prima donna,
holds her place in the public favor, gaining
new laurels nightly. The remainder of the bill
presents no special features of interest.
ACTIVITY OF SPOKANE
Editor W. H. CowlÂ«i on the Changes
Made by the Gold Mine* and Rise
in Wheat
William H. Cowles, editor and principal
owner of the Spokane Spokesman-Review,
the big morning paper of Eastern Wash
ington, and which circulates largely in
Idaho, Montana and British Columbia, is
at the Palace.
Spokane being situated near the State and
provincial boundaries, and being far from
any city of similar importance, its paper
furnishes the news for a very large region.
Mr. Cowles was the founder of the Spokes
man and was an owner in the Review-
Spokesman. Afterward he obtained con
trol of the property and changed the name
to the Spokesman-Review.
Mr. Cowles say? Spokane is recovering
slowly and steadily from the depression
which occurred in 1893. It is now he says
the most active town in the Northwest.
The Truil Creek gold mines have helped
the city a great deal, and new the Bound
ary Creek mines, also of gold, promise to
help the city still more.
Editor Cowles tells that a good many
men at Spokane who invested in Trail
Creek have made money. If it had not
been for the Trail Creek gold and the ad
vance in wheat times would have been very
dull indeed this year. Wheat went up
from 22 and 23 cents a bushel to 45 and 47
cents, as it is now. As enormous quanti
ties are raised in the Palouse and con
tiguous counties, the advance meant a
great deal for Spokane.
"We have not anything in the nature of
aboom, 1 ' said Mr. Cowles. "I would not
have that understood, but the situation is
so much better than it was that everybody
is encouraged. There was a time when
there was absolutely Homing doing and
money was so hard that the people
thought almost that they had. got to the
end of the world. I think in a year or two
from now we will all be in very good con
dition."
Mr. Cowles has been on a visit to South
ern California. He is accompanied by
Mrs. Cowles.
Arrested for Smuggling.
T. Yamato was arrested by a Deputy United
States Marshal yesterday on a charge of smug
gling forty-seven dozen siik handkerchiefs
into the United states. He was a passenger
ea Uu Coptic from Japan.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1896.

A POPULAR EPISCOPALIAN.
Much Regret Expressed at the De

Rev. F. H. Church, one of the best
known Episcopalian clergymen in this
City, has just accepted a call to St. Luke's
Memorial Church, Taconia, and will leave
for his northern cure in two weeks.
There is great regret among the few
Episcopalians who are as yet aware of the
fact that this City is to lose one of its most
active and popular workers. In addition
to fulfilling ministerial duties, Mr. Church
Rev. F. 11. church, Secretary of the Episcopal Diocese, Who lias Accepted a Call

has been secretary of the Diocese of Cali
fornia for three years, and during that
time he is said to have rendered himself
invaluable to Bishop Nichols by his zeal
and activity. He has also been secretary
of the Convocation of San Francisco and
secretary of the Clericus.
St. LuKes Memorial Church, Rev. F. H.
Church's new cure, is one of the finest
churches in Tacoma. There are a number
of Eastern residents in all the Sound cities
and many of the Eastern Episcopalians in
Tacoma have centered their spiritual in
terest in St. Luke's. The church was built
as a memorial by a Philadelphia gentle
man named Wright, and there are a num
ber of Philadelphians in tne concregation.
St. Luke's is nearer to the business part
of the city than any other church in Ta
coma. It is built of stone and cost $30,
--000. The parish house, which cost $10,000,
is the rectory, and it also contains rooms
and halls where the various church guilds
meet. St. Luke's congregation is said to
be one that takes a special interest in
church work, the tendencies of the wor
shipers are not in any sense ritualistic, but
they are high enough church to believe in
many advanced ideas of work and activity.
The late rector of St. Luke's went away on
the 10th inst. and Mr. Church only re
ceived his call last week, though his nom
ination was made nearly three weeks ago.
He has never been to Tacoma and is not
personally acquainted with any of his
new congregation. Until Mr. Church's
arrival Bishop Barker, the Bishop of the
diocese, is officiating at St. Luke's.
Speaking yesterday of Rev. F. H.
Church's departure Rev. Hobart Chet
wood, editor of the Pacific Churchman,
said: "He will be greatly missed, for not
only is he an active worker and one of the
kindest and most liberal of men, but be
has been very active in the business of the
diocese. He is a model secretary of con
vocation, indeed it seems to me that we
can never really replace him, for Mr.
Church is especially clear-headed, pains
taking and good at details."
It is seven years since Rev. F. H.
Church first arrived in San Francisco
from Connecticut, though he is a native of
Toledo. Ohio. He came to be assistant to
Rev. Dr. Beers of Trinity Church and re
mained with the doctor for two years.
Atter Rev. Mr. Davis went East Mr.
Church took charge of St. Luke's Church
on Van Ness avenue from the early sum
mer till October, when Rev. Mr. Moreland,
the new rector of St. Luke's, arrived.
Since then the departing clergyman has
been doing special missionary work in
San Francisco and Oakland. He has
thoroughly identified himself with Rev.
W. I. Kip's work at the mission of the
Good Samaritan, and at present is officiat
ing at St. James Mission in the Richmond
District.
Rev. F. H. Church's ecclesiastical views
were wittily told by Bishop Nichols at a
banquet given at the Occidental Hotel
soon after the arrival of Rev. Mr. More
land. A number of visiting clergymen
were present, among them being that
clever and eccentric English divine. Dr.
Haweis. Addressing himself to the melo
maniac London preacher Bishop Nichols
said : "We have two clergymen in San
Francisco with ecclesiastical names. One
is E. B. Church, who may be described i
as Exceedingly Broad Church, and the
other F. H. Church, who is Fairly High
Church."
DISCUSSED HISTORY.
Pastors' Clubs Study Morals In Lessons
of the Past â Denominations
Represented.
A paper entitled "A Pagan King, a Brief
Study in Church History," was read yes
terday before the Congregational Monday
Club by Rev. E. Lyruan Hood of Berkeley.
Julian the Apostate was the ruler, whose
influence on church history was described
in a scholarly manner by the speaker.
Rev. A. J. Melchonian, M.D., pastor of
the Armenian congregation' at Fresno,
made a plea for permission to address the
various churches on behalf of the fund to
aid the starving Christians in Armenia.
Mr. Melchonian is lecturing and speaking
to stir up interest in the fund, and he has
already met with considerable success in
the southern part of the State. He said
that in acknowledging the money sent the
distributors of the fund stated that for $5
3500 starving men, women and children
had been fed for twenty-four hours.
"Unless a helping hand be stretched out
to Armenia these people will starve," said
the Armenian pastor.
Methodist Pastors.
The Methodist Preachers' meeting was

declaring that for the most part they made
excellent citizens. In the discussion. Rev.

THEY SPOKE FOR THE DEAD
A Curious Case in Which Neg
lected Papers Terminate
a Lawsuit.
VALUE OF A WOMAN'S MEMORY
The Attempt Made to Secure the Fore
closure of a Mortgage That
Had Been Satisfied.
Several years ago Captain Edward D.
Griffith was master of the bark Ivanhoe.
One day while on the way to this port,
coal-laden and consigned to P. B. Corn
wall, the bar* was caught in a storm and
was wrecked, the master, among others,
being drowned.
Captain A. C. Freese, the Public Admin
istrator, who was well acquainted with
Captain Griffith, applied to the Superior
Courc of this City, which was the late cap
tain's residence, for letters of administra
tion, which were granted, and he at once
set up a search for any property left by the
skipper. The* only things he could dis
cover were some certificates of stock which
had been deposited with Daniel Meyer,
banker. The administrator also learned
that some time prior to the fatal voyage
Captain Griffith had purchased a ranch of
149 acres in Lake County from William F.
and Rudolph Schrader, subject to a mort
gage for $800, held by Samuel Johnston of
this City, who has an office in the Mills
building. There was no record of this
transaction that the administrator could
discover, and he arrived at the conclusion
that the deed, together with other papers,
must have gone to the bottom of the ocean
at the time the bark was wrecked.
Some time after the death of Captain
Gnrtitb, and about the time the mortgage
became due. Johnston commenced an ac
tion in the Superior Court of Lake County
against Captain Freese as administrator to
foreclose the mortgage, and in the pro
ceeding alleged that he held the original
paper.
A further search on behalf of the admin
istrator by his attorneys, J. D. Sullivan
and K. F. Mogan, brought to light only
the fact that the mortgage was still of
record, and that there was no record of
transfer from the Schraders to Griffith.
Captain Freese, knowing that Captain
Griffith was a man who was very precise
in all hi* business transactions and that
in making a purchase such as lias been al
luded to he would make it free from all
incumbrance, had an inward conviction
that the money obtained on the mortgage
had been repaid.
One day he learned from Mrs. Arthur
Cornwall, daughter-in-law of ihe con
signee of the lost bark, that Captain Grif
fith had told her that he was very happy
at the thought of leaving the sea and set
tliner on his ranch, and that he felt par
ticularly hapov because it was all paid for.
At the time fie obtained this information
the case was set for trial on a certain Mon
day in Lake County, and there he was
without any defense to the action except
the statement Captain Griffith had made
to Mrs. Cornwall. He also learned that a
former County Clerk of Lake County was
a resident of Walnut Creek, Contra Costa
County, and he telephoned to him to ascer
tain if any papers had ever been sent to
him with a request to have them recorded.
This was a chance question, but the
answer brought him joy, for it was that
three years ago. when he was County
Clerk, "a deed and release of mortgage in
which the name of Griffith figured were
sent to him, but the usual fee required did
not accompany the papers; therefore they
had been nlaced in a box in the office, and
the writer had no doubt about theie being
still there.
A messenger was sent to Lakeport a few
days ago, and on the Friday before the
day set for trial, the papers mentioned by
the former clerk were found, and they
proved to be the ones which Captain
iirittith had sent up to be recorded.
The administrator in the meantime had
made a demand on Johnston's attorney to
see the original mortgage, and he was told
that it had been mislaid. He intended to
sprinp a sensation in court by producing
the satisfaction of mortgage. "He was not
permitted to do this, for on the day after
the discovery an attorney representing
Johnston appeared ia the Lake County
Superior Court and moved a dismissal for
good and sufficient cause of the action of
Johnston vs. Freese, and the motion was
granted.
"There was not much involved in this,"
said Captain Freese in speaking of this
case, "but when I made answer to the ac
tion that the mortgage had been satisfied
I felt sure of it, and hy beine stubborn and
persistent in the matter the estate was
saved $800. Dead men tell no tales, but
court records sometimes speak in behalf
of the dead, and this is one case in point."
FRED GIBSON'S FORTUNE
His Brother James of Sacra
mento Arrested for Grand
Larceny.
The Complaining Witness in the Case
Is Mrs. Leila Gibson, His
Sister-in-Law.
James A. Gibson was arrested last night
by Detectives Anthony and Crockett on a
warrant charging him with gram', larceny.
The complaining witness is Mrs. Leila
Gibson, wife of his brother, Fred Gibson,
of Our House saloon, on Market street,
near Sixth.
Fred Gibson and his wife, while living
in Sacramento three years ago, agreed to
separate, and he divided the community
property with her. He then had a saloon
there, and part of her share was the saloon.
Gibson went to Arizona with his brother
James, where they remained ten months.
After returning to Sacramento Gibson and
W. Cook, who is now his partner in the
saloon on Market street, went to South
Africa and stayed tnere about a year.
They returned to this City and purchased
the Our House saloon.
On February 6 Gibson went to the Ger
man Hospital to have an operation per
formed. He wrote to his brother James,
giving him instructions as to where his
body was to be buried in the event of the
operation not being successful and as to
other matters. He was removed from the
hospital about three weeks ago, and his
mother came from Sacramento to nurse
him.
On March 16 James was telephoned for
and arrived here the following day. Gib
son had told his partner. Cook, to go the
Safe Deposit vaults and give his mother
all the money, about $20,000, on deposit
there, as he believed he was dying. Cook
drew the money and gave it to Gibson's
mother, in presence of her dying son.
James suggested that she should permit
him to take it with him to Sacramento, as
it would be safer there, and she consented.
Mrs. Leila Gibson came to the City from
Sacramento Sunday and called to see her
uusband for the nrst time since his illness.
She learded that James had taken the
$20,000 to Sacramento, and yesterday
swore out a warrant before Judge Low for
his arrest. After the Judge had been ap
prised of the facts last night he released
James on his own recognizance. His
brother Fred ia expected to die at an;
IT COMES SUDDENLY.
A Note of Warning to Careful-Minded
People.
Scarcely a day passes that one does not hear
of men and women who were in perfect health
being suddenly stricken down by that terrible
disease, pneumonia.
At no time of the year is this dangerous com
plaint so extremely prevalent as during the
present season. There are constant changes;
one day is as mild as summer, the next is bit
terly cold. The very air is filled with disease,
and the slightest exposure often results in
pneumonia. It is a' aisease that comes sud
denly, and it is all the more dangerous because
it comes unannounced. A tickling in the
throat, a tightness in the chest, a difficulty in
breathing and a feeling of weakness, all may
mean the beginning of pneumonia. It is above
all thitigs a disease that requires prompt treat
ment, for if a reaction is brought about the
danger may soon be over; if not, the end may
be near. Any physician who is called in a case
of pneumonia prescribes a stimulant instantly;
but it is always some reliable stimulant such
as pure whiskeyâ all else is useless.
It is precisely for this reason that so many
physicians prescribe that standard and, reliable
whiskey known us Duffy's pure malt. Itjias
saved the lives of thousands who were on the
high road to pneumonia in its worst form, Rnd
it has both prevented and cured the most dan
gerous forms of pulmonary complaints. Asa
great strengthening, vitalizing remedy it has
never been equaled. Be sure that you get
Duffy's pure malt, no matter how much you
may be urged to try something cheaper.

I
Eddie Jones Got Three of the
Winners to the Wire
in Front.
NELSON WON AS HE PLEASED.
The Crack Libertine Defeated Belli
coso and George Miller in a
Common Canter.
The favorites celebrated the opening of !
the week's racing by mking five of the
seven events on the t ;ird at the Bay Dis- !
trict yesterday, it is doubtful j
whether the talent t'>ok home much of the !
bookmakers' coin, for the majority of them !
were of the lukewarm variety.
The weather Â»vas cool and the card not j
being an especially attractive one the at- j
tendance was light.
The clever lightweight jockey, Eddie
Jones, continues riding in excellent form,
three times getting past the wire astride
the Brat horse and once finishing second.
The crack Libertine effectually disposed
of Bellicoso and George Miller in a seven
furlong run. The books held the big bay j
at 1 to 4, and heading Bellicoso on the far j
turn, he won eased up almost to a j
walk in 1:27*4. Miller matte a very credit- !
itabie showing, finishing third, well up.
seventeen very cheap -selling platers,
commonly termed crabs, started in the j
opening five and a half furlong scramble, j
< âº Fleeta, with Marty Bergen up, had first ;
call in the betting at 2% to 1. and heading j
tiondola in the stretch, won cleverly from \
Rocket. Monterey was a close third".
A daughter of Take Notice named Alma j
carried off the honors in the two-year-old j
event, defeating ten fairly good youngsters
iv fast time. The filly opened fit threes
and drifted back to 4to 1. When the bar- |
rier was raised, Alma, St. Dunstm and the
favorite, Lode Star, parted company with
the field and fought it out for supremacy !
to the stretch. Alma gradually forged to |
the front, winning at the end by a lengtu !
from the 15 to 1 chance Modesda. Lode |
Star, who was played down from twos to 9
to 10, finished in tne show. The winner
covered the four furlongs in 49 seconds.
The one-eyed horse Nelson carried most
of the coin bet on the third race, a five and
a half furlong spin. Seven to five was con
sidered a good price, and he ran away from
his field, passing the wire eased up a length
before Last Chance.
The Harris starting gate was used to dis
jntch the field m the mile dash, decided
over the inside course, and worKed with
great success. St. Lee opened favorite at
8 to 5, was played down to 6 to 5, but
again receded to 7to 5 from the force of
cmn that went in on Tar ami Tartar and
I'nity. Palomcita. once as eood as 10 to 1
in the betting, made a runaway race of it,
leading from start to finish, L'nity came

The two-year-old stake is the feature of
the racing to-day.
As usual "Walter J, the consistent run
ning son of imp. True Briton, finished in
side the money.
Chartreuse refused to break and was left
at the post in the last race. She was alO
to 1 chance in the betting.
Dan Miller's mare, Charmion, who was
a starter in the third event of the day, was
reported to have bowed a tendon.
The most extensively tipped horse of the
day was Faro, who was backed from 10
down fo 3}^ to 1. He ran most disappoint
ingly.
In hi 3 arguments to exonerate the ruled
off jockeys the wily Celestial plunger,
Little Pete, lays great stress on the Sea
j Spray-Ike Lraee. He would possibly be
perfectly safe in matching Sea Spray
i against any of the other starters in the
i race won by him on March 19, but how
! would the Chinese plunder like to match
Rosebud against Wheel of Fortune?
! Chora rode the "Whe-4" in a stake event
i won by Rosebud and Pete played his
money on the Burns <fc Waterhouse entry.
On March 23 Chorn rode the hot favorite
j Rebellion in a seven furlong race captured
I by the outsider Montallade, played down
j from 20 to Bto 1. The Chinese shoe manu
facturer makes mention of the fact that he
bet a few hundred dollars on Rebellion,
j but in the excitement of the moment
j probably overlooked the fact that he is
also accredited with cashing some very
racy-looking tickets on the outsider.
COCKERILL DECORATED
Distinguished Honors Heaped on Him
by Japan â Sailed for Europe
to Stay a Year.
Colonel John A. Cockerill, the American
journalist, who went to Japan over a year
ago at $10,000 a year and expanses, has
been the recipient of a signal honor at the
hands of the Emperor. On him has been
bestowed the decorations of the Order of the
Treasury for the just reports he has given
in the United States of the condition of
Japan, combined with his advice on
several occasion?, when it has been re
quested on various state and political
matters.
Editor Cockerill is now en route from
Singapore to Paris at the request of James
Gordon Bennett. He does not expect to
return to Japan, nor will he immediately
return to the United States. He will prob
ably remain in England for a year as the
representative of Mr. Bennett's paper.
W. I>. Edminster, of Cnicago, agent of
Ovide Musin, who is now at the Grand,
was with Mr. CocHerill at the time the
honors of Japan were conferred on the
editor.
"It is the only instance where such an
honor has been bestowed on a newspaper
man," said Mr, Edminster yesterday.
"The ceremony took place at the imperial
palace in Tokio on January 24. Count Ito
bestowed the decorations and an embassa
dor from the Emperor made a speech to
Mr. Cockerill. The insignia consists of a
medal, button and regalia. The latter is
made up of some beautiful shoulder-straps
and sash, while the button is blue and yel
low. 1 was present at the decoration, and
it was a very impressive affair. At Yoko
hama Colonel Cockerill got a telegram from
Mr. Bennett asking him to go to Paris,
and he started around via Suez. I went to
Kobi. Nagasaki, Shanghai, Canton and on
as far as Singapore with him."
Mr. Edminster has a beautifully carved
ebony cane which was presented to him
by Count Ito, and which he prizes highly.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1896.
POTRERO HEIGHTS TO GO
Their Rock to Be Used for the
Valley Railroad and Mis
sion Bay.
MOVEMENT IN REAL ESTATE.
The Opening of a New District by
the Cutting of a Hole Through
Bluerock Hill.
The Potrero Heights, that have loomed
up like a fogbank inThe southern horizon,
will, before many years, be removed to fill
in the tide-land known as Mission J>ay.
When Mr. Huntington is ready to fulfill
his promise to fill xhe large tract of swamp
land which he obtained from the people of
this City with the understanding that it
would be filled in and the railroad works
removed from Sacramento and located
upon this made ground, then the southern
hills will be leveled and made an accept
able residence section. This proposed im
provement on the western side of Ken
tucky street, with the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad depot established in China Basin
on the eastern side, will make the ancient
Long Bridge one of the liveliest Dusiness
portions of San Francisco.
To bring those two proposed sections
into habitable shape, however, Bluerock
Hill will have to be cut down and used as
filling material. Even now real estate on
the Southern Heights has increased in
value, as can be seen by the sale of twelve
inside building lots, 25 by 100 feet, on Min
nesota street, between Sierra and Shasta,
a few weeks ago for $1300 a lot. This
ground is I portion of that swampy hollow
soutn of Bluerock Hill and west of Ken
tucky street, near the rope walk. It for
merly belonged to the Potrero Land and j
Improvement Association.
Another deal in real estate took place a |
short time since in which the Arctic Oil
Company purchased from Patrick Tierny
an entire block fronting on Channel and
Illinois streets and known as New Potrero
block 423. This property adjoins the
ground upon which the oil company's
works are at present located. The oil
company intends to make use of the lot in
conjunction with its present building
and has already itarted driving piles on
the water-front siae facing Central Basin.
The work of cutting down Bluerock.
Hill on the southern side still goes on and
will in the course of a few months make
an opening through the hill on the lines
of Napa and Tennessee streets into Ken
tucky street. When this is done the Po
trero will have an opening from all points
of the compass through Sierra, Shasta,
Napa and Butte east and west, and Ken
tucky, Tennessee, Mariposa and Indiana
north and south. This will open up quite
a large section of territory which will no
doubt be made valuable for business pur
poses.
Farther west on Missouri and Texas, I
Mariposa and Eighteenth streets a gang of
about fifty men went to work yesterday
morning to cut down, fill in and place the
unsightly location in condition to be built
on. This work is also being done by the
Potrero Land and Improvement Associa
tion on a public contract fey the property
owners who are desirous of getting Into
the progressive van with their neighbors
in Sunshine Valley.

FOR SEXLESS SUFFRAGE.
Rev. .!â¢ Camming Smith Lecturea on
the Right of Women to Vote.
At Trinity Presbyterian Church Sunday
evening Rev. J. Curaming Smith chose as
his theme, "The Reigning Spirit of Christ."
After referring to International arbitration
as a case in point, he spoke for a sexless
suffrage. He said:
There is not an argument against female suf
frage that cannot be matched by an argument
against male suffrage You say that women
would only mismanage public matters. I
answer that men now mismanage affairs. You
say that when the novelty of voting wore oft",
women would not cast a vote. I answer that
too many men now fight shy of the polls. You
say that woman's sphere is the home. I answer
that a father has as many duties at his hearth,
and, besides, if the woman is queen of the
house sht ought to have some voice in framing
laws to shield her home.
I am sick of this patronizing attitude of man
toward woman as if she were a tender piece of
of work, started up with a strong ff r ee of
men to get the large quantity of steel re
quired for the nineteen-story building in
which The Call with all of its many
offices will be housed.
In consequence of the desire of the
Government to finish the Oregon the force
of workmen at the Union Iron Works has
not been reduced. This ana other contract
work has kept the men constantly em
ployed for a longer period without inter
mission than has been the case heretofore.
SPORTS OF ALL KINDS.
Choyngki Will Arrive on Thursday.
Olympic Club Wrestler*.
Director Short of the Olympic Club is
corresponding with the Sacramento Ath
letic Club with a view of matching John
son, the heavy-weight champion boxer of
Sacramento, against Van Buskirk, a pupil
of Professor Walter Watson of the Olym*
pic Club.
If the match be arranged the boxers will
appear in a six-round bout at the Me
chanics' Pavilion in May, when the club
will hold its benefit entertainment.
Joe Choynski, who is matched to box
Sharkey before the National Athletic Club
on the evening of April 16 in this City, is
expected to arrive Thursday. Joe will be
met on the arrival of the overland train at
Sixteenth-street station, Oakland, by a
number of his old friends, who will wel
come bis return to his native City.
In all probability Choynski will train
for Lis bout with Sharkey at Barney
Foley'B hostelry near Ingleside.
Sharkey has Billy Smith and Danny
Need ham attending him at his training
quartets near the Cliff House. He has
great confidence in his ability to stand off
the heavy punching of Choynski for eight
rounds.
The proposed twenty-round contest be
tween Jimmy Barry of Chicago and
Jimmy A.ntnony, the little favorite of
Barney Foley, is off for the r resent.
Barry, according to latest accounts, has
had an operation performed on one of his
hands which will prevent him from en
gaging in any kind of athletic exercise
wuh "his dukes" for somÂ« weeks to come.
A contest between Anthony and Barry
would certainly prove very interesting, as
both men are remarkably clever and very
game.
This evening the Olympic Club will hold
a wrestling tournament, the entries for
which appeared exclusively in The Call
of last Saturday. Professor Miehling
states positively that some very exciting
sport is in store for any of the members
who fancy wrestling, and that after the
contests there will be exhibitions of head
balancing and club swinging by profes
sional artists.
Next Sunday a gymnastic exhibition by
the combined classes of the San Francisco
Turn Verein will be given at Turner Hall,
323 Turk street.
IN SUNSET DISTRICT.
Progressive Residents Pass Resolutions
and Do Other Business.
A well-attended mass-meeting of the
residents and property-owners of the Sun
set District, south of Golden Gate Park,
"was held at Park View Hall, corner of
Ninth avenue and H street, on last Saturn
day evening, the 28th inst. Charles Cush
man was elected president pro tern. T. P.
Taylor acting as secretary.
Addresses were made by Messrs. Mc-
Intyre, Keller, Conklyn, Cushman and
others. The remarks of the gentlemen
were pertaining to improvements, pro
[ jected or under way.
A resolution indorsing the Sunset Dis-
I trict Improvement Club and pledging the
â  moral and united support of the residents
j to that local organization was passed
I unanimously. The meeting closed with
j cheers for Mr. J. Conklyn in appreciation
i of his many elforts for the improvement of
1 the district.
inferiority and then christening that view of
the fait sex as chivalry. I look upon the
knighthood of the middle apes as a piece of
barbarism and an insult to a true woman.
Sexless suffrage is bound to come. All evils
will not take flight when it comes, of course,
but many evils that now poison the fireside
will get their sternest rebuke when woman
gets to vote.
la a word, if this is to be God's country there
must be but one qualification for franchise fit
ness: let every man and woman be twenty-one
years in the country before being vested wtth
the franchise, and leu them, further, be edu
ce ted and in sympathy with our American in
stitutions before they vote. Then our republic
will stand on a better basis.
John Smith Bobbed.
James Johnson, an ex-convict, and his wife
Lizzie, living in the Oakland House, 644^
Howard street, were arrested yesterday by
Policeman T. L. Ryan on the charge of petty
larceny. They got John Smith, a carpenter,
into their room on Sunday night and robbed
him of iiis gold watch and chain.
THEY WANT A DIRECTORY.
Merchants' Association Addresses
the City Hall Com
missioners.
A RATHER SPIRITED LETTER.
The Merchants Disclaim Any Wish to
Interfere With the Commis
â¢ sioners' Duties.
The lack of a directory on each floor of
the new City Hall has for some time been
a subject requiring, in the estimation of
most frequenters of that municipal pile, a
prompt and adequate adjustment. The
Merchants' Association has been particu
larly active in advocating the introduction
of this needed improvement, and consid
erable correspondence on the matter has
taken place between the association and
the Board of City Hall Commissioners.
Some of thi9 correspondence has been by
no means lacking in spirit, as the follow
ing communication, sent yesterday, will
go to show :
To the Honorable the Board of City Hall Com
missionersâ Gentlsmen : Your favor of the 25th
inst. is at hand, acknowledging the receipt of
our communication of the 20th inst. relative
to a directory and index to the offices and de
partments of the new City Hall. You inform
us that our "communication was filed, and at a
future meeting a full and complete reply will
be made and forwarded."
While awaiting your promised answer to our
letter, we. cannot permit certain statements in
the published accounts of your meeting of the
24th inst. to go unanswered. Assuming that
the published reports of the proceedings of
your last meeting are correct, it appears:
Firstâ That you regard our efforts to obtain a
directory for the new City Hall as '-outside in
terference with your omcial duties."
Secondâ That you have the impression, that
the conception of tins directory originated
with our Consulting Engineer McCullough,
who is designated by you as <- a bright young
man from Sausalito."
Thirdâ That you do not approve of the style
of directory proposed by this association, but
that you "will have a directory as soon as the
building is in shape to receive it."
Fourthâ That the ''Supervisors had no right
to grant the privilege of placing a directory in
the new City Hall," and that "the allowance of
$125 for the work would not be paid."
Fitthâ That you ordered your "architect to
prepare a directory six months ago, but that
the matter had remained in abeyance because
of other business."
The above extracts from the published re
ports of your last meeting require some an
swer on our part, so that the position of this
association may be correctly understood by
your honorable board, as well as the citizens
and taxpayers of San Francisco, who take an
interest in municipal affairs.
Firstâ As to "interference with your official
duties," permit us to refer you to the constitu
tion and programme for progress of the Mer
chants' Association, of which, under another
cover, we forward you copies. By turning to
page 18, article I, section 2, you will readily
see that this associution has adopted as a lead
ing principle for the improvement and wel
fare 01 . San Francisco "co-operation with City
officials and an active interest in the care of
public institutions."
The first aim of the Merchants' Association
is to advance practical measures for the public
welfare, and many improvements have been
effected by co-operation with various munici
pal departments and officials. Such co-opera
tion, although apparently regarded by you as
"interference with official duties," has fortun
ately received hearty support and encourage
ment irom City officials generally, and the
beneficial results are much appreciated by the
community. The constitutional privilege
granted to the people of expressing their senti
ments freely for the common good, and in
structing their representatives, has ever been
recognized as a fundamental and sacred right
of American citizenship.
Secondâ As to the inception of a directory in
the new City Hall, it originated from the di
rect observation of those directors and memb
ers of this association who had frequent oc
casion to visit the City Hfcll. The annoyance
and difficulty in finding courts, departments
and officials in that building and the unavoid
able loss of time incurred thereby, naturally
elicited the inquiry, "Why should there not be
a directory in the new City Hall, as in. all large
modern office buildings?" Upou investigation
it was found that no provision had been made
for any directory in the new City Hall. In
structions were therefore given six months ago
by the board of directors to the consulting
engineer of this association to prepare plans
and specification! for the work. Numerous
plans were considered, and finally the plan,
specifications and estimates were adopted by
the board of directors of this associution and
subsequently by the entire Board of Super
visors, just us originally proposed to your-hon
orable board last January.
Thirdâ As to the style or plan of a directory
for the City Hall, there is no disposition on the
part of till* association to insist upou any par
- ticular style or plan. Any system of directory
that will be a plain and complete guide to the
various offices and departments in the City
Hall is all tnat is required or can be expected.
The simple plan proposed by this association
has had the earnest consideration of the board
of directors for the past six months, and we
believe it would prove an excellent and inex
pensive directory system for the entire build
ing. However, if your board prefers some
other style of directory we are willing to with
draw our plan, provided you proceed at once
to introduce this much needed improvement.
Wo be"g, however, to ask your honorable board
to reconsider your decision to postpone this
much needed directory until the City Hall is
finally completed. We respectfully submit
that this simple matter should not be longer
postponed. Let a suitable directory be at once
provided and the benefits of it enjoyed without
further delay.
Fourthâ You question the right of the Board
of Supervisors in unanimously empowering
the Merchants' Association "to prepare and
finish a directory and index to the offices and
departments in the new City Hall building in
accordance with specifications submitted the
cost of said directory and index not to exceed
#125." Although we believe there is no ques
tion as to the validity of the foregoing action
of the Board of Supervisors we are willing to
waive tne legal point entirely if assurance is
given that an adequate directory will be pro
vided by your honorable board without fur
ther delay.
Fifthâ We are glad to know that you had
"ordered your architect to prepard a directory
six months ago," but regr.et to hear that press
of other business prevented the execution of
this much-needed improvement. As a few
days' labor will suffice to furnish the entire
building with a complete directory we hope
sufficient time will now be devoted to the
work, and we will cheerfully co-operate by
placing at your disposal without charge ail
the plans and specifications already prepared
by this association.
In conclusion, it must now be clearly ap
parent to your honorable board that the efforts
of this association to secure a directory in the
new City Hall are made with the sole motive
of accomplish ing a measure of practical benefit
to the public. There is no private interest at
stake nor any personal teeling whatever.
There is not the slightest disposition to tres
pass upon the official duties of any public
servant.
Composed of citizens and taxpayers of San
Francisco, united for the purpose of municipal
progress and improvement, the Merchants'
Association feels perfectly justified in calling
attention to any improvement in the munici
pal government, that promises to result in the
public good. This association, we think, has a
right to expect that all officials in our mu
nicipal government will meet its suggestions
in the same kindly spirit in which -they. are
tendered. Though there may be difference's of
opinion as to certain measures, no ill-feeling
or bitterness need be engendered.
If correctly reported by the press the consid
eration of this little directory has given rise
to a degree of friction among the members of
your honorable board, and a conflict of au
thority between your board and the Board of
Supervisors, that cannot fail to impair the
usefulness of our City government and lower
the dignity of this municipality. There has
not been the slightest intention on our part to
cause any such display of feeling, nor is there
the leaÂ«t occasion for it. Unfortunately it has
arigen, but we trust that the high regard for
the public welfare, so generally and justly
credited to your honorable board, will neither
permit its recurrence nor Its interference in
making early provision for this little but
necessary directory. Sincerely yours,
Merchants' Association,
V. W. Dohrmann, President.
J. Richard Freed, Secretary.
Secretary Freud said yesterday that he
hoped soon to see a practically useful wall
directory on each floor of the new City
Hall. *
Foster's Contempt.
The contempt case of A. W. Foster, president
of the San Francisco and North Pacific Rail
road, was before Judge Seawell yesterday. The
case wag argued, and a decision will be rea
dered this mornlne. The decision of Judge
ScaweU in the contempt case will be taken at
once to the Supreme Court, and the higher
tribunal will pass upon the case under that
proceeding.
WILMERDING SCHOOL.
University Regents Will Be Urged to
Bave It Located in This
City.
At 1:30 o'clock this afternoon the Re
gents of the University of California will
meet at the Hopkins Art Institute. The
principal matter to come up for considera
tion will be the designation of the locality
for the Wilmerding Technical School. Ay
delegation from the Merchants' Associa
tion will be present for the purpose of
urging the claims of San Francisco as the
site for the proposed institution. James
D. Phelan, one of the most enthusiastic
workers for this end, when seen yesterday,
remarked that he and his co-workers had
done all in their power to have the school
located in this City, where so many friend
less and homeless boy 3 are growing up
into a manhood unworthy of the name.
It is even rumored that Mr. Phelan has
one of hi.s forceful and logical speeches
prepared, and, if all else fails, will use it
upon the Regents.' His opinion is, how
ever, that, speech or no speech, the Re
gents ought to perceive the weighty rea
sons why the school should be located
here. "
IMPROVING ITS ROADBEDS
Novel Device Adopted by the
Southern Pacific to Pre
serve Its Ties.
Comfort, Safety and Economy Effected
The Usefulness of Redwood
i -â -â¢-â¢â  .-...â 
Enhanced.
-As a result of the policy being pursued
by the Southern Pacific redwood ties are
likely to be more in ; demand than ever,
and their use may be extended to lines
; now using harder and more costly ma
terial on which to lay their rails.
Redwood has peculiar lasting qualities;
in fact no wood of its weight and density
has ever been discovered to equal it in this
respect. } The objection, however, to its
more extended use for railroad ties, has
been that its softness permitted the rail to
sink into the tie, and thus not only dam
age fehe tie, but make the roadbed some
what rough and uneven. By an innova
tion this drawback is virtually eliminated
About two years ago, while he was sta
tioned at the Atlantic end of the road,
General Manager Kruttschnitt began the
use of what are known as tie plates. These
are plates of Bteel a little wider than the
base of the rail and the length of the width
of a tie. It has three ribs on the under
side and these ribs bold the plate in place
on the tie after it has been driven into the
tie with a maul. At diagonally opposite
corners of the plate are the holes through
which are driven the spikes by which the
rails are held down. On each tie are two
plates, one for each rail, and about 5700
plates are required for each mile of track.
These plates effectually prevent the rail
from sinking into and wearing away the
tie, and thus not only save the tie. but
preserve the smoothness of the roadbed.
They also add materia ly to the safety of
the road, for a rail before it can be forced
from alignment must move both spikes
which hold it down to the tie through the
tie plate, wtiereas under the old method
the foosening of one spike was enough to
permit a rail to spread.
On the eastern portion of the Southern
Pacific Railroad pine and cypress ties are
used, but these must first be prepared so
as to make them lasting, but redwood re
quires no treatment from preservatives,
and with the introduction of tie plates will
become more popular than ever in railroad
construction.
Ti.e Southern Pacific Company is the
first to apply this innovation to any great
extent, having put in 2,000,000 on the
Atlantic end of the Southern Pacific and
about 1,800,000 on this end. The plates
cost about 10 cents each, and the improve
ment thus far effected by means of their
use has cost $380,000. The plan of utiliz
ing them will be pursued until gradually
the whole system will be thus re-enforced
and improved.
Another general plan of improving the
Southern Pacific Railroad is being fol
lowed, in the shape of ballasting with
gravel wherever the traffic is heavy and the
roadbed naturally dusty. Ballasting with
gravel, it is claimed by Generul Manager
Kruttschnitt, not only makes the road
safer, but cleaner and smoother. Among
the portions now being thus treated are
the stretches between Mojave and Palm
dale, Bakersfield and Pampa, and ten
miles in the San Gonronio pass on the
Southern Pacific, and on the Coast divi
sion between Pajaro and San Bruno.
Six new postal-cars have been added to
the equipment of the Central Pacific Rail
road, at a cost of about 1f 4500 each. They
are vestibuled, gas lighted and steam
heated, and will run between Oakland and
Ogden.
General Manager Kruttschnitt, who re
turned from his three weeks' tour of in
spection of the Southern Pacific Railroad
yesterday, and who accompanied Cornelius
Vanderbilt and Chauncey Depew of the
New York Central Railroad, from New Or
leans to the Coast, left the New York rail
road men at Santa Barbara on Sunday. It
is expected that the distinguished sojourn
ers wiil arrive in this City to-morrow or
Thursday.
IS NO "BUGIARDO."
Pietro Gori, the Anarchist, Calls in
Vain on I/Italia for the
Proof.
Pietro Gori, the famous Italian anarchist,
addressed a large meeting at Union-square
Hall Sunday afternoon. The subject of
his address was "The Men and the Anar
chistic Ideas." He reviewed the lives and
works of many prominent anarchists who
had forsaken fortunes and position to ad
vance the anarchist propaganda. In con
cfusion. he invited all who believed in an
archy to join the society which has been
recently organized in this City. The chief
requirements to become an anarchist were
strong faith and good wind.
After the regular address. Gori read a
challenge which he had caused to be
printed in one of the Italian papers,wberein
he called upon the editors of L'ltalia,
Messrs. A. Almagia and E. Patrizi, to ap
pear yesterday aiternoon and make good
their assertion that he was a "bugiardo."
A bugiardo is a cowardly liar, and it is
said L'ltalia had already published a re
traction. No answer was made to Gori's
summons yesterday, and he proceeded to
make an ex parte statement of the diffi
culties between himself and the offending
paper.
POINTS ON ARBITRATION.
A Party Is Entitled to the Presence of
All Arbitrators.
Judge Seawall has decided an interest
ing point in arbitration on a point raised
in the suit of Mary E. Pleasant against
Clive J. Clark and others.
The original case was a fight over the
sale of a lot, and then the question was
finally laid before three arbitrators. All
three arbitrators did not always meet, and
upon that ground Judge HeaweH granted a
motion to set a^ide their award.
"While a majority might decide," said
Judge Seawell, -still the parties were at
every meeting entitled to the support and
arguments of all, and when one was ab
sent this condition of things was not
attained."
The awari was to Mrs. Pleasant, and
Judge Seawell set it aside.

NEW YORK. N. V., March 30. âAs of late |
American Tobacco was the special feature of the ;
stock market again to-day, the transactions
-mounting to nearly 70,000 shares in a grand total
if 196,000 shares. The stock, after an early break
of 3 per cent to 85V 2 , which was generally consid
ered a scoop, advanced sharply to 90 and"later got
back to 89V4@89i^. The rise was due to the old
report that the directors On Wednesday next will
resume dividend payments. The strength of to
bacco finally affected sugar and that stock moved
ip to 1163/8, the best figure for some days past.
I The improvement was in a large measure the re
sult of efforts to cover short contracts.
Chicago Gas was irregular and in the main
lower, while General .Electric and Leather pre
ferred were firm. The decision of the Illinois
Supreme Court in the case of the old whisky trust
had no effect on the stock, as the company has
been reorganized. The railway list was strong,
â¢-specially for th" Grangers, Louisville and Nash
ville, Baltimore and Ohio and the Southwesterns.
The improvement was due nrincipally to the fact
that the rumors current last week about heavy
gold shipments by to-morrow European steamers
tiled to materialize.
Other favorable developments were the reduc-
on in the price paid for gold bars by the Bank of
. England and the excellent statement of St. Paul
J for February. A belief that the corn-carrying
roads will enjoy a good traffic in the near future
also exerted. good influence. The operations for
London account were unimportant. The improve
ment in the railway list ranged from 1/2 to 1%, .
jfloclc Island leading. In the specialties, Tennessee
coal and iron rose 1.%,t0 28 : on the announce
â¢ ment that the leading Southern â¢ iron producers
have reached an agreement for a. joint selling
agency, and thai the money for the creation of the
I big steel plaat at Birmingham has been secured.
Illinois Steel jumped 4% to 65. Speculation
B cosed firm in tone. Net changes show gains of
â  3 t@lVi per cent, Bock Island leading.

IWANT BUT ONE BRIDGE
Â°, Captains and Owners Will Re
.: â. new Their Fight Against
; â¢ 'â¢ Obstructions.
CONFERENCE CALLED TO-DAY.
Mayor .Davie Thinks Colonel Suter
= Intends to Exercise His Inde
pendence.
Oaklanp Office Sab Fraxcisco Call,)
â¢JOS Broadway, March 30. )
A large proportion of the ship captains
whose busine.-s makes .it necessary for
them to pass through the estuary bridge
have signed a statement that will be read
to Colonel Suter in San Francisco to-mor
row, when the matter of the bridge is
again taken up for discussion.
The petition reads as follows:
â > To Colonel Suter, United States Engineerâ
The following captains of vessels trading
in and out of the port of Oakland wish to
add our testimony as to the inconvenience
caused by having to wait for the opening of
the two obstructing bridges now across the
tstuary. Owing to the growing commerce
of the port and the additional wharves
that have been built west of Lake Merritt,
it is advisable that there be but one bridge
, and that it be built as far east as poisible.
There is no necessity for two bridges and
they are unreasonable obstructions to
navigation, being too narrow for safety.
We respectfully ask that you recommend
but one bridge and that it be a steel struc
ture, with the draw not less than 150 feet
wide and so constructed that it will ac
commodate all the traffic that now crosses
the estuary.
The petition is signed by more than fifty
ship captains and owners of vessels and
will be presented to Colonel Suter to-mor
row.
Great efforts are being made by the
Soutnern Pacific Company to prevent the
Government from ordering a large steel
â  bridge, the expense of which would have
to be jointly borne by the railroad, the
streetcar company and the county. To
prevent this the Southern Pacific Com
pany has said that tome time in the
future it will, when it suitÂ« its con
venience, repair the Alice-street bridge
and will run all its trains over it and
leave the decayed Webster-strset bridge
for the county. Should Colonel Suter in
sist upon the draws being made 150 feet
t! en the railroad company will be forced
to stand its share of the contemplated
steel bridge as the Alice-street bridge can
not be remodeled so as to have a draw of
that width.
It is the opinion of Mayor Davie that the
Southern Pacific Company is doing all
that it can to get the county to build anew
â  bridge, after which the company will by
some means or other oDtain a new fran
chise and then take its traffic over it in
stead of Having to maintain its own richt
of way. "The company has always done
just as it pleased with Alaraeda County.''
said the Mayor to-day, "and unless its
â¢ band is exposed it will continue to get
, , all it wants. Colonel Suter seems to
â¢ have a mind -of his own and to be inde
pendent of everybody and consequently
there is some hope that the rights of the
people may be expected at last. For the
past twenty years the Government engi
neering on the estuary has been very
" 'much just what the people do not want."

CONTRACTOR MISSING,
He Went Away, nnt Did Not Even Tell
His Wife When He Might
Pel uiu.
OAKLAND, Cal.. March 30.â The mill
men and material men of San Francisco
and Oakland are anxiously awaiting the
location of F. L. Hansen, a building con
tractor, well known on both sides of the
ba?, who has been missing for a week or
ten days past.
Mr. Hansen has been residing at 615
Thirty-third street in a cottage recently
erected. When seen to-day Mrs. Hansen
said her husband had left a week ago
Wednesday, saying he was going to San
Jose, but lie did not say why he was going
or how long he would De away. She said
ehe had received no word from him since
he went away and had no idea when he
would return.
When informed that the report was cur
rent about the city that Mr. Hansen had
left the city for good she did nut seem to
be at all surprised, but she said she
thought he would not be likely to leave
permanently without taking his family
with him.
Mr. Kansen has been considered a good
workman and stood high in the estima
tion of contractors and mechanics, having
been exceedincly prompt in meeting all
bills. In this city he has executed many
large contract?, one of the largest being the
new High School carpenter work. His
latest job has been a Government contract
at the Presidio in San Francisco.
Among the frequenters of the Building
Exchange Mr. Hansen's absence has
created considerable talk and it is esti
mated that his indebtedness is from $10,000
to $14,000. Report placed his bill to Burn
ham it Standeford planing-mill at $1800,
but the manager there denies this and
*ays it is not over $1000. Among other
creditors in this city are the Pierce Hard
ware ConiDany, P. N. Kuss, Brode the iron
works man and Cohen the glazier; but the
heaviest creditors are said to be the ma
terial men of San Francisco.
Hansen was Been in the Builders' Ex
change, San Francisco, last Wednesday,
when he agreed togo to the bank ana dra\v
the necessary cash to pay certain bills
presented at that time. Some two months
ago he went off in a mysterious manner,
but returned in about ten days, sayin he
had been to Southern California. Some of
his creditors now express the opinion that
he was reconnoitering so as to have a loca
tion when ready to take his departure.

OUTGROWN ITS CHARTER
Livermore Is Now Too Big to
Govern Itself With Dig
nity.
ANXIOUS TO REIN CORPORATE.
The Matter Will Probably Be Sub
mitted to the Electors Next
May.
LIVERMORE, Cal., March 30.â 1t is
almost certain that at the May elec
tion at Livermore the voters will decide to
reincorporate as a city of the sixth class.
For some time the feeling has been grow
ing that the town has outgrown its charter
and should take on a new lease of life.
Particularly has this conviction in-

Three Prominent Men of Livermore Who Think the Town Has Outgrown Its Old
Charter and should Kcincorporate.
[From a photograph.}
creased since the League of Progress started
its work some months ago. It is very
likely that a petition will be addressed to the
Board of Trustees next month asking them
to submit the question to a vote of the peo
ple at the coming election. It will be
necessary to get tlie signatures of one-lifth
of the qualified voter" of the corporation
to a petition. The Trustees will then, in
obedience to the law, include in their elec
tion proclamation a call upon the people
>o vote on the proposition. If two thirds
or more of all the votes cast are for re
incorporation the matter will be settled.
The need of a local government for
Livermore that has power to regulate and
compel street and sidewalk improvements
and that can if it wishes acquire public
work? ?uch as- light and waterworks is
more -.early realized than ever.
One of the objections raised to reincor
poration is that the county Supervisors
might put a license tax in incorporated
towns, but Supervisor Bailey says that he
does not think Livermore need fear that
the county will try to put any license tax
on incorporated towns. Such a thing has
never yet been done in Alaraeda County
and Mr. Bailey says he does not believe it
ever would be done.
Trustee A. W. Feidler.is unreservedly in
favor of ihe town going forward one step.
He says the town has outgrown its old
charter and should recognize that fact as
soon as possible.
Reuben Hunter is heartily favorable to
the proposed move. "We are away behind
the times," he said. "Let us disband alto
gether or else reincorporale. If we want
people to come and invest here we must
show that we have some confidence in our
selves."
Madison Best declares that if the town
eoes anead reincorporation will be an ab
solute necessity. The majority of the
business men and property-owners are in
favor of the town going ahead, and it now
looks as if Livermore, owing to its near
ness to Corral Hollow, will rapidly in
crease in importance.
THE UNIVERSITY ATHLETES
They Will Go East From Berke
ley College Again This
Summer.
Mrs. Susan Harms Dies After a Brief
Illness â The Confiscated Liquor
Story.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 30.â Amid a
loud round of applause the students of the
University of California voted at a meeting
this afternoon to send their track athletic
team across the continent again this sum
mer. The vote was unanimous.
Not a dissenting voice was heard when
President Friend called for the negative
vote. The meeting was full of enthusiasm
from beginning to end and resembled
much the meeting of one year ago. when i
tne Berkeley collegians were called to- j
gether for a similar purposeâ that of con
sidering the practicability and advisability !
of sending California athletes to compete ]
on Eastern tracks.
Colonel George C. Edwards, commonly j
known as the "father of athletics" at the j
university was the first to sDeak in rela- j
tion to the Eastern trip of *9f>. He was j
followed by ex-track Captain Koch, Car- j
tain Merwin, ex-Manager North and C. R. i
Morse, who spoke in favor of the proposed J
trip.
Colonel Edwards in his remarks said:
"We all know the difficulties whicti sur
rounded us last year when we talked of j
sending the team East. Many said it was
foolish to attempt to compete against such
men as are found in the Big Four, but the I
results showed differently. The venture I
proved to be of the greatest possible good
to athletics on this coast, especially at i
Berkeley. It is a well known fact that !
athletics here were on the dec-line last year i
and that something was needed to revive j
the interest. Such a thing was the East- i
crn trip. If the lack of interest had con- j
tinued for two years longer in the same j
ratio Stanford would have easily beaten I
us in the annual intercollegiate.
"There has been some question as to
whether the team this year is good enough
to send. In reply to this I may say that j
last year at this time the j>r>spocts were
not so favorable by a considerable differ
ence as they are now. To send a team this I
year last year's success will be em
phasized, and then it cannot be said of us |
that the work of '95 was only a spurt. It
behoves us to interest ourselves in this
matter for our individual good, the good
of the university and of the State."
Manager Friend spoke of the finrncial
side of the question and assured the
students that with their support at the
entertainments and benefits to be given in
behalf of the team the necessary funds j
can be raised.

titled to the big "C" emblem:

â  on Telegrapn avenue, denies the state
ment made that she has received any of
tlie liquor, which was confiscated some
months ago by Marshal Lloyd, from either

ALAMEDA, Cal., March 30.âArrange
ments have been made and work will be
commenced forthwith 'Â to transform the
California or Laundry Farm Railroad from
a steam road to an electric. The western
terminus is now at Fruitvale, but it will be
extended to Alameda and will be at Park
street and the tidal canal. The tracks will
remain as they are and the wire carried on
iron brackets from a single line of poles.
Three large cars are being made at Newark
for this traffic especially, and each will
have an electric motor of 125 horsepower,
capable of hauling a very, considerable
train. "..â '. [' /W'
Wheeler, superintendent of the line,
who has resigned his position and ex
pected to leave the road to-morrow, will
remain a month longer, while the improve
ments and changes are being made. It is
expected the road will do a big business
this year in the way of picnics. . It is
believed by some that transforming this
road into an electric line means its exten
sion; as it may readily be extended now,
while as a steam road the cost and work
would have been prohibitive.

ELEPHANTS AND TIMBER
Stolen by the Siamese Govern
ment From an American
Missionary.
LEFT HIS CLAIM TO HIS WIFE.
It Has Been Administered Upon and
Will Probably Be Paid After
Arbitration.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 30. f
A unique estate lias just been adminis
tered upon in the Supreme Court. Special,
letters were issued to-day to Mrs. Sarah
Bradley Cheek upon the estate of her hus
band, Dr. M. A. Cheek, who died some
time ago in Siam. The will was made at
Bangkok, and the estate consists of a claim
against the Government of Siam, which is
stated as of unknown value.
Many years ago Dr. Cheek went to Siam
as an American medical missionary, and
wbile there he saw an opportunity to
make a profitable investment in the de
velopment of the timber trade of that
country. He secured some valuable con
cessions in the teak timber country, some
500 miles up the river from Bangkok, and
floated his logs down the river to the port
in the rainy season. The project turned
out to be very profitable, and one of the
native princes announced that he would
like to come into the business as a part ner.
Dr. Cheek had no particular desire for a j
royal partner, but he understood that the j
proposition was a polite intimation that j
there might trouble if he did not comply,
so the partnership was agreed upon on I
condition that a certain number of logs j
were to be sent down each season and he I
was to share the profits after the expenses !
were paid. Dr. Cheek did the active work j
and employed a large number of natives, i
He also owned 176 elephants. One season I
the river was so low that no timber was!
sent down. The Prince objected to this j
and although double the number of logs
Were sent down the next season the Prince
professed to be dissatisfied and assigned
his interest to the Government. The Gov
ernment made the default in the shipment j
of logs a pretext for forfeiting the con- I
tract, which had then five years to run.
The Government also confiscated Dr.
CheeU's elephants. The matter was taken
in hand by the United States Minister,
but had not been adjusted when Dr.
Cheek died.
Dr. Cheek's claim for $80,000 was referred
to the United States Government at Wash
ington and approved for the full amount,
and the Minister at Bangkok was instructed
to request its payment.
The Siamese Government is now anxious
to have the matter submitted to arbitra
tion. Mrs. Cheek is a resident of Oakland,
ana about a year ago inaugurated the
( humrum society for young women's mu
tual improvement. Her sons are now at
tending the State University, and are also
heirs under the terms of the will.
NO SUCH OFFICE.
Money Paid to a County License Col
lector Should Be in the
Treasury.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 30.â Assistant
District Attorney Lincoln S. Church read
the full decision of tlie Supreme Court to
the Board of Supervisors this afternoon in
the matter of the License Tax Collector.
It held that the Board of Supervisors had
no more right to hire some one to collect
license taxes at a certain compensation
than they had to create an office and fix
its salary, as it was only another name for
doing the latter act; further, that it is the
duty of the County Tax Collector to col
lect all taxes levied by the Board of Super
visors, and the court is directed to per
manently enjoin the Treasurer from pay
ing a salary to any one doing the work.
Tlie members of the board were advised
that there was nothing left for them to do
except to adopt a resolution rescinding
the resolution adopted February 14, 1895,
appointing J. W. Ballrud to collect the
license taxes, and also to adopt a resolu
tion directing the County Tax Collector to !
receive all license taxes. At the request of
the board he prepared the resolutions and
they were passed unanimously.
County Tax Collector Barker says that
he is willing to receive any liquor license
tax whicn may be presented to him at his
office, but he will not specially employ
men to look after the business. "The law
says I shall receive the taxes and pay
them into the treasury, and I am will
ing to do that with respect to such taxes
as are brought to tbis office. The law does
not say that I shall go through the county
to look into each case and see who is in
arrears and who is not."
James W. Ballard, the deposed officer,
says: "The collection of saloon licenses is
an entirely different business from collect
ing taxes on personal and real property.
It has always required special work, as
there are changes taking place in the man- \
agement of these saloons at all times, and j
the holders of licenses have to be watched I
to make them keep their payments up. If
they do not pay promptly, out continue in
business, they are violating the license
law; but such a violation cannot be de- j
tected by a man who remains in his office !
all the time. Who will now see that !
liquor is not sold without a. license? The j
constables and their deputies won't, as i
there is nothing in it for them."

8. Bulk sang two comic songs that were
loudly applauded.
He "was followed by Miss Mary C. Schaf
fer with a piano solo, after which George
Mau gave an exhibition of his skill on
the banjo, and it was a clever performance.
R. C. Altschul, a young elocutionist, fa
vored the audierice with recitations that
were received with loud applause. Andy
Branch, in a stirring address, told the au
dience of the benttit of the order, and
urged upon all those who have relatives
dependent upon them to become kniehts.
This was followed by an instrumental
duet by Rudolph Habn and William Cel
larius, a recitation by Senator Thomas
Maher ("Asthore"), a vocal solo by N. Stan
ley Fairweather, a violin solo by Colonel

At the close df the entertainment a
number of those present signed applica
tions to become members of the order.
The floor was then cleared and those

until midnight.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of: Colonel Balardt, L. Rosenberg,

custom duties at the port of San Francisco the
I sum of $158,176,980, while since 1870 it has
j appropriated for the harbor of San Francisco
but $"75,000, less than one-thirtieth of 1 per
cent; now therefore be it
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of
the county of Alameda heartily indorse the

sons advanced therein asking for appropria
tions to cover the needs of ths harbor of San
I Francisco, to wit: The survey and removal of
| dangerous rocks, a steam fog vessel tor the
| entrance to the harbor, a cable to the south
east Farallon Island, a house for the telegraph

tions of the currents of the bay, a tog signal

THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE SZANIK BABY
The Infant a Daughter of a
Merchant in Hayes
Valley.
THE MOTHER A DOMESTIC
Born at the City Hospital and
: Christened at St.
Peter's.
HOW A HUSBAND WAS DUPED.
i
Mrs. Szanik's Clever Plan That the
Babe Should Be Carried to Her
Doorstep. 4
The true parentage of the much-talked
of red-haired infant that was left on the
Szanik doorstep h..- boeii discovered.
The girl baby, vrho is on her way to
Australia with her foster mother, Mrs.
Annie E.-Dooley-Szanik, is the daughter
of a young domestic and a prominent mer
chant of Hayes Valley. â¢
About a year ago a pale girl with auburn
hair presented herself at the City and
County Hospital and told the old story of
a weak woman's wrongs. Beyond the fact
that she was poor and ill and friendless,
she declined to give the information re
quired for the register of the institution.
She hesitated when asked her name, and
finally gave it with that air that the hos
pital attaches have come to recognize as
marking an alias. "When asked the name
of the father of her child she was silent,
and the register shows a blank where the
name should appear.
She was reticent to all but one person
during her stay in the hospital, and that
person her nurse. Soon after the birth of
her baby she confided her troubles to her
attendant.
She was an orphan with practically no
relatives except an uncle who lives* in
Oakland. The greater part of her child
hood was spent at St. Joseph's Home and
when she was old enough she went out
to service. For a year or more prior to
her appearance at ' the hospital she had
worked in the family of three young men
and their sister, who were engaged in the
mercantile business in Hayes Valley. One
of the brothers accomplished her down
fall, but when disgrace threatened them
both he turned her adrift.
The story aroused the sympathies of the
nurse and she told several visitors of her
special interest in the mother and desire to
see the child in the care of a suitable
family. Among the visitors to the
maternity ward was Mrs. Annie E. Dooley-
Szanik, a professionaLnurse, who had done
considerable charitable work among the
slums. She became interested in the mother
-->.7Ttr- child - f:-.:a'Jy expressed her de
sire to adopt the little one. There was one
obstacle â her husband. Should she pro
pose the plan he would, in all probability,
veto it. But he would not be cruel enough
to send away an infant that found its way
to his doorstep, she reasoned. A well
meant conspiracy on the part of herself
and two hospital nurses, one of whom was
her niece, was the result.
Mrs. Szanik dictated a mournful little
note, in which a heartbroken mother, re
cently widowed, who claimed to be Mrs.
Szanik's friend and, former' patient, com
mitted the little one to her care. The note
was attached to the infant's clothing, and
one night the two nurses stole
to the doorstep, of Mrs. Szanik's
home, at 808 Bush , street, and de
posited a basket on the doorstep. The
parlor was lighted according to a previ
ously arranged signal, which showed that
Mrs. Szanik was waiting for her charge.
From the corner of Bush and Mason
streets they watched Mrs. Szanik as she
opened the door and witnessed her affected
surprise at the sight of, the contents of the
basket. Then they hurried back to the
hospital.
The mother had signed a document re
linquishing all right to the child, and bet
uncle had attached his name to the same.
When she â¢'vas well enough she left the
hospital and found work in a home where
lurked less danger. She is still at work at
that place and in ignorance of the where
abouts of the child.
Only once has the nurse seen her since,
and that was when the young mother
came to tell â â  her of a dream she had had
that her young infant was ill and her
" mother heart was wrung in fearful appre
hension. She was soothed by the assur
ance that the child was safe and well and
went away comforted.
A few days after the child was found
and Mrs. Szanik had gained a reluctant
consent from her husband to keep the
child, it was baptized at St. Peter's
Church, the nurse who had befriended the
mother acting as godmother. The little
one was christened Hazel Meade. Mrs.
Szanik was not satisfied, however, and
had the child rebaptized at the First Con
gregational Church, which she joined at
about the same time. This time the name
was changed to Ruth Dean.
The child grew to be a favorite with pas
tor and people, and .her bright little face
was missed when it was set toward Aus
tralia.
Mr. and Mrs. Szanik have separated. |
The former is living in this City. and. the j

MISS FRANK'S LECTURE.
She Speaks to a Large 'Audience and
Gives Her Ideas Concerning ..
Moses.
Miss Ray Frank lectured on "Moses" at
1820 Clay street yesterday afternoon. She
Â«n introduced by Rabbi Nieto.
"I have been asked," began the lecturer,
"to say what kind of Moses I intend to
picture, what I shall have to say about
him and from what standpoint. My only
answer to this has been: 1 will just
give a picture of my Moses. He is gleaned
from many books and manuscripts, but
for all that I am pleased to call him my
Moses.
"The account, as you know, comes from
the first five books of tne Bible, classified
under the generic term Pentateuch. He
was a prince, a metaphysician, a philoso
pher, a priest, a prophet, a martyr and a
universal genius. Every one holds within
himself to-day a fraction of all the various
qualities of Moses."
Then followed a lengthy discourse on
the qualities maniit-st in the great charac
ter of each of these roles.
Miss Frank said MoÂ«es was destined to
give to the world something, and that
something was law. Said the speaker:
"Law in the natural thingâ simple in its
operations, simple in its aspects, if we un
derstand it. It is a moving principle,
itself goinn on and on. Whatever gets in
front of that law. is molded by it. That is
the working of law in the natural world.
It has no reverence for what seemingly is
good and for what seemingly is bad. In
other words, we have out of this law the
survival of the fittest. In the days of
Moses men were molded by their environ
ments quite as well as they are to-day.
During patriarchal times men had a very
faint idea of God, but in Moses' day they
had come to look upon him as a jealous
God."
The lecture referred to the pre-eminent
genius of Moses, as illustrated by his
diplomacy in leading the children of
Israel out of the land of bondage, and
across the Red Sea into the wilderness,
which was followed by a vivid word picture
of the glories of Sinai, and the effect pro
duced on the Israelites at the sight of
Moses descending thence amidst thunder
and lightning, bearing the tables of the
law, that have molded th-j policy of na
tions, in his arms. Coming to the human
bide of his nature, she graphically por
trayed the results of his peevish eagerness
to supply the demand of the people, ar-J
the credit taken to himself in smiting the
rock to produce water instead of calling
upon it in the name of Yahveh, or Jeho
vah. "For this,' ! said Miss Frank, "he
was denied the happy culmination of his
hopesâ entering the promised land; but
there is something sublime in the forti
tude with which he resgned himself to the
will of God, trusting that he wouid in
Bonie way be rewarded for his labors."
A-< a political economist Miss Frank de
nominates the great man rescued from the
bulrushes by Pharaoh's daughter a mas
ter. She thinks that no Adam Smith,
John Stuart Mill, nor Henry George ever
suggested anything tending to the relief of
the poorer classes more than Moses' agra
rian law by which the rich were compelled
to sow :n the corners of their land as well
as in more accessible parts, but were or
dered* to let the poor reap in them. This
tended-, she thinks, to do away with the
self-debasement accompanying the accept
ance of alms.
IS GOING TO GERMANY
Claus Spreckels Will Leave Soon
to Investigate the Sugar
Industry.
WILL BE ABSENT SOME TIME.
He Intends to Foster Growing of Beets
in the San Joaquinâ lt Is a
Gigantic Business.
Claus Spreckela, who has many enter
prises on foot for the development of
California, will some time next month
leave for Europe. He is especially inter
ested in bringing more California land
under the production of suear-beets.
He believes that a Jarge part of the San
Joaquin Valley to be tapped by the Valley
road is especially adapted to raising sugar
beets, and that farmers, if they planted
them, would make a great deal of money.
Largely because of his convictions re
garding the ultimate future of the sugar
industry he is going to Germany to inves
tigate further regarding sugar-beets and
their product. It is his purpose to make
tbe industry one of the greatest, not only
in California, but in the whole of the
United States.
Mr. Spreckela has never failed in any of
his enterprises. He has made such a sig
nal success of the sugar business already
that it would seem that he had reached
the height of information concerning it.
He thinKs, however, his trip abroad will
be productive of results in this line that
will be of great value to the State. He
will stay abroad some time.
On his return he will begin work on his
sugar enterprises in the San Joaquin. Beet
growing and sugar-making are expected to
vie with the fruit and grain industry and
contribute vast wealth to that fertile
region of California.

PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF THE BEAUTIFUL IONIC STRUCTURE PROPOSED BY JAMES W. DUNCAN OF THIS CITY AS THE MAIN
BUILDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
Mr. Duncan was superintendent of construction of the present university buildings, and when these were being erected a large open space in the center of the grounds
was left for a handsome main hall or executive building. It is now Mr. Duncan's hope to superintend the construction of this new building, and to this end he has had these
plans prepared. The total length of the proposed building is 420 feet, with a depth, in the center, of 205 feet. Mr. Duncan's plan is to have the funds raised by private
donations, and to use Folsom granite in the construction. Should these plans be carried through successfully the University of California would undoubtedly have the most
magnificent college executive building in the world.

MRS. BARTON'S QUEER STORY.
The Robber Killed at the Franklin
House Identifiedâ New Light on
the Brown Scandal.
The wife of Evangelist J. D. Barton, in
telling the story of her wrongs last night
to a Call reporter, incidentally threw some
light on the identity of the burglar who
was killed in the Franklin residence seme
weeks ago.
AVhiJe the body was lying in the Morgue
with detectives in plain clothes on the
threshold watching ail visitors for any
signs of recognition, Evangelist Barton
and his 16-year-old-daughter Lizzie, who
had identified the dead man by the por
traits and descriptions in the newspa
pers, visited the Morgue, and were con
vinced beyond all doubt that the burglar
on the slab wss an acquaintance named
Bowditch or Bowdish, a Chinatown
gambler.
"When my husband left me the first
time three years ago he placed his daugh
ter with Bowditch and the woman who
was called his wife, on Union street, and
that's why they were able to identify him,"
said Mrs. Barton. "Bowditch left a wife
and five children in Topeka, Kansas."
This was the most sensational episode in
Mrs. Barton's story. Kext in point of
interest is her statement that her husband
remarked to her, after the First Congrega
tional Church scaridal got into the news
papers, that she could make $500 by repre
senting herself to De Jane Elizabeth Bad
din, the woman for whom Mrs. Davidson
claimed to be acting as agent when she
received $. r >oo from Dr. C. O. Brown. Mrs.
Barto*: continued:
"I told him that if there was $5000 or
$50,000 in it I would not swear falsely.
"After having left me three years ago
and remaining away in Fresno lor seven
months he came bact to me, and things
went along smoothly for a few weeks. I
bought him a shirt, an overcoat and some
other things. 1 don't think the overcoat
is paid for vet."
Kvangelist Barton skipped from home
the last time on the Ist of March, just a
month ago, for the purpose of spreading
the gospel among the heathen in the inte
rior. His wife said that when he left she
had two cents, two sacks of potatoes, one
can of corn and a can of tomatoes. Hejtold
the landlady that he was weil fixed for the
campaign, with two suits of clothes and
2HO acres of l?>iid.
"He lias not written to me nor given me
a cent since he has been gone," continued
his wife, "and I have been obliged to go
out and do housework to support myself.
It's nothing new, because I had to "work
the same way when he was with me."
Mrs. Barton is a Swedish woman, and
looks us though she had worked hard all
her life. She was a Salvation Army lassie
in San Diego five years ago, and being
ordered to Los Angeles tUere met John D.
Barton, who was leading a checkered ex
istence between carpentering and preach
ing.
The Salvation Army lassie married the
carpenter-evangelist and all went well for
about two years when he left his wife and
took bis 13-yeai-old daughter Lizzie with
him. Some time last year Barton made
the acquaintance of a pious widow named
Minnie Sbule, who had received $2000 in
surance money by the death of her hus
band.
The widow, who had been connected with
the Salvation Army, was a frequent visitor
and took great interest in evangelical
work. She left the City at about the same
time that Mr. Barton did.
Mrs. Barton is very much worried over
the fact that Barton left several unpaid
grocery and other bills. There is also a $12
clock missing, for which Mrs. Barton paid
installments of 50 cents per week.
Rev. W. N. Meserve, pastor of the Union
square Free Baptist Church, told what ho
knew about Mr. Barton. He was employed
by a certain number of the congregation
for street work, Barton being; a lusty
shouter of hymns, ana a kind of collar-and
elbow open-air exhorter of the unregener
ate. He got out flaming circulars and had
"John D. Barton, evangelist," painted in
big letters on a white cloth tacked up an
the church wall. The following is a copy
of the circulars:

Evangelists J. I). BAKTON and K. JL. GAUTHIEH.
"F. L. Gauthier, the partner of Barton,
was elevator man in the Murphy build
ing," said Pastor Meserve. "The two of
them got a contract for phingling this
church and putting in new wooden foun
dations. The work was not at all satisfac
tory, but the church paid the money
rather than have any trouble or fuss about
it."
That was all that the pastor knew of
John D. Barton. The evangelist is still
engaged in feeding sinners with the bread
of eternal life and turning his pwn bread
and butter by the music of his pious chin,
while his wife has to go out early every
morning cleaning windows, scrubbing
floors and tending children to earn her
living.
BARTON'S TALE.
Ho Accuses His Wife of Conspiring
Against Dr. Brownâ His Santa
Rosa Reception.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 30.â Several
weeks ago John D. Barton, accompanied
by two men and one or two women, came
â¢ to Santa Rosa and began a revival service.
They occupied a tent at the corner of
Washington and Fourth streets. Yester
day the tent was removed, and the re
vivalists are holding Lightly services in a
building on B street. In an interview
with a Call correspondent Sir. Barton
said:
The attack upon us by this man Lemmon of
the Republican is unwarranted and unjust.
There is uo truth in the statement that we are
trying to obtain money under the pretense of
aiding destitute people. We have uided many
people here, but respect their natural scruples
of having their names published to the world.
For this reason Lemincm saw fit to attack us in
his sheet. As for the woman who calls herself
my wife in San Francisco, I no longer own her
for a wife.
We were married by Justice Wood in Port
land, Or., In 1801, and two hours afterward
my newly wedded wife went to General George
Williams, borrowed $3(3 and left town.
I am a carpenter aud builder by trade, but
was engaged in Portland in detective work. I
closed up my office and came to San Francisco
to find my wife. I found her at Mrs. Miller's
at 3300 Clay street, or near there. For Jive
years she spent every cent I earned and made
my life miserable. She beat my 10-year-old
daughter and kept me in hot water continu
ally. One-day a man came to the house and
demanded $50 of her. She had him put out of
tbe house and they ended tne fight in the
street. I found that this man was one of her
former husbands. Why, she has had six dif
ferent husbands.
Shortly after this I was told by Emma Mitch
eleroflÃo7 Mission street some of my wife's
former history. She u->ed to work for a man
named Redwine on Jackson and Sansomc
street*. They kept a lodging-house and she
beat him out of it. She went to Los Angeles,
where she married a man named Perry. Then
she married a man at Fort Douglass named
Hyman. After this she married a man nanu'd
Jordion and 1 think they lived at IHO7 Mission
street with Mrs. Murphy.
My wife whs thick with Mrs. Tunnell when
we lived at 15J.-.,' Oak Grove avenue and it was
there that the job was put up on the Rev. C.
O. Brown. Mrs. Tunnell gave my wife a house
and lot, which 1 suppose was her share of the
plunder. She left my house at l<i Fell place
about January 1, 1890. aud about a week after
I followed. 1 only took a few bedclothes and
my personal effects. I made her a present of
all of the household goods and am willing to
support her, but not to live with her, provided
of course that she can prove to me that some of
these stories are false and that she will live a
decent life.
As for me running away with Minnie Soule,
that is untrue. I met Minnie Soule shortly
after her husband, Mr. Andrews, killed him
self last Christinas, and she requested thut 1
should assist her in getting a life insurance pol
icy dished. I took her to my lawyer, Mr. Coll
ye'r. whose office is at 14 McAllister street, and
lie will bear me out in nil I suy.
My wife thought she could get some of my
property in Portland, but 1 was too smart for
her and the detectives she hounded me with.
Being a detective myself they found It very
hard to shadow me.
Minnie Soule has never been in Santa Rosa.
The lady who has been with us is Mrs. Harriet
Avers, a noble woman, who is barking our
efforts to raise the fallen and establish a rescue
home. We have saved twenty souls already,
and with God's help will save many more. My
uncle, Barton, is now at the Palace Hotel in San
Francisco, and- I have sent Mrs. Ayers to him
for.: mo. icy to keep 'up the good work; ; We
have purchased â  a piece of property; and one
of Santa Rosa's noble citizens has donated a
six-room house. God will show us a way to
surai.li it. â¢Â»Â«.<! lal'i wnrtV'O . cari* find a<i
cordial a welcome there as any Christian
woman in the land. *>' . - ;_
11' my ex- wife stirs me up I will send her to
âto cool off. lama very quiet man till you
ruffle my feathers the wrong way, then I put
up the bars. y. ,
Before the meeting was over the preacher
informed his audience 1 that he had : just
received news from San Francisco which
compelled him to bid them all a farewell
forever. That he would take the first train
for San Francisco' in the morning, and
asked the prayers of all of ; his , hearers.
He said that he had hoped to make Santa
Rosa < his home, but that business of im
portance called ; him away. ;He promised
to send a good man in his place.
WINDOWS TO SHOW AT NIGHT.
Arc Lights Will Be Placed in St. Igna
tius Church.
A prominent electric light and power
firm has recently been making prepera
tionÃ to place arc lights behind the
windows of St. Ignatius Church in order
to show the figures thereon at night
Preparations were completed last evening,
and the lights were turned on, throwing
the coloring and figures of the windows
into bold reliel.
There are twenty-four windows in the
church, aggregating in cost $30,000. Four
of these are id front. The others extend
along the sides, and are bounded on the
outward side by small chapels.
At night the beauty of these windows has
been obscured by the feeble light. Eight
arc lights were placed in each of these
chapels and two in each of the small
rooms containing the windows which are
over the altar. Large pieces of tin were
used as reflectors. Powerful reflectors
Will be used instead ot the tin, and the
current, which is now attached to the.
regular 12 o'clock wires, -w'll be supplied
with a switch, making the arrangement
complete.
Charged With Burglary.
Charles Gross, a butcher, was arrested yester
day by Policeman T. L. Ryan on the charge of
burglary. He broke Into the house of John
Holy, 430 Tehama street, a few nights ago and
stole $10. Entrance was effected by forcing
open a window.
HALF A BLOCK
FALLS IN FLAMES
Oakland Is Visited by Fire
in the Stormy
- Night.
MILLS AND HOUSES LOST
Two Firemen Seriously Injured
While Fighting the
Blazes.
BURNING BRANDS TAKE WING.
Only With Great Difficulty Was the
Fire Confined to a Water-
Front Block.
Oakland Oefice San Francisco Call,)
!X)8 Broadway, March 30. j
The eas^ half of the block bounded by
First and Water, Broadway and Wash
ington streets was destroyed by fire to
night. The flames were lirst discovered
near the engine-room of the Pioneer Plan
mg-mill owned by T. L. Hierlihy.
The first alarm was not turned in five
minutes before it was seen that the high
wind prevailing had made certain the de
struction of all property east to Broad
way. A general alarm was sounded and
by the time the whole department was on
hand the flames had spread to an adjoin
ing lumber-yard. Large pieces of burning
wood were carried across to the west side of
Broadway, and two chemical engines were
detailed to put out the fires there as fast
as buildings began to blaze.
Twenty minutes after the alarm was
given the iiames were mounting high in
the air ana the fresh breeze spread them
with fearful rapidity. It was evident that
nothing could be done by fighting the fire
from the windward side, so Chief Fair
drew all his men to the Water-street and
Broadway sides of the doomed block and
prevented the fire from crossing either
street, and confined it to the block where
it started.
After sweeping through the Pioneer
Planing-millÃ the flames enveloped
Spencer's Feedmill and in ten minutes it
was a mass of flame. The wind carried
the flames southward and the American
Boiler Works were soon a blazing mass.
Next to feed the hungry flames was the
Cottage Restaurant. This frame building
did not stop the progress of the fire long
and the adjoining saloon and cigar-store
were soon absorbed. At the back of these
small structures is Taylor's lumber-yard.
The lumber is stacked high across Water
street and it was not till the fire reached
the solid piles of lumber that >ts progress
was stayed.
- The ; ferry steamer Alameda that plies
on the creek route was in her slip just on
the south side of the lumber, and she was
111 aangev- uf - inning Hi'" iivÂ»mj, - m i:i'..
showers of sparks tuat fell on her decks.
A stream was played on' the decks and the
watchman pulled 'i the r steam-whistle, and
did not cease till the engineer arrived and
the boat was moved to a place of safety. .
By half-past 8 the fire was under control.
The destroyed buildings were :â¢: two-story
frame structures and very old.
T. J. Sheehan, a fireman, fell off a lum
ber pile and hurt his head, causing slight
concussion of the brain, and he also
sprained his left hand. H. C. Yorke, an
other fireman, was badly injured on one
foot by a glass insulator that fell from a
burning telegraph pole. No other acci
dents were reported.
The Cottage Restaurant was conducted
by Mrs. Eliza Dubois, who lost all her fur
niture. The saloon was the joint property
of H. Coppers and Joe Cooper, and the
cigar-store was run by Henry Branton, ail
of whom lost all the stock and furniture.
The whole of the destroyed property was
insured, and it is estimated that the dam
age will not exceed $15,000, The property
was all classed as high risks and the
premium was as high as 9 and 10 per
cent.
There were two other small fires during
the day and early this morning. The old
Reinhardt place on Lake Shore avenue,
near the boulevard, now owned by Mrs.
Sarah Coiners, was destroyed by fire. The
origin of the fire is a mystery, but it is
supposed that tramps caused it by the
careless use of matches. J. J. Mulgrew of
the Brooklyn engine company was se
verely burned about the head and hands
by an explosion of gas when the water
was turned on the coal in the cellar. Fire
man Stokes was slightly burned at the
same time.
Held for Murder.
Lang Quong was yesterday held to answer,
before the Superior Court by Judge Conlan
without bopds on the charge of murder. Some
months ago during the trouble among the Six
Companies Quong fatally shot another Chinese
in Sulliva 1 alley.

TO RAISE THE MORTGAGE
Y. M. C. A. Directors Hold
a Meeting and Invite
Subscriptions.
Chauncey M. Depew to Be Requested
to Lecture Under Associa
tion Auspices.
The board of trustees and directors of
the Y. M. C. A. h;;ld a very enthusiastic
meeting at the Y. M. C. A. building, cor
ner of Mason and EIII9 streets, last even
ine, C. S. Wright, vice-president of the as
sociation, in the chair.
The amount of $5000 in new subscrip
tions "was reported, which brought the
total up to $83,000, leaving a balance of
$12,000 to be raised in order to reach the
$100,000 mark started for six months ago.
The committee unanimously decided to
put forth a special effort immediately to
secure the balance of the subscriptions
this week if possible, and several of the
leading merchants will be called upon to
make up this amount.
The following gentlemen were appointed
a committee on the canvass: W. F. Whit
tier, John F. Merrill. Edward Coleman,
Thomas Maeee, J. Dempster McKee, N. P.
Romaine, Monroe Greenwood and C. It.
Bishop.
Every pledge is made on condition that
$100,000 be subscribed, and of the $88,000
already subscribed the trustees themselves
have listed their names for over $40,000.
The largest amount subscribed so iar by
one person is $(3000. There are eleven
$5000 subscriptions and several in the sum
of $1000.
Said Secretary McCoy: "This building
is one of the most complete and extensive
of its kind in the world, and there is no
doubt that tho sum will be raised this
week. The lot was incumbered when it
was bought, and the mortgage is not in
the name of the Y. M. C. A. If this
amount is raised it will wipe out the mort
gage completely."
It was also decided to invite Chauncey
Depew to deliver an address under the
auspices of the association during his stay
in this City. A special reception commit
tee consisting of Henry E. Huntingdon,
W. F. Whittier, W illiam li. Crocker, Kolla
V. Watt and H. P. McCoy was appointed.
Letter-Writing for Busy People.
"One of the best of all times to hold im
aginary, conversation with absent; friends
is 'when one is doing work commonly
called tedious, because it is almost purely
mechanical,'' writes Emma M. Hale
in an article -on "Letter -writing :. for
Busy " People," in April Ladies' J
Home Journal. "When one's fingers
i are ; occupied .and the v conscience is
easy, your thoughts should be at their
brightest. I have never seen any incon
sistency in reading a chapter from Her
bert" Spencer in the evening and thinking
it over next day while paring ; potatoes for
dinner. * * Letters/writing may be the : ,
only literary work you ever do, so do not
be \ afraid V of obey i one .or two ' funda
mental rules necessary to success. â¢_ It is
well known that the best } things you read

printed page; but I have premised that I
you have only time to write your letters
once, so ; try. the plan of having l good,

that you have no longer cause for thoughts
