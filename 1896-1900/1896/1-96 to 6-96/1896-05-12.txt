MEETING OF THE NEW CORTES
la F^rson the Queen Regent Presents
an Interesting Speech From
the Throne.
Â£ WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.â While
the suspension of the sentence of death
in the case of the convicted Americans
who were captured aboard of the alleged
filibuster Competitor has allayed for the
time being public interest in the matter,
it is believed by many conservative men
in Congress that the situation is critical.
It is not so much the decision reached by
the Spanish court as it is the ruethoas
which were employed in doing so that is
provocative of ill feeling.
A prominent member of the House Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs, when asked to
day by a correspondent whether there was
any likelihood that Senator Morgan's
joint resolution authorizing the President
to take action looking to the recognition
of the belligerency of the Cuban insur-
gents would pass at this session, replied:
"It may be, but it is not improbable
that some action even more vigorous than
that may be required of Congress."
â¢'Adjournment is not very far off," it
was suggested, "and whatever action Con
gress may take will have to be taken
soon."
"Adjournment has not vet been decided
upon," was the reply. "We may adjourn
before the Ist of June, and we may be
here all summer. I have believed
that the President would take some
decisive action in the Cuban matter
as soon as he could receive full and
accurate information upon the subject,
and it would not surprise me if that action
should be taken very soon. My opinion
is that the crisis will be reached in a short
time, perhaps in a few days. If Spain
should decide to permit the execution of
the sentence of death passed by General
Weyler's court-martial on the Competitor
prisoners who are American citizens a most
serious situation wiil result."
While tho opinion of the member re
ferred to is not generally shared by a
majority of the House members, it is
thought that if the Competitor prisoners
are shot, as Weyler insists they must be,
Congress will beyond doubt take some de
cisive action. Mr. Cleveland will then be
forced to act
QUEEN RAGENT`S SPEECH.
Before the Cortes fih* Predicts the Failure
of the Rebellion.
MADRID, Spain, May 11.â The new
Cortes met to-day. Great interest was
manifested in the speech from the throne
ODening the session, which it was known
would deal at length with the situation in
Cuba. The speech was read in person by
the Queen Regent, representing the youth
ful King. Her Majesty said:
Senators and Deputies: Heavy preoccupa
tions lay on my mind on addressing you on
this day of the opening of the session of the
cortes. All of you share Trith me those pre
occupations, as I am sure they are shared
by the nation. You cannot have forgotten
those days, rich in hopes, of February and
March of last year, when the legislative bodies
approved the laws to reconstruct the adminis
tration of Cuba and Porto Rico.
To their enforcement the representatives of
the loyal parties of Cuba and Forto Rico
pledged themselves and those who share the
power in the peninsula, but those good inten
tions were counteracted on the 21st of Febru
ary, when the discussion had not yet begun,
by the discovery of the Governor-General of
Cuba of symptoms of rebellion, and three days
later it was necessary to proclaim martial law.

[Sketched by a "Call" staff artist at Sacramento yesterday.]
The San Francisco Call.
It was most plain that the announcement of
reforms, applauded unanimously by the Lib
eral party, far from restraining the secession
ists, gave them impulse to resort to arms with
the intentiou of preventing the application of
the reforms. From the first moment that was
understood by the illustrious general to whom
the pacification of the territory was entrusted.
The same declaration was made to his Gov
ernment by the agent of the Uuited States, who
said that the revolutionist;--, seeing in the re
forms great advantage to their country, quick
ened the movement in order to prevent their
aspiration of creating au independent state
becoming impaired.
The rebel chiefs, principally the foreigners
and the colored, did not wait long to say that
they did not attach importance to political,
economical or administrative reforms, no mat
ter how liberal, even the most extended form
of home rule, if they had to submit to the
sovereignty of Spain, and the good and pros
perity of the Cubans was nothing to them.
On the contrary that class of revolutionists
showed themselves tne encouragers of the
groups of bandits that formed the nucleus of
their forces, destroying private property, burn
ing towns without defense and making public
that they will destroy the island if they are
unable to conquer the public power, and that
they will thereafter dispute with arms in hand
eternally.
What the consequence would be of the sub
stitution of sovereignty of Spain over races
nearly balanced and with irreconcilable char
acter there is no statesman who will not fore
see. The final result would be that Cuba would
make a step backward in civilization. It
would be an error to imagine that the interests
of the country could in such conditions pros
per or continue in existence.
The Spanish nation in the meantime is not
going to be indifferent to the future of those
of her sons misguided by improvident polit
ical ambitions, and she will not abandon
the mission of civilization that she has
taken upon herself and that she has up
to the moment accomplished and her history
and honor impose upon her; much less will
she deny the rights and advantages demanded
with reason by those inhaDitants of the An
tilles who, torming the different political
parties, have indignantly condemned the in
surrection from the first moment, being
morally and materially by the side of the me
tropolis, and have shed their blood for her.
There are also many who only by fear have
joined the rebels, and who are beginning to
profit by the facilities afforded them by the
state of demoralization of the insur
rection to come under the nation's
flag, and there will not be before
long many who, convinced of the impotence
of their efforts to suppress the sovereignty
of Spain, but will return with a peaceful
spirit to their homes to become good citizens.
To them Spain will always extend her open
arms, after her dignity and authority are safe,
for the maintenance ol which she has made
and will repeat when necessary sacrifices
which have not been equaled.
In the meantime it is not just to suppose
that the present Government has not enforced
the reforms for a lack of love for them. He
(the King) has had in their enactment as great
a share as any other. In the first instance it is
to be noted that it was not possible to do this
without profound study and preparation, be
cause it completely changed all the laws in
force.
I On the other hand, the rapid spread of the
; insurrection, long in preparation, in spite of
| Spain, having restored and increased in a mar-
I velous way in Cuba, the production destroyed
j by the past war very soon broke the unanimity
I of sentiment with which the law of the 15th
of March, 1895, had been approved.
That was first demanded by the more ad
vanced of the Cuban political parties, which
i had given its votes in the Cortes and which
I presented first to the Governor-General and
! afterward to the Madrid Government a plan
! of considerable modification to the reforms,
1 as if their spirit of action was not more the
; same than before the war.
The -ame thing was made public by a politi
cal group, which called itself Reformist, pre
senting to the Government in Madrid a project
i of Congress of great importance also, and the
j late chief of the said group declared that the
1 application of the reforms voted was incom
j patible with the state of rebellion.
Finally, the worthy general that governs
Cuba, disposed, as his predecessor always did,
to obey all the orders of the Government, is
also convinced, as the Cuban conservatives
are. that the indorsement of reform laws which
i have been promulgated, far from serving to
bring peace, wilj make it more difficult.
From all this It is deduced that those re
forms, not satisfying anybody, for the future
their immediate application, even if it were
possible to enforce them completely, will not
obtain a good result with a direct application
of them.
Even their enforced essay in Porto Rico, as
they are all destined to a great modification
in a short time, will not probably bring benefit
because of the advantages that can be ex
pected from a new project. Not for that has the
Government abandoned, nor will she abandon,
the general study of future legislation for the
Antilles, for the moment that after a new in
tervention by the Cortes and when the oppor
tunity will arrive they would have to be
definitely established. Fortunately the insur
rection Is decreasing, in the opinion of su
perior authority of the island and of the per
sons who can in Cuba judge with greater cer
tainty.
If it has not yet decreased completely it is
due principally, as nobody can ignore, to the
great and frequent helps received, false de
scriptions of the politic and administra
tive situation in Cuba, making them also
believe that the conduct of destroying
what they are unable to conquer, Is identical
to those that with higher ends, with different
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, MAY 12, 1896.
Some of the Prominent Delegates From Town and Country Attending the People's Party
Convention Now in Session at Sacramento.
[from characteristic sfietelHU made by a "Call" staff artist at bucramento yratcntay]
means and with the reasonable probabilities
of creating a new civilized nation, use methods
which have been practiced at other times in
America and in Europe.
Even that help would not be sufficient to
prolong the contest if it had not been for the
chimerical hopes spread among the in
surgents that a great nation will take a hand
in their Illegitimate and powerless revolution,
with manliest violation of the public rights.
For that reason every disappointment that
the separatists receive regarding that will soon
(serve more efficiently than anything else to the
re-establishment of peace. It it to be hoped
that they will now suffer disappoint
ment because of the fact, better known every
day, that makes it clear to all honest minds
that Spain is far from desiring her Antillean
subjects to live under an old and antiquated
regime when she enjoys such liberal laws.
Without the separatist conspiracy Spain
would never have refused any legitimate lib
erty. A great assimilation to the legislation
of the peninsula that many will find to be
lacking In the Antilles never has found great
difficulties in the Government, and to have re
corded it resulted greatly from the dislikes of
many to the assimilation and their preference
towards special laws.
When peace will be reached, to consolidate
it it will be necessary to give to both islands,
Cuba and Porto Rico, an economical and ad
ministrative personality, with a character ex
clusively local, but that will make possible the
total intervention of the country in its pecu
liar affairs, while remaining untouched the
right of sovereignty and untouched the neces
sary conditions for its existence.
To that end will the Government bind its
steps, if that line of policy merits the ap
proval of the Cortes. Of the loyalty of such
purposes, to-day exposed before the whole
world, nobody is permitted to doubt, and it Is
not to be disputed, although a different thing
is pretended with mean reflections that Spain
has fulfilled with excess and in all really es
sentials, everything that was offered in the
capitulation of Zanjon.
On you, Senores Senadors and Diputados, de
volves now to encourage or restrain the policy
signaled by my Government or to show him
different ways. Undoubtedly the interests of
the country imperatively demand that the Gov
ernment will be authorized to profit, as it will
be convenient by the circumstances with the
aim of putting an end in a short time to the
present situation, and with that object pro
jects of law will be presented to you which
you will accept, amend or reject according to
the dictates of your consciences.
I have the greatest satisfaction In informing
you that we maintain excellent and cordial re
lations with all the powers.
The correct and friendly conduct of the
American republic in the Cuban matter is a
good proof that every day the ties of interest
are developed, r. nd the friendship that unites
them closer with Spain. In the United
States, notwithstanding the great efforts
that a part of the public opinion has suc
ceeded in making in a contrary sense, the
President and his Government have not de
parted from the line of conduct that corre
sponds to the loyal friendship that has existed
between the countries from the beginning of
the existence of that republic. The Govern
ment will report to the Cortes the treaty of
peace and friendship negotiated with the re
public of Honduras. .
The remainder of the address is devoted
to the reports of different departments.
WEYLER BAS RESIGNED
But the Spanish Government Orders
Him to Kemnin.
HAVANA, Cuba, May 11.â The report
that General Weyler has resigned because
of the action of the home Government in
the case of the Competitor filibusters is
true, but it is not accepted with confidence
by the public here.
It is understood that the Government
refused to accept the resignation and
ordered General Weyler to remain at his
post under the present circumstances.

eral Conference, to-night. ''The people

ECKELS AS A PEACEMAKER.
Sent to JlUnoi* in the Interest of Sound-
Mown Men.
CHICAGO, 111., May 11.â James H.
Eckels, Comptroller of the Currency, ar
rived in this city to-day from Washington
as the personal representative of the Pres
ident on a tour of information-seeking and
as a peacemaker between the fighting fac
tions of Illinois and the Cook County De
mocracy in the interest of a gold standard.
His arrival and the secret conferences he
held during the day with the sound-money
leaders formed the sole topic of conversa
tion in Democratic political circles at local
and State Headquarters.
The Comptroller is generally credited
with the mission of ascertaining the exact
situation in certain Western States, with
the special object of doing all he can to
have anti-free silver delegation sent by the
Illinois convention to Chicago in July.
As a result of the conference, which will
be continued to-morrow, it is said the
sound-money men of this city will cease
attacking or even opposing Governor Alt
geld for renomination, and confine their
campaign exclusively to prevent Illinois
being put in the silver column at the Na
tional Convention.
The danger of the party in thia State be
ing permanently split on the money ques
tion, with two State conventions, a contest
and a possible bolt at the National Conven
tion, is also given a moving cause for an
aggressive policy of the present adminia
tration people, including the Illinois office
holders.
The visit of the Comptroller, it is re
ported, was hastened by telegrams sent to
Washington after the sound-money lead
ers had conferred with Chairman Harrity
of the National Committee last week on
the completed party here.
The Altgeld Democrats are arranging
for a big demonstration Saturday, the
Governor being the chief attraction.
POINTERS FOR THE PRESS.

LOGANSPORT, Ind., May 11.â S. P.
Sherin, secretary of the Democratic Na
tional Committee and chairman of the
sub-committee on press and telegraphic
accommodations and facilities for the
Democratic National Convention, to be
held in Chicago July 7, requests the
United Press to announce that it is desir
able that the applications for space for
working reporters and correspondents in
the convention ball be made with the least
possible delay. No application for work
ing space filed later than June 15 will be
considered. All applications for press and
telegraphic accommodations should be ad

SUPREME COUNCIL A. P. A.
There ITill Be a Fight Over the Report on
McKinley.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11. â The
delegates to the meeting of the Supreme
Council of the American Protective Asso
ciation are nearly all in the city. The
meeting will be railed to order behind
closed doors at 10 o'clock to-morrow. The
first day*9 session will be devoted to or
ganization and routine work. The con
vention is expected to be in session five or
six days, and nearly the last work will be
the election of officers. There will be a
stubborn fight over the report of the ad
visory council against McKinley.
Two committees held meetings to-day.
They were the judiciary and executive
committees. The judiciary committee is
composed of the lawyers, and Judge Ste
venson is chairman of it John W. Echols
of Georgia and H. W. Smith of California
were appointed members of the committee
by President Tray nor.
The executive committee meeting was
for the purpose of looking into the repre
sentatives of the different offices.
POLITICS IN COLORADO.
One Convention Presided Over by a
Woman of Grit,
DENVER, Colo., May 11.â The Repub
lican County Convention called to meet
to-day to select delegates to the State and
Congressional conventions, for the purpose
of selecting delegates to the National Con
vention, failed to become even temporarily
organized at a late hour to-night. This
delay was due to a factional contest for
control and the stanch determination of
Mrs. W. H. Kisler, the county chairman,
to stick to her rulings in spite of the howl
ing of ward heelers and the bulldozing tac
tics of some of the delegates to gain their
points.
It has been developed that Senator
Teller will be sent to St. Louis at the head
of a delegation composed of loyal follow
ers, and tuat Senator Wolcott will not be
of that delegation. His friends now ask
only that a vote of censure be not passed.
This action is almost a unanimous de
mand of the members of the party and
will be taken to prevent the defeat of local
tickets, both county and State, next fall.
The contest to-day is waged for local con
trol in both county and State organiza
tions and is extrf mely bitter. The lady
who is chairman ofjthe County Committee
has ruled against a party rule relating to
the making up of a temporary roli of dele
gates as prepared by the County Central
Committee, both in the meetings of the
committee aud in the opening of the ,
County Convention, her position being
that the rule is wrong and unjust and
should not stand, though a large majority
of the County Committee voted against
her.
The rollcail of uncon tested delegates re
sulted in sustaining tne appeal from the
decision of Mis. Kisler, chairman, and the
delegates proceeded to effect the tem
porary organization by placing J. H. Sbat
tuck in the chair without opposition.
Committees were named and a recess taken
until 10 o'clock to-night.
The gang wins and Mayor McMurray's
following, known as the anti-combine, is
defeated.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.â Senator
Teller of Colorado to-day sent the follow
ing letter to the chairman of the Colorado
State Committee. It is self-explanatory:
Hon. Irving Hobart, Colorado Springs- I wish
to say to the State Convention, through you,
that I do not desire to go to the National Con
vention and I cannot go unless the State Con
vention is in accord with my ideas in declaring
that in the coming campaign the silver ques
tion is the paramount issue. The State Con
vention should act with the full knowledge
that 1 do not intend to support a candidate on
a gold-standard platform or on a platform of
doubtful construction. If this course puts me
out of sympathy with the Republican senti
ment of the State, as a portion of the Republi
can party alleges it will, I accept the result
with all its logical consequences in preference
to an abandonment of principles and stulti
fication of my record made, as I conceive, un
der the instructions ol every Republisan con
vention held In Colorado during the last
twelve years.

CATOR FOR THE SENATORSHIP-
Faithful Services to the Party Will
Be Recognized by the Con
vention.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 11.âDele
gates to the Populist State Conve ntion
come pouring into the State House by all
the afternoon and evening trains, and at
night the lobbies, parlors and office of the
hotel presented much of the bustle ob
servable of the night before the conven
tion of one of the old parties, only that
the push and the pull were absent, or if
present, were of a different kind from the
usual staple article.
All parts of the State are well repre
sented; the man from the shadow of
Shasta's snowy peak is here, but T. W. H.
Shanahan, Shasta'? tall sycamore, is miss
ing. His long shadow is not seen on the
floor under the glare of the electric lamps,
and a mighty voice, which once sounded
stridently the blood-curdling war whoop
of Tammany in the councils of the
Democracy, will not be heard even for the
first time in a Populist State Convention.
Mr. Shanahan sent word that it would
be impossible for him to attend, owing to
the pressure of important law matters con
fided to his charge. But there are other
men from Shasta and San Diego and the
smiling valleys and green hills that lie
between.
There will be a lively fight for the chair
manship to-morrow, among the four or
five contestants, Barlow of San Lui3
Obispo being in the lead.
Notwithstanding the secret but desper
ate efforts of Democratic bosses in San
Francisco, through friends and agents in
this convention, to defeat T. V. Cator by
omitting from the order of business the
nomination of a United States Senator,
that gentleman will be nominated by ac
clamation, or, at least, by an overwhelm'
ing majority.
His services to the party have been so
valuable in the past, his devotion to the
Omaha platform has been so intense in
season and out of season that the conven
tion will be repaying in part the debt of
gratitude which they owe him, if a man
can be saill to be entitled to any gratitude
merely for doing his duty and remaining
true to his trust.
The secret efforts which Have been made
to defeat him and which have fallen to the
ground have been instigated by Demo
cratic influence, which, working in the
dark and devious ways of Tammany and
Iroquois tribes, have been plotting for
weeks past to bring about a fusion of the
Populist and Democratic tickets, the
offices to be divided in such a way that
the more important ones would go to the
Democrats. Hence their enmity to the
champions of the no-fusion cause. A
prominent Populist said of Cator to-night:
"Some people don't like Mr. Cator, per
haps for personal, political or business
reasons, but I can say that tnere is no
other man in the party witn a fidelity so
unswerving to the principles of Populism
than Cator. He has always opposed any
scheme looking to the abandonment of the
principles of the party by even so much
as a hair's breadth, and that's the kind of
men who will make the Populist cause the
winning one.
"He is also fearless and outspoken on all
subjects, is a good lawyer, a good talker
and a man of commanding presence.
There will be no fusion, and the Demo
cratic jobbers will be disappointed."
Taylor Rodgers and a delegation of2
woman suffragists and Mrs. T. V. Cator, a
woman delegate from San Francisco, ar
rived to-day. Among the delegation were
Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. A. A. Sar
gent and Mrs. Ida JL. Harper.
They came not because they had any
doubt that a worhan -suffrage plank would
be inserted" in the State platform, but be
cause it was required of them as a matter
ot courtesy that they should attend the
convention. F^r a like reason they will
appear before the Prohibition Convention,
which will meet in Stockton at the latter
end of this week.
Mr. Rodgers is a delegate and will in
cidentally look after Mayor Sutro's fight
for Congress. Several of the delegates
said to-night that they did not think that
Sutro would get anything at the hands of
the convention because he was a railroad
man himself and a money-maker in capi
talistic enterprises and that therefore he
would not be at home in a Populistic
environment.
The convention will be called to order at
10 o'clock to-morrow in the Assembly
Chamber, and it is now expected there
will be a two days' session. Words of
etrong commendation are heard on every
fide for the local committee of arrange
ments for its preparations for the conven
tion. The composition of the committee
is as follows: L. M. Landsborough, W. T.
Hamilton, W. J. Elder, J. Camp and T.
McMillan. _
FUSION NOT LIKELY.
California Populists More Willing to Go
Down Among the Breakers Than
Sacrifice Principle.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 11.â Among
the best known leaders of the party here
is M. W. Wiikzns of San Jose. Mr. Wil
kins is editor of the Populist organ, New
Charter, and is the head of the anti-fusion
element.
"There will be no fusion," he said to a
Call reporter this afternoon. "Nationally
1 don't believe that there will be a silver
convention to fuse with, and the indica
tions are that there will be a siiver ticket
in the field put in by bolting Democrats,
to which the fusion members will flock.
Leading silver men, such as Bartine and
Warner, say that the permanency of the
silver party will depend upon what the
old parties do. The California Populists
will be in the middle of the mad with a
platform as radical as the Omaha plat
forn. and perhaps more so."
Mr. Wilkins reiterated that the Popu
lists wanted no fusion. They will depend
upon their own resources. He found that
the feeling in the party against fusion
was growing stronger and stronger every
day. But while there is a deep-seated
prejudice against fusion the party would
not object to a union of forces at St. .Louis
if there is anything to unite. The dis
tinction between fusion and union as made
by Mr. Wilkins is that fusion is an ar
rangement between two parties standing
upon separate platforms and dividing the
offices on the ticket, half to one party and
half to the other. Union means a joining
together of men or parties and under a
common platform and with only one set
of candidates forming one party. If there
should be a Â«ilver convention in St. Louis
and the silverites and Populists should
uuite upon the same platform and on the
same candidates tnere would oe no objec
tion and there would not be any inconsis-
tency in that proceeding, provided that
the Populists would not be required to
compromise any of the fundamental prin
ciples of their platform. California Popu
lists are essentially and emphatically op
posed to any sacrifice of principle, and
rather than do so they would be willing to
go down among the breakers.
Speaking of the advance of the party
and the growing popularity of radicalism
Mr. Wilkins said that under the radical
platform of 1894 the Populist gained an
average of 116 per cent of votes in this
State. He quoted the New York World's
article of two or three weeks ago giving
the fact* relating to the increase in the
Populist vote and stating that if populism
had shown no increase from 1892 to 1894
there might be reason to believe that the
party had died, but the New York World's
figures show an increase of 600,000. The
increase in California was 29,000 on an
average from 1892 to 1894. There have
polled as high as 68,000 votes in this State.
The average in this State for 1892 was
25,502 votes for Weaver and in 1894 the
number had increased to 54,000.
AFTER THE SENATORSHIP.
Thomas V. Cator Talks About the
Strides Made by Populists In
Many States.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 11.â As
usual the big gun of the convention is
Thomas V. Cator of San Francisco, the
candidate for the nomination for the
United States senatorship of California.
He is confident that he will receive the
nomination at the hands of hi 3 party.
The nomination will mean that he
is the choice of the party, and
it will pledge the Populist Btate Sen
ators and Assemblymen to vote for him.
Contrary to the general understanding of
the matter, the nomination of a United
States Senator directly by a political party
is not an innovation. In the great contest
in Illinois between Lincoln and Douglas
in 1858 for the United States Senate they
were nominated by the State conventions.
A more recent instance is the nomination
of Foraker of Ohio by the Republican
State Convention of Ohio.
Mr. Cator is a strong anti-fasionist, and
he says that this feeling against going in
partnership with any other party has been
produced by the bitter experience of the
past, when Marion Cannon (Populist) was
elected to Congress on a fusion ticket, and
when he pulled down an Assemblyman
from bis allegiance to the party and threw
the principles of Populism to the winds.
Cannon went to Congress and caused a
whirlwind of protest and condemnation
by voting for the repeal of the Sherman
act.
This feeling does not extend to a union,
provided that it can be effected without
making any sacrifice of principle. The
California delegation to the National Con
vention will demand the principles of the
Omaha platform without any qualifica
tion, and they will not waver from their
principles. They need not do so, and they
are in a position to be independent, be
cause the party has been gaining steadily.
It has elected the Governors of five States,
eixteen Congressmen and seven United
States Senators. It has become a National
party, fully and completely organized by
counties and county committees in every
fctate west of the Mississippi and south of
the Ohio.
There has been no reasonable objection
made to the Omaha platform. It has
proved to be one of tne strongest plat
forms ever written, with the quality of at
tracting to the People's party whenever
there is a disintegration of old parties. In
Texas, a stronghold of ihe Democracy, the
ToDulists cast 99,000 votes for the candi
aate for the Presidency and 116,000 for Gov
ernor. Two y ears later 166,000 votes were
last for Governor, and Populism came
within 40,000 votes of carrying Texas. It
Is now conceded. Mr. Cator says, by two
thirds of the Democratic papers of that
State that Texas will be carried by the
How Some of the Populist Delegates Arrived in Sacramento.
People's party on the Omaha platform at
the next election.
In Georgia the party has a record of
97,000 votes, in Virginia of 90,030, and it
carried Alabama twice, if the votes were
allowed of be counted, ihe majority of the
county offices in Kansas last fall were won
by Populists, and they carried Colorado
by a majority of 7000. In Nebraska in 1894
they cast 97,000 votes for Governor, with
the indorsement of the silver party, and in
1895, when the silver Democrats ran inde
pendent and the Populists put a straight
ticket in the field on the Omaha platform,
they polled 107,000 votes.
When asked whether an opposition can
didate would be put against him in the
convention, Mr. Cator said that he had
heard of no opposition and knew of none,
except what he had seen in The Call this
morning, that A. H. Rose waÃ to contest
with him for the honor, but of this he
knew nothing personally.
At a late hour to-night a canvass among
the delegates, most of whom have arrived,
indicates that Cator will receive the nom
ination, in all probability by acclama
tion, and that the reported opposition to
him will be smothered the moment it
makes itself manifest.
DEBS AND HUNTINGTON.
Parallel Cases of Injustice That Will
Came a Cry Against the Rule
of Monopolists.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 11.â Among
the resolutions that will be introduced
during the session is the following:
Whereas, The events of the last two years
point unmistakably to an attempt on the part
of the dominant monopolists of the country to
destroy the liberties of the people through the
iniquitous method of Federal court injunction
and ita consequent contempt proceedings; and
whereas, in the imprisonment of Eugene
V. Debs without a jury trial for a crime of
which he was not guilty, on the one hand,
and absolute failure of the Federal authorities
to honestly prosecute the rich monopolist,
Collis P. Huntington, in a plain case for the
least of his crimes, on the other, the people of
this country have been given a fearful example
of the terrible power wielded by the great
monopoly; therefore, be it
Eesolved, That we unqualifiedly denounce
every species of legal proceeding having for its
object the imprisonment of a human being or
any restraint of his liberty that denies to him
his constitutional right to trial by jury, and
that we demand that this constitutional right
be enforced in all such cases; and, be it fur
ther
Resolved. That we denounce the imprison
ment of Eugene V. Debs as a crime against the
liberties of the people; and, be it further
Rttolvid, That we denounce the Federal au
thorities for their failure to prosecute Collis P.
Huntington as an unparalleled outrage.
W. H. Gilstrap, editor of the Tulare
County News of Visalia, will submit the
following, which promises to precipitate a
hoc debate:
1. Believing that the principles of the
People's party, as enunciated iD the Omaha
platform, are among the basic principle* of
popular government, and if enacted into law
would subserve the interests of the wealth
producers of the nation, we affirm allegiance
to said platform, and recommend that our
delegates to the National Convention of the
People's party be instructed to favor adhe
rence to said principles, with the proviso that
such questions as Government ownership of
public utilities, woman suffrage and the like
like questions tonching State and National
issues, which are susceptible of being acted
upon by a direct vote of the people, be settled
through the initiative and referendum, or
direct legislation.
2. The People's party being the only polit
ical party which is unreservedly committed
to free coinage of stiver, we extend the right
hand of political fellowship to all who oppose
financial, political and commercial supremacy
in this country through the single gold stand
ard, and urge them to unite with us in order
that the crime perpetrated through the de
monetization of silver may be revoked and
the money of the constitution restored to an
outraged people.
3. We favor the adoption and rigid enforce
ment of laws restricting foreign immigration,
in order that American labor shall receive
protection.
4. We are unalterably opposed to fusion
with any political party for the purpose of
securing offices, believing such action is sure
to result in the sacrifice of principle and
detrimental to the welfare of any party con
tending for a just cause.
5. We favor the adoption of the proposed
constitutional amendment enfranchising the
women of California on equal terms with
men, believing hs we do that it Is an act of
justice and would subserve the common wel
fare.
6. We are in favor of maintaining our gen
eral nnsectarlan free scbool^system and will
oppose all attempts to supplant it by any sec
tarian institution.
Dr. Oberg of the Alameda delegation
has the following to p\ace before the con
tion for consideration:
Whereas, We are satisfied that the princi
pies advocated by us and set forth in our nlat
form are the only means by which help can
come to the people of this State and of these
United States, we feel it our sacred duty to in
form and instruct our fellow-citizens who may
yet be ignorant of these facts and who may
therefore think, talk and vote against his and
our best interests; and whereas, the press, the
educator of the people, is owned by private
teESAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1896.
parties and corporations, and therefore can
and too often does oppose the sidd best inter
est of the people and efforts for reform; and
whereas, we cannot hope to march to victory
without the aid of the press. Now, therefor.?
belt
Resolved, That each and all of the delegates
representing the people of our respective dis
tricts, subscribe our names to and open our
purses for the payment of a sum sufficiently
larpe to buy, equip, edit, publish and cause to
be printed an oftieia! organ of our party for the
entire State of California, to be issued twice
per week during the campaign, after which it
shall be a weekly paper. Be it further re
solved, that each and all spread as many of
these papers as possible in their respective dis
tricts among unbelievers, thereby increasing
our ranks and augmenting our vote and carry
ing our banner forward victoriously next No
vember, so that our hopes and promises may
at once be realized. And if, in spite of these
comforts, we should, through lack of numbers,
suffer defeat, we may stili have an organ dif
fusing life and energy to our members, that
not only the old ones will keep up heart ana
remain with us, but that our numbers will in
crease and that four years hence we shall
easily gain the victory.
BEAT THE RAILROAD.
The Man Who Walked and the Man
Who Came in a Cart the
Heroes of the Hour.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 11.â W. O.
Gnggs of Alexander Valley, Sonoma
County, and T. F. Lee of Lakeport, Lake
County, were the heroes of fhe hour to
day. Both are delegates to the convention
and are pronounced antUfusionists.
Griggs is a tall man, rather long in the
legs, and with good, substantial feet for
walking. He wears a sandy beard, with
full whiskers, but his upper lip is shaved,
giving him the appearance of a pious dea
con. A low-crowned straw hat imparts a
rakish air and detracts from the deacon
ship, while a pair of pantaloons much too
long for his lengthy lees shriek loudly for
some one to turn them up at the bottom
E. W. Wardall of Monrovia. Chairman state Populist Central Commitu..
[Sketched at Sacramento by a ''Call " artitt.]
and that it's rainin' in Lunnun.
There is nothing cranky about Mr.
Griggs' appearance, his walk of 135 miles
from Healdsburg to Sacramento being the
only thing eccentric. He is jnst a plain
rancher, with but very few words to say.
A week ago last Wednesday he started
on his jaunt from Healdsburg and made
his first stop at Santa Rosa. He arrived
at Petaluma on Tuesday night and got
lure on Wednesday morning. Then he
came up the valley on the west side of the
Sacramento River and when he reached
Davisville be was told that it would be
dangerous to attempt to cross the railroad
trestle work, which extends for several
miles over the flooded district between
Sacramento and Davisville. But he came,
nevertheless, and took good care that the
Octopus did not get a chance to run over
him with a hog train.
"On the way I met lots of Populists," he
said, "and they wished the cause god
speed."
Delegate Griggs added that the pros
pects for Populism were good in his dis
trict During the last campaign some of
the precincts cast more votes for the Pop
ulists than the Democrats received. His
people had pledged him against fusion, he
added.
"The people who talk fusion are not
Populists; they claim to be. All that
fusion would accomplish wov\d be to give
the office-seekers a chance."
Delegate Lee came down from Lake
County determined to travel like a lord
and not pay a cent of railroad fare. He
hitched his favorite plow horse to a road
cart and started on his way along the rug
ged roads among ihe mountains of the
Switzerland of America. By dint of bard
driving he made Lower Lake, a distance
of twenty-four miles, Che first day. From
here to the Capay Valley the road was
rough and mountainous, and on the sec
ond day, while making for Farriar ranch,
he broke a wheel tire and for a while it
looked as though he would have to con
tinue the remainder of the journey in the
saddle, but he found a blacksmith who re
paired the damage, and he reached Wood
land on the third day.
The trip was not marked by any inci
dent, eventful or otherwise, except that he
was stood up on a road near Capay and
forced to pay 2r> cents toll, winch he con
sidered an outrage of the same grade as
the poll tax. It was not populiatic.
Mr. Lee remained at Woodland all
night, but was obliged to leave his horse
and cart at that place, b-cause of the flood
between Woodland and Sacramento. So,
after all, he was obliged to patronize the
Octopus and ride in the cars just the same
as if he were a plain Democrat, Republi
can or Prohibitionist.
On reaching Sacramento he walked five
miles out of town to see the brother of one
of his neighbors, and walked back again to
the State House as lively as a cricket.

CONGRESSIONAL TIMBER.
General Hart of tbe Second District
and Editor WatÂ«rhouie ofH
enth aa Candidates.
SACRA.MENTO, Cal., May 11.â General
A. L. Hart of Sacramento is being dis
cussed by the Populists for a place on the
Congressional ticket of the Second District.
He has not yet been approached on the
subject, but those who are close to him
declare that it is not likely he will accept
the honor.
A new aspirant for the Congressional
nomination in the Seveuth District is A. J.
Waterhouse of Fresno, the able editorial
writer of the Fr.sno Republican.
There are to be at least three candidates
for the position of chairman of the con
vention. This afternoon the names of
Charles A. Barlow of San Luis Obispo and
D. T. Fowler of Fresno sprang into promi
nence.

San Mateo, Sierra, Sutter, Trinity and
Tuolumne. Including the committeemen
these counties are entitled to an aggregate
of 44 delegates.
Santa Barbara has a contestinc, delega
tion and the expectation is that both dele
gations will be seated and each member
given half a vote. The contestants are J.
A. Wilcox, R. H. Fulweileiv J. W. Stark
weather and J. Bradley.
the Sev-
Santa Barbara's contesting delegations
will probably settle their trouble by seat
ing all the members present of both dele

up the quota to which that county is en
titled. Late to-nigrht Dr. Castle of Merced
was talsed of as a candidate for the chair
manship of the convention.

Vest and Frye Eulogize Huntington,
the Latter in a Long, Un
finished Speech.
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 11.-The
Senate had another copious dose of San
Pedro and Santa Monica to-day. Three of
the members of the Committee on Com
merce who opposed the amendment of
fered by the chairman of the committee
(Frye), designating Santa Monica as the
place for a deep-sea harbor in California â
Senators Berry of Arkansas, Vest of Mis
souri and Caffrey of Louisiana â submitted
remarks against the amendment, wbich
Berry described as a most unjustifiable
and inexcusable attempt to overrule pub
lic sentiment and to appropriate money in
the interest of private greed and private
gain.
"It would be better," exclaimed Berry,
"to dump this three millions in the Pacific
Ocean than to let the country know this
Senate is ready to override the army en
gineers and public sentiment in the inter
est of private greed and private gain."
Vest (D.), another member of the Com
mittee on Commerce, said he was unable
to appreciate the immediate necessity of
expending $3,000,000 either at San Pedro
or Santa Monica. He did not take any
stock in the abuse of Mr. Huntington be
cause he was a railroad president and rich
'man. Mr. Huntington had at least given
evidence of his sincerity in favor of Santa
Monica by giving up an investment of
nearly a million dollars at San Pedro.
After his subordinates had spent about
$900,000 in building a wharf and tracks at
. s an Pedro he concluded to examine the
matter himself, and had determined that
his company had selected the wrong place.
He had to have a harbor for his steamers
and had gone up the coast and found
Santa Monica and had spent a million
dollars there, leaving the investment at
San Pedro almost a total loss.
There were two questions, Vest said
before the Senate. The first was, Was
there an immediate necessity for the pro
posed investment? He came to a conclu
sion that there was not. The Government
â was not now in the presence of an over
flowing treasury, but a treasury whose
condition would necessitate in a few
months the issuance of bonds to meet the
ordinary expenses of the Government.
"Timrtunately. Mr. Huntington was a
political factor in California, where the
test of a man's fitness for office was
whether he was for Huntington or against
Huntinaton. and in that condition of
public sentiment there he would not make
the appropriation at this time.
Vest went on to argue that with the ex
penditure of $392,000 in continuing the im
provements at San Pedro there would be a
depth of eighteen feet in that harbor at
low water, and of twenty-three or twenty
four feet at high tide: that the largest
â  ships could float there, and that that would
meet all the expenses of the improvement
at present and in the future.
Discussing the amendment offered by
White (D.) of California, providing for an
other committee. Vest said he would not
have an engineer officer on it, because
with General Craie Hill as chief engineer
of the army that officer would be bound in
courtesy to his support not to take an an
tagonistic position to him. He would
therefore sutrgest a commission consisting
of an officer of the coast survey, an officer
of the navy and a civilian engineer. He
closed his speech with an expression of the
hope that he would never again hear of
Santa Monica or San Pedro.
White (D.) of California said that he
was perfectly willing to have the matter
submitted to an impartial board. All he
wanted was that some authority would
pass upon the question before it was voted
upon.
Caffrey based his argument on the re
ports of the two boards of army engineers,
and was reminded in that connection of
the success of the Eads scheme for deep
ening the approach to New Orleans in
spite of the adverse views of army engi
neers.
Â£ rye, chairman of the committee, com
menced the task of answering all the ob
jections to the committee amendment,
and in doing so eulogized C. P. Hunting
ton, who had been mentioned aa a politi
cal factor in California, where a man's
chances for nomination for office depended
upon the fact of whether he was for or
apainst Huntington.
Before he began his speech he had a
large diagram of Santa Monica Bay and
its surroundings spread out on the carpet
in the area and two other smaller dia
grams displayed on each side. He pro
ceeded to explain the various points shown
on the diagram and to state their connec
tion with tbe pending question. He spoke
of the opposition to Santa Monica coming
from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Pc
Railroad Company, which had been rain
ing telegrams upon the Senators for the
last ten day?, and said the only reason he
could see was that it was the remains of an
old fight, by which that company had lost
ten or twelve million dolUrs.
Frye agreed with Vest that he was tired
of the San Pedro and Santa Monica ques
tion. He spoke somewhat contemptuously
of the attitude of the people of Los An
poles on the subject. He declared that he
uouli rather have the kindly regard of
Senators and thtir confidence than all the
support of all the railroads and railroad
men on the face of the earth and all the
money they possessed.
"The Los Angeles Times," Frye said,
" said that if I succeeded in getting
Santa Monica received as a harbor my
pockets would be lined with gold. What
a happy way they have (addrensing
â¢White of California) of talking of public
men in your State. What high estimates
they make of us. I thank a kind Provi
dence that ever since my mother put the
first pocket into my pantaloons it has been
just as well lined with gold from that day
to this as my modest necessities ever
required."
Hill suggested jocularly that the Repub
lican Convention recently held in Cali
fornia had declared for silver.
"Very likely it did," said Frye, "and
against railroads."
Frye then read an extract from White's
speech, speaking of "the greed ol one
man,' meaning Huntington, and com
mented upon it as "a little bit of the
slogan of the sand lots and of the Golden
Gate whenever the name of Huntington is
conjured to frighten babies and whene ver
it is used oy demagogues to make the
knees of the weak-kneed politicians trem
ble." [Laughter.]
"And yet," he continued, "that one
man, the Senator admits, is building up a
great commerce coming to the finest wharf
in the whole world. But if that man is
building up that great commerce is he not
entitled to have a harbor into which that
commerce will come just as much as if it
were built up by twenty different men?
Is Mr. Huntington to be excluded from all
the benefits of legislation ? If he succeeds
in establishing a great line of ships from
China and Japan and pouring their
products into Santa Monica Bay.where it is
taken and landed in New Orleans as cheap
ly as it is to-day carried from San Vran
cisco to Ogden, and where it is then taken
on board his great line of twenty steamers
to New York for one-fifth the cost of
freight from Ogden to New Yorfc by rail,
is he to be punished for it? Is he entitled
to the reprobation of tbe Senate ? Is he
to be summoned up as the ghost to
frighten Senators out of Toting as their
consciences dictate? If that is the course
to be pursued we must reform this river
and harbor bill. We must change it en
tirely. We must strike out quite a num
ber of items in it.
"Take the appropriation for Newport
News. There was the Chesapeake and
Ohio, dead as a duck, an utter wreck,
when this man Huntington took it.
He brought it to life and with
his courage and his indomitable en
ergy he built one ot the finest roads in
this country from Cincinnatti to Newport
News. And today it is carrying more
corn than any other line on this earth.
Cut out the appropriation for Newport
News, because Huntington built up tbe
Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. That is
the appeal.
"Take another thing. We have been
helping great shipyards by giving them
contracts for building vessels, and I am
glad we did. We have been giving large
contracts to the Bethlehem and to Carne
gie, and have been giving them a chance
to establish their plant as a good thing to
do. But there was a quiet man in the
United States who did not call upon the
United States for any help. Nobody in
this Senate knew what was going on at
Newport News.
"One day I received an invitation to go
and witness a ship-launching at Newport
News. I had not known that there was a
shipyard there. I went there and saw a
great iron ship married to the ocean. It
had been built in the finest shipyard in the
world, equipped with all conceivable
modern machinery, at a cost of $6,000,000.
There Mr. Huntington employs thousands
of men who have been pledged to support
and educate their families and to build
themselves homes. And for the next half
century that yard is going to support
these men and their children. And Hun
tington did it.
"Oh, cut out the appropriation for New
port News. He ought not to have it. Hun
tington ought to be punished for building
a shipyard, which is to-day underbidding
every shipyard in America in building the
great warships of the country.
"Cut out of the bill the appropriation
for Newport News, with its great line of
steamers, and the appropriations for New
Orleans, with its twenty steamers to New
York. Oh (bitterly), it is too paltry. It
is too paltry to undertake to stop legisla
tion with that cheap demagogical cry that,
because Huntington has done it, therefore
no help must be given to Huntington.
"He employs 75,000 men and pays them
their wages when due. I know of an in
stance where a railroad was an utter
wreck, owing its laborers $500,000. Mr.
Huntington put his hand in his pocket,
gave the $500,000 to the railroad (wreck as
it was) to enable it to pay its workmen,
and then he took that wrecked road and
with his energy brought it up to life and
activity and value."
After Frye had been speaking for over
an hour with great force and energy he
beean to show signs of fatigue and readily
yielded to a suggestion of White that he
â¢ should finish his argument to-morrow.
Gorman (D.) of Maryland gave notice of
an amendment which he intended to offer
to the river and harbor bill, limiting the
expenditures for any one year to $10,000,
-000.
The bill then wÂ«Â»ntover and the calendar
of private pension bills was taken up.
After about a dozen were passed further
progress was blocked by an attempt of
Allen (P.) of Nebraska "to have a second
pension case engrafted on a bill giving a
pension to the mother of an officer, and
at 5:35 the Senate adjourned until to-
morrow.

AN IRISH BARON'S FUNERAL
So Thoroughly American That He Never
Wore His Title, Preferring to Be
Called Plain "Mr. Tighe."
NEW YORK, N. V., May 11.â The first
funeral in many years that has taken
place from a house in Union square was
held Saturday from the residence of the
late Senator Richard Tighe. The only
dwelling-house left in the famous square is
No. 32, where Sir Richaid Tighe. or Mr.
Tighe, as he insisted on being called, had
lived alone for years. The funeral was
strictly private and only a few friends
were present.
Richard Tighe was a son of an Irish
Baronet. He was born in Ireland in 180(>
jand was educated at Trinity College,
Dublin. He came to America when 32
years old, and after going into business,
married Miss Caroline Chesebrough, who
died in 189 L He was a brother-in-law of
the late Robert Chesebrough, Nicholas
Stuyvesant and Phillip Kearney.
Tighe was a director in the Manhattan
Fire Insurance Company for many years.
When he passed his eightieth year he re
tired from active business and lived a
quiet, unostentatious life in the old
fashioned red brick house at East Six
teenth street and Fourth avenue. His figure
was a well-known one in the neighbor
hood. When he became ill last Wednes
day there was little hope that he would
recover, as he was 90 years old.
Tighe had lived so long in this country
and his sympathies were so thoroughly
American that when the title came to him
at his elder brother's death it bad little
meaning, and he preferred to be known
simply as "Mr. Tigbe."
The Cruixer Brooklyn.
DELAWARE BREAKWATER, Dkl.,
May 11.â The new cruiser Brooklyn went
to tea shortly after 9 o'clock this morning
for her builders' trial trip, and proceeded
directly off shore about seventy-five miles
to deep water. The run was "made under
forced draught and consumed about three
hours, during which time the cruiser de
veloped a speed of 21.07 knots an hour,
which is equivalent to 24 statute miles.
The weather conditions for the trial were
perfect.
SCOTT JACKSON'S TRIAL
Scathing Arraignment of the
Prisoner by the Prosecuting
Attorney.
The Court's Instructions to the Jury
Construed to Be Against the
Defendant.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 11.â To-day's
feature of the trial of Scott Jackson was
the scathing arraignment of the prisoner
by Colonel Gilson of the prosecution.
Colonel Gilson's speech was bitter in de
nunciations. He began with tbe story of
Pearl Bryan's birth and parentage, spoke
of the simplicity of her surroundings and
her quiet country life. He then spoke of
her meeting with Jackson, whom he char
acterized as a much-traveled man of the
world. When he came to Jackson's mnet
ing with the simple country girl and his
admissions on the stand, in the presence
of the dead girl's mother and relatives,
that he had had improper relations with
her, he fairly flayed the prisoner, and
pointing his finger at Jackson, while his
voice trembled and his frame shook with
pent-up passion, he exclaimed:
"This man won that gir!. She looked
upon him as a god, for so lovers seem, but
he proved a demon."
The speaker recounted how Jackson
threw Pearl Bryan's trinkets into the
river. "But that valise," cried Colonel
Gilflon, as he shook the bloody satchel
within a foot of Jackson's face, "that
valise had an electric touch, and he could
not let go of it."
At several points in his speech Colonel
Gilson appealed to the jurors by name, and
twice put questions to Attorney Crawford.
He went into an analysis of tbe evidence,
scoring Witness Truest and others of the
defendant's witnesses, making light of the
medical experts.
He concluded by declaring that the de
fendant had been guilty of seduction, mur
der, mutilation of a dead body and rob
bery. He spoke for about five hours, and
at 5 o'clock the court adjourned until
Tuesday. Colonel Crawford will then
speak.
The instructions to the jury given by
the court this morning are very volum
inous, and are generally construed to be
against the prisoner.

American Minister, on the subject of the
Cuban filibusters. The result of the con

EQUALITY AMONG
THE METHODISTS
Record of the General Con
ference on the Race
Question.
HINT TO THE HOTEL MEN
A Change Is Made in the Day
for Holding the Church
Elections.
THE FOUR HEW BISHOPRICS.
An All-Absorbing Topic â Speculations
as to Candidatesâ Talk of
Dark Horses.
CLEVELAND, 0., May 11.-The Metho
dist General Conference put itself on record
on the race question this morning by
adopting a resolution introduced by Dr.
Monroe, endorsing the treatment that the
Cleveland hotels had accorded to all dele
gates regardless of color, and demanding
that wherever it was decided to hold the
conference in future, a guarantee be ob
tained of equal treatment.
The committee on fraternity and union
of the Methodist church, appointed four
years ago, was required to report at once.
The fact that the standing committees had
not reported yet almost brought the con
ference to a stop, and a recess was taken.
During the recess Dr. Graw and Dr.
Lanahan hatched up a scheme to have the
elections occur this week. Accordingly
Graw moved to reconsider the vote of last
week by which May 18 was fixed as elec
tion doy. It was finally decided to begin
the elections on Thursday.
An attempt to deal a blow at Dr. Buck
ley of New York, who is a candidate for
the episcopate, was made by the Rev. Dr.
William Knight of California, asking that
all that part of the speech of Dr. Buckley
which referred to the lack of enough spir
itual backbone in the conference delegates
to properly spend Sunday if the elections
were held on Monday be stricken from the
record. The conference almost unani
mously tabled the resolution.
The all-absorbing topic afier the confer
ence adjourned was the four new bishop
rics which it is proposed to form. The
change of the date of voting has made the
campaign a lively one. The change, which
Dr. Buckley supported, comes with the
announcement that the doctor has decided
not to allow his name to be presented to
the conference as a candidate.
Four years ago at Omaha Earl Cranston
of the Western Book Concern wns asked
by a committee if he would wit hdraw from
the book concern with a view to being
elected Bishop.
At that time he refused, but now he is
of another mind. He would accept the
elevation to the episcopacy with alacrity
and it must be admitted that he has con
siderable strength.
Chaplain C. C. McCabe is another possi
bility who has developed considerable
strength within the last forty-eight hours.
The chaplain is popular and his strength
lies among the friends of every candidate
before the conference.
In regard to Dr. J. W. E. Bo wen, the
colored candidate, the situation is still un
changed and probably will remain so.
But there are two men whose names
have not yet appeared in public in con
nection with the elections whose chances
compare favorably with any of the avowed
candidates. They are Dr. John Hamilton of
New England, secretary of the Freedman's
Aid Society, and Dr. H. J. Jackson of
Chicago. It is the old case of the bringing
forward of a dark horse, and Jaikson is
the dark horse around whom the Western
and Central States will rally.

old-line Republicans and the American
Protective Association, the latter making
a hght against the indorsement of Sena
tors Mantle and Carter and Congressman
Harter, because of their views on the In
dian appropriation bill. The test vote
came a motion to seat the contesting anti-
A. P. A. delegation from Granite and the
A. P. A. men were defeated by a vote of
197 to 104, showing a majority of 93 against
the secret political organization.
Resolutions were then adopted com
mending the action of Senators Teller,
Dubois, Cannon, Mantle and Carter on the
silver question and "demanding the res
toration of silver to its ancient money
function as a means of equalizing the dif
ference in wages and the cost of living."
Bimetallism, protection and reciprocity
were the three cardinal principles of Re
publican faith, and a declaration was made
for the free coinage of gold and silver at a
ratio of 16 to 1 independently by the United
States.
The Democratic administration was de
nounced for its efforts to foist upon the
country its twin factors of cheapnessâ free
trade and the ecld standard â and for dis
honoring the Nation's flag in Hawaii, re
fusing to recognize Cuba and incurring a
National deot. Efforts were made to in
struct the National delegates to walk out
of the convention in case free silver was
not recognized. McKinley's name was
very coldly received, and the delegates
will go to St. Louis uninstructed.

RIVER STEAMER BLOWN UP
Terrible Explosion and Loss of
Life Near Vicksburg, Miss
issippi.
Of the Thirty Persons on Board Few
Escaped Injuryâ The Boat Sank
Immediately.
VICKSBURG, Miss., May 11.â Word
reached here this morning that the
steamer Harry Brown was blown up by the
explosion of a boiler fifty miles below here
last night. The boat carries a crew of
thirty roustabouts.
So terrific was the force of the ex
plosion that the boat was torn asunder
and in Jess than five minutes was at
the bottom of the Mississippi. It is
known that the following were killed
outright by the explosion or by drowning:
Pilot Norman Bardsley, the steersman;
William Dougherty, chief engineer; An
nie Herd, chambermaid; Tom Judd, fire
man; William Watson, first mate; Wil
liam Fitzsimmons, second mate, and
George Keim and William Kelley, lamp
trimmers. The bodies of the last three
men were recovered and brought to this
city by the steamer Hansel, which was in
sight of the Brown at the time of the ac
cident.
The survivors and Injured were brought
here on the Hansel. Ihe injured were
conveyed to the Marine Hospital, and are
all in a fair way to recovery. Owing to
the proximity of the Hansel and tbe quick
efforts at rescue many lives were saved
that otherwise would have been lost.
Captain Keim of the Harry Brown, al
though seriously injured, remained on the
afterpart of the cabin of the Brown where
he had been blown by the explosion after
it had floated off the hul', which had sunk.
He was perfectly cool and directed the
efforts of the men who were saving the
boat's crew. The captain does not know
the cause of the explosion. Captain Keim
and Pilot Dan Kane were in the Brown's
pilot-house when the explosion occurred.
Five men were badly injured.

Telegraph Operator Killed by a
Civil Engineer at Puerto
Barrios.
American Railroad Workmen Taks
the Slayer From Jail and Hang
Him to a Tree.
MEMPHIS, Texn\, May 11.â Four days
apo there were received in this city letters
announcing the hanging by a mob of
Europe Adrian Harper Dewitt of this
city at Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. They
were forwarded by W. J. Clark, who was
located at Montgomery, Ala., to-night.
His story of the affair is as follows:
"On the afternoon of the 28th I went to
the wharf to see about a passage to New
Orleans. The Breakwater had just arrived
from New Orleans and Dewitt came aahore.
"He went with me to my lodging-house.
The next day we went into the telegraph,
office, where Dewitt became involved in a
quarrel with one McNamara, a train
dispatcher on the Ferro Carril del Norte
Railroad. McNamara followed Dewitt out
of the office and struck him a severe blow
in the face. I helped Dewitt up and took
him to the lodging-house, where he
changed his clothing. He told me he
would call his assailant to account."
"Later in the day we returned to the
telegraph office and the quarrel was re
newed. Dewitt suddenly caught McNa
mara by the collar, drew his pistol and
shot him through the head, killing him
instantly. Dewitt surrendered himself to
the authorities, and shortly afterward a
crowd of Americans, mostly mechanics
employed on the railroad, gathered for the
purpose of laking the Jaw into their own
hands. They made an attempt on the
jail, but were repulsed.
"I made my way on board the steamer
Nicaragua, which set sail in a few hours.
When the Nicaragua reached Galveston
we telegraphed to Puerto Barrios and
learned that the mob had made a second
and successful attack on the prison and
Dewitt was taken oat and hanged to a tree."
Dewitt was related closely to the Har*
pers. publisners, of New York, has an
uncle of that name living at Washington,
and was a civil engineer of National repu*
tation.

WICHITA, Kans., May 11.â A quiet
{ but determined movement is going on to
obtain a pardon for Frank H. Truesdell,
who was convicted of passing forged checki
on San Francisco and Pasadena banks,
| and who is now serving a term in the State
j prison. A petition in Truesdell's behalf is
j to be presented to the Governor of Kansas
!at an early date. After his convictiou
I Truesdell stated that he expected that his
late associates in the California Midwinter
! Exposition would exercise influence to
j obtain his freedom. This expectation has
not been realized up to the present time
and unless the names on the petition soon
to be forwarded prove to be those of
Californians it will be developed that the
I unfortunate prisoner is relying on friends
outside of the Pacific Coast to obtain his
i absolution from punishment decreed by

STANFORD MEN
WILL GO EAST
Athletes to Compete in the
Field Events at
Chicago.
CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
Eight Wearers of the Cardinal
Expected to Capture the
Championship.
RAISING FUNDS FOR THE TOUR
Receipts From the Sale of the Senior
Classbook Generously
Contributed.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
11. â Stanford's track team is going East â
at least that is what Track Manager Brown
and Captain George Toombs say. Already
plans have been made which promise
financial success and application has been
made for entry in the Western intercol
legiate championship meet, which takes
place in Chicago on June 6. Not all the
men will co, but eight prize-winners have
been selected whom, it is believed, stand a
good chance of winning a great victory for
Stanford. Those selected are Brunton,
Bernhard, Brown, Dole, Reynolds, Wil
bur, Toombs (captain) and either Frazier,
Jack, Hazzard or Fickert, as may b8 de
cided hereafter by their individual work.
"With this aggregation," said Manager
Brown, "I'm -willing to go against any
like number of men from any college. Of
course I wouldn't expect victory steadily,
but all the contests would be exciting and
we wouldn't be outclassed. With the
Western Intercollegiate Association, of
which Berkeley is now champion, I feel
certain we stand a good show of winning.
We mean to make a good try."
The whole scheme has been kept very
quiet up to this time, as it was uncertain
just what could be done. After Stanford's
virtual victory in the intercollegiate meet
many enthusiasts thought than Stanford
could pick out eight or ten men who could
win most anything and now they are
â willing to help the boys show what they
can do. Three weeks yet remain before
the team will leave and all the men will
go into training at once. Captain Toombs
cays that they will be all the better for
their lay-off, and that they are in fair con
dition now was shown by individual per
formances during the San Jose carnival.
Coaches and rubbers will be obtained at
once and the training-table started. The
estimated cost of the trip will be $1100.
Ten or twelve days will be occupied by the
team in its tour and it will enter but the
one meet.
The scheme which is to furnish the
wherewithal for this venture is due to
Messrs. Hanscom and Colliver, students,
who are issuing the senior claasbook.
Already they have orders enough to pay
the expenses of their undertaking, and as
the sale of the volume promised to be very
large they generously offered to divide
evenly with the track team all volumes
sold over and above those necessary to pay
expenses. The sale is expected to reach
at least 500 copies, which would mean be
tween $700 and $800 to the team. The re
maining amount will be made up by the
men themselves or through plans which
are now being arranged
The senior claesbook is one of the most
elaborate pieces of work ever attempted
by a Western university. It is got up in
large album style, strongly bound in an
engraved cover, witn the senior class
colors â straw, gold and cardinal. The
boon is devoted entirely to photogravures
of interest to Stanford University. It is
to be a souvenir of this institution, and
will contain individual photogravures of
the Stanford family, the university faculty
members, of every member of the senior
class, large group engravings of the
Varsity and class football, baseball and
track teams, and between fifty and sev
enty-five views of the campus, including
views of the quadranele, exterior and in
terior of buildings, Palo Alto, residences
(including Mrs. Stanford's mansion), fra
ternity houses, athletic grounds and snap
shots; also views taken after and during
the recent celebration when the victory in
the great Stanford case was decided.
The Junior Class Annual â the third
book of its kind issued from this univer-
Bity â appeared to-day and nearly 400 copies
were at once disposed of. There has been
a feeling of general anxiety on the part of
the students, for no one knows that he
may not be bit in the "joshes" and
"grinds," and no one can tell just how
severely the sting may affect him. It is
safe to say the "grinds" in the present
volume will cause no hard feeling; none
show the slightest touch of malice, but all
are good-natured and recognized as perti
nent.
This annual, issued by the class of '97, is
superior to any of its predecessors in many
respects. The design on the cover is taste
ful aad unique; the binding itself is in
white, gold and cardinal. One of the most
striking features of the whole work is the
amount and the excellence of the illustra
tions â all tne work of Stanford artists and
chiefly from the class talent. R. K. Cul
ver '97, now of The Call staff, was in
charge of the art work, and his talent is
proved by some of the finest pieces in the
volume. The design of the cover is his
creation. He was assisted by Messrs.
Allen, McCartney, Johnson, Ely and
Hyde ami by the Misses Holly and Mor
ton. Certainly the art work is far superior
to anything ever issued here. There are
no less than three-score full-page engrav
ings and more than a hundred half-page
small cuts.
There are pictures of the board of ed
itors, of nine faculty members, of most of
the fraternities, athletic team and student
organisations, of Stanford's debaters,
literary societies and local scenes from
photographers. Then there are elaborate
foot pieces and head pieces, pen
and-ink sketches ad infinitum. In ton
ing none of the work surpasses Miss
Hoilv's, while Miss Morton's efforts in
the Decadent style and following Beards
ley's innovation are remarkably uood.
Dane Coolidge '98 toofc the prize for the
best short story, while Irving Outcait '96
has the prize poem.
The "Qu:ia" is printed on the highest
grade glazed book paper and contains
nearly 300 pajres.
Edwin Maslin Hulme, the editor-in
chief, was born in London 23 years a*:o,
and came to America at the au;e of 14. In
.Portland, Or., Mr. Hulme became con
nected with the Review as musical and
dramatic critic. His work brought him
into prominence, and his poems, which
be^an to appear about this time, brought
him encouragement from some leading
poets and writers of the day. Mr. Hulme en
tered Stanford three years ago and has been
connected from the first witn the Sequoia,
of which he has just been elected editor
in-chief. Associated with Mr. Hulrae in
the publication of the "Quad" were the
following juniors: Sherrili B. Osborne,
J. H. Timmons, R. J. O'Neil, J. M. Ross,
J. F. Barnett, J. W. Bell and Miss Jessie
A. Ryan. R. H. Spencer was the business
manager. There has been a very heavy
sale of tne book and it will undoub tedly
prove a financial success.
Plans have been drawn, and Resident
Architect Hodges is arranging for the let
ting of the contract for building a large
auditorium here. The building will be a
frame structure, but of expensive con
struction. It will be built with special
reference to its acoustic properties, and
will probably be completed during the
year. Heretofore there has been a great
nee<i of such a building, and this is the
first want to be satisfied. The great stone
chemistry laboratory will next be built,
but, though the contract is let for its con
struction, it will not be begun this year.
When completed, however, it will be the
fin- st building of its kind on the coast.
On Thursday next the 'U6 and '98 class
baseball teams are to settle theclass cham
pionship in a match game, and on Friday
evening tue glee and mandolin clubs are to
give their final concert here.
LOS ANGELES SUFFRAGISTS.

xocneif of their Cause.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 11.â The

amendment to the State constitution,
conferring the right of franchise upon
women, is going forward in all parts of
Los Angeles County. Tne committee
opened headquarters in room 300 of the
Byrne block in this city this afternoon,
where the executive committee will meet
every Monday afternoon. The committee

VISALIA'S OUTLAW BAND.
Lovren and Ardell to Be Tried
Separately for Train
Robbery.
Under-Sheriff Dasgett Recovers From
the Wound Received in the
Goshen Holi-Up.
VISALIA, Cal., May 11.â Si Lovren and
Charles Ardell were arraigned this morn
ing for complicity in the attempted South
ern Pacific train holdup on March 18,
when Dan McCall was killed by Officers
Daggett and Reed. The reading of the in
formation was waived and the defendants
both pleaded not puilty. District Attor
ney Howard then demanded that, as the
defendants had insisted on separate trials,
the case of Lovren be called first. The
defense demurred to this, but the District
Attorney had the right to designate which
should be tried first, so the order was made.
The next move by the defense was for
time. The prosecution was ready to pro
ceed, but Lovern's attorneys wanted at
least a month in which to make prepara
tions. Judge Gray su.-gestect that both
cases be disposed of before the summer
vacation. They were finally set for June 1.
Under-Sheriff Earl Daggett, who was
wounded by Outlaw McCall, returned to
Visalia on this morning's train from
Tulare. He was accompanied by his
mother and father. A closed carriage
met them at the depot, and as soon as they
dismounted from the train they entered
the carriage and were driven home. Quite
a number of the wounded deputy's friends
were present to welcome him back. Young
Daggett was well wrapped up in a big
overcoat and was looking well. He had a
narrow escape from death.
ARRAIGNED AT STOCKTON.
Mrs. Jennie Vaccaressa Held for the Alleged
Killing of Her Hus
band.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 11.â Mrs. Jennie
Vaccaressa was to-day held to answer in
the Superior Court to the accusation of
having slain her husband by strangula
tion. The charge against the woman was
reduced to manslaughter, bail being fixed
at $5000.
Mrs. Vaccaressa went to the house of a
neighbor named Silva shortly before mid
night on the night of March 31 and told
Silva that a thief had entered the house
and, after robbing her of what little money
she had, turned upon her husband, and
was struggling with him when she left.
Silva at once secured assistance, and, on
going to the Vaccaressa home, found the
husband dead, his body lying near the
front door. About his neck was a rope,
with which he had been strangled.
Mrs. Vaccaressa's stories were so con
flicting and regarded as so flimsy by the
authorities that she was arrested and
charged with the murder of her husband.
To a Call correspondent she started to
tell the story of a fight with her husband,
but was checked by the advice of her
attorney. Her husband frequently beat
her, and on the night he was killed he
had assaulted her, threatening to beat her
to death with a musket that he bad earned
into the bedroom.
Mrs. Vaccaressa's bail is supplied Dy the
wealthiest two men in the county.
SANTA BARBARA INVENTION
Electric Lights Which Do Xot Illuminate
Surrounding Lots.
BANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 11.âWil
liam Kencaid of this place has obtained a
patent which is destined to mark a great
stride forward in the electric lighting of
city streets. He has devised an ingenious
contrivance to be attached to mast lights
at the intersection of streets, and which
shuts the light off from surrounding lots,
where it is not desired, and sends four
powerful beams, in the nature of search
lights, down the streets.
This invention was successfully tried in
the city before an application fora patent
was sent to Washington, and it was saiisr
fa^torily demonstrated that by the light it
shed fine newspaper print could be road
two blocks distant. Without it, the same
print could witn difficulty be deciphered a
block distant.
SÂ«Â» Luis Ojtisbo Hold-Up.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., May 11.â Dr.

San Jose Valley, arrived here late last
l.igbt, and putting his team in a livery
stable started for his town residence, some
distance from the center of the city. When
near home he was met met by a man whom
Le thought was his hired man, but the fel
low proved to be a stranger, who dealt the
doctor two terrific blows behind the ear
with a sandbag. The footpad robbed the
doctor of $55.

SAD ROMANCE OF
SANTA BARBARA.
Miss Gaty Wedded at the
Bedside of Her Dying
Father.
JOY DIMMED BY DEATH.
The Ceremony Hastened at the
Wish of the Stricken
Parent.
HIS LAST WORD A BLESSING.
Mourning in a Home Which Was to
Have Been a Scene of Gayety
To-Day.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 11.â
There was a marriage and a death in the
Arlington Hotel this evening. The one
event, which Santa Barbara society looked
forward to with expectancy, was saddened
by the other. It was a romantic wedding,
but the touch of the Reaper that made it
j so chilled the romance and left mourning
where there should have been happiness.
For some time past E. W. Gaty, one of
the proprietors of the Arlington, has been
a very sick man. He was afflicted with
Bright's disease of the kidneys and with
jit heart trouble. This morning his con
! dition changed for the worse and he died
at 6 o'clock this evening.
Mr. Gaty's daughter, Ada, was to have
married N. T. Powell, the cashier of the
Arlington, to-morrow, but when the
change in htr father's condition came a
clergyman was called and the couple were
made man and wife and received the con
gratulations and blessing of the dying
man.
Mr. Gaty was well known in Santa Bar
bara politics, and many a time he swung
his forces into line and snatched victory
out of what seemed like hopeless defeat.
He was twice Mayor of this city and was
an upright, honorable geutleman, whose
demise is deeply mourned.

itors were welcomed by J. M. Mannon of
Court Redwood. After dinner various
places of interest in the vicinity of Ukiah
were visited.
The committee on jurisprudence and
supervision, to whom was referred some
120 proposed amendments to the general
laws, will, in all probability, ask further
time in which to submit its report. It is
said it will report favorably on the proposi
tion to allow the consideration of amend
ments proposed on the floor of the High
Court meeting; also that of holding bien
nial in place of annual sessions.
A concert by the Ukiah and Clcverdale
bands was tendered delegates at the opera
house this evening. The session of the
High Court convenes to-morrow morning.

"JIMMY" JACKSON AT SEATTLE.
Safe Return of the Daring Mail Carrier
Who Tramped Into the Yukon in
Winter.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 11.â The steam
ships Willapa and Alki arrived in port to
day from the North bringing the latest
Alaskan advices. The Willapa had as one
of its passengers "Jimmy" Jackson, the
intrepid Alaskan half-breed, whose return
to the Sound closes a 12000-mile winter
journey made for the purpose of taking to
the imprisoned miners on the Yukon a
supply of mail matter to break the tedious
ness of the long Arctic winter. There
were five in the mail party- three Indians
and two white men. The whites were L.
S. Hodge and N. McNeil, both of whom.
Jackson says, undoubtedly perished. He
and tlie other two Indians deserted their
white companions, Â»vho from excessive
cold and hunger had become very slow
travelers, late in December and no word
has since been heard Imm them.
Jackson's arrival on March 22 at Forty
Mile, his destination, created the greatest
excitement. He was a "Dig man" at the
diggings and nothing was too good for
him. The trin was one of hardship and
suffering and was made only after the last
dog (several having been taken along for
sledding purposes) had been killed and
eaten as a precaution against what ap
peared to be in sightâ starvation. Jackson
expects to carry mail into the Yukon again
next winter and by the same route, but
this summer he will establish stations be
tween Takou harbor and Takish, at each
of which he will cache clothing and food
supplies.
The Canadian mail which carriers at
tempted to convey into the Yukon in mid
winter lies entombed in snow on the sum
mit of Chilcat pass.
THE WEAVERVILLE TRIAL
John Vinton Swears to Having
Been Ambushed and Shot
by Littlefield.
Displays in Ccurt the Scars From the
Wounds Inflated by the
Vaqu ro.
WEAVLRVILLE, Cal., May 11.â When
the trial of Constables Crow and Van
Horn, for complicity in the lynching of
"Jack" Littlefield on September 27, 1894,
was resumed this morning, J. M. Vinton
was called to the stand. Vintonis "King"
George E. White's right bower, and it was
at his demand that Littlefield was ar
rested. He claimed to have been shot by
Littlefield, and because of this alleged
shooting the vaquero met his death at the
hands of the lyncbers.
Vinton told of having been shot from
behind a tree by a masked man, who ran as
soon as he had fired. He recognized the
attempted muraerer as "Jack" Littlefield.
He tried to raise bis rifle to return the
shot, but was partially paralyzed end soon
fell from the horse and fainted from loss
of blood. Every one in the courtroom
crowded forward as Vinton bared his
bre ast and showed the scars of the wounds
and described his narrow escape from
d eath.
He told of reaching Haydon's place that
night in a desperately wounded condition.
On his arrival he sent for Constable Van
Horn and demanded the arrest of Little
fiel d. Vinton said that he owned one-half
inte rest in a cattle herd with John Rohr
bough, a nep hew of George E. White.
Fred Radcliffe, a picturesque cowboy
wearing fringed buckskin trousers, was the
next witness. He was questioned by the
prosecution as to his movements and
whereabouts, particularly when in com
pany with Joe Gregory on the 17th of Sep
tember ; and as to being at Haydon's place
and going out with "Buck" Lacock, Joe
Gregory. Thomas Haydon, Constable Van
Horn, Deputy Constable John Crow and
Geordon Van Horn to the scene where
Vinton was shot.
Following Radcliffe Thomas Haydon.
the owner of the ranch to which Vinton
came, took the stand and named the differ
ent persons at his house on September 26
and 27.
The lust witness of the afternoon was
Ehsha Kane, a splendid physical specimen
of the old forty-niner. He testified to
having gone to Haydon's ranch after hear
ing of the shooting of Vinton. He sat up
with the sick man i and first heard from
Vinton that Littlefield had shot him on
the night of September 26. He also
named the persons who came to the Hay
don place while he was there.
The object of the line of testimony in
troduced by the prosecution to-day seems
to be to prove a conspiracy, with the de
fendants as the tools.

MARSHFIELD MURDERER'S FATE.
Carl Aubrecht Sentenced to Death for
Killing His Wife.
MARSHFIELD, Or., May 11.-Judge
Fullerton, in the State Circuit Court at
Empire City, to-day sentenced Carl Au
brecht to be hanged on June 26.
Aubrecht was convicted of murdering his
wife in South Marshfield on February 18.
The prisoner shot and killed his wife on a
street because she refused to provide for
his supper. Aubrecht had been very cruel
to the woman for a number of years and
his treatment became so bitter the week
before the crime that she left him and in
stituted divorce proceedings. Aubrecht
did his utmost to get her to return, and the
day before the crime said that he would
talk no longer but would kill her the next
day. After Mrs. Aubrecht returned from
doing a day's washing he made good his
threat.

INDIANS JOIN THE
MADERA CHASE
Camping on the Trail of
Outlaws Laverone and
Roberts.
HOUNDS OFF THE TRACK
Trace the Fugitives to a Creek
and There the Scent Is
Lost
MANY POSSES IN THE HILLS.
Officers Believe Starvation Will Soon
Drive the Escapes From Their
Retreat.
MADERA, Cal., May 11.â The pursuit
of the fugative outlaws, Laverone and
Roberts, who escaped from the jail at this
place after a desperate struggle with Jailer
Wells las: Thursday, is growing exciting.
The Indians of Picayune ilancheria have
joined in the chase. It is the first time
they ever volunteered their services to
capture a white criminal ; but they want
revenge f6r the killing of the old squaw
Mane, about eight months ago, by a
white man who covered his tracks so well
that they were unable to capture him.
Sheriff Westfall is working near Fine
Gold; George Wells, a son of the jailer,
and James Ham ikon are at the head of
the posse at North Fork; Samuel Prewett
has a posse under him at Table Mountain,
and the constable at Pollasky has had
guards stationed at the bridge on the San
Joaquin ever since the day of the jail
break. Unless the bandits have secured
help from an unknown source, they will
have to show themselves to get provisions.
The only person who returned with any
news from the hills to-day was Jailor
Wells. He started yesterday afternoon to
join the chase, but he had not gone far
before thÂ« wounds in his hand ana arm,
received in the struggle with the outlaws
on the night of the jail-break, caused the
member to swell to such a size that it be
came necessary for him to return.
The outlaws are surrounded in the foot
bills or else they have completely duped
the officers and have escaped into Auberry
Valley or crossed over the mountain range
in the snow into Mono or Inyo county.
Yesterday, when Deputy Sheriff Jones re
turned to the hills with the bloodhounds,
he succeeded in putting the dogs on the
trail which had been identified by Lily
Larsen, and the hounds started baying.
They set such a rapid pace tnat the offi
cers, who were well mounted, could not
keep up to them, as the dense growth of
! underbrush made it impossible to get
through the gulches at a very rapid pace.
They soon lost sight of Ye dogs, which
started in a southerly direction and circled
around the southern end of the Table
Mountain and then led off toward the San
Joaquin.
Some of the other men who were on the
lookout saw them, and, knowing that
they were trailing, followed them until
the dogs led them into a deserted sheep
camp, here the animals lost the trail,
as there were numberless tracks of the
herders. There was a stream a short dis
tance from the camp, and it is the theory
of the officers that Laverone and Roberts,
learning that the dogs were in pursnit of
them, walked in the water for some dis
tance to throw the dogs off the scent. The
officers took the dogs and patrolled both
sides of the stream, Doth above and below
the crossing, but the hounds were unable
to pick up the trail.

IRON MOUNTAIN ACCIDENT
A Redding Liveryman Hurled Over the
Edge of a Chasm.
REDDING, Cal., May 11.â J. If. Welsh,
a liveryman of this city, met with an acci
dent near the Iron Mountain mine last
evening that may cost him his life.
Welsh left this city at noon yesterday
with a mining man, bound for Iron Moun
tain. The two, in a buggy drawn by two
fiery horses, arrived at the copper mine of
the Mountain Mines Company at 4:30
o'clock. Welsh volunteered his cervices as
guide for his companion through the mine.
The works had been temporarily closed,
and he was advised by the mine authori
ties not to venture underground. Not
heeding the entreaties of the miners he
started on a tour of the subterranean
caverns.
That was the last seen of the two by em
ployes of. the mine. Two hours thereafter
their buggy, without team or driver, was
discovered about three miles below camp.
A diligent search resulted in the finding
of Welsh in a chasm below the road, which
was built on a high grade, bleeding and
suffering from severe injuries and gashes
on his head and body.
His horses had become unmanageable
and ran away. In their course down the
grade they ran against a tree and threw
the driver to the gulch below. He was
carried to a cabin, where he now lies in
the care of his wife.

GALE AT SANTA BARBARA
Trial Trip of the Battle-Ship
Oregon Likely to Be
Delayed.
Will Not B5 Sent Over the Course
Until the Wind Blows Less
Strongly.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May U.â lt
is blowing half a gale here to-day, and
unless there is an abatement the battle
| ship Oregon will not go on its trial trip to
morrow. The Oregon is now lying in the
channel, and while the other veEsels
1 heeled over to the blasts until they almost
I dipped their yards in the water it never
made a motion and seemed as firm us a
rock.
As the wind may die out to-night, Ad
rriral xteardslee believed it would bebet
tei to send the stakeboats to their posi
tions. The McArthur got away at day
break for its position near Point Concep
tion. The Albatross sailed next for Goleta
Point, but the Gedney was delayed over
I an hour by an order from the admiral to
j Captain Osbornc to "Come aboard!" It
i appears a mistake was made in the laying
out of the course, and the captain was
wanted to consult with the officers of the
navy in rectifying the error. After that
was accomplished, the little survey boat
went on its way. The men on the three
boats will have a lively time of it.
Admiral Beardslee and Irving M. Scott
went aboard the battle-ship this morning
I and will not leave it again until after the
trial. According to tne weather sharps
here this will not be fox three or four days,
as they say a gale here always lasts three
days. The only guests on board the Ore
gon are Mr. Small of Balfour, Guthrie &
Co.. General Graham of the Presidio, Dr.
Chismore and J. E. Tucker, United States
Appraiser at San Francisco. If it is de
cided not to send the battle-ship on its
trial to-morrow, Mr. Tucker will return
home on the first train.

ENJOYS ROYAL FAVOR.
Will Be Given One of the Finest
European Hotels in the
Orient.
HE WAS A SAN FRANCISCAN.
Won the Gratitude of the Japanese
by Generosity During the
Late War.
PORTLAND, Or., May 11.- William P.
Uardgrave of Seattle, who has just re
turned from Japan, is in this city. He
brings good tidings of Louis Eppinger,
formerly a leading caterer of Portland and
now perhaps the foremost American in
Yokohama. Hardgrave says that Eppin
p<er has for some years been mine host of
the principal European hotel in "Yoko
hama. He made the master stroke of his
life during the recent Chinese-Japanese j
war. During that period he manifested
more patriotism for Japan and practical
enthu.siasni over the Japanese successes
than any other foreigner, attracting the
attention of the Government. He con
tributed liberally to the Japanese sanitary
fund, which other Americans overlooked
as being no concern of theirs. Of this the
Mikado became cognizant, and he has
recently rewarded Eppinger's generosity.
"Mr. Eppinger does not refer to the im
perial favor he is enjoying," said Hard
grave, "but from one of his intimate
friends I learned that three months ago
he was commanded by the Mikado to
appear before him. Mr. Eppinger was
escorted to the palace, as if he were a high
dignitary, and was received without the
customary formality attendant upon an
audience granted foreigners. The Mikado,
so it is said, expressed his appreciation of
Mr. Eppinger's loyalty to tue Japanese
cause, and before dismissing him from his
august presence decorated him with an
order which bestows a certain rank of
nobility upon the recipient. 1 also heard
that it was his Imperial Highness' purpose
to build, out of his private purse, for Mr.
Eppinger, one of the finest European hotels
in the Orient, which shall be the lucky
fellow's own. tax and rent free for life.
At his death the property reverts to the
crown."
Durine the great stock-booming period
in fian Francisco Eppinger kept a small
saloon on Halleck street, which was the
favorite for California-street stocKbrokers.
For several years his receipts are alleged
to have averaged $1000 a day. But he was
not satisfied and engaged in stock gam
bling, which also made him rich for a
time, but in the end he fell by the way
side, like many others, and he came to
Portland in 1885.
SELMA BURGLAR KILLED
William Burke Shot to Death
by Oificer Collins Near
Merced.
He Had Escaped From a Deputy Con
stable by Jumping From a
Train.
MERCED, Cal., May 11.â William
Burke, who escaped from a Selma officer
last Monday night at Livingston, was shot
and killed this evening near Merced by
Deputy Constable Collins.
Burke was wanted at Selma for burg
lary, and was arrested in San Francisco by
Detective Harper. Deputy Constable Col
lins went to the City to bring back the pris
oner. On his return the officer went to
sleep, and Burke jumped from the train
and escaped, with his hands still man
acled.
Burke was seen this afternoon leaving
Merced walKing towards Bear Creek. He
whs followed by Officers Collins and Dowst.
"When they got within hailing distance
they commanded him to stop. Burke
started to run. Collins flred two shots in
the air to frighten Burke, but the latter
drew a pistol and nred at me officer. Then
Collins fired directly at him, a bullet
taking effect in the fugitive's side, causing
instant death.
The officers returned to town and re
ported the affair to the Coroner, who went
out and took charge or the body. Burke
was about 38 years of age.

.reservation was burned and the body of
Mrs. Mary J. Platt, the reservation teacher,
was incinerated in the fire. Mrs. Platt
had living rooms in connection with the
s>cliool building. She was alone, except
for a niece, a little girl 9 years old.
The latter was awakened about 11 o'clock
at night by fire on her bed. She called
to Mr?. Platt, but got no response, and as
she went out thiough the kitchen she saw
a pile of wood burning there and smelled
kerosene oil.
Antonio Molido was arrested last autumn
on a charpe of complicity in the crime
and Inter made a confession implicating
the thrre whose trial has just ended.
Molido's story was that the four went to
Mrs. Platt's house, rapped at the door, ana
when she responded clutched her by the
throat, dragged her out of the house to a
lonely spot some yards distant, and killed
her to cover si more diabolical crime. They
took her lifeless body back to the house,
built a large pile of oak stovewood around
it and set fire to the wood.
Upon Moiido's confession he was sen
tenced to life imprisonment in San Quen
tin.
CONFLAGRATION AT APTOS.
The Entire Village Narrowly Escapes De
struction â Hard Work Saves the
Ocean House.
APTOS, Cal., May 12.â Fire that started
in the grocery-store of D. M. Rice & Son,
in this town, shortly after midnight this
morning destroyed a blacksmith-shop and
Hihm's saloon. The loss on the latter two
buildings was about $700 and on Rice &
Son's store and stock $2200.
The fire burned so rapidly that the
Ocean House narrowly escaped destruc
tion; in fact, but for the hard labor of
every man and boy in Aptos the entire
village would have been swept away.

HOW BISHOP SEGERS DIED
Frank Fuller Confesses to the
Killing of the Prelate
Years Ago. â¢
Says They Quarreled Over a Klootch
man and He Took His
Enemy's Life.
TACOMA, Wash., May ILâ Frank Ful
ler, sentenced at Sitka on December 2,
1887, to ten years at the FÂ«deral peniten
tiary on McNeils Island, near here, for the
murder of Bishop Segers, a Roman Catho
lic ecclesiastic of Nisqually, was released
to-day, his term, with the customary de
ductions for good behavior, having ended.
For the first time since his arrest he to-day
broke his long silence and spoke of the
crime, doing so guardedly.
"The Bishop," said he, "was not the
man his friends believed him to be. We
had trouble over an Indian woman â a
Klootchman. It came to a situation where
it was either his life or mine. Mine was
as sweet to me as his to him. 1 came back
to the settlement; his body was found in
the camp. That is all I will say."
The murder of Bishop Segers caused a
great sensation in 1887. The prelate was
one of the most distinguished men in the
church on this coast. The diocese of
Nisqually embraces the western part of
this State. Bishop Segers left here with
Fuller as his private secretary and com
panion to visit the missions in Alaska.
Fnr up in the Yukon country they were
camped one night. The Indian guides
were temporarily absent. Wh^n they re
turned they found the Bishop murdered
and Fuller gone.
Fuller stopped at Juneau and did not
attempt to leave the Territory. He was
arrested, tried at Sitka and convicted of
manslaughter. He refused to testify in
his own behalf or to explain. The de
fense tried to show that Indians com
mitted the murder. A strong sentiment
in favor of Fuller existed in the Territory
among certain whites, but others de
manded a relentless prosecution. Many
believed him innocent.
For the past seven years Fuller has been
trusty at the penitentiary and won the re
spect and regard of every official there.
He maintained absolute silence as to the
murder and rarely spoke on the subject
He was termed "TheSileiit Man" and was
a star convict. He acted as a house ser
vant, and while he had many cbances
to escape he held aloof. Faller is tall and
dignified of bearing, wears a Vandyke
beard, has mild blue eyes, and even in
convict stripes was a striking figure. He
says he will remain in Tacoma and live
down the blot on his character.

A resolution protesting against the en
actment of the funding bill and requesting
the representatives of California at Wash
ington to work against the bill was passed
this afternoon by an overwhelming vote.
Resolutions on county road control were
offered by R. H. Pringle, B. K. Knight and
others. They are the same as recently
adopted by a convention in Santa Cruz.
Among the principal recommendations
are that laws be enacted so that all roads
be built and maintained by a direct tax,
including all county and trunk lines ; that
the roads in any district be built and
maintained by taxes raised in that dis
trict. They also recommend creating the
office of road expert, who shall pass upon
the construction of roads in the county in
which he shall be appointed, and have
general supervision of the highways un
der the direction of the Board of Super
visors, his term of office to be until re
moved.
Among the duties devolving on him
would be to survey the roads, to see that
work is done practically and economically
and to direct a road foreman in each dis
trict whose duties should be in the same
line. In the draft of the proposed bill it is
recommended that all funds now in the
hands of Boards of Supervisors and under
their control be left so. The tax in any
district is to be raised by the board when
two-thirds of the taxpayers have peti
tioned for it, and when after so petitioned
the board deems it advisable. It is recom
mended that property-owners be com
pelled to keep down weeds on the fence
line and in the ditches along the roads,
when once the Boards of Supervisors have
cut them down. If the law should be
adopted property-owners will also have to
move their fences on either side an equal
distance from the middle of the accus
tomed wagon track, if the fence lines are
not well defined, and a clause is tacKed on
making it unlawful to use wagon-tires of
less than certain width.
These resolutions, with one favoring
ing Government ownership of the Nica
ragua canal, were referred to the commit
tee on resolutions.
The convention will be in session to
morrow, and on Wednesday the delegates
will be taken for a drive over the roads of
the county.
BOOTH'S VOLUNTEERS
Important Acquisition* to the Post at
San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 11.-The number
of followers of Ballington Booth in this
city is constantly growing and several im
portant accessions to the ranks of the local
post of the American Volunteers have
recently been received. The latest addi
tion to their strength is Mrs. Lizzie Rief,
formerly a well-known sergeant in, the
Balvation Army and one of its best
workers. Mrs. Rief is one of the oldest
poldiers on the coast, having enlisted in
the array in San Jose years ago. Shortly
afterward she became a trusted officer in
its ranks and has had charge of a number
of the most important places on the coast.
She retired from active field service a few
years ago and has since been one of the
faithful standbys of the local corps. Since
the trouble she, in common with the ma
jority of the corps, has been undecided as
to the proper course to pursue until now.
Sergeant John Phillips, another old
eoldier and a faithful local officer in the
army, has also expressed himself very
favorably for the volunteers, and it is ex
pected will Boon enlist under the volun
teer standard.
Captain James Smith, the new leader,
will take charge this week, at which time
a grand rally will be held.
The post has been made the recipient of
a floe American flag, by a number of the
citizens, and it will be formally presented
on the occasion of the new captain's ap
pearance.
The local workers are now in corres
pondence with fourteen places where posts
are to be organized as soon as Ballington
Booth comes to the coast. Four of the
leading field officers of the old army have
also expressed themselves in favor "of the
movement, and will enlist as soon as the
commander formally organizes this State,
ana others are contemplating the same
step.
BANDIT MILLER SENTENCED
Twelve Tears of His Life to Be Spent at
Folsom Prison.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May ILâ George
Miller, the highwayman who escaped
from Officer Monroe on February 20 and
exchanged a fusilade of shots with a half
dozen officers at First and Santa Clara
streets, in this city, was this morning sen
tenced to twelve years' imprisonment at
Folsom by Judge Lorigan for assaulting
Monroe with intent to murder.
Miller held up Charles Berryman on the
Los Gatqs road on February 20 and re
lieved nim of a gold watch and some
money. Later in the evening he was ar
rested by Constable Haley on suspicion of
being the robber. At the corner of First
and Santa Clara streets Haley turned
Miller over to Monroe, while he went in
search of Berryman to identify the man.
As soon as Haley had taken a few steps
Miller broke away from Mouroe and fired
two shots at him, one bullet going through
Monroe's coat-s!eeve. Tne highwayman
then started down the street, and a run
ning fight ensued, but Miller escaped in
the darkness. A month later he was ar
rested at Bakersfield. The charge of rob
bery was never pressed, as the identifica
tion was not complete.
Miller is an ex-convict, and pleaded
guilty to a prior conviction.

TOUTHEDS INDENDLARIES.
Three Lads Arraigned for Setting Fire
in a House.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May Jl.â Three
youthful firebugs were arraigned before
Justice Gass this afternoon on a charge of
arson. They were Gussia Brechtel, aged

aged 12 and 7 respectively. After rec eiv
mg a good lecture, the elder two boys

them.
About three weeks ago the boys burned
a deserted house on the Cottle ranch on
the Monterey road, causing a loss of about
$500.
PARISH AGAINST PASTOR.
A Noted Boston Minister Who Refuses
Either to Resign or Submit to a
Reduction of Salary.
BOSTON, Mass., May 11.â There is a
lively contest on at the famous old "Brim
stone corner" between the parish and
pastor, the like of which probably has
never been seen before in the noted Park
street Congregational Church. The soci
ety wants the Rev. Isaac J. Lansing to
resign his pastorate, but he refuses.
Dr. Lansing is the man who achieved
National notoriety not long ago by pub
licly chaigine that President Cleveland
drank too much. He also publicly de
nounced Governor Greenhalge. His salary
has been reduced to $2000 For three years.
he has been getting $7000 a year. This is
the largest salary paid in Boston. There
is a deficit of $4500 in the church finances
this year.
A stormy meeting was held last week,
but the facts did not get out until yester
day. When a motion for the pastor's
resignation was introduced Lansing imme
diately declared with great vehemence his
great indignation that such a motion was
presented in such a way. He declared
that it would have no weight or effect with
him, and that he should retuse absolutely
to resign or submit to a reduction of sal
ary, no matter what action was taken at
that time relative to the motion. Then he
left the room in great anger.
After he had gone a vote was taken de
manding his resignation. It is understood
Lansing has taken legal advice, and that
he maintains that the only way to force
him out is by a council. In order to ob
tain this council the aociety, church and
pastor must unite in a call. If the pastor
refuses to do this the council cannot be
convened. In other words, the claim is
that he can remain as long as he chooses.
A PUZZLING INQUIRY
What Will Uncle Sam Charge for Dock
ing an English Warship?
NEW YORK. N. V., May 11.â A Times
special from Washington says: It is un
derstood that a British warship will be
docked at the Puget Sound drydock. Some
inquiry has come from Canadian officials
regarding the charge for docking an Eng
lish ship. Such a request from the Brit
ish Government is a novelty to the Navy
Department. That Government is so well
supplied with clocking facilities that it
rarely has to depend upon the courtesy of
other nations for such service.
The United States frequently asks for
the privilege of docking ships at foreign
docks. The charge usually made for
docking a warship is sufficient to cover
the cost of running the pumping plant and
the necessary incidental expense of filling
and emptying and refilling the dock. In
the case of a merchant ship the regular
charge for docking is made by the Govern
ment owning the dock.
In the case of the Puget Sound struc
ture there may be some delay in docking
a foreign ship as the dock does not yet
belong to the Government. It is still the
property of the contractors and their per
mission must be obtained before the docK
can be used.
The Greater Sew Torn Bill Signed.
ALBANY, N. V., May 11.â Governor
Morton has signed the greater New York
bill.
MUST STAND THE ISSUE
The "Supreme Court Refuses a
Rehearing in the Case of
Theodore F. Brown.
Traffic Managers Who Violate the
Interstate Laws To Be Held
Responsible.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.â The
Supreme Court to-day refused a rehearing
in the case of Theodore F. Brown, general
auditor of the Allegheny Railroad at Pitts
burg Pa., who is charged with having
granted rebates to the Union Coal Com
pany. The court will now issue a man
date, and its opinion handed down a few
weeks ago will stand. This is a cause
celebre in railroad circles, and is of inter
est to railroad traffic people everywhere in
the country. Brown was chareea with
having in his official capacity specially fa
vored the Union Coal Company, but when
called upon by the Interstate Commerce
Commission to testify as to the facts he
refused to do so.
He was sent to jail for his refusal, but
was subsequently released on a writ of
habeas corpus. The case was taken to the
United States Supreme Court, which af
firmed the decision of the lower court
ordering Brown to testify as to the facts.
It will be seen that railroad traffic officials
charged with violating the provisions of
thejinterstate law can no longer hope to
screen themselves behind the plea that
their testimony might incriminate them,
but that they will have to testify, failing
to do which they will be committed to jail,
just as General Auditor Brown has feared.
BERING SEA TREATY
Ratifications About to Be Formally Ex-
changed With Great Britain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.â It is
understood that Embassador Bayard and
the representative of the Foreign Office
will formally exchange ratifications in
London to-day or to-morrcw of the Bering
Sea sealing claims arbitration treaty,
which was amended by the Senate April
15. Promptly following this formality it
is expected that the President will appoint
the American arbitrator and that a Cana
dian will be appointed to represent Great
Britain.
Under the terms of the treaty the two
arbitrators will meet as soon as the cases
are ready for consideration at Victoria, B.
C, to determine damages accruing to
Canadian sealing vessels in the Bering Sea
prior to the Paris tribunal.
Under the provisions of this new con
vention the two arbitrators will take testi
mony at San Francisco if the cases cannot
all be completed at Victoria and they will
then report their findings to their respec
tive Governments! Wnere their recom
mendations agree the claims will be
promptly settled, but if any disagreements
occur such cases will be delivered to the
President of the Swiss republic, wtio has
consented to decide disputed points.
A COMING EVENT FORESHADOWED
Gray Gables Keing Overhauled for the
Reception of Mrs. Cleveland.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.â When
the assertion was made a few days ago that
the President's house at Gray Gables had
been put in readiness for the family ; that
the President's favorite boat was being
overhauled, and that even the fish seemed
to be eagerly waiting for his appearance,
it was also viven out that Mrs. Cleveland
and the children would go to their house
on the shores of Buzzards Bay earlier this
year than usual.
The knowing ones smiled when they
heard that Mrs. Cleveland was about to re
tire from Washington society, and said
that Marion would soon be two years old.
The intervals ber.yeen the children in the
Cleveland family have so far been about
two years in each case, and gossips say
that the next interval will be about the
same; that the interesting event will take
place in July.
For a Monetary Conference.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 11.â Mr.
Corliss of Michigan offered in the House
to-day a resolution requesting the Presi
dent to invite the leading commercial na
tions of the world to join in an interna
tional monetary conference, to be held as
early as practicable. The proposed confer
ence is to be held in Washington, and
$100,000 is appropriated for defraying ex
penses.
Sot This Session.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 11.âHub
bard of Missouri, who made tae mimority
report on Powers' funding bill, states posi
tively that the bill will not be considered
at this session. He gets his information
from a Representative who talked with
Speaker Reed. Senator White said to-day:
"No, the funding bill will not come up
this session. The Santa Monica project
has knocked it out."
LIKE BASQGO'S GHOST.
The Brown Case Sow Bobs Up Before
Chicago i'ongregationalists.
CHICAGO, 111., May 11.â A surprise
was sprung at the close of the regular
meeting of the Congregational ministers
of Chicago to-day when Rev. J. F. Loba,
secretary and chairman of the business
committee, introduced in a short speech a
resolution that a committee of five be ap
pointed to review the action of the Bay
Conference of Caliornia in suspending
from the ministry Rev. Charles O. Brown,
D.D., of the First Congregational Church
of San Francisco, after he had been found
not guilty of the charge of immorality by

pathetic scene within the walls of the State
Penitentiary to-day when Mrs. Frances
Brant, who, last August, shot and killed

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
It is our turn to have a frolic.
We ought to have a fiesta just to cap the
climax.
The latest breeze from Cuba may yet be
a storm before it blows over.
About as soon as the Democrats find a
Presidential candidate they find that he is
a quitter.
I The Populists have the undivided atten

use it well.
This country stood the Virginius out

A San Francisco fiesta has a sweet al
literative sound that would go trippingly
on every tongue.
To get all the news of the campaign you
must get The Call and read the United
Press dispatches.
Even Bonrbon Democrats have their
sensibilities and refuse to hurrah for a de
ficit administration.
Let us invite the queen? of all the festi
vals of the State to come to town and
show their pretty gowns.
Getting the people used to the transfer
nuisance is about the same as getting eels
used to being ssinned alive.
Perhaps General AVeyler would like a
war with the United States in order to get
Uncle Sam to help him out of Cuba.
The best possible fusion for intelligent
Populists is to fuse with the party of
~p"Htrie!isrfl, "protection and prosperity.
If the Chicago convention cannot find a
Democratic candidate it might take a
mugwump. There are few of them stiil

The hot hostility of Germany against
British aggression in South Africa is called
by diplomatists "an attitude of cold neu

In his adventures with his brother-in

California will have another feather in her
cap to be proud of.
When Xansen gets home from the north

The delegate who walked to the Populist
Convention from Sonoma evidently be
lieves that victory over the railroad can be
gained in a walk-over.
The only proper fusion for free silver
men of any party is with ttie Republicans,
for only they are in a position to win the
( battle for bimetallism this year.
There is reason to believe that some of
the Eastern prediction bureaus are not only
counting chickens before they are hatched,
but eggs before they are laid.
It may be true that by a vigorous Cuban
i policy Cleveland could make sure of a re
w nomination, but it is doubtful if the old
a man has tnat much vigor in him.
n According to all the prospects of the

body of the kind that ever assembled.
{As Delaware has declared for Quay, the

from the Presidential race was evidently
intended solely for Western consumption.
To have a festival that would sum up
'all the glories of Santa Barbara, Los An

and Healdsburg would make a frolic just
about our size.
Even those citizens who ure roost eagei

In threatening to shoot the American;

Weyler is pitching such an easy ball to tht

Democrats who have been hoping the
Populists would help them out will
find little pleasure in the Sacramento con
vention. The delegates to that body are
not willing to be dumped into political de
ficit this year.

?~j trie man who stands for National pros
perity.
THE POPULIST CONVENTION.
The Populist convention at Bacramento
will have during its sessions the undi
vided attention of the State. It has not
been a very strong party in tbe past, and
its chances of carrying California have
been remote, but in the present demoral
ized condition of the Democratic party
there is something more than a possibility
that it will show a largely increased
vote in this campaign and may rank on
election day as the second party in the
State.
In estimating the elements of its
strength no observant man can overlook
the earnest zeal which inspires so large a
portion of its members. There are in it,
of course, many of those erratic men who
shift and change lightly from one party to
another by lack of any fixed principles of
action. There are also, of course, many of
the disappointed otlice-seekers of other
parties, who have joined it in the hope of
personal advancement. These, however,
are comparatively few in number, and
though being in the main given to much
verbosity and able to occupy a large part
of the discussions at Populist meetings,
are by no means so influential as they
appear from their speeches. This conven
tion we may be sure will be dominated by
earnest men, and whatever they under
take to do will be done with the zeal of re
formers who will not compromise prin
ciples for the sake of electing an ottice
seeker or two to some minor positions.
The line between the earnest supporters
of Populist principles and the mere office
seeking element can be easily drawn. The
earnest men stand for a straight-out con
test for the principles to which they are
devoted. The seekers after spoils, on the
other band, are willing to compromise,
combine, fuse, and even confuse, witn any
other party or set of men that promises to
give them a vote and help obtain the
spoils. This dividing line will be seen at
Sacramento, as it is seen at every Populist
convention, but there seems every pros
pect that the earnest men will win, and
the party lines remain intact.
It cannot be denied that in the demoral
ization of Democracy Populism has a great
opportunity. From the disorganized and
discouraged ranks of the old foe it can
draw many recruits if it acts boldly and
refuses compromise. If, however, it makes
any alliance with the party of G rover
Cleveland, it is lost. This the convention
at Sacramento will probably see, and act
accordingly. Even if it fails to see it, how
ever, no great harm can be done. The
platform of the Republican party is good
enough for every intelligent Populist to
stand on, and if his own party should
blunder in convention he can easily rem
edy the evil so far as he is concerned by
voting for the men who represent patriot
ism, protection ana prosperity.
A NEEDED PARK.
It is encouraging to observe that Park
Commissioner Austin, president of the
board, is strongly in favor of establishing a
park for the people of the Mission. lie
makes a suggestion that is eminently de
serving of attention. It is that part of the
thirty-six acres comprised in Buena Vista
Park be sold under the authorization of the
Legislature, and that the proceeds be de
voted to the purchase and improvement of
a park for the Mission residents. As lie
properly says, Buena Vista Park is so near
Golden Gate Park that the improvement
of the whole tract would not be a distinct
advantage to the City, its only special
value being tne great elevation of its
highest part. This is 510 feet, and the
reservation and improvement of a tract
including it would serve all the useful
purposes which the entire tract is capable
of developing. The absence of water at
that great elevation must for some time
remain a barrier to its improvement.
This opens a way for the Supervisors to
furnish the Mission with a recreation
place, of which it stands greatly in need.
It will be necessary only to ask the Legis
lature to pass the act authorizing the sa!e.
The superior attractions of the lower
reaches of Buena Vista Park for residence
purposes are bound to produce ready pur
chasers for the property, as water can be
furnished and the view is one of the finest
in the City. The reservation of the high
est part and the erection of an observatory
upon it would serve as an additional at
traction to buyers.
Whatever may be the method adopted
for introducing a park to the Mission,
such a resort must be furnished. Mr.
Austin's suggestion is particularly ac
ceptable in view of the fact that it con
templates no addition to tne tax levy and
will likely not meet with objection from
any source. It is true that in years gone
by great public injury has been inflicted
by legislative acts authorizing the sale of
public lands in this City, but with so
many existing agencies for the prevention
of fraud there i 3 a reasonable assurance
that nothing wrong will be attempted.
The present distribution of parks in the
City is about as unfair as it could possibly
be. The section north of Market street
has no more parks than it needs, but that
is no reason for their virtual absence on
the south side of the City. It is to the
interest of all the people to unite in some
action to secure this desirable result.
THE SUGAR INDUSTRY.
Tne article on the beet-sugar industry of
California which appeared in the last
issue of Thomas Magee & Sons' Real
Kstate Circular deserves the attention of
all sections of the State where it may be
possible to cultivate the sugar beet. It is
a fact familiar to all that Claus Spreckels
has a standing offer to the whole State to
furnish beet seeds and full instructions for
cultivation to all who will make experi
ments to ascertain whether their land is
suited to the crop. In case a sufficient
body of land in any section is found to be
adapted to the beet Mr. Spreckels will
erect a factory, buy the crop at a profit
able figure and manufacture it into sugar.
As only a small part of each farmer's land
would be required for the experiment,
and the crop is an annual and the result
of the experiment is ascertainable in a
single year, it would seem that the offer
should prove tempting to the more pro
gressive farmers of the State.
Majjee's Circular quotes Mr. Spreckels as
saying that he hoDes his life will be spared
long enough to see the State making not
only all of our beet sugar, but exporting
$ 50.000,000 worth more of it to the Atian^
tic States; then he would die content,
"and," said he with emphasis, '-we can
easily do that within a few years." The
East now imports between $75,000,000 and
$100,000,000 worth of sugar, nearly all of
which, Mr. SprecKels says, California can
easily make. Mr. Spreckels also told his
friends that he had repeatedly been of
fered $10,000,000 by New York capitalists,
with whom he has had previous dealings.
They want the money invested in Cali
fornia, in his full charge and unhampered
direction. While Mr. Spreckels is in Eu
rope he will inspect the great sugar fac
tories of France and Germany, ana see if
they have any improvement in machinery
and methods which may be of use to him.
An interesting feature of the matter is
that the lands which have been used for
grain are often be found to be perfectly
i suited to sugar beets. Thus, not long ago ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1896.
Mr. Bpreckels bought 6000 acres of land
within reach of his Watsonville sugar fac
tory in addition to his formor holdings.
This land has long been used for wheat,
barley and oats, and it is needless. to in
form a California farmer that a compar
ison between the returns on sugar beets
and grain is impossible. If all the grain
lands in California should be converted
into sugar-beet farms it would not be dif
ficult to imagine the effect on the pros
perity of the State.
The Circular publishes these important
facts: "Beet culture has only begun, and
its extension will withdraw from wheat
growing immense tracts in the San Joa
quin and Sacramento valleys, while, by
reducing the wheat area, it will tend to
better the price of that staple. Beets grown
in France and Germany yield 8 to 10 per
cent of sugar only; here our lands yield
14 to 18 per cent, and without special fer
tilization. There, but for Government
bounties, the business could not be made
successful. "\Vnen California gets to manu
facturing $50,000,000 worth of beet sugar
lor annual export East tbe shipment of re
lined sugar to Atlantic ports from Ger
many and France, on which there is a
heavy import duty, will greatly decline, if
it does not entirely cease."
A MATTER OF NEWS.
The summary of the news regarding the
progress of the Presidential campaign
which was sent out from tbe East on Sun
day nignt affords another of the many
illustrations of the superiority of tbe
United Press dispatches over those of its
rival, the Associated Press. This superior
ity does not consist merely in amplitude
of reports, but in that accuracy of state
ment which is necessary to give the reader
a comprehensive knowledge of the condi
tion of affairs.
In the particular instance to which at
tention is called our morning contempor
aries, both of which receive Associated
Press dispatches, gave exactly the same
news regarding the prospects of the vote
at the St. Louis convention. Both gave
the estimates made by Congressman
Grosvenor and neither gave any more.
The Call, on the other hand, gave not
only the statement of Grosvenor as fully
as the other papers, but also equally full
estimates and statements from ex-Senator
Platt and Congressman Aldrich.
How important it is for the reader to
have all these statements before him in
order to reach a true knowledge of the con
dition of affairs can be made evident by a
simple recapitulation of the estimates
themselves. According to Grosvenor's
bulletin, which constituted all the news
on this subject given by the Associated
Tress, there are 483 uncontested and
pledged votes for McKinley already
elected, and, inclnding the contested votes,
548. By this showing McKinley would be
nominated on the first ballot. According
to Platt's estimates, however, McKinley
is at present 145 votes Bhort of the 460
necessary to nominate, while Congress
man Aldrich allows him 361 votes uncon
tested, or 90 less than a majority and 127
less than Grosvenor claims.
It will lie seen that the additional facts
given by the United Press and ignored by
the Associated Press reveal the condition
of the Presidential contest under a wholly
different aspect. People who wish to
know the truth must of course get reports
from all sides, a3 the United Press does.
The Call, being the only morning paper
in San Francisco that receives the United
Press dispatches, is the only one that
gives the fullness of news essential to an
accurate understanding of what is coiner
on. It is therefore plain that whatever
other paper a man may take he must read
The Call also if tie wishes to get all the
news and keep himself posted.
A MARE'S NEST.
The biggest mare's nest discovered thus
far during tne cumpaigri is to be found
in the rumor that the report of the
committee of credentials at the Sacra
mento convention was never adopted by
the convention itself. It must be admitted
that if this discovery can be established in
truth it will be something worth clamor
ing about, for if the report of tbe commit
tee was not adopted then no credentials
were approved, no delegate had a right to
a seat, the convention was an unorganized
mass-meeting and the whole thing will
have to be done over again.
Fortunately the alleged discovery can
be easily proved to be false. The report of
the committee on credentials was adopted
in due form and order by the necessary
vote. The work of the convention was all
right from beginning to end. As a
matter of fact the very issue was
raised in the convention itself and was
disposed of in short order by the state
ment of Chairman Arthur that the report
had been adopted. The columns of all our
newspapers containing reports of the con
vention show this to be the fact, the whole
snbsequent proceedings of the conven
tion attest it, and the minutes of
secretary record it. If the seats of any of
the California delegation are to be con
tested at St. Louis the contestants will
have to get better grounds than that.
The men who will form the National Con
vention will have too much work on hand
to waste time investigating a mare's nest.

LADY'S CHEMISE.
A graceful shape which hangs from a rquare
yoke is a much liked style of chemise. The
yoke may be of embroidery lace or tne goods.
A ruffle of lace gathered at the edge with baby
ribbon is a novel mode of trimming the arm
size.
Dainty garments of batiste exquisitely made
by hand have very fine embroidered insertion
for a yoke, edited with fine Val. lace on both
sides. Others have rows of inch-wide inser
Uon, with narrow lace insertion between
These are sewn together in long strips and
folded at the corners of yoke. A yoke of lace
insertion alone is not quite so serviceable, but
is very pretty. This is often finished, at the
edges with lace braiding, through which baby
ribbon is run. At the edge of this braiding is
a frill of lace to match the insertion, tbe lace
used varying from half an inch to four inches
in width. This trimming is especially liked
on lawn chemises. Muslin is more often
trimmed with embroidery of torchon lace.
Point de Paris is a desirable lace for lawn,
cambric and muslin, as it wears well.
CONSIDERABLY BRIGHTENED.
The Kern Standard.
Thk Call and the Report, the most influen
tial morning and evening papers, respectively,
in San Francisco, have come out flat-footed for
woman suffrage and will use their best endeav
ors to compass the success of the eleventh
amendment The Republican State Conven
tion also passed a resolution favoring it, and
the prospect of its adoption is considerably
brightened.
RAPIDLY ADVANCED.
Seattle Times.
Pacific Coast journalism seems to have re
ceived a new impetus from the San Francisco
Call. A year ago The Call was but little
known outside of the city in which it is pub
lished, but from the time C. M. Shortridge be
came its publisher it has rapidly advanced un
til it is a strong rival of the other San Fran
cisco dailies and excels them in many respects.
The Call bears eloquent testimony of what
journalistic ability, combined with unlimited
capital, may do in a field already occupied by
established newspapers.
NO FUNDING BILL IN OURS.
Fresno .Republican.
The Republicans of California in convention
assembled did many judicious and commend
able things, but among them all not one was
wiser than the adoption of the autl-funding
resolution. Without tout plank the many
merits of the platform would have seemed ob
scure to a great many of the voters of the
BtatÂ«; to their minds the other excellencies
would hardly have compensated for such a
"one thing missing." The funding bill is a
live issue in Californiaâ one of the livest of
issues, in factâ and no omission by any party
can make it anything else. We firmly believe
that a failure to have passed the resolution
would have cost the party thousands of votes
In this State jn tne coming election.
THE BIDWELL AND FIELD OAKS.
San Francisco Post.
A contemporary tells a story of an oak tree at
Monterey, which, It declares, outrivals the
glories of the Sequoia gigantea. It calls this
oak the Justice Field Oak, because its unusual
spread of branches was first noticed by
Timothy J. Field, a nephew of the Justice of
tba* name. The account puts the cap-sheaf
of emphasis on the magnitude cf the oak by
saying that 1000 people could stand under its
boughs. The Monterey oak may be a ronser,
but it is a Fcrub compared to an oak tree
growing on the ranch of General Bidwell at
cnico. This oak was visited twenty Â»years ago
by General William Tecumseh Sherman in
company with Sir Joseph Hooker, the English
botanist, who declared the oak to be the
largest in the world, and General Sherman,
after due deliberation, said that 7000 men
could stand on tne area inclosed w;thin a circle
arawn around the extreme points of the ex
tended boughs of the tree. Whoever doubts
this statement is at liberty to visit the oak,
measure the spread of its branches and make
hie own computation. The Bidwe.l onk is un
doubtedly the largest tree of its species in the
world.
A KINDLY ACT.
Los Angelea Labor Worli.
The San Francisco Call last Monday con
tained a three-column review of the growth of
trades unions in Los Angeles. A iaetropolitan
paper that will devote this amount of space to
organized labor in a sister city demonstrates
its friendliness to the interests of labor. Ac
companying the sketch were the photographs
of officers of the Council of Labor, President P.
McXamara, Secretaries H. E. Martens and E.
R. Holman, President Booth of the Clerks' As
sociutiou and President J. H. McWilliams of
the Labor Congress. The Call, under the
present management, has at all times been
friendly to organized labor, a position duly
appreciated, both in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. That was a kindly act on its part
when it agreed to dispense with the type-set
ting machines for two years upon a concession
of the San Francisco Typographical Union of a
reduction in scale. This last act in opening
its columns for a review of the growth of the
different trades unions in Los Angeles in still
another evidence of The Call's friendship for
organized labor.
MY LADY'S HAT.
Mysterious Thing!
Composed of frills and feathers, ribbons, lace.
And flowers, and birds, and vegetable things,
And imitation jewelry and beads,
Anil buckles, wire and silk, and cotton bombazine,
And Lord knows what besides;
I wot not what they may be.
Inordinate Thing!
Stupendous, thou, and vast beyond clear compre
hension.
Thou Â«oarest like some heaven-kissing hill,
Thou spreadest like a banyan tree.
Prodigious, am pie, large, indefinite In size,
Enormous, huge, immense, colossal, bigâ
Thou measureu much too much to reckon up.
Tmbrageons Thing !
The shadows 'neath thy spreading trim
Are Stygian in their darkness.
Thou wardest off the brightest rays
Of noonday sun, electric light, or gas.
Methiuka thou art proof against the Roentgen ray.
Kxacerbatlng Thing!
I sit behind the at the play,
And holding myself together, not with ease.
So monstrous iÂ» the rage that rends my soul.
Innocuous, all the dear, delightful naughtiness
Displayed upon the stageâ but not for me.
Unseen, the beauties of the ballet face,
And I, who paid two prices for my seat,
sit. cursing, crying, wringing hands
In anguish, all because of thee.
Beloved Tning!
My lady loves thee, and I needs must, too.
Those errant whims that lead her fancy, far
Beyond the limits of my feebler wit.
Suilirient ure to justify worse things than thou.
So. though my heart is faint within me, when
I ponder thy preposterous character,
I still do love thee for that thou art hers.

TO SAVE LIVES AT SEA
A Bill Now Before the Senate
for a Station Near Point
Bonita.
IT WILL COST OVEB $10,000.
Major Blakeney Gives Some Interest
ing Facts Abont tbe Stations
on This Coast.
Rodeo Lagoon, immediately north of
Point Bonita, is to have a life-saving sta
tion fitted with all modern appliances for
handling boats, including launching-ways.
At least, a bill authorizing a station at
that point has passed the lower house of
Congress and is now before the Senate for
consideration. The measure was intro
duced by Senator Perkins April 29, and
there is little doubt of its ultimate passage.
"The need of a station at this point is
obvious," said Major T. J. Blakeney of the
"United States Life-saving Service yester
day. "This side of the Golden Gate is
well protected, but there is absolutely
nothing in the way of a lifeboat on the
other side nearer than Point Reyes. Under
the present condition, if a wreck occurs on
the northern shore it is necessary for a
boat to pull across the channel. Quite
often it is impossible to do so, owing to
the heavy winds. I recall the wreck of
the Elizabeth, when tne life-saving crew
lost a man on this very shore, and
later, in the wreck of the Simpson, only a
merciful God prevented a whole boatload
of brave fellows from going to the bottom.
"It is not every one who knows iust how
the Jife-saving stations are distributed on
this immediate coast. At Fort Point, for
instance, we can get out a boat at any
time. This station ia inside the Presidio
reservation. Just back of the lighthouse
is a lookout, where a constant watch is
kept. The station is fitted with signal
flags and pyrotechnical signals to be used
only when vessels are in distress. In the
bight, near the mouth of Point Lobos
Creek, there is a boathouse containing all
necessary gear. This is available when it
is impossible to launch a boat south of the
Cliff House. On Point Lobos there is an
other lookout where constant watch is
kept. In a southerly direction, one and a
half miles, is the Golden Gate life-saving
station with a full crew. Three and a
half miles south of this is the Southside
station, and three quarters of a mile fur
ther on is a lookout station.
"These stations and lookouts are all con
nected by telephone with each other and
with the district superintendent's office.
Any vessel requiring the services of a tug
or otherwise in distress would receive
prompt attention should they signal to
that effect.
"To the northward of this harbor, as
stated belore, there is not a life-saving sta
tion nearer than Point Reyes. Some years
ago the station at Bolinas Bay was burned
down, but the location not being desir
able, it was not thought wise to rebuild it.
â¢'A station near Point Bonita is espe
cially desirable, because it is a lee shore in
all southerly winds. The proposed station
will be connected by telephone with the
life-saving system on this side of the
Golden Gate, thus perfecting the service
which guards the entrance to the harbor of
San Francisco."
The station at Rodeo Lajjoon. near Point
Bonita, will cost between $10,000 and $12,
-000. Congress appropriates every year
$50,000 for new life-saving stations, and as
soon as the present bill passes tbe Senate
work will commence on the Point Bonita
station.
WILL LEAVE HIS PULPIT
The Pastor of the Welsh Presby
terian Church Going to
Wales.
His Wife's Failing Health Compels
Him to Abandon His Work in
a Hopeful Era.
The Rev. R. Vaoghan Griffith, who for
tbe last five years has served as pastor of
the Welsh Presbyterian Church of this
City, will give up his work and leave for
Wales next month.
Yesterday, during an executive session
of the Presbytery, he applied for letters of
introduction to the church brethren in
Wales and received them, although his
formal release from the church has not
yet been effected. It is necessary, as a
matter of form, to have the congregation
concur with the pastor in his request to
the Presbytery to release him from hia
church.
The congregation will act next Sunday
night, and on Monday the Presbytery will
meet and grant their request, for neither
congregation nor Presbytery will offer any
objection to the pastor's leaving. The
necessity for his departure is known to
them all.
Ever since the Rev. Mr. Griffith came
here from South Dakota five years ago his
wife has been steadily failing in strength
and health until now she is almost help
less from the effects of chronic bronchitis.
During their residence in Dakota Mrs.
Griffith enjoyed the best of health of her
life. It is probable that if the climate of
the mother country does not benefit her
the Rev. Mr. Griffith will take charge of
two churches near Aberdeen, S. D., as he
received a standing ofTei nearly a month
ago from their congregations immediately
after he tendered his resignation to his
flock here.
The church has had no home of its own,
but has held services in Cambrian Hall,
Mission street. Last, year, however, a lot
waÃ bought on Gridley street and paid for.
It was Mr. Griffith's fond hope to see a
church building erected on the property
before he should co, but he dared not re
main here any longer.
RATES TO CONVENTIONS.
To Be Fixed Bere by the Transconti
nental Association.
The Transcontinental Passenger Asso
ciation will begin its coming, meeting to
morrow at the Palace Hotel. Representa
tives of all the transcontinental lines will
arrive to-day and to-night The meeting
is likely to last for several days.
The association has no big fights or
other matters of sensational interest on
hand. Its business will include several
matters of railroad importance and some
of public importance. One thing that will
be done is to fix rates for the various Na
tional political conventions to be held
within the next few weeks. It is not likely
tnere will be any quarreling about the
matter. The prospects are that the lines
will agree on one fare for the round trip
in the case of each convention. This rate
will be approved by the Southern Pacific.
The Southern Pacific freight department
yesterday announced a special season rate
for horses from common points in North
ern and Central California to Helena,
Butte and Anaconda. The rates will apply
to the close of the Montana racing season.
By passenger train the rate each way be
tween California and Montana will be $440
per car containing twelve horses, the car
rier being released from liability in excess
of $100 per head. The regular rate by pas
senger train is $585. Quite a number of
horses are Jikely to go from this State to
the Montana circuit.
General Freight Aerent C. F. Smurr will
represent the Southern Pacific Company
at the meetine of the Trans-Missouri As
sociation about Utah rates in Denver on
the 21st inst. The Traffic Association will
consider tha Utah situation at its meeting
to-moirow.
CURTAILING EXPENSES.
Election Commissioners Refuse to Have
Precinct Haps Printed â Ten
Clerks Appointed.
The Election Commissioners wrangled
over the question of expenses for an hour
yesterday, Registrar Hinton demanding
many things that he deemed absolutely
necessary for the work of his office, and
Messrs. Broderick and Cresswell urging
that in view of the depleted condition of
the treasury the expenses of the coming
election, if one is held, should be Ifept
down to the lowest limit.
The discussion started over the precinct
maps, the Registrar requesting permission
to have the maps printed at once. Mr.
Cresswell objected, saying tnat until Judge
Seawell decides the tenure of office case
now before him it would be useless to have
the work done.
"If there is to be no municipal election
this year the outlay of $8000 or more will
be lost," he said, "for another year there
may be no use of reprecincting the city."
Mr. Hinton lost this point, but he was
authorized to have 2000 copies of the new
election law printed and to emDloy ten
extra clerics at $125 per month each to
hurry tiie work of preparing for the elec
tion.
The question of beginning precinct reg
istration ninety or 160 days before election
was left to the discretion'of the Registrar.

TO DOWN McNAB
AND SULLIVAN.
Rebellion Has Broken Out
in the Junta Campaign
Committee.
A COMBINATION FORMED
Little Bosses Jealous of McNab,
Who Might Become
a Big One.
HE CAN'T RUN THE COMMITTEE
An Effort to Deliver Goods to Daggett
Will Likely Be Foiled To
morrow Night.
Another battle is on in the Junta. It
rages in the campaign committee, a ma
jority of whic â  has risen up against Gavin
McNab and Chairman Sullivan, and will
smite them at the next meeting to-morrow
night if they don't come to terms.
The trouble amounts to a rebellion
against the bossism of McNab and Sulli
van. McNab wants to name about fifty or
seventy-live of the delegates to the State
Convention. That is one thing. Then he
wants to name them, or at least a lot of
them, for Daggett. That is another
thing. Chairman Sullivan is understood
by everybody to be backing McNab'a pro
gramme.
All this and a lot more has become
known in the campaign committee of
twenty. The members of the committee
who have howled and then formed a com
bination to sit down on McNab and Sul
livan are reliably reported to constitute a
majority.
This centering of all power in a small
campaign committee was mainlj' the bril
liant scheme of McNab and Sullivan. Sul
livan appointed recently the committee of
twenty which has full and absolute con
trol of affairs and he was ye ry careful to
appoint men who were his own friends
ana who could be relied upon to stand out
to the end against Rainey and also against
Daggett as far as local politics are con
cerned.
McNab and Sullivan were snpposed to
have control of the committee along with
Ed Lanigan, who was given three or four
members for coming over and helping
beat Rainev out. Now Lanigan and
others have turned on McNab and Sulli
van and propose to run things themselves.
Different motives have brought about
the rebellious and apparently victorious
combination. Lanigan was not given by
Sullivan as many places on the campaign
committee as he and others thought he
was fairly entitled to in the first place.
Then, when McNab proposed to name
fifty or so delegates and be the high-muck
a-muck generally, Lanigan put on war
paint. He might have agreed to McNab
naming a bunch of delegates if he could
have named as many.
Others flocked to Lanigan on this prope
sition, McNab, the great anti-boss
prophet, was trying to be the boss. Buck
ley could be a boss nnder such circum
stances, but witti McNab it's different.
There are a lot of little bosses, and each
one wants his power, so some were ready
to save Mr. McNab from being a hog.
There was another reason something
like this with some. The plan of McNab
and Sullivan was that the committee as a
whole should name all the district and at
large delegates and the election officers,
they expecting to easily manage a majority
of the executive committee.
The committeemen from some of the
districts realized the power of their posi
tions and thought they ought to be al
lowed to swing it by naming election
officers and district delegates themselves.
A district is worth something to a poli
tician. Why should he supinely let Mc-
Nab grow big and fat on it?
With two or three if not more was
added to this the well-grounded idea that
McNab proposed to do a whole lot for
Daggett. McNab has been running thinjjs
from the start and he has always been the
one that has conducted negotiations with
Daggett.
His position has always been a mystery
to those on the inside of Junta affairs. He
is given credit for being sincerely opposed
to Rainey, while being a close' friend of
Chief Sullivan. He has been close to Dag
gett, received patronage from him, it is
said, and yet has appeared to firmly but
gently oppose Daggett's efforts to control.
"He has tried to play two hands," is the
way many put it. As the real boss in
power he is believed by all the Junta out
tit to have made promises to Daggett
which he wants to fulfill through the
executive committee. He wants to name a
lot of delegates for Daggett for one thing,
Daggett having been shut out of any
chance to name any himself.
"Now why should we get in and carry
out McNab s contract with Daggett?" is
what some of the committee are asking.
The chief issue concerning Daggett is in
the Thirty-ninth District. Dr. J. W.Gavi
gan, friend to Lanigan and to himself, was
appointed to the executive committee by
Sullivan. Daggett made a fierce and per
sistent fight to get his lieutenant, J. A.
Fenton, appointed, but not this or any
other appointment would Sullivan give
Daggett.
Now McNab wants to deliver some
thing to Daggett that Daggett wants ex
ceedingly. He wants Fenlon re-elected to
the State Central Committee from that
district.
To do that a Fenton delegation must be
appointed. McNab wants to give Fenton
a majority of the delegates from that dis
trict and Gavican the minority. That is
enough to make bloody war itself. Gavi
gan probably would be willing that his
delegation should vote for Daggett's ad
ministration interests, but he naturally
wants to deliver the goods himself instead
of letting McNab do it.
Another feature of the McNab pro
gramme concerns those delegates at
large. As has become known, the Mc-
Nab-Sullivan proposition is to appoint
about a third of the 167 delegates at large.
Now, it is said, McNab proposes that
when it comes to the naming of State
central committeemen the delegates at
large shall vote with the district to which
they belong. There may be no delegates
at large from one district and ten from
another, so that these delegates might de
termine several State Central Committee
men. That is another reason why McNab
wan*s to name delegates at large "and an
other reason why there is rebellion.
Some want the members of the commit
tee to be given the naming of delegates
and primary election officers from their
districts.
They will, at least, demand the naming
of election officers, as that would mean the
naming of the delegates if they wanted to
run an opposition ticket. The issue of
how much recognition shall be given to
the Rainey-Daggett minority exists in
other districts than the Thirty-ninth, but
in a less degree.
Daggett is still struggling for power as
fiercely as ever. He is reported to have
just captured two members of the cam
paign committee with places in the Mint.
They are Fitzpatrick and Donovan. He
was not given a single place ou the cam

paign committee, but he was not discour
aged.
He has offered two places in the Mint to
as many members of the campaign com
mittee for their votes, it is reported, and
he will probably get them.
Dagrcett wants members of the State Cen
tral Committee delegates to the State Con
vention, and also Assemblymen and Sena
tors who will vote for him for United Sutes
Senator. How he will come out is a mat
ter for guessing. Sam Rainey is back, but
be is saying little and doing his work
quietly.
Samuel Braunhart is one of the leaders
opposed to the McNab programme. In
fact, he first stirred about forming the
combination to down it.
Twelve votes out of the twenty are said
to be ready to down the ambitious plans
of McNab and Sullivan to-morrow night.
Braunhart wants to control the affairs of
the Twenty-ninth himself, and he is op
posed to any recognition of the Rainey-
Daggett element. He is also a strong sil
ver man and is so opposed to Federal bri
gade domination.
All around the Junta affairs are in an
other pretty mess, which is n.ainly com
posed of quarrels of a lot of jealous and
ambitious little bosses, and it is a tangle
of queer politics.
DR. BROWN A SICK MAN
The Ex-Pastor Suffering Severely
Erom Nervous Prostra
tion.
Permission to Sell the First Church
Property Is Requested by the
Trustees.
The Rev. Dr. Charles O. Brown is a very
sick man. The stormy weeks of the nn
savor'y church trial, the warily qualified
verdict of acquittal on the most serious
charges against him and the subsequent
reversal of that seemingly merciful ver
dict at the Bay Conference meeting by the
very men who had formulated it at the
council â all these events have combined to
unstring the pastor's nervous system in a
manner which is causing his adherents
much alarm.
"Dr. Brown is suffering from an aggra
vated form of nervous prostration," said
one of the officials of the First Congrega
tional Society yesterday, "and I cannot
say when he will be himself again. He
keeps entirely secluded from every one
outside of his family and the small circle
of his most intimate friends. So keenly
does he feel the need of rest that some of
the church officers, myself among the
number, are not sure where he is.
"Under these circumstances it is useless
to talk of an independent church s with
Dr. Brown as its pastor. For the present
he is physically incapable of undertaking
the management of a congregation. If he
were to inaugurate such a movement he
would fling himself into it heart and soul,
and probably work himself to deaih. A
large proportion of his late parishioners
are anxiously waiting for him to found a
church, in order to place themselves once
more under his spiritual direction.
"Perhaps 350 would abnut represent the
number of the church members who side
with him. These comprise the greater
part of the sure, solid resident members.
The so-called opposition was composed in
a great measure of transient and non-sus
taining mem oerp, who had no deep attach
ment for either church or pastor.
"As to the prospective sale of the church
property, I find somÂ« degree of misappre
hension in many quarters.
"In the first place the pulse of the pew
holders was taken, and a large majority
was found to be in favor of selling the
building and lot. Then a business meet
ing of the church officers was called. The
board of deacons and trustees and the
standing committee of the congregation,
after mature deliberation decided to close
the church and put the property on the
market. Thirteen votes were cast, and of
these only one was against the plan.
"For the present, then, we are rwaiting
the outcome of Dr. Brown's illness. If he
regains his L health I regard it very prob
able that his people will gather around
him again. But rÂ«Â» can make no plans
yet. All we can do is to indulge in con
jectures and hope for the best."
In pursuance of the action taken at the
meeting before mentioned a petition was
filed in court asking for permission to sell
the church property.
At the time when the church building
was erected, in 1870, the locality was con
sidered most desirable, being then an aris
tocratic residence section. Latterly, how
ever, business houses have commenced to
spring np about the church, and the char
acter of the vicinity has been considerably
changed. At the same time the value of
the church lot from a business standpoint
has vastly increased.
If it can be sold for anything approach
ing the valuations set upon adjoining
freeholds the proceeds of the sale will be
amply sufficient for the purchase of a
much more eligible site and the erection
of a magnificent church thereon, leaving
a good balance in the enured treasury.
The trustees are quietly looking out for "a
good location, and it is thought some defi
nite steps will soon be taken.
LEAGUE OF HENRY IV.
Hundred-Dollar Membership Prize Won
by U. I). l.;i. ii-A.-t ii .

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Arrival of the New, Stanch
Puget Sound Schooner
Altair.
BUILT FOR SPEED AND WEAR.
Continued Troubles of Count and
Countess Festetics in the
South Seas.
The Puget Sound schooner Altair came
down from Port C( sta Sunday and now
lies at the Green-street wharf. This littte
66-ton vessel is a most remarkable daft,
was built near Port Townsend last
February for a sealer and hunter in north
ern coasts, and was designed to withstand
the hard knocks of tiiose stormy waters.
Human skill could hanlly put together
a wooden hull more Munch and on lines
more graceful than this Hiar-narnetl
schooner. Her ribs are nine by ten inches
square and stand ten inches apart. The
planking of the hull is five inches thick
and the stem and keel are joined together
with a natural crook, just as it grew in
the tree. There are nine feet of dead
wood in the bow. making the little, white,
peaceful craft a warlike ram.
Her length is 66 feet at the keel and SO
feet over all, her beam 21 feet and her
draught when loaded is 9 feet. Her bows
are very sharp for great speed, and her
lines widen out to her greatest beam amid
ships. She is not Tumeresque, with a
broad quarter, but fails in to a smaller
beam at the stern. Her mainsail hoist is
about 54 feet, and she spreads 1000 square
yards of canvas. She i* fitted with mod
ern steering gear, which will pivot her
around on her keel like a top. The Altair
is owned by R. Olsen of this City, by whom
she is valued at $7000.
She left Port Townsend April 26, and off
Cape Flattery she caught a fierce south
easter, which tossed the little while
schooner on the crests of the great billows
like a cork. As the gale was dead ahead
for her course she lay under a reefed lore
sail for nine duys. So weatberly is sue
that her decks were never washed by the
seas and her beam kept her as upright as
achurcti.
On the tenth day the gale veered to the
northwest, and then she gathered up her
yachtlike heels and Hew. Fourteen and
sixteen knots under short Bail was her
speed til) the storm blew itseif away.
Scudding before a living gale is a trial to
tne wheelsman, but the Altair's steering
machine never let the sharp stem vary an
inch from the straight-away course.
She discharged her cargo of lumber at
Port Costa and is now preparing for a
cruise along the Mexican coast.
Australia is indeed a necessity, or at least
she is the mother of invention, for she has
sent the world another useful appliance,
which if not as important as the ballot
system and the horse race starting tape,
merits a trial. It is an automatic machine
for registering the finish of running, swim
ming and bicycle races and is tiie property
of A. L. Baini of Sydney, N. S w., who
arrived on the Monowai last Sunday. The
machine is suspended over the finishing
jHjint of the course and records without
error not only the time but the order of
the finishes and the distances the com
ji-thorn are apart at the ending oi the
race.
Mr. Baird is a member of the council of
the New South Wales Athletic Association
and of several bicycle clubs in Sydney.
His finishing machine is uaed at every
sports meeting of any importance in Aus
tralia.
By the passengers of the Monowai it is
reported that the Count and Countess Fes
tetics, in their yacht Tolna, were still sail
ing in stormy seas. Ever since the luck
less pair in their luckless vessel left Ban
Francisco a couple of years ago they have
been in trouble. Crew aft.r crew have been
shipped only to jump the yacht at the first
port, and much of the time t\e vessel has
been deserted in some island harbor ex
cept by its captainess and her spouse. Ac
cording to the complaints of the men she
carried the keys of the storeroom at her
belt and fed them on haidtack and water.
When the Monowai left Sydney the
Tolna had secured a new crew and was
Eettino; under way for a cruise. The
Countess had promised to let the steward
feed the crew and she would only attend
to the Count's rations.
Yesterday the schooner Moonlight, Cap
tain Spencer, sailed on a trading and
prospecting voyage on the Mexican coast.
Admiral Ang^elo O. Monesterio of the
Mexican warship Zaragoza, accompanied
by the Conaul-General of Mexico, officially
visited the Custom-house yesterday. The
admiral was in full uniform and was re
ceived with ceremony suitable to his rank.
PRESBYTERIAN ORPHANS.
First Annual Meeting of the
Managers of the

The first annual meeting of San Fran

that during the year the organization had
met all its bills, is free from debt and has
a small surplus.
The following board of managers was
then elected: Mrs. P. D. Browne, Mrs.
M. D. Rideout, Mrs. Robert McHugh, Mrs.
I. McLane, Mrs. J. Cumming Smith, Mrs.
T. C. Tisdale, Mrs. John Bidwell, Mrs.
John Hemphill, Mrs. A. E. Kent, Mrs.
E. G. Denniston, Mrs. E. R. Stevens, Mrs.
L. A. Kelly, Mrs. O. F. Jonnson and Mrs.
Fenderson. The officers, who served to
the satisfaction of all during the past year,
were re-elected.
Miss Edington told an interesting story
of life at the orphanage, which now con
tains sixty-five inmates, the girls pre
dominating. The orphanage is in the old
Gilbert House at San Rafael, but it is not
iarge enough to meet the demands made
unon it.
Dr. William F. Jones, who serves the
orphanage without pay, presented his re
port of the work done. Mrs. S. S. Palmer
spoke in strong, patriotic language of "The
Children and our Country," and tbe presi
dent read her report, in which she re
viewed the work of the year. Mrs. Day
told what environment does for children
and the children gave recitations and sang
patriotic son^s.
Several beds were donated to the home
ana a committee was appointed to visit a
farm near San Pedro, eighty acres in
extent and offered for sale, to be used as a
farm for the orphanage.
THE HOUSE OF SILENCE
Fred Bell Was Conscious Only
for a Moment Yester
day.
Captain Lees Disputes the Statement
That the Boy's Father Was Killed
by a Fall.
Fred Bell, the heir to nearly a half mill
ion dollars of the Thomas Bell estate, who
met with an accident as tragic as it is
mysterious about two weeks ago at 1107
Bush street, regained consciousness for a
moment only yesterday morning.
For the first time since his mangled form
was picked up at the bottom of the stair
way from which he had either been tossed
or had fallen he opened bis eyes and spoke.
"Where is Marie?" he asked, inquiring
for his sister, the only member of the im
mediate family with whom he has had
dealings in years.
The young woman was not present,
owing to the strict quarantine placed on
the sick-chamber by Mrs. Thomas Bell,
the mother of the boy, who will permit no
one bnt Dr. P. A. Kearney and the nurse
to see him.
Miss Marie Bell was the first one with
"Mammy" Pleasant, the business mana
ger for Mrp. Bell, to reach the young man
after his mishap, but, five days ago an in
junction was placed acainst her visiting
j her brother any more. When the sick
lad's appeal to see his sister was unre
quited he closed his eyes and relapsed into
unconsciousness so similar to death that
but for the labored breathing one would
believe he had passed away.
Captain Lees, the veteian detective,
makes a peculiar statement regarding the
killing of old Thomas itell, the banker,
who died four years ago under circum
stances similar to those attending his son's
case to-day.
At the time of the first affair it was well
known that whether Thomas Bell was
thrown over the bannisters purposely or
whether he fell accident ly, the fall was the
cause of his death. Even the people in
the "House of Silence" where the affair
occurred acknowledge thi* to this day.
Still Captain ijees yesterday said, in
speaking of the subject, that there never
had been any evidence to that effect and
that de did not believe Thomas Bell ever
did tumble down the spiral stairway to his
death two stories below.
The mystery in the case therefore ap
pears to be growing denser as the conflict
between Captain Lees, who claims to have
investigated the case, and Mrs. Bell,
"Mammy" Pleasant and a number of ser
vants is radical in the extreme.
If Thomas Bell was not pitched head
long to bfs death, or if he did not meet it
through accident, why is it his family give
that version of the affair?
Again, why is it that Captain Leea be
lieves, or says he does, that Thomas Bell
simply dropped dead where he was found
on the cement floor of the basement in the
"House of Silence"?
That mystery has passed nns olved for
years, and the new mystery of Fred Bell's
similar tragic fate appears to be going the
same way.
FOR THE SABBATH DAY.
Annual Convention of the State Sabbath
Association.
The annual convention of the California
Sabbath Association was held during the
day and evening yesterday in the audito
rium of the Y. M. C. A. building, and was
attended by a large throng of those inter
ested in the Christian observance of the
Sabbath day.
In the morning devotional exercises,
committee reports and the appointment
of committees Consumed the time. In the
afternoon the business of the session, in
cluding the election of officers, was fin
ished.

A PETTY ISLAND KING.
Jolid F. More Is So Called
by His Dead Brother's
Heirs.
TRYING HAED TO DEPOSE HIM.
The Joint Heirs Demand an Account
ing for Eighty-Five Thousand
and Odd Dollars.
Sensational happenings are looked for in
the estate of the late Alexander P. More.
Mr. More was a sovereign in his own
right and reigned supreme over the isle
known as Santa Rosa. He had a brother
named John F. More, who enjoyed his
confidence to an almost unlimited degree.
When Alexander wanted to take a trip
of two or three years for hia health John
P. ruled the little principality, and after
Alexander's death John F. continued in
authority by virtue of his appointment as
administrator.
That bis administration of affairs has
not been satisfactory to the other neirs of
the deceased Alexander P. More is at
tested by the repeated efforts made to
secure from him a complete accounting.
But all attempts were apparently un
crowned by success, and tbe heirs finally
determined to bring John up with a rapid
legal turn.
He filed what purported to be an ac
counting, and in Judge Coffey's court yes
terday began the hearing of numerous
exceptions on the part of the several heirs
to the ingenious bookkeeping of the ad
ministrator.
What may follow can only be hinted at,
though it was openly stated by thosp in
terested that unless John F. makes a show
ing for $80,000 or $100,000 which the heirs
tnink ue has bandied to their financial
undoing, the court will be asked to re
move him from his island sovereignty in
stanter.
Attorney Mhoon, representing two of
the heirs, will file exceptions to-day cov
ering the same points brought oat by
Messrs. Gunnison, Booth & Bartnett in
behalf of their clients, also heirs of the de
ceased island king.
The interests of the heirs are identical.
They allege that John F. has rendered a
false accounting and that he has appro
priated $85,000 to his own use. In some of
the papers to be filed this sum will be en
larged by tne addition of moneys paid out
lor personal taxation from the funds of
the estate.
The heirs say l.Â«ore disposed of $30,000
worth of sheep, $1000 in cattle, $28,000 in
products of the little principality, besides
being in collusion with a man named
Watson, to whom he is paying $125 a
month to keep him company on the
island and look wise when they botn come
t<> Sun Francisco to meet the heiro in the
legal arena.
Watson has a suit now pending against
the estate for $30,000 tor services rendered
the deceased Alexander P. More. Among
other modest charges is one of $18,000 for
advice as to the state of the woo! market.
The heirs think postal cards were as
cheap at that time as ever, and they
would willingly have performed the same
service for 2 cents and no commission.
On the resumption of the case to-day
additional exceptions to the strange ac
counting will come up for argument, and
it may be three or four days before the
hearing is brought to a close. After that,
other measures will be adopted to dispose
of and dispossess the island ruler.
TWO INDICTMENTS
Some Sensational Rumors Regarding
Them Authoritatively Dissipated.
The Grand Jury at its session last Satur
day found two indictments for forgery.
The men indicted are well-known crooks,
who are supposed to be in New York.
Bench warrants for the arrest of the
forgers were issued, and the bail of each
fixed at $20,000.
Beyond the facts stated in Thb Call
Saturday morning, nothing of truth has
been published regarding these indict
ments.
The Examiner has republished the Dean
forgery story, with many embellishments,
and supplemented tne narrative with a
chapter on clever croaks. It has named
many of the noted crooks of the century,
but the list published so conspicuously,
does not, unfortunately, contain the name
of either person indicted by the Grand
Jury, and does not give even the aliases of
either.
The only accurate statement in the
Examiner's whole story is borrowed from
a paragraph in Saturday morning's Call,
wherein it is stated that a noted crook was
indictea for forgery.
The statement that Quirk, alias Jones,
alias Quinn. was indicted, is not correct.
The statement that Janies Bernin, alias
Meredith, was indicted, is without founda
tion of truth.

JODST TO GET
HIS ROAD AGAIN.
The San Francisco and San
Mateo Car Line May
Change Hands.
PIPING OUT THE DEBT.
Proposal to Extend the Road
North to Meet the Sutter-
Street Cars.
OUT TO GOLDEN GATE PARK.
Improved Machinery and Modern
Equipments to Bs Pur
chased.
The San Francisco and San Mateo elec
tric car line, which was sold a short time
t-iuce to Buck, Ohlandt and others, will
almost to a certainty revert into the hands
and under the control of its original owner,
Behrend Joost. This much has been
ascertained by one who is in a. position to
know that it is the intention of Mr. Joost
to redeem the road inside of the next
three months.
Tie getting possession of the road with
its franchise and rolling stock is not a
qiesiion of bargain and sale, as might be
supposed; for the present owners are well
satisfied with the DTOpertJ they bought,
and intended to retain possession of it
and spend some thousands of dollars in
putting it in first-class condition. But the
law permits Mr. Joost to redeem the road
at any time within one year by paying the
purchase price and the penalty of 10 per
cent per annum upon the amount of tue
purchase money, which, in this case,
am unts to $30,000 on the $300,000 paid.
This sum, capital and interest, Mr.
Joost is ready and willing to pay to the
receiver, who, under the law, must put
him In peaceable possession of the roaa at
any time the money is offered to| him
within twelve months from the date of the
. sale by its former owner.
The law makes a difference between the
redemption of real estate sold to satisfy a
foreclosure of a mortgage upon a judgment
and a sale of a franchise by order of a
court.
In the case of a franchise- the time for
redemption is fixed at one year with the
penalty of 10 per cent per annum ; where
as in a sale of real estate under similar
conditions six months is the limit of re
demption, with a penalty of 1 per cent per
month.
Thus it will be seen that no matter how
anxious the present owners may be to re
tain possession of the property they must
deliver it up to Joost by his complying
with the law.
Section 392 of the Civil Code of this State
reads:
The corporation may at any time within one
year after such sale redeem the franchise by
paying or tendering to the purchaser the sum
t paid therefore, with 10 per cent interest there-
OSjb<lt " :thr.;i,t uny allowaai-e for the toll
which he may in the meantime have re
ceived; and upon such payment or lender the
franchise and all the rights and privileges
thereof revert and belong to the corporation
as if no such sale had Deen made.
The power of redemption given to Joost
as the corporate body holding the fran
chise is unquestionable, and as such he in
tends to make use of it by tendering the
money to Buck and Ohlandt within a few
montus. The road without its franchise
would be of very little value to any per
son as a railroad speculation.
This law and its conditions were thor
oughly understood by the parties who
bought the road at the receiver's sale, but
they had no idea that it would be re
deemed, and it was their intention to so
improve it as to make it a first-class line
by reconstructing it and placing new cars
and other modern improvements in all of
its respective parts. But under the law
quoted they were constrained for prudence
and economy's sake to withhold the ex
penditure of any money until the expira
aon of the twelve months, when the road
with its franchise would become their ab
solute property.
By the sale of the road the original in
debtedness of $1,100,000 on the bonds for
material and labor, the two latter being
preferred claims, and all pending suits for
damages or for other cause, have all been
wiped completely out of existence.
The interest "on the original bonds
amounted tT? about $175,000. for material
and labor. This would make the original
indebtedness of the road quite an amount
in excess of thai for which Mr. Joost can
now get his road back.
There is a big difference between $3,300 -
00C and $330,000; so by the sale and re
demption quite a margin h left, which it
is the intention of its original builder to
apply for placing the road and rolling
stock in first-ciass condition.
New trucks will be purchased for the
cars and heavier rails put down, with a
substantial ballast for the roadbed, which
it is thought, will have the effect of stop^
ping the unpleasant jumping motion so
noticeable on this line.
a In addition to this it ia intended to ex
-1 tend the Guerrero line from Fourteen th
streeet north to Market, crossing that
street and continuing north on Laguna to
Sutter, whence it is proposed to connect
by transfer system with all branches of
the latter. Thus the Butter-street line
will be made a center line from the Mis
sion district direct to the Park and Clifl
House, as also to the county line.
Another branch will run down Fulton
street to the City Hall, and may be ex
tended out west to Lyon street, taking a
turn into Grove ami ending at Stanyan
etreet at the Golden Gate Park.
Other connections and extensions are
thought of about the eastern end, but
none of those have assumed such shape
as would justify the proposed route being
described at present.
SUFFRAGISTS STILL BUSY
Three Organizations Held En
thusiastic Meetings Yes
terday.
Resolutions of Thanks to All Who
Took Part in the Late Woman's
Congress.
Enthusiasm in the cause of woman suf
frage seems to be on tlie increase among
its advocates. Yesterday afternoon about
300 of the ladies *vho have taken most in
teresr in the Woman's Congress just con
cluded met in Shasta Hall, Native Sons'
I building, to discuss the results of the con
gress.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who presided,
gaye a brief resume of the ground covered
by the congress, and expressed the highest
gratification at its unqualified success.
Thi9 success, she said, was duo in a great
measure to the union of purpose arid har
mony of action which prevailed among all
the participants in the creat csnvention
Sue thanked all who had aided her in her
efforts to make the congress interesting
and profitable to those who attended its
meetines.
It iiad been intended to elect oflicers
and a new executive board for the ensuing
year, but on referring to the constitution
it was found that the election would have
to be postponed until next Monday. At
the meeting on that day certain amend
ments to the constitution are to be pre
sented for adoption,
Mrs. Cooper made a few remarks on the
value of the ballot in connection with kin
dercarten work.
Miss Agnes If. Manning, chairman of
the committee appointed for the purpose,
presented a set of resolutions thanking
the local press, the speakers at the con
gress and other persons for favors received.
In the morning a joint meet ng of the
Amendment Campaign Association and
the Woman Suffrage Association was held
at the residence of Mrs. A. A. Sargent,
president of the latter named organization,
1630 Folsoiu street, Mrs. Sargent and Mrs.
Cooper, president of the Campaign Asso
ciation, jointly presiding. The meeting
was private, but at the afternoon session
of the Congress Association it was re
ported that the attendance had been large
and enthusiastic. Plans were formulated
for the extension of the work for woman
suffrage by means of lectures, conventions
and mass-meetings in all portions of the
State. It was also decided to invite Mrs.
Chapman-Catt, a noted woman suffrage
orator in New York, to come to this coast
as soon as possible to aid in the work.
THAT NEW THEATER.
Banker Enos ami Manager Heilig Here
to Arrango Finally for Their
Entertainments.
C. L. Heilig of Tacoma, manager of the
northwestern circuit of theaters, and T. M.
Enos, the bank president of Tacoma, who
with their friends own the Tacoma and
Seattle theaters, and control others at
Portland, Spokane and elsewhere, are at
the Palace.
They were here, as will be remembered,
a few months ago, to make arrangements
for renting or building a theater. They
went away after several propositions had
been made to them. These propositions
were in writing, and Mr. Enos, who is the
capitalist of the enterprise, baa submitted
them since to his moneyed associates.
â¢'We have got the money, and we ore
here now to makefinal arrangements," he
said last night. ''It means that if we can't
lease such a theater as we want we will go
to work and build a finer theater than
there is here.f
"We have got to have theatrical connec
tions here, because it is necessary in order
to make our business what it should be.
We have got money in, and we will put in
more to get the full profits that an addi
tional investment in a new theater here
would give us.
"It is either this or a lease. We will be
here about a week, and will settle it defi
nitely while here."
ALMSHOUSES AND ASYLUMS.
The Civic Federation Favors Civil Ser
vice Rule* for Their Management.
The removal of the Superintendent of
the Almshouse has awakened the mem
bers of the Civic Federation to action.
"A number of the members of the fed
eration," said George T. Gaden yesterday,
"have had an informal talk on this sub
ject, and it has been decided to hold a
meeting at an early day to see if anything
can be done in the matter. We are of the
opinion that sue!) institutions as the Alms
house and the asylums for the insane
should not be mixed up in politics, and
that the civil service rules should apply to
such institutions. Weaieof the opinion
that the law that prevents the removal of
schoolteachers except for cause will apply
to the Almshouse Superintendent, and we
propose to test that law and see what vir
tue there is in it. We do not intend to
make a fight specially for Mr. Weaver, but
we want to ascertain if the principle that
a Eood and efficient officer should not be
removed except for cause will not apply to
the Alrashouse."
C. Wesley Reed, another member of the
federation," staled that one thing that the
federation is doing is working for the
adoption of the new charter. If that is
adopted it will bring all our public insti
tutions under the civil service rules and
take them out of politics.
HOBART LOS T A HUNDRED
Bet His Prize Polo Pony Was
Fleeter Than One From
Riverside.
Rivalry in the Recent Matches De
cided in a Sunday Race Before
A 1 "B ingum."
"Blingum's" fleetest tjolo pony has been
beaten and Walter Hobart is $100 poorer
than he was Sunday noon; but the loss of
the money is a minor consideration to the
young millionaire, who has lÂ»een accus
tomed to capturing all the best prizes at
the horse shows with his string of thor
oughbreds.
During the recent polo matches at San
Jose and at Burlingame for the coast
championship a good deal of rivalry arose
as to the merits of individual ponies.
Waring, one of the most reckless riders of
the defeated Riverside team, asserted that
his thoroughbred mount. Santa Clara, had
shown herself to be the fastest pony in
the field. But young Hobart, fired by vic
tory and a dominant pride in whatever is
from "Blinvtum," would not concede that
his Laddie was second to anything on the
coast with cropped mane anil docked tail.
So a match race for $100 a side was ar
ranged to be run Sunday afternoon on
Hobarfs private track at his place a little
to the south of San Mateo
All "Blingum" eatbered to honor the
occasion. A small Spanish boy whom the
Riversides had brought up from Southern
California In preparation for just such an
event was mounted on Santa Clara, and
Hunn, Hobart's trainer, was selected to
pilot Laddie over the half-mile course.
The ponies got off well together and
came tearing down the stretch almost neck
and neck, with Laddie slightly in the lead
until nearly to the wire, when Santa Clara
burst ahead and won by a nose.
"Blingum" is chagrined but not dis
heartened by the defeat. An soon as the
players shall have recovered from the
fatigue caused by the two hard contests of
last week the regular Wednesday and
Saturday polo games on the club's grounds
will be resumeo ana continued throughout
the summer season.
In the fall the Burlingame Polo Club
may go down to Riverside to play a match
with their old rivals, but the trip depends
a good deal on financial considerations
The expenses of the visiting Riverside
team were largely defrayed by the Santa
Clara Rose Carnival, though members of
Me Burlingame set contributed $1000 in
private subscription.
During the last week in August the
usual racemeet and society event par
ticipated in by Burlinghame will be held
at Del Monte.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1896.
A DAY FOR OUTSIDERS
One Lonely Favorite Reached
the Wire First at Ingle
side.
WALTER J LEFT AT THE POST.
Instigator Downed Scimitar Handily.
Toano Nosed Out the Favorite,
Mobalasca.
The rainfall of the night previous left
the track in a heavy condition, and race
goers at Ingleside yesterday met with ill
success in pickine the winners.
Fleur de Lis, the fast daughter of Max
im, took the opening scramble for two
year-olds, but in the five races following
the first choices were all downed.
The attendance was good, and as the
betting was extremely lively the layers of
odds undoubtedly recouped some of their
losses sustained on Saturday, which was a
hard day for the ring.
Racing has furnished chapters of hard
luck stories, and the fourth race of the
day. a seven-furlong run with a held of
eight going to the post, added one more
to the long list. Walter J, backed from 7 j
to 5 down to evens, wheeled when the bar
rier was raised and was left at the post.
Whether he would have gained the de
cision or not is problematical, for the sec
ond choice. Red Glenn, won with such
ease that the three-year-old would have
had to be in very, very line fettle to have
beaten him. Senator Bland, a 12 to 1
chance, ran into the place, with Strath
flower a fair third.

The bald-faced Thornhill added to the
discomfort of the talent by starting; a warm
favorite for the mile and . a half selling
event and finishing behind the 10 to 1 out
sider, Wawona, ridden by Si McClain.
Opening at evens the odils against the
Lone stable entry went to 7 to 5, when
they were forced down to 6 to 5 and evens
again. The pace cut out was a slow one,
and Wawona, who made the running, was
so afflicted with speed that when Coadv, on
the favorite, made his move he found him
self unable to mow down the leader's ad
vantage gained at the start and was beaten
out very handily at the wire by a length
and a half in 2:45^. Little Cripple came
strong at the end, finishing lapped on the
place horse.
Six two-year-olds started in the opening
four-furlong dash, with Fleur de Lis held
at 2 to 5. She led all the way, winning
easily from the second choice, Dunboy,
in :50>Â£. ... .
The Elrawood stock farm's horses ap
pear to have regained their old winning
streak, as has been testified to on several
occasions of latÂ«. Its representative, In
stigator, in the mile and a furlong run, de
cided under selling conditions, knocked
down a very heavily supported choice in
Scimitar, who was played down from 2 to
ItoÃto 5, with big bundles of coin. The
overlooked one jumped out in front at the
start and won all the way, passing the
stand nearly three lengths before the fa
vorite. Paros, the second choice, injudi
ciously ridden by H. Martin, was third.
- The race tnat followed over six furlongs
furnished a nose finish between the 7 to 5
favorite. Tiberius, and the 6 to 1 outsider,
Daylight. In a drive the last lurlong Pig
gott had slightly the better of the argu
ment with Fanny Butler and gained the
decision for the almost neglected one in
the betting by a very narrow margin.
About the closest thing of the entire
afternoon's sport was the finish between
Toano and Mobalasca in the last race of
the day, a six-furlong sprint. Mr. Corri
. an's Indian-named filly had first call in
the betting at 8 to 5, while 6 to 1 was laid
against the old campaigner. Toano was
fortunate in outbreaking his field, getting
away in the lead, while the first choice
was away last. | Toano led into the stretch
with a lead of two lengths, the first choice,
fourth, making rapid strides to the front.
Opposite the paddock . Mobalasca" looked
to have the old horse beaten, but under
Macklin's hard riding he made a great
spurt the last thirty yards and got the
verdict by a nose. Bueno, the second
choice, was third.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
To-morrow, the closing day of the two
weeks' meeting, will be "ladies' day" at
lncleside.
The three-cornered match race between
Orestes, George Palmer and Fleur de Lis,
which was to have been the special feature
of the closing day, has been declared off.
Tnis action was necessitated from the fact
that Orestes is to be shipped East shortly
along with the horses of Orrin Hickok and
has been piven a -'let-up" in his work.
One of the eyes of the race mare Majorie,
whose nostrils were plugged with sponges
some weeks aeo at the pay District track,
has troubled her ever since that occurred,
and yesterday in making an examination
of the mare's head her trainer discovered
a second sponge in one of the mare's nos
trils that had undoubtedly been the cause
iof her discomfort. The miscreants who
I committed the act evidently intended to
! take no chances on having the racer give
them the double-cross.
Walter J appears to be sour and a cessa
tion from track work might work a change
for the better in his behaviour.
MEN WHO WILL FIGHT.
Sharkey and Williams and Hawkim and
Ziegler Have Been Matched.
The National Athletic Club is already
arranging for its next fistic entertainment.
The managers say that they will have no
difficulty in securing first-class fistic talent,
but it is the leasing of a proper hall for
the purpose where the shoe pinches most.
The pavilion would be a first-class place,
no doubt, but the expense attached to the
holding of a series of boxing contests
witliin that big structure is considerable.
The Olympic Club had to pay something
like $100â an expense Recount for the
breakage of "furniture"â for its one even
ing's entertainment. There are other in
cidentals connected with the lease of this
place which very materially lessen the
weight of the profits realized from a box
ing entertainment.
The National Club has completed ar
rangements for a ten-round bout some
evening in the early part of June between
Tom Sharkey, "the natator," and big Wil
liams, the colored pugilist who fought Ed
Smith of Denver. It is said that Williams
relies entirely on his strength and ability
to inflict punishment by heavy hitting to
win a victory. He shows no judgment,
but goes rieht in at his man hammer and
tongs and slashes away regardless of where
his blows land. Everybody is aware of
Sharkey's style of righting, consequently
all I hat need be said of a match between
those fellows is that the pace will be hot
until one of the "hurricaners" will come
to grief and the end may come as an early
surprise to fighters and's ectators.
The fake fighters, or those of them who
propose in case of dire distress to resort to
a subterfuge will have to quit thinking
and speculating on what is now commoniy
known as the "groin" punch. Referee Al
King says that the next fighter who will
"play for wind" by giving to him and the
spectators the impression that he was hit
"Delow the belt" will receive a sentence
which he (King) guarantees to be a safe
cure for groin complaint.
The manager of the People's Theater
has, it is said, consummated a match be
tween Dal Hawkins and Ziegler. The lat
ter is in very straitened circumstances and
â will agree to almost any proposition that
will result in money-making.
The sports of Bakersfield have organ
ized an athletic club which will be known
as the Kern County Athletic Club. The
officers are: President, G. C. Rowell; sec
retary and business manager, Walter E.
Gould; treasurer, W. W. Hoocroft; pro
fessor of boxing, Thomas Barry of San
Francisco. The directors are now on the
hunt for good boxers, and when they will
find suitable talent a grand evening's en
tertainment will be given which will con
sist of all kinds of indoor athletic sport.
Barry is a good instructor of physical cul
ture.
About eight months ago the Olympic
Club offered a life membership to any
member who, during the year, would bring
into the club the greater number of mem
bers. The race for the title was very in
teresting for a few months, but when the
friends of Dr. E. N. Short, the leader at
the ciub, heard that he (Short) was in the
race they flocked to his assistance, and as a
result the popular athlete is now far ahead
of his competitors, and running to the
homestretch under an easy pull.
The Olympic Club do not intend to give
a second boxing tournament this year.
WILL ASK MORE MONEY
The Health Department Wants
an Increased Appro
priation.
Public Organizations Asked to Discuss
the Matterâ Splenetic Fever
Raging.
The Board of Health held a special ses
sion yesterday morning to attend to a
number of important matters that were
deemed urgent enough to warrant imme
diate action. The principal matter con
sidered was a communication from
Auditor Broderick in relation to the ap
propriation for the coming fiscal year.
The Auditor desired Dr. Lovelace, to
whom the letter was addressed, to make
an estimate of the funds that would be
needed br the department and file the
same in his office. The Health Depart
ment has long intended to make a strong
plea to the Board of Supervisors for a
much larger sum than has been appro
priated in the past, believing that the
health of the City is paramount to every
other consideration and that the depart
ment should not be hampered by lack of
funds in carrying out the necessary work.
Dr. Morse was ready with a resolution
bearing on the subject, which read as fol
lows:
Whbrear, The health of the entire population
of a great city is of paramount importance
and entitled to greater and fuller consideration
than any other subject; and whereas, there
are many association* and bodies now n this
City organized witb the view of promotiu? the
general welfare of this City, now it is unani
mously
Jietnlved, That this board invite the proper
representatives of all associations organized
to further the welfare of this city, to a general
meeting to take place at lime and olace to be
fixed in the near future, to discuss with such
associations the best methods of increasing
the public health ot this City and County.
A vote of thanks to Judge Hebbard for |
his successful efforts in securing an ap- |
propriation from the Supervisors for the
care of the insane in the Receiving Hospi
tal was passed unanimously.
A communication from E. D. McCabe.
private secretary to Governor Budd, stat
ing that information had been received
that splenetic fever was raging among the
cattle in various parts of the State, was
read, and the board instructed the market
inspector and veterinary surgeon to watch i
for meat infected with the disease and con- !
deran it.
It was decided that, in view of the re- i
ports against the sanitary condition of the
City Prison that had been made by the in
spectors, an investigation by the full board
should be made at an early date.
Dr. M. J. Rosenau, the Marine Hospital
service surgeon stationed at Angel Island,
notified the board that he had received in
structions from Washington to disinfect
the baggage of all Chinese arriving from
the Orient and asked its co-operation. The
secretary was instructed to reply that the
board would do everything in its power to
aid Dr. Rosenau.
FOR A LOCAL CARNIVAL.
An Annual Fete Not So Much
a Question as Its Date
and Name.
ENTHUSIASTICALLY DISCUSSED.
Committee of Seventeen lo Collect
Data and Report at a Larger
Meeting Next Monday.
San Francisco took the first step last
night toward the inauguration of some
sort of an annual fete, be it called La
Fiesta, like that of Los Angeles; Mardi
Gras. like that of New Orleans; Veiled
Prophet, like that of St. Louis, carnival,
or some entirely new name.
Fifty citizens, representing many of the
most public-spirited organizations, met in
the Baldwin Hotel and, after a discussion
very favorable to the project, appointed a
temporary committe of seventeen to col
lect a crowd and much valuable informa
tion for another meeting, to be held at the
same place next Monday evening.
This is the committee that purposes to
arouse interest in the enterprise and find
out all about the plans adopted in the
cities where great fetes have been most
successful :
John A. Steinbach of the Native Sons of
the Golden West; S. H. Tracy of the Pro
ducers' and Manufacturers' Association of
California; Dr. J. W. D. Evelyn, president
of the Geographical Society of California;
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chauts'jJAssociation; Oscar Boldermann,
secretary of the Travelers' Protective Asso
ciation ; "W. H. Mills of the State Board of
Trade; David Rich of the State Develop
ment Committee; E. J. Baldwin, the hotel
and racehorse owner; A. Bouvier of the
Half-million Club and of the theaters; H.
I). Soule of the Hotel Men's Association;
S. L. Rosenthal, the shoe-dealer; Hugh
Craic of the Chamber of Commerce; J. P.
Edoff, president of the Liquor-dealers'
Association, and R. H. Warheld, tempo
rary chairman of the meeting, and Henry
J. Fisher, temporary secretary.
The meeting was called to order by E. J.
Baldwin.
David J. Rich, representing the State
DeveloDinent Committee, suggested a
week's revelry in September, that being a
month of good weather iml one that would
not conflict with the numerous flower car
nivals elsewhere in the State. He thought
there could be as features of the event a
day on the bay, a Government military
review participated in by all the neighbor
ing barracks, a Native Sons of the Golden
West celebration, and a congregation of
country editors and preachers from all
over the State.
J. A. Filcher of the State Board of Trade
said that any such public spirited project
would meet with the hearty co-operation
of his organization, as it was rignt in its
line.
A. C. Boldermann, secretary of the Com
mercial Traveler's Association, knew that
his association would take an active inter
est in the scheme, as it had in La Fiesta at
Los Angeles.
Henry Lunstedt, grand secretary of the
Native Sons of the Golden West, thought
that the Native Sons would be rignt in
with tne idea, provided only that the date
of the fete will not conflict with their an
nual celebration on the 9th of September.
S. H. Taoy, manager of the Manufactur
ers' and Producers^ Association, said he
favored September, as the association pur
poses to give a great exposition of home
products in November in conjunction with
the Mechanics' Institute. He knew that
the association which he reppresented
would co-operate heartily in giving finan
cial support to the proposed enterprise.
R. H. Warfield, proprietor of the Cali
fornia Hotel, and a member of the Hotel
men's Association, declared that all the
hotelmen are favorable to the establish
ment of an annual carnival season. "'And,"
he added. "I know all those 400 odd East
ern hotelmen that were so royally en
tertained here can be counted upon to
help us in many ways. If the carnival
were held a little later than the 9th of
September perhaps the Native Sons of the
Golden West could return from their cele
bration at StocKton and be with us."
S. H. Rosenthal: "I will do and pay my
share toward making tne thing a success.'
Upon motion by David Rich, seconded
by Dr. F. W. d'Evelyn, a temporary or
ganization was effected and temporary
oflicers elected to take charge of the meet
ings preliminary to the formation of the
permanent organization that it is thought
will result from the larger meeting to be
held next Monday night.
A bill has been introduced in the New

SIEBE'S SCALP
Proceedings for Removal
Brought Before Judge
Wallace. *
THE RAILROAD TAXES.
An Action Similar in Effect to
the One in the Supreme
Court.
SUING FOR FORTY THOUSAND.
Judge Troutt Eas Declared One of
the Tax Laws Unconsti
tutional.
Assessor Seibe's name was before the
courts twice yesterdayâ once before Judge
Wallace as the object of an accusation by
A. J. Clunie and again in Judge Troutt's
court as defendant in a suit on uncollected
taxes.
Clunie's accusation was made in per
suance of the inference he drew from the
remarks of the Supreme Court when his
petition for a writ of mandate compelling
the Assessor to reassess the Market-street
Railway Company's property came before
that body. It was intimated then that
the court considered the Assessor and the
Board of Equalization the supreme au
thority in that matter, and so without
waiting for a decision Clunie has filed his
accusation against Siebe.
The accusation was first made to Judge
Slack, who assigned the case to Judge
Wallace. Upon a hearing he set the mat
ter for May 20.
The accusation is as follows:
Now comes Andrew J. Clunie and files the
following accusation in writing against John
I>. jiebe, Assessor of the City and County of
San Francisco, State of California, and in that
behalf alleges:
That at all times herein mentioned the City
and County of San Francisco has been and now
is, h municipal corporation, organized and ex
isting under and by virtue of the laws of the
State of California.
That at all the times herein mentioned said
Andrew J. Clunie has been and now is a citl
xen and elector of the State of California and
of the City and County of San Francisco.
That at an election regularly culled and held
in the City and County of San Francisco on
the 6th day of November. A. D. 1894, for the
election of officers of said City and County of
San Francisco, State of California, John D
Siebe was elected Assessor of the City anil
County or San Francisco for the term of four
years from and after the first Monday after the
first day of January, 1895, and that "thereafter
the said John D. Siebe was duly qualified as
euch Assessor, and ever since the first Monday
after the Ist of January, A. D. 1895, has been,
and now is. the July "elected, qualified and
acting Assessor of the City and County of San
Francisco, State of California.
That at all times herein mentioned, the
Market-street Railway Company has been, and
now is, a corporation orKanized and existing
under and by virtue of the laws of the State of
California, ar.d having its principal place of
business at the City and County of San Fran
.ciwo, State of California.
That on, at and prior to 12 o'clock meridian
of the first Monday in March, 1895, said Mar
ket-street Railway Company was and ever
since has been and now is the owner of real
and personal property subject to taxation
under the laws of the State of California, and
situated within vhe City and County of San
Francisco, State of California, and subject to !
assessment and taxation within the said City
and County of San Francisco, and that at all
of said times the full cash value of said prop
erty has been and now is not less than $17 -
500,000, and that at all said times said prop
erty would have been taken in payment of a
j u.->t debt from said Market-street Railway Com
pany for said amount.
That for the purpose and with the design of
enabling said Market-street Railway Company
to evade taxation for the fiscal year commenc
ing July 1, 1895, upon the full cash value of
said property, said John I). Siebe, as such As
sessor of the City and County of San Francisco,
wilfully and knowingly failed and neglected
to, and did not assess the eaid property of said
Market-street Railway Company lor the pur
pose of taxation for said fiscal year, at its full
cash value, but with the said object and pur
pose then and there assessed the same at the
value of but #3.883,866, and that no other
further or additional assessment of said prop
eriv for said fiscal year was made.
That the rate of taxation for State and City
and County purposes for said fiscal year was
92 25 upon each $100 of the assessed valu
ation of the property of said City and County
ai San Francisco.
Wherefore it is prayed that caid John I>.
Siebe, as such Assessor of the City and County
of San Francisco, be cited by this court to ap
pear before it at a time and place to be fixed
by it, and that thereupon such proceedings oe
had and taken as required by section 77'J
Penal Code of the State of California.
Andrew J. Clime, Accuser.
The section of the Penal Code referred
to is :
When an accusation !n writing, verified by
the oath of any person, is presented to the
Superior Court, alleging that any officer within
the jurisdiction of the court has been guilty of
charging or collecting illegal fees for services
rendered or to bo rendered in his office, or has
refused or neglected to perform the official
duties pertaining to hi* office, the court must
cite the party charged to appear before the
court at a time not more than ten nor less than
five days from the time the accusation was
presented, and on that day, or some other sub
sequent day, not more than twenty days from
that on which the accusation was presented,
mut-t proceed to hear in a eummary manner
the accusation and evidence in support of the
same and the answer and evidence offered by
the party accused, and if. on snch hearlng.it
appears that the charge is sustained the court
must enter a decree that the party accused be
deprived of his office and must enter a judg
ment of $000 in favor of the informer and
such costs as are allowed in civil cases.
The case in Judge Troutt's court is all
in Siebe's favor. By one of the amend
ments of 1895 it become? necessary for the
District Attorney to sue the Assessor and
his bondsmen for any neglect to collect
due and collectable personal property
taxes unsecured by real estate. The Aud
itor must go over the Assessor's books
after August 15 of each year, and if he
finds a shortage ho must demand the
amount from the Assessor. Should this
not be paid in fifteen days the Auditor
must notify the District Attorney, who
must bring suit against the Assessor and
his bondsmen for the amount of tbe
shortage.
It is further provided that in this suit
no defense but that the tax is illegal, void
or invalid shall be admitted.
All this had been gone through with.
The Auditor found ?40,830 13 in taxes un
collected and this was demanded from the
Assessor, it was not paid and a suit was
brought. The trial came up yesterday
and lasted about two hours. The decision
was given for Siebe and Judge Troutt, in
deciding, said he believed the law uncon
stitutional.
Mr. Barnes proved the |40,830 taxes due
and ifncollected. Then Mr. Herzcr, Mr.
Siebe's chief deputy, was called to the
ttand In defense. He testified to the difli
culties of collecting the taxes Included,
showed that none of it was due on the ves
sels which bad sailed when the tax hud
become due; some was on household prop
erty which had been moved to parts un
known and there were many other reasons
equally as good tor tbe deficit.
Mr. "Barnes demurred to the defense as
one not contemplated by the statute, but
Judge Troutt ruled that the law was un
constitutional, as it sought to deprive a
man of his right to any defense he pleased
â a right given to him by the constitution.
He overruled the demurrer allowed the
defense and gave judgment for the de
fendant.
A BREAK FOR LIBERTY.
Two Girls Escape From the Training
Home on Bill Street.
Detectives and officers of the Society for
the Suppression of Vice are searching high
and low for two young girls who made
their escape on Saturday night from the
Girls' Training Home, at 26 Hill street.
The cirls are Lucy Innian, 18 years of
age, and Maggie Smith, 15 years of age.
Both are natives of Woodland, whore their
parents, who are well-to-do people, reside.
They left their homes last winter and
came to this City. Officers came in search
of them, but had to return without find
ing them.
The Inman girl was found at 309 Grant
avenue and was threatened with arrest
unless she returned home. She consented
and took the train to Woodland, but left it
at the Sixteenth-street station. Oakland,
and returned to the City.
Both girls were arrested last week and
sent to the Girls' Training Home. They
did not take kindly to the rigorous rules
ol the institution" and Saturday night
about 8 o'clock they succeeded in eluding
the vigilance of the matron and escaped
into the rear yard, without their hats or
shoes. They had to climb a board fence
eight feet high, and how they managed to
do so is a wonder.
As soon as their flight was discovered, a
few minutes later, the police in the vicin
ity were furnished with a description of
them, and every effort has been made
since then to recapture them, without suc
cess. They have succeeded in completely
covering their tracks.
It was reported at police headquarters
yesterday morning that the Inman girl
haÂ«l been at 309 Grant avenue Sunday
night, out when Detective Anthony went
there she had fled. Her father has been
telegraphed to for instructions, and if he
consents to a charge of vagrancy being
made against her when arrested she will
be sent up for six months.
The Smith girl has addressed a note to
the Society for the Suppression of Vice,
in which the says: "Can't you leave a
girl who is hurting nobody but herself
alone? I don't want to go home, and if
I'm arrested a thousand times I won't
change my conduct."
WHAT HOWISON TEACHES
The Berkeley Professor Tells
Presbyterians He Is
Orthodox.
Professor John Watson and Faith.
Congregational Club Elects
Officers.
There was a large audience at the Pres
byterian Ministerial Union yesterday
morning to hear Professor John Watson s
lecture. Although the professor of moral
philosophy from Queen's College, Kings
ton, Ont., has been addressing the stu
dents of Berkeley for some time, yester
day's was his first lecture given before a
ministerial association of this City.
Professor Watson discussed the theories
of Kant and his English critics, touching
also on the views held by Comte, Mill and
Spencer. Faith and reason were the
themes upon which he dwelt at length,
contrasting St. Anselcuo's motto: "I be
lieve in order to understand," with
Abelard's teaching, "You must under
stand in order to believe." The speaker
gave as his opinion that the modern idea
of faith is a distortion of the original idea
of it held by early Christians. "It was
originally light and intellectual love, but
it has come to be an acceptation of doz
mas. from which the life has gone out,"
the deductions arrived at in the profes
sor's address being that faith is the highest
form of reason, an i that idealistic philoso
phy should be taught by the churches.
Professor Howison of the University of
California was invited to address the
meeting and responded that he was clad
to have an opportunity of speaking before
representative Presbyterians. "Your
paper, the Occident." "he said, "devoted
two pages of offensive and sensational mat
ter to asKing and awswering the question:
Ie Berkeley orthodox? I have never an
swered that article, but I reply now that
as far as intellectual beliefs go 1 am pro
foundly devoted to Christianity.
"It is said In tne Scriptures *no man
has seen God at any time,' and it ought to
be added, 'he never will.' for he who is not
prepared to take his religious life on lines
which the senses cannot reach, is not truly
religious. This is the sort of talk that tue
young men of Berkeley hear from me. I
1 aye been seeking an opportunity to say
it to you."
Professor Howison concluded his re
marks by giving various definitions of
f ai tli, which in the main agreed with those
already laid down by Professor Watson,
and by sayine that be looked to see many
doctrines which have been accepted by
Christian?, but which are not Christian,
dropped by the churches before iong.
Key. Dr. Mackenzie said at the conclusion
of the address that he should like to hear
further from the Berkeley professor and
know whether he believed sin to be a fac
tor in human personality and forgiveness
a factor in divine personality. Professor
Howison replied immediately in the
affirmative to both questions.
Congregational Club.
The Congregational Monday Club occu
pied its time yesterday in considering va
rious changes in its way of conducting the
meetings, with a view to arousing more
interest among the members in the meet
ings. It was resolved that henceforth the
body should meet in the morning, for the
convenience of its Berkeley members.
The following officers were elected for
the ensuing six months: Chairman, Rev.
George Hatch; secretary, Rev. li. Orr; ex
ecutive committeeâ Rev. E. Lyman Hooil
Rev. M. Willett, Professor C. 8. Nash;
nominatitig.committeeâ Rev. W. C. Pond,
Rev. T. Cruzan, Rev. E. R. Galloway.
WANTS AN INSPECTOR.
The Woman's Federation Says Truant
Children Should Be Looked
After.
The members of the Federation o*
Women became quite enthusiastic at the
regular monthly meeting yesterday after
noon over the need for a truant inspector
to compel children to attend the public
schools in this City.
Mrs. North stated that a large number
of the children in this City do not attend
school. "Why is not the compulsory edu
cation that we are supposed to have ear
ned oat?" naked this lady. "I suggest
that we wait on Superintendent Babcock
and present to him the fact that numbers
of children are wandering the streets and
getting into mischief, instead of attending
school. The following committee wae
appointed to urge the appointment of a
truant inspector: Mrs. Dr. Jones. Mrs.
Bates, Misb Emery, Mrs. llichards and
Mrs. Mckevitt.
Other Bubiects discussed yesterday were
the non-enforcement of the ordinance
which enacts that ash-wagons shall be
covered, and the dumping of women into
the patrol wagon along with drunken men
and Chinamen.
Arbor day has been celebrated in Ne
braska by the planting of over 1,000.000
trees between sunrise and sunset. Pre
miums for the largest plantings were
offered by societies and individuals, and
the result will be a memorable event in
tbe history of the State.

A CHINESE FOOTPAD.
Ah Doo Arrested for Holding Up Dan-
iel Freeman, a Colored
Han.
A Chinese footpad was arrested early
yesterday morning by Policeman McGee
and booked at the City Prison on the
charge of robbery.
About 4 o'clock Daniel Freeman, a col
ored man, was walking along Pacific street
when he was accosted by a Chinese. Free
man is not conversant with the Chinese
language and did not comprehend what
was said to him. He recommenced his
walk when he was brought to an abrupt
halt by the muzzle of a revolver in close
proximity to his heart. Then, in broken
English, the Chinese told him to hold up
his hands. Freeman promptly obeyed and
the Chinese deftly went through his poc
kets, securing f3.
As soon as the robber loft him Freeman
went in search of a policeman and met
McGee, to whom he detailed his exper
ience. McGee, a few minutes later, ar
rested Ah Doo, a highbinder, and took
him to the California-street police station.
Later he was removed to the City Prison.
Freeman called at the City Prison yes
terday morning and identified Ah Doo as
the man who held him up and he was at
once booked on the charge.
A Testimonial Concert.
A testimonial concert will be tendered to
Bernard Mollenhauer to-morrow by several
patronesses and the members of the San Fran
cisco Symphony orchestra. Mr. Mollenhauer
has labored faithfully for the musical interests
of the City and this concert is given htm as a
proof of the regard and esteem in which he is
lieM by those with whom he has been as.soci
ated professionally and socially. Miss Carrie
Bowes will play the "Hungarian Fantaeie," by
Liszt, with lull orchestral accompaniment and

vespers. Rev. Father Koran officiated on the
occasion and, at the conclusion of the cere

MENACED BY
CONVICT LABOR
Local Manufacturers May
Be Driven Out of
Business.
THE CONTRACT SYSTFM.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
Receives Important Infor
mation.
PRISON VS. FREE WORKMEN.
Thousands of Men Hired to Contractors
Who Flood the Country With
Cheap Goods.
The effort of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association and State Labor
Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald to devise
ways and means of ending the unfair com
petition of Eastern prisons with local
manufacturers is likely to be productive
of good results. The same fight is going
on In the East between free and convict
laborers, and the united movement of the
manufacturers all over the United States
will probably bear fruit in Congress.
There is now before that body what is
known as the Southwick convict labor
bill, which prohibits the sale in one State
of the goods made by convicts in another
State. New Jersey has instructed its rep
resentatives in Congresss to fight for the
bill and resolutions of a similar order
were recently sent to the Pacific Coast
delegation from the Manufacturers' Asso
ciation. Several other States whose
manufacturers are being injured by this
unfair competition have taken the same
stand.
That California has long been a dump
ing ground for goods made by convicts in
Eastern prisons has been known, but
the alarming extent of this trade was not
understood until Warden Hale of the San
Quentin prison went to the wardens' con
vention last year, where the lubject was
fully discussed.
Toe great disadvantage lies in the fact
that the convict-made goeds are sent to
this State in such a manner that they
cannot be distinguished from free-labor
articles, and no department of manufac
ture escapes. Efforts have been made to
have some distinguishing mark or brand
put on convict goods, and a few months
ago Commissioner Fitzgerald sent to the
National Manufacturers' Convention in
Chica&o a resolution which contained the
following:
Whereas, The said convict-made goods nre
sold in open competition with free-made goods
without brand or other distinguishing mark of
identification, therefore be it
Re*olvrd, That the Legislature of every State
be and In hereby respectfully requested to enact
the necessary measures to compel the proper
branding of such prison-made articles, and
that each political party be respectfully
requested to pledge its* legislative candidates
to support this said measure.
He did not stop there, but with a view
of learning the extent to which Eastern
convict-made goods enter into competition
with free labor, and what proportion of
the same is sent to California, he sent let
ters of inquiry to Labor Commissioners in
the East and Eastern State prison offi
cials.
The answers are beginning to arrive and
they show the situation uore alarming
and menacing to local manufacturers than
was before supposed. In a number of the
States gangs of convicts are let out to
manufacturers of all kinds of goods on
contracts. The articles they make are put
in with the free labor goods, and under
the name of the firm's brand are sent ail
over the country, not a ismall quantity
finding its way to this Stale.
Labor Commissioner L. G. Powers of
Minnesota states that in that State there
are four penal institutions where commer
cial articles are made. In the Stillwater
prison binding twine ana boots and shoes
are made under the contract system.
About $125,000 worth of twine is made
annually and sold principally in the two
Dakotas. The output of boots and shoes
from the same prison amounts to about
$170,000, and some two hundred convicts
are employed in this work. This footwear
product of contract-convict labor, it is^aid,
is sold through the contractors, the Union
Shoe and Leather Company of, St. Paul.
Mr. Powers says that this same firm ha? a
similar contractor two with the penal in
stitutions of Indiana. The output from
the latter State is handled through
Chicago. The writer says that there is no
way ol identifying these eoods by mark or
label.
Another important letter received by
Commissioner Fitzgerald was from Com
missioner W. E. O'Bleness of Dcs Moines,
lowa, llf says that manufacturing is done
in the Fort Madison penitentiary. Mr.
O" Bleness writes:
The State of lowa has a contract with three
manufacturing institutions who pay the State
48 cents per day per man, they furnishing the
raw material, the State furnishing the tools to
perform the labor with and the men. The
laws of the State do not require these manu
facturing institutions to mute any returns as
to the amount of goods manufactured or to the
place or penons sold.
The institutions having these men under
contract are Huiskamp Bros., manufacturers
of shoes, Keokuk, Iowa; the lowa Farming
Tool Company of Fort Madison, lowa, and the
Fort Madison Chain Company of Fort Madi
son, lowa.
They have no mÂ»ans of identificationâ are
not branded in any way. They are simply
taken to their different factories and sold with
other goods manufactured outside of the
prison and we have no means of knowing
when we buy their product whether it is
manufactured in the prison or iv the factories
outside of the prison. â¢ â¢ *
Mr. O'Bleness says that the labor or
ganizations have fought the convict con
tract system, but have only succeeded in
preventing it from growing.
According to the answer from Labor
Commissioner Charles H. Morse of Michi
fan the Legislature and Governor of that
cate believe in makinir its peniten
tiaries self-supporting even if competition
between free and convict labor is neces
sary. There are four penitentiaries in that
State where manufacturing is carried on.
Mr. Morse says:
* â¢ â¢ As to the names of the parties to
whom'the articles are sold^t would dp impossi
ble to give them. One person manufactures a
certain lines of furniture and I bsl'eve has
more than 1000 purchasers, and tney have not
oven the names of one-tenth of them. â¢ â¢ â¢
Our prison-mode goods are not branded or
marked in any way whatever. â¢ â¢ â¢
James L. Pace, warden of the State
prison of Missouri, writes to the Califor
nia Commissioner under the date of May 7
as follows:
We have only one. penitentiary in this State,
and have nearly 2300 convicts confined
therein. About one-third of them are worked
by contractors at so much per man per day in
different lines of manufacture. We have no
supervision over thos* who are worked by con
tractors, only to furnish guards Hnd maintain
them. Hence lam unabie to give you any in
formation as to the amount ol their products,
or the value of the same, or to whom sold or
as to whether or not uny Â«rf their products are
sold in the State of California.
In the State of Nebraska most of the
products of convicts' labor are harness,
saddles and cooperage, but whether any of
these are sent to this Slate Labor Com
missioner J. H. Powers is unable to state
at present.
Commissioner 8. B. Home of Connecti
cat writes that in the State prison work is
done, but that the amount of the product
or where or to whom sold is kuown only
by the contractors themselves.
S. J. Thompson, Chief of the Indaina
Bureau of Statistics, states that he is at
present unable to tell where the convict
made goods manufactured in that State
are gold.
Letters are being received by Mr. Fitz
gerald every day and the foregoing are
fa?r samples of them all. In a number of
States no goods are manufactured by con
victs, but other letters show that the out
put of those prisons where convicts com
pete with free labor must be enormous
and the goods a menace to every factory
in the United States. That California gets
more than her share of these products is
established beyond argument.
HE IS A LUMBER KING
Colonel C. W. Griggs on the
Business and Politics of
Washington.
The Man Who Came Near Being Made
United States Senator Says It Is
a Period of Change.
Colonel C. W. Griggs of Tacoma, man
ager and principal owner of the St. Paul
and Tacoma Lumber Company, and one
of the wealthiest men in the Nortnwest,
arrived here yesterday and is at the Pal
ace. He is one of the lumber kings of the
Northwest.
Colonel Griggs was formerly from St.
Paul, where he resided for thirty
years, and was a member of the Minne
sota Senate for twelve years. He also held
many other prominent political positions.
He is a Democrat, as conspicuous as any
in his State, and two years ago came very
near being elected United States Senator,
his friends sticking to him and balloting
for him long and arduously. They in
sisted that he could have been elected also,
if he had been willing to make some of
the ordinary concessions that are not in
frequently made at such times.
As one of the wheelhorses ofithe Democ
racy he is consulted as to the course of
the party in Washington, and has been a
heavy contributor to the victories the
party has had there.
The colonel owns an enormous lumber
mill at Tacoma and ships large quantities
of lumber to San Francisco. He is in
terested in seven different lumber yards
here. He discussed lumber and alluded
to the interesting things in politics.
"It has been so dull fn the Northwest for
the last three or four years," he said,
"that there was no show for a manu
facturer to make any money out of lum
ber. It has changed somewhat lately,
however, and now we think we have seen
the worst of the situation.
"In every way there is either an im
provement or indications of speedy im
provement, so # that I think business will
be good again in Washington before long.
"I am not much in politics now. At
'.east not as I was when I was in St. Paul,
where I lived so long. As for the Presi
dential outlook, it seems to me that the
Republicans are largely for one man.
They think he will win, but I do not care
to state what I believe will eventually re
sult. The coming Senatorial fight in
Washington is expected to be lively."
Colonel Griggs is in California to remain
about a month. His trip is for both busi
ness and pleasure.

BALDWIN'S COMMISSIONERS.
The Marshal Finds Himaelf Mixed Up
With the Washington Authorities.
United States Marshal Barry Baldwin
is in trouble in a small way with "the
powers that be" at Washington. The
Marshal contends that he has a right to
appoint a jury commissioner both for
the Circuit and District courts, but the
department entertains altogether a differ
ent view.
Mr. Baldwin appointed F. J. Edwards
as jury commissioner for the Circuit
Court, "and Captain McDonald to a similar
position in the District Court. In due
time these gentlemen, throueh the Mar
shal, forwarded their bills to Washington.
They were returned with the indorsement
that Mr. Baldwin had exceeded his
authority.
The department was willing enough to
allow the fees of one commissioner, but
two were more than they could or would
stand. The amount involved is only $15,
but Baldwin says he (joes not care any
thing for that. He is fighting for a
principle, and will win out if there is jus
tice in Washington.

JEATH OF J. A. JOHNSON.
;-'Â£x- Lieutenant Governor and
Warden of San Quentin
Passes Away.
I
VAS A life-long DEMOCRAT.
jjenerous 'and Warm-Hearted to His
; Friendsâ He Leaves but Few
Enemies.
I James A. Johnson, ex-Lieutenant-Gov
{rnorof Caliiornia, died yesterday morn
fig after a long" illness at; bis residence,
.535 Bush street, in this City. . :
i The deceased gentleman was well and
!The deceased gentleman was well and
Lvorably known in this City by a large
umber of persons. In fact he was be
wed most by those who knew him the
johgest. Gentle of manner, polite and
ourteous to all, he made friends where
jfver he went, and in addition to his inak
ng friends he had the rare gift of retain
ing friendships once made for all time.
âº Jis enemies wero very few, if any really
xisted. "Jim" Johnson, as bis imme
liate personal friends were often heard to
peak of him, was born in South Carolina
l*ri: 1829, and, when quite young, went to
Arkansas with his parents. In 1853 he
fame to California, and in ISG7 was elected
fa Congress from Dowuieville, and served
two terms. He then came to San Fran
cisco. He was Lie -Governor un
der Governor Is win in 1875. Under thÂ«
fid constitution the Lieutenant-Governor
vas also Warden of the State prison, and
The Late James A. Johnson. Formerly Lieotenant-Governor of California.
lived in San Quehtin in that capacity dur
ing his term as Lieutenant-Governor. He
.also served a term in the Legislature.
I Prior to coming to Calilornia he resided
for a short period in Arkansas, where he
studied medicine with the intention of be
coming a physician, but ro his finer feel
ing the suffering of humanity was of such
an unpleasant nature that he abandoned
it for the practice of law.
Since the end of his administration as a
Lieutenant-Governor and Warden of San
Quentin he resided in this City, wbere he
followed his profession as an attorney. At
one time he was said to possess real prop
erty in San Francisco valued at over $100.
-000, but owing to his generous nature and
indifference to the accumulation of wealth
he parted with a portion of it. He
was never known to say "No" to a friend
or acquaintance who a.-iked him for a
"loan never to be returned.
He resided with his family at the place
where he died. His widow is the daugh
ter of the late Jutige Bowers of San Rafael.
Her brother, Ewing, who holds a respon
sible position in the United States Branch
Mint in this City, resicles witn his sister,
who was the second wife of the deceased.
His first wife and the two children of that
union died years ago.
Deceased was always a pronounced Dem
ocrat. He succeeded himself in Congress
h\ 1868, and actively supported President
Johnson when his impeachment was at
tempted. At the close of the Irwin ad
ministration he retired to private life, but
continued to talce an active interest in the
success of his party. At one time he owned
and edited the Alta. After ceasing his
connection with that paper he became at
torney for the Donahue railroad. His
death resulted from an abscess of the liver.
Being a prominent Mason his funeral
will take place from the Masonic Temple
on Post street

at the residence of Mr. Folger, but is an
entirely independent organization.
The Puritan Bociety will hold its meet
ings in the Native Sons' building every
[ Sunday evening at 6:30 o'clock.
The following officers and chairmen
were elected: President, Georke B. Little
field; vice-president, Ray Simpson; secre
tary, Miss F. Scott ; corresponding secre
tary, Miss M. U. Simpson; treasurer, H.
W. Fargo; delegate to the union, J. F.

THE LABOR UNIONS
Three Plasterers Heavily Fined for
Breaking the Working-Card System.
The Painters' Union last evening de
cided to return three delegates to the
Trades and Labor Alliance. The proposi
tion to create a strike fund in the build
ings trade by a $2 50 assessment was de
feated by a vote of 4 for and 130 against.
The paper-bangers at present in the
Painters' Union will meet at 115 Turk
street on Friday evening and form a paper
bangers' union. The new union will re
ceive its clmrter from the Painters' Union.
At the Plasterers' Union three of the
members were heavily fined for violating
the working-card by working on the struck
job on First and Market streets.
The fraternity of hotel and restaurant
employes met last ni^ht and Eugene
Brown was elected as recording secretary.
Leon Brown was re-elected labor secretary.
He reported all members of the union at
work. An invitation was received from
Amalgamated Workers' Union No. 15 to
attend their mass-meeting this eyening at
8 o'clock, at 1159 Mission street.
DELICACIES OR DAMAGES
Peculiar Suit of the Crew of
the Trading Schooner
Viking.
They Want the Price of Extras Which
Should Have Been on the
Bill of Fare.
The crew of the schooner Viking, which
reached this port a few days ago after
eight or nine weeks at sea, filed a novel
suit in the United States District Court
yesterday.
It is a suit to recover certain alleged ne
cessaries of life, in the shape of bread,
meat, limejuice, peas, vinegar and sugar!
The crew, through the complaint tiled by
Attorney H. W. Hutton, claim that all of
these articles should have been furnished
them, but for some reason there was a
woeful lack of anything of the kind, so far
as they could obse/ve, on board the vessel.
For these gastronomic privations, J. Pe
terson, W. C. Sewans, John Johnson M.
Carroll and J. Kottia ask the court to
compel the J. F. Cunningham Company,
owners of the Vifcing, to pay them the
sum of $1427 50. It is tacitly admitted
by 'them that they were of sound body
and mind when the port of San Fran
cisco hove in sight, but they want the
price of what they should|have had.
The crew demands pay for limejuice,
peas and vinegar, for each a sum varying
from $29 to ?59 apiece. Then there was
the bread, which was $59, a head short,
and meat next on the list with $35. Sugar
in limited quantities was present, but on
the homeward voyage the bottom was
reached, and for thi3 the claimants want
Tnis is the first time the liability of a
ship-owner on tne question of short allow
ance of provisions on a voyage has been
brought up on the Pacific Coast. It is an
old-established principle of law that own
ers may be sued for inadequate provisions,
but a decision from the courts here will be
o* interest to sailors and shipping men
The Viking is the vessel which was six
weeks overdue from the Caroline Islands.
She had been given up as lost by her
owners, but she arrived safely in port last
week and the crew lost no time in bVing
mg action for their shortcomings.
HIS SENTENCE ILLEGAL.
Abe Majors, the Boy Burglar, May Soon
Be Removed From Folsom.
OAKLAND. Cal., May 11.-I. i 8i 8 now
considered certain that when Prison Di
rector Fitzgerald attends the next meet
ing of the board he will be furnished with
proof that Abe Majors, the boy burglar
is illegally imprisoned. Evidence has
been obtained that the youthful ciimiml
was only 15 years of age when he was sen
tenced to ten years at Folsom by Jud^e
Frick. "
The mistake was not discovered until
two weeks ago, when some San Jose peo
ple came to Oakland and called the atten
tion of Mrs. Wagner, the boy's mother, to
the fact, which was readily proven by re
calling various past incidents about the
time of bis father's (Lloyd Majors) death.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1896.
MADE BY CONVICT HANDS
Startling Statement About the
Work on the Grant
Monument.
GEANITE CUTTERS AROUSED.
Folsom Prison Felons Said to Be Con
structing All but the Gen
eral's Bust.
The monument in honor of the mem
ory of the late President U. S. Grant now
being erected in front of the museum in
Golden Gate Park is the work of convict
hands.
This statement caused the holding of a
special indignation meeting by the Gran
ite-cutters' Union at 11Â§9 Mission street,
and some fiery patriotic labor speeches
were made. Some time ago it was de
cided to erect a suitable monument to the
memory of General Grant, and in time
sufficient money was raised.
In order to make the money go as far
as possible the committee decided to get
the granite base and superstructure from
the quarry at Folsom.
Recently the stone arrived on the
ground in the park and a number of gran
ite-cutters, with an eye to business, went
out to see if tney could secure employ
ment, dressing and putting the finishing
touches upon the stone.
To their surprise they found the stone
was all cut and ready to be put in place.
They made inquiry and learned that it had
been done by the State prison convicts in
Folsom.
That this knowledge produced a storm
of indignation goes without saying. The
secretary at the meeting last evening said
he was surprised that such a thing should
be allowed â that a monument to the
memory of a deceased President of the
United States and a man of such fame
should be made by felons.
The speaker wondered if the public's
appreciation for U. 8. Grant's services had
reached such a low ebb that it would con
sent to have the granite raised to his honor
fashioned by the hands of cnt-throats,
forgers, horsethieves and other outlaws.
He further stated that about the only
work done by felons will be the bust of the
old general that Rupert Schmidt is to
make to surmount the whole inglorious
pile, and he added that he supposed the
reason this was not done in the peniten
tiary was because there are no sculptors
wearing stripes in Folsom.
This was not the only protest that the
granite-cutters have to make. They have
learned that the authorities at Folsom are
turning out dressed granite for other than
prison buildings. The law, as the granite
cutters have been informed, does not per
mit of this class of work being done by
convicts, who are only allowed to get the
rock out of the quarry.
All granite for buildings outside of the
prison walls must be cut and dressed by
free labor. "And yet we have learned,"
said the secretary, "that in Fohom there
are over fifty convicts who have been
taught the trade, and the product of their
labor is being shipped all over the State."
This, he said, deprives fifty free men of
employment.
In this connection another obstacle con
fronts the union. When these convict
granite-cutters are released from prison
they must be one of two things â scabs or
members of the union. The members of
the union are loath to take in ex-convicts
as members and they are equally opposed
to having the State create scab granite
cutters to fight the union. A dozen of
these fellows would do the trade much
damage.
The meeting lasted until a late hour,
and it was decided to tight the injustice to
the bitter end. It was the desire that the
public should be informed of the indignity
heaped upon tne name of U. 8. Grant.
The other grievance will be publicly
brought to the attention of the State
authorities, who, they believe, are well
aware of what is goinc on. If necessary it
is determined to light the proposition in
the courts to keep the convicts from fol
lowing the eranite-cutters' trade.
AT THE CITY THEATERS
Local Talent Displayed in a
Cake-Walk at the Cali
fornia.
Florence Thropp Applanded â The
Frawley Company Has a New
Leading Lady.
The Cakewalk at the California was the
subject of most absorbing interest at the
local theaters last night. There were a
number of local entries and the competi
tion was keen. No murmurs were heard,
however, as to the way in which the prizes
were given, for the audience picked out
the winners.
There were frosted cakes galore, as well
as other prizes for which Primrose <fe
West's Minstrels competed with local
talent. James Russell of New York and
.Miss Flora Daniels gained the majority
six points. C. Sidney O'Brien of San Fran
cisco won the second place. Mat John
son of New York took the third place,
with three points. Miss Rose Taylor of
San Francisco was presented with a basket
of flowers. The cake was won by B. John
son, one of the pickaninnies of the Prim
rose & West Company.
There was a large audience present,
which warmly applauded the efforts of the
cake-walkers. It was announced that the
gentleman gaining most points in the
series of cake walks during the week will
be presented with a gold watch.
At the Baldwin.
"The Strange Adventures of Miss
Brown," at the Baldwin Theater, was
embellished last night by two songs, the
singing of which is more in Eddie Foy's
style than is the acting of the title role in
the play.
He gave a parody on a well-known ditty,
which according to his version began,
"The Days of Old, When Ice Was Cold."
He also sanÂ« "He's Waiting for Me."
The latter received so many encores that
Foy was finally reduced to acting his last
verse in pantomime.
Morrison's " Faust."
Morrison's "Faust" is still drawing
well at the Columbia. The electrical ef
fects, particularly in the Brocken scene,
are the subject of considerable applause
"The Crossroads of Life."
"The Crossroads of Life" at the Grand is
a pronounced type of melodrama in which,
when the characters are pood, "they're
very, very good, and when they're bad
they're horrid.' Fred Butler as the
double-dyed villain, needless to say, is
"horrid," and Edmund Collier as the hero
is well-nieL flawless.
There are plenty of harrowing situations
when the company always rises to the
occasion, and the cool and haughty, if
somewhat stagy, manner in which Collier,
as the captain, foils the cunning schemer,
ired Sutler, quite brings down the house.
Florence Thropp made a charming Lil;>
Hawthorn, a girl who had several parts to
play, from dancing and hinging duets with
Hush Ward, "the honest bootblack," to
purloining documents from the villain at
the pistol r s point. Lisle Leigh acted with
considerable intensity, though the part of
Lady Lil, which she played a few weeks
aeo, suited her better. The rest of the
cast was good.
"Fra Diavolo."
"Fra Diavolo," which was revived last
night at the Tivoli, was mounted well and
the acting and singing were thoroughly
satisfactory. Martin Pache, who took the
part of the robber chief, acted and sang
with spirit. Carrie Roma as the English
Countess was refined and ladylike with
out either over acHng or becoming insipid.
Kate Marchi as Zerlina, the innkeeper's
daughter, sang prettily and caused plenty
of amusement. John J. Raffael as the
English nobleman was well got up with
the traditional blonde wig, Piccadilly
weepers and checker- board suit. Giacomo
and Beppo were more like American
tramps than classic brigands.
At the Orpheum.
John W. Ransone, the clever come
dian, with his political hits, is still the
star at the Orpheum. Last night he held
a house full of people with the same sure
grip he displayed when he was first intro
duced to an audience. Among the new
faces appearing last evening were those of
Wood and Shepard, who blend comedy
and music in their turn to such perfec
tion that it is difficult to tell which is
better liked.
The other performers who shared the
honors were Morton and Mack, Fields
and Lewis, and Charlotte Parry.
WRESTED FROM HIS GOLD
Death of a Miserable Miser Who
Left Fifteen Thousand
Dollars.
His Wearing Apparel and Unclean
Body Showed All the Traits
of His Character.
Cold in death, but sitting upright in a
rickety chair, surrounded by the cold, bare
walls of a dingy room in a cheap lodging
house at 883 Mission street was last even
inK found the body of Andrew Little, who
in life was a raiser, commiserated by the
world and likewise commiserated by him
self.
Sewed in the ragged lining of bis thread
bare vest were a number of bankbooks,
showing that in the saving institutions of
New York and this City there remained to
bis credit, after a few stinted drawings,
$15,348.
The house in which the unhappy man
died Is one where only those who are in
destitute circumstances, or those who have
money and are too mean to pay the price
for apartments in keeping with their
worldly wealth, reside.
One of the cheapest rooms in this
homely building was occupied by the
miser, and he paid |5 a month for its use.
He evidently thought that ha was paying
too much for the little room, as he tried
several times to have the rent reduced.
In a battened trunk which gave evidence
of most abject poverty waa found frag
ments of food of a varied description
loaves, half loaves and slices of blue
molded bread, pieces of sausage, crumbs
of cheese, pinches of salt and peeper tied
up in paper.
His wearing apparel was of snch a cnar
acter that it only accentuated his miserly
disposition. A shirt that at one time was
white had lost its virgin hue and turned to
a dirty yellow.
No crazvquilt could ever dare compare
to it in the variegated complexion of the
thousands of patches of all kinds, from
grainbacs to cambric of the finest tenure,
sewed on with equally fine thread.
His underclothing was filthy.
Death must have taken place at least
two days ago, as it is that length of time â 
since any person in the house saw him
alive.
It was evident to the Coroner's deputies
the man had been a miser.
Sewed in his vest pocket were found
several bankbooks, while others were sim
ilarly secured on the inside of his coat.
The books showed an aggregate of $15,348,
with a small balance to his credit in the '
old Clay-street Savincs and Loan Society. ,

The first deposit bad been made in 1875,
and the last in January, 1894.
The bulk of the money is in the savings
banks of New York: In the Bowery Sav
ings Bank, in trust for his niece, Jane
Little, who resides at Medford, Ontario,
Canada, is deposited $3480. In the same
bank, to his own credit, $3180.
In the Bank for Savings at 67 Bleecker
street. New York, $2379; in the Broadway
Savinars Institution, three deposit-books
for $1463, $1714 and $735 respectively; in
the German Savings and Loan Society in
this City, $2397.
His ledger was kept on what remained
of an old paper collar. Clippings from
every conceivable book, newspaper and
periodical, with extracts from the Bible
and an abundant collection from the Ross-
Yorke controversy, with old musty letters
and duplicate drafts on banks, were tied
together with twine.
Probably because of so many deposits
in so many banks, the following disjointed
statement* was written on the back of a
time-stained card :
"Only one class of deposits owe rate of
interest paid. With reference to eleventh
clause, to have the interest credited upon
the passbook*, will sufii^e to contain the
interest, but when.- the account reaches
$3000 no interest is paid on express over
that amount as per State law."
The deceased miser was aged about 65
years, and from his naturalization papers,
which were tak^n out forty-nine years
ago, it was shown that he was a native of
Scotland.
He had been in the house where he was
found dead only a short time, but he was
known to have lived in the same blocK in
the Mission for the past five years.
So far as is known he had no relatives in
this City or State, consequently the Pub
lic Administrator will take charge of his
hoarued wealth.

Miss Lillian Ashley Tells
All Her Story in
Court
THE DOORS ARE CLOSED
Baldwin's Counsel Does Not
Want the Testimony to
Get Out.
TRIED WITHOUT A JURY.
The Plaintiff Was Unable to Put Up
the Necessary Fees for the
Jurors.
The doors of Judge Slack's courtroom
were discreetly closed yesterday, for the
Ashley-Baldwin case was going on. It was
Mr. Lloyd's idea to close the doors- He
rhe Plaintiff, Lilian Ashley, and Her Principal Counsel, J. R. Crittenden.
thought, early in the morning, that the
testimony would be such as to contami
nate such part of the public mind as
had gathered to hear and to see, so he in
voked the moral aid of the Penal Code and
asked that counsel and principals, clerk,
baliff and stenographers and his Honor be
the only ones allowed at the bar.
There being no objections from plaint
iff's tableful of counsel the order was
was made, and there was a general out
pouring of the spectators, who seemed to
think it wrong that the morals they were
willing to risk should be so tenderly cared
for by counsel. The courtroom cleared,
Mr. Crittenden made his opening state
ment, and then Miss Ashley came to the
stand.
Tall, of medium build, a face plain and
impassive, a dress of simple black, the
plaintiff did not at all look like a woman
who might captivate a millionaire from
far across the continent. She was the
only witness. She cried a little at first,
but the questions put were vague enough
to be merciful while direct enough to
bring out the story, and so for^the remain
ing hours of the session she told the story
of her shame and how E. J. Baldwin be
came the cause of it.
During part of the afternoon session her
child played innocently around the court
room, but its prattle disturbed the atten
tion of the lawyers and so the little one
wÂ«s banished.
The case had been continued from last
week by an order of Judge Slack calling
upon the plaintiff in the case either to find
. money fer the fees or waive a jury. Judge
â  Slack expressed a strong dislike to try the
case without a jury, and even hinted that
perhaps another department of the Supe
rior Court might be more accommodating;
but when the parties came into court this
morning and Attorney Crittenden, repre
senting Miss Ashley, said that no arrange
ment for fees had been arrived at, his
Honor said: "Very well, gentlemen, I will
try the case alone. I dislike to do it very
much, but it seems the only way."
Bo the jurors were ordered out of court,
to return when called upon. Miss Ashley,
attired as before in black, took a seat at
the table in front of the Judge's bench
with her attorney, James Crittenden, in
close attendance, while Reuben H. L,loyd
and Henry Â£. Hignton ministered to the
interests of their millionaire client, who
occupied a modest seat in the rear of the
room. Crittenden opened the suit by of
fering several depositions for filing. The
depositions bore the names of Dr. Richard
J. Mohr, Silaa L. Thomas, A. H. Anderson,
A. L. Truewortby, Nancy C. Orennan and
B. Porter Ashley, all from Los Angeles or
Pasadena, wheuce the plaintiff comes.
The depositions were ordered opened and
filed.
Miss Ashley's testimony began with the
time she first met Baldwin in her home in
the East; how he spoke to her and gave
her money; how he asked her to come
and Bee him in California, and how he
told her how glad he would be if she would
only come. He would find a position for
her â he would Bee that she got along all
right, and she was to be a daughter to him.
She came out to meet him and he pave
her a room in the Baldwin Hotel. He
used to come and visit her in the evening,
she said, and be used to repeat how lonely
he was, no one to see, no one to care for
Dim, and -with all his millions no one
whom he could come to and confide iv.
He wanted her to be a daughter to him ;
he wanted her to be his friend.
She stayed awhile at the Baldwin Hotel
and then went down to the Coronado
Hotel. Baldwin went with her. Then
â  ahe went with him to Arcadia, where his
ranch was, and there they walked and
rode and played croquet.
The plaintiff had made demands upon
Baldwin to assist her in her troubles, but
she said there was no response, and so she
started home to her folks in the East,
bringing with her her child.
The witness got no further in her story
yesterday, but she will finish to-day.
Then she will be cross-examined, and it
will be more of an ordeal than was the
getting of her direct testimony.
A PRIESTLY FRAUD.
John Lawrence, the Self-Styled Bishop
of Honolulu, Has Arrived Here
From Portland.
John Lawrence, who posed as a Catholic
Bishop in Honolulu and as a priest in the
southern part of this State, has arrived
from Portland. He has just been re
leased from jail in the latter city, where he
served out a term of imprisonment for
having opened, unauthorized, a telegram
addressed to Father Dielman of Astoria.
Lawrence is, according to all accounts,
a notorious fraud. He foists himself upon
Catholic priests wherever be lands, and
when soon found out, as he always is, he
makes to some other locality where he
comes out under a new name and sacred
title. It is reported that he is now the
self-styled Vicar Apostolic of Guiana.
After a varied experience in this State,
when he was a number of times driven out
of bouses where be had settled himself, he
appeared in Portland last fall. He boldly
announced himself as the Bishop of Hono
lulu. The address and cool audacity of
the fellow deceived a number of the clergy.
He domiciled himself with Fattier Orth of
St. Francis Church, and succeeded in get
ting Archbishop Gross' permission to cele
brate mass and deliver a lecture. His
rambling and disjointed delivery aroused
suspicion, and upon investigation it was
found that the "Bishop of Honolulu" was
a rank impostor. He even represented
himself to Archbishop Gross as being an
old classmate of Leo XIII, and that he had
visited Rome in 1895, at the Pope' 9 invita
tion.
Upon being exposed he vanished and in
a few days reappeared at Astoria, when he
was arrested.
As this arch impostor is in San Fran
cisco or vicinity it is well for the public
and especially the Catholic clergy and
sisterhood to be on their guard. He is a
short, heavy-set man about 60 years of

wears the purple stock of a bishop. His
stories are shaky and improbable, but his
coolness and presumption are magnince nt.
Failure never disconcerts him. and when

ALERT FOR THE STUFFERS
Registration Will Be Conducted
This Year Under the
General Law.
REGISTRAR HINTON'S VIEWS.
The Great Register Wi'l Close Nearly
Three Months Before the
Election.
It is predicted for the stuffer at the elec
tion, the political colonizer, that he will
have a most unhappy time. Judge Wal
lace, in the case of Sternbers, has set up
an example, as it were, on the gateposts
of the City showing what may happen to
him when he is found out. Registrar flin
ton has already begun to make prepara
tions for the finding of him out.
He is having a careful listing made of all
the lodging-houses and hotels in the City,
and noting their capacity in the matter of
housing people. In every case where
there is any notable increase in the
number of men registered from any one
of these houses over the number which
it is known to harbor at dates remote from
the date of registration, a careful investi
gation will be made. He said yesterday:
"The Board of Election Commissioners
has put upon me the responsibility of de
ciding whether the work of registration
shall be done under the provisions of the
Civil Code as amended by the last Legis
lature or whether it shall be done under
the special act of 1887. I shall try to get
the matter before the Supreme Court in
some way, but if unable to do bo I shall,
in the absence of any decision in the
matter, decide in favor of the amended
code â that is to say, the general law. I
think it is safer to do so. Besides, while
on general principles I am in favor of
special laws for tjan Francisco, because
the laws that apply to counties generally
cannot be made to tit to a great city ; still,
'â¢n this case, I think the general law is
better. To be sure, upon trial it may be
found to develop more ills than it corrects.
"There is one thing that is reasonably
certain, however â it makes it more diffi
cult to colonize voters. It requires that
the great register be opened 160 instead
of 90 days before the election, and it must
close 85 days before it. This not only
gives the Registrar and the Election Com
missioners more time to investigate and
purge the roll of illegal voters, but it
makes it more expensive to colonize. It
will cost money to pay the expenses of the
colony voters for eighty-five aays previous
to the election.
"On the other hand, this may work a
hardship to legitimate voters who change
their residence within that time. To be
sure transfers may be effected on the
books. s
"No certificate of transfers will be given,
as that was found to develop a ereat cvil â
any holder of the transfer being able to
vote. The transfer limit is twenty-seven
days before the election. After that date
the roll stands, except as frauds are dis
covered.
"The constitutional provision requires a
man to reside a year in the State, ninety
days in the city and county and thirty
days in the precinct. If he has been reg
istered before the books are closed to him,
eighty-five days before election, and after
ward moves into some other precinct, he
may have himself transferred on the
books.
"If colonizers, to save expense, remain
at their proper place of residence and are
registered there, and afterward migrate
in numbers into some other districts just
previous to the twenty-seven days' limit,
they will the more readily be followed and
watched, for these reasons I think the
general law is a better one. I believe that
the roll, by careful watching this year,
may be kept reasonably free from fraudu
lent voters."
His Idea of a Swell.
A small boy who lives in Leeds, Eng.,
was one day calling on a school friend, and
fell into conversation with his friend's
mother. He finally remarked that it was
getting very hard to tell, from the places
in which people live, whether or not thay
are entitled to social consideration.
"Now, tnere is Blank street," he said,
"you wouldn't think anybody was much
thatJiyed on Blank street, would you? But
tnere is Mr. Tornson, he lives there."
â¢'And is Mr. Tomson much?"
"Mr. Tomson!" with an air of one over
whelmed by astonishment that such an
obvious fact should escape anybody. "I
should think he was! He's an awful
Bwell. Why, he won't apeak to my father."
â¢ â¦ â â¦
Wanted a Change;
A little four-year-old in the family of
Valentine Cornelius of Richmond Hill evi
dently believes in having a share of the
good things of life and equal rights with
all. During the recent stormy period the
little one stood near the window gazing
out at the storm, which had kept him
within doors several days. Finally he
turned to his father and asked:
"Is this God's day, papa?"
The question was a poser, but the father
ceased the perusal of his paper long
enough to reply:
"Yes, they are all God's days."
"Well, when is he going to give us a
day?" was the little one's next inquiry,
delivered after some moments of silence. â

WHOM WILL THEY MARRY?
Pennsylvania Girls Who Hare Taken a
Vow "Never to Marry Men."
Ten young ladies belonging to the best
families of the town of Baden, Beaver
County, about twenty miles from Pitts
bure, have organized a boycott against
the boys of the place, says the Press. The
girls have organized what they call the
"Trilby Club." have vowed "never to
marry men, and won't even go with the
horrid things."
The cause of this strange action on the
part of the ten girls is a grievance they
have nursed. It seems that the boys of
the town expected the girls to make some
use of their leap-year privileges. The
girls, on the contrary, wanted the boys to
be as attentive as ever. The upshot was
that indignation meetings were held and
ten of the most determined young ladies
formed the Trilby Club and took a solemn
oath never to wed.
Baden is far enough from this city to
depend on its own ability for entertain
ment. While the weaker of the girls go
on as usual the ten members of the club
have remained out of young men's society.
Instead they hold meetings at their own
homes. These meetings a member of the
club describes &a revels. At one meeting
they all dressed in their brothers' clothing.
At another they dressed as ballet girls.
One of the female stoics says the ballet
was the "bnlliest show" she ever saw.
The club is about to purchase bloomers
and wheels and enjoy life without mascu
line aid.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperatur- for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therm?, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word â¢â hleh" means high barometric prtssure and
ls usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Whi-n the pressure is high in the interim
and low aiong the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
bi:twhen the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of (iregon is improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falllm fo the California' coast, warmer
i iv summer and colder
er in winter, fhe reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Im.. May 11.â The prevalence of !
hot weather throughout the West as a menace to
the growing vegetation had a strengthening effect
on the tone of the wheat market this morning, but j
prices failed to reach a higher point than was es- j
tablished at the opening. When the Weather I
Bureau's predictions of rains and showers from !
the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains were is
sued values fell with rapidity and all buying en
thustaTKU disappeared/ The weather was the main
factor in the market and will continue so for some
time. Liverpool cables were steady at i*d decline.
Receipts in the Northwest were 379 cars, against
479 last Monday and 237 a year ago.
Chicago received fourteen cars and inspected out
160,441 bushels. The expectation was that the
Government report would show from four to six I
points improvement . in winter wheat for the !
month. The visible supply decreased 1,519,000
bushels, the amount on ocean passage Increased
969,000 bushels and the English visible supply de
creased 982.000 bushels. The world's shipments
were 8,714,000 bushels. Paris and Antwerp clos
ing cables gavo slight advances, while Berlin
quoted Vi to 33, i marks decline. Export clear
ances were 195,500 bushels. July wheat opened
from 64c. t0 643/ B e, declined to 62% c, closing at
6'S\'^d.6'3 1 Â«j's c under Saturday, Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow, 23 cars.
CORNâ Offered nothing interesting in its trade.
While the feeling at the start was firm It was not
so on the individual merit of the train, but through
sympathy with wheat, and when the market for
the latter declined, nothing remained to support
prices or sustain the tone. Receipts were 104 cars
and 221.626 bushels were taken from store. Liver
pool cables were dull and unchanged. The visible
supply decreased 982.000 bushels and the amount
on ocean passage increased 320,000 bushels. Ex
port clearances amounted to 228,871 bushels.
July corn opened from 50%@30%c, declined to
30 -, closing at 20Vsc, %c under Saturday. Esti
mated recelp s for to-morrow 215 cars.
' OATSâ Were higher at the opening, but the gain
was not retained for long. Wheat and corn show
ing sinking tendencies, oats were imbued with a
like feeling through sympathy. Receipts were
! 144 cars. There were no withdrawals from store.
The visible supply aecreased 3*8,000 bushels.
July oats closed Vi@3/ <c under Saturday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 220 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 86c; July, 85% c;
September, 87 Vie. Receipts were 16 cars.
. PROVISIONSâ in product were in a
despondent mood. The hog receipts were very
heavy, the tone of grain depressing and specula
tion lifeless. . Prices were weak and declining on
the influences mentioned. July pork closed 5@
7%c lower: July lard unchanged, and July ribs a
shade lower.
BUTTERâ Was easier to-day than It closed last
week. Receipts were liberal, and there was con
siderable carried over. The demaod was only fair.

market was fairly active and prices were only 5@

was a fair packing demand, but the large offerinca
caused a decline of 6@loc. On a good demand

Rev. Dr. Wendte Heals Differ
ences Between Two Hu
mane Societies.
JOHNS SPOKE FOR HIMSELF.
His Criticisms Did Not Represent the
Vtews of the Other Direc
tors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 11. f
Harmony again prevails between the
California Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children and the Alameda
County Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals. Discord was created by
some utterances credited to Attorney C.
T. Johns, and peace has been brought
: about Dy the intervention of Rev. Dr.
. Wendte."
For a long time the opinion has pre
. vailed that the two societies were at vari
ance, but the facts only became public to
day.
Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott, formerly matron
of the Chabot Home, is the secretary of
the children's society, and Mrs. Sarah
Sanford, wife of County Treasurer Sanford,
is the secretary of the animal society.
Both societies occupy the same office in
the Central Bank building and everything
went on smoothly until the arrest of old
man Clark in Kast Oakland, who was ac
cused of serious crimes, gleaned from the
stories of little girls who were visitors to
his home.
Rev. Mr. Ellis of the Centennial Presby
terian Church espoused the cause of Clark,
whose name is on his church roll.
Mr. Ellis fought hard for Clark and
made all sorts of charges of the children
being coached by Mrs. Prescott, and the
lady in turn refuted the accusations. A
wordy battle in the local papers took place.
During the trouble Attorney C. T.
Johns was quoted as making slurring re
marks about Mrs. Prescott aud express
ing himself to the effect that she would
be compelled to move her office. When
this was made known to Mrs. Prescott
she was quite indignant and was prepar
ing to change her quarters when Attorney
C. T. Johns sent a denial of the speech
credited to him to General McCombof Saa
Francisco.
Mrs. Prescott was not satisfied. The
report had gone out publicly that she was
not wanted, and as no public denial
had been published she felt hurt, j
lira, Sanford asked her to remain, with- i
out avail, and preparations were being |
made to remove, when C. T. Johns, seeine
the matter had taken a serious turn, sent
a letter to Charles tionntag of San Fran
cisco, the president of the S:ate Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
denying that he had adversely criticized
Mrs. Prescott's methods in her work, and
begged that she reconsider her intention
to remove elsewhere and that she would
continue to occupy the office in the Cen
tral Bank building.
Mrs. Sanford also sent a communication
of the same nature.
Rev. Dr. Wendte, the president of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, sent his indorsement in the
following letter:
Charles Sonntag Esq., President California
Society jor the Prevention oj ( rueltyto Children â
My l>i:.vÃ ?ir: It has come to my notice within
a day or two that C. T. Johns, a director of our
Alameda County Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, has made some strictures
upon the course of your local agent, Mrs. Pres
cott. 1 regard this as most unfortunate and
regretable, and as president of our Alameda
County society desire to inform you that Mr.
Johns'" views are not indorsed by our officers
and members. They are purely his own
opinion. Indeed, he now states that ne was
uiisreported and has, I understand, written a
letter of regrets to Mrs. Prescott.
However this may be, our i-ociety has no in
tention of criticzmg its sister organization.
As sevt-ral of our directors are out of town I
cannot call a mestini?, but I know from con
versation that they all agree with me in this
matter. I trust, therefore, that the friendiy
relations which have hitherto existed between
the two organizations will not be interrupted
by this untortunate incident, and that you
will continue to occupy jointly with us the
convenient aud central offices at the present
location. We can help each other much, and
purely ought to co-operate in the work of
mercy to man and beast. With respect, yours,
ChaÂ«. W. Wendte,
President Alameda county 8. P. C. A.
This letter was the power that smoothed
over the troubled waters, and Mrs. Pres
cott will continue to carry on her work at
the deskroom assigned her in the rooms of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Aniniafi.
ALAMEDA CITY TRUSTEES.
F. N. Delanoy 's Preposition Re
garding the Stringing of
Electric Wires.
The School Census Shows a Good
Gain in the Younger Pop
ulation.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 11.â At the regu
lar meeting of the City Trustees this even
ing bills to the amount of $2117 were
passed for payment.
F. N. Delanoy sent the following com
munication: "As I notified you last Mon
day evening I commenced on Tuesday last
to set the poles for the new electric light
plant which I am preparing to establish
in Aiamw'a. I have at this time set the
poles on Clement avenue, from Che-tnut
to Park Btreets; but before planting any
poles on Park street I desire to make a
proposition to you which I be ieve will
avoid the necessity of erecting poles on
Park street. I nave examined poles be
longing to the city of Alameda, and am
samfi 'd there is plenty of room on them
to piace another cross arm sufficient for
ir>y purposes. If you will permit me to
string my wires on your poles on Park
street I will pay you any reasonable
rental for that use, or if you would prefer
it for the same service I will allow you to
string your wires on my poles in any part
of the city to a like amount. I sincerely
â¢hope that you will favorably consider
; these propositions and give an early
answi r.
The request was denied.
A letter was read from the Municipal
League offering und desiring to second the
efforts of the city authorities in fighting
the injunction suit against the city,
and offering to employ an associate
counsel to help the City Attorney to
further the case. Mr. George T.
Wrights was nominated. The City Attor
ney suggested the nanw of A. A.
Moore ol Oakland if any assistance was
required, but he did no' think it was nec
essary. The matter was referred to the
Judiciary Committee, with power to act.
The City Attorney, in answer to a re
quest, stated that no one has a right to
put any pole op in front of a residence
without a permit oi the city, and the
owner ie perfectly justified in cuttinp the
pole down.
The application to withdraw franchise
aj -plied for by F. M. Delanoy was ac
cented.
A. L. Fish, contractor, was allowed
thirty days' extra time to put in boilers
and engine at the electric light works.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1896.
HIS LIFE WORK IN PERIL
Progress Demands the Extinc
tion of the Beautiful Kirk
ham Canebrake.
GRIEF OF THE OLD GARDENER
A Strong Protest Will Be Made
Against the Proposed Opening
of Fallon Street.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, May 11. )
The old gardener who for thirty years
has looked after the beautiful grounds of
the Kirkham estate is heart-broken at thp
prospect of seeing his life vrorfc ruthlessly
spoiled. For a whole generation the old
Scotchman has faithfully tended the mag
nificent canebrake, which is the finest in
the State, and now the old enemy of na-
tureâ the march of civilization â demands
that a common highway be made right
through the old garJener's idol.
In 1882 General Kirkham, since de
ceased, General Keyes, also now dead, and
Mr. Bacon deeded to the city the title to
the land necessary for the continuation of
Fallon street whenever it became neces
sary to open it. The Council considers
that the time has now come for opening
Fallon street from Eighth to Eleventh,
and nave introduced the initial step to
ward having the work done.
The street, when opened, will pass
throu.h some of the prettiest gardens in
Oakland. It will be run close to the creek,
there being fully 250 feet of unland east of
the street on the Kirkham place. All of
this is covered with flowers, shrubs and
trees. The cunebrake on the Kirkham
place, which is on the direct line of the
street, will have to be removed. The Ba
con residence faces the east, and the street
wnen opened will pass the front of the
house. On the property are some roman
tic old oaks, which will tend to make the
street one of the prettiest in the city.
Tiie property-owners do not think the
time has yet arrived when the street should
be opened, and have employed ex-Mayor
W. R. Davis to try to persuade tne
Council that the beautiful places should
not be cut up.
"The matter will not be taken into the
courts." said Mr. Davis, "for I believe the
Council will see the justice of the protest
and postpone action on the street opening.
Tne pitn of the matter is here. We do not
deny the deed given by Generals Kirkham
and Keyes and Mr. Bacon to the city in
1882, which conveys to the city the title to
the street whenever it shall be necce?sary
to open it, but we do not believe that it
should be done until the street is opened
clear through to Twelfth street.
"When the Eighth-street bridge was
being built and the street opened through
the Kirkham property to the eastern end
ail the hoodlums and people of vicious
character used to congregate there, and
we believe if Fallon street is opened only
part of the way through it would be an
other trystin^-place for them."
Due to the Whistle Ordinance.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 11.â A Coroner's
jury t>roueht in a verdict to-night that in
ferred that a city ordinance, passed about
a year ago and known as the celebrated
"whistle ordinance," was responsible for
the death of Mrs. Rose Lima, who was
killed this morning at tho curve off Sev
enth street, where the Berkeley and over
land tracks curve onto tha mole.
After hearing the evidence the jury re
turned a verdict exonerating the trainmen
and recommending that the ordinance be
amended so as to make it imperative for
all trains to whistle when rounding the
curve. It was shown that the train was
only fifty feet off when it came in sight
and that it was impossible to stop It in
time. The witnesses thought that if the
train Dad whistled the woman's life might
have been saved.
May Have to Meet Bonds.
The Eighth-street bridge matter came
up before the City Council to-night. En
gineers Holmes and Nusbaumer, who have
surveyed the bridge for the East Oakland
electric road, reported that it needed re
pairs, but wa3 quite safe. The Council de
cided to inspect the bridge next Thursday.
Councilman Towle caused a surprise by
stating that the municipal bonus amount
ing $140,000 may have to be provided for
in the next tax levy, an the decisions of
the Supreme Court "had destroyed con
j fidence in their re-issue. An election was
held last fall and it was decided to re-issue
the bonds, but there are grave doubts as
to the legality of the procedure. They
matured last year and have not been called
in owing to an agreement with the bank
that is at present holding them.
Rutherford Succeed* Kdwards.
David Rutherford was elected at to
night's meeting of the Board of Education
to succeed Colonel Edwards, who resigned
last week. Rutherford was a School Ci
rector four years ago. The board awarded
the contracts for text-books and author
ized forty-five changes in the books that
will in future be used in the High School.
" The Cottage " to Go.
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 11.â The trouble
HER PLEA FOE PRIVILEGES IS GRANTED.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 11.â "If your Honor please," said Miss Frankie ,rÂ«ru-Â«.
in the Police Court this morning to JudgeWond. "I only exercised the privilege
taken advantage of by men and took a few drinks too many."
â¢â¢So I understand, madam," said the Judge, looking carefully at the lady
standing in the dock, "and you may take advantage of a man's privilege of pay
ing 116, to avoid serving three days in the City Prison. Next."
Â» [/Sketched in the courtroom, by a "Call" artist.]
over "The Cottaee," the resort near the
Twelfth-street dam, was settled by the
City Council to-night. After hearing the
protests and the manner in which the li
cense had been transferred the Council
ordered the Chief of Police to close the
place altogether.
Their Children Were Married.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 11.â The parents
of Emile Maggis and Mary Jane Thorold
were surprised to-day to discover that
their children were married. The records
of the County Clerk's office show that
Emile and Mary Jane had obtained a mar
riage license sometime ago and swore that
tney were 21 and 19. They elooed and
were married. Their parents assert that
they are only 17 and 16 years old and
threaten arrest if they do not separate.
Overcame the Temptation.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 11.â Rev. C. E.
Jefferson has arrived home at Chelsea,
Mils*., and in his speech to his congrega
tion lie said, referring to his cali from this
city:
"To deny the call to California was to
resist a strong temptation. The church
there has a membership of 1200. It is the
largest Congregational church west of Chi
cago, the people are hospitable and the j
climate is beautiful; but I prefer to re
main in the East."

BLIND MEN ARE ACTIVE.
Two Important Additions to Be
Made to the List of Manu
factured Goods.
Hammocks and Pushbrcoms Meet
With the Approval of the
Directors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, May 11. >
An important step was taken by the
directors of the Blind Home at to-night's
meeting. They decided to add hammocks
and pushbrooms to the materials already
manufactured at the ht>me. This will, it
is stated, add materially to the income
earned by the inmates.
It all came about by a request from the
inmate-, who have met and discussed plans
which they believed would result in bene
fiting themselves.
It was the regular monthly meeting and
there were present Directors Coogan,
Hirshberg and Glascock. Directors James
and Leach were absent. The latter has
attended only one meeting since the board
\v;is reorganized and then sent his resigna
tion to the Governor, which has not" yet
been accepted.
Superintendent Hayes in his report
says : "I am glad to report the sales for this
month have materially increased, being
4G07 brooms over January sales, 4406 over
February and 2868 over Martfh and our
brooms are giving better satisfaction."
SATISFIED AS IT IS.
Majority of the Residents of Llvermore
Decide That They Do Not Want
to Re in corporate.
LIVERMORE, Cal., May 11.â A very
exciting election was held to-day, the
most important question before the voters
being the reincorporation of the town as
a city of the sixth class. The reinco rpor
ators were headed by Editor R. W. Lllis
and the opposition by* H. H. Pitcher, the
banker.
A peculiarity of the returns is that al
though the Pitcher candidates for Trus
tees were all defeated, the project to re
incorporate was also defeated. The new
Board of Trustees is in favor of reincor
poration.
The results of the election are:
Trusteesâ S. Feller, J. L. Mitchnll,
George Beck, A. W. Feidler and J. L. Me-
Keown. These nve are the successful
candidates, defeating tlit Pitcher ticket,
composed of H. H. Pitcher, J. V. Ryan,
Pat Callahan, A. Bristorious and Joseph
Fletcher.
George Taylor was elected Marshal and
W. H. Wright succeeds himself as As
sessor.
The reincorporation vote stood: For
30, against 73, and was therefore hope
lessly defeated, the small vote showing
that little interest was taken in the matter.

THE NORTH END
IS (ROUSED,
Indignation at the Delay
in Building on the Old
Hall Site.
A BIG MEETING CALLED.
Supervisors to Be Asked to Be
gin the Construction
at Once.
AN AGGRESSIVE ORGANIZATION
A Charge That the Pesthouse Resolu
tion Was Instigated by Market-
Street People.
"The North End aroused. The building
on the old City Hall site must be erected
at once. Important meeting of property
owners and storekeepers."
The above is the startling announce
ment in boldfaced type at tne head of a
circular mailed yesterday to the owners of
property in the vicinity of the site of the
old City Hall on Kearny street and to
many outside of the immediate vicinity.
One was also sent to each storekeeper on
Kearny street from Sutter north. The cir
cular announces that a meeting will be
held in Judge Campbell's courtroom to
morrow evening and adds:
Every property-owner, taxpayer and busi
ness man on Kearny street and streets adja
cent to the building site are earnestly re
quested to be present.
The shameful delay in the speedy erection of
this needed building has not alone been a
great injury to the laboring classes in general
but a serious damage to property interests in
this section and the whole northern section of
the City as well. All persons interested are
most urgently requested to be present. Able
speakers will briefly address the meeting and
expose the high-handed political Jupglery that
has been a menace and drawback to the most
beautiful section of the City.
The only signature to this document is
that of Robert E. McGregor, secretary
pro tern. The prime mover in the matter
is one Lichtenstein, who owns a piece of
property on Kearny street, near Pine, and
who is opposed to the resolution adopted
at a recent meeting of the Supervisors
postponing the erection of the proposed
municipal building on the old City liall
site for four months. One of the most
prominent men he has enlisted in the
movement is John Shirley, at one time a
member of the Board of Supervisors, and
the owner of considerable property in the
North End.
"This movement," said Mr. Shirley,
last night, "is to be one at first intended
to show the Supervisors the injustice of
this unnecessary delay in going on with
the work of putting up the municipal
building contemplated. The money is on
hand, and there is no just reason why the
work should not have been commenced
long ago. We hope that the Supervisors
may see tnat they have made a mistafce,
and that they will rescind the resolution
of postponement.
"This talk of trouble about the archi
tects is all nonse," continued Mr. Shirley.
"It is a movement in the interest of Mar
ket-street property-owners, who hope that
by delaying the proposed improvements
business would become so dull in the
north end that storekeepers will move to
Market street. This postponement is but
a step in a movement, so rumor has it,"
and Mr. Shirley emphasized rumor,
"to still further delay building
until after the Legislature meets, when an
effort is to be made to obtain authority to
build a county jail on the site instead of a
municipal building. But that we will not
have. "We do not want a county jail ; we
want a portion of the municipal govern
ment at the .North End.
"If no action is taken by the Super
visors in this matter, we shall organize an
aggressive movement, just as we did when
there was opposition to the opening of
Montgomery avenue. At that time the
property -owners organized and controlled
the votes against all candidates who op
posed the opening of the avenue. They
will organize again and agitate until the
municipal building is erected.
"Headquarters will be established in
Montgomery block. We have with us
people along Kearny street as far south as
Sutter, and ex-Congressman W. A. Piper,
whose property is all in the vicinity of
Market street, is witn us, because, as he
said, of the manifest injustice to the peo
ple of the North End. Tnere will be good
speakers at the meeting on Wednesday
night and some good and effective talk
ing."
IT WAS AN OUTRAGE.
Judge Groezinger LMsiuUgea the Charge
of Failure to Provide Against W.
G. Hughes, Contractor.
The case of W. G. Hughes, building
contractor, charged by his wife with
failure to provide, was tried by Judge
Groezinger yesterday and promptly dis
missed.
Mrs. Hughes testified that her husband
had been neglecting to provide for her and
their two youngest children, and since
last December she bad only got 50 cents
from him.

duced an absolute decree of divorce from
his wife, obtained in Judpe Wallace's
court in December, 1890. Although he
was under no oblieation to provide for her,
he had since then paid her in various
amounts for the support of herself and
two children over $5000. She had been
drawing $40 per month from the rents of
his property, and he had given her besides
as much money as he could. He had also
given over to her the furniture and other
personal property in his house valued at
about $1500. On March 11 she went to him
with a tale of poverty and he gave her $35,
all the money be had.
"He is a perjurer," interrupted Mrs.
Hughes; "he only gave me $30."
"And yet,'' said Hughes, "she swore I
had only given her 50 cents since last De
cember. All 1 want is that she should
keep away from me. She draws the rents
of my property and she has my House
hold effects, and I can do no more for her.
She has done everything she could to ruin
me in my business, and it is only fair to
me that the true facts should be known."
Judge Groezinger in dismissing the case
said it was an outrage that a warrant
should have been issued for Hughes' ar
rest.
A FAKE PRIEST.
The Police Searching for a Man Who
Obtained a Check From Father
Collins of Santa Clara.
The police are searching for a false
priest, and as they have a good descrip
tion of him the probability is that he will
be behind the bars soon.
Last week a man who represented him
self as Father Vignon, an ordained priest,
called upon Rev. Father Collins of Santa
Clara College and said he was raising funds
for a Catholic charity. He talked so earn
estly and plausibly that Father Collins
agreed to give him a check for $100 on the
Donohoe-Kelly Bank in this City.
After Vignon's departure with the check
Father Collins learned that his representa
tions were false, and yesterday morning
he came to the City and called at the bank
to stop payment of the check. As he en
tered the" bank Vignon was standing at
the counter getting the check cashed.
Father Collins attempted to hold Vignon,
but after a brief scuffle Vignon broke away
from him and made his escape.
Father Collins notified Captain Lees,
and from the description given of Vignon
the Captain thinks be is J. F.. Malo, who
victimized several people four years ago
by telling them he was a Catholic priest
and had been laboring among the Indians.
He was arrested on April 17, 1892, but es
caped conviction through a lack of prose
cution.
OLSOM'S FIERY PASSION
He Now Says That the Object of
His Affection Promises
to Be Kind.
The Love-Sick Swain Believes He Is
Soon to Become a Faithful
Benedick.
If J. B. R. Olsom, who has sent two or
three maudlin epistles to Coroner Haw
kins concerning his affection for the
vivacious Lilian Bowman of 105 Grove
street, is to be believed, the object of his
fierce passion has consented to '"consider
his suit." It is to be presumed, of course,
from this that the lovesick swain will for
a time at least forego his previously ex
pressed intention of ending a miserable
existence by jumping into the bay. Yes
terday Olsom sent the following letter to
the Coroner:
San Fbanctsco, Cal., May 9, 1896.
W. J. Hawkins, M. Dâ Deak Sir: 1 did not
jump in the bay, as was imy Intention, but
strayed around in the neighborhood of my
love, hoping I might see her once before my
life and love should pass away in the dark
waters of the bay. And I am thankful for it,
for just as I was about to give up all hope of
seeing my fair love I was rewarded by seeing
her come home, and to my great surpri.se
waited at the door as if expecting some one,
and as it was my last chance I thought I
would make the best of it by speaking to her
in person and telling her my lire would be a
blank if my love was not returned. And this
is what she said : "Well, hit, you are a stranger
to me, and 1 do not know of ever seeing you
before, and if you are the young man that
wrote me those love letters I am very sorry fcr
you and I pity you from the bottom of my
heart, and would be glad to know if I could
help you in any way but the one you ask, and
that is being your wife. I will not say there is
no hope, but you must prove to me you are a
gentleman And that your intentions are hon
orable and sincere* in all respects before
I would consent to what you ask. You
must not suppose I am one of those girls
you meet every day on Market street, as I am
not, but as you have written to me aiking me
to kindly consider your suit I will promise
you 1 will, ii you are what a gentleman ought
to be, and not one of those who do nothing
but walk Market street trying to peep in every
girl's face that you take a fancy to. Now you
may go and rest assured I will consider your
request and look up your past, and if you are
what you represent yourself to be I will write
to you and let you know how you are re
garded."
Oh, this is Joyful news to write instead of
saying I am going to arown myself, and I
am very glad I thought of speaking to her
in person, so you need not loo* for my body
in the bay.
As I am well and strong in life and only hope
to prove to my love I am not one of those
who break giris' hearts for fun, but one who
is ambitious and loves his love dearly.
True Love.
TRUE lOVE.
There Is true love, and yet you may have lingering
doubts about It.
I'll tell the truth, and simply say that life Is a
blank without it.
There is a love, both true and strongâ
A love that falters never;
It lives In faith and suffers wrong,
But lives and lives forever.
Snch love Is found but once on earth;
The heart canno*. repel it.
But whence it comes or why its birth
The tongue can never tell It.
This love is mine, in spite of all
This love 1 fondly cherish.
The earth may sink, the .ikies may fall,
This love will never perish.
It is a love that cannot die,
But, like the Â«oul. Immortal,
And with it cleaves the starry skies
And passes through the portal.
This is the love that comes to stay,
AH other loves are fleeting,
It is but Cupid cheating.
Now this is my love for her, and I am happy
as she will expect. All my love is written in
this verse. So Rood-by, and may lonn live the
day she gave me hope. lam going to see her
Friday afternoon to talk matters over, and I
hope to come away with the date set for our
wed than iroing to a watery grave. 80 good
by. lam happy. Yours respectfully,
P. S.-I thank you, Mr. Hawkins, for your
kind endeavors in looking for my body and
when I get married you will get an invitation.

the Morgue officials trust that he wiilgive
them a short respite from nonsensical
letters.

J. B. Martin's fox-terrier Golden Flash
was offered for sale at the Los Angeles
show for $3o and there was not a purchaser
in sight. Since Judge Mortimer placed
him over the famous fox-terriers Warren
Sage, Â«n imported dog, owned by Martin,
and Dudley Stroller, owned by Dr.
d'Evelyn, the Golden Flash has become
ever so brilliant. Martin now thinks that
$500 would be just about the sum neces
sary if a purchaser really meant business.
Verily, dog shows arc funny things.

Jose.
Colonel Jack Clemishire, the hero of a
sensational horsewhippine affair that took
place at Pleasanton some time ago and
MR. AND MRS. JACK CLEMISHIRE.
who is well known among the young
bloods of San Francisco as a dresser of no
mean ability and a man whose money
flows like water as long as it lasts, is being
sued by his young and pretty wife for
a divorce and will be served with the pa
pers in the action this morning.
Mrs. Clemishire is the daughter of
Colonel Younger of San Jose, and the
wedding at the bride's home was a social
event still remembered by those who at
tended. The young couple lived happily
for some time, but the fondness of the
man of military title for the company of
women other than his wife eventually
brought dissensions into the household,
and for some time past relations have
been strained all around.
Colonel Jack recently came into posses
sion of a considerable sum of money and
immediately started in to have a "good
time" in company with boon companions
and some female friends. His wife learned
of his escapades and, aided by a man hired
for the purpose, tracked him about the
City for forty-eight hours, trying to ascer
tain with whom he spent his time and
money.
On Sunday night she surprised him in
company that left her no further reason to
doubt the information she had received,
and she immediately consulted an attor
ney and swore to a complaint charging her
husband with statutory offenses and ask
ing a divorce with alimony.
The papers in the case were filed in the
County Clerk's office in Oakland yester
day afternoon. George A. Knight has
taken her case and intends to conduct it
to a speedy conclusion.
Mrs. Clemishire is a blonde, with a slen
der figure and winsome blue eyes that
filled with tears as she spoke of the matter
last evening in her apartments at the Cali
fornia Hotel. While keenly appreciating
the scandal which the suit will bring about,
she is determined to separate from a hus
band whom she deems to be no longer
worthy of her love. She refused to give
any particular; of the trouble with him
beyond the fact that she had proved him
guilty to her own satisfaction and had in
stituted divorce proceedings.
EVIL LURKS IN SHADOW
Salfield Advocates Park Lights
Before Summer Even
ings Come.
Says $20,000 a Tear or Less Would
Pay for 150 Lights From
Local Companies.
C. D. Salfield, one of the many residents
in the vicinity of the park who are very
desirous of having it lighted by electricity,
believes that for purposes of morality and
as an accommodation to citizens generally
Golden Gate Park should be lighted be
fore the summer evenings have begun.
In order to avoid delay and that the sys
tem might be tested before the establish
ment later of a City plant for the park, be
thinks the local light companies should
be first patronized.
Discussing the proposition last night, he
said: "As every one knows, the trade
winds subside about 6 o'clock, and our
evenings are the pleasantest part of the
day. Then it is that a great many people
would visit the park were it lighted. But
there is another important consideration.
Electric lights would discourage the pres
ence of a very undesirable element that
now frequents the park in the evenings in
search of dark places. In the large cities
of the East the parks are lighted.
"The City ought to appropriate $20,000
primarily and exclusively for tne lighting
of the park. That would be less than 7 per
cent of the main appropriation. Then
there should be special provision made by
the Board of Supervisors to prevent the
use of the park light fund for any other
purpose.
"For the first two or three years a little
less, perhaps only $10,000 or $15,000,w0u1d
probably be sufficient for all purposes un
til the park shall have been cultivated and
developed more extensively, as at present
there is very little cultivation beyond the
boathouse. At the present local rate $20,
-000 would furnish the park with 150 lights
for a year.
"I believe the local light companies
should supply the light first so that we
may get the improvements at once. Later,
if it be found expedient to establish an
electric-light plant in the park all right.
"The public subscription scheme for
lighting the park is not feasible. It might
possibly wort for a month or two months,
but after that it would be found that sub
scribers would drop off."
A Still Alarm.
A still alarm was turned in at 2:30 o'clock
yesterday for a fire on the third and fourth
floor of the Insurance block, corner of Battery
and California streets. Loss $3500. The
offices destroyed were the Pacific Insurance
Union and the Wilhelmina Insurance Com
pany.

"An Evening with American Authors and
Composers," on the eve of Decoration day.
OFFER A FRENCH LIBRARY
A Proposition Is on Foot to
Donate One to This
City.
There Are Seventeen Thousand Valu
able Volumes Ready to Be
Turned Over.
The annual meeting and election of La
Ligue Nationaile Francaise was held last
evening in the rooms of the French Li
brary, Daniel Levy presiding and A.
Freling officiating as secretary.
President Levy read his annual address,
recounting the purposes of the organiza
tion, which was formed in 1872 with a view
of enlisting French patriots to succor
France in the event of future troubles of a
warlike nature.
In a pathetic way, made more so by the
tearful emotion he displayed during the
recital, he told of the trials and hardships,
the suffering and death entailed by the
Fran co- Prussian War. He told how the
members of the French colony here who
were not in a position to rally under the
tricolor of their home to do battle had
either donated funds to the cause or, in
lieu of that, had sacrificed mercantile be
longings to assist financially with their
mite.
The fund now amounts to over $25,000
which will eventually be turned over to
the French Government as the donation
of its sons in this distant land.
Georges de Latour. one of the members
brought up the subject of the location of
the French library, declaring that it was
not centrally located and that this fact
had caused a great falling off of member
ship. During the discussion E. Marque
editor of Le Petit Callfornien, men
tioned the fact that ten years ago a propo
sition was made to the iigue to annex the
library to that of the Free Library of this
City and that it would be known as the
"French annex."
The editor stated that in view of the fact
that the library, which it only an auxiliary
of the Ligue Nationale Francaise, was
running behind financially and was a bur
den, it would be well to* see if the City
Fathers were still in the same frame of
mind regarding amalgamation.
There are over 17,000 French books in
the library and their value amounts to
nearly $12,000. If the City will accept the
books as a present from the ligue, the
only condition will be that a separate
French library-room be set aside and the
name Biblioteque Francaise be placed over
the door.
The library committee was instructed to
canvass the matter.
There was but one ticket in the field, re
sulting in the following officers being
elected for the ensuing year:
President, Daniel Levy; vice-presidents,
E. Raas and A. Goustiaux; treasurer,
Emile Meyer; secretaries. E. Godchaux
and J. Ladagnous; executive committee â
V. Gardet, F. Lacoste, A. Frellng, E.
Marque and I. (Juenin.

Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria-
PACIFIC-UNION
"MODERNS" WIN
President to Be Elected by
Direct Vote of the
Members.
CONSTITUTION CHANGED
Board of Eight Directors, Instead
of Fifteen, to Be Chosen
Annually.
FIRST ELECTION MAY 26.
The Progressive Element Will Sop
port a President Favoring Club-
House Ownership.
An important meeting of the Pacific-
Union Club was held last evening to con
sider proposed changes in the constitution
of the organization. The meeting was
called to order at 8 o'clock by the presi
dent, Joseph B. Crockett. Seventy or
more members participated in the pro
ceedings.
The old constitution was radically
changed. The system of dividing the
the board into classes was abolished. The
number of directors was reduced from fif
teen to eight.
The sections of the constitution which
provided that the directors should elect a
president, vice-president and secretary
were abolished entirely, and hereafter
these officers will be chosen directly from
the body of the club by a direct vote of the
members.
These three officers and five directors
will constituts a board of eight directors.
The club, according to the terms of the
amended or new constitution, will elect
the board annually. The first election un
der the new order of things will take place
May 26.
Twice this year the Pacific Union Club
has tried to secure a new board of direc
tors under the eld constitution, but no
choice resulted in either election. The old
constitution required that fifty members
should constitute a quorum, and that no
director could be chosen unless he received
a majority of all the members present.
Of nine names on the ticket voted for
several weeks ago George A. New hall was
the only one that received a constitutional
majority and eight vacancies remained.
At a subsequent election there was another
failure to secure the requisite number of
votes.
It was then resolved to abolish the sys
tem and permit a majority of the mem
bers voting to elect the officers.
The club last night did not reduce the
initiation charge or the annual dues. No
steps were taken toward erecting a club
house.
It is quite probable that there will be
two tickets in t c field at the election on
May 26. A fine opportunity will be pre
sented for the members of the club to ex
press their sentiments on the subject of a
permanent club home, owned by the insti
tution.
Trie younger or the so-called progressive
element is said to be in favor of clubhouse
ownership.
Argument is advanced that the great
clubs of London, New York, Chicago and*
Boston do not occupy rented buildings,
and snrely the leading club of San Fran
cisco in point of wealth and commercial
influence should not Jag behind similar
institutions in other cities.
The conservative element, which com
prises the easy-going capitalists of leisure
and fixed habits of repose, is said to op
pose any innovations.
To ascertain the real sentiment of the
club the advocates of progress will surely
put up a ticket for a new departure and
work with a deal of vim and vigor to cain
success at the first election under the new
constitution.
The Pacific-Union Club promises to be a
lively institution from this time until May
26.
DAMAGES FOR A LIFE
The Widow and Family of
John Keyer Bring
Suit
They Say His Death in the Baden
Accident Was Dae to Negli
gence.
The story of the great wreck at Baden
which occurred in the midst of the
January storm will be told again in court.
The widow and children of the engineer
who lay crushed under his engine were
left destitute and they are suing to com
pel the railroad to provide for them in
place of the engineer of the ill-fated en
gine.
John Keyer, the engineer, was the only
man killed. He left San Francisco at 5:30
January 26 and proceeded at usual speed
as far as Baden. It was during the big
storm and culverts and ditches' were
running full. In many places the water
was running over the track and had cut
out under the ties until the trade was*
al most afloat.
The engineer had no previous knowl
edge of the condition of the track. It was
presumed that the track-walker had been
over the section, and anyway there were
no orders to Keyer as he backed his en
gine up to the train ready to pull out.
In the meantime, down the line toward
Baden it had been discovered that at one
of the culverts the track was being slowly
but surely undermined'by the rapid cur
rent passing across it. The m<Â»n in charge
of the station at Baden were warned about
it, and were reminded that the 5:30 train
from the City was nearly due.
Nothing was said or "done, however, for
some little time, and then a man was sent
up the track with a red lantern to stop if
possible any accident. But the train had
come too far and before the man and his
lantern had reached the treacherous cross
ing the engine had found the weak spot
for itself, and John Keyer, pinned down
by the engine he would not desert, lay
drowning in the muddy waters running
under the culvert.
The conductor and brakeman of the
train drew him out as soon as possible and
tried to resuscitate him, but with the in
juries he had received and the water he
had drawn into his lungs the aid was use
less, and he died as them in with the red
lantern came upon the scene.
riis widow and family are suing for
$50,000 damages for his death. The com
plaint was hied by Delmas <fc Shortridge
yesterday. It charges that Keyer's death
was due to the negligence of the company
in not having its track properly cared for
and its men warned of the danger.
