MADE A RAPID SORTIE.
Fierce and Deadly Fighting
Along the Banks of the

MANY OF THE SAVAGES SLAIN
Heroic Acts of the Brave Defenders
in Which Sacrifices Were Made
to Save Companions.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, April 24.-
A dispatch from Buluwayo dated April
23 says that Commander Duncan with 200
whites and 100 natives with Maxim and
Hotchkiss guns met the Matabeles three
miles out from Buluwayo.
The details of the fighting show that
the defenders of Buluwayo decided to
make a sortie from that town and engage
the natives who' were besieging it. The
Britisn party met with no resistance until
they reached the Umguza River where
they came upon the enemy. The. force
from Buluwayo occupied the south bank
of the river for a distance of a mile, while
the Matabeles were stretched along the
north bank for four miles. ??.Â«';â 
Selous, with 100 natives, was stationed
in the center, the Afrikanders formed the
left wing and Guy's scouts the right wing.
The British force crossed the river and
rushed upon the Matabeles, who were out
flanked and driven into the water. The
enemy swarmed up and attempted to get
in the rear of the British, obliging the
Afrikanders to gallop back to intercept
them.
Guy's scouts fell into an ambush and
had to make a rush to extricate themselves
from" the Matabeles, who were pouring a
hot fire into them.
There were many instances of personal
heroism. Trooper Baxter, seeing Corporal
Wise severely wounded and bis horse shot
from under him, jumped from his own
horse and helped Wise, to mount him, thus
enabling the corporal to escape. Baxter
gave his life for his friend, for shortly after
Wise's escape he was killed- by a stroke
from an assegai, hurled ' from t one of j the
ambushed foe. Guy had a harrow . escape,
a bullet grazing his scalp.
Lieutenant ' Hood was severely and
Lieutenant Crewe slightly wounded. The
latter insisted that Hood should take his
horse, and Hood, after some demur,
did so and effected his escape. Crewe also
got away without further injury, but had
great difficulty in escaping Baxter's fate.
The Hotchkiss and Maxim guns became
jammed early in the tight. They were
only tired twice. Had it not been for this
the loss of the Matabeles would have been
far heavier than it was. The horse that
Belous was riding was killed â in mid
stream and the rider barely escaped with
his life. All the troops were cool and
plucky. They drove the enemy up the
river, inflicting heavy loss upon them.
The exact number of the killed and
wounded Matabeles is not known.
The Matabeles were in full retreat and
were being closely pursued by the British
and their native allies when the order
was given for the latter to fall back to
Buluwayo, it being feared that a much
stronger force would be met with.
The Government has cautioned the offi
cers to act on the defensive only until re
enforcements shall have arrived. It is
thought here that the sortie will prevent
the natives from attempting to attack the
town, which it was their evident intention
to do. There is no truth in the report that
the British were defeated. The only basis
for it was a statement in the first dis
patches that the British had been driven
into the river. Later details make no
mention of this, and it is thought that the
statement was a mistaken one, for the
British j crossed the river to reach the
enemy at close quarters.
It is reported that a large number of
Boer wagons, conveying ammunition and
other field requisites, are leaving Pretoria,
the capital of the Transvaal. Their desti
nation is unknown.
. Earl Grey, the newly appointed admin
istrator of the British South Africa Com
pany, wbo is at Palla on -his way to Pa
lapy, has sent a dispatch to the company
stating that he has very good reasons to
believe that. the defenders of Buluwayo
will be able to hold the position until the
arrival of re-enforcements.

SOLD JEWELRY TO HIMSELF.
Daring Frauds of an Agent That Cause
the Failure of a New York
Dealer.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 24.-The
police are looking for Charies Querin, who
was an agent of the Eagle Jewelry Com
pany, of which Frank Pollatchek was the
proprietor. Mr. Pollatchek, who made an
assignment for the benefit of this creditors
last Wednesday, says that his financial
collapse followed the discovery that Quer
in had by means of bogus checks defrauded
him in the last few months of $17,000.
Querin has not been seen " since last
Monday.
â¢Pollatchek said last evening that he had
employed Querin several months ago, and
had given to him large quantities of dia
mond jewelry on memorandum.' The new
agent made surprisingly quick sales, and
every week gave his employer a check for
the amount he was supposed to have col
lected. Querin's check was. returned
stamped "no funds" last week, and then
he disappeared. , * ;^ â¢*Â£â 
Then Pollatchek began an investigation.
He went in search of some of the persons
to whom he supposed Querin had sold
goods, and was surprised to find that no
such persons had ever lived at the ad
dresses given. Then it was, according to
the story of Mr. Pollatchek, that the man
ner of the operations of the agent were
disclosed to him. '; [','.{'. '. -* \
For months Querin had been industri
ously selling- jewelry to himself, making
out forged bills of sale and keeping up the
small weekly payments. Pollatchek found
that the agent had disposed of $22,000
worth of jewelry to himself, paying $7000.
When he finally took his departure he had
about $14,000 worth and also about $3000
worth more on memorandum, of which he
had made no returns whatever. It was
the discovery of these alleged peculations
which forced Pollatchek to, make an
assignment. -He expects shortly to re
sume business.

Downsville, nine miles south of this city.
They were last seen on Tuesday evening.
Their bodies were found yesterday. A

As to th* Gold Clause.
OMAHA, Nebr.. April 24. â Judge
Keyser of the District Court has. given out
a statement that the report sent out in
press dispatches that he had decided that
the gold clause in a mortgage cannot be
enforced. It appears he only refused to
decree payment in gold because the mort
gage in question gave the debtor the
option of paying in gold or its j equivalent,
and the testimony showed other forms of
money to be of equal value with gold at
this time. It-is to be inferred from the
Judge's statement that he would enforce a
gold clause.

DENUNCIATION OF THE SENATE
Paraders, Headed by Socialist Depu

LONDON, Eng., April 24.â The Morning
Post's Paris correspondent hints at the be
ginning of a revolutionary era.
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
News telegraphs that the crisis is the most
acute of any that has prevailed since 1877.
He adds that a curious factor is the im
pending arrival of Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria from St. Petersburg. .
; The Bourgeois Cabinet had already pro
vided for his official reception, and now
there is some anxiety for French prestige
if there should be no Government to re
ceive Russia's protege. Hence there is a
great desire to. form a Cabinet rapidly.
â¢ President Faure has suggested that MM.
Bourgeois and Sarien try to form a co
alition Ministry. MM. Petral and Poin
care, whom the President consulted, have
refused to attempt to construct a Cabinet.
Rumors and conjectures abound. States
men who were piesentat the last Cabinet
council expressed the opinion in conversa
tion with the correspondent of "the Daily
News that the crisis ; would not be ended
until the National Assembly should meet.
* PARIS, France, April 24.â A monster
meeting was held * to-night at Tivoli Hall
under socialist auspices to denounce the
action of the senate which resulted in the
overthrow of the Bourgeois Ministry.
Thousands of people were unable to gain
admission to the hall. MM. , Pelletan,
Jaures and Vaillani, socialist members of
the Chamber of Deputies, spoke. * Those
present became greatly excited and there
was much disorder, which continued after
the meeting was closed. The crowd, which
was I frenzied, shouted, s, "Down with the
Senate!" 'and attempted to make a rush
for the boulevards. In this, however, they
were generally prevented by. the police,
who arrested a number of the more dem
onstrative. A. A - A, â -â â ':â : *

HAVANA, Cuba. April Official ad
vices received here state that Colonel Al
dea, while in pursuit of parties of rebels,
encountered several bands of them on the
Carmen '[ estate, .near ; Sabanilla, \ in the
province of ': Matanzas. , ; The insurgents
were fleeing â¢ from an attack which had
been made upon them by the Rey column.
The troops charged upon the rebel on all
sides, forcing them to take refuge in the'
cane fields, which were burning : fiercely,
and many of them perished in the flames
which they themselves had started.
, The troops continued in pursuit of. the
fleeing rebels, j killing Â many .of , them.
Twenty- three dead Â insurgents were left
behind, and it is believed , more than that
number perished in the cane fields. Others
than Government authorities assert that
the affair was similar to many others
which have occurred wherein unarmed
men were killed. The official report say
the troops had one '.man killed and one
wounded. , '...-'"â¢> Ay,. â Â-..-â¢ -... â >
' Colonel Francis reports that the rebels
fired upon the rear guard of his line near
Mariel, but retreated as soon as the troops
returned the fire. Captain Medina^Lajas.
with a force of guerillas, together with the
forces of. Vizcaya, dislodged the enemy
from the estate of Estrella, near Cienfue
gos, of which the Spanish took possession.
The rebels lost twelve killed and the troops
lost one wounded. "
; Julio Sanguilly, the: American . citizen
who was acquitted yesterday'of the charge
of kidnaping, a Spaniard named De Castro,
is still held in prison here pending the de
cision of the. Supreme Court in Madrid
upon his conviction and sentence last De
cember, to life imprisonment in the mines
of Ceiita; Africa, for the crime of rebellion.
\ general Weyler is satisfied that nothing
in' the line of intervention or recognition
of belligerency may be, looked for from
Washington, at least for the present, and
the public executions ;of prisoners of war
which were suspended for a time have been
resumed. There is supposed to be a gen
eral understanding among commanders of
Spanish" columns that . no . prisoners are to
be taken in engagements in the field.-,
; - All , Cuban -patriots who fall into" the
hands v.' of , the ; v troops " through A being
wounded, or some other reason, are liable
to be shot at once t and ; counted \ with the
number killed .in battle. - Some of the
Spanish commanders act according to this
understanding, but others decline to slay
unarmed and* : wounded men and' deliver
their prisoners to General ? Weyler in
Havana. ? Many iof these so-called * pris
oners of war never, carried a gun or en
gaged in battle, but , were taken from plan
tations or, small towns or hamlets in the
interior where the Spaniards > assume that
all men are rebels, and*; are not far from
being right. The prisoners are brought to
Havana,* bound and strongly guarded to
prevent rescue before reaching the city
and mob violence afterward..
; The lower class of Spaniards gather
about each batch of prisoners and clamor
for their blood as they pass through the
streets to the ferry to Cabanas Fortress or
Moro Castle. The court-martial before
which the prisoners are tried is a perfunc
tory affair composed of five military men,
who order the death penalty under Wey
ler's decree that all insurgents are bandits
and incendiaries and deserving of death.
The prisoners have no opportunity to
make a defense, and all Cubans in the
rebel armies know that capture means
death.
Most of those brought in, it seems, have
been wounded, cut off from their columns
or caught without arms. 'Fhen con
demned to death they are given' twenty
four or forty-eight hours to .prepare for
the end. They are given what they want
to eat, and are placed in the chapel at
Cabanas Fortress with priests in constant
attendance for the last twelve hours.
Most of the Cuban patriots who have
paid the extreme penalty since Weyler has
teen here have died bravely. I saw three
of them meet their fate last Friday morn
ing. They were Jose Bascallao and Estiva
Hernandez (white) and Gregorio Borges
(colored). During the . night before the
execution Bascallao made several feigned
attempts to escape from the chapel, hoping
that the guards would shoot him down,
preferring that to public execution; The
guards forced him back each time without
firing at him.
I crossed the bay a few moments after 6
o'clock on the morning set for the execu
tion. It took place promptly at 7. The
three men, escorted by a file of soldiers
and supported by an order of lay brethren
of the Catholic church, were taken from
the chapel to a space between the outer
and the inner walls and at the eastern
end of the fortress, where a battalion of
Spanish regulars formed three sides of a
square. .
The fourth side was the main wall of
the fortress. In front of that the prison
ers' arms were tied behind their backs and
they were led out. Just outside the square
a hundred people had gathered to witness
the execution of the rebels, most of them
Spaniards. On the walls' of the fortress
200 or 300 soldiers were grouped where a
good view could be obtained. I heard no
expression of pity from the spectators for
the men who knelt with the priests and
prepared for the . end. A young , lieuten
ant of the guard, who was ordered out to
do the shooting, however, assea to be ex
cused. He was a Cuban, serving in the
Spanish army. Another officer took his
place. The men knelt facing the wall and
with their backs toward the firing squad.
They showed no signs of flinching. A file
of soldiers, twelve in number, was drawn
up about ten paces away. Four men were
ordered to aim at each prisoner. There
was an interval of â¢ silence when all was
ready. The officers; raised their swords,
there was a s rattle .of musketry and the
men fell forward on their faces. ,
? Hernandez and - Bascallao showed signs
of life. A sergeant with his revolver gave
Hernandez an extra shot, the j tiro de
gracia, as it is called. He was obliged to
fire twice at Bascallao j before it . was over.
The lay brothers carried the, bodies to
Havana and buried them in pauper burial
grounds. ;,. â¢ y .. . . J. Frank Clark. â¢

ASTORIA, Or., April 24.â Lieutenant
Straub of the Fifth " Artillery, United
States army, took possession of Sand
Island yesterday with a detail of eighteen
men, and drove the Washington militia,
which has been in possession for the past
ten days guarding fish traps, off the
island. The militiamen are accused of in
timidating fishermen, and protecting
Washington State trapraen who placed
traps in the open channel of the Columbia
River, contrary to the directions of the
United States engineers, at the same time
occupying the Sand Island Government
reserve, within the original State line of
Oregon off the island. The Oregon au
thorities were very conservative, simply
directing T the attention of the Federal
Government to the acts of the Washing
ton militia under the open direction of
Governor McGraw.
United States engineers made a hasty re
survey of Sand Island to be sure it con
formed to the old lines. The post com
mandant at Fort " Canby was directed to
clear Sand Island of Washington militia,
take possession, permit no one to approach'
the island nearer than low-water mark.
The officer, to be polite, delivered to the
militia officer in charge orders to evacuate.
The militia officer refused until he had
consulted his superiors. When the com
mandant of the post had this reported to
him he sent officers back with an order for
the militia to prepare to leave within
twenty minrtes, or they would be thrown
off. ' This hurried the militia and in a lew
hours they .were back to the Washington I
shore. Lieutenant Straub, with a detail,
took possession and is now in charge.
It Is reported on good authority, but not
officially substantiated, that orders have
been given to have all traps along Sand
Island removed.
BAKERSFIELD STRIFE.
Repeated Arrest of a Liquor-Dealer at the
Instance of the Law and Order
Society.
â  BAKERSFIELD, Cal., April 24.â For
some time a determined warfare has been
waged r here against dives by an organiza
tion of citizens. For a short time last year
all the disorderly places were closed, owing
to the efforts of this organization, and no
torious "Big Bertha," who kept the most
disreputable house, was driven from town.
Several months ago, however, two places
were opened. Last week, after a hard'
.fight, ; the Supervisors revoked their
licenses and both were closed. One is said
to belong to San Francisco breweries and
is run by one Holmes. After being closed
for one night he reopened the place. He
was arrested, v but persisted in keeping
open. Last night : two attachments were
filed for debts due here and the place was
closed. * â¢-*: v';;':>'
San Francisco breweries are represented
here by R. G. Morrison, and he conducts a
place where bottled beer is sold. The lead
ers of the Law and Order Society ascer
tained on Tuesday that he had no license,
and accordingly on Wednesday Rev. J. W.
Phillips, a Congregational minister and a
leader in the purity movement, swore out
a warrant and had Morrison arrested i a. He
gave bonds but , refused to get a license.
On Thursday he was , rearrested, gave
bonds and continued to defy the law. To
day another warrant was sworn out. This
will be kept up , every day until he either
shuts up his place or takes out | a license.'
He claims that the breweries directed him
not to take out a license, and : threatens to
retaliate by having the Law and Order So
ciety leaders arrested tor malicious prose
cution.' *7".? l "; ;H"

Between Germany and
Japan.

Attempt to Connect Subjects of
the Mikado With the Death
of Korea's Queen.
ABOUT FORTY SLAIN SO FAR.
Alarm Caused by the Importation of
the Terrible Plague From
Hongkong.
TOKIO, Japan, April 10.â Very mislead
ing telegrams have been published with
reference to the revised treaty between
Japan and Germany, which was signed on
the 4th of April in Berlin. The public has
been led to believe that the treaty's pro
visions for the abolition of consular juris
diction differ essentially from those em
bodied in the Anglo-Japanese treaty of
July, 1894, and that important reserva
tions are made in favor of German sub
jects, and therefore of foreigners in gen
eral. That is altogether a misconception.
The treaty is on precisely the same lines
as the Anglo-Japanese. It is accompa-
nied, however, by a consular convention,
such as that existing between Germany
and Russia, and Germany and Italy,
which defines the privileges and immuni
ties enjoyed by Consuls, and the notarial
or magisterial functions that they are em
powered to discharge in the case of their
own nationals under certain circum
stances.
The procedure authorized by this con
vention is strictly reciprocal and differs in
no respect from that followed by Consul s
in Europe, but since it is not England's
habit to conclude such conventions, and
since consequently no convention of the
kind accompanies the Anglo-Japanese
treaty ignorant critics have been misled.
The long delay that occurred in conclud
ing the new treaty with Germany was
wholly because of the tatter's large de
mands for extended tariff concessions.
The Berlin statesmen sought to obtain
special treatment for some 300 articles.
Japan declined altogether to negotiate on
such a basis, and after much discussion
Germany withdrew the great b ulk of her
demands. She has succeeded, however,
in getting slightly improved terms for im
ports representing about 5,000,000 yen out
of a total trade of 129,000,000, but of these
5,000,000 yen 2,500,000 represent staples
sold by England to Japan and only 1,500,
--000 staples sold by Germany.
By direction of the King of Korea, a
court has been held under the presidency
of the Vice-Minister of Justice, for the
purpose of investigating the circumstances
attending the Queen's death. The report
compiled by the court shows that its main
purpose was to incriminate the Japanese
and extenuate the part played by the
Koreans themselves. It will, of course,
tend to render the Japanese still more un
popular in the peninsulaâ a result doubt
less desired by the statesmen now in power
in Seoul.
It would seem that the Korean authori
ties were privy to an attempt recently
made against the life of the prince-parent.
A man armed with a dagger was caught
just outssde of the old Prince's bed-cham
ber on the night of the 19th of March. He
was seized, tied up and questioned, but
the police, to whom no intelligence had
been conveyed, suddenly appeared upon
the scene and carried him away, thus
proving that they had previous cognizance
of his doing.
Up to March 28 the number of Japanese
subjects murdered or badly injured by the
Korean insurgents was forty, in addition
to seventeen soldiers killed. Great fears
had been entertained on account of eighty
Japanese merchants residing in Phyeong
yang, but they reached Ninsen safely on
the 28th of March under secret escort of a
small body of police. It appears from
their account that they were never in any
visible danger, and that, had they not
Bold off their stock in trade in the begin
ning of the insurrection, they might have
found it convenient to remain. Negotia
tions with reference to the outrages
against Japanese life and property are
going on between the Governments in
Seoul and in Tokio.
The strength of the insurgents in Korea
is broken by dissensions among them
selves. On the 22d of March their strong
hold at Kwang-fu, not far from Seoul, was
attacked by the King's soldiers and taken
without much difficulty, the rebels leaving
more than a hundred dead upon the field
and a score of prisoners.* This success
dispels any fear of a movement against
the capital. It is said- that provisions
sufficient for a. year's use were found
stored in Kwang-fu.
The block in the Japanese silk market
continues. Foreign buyers expect that if
the European crop be up to the average
the Japanese will have to sell at prices
even lower than those now ruling. The
native silk merchants of Yokohama have
applied to the treasury for a loan of
4,000,000 yen without interest, which they
propose to pay back in six years. Their
idea is to devote 1,000,000 yen to pur
chasing 10,000 bales of silk at 100 yen above
the present price, this silk to be held until
an opportunity offers for selling at a profit.
Meanwhile the remaining 3,000,000 yen is
to be banked and its interest applied to
repaying the loan. : There is not ? the
smallest probability that the treasury will
entertain this modest proposal.
Alarm has been caused in Japan by the
importation of the terrible plague from
Hongkong. Among 600 Chinese that took
passage in the Oriental and \ Occidental
Steamship Company's Gaelic, ' which
reached Yokohama homeward bound, on
March 29, was a lad of 17, who, when three
days out from Hongkong, had fallen sick.
He determined to land at Yokohama, and
succeeded in doing so without attracting
attention, being still able to walk.' That
evening be found his way to the Chinese
hospital, where; he died at 2 a. m. on April
1, and was interred the same day. The
bubonic swellings, characteristic of the
disease, had developed in his, neck and
choked him at an early stage.
Before death he had been seen by a
Japanese physician, who, suspecting ; the
nature of the malady, telegraphed to the
Tokio experts. One of the latter proceeded
to Yokohama, had the body disinterred,
and on examining tbe ? swelling in the
neck fouhd it swarming with the plague
bacillus, which Dr. Kitazoto discovered in
Hongkong two years ago.
Every precaution dictated by medical
science was at once taken to prevent the
spread of the disease, but it was felt that,
as the Chinese physicians had failed to
diagnose the "malady before death, and as
consequently a considerable interval had
elapsed before vigorous prophylactic meas
ures could be adopted, a great danger was
imminent.
Two days ' later â April another
steamer, the Chittagong from Hongkong,
reported a suspicious case upon arrival,
but in this instance the bacillus was ab
sent and the man soon began to mend.
Most unfortunately, however, the Gaelic
having sailed for San Francisco via Hono
lulu on March 31â that is to say, before
anything was known about , the plague
stricken lad in the Chinese hospital no
measures to disinfect her had been taken,
and as the crowd in her steerage had been
increased by 500 Japanese emigrants for
Hawaii, great anxiety was felt for the
safety of all on board. Telegrams were at
once dispatched to Washington and San
Francisco to warn the sanitary authorities
there. In Japan the system of medical in
spection and disinfection resorted to in
cholera epidemics has been put into force
with respect to all vessels coming from
Hongkong or any port on the Chinese
coast. It should be noted, however, that
the plague has not yet developed serious
dimensions in Hongkong. The daily aver
age of patients is only six or seven, but
there is a tendency to increase.
Mutinies among Chinese troops are so
frequent that the outside world has ceased
to think much of them. A rather serious
case occurred in one of the celebrated Taku
forts, on the Peiho River. It commenced
on March 17 and went on for three days.
The authorities say that it had its origin
in a gambling affray, but probably the old
cause official squeezingâ was chiefly re
sponsible. The mutineers, using swords,
killed five officers on the first day. Had
they possessed rifles they would probably
have done much greater mischief, but tbey
had been deprived of their rifles and were
awaiting transports to carry them south
for disbandment. The general command
ing a neighboring fort marched up his
men and cave the mutineers a volley that
killed three of their number. Two compa
nies of the Viceroy's body-guards, arriving
subsequently from Tientsin with machine
guns, settled the business. The mutinous
garrison were driven on board a transport,
twenty lives having been sacrificed in all.
LINE OFFICERS ACTIVE.
Desire to Prevent Congress From
Giving Actual Rank to the
Engineer Corps.
Secretary Herbert and the Cabinet
Will Take a Hand in the Con
troversy.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 24.-As a
result of the affray yesterday between
Congressmen Hall and Money, Secretary
Herbert will take some action with regard
to the bitter feud between the line and the
staff of the navy, which was the primary
cause of the conflict in the Naval Affairs
Committee room.
The bitterness of the two factions has
been increasing until it is now at fever
heat, and the more conservative men who
take an interest in the matter believe that
the personnel of the service is being in
jured, and that vigorous action is neces
sary on the part of the Secretary to bring
about better relations between naval offi
cers.
The bills before Congress giving actual
rank to the members of the Engineer
Corps form the basis for the present ten
sity of feeling. Lobbying has been freely
indulged in for and against the measure,
and social and political influence has been
brought to bear on every member of Con
gress. The line officers are determined
that the staff shall not secure actual rank,
and have formed an association for the
purpose of fighting the measures propos
ing such an arrangement. *â  '
Commodores Phythian and Matthews,
who 'were in the Naval Committee room
when Hall and Money had their battle of
inkstands and sponge-cups, are prominent
members of the Line Association.
The Cabinet, it is understood, discussed
the matter at its meeting to-day, and ac
tion may be looked for by the Navy De
partment. It is not unlikely that charges
will be preferred if the matter goes much
further. Some time ago the subject was
given consideration with a view to stop
ping the growing enmity between the two
branches of the service, but no definite
action was taken, r Cr',-, * :

WITH CARLISLE.

the New Yorker by the
Secretary.
THAT BID FOR BONDS.
Refutation of the Claim That
Notice of Acceptance Was
Not Received.
THE DEArLY PARALLEL DRAWN
Statements in an Exhibit Not Found
in the Original Correspond
ence.
WASHINGTON, D. C, .April 24.-In
the suit brought by William Graves in the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia
against the Secretary of the Treasury, in
which he claims that he was, through the
unlawful and hostile action of the Treas
ury Department officials, prevented from
securing $4,500,000 of the recent issue of 4
per cent bonds, Mr. Carlisle to-day filed an
affidavit showing his side of the case.
The affidavit charges Graves with with
holding from the court a lull recital of the
facts, and with attempting to create wrong
impressions by false recitals and. by gar
bling correspondence.
The main ground of the Graves com
plaint is that he did not promptly receive
notice of the acceptance of his bid, be
cause it was simply directed to him at
New York, and by reason of that refusal
of the Secretary to extend the time for de
positing the first installment of gold he
was wrongfully deprived of the benefits of
his contract.
Mr. Carlisle states that Graves' bid
gave no other address than "New York"
that while in the body of the bid he
named two places for delivery of bonds he
gave no special address; that the accept
ance was mailed in Washington on Febru
ary 9, with the address given at the head
ol bis proposal, and that this was received
at the New York postoffice on February
10; that publications were made in the
New York papers and papers generally
throughout the country on February 9
showing the successful bidders; that Mr.
Graves knew on February 10 that he was
a successful bidder and sent a telegram
to the department on that day showing
this fact; that a duplicate of the notice of
acceptance was sent as soon as he wired
his special address and was received by
him February 11, which was four days be
fore he was required to make any pay
ment; that on February 13 Mr. Graves
made an application for an extension of
time on the ground that the first notice
was misdirected, causing a loss of two
days, but stated distinctly in such appli
cation that, notwithstanding the delay,' he
was prepared to make his deposit on Feb
ruary 15.
Mr. Carlisle's affidavit further recites
that Graves, after he failed to get an , ex
tension of the time for payment, or to get
the bonds sent to New York before pay
ment, made a second bid on February 15
of 113>_ for all bonds that the Secretary
might consider in default on that date, in
cluding those awarded him on his first
bid. No reference to this new bid is made
in his petition. It is further charged that
Graves filed as an exhibit to his petition
what purports to be a copy of a letter writ
ten by him February 15 to the Secretary,
but which contains statements which were
not in the original letter and omits state
ments which were.
The letter exhibited with the petition
and what purports to be the original letter
are printed side by side. The copy of
the original letter given in the affidavit
contains the following:
"I inclose to Mr. Nailer the sealed letter
from you that you may see it. Because of
this delay, caused by a clerical error, I
could not get my gold from the Bank of
California, to whom I referred you, until I
produced the letter of acceptance from
you; then bonds went down, and I could
not collateral them at the price, and I was
on the market as a borrower."
"Again: "Do not allow me to lose my
good name because of my failure to meet
conditions over which 1 had no control,
viz., the drop in values after your notice
came to hand, but on the other hand, give
me what you are in a position to do in jus
tice. Allow and believe me."
Neither of these passages appear in the
letter as it appears in exhibit J of the pe
tition. *i ' ' ;', â¢
In regard to these statements the
affidavit says:
"It appears from the genuine letter that
he could not get the gold in the Bank of
California until he produced a letter of
acceptance-from affiant; that at the time
he could not use them as collateral 1 at the
price he had bid; that he was on the mar
ket as a borrower, and that what pre
vented him from complying with his bid
was 'the drop in value after your (my)
notice came to hand.' " '
The affidavit states that on the 15th of
February Graves was insisting on his sec
ond bid, having abandoned his first bid,
and that the facts in regard to his second
bid were suppressed in his petition.
The affidavit denies the J statements in
the petition that Graves made a tender at
the New York treasury on account of
his allotment and Bays that never at any
time was any tender made by or for him.
All of the charges in the petition^ that
Graves was treated in any wise differently
from other bidders are denied, as is the
statement that bonds were sent to the sub
treat at New York for other persons
before their deposits were made. ' * -"

YET SEEKING THE TRUTH
Experts to Be Sent to The Hague
by the Venezuelan Boundary
Commission.
Counsel Scruggs Points Out In con-
sistencies in the British
Blue Book.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 24.â
Venezuelan boundary commission reas
sembled to-day after a recess of ten days.
Its most important business was a de
cision previously foreshadowed in these
dispatches to send one or more persons to
The Hague to examine the original Dutch
manuscripts relating to Guiana. No se
lection of such agent or agents was made,
however.
An additional mass : of . testimony in
behalf of the Venezuelan claim was filed
with the commission to-day. Mr. Scruggs,
the Venezuelan counsel, also hied a brief
criticizing the blue book. A voluminous
amount of testimony from Caracas was
likewise presented to the commission.
The brief presented by Mr. Scruggs
answers the various contentions of the
British Government as given in the pub
lished blue book, mainly through histori
cal notations, with comments of his own.
He mentions the statement of the blue
book that in 1595 "Dutch settlements were
formed near the mouth of the Orinoco."
"But," says Mr. Scruggs, "it was pre
cisely in 1595 that Sir Walter Raleigh
made his first voyage to the Island of
Trinidad, and thence through Boca de
Navois up the Orinoco to the mouth of
the Caroni. He reported that after first
overcoming the Spanish force at Trinidad,
he ascended the great river as stated,
where he found 'the Spaniards had previ
ously traversed the whole country' ; that
they (the Spaniards) had been 'cruel to
the Indians'; that he bad made lriends of
the Indians and told them he had come to
deliver them from their Spanish con
querors and oppressors.
"And it is gravely asserted in the blue
book that jin 1596 'the Spaniards did not
hold any part of Guiana,' and a care
fully selected (I will not say garbled) ex
tract from a letter from Don Rogue de Mon
tes, the Spanish Colonial Treasurer at
Cumana, is produced to prove this. But
even this carefully selected extract
proves just the contrary. . The writer
says lie had 'instructed Captain
Felipe de Santiago' of the Spanish
service to 'ascend the river Orinoco and
arrest two Englishmen whom Raleigh had
left there as spies and informers,' and 'to
advise the Indian chiefs not to admit or
receive any foreigners except Spaniards' ;
that these instructions were faithfully car
ried out; that the only surviving English
man had been arrested, and that the
Indians were warned against the intrusion
of 'any more foreigners.' *.*.*--.
"If the - Spaniards were ! not then *in
actual possession of the- Lower Orinoco
and in fact of the whole |of Western
Guiana, how were they able to arrest the
only foreigners found there and to warn
the Indians against similar spies and in
formers in the future?" -,

Question from the date of .the English
acquisition of title to British Guiana and

to cure that evil was for the Senate to pass
the appropriation bills just as the House
sent them, leaving to the President the
duty of notifying Congress that additional
appropriations were necessary for the pub
lic service. : ,-:? s; ;5y ??;
There was also some little criticism of the
action of the House in cutting off ] appro
priations for the Providence Hospital, in
Washingtonâ that action being attributed
to religious bigotry and intolerance. The
fact that the First Comptroller refused to
audit the accounts of the Venezuelan-
Guiana commission for office rent was also
commented upon severely.
PENSIONS ARE INCREASED.
Favorable Action Taken on Twelve Pri-
vate Bills.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 22.â Nearly
five hours were given by the House to-day
to a further consideration in committee of
the whole of the general pension bill. The
speakers generally supported the bill, but
all criticized one or the other sections, es
pecially those which authorize the pen
sioning of soldiers wbo previous to their
honorable service in the Union army had
served in the Confederate army or had not
received an honorable discharge. The
speakers were Layton (D.) of Ohio, Tracer
(R.) of Missouri, Andrews (R.) of Nebras
ka, Burton (R.)of Missouri, Overstreet(R.)
of Indiana and Connelly (R.) of Illinois,
and their efforts were marked with no in
cident of choice. WaaAA
Bills wore passed authorizing the town
of Tucson,' Ariz., to issue $100,000 worth of
works- bonds ; authorizing the free
entry into the United States of articles or
animals exported for exhibition in other
countries, and nine private pension bills
favorably reported at the last Friday night
session. '" ?'f ,_; 'yA' : :lyAA'y~ â ./â¢*'
The Senate request for a conference on
the Indian appropriation bill was
agreed to.
The report of elections committee No. 2
upon the contested election case of Cor
nell vs. Swanson, from the Fifth District
of Virginia, in favor of the sitting member
(Bwanson, D.), was received, and the
minority given until Wednesday next to
present their views. y â ;,
At 5 o'clock the House took a recess
until 8 o'clock, the evening session to be
for the consideration of private pension
bills.
At the night session the House, acting
as a committee of the whole, ordered to be
reported with favorable recommendation
twelve pension bills. One of these pro
posed an increase to $50 a month of the
pension of the widow of Major-General
Samuel Sprigg Carroll, who is now and
has been all winter an inmate of the
Providence Hospital of this city, an.in
valid cripple. A bill providing a pension
of $100 a month to General Morris of New
York was reported unanimously from the
Committee on Invalid Pensions, but Pick
ler (R.) of South Dakota, chairman of the
committee, moved to reduce it to $75 a
month, and that was agreed toâ 73 to 20.
Another bill increased the pension of the
widow of General W. H. Enochs from $50
to $75 a month. General Enochs was a
member of the Fifty-second Csngress from
Ohio. Favorable action on this bill was
prevented by the expiration of thÂ© session.

WATERTOWN.N. V., April 24.-The
Rev. William N. Cleveland, the elder
brother of the President, who was retired
from the pastorate of the Presbyterian
church in Chaumont" recently, was the
recipient of a handsome testimonial from
friends in that village last night.
A notice was given a few days ago that
a donation party in Mr. Cleveland's behalf
would be held last night. A large crowd
responded. Besides gifts the pastor re
ceived the assurance that something
would be done toward having him con
tinue his work, and another congregation
may be organized, with him as pastor.
Cleveland said last night that he had not
decided to accept a 1 call from any other
church. Mrs. Cleveland is in poor health,
and that prevents him from making plans
for the future. If he receives a call from
a Cleveland (Ohio) church he says he will
consider it.

CHOATE SCORES BOWLER
Interesting Phase of Argument
in the Sugar Bounty.
Cases.
The Officious Comptroller Styled a
Pebble in the Cogs of the
Government.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 24.â The
Supreme Court of the United States to-day
heard the concluding arguments of counsel
upon the sugar-bounty cases, by Joseph H.
Choate in behalf of the claimants and by
Solicitor-General Conrad for the Govern
ment. 'AA-A^Vjyy^-' â â - y:y.y
In the course, of his speech Choate
brusquely paid his respects to Comptroller
Bowler, whose action necessitated the liti
gation, and who was an auditor of the
argument throughout. -He' was , speaking
of the power of Congress to make the ap
propriation that had been withheld from
the claimants, contending that the courts
had no jurisdiction to review that action.
"Why," said he,' "the 'cases are here
merely by accident A big pebble was
found in the cogs of the Government and
these claimants were compelled to come
here to get it removed so that the wheels
might be allowed to go round."
At another period of his address Choate
referred to the appropriation of money
made by Congress to Lafayette. "That
was made," he continued, "to partly dis
charge what they believed to have been a
debt of gratitude for great and valuable
services rendered to the United States in
the Revolutionary War. And yet (with a
significant look at Mr. Bowler) if some
persons bad been in the Government at
tbat time Lafayette would not have re
ceived that money on the ground that
Congress had no power to make that ap
propriation." . y> v '

WILL RETURN TO THE STAGE.
Mrs. Henry E. Abbey Ready to Win
Fresh Laurels.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 24.â The
Herald says this morning: Mrs. Henry
E. Abbey, wife of the well-known theat
rical manager and impresario, will return
to the stage next season. The announce
ment will no doubt be a surprise to some
of Mrs. Abbey's most intimate friends,
but it is said on good authority that she
has positively decided to take this step.
Her plans are not fully matured, but they
are well under way, and will probably be
made public in a short time.
As Miss Florence Gerard, Mrs. Abbey is
well known on the stage, from which she
retired a few years ago. She is a native of
Cambridge, Mass., but her early profes
sional experience was obtained in Eng
land, where she made her debut at
Plymouth in 1877. She made a hit in 1880
as Fanny Tarbox in Boucicault's "Bridal
Tour." and the following year she played
leading roles with Edwin Booth.
Miss Gerard's American debut was made
at the Fifth-avenue Theater in this city
on October 8, 1883, when she appeared as
Clara Douglass in "Money," and later on
she played Blanche in "The Duke'_
Motto." She returned to London and
played leading roles with Mme. Modjeska
under Abbey's management during the
season of 1885-86, and was engaged to sup
port Mme. Modjeska in this country the
following year, but soon after her arrival
she married Mr. Abbey in Boston and re
tired from the stage.
Death of Publisher Munroe.
NEW YORK, April 24.â George Munroe,
originator of the problem of cheap and
good literature, died suddenly from heart
failure on Thursday morning last at Pine
Hill in the Catskills. Mr. Munroe was
born in Nova Scotia in 1825, and by dint of
his own efforts became a rich man. He
was an ardent, thoughtful-minded Presby
terian, and his donations to church ob
jects were large and continuous.

the revolver against his temple and fired

NOT SO HOPEFUL
Two of His Pet Schemes
Are Meeting Unexpected
Opposition.
THAT SANTA MONICA JOB
Suggestion for a Commission to
Examine the Rival Deep
Harbor Sites.
SENATORS WHO ARE ON GUARD
Little Chance of the Refunding Scheme
'. Passing Congress at the Present
Session.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 24.â There
was another protracted session of the Sen
ate Committee on Commerce to-day, at
which the San' Pedro and Santa Monica
deep-harbor site was discussed pro and
con. The meeting was lively, not to say
acrimonious; but finally a spirit of com
promise was manifested. It was proposed
that a commission be appointed to visit
San Pedro and Santa Monica harbors and
report to the Senate which site was better
adapted for a deep-sea harbor. Senator
White said that he could not perceive the
necessity for this, inasmuch as three
different boards had already been ap
pointed and each one had decided in favor
of San Pedro.
It was then suggested that the amount
required to complete the Santa Monica
outer harbor improvement be included in
the river and harbor bill, with a proviso
that none of this money be expended until
the commission to be appointed had re
ported that the project was desirable and
feasible.
Senator White asked that the matter go
over until Monday, so that ample time
might be given the committee in which to
carefully consider the matter. â¢ There are
indications that the vigorous opposition of
Senators White, Vest, Berry and others is
beginning to make itself felt. Huntington
and his man Boyd haunted the Capitol
corridors as usual to-day, but they were
not as confident of success as they ap
peared yesterday. Indeed they are appre
hensive that White's hostility will yet
defeat their schemes. The old railroad
mandate and his faithful retainer went
about with downcast faces, and it was ap
parent that Mr. Huntington was dis
heartened. He begins to look careworn.
A San Francisco newspaper has can
vassed among the Senators and Repre
sentatives in order to gain a consensus of
opinion as to the fate of the funding bill.
This work seems to be altogether super
fluous. There is no chance for the funding
bill to pass either the Senate or House at
this session or at the next.
Every one who understands the situation
here appreciates the fact. There is not
the remotest chance for the bill .to' pass the
Senate. Three or four Senators could oc-
cupy enough time in speech-making to
"weary" that body, and it is patent to all
that the Senators are eager to adjourn.
Even if the bill came to a vote it is exceed
ingly doubtful if it could pass. The same
is true on the House side. The Represen
tatives are eager to get back into their dis
tricts. Selfish considerations actuate them.
They want to look after their fences.
Nine out of ten are adverse to the consid
eration of the funding bill at this session.
But even if it is considered it cannot pass.
The odious features of the funding bill
as well as the machinations of Hunting
ton have been so thoroughly exploited that
there is not the remotest possibility of the
bill passing.
It is yet a matter of considerable doubt
as to whether the funding bill should be
taken up in the House at this session.
There are daily conflicting reports as to
this. One member of Congress stated to
the Call correspondent to-night that
Speaker Reed was opposed to its consider
ation at this time, but Chairman Powers
of the Pacific Roads Committee is quite
positive that Speaker Reed will vote, as a
member of the Committee of Rules, to take
the bill up. Mr. Powers so stated to' the
Call correspondent to-ni_ht. " .".*-;

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., April 24.â
suggestion that Chairman Gowdy and
Mark Hanna have been in correspondence
regarding the Indiana delegation to the
National Convention was brought to the
notice of Chairman Gowdy. He said that
he did not know any reason why the anti-
McKinley men should desire to intercept
his mail, but when asked if they had done
so he refused to say.
"I have a number of letters from
Hanna,". said the chairman, "and have
written him a good many and I expect to
write more and receive more. The corre
spondence is private and will not be given
out for publication. That is all I have to
say." ;.- y'A-_ 'fyy'-A
Some of the Harrison men allege that
the letters from' Hanna, have insisted that
the delegates to the National Convention
be instructed for McKinley and that Gowdy
has been prodded tip to the point of in

the Harrison men though that they have
got hold of any of the correspondence or
have any wish to make it public. \i"Â»r" A

Three negro desperados kept Connells

six hours this . afternoon. Before tbey
were captured two of them were seriously
and perhaps fatally shot through the head.
This town has not experienced such an
exciting time since J. H. Paddock was
murdered by coke strikers three years ago.
In their raid the negroes held up and
robbed a dozen people, securing over $200
in cash and several watches. Three dia
mond rings were also among the booty.
The three outlaws' names are Samuel
Hill of Richmond, Va. ; William Webster
of Norfolk, Va., and John Wellington of
Petersburg, Va. The last two named fell
victims to the officers' Winchesters before
they gave up. "-- .-;.';-'.*'â¢;'
From the time the first robbery was com

From noon until \ 3 o'clock . the despera

gets of every one that came within their
range at Whiterock, where they were
joined by a fourth negro. They started
out to raid the town. Baltimore and Ohio
section-men and a telegraph operator were
held up and robbed. The shooting by
this time had aroused the whole neigh

officers and a posse started out from

Florin Crops Injured.
FLORIN, Cal., April 24.â A heavy rain
and wind storm has prevailed in this vicin
ity for the past two days, and growers, of
strawberries claim that the storm has
played sad havoc with ripening berries.
Bushels of them, It is said, have been ren
dered unfit for the market, and as Florin
contributes more than half of the berries
shipped to the Northwestern markets the
damage is here felt keenly; but it is an as
sured fact that the late, berries will bring
good prices and that high prices will pre
vail throughout the balance of the season.
W. O. Davies, manager of ? the ? Florin
Fruit-growers' Association, says the dam
aee to strawberries will aggregate thou
sands of dollars, and that the cherry crop
is almost a total loss, rain and wind caus
ing the half ripened cherries to burst al
most in two on the trees. Grapes will not
unless frost, follows the storm.
Should that occur many a fruit-grower in
this section will, be confronted by insol
vency before the coming winter is ended.

SUES FOR SAN
JOSE PROPERTY.
Caroline Schenck Seeks to
Recover Her Father's
Estate.
SHE IS IN AN ASYLUM;
Ignored in a Will, the Girl Now
Comes Forward to Claim
Her Rights.
RICHES THAT HAVE FLOWN.
The Decedent Was Considered Well
to-Do, but the Bulk of His : â¢
Wealth Is. Missing.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 24.â The insane
daughter of the late G. E. Schenck has
begun a contest for the estate left- by her"
father. Schenck died at the home of A.
Geer in this city in January, 1895, leaving
a will giving his property to Miss Emma
Axford. - There : is* but : $1300 of the estate
in the hands of the court to be distributed,
but it is believed that there is property
valued at from $12,000 to $15,000 to be un
earthed in this State. It is said that
Schenck owned valuable mines in Mexico
and was interested in an estate in Germany.
When the distribution of the estate came
up in Judge Reynolds' court this morning,
Attorney H.L. Partridge caused a sensa
tion by petitioning for a distribution of all
the property to . Caroline A. Schenck, the
daughter, who is now confined in Agnews
Asylum. l.'fv 1
Though Schenck was reputed to be rich,
only the personal property, valued at
$1300, in Geer's bands can be found. Geer
claimed that Schenck had made him a
present of the property in consideration of
kindness shown by himself and wife. â  The
will was admitted to probate, and Public
Administrator Secord was appointed to
administer the estate. Suit was begun
against Geer and the property recovered.
Caroline Schenck, who, it is alleged, is a
daughter of the deceased, went upon the
witness-stand to-day. She seemed rational
enough, and had a good memory. She
said that after a separation of sixteen
years she met her father in San Francisco
in 1882, and they Jived together in San
Francisco until her father was committed
to the Napa Insane Asylum, in 1883. â  She
was arrested in Los Angeles in 1889 for in
sanity and committed to the Stockton
asylum. After her father was ' released
from Napa he came to San Jose. Her
father frequently visited her at the
asylum, and it was at her request that she
was removed to the 'Agnews Asylum, so
his visits could be more freauent.
Medical Director Hatch corroborated
Miss Schenck' story. He said he knew
Schenck during his lifetime, and that Miss
Schenck was the daughter of the deceased.
When Schenck \ was discharged ' from the
Napa asylum his daughter came for him.
Dr. Hatch also said Schenck had made ar
rangements with him to have his daughter
transferred from the Stockton asylum jto
I Agnews. i The case was -continued for two
weeks.

Government for carrying three letter mails
into , Fort j Cudahy and ; Forty-mile Creek,
Canadian territory. The first' of these
mails will leave Victoria -by i, the Topeka,
sailing from Victoria on : May 18. Captain
Moore, who is at present in this city, will
leave for Alaska by the next steamer in
order to have boats and? men ready for the
conveyance ot the mails from Juneau. He
will take the mail by steamer to the bay at
the head of Lynn canal." This bay is
within a , few days' sailing of Victoria, is
free from ice and accessible to ocean
steamers at all times during the year.
From here the White Pass route will be
used, and mail must be "packed" by men
through fourteen miles of Alaskan terri
tory, eight miles of which are very rough.
The mail must be carried eighteen miles
farther in British Columbia territory.
From Toosh-Hie Lake the route is a com
paratively easy one, as boats will â¢ be used
on the Yukon to carry the mails to Fort
Cudahy. .; - .
Heretofore the efforts to take mail into
Forty-mile Creek proved unsuccessful, the
task being one of great difficulty. Several

CAPTURED NEAR WILBUR
Deputy Marshal Bently Lands
the Pendleton Postoffice .'.'.
Robber in Jail.
Held for a Daring Crime, in Which a
Custodian of the Mails Was
Wounded.
PORTLAND, Or., April 24.â Deputy
United States Marshal Bently brougnt
from Wilbur this morning Isaac Puddock,
captured near that town. Puddock is
charged with having held up and robbed
Postmaster Johnson of Pendleton .two
months ago, the booty amounting to over
$600. â¢ His bond is fixed at $15,000.
The story of the robbery is a trifle out of
the ordinary. The day following its per
petration a stranger named Wood was ar
rested for the crime. He was brought to
Portland, but proved to be a respectable
newspaper man -traveling through the
country. Subsequently Bently. singled
Puddock out as the real culprit. That
officer says : *
"With the exception of the robber I was
the last man in the postoffice that evening.
At that time there was but one man in the
postoffice beside the Postmaster and my
self. That man was Puddock, the prisoner
we bave just brought to Portland. As I
stepped from the interior into the outer
office Puddock turned quickly from me.
and, presenting his back, appeared to be
going over some mail he had received, his
head being bent. forward and his hands
held in front of him. I paid no, more at
tention to him and went to the' Sheriff's
office. - 'j â  -â â 'â â â  â - -.. '
'.'I bad not been in the Sheriff's office a
minute when a telephone, call from
Rourke' _ bank announced the robbery of
the postoffice. Hurrying back we found
Johnston with a bullet bole through his
hand, and the 5 money he had been count
ing when I left him gone. Johnston
stated that the. moment I crossed the
threshold into the street, the man who had
been standing in the office opened the side
door leading into the interior, and cover
ering him with a revolver, demanded that
he hand over the money in front of him.
Johnston is a cripple, having lost a leg, and
there was nothing for him to do hut obey.
The money on -the counter secured, the
robber went to the safe and took what
funds were in it. '.-He then ordered John
ston, at the point of the pistol, to go to
the back door and open it, the robber fol
lowing. if;. â -..-, y
â¢ I-: "At the door the desperado for a second
lowered, the point of his pistol, and in
stantly Johnston had grappled with him.
In the struggle that ensued, the crippled
Postmaster was shot through the hand,
causing him to relinquish his hold of the
thief, who escaped."

VETERANS AID THE SCHOLARS.
The Emblem Swung to the Breeze by
Men Who Were Foes in the
Civil War.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 24.â The
elements this morning afforded the oldest
inhabitant an opportunity for evil predic
tion which he could not resist. The wind
blew from the southeast, while scudding
clouds hurried from the mountains toward
the sea. The oldest inhabitant cast furtive
glances heavenward, shook his head and
remarked: "No festivities to-day ; big rain,
sureâ never knew these signs to fail."
There was a light mist from 8 to 10 o'clockâ
a nice dust-layer, that was aIL It was
cloudy the rest of the day, but warm. It
was the kind of afternoon that the Super
intendent of Public Instruction would
have ordered could he have had a voice in
weather bureau affairs.
The afternoon was given up to the
school children, and the exercises eclipsed
any other outdoor feature of the week.
There are more school children in Los
Angeles, so it is said, in proportion to the
total population than in any other city of
the United States. They were out and
toot part in the parade, and an imposing
and splendid procession it was.
A 1 o'clock long lines of children began
to gather in the vicinity of the queen's
tribune. The fiesta tricolor adorned each
youth and maiden, while the red, white
and blue was seen in fluttering riobons
and silken sashes. The little gowns of the
little girls were almost white, and the ef
fects of the soft colors was very pretty.
Each face glowed with happiness and pa
triotism. The marching was superb.
The line of march was in the following
order: â¢ -yyAifA
Roncovieri's American band.

At the Queen's tribune the scene was a
charming one, and her Majesty, seated on
a scarlet canopied throne, beamed upon
the youthful subjects who paid her hom
age. After the review at the tribune the
several divisions formed in line, marched
down Hope street to Sixth and thence to
the park, where the flag-raising took place.
Thirteen boys from the High . School
carried the stars and stripes, the gift of
Sir John R. Francis, president of the
Fiesta, to the school children of Los An
geles. The emblem-bearers were: Charles
Stedman, Edward Knsor, Harry H. Carr,
Roy Gibbs, Edward Sherer, Simpson Sinsa
baugh, Frank Inverarity, Frank Bugbee,
Morgan Galbraith, Paul Dougherty, Guy
Hogan, Earl Lewis and Pierce Johnson.
The flag was 30 feet long and 15 feet wide,
and of the finest bunting. Surrounding
Old Glory, in a hollow square, were forty
five girls typical of the forty-five States.
There are just forty-five public school
buildings in this city, and one representa
tive had been chosen from each school.
The exercises at the park were impres
sive. The great, pole, 150 feet high, was in
place in its solid foundation, and typified
the forests of the Pacific, the source of
much of California's wealth. All the men
chosen to hoist the great flag had served
iD the late war and the blue and the gray
united in unfurling the banner. The
"blues" were:: J. S. Pitman, private. Com
pany B, Twenty- fourth lowa Infantry; W.
A. Kennedy, first lieutenant, Company X,
First Pennsylvania Cavalry; J. L. Skinner,
captain, Company D, Twenty-seventh
Massachusetts Infantry; and the â 'grays"'
were: S. R. Thorpe, private, Comprny A,
Second Kentucky Cavalry; Johnstone
Jones, private, Company B, White's Bat
talion, Elliott's brigade, Hardee's army;
Henry L. Flash, aid to General Joseph
Wheeler.
The 2000 school children stood in rank
and file around the great liberty pole.
The presentation of the flag was charm
ingly made by Miss Nannie Longley of the'
Los Angeles High School. The flag was
received by Mayor Rader, who made a few
remarks in a patriotic strain. _ H. T. Lee
then delivered a short address to the as-
sembled children, urging strongly a regard
for the National emblem. This closed the
exercises, and the children; with the bands
playing and colors flying, marched away,
leaving Old Glory fluttering in : the breeze
from the top of the tall mast.
Tlie Evening Express to-night said: /A'
token of good feeling and admiration on
the part of the representative business
men ,of San Francisco for the citizens of
Los Angeles was shown this afternoon by
the wide distribution upon our streets of a
handsome little pamphlet entitled "San
Francisco's Greeting to Los Angeles." It
consists of thirty-two pages,*; illustrated
with engravings of many, of California's
prominent men in political and social and
commercial life, and encased in a finely
designed cover in four colors. Such widely
known men asXiau, Spreckels, John D.
Spreckels," Senator George C. Perkins, Wil
liam H. ri. Hart, Charles M. Shortriflge of
The Call, Jacob Neff and Julian Sontag
are represented in tbe souvenir and send
their greetings to Los Angeles on the occa
sion of the greatest of her great annual
fiestas. The title page is devoted to the
following announcement: ; "To foster, this
good fe.ling existing between the two
portions of the State and to promote that
friendly rivalry which means the best for
California as a whole, the center and north
send greetings to the south, accepting the
auspicious occasion of la - fiesta and its
triumphs as the most fitting time for con
gratulations to Los Angeles, the city that
has set the pace for Western progress,
public enterprise and prosperity."
FIESTA G VESTS VANCE.
Queen Mildred and Her Court Attend the
Annual Ball.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 24. â In
pleasant contrast to the din on the streets
to-night was the fiesta ball at Hazard's
Pavilion, where Queen Mildred held court
and the elite of her realm danced to please
her gracious majesty.
Never before in Los Angeles has society
done itself so proud; nor has it before at
tempted, anything on such a scale of gran
deur and magnificence.
The vast pavilion, whose interior on
ordinary occasions is almost barnlike in
its homeliness, to-night seemed trans
formed into a fairy palace. The walls and
rafters were hidden behind curtains of
delicately tinted yellow sheeting which
formed a restful background for the two
more brilliant colors red and green â used
in the decorations. From the center of the
vast dome huge scarlet festoons extended
to the four corners of the roof. On the
yellow clothed facades of the proscenium
and galleries was a delicate tracery of ivy
and ferns, with here and 5 there huge
bunches of scarlet leaved poicimas. The
floor was covered with white ducking. The
stage on which was erected Queen
Mildred's throne was similarly decorated.
The beauty of the decorations was as
nothing compared to the beauty of the
Queen herself, her maids of honor and all
her brilliant company.
When Roncovieri's concert band began
the music for the first waltz, the "four
hundred" of Los Angeles, re-enforced by
the smartest people from Pasadena and
other Southern California towns, were on
the dancing floor, while the galleries were
crowded with thrice four hundred others
who had come as spectators. Notable
among the male participants in the ball
were Captain Cattern of the United States
ship Philadelphia and his staff officers, as
well as the officers of the United States
ship Albatross, all in full-dress uniform.
All the military officers in attendance at
the fiesta were also in uniform.
The evening's programme was opened
by the Queen's maids of honor, who exe
cuted a minuet for the delectation of her
Majesty and with great credit to them
selves. The grand march was led by Mr.
and Mrs. Ezra T. StimsOn of Los Angeles,
seconded oy Mr. and Mrs. Shirley Vance
Martin of Pasadena. . After the grand
march Major E. F. C. Klokke, who acted
as master of ceremonies, presented 1 each
of the visiting naval officers to the Queen's
Prime Minister, Hon. T. E. Gibbon, who
in turn presented them to the Queen.
They were afterward introduced to the
maids of honor, each of whom favored the
several officers with a dance during the
evening. './â '...'.
The programme, which consisted of
twenty-four numbers, was a delightful
one. Supper was served from 11 until 1
o'clock in a dining-room adjoining the
pavilion, which was tastefully decorated.
The floor committee included Ezra T.
Stimson, R. H. Howell, Alfred Solano,
John T. Griffith, Shirley Vance Martin,
Ernest F. C. Klokke, William, Lemoyne
Wills, Charles C. Carpenter, Hancock Ban
ning, Clarence A. Miller, Frank G. Schu
macher, William M. Garland, Frederic B.
Henderson, Carl Kurtz, Charles H. Hast
ings, Henry J. Fleishman, Jack Jevne,
Will Norris, Loren D. Sale, William A.
Barker and James Slauson.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CHANGES.
Coast and Santa Cruz Divisions to Be

more to Be Dropped.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 24.â 1t is
reported here that on June 1 the Southern
Pacific Company will consolidate the coast
and Santa Cruz divisions, with Superin
tendent Frazer in charge. By this move
the offices of Superintendent L. Fillmore
and Roadmaster R. W. Baxter { will be
abolished, together with the ; positions ot
their clerks, operators and others. Need
of more economy is given as the reason.
It is said that Mr. Fillmore is well fixed
financially and can well afford to r retire.
It is supposed 'that, with the exception,
possibly, of. R.W. Baxter, the others will
be provided with positions in some other
branch of the service. : .1
LABOR COUNCIL.
The Secretary Resign* and E. W. Thur
man of Typographical Union
Takes the Place. A,
The Labor Council of this City has a
new secretary. ' He is E. W. Thurman of
the Typographical Union, and he was
unanimously elected to the office last
night after the compulsory resignation of
the former incumbent, E. P. Burman, was
announced.
Burman. who was long recognized as one
of the most energetic and tireless workers
for the good ' of the Labor Council,
was compelled to tender his . resigna
tion because his union, the Amalga
mated Woodworkers, had ;on last
Tuesday withdrawn from the council
ano consequently mad. him ineligible
as an officer of it. The council in a vote of
thanks expressed its appreciation of what
the retiring secretary had done in the
past, and added a hope that things might
very soon be amicably arranged so that his
union might resume its former relations
with the council. The difference of
opinion had been caused over 'the de
termination on the part of the council to
preserve itself as a non-political organiza
tion devoting its attention exclusively to
industrial and economical questions and
leaving political issues to be dealt with by
an auxiliary body formed in the interests
of union labor, each union to send a dele
gate to both bodies. The dissenting union
objected to this arrangement, but Secre
tary Burman said himself that he thought
his union had made a mistake.
Vice-President J. F. Bruns, who presided
at the meeting, announced that a danger
ously successful j cigar -making machine
had recently been introduced in New
*Â° r . k '. _ machine that threaten to displace
Skilled hand workmen, as it can be run by
unskilled child labor and turn out 2000 ci
gars a day, or 12,000 a week, at a cost of
only about $3, where the skilled hand
workman would have received $120. While
he looked upon the prospect gloomily cv-
President McArthur in a rousing, encour
aging speech said that machinery has been
displacing hand labor for years, and un
ions are still feasible and men still manage
to live. : â ;.- .;â .---'...

A DEAD BABY IN
A CUSHIONED PEW
Grewsome Discovery of the
Sexton -of St. Francis
Church.
ANOTHER CHILD MURDER
The Coroner's Autopsy Showed
That the Infant Had Been
Smothered.
NO CLEW TO THE ASSASSINS
Detectives Fail to- Find Any Trace of
the â¢ Unnatural Parents
of the Child.
The body of a murdered babe, white as
wax, excepting where here and there re
pulsive blotches of blood disfigured its
tiny form, was found in one of the pews of
St. Francis Church, corner of Montgomery
avenue and Vallejo street, last evening.
The discovery was made at 8 o'clock by
James Mullan, sexton of the church.
It was a large baby, weighing nearly
twelve pounds, and had been born alive,
presumably but a few hours prior to the
time it was found cold in death on its
strangely ; sacred bier. ; Two newspapers
carefully folded and tied around the form
sufficed as a coffin and served to hide the
lifeless form from view.
"At 7:30 o'clock the church was opened
for devotional services," said Sexton James
Mullan last evening, "and between that
time and 8 o'clock many people came
and went from the building.
"I noticed no one carrying a bundle, and
am at a loss to understand how it could
have escaped my notice. After the services
had concluded I passed through the church
in order to see that no one was left in the
building before locking up for the night.
"As I reached the last row of pews, just
in front of the door I noticed a package.
Thinking that some one had forgotten
some bundle I concluded to remove it to
the vestry to await its owner. As I raised
the package I was horrified to feel the face
of a dead child through the paper wrap
ping. I immediately dropped it, but after
thinking a few moments decided to
carry it into the vestry, which I
did. The next thing to do was
to have the Morgue officials notified, but
as they were out at the time, the child re
mained in the house nearly five hours,
much to the discomfort of its occupants.
"Whether a man or a woman occupied
the seat where I found the baby's body I
cannot say. So many people pass in and
out during an evening's service that it is
impossible to notice every one, and. two
people, or even more, might have been
responsible for the wretched act."
The body was that of a male child. . It
had unusually long hair of a light brown
color. Its eyes were blue and the body
had the appearance of a perfectly healthy
child. All indications pointed to murder
by smothering.
Dr. J. S. Barrett held an autopsy on the
body, and is of the opinion that the child
died from suffocation. â¢ Its lungs were
full of air, showing that the child had lived
some time after birth.
They were also badly congested, which,
although not absolutely conclusive, is
almost a certain j symptom of \ death from
suffocation. Its dimpled face was also
badly" contorted, as if the tiny child had
suffered extreme pain before death. came
to its relief and ended its misery.
The police were notified as to the finding
of the body by the Morgue officials as soon
as Dossible, and some of, the best men in
the department were detailed on the case.
It will, no doubt, be a difficult task to find
the perpetrator of the outrage, as not the
slightest clew is yet visible on which the
detectives can work.

POPE -MANUFACTURING COMPANY,
344 POST STREET.
COLUMBIA CYCLERY,
1970 PAGE ST., NEAR STANYAN,
Francisco, comprising seven districts,
lying within the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict.
*- In Santa Clara and San Mateo counties
the county committees decided to ap
point delegates, and in these counties no
contention has arisen, so that the delega
tions from those two counties will receive
merely formal approval.
The only nuts the committee will have
to cracK will come from San Francisco,
and these are likely to be two soft-shell
almonds. There are two contests filed
with the committee for its consideration.
One is the contest from the Thirty-sev
enth Assembly District tiled by some of the
representatives of the defeated opposition
ticket run in that district, from which
contest at least two of ( the candidates of
the opposition ticket have withdrawn, and
the other is the farcical contest filed by
Leon Dennery, who ; resided for some
months, for private reasons, in the Bur
lington lodging-house,' in the Twenty
eighth District, and who was thereafter
ousted from his seat in the County Com
mittee on the ground of non-residence.
C. G. Clinch, a member of the Yosemite
Commission and one of the leading Re
publicans and business men of the Forty
first District, * was appointed in his stead.
At the recent- regular primary the Re
publicans of the Forty-first District united
in support of the regular ticket, in
support of the regular party authorities
and in support of decent politics, but Mr.
Dennery, who &as sought to preserve his
authority and his affiliation with the
Kelly-Mahoney remnants of the Burns
elements, set up a little district primary of
his own, and thereafter filed with much
gravity the interesting documents which
the attorneys for Kelly and Mahoney drew
up for him. A contest fromr the Fotieth
district was also filed. U â¢
When the meeting of the Congressional
committee was called to order in the law
office of Secretary." John E. Richards, in
the Crocker building, at 11 a. m. yesterday,
those present were James W. Rea, chair
man; John E. Richards, Robert ' Toplitz
and W. B. Lawrence.
The committee found before it the regu
larly certified returns from . Santa Clara
County and from the County Committee
men representing the seven Assembly dis
tricts of San Francisco lying within the
Fifth Congressional District, together with
the contests from the Thirty-seventh,
Fortieth and Forty-first Assembly Dis
tricts. The "contest" from the Forty-first
district was in the nature of a humorous
set of regular returns rather than in the
nature of a protest.
It was found that the County Com
mittee of San Mateo County had not yet
submitted its returns, and in view of this
fact and also in view of the absence of sev
eral members of the committee it was de
cided to adjourn the meeting without
further action until Wednesday next,
April 29, at which all the membars of the
committee are expected to be present.
That meeting will be held in the office of
John E. Richards, and at that meeting the
returns and . the contests will be . con
sidered." - rr'yAyAyyy y?..-'^*-*-:

Good Tidings.
The visiting hotel men and their ladies
were tendered a banquet last night by the.
California Hotel Association in the Palace
HoM. The festive event ' took place in
American Hall, one of the largest
apartments in the Palace, though not
quite large enough to accommodate the
500 guests.
On this particular occasion the Palace
Hotel felt very proud of itself, for an
extraordinary effort had been made to
convince the guests that San Francisco
could vie with any ' Eastern City as an
entertainer. The test was a critical one.
Nearly every male guest was a critic, and,
to judge from their expressions of satis
faction and surprise, the banquet was a
brilliant success. American hall, with its
classic outlines, its thousands of lights and
its imposing beauty, was decorated with
tree palms between the great double
columns round the walls.
Again behind these graceful evergreens
drapery of soft-hued velvets arranged with
good taste added to the effectiveness of the
whole interior. At one end among palms
an orchestra was placed in a niche from
whence strains of inspiring music spread
ever the scene.
The tables, arranged in rows across the
floor to meet one long board that stretched
full along the side, received the best ef
forts of decorators and of an artist in his
way â the pastry chef.
Violets and sprays of maidenhair ferns
were strewn upon the tables, and at inter
vals were wonderful creations in glace,
sugar . and pastry for mounted center
pieces. These included paniers of flowers,
a Swiss chalet, a Chinese pavilion, "the
umbrella of Mile. Marie," salmon, fowl,
pryamids of jelly, lobsters, etc., all fash
ioned in sugar or jellies.
The menu was as follows:

John C. Kirkpatrick, manager of the
Palace Hotel, presided. In calling for or
der after the black coffee he read a letter
from S. F. Thorn, president of the San
Francisco Hotel Association, announcing
Mr. Thorn's regrets at not being able to
attend. The guests cheered loudly and
then all arose and the president's health
was drunk amid cheers.
The Band . played "He's a Jolly Good
Fellow," and when the singing had ceased
Mr. Kirkpatrick bade the visitors welcome.
He said the latchstring hung out, as on
the menu card, and all present were heart
ily welcome. He then introduced George
A. Knight.
"I wish I knew the hotel men," said Mr.
Knight. .*-! have not known them long
enough to know them well enough. Why
I should be called upon to speak words of
welcome, coming from the people of Cali
fornia to you visitors, is something I can't
account for."
He said funny things about hotel men,
and told the visitors if they would find
"God's nobleman," the hotel man, in his
true state, they should go up in the Sierras,
where he attends his own bar and cleans
out ,his own house in the morning. It
never occurred to him (the speaker) what
the hotel man's station in life was. They
were the entertainers of the great common
wealth, they were the men who direct !
the strangers or travelers, who took them |
by the hand and guided them. "If you j
go into a town and find a hotel man with
dyspepsia, the town; has the disease," re
marked Colonel Knight
j If Knight were a hotel man he would
give his guest a cup of coffee, with cream }
in it. in the morning, if he had to starve J
him the rest of the day. Fir^, impressions j
were most powerful. '
The speaker explained he was in the
habit of speaking at banquets where the
male element predominated; where often
coffee and champagne tasted alike in the
early morning hours, when the banquet
ers sang "He's a Jolly Good Fellow." He
felt the influence of the ladies last night,
and spoke, eloquently and in a delightful
vein about them.
He said that San. Francisco, "the Queen
of the Pacific,'-' had aright to speak for
California, and he hoped that the hotel
men would go home "thinking that Cali
fornia was at least in it with the East."
Colonel Knight took his. seat while the
whole festive party applauded. At last,
when something like silence returned, Mr.
Kirkpatrick started' the * fun again ' by In-

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen : Such
has been the warmth of our welcome that it is
difficult for us to realize that we are pilgrims
from a far country, and that 3000 miles away
our boarders are shifting for. themselves and
our creditors fruitlessly knocking at our outer
gates, "unwept, unnumbered and unsung."
We who come from the cold, effete and clammy
East, filled as we are with pride and codfish,
pie and self-esteem, have been touched and
electrified by the kindness and courtesy which
has been so prodigally bestowed upon us from
the moment we entered the portals of this
lovely land. California is well named the
"Golden State," for though the precious metal
has well nigh disappeared from your streams
and hills, there is a stock of pure gold in your
hearts which seems inexhaustible.
Since deciding to make this trip I have been
reading up the history of the forty-niners and
what they went through to get out here. Some
of our party went through a good deal to get
here. Some of them went through everything
I had, except my return ticket, and now I find ;

\ That is from one of Watts' hymns, and I have
always noticed that Watts knew what's what.
Come wnat may we will never forget the
gorgeous time we have had on this visit and
the boundless hospitality of you wild and
woolly Westerners and the glories of this land
of sunshine and of flowers and of the wonders
of this climate. We are going to have some of ;
this climate canned to take home with us.
Already we have forgotten the fatigues and
privations of our trip across the continent; of
how, when crossing the desert, no water passed
our parched lips for many moons; of how our
eyesight has been impaired looking for the
three-of-a-kind that never came of how night I
after night our rest has been I. ,*ken and the
ambient air rudely shattered by the sterterous '
breathing of our plump contingent, and the i
conversational powers of our sisters and our '
cousins and our aunts; of how Brother Brock- '<
way's whiskers "trimmed to every favoring
gale" created such enthusiasm among the
sauaws along the line that we feared we would
never be able to get him across the desert un
scathed; of how we came flying across the con
tinent, the Chicago landlords in front of us,
the Boston landlords behind us-rthere we were
like Mahomet's coffin, suspended between
heaven and earth, or, perhaps, it would be
better to say, "'twixt the devil and the deep
sea." And we have almost forgotten the awful
dustâ for once New York had to take Chicago's
dust, but we passed it along to Boston.
And the changes of climate. As soon as we
got on our linen dusters and palm-leaf fans
we ran into fourteen feet of snow, and by the
time we had donned our fur overcoats and red
i mittens the mercury went up to 120 deg. in
the shade. Really some one ought to invent a I
patent, automatic, self-regulating, hack-action, i
j ball-bearing, self-adjusting style of underwear
: for transcontinental travelers. I
All these privations and hardships we have i
forgotten since we entered California, and
could the X-rays be turned upon us the fact
would be disclosed that we are filled to over
flowing with kindly feelings toward you, our I
hosts, as well as of prunes and fruit, canned I
goods, native wines, evaporated peaches, liver
pills and gratitude. * j
Joking aside, we are a fat crowd. lam not a !
sample. I am here as a horrible example. Well i
might the assembled multitudes along the line I
say with Jaques in Shakespeare's "As You '
Like It."

to those of any other city or : State in - the

opened up to them our museums of art and our I

ever, has caused us to change our minds in
this regard, and I know that I voice the senti
ments of the New York delegation and, I be
lieve, of every delegation present to-night, in
according to the Hotel Association of Southern
California the palm for having outdone any
thing heretofore attempted for the pleasure of
the hotel men of the United States. .*.y
There is notpernaps a lady or gentleman
among the visitors present who has not looked
forward to this visit to Southern California as
the fulfillment of a dreamâ the realization of
a hope and the gratification of a desire which
nothing else could satisfy. We who dwell
within the sound of the rush and roar of the
Atlantic, and whose lives partake of the
stormy nature of that ever surging and restless
ocean, have longed to gaze upon, the placid
waters and breathe the balmy breezes of your
Pacific sea. Accustomed to the extremes of
heat and cold which characterize our Eastern
climate, we have listened with envious ear to
the equable temperature which prevails along
your coast, and of the semi-tropical products
of your country. ' . -
In accepting the Invitation of your commit
tee to visit these golden shores, and witness
with our own eyes that fairy land which was
so graphically described to us by your inimi
table Professor James, we did so in the ex
pectation of seeing the garden spot of America,
i We were prepared to gaze upon a veritable
; paradise. It is, therefore, with intense pleasure
that I say to you to-night that the realization
has fer surpassed our anticipations, and lam
sure that henceforth every one of us will feel a
deeper pride in our country for having within
our own territory such scenes as we have wit
nessed during the week that has just passed;
and so long as memory lasts it will be a per
petual delight to each and ail to recall the
names of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Redlands,
Riverside, San Diego ' and * Coronado. ' The
char , which nature has shed over these scenes
*** of itself sufficient to fill t he mind of the
traveler with wonder and delight, but to those
who li 8 " 5 . 11 V? me *&"_*& naturt > claim upon
our admiration will hold a secondary place,
hen V 1 the Â£vt Â»"e we look back upon these
golden days, it will not be the balmy atmos-
_ here > th orange groves, not the* fragrant
flowers that will appeal to us so much as the
generous hospitality that has been extended
everywhere.
*â * have suld that the natural loveliness of your
country has exceeded our fondest anticipa
tlolls *. I may add that the heartiness of your i
greetings, the royalty of your welcome and
the bounteous nature of your hospitality, have
filled our hearts with eternal gratitude. This
i? especially true of the ladies of Southern
California, and I am glad to avail myself of this
opportunity to express on behalf of the New
* ork delegation then appreciation of the uni
form kindness received by them at the hands
of these fair women who have literally strewn
our path with flowers. -.*';

MAY SERVE AS SECOND

Appointed Assistant
Pastor.
The Doctor May Read the Opposition's
Document To-Day, as It Will
B. Filed.
The partial list of Dr. C. 0. Brown's op
ponents, as published in The Call of yes
terday, created considerable comment
among all the members of the First Con
gregational Church. It seems that three
names of persons dead were published. In
addition to this the Misses Hall and Mrs.
Carlton wish it understood that ' they
never signed the list. They fail to say,
however, that they are not opposed to Dr.
Brown. . ;â  A'yA--.
George T. Gaden and Dr. Jonathan T.
McDonald claimed that nearly a score of
names were on the, list which should not
have been given out for publication.
When pressed, however, ,to point them
out they curtly refused to do so, alleging
as a reason that it would display their
strength to the other side. . â :.** ; ,i
The opponents of- Brown held an en
thusiastic meeting in the Columbia build
ing last: night. The several committees
out canvassing for names filed their final
I reports, the total actual signatures now be
j inn 206. . In addition to * this ' there : are
I ninety others who will vote against Brown
jif aiven the opportunity. '-. ? ,
It was agreed to formally file the , list
j with, the trustees to-day, a special com-
I mittee being appointed for that purpose.
; Yesterday the Bay Conference -officially
notified trie First Church . of . the action
taken by.them last Tuesday. The notice,
however, had not been received by Deacon
Morse at a late hour last night. It was
stated yesterday, on what appears to be
good authority, that Dr. Brown had finally
concluded to resign. ' There is, however; a
string attached to such a move. The pas
tor is said to have consulted a well-known
attorney, who advised him to tender his*
resignation, as his present; position* was
not Â tenable. y The , lawyer - made ? the ;? ad
ditional suggestion that the First Church
could then hire the unfrocked pastor as an
extra. ;'. Brown \ stated 3 last Â«night i that - he
had not resigned as 'yet; and tuat he cer
tainly would occupy the pulpit on Sunday.

The Grand Commandery Knights Temp

in right courtly style. In right Californian
style would be the proper synonym, for the

and ingenuousness that is nothing if not
Californian. â¢ ., > .ilj-:. -A Azyj-.y.

their complexity and' mechanical preci
sion. Every figure was greeted with con
tinuous and well-deserved applause.
- After the drill, Commander Sir Martin
Jones delivered the address of welcome to
the Grand Commandery, in whicb he
spoke of the royal ; preparations that had
been made for the occasion, regretting the
rainy weather which had prevented all the

At midnight the guests repaired to the

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
After thisâ the sunshine.
We can all be haymaking before long.
At the call of the hotel men every Cali
fornian comes to the front.
Los Angeles seems to be satisfied with
herself and will do it again.
Our hotel visitors will have no cause to
complain that we gave them a dry time.
Sternberg should not be sent to jail with
out the company of his wicked partners.
The festal movement will now come
north and the dance will be nearer home.
Sternberg stuffed the register, but who
put up the job and worked it out for profit?
Republicans of the Fourth i District
should drop Kelly and Mahoney into a
cavity.
Leave orders for The Sunday Call to
day and good reading will be yours to
morrow.
In the hands of a Congressman who is
truly Democratic the inkstand is as mighty
as the brickbat.
The funding scheme seems to be side
tracked, but it is just as well to keep a
watch on the switch.
Before you start out for your Saturday
purchases read our advertisements and see
where the bargains are.
Whether our visitors saw the Cliff House
in storm or in sunshine they saw a view
no other city can equal.
There were more registration stuffers
than one at the last election and more than
one should be punished.
In trying to dodge the rock of Protec
tion in the campaign, Democracy will fall
into the abyss of the deficit.
The British are still talking about Vene
zuela as if they did not understand that
we are to settle the question.
Delaware and Georgia promise to break
the record with a peach crop this year, but
they haven't passed the safety line yet.
California interests are good cards to
draw to at St. Louis, and it would be folly
to discard them before the draw begins.
It is said we have now bad the last
storm of the season and let us hope the
Weather Bureau will live up to the promise.
Before Kelly and Mahoney find a turn
ing in the long lane they are walking they
may find it leading to the door of a prison.
California cannot afford to neglect her
own interests at St. Louis for the purpose
of booming the favorite son of some other
State.
The glad hand to every candidate is
what California will show at the St. Louis
convention, and therefore they will give
her a show.
There has been no Democrat of note up
to date who has ventured to declare that
he sees even a glimmer of possible victory
for his party this year.
Weyler 'a proclamation to the Cubans
demanding a surrender in twenty days is
one of those mud bluffs that will cave
down at the first storm.
If the Missouri Democrats get the Chi
cago convention to nominate "Silver
Dick" for President, they won't care who
writes the platform, nor what it says.
If Congressmen Hall and Money intend
any further ink slinging at one another
they should be put out of the committee
rooms of the Capital and furnished with
pens.
When it comes to the money question
In the Chicago convention, there will be
either a noise like hades broke loose or a
silence disturbed only by the sound of a
plank dropped in the mud.
â¢ London has got far enough along in
civilization to start a movement for the
suppression of street noises, and we trust
she will give it such a send-off that it will
get to San Francisco before long.
The political situation will not shape
itself definitely until the convention meets
at St. Louis, and to pledge our delegation
to a . particular candidate beforehand
would be taking a stand before we ; Knew
what to stand on.
Democrats Have been so quiet regarding
the Presidential campaign this year, it is
worth noting that one of them has
found nerve enough in his tongue to call
the friends of McKinley "volatile vulgar
ians," and thus the first alliterative roor
back of the canvass has been started on
its rounds.
Because New York had a snowstorm on
April 7 with the thermometer at 30 degrees
and then a > series of alternations ending
with the hottest April day on record on
the 14th, that city is putting up a claim to
be the greatest weather manufacturing
center on the continent, but Chicago is to
be heard from and even Boston may put in
a protest. ' â 
A WOED TO FABMESS.
Protection and reciprocity are as neces
sary to the material well-being of the
people oi the United States as. sunshine
and rain are to their physical well-being,
and it may be said that of the innumerable
lines of occupation* no class of producers
arc more directly interested' in such tariff
laws and reciprocal trade relations with
outside peoples as : would establish and
maintain home-consumption markets than
our farmers, especially those who produce
cereals.
It may not be generally known but it is
nevertheless true that the price of bread
stuffs at every American railway station
and river and ocean wharf is fixed by
Liverpool grain and flour merchants. It
is also true that the surplus wheat of
Russia, India and Argentina exerts a
greater influence in measuring the world's
available supply than that of America.
For twenty-five years the food centers of
Europe have given India and Argentina
every possible encouragement to extend
their wheat acreage, and for some time
past the farmers of the United States have
been a mere convenience to Liverpool and
the grain markets of the Continent to the
extent of being called upon to provide
only for any balance in the demand that
is left over after the countries named have
marketed their surplus.
More than a third of a century ago
Liverpool, which is the leading center in
the world for the accumulation and dis
tribution of breadstuffs, ascertained tbat
grain might be raised in South America
and Asia and laid down in her storage
houses cheaper than it could be fetched
from the United States, and the steadily
increasing imports from those countries
in recent years testify how well that great
grain market has succeeded in shifting
the leading source of breadstuffs supplies
for Europe from America to regions where
farm labor and the other items of expense
which enter into the cost of farm opera
tions are to be obtained at a very much
less expense than in this country. Thus
it is that prices of American farm products
in Europe are fixed in these days by the
cost of production in India and Argentine,
where the cost of labor is considerably
lower than is paid to- pauper labor in
Europe. That is to say, the American
farmer is obliged to sell the surplus
product of his acres at prices that are de
termined by his competitor in Asia and
South America, who pays very much less
for labor and the other items of expense
than our farmer pays besides the cost of
reaching the markets of Europe from the
countries named is materially less than
from any of the grain-producing country
of the United States lying west of the
Missouri River. These things, together
with the destruction of the home market
by Democratic tariff, legislation, explain
why grain farming in this country is not
now remunerative.
The American farmer ought to under
stand by this time tbat the salvation of
his calling depends upon re-enactment
of a protection law that will justify put
ting the machinery of our industries again
in motion, that they may give employ
ment to the thousands and thousands of
farm-product consumers whom Demo
cratic free trade has sent into en forced
idleness. The farmer should know that if
our industrial strength were developed by
protection against pauper competition a
satisfying market for his product would
spring up in nearly every community, and
that he would then not only receive good
paying prices for his produce but he would
save the expense of reaching distant mar
kets.
Surely the American tanner needs to be
protected quite as much against the pau
per farm labor of India, Russia and Ar
gentina as the American producer of man
ufactured commodities. And it may be
said that the California farmer has no ex
cuse for not seeing very clearly that there
can be no adequate compensation for his
efforts until consumers of his produce
come from mills and factories of his own
State. But there will be no mills and fac
tories in California until capital is assured
of the kind of protection that protects
against a pauper-labor competitor who,
when left free to come and go at his own
will and pleasure, is as hurtful to the con
sumer and the agriculture of America as
the locust was to ancient Egypt. As we
have said, the salvation of the American
fanner, especially the farmer of Califor
nia, is in a permanent home market for
the products of his acres.
THE OALIFOBNIA LIAR.
The fact that no one acquainted with
California dares tell the truth about the
State to strangers lest be be deemed a liar
is an interesting comment on the intel
ligence of the Eastern States, and an ex
planation of many of the hardships im
posed on California by reason of this
ignorance. The idea has been admirably
expressed by Jewett Wilcox, superinten
dent of the hotel service of the Illinois
Central Railroad. He is one of the 600
hotel men who are visiting California, and
as a person of large experience and ability
his remarks are worthy of special atten
tion. This is what he has said in an in
terview about California:
"We have found everything that we did
not expect. We have been interested and
surprised ever since we crossed the line at
Barstow. Eastern people don't know any
thing about this State. Most of us thought
it a sort of desert with an occasional oasis.
One trouble about this trip is that we shall
all be set down as liars when we get back
East. They will say that we have acquired
the Chicago habitâ in Chicago, where
they are pretty good talkers themselves."
The very fact that - California is so
warmly praised and so devotedly loved by
all who have come within the influence
which it exerts prejudices even some
casual visitors against the State. Gener
ally the first thing that every such traveler
does Is to belittle the value of what he
actually sees. This is intended as a re
buke to our enthusiasm and as an ex
hibition of superior wisdom. Our winds,
which make malaria and all other zymotic
and epidemic diseases impossible, and
which make our men so robust and our
women so beautiful, are declared to be
"horrible." And yet during the whole
winter callas and heliotropes bloom fr eely,
and banana trees grow without damage
in Golden Gate Park, where: even, the
dullest may see them and be able to under
stand the lesson which they teach.
It is Eastern ignorance of California and
its value to the Nation that has made it
possible for a railroad lobby to turn the
serious attention of Congress to a shame
less scheme for perpetuating: the evils of
railroad crookedness and monopoly; that
by neglecting to subsidize :an American
steamship line to the Australian colonies
baa enabled English transportation com
panies to divert the Australian traffic from
the western gateway of the United States;
that j has : compelled the arid West to re
main undeveloped by forcing upon us the
English idea* of riparian ownership of
water in streams, and that has held in
abeyance a necessary Government support
ot the Nicaragua canal. y

A UNITED DELEGATION.
There seems to be an opinion, doubtless
of very limited extent, that unless the
California delegates to the Republican
National Convention are sent pledged to
support some particular candidate they
will not be able to unite on any candidate.
Thus Paris Kilburn, an eminent local Re
publican, says: "Let any one study the
history of the unpledged California dele
gation at the Minneapolis convention four
years ago. Our delegates were divided
into three factions. There was no instruc
tion or concert of action, so no influence
was exerted and no laurels were gained."
Mr. Kilburn argues that an instruction to
the California delegates to act as a unit at
St. Louis would be tantamount to an in
struction to support some delegate who is
very popular in this State. C
We do not see why this should follow.
Assume, in the case of an unpledged dele
gation, tbat all the delegates would be
favorable to a particular candidate, it by
no means follows that they would ] neces
sarily support that candidate. To expect
them to do so when it might easily be that
such a course would work a distinct in
jury to the State and to the Republican
party would be to assume the delegates to
be possessed of less ability and patriotism
than they certainly should have. The ob
stinate support of a candidate who cannot
be nominated might well j be â  expected to
cripple the State with the National party. !
Again, to assume that the California
delegation could not act as a unit in the
absence of definite instructions concerning
some candidate will hardly be regarded as
a compliment by the Republicans of the
State. It is uniortunately true that the
lack of unanimity on the part of Califor
nians has been their besetting sin in the
past, but there is unmistakably a deter
mination on the part of Republicans to
make the most of the extraordinary op
portunity that has now presented itself.
The advantages to be secured by concert of
action are greater than they have ever
been before in the history of the party in
this State. The earnest movement which
is now on foot to rescue the party organi
zation from unworthy hands shows the
temper of the voters. Politics which shall
be both clean and intelligent Is now the
order of the day. There seems at present
to be no reason for assuming that a dele- j
gation pledged for no particular candidate
would be so lacking in appreciation of the
advantage to be secured by harmonious
action as to be unable to agree on some
intelligent policy for the common good.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
Horticulturists will be interested in an
exhaustive article in to-morrow's Call dis
cussing means foÂ± averting damage by
frost. Had this important subject been
better understood the injury suffered this
year would have been unnecessary.
This is only one of many special features
that will make The Sunday Call instruc
tive and interesting. A glimpse of the
high civilization existing in Arizona over
two centuries ago will be afforded by an
article devoted to the noble ruins of an an
cient mission that is hardly known, with
illustrations showing the grand propor
tions and excellent preservation jfj of
what still remains standing. ' *
The Fort Point and Alcatraz lighthouses
will be described and illustrated and will
constitute another of the series devoted to
California lighthouses. *
A contribution entitled "How Two
San Francisco Women Achieved Fame in
Japan" will give an exceptionally inti
mate and interesting view of life in the
land of the chrysanthemum. * â¢
The wonderful variety of the shipping
in the bay of San Francisco will be indi
cated in a special study of the subject.
Denis Kearney, who has been a sailor in
his day, will furnish a thrilling experience
entitled "Overboard in the Indian Ocean."
"Whist Cranks" will not likely agree
with W. C. Morrow's rather savage attack
upon the game that is now so popular, or
with his reasons for denouncing it.
William Ahrens will tell the remarkable
story of hia recent explorations in the
hitherto unknown wilds of German New
Guinea. :*â¢*â¢â¢-,,;- â¢-- .-'
"Courting Made Difficult" and "The
Deed of a Hero" are two charming tales.
Minor contributions in variety, will ap
pear, all specially prepared for to-morrow's
issue. One will describe an odd local char
acter who makes his living by fishing up
things from the bottom of the bay. An
other will tell of a historic cannon that
now serves at one of San Francisco's street
corners as a curbstone fender. Another
will record the achievements of a wonder
ful rat- terrier, and still another will de-
scribe a splendid waterfall in the near-by
mountains.
The foregoing list is merely a sample of
the good things to be found in to-morrow's
Call. There are many others, as the in
creased size of the paper has made neces
sary a more varied and abundant selection
than was formerly the rule. The depart
ments peculiar to the Sunday issue will be
full of meat. These include literature,
society, fashions, the children's page, new
things in the sciences and arts, the drama,
music, etc. In addition to all these will
be special telegrams from correspondents
in the leading cities of the world. The
Sunday Call is the ideal paper to send to
Eastern friends.
SHALL WE INSTRUCT?
San Bernardino Times-Index.
The San Francisco Cam advocates anunin
structed delegation to St. Louis from Califor
nia and urges many cogent reasons for its po
sition. The Bulletin is equally strong in Its
advocacy of an instructed delegation, that the
position of the State in relation to Presidential
possibilities may be unmistakably defined.
It is possible that the proper action for the
Congressional and State conventions to take
on this question will bo found to be -between
the positions taken by these two papers. The
Times-Index is not prepared to say that it Is
either wise or good political policy to elect and
send to St. Louis a body of men, be they never
so able and representative, .without any ex
pression whatever from the conventions as to
choice oi candidate for A. President.
Neither .do we believe that it A would
|be wise to _ send a delegation ;to
St. Louis hampered by iron-clad instructions
and rendered incapable of exercising that
judgment necessary ..to deal with facts and
conditions of which it is impossible for the
conventions sending them to have knowledge.
Marked changes in the political situation are
liable to occur in the month that will elapse
between the j holding, of our ? conventions and
the National Convention at St. Louis, and the
delegates should not j be, compelled to 1 violate
pledges* in order to conform their action to
such changes, when it is for the best Interest
of the party and State. ;. â¢
The Times-Index believes that the proper
course to pursue is for the Republicans of Cali
fornia in Congressional and State conventions
to express their choice for Presidential candi
dates in unmistakable j terms, elect delegates
in full sympathy with * their preferences, but
leave them otherwise free to act. We believe
that such a course will best subserve tbe inter
est* of â  the party and the State, so far as they
; can be affected by political action.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Not. long sine, a medium-sized man with
raven-black ringlets ?: and dark | eyes arrived
here and registered at the Occidental Hotel as
Salva de Capdeville of Havana, Cuba. Â«He cave
out that he was a Spanish Count and exhibited
a copy of a Portland paper wherein he was in
terviewed as the Count Capdeville, and the en
terprising drummer gave his "views" on the
war in Cuba.
His blue blood boiled at the idea that a lot
of negroes should try to build up a republic in
the "pearl of the Antilles," and he warmly
commended Emilio Castelar for his course in
the war. -l
In an elaborate interview he repeated that
he was a Count and let it be understood that
the castles of the Capdevilles extended from
Salvador Capdevilla, the Cigar Drummer Who Claimed .to Be a Spanish Count.
Seville to Salamanca. His family was accord
ing to the entrancing tale extremely old and
famous for hundreds of years. . 'â¢'â Ar.y'-
The Spanish Consul read the fairy tale, and
could not recollect that he had heard of the
renowned family of the Capdeville before. He
got down his record books and j thumbed
through them patiently. Never a Capdeville
could be found.
"I knew at once, when I read the story, that
the fellow was not a count," . said the Consul.
"He could not be. If he was his name would
be down in the volumes relating to famous
families." â  ''â :...â¢.-â  A'yry .â -..?
Confronted with this statement, the thrifty
drummer still persisted he was a count. He
said the Consul of Spain wouldn't know. To
others he said the story had helped him in dis
posing of his cigars, and he has been much
amused at his position in the role of a count.
He has been at the Grand and Baldwin, as
well as the Occidental. The fact that he has
represented himself as a count has been dis
cussed from time to time. "Count" Capdeville,
as he writes himself, .is reported also to be a
gay young gentleman among the ladies, con
sidering himself to be a great breaker of
hearts. . _____ _______ .."

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
AN UNFLEDGED; DELEGATION.
A Republican Who Voted FOBiRtEMONT and
'â¢â¢;â¢*â¢ Lincoln Gives Good Counsel.
To the Editor of the Son Francisco Callâ Sir:
I claim to be about the oldest Republican on
the Pacific Coast, having voted for Abraham
Lincoln for * the Legislature in Sugar Creek
precinct, Sangamon County, 111., in 1854;
afterward supported Fremont for President in
1856 and Lincoln in 1860.
â  The Call is taking the proper course on In
structions, or pledging of delegates. What
power will a pledged delegation have at St.
Louis? Oregon has already jumped into the
political band wagon and has got all the seats,
and, of course, will be tho' beneficiary of that
action. . If California sends an unpledged del
egation Washington will follow suit, for she is
more likely to follow California than the little
commonwealth of Oregon. Twenty votes in
California, if united, will be apower; then add
eight more from Washington, and all candi
dates and their friends will call around at St.
Louis to interview the twenty-eight, ask their
wishes, desires, consult their judgment; but
with pledged delegates the political manager
of a certain candidate will regard them as his
own property, and rightfully; others, or
friends of others, will take it for granted that
the collars about their necks are too tight to
allow the chained animals any freedom and
will pass them by. The Call is right.
This State will not Instruct, whatever Call
fornia may do, but I believe I express the
wishes of the large majority of Republicans in
this State when I oppose the pledging of dele
gates and desire co-operation from the Golden
State. Yours, etc.. R. H. Ballinqeb.
Port Townsend, Wash., April 21, 1896.
REPAVE MARKET STREET.
In the Meantime Refaie the Crossings and
Take Out the Cobblestones of 1849.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
The demands of the Cycle Board of Trade
and the Merchants* Improvement Association
for the repaying of Market street ought to be
supported by all good citizens. There are
other matters, however, that might well be at
tended to in the meantime. I refer particu
larly to the proper care of the City's main
thoroughfare under present conditions. ;.y
Superintendent Ashworth ought to know
that there is not a block from the ferry to
Valencia street in good order. It is the duty
Â°_ the Superintendent of Streets to repair
these defects or compel property-owners to do
so. But this is not the worst feature of this
great roadway. * The streets that lead into
Market street from the north have had their
junctures paved in a half-decent way, but th_
crossings on the south side are in miserable
shape. 'V.
Just take a look at the south side crossings
at the corners of Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
streets, if you want to see what our municipal
officers permit in the way of silurianism. At
those points you will find the original clam
shaped, razor-edged cobbles that were adopted
in 1849, and that have been wobbling about in
the sand ever since. The authorities don't
even put down basalt blocks, which would ba
something of a relief, but allow the dangerous
cobbles to stick up like the teeth of an in
verted harrow, threatening alike vehicles,
pedestrians, wheelmen and the drivers of
vehicles. y. -
The tracks of the different car lines leading
from the south are also neglected and will
ever be so unless the City's officers perform
their duties and compel needed improve

Freight to Be Moved on
the Valley Road in
Six Weeks.
RATES YET UNDECIDED.
Traffic Manager Moss Has Made
a Thorough Inspection of
the Line.
BOXCARS RUN LIKE COACHES.
When Merced Is Reached the Road
Will Be Able to Handle All the
Business Offered.
In six weeks from date, barring acci
dents or other untoward . circumstances,
the Valley road will De prepared to carry
freight between Stockton and Merced,
though the carriage of passengers will in
all probability be deferred for some time
after that date.
Traffic Manager John" Moss returned
from his tour of inspection of the com
pleted portion of the road Thursday night
and found things in a most satisfactory
condition. He went from Stockton as far
as the Merced River, and was gone about
four days, having left the City on Sunday
night. He traveled over the line in a
freightcar, as the road has not yet received
any of the passenger coaches which are to
comprise part of its equipment. Mr. Moss
said that he was both gratified and sur
prised to find how smoothly the car ran.
Its motion, be added, was as smooth as
that of an ordinary passenger coach.
"I thiuk I can now say approximately
when we shall be able to begin business
over our road," said Mr. Moss, after con
cluding his appreciative remarks on the
thorough manner in which the road-bad
been constructed. W
"We are now at work on the bridge
across the Merced River. This will take
about three weeks to complete, and we
will then have about three miles and a
half of track to lay to the town of Merced
from the river. We calculate that all this
work will be finished in about six weeks
and the road placed in such a condition as
to permit of the prompt and satisfactory
moving of all the traffic that will be offered.
We will thus be in ample time to move
the wheat crop from the lower valley
points. â¢
"Our rolling-stock is being continually
increased and our facilities six weeks from
now will enable us to go into the field feel
ing assured of being amply provided for
the work we shall endeavor to perform.
"No rates will be announced until we
are fully prepared to begin hauling freight.
This is a matter that will require consid- j
I erable care, for while our rates as first put j
' into effect will no doubt be changed with j
i the increase in our mileage and the growth i
j of our business, we yet desire to make |
! them such that as few changes as possible j
will be necessary, as stable rates are an
important factor to the farmer as well as
to the merchant, and in fact to all who
ship goods." "-/â¢:.'â¢â¢'â¢ .*..*
This determination of the Valley road
to begin the actual business of transporta- !
tion about the first week in June will no j
doubt prove a eratifying surprise to the
people along the route between Stockton \
and Mercea, as it had previously been j
stated that the road would not be in shape i
for business before the latter part of July i
or the first part of August. The change of :
plan is due, however^ to the unexpected
rapidity with which Chief Engineer
Storey has pushed the work of construc
tion to the Merced, no less than two miles
of track being laid a day for ten censecu- I
tive days during the period just before
reaching the Merced River. â '*,â â¢? * .* \
This entire project, vast as it is, was al
most magical .in its development Its
birth dates back but little more than a
year, and was almost simultaneous with
the conception of the enterprise. The first
preliminary meeting for the construction !
of a road into the heart of tne San Joaquin i
Valley was held on January 22, 1895.. The I
original idea was to raise $350,000 as a fund j
with which to start the. construction of
the road, but Claus Spreckels, taking a
broad and liberal view of the situation,
changed the entire original plan of those
who were instrumental in calling the
meeting by offering to subscribe $500,000 if
the fund to be raised was fixed at $3,000,
--000. A committee was appointed at this
meeting, with the result that it was decided
to incorporate a company with a capital !
stock of $6,000,000, with the understanding I
J that operations should' be commenced as !
soon as $2,000,000 worth of stock had been
subscribed.' A meeting to receive sub
scriptions was arranged for, part of the
call for the assemblage reading as follows:
The proposition is to make it the people's
road, owned by the people and operated in the
interests of the people, and it is to you ns a
part of the people that we turn for assistance.
This meeting took place on January 29,
and on the first day $1,025,000 had "been
subscribed, Claus Snreckels signing for
$500,000. John D. Spreckels for $100,000
and Adolph B. Spreckels for $100,000.
Alvinza Hayward and W. F. Whittier
each put his name down for $50,000. ' On
February 8 the $2,000,000 mark was
reached and passed.
On February 20 the first general meeting
of stockholders was held, those in attend
ance representing more than $100,000,000.'
At this time the subscriptions had reached
$2,248,000. Incorporation was effected on
February 25, this honor having been rele
gated to Claus Spreckels, W. F. Whittier,
Charles Holbrook, John T. Doyle and
E. F. Preston. In the articles of incor
poration provision was made for a road
estimated to be 350 miles long, extending
from San Francisco to or near Bakersfield.
Clans Spreckels was elected president,
W. F. hittier first; vice-president and
Robert Watt second vice-president. On
March 5, 1895, Alexander Mackie was
elected secretary, and on the day follow
ing W. B. Storey Jr. was elected chief en
gineer. . A week later terminal facilities
were secured in this City at China Basin
through Legislative enactment, and on
March 11 the first bids for material were
sent out. Since then , there, has been no
cessation in the work of construction.
.. Among the most important features of
the stock trust certificate, and one which
bears on ? the question of rates, is the fol
lowing provision:
Said corporation shall so operate said road
that the basis for freights and fares shall be
the lowest rates of charge which will yield
sufficient revenue .to the company to pay for
the proper maintenance, operation and better
ment of said road, together with proper pro
vision for. the payment of interest upon any
bonded indebtedness, if any there be, together
with the creation of a sinking fund therefor,
as reauircd by law; also for the creation of a
surplus fund for the use of said road, and the
payment to' the stockholders of a sum not to
exceed 6 per cent per year, upon the capital
stock actually paid into said corporation.

TO MAKE A NEW TORPEDO
Moves With Terrific Speed Be
neath the Surface of the
Water.
A Strong Company Formed for the
Protection of this Har
bor.
The Pacific Torpedo and Supply Com
pany, an organization to make, repair,
bay and sell torpedoes, both stationary
and movable, has filed articles of incor-
poratlon. The torpedoes to be dealt in are
to be for the protection of San Francisco
harbor and the Pacific Coast. The direc
tors of the company are C. F. MacDermott
of Oakland, Peter Dean of San Francisco,
George H. Mendell of San Francisco, F. M
Close of Oakland and Charles Bone of San
Francisco.
The capital stock of the corporation is
$1,000,000, $250 of which has been sub
scribed. . ' A'-'.'A
Colonel George H. Mendell, U. 8. A., re
tired, who was seen at his home last even-
ing, said that at present it could not be
said definitely where the proposed plant
for building the torpedoes would be estab
lished or how extensive it would be. , He
remarked: , -
"There is little to be said now other
than that the company has incorporated.
The magnitude of the plant will depend
altogether on the success of the torpedo,
which can only be determined by actual
experiment. Yes, we are building a
machine, and I believe that it will prove
successful. I cannot say when we will be
ready to make a practical test."
Replying to other inquiries Colonel
i Mendell indicated that the new torpedo
i would be guided from the shore to strike
; a ship within a distance of two miles.
The torpedo in traversing that distance
would be invisible beneath the surface of
the water. No sign of the destroyer's
| approach would be given. .*. The explosive
force of 700 pounds of dynamite would
sink the largest cruiser or battle-ship
afloat. ' ' 'y;z ,yyu?y!-y. :;.â ''
Should the torpedo prove to be as
t effective as the , inventors expect there is
! no doubt that* the company- will secure
? orders for their construction from the
J United States, and perhaps from Russia
j and other foreign countries.
The fact that Colonel Mendell, who has
served so long in .'the';. United States en
gineer corps, and whose judgment of de
structive inventions would only be formed
after careful and intelligent study, has be
come identified with the manufacture, is
regarded as _ significant, leading well-ad
; vised men to believe that a very important
j step has been taken in the direction oi
harbor defense. Colonel Mendeii is not
the man to be carried away with a pretty
scheme on paper. There "is surely some
thing in the invention of this submarine
agent of warfare that is simple and practi
cal. Should a torpedo go straight to the
object at which it is aimed, and then ex
plode at the right time, ironclad fleets
would be useless for harbor attacks.
THE DEACON HIGHWAYMAN.
David Oldham On His Way to Ukiah
for a New Trial.
David Oldham, better known as "Dea
con," who was sontenced to twelve years
in Folsom for stage-robbery in Mendocino
County, was brought to the Central Police
Station jby Deputy Sheriff Hatch last
night. . * â¢
The . Supreme Court has granted the
"Deacon" a new trial, and he will be taken
to Ukiah this morning. | The trial will be
held In Judge McGarvey's court.
Oldham * was . arrested ; last \ July with a
man nan#d Snyder for holding up a Lake
port stage. Snyder was sentenced to eight
years and Oldham to twelve. ,
Oldham's friends have been assiduous in
their;' efforts to secure a- new; trial, and
were eventually successful.' {
â¢Oldham was a deacon in the Baptist
Church of Ukiah and held a high social
position in the town..; When he arrived at
the Central Station he had his Bible and

ous to cross the thoroughfare at that point,
and Mrs. Johnson, without looking about
particularly for any approaching vehicles,
started for the fruit-stall opposite.
She had made a number of purchases
from the stores in the vicinity, and as a
result her arms were full of bundles,
which, with the umbrella she was carry
ing, required all her attention. As a result
she did not notice the eastbound car until
just as she reached the far side of the
track. Then the startling alarm of the
jingling bell filled her with consternation.
Looking up she saw the green monster
bearing down on her at a frightful
speed. For a moment she was paralyzed
with fear. The horror of her situation
caused her to lose all presence of mind,
and in her confusion she turned and
started again across the track. By this
time the motorman was trying his best to
stop the car, but the momentum with
which the electric-cars rush along between
crossings is not to be checked in a mo
ment, and the unfortunate lady was
hurled to the ground.
The grating which , is supposed to pro
tect the front part of the car passed over
her body and the straight board fender
caught her in its grasp and she was
dragged cruelly along under its crushing
weight until the car was finally stopped.
Even then the poor woman', agony was
not at an end. The board 'had caught
her right leg and pinned her to â¢ the
ground. Efforts to extricate her caused
excruciating pain, and -.at . the suggestion
of the employes the " motor was reversed
â¢â ii' 1 the car was set in motion backward.
The agonizing shrieks.'of the victim in
stantly showed the futility ot this scheme.
The cries of the lady and, the efforts of
the car employes and the passengers to
relieve â¢her had by this time- attracted
quite a crowd. A* pile of lumber fortu
nately was near and a suggestion to pry
up the car was. put into immediate effect
and the sufferer was thus released. Word
was sent to the Receiving Hospital and an
ambulance was sent to convey the injured
lady to her home, which was only about a
block distant. When the matter was re
ported to the railway company's head
quarters they sent Dr. C. W. Card, one of
the company's staff, to ascertain the
extent of Mrs. Johnson's injury. A cur-,
sory examination convinced the doctor
that . the injuries - were . very _ serious.
Colonel Johnson was then notified and Dr.
Ragen was summoned;? 1 Mrs.' Johnson's
injuries were found; to consist of an ob
lique fracture of the right fermur, injury
to â¢ the right knee and contusions of the
face and right hand. -..., --"---;
"Mrs. Johnson's injuries are very ser
ious," said Dr. Ragen last evening, after
dressing: the broken limb. "Though we
have just set her leg she will undoubtedly
be a cripple for lite; The fracture is of
such a nature that the muscles will con
tract, and the leg will necessarily shorten."
. Mrs. Johnson was in great agony last
evening, and it will be several weeks be
fore she will be able to leave her bed.
EAGER TO RAISE RATES
Presidents of Four American
Insurance Companies in
This City.
â * ~ _. * 'â  â â¢ â Â;.-'-::â }
Possibility of the Plan to Abolish
S General Agencies Causes Much
.Uneasiness.
Presidents of four American fire insur
ance companies are now in San Francisco.
They are all said" to be making a close in
vestigation of â¢â  the demoralized local situa
tion, with the evident purpose of discov
ering just where the fire insurance business
is at. Several general managers and local
agents are in the same frame of mind
wondering where they, are at for a revo
lution, or something like it. is almost ex
pected to burst upon them at any time.
It; was common talk "on the street"
yesterday that the head officers were pre
paring to force the organization of a board
in San Francisco to maintain a standard
tariff of fire insurance rates. â ? ' A. :
Among the prominent insurance men in
town' are J. D.* Brown, president of the
Connecticut Company; Presidents v Snow
and Mitchell, of the Home and 'Phoenix
companies; the president of a Philadel
phia corporation; J. J." McDonald, general
manager of ; the: Continental's Western
office in Chicago, and his secretary, George'
E. Kline. Their presence,* coupled with :
recent,- developments, has caused- the in
surance -men to guess and think a great
deal. .' The â  Home j. and j Phoenix men are
said to be merely making? an annual visit,
out do, not; intend making any change in
the office; managed by Mr. Magill, who,
with the Continental people,' did the most
to br.ak" *up ~ the ~ old Pacific Insurance
Union and prevent the formation of a
new combine. ; # A: ~A~ik
The contracts were signed yesterday be
tween J. D. Maxwell and the Continental
Company giving him the local field after
May 1, on- "which date the San Francisco
general office will be abolished and all busi
ness of the company, on the Pacific Coast
will be transacted through : Chicago. ?, The
company i will retain all its agents, how
ever, on this coast and appoint others in
places not previously represented. 1 ytA:: :'-.
This does ? not mean that the ; fighting.
company will now unite with the rest on a
schedule of rates. -'
"On the contrary," remarked J. D. Max
well, "we shall fight' for "business stronger
than ever before. My instruction regard
ing the board is, 'Do not join any board if
the non-intercourse rule is to be enforced
or incorporated in the by-laws. ' "
r: The Phoenix of Brooklyn, now in the of
fice of Brown, Craig ; & Co., will after the
general agency is abolished go to Craig,
who will then become its local agent.
.This, plan *of withdrawing general con
trol of coast business from San Francisco
is viewed with misgivings by more than
one general manager, and by several in
surance clerks and brokers as well. It may
prove a complete success, because it will
obviate outlay in the salary of the general
manager, office rent, incidental expenses
and salaries of the office staff. Besides, it
will give the home office a new power over
rates, since the local agents are more easily
handled than general managers who have
full control. Ihe possibility of its adop
tion in other offices has created the un
easiness which ;is . apparent in insurance
circles. ?. . â ;.->,

The Woman Given a Light Sentence by
Judge Wallaceâ Her Plea for
Mercy.
Daisy Brown, or Daisy Cohen, was given
a light sentence by Judge Wallace yester
day. Tnat is, it was considered light by
her attorneys and herself. â¢ She was sent
to the penitentiary for three years, when
the statute says she could have gone for
fifteen. 7 â : -. - â¢c.trÂ«>/*>'-:- ; "'- W-- -.

She is the first woman to be convicted of

MRS. MARTIN INDICTED
Grand Jury Holds That the
Killing of Her Husband
Was Murder.
Dr. Stahle of the Hospital and : Con
tractor Greenebaum Visit
the Jury.
The Grand Jury met yesterday after
noon and indicted Susan B. Martin for the
murder of her husband, John F. Martin,
on March 30 last, 'ihe witnesses examined
by the jury were Dr. J. J. Fitzgibbon,
Minnie Lee, Fred Frey and Etta Mc-
Dcrmott. ..-:yAA^: K vA
A number of witnesses, directed by Law
yer E. P. Cole, told the Grand Jury about
the killing of Marrs, who was beaten so
badly during the recent strike of lathers,
that he died from the. effects of the in
juried inflicted upon him. The witnesses
in this case held that the Police Courts
and the newspapers ; stood in so much awe
of the power of .trades unions that strikers
might kill a man and beat others almost
to . death without fear of punishment or
public protest. yjy'i .;'._*-, \,\> ."...i, -
Another case, growing out of the strike
was heard by the jury. No indictment in
either investigation was fpund yesterday.
It was ascertained that the jury cannot
get direct testimony regarding the assault
on Marrs. . From the stories i told it ap
peared v that the victim was . a veteran
soldier, a worthy workman and a non
union man. It was demanded of him
that he should quit his job, which he re
fused to do as he had a family to support.
When he so refused he was assaulted by
ruffians and beaten so badly that he died.
The witnesses did not testify that he was
assaulted by union men. In fact the tes
timony did not clearly state who the, as
sailants were. In Judge Low's court one
of the gang was held . for manslaughter.
At the time of the assault the facts were
published. The Grand Jury will thoroughly
investigate the matter.
Dr. Stahle, superintendent of the City
and County Hospital, does not like. the
unceremonious' manner in which the
Grand Jury visited his institution some
days ago, and he is not at all pleased with
the style, and freedom with which The
Call has commented on the visit. He
courteously sought to enlighten the mem
bers of the Grand Jury yesterday in regard
to supplies, prices and incidents connected
with management of the hospital, but
the jury manifesting- indifference to the
degree discourtesy, kept him waiting until
4 o'clock. Dr. Stable could not remain
longer, and so had to go without the op
portunity of presenting his own side of the
case. - :s â â¢'â â¢'.-.' â ./.â â â  '.--â¢.' â ' ; -A.-ifiM':
Dr. Stahle explained to a Call reporter
that the average attendance of patients at
the hospital was 360 and the per capita for
their maintenance about the lowest in the
United States." The allowance of money
for the support of the institution was not
sufficient. Many articles on the schedule
supplied by contractors cost * more this
year than last. For example, last year
beef cost $4 21 ; j this year it is $6 65. Last
year soft coal was supplied at $5 40 j per
ton; now the charge is $7 74 per ton for
hard coal.' *
Another thing that riles the superin
tendent is the Â» refusal of Supervisor King
to sign requisitions , for . butter and eggs.
Kirshman & Co have a contract to supply
eggs at '20% cents a dozen, and Mau, Sadler
& Co. have the contract to furnish butter
at 15J_ cents - a pound. â ', King, it is said,
gives no reason for refusing to sign the
requisition, but is always ready to send to
the . . hospital a full delegation from the
First Ward. /.â¢ yyy
About the training school for nurses Dr.
Stahle says it was established four years
ago. * Some ten or twelve are on the pay
roll as /attendants at $10 a month, while
ten are in the probation class without pay.
Complaint is made that knowledge of
the Grand Jury's visit was : conveyed . in
.advance to Weaver of the* Aln?shou3e and
"concealed from â¢ Superintendent Stahle of
the hospital. Again, it is said of Commo
dore O'Connor of the jury that- he refused
to do more than look in at the door of the
engine-room and utterly refused to inspect
the laundry.- .-v. vy <â . ;;: ; v v
The Pacific Marine Supply Company has
the- contract for supplying the hospital
and Almshouse with . sugar.' Mr. Greene
baum. representing that. company, visited
the Grand Jury yesterday andy brought
forth from his overcoat pocket a sample of
the sugar supplied. 1 It was explained that
the ? allowance > lor sugar is light, and that
the' steward of the hospital, Mr. Robert-,
son, wanted a grade containing the great
est strength ?in sweetness.: The grade is
known as "sugar-house.!': It is an unre
fined' sugar, said ?to contain a marvelous
amount of saccharine matter, wholly free
from rice, stareh s and V other foreign sub
stances. Mr. Robertsop, an old caterer of
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, se
lected this particular grade of brown sugar
on account of- its far-reaching capacity to
impart sweetness to coffee and tea. â â â â ?â _ y
: Dr. Stahle explained that? sugar darkens
in contact with moisture, and that?: the
iquid from spoons made the: sugar in the
bowls ; black. r When i, the Grand Jury saw
the sugar it was black. *
â¢i, Commodore O'Connor avers that it is no
secret â not even a Grand Jury secret that
the sugar was' black and unfit for human
use. 1 Moreover, he resents tbe imputation
that he refused to inspect the laundry at
the hospital. \ ,; y - â .., â -â¢..::-.- â â¢
Mr. Greenebaum avers that he is willing
to supply the same sugar to the hospital

AN ENGINEER'S WOES.
Sued by His Wife's Aunt for a Board
Bill for His Spouse.
Justice of the Peace Carroll had an inter
esting case to decide yesterday when a
husband was sued by his wife's aunt for the
maintenance of his spouse for two months.
Several months ago Joseph Moninger, a
marine engineer, wedded the pretty niece
of Mary A. Turner, and for a time the
relations of the pair were those of turtle
doves, but dissensions finally crept in and
Mrs. Moninger became dissatisfied with a
husband who was much of his time at
sea, and left his bed and board and went
to reside with her aunt.
After she had remained there two
months the aunt sued Moninger for $50
for board of her niece.
The plaintiff claimed that the defendant
had agreed to. pay the board at the rate of
$25 per month, and, that though the
amount sued for had been demanded, the
engineer refused to liquidate. Moninger
in his? defense denied that he had guar
anteed nis wife's keep for more than a
week. â ?.'.'. A'- .:'';..:â  '- y' ;- â  'â¢,
Justice Carroll took the matter under
advisement in order to give the pair a
chance to patch up their differences and
resume the relations of man and wife.
Died From His Injuries.
Jens W. Sondrup, aged 42 years and a native
of Denmark, who was run over by a Kearny,
street car six months asro, died from the ef
fects of his injuries at his residence, 10
Steiner street, yesterday morning. The body
was removed to the Morgue and an inquest
will be held.

DR. BOHM MAKES
HIS STATEMENT.
Will Not Shield the Slayer
of the Abandoned
Infant.
MRS. BROWNING'S STORY.
The Mother of the Murdered
Babe Says Flynn Took
It Away.
MRS. SHANE PROMISED TO PAY.
The Prisoner Charged With Killing
the Childâ He Refuses to
Talk.
In this now famous case of the babe that
was left to die in a vacant lot on Twelfth
street, in which John T. Flynn stands ac
cused of murder, there were two very con
trary and conflicting statements made
yesterday.
The first and most important of these
was given by Dr. E. A. Bohm, who will
appear to-day as a most important witness
before the Coroner's jury. The second
statement was made by Mrs. Browning, at
the instance of Detective Gibson.
Hitherto Dr. Bonne has kept to himself
his knowledge of the crime, having made
up his mind to say nothing until his evi
dence was called for by the Coroner. But
yesterday to a Call man he made the fol
lowing statement.
As you related in to-day's Call 1 was called
to attend Mrs. Browning on the night of her
accouchment, and I did not see any of the
family afterward until the afternoon pf the
20th. I had been to the Morgue on that date,
where I met the Coroner and told him all I knew
regarding the case, and was proceeding down
Klntta street to visit a patient when 1 was ac
costed by Mrs. Shane on the sidewalk in front
of 130 Ninth street. She approached me
with the remark:
"Doctor, I called you by telephone the other
night, didn't If"
I replied that she had not called me by tele
phone, but that I had been summoned by the
two children of Mrs. Browning.
"Well," she said, "you can say that I called
you by telephone; I have already made that
statement to the detectives."
"But," -Bid I, '-I have already made a state
ment to the Coroner, and 1 will not change my
statement."
Mrs. Shane then said:
"Don't say anything about the case doctor.
They can't hurt me anyhow, because the baby
was alive when they found it. They found it
all out through Dr. Quigley. Ho asued me
what other physician I had called and I told
him that Dr. Bohm, my family doctor, was sent
for at the same time that he was called, and I
told him that if you had attended the case j
there would have been no publicity. 1 don't
tee why doctors can't keep their secrets any
how." . v.'./ ' ; - - â â â  y:
S_ j said she did not look at the baby, simply
wrapped it up in a towel and put it in a
drawer, but did not close the drawer.
I asked her if she remained with her sister
on the eventful night, and she said that she
had.
Just then Mrs. McVaughton, the wife of one
of my patients, came up and spoke to me, and
1 introduced her to Mrs. Shane. Before leav
ing the latter said: "Doctor, you need not
fear for your money. If I had the f5 now I
could give it to you.
"I did not know of the murder of the babe
until I read it in the papers. These facts as I
have told them to you I will tell to-morrow
before the Coroner's jury." concluded the
doctor, i
The name of John T. Flynn, the man
charged with the murder of the dead and
abandoned infant, was transferred . to
the big police book yesterday. The awful
word murder was at the other end of the
line.
This transfer may have been due to
Chief Crowley's becoming tired of having
the name of such an important prisoner
on the petty record, or it may have been
the result of the new and additional state
ment made by Mrs. Browning, the mother
of the sacrificed infant.
That statement, which is printed in full
below, was made at the request of De
tective Gibson in Mrs. Browning's house,
at 130>_ Ninth street, Thursday afternoon.
The accused man was seen late yes
terday afternoon, and after being in
formed of the nature of the statement he
declined to say anything until he had seen
his attorney, George A. Knight.
Mrs. Browning's statement made in the
presence of Detective Wren, Mrs. Shane
and her daughter Tessie was submitted to
Captain Lees by Detective Gibson, as fol
lows:
The evening I gave birth to the child I sent
my little boy with a note tc Flynnâ this was
about 7:30 m.â for him to call on me. He
came about an hour afterward, and suggested
that I send for his brother-in-law, Dr. Farnum,
and everything would be all right and he
would pay the bill. I told him that I did not
want Dr. Farnum ; that I had sent for my sis
ter, and that she would be there in a few min
utes. Flynn then said that he would go and
get some other doctor, and he sent for Dr.
Quigley.
After the child was born my sister and my
daughter wen out of the room on an errand
While they were goneâ this was about
12:30 to the best of my recollectionâ
Flynn came in and told me he had been
waiting downstairs- for quite a while. He
f.skcd me where the baby was and I told him it
was in the bureau drawer. The drawer was
partly open. He took .the baby out and
started to leave the room.
I asked him where he was going, and he
raid he would take the baby and put it in an
i-.sylum. He said the baby would be all right.
He never called on me again, and 1 have
never seen him since. When he took the baby
1 expected him to do as he said. He told mc
he would have to hurry up as there was a

Mrs. Shane and my daughter came back
shortly afterward and stayed with me the
balance of the night. The statement of Mrs.
Shane that she did not know Flynn Is correct,
as he was in the house one day when she
called and at his request I introduced him to
tier as Mr. Jones. He did not go out with my
daughter the night the baby was born that I
know. He has walked several times with me
to my sister's house on Larkin street, but l
never took him in the house. ' He gave me
$25 to give to _ physician prior to the birth.

WAGES FOR LUMBERMEN.
The State tabor Bureau Is Sending
Large Numbers of Men North.
Commissioner Fitzgerald of the Labor
Bureau is sending a large number of men
to the northern lumber districts, where,
he says, exceptionally good wages are
being paid.
In a few days he will have prepared for
distribution copies of his bill, framed for
the general alleviation of the laboring
men, which he purposes recommending
for passage at the next sitting of the State
Legislature.
''This bill," said he. "is the result of my
year's investigation concerning the condi
tion of the woricingman. -.
"It is intended to relieve the hardships
as they exist. I will distribute these
copies to the labor unions and to such
persons as are desirous of becoming in
formed on the matter contained in it. I
desire the laboring people to study it, and
if they do not consider it all that corre
sponds to their needs, why, of course, then
I do not expect it to be passed.
"It is a fact that for labor to oppose
capital is destructive to the best interests
of both. Capital and labor should go
hand in hand, and this proposed Dill is in
tended to relieve honest capital and honest
labor."
THE MAJESTIC SIERRAS
Joaquin Miller Addresses an
Audience on Mountain
Scenes.
"Gaze on These Views: Where God
Has So Elequently Spoken, What
Can Man Add?"
After ten year's meditation on "The
Heights" the "Poet of the Sierras" came
down with a message to the people, which
was delivered in his lecture in the Metro
politan Temple last evening under the
auspices of the California Camera Club.
"The Sierras" was the subject of the
poet's message, and the latent fire of po
etic imagination and fervor imbibed dur
ing his sojourn among the masterpieces of
nature burst into full flame as he waimed
to his description of the beauty and
grandeur of the Sierras and the Yosemite
Valley.
"Ah, my friends," he feelingly said as a
view of the Half Dome in the Yosemite
was projected upon the canvas, "how can
mortal man fittingly describe this? The
more I say the more ashamed I am of my
finite appreciation."
On views of Oregon Mr. Miller dwelt at
some length. Evidently he thought their
beauty admitted of more exact word
painting than those of the Golden State.
After the intermission and a soprano
solo, "Thou Art My Life," by Miss Millie
Flynn, the poet stood very still and said
not a word, as though the music had
wafted his mind off to the region where
nature reigns supreme. View after view
was projected upon the canvas, but still
he stood wrapped in thought. A member
of the club stepped upon the platform,
whispered in his ear and then he resumed
his seat.
"Ladies and eentlemen." said the poet,
very slowly, "1 have been advised to say
something. Gaze upon the majestic views:
Where God has so wondrously spoken,
what can man add?" r
When the last view had been flashed
upon tbe canvas the poet turned to the
crowded assemblage and speaking very
rapidly said :
"How 1 love to breathe the perfumed
air of the Sierras 1 The refreshing ozone
and the balmy odors of the pines and
aromatic shrubs infuse new life into a
man's worn-out frame. I am told that
these pine quills are gathered and shipped
to the far East, to the people of Massachu
setts and distant Maine, and there are
placed in pillows upon which sick persons
recline their weary heads and draw the
breath of life into their feeble lungs.
"My advice to you is to send your in
valids to the Sierras. It will amply repay
you for the expense."
"Sa's'parilla is cheaper," piped a shrill
voice from the gallery, and there ,was
general laughter from that part of the
house, but the poet paid no attention to
this unsympathetic and earthly interrup
tion. It is doubtful if he heard it at all.
The lecture was concluded amid generous
applause. â  â¢
The club is well pleased over the lecture.
The deep feeling displayed by the speaker,
and the gratification of the audience at the
mental treat, went far toward making the
managers feel amply repaid for their
trouble in securing the presence of the
gifted poet.

Carpenters Oppose Shinglers.
Carpenters' Union No. 22 j met last night In
the Odd Fellows' building and voted solidly
to oppose the request of the shinglers to be
allowed to join the Building Trades Council.
There are about thirty or forty shinglers in
this City known as such, and ? for some little
time they have attempted to obtain recogni
tion from the Building Trades Council, but so
far have been unsuccessful. a
The carpenters will give their big annual

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 1896.
STERNBERG IN
SAN QUENTIN.
He Gets Three Years on
One of Two Convic
tions.
MAY GET THREE MORE.
Proceedings Stayed in the Other
Case for the Time Be
ing.
i
A TECHNICAL POINT OF LAW-
The Prisoner's Conn sel Believes That
Sentence in Both Cases Must
Run Concurrently.
Shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing Judge Wallace called the case of Louis
Sternberg, convicted for the third time of
stuffing the voting register.
Ex-Judge Ferral answered for his client,
saying that he was ready to receive sen
tence. This was so unusual a performance
in the long line of those called for sen
tence, who uniformly beg for stays or
move for a new trial, that it instantly
quickened the already tense interest in
the case.
And Judge Wallace followed it with
I another unusual move. "I will announce
judgment in this matter at 12:30," he
said, and declared a recess until that
time, ''AK-.
The crowd that thronged the courtroom
all the morning to witness the disposition
of this and the other cases on the sentence
list did not all return in the afternoon.
A comparatively small audience was
present to witness the subsequent develop
ments in an odd situation. As Ferral pre
sented it, it was a Judge who really wanted
to see himself overruled in the Supreme
Court, a convicted felon anxious that his
conviction might stand and withdrawing
his plea for a further hearing.
The Supreme Court had affirmed the
judgment in the trial of the prisoner in
the Newman case and the remittitur had
only reached the lower court the day be
fore, and Judge Wallace had not had op
portunity to look it over. It was for this
that the recess was taken. There was a
point that was bothering the Judge the
same point that the counsel for Sternberg
had hit upon and was giving them
pleasure.
Sternberg was convicted some months
ago of unlawfully stuffing the polling lists
in Senator Mahoney's Forty-second As
sembly District during the registry period
preceding the last general election.
Judge Wallace sentenced him to three
years in the penitentiary. The case was
taken to the Supreme Court and judgment
was reversed and new trial ordered. â¢ & â¢
Sternberg' in the meantime had been
tried and convicted on another and sepa
rate charge of stuffingâ that of inducing
Dave Newman to register as a resident of
the district, his local habitation being also
cited as at the Baldwin Hotel. He was
convicted and sentenced to three years in
the penitentiary on this also. While this
case was pending before the Supreme Court
the first case, the Guttman case, which
the Supreme Court had reversed, was
tried again before Judge Wallace and again
a conviction was secured.
Yesterday the defendant came before the
court for sentence, and his counsel declared
they were ready, and withdrew their
motion for stays of proceedings.
Judge Wallace passed sentence of three
years in the penitentiary, saying at the
same time that he would stay the pro
ceedings in the Newman case for the
present.
Sternberg appeared in smiling form
during the proceedings, and as he was led
away by Deputy Sheriffs, he slapped ex-
Judge Ferral on the back saying : " "Good
by, old man,- take care of yourself."
Judge Ferral was also in apparent good
humor. He said: "Judge Wallace has
stayed proceedings in one case, but it
amounts to nothing, for sentence has
already been passed in that case, and it
must run concurrently with this last case.
~, "If he had withheld sentence in the one
case until conviction was secured in the
second case he then might have passed
sentence, in the one to take effect or begin
to run upon the expiration of the other,
and so send the man to. prison for six
years. As it is he goes over for but three,
although convicted in both cases. The
situation is a most unusual one. Judge
Wallace was really desirous of being re
versed by the Supreme Court in this later
ease in order that he might at another
conviction impose sentence in that way,
while we, the defendants, were anxious
that the Supreme Court might affirm the
judgment. At the same time we with
drew our plea for a stay of proceedingsâ a
convicted prisoner in other words is
anxious to go to prison; the trial Judge is
a'hxious to 'be overruled. |I do not have
this from the Judge but I make a guess in
that direction." , '.y-.y^
Assistant Attorney Black, who was in
court, expressed the same opinion that the
two sentences will run concurrently. The
belief is based on the reading of section 669
of the Civil Code, as follows:
When any person is convicted of two or more
crimes before sentence has been pronounced
upon him for , either, the imprisonment to
which he is sentenced upon the second or other
subsequent conviction must commence at the
termination of the first term of : his imprison
ment, to which he shall be adjudged, or at the
termination of the second term of imprison
ment, as the case may be. : *y â ;â â /â¢: i/_Â§*s_
The sentences run consecutively when
conviction has been secured upon ; two or
more crimes .V before sentence is passed."
Sentence having been passed in this case
upon the one conviction before the second
conviction was had, they argue that the
court cannot now stay the proceedings.
Judge Wallace thinks differently. Stern
berg *â â¢â  has ' already >> suffered 'â "â . seventeen
months' imprisonment in the County Jail.
TIRED OF HER HUSBAND.
Mary Mooney Think* Her Spouse 'Would
.Be a Better Man in Jail. 'â¢._â :â 
General McComb of the , Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to \ Children has a
very peculiar case on his hands. -â â â :'.'A:A
â  On Thursday last Mrs. Mary Mooney of
1118 Howard street asked for J the arrest of
her husband, John Mooney, for. failing to
support his : child. According to the Gen
eral it developed * later that her chief am
bition .was fi to i; get i rid of her ' husband,
though she was particularly averse to ap
plying for a divorce. .; y.
â¢ "My husbaud has done nothing for me
for thirteen years," she said to General
McComb, "and II want him locked up for
at least twelve ? months. $ I tried to get rid
of him 'â : once by sending him :to his old
home in Ireland, but his people? didn't
want him. He was sent back, and as be
fore has refused to do any work. â¢
? "Why don't I s get a divorce? i Well, I
suppose I don't care to, but just the same,
I would like to have him locked up for a
time. I believe if this was done he would
go to work as soon as he gained his free
dom." j* â¢ â "...-
j General McComb is somewhat perplexed
over the peculiar case, but said yesterday
that he would probably swear to a warrant
for the arrest of the husband on a charge
of failure to provide and drunkenness.
YOUNG GIRL MISSING.
Lulu Marquardt of Benicia, Visiting;
Friends Here, Suddenly Dis
appears.
James A. Maione, a deputy Sheriff of
Benicia, is in the City searching for 15
--year-old Lulu Marquardt. He has in
terested General McComb in the case,
and now a double quest is being made for
the missing girl. *
Six weeks ago Lulu Marquardt left her
home in Benicia on a few days' visit to
friends in this City. At the , expiration of
the allotted time she failed to returnlhome,
and inquiry developed the fact that she
had not been seen by the friends with
whom she was supposed to be stopping.
For some reason no regular search was in
stituted until yesterday, when Deputy
Sheriff Maione arrived.
The missing girl is said to be very pretty,
though her beauty is of a very peculiar
type. She is described as having very
light hair, an olive complexion ana very
dark eyes. Jyy A.- Ay -A'. Â
Mrs. Marquardt is a well-known lady of
Benicia. She fears that her daughter has
been induced to follow an evil life.
"BLINGUM" AFTER GLORY
Will Meet Riverside Polo Cracks
for the Coast Champion
ship.
Swelldom Has an Excellent Team to
Oppose the Englishmen of Southern
California.
What is virtually the polo championship
of the Pacific Coast, although not so called,
will be decided on the 7th and 9th of May,
when the heretofore invincible Riverside
team of Southern California will again
meet the cracks of the Burlingame Club
and try to defend the laurels captured
from northern swelldom last year.
The first game is to be played at San
Jose during the Santa Clara County Car
nival of Roses. The managers of the
flower fete have made arrangements for
the match on the 7th and will pay the
traveling expenses of the team from the
south, the members of which are the same
men who distinguished themselves in the
brilliant contest of last spring, when the
score stood 10 to 7 against Burlingame.
Bettner, the star player in that contest,
was formerly a resident of Boston, but like
his fellow-players, all of whom are English
men, he has been in Riverside for the last
five or six years defending season after
season the championship of Southern
California against the polo team of Santa
Monica. The two Maud brothers, Bettner
and Waring are the men who will ride
for Riverside. &Â£;**-??* ".
The Burlingame. Club has six excellent
players to choose a team of four from this
year. They are Lawson, Baldwin, Hobart,
the two Tobins and McCreary. It is the
present intention to arrange things so that
each of these men may play in at least one
of the two matches. Joe Tobin will not
play in the match at j San Jose, but will
content himself with defending nis club
on their own grounds, for the second game
is to be played at Burlingame. He said
yesterday that the Burlingame team is
playing better and harder this season than
ever before, and that there are more and
better polo ponies for the men to choose
from ; and as a result, he looked for a very
close contest with no advantage now for
either side. .-.,?/ .Ayy:.-,:y. .... ,
The rain will benefit rather than injure
the polo fields, a spongy, green field being
just what the riders want to prevent in
jury to their fleet-footed little horses.
It is probable that another polo contest
will come off at Burlingame a little later
in the season, between the Fourth Cavalry,
stationed at Walla Walla, Wash., and the
Burlingame team. These two clubs met
last year and the visitors from the north
were easily defeated. Â .; :
Polo is as yet a new game to Califor
nians, but for those who . have once seen a
good match the sport has all the intensely
exciting features of a closely contested in
tercollegiate football game* and the thou
sands here that have in the last few years
learned â¢ to appreciate what that means,
will know what a royal sport is being rap
idly developed so near home, and by a
team that stands an excellent chance* of
being hailed as the champions of the Pa-
Coast.

ALL THE CLUBS TO UNITE
Consolidation of All the Improve
ment Organizations in
the City.
FIRST MEETING NEXT MONTH.
Work Commenced on Folsom Street.
Outside Sections Demanding
Nesded Improvements.
The consolidation of all the improve
ment clubs in the City seems to be an es
tablished fact, and the 6th of May is the
date set for the first meeting of all the
delegates, when the permanent organiza
tion will be formed. _;'}.
It is expected that each improvement
club in the City will send a full representa
tion to this meeting, and that a central
body will thus be organized tbat will have
great weight in the matter of public im
provements all over the City.
Since the Mission district made its exist
ence known to the outside world through
its improvement clubs, streets heretofore
only known to the City at large on the offi
cial map have loomed into actual reality
and are beginning to ask tnrough their
residents a share of attention and a divi
sion of the distribution of the expenditure
of the public funds for improvements.
Since the Supervisors stretched a trestle
bridge across the railroad cut at Charles
street with . its intersection at French
street leading into Mission road on the
south side of the cut, Miguel street now
desires to be similarly honored by having
a street bridge span the railroad crossing
at its intersection with Ihirty-fourth,
two blocks further southwest of Charles
street bridge and leading directly into
Chenery street, where the San Francisco
and San Mateo electric runs. This bridge,
if built, would enable teams and pedes
trians to travel directly to and from Col
lege Hill and Fairmount without the
danger of being ground to nieces by the
trains which pass there at all hours of the
day and night. â¢
The Charles-street bridge in its present
position is almost useless in consequence
of that street not being graded through
into Chenery street on the north side of
the bridge. Again the street being only
thirty feet in width is practically unfit for
general traffic. To remedy this evil the
property-owners are considering the ad
visability of . deeding thirty feet to the
city, which will make the street sixty feet
wide.
To accomplish all these intended im
provements in the Eleventh Ward, as well
as many others, is the end and aim of the
General Club lately organized in that sec
tion. And if the organization does not
realize the highest plans that will not be the
fault of the members of the executive
committee.
A meeting, of the park and boulevard
committee of the Mission Improvement
Union was held at 609 Dolores street Tues
day evening, April 21. George Walcom,
D. A. Hulse, Daniel Kelly, J. H. Grady, J.
D. Daly and F. W. Van Reynegom were
present. The committee appointed Judge
Van Reynegom chairman and George
Walcom secretary. George Walcom and
Daniel Kelly were appointed a committee
to prepare a petition to present to the
property-owners of Dolores street and ob
tain their signatures to have Dolores street
converted into a boulevard.
: During the discussion upon the boule
vard matter it was argued in favor of the
proposition that as no part of Dolores
street was yet accepted by the City it
would entail no additional expense to
make it a boulevard, but that on the con
trary to do so would be an advantage to
the property-owners on the score of
economy.
The plan suggested for improving the
street contemplates reducing the sidewalks
to fifteen feet, to the same width as Va
lencia and Church streets. As the street
is 120 feet wide this would leave room to
reserve ten feet in the center of the road
way for planting ornamental trees and
provide a driveway of forty feet on each
side of the trees. : No changes of grade
would be necessary, and the continuous
line of trees from Market street to Thir
tieth would be a striking and attractive
feature of this important and growing
part of the City. Mr. Hulse remarked
that if the City could get the cemetery
blocks for park purposes such a boulevard
fronting upon the park would be a most
appropriate approach to the park, and
would increase the value ; of property all
along its line.
The secretary was instructed to com
municate with the' trustees of the two
Jewish Cemetery blocks at the Mission,
asking them to appoint a time and place,
before _ May 1, when they would meet a
committee of the : Improvement Union
consisting of George Walcom, John Grady
and Judge Van Reynegom, for conference
upon the matter of securing those blocks
for park purposes .â¢>; , .**r
The followirg circular was, on motion
of Judge Van Reynegom, ordered to be
printed and circulated among the prop
erty-owners on Dolores street: -

The undersigned, owners of property fronting

your Honorable Board to constitute Dolores street a bou-

vard the Supervisors will be asked to sub
stitute electric light for cas, thus having
the entire boulevard brilliantly lighted.
Even this, it is claimed, will be a saving
of $5 a block in the expense of lighting
that street, as one electric lamp at each
crossing does away with six gas lights on
Folsom street and the streets intersecting.
The notoriety and the beneficial results
thus far resulting from the consolidation
of the Eleventh Ward clubs have acted as
an incentive on other sectional clubs, and
a movement is now on foot to have a
union of clubs all over the City, this union
to hold a meeting on or about the 6th of
next month, at which representatives from
all organized improvement clubs will be
invited to attend. .... â¢*
WILBER'S STRANGE STORY
He Tells It After.Being Arrested
for Felony-Embezzle
ment.
Says Attorney Collier and His
Client Threatened Him With
a Knife.
E. D. Wilber, an advertising agent, was
booked at the Central police station yes
terday afternoon on a charge of embezzle
ment.
The charge was preferred by Attorney
Collier ol 14 McAllister street and had its
outgrowth in the refusal of the accused to
deliver up a note for $78 in his possession
to his former business partner, Frank
Clark. The note was made payable to
Clark, but Wilber refused to give it up un
til Clark agreed to secure his interest in
the amount named.
Wilber's statement imparts something
litre a sensational interest in the case. He
says he was decoyed to Attorney Collier's
office yesterday afternoon and there in
sulted and in every way provoked for the
purpose of getting him to make some vio
lent demonstration. / 7_y
"It was a vile scheme," he said, while
waiting for bail laA evening, "and if I live
I will have that man Collier debarred
from practicing in the courts. He and
Clark got me into the former's office and
tried in every way to induce me to fight.
Collier flourished a knife under my cnin in
a most threatening manner, and I expected
to eet badly beaten before I could get out
of the office. They locked the door as soon
as I entered.
. "Clark and I were ; in the advertising
business together, and the note for 78 was
as much mine as his. at least our interests
were identical. I offered to deposit the
full amount of the note as a token of good
faith until the difference between us was
adjusted, but instead of listening to me
he and his lawyer sought to get me in jail
on a charge of battery. Failing in that
they had me arrested for embezzlement. I
do not deny having the note and never did.
But you can rest assured I will have Col
lier disbarred." . y :
HAPPILY WEDDED.

capturing the opening event at odds of 15
to 1.
Of the many hard jolts the talent re
ceived during the day, Miss Maxim's de
feat by All Over was the most expensive.
The mare composed one of a trio that
started in the fourth race on the card, over
a mile, and with buteightv-nine pounds in
tbe saddle, opened in the betting at 1 to 2.
Notwithstanding the fact that it was all
that All Over could do to beat that ordi
nary performer. Doubtful on Wednesday,
he was very heavily backed to beat the
filly, his odds gradually being rubbed from
1)A to 1 to 8 to 5.
- The daughter of Maxim receded in the
betting to 7to 10. Thornhill was lightly
played at lengthy odds. The favorite, who
was cut off at the start, took the lead around
the first turn and set a very merry pace
to the stretch. Here she began tiring, and
on the journey to the wire was easily
beaten out by All Over in the fast time of
1*422,.
Realization, although a notorious mud
lark, has performed with such indifferent
success the past winter that neither the
stable nor the public took much stock in
him, and he went to the post at odds of 15
to 1 for the opening six-furlong dash. He
led throughout, and won easily, with Can
dor, a 5 to 1 choice, finishing in the place.
Mainstay, the even money choice, was in
terfered with soon after the start, and ran
unplaced.

the half mile scramble, but in a driving

and Lena, had to be ; content with third
place. Lost Girl, at 6 to lin the ring, got
the decision by a nose.
Another favorite was bowled over in a
seven-furlong decided over the inside
course. Decision went to the post all to
5 choice, but chased out in 'â¢ the lead with
Sea Spray and the chances of both were
ruined. Jack Richelieu, backed from Bto
4, took the command in the stretch, and,
ridden out, beat Monita a | length. Bea
Spray lasted long enough to get the show.
A first choice finally gained brackets in
the fifth race, a cheap five and a half furlong
selling spin. Backed down to a 13 to 5
favorite. Red Bird managed to shake
Myron off and beat him out a length at the
wire. Cardwell was a poor third, with the
others straggling in.
Midio, the Burns & Waterhouse entry,
was dropped into a soft spot in the last
race at the same distance as the race pre
ceding, and, after getting away none too
well, threaded his way through the bunch
and won by half a length from Jim Boze
man. The winner was heavily played at
odds of 13 to 10.
JUST A LITTLE FENCING.
The Lawyers in the Fair Will
Case Assemble and
Disperse.
The Demurrer to Paterson's Opposition
Only Partially Argued and No
Conclusions Reached.
The army of lawyers in the Fair will
case marched into court yesterday, and
then marched out again all except Del
mas & Shortridge. They were con
spicuous by their absence.
The business was the argument upon
the demurrer of the daughters of Fair to
the opposition of Paterson on behalf of
the minors, and with regard to this par
ticular matter Delmas & Shortridge dis
claim any interest. To be sure Lansing
Mizner was there to note the proceedings
in the interest of . Dr. Levingston, but the
demurrer is looked upon by the doctor
and his counsel as a side issue. -
J_x-Judge Paterson was a little tardy
and the last to arrive, and when he came
he stated to the court that he had, but
the day before, been served with the de
murrer to the amended opposition, and
that he desired at least a week to look
over it. 'Vv?
Mr. Wheeler said there were few new
points in the answer that would require
study. He said that he himself was ready
to proceed. ' ?â ?.
The court called attention to the absence
of Delmas & Shortridge, but Mr. Wheeler
said they were not interested in the busi
ness in hand. yyiAA
Wheeler then went on to run over the
points of the demurrer, and laid special
stress upon the incapacity of Paterson to
oppose the probate of the will of the 24th,
for the reason that his clients have no in
terest in his so doing.
Even if the one will give to his clients
$5000 and another will rive them $10,000,
said Wheeler by way of illustration, it did
not follow that he had a right to contest
the validity of the will that gave them the
lesser amount. It was for the court to
say which. was the real wiil on the facts
presented in the ex-parte presentation of
them. But in this case, he said, the clients
of Paterson were best served in the later
will â the will of the 24th gave them more
than did the will of the 21st. "I take it,
therefore, that the court will not allow
this contest to proceed simply because the
minors see fit of themselves to contest."
Then ho proceeded to his strongest
point that the children ,of Andrew and
William Fair, for whom Judge Paterson
appeared,' have no interest, because the
interest of their parents intervenes. The
will provides that a certain portion of the
estate shall go to the brothers of James G.
Fair, and after that to their children.
There was no allegation that William or
Andrew is dead, and consequently, he
held, their children had no interest.
The other objections were technical;
that the allegation as to the republication
of the will of the 21st was not supported
by facts or allegations of facts, etc.
It was evident that Garret McEnerney
took a seat beside Judge Paterson and con
sulted and advised with him during the
entire proceedings. Mr. McEnerney repre
sents W. 8. Goodfellow and the trust will.
Mr. Paterson said he did not wish to go
into a full answer to Mr. Wheeler at this
time, but he thought the latter's points
were not well taken. He contended that
he (Paterson or his clients) opposed the
will of the 24th because he believed it was
not only not the last will of James G.
Fair, but was no will ; that the will of the
21st was the last will, "and that we take
under it." as Mr. McEnerney suggested
sotto voce. -.;â â¢- â¢
"When all the parties get their interest,
if they ever shall," said Judge Paterson,
'in the judgment roll that is made up on
this document, the will of the 24th will be
found first disposed of, and it is our place
to put ourselves right upon it; that is why
we present our opposition." .
Mr. Paterson asked that further consid
eration of the matter go over for one week.
The court asked for more light on the
proposition as to the interest of the chil
dren of Andrew and William Fair as Mr.
Wheeler had presented it. The court said
he did not see much in the other points.
Judge Paterson said that if the will of
the 24th was to be considered at all, there
was no question as to their interest. He
would be able to enlighten the court if a
little time were given. The cdurt then
held the matter over for another week.
GHIRARDELLI FREE.
I The Prosecution Had No Evidence to
Connect Him With the Varni
Murder.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 24.â Michael
Ghirardelli, who was charged with the
murder of Felice Varni in the foothills
back of Elmhurst, on December 1, 1895,
was acquitted by a jury to-day without
their leaving their seats. The case has
been on trial a week, but the District At
torney produced no more evidence than
was had before the Coroner's jury, which
refused to charee any one with" the crime.
When he rested to-day the defense re
quested Judge Greene to instruct the jury
to acquit, which he did.
After the Coroner's inquest Detective H.
V. Herbert swore to a complaint charging
Ghirardelli with the crime. At the pre"
liminary examination one witness testified
to seeing the body at 9:30 on the day it
was found by a Deputy Sheriff, while
another swore he had seen Varni , alive, at
11:30 the same day. The gun expert also
testified that the shells found on the
ground near Varni could have been fired
only from Devencenzi's gun.
Justice Clift held him for trial, how
ever, but when the same testimony was
presented in " the Superior Court the Dis
trict Attorney said he was surprised and
would have to agree to an acquittal. Judge
Greene told the jury it was optional with
them to disregard his? suggestions .or not.
He, however, desired to suggest to them
that they return a verdict of not guilty,
which he would have suggested had not
the District Attorney consented. They re
turned such a verdict and the defendant
was set free.
The case of * Devencenzi and Lazaretto,
who are also held on tbe same charge, is
set for next Tuesday, and it is very prob
able that it will not be pressed.

SHOULD SET VERDICTS ASIDE.
Some Interesting Comments on the
Court as the Thirteenth Juror v
in a Trial.
â  Judge Sanderson has added something
to the comments which appeared in The
Call some weeks ago on the rights of a
Judge to interfere in the verdict of a jury.
. Judge Sanderson's comments are em
bodied in an opinion scaling down a ver
dict rendered in a suit against the Exam
iner for libel. E. J. Mize was put; out of
Judge Conlan's Police Court two years
ago, and the Examiner printed an article
in which he was described as a crank and
evidently insane. He sued for libel, and
the jury gave him a verdict of $1500. This
Judge Sanderson believes excessive, aad
he has ordered a new trial unless the
plaintiff will remit $1350 of the amount.
In rendering bis opinion Judge Sander
son gives his view of the position of the
Judge and his power, over a verdict. He
says: ; y :; jJ: '. ; ,__ . y .â â  â ,-, - 4
A verdict which plainly appears, to have
been rendered under the influence of passion
or prejudice, or which is clearly unreasonable
ought not to be permitted to stand.
When a trial Judge entertains these views of
the verdict of a jury it is his plain duty to
grant a new trial, or modify or reduce the ver
dict to a certain sum, in order that the parties
may settle same, if they, mutually, elect so to
do, in accordance with the terms fixed Dy the
trial Judge, and thereby end further l(tiâa
tion. . â  â â¢-â â â¢ â 
This supervisory right of the trial Judge over
the verdict of a jury is based upon sound rea
son and upon a rule of law universal, so far as
I am advised, in the several States of our
Union. It is a rule which has been repeatedly
declared by our Supreme Court, its first clear
est expression being found in the civil case of
Dickey vs. Davis. 39 Cal. 565, and its latest
expression, probably, in the criminal case of
People vs. Knutte, tried by Judge Bahrs, in
another department of the Superior Court of
this City and County (vol. 11, page 711 Cal
Decisions Supreme Court). . ' ...â 'â â 
1 would not take either the time or the
trouble to discuss this matter here, were it not
for the fact that the rulings of both the trial
and the Supreme Court, in this case of People
vs. Knutte just cited, have been the subject of
much recent adverse criticism in the public
prints of our State, under the Impression
probably, that this was a novel and dangerous
doctrine, and in which some members of the
bar participated. No person, though, be he
lawyer, layman or newspaper man, who will
take the trouble to investigate this subject,
will find this rule either modern or vicious
and no right-thinking person will, in my judg
ment, ever wish to see the rule abrogated
which confers and imposes upon the trial
Judge the right of the duty of interposing and
exercising his power as a Judge whenever
the life, liberty or property of a citizen is
menaced, impaired or invaded by the er
roneous or unjust verdict of a jury.
The court critics denounce this as new law
and dangerous doctrine. It is neither. It is as
old as the history of jury trials in this repub
lic, and consistent with reason and simple
justice. Certainly no trial Judge in a criminal
case would allow a person whom he thought
innocent, or who was convicted on insufficient
testimony, or on testimony he believed to be
perjured, to be punished by the erroneous or
unjust verdict of a jury. The same is equally
true of verdicts in civil cases. No trial Judge
would or should permit a person to be des
poiled of property, when he believed a jury
had based their verdict on false or insufficient
testimony. Subject, of course, to have his
judgment set aside, on appeal, ii it be shown
that he has abused his discretionâ which is
rarely done. The trial Judge is the final ar
biter In jury cases as well as those tried with
out a jury. As shown above, this should be
done, in common justice to all litigants, other
wise, improper and unjust verdicts would op-
Dress the losing party and there would be no
relief therefrom.
Unquestionably the province of thejurvis
to find the facts in dispute. They are likewise
to pass "upon the value and effect" of evidence.
Their judgment, though, is not arbitrary and
conclusive. They are to exercise sound and
reasonable discretion. If their verdicts rest
upon such reason and discretion, then atrial
Judge rarely, if ever, disturbs their verdicts,
and under such circumstances he certainly
should never do so.
â¢ It is said that if the Judge have the power to
set aside or modify verdicts at his pleasure,
then the people might as well dispense with
the expense and inconvenience of jury trials.
This sounds plausible, particularly in this day
and age, when Judges are elected, as with us,
by the people, instead of being appointed by
the crown, as in times past. But trial by jury
is of great antiquity, and an important part of
the machinery of our judicial system, which
our people, it is highly probable, will never be
willing to part with, since it guarantees a deci
sion as to the facts in dispute, both in civil and
criminal cases, by neighbors of the parties in
interest. -".,...
Theory is one thing, but practice often de
molishes its application. Though the rule in
this State be as elsewhere, that the trial Judge
must in the end decide whether the verdict of
the jury shall stand or be set aside, vet it is
only in rare cases, and those of the plainest,
where the jury has given an erroneous or un
just verdict, that the trial Judge interferes.
This department of this court may be aptly
cited in corroboration of this statement. For
the past five years and upward this depart
ment has almost exclusively engaged in the
trial of jury cases and mostly for damages, and
during that time hundreds of cases, I may say,
have been tried by juries, and yet only in one
case have I granted a new trial, and in only
four or five cases, and this among them, have
I modified their verdicts. The jurymen ac
cepted to try these cases have been men of in
tegrity and good sense, and their verdicts
mainly based upon logical deductions that
might with reason have been drawn from all
the evidence submitted to thorn.
Doubtless if these cases had been tried by
the court, without a jury, the damages given
in some of them perhaps in , many of themâ
might have been for other and different
amounts, either greater or less, than those
given by the jury in these same cases, as the
weight, value and effect of the evidence given
might have impressed or persuaded the court
differently ; than it did the jury; but that
would be no good cause to disturb the verdirt
of the jury, when there was any reasonable
view of the evidence on which to support the
verdict. Most of the verdicts â¢ rendered by
juries for damages are the result of a compro
mise ol diverse though honest views enter
tained by the individual twelve jurors. Jury
men, as well as judges, differ and doubt, but
their verdicts and decisions are in the main
founded on some reason, more or less cogent
and convincing, and as correct as can reason
ably be expected from finite beings who must
hear conflicting evidence, deduce conclusions
and render conscientious decisions therefrom.
THE VALLEY ROAD.
Agent Young: Tells New. Things About
It and the Public School Su- y ; V
' perintend ':
C. S. Young, of the real estate firm, of
Young & Lang, is now in charge of right
of-way matters of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley ' Railroad Company.
Yesterday he left for Fresno to enter upon
his dutiesâ securing the : right of way be
tween Fresno and Bakersfield. 'With three
or four exceptions, where condemnation
suits are necessary,. the right of way has
been secured as far as Fresno.
A, Call reporter saw Mr. Young before
he started south'.
, Mr. 1 .Young ? said: "The company will
have a policy beyond Fresno, â¢â -;â¢; Up to
the present time the people have known
just where the company would build the
road ; hereafter and south of , Fresno the
disposition of the , people shown in the
subsidies offered and the : rights of way
given will have much to do in shaping the
policy of the company relative to the line
to be accepted. '. r ?y v â¢ :? ' *'.y
"Notwithstanding the great popularity
of ..President' Spreckels and his associates
among the people of San Joaquin Valley
the 'stand and deliver' i. methods and
'cinch.* game on the part of * many of the
land-owners have i given h the ; company a
great deal of trouble and caused serious
delays. '/ Beyond Fresno it will be required
that to secure the line the right of- way
must be given free of charge, and 'â  other
special inducements offered on the part of
the people.".
It is expected" that the railroad will be
completed to Fresno, a distance of 125
miles, by the middle of August, and mean
while Mr. Young will have plenty of time
to ascertain the sentiments of the people
along the line between Fresno and Bakers
field and report to the company what line
should be adopted.
When . asked ? whether or not he had, as
had been reported, given up his fight for
School Superintendent of San Francisco,
he replied, "Why, of course not."
"With due deference to Judge Troutt and
his judicial opinion, I have the same
high regard for the opinion of my attor
neys, Messrs. Estee, Cross and -Watt, that
I had before the decision was rendered
from the ;â¢* bench. .It is a ques
tion of constitutional and statutory law
and not one of fact sifted out of conflicting
testimony of witnesses; hence the Judge
on the bench has no advantage in the
way of information over any other lawyer.
Our brief was filed in the Supreme Court
long ago, but as yet Babcock's attorneys
have not answered, and it is evident that
their policy is one of long delay." v . \y=
"Is it true, as reported by an evening
paper, that you are to come before the
people again this election for this posi
tion?"
"One fight at a time is quite enough. As
I have already intimated, I expect that
the decision of the Supreme Court will be
that lam now the legally appointed Su
perintendent of Schools. At present lam
not in politics, but am attending strictly to
business and the best interests of the Val
ley road." ' â¢â â â â¢' '? - -' â  'â  ' â¢
FOLDED THE GERMAN FLAG
The San Francisco > Schuetzen
Verein Will Carry It
No More.
At Its May. Festival the Vere ; Will
First Appear With the Cali
fornian Emblem. -
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein has
determined to fold up its time-honored
German banner and to keep it as a
memory. And henceforth the bear flag of
California will be carried instead of the
emblem of the fatherland beside the stars
and stripes.
For thirty-six years the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein has held a May festival
and always with good success. With
every recurring May fete of the verein the
beautiful red, white and black silk flag
floated above the marching sharpshooters
and was planted over the scene of their
festivities, always sharing the honors with
the United States emblem.' This coming
May festival of t he shooting verein will be
marked by an innovation in flags, for the
banner of California will take the place of
the German one.
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein is
the only independent military company in
California that did State service. When
Lincoln was assassinated it acted as a
guard at Montgomery and California
streets, at the old Alta office. Its duty
was to preserve peace and to protect prop
erty, which it performed faithfully. Until
the Franco-Prussian war the company was
satisfied with the American flag, but then
it first carried the German emblem. Nor
was this banner ever relinquished till Ihe
recent law regarding independent military
companies went into effect.
This law provided that independent
companies could not turn out with arms
without having first received permission
from the Governor of the State. 3
The Schuetzen Verein received permis
sion from Governor James H. Budd to
parade under arms on condition that it
would not do so with the German flag.
The alternative was gladly accepted, and
the old flag has been hung up in the
armory at California Hall as a memento
of days gone by. '
"To show our feeling in the matter,"
said a member of the company yesterday,
"we have got a fine flag of the State with
its bear and emblems of the California
republic. It is our intention to turn out
as Americans with Old Glory and the
California bear flag hereafter. Our first
outing with the new flag will be on the
occasion of our thirty-seventh* May festi
val at Shell Mound Park next month. We
are unanimous on thisâ that we are all
Americans and proud to carry these
banners."

We can make no leaps in growth, either physi
cally, intellectually or morally.â Rabbi Elkin,
Hebrew, San Antonio, Tex.

God pity the man who has a fool of a mother!
To have a foolish father is bad enough, but a
foolish mother is a positive calamity.â Rev.
M. C. Peters, Independent, New York City.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Civil service is a question of morals, and not
a political issue. It differs greatly from the
tricks and trade of the partisan politician and
is a moral element ln governmental policy.â
Rev. W. M. Welch, Methodist, Tacoma, Wash. ;
BOARDING-HOUSES.
The meanest place on earth, outside of jail,
in which to bring up one's children, is the
average boarding-house. There is in nearly
every one a group of gossips who -pry into
everybody's business.â Rev. V. D. Talmage,
Presbyterian, Pittsburg, Pa.
UNSATISFIED.
Our hearts tells us that we were made to be
satisfied, and this life never quite satisfied us.
The one unsatisfied being on the earth is man,
because he v belongs to another world.â Rev.
T. G. Dowling, Baptist, Brooklyn, N. Y.
PRAYER. ; i,',;.':.
There is an educational power in prayer. It
brings blessing into the heart; new power and
new life comes into the soul when communing
with God.- Prayer has more power than sing
ing or instrumental musicâ J.R. Sampey,
Baptist, Lewisville, Ky.
HEAVEN.'
The Bible has little to say about heaven. It
is rather occupied with the earthly life of the
Christian. But the few thoughts in the Bible
about the other life are full of comfort and in
spiration.âRev. W. P. Merrill, Presbyterian,
Chicago, 111.
POLITICAL PURITY. .
The church stands for law and Order and
righteousness, therefore it has a right to shed
lightâ light of Scripture of divine truthâ
upon the dark retreats of political wirepullers
and political wickedness.â Rev. G. W. Ridout,
Methodist, Philadelphia, Pa.
FRUITS OF CHRISTIANITY.
A man is "judged by his works," and the
Christian religion by its fruits, by the upright
men and noble women, by the martyrs and
saints it produces, and, lastly, it is judged by
its enduring powers.â Rev. Father Kershaw,
Catholic, Charleston. S. C.
MYSTERIES.
We live amid an environment of wonders;
we have touched so many mysteries, we have
seen so many things done which we solemnly
thought could not be done, that no man knows
their limitations or can measure their po
tency.â Rev. Asa Saxe, Universalist, Rochester.
N. Y. -
MAN. .'
In our attempt to solve the riddles of the
universe we must be governed by our reason,
and we can see nothing higher than man. He
may be enlarged, purified, developed, but
tnere can never be anything higher" conceiv
able to us.â Rev. Lyman Abbott, Congregation
alist, Brooklyn, X.Y.
DEEDS, NOT CREEDS.
To have a correct faith is one thing, but a
correct life is better. The creed time is passed
and the deed time is here. A higher life, a
purer spirit, are, among other things, imperi
ously demanded in our age of boasted culture.
âRev. C. S. Lucas, Christian, Allegheny, Pa.
\ TOO MUCH GOSPEL.
There are men who have heard the Gospel so
long that it has become second nature. They
have heard it I*o frequently that the divine
grace makes 110 impression on them, when the
hearts of others beat faster by reason of the
touch of divine love.â Rev. Dr. Pratt, Baptist,
Rochester, N. Y. ...
?:?.; ; CONVERTS. y .
When I get a fellow mad enough to abuse
and curse me I expect to baptize that fellow.
It's the man who wraps himself up in gentle
manly culture, never gets mad . and treats you
so kindlyâ he is the man that is the hardest to
reach.â Rev. A. C. Dixon, Baptist, Raleigh, N. C.
JESUS. ,
The whole life of Jesus was beautiful, and
such a life as only a divine being could live.
His miracles were those which only God could
perform, and in them, while in the mortal
flesh of man, he proved he was at the same
time God.â Rev. George T. Mahoney, Catholic,
Woonsocket, R. I.
ASPIRATION.
God created man with certain aspirations,
and all the aspirations of the soul are not
satisfied by anything on this earth. No mat
ter how great the honors are that a man may
acquire, it will not fill out the aspirations of
the man's soul that God has implanted there
in.âRev. Father Burice, Catholic, Austin,
Minn. ..' "*
THE LAW OF GOD.
Life is the stamp of the unseen on the seen.
Men have been seeking for the origin of life in
"spontaneous generation" and combinations
of dead matter, but why seek for the living
among the dead, for that life comes only from
life is the law of nature, or, better, the law of
God.â Rev. D. F. Pierce, Methodist, Rome, K. Y.
MOHAMMEDANISM. '
- Mohammedanism possesses some good fea
tures. Its fundamental doctrine is the unity
of God, and in that respect it is far ahead of
the polytheism of paganism. Another good
point is its religious prohibition of intoxicat
ing liquors. In consequence, there is not a
sin_le saloon in the world kept by a Moham
medan. âRev. B. â C. Bedickian," Methodist,
Pittsburg, Pa. â¢
PATRIOTISM.
Patriots are not made by parade and fustian,
by impassioned applause of stock jingo senti
ments and superstitious obeisance to any sym
bol. The roots of true patriotism are the prin
ciples of honor, manliness and justice. To
cultivate these in the public school is of more
value than to raise the flag over it.â Rev.
Frank Crane, Methodist, Chicago, 111.
LIFE.
Life is in no man's hand, and it is nonsense
to talk of taking it in the hand. It is sacrilege
to seek even to touch it. The suicide cannot
approach it; the microscope cannot, explain
it; it comes and goes at the beck of a viewless
hand and an irresistible power.â Wallace
Nutting, Congregationalist, Providence, R. I.
IMMORTALITY. *';5
Man's life needs immortality to complete it.
A single span is too short to realize the fruit of
honest endeavor, and heaven, with its com
pletion and perfection, fits on to tnis life with
its inadequary and imperfection. The spirit
ual is the natural blossom upon the natural ;
the celestial is the fruit of theterrestial.â Rev.
H. P. Dewey, Congregationalist, Concord, N. H.
. , . CHRIST.
By imitating the perfect example of Christ
we can become Christianlike. The sinlessness
of Jesus is a perfect model of daily conduct for
all men to imitate. The perfection of this
Divine Man, as a model, is molding every true
Christian and every civilized nation. The
holiness of the character of Jesus Christ is the
moral and spiritual magnet of the universe.â

IMMORTALITY.; -? â
\ Conscience mysteriously points; toward im
mortality. A future life for man is required to
vindicate God's character as moral ruler of the
universe. -Tne argument from design and the
innumerable proofs of the benevolence of God

Captain Benson's Statement
A REMARKABLE AND INTEREST
ING CAREER.
_____
A Member of the First Kentucky Bat
tery Who Was in Twenty-Seven
Hard-Fought Battles and
Taken Prisoner at
Anderson ville.
From the Capital-Journal, Salem, Or.
Salem, Oregon, can boast of no better known
private citizen than Captain William Benson.
To the old residents, as well as to the school
children, his figure is as familiar as that of
Mt. Hood or the State Capitol.
Captain Benson of the First Kentucky Bat
tery, detached from the One Hundred and
Twelfth Illinois Infantry, is now 74 years old,
and has taken part in twenty-seven hard-fought
battles, besides a great many interesting skir
mishes. He is pensioned for injury in the
breast, from concussion of a shell, and for a
wound in the right shoulder, caused by leaping
from a car while being taken as a prisoner
from Andersonville to Pine Forest For the
past twenty years he has suffered almost
continually from malaria and shortness
of breath, and has been afflicted with
rheumatism in the legs and shoulders to such
an extent that he had not seen a well day in
all that time. He was also afflicted with con
stipation and piles. Eighteen years ago Mr.
Benson removed from Illinois to Oregon on
account of his failing health, and since the
close of the war has not been able to support
himself by manual labor and has had almost
constant medical attendance by physicians of
all the different schools of practice. To see
him now, tipping the scales at 210 pounds,
enjoying regular health, his cheeks mantled
with a fresh, rosy complexion, walking off
proud and erect, with a fresh, firm, vigorous
step for a man in his seventy-fourth year, is
enough to make one believe in the possibil
ity of Ponce de Leon's fabled Fountain of
Youth. â 'â¢.â¢â ;â¢â â ;â :â¢.
Captain Benson is not only a hero of the
Civil. War, but a man worth considerable
property. He says he would part willingly
with his interest in all his earthly posses
sions rather than be placed back in the de
bilitated condition where he lingered for a
score of years.
"I suppose," said he, laughing, "that what
you are after is an advertisement for Pink
Pills, but I want to say that I am very glad to
give you this testimonial, as I am convinced it
will relieve a great deal of suffering if it can
become widely known. I_m firmly convinced,
alter an experience of over fifty years with
both patent medicines and physicians, that if
every family could keep these Pink Pills in the
house they would never need a doctor.
"I have paid out over $1000 for doctoring
with the best physicians at Salem, but not a
cent for myself since a year and a half ago. It
was then that I first heard of Pink Pills. I got
the first box at a drugstore, and had not much
confidence in them when I began to take them.
I took one box before I got much benefit, but
by the middle of the second box the pain in my
breast began to disappear, and the rheumatism
in my shoulder went away. The shortness of
breath was alleviated, and i began to sleep like
an intant. For the first time in twenty years I
realized the luxury of sound sleep, and my sys
tem began to recuperate.
"By the end of the third box it had taken
away all my rheumatism and stiffness in the
muscles and joints, and I began to feel as nim
ble as a boy, and could do as good a day's work
as ever, but for my wounds. I enjoy the best
health I ever enjoyed in my life. My natural
weight increased from ten to twenty pounds.
My flesh is solid and my skin is clean and fresh
as a baby's. I had tried every remedy under
the sun for piles, but without relief. At times
they were near killing me. Sciatic rheumatism
had laid me up in bed for months at a time.
Pink Pills have cured all these things, and I
have not felt an indication of piles or rheu
matism for eight months. People* who see me
now cannot believe that I am the same man.
My face looked drawn, my eyes were blood
shot, my skin was scurvied, and I could not
have had a worse appearance if I had under
gone starvation on an Arctic expedition. I
can now eat whatever I have a relish for, and
all I want of it, and it don't hurt me.
"I used to be constipated continually, and I
have taken wheelbarrow loads of other pills,
but never got perfect relief until I tried Pink
Pills. I am now taking two pills a week, and
sometimes I go without them for a month, and
as I said I enjoy continuous good health. I
have got rid of rheumatism and everything
else. Pink Pills perform wonders. They go to
work and fix up the kidneys and back ana the
whole system. Three days after first taking
them you feel the effect all over. The worst
trouble with me was I had got so I could not
remember anything. My mind was clouded.
A month after I began taking Pink Pills I first
began to notice my mind become clear and ac
tive, and my memory is perfectly restored, a
happy change from the feeling of stupidity I
had suffered. This medicine has fixed me up
and made a new man of me. It is only the
other day that Dr. Reynolds, Dean of the Salem
Medical College, remarked to me that I was
looking hale and hearty. I said, Yes, and no
thanks to you doctors. It is Pink Pills that
have done it. I He poohhooed at it. But I know
what I am talking about, and he had to admit
what I said." (Signed) Wm. Benson. â

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The stormy weather of the past few days
has placed a ' heavy damper on many out
door sporting events, which were booked
for the near future.
The wheelmen have been completely
knocked out. The runs slated for to-mor
row â and they were manyâ have been
postponed until the return of favorable
weather.
The athletes of Stanford and Berkeley
universities will meet this afternoon at the
Olympic Club grounds, and if the weather
is at all favorable, some splendid perform
ances will be recorded.
The much-talked-of baseball match be
tween teams representing the University
club and University of California will be
contested this afternoon at Central Park.
The very latest news concerning angling,
rifle and trap shooting, coursing, yachting,
rowing, handball, cycling, boxing and gen
eral athletics will be found under their re
spective headings.
THE WHEELMEN.
The Associated Clubs' Decision In
Relay Trouble Is Satisfactory.
Judging by the vote which was cast, 45
to 2, a more satisfactory or nearly unani
mous decision could hardly be reached
than that which . was rendered by the
board of governors of the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs Thursday night,
when they decided that the Bay City
Wheelmen had not violated the rules of
the relay race, and therefore overruled the
decision of the referee, at the end of the
sixth station, I. Percy Mills. The two
negative votes were cast- by Joseph A.
Dcsimone and S. G. Tompkins of the Gar
den City Cycler., and the former when
voting arose and apologized for his vote,
stating that he only cast it that way be
cause he felt in duty bound to sup
port the referee; only, however, because
he was a member of his own
club. When it came to deciding
the question as to whether' or not the Bay
City Wheelmen, had violated the rule re
quiring riders to belong to a club sixty
days before the race, when it put J. C.
Williamson and C. A. Kraft on its team,
the vote was loud and unanimous in favor
of the club, and the motion incorporated
in it a clause that it was the sense of tbe
meeting that the Bay City Wheelmen had
won the relay race of 1896 in a fair, sports
manlike manner, and were entitled to the |

Saturday May 2, and at the Fabiola floral

the bicycle racing concerns these two fetes
both are National circuit dates and should
attract the best riders and be of particular
interest. After these meets the circuit
will go to San Jose on May 9 and will be in

j cracks are now there, and the Fountain

j ance afternoons. - Coulter, the big Olym
pian, will start with the circuit here and

j shape now and. wili lead the percentage

Chris F. Ecklon is regarded among the
! wheelmen of Sacramento as one of the
| best road riders in the State, and they
| hope to be able to say the same of him for
j his track riding. He is 22 years of age and
weighs 196 pounds. On the road he rides
a whesl geared to 120. He is all bone and
brawn, with good wind and wonderful
staying qualities, and has the making of a
crack rider .; in him. In the matter of
speed he has to contest with him in his
own county such men as Young, Welsh,
\ Smith, Paine, Hubert, Pope, Leach, Upson
and Headman, and to beat such men as
these be has to be pretty fast.
The Alameda Cyclers had a run called
for to-morrow to Centerville, but Captain
Oodd wisely postponed it one week. - Next
Monday evening the club will install its
! newly elected officers with much ceremony

. Watch any half dozen cyclists as they
pass and you will see that five of them do
' not know how to pedal properly. If they
had but a slight Knowledge of the proper
, method of foot motion, with the same cx
i penditure of power they could accomplish
! far greater results. ?Ai.sll
' The art in pedaling is to push the pedal
I more than naif the circle, taking care to
| lift the foot immediately it has done its
effective work, so as not to burden the
\ rising pedal. This necessitates the drop
; ping of the heel at the top of the stroke,
| which helps the crank over the dead cen
j ter, pushing right down to the bottom of
j the stroke and bringing the foot back with
i a clawing motion to get over the dead cen
; ter at the bottom. If a rider, who has
i been content with a piston-like up and
i down pedal motion, will try this slowly at
first he will be surprised after a little
j practice to find that the machine does not
require nearly so much pushing as it used
to; especially in hill climbing will he dis
| cover its advantage, while the ankle mo-
tion involved will be particularly beneficial,
Nothing brings on fatigue so much and
so quickly as riding in one position. A
change of posture occasionally relaxes
certain muscles and brings others "into play,
making it possible to accomplish greater
results or to return from a journey with
out being all used up.
Fatigue at the wrists may be relieved by
chance of grip so as to catch the handles
with the palms up, also by raising or
lowering the shoulders so as to change the
angles at which the wrists are bent. This,
as well as changing the grip, will relieve
pain on the outer side of the arm but the
practice of leaning on the arms, throwing
all the weight on the handles is a poor
one at best. The rider's weight should be
distributed between the saddle and the
pedals, with just enough thrown onto the
handles to keep his balance; and while
riding with the hands off the bars is not
to be commended, except for the trick and
fancy rider, the body should be so poised
as to make this possible. Leaning over
often brings fatigue to the chest muscles
while pain in the back is often due to the
same cause. Sit up straight and it will
disapper. In other words, there is hardly
a position which the rider assumes that
cannot be changed to some other . tempo
rarity; at least, to relieve the strain brought
on certain muscles. ,Â°

As will be seen, the only contest will be for
the office of recording secretary. Of the
two candidates Mr. Macfelsel "is the in
cumbent, and has given perfect satisfac
tion. Mr. Liebert is a new member of the
club, who has many friends, and will make
a good run for the position.
The directors of the Bay City Wheelmen
are talking of placing a bowiing-allev in
the basement of the club building. ? Cap

A new division of the League of Amer

Oregon. The officers are: A. I. Donnell,
chief consul; C. L. Howe, vice-consul; P.

The regular monthly meeting of the

THE GUN.
Oregon Ladies Who Are Experts
With Rifle and Fishing: Rod.
. Considerable interest is manifested by
sportsmen who take an interest in inani
mate target shooting in the team race
which will take place to-morrow at the
Empire Club's shooting grounds. The
Lincoln, Olympic and Empire clubs , will
be represented by their best , marksmen,
and considerable speculation Js, indulged
in as to which of the teams .will win the
day. Those who are conversant with the
shooting abilities of the contestants pre
dict success for the Olympic Club's team,
but then it is difficult to venture an
opinion as the Lincolns and Empires
have very excellent material. At any" rate
the contest will be well worth seeing.
The following letter to The Call irom
the secretary of the Reliance Gun Club is
self-explanatory :
Reliance Club, *
Oakland, Cal., April 21.
Sporting Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
Owing to the failure of the Reliance Gun Club
to secure the use of the ground* promised
them, the first "open to all" shoot of the club,
scheduled to take place on the last Sunday of
April, has been postponed until further notice.
Yours respectfully, . **;-,-*',*. R. C.Elder,
, Secretary Reliance Gun Club. *
Among the ladies of Oregon who take
an interest in rifle-shooting and in out
ings in the mountains where small. and
large game is plentiful is Mrs. Phoebe
Filcher of Warrendale, Multnomah
County. The reader will note by refer
ence to the illustration which accompa
nies ; this department that Mrs. Filcher is
joined in one of her pleasure trips in the
mountains by Mrs. Felix - Gum binner,
who is a most successful angler and also a
sketch artist of considerable note. <
During an outing the ladies enjoyed last
summer in A the v woods , of ?- Multnomah
County, Mrs. , Filcher ? shot four brown
bears and one cinnamon. The last one of
the "varmints" proved a : very ugly, cus
tomer. * After being wounded by the first
shot it turned on â¢ its pursuer, and fell at
the \ second ? discharge >of the Winchester
when not more than ten .yards from where
the ? lady ; stood, y Mrs. V Filcher and Mrs.
Gnmbinner-are now making preparations
for an extended outing with rod and rifle
in the wilds of Northern Oregon.
The following colloquy occurred recently
at a bluerock shoot which was held at the
Oakland track: y . ~i

THE KENNEL.
Some High-Class Dogs That Will Be
Seen at the Pavilion Next Month.
The entries for the Pacific Kennel Club's
bench show will close on Tuesday, the
28th inst. According to the secretary the
entry will be very large and a most suc
cessful show is promised.
Among the several high-class dogs which
will help to swell the grand canine chorus
during the days of the exhibition are two
magnificent bloodhounds owned by A. E.
j Culver of Mott, Siskiyou County.
Buckshot II is by Buccaneer, dam Vigi
lant, and. Orchard Trilby . is by King Wil
liam, dam lonica. The trailersof man and
men will certainly attract much attention.
, Mr. Campbell of .. Berkeley, will . enter a
kennel of beautiful Irish setters which
will also attract much attention. A large
entry of greyhounds has been received,
and the same can be said of pugs, spaniels,
pointers and setters. In fact, nearly every
breed of dog will be well represented.
Miller and Prather of Alameda received
in good condition from the East a few
days ago the celebrated cocker spaniel
Viscount, a successful competitor at the
New York and Chicago shows held this
year. Viscount is about 2 years old and
English Bloodhounds Buckshot (No. 37,777) and Phylis (No. 37,779), Property of
A E. Culver of Mott, Siskiyou County, Cal.
it is hardly necessary to add. that he will
prove a valuable, addition to the cocker
spaniel interests of this State. * |
This is one of Chauncey Depew's humor
ous dog stories: "When I was about 14
years old," said the raconteur, "my father
lived on the old farm up at Poughkeepsie.
One day after '- 1 â¢â â¢ had > finished â¢ a five-acre
field of corn my father let me go to town
to see the circus. When m town I saw for
the first time a spotted coach dog. It took
my fancy ; and y l \ bought it and. took it
home. When father saw it his good old
Puritan face . fell. 'Why, â : Chauncey,' he
said, sadly, .'we don't want; any spotted
dog on the farm. It would drive the cat
tle crazy.' 'No, he won't, father,' I said,
'he's a blooded dog.''. The next day it was
raining and ;I A took A the f. dog out in the
woods to try him on a coon,, but the rain
was too much for him.. It washed the
spots off. y That night I took the dog back
to the dealer with a long face. Said ;I:
'Look at that dog, sir. The spots have all
washed off.' 'Great guns, boy^exclaimed
the dog-dealer, 'there :. was an i umbrella
went with that dog. Didn't you get an
umbrella?" \ . ;.* â¢'-,-'. '.._â¢..?â  â¢>
.The American Field recently published
the ; following item : " It may amuse Mr.
Mortimer to know that our English â¢ con
temporary, The Field, speaks of the recent
N York show? and * refers 1 to ; "the i lady
superintendent of the show (an innovation
that has not reached us vet)." ;"J Evidently
Ra "vdon'B; Lee I has got* the Toledo anti

"y Coursing. J
The announcement appeared in a
morning paper that a coursing stake will
be held at Newark to-day under the au
spices of the Interstate Club is declared
by the organization to be erroneous. The
date of the next meeting of the club has
not yet been decided upon.
The sale of saplings on March 21 in Lon
don at the Barbican, famed for the thou
sands of dollars' worth of greyhounds that
have come under the hammer there,
afforded strong evidence that coursing
continues to gain popularity in the United
Kingdom. Not far short of a hundred
saplings were sold, and in ; most cases at
good prices. Proceedings were commenced
by the sale of a white and red dog by Coffee
Hot, Rebus, for $365, and the climax was
reached when $525 was paid for a red dog
by Herschel, Raven. Two well-known
breeders in Captain Percy Hope-Johnstone
and Thomas Graham did well, the former
realizing $2000 for his lot of seven young*
sters and the latter $1540 for a like number.
Another capital average was : made by
John Hedley ? litter of five by Tankerville
11, Harpstring, which brought $1325, or
$265 apiece, a lawn dog mating $400.
"Without giving any particular reason
for its action, the management of the new
Ingleside Coursing Park announced yes
terday that its opening, which was to have
taken place to-morrow, will be postponed
until May 3.
In view of the circumstances, the man
agement of the Ocean View Park has de
cided to keep open house to-morrow, and
will I run a twenty-four-dog stake, which
will include some of j the best dogs in the
City. Many of the hounds that were in
training for Ingleside will go to Ocean
View, and as the grounds are in fine con
dition after the . rain, a fine day's sport is
anticipated.
; Over .; 200; choice hares : are now in the
paddocks, and with a high class lot of dogs
the sport should be first class.
The drawing will take place on the
grounds at 11 o'clock sharp.
THE ANGLER.
Banquet and Election of Officers of
the Rod and Gun Club.
, The anglers' fondest anticipations of ex
cellent trout fishing -in* the early part of
May have been dispelled by \ the [ heavy
rainstorm. .-'..'"

Some stragglers will remain over to *be

it can* be taken as granted? that thousands

the pleasure of the pastime will be greatly

The San Francisco Rod and Gun Club
held its quarterly 'â  banquet last Tuesday
evening, when the following officers were
elected i for the ensuing year : President,
James : Watt; ! - first vice-president, Albert
Smith ; second vice-president,"A. B. Finch ;
secretary, John J H. Sammi (re-elected);
treasurer, John Lenimer. After enjoying
the many good things of the season which
made happy the inner man James Mark
land read '. a â â 'â  very interesting article on
angling from the pen of Professor Agassi-.
Henry Skinner of E. T. Allen & Co., who
is the champion long-distance flycaster of
the coast, gave a very interesting discourse
on the proper method of holding the rod
when casting. ÂW. A. Cooper spoke of the
Fish Commissioners and the good service
they have . accomplished in the past few
years. He favored taxing guns and rods
at a nominal figure. James Watt related
an experience he J had had recently in a
deep bole in Paper-mill Creek, near To
caloma, from which he landed a 3>_-pound
steelhead.
The question of having the reel placed
two inches from the butt of the rod was
argued at length by members. The con
sensus of opinion was that the reel as it
rests now when in position is too close to
the butt ; and must necessarily interfere
with the angler when he is handling a
large fish. To prevent a possible accident
the angler must hold the rod with the
left hand well out from the body when
playing a fish and reel up slack line with
the right hand. g By this awkward method
very little command of the rod can be had,
and especially if the fish is a large and
game fighter. If on the other hand the
rod was constructed in such a manner
that the reel could rest a few inches
from the butt, the angler then would
have full command of the rod and easily
handle the reel without the least incon
venience or fear of accident.
..The following committee was appointed
to confer with the Fish Commissioners:
A. B. Finch, J. H. bammi and W.A.
Cooper. The gentlemen will interview
the Commissioners and see what provi
sions have been made, if any, with the
object in view of stocking coast streams
with trout fry. The club is of the opinion
that the streams which are whipped most
require stocking at least once a year.
The Multnomah Rod and Gun Club of
Portland, Or., is making extensive prepar
ations for a fly-casting tournament, which
will be held in the near future. It has
been suggested that the San Francisco
Rod and Gun Club enter a team of six men
to compete against a like number of men
in a casting tournament for accuracy and
delicacy some time during, the summer
months. The contests may be held at
either place, as the expense of travel to or
from Portland is very nominal now. In
terstate competition will assuredly give
fly-casting a great boom. Nothing like
giving it a trial, i
It is reported on pretty good authority
that Lake Pilarcitos will not be opened to
the angling fraternity this season. The
directors of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany are thinking of opening the San An
dreas Lake on April 1. *\ : -v-'-'- :

There is also talk of having a regatta ar
ranged for Thanksgiving day, in Novem
ber.
A dominant feature of the regatta, will
he the crack coxswains of the different
crews. The Ariels will have a celebrated
Eastern coxswain, who has won many
victories in the big regattas of New York
bay. The Dolphins pride themselves on
their navigator, little Georee Roach, who
has been knocking about boats all his life.
Nelson Echart will handle: the ropes for
Berkeley; Thomas Gilfeatber-* will steer
for the Olympics, and George McGrill, the
coast champion, will handle the rudder
for the South Ends. â 
â¢A- celebrated little coxswain "from one of
the Victoria boat clubs is in town, and is
being anxiously sought lor by one of the
local clubs. * " . "
Al Fritz of the South End Club received
a letter from A G. Browu, secretary of the
Stockton Athletic Association, in which
the writer states that rowing is booming
in Stockton. They will send down a very
speedy junior crew, and a junior single
sculler. 6
They will also try to reorganize their
old senior crew, which defeated the
Pioneers and gave the South Ends such a
hard race at the Stockton regatta on July
4 last.
The candidates for the junior crew of
the South Ends are: J. E. Scully, Jim
Pallas, Tim FUzpatricK, Ed Tobin, Ed
Slattery and George Fox.
T. Barry will soon have his crew in shape
again for another tussle with the South
End seniors. He expects next time to
turn the tables.
The Ariels have two junior crews in
training and a try-out race will be held
soon to see which will represent the club
in the coming regatta. Henry Tank will
Fayette Bortclc, Amateur Champion Sprinter of Southern California.
be delegated to select a senior crew for the
club.
Bob Ellis, who met with an accident
some time ago, is around again, and al
though he is unable as yet to do any row
ing he is down every night training the
junior crews of the Ariels.
The proceeds of the club's recent enter
tainment will be used to purchase a new
four-oared shell similar to that being built
for the Olympics, and two more outrigger
skiffs will be added to the club's present
equipment of boats.
A yachting annex is now attached to the
club. J. R. Bockman was elected com
mander and Eugene Flanders captain.
They have chartered the newly con
structed yacht, Angeline Flanders, for the
season.
The club members are anxiously wait
ing for Eugene Flanders' gasoline launch
to be completed. He received the engine
from the East the other day and it is a
masterpiece of work. It is 22 inches high
and capable of developing 12 horsepower.
The flywheel is only 20 inches in diameter,
but weighs 300 pounds. With this kind of
engine very little space is taken up in
the boat. ; "r. - . ".
The officers elected by the Ariels for the
ensuing year are: George T. McGinnis,
president: N. J. Enright, vice-president;
J. Caugblin, treasurer; E. J. Flanders,
secretary; Bob Ellis, captain; H. Pliss,
vice-captain. Delegate to P. A. A., J.
Nolan; directors, J. Bockman, G. Sbeean,
A. Carrol, Gus Harters and G. Racouillat.
The Pioneers are beginning to show
some signs of life. It is said they will
enter a junior crew in the approaching
regatta, and in all likelihood their crack
senior crew will be induced to give the
South Ends another hard race, as they
were the only crew that ever succeeded in
doing so.
The Dolphin boys, almost to a man, at

CRICKET CHIRPS
The First Cup Matches of the Sea-

The first schedule events for the season
of the California Cricket Association for
the "Hunter Harrison Cup" will be played
to-morrow. At Alameda the club of that
name, which starts the season in the first
place, will contend with the Pacific com
bination. The formidable Bohemians will
meet the California team at Golden Gate.
Both events will be watched with un
usual interest, for new names appear in

BOXING.
Favorites In the Olympic Tourna-
ment-SIOOO for Charity.
The all-absorbing topic at the Olympic
Club is, the boxing festival" which is
scheduled to take place at the Mechanics'
Pavilion on the evening of May 1.
It goes without saying that it will be
one of the great athletic events of the sea
son. The superintendent of .the club
polishes off his field glasses daily in the
iiope of seeing something new in the way
of advancing an interest in the game; but
sufficient to say that tickets are going like
"hot cakes," and the only subject dis
cussed among athletes is the Olympic box
ing tournament. - *
The Pavilion will hold thousands of peo
ple on the night in question and the pro
ceeds will go to the club, which is well de
serving of financial support. :
The friends of George Green are sanguine
that he can- handsomely dispose of his
opponent, Owen Zeigler, ffreide of ten
rounds. Zeigler is training at the six-mile
house, and except' a few intimate friends,
visitors to' the training quarters of the
Eastern boxer are refused the privilege of
seeing nim spar with his attendant, Hugh
Kennedy, who, by the way, is no relation
to Sir William Kennedy of the Olympic.
The men will box at catch weights.
Green, it is said, will enter the ring at 142
pounds, and Ziegler expects to box at 136
pounds. *
A very interesting contest "will result
between J. A. McGinley and Del Hawkins.
Both of the men are expert boxers and a
clever bout is expected. They will weigh
in at 135 pounds.
Joe Sullivan and J. Riley will box at 119
pounds, and E. Van Buskirkand "Soldier"
Walker will weigh as they please, they be
ing heavy-weights. With tne exception of
the Green and Ziegler contest ?â¢ of ten
rounds all other bouts will be six rounds.
The wind-up will be between Van Bus
kirk and the Soldier and it promises to be
a hurricane from start to finish, that is
provided "the Soldier" will not lose heart
and play the peek-a-boo game of dropping
to the floor so as to save his heart from
slipping down into his boots.
Mc Arthur and Foster will second Green
and Ziegler will be esquired by his trainer
and Joe Choynski. The favorites in the
different events are Green, Hawkins, Sui
livan and Van Buskirk, and in all proba
bility this will be the combination team.
The referee will not be selected until the
evening of the contests.
The National Athletic Club is endeavor-
ing to secure a second meeting between
Choynski and Shar&ey. Choynski is very
anxious ' for another chance to prove
to the public that he can ; stop
Sharkey in eight rounds or less. He says
that had it not been for the accident which
happened to him in the first round of his

THE RIFLE.
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club
Testing: Nltro Powder.'
F. O. Young of the Columbia Pistol and
Rifle Club has recently been making ex
periments in the use of nitro powder in
rifles. The results have been more gratify
ing than was expected, not only in clean
liness and convenience, but in the scores.
A number of the riflemen have been a
little timid about using the new ex
plosive, and without even giving it a trial
have condemned its use, claiming that it
is unreliable and too liable to . give wild
shots. After studying the principles of the
question Mr. Young concluded that in
order to make the nitro do its best worK a
radical departure would have to be made
from the time-honored practice in the
use of the old common black powder.
His experiments led him to these con
clusions: First, nitro powder is converted
into gas almost instantly, hence tbe
bullet must be of such material as to re
spond instantly to the pressure exerted.
Otherwise the force of the explosion
would be as much backward as forward.
To obtain the full effect upon the bullet
he has made it of pure lead, the soft metal
affording less resistance in passing along
the grooves or rifling than a bullet contain
ing tin. Again, he allows a small air
space between the bullet and the powder
charge, thus affording an air cushion,
which assists in starting the missile.
His bullets are all /introduced at the
muzzle, for two reasonsâ clean and
lubricate the barrel at the same time and
also fit to the rifling. With the item of
friction so largely overcome Mr. Young is
able to use full charges of nitro, that is,
charges that equal the black powder meas
ure for measure.
A. H. Pape, one of Colombia's best rifle
shots, in company with Mr. Young, made
several experiments with nitro on Wednes
day at? Harbor View. He used patched
bullets, cleaning with a dry rag after each
shot, to remove the nitro dust. He used
for a charge an amount equal in bulk to
45 grains. A mistake must not be made
by supposing that it was 45. grains in
weight, the nitros being lighter than the
black. Following are two of his scores,
shot off-hand, at 200 yards on the Colum
bia target :
4-1nchâ...........3* -1344374 7-40
6 2-10-inch. ......2 6 5 11111 6 7 2 2â52
This shows that the first ten shots were
bunched in the 4-inch circle. The second
string was bunched in a 5 2-10-inch circle.
With nitro used as directed there is no
perceptible recoil, even in the large
charges.
William Glindermann, another mem
ber of the Columbias, is rapidly coming to
the front as a rifleshot. He has been
above the average .' for several years,
but lately he has, made great im
provement over his former perform
ances. On Wednesday -'". he had a
50-shot for $60, rest, 200 yards. He : made
the following remarkable record, this last

Sr. for $40 a side. The match is attracting
much attention among the riflemen.
HANDBALL.
Riordan and Harlow Will Play for
the Championship.
Phil Ryan of the San Francisco Hand
ball court is deeply interested in the match
which was consummated a few days ago be-
tween John Riordan, who held the single
handed championship .or the coast for
many years, and James Harlow, who is
the present champion, haying defeated
Bonnet recently for the title.
Riordan is training faithfully for this
contest and his many friends expect to see
him once again crowned Champion Jack.
The following programme of games will
be carried out to-morrow :
M. McNeil and J. Rodgers to play R. Shea

YACHTING.
The Corinthians Will Open the
Season To-Day.
The Corinthian Yacht Club, which is
composed of the most jovial and enthu
siastic yachtsmen of the coast, will open
its season, of \ pleasure outings to-day at
Tiburon.
Promptly at . 2 o'clock festivities will
begin. An elaborate vaudeville programme
has been arranged for the entertainment
of the lady friends of the yachtsmen, for
the Corinthians always believe in having
the fair sex present at their opening days.
In the evening the jinks will commence
and will be exclusively for the members
and their gentlemen friends. It promises
to be a rare treat, as the jolly tars intend
to conduct festivities witn a lavish hand.
To deviate the course of social enjoy
ment papers . from yachting authorities
will be read and the affairs of the club dis
cussed, and on the morrow the yachts of
the Corinthians will cruise in squadron
about the bay, when the season will be
officially opened and racing commenced.
Baseball.
The society game scheduled for 2:30
o'clock this afternoon at Central Park be
tween the University Club's many-college
nine and the Varsity team of the Univer
sity of California will be played as adver
tised unless it should rain hard this after
noon, in which case it will be postponed
to a date to be published later.
As Chetwood of the University Club
broke his thumb in recent diligent prac
tice for the event, several changes will be
made in the makeup. Joe Tobin will play
in left field, F. B. Howard taking his place
in right, and Lieutenant Smedberg will
cover the bag at third. Otherwise the per

Interest.

Ingeniously Worded Amendments
That May Defeat Their fi.'

_r
THE DE GUEGUERRE POINT DAM
Julian Sonntag Says Further Litiga
tion May Be Resorted To by*
the Miners.
The California Miners' Association is
now watching with the deepest concern its
favorite Congressional bill on hydraulic
mining, which is at present eyrating
through the halls, and corridors of the
National Legislature at Washington. The
bill itself, as originally introduced, carries
with it so much of importance to j the
miner that each new amendment append
ed to it is considered with the greatest in
terest and caution. ?â¢ Ay yy. y- ,yy.AiX :
Prominent miners hint darkly regarding
interests that are trying to make the meas
ure antagonistic to the miner. They fear
that in tne event of the passage of the
river and harbor bill, recently in the hands
of the Senate Committee on Commerce,
there may be such : ingeniously worded
amendments as will practically deprive the
bill of its advantage to hydraulic mining.
The miners are anxious for the con
struction of restraining dams, not bar
riers. They wish dams built so substan
tially that not only the detritus now
gathered in the canyons of the Sierra Ne
vadas shall be restrained from washing
down into the rivers, but that provision
be made also for the restraining of detritus
made by mining. This they have fully
demonstrated can be done easily and with
little further outlay.
In a dispatch from Washington dated
April 22 the Senate Committee on Com
merce was quoted as using the following
language in connection with this matter:
For the construction of restraining barriers
for the protection of the Sacramento and
Feather rivers, in California, $250,000, such
restraining barriers to be constructed under
the direction of the Secretary of Worm ac
cordance with the resolutions of the California
Debris Commission as contained in executive
document No. 16 (H. R.), Fifty-third Congress,
second session, pursuant to the provisions of
and for the purposes set forth in section 25 of
the act of Congress of the United States en
titled "An act to create the California Debris
Commission and regulate hydraulic mining in
the State of California," approved March 1,
1893; provided that the Treasurer of the
United States be and he is hereby authorized
to receive from the State of California, through
the Debris Commissioner of said State, or any
other officer thereunto authorized, any and all
sums of money that have been or may hereby
be appropriated by said State for the purposes
herein set forth, and that said sums when so
received are hereby appropriated for the pur
poses above named, to be expended in the
manner above provided.
Regarding this Julian Sonntag, secretary
of the Miners' Association, said yesterday :
"In reference to the bill now reported by
the Senate committee I am somewhat in
doubt, from a miner's standpoint, whether
this bill will fully cover the requirements
of the miners of this State. This morning
I carefully studied the report of the United
States engineer, or rather the report of
the Debris Commission, and I more par
ticularly dwelt upon executive document
No. 16, H. R., Fifty-third Congress, second
session.
"My particular attention was called to
the matter contained on page 8, commenc
ing at line 19, of this document, in which
the report of the committee particularly
sets forth the erection of a dam at De
Gueguerre Point. Now this point is a
mile wide, and will without any doubt
whatever take more money than is ap
propriated by Congress and the State of
California to build and maintain the dams
contemplated.
"If the statement contained in a daily
paper of an interview with Robert Devlin,
the attorney of the . Anti-Debris Associ
ation, be correct, that the purpose of the
present amended bill is as he statesâ to
the effect that barriers be erected and the
detritus be held in check by these bar
riers, and that no hydraulic, mining he
permittedâ it will, I say, compel further
legislation on the part of the miners. -
"The miners, however, and the officers
of the Miners' Association repose full con
fidence in their ability of our representa
tive in Washington, the Hon. Tirey L.
Ford. I telegraphed him to-day for fur
ther information on this subject."
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Clever Manner in Which the
American Bark Seminole
Was Repaired.
The Steamer Point Arena and the
Wrecker Whitelaw Drifted oa j
the Rocks. j
i The bark Seminole, which arrived from
Sydney, N. 8. vV., yesterday, with 2158
tons of coal, : had ; a peculiar experience.
She sailed on February 18, and two days
later Captain Weeden discovered that she
was leaking. An ; examination showed
that a butt three feet under the waterline
had started, and an effort was made to re
pairVthe damage. . Over fifty tons of the
cargo was jettisoned, but the. leak could
not be reached.
Captain Weeden then decided to run for
the island of . Tongareva. 'which place he
reached. on March 25. For a few dollars
he hired a couple of pearl-divers, and in
less than an hour these men had , located
tbe leak and patched the hole up with '; a
piece of lead. The men went down stark
naked, and 'would work under water for a
couple of minutes at a time. Had an
American diver been used it would proba
bly have cost the ship a couple of hundred
dollars. After discharging the Seminole
will go on the drydock for an overhauling.
The steamer City of Peking arrived from
China and Japan < yesterday. There ; were
only i four - cabin passengersâ C. v P. "\ Troy

China the plague is still raging, but 'in
Japan it has been fought to a standstill. .
The Peking brings news only a few days
later than thut brought by the Gaelic.
â  The San Juan has arrived from Central
American ports. She brought no passen
gers, but she had a heavy cargo of coffee
from way ports. She brings the news
that the old Starbuck has been floated off
the rocks at Amapala and is on her way
to San Francisco for repairs.
The schooner Mary Bidwell got in from
Mexico last night. She -made a very long
trip and was compelled to put into Gaviota
for' provisions. .On April .22 in latitude
35.47 north; longitude 121.44 west, Louis
Forbes, aged 20 years, a native of the Cape
Verde Islands, died of consumption and
was buried at sea.
The wrecking steamer Whitelaw and
wrecked steam schooner Point Arena had
a narrow "escape last night. In order to
get the latter vessel pumped out she was
towed around to the North Beach flats.
When the ' tide began to run in both
steamers drifted and finally brought upon
the seawall. Little damage was done, and
finally the Whitelaw and the derelect were
towed to Second-street wharf, where the
work of raising the Point Arena went on.
While on her way ' from : San Francisco
for Yaquina Bay, the â¢ steam ' schooner
Farallon went on a rock near Point Gorda
and lost a considerable portion of her shoe.
The National City went to the assistance
of the Farallon, but Captain Robert re
fused help and ' finally reached Eureka.
She will be put on the drydock and will
probably be ready to continue her voyage
next Monday.

PAGE GETS JUSTICE.
Judge "Wallace Sends the Ex-District
Attorney to the State Prison for
Eight Tears. â¢';-â¢.';.â *-â¢"*-.'; .;
Unless the Supreme ; Court should step
in to prevent, the next few years of James
B. Page's life will be spent behind prison
bars. He is the ex-District Attorney, who
was convicted of embezzlement for having
got away with | $-4000 of his insane ward's
estate. He was sentenced to eight years'
imprisonment by Judge Wallace yesterday.
Page, while District Attorney of this
City, was appointed guardian of the estate
of Louis Lichneker, an insane man, who
was then in the asylum. The estate
amounted to over $5000, but Page fur
nished bonds for only $200. Some time
after his appointment it was found that
Lichneker's estate had dwindled down to
a very few hundred dollars, and Page was
repeatedly ordered into court to accouut
for the money thus missing. He never
made answer, but during a lull in the pro
ceedings he had himself removed from
the guardianship and started East. A
charge oi embezzlement was immediately
placed against him, and he was brought
back and tried. He was found euilty in a
very short time.
Page's attorney moved for a new trial
before sentence was passed. He argued
that the court had erred in instructing the
jury; that the information was not accord
ing to legal form, and upon several other
technicalities, j The motion was promptly
denied and sentence was passed after the
court had reviewed the crime Page had
committed.
CRIME AND CRIMINALS
Dr. Hirschfelder Speaks of Both
at Cooper Medical : 'M
College.
The Lecturer Gives Some Instances
of Hereditary Tendency to
Evil./ -/
Though the subject has a gruesome
sound, and though the evening was cold,
Dr. Hirchfelder found a large and appreci
ative audience awaiting him as he as
cended the rostrum of the Cooper Medical
College to deliver his masterly lecture on
"Crime and Criminals."
"Of late we have come to understand
that there are individuals who seem to be
unable to conform to the general rules of
society as we understand it," commenced
the j lecturer. "The criminal whom we
wish to deal with is not the insane, but the
depraved type. Yet it is hard to mark
the line between insanity and depravity.
I recollect the case of a boy whose father
was insane and who in a moment of ii'
feeling broke his Bister's skull with a ham
mer. This was a case of one on the bor
der-land betwixt insanity and crime.
"To the normal mind criminal tempta
tions are merely passing thoughts. But
there are other forms of minds which
dwell upon such thoughts. Little by little
the man or woman goes on and on until
at last a point is reached when crime be
comes natural. The great mass of human
beings maybe divided into three categories :
First, those who could never become crimi
nals; second, those who are, so to speak,
born criminals; and lastly, those who may
or may not develop into criminals. '. ,
"The heredity of criminality is proved
beyond all possibility of a doubt. A cer
tain great criminal in New York has given
to the country over 700 descendants, most
of whom are thoroughgoing criminals.
As a rule tbe heads of criminals are either
pointed or sugar-loaf shaped, or flattened ;
the cheek-bones high and the chin thrust
forward. Generally speaking, there is a
sort of family resemblance among crimi
nals of all classes. In the practice of tat
tooing, many criminals seem to rejoice.
Sometimes the designs tattooed on the
bodies of criminals are religious in charac
ter, though they are often immoral in
their nature.
"Inability to blush has : always been
thought an Indication of criminality.
Lambroso, by scientific investigation,
found that the most powerful emotional
disturbances in criminals were caused by
cowardice and vanity, not by shame.
Sometimes cruelty .. is , a favorite , amuse
ment of criminals. Lambroso relates that
a man killed his own father in order to
gain possession of the family funds; and
not finding them, he roasted bis mother's
feet over hot coals in order to oblige her to
acknowledge where j the money was con
cealed.
"In London we find that Jonathan
Wilde displayed great administrative and
executive ability. He had emissaries in
court, in church and at the country fairs.
Among criminals the perpetrators of great
crimes are regarded as aristocrats, so to
speak, and as objects deserving of emula
tion. This fact is plainly evinced Dy
criminal statistics in all countries. Also
the love of cards and drink is frequently
noted among these depraved specimens of
the human race. -"-â¢."â -.-â â â  <â  , "
y ; '..'Superstition and religion are often met
I with among criminals. The murderer will
> sometimes make the sign of the cross with
a hand yet moist with his victim's blood.
But these fanatical practices are not to be
confounded with the reasonable and well
ordered devotional exercises of law-abiding
religionists, since the former use prayer
and fasting as a sort of fetish worship,
while the latter - make use of /th em as
means of refreshing their profound relig
ious sentiment.
Ai "Geographically speaking, it is curious
to note that theft is more common in
wealthy ' countries : than ?'. in poor ones.
England, * France i and Scotland ' are the
richest nations, per capita, in Europe; yet
in Spain we find one-fourth the thieving
that there is in Scotland." â¢ yy'.
Facts and figures were cited in great
profusion to '" prove ' that I the criminal is
born rather than made, and that it is bet
ter to cure him if possible ; than to punish
him. .

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if . any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connrct points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: â¢â¢low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" ls inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may he expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result-

NEW YOUR MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 24.â Speculation at
the Stock Exchange to-day was strong early In the
day and the trend of prices was upward, owing
mainly to the fact that quotations came higher
and that the St. Paul statement for the third week
of April was unexpectedly favorable. There was
a brisk inquiry of local account for all the leading
shares, as well as the speculatives. Tobacco
jumped 25% to 73 and the remainder of the list
Unproved auywnere from 14 to 1 per cent. The
('rangers were strong and stored the highest figures
yet attained. In the afternoon Tobacco reacted to
70 1 4. but tills had comparatively little influence.
Even when sugar broke from 125% to 121% on
heavy sales, based on the passage of the anti-trust
bill by the Legislature at Albany, speculation dis
played little weakness.
If sugar had declined as much at any other time
within the past few weeks the market would un
doubtedly have suffered material losses. This
afternoon the decline was only Vi(<L\y_ cent
nnd at the close there was a fractional rally all
round. There was little pressure to sell outside of
the ranks of the room-traders, and It may be said
that the market developed great firmness under
the C_rcu___tanee_, Net changes in the railway
list show declines of Va to 3/ 8 , while in sugar a
drop of 3 per cent was recorded. Tobacco on the
other hand advanced */. per cent. Total sales
were 233,500 shares. A

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 24.â The wheat market
continued to feel the Influence of the seasonable
weather to-day. In the Northwest there ? have
been heavy rains, and seeding has been backward,
but even in that section clearing weather has fol
lowed the recent showers, and from tho oest
sources the information comes that it is not y t
too late to accomplish the work of planting. The
statement by two prominent elevator proprietors
thai they purpose delivering out about 1,000.000
bushels each on the Ist of May, did not tend to
help the tone of the market to-day.
Liverpool cables were firm and %d higher. Re
ceipts were nine cars at Chicago and 130,308
bushels were taken from store. The Northwest
had 3*7 cars against 301 last Friday and 327 a
year ago. In the last hour firmness developed on
reports of chlch bugs in Kansas and a rumor that
Thoman would give out a bullish condition on
winter wheat. Closing Continental cables were
higher. Export clearances amounted to 151.780
bushels. July wheat opened from 64%@64%c
to 64V-@64R_c, sold between 63% c and 65% c,
closing at 651/8" bid, 3/ 8 c higher than yes ci day.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow eleven cars.
CORNâ Displayed firmness early, thereby con
trasting with wheat, but as the leading market
grew more pronouncedly weak corn gradually lou
the steady tone. Offerings were not heavy and
shorts bought with greater or less energy. Liver- i
pool cables were steady. .- eceipts were 240 cars
and 86,280 bushels were taKen from store. Ex- j
port clearances amounted to 305,394 bushels. The |
reversal of the tone of wheat in the last hour was 1
responded to by corn, prices rallying and closing st j
an advance over yesterday. July corn opened !
at 30% c. sold up to 31c, closing at 80*4Â®80'fe, Va
@V_c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 310 cars.
OATS â Reflected the temper of wheat, declining
and rallying with that grain. There was a vfry
notable lack of interest, and prices receded with
but little tradi g, recovering in the same easy
manner. Receipts were 214 cars. There were no
withdrawals from store. July oats closed a shade
over yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
206 cars
FLAXâ Was firmer; cash, 92y 2 c: May, 88%@

PROVISIONS â Further improvement took j
place in hog prices this mornine, a good demand |
being reported at the yards. This was the main ,
consideration in product which a so exhibited a
better tone. At the close July por_ and lard were
each 5c higher than yesterday, and July ribs 2%c
higher.
BUTTERâ was no particular change in
the appearance of the butter market to-day.
Stocks were moving out a trifle more freely, but
the easy feeling still prevailed. Creameries,

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 24.â R. G. Dun & Co.
to-morrow will say in their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the week have been 238 ln the ' United
States against 230 last year, and 44 In Canada
against 37 last year. Business has been favored
by seasonable weather, and the distribution of
products has made fair progress, not yet reducing
retail or wholesale stocks far enough, however, to
materially . improve the position of .'industries.
Money markets have grown more favorable as
well as the state of foreign commerce, and until an
apparently groundless revival of discussion about
the Venezuela difficulty, there was brighter pros
pects of European Investments here. The belief
that agitation for cheap money will be permanently
laid at rest this year is gaining ground, and- in
financial quarters causes more confidence for the
future.
Prices of commodities are on the whole lower
than ever before, having declined about 2 per cent
since April 1 and 17 per cent since July, 1890, or
October, 1892.- The fall in manufactured prod
ucts is a little less than it was April 1, but in farm
products greater.
Speculation Is swayed by trilling influences when
markets are very narrow. The recent advance
checked buying of wheat tor export, and Atlantic
exports for the week were only 1,018,254 bushels.
flour included, against 1.768,873 last year, while
. Western receipts were 2,094,557 bushels against
1,976,408 last year. With generally fair prospects
as to winter wheat the price dropped about 2c,
nearly half the rise based on gloomy receipts early
this morning. - ":''.'â â¢
Corn receipts continue heavy and the price is a
shade lower.
A single enterprising buyer was able to push up
the price of cotton an eighth, though the progress
of planting elves promise of a large yield and the
receipts continue as large as 1893.
Cotton goods were bought less freely last week
and the Northern mills have taken scarcely any
cotton this month. The feeling is more hopeful
because retail trade is better. The situation in
woolen goods does not improve. The large orders
taken for boots and | shoes . when â¢ prices were re
duced fo last year's lowest, more than a month
ago, result In shipments nearly equal to last year's
in April, thus far. 5 per cent less: bnt new orders
are not now coming freely except for immediate
delivery to i fill â  out ; broken stocks. Leather is
weaker, with, heavy sales averaging about 3 per
cent lower for the week, although higher at Chi
cago. â * ' â --..,..*.. r.
* Neither pigiron nor manufactured goods have
improved in demand as yet, though further com
binations have raised prices of rods and of bar
Iron to $120, while steel bars sell at $115 and
nails are to be Isc higher after May 1. Brokers at
Pittsburg are still selling steel billets 60c below the
pool prices, though it was formed more than three
weeks ago, and Bessemer pig has declined there
to $13; gray forge stronger. Structural angles are
a shade lower, though some good contracts are ex
pected. Many consumeis of copper are working
part time and lake . Is offered at $10 65. Tin Is
dull, but a shade higher at $13 04, and lead with
large Western = sales, at $3 07y . Makers of tin
plates have agreed to maintain prices, $3 70 belnc
still quoted for Bessemer coke, full weight.

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the

Coast mines with i 12.604 tons of Coal, and three
arrivals from Australia with 10,468 tons. There
are overdue two vessels from Newcastle upon
which extra insurance rates are being paid, as it ls
feared one or both may not arrive. The sales this
week for domestic uses have been large, as con
sumption has been materially, increased by â  our
stormy weather. -There Is no noticeable change of
values, although there to a prevailing feeling on
the part of shippers to fill orders at a shade less

The large gymnasium of the Oakland

friends of the Lowell High School and the
local institution. The long talked of de-

Aaron H. Brown.
bating contest between the two schools
came off, and after two hours of oratory
the judges decided in favor of the Oakland
school.
The debate was based on the following
theme: "Resolved, that the substitution of
a responsible Ministry for the President's
Cabinet would be beneficial, to. the United
States Government." The affirmative was
taken by the Oakland orators and the neg
ative by the Lowell debators.
"Many times have we met on the ath-

letic field,'* said Mr. Keeler, "but this is
the first time in the history of California
high schools that an intellectual contest
has ever been arranged."
I. Golden of the Lowell School was in
troduced into the chair by Mr. Keeler, and
after a few remarks Fred Dorety opened
the debate in the affirmative.
Mr. Dorety argued that the present
method of conducting the English Gov
ernment is superior to that of this country
in many ways. He said briefly :
Our institutions are a growth, and we must
consequently develop as the Nation grows. If
we find that the experience of England can
teach us anything it is our duty to follow it,
and I contend it has taught us a great deal.
The advantages of a Ministry are many and
tend to educate the people, as they vote direct
ly on national, questions every time a dissolu
tion of the House takes place. It would not
destroy the power of Congress, but would har
monize the various branches of the Govern
ment and expedite legislation.
J. Frank English then spoke in the nega
tive. He commenced with a quotation
from "Puud'nhead Wilson, that '''Differ
ence of opinion makes horseracine,' and it
also makes debates," said the speaker. "
Then he continued:
The general tend ency of all government I
.is toward oppression. We argue that in
our system, as we have it to-day, rest the |
security and happiness of the people. The j
present constitution of our Senate is perfect. j
It is an everlasting body, as: one-third retires;
each two years, and this is the best curb on j
hasty legislation that we could have.
Mr. English is a very smart speaker.
He made many points by his manner
and by his witticisms.
VV. B. Reynolds followed for the affirma
tive and said in brief: '"y -l ' ...
The purpose of our argument is to show that
the substitution of a responsible ministry is
practicable. The last speaker appealed more
to your hearts than your heads. The cardinal:
â¢evil of our present system is the ) separation : of
power, the pitting of one part of the Govern
ment against the other. Political revolution
has always tended to centralize power and
takeaway from bodies acting in antagonism
toward each other power which they have
misused. I will cite England . as an example
of what I mean. From the time of the aboli
tion of the Saxon heptarchy to the present
time Great Britain has steadily progressed in
the art of government.
If there were a responsible Ministry there
could be no important measure stifled in the
committee-room owing to influence. Jobs
would be abolished. A systematic, Intelligent
and continuous form of government would be
instituted. At this time all important meas
ures are submitted to committees, who work
in secret session and who surprise or disgust
the public quite as often as they do anything
worthy of commendation. This system would
effectually do away with a boodling lobby and
would enable everything to be settled on its
merits by debate. Whenever the Ministry
should dissolve the House the question would
at once go to the people and they would decide
every great governmental difficulty.
J. C. Coleman of San Francisco was the
next speaker. He said : y ,'? y â 
In reply to the statement that the meetings
of committees are secret, I may say that by a
simple vote the Senate can order published
every word uttered in committee. Is it possi
ble that a legislative body growing in power,
with the calm superior judgment of the Senate
removed, would care lor the veto power of the
President? In England the veto power had
not been exercised for a century and a half.
The recent strike is an example of the fallacy
of the doctrine favoring a responsible minis
try; the Ministers would have been forced to
pass laws favorable to the majority or they
would soon go out of office. The President,
against the will of the Governor of Illinois,
sent United States troops to the riots at Chi
cago, and the high-handed measures of the
strikers were soon put down. We might bave
been suffering from that strike yet had it not
been for the supreme power vested in the
President. In this country our interests are
different from those of England. Our terri
tory is so much greater that our Senate is an
absolute necessity. It would, indeed, be very
humiliating to our President were he to be
reduced to the position of a figurehead, such
as that of Queen Victoria.
Charles Quayle closed for the affirm
ative. He summed up the argument in
favor of a responsible Ministry in the place
of a Cabinet. He referred to the great crisis
of the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln
carried through successfully a great con
flict, often in defiance of his Congress. The
springing up of a war after a President
had been in office for two years would
leave us helpless if he were incapable of
managing the struggle. "Our plan is not
to destroy the Senate," said Mr. Quayle,
"but to allow the President to name his
premier and to allow the Premier to choose
"What argument can reconcile us to
present conditions ? " protested Bert
Reynolds. -.-.
his Ministry from both houses. This is
our case. We declare that a responsible
Ministry has proved in Great Britain that
it can cope with all unusual and unlooked
for conditions and carry itself with dig
nity in all times of emergency for many
centuries. Were it inaugurated in this
country the present dissatisfaction would
not have been known, and surely no one
with common sense will say that we are
to-day a Nation satisfied with our form of
government." *-",.,-
Aaron Brown closed for the negative.
He reviewed the points made by his pre
decessors and denied :', that the lack of
haste in the progress of legislation was
not detrimental, for if a law were to stand
it could not be too carefully considered.
"For this country we contend that a re
sponsible Ministry is impossible," said
Mr. Brown. "It is autocratic and could
not possibly nope to satisfy our people.
The English Ministry ha 3 always sought
"The subject Is one that demands our
calm consideration," said Mr. J. ?F.
English. y > V
to let the majority rule totally indepen
dent of the minority. Our Government
protects the rights of the? minority, and
under our present system they are amply,
protected. Tho experience in. England
proves that the responsible Ministry form
of government is a failure in more re
spects and in more important features
than those onr opponents in debate at
tribute to the Government in this country.
To establish a British form of government
in this country would be worse than folly."
The judges? then retired. They were
absent for nearly an â¢ hour, and when they
returned they reported i that the . debaters
had argued on five specific points. Three
of these had , been ? sustained by ;" the Oak
land boys and two by the Lowell School
O/ators, and the honors i were therefore in
favor of the Oakland High School.

YOUNG MEN WANT POWER
To Be a Hard Fight for Control
of the People's Party
Convention.
SHORT HAIR VS. LONG HAIR.
County Delegates Will Name Their
Delegates to Sacramento at To-
Day's Convention.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 24. i
The People's â  party convention that
will meet in Elite Hall to-morrow morn-
ing will develop a fight for the control of
the party in this county. The struggle
has been increasing in bitterness since the
last election and the full armor of both
factions is girded on for to-morrow's battle.
The contest will commence with the
election of chairman. The two elements
in the party are spoken of among them
themselves as the "Longhairs" and
"Shorthairs." The longhairs are led by
ex- Assemblyman Aaron A. Bretz, and his
j leading lieutenants are J. Hookirk, B.
I Rosenberg and Major Howe. They are
the original element of the People's party
nnd have been prominently identified with
the party since its birth in this county. j
Their plans and methods were too anti- ,
quated to suit the temperaments of the i
younger element, the shorthairs, and ai ;
few weeks ago the Young Men's Populist j
Club was formed. y -yy "y â 
To its banner flocked the more youthful j \
and energetic members of the party. j'â 
Among them are Adna Denison, T. ,J. I .
Roberts of A. R. U. fame, J. A. Hennessy of â¢
West Oakland, W. H. Chapman, J. R. â¢â 
Elley and Leo Robinson. Tnese are dis
satisfied with the old method of conduct
ing the party, and are determined if possi
ble to obtain control of the party ma
chinery.
The longhairs will nominate Bretz for
chairman and the shorthairs will put ;
Dennison up. Both sides claim sufficient

"The political shears are going to be
used to-morrow," said T. J. Roberts to
day. "We want to keep the party intact, j
bus there must be some shearing done. j
We have outgrown the long-hair period :
and we are intending to cut off the long
locks of the ancients. If they will con- â 
sent to part with their old methods and ]
long-hair tactics there will be no trouble,
but there must be a change. The young
blood in the party will not submit to the
silurian ways that have prevailed for the
last twenty years. We cut our hair and
look decent, and we intend to be felt in
the convention and in the party. They
have dubbed us the shorthairs, but if
they will patronize the political barber
and cut their silurian locks there will
be no bloodshed."
The old-timers object to "the boys" run
ning things and predict defeat. It is al
most agreed that whoever get- control, E.
M.Gibson and J. F. McSwain will be sent to. j
the National Convention. The most notic
able feature in the anti-convention prattle I
is that neither Mayor Davie nor Council- j
man Bassett cure in the discussions on |
either side. Eighteen months ago they j
were the idols of the party.

WEBSTER-STREET BRIDGE
Alameda Taking Precaution to
Prevent Change of
Location.
Unitarian Conference Closes â Post
ponement of Various Social
Gatherings.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. April 24.â The city
authorities are determined not to be
caught napping on the proposed idea of
building a new bridge across the estuary,
and removing the present Webster- street
bridge. In addition to' remonstrating j
with the Secretary of War on such a line j
of action the City Clerk forwarded letters I
to-day to Senator George Perkins and Con- i
gressman S. G. Hilborn, explaining the !
situation and requesting their assistance. I
The objections taken are : $ -
Firstâ the Webster-street draw- j
bridge has been at its present location for j
more than a quarter of a century; that be- ;
tween the bridge and the highland of \
Alameda there extends a mile of roadway,
constructed at great expense, over a marsh
of such, a nature that it took many years
of settling and refilling before the roadway
obtained its present foundation; that any
material change in the location of said j
bridge will require at great expense the |
construction of another roadway ; and that j
the city of Alameda has no other street or
right of way over the marsh.
Second â The present bridge is located
at a point which best suits the convenience I
of the public traveling between, Alameda
and Oakland.
Thirdâ direct continuation of said
roadway in the city of Alameda is known ;
us Seventh street, and is a business center, J
and there is no other business street in
said city within a | distance of two miles, I
and as Alameda is a residence city it is not |
desirable to create new business centers.
Fourth location? of said bridge is (
on the narrowest point of the estuary ly
ing between Alameda and Oakland, and
the construction of a bridge elsewhere
would entail not only great cost for? erec- j
tion, but additional cost and danger for \
maintenance.
Fifthâ approaches and streets
leading to the present bridge on both the I
Alameda and Oakland sides have been i
constructed and improved so as to render I
easy access to it, and any chance would
seriously incommode the traveling public,
besides requiring a large outlay for new
approaches.
Sixthâ The abandonment of said road
way would direct travel and trade from its \
present established channels, destroy real !
estate vaiues and business interests, and
work irreparable injury to the city.
In addition it was added to the letter
that if the War Department: decides to
construct a bridge at a new location it will
do so *on some* point eastward* of the
Southern Pacific railroad bridge.
' .Unitarian Conference.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 24.â The third
and last sitting of the Pacific Unitarian
Conference was held this morning and the
business quickly disposed of. No decision
was arrived at for the meeting- place j next
year. Portland was suggested, but the mat
ter was left in the hands of the directors.
The new directors chosen, holding office for
four years, were: Rev. Horatio Stebbins,
D.D., San Francisco; Rev. C. W. Wendte,
Oakland ; Rev. A. J. Wells, San Francisco;
Rev. E. M. Wilbur, Portland, Or. Resolu
tions were adopted thanking the Alameda
church members for their hospitality, ap
| pointing the Pacific Unitarian, the official :
j newspaper of the church, and thanking
i the press generally; for its reports of the
j conference meetings. 3 . . ,*?
The woman suffrage movement, which
j was presented for discussion by request,
I was frowned down upon by both sexes and
| totally ignored. .' .
j The idea of forming a Young People's
I Religious \ Union on tne ? lines of the
I Christian Endeavor ? : Society, the outcome
i of a? discussion led by ; Rev. Mrs. E. T.

j the delegates.

CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES
Intercollegiate Field Day to Be
Held This Afternoon .at
Olympic Grounds.
A CLOSE SCORE ANTICIPATED.
The Intercollegiate Deflate To-Night.
Freshmen Want Another
Rushâ Not?
. ' -
BERKELEY, Cal., A. .11 -^. â To
morrow afternoon the representative track
and field athletes of the University of
California and Stanford will meet at the
Olympic grounds Lto decide the coast in
tercollegiate championship for the season
of '96. The games will be held rain or
shine. For the Berkeley men the field
day will serve a double purposeâ that of
determining whether or not they will be
the college champions of the coast for an
other year; and also who are eligible for
places on the Eastern team, which will
leave California in just two weeks. About
the same number of men are entered from
both institutions, Berkeley having a few
more in the weights and middle distances.
Fifty-eight signatures in all are listed. No
extraordinarily fast time in the sprints or
hurdles is expected because of the extreme
dampness of the track, but in the distances
and weights, especially the hammer
throw, great things are anticipated.
Edgren, the California giant, will prob
! ably duplicate his recent throw of 148 fe et
! 6 inches and thus make for himself the mi
i tercollegiate record of America. Though
!he has thrown the pound weight â 'â  even
| farther than ' this in practice, he is hardly
j expected to duplicate his best throw to
morrow, though there is no telling what
I surprises he will spring. The Berkeley
j athletes, notwithstanding their precedent
i of winning every track athletic contest
; from Stanford in which they have entered,
1 the experience of an Eastern trip last year
j and a season of hard training, will not
have sucn an easy time in winning to
! morrow, according to their own state
' ments, as heretofore. Though they doubt
! not that they will come out several points
j ahead, yet. it will be only after an effort.
Ex-Captain Koch said this afternoon
, that the only events he felt certain of for
I the U. C. were the hammer-throw and
j the 120 hurdle, and that the only two
i which he could concede to Stanford are
| the mile run and the pole-vault.- "The
l other events." said * he, "stand in the bal
j ance, with the dip slightly in our favor."
In the 100-yard dash Dickie of the U. C.
j and Bunton of Stanford are both 10 2-5
i seconds men, and, in consequence, the
j race for first place seems to lie between
I them, with Chick and Hupp fighting
against Bernard for second.
The 220 will go, in all probability, about
[ the same way. In the middle distances
I the odds are somewhat in favor of Cali-
I fornia, with Brown and Magee as entries.
I The mile bicycle race will be fought with
j vigor by Crafts, the U. C. crack, against
! Anfenger.
It is generally believed that Wilbur will
I take the shot-put from California, with
j Lloyd a close second. Koch cannot enter
this event on account of a strained shoul
der. Merwin is expected to do some of
his old-time work and carry off the honors
of the mile wait. As for the j rest of the
eventsâ the broad jump, the high, the
I hah' mile, the 220 hurdle â they seem to be
j somewhat of a toss-up. Much interest is
j manifested in the outcome of these games,
j since so much with regard to the contem
j plated Eastern trip of the California men
will depend upon it.
Intercollegiate Debate.
Â« BERKELEY, Cal., April 24.â The an
nual intercollegiate debate will take place
to-morrow evening at Metropolitan Hall,
San Francisco. .Â« The three speakers who
will represent the State University are
Joseph ; O'Connor, F. H. Dam and M. C.
Flaherty, all of the senior, class. : It is a
peculiar coincidence that the three speak
ers are in the same class,' are the same age
within six months, are all natives of this
State and each intends studying law.
Flaherty and O'Connor are in the college
of social science,. while Dam is a classical
student. Flaherty is a graduate lof -Cogs
well's Polytechnic Institute and will be
remembered as being a member of last
year's debating team as well as the winner
of the Carnot medal this spring. A'-'yA..
Dam prepared' for the university at the
Academy of California College, East Oak
land, where he took an absorbing interest
in debating and rhetorical work. - He is at
the present time president of the Students'
Congress at Berkeley and a member of the
Intercollegiate Debating League. - ; ;
O'Connor graduated from the San Fran
cisco Boys' High School, where he; held
I high rank as a student and debater. He
was a dark horse in the final preliminary
contest and took first place on the trio. '.?
..The judges of "the debate will be Hon.
Joseph McKenna,? Judge of the United
' States Circuit Court; Hon. W. ,W. Mor
row, Judge of the United States ; District
I Court, and Hon. O. C. Freeman, a promi
nent San? Francisco attorney and law
author. Following will be the subject for
discussion:
* Resolved, That article I, section 3, clause 1 of
the constitution of the -United* States be
amended so a3 to read: ."The Senate of the
United States shall be composed of five Sena
! tors from ; each State, \ chosen by .*â¢ the . people
thereof, and;: the electors of each State shall
have qualifications requisite for electors of the
House of " Representatives." Each Senator , to
be chosen for six years and to have one vote.*. ,
And that part of article I, | section 3, clause
2, which reiers to the filling of vacancies in
the Senate, should ba amended so as to read:
''And .if ; vacancies. happen, by resignation or
otherwise, they shall be filled in the same
manner as vacancies in the House of Repre
sentatives.'.' ; r- : 'â 'â '."â *â â¢':.â â â 
;â¢"â  The winning team will ; receive for equal
distribution among its members the $200
offered by Senator George C. Perkins for
the successful contestants in the annual
intercollegiate debate of 1896.
This generous offer oi the Senator has
done much toward stimulating interest in
debating at both universities. The prize
is the first offered for debating of this kind
on the Pacific Coast. -
The speakers in their order will be as fol
lows : â * A.y-'
Affirmative, Stanfordâ A. M. Cathcart,
J. M. Ross, H.D. Sheldon. f

Will Bo Avenged.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 24. âAt a
wildly enthusiastic meeting the freshmen
class of the State University decided to
challenge the sophomores to a "rush," to
be held: on the , campus the night before
class day, May 8. The freshmen appeared
very sore, both physically and otherwise,
over the overwhelming defeat adminis
tered by the "sophies" in the Bourdon
rush yesterday afternoon, and as a means
of avenging the trouncing they decided to
bring out the sophomores for another
tussle. Thoughts of the defeat by the
second-year men last fall also rankled
within them, and they voted with a loud
yell to try conclusions for the third time,
to, see if the proverbial "charm" would
prove to be all that it is claimed to be.
Doubts were expressed among the soph
omores as to whether the challenge would
be accepted because they have already
come off -victors against the freshmen
twiceâ with a challenge and once
without. Some of them say that it would
be undignified to accent the challenge con
sidering what has already taken place.
STANFORD COMING.
The Students! Will Arrive To-Day to
Compete on the Campus and Forum.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
24.â T0-morrow will be a big day in inter
collegiate affairs, as the representatives of
Stanford and Berkeley are scheduled to
meet each other in competition on the
track in the afternoon at the Olympic
Club grounds and in the great intercol
legiate debate at night. The men have
trained very faithfully and had the
weather been good and the track in condi
tion several records would have been
smashed. As it is, Track Manager Brown
says that no running records will be
broken, but that the contest will surely be
close and interesting, no matter what the
conditions. > /? -
In the 100- yard dash Stanford will enter
Bernhard '96, Holbrook '97, Toombs '96
(captain), and Brunton '99. Joe Bernhard
is the best sprinter Stanford possesses. He
has had considerable experience on the
track, and in his junior year was elected
track captain. He has a record of 10 2-5,
made at Stanford, and enjoys the distinc
tion of having defeated Berkeley in the
100-yard dash and the 220-yard sprint.
Since Scroggins is not at Berkeley this
year, Bernhard stands a good show to win,
though Dickie and Chick are said to have
made records of 10 1-5. 'A.y'yy
John Brunton was one of the crack men
to enter Stanford this year, jHe made his
first appearance last year on the Stanford
track when he was attending a prepara
tory academy. Later he made his first
Eublic appearance in Sacramento, when
c won four first places. He is a strong
runner, with great endurance and an
ideal build for an athlete. His best work
is in the quarter-mile run, but he has also
made very fast time in the 100-yard, 10 2-5
being his record.
Holbrook is also fast, being quick at the
start and a good finisher.
Captain Toombs is trying in the sprints
for the first time this year; he has made a
good showing in the 100 yard and 220, but
is looked to for his best work at the broad
and high jump. <At the broad jump he
easily clears 20 feet 6 inches, and 5 feet 6
inches is a fair trial for him in the high
jump. '-'1 *â :â¢â¢'-' â .-:'.: -A;Ay
Colliver'96, will be entered in the 220,
for his recent work has been of a first-class
order.?-?,'?: A-yf . â¢â¢
The hurdles are found to be exciting.
Harry Reynolds is looked on here as be
ing able to make Torrey of Berkeley
hustle. Reynolds won a 220-yard hurdle
from Berkeley, and will work hard to win
again this year. His best record is 27 2-5.
In the 120-yard hurdle he has done good
work this year, although he never tried
the event before. In a late trial in the
120-yard hurdles he made it under 17 sec
onds. In the high jump Reynolds will
also enter, and has a record of 5 feet 5
inches in that event.
Charles Dole '98 is the best all-round
athlete nere. Unfortunately he enters the
meet with a bruised heel, but will cer
tainly make a good showing. Dole is a
nephew of President Dole of the Hawaiian
Islands. He is the champion Y. M. C. A.
all-round athlete on the coast. His work
at the hurdles has been of a high order re
cently. Among his records are: 10 feet
1%. inches for the pole vault; 17 seconds
for the 120-yard hurdles; Â£7J_ seconds for
the 220-yard hurdles; 20 feet 6 inches for
the broad jump; 5 feet 5 inches forjthe high
jump. He also puts the shot 36 feet and
sprints well.
In the mile bicycle race Charles Frazier
'98, Roper '96, Seybolt '97 and Anfenger
'96 will hold un the cardinal colors. Fra
zier is a fast man from Portland, where he
was looked on as a "star." , His training
has been seriously interrupted, so it is not
known just what he will do to-morrow.
Roper is very fast for a new man, and Sey
bolt of the Garden City Club has done
some creditable riding. Anfenger is a
new man, but has speed and plucK, which
should give him a place.
In the half-mile Smith, Holly and
WalKer, though all new men, have done
conscientious training and are no easy
men to beat. '/?â¢(^
Dave Brown is Stanford's pride for the
mile walk. He holds the coast record of
4:36 for that event and has repeatedly
made it under 4:40 in practice. He is one
of the most devoted trackmen Stanford
has, and it is owing to his efforts as mucn as
to any other student's that Stanford has a
cinder path and a good team. His efforts
have been indefatigable since he entered
the university.
In the mile walk Stanford will have two
good representatives, though both are new
men. Jack '99 is a man of powerful
physique and has shown ' marked aptitude
for the walk. He is credited with having
made the mile under eight minutes in
practice, as is his walking mate Wilkin
son. . 'â â â â â â ' ;.*-.â .; x ':â â â  ;â¢â¢â¢.? -
In the . shot â¢ put Rollin Wilbur, who
now holds the coast record of 40 feet s}_
inches, should break his own mark. He
has done 40 feet 9 inches in trial field days
here and is in first-class condition for the
attempt to-morrow. He also threw 'the
hammer over 125 feet regularly in practice
and has made 128 feet 6 inches with a one
arm throw. ,
Charles Fickert will also throw the ham
mer and; nut. the shot. He is a big, 200
--pound athlete and captain of the football
team. This is his first year in track? ath
letics, but he already throws the hammer
125 feet, and tosses a sixteen-pound shot
over 37 feet. George Hazzard '96 will enter
the hammer throw, and should make 126
feet if conditions are right.
Fisher will: put the . shot, and though
he has been out but a month, has done 37
feet in 'his event. -
Merle Johnson : 97 will enter : the. broad
jump. At present he holds the inter
collegiate coast record of 21 feet 10 inches.'
: In the evening A. M.;Cathcart, J. M.
Ross and H. D. Sheldon will uphold Stan
ford's reputation in the forum.
Cathcart is a senior.whose major studies
are economics *j and 'â â  history. He is well
known as a debater, bavins been ~. on the
winning team against Berkeley two years
ago. His method ."of delivery is vigorous
and; emphatic. ; He is a clear thinker, a
fluent speaker and a clever tactician.
J. M. Ross is calm and deliberate in his
debating, but -a smooth and ready talker.
. A H. D. Sheldon is president of the stu
dent â¢ body, and ?is also : a debater of the
college. y ; He 'has had considerable ex

IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES
How the Barred Lyon Post Del
egates Returned From
Santa Cruz.
FEELING IS VERY BITTER
Even General Barnes Did Not Make
His Expected Plea in Their
Behalf.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
,908 Broadway. April 24. f
The delegates from Lyon Post, G. A. R.,
returned from the department encamp
ment this morning, the first delegation
ever shut out of an encampment in Cali
fornia.
The history of the now celebrated reso
lutions that proved such a boomerang to
Lyon Post has been frequently published
and there is nothing new in that regard.
What is now bothering the members is
what they shall do with their charter when
the post is reinstated. At present the
feeline is general that it should be sur
rendered.
Every member of Lyon Post feels hu
miliated and mortified. They consider
their punishment altogether too severe
after making the apology they did. They
declare that the presumptuous circular
which did their cause so much harm was
not issued by their orders, and the major
ity of the members deprecate its appear
ance.
â¢ It is very evident that the feeling in the
post is very keen. For the first time in
the history of the department the dele
gates of a post have been thrown out.
This action is particularly humiliating
to the past post commanders, who are ex
officio delegates to all encampments. By
not permitting them to be seated they are
deprived of honors conferred upon them
in the past.
On Monday night the veterans will meet
and decide on their future. They seem to
consider that Lyon Post is disgraced for
ever, and that the best thing to do is to
let it die and start anew. The members
do not consider that they have had a fair
deal, but realize that it is useless to kick
any more. National Commander Walker
and Chief of Staff Dietrick came up on the
same train as the barred delegation, and
after they had heard the post's side of the
story, they expressed their sympathy and
said that the apology offered should have
been accepted. The commander's splen
did speech at Santa Cruz was particularly
pleasing to the delegates.
â¢It was stated to-nieht that if Lyon Post
would publicly announce the name of the
men who gave out the resolutions for pub
lication the Dost would be reinstated
by the department commander. Although
there Is much suspicion as to the guilty
party there is no direct evidence, and a
visit to the office of the papers that pub
lished them afforded no satisfaction.
The post is resigned to its fate. It
started out to make a fight against tbe
management of the Yountville home. It
is generally understood that the cele
brated resolutions originated with General
Thompson, a member of Lyon Post, who
was removed from the office of command
ant of the home about the first of the year.
The general says that his report of the
doings of the home justified all he said,
and many members are still of the same
opinion. It was evidently a case of too
much zeal, when a little discretion would
have served the purpose better.
The post had /been led to believe that
their cause would be championed before
the encampment by General Barnes. Tho
general did not appear, and there was
great disappointment, as he had, at the
last encampment, denounced the manage
ment of the home and had tacked all hia
statements with facts.
HISTORY OF A DAT.
Alameda County Happening- Told ln
Short Chapters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, J
908 Broadway, April 24. \
William Harris ana "Handsome" Riley, the
tramp companions of the Mooney brothers,
were sent to the County Jail this morning for
three months on a charge of begging. .
The city taxes are coming in more rapidly
within the past few days, and yesterday nearly
$15,000 was paid into* the city treasury. The
sum includes the tax of the railroad company,
amounting to $6261 58. '-â -.-â â 
The commissioners for the Castro-street
opening have filed their report with the City
Clerk. The damages assessed are $1757 01.
The condemned property is owned by the Pa
cific Improvement Company and is appraised
at $1494. .. yfyy-;:
L. D. Stare's wife pleaded in his behalf thia
morning and Judge Wood, on the motion of
the prosecution, ordered his dismissal. This
is the second time that Stare has beaten his
wife and she has caused his arrest, but on each
occasion she has relented and saved him from
Jail.
On account of the rainy weather the Odd
Fellows have postponed the anniversary pic
nic outlined for to-morrow until some day to
be selected by the executive committee at a
meeting of all the lodges to be held at I. O.
O. F. Hell. Eleventh and. Franklin streets,
Sunday next at 11 a. m.
This morning at an early hour the tailor
shop and the residence of N. Persico at Irving
ton was burned to tbe ground. It was only by
great efforts that the flames were checked in
time to save the adjoining buildings. The
loss is estimated at $6000 and there were
$3200 worth of insurance on the buildings.
The blaze is presumed to be of incendiary
origin. ?...â â . - . . Â . ... +

HAYNE WILL END
NEXT TUESDAY.
At All Events Such Is His
Solemnly Plighted
Word.
AGAINST INJUNCTION.
He Avers That Courts Cannot
Enjoin the Railway
Commission.
MAKES SOME STRONG POINTS.
It Is Contended That the Cases Ex
hibit No Conflict on the Points
Involved.
The pattering raindrops played a lively
accompaniment of birdlike trills and tink
ling arpeggios to Ithe melody of Attorney
' Hayne's well-modulated voice during all
of yesterday's session of the United States
Circuit Court. The gifted barrister was
continuing his long and acutely reasoned
argument in the action of the Southern
Pacific Company against the State Rail
way Commission, and seemed to display
as much fire and incisiveness as at the
commencement of his able plea, if not
more.
"The Railway Commission," he said,
"has two specific powers; one is that of
fixing, establishing and regulating trans
portation rates, the other that of adjudi
cating upon particular cases. This latter
power renders the commission able to en
force its decisions by invoking the aid of
the law's authority in support of its rul
ings. When the law does intervene to
carry out such rulings of the commission
the proceeding is in its nature criminal,
and any disregard of it may be punished
by fine or imprisonment, or both."
Mr. Hayne read a number of cases in
support of this view, one of which, in
sixth Mac-ay's Report?, made such an
impression upon Judge MoKenna's mind
that his Honor tequested that it.be read
over again. The case takes the ground
that it would not be legal or proper for a
court of law or equity to restrain a public
officer in the lawful discharge of his pub
lic duty. This principle, Mr. Hayne con
tended, was applicable to the case at bar,
and preclude the courts from interfering
with the public acts of the Railway Com
mission as long as the commission kept
within the lawful limits of its powers.
Other cases to the same effect were cited
and recommended to the perusal of court
and counsel.
"No injunction can lie, in my opinion,"
continued Mr. Hayne, "since the court
can restrain criminal prosecutions only.
It is insufficient to show that a law is un
constitutional and invalid; it would be
furthermore necessary to show some ma
terial damage to the property before the
courts could intervene. In the case at bar
no such contention is made. In regard to
this principle we can find no conflict
among the cases in the United States Su
preme Court, or even in the State courts,
for that matter. Whatever apparent lack
of concord there may be is only apparent,
and not real. A little study of these cases
is all tbat is required in order to arrive at
a proper notion of the law governing this
present action."
Then followed cases upon cases, each
one cited being graced with a sparkling
commentary.
"And now, your Honor," said the inde
fatigable Hayne, "I have just two more
points to which I desire to invite your at
tention." 'â .-.-' -'â -r*;
"Only two more?" asked the Judge, as
though imagining that his ears deceived
him.
"Only two," assented Mr. Hayne.
"Well," said the Judge, "we will hear
them on Tuesday."
"And I solemnly promise to finish on
Tuesday," said Mr. Hayne, whereat the
Judge and they that were in the court
room marveled, saying:
"Truly Hayne "is about to finish his
argument."
WEDDING PREPARATIONS
Walter Hobart and His Bride
to Spend Their Honeymoon
Abroad.
% Nuptials of Miss Isabel Nash and
Portland G. Hunt at the Occi.
dental Hotel. -
Although the Hobart-Williams engage
ment is comparatively an old story, so
ciety still finds much delight in discuss
ing the details of the approaching nup
tials. The wedding will take place the
latter part of May, probably the 30th, al
though no definite date has yet been de
cided upon. '-''â " -\~- y.
The ceremony is to be conducted with
the utmost simplicity. On account of the
helpless condition of the fair bride's
mother, who for the past sixteen years
has been confined -to her room, the wed
ding is to be celebrated at the Williams
cottage at San Rafael. None but the im
mediate relatives of both the high con
tracting; parties are to be present. The
only attendant of the bride will be her
sister, Miss Juliet Williams, who is to
officiate as maid of honor. Harry Stetson
is to be best man. Contrary to all ex
pectations there is to be no post nuptial re
ception, the happy young ; couple depart
ing immediately after the ceremony for
an ex'tenaed European trip.
Miss Jennie Blair, who was preparing to
leave for Europe to join her brother in his
tour of the Continent, has been obliged to
postpone her visit on account of Mr.
Blair's sudden departure , for home. Mr.
Blair was so homesick that even the gay.
European capitals possessed no charms for
him, and he departed suddenly for - home.
At last accounts he was in New York, and
is expected home daily.
Mrs. Collier and Miss Quita Collier, after
spending a few weeks with E. H. Sheldon,
are now visiting Mrs McCutcheon at her
home in Ross Valley. After a short stay
Mr. and Mrs. Collier wiil be the guests of
Mr. Bowie, previous to their return to
Clear Lake, where tdey have' taken the
Bed Hill ranch for the summer months.
Captain Collier is contemplating the re
building of his Clear Lake home that was
unfortunately destroyed by fire, but it is
improbable that, any work will be begun
before late in. the fall ?. *
.One. of the most delightful events of the
week was the dinner given on ; Thn-Â«day
evening by Mrs. Timothy Hopkins'. The table
decorations were elaborate, and the- menu
of course delicious. Covers were laid for
eighteen.
in the parlors of the Occidental Hotel Thurs
day afternoon Miss Isabel Nash and Portland
G. "Hunt were married, the: Iter. Father Flood
of the Sacred Heart Church being the officiat
ing clergyman. The groom was - supported by
George Dillon as best man, and Miss Lizzie
Pohley officiated as maid of honor.
The" groom, who is a native of Indiana, re
cently returned from an extended visit
throughout the Eastern States. * He Is the busi
ness manager of a leading Market-street house,
and has been prominently mentioned in politi
cal circles.
The bride Is the beautiful and accomplished
daughter of James Nash, formerly of Buffalo,
N.Y. She has resided in San Francisco since
childhood with the exception of two years
spent with her brothers in Seattle.
At the ceremony she wore a Marie
Antoinette 'gown of Persian green silk, shad
ing into pink and gold, and carried a bouquet
of Marechal Neil roses. A diamond sunburst,
the gift of the groom, ornamented her hair.
The maid oi honor was attired in a pearl
gray India chuddah with a' bertha of heavy
Fedora lace. ?-?â â "â %>*.
Among the guests were James Nash and
Mrs. Pohley, the father and sister of the bride,
and Mr. and Mrs. James Kenny.
The ceremony being performed, a repast was
served in one of the private dining-parlors of
the hotel, which was beautifully and artisti
cally decorated with flowers. After a shower
of congratulations from their many friends the
happy couple took the train for Los Angeles
and 'Southern California, : where they will
sojourn a few days, after which they will re
turn to this City, where they will reside.
Mr. and Mrs. D. F. Walker, at their hospit
able country home, Forest Lawn, San Mateo,
on Saturday and Sunday last entertained a
lew of their friends in honor of the birthday
of the genial head of the house. On both aays
the entire outfit of the carriage-house was at
the disposal of the guests, who enjoyed charm
ing drives through the lovely surroundings.
On Saturday evening an elaborate entertain
ment was given, to which were invited many
of the local friends of Mr. and Mrs. Walker. . A
one-act comedy, "The Courier," was very
creditably presented by a company of ama
teurs made up from among the guests. Then
followed dancing,. lnto which the younger
people entered with spirit. A select programme
of musical and literary numbers was rendered
by Mrs. Frances | liT-rgerton, Mrs." D. F. Walker.
Miss Eleanora Connell and F. M. Biggerstuff. A
series of impromptu living pictures was greatly
enjoyed by the company.
A prominent feature of the dainty supper
which followed was a large birthday cake.
This was handed around by Mr. Walker, and
he received many expressions of good wishes
for his health and happiness, j Carl Vandal's
orchestra was in attendance and rendered
choice selections during the evening. Among
those present were: Mr. and Mrs. J. K. Walker

Multitudes daily visit the sumptuous parlors of
PROFESSOR M. L. CARNELLE, 220 EDDY ST.
And why is it? The record made by this greatest
of mediums 7 years ago is reproduced upon his re-
turn, and the grand truths he then expounded left
Indelible imprints on the minds of studious people.
During the years of absence* from our great city
the professor has visited every city of importance,
and has been consulted by' the most eminent ex-
ponents of every art and science. He at all times
invites skeptics to call on nim, and he will con-
vince them that he ls sincere and truthful in all
that be claims to do. â  The professor believes that
"Honesty is the best policy," and desires your con-
fidence on all matters incidental to humanity. If
your existence possesses the many intricacies
which need unraveling he Is prepared to show
you the way. If false friends surround or beset
your path you will find his marvelous powers of
the utmost avail. His vast experience in giving
advice on business, mines, speculations of any
kind, games of chance, changes, lawsuits, wills,
old estates, lost or stolen property; interpreting
dreams, curing bad habits, and guiding you
from all troubles or dangers; also, Indispensable
advice on love, marriage and how to choose a
wife or husband for future happiness or success.
This, together with the work he performs ln re-
uniting the separated, causing a speedy marriage
with the one you dearly love, healing family
troubles, removing- evil influences, etc., is the
safest guarantee that he is once and for all the
most brilliant medium and clairvoyant of modern
times. Thus it is that professional men and so-
ciety leaders seek his advice; thus it is that a
heavy mail Is daily his. The grandest test of all
is to seek him personally and you will find bim to
be the magnetic medium of the people. Letters
with stamps promptly answered. Hours, 9 to 9
daily and Sundays. ; ."-yy.

HART CHARGED
WITH FRAUD.
Mrs. Sarah Carr and Her
Sensational Allega
tions.
WANTS A BIG LEGACY.
â  .',*, ff : '
The Promised Suit Over a Sup
posed Blythe Will Filed
Yesterday.
ffEW START OF AN OLD CASE.
All Lawyers in the Proceeding Prefer
to Remain Reticent Regarding
the Main Facts.
Sarah J. Carr has filed her complaint
(or a share of the Blythe millions, and a
new phase of the famous case has been
commenced. She demands $5000, which
she says was left to her by Thomas Blythe
by will, and she demands interest upon it
from April 4, 1584, the date of Blythe's
death.
W. H. H. Hart is defendant, and his
name figures prominently in the com
plaint in connection with some sensa
tional charges. He is accused of fraudu
lently suppressing and of destroying the
will which Thomas Blythe left behind
him, and all because his contract to secure
for Florence Blythe, the estate of the old
man, for a large percentage of the same
estate might be impaired.
The complaint states that Hart had a
contract with Florence Blythe to secure
for her the $3,500,000 left by Thomas
Blythe, for 25 per cent of what he was able
to win. Thomas Blythe left a will, the
complaint continues, leaving among other
legacies, $5000 to James D. Carr.
Hart, it is alleged, has received in pur
suance of his contract much more than
the legacy.of plaintiff, and so he was made
defendant.
Carr died in Trinity County, Cal., on
February 12, 1894, still in ignorance of any
legacy left to him by Blythe. Since then,
however, his widow has learned of the
will and the legacy, and as administratrix
of her husband's estate she is suing for it.
She prays that it be decreed that Hart
holds $5000 of the estate in trust for her,
together with suitable interest, and that
be be compelled to pay the same over to
her.
Attorneys Pringle and Miller were very
reticent concerning the matters in the
complaint. "We can prove every
allegation in the complaint," said E. J.
Pringle, "but it would be impolitic for me
to disclose our case at this juncture.
Everything alleged in the complaint is
susceptible of proof by reliable witnesses."
B. M. Miller said that though they had
not the original will, they would have no
difficulty in proving its existence and the
accuracy of their copy by reliable wit
nesses. "Just what means were used to
induce the parties having the will in their
possession to conceal it, or how it came to
be destroyed, we are not now in a position
to announce," said he. "It is certainly
very peculiar that Mr. Hart and Mr. Ko
walsky should disagree on such an im
portant matter, as whether or not money
was paid for the suppression of the will.
Mr. Kowalsky says there was. Mr. Hart
says there was not. We will not say at
present.
"Under the will I believe Mrs. Hinckley
would have received more than she has
under the code. There was in the will
provision for some $300,000 in legacies.
This is less than the expenses of the liti
gation which she has undergone. Since
draughting the complaint I have been in
formed that tne percentage of the estate
which Mr. Hart received was not 25 per
cent, but it was very large. There will
be a number of similar suits brought by
other legatees I understand, but lam not
prepared to state this authoritatively."
W. H. H. Hart, when shown the com
plaint, announced that part of the allega
tions were untrue and the remainder he
did not know anything about. "I only saw
this Mrs. Carr two or three times," he
said, "and I never paid her a cent. Ko
walsky must have been drunk when he
stated that I paid her $5000. The will was
brought to us originally soon after the
Sharon case,' in which some one had to
pay a great deal of money for a bogus pa
per and we were a little wary. As soon as
I looked at the paper I was satisfied it was
a fraud.
"At first they claimed they had the
original, but afterward admitted they only
had a copy. In this the Phelan property
was described instead of the Blythe prop
erty, and old man Blythe knew his prop
erty as well as I or any one else does now.
We did not send the will to Mr. Estee, as
was inadvertently stated. It was the par
ties who had it in their possession who
had Mr. Estee investigate the matter, and
he declared there was nothing in it.
Morris M. Estee, when questioned in re
gard to the matter, stated in a deprecating
way that he had looked into the matter a
long time ago, but knew little about it.
He excused himself from telling what
little he did know.
The sea is not of uniform saltness at all
depths, for. the saltness occasionally in
creases with its depth.

the same predicament as the ship Hollin
wood that had to put into a New Zealand
port with her cargo on fire,' and the Brab-'
loch and Alexandra, 'â â â  both , of which had
to be scuttled in this port in order to save
the hulls. | All four vessels loaded coal at
Newcastle, N. ; S. W., and J all caught fire,
but the disaster to the Republic -has. been
complete, while the - Hollinwood escaped
with the loss of half her cargo. The Brab
loch and Alexandra lost all : ; their coal arid
new decks had to be put in, but unless the
Republic is picked . up , by the ; tugs , ; Fear
less and Vigilant she will probably be "a
total loss. a^-A : :-:-Aa *â  ' >'
The voyage â of ... the \ Republic adds an
other story to the long list of thrilling ad
venturers on the sea. She was*? on \ fire; for
five days, and during that time not one of
the crew could go forward and no one had
a chance to sleep. The sides of \ the : ship
grew so hot that no one could touch them,
and 'â  around the foremast â¢' the deck was
burned away. ''? \'_ 'V
Explosions ; were frequent, and. one of
the sailors nearly had bis hand arid'; arm
carried ; away by f a ?; flying â¢ hatch: -;. The
lazarette batch in the \ captain's cabin
blown off, and then -it was shored down, 1
but an 'extra?- heavy explosion -blew ?' the
shores through the roof of < the cabin and
did other damage.
THE SAN FRANCISCO ;; CALL, Â£ SATURDAY, APRIL 25 , 1 896.
During the whole trying time not a man
flinched, and the orders of the captain and
officers were cheerfully obeyed. Several
acts of heroism were performed, but one
in particular stands out prominently.
John Reynolds, an ordinary seaman, and
Ben Foster, an apprentice, volunteered
to go down into the lazarette to secure
some provisions. The gas fumes were
overpowering and both started for the
main deck again. Foster got up all right,
but Reynolds was overpowered and
dropped .back into the hold. Foster did
not hesitate one instant, but, seizing. a
wet * rag, .he put it over his head . and
rushed back into the lazarette. ' He caught
Reynolds around the waist, hoisted him
on his bacK and, as the latter was just
conscious enough to hold on, he got him
I safely on deck. The entire crew was in
deadly peril, but they cheered the gallant
apprentice-boy to the echo.
j Soon after this the British ship Hollin
wood hove insight and Captain Hughes
of tbe Republic signaled, "I am on fire,"
the same flags that the Alexandra set for
the tug Fearless on March 28 last and the
Brabloch for the Vigilant on tbe.7th.inst.
The Hollinwood put her yards aback and
stood by. When the foremast began to
sink and sway backward and forward with
each lurch of the ship the captain thought
it was time to get out, so he lowered his
boats arid rowed for the rescue : vessel.
Once on board the Hollinwood Captain
Hughes discovered that she also had been
on fire and that Captain Kidd had been
compelled to discharge nearly 2700 tons of
his cargo at Port Lyttleton. ':? 'Aa â ';'; .A
The following jis the brief report given
by Captain Seth Hughes to the Merchants'
Exchange. Later, when he had seen 'the
consignees, he was more communicative:
| Sailed from Newcastle, N. S. W., on .Jan
uary 22 with a cargo of 3770 tons of Co-opera
tive coal consigned to J. D. 6preckels & Bros.

heavy explosions of gas took place, blowing off
Nos. 1 and 2 hatches. On -the ,lGth : the ther
mometer registered 120 degrees. Â *' *. ~ Ââ 
I 'The same afternoon I sighted the British
ship Hollinwood - and asked* him r to* keep us
company, as we were on fire and might want
assistance. On the 17th the heat was still in
creasing and several explosions of gas occurred,
and sheets of flames came through the venti
lators and other openings. 'Ihe fire continued
itÂ© gain ground until April 19 at 9 p. m.; in lati
tude 34 deg. 44 mini north longitude, 127 deg.
15 mm. west, it became dangerous J to 'remain
on ' board, v After I several ,' more explosions ". I
decided to abandon the ship. Lowered 'two
boats and went aboard the British ship Hollin
wood. After - leaving the ship saw several
streaks of flames shoot up and the main and
foremast i went over the side. The following
is ( the list V of the erew f rescued:! Captain
Hughes, first ? and second officers, cook . and
steward,' two boatswains, carpenter, sallmaker,

Captain W. R. Kidd â¢of the Hollinwood
made the following report: '
Sailed from Newcastle, N. S. W., on December
B.* We had heavy, weather to December 22. t

found" the' cargo V heated . in . No, 2 ? hatch, the

Sailed from Lyttleton on February 10, and had
light northeast and easterly winds. On April
16, in latitude 34 19. N.. longitude* 132 50 W.,
fell in with the British ship Republic, from
Newcastle, N. S. W., Tor San Francisco. Cap
tain Hughes reported that he was on Are and
asked us to stand by him in case of accident.'
Stayed by him until the 19th of April, when
he had to abandon his vessel and come aboard
my ship. The crew consisted of thirty, all
told. It was very rough at the time and.it
was impossible to ' save the boats they came
with. .-: .'. . '. ' c "f '.
When we last saw the Republic sheets of
flame were coming from the hatches and the
main and fore mast went over the side.
Captain Hughes -is i an old and tried
navigator ! and is -well known in San
Francisco. He said' yesterday: A "On
April 10 the first indication that the
cargo was on fire was given. Thin spiral
columns of smoKe began to creep out of
the ? fore /hatch. 1 ordered it opened up
arid ' found the thermometer registering
57.58? degrees. All the men were put to
work and several streams of water' were
turned into the hold. For nearly a week
we worked morning, noon: and night, but
the fire gained on us in spite of all we
could do. :.f' '"'-"''"' ~ ; '.''.~..' ''â 
j "On April 15 the fore and main hatches
b'ew off and Dick Jones had his hand and
arm injured by one of r ; the C hatches 'and
badly burnt by the flames. :. After.' that
the -coal gas kept going off at intervals,
and everybody was driven aft, as it was
impossible to live in the forecastle. - The
boats were got out, but an attempt to pro
vision them failed,. and the men could not
get any of j their clothing. All we had to
live on was aft in the cabin, and. had we
been compelled to abandon the ship with
out j assistance being ;at hand we would
have been in a terrible predicament. -V.
| "On the 16th inst. : the Hollinwood hove
in sight, and ' although the thermometer
then registered 120 degrees I j-till^had
hopes of saving -my ship. We were then
only a little over 250 miles from San Fran
cisco; and given a fair wind I could -easily
have made * port. At this, time .it; was
rainy, squally and a high sea. was running.
I.'signaled'/ the Hollinwood to stand-by
me, which Captain Kidd did. '
I "On the 19th inst. the foremast began to
sink, and the decks were so hot ' that we
could barely stand it. "T, gave orders to
abandon the â . ship and .at 5 p. m. we â  went
away ; in our own boats. r . Early .on' the
morning of I the : 20th \ inst. the â  foremast
went by the , board, and the A fall lit up ] the
sky for j miles around, r About 7 a. m. the
mainmast followed the foremast and took
the mizzen royal with it. Two hours later ')
we could still see the smoke and the livid
glare, but the hull* of the ship we never
saw again. Captain Kidd treated us with
every kindness and we reached .port.'yes- 1

voyage: .; "We â  had a cargo of West Wall

signaled j" -I must j abandon ' her, as the fire:
is now dangerous.' I laid the Hollinwood
to land! waited A for his | boats. A Only two

had to make two trips in order to get the

blazed at intervals all night, and when the
flames would shoot along they, would make
.the [.scene [as [light as day. At 3:15 a. m. on

board, and at â¢ 5:30 a. m. the mainmast fol
lowed. By 'this â¢ time 1 saw there was no
use in standing by the burning vessel, so
| proceeded an my. course. Two hours later
we could I still.; see the : smoke from the'
burning derelict."
. Chief Officer W. Williams has very little
to add to the statement made by Captain
Hughes. "Everything possible was done
to save the ship," said he, : "but the fates
were against us. We had provisions on
deck, but the fire and smoke ruined them,
and then -again we could not get them,
bad as they were, into the boats. The sea
was running mountain high in an un
broken swell, and we had to make a jump,
one at a time, to get into. the boa;;. The
men were loyal to the last, and when' Ben
Foster went back j into the cazarette to
rescue John Reynolds they cheered him
again and again.' All the vessels leaving
Newcastle, N. S. W., seem to be playing
in" bad luck.' The ship Knight of St. Mi
chaels, bound for South America, . was
compelled to put into Sydney with her
cargo heated. She was fixed up and -is
now on her way again."
"I never want another such experience
in mine again," said H. T. Jensen, one of
the crew. "I left the Alexandra' in Syd
ney, and she just managed to reach port.
Now I find I had almost a similar experi
ence on the Republic. â¢ The .heat and the
smoke and the gas were something awful,
and the only chance we haa for a rest was
to lie down on the poop deck. .When we ]
reached the Hollinwood * we all heaved a
sigh of relief, but when we heard that she
also had been on fire our confidence waned
a little. lam sorry that the Republic is
gone, but I'm more than glad to be back
on the front again."

AN UNPLEDGED
DELEGATION
C. F. Reed Thinks Only
Such Should Go to
St. Louis.
WOULD DO MORE GOOD.
If Sent Otherwise the Delegates
Will Be Mere Figure
heads.
CANNOT ACT INTELLIGENTLY.
McKinley Might Be Thrust Aside as
Blame Was When Hayes Was
Nominated.
The sentiment in favor of an unpledged
delegation to St. Louis seems to be gain
ing daily in California.
Charles F. Reed of Auburn, Placer
County, the notable Republican leader
and delegate to many National conven
tions in times past, is one of many Repub
licans opposed to pledging the delegation.
Mr. Reed has a rare fund of information
regarding the political occurences of Cali
fornia and the Nation. He was asked last
night what he thought about pledging the
California delegation to any Presidential
candidate.
.'.'l don't think anything of it," said Mr.
Reed. "To my mind, if a delegation is
sent in this way it will be tying it hand
and foot and making a nonentity out of it.
At the best such delegates would be mere
figureheads. They couldn't do anything
if the circumstances should change, as it is
always liable to do at any convention, and
they would have no power.
â¢ "Elect good men, men of intelligence,
character and probity, and then let them
go and do the best they can. The party
platform is sufficient. The delegates have
to act in a manner consistent with that,
and that is enough.
"An intelligent man should surely have
some latitude outside of that. If you tie
the delegation up you rob it of its real
power.
"I remember well the time that General
Hayes was nominated. It was supposed
that Blame would be the nominee, beyond
a doubt, but he wasn't. I only mention
this anent the candidacy of Mr McKin
ley, who is supposed now to have the larg^
est support. There is no certainty about
McKinley, any more than there was about
Blame. At present he appears to be th*
choice, the same as Blame was.
"There are so many contesting delega
tions, State and National, that I look for a
[ very warm National Convention. I would
not be surprised at all if it got to be red hot.
"No delegation should go there tied up.
It won't receive the respect it would other
wise or have anything like the influence.
â¢ "lam for any good Republican and be
lieve we can elect whoever we nominate.
I am only desirous personally that the'
delegation be sent in such a way that it
may accomplish the most good for Cali
fornia and the coast. In my judgment an
unpledged delegation can best do this."
