"OLD SMOOTHING IRON'S" WORK
â : ' â â 
Meanwhile the Legislature Is Vainly
Struggling to Elect a United
States Sena or.
â¢ FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 10.â This is
expected to be the most interesting week
of the session of the Legislature and it is
claimed will see the end of the prolonged
Senatorial deadlock. The contest cases
mayb e taken up to-morrow.
Republicans have been discussing a new
scheme to-day. Governor Bradley would
issue a proclamation calling the Legisla
ture to meet in Louisville in one of the
large opera-houses there and the session
of the Legislature would continue until
the election of a Senator was effected.
There, it was argued, there would be
ample' police protection not afforded here.
This story was denied by officials, but
comes from unquestionable authority.
There were 102 members present in the
joint assembly to-day, and Hunter once
more came within one vote of an election.
This happened as the result of a pair be
tween Senator Ogilvie (D. and Represent
ative Poore (Pop.), who were absent. The
vote stood: Hunter, 51; Blackburn, 46;
scattering, 5. Necessary to a choice, 52. ;
It was rather late to-day before the Legis
lature got to work, and not a great
'deal was ' done when 'they did. The
rollcalls showed- a very slim attend
ance, considering the importance of
4 tbe matters ; before such body. 'â  Be
fore, it.' ; was finished some., oth-
ers came in and had: their presence
recorded. Others did not make their ap
t*arance until, after the second relay of
-/rains came in. A "good~mnny of those
,who went down to Louisville wore a very
tired '.Took and soon .were resting in the
cozy scats under the . gallery, in the cloak
room and other places. Others more in
different and inclined to consult their own
comfort before anything else, after seeing
that their "presence was not indispensable.
went off to their respective roomsproba
bly to count their washing. They bad
evidently been to the laundry and "Old
Smoothing Iron" had the machine too
well greased or greased a little too free.
Anyhow, the boys looked a bit.tired, espe
cially those who were not- down the week
before.
Of course, the Senatorial contest is para
mount to everything else, but when the
"Colton letters" of twenty years hence
are published they will very probably
show that the election of a United States
Senator from Kentucky in the year 1896
was influenced in no small degree by the
fact that a bili to repeal the charter of the
Southern Pacific Railroad was pending in
the Legislature at the same time, and also
that on Sunday, February 9, in the city of
Louisville, a good many points of diffi
culty were mooted over. A good many of
those, who made the trip hardly know
â¢'where they are at" as yet, let; alone what
they did, where they went and whom they
saw, or. rather, who saw them, and don't
want to 7 talk about it anyway "Got a
headache."
Others who are reported to have some
hand in arranging things have clear
heads, broad smiles, and a prompt and
apparently hearty assurance that they are
all well, had a splendid time, never felt
better, saw all the boys, but "don't know a
single thing new," "always drop shop
when I leave Frankfort on Saturday till I
get back on Monday." ' You are just
bound to believe them. They are so open
and frank about everything/and so good
natured, too, even when you put ques
tions to them. Some of them are real
good: fellows, and could account for every
moment they Spent while away, and every
nickel too â not so difficult a matter, as the
trip cost them nothing from start to finish.
This recess is to be remembered arid the
plans laid and the work done by the sev
eral sets of schemers who have contests on
foot will begin be shown in the next few
day..
It is needless to say that Huntington's
men have not been idle during the time,
and that they were -not uncivil or. penur
ious: in their treatment of such of the
Louisville party as were their guests,
whether they had wine at the Gait House
or the Pendennis or elsewhere. They ; are
thoroughly posted on the situation, under
stand human nature in general â â¢ and the
special nature of the particular members
they want, to see do right, and. know, just
how to i diagnose . and treat each case, arid
they got in some fine work on this trip. ;
Senator Goebel ' was fully alive to * the
situation and went down to Louisville
with the rest of them. He was one of the
first to show up v this a morning, : and as ; far
as could be judged from a casual observa
tion he had not been '-.- treated to an "iron
ing." In 7 fact, it is said that he was ; not
even invited to call at the 'aundry, and of
course the manager, would not go down to
the Alexander Hotel and face all the mem
bership of the "patchwork 7club"; -just to
see if. Goebel 's : bosom needed attention.
He is generally so watchful and attentive,*
however, tbat his failure in this instance
to lock after business must .be due to the
fact that he was advised that Goebel did
not like his way of "doing up" things. ' "
Whatever is the reason, the old general
certainly wasted no 7 lime .with.-. Senator
Goebel. There : was : more than the -usual
activity among his lieutenants.' They all
recognize, the situation a. a' serious-one
and are doing everything in their power to
The San Francisco Call.
meet the occasion, which is full of uncer
tainties for them, but while there is life
there is hope, and they are untiring and
active. The fact that Goebel- was the
president pro tern of the Democratic Sen
ate, cnairman of the Democratic Judiciary
Committee" of that body, and chairman of
the Democratic steering committee, was
made the most of by him with the Repub
lican members for a time, but that don't
go any longer. While the Senatorial fight
is on the members refuse to put this repeal
bill on the same plane.
H. M. Jones, chairman of the Republican
caucus, Judge Landes and other leaders
the very best men on that side of the
Houseâ are in favor of the repeal bill, and
they will command a pood following. So
anything that is done in the way. Of trad
ing must be done inside each party's coun
cils. This was foreshadowed last) week.
; and when the dropping of Blackburn or
Hunter comes, yon may be assured that
General Duke or St. John Bogle have
already advised Echols that things are go
ing along. That they. have given up the
hope of preventing the passage of the bill
in the Senate is conceded, but the plan will
be to delay it until they are ready for it to
go to the House, and no one can tell when
they will be ready.
* It will be some time yet before the regu
lar order will call it up in the Senate, and
to call it up would be useless, as the oppo
sition has an objection ready from each
end and the center of the room.
Mr. Huntington's efforts to create an
opposition to the bill are not confined to
his Frankfort lobby. Men in different sec
tions of the State on whom he has greater
or less hold have been sending personal
letters to their own representatives and
others of their acquaintance- urging them
to defeat the ..ill.
John J. McHenry, the son of one of the
incorporators named in the charter of the.
Southern Pacific Company and the brother
of another, who is interested in a bank and
also the extensive coal mines at McHenry,
in- Ohio County, about 116 miles from
Louisville, is interesting himself in the
matter in this way: Huntington has told
him to do it and he obeys, because his
mining interests are at the mercy of the
railroad company. He . has been through
the tire before and knows the price
I of disobedience, and if he can help it is
not going to subject himself to the tender
mercies of General Echols, who, ' people
say, is cruel when he has been offended.
It â¢is a ' good thing for the bill that all the
members of tne â  Legislature don't live on
Huntington's lines, nor on the Louisville
and Nashville, either, for that matter, as
there is no: question about that mighty
corporation standing with the Southern
Pacific Company in this tight. The pres
ence of its salaried officers and regular at
torney 'here lobbying against the bill
proves this. But with all their influence
and all their lobbying, they will not be
able to stop the bill if thines go on as they
are. unless some great scheme is concocted
and put into execution.
. Goebel started the ball of 'sentiment for
repeal rolling, and as it goes along it
gathers and grows each day. General
Duke stopped many a stampede among
his men >' during" the late unpleasantness,
and that rignt in the face of the enemy,
but he has: his hands full now. V The Gen
eral looks' a little worn to-day, and if it
lasts much longer, will have to take a rest.

Attempts to Conceal California's Action
â¢ on the Heilly Mill. ;
3 WASHINGTON, D. C.; Feb. 10.â It was
discovered 'by one of J California's State
Senators here to-day that the resolution
adopted by the California Legislature last
February; protesting against the passage
of the refunding bill was either willfully or
negligently omitted from the California
statutes and reports. l{'xiX
Neither does it appear in the Congres
sional Record, or any document to be found
at the Capitol, with the exception of the
following brief paragraph in the Record :
"By ' Mr. Maguire^-Ay memorial by the
Legislature of .California protesting against
the passage of the Reilly funding. bill. To
the Committee on the Pacific Railroads."
Maguire says he remembers receiving
these resolutions by wire from the clerk
of the Legislative Assembly of California,
and he presented" them* in the House.
Such resolutions -are never printed in full
unless they are read to the House.
He is under the impression that he read
them in the course of his speech when the
Reilly bill was being considered. He can
not understand, however, .why they were
not included in the volume of California
statutes and resolutions passed, by the
California Legislature. â¢". â â >..'

LONDON, Eng., Feb. 10.â speech
from the throne, which will be read at the
opening of Â» Parliament to-morrow, was
read at the Queen's speech banquets, given
by Lord Salisbury and the Right Hon. A.
J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury,
respectively, at 20 Arlington street and 10
Downing street, this evening. The speech
makes no reference whatever . to the sub
ject of arbitration of the Venezuelan ques
tion.
The speech announces that the measures
to be introduced' by the Government will
include an employer's limited liability bill,
a measure for i the creation of voluntary
schools; an Irish land bill for the forma
tion of an Irish 7 board of agriculture for
the relief of agricultural distress, a bill for
the regulation of alien pauper immigra
tion^ and a measure for the construction of
of light railways for.the rural districts.
The speech sets forth that the relations
of Great Britain with foreign powers are
satisfactory, recapitulates the known facts
of the Transvaal trouble, alludes to the
necessity for an X increase of the naval
strength of England arid refers to the
dispute between Great Britain and Vene
zuela and the negotiations with the United
States in regard thereto as pending in ex
actly the same terms as vaguely outlined
in 7 Saturday .United: Press dispatches,
which 1 stated X that ' the Government of
Gr-eat Britain 7 had under consideration
proposals that offer a prospect of a more
peaceful solution of the dispute. ,
The speech also recites the facts of the
massacres and disturbances in r Armenia.
While it deplores the excesses which have
been committed, it says, that some r degree
of satisfaction, is to be found in the Sul
tan .; promises to institute reforms, but
avoids any indication of the future policy
of England in regard to Turkey. 7
* Her Majesty congratulates' the country
upon" the success of the 1 bloodless opera

of the expedition. ry . -
' X No importance is attached to the absence;
of any reference to : arbitration of the Ven

cians ; expected : that any 7 reference would ;
be made to the subject for the reason th a t
the speech is never the 7 medium of merely
incipient developments. 7 '
L The . representative of the -United Press
learns that Prime Minister 7 Salisbury arid;
the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, First Lord
of the Treasury, have f prepared a carefully
guarded statement, which they will make
in the House of Lords {arid House of Com
mons early in the debate on the address in
reply, to the Queen's speech, affirming the
willingness of the Government to arbitrate
the question of the , territory that is not oc
cupied by British settlements. ,( -- :
." Opinion in the Liberal Club grows every
day more intense lin favor of closing the
dispute on any terms consonant with na

Ministers are not likely to be satisfactory
to the Liberals, it is believed that Sir Wil

Commons, t will 1 move *an \ amendment to
the address affirming . that Â» arbitration "b*7

Spain is fortifying Havana for any emer
gency that may arise. Recently four coast
defense puns of about sixty tons each: ar
rived from Spain. They are now being
moved along temporary tracks to the
Santa Clara battery, the ; most modern of
Havana's fortifications. This battery is
built in a rocky hill between the city and
the sea. It is about one mile west of Moro
Castle. It commands the approach of ves
sels from the north and west, while a bat
tery beyond . Moro does similar service
toward the east. Neither of these bat
teries commands the land approaches, or
can even point a gun toward the city itself.
Of all of Havana's forts these are the only
ones containing modern guns. The man
ner in which they are being strengthened
shows that Spain" is preparing for others
than the insurgents. '7 */ . '< 7. 7
When the news of the action of the Com

prominent political leaders said to me:
"We are preparing for any emergency.
Tell that to the people of the United
States. : .Go down to La Mac h yourself
and tell them what guns we are unloading
and placing in our forts." A glance at
some of the big guns around Havana is
disappointing if one looks for strength.
Most of the guns are half "a century old,
some are still more ancient, and for active
service they are 7 practically 7 worthless.
The few modern guns here would be effect

PASSING OF A
SOQUEL PIONEER
John Daubenbiss Helped to
.' Make California
History.
ARGON AUTED IN 1842.
Was Present When Commodore
Sloat Raised the Flag at
Monterey.
FIRST MILLER IN THE STATE,
He Supplied the Piles for the Long
Wharf Built in San Francisco
in 1846.
' SANTA CRUZ, Cal. , Feb. 10.â The
death of John Daubenbiss, which occurred
at his Soquel home late last night, marks
a page in the history of California that
tells of the days of a pioneer of pioneers.
He came to America from his birthplace,
Bavaria, in 1835, and six years later crossed
the plains to Oregon and to California in
1842. His first home in this State was at
San Jose in 1843, whence he removed to
what is now Soquel in Santa Cruz County
in 1845. Two years later he bought a farm,
on which he had' made his home ever
since. 1 ,"
' Daubenbiss was in the Mexican war
under Fremont, and at the raising of the
American flag at Monterey in 1846 he car
ried the message from Commodore Sloat to
General Sutter at Sutters Fort, announc
ing that fact. Mr. Daubenbiss was a
member of he first Board of Supervisors
of this county. The county was formed
in 1851 and conducted by the court of ses
sions until 1852, when the new board went
into operation. ' Only one of that original
board now servive, Elihu Anthony.
Daubenbiss got out the timbers for the
piles in "Long wharf" at Sari Francisco,
the first that was built in that City, in
1846, and which was then at the foot of
Commercial street. He built the first grist
mill in California, at Niles station, near
San ; Jose Mission, in 1845, for General
Vallejo,' and the first sawmill in the State
at Soquel in 1847. :
He was married at San Jose about tha
time settled aty'SpqueL His wife died
in IS9I, Three r, sons and three daughters
surviveâ Charles, Frank and Frederick
Daubenbiss and Mrs. Rachel ! Swan, Mrs.
Florence Bedell and Mrs.' Kate Roberts.
The last named two live in the East. The
others were present last r night rat their
father's deathbed. '-' '
â¢ Mr. Daubenbiss died of general debility.
He was 80 years of age and had been vig
orous and active up to a year ago, when
he began failing, though not quite a sick
man until within the past ten days.' The
funeral will occur to-morrow - afternoon
under the auspices of the Masons, attended
by the Naval Reserve, Pioneers and Na
tive Sons. Religious services will be con
ducted by Rev. Mr. Snyder of the Soquel
Congregational Church.
IX A DAXGERitUS COXDITIOX.
Portion of Santa Cruz's X'ew Courthouse
'XX-XXX.-J.-/:- Must Be Rebuilt.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. Work
men on the new courthouse were to-day
called off 7by Contractor McCabe because
of a dangerous defect in construction. Ar
chitect Comstock's specifications provided
for, and there were placed, fou r,iron pillars
to support the two walls of the tower,
which extends above the two walls of the
main, corridor. These tower walls set
clear of the corridor, and being very heavy
caused one of the iron pillars to bend until
the walls settled into a dangerous condi
tion. Evidently this offset of the tower
walls was made to accommodate doorways
from the upper corridors to rooms on the
second floor. These pillars have been in '
plain view all the time, but their weakness
was not noticeable â¢ until this morning.
The foreman of the .Western Iron Works
of San Francisco joined Contractor , Mc-
Cabe in refusing to put on the roof until
these walls shall be strengthened and made
safe. The ' work will require a delay, but
is is hoped it will not prevent the occu
pancy of the building by the time required
by law, in April.
PROTECTIOX AGAIXST FIRE.
Santa Crue Will Build a , Sub- Reservoir
to the City Water Works.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 25.â The City
Council to-night adopted a resolution to
build a sub-reservoir for the City Water
Works, to cost about ; $6000. This matter
had hung fire in the Council for tbe past
year or more. .It is claimed by two Coun
cilmen, whp voted for the resolution, that
the conflagration of one year ago, burning
a block of i buildings and the Courthouse,
could have , been controlled had * the reser
voir been built 7 before. The two Council
men who voted against it did so because of
lack of fund*. Mayor Effey voted to settle
the tie, adopting the resolution.
. The : Council > also _ straightened out the
bicycle ordinance, so that will not conflict
with the charter, thus avoiding the trouble
that occurred 7, when Benjamin Martin,
Deputy County Clerk, tested, the validity
the law, which provided a penalty of
fine and i imprisonment. The penalty" will
now be fine and imprisonment.

SMITH' DEFENDS
THE PRESIDENT.

Not in Accord With
His Colleague
ON MONROE DOCTRINE.
Strongly Opposes the Adoption of

Resolutions.

The Secretary of Agriculture Said to

i
â -'-..
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.â A joint
resolution was introduced in the Senate
to-day by Cameron (R.) of Pennsylvania,
and after its first and second reading was
laid on the table to be called up hereafter,
"earnestly recommending the good offices
of the United States to the favorable con
sideration of the Spanish Government for
the recognition 01 the independence of
Cuba."'
A speech in relation to the Monroe doc
trine was made by Smith (D.) of New Jer
sey. He declared himself opposed to the
resolution offered by his colleague, Sewell
(R.) of New Jersey, which declared the
President's Venezuelan message inoppor
tune, equally opposed to that reported
from the Committee on Foreign Relations
by Senator Davis (R.) of Minnesota, ex
tending the application of the Monroe
doctrine, and as having little sympathy
with the position assumed by Senator
Wolcott of Colorado.
The remainder of the day. was spent in
the discussion of the joint resolution di
recting the Secretary of Agriculture to
purchase and distribute seeds for the year
1896. A final vote was not reached.
Cameron (R.) of Pennsylvania intro
duced, a joint resolution relative to "the
termination of the war in Cuba. The reso
lution provides that "as it appears there
are no moans of securing permanent peace
in Cuba except by the recognition of its
right to self-government, the good offices
of the United States are earnestly recom
mended to the favorable consideration of
the Spanish Government of the recognition
of the independence of Cuba."
The resolution was read a first and sec
ond time and laid on the table for the
present.
Senator Quay's resolution to recommit
the House tariff bill with the free-coinage
amendment to the Finance Committee for
further consideration was laid before the
Senate, and, on the suggestion of Gorman,
Quay consented to let it go over until to
morrow.
Smith then addressed the Senate in op
position to the resolution offered by his
colleague (Sewell), as well as to the reso
lution reported by Davis on the subject of
the Monroe doctrine.
Smith at the outset said he was opposed
to the adoption of the resolutions intro
duced by bis colleague and he was quite as
strongly opposed to the adoption of the
resolutions introduced by the Senator from
Minnesota and reported in an amended
form by the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, and, supplementing these two asser
tions with the remark that : he had very
little sympathy with the position assumed
by the Senator from Colorado, Smith gave
his reasons for his attitude in the matter.
He said: â ' X Â
"There is no occasion for any action of
any kind upon this subject by this body at
this time. We have done all that either
prudence can justify or patriotism de
mand. We have met the situation out
lined to us by the President in such a
manner as to show that there is no divi
sion of sentiment in the Government of
the United States when any ' question of
National honor is involved. By entering
upon a discussion of what we have al
ready done and by reopening the question
which we have already answered we would
only succeed in nullifying, or at least qual
ifying, the action we have already taken."
The Senator then proceeded, in justifica
tion of his assertion, to present the facts
as contained in the message of the Presi
dent of December 17: "The deductions
therein by the President, that it was the
duty of the United States, in its own inter
est and for its own protection, to determine
the rightful location of the divisional line
and other points leading to the ' appoint
ment of the commission." "V
Smith asserted his inability to agree 1
with his colleague where he says that
"this action was â¢ premature and inoppor
tune in view of the business and financial
condition of the country, and,"', continued
Smith, "if any act of a President of the
United States involved National honor or
National disgrace can only be taken with
propriety when the business and financial
condition of the country is such as to war
rant it, then great indeed must be the in
dignation of my colleague when he con
templates the conduct of George "Wash
ington, James Madison, and above all, the
many and most 'inopportune' acts of
Abraham Lincoln."
Referring to the recent speech .of Sena
tor Wolcott of Colorado. Smith suggested
that while no harm can result from laud
ing the deeds of English sailors and Eng
lish soldiers, he (Smith) preferred to con v
templete the achievements of Washington,'
of Greene, of Putnam, of Allen, of Jack
son, of Paul Jones, and even of Lafayette,
to those of Clive. Nelson and the others,
whose acts have made so deep an impres
sion upon the mind and heart of the Sena
tor from Colorado.
"This country, sir," he continued, "owes
nothing to England ; if the ties of kindred
have been broken, she was the aggressor.
From the very; beginning of the attempt
of the noble man who achievea American
independence to the present day, the atti
tude of Great Britain toward this! Nation
has been one; first, of contempt and then 1
of hostility; then of submission to force of
arms, and since that time of ever increas
ing jealousy, until it has become the part
of wisdom 7 and prudence ; to assume the
condescending:, and 7 patronizing -: attitude
perfectly typified in the language of . Lord
Salisbury in his letter to our Secretary of
State, and I consider the assertion that we
owe gratitude to such a . power a perver
sion of history for purposes of eloquence."
Referring . to ' the ; resolution ' submitted \
upon behalf of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, Smith opposed its : adoption
la the ground that there is no occasion or
necessity for such definition of the Monroe
doctrine at this time. Continuing, the
Senator declared J .y7lv
. "That ringing message of the President
of the United States, promptly supported
by the unanimous vote of ; bothy bouses of
Congress and by, the unanimous sentiment
of the country, is sufficient notice to every
power in the civilized world that the Mon
roe doctrine is a fixed principle of this Gov
ernment to be maintained in all cases and
at all hazards."
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky gave notice of
an amendment to the House tariff bill,
proposing to repeal the provision of the
present tariff law, which provides a duty
of one-eighth of a cent per pound on all
sugars above No. 16 Dutch standard and
on all discolored sugars.
The Senate then resumed , consideration
of the joint resolution directing the : Secre
tary of Agriculture to purchase ," and dis
tribute ' seeds, and Vest (D.) of Missouri
addressed the Senate in support of the
joint resolution and in condemnation of
the course pursued by Secretary Morton. i
That gentleman, he said, in a newspaper
interview invited impeachment by Con
gress and intimated that if Congress
passed the joint resolution the President
would veto it. The Secretary and his
friends attacked Congress and charged
that the seed distribution was used for
personal and selfish purposes, but the fact
should be made known .that the Secre
tary, himself had used that legislation
more largely and unhesitatingly than any
member of Congress had", ever endeavored
to do. This was proved by the table in
the Secretary's annual report for 1,894-95, !
showing that 278,000 papers of seeds had 1
been sent to . the State of Nebraskaâ
Secretary's State â more than the State
was entitled 10. â¢
: Vest gave additional figures from the ta
ble referred to showing an unfair distribu
tion of seeds, largely in favor of Nebraska,
and said: "If this law has been prosti
tuted for personal purposes, who has gone'
further in that direction than the Secre
tary of Agriculture?"
He concluded by offering a substitute for
the joint resolution. It authorizes and di
rects the Secretary of Agriculture to pur
chase and distribute valuable seeds for the
year 1896 as has been "done in previous
years, but not to pay more than a reason
able and fair price for any of them. .
Bate (D.) of Tennessee defended the Sec
retary of Agriculture from "the onslaught
made upon him," and expressed the belief
that Secretary Morton had carried out the
law toils fullest extent. '
Gray (D.) of Delaware said that he had
examined the law relating to seeds, and
that the interpretation given it by the Sec
retary of Agriculture and the Attorney-
General was correct. '
The bill went over without action.
The Senate proceeded to the considera
tion of executive business. When the
doors were reopened a message from the
House of Representatives announcing the
death of Representative . Cram of Texas
was laid before the Senate.
Mills (D.) of Texas offered resolutions
expressive of the deep sensibility with
which the Senate had heard the announce-
ment of Mr. Cram's death and for the ap
pointment of a committee of three Sen
ators to join the House committee to take
orders for superintending the funeral.
The resolutions were agreed to and Sen
ators Mills (D.) of Texas, Gallinger (R.) of
New Hampshire and Frye (R.) of Maine
were appointed.
The Senate then, as a further mark of
respect, at 3:10 adjourned until to-morrow.
GRIEVANCES OF RED MEN
General Council of Ogallala In
dians to Send Delegates to
Washington.
A Great Powwow and F feast Held on
the Wounded Knee Battle
field.
DEADWOOD, S. D., Feb. 10.â The gen
eral council of the Ogallala Indians . con
vened to-day at Red Dog's camp, or the
village on Wounded Knee Creek, about
thirty miles north of Pine Ridge, accord
ing to programme, for the purpose of se
lecting delegates to send to Washington to
confer with the President and Interior De
partment concerning matters relating to
the treatment of the Indians. The coun
cil is largely, attended, almost every Indian
and mixed .blood being present, and the
greatest harmony prevails. It is thought
that ho difficulty i will be - encountered in
selecting the delegates and raising funds
to defray, their expenses. The head chief
presided and secretaries were chosen.
To-day's proceedings consisted chiefly
in formulating ' a list of grievances to be
presented and a general interchange :. of
views relating to the same. The principal
grievances are as to the manner of pro
cedure against criminals and the issuance
of annuities. . The Indians claim that in
the treaty of 1877 it was provided that the
crime of murder and the graver offenses
against the whites should be tried under
the general laws of the United States, but
that trivial offenses : and cases where the
Indians alone are involved should be tried
before '. the Indian police ; judges, whereas
tbis treaty obligation has been violated
and takes them off the reservation, often
hundreds of miles, entailing expense and
suffering. They will ask for the annuities
to be paid in cash, instead of clothing and
supplies.
They want a strip of land in Nebraska
and the southern boundary of /.South
Dakota, which is now five by ten miiles,
extended along the line for. 100 miles.
They did not know at the time of the
treaty that 1 there was gold in the Black
Hills and they will ask for more money
for the hills. They want a lawyer to
represent them in all legal matters.
: ; In the interest of education and morals
the school-children . are forbidden â¢: to
engage in certain .. dances, and there is
some dissent to this as an infringement of
their . rights. There is not a scadow of
hostility on the reservation. Major Clapp,
who su cceeded . Captaih Penny as agent,
has tbe Indians well under control.
The council was held in a large, round,
log Omaha dancehouse located on the sum
mit .* of-jyar" hill in y the midst 'X of
hundreds - : of v white tepees and _on : - the
battlefield â¢ of fr Wounded . Knee. â¢/.' In 7 the
center of the _ council-room -a .: huge i fire
burned. Around it were 125 black kettles,
in which the bodies of 200 dogs were
'Stewing. *"

sudden and unexpected death of Repre

to. die in the course of a session of the
Fifty-fourth Congress, announced to the
House by.Sayres (D.) of Texas, caused an
adjournment after the House reassembled

In the morning session, a continuation

and McDearmon (D.) of Tennessee and
Skinner (Pop.) of North Carolina in favor
of it. -,_:-..-
When the house resumed its session at
10:30 o'clock this morning Hainer (R.) of
Nebraska opposed the free coinage substi
tute of the Senate. He asked why this
debate was carried on in the face of the
fact that every one knew that the proposi
tion in the bill could not be crystallized
into a law, and the debate tended to in
crease the disquiet. ;*;;*':
McDearmon (D.) of Tennessee, speaking
in favor |of | the Senate substitute, advo
cated the coinage of the seigniorage of the
bullion in the treasury.
In view of Cram's death, Dingley (R.) of

WASHINGTON, "D.. C, Feb. 10.-An
arrangement, it is said, has been made in
the . Senate whereby Quay is to withdraw
bis resolution to recommit the tariff bill,
and the vote will be taken on; the bill and
substitute as it was reported to the Senate
by the committee. 7. Morrill, chairman of
the Finance Committee, has given notice
that he would call , the bill up Wednesday
and seek to make it the unfinished busi
ness. Republicans have little fear of the
free-silver substitute being favorably acted
upon, but they see no hope of the ultimate
passage of the House bill, or any other
tariff provisions.
According to statements made this after
noon by a prominent Republican member
of the committee, : thirteen or fourteen
anti-silver Democrats will vote against
the free-coinage substitute, and all the
silver Republicans will vote ; against it, .
with the possible â  exception of Teller and
Mantle. Bet when the tariff ; bill is thus
divorced from 7 the silver question, it is
asserted that the \ combined vote of ; the
Democrats and the Populists will be cast
in favor of a motion to table the bill, and
this may.defeat.it. XX '- X
MR. JUORTOX 'EXPLAINS.
Why the Secretary Sent an Extra Quota
of Seed to Xebraska. /
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.â
ferring to the charge of Senator Vest that
the ; Secretary of Agriculture 'bad dis
tributed 1150, 000; more packages of seed in
Nebraska than that State was entitled to
last year, Secretary Morton says:
"Under the law one-third of all the seed
purchased was to be distributed by the
Secretary of Agriculture. In accoi dance
with that provision, some years ago, when
there was great suffering along the sea
islands of the Carolina V coast, the Secre
tary of Agriculture, through Clara Barton
and the Red Cross, gave a great portion of
the seeds which he was authorized to dis
tribute to the people where fields and gar
dens had been ruined by the tidal wave.
As to that very large distribution of seed
to those Southern sufferers -no 'complaint
was made. Therefore, : during the recent
seasons of extreme drought in the North
west the Secretary of Agriculture frankly
confesses that he gave far more ' than the
normal quota of seed to Nebraska, Kansas
and each of the Dakotas and to Oklahoma."

Bargar coming up immediately was ar
rested with . the negro . and taken to the
Zacapa jail. Mr. Morgan testified that
Bargar was not a witness to the shooting
and he was let go under bond that he
would appear as a witness. In three days,
however, he was rearrested, and although
no charge was preferred he was sent to jail.
"The weather was extremely hot, and
the heat in the jail was stifling," said Mr.
Bargar. â  "There were about 100 prisoners
in the jail, and they were divided into
squads of twenty-five each. .Each division
was put in a common cell, where they
slept on the floor without any bedding or
covering of any kind. The cells were
wreaking in filth. I had a little money,
and with this I managed to keep myself
from starving." *
Monroe Fulkerson, a lawyer of this city,
in some way was apprised of Mr. Bargar'.
predicament, and with great pluck went
to Zacapa. He found on his arrival that
the contractors for â¢ whom Bargar had
been working were trying to secure his re
lease, and were , preparing ;to raise -" $400
with which they said they could -buy the
prisoner's freedom. "X Finally Mr. Fulker
son prevailed upon the Judge of Zacapa to
hear Mr. Bargar's case. He reached the
conclusion after some ") talk 7 that Bargar
was innocent, but demanded $200 .' of
Fulkerson to recompense . him for acting,
as he claimed, as an attorney. Mr. Fulker
son finally offered to pay $100 if the whole
matter Â« was settled and his ' prisoner re
leased. This was accepted and Bargar
was set free. : /

TRACING THE MURDERERS
Additional Evidence Against the
.. Men Who Had a Hand in
Pearl Bryan's Death.
Lulu May Hollingsworth Confesses
That She Is Responsible for
the Crime.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 10.â To-day
the detectives in the Fort Thomas murder
case took the bloody coat found in a catch
basin yesterday to the jail and tried it on
' Walling and Jackson. When Jackson saw
the coat he said it was his property. He
claimed that he put it in a closet on Janu
ary 6 in his room at the boarding-house
and ha. not had it in his hands since. He
put it on, and; the negro, Allen Johnson,
said that it looked, like the coat: Jackson
had on ; the' night he took 7 Pearl Bryan
away in the cab. Jackson signed a state
ment to the effect that the coat was his
property and it was turned over, to the
Mayor..:.
After the coat had been tried on Jack
son, whom it fitted exactly, Walling put it
on. The coat would not button across his
chest and the sleeves struck him half way
between the elbow and wrist. ; This â¢is an
important disco The piece of shirt
sleeve that was found cuts a figure in the
case. Walling was the man who had the
struggle with the woman. She could have
secured a good hold on the shirtsleeVe
owing to the fact that the coat did hot con

AFTER THE SUGAR TRUST.
Lindsay Has an Amendment to the House
Tariff Bill. .
WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 10.âSen
ator Lindsay is after the American Sugar
Trust. He gave notice to-day that he in
tended , offering an amendment to the
House tariff . bill, now pending before the
Senate, for a repeal of the provision of the
present tariff law, which provides a differ
ential duty of % of a cent per pound on
all 1 sugars above sixteen Dutch standard.
The proposed amendment will neither
affect the stock :of the American Sugar
Trust nor disturb the price of sugar, as it
is a fact generally conceded that there will
be no tariff legislation of any kind at this
session of Congress, and nothing can go
through the Senate which does not bear
the stamp of "silver" and nothing will
meet with executive approval that is so
branded. *

TJie Site Has Been Selected by the

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.â The
Secretary, of the Treasury has decided to
accept for a site for the new mint building
to be erected in Denver, the property of
fered by A. C. Dake, fronting 293 feet on
Colfax avenue and 163:6 feet on South
Thirteenth and Evans streets. The
price to be paid is $60,000. : , 'â â¢;"'â¢
The price originally asked for this
property was $90,000. It was afterward
reduced to $62,500 and -finally to $60,000, at
which it has to-day been accepted. The
property is readily reached by street rail
way lines, is near the State capitol, and is
regarded both by Mr. Preston, director of
the mint, and | Mr. Aiken, the supervising
architect of the treasury, as better suited
for the purpose of a mint than any
property offered anywhere near the same
price.

NOT ALONE PRACTICE.
A Man From Stowe Who Has
a Few Remarks to
Make.
i
Worthy a Fair Hearing Because He
Is Honest.
"Practice makes perfect" is a proverb so old
that it may be said to be trite. That it does
not help skill to perform any given thing will
not readily be disputed, but there are still some
of the "old school" so bigoted that they will â¢
aver, and that, too.'with an evident air of sin
cerity, that all a man wants in this worldâ no
matter what his trade or profession may be is
"plenty of experience and practice." But
modern science has blown all these theories to
the four winds of heaven like chaff. A good
groundwork of education is, of course, neces
sary, and a great amount of skill must back up
both that and experience in order to accom
plish the best results. A plain case in evidence
is that of tbe famous Hudson Medical Institute
(the most celebrated curative establishment on
this continent, if not in the world), whose
physicians have made such a record for the
cure of all curable diseases. They have had
the foundation ol the most perfect educations
that has been backed up by their selection by
the management for their acknowledged skill,
and, of course, their experience is far greater
than any twenty, or even more, physicians in
private practice could have.. It is plain to any
man who has ever gone to them for treatment.
Perhaps one example of this is sufficient here.
Mr. K. C, Taft was suffering from a very serious
disease when he applied to the specialists at
the Institute, but is now strong and well. That
he saw skill as well as practice is clearly shown
by the following letter:
STO WE. Cal., August 20, 18!>5.
Hudson Medical Institute, Sun Francisco,
Gentlemen: I am feeling fine, without a
sign of disease now. Last week I was working
hard and sweat, and I drank a great dÂ«_l of
water. When I urinated I felt a coolness, but
when I had rested that left me. Outside of
that I feel as young as ever I did, which is all
through the skill of the physicians of the Hud
son Medical Institute. I can never say enough
in praise of what they have done for me.
Yours faithfully, K. C. TAFT.
Mr. Taft shows his appreciation clearly in
this sound, common-sense view of his cure.
Hardly an hour passes unless the management
gets letters similar in tone to this, for there
are people who are thankful when "t good j
turn 1 * is done them. And the Hudson Medical
Institute does good to every patient.
A. Burton of Grass Valley says: "Tbe medi
cine that I took did me lots of good."
8. J. Bailey of Weaverville: "After two
months' treatment with you I feel fully re
stored to health."
G. H. Rice of Fort Canby, Wash.: "Your
medicine has, I think, established a perfect
cure in my case."
Testimony of this sort piles up as fast as
snow against the "weather" side of a building
in winter, and it all goes to demonstrate as
clearly as the sun shines that "The Hudson
Medical Institute is the best and only place to
go when yau are iii and want quick arid certain
reliei."

SECRECY OF TEE SCENE.
Troops of Two Nations Patrol
the Borders and Watch the
Pugilists.
WITHIN FIVE MILES OF EL PASO.
That Is the Quiet Tip Stuart Gives as
to Where the Contests Will
Be Held.
EL PASO,!Tex., Feb. 10.â Late to-night
Pan Stuart gave out the information that
the big fight will positively occur on the
morning of Friday, February 14, on Mexi
can soil, and within five miles of El Paso.
I The same air of tranquillity and confidence
pervades the headquarters of the big,
good-natured fight manager, and not even
the increasing activity of the militia of
the State and Territory disturbs his equa
nimity.
The information as to time and place
has been telegraphed to numerous personal
4 and railroad friends, and it is taken as an
assurance that the pugilistic promoters are
becoming desperate, and have decided to
pull oft the prize-fights and take all
chances o: penalty. If this proves true,
the right between Fitzsimmons and Maher
will occur on February 14, in the early
morning, on Mexican soil, and the action
of . the authorities will determine the
course to be pursued in regard to the minor
fights.
During the afternoon the gendarmia, so
called the "custom guards," was ordered
out with instructions to closely patrol the
Mexican.frontier, and acting under orders
of the customs officials its members have
been closely patrolling the frontier to
watch the emissaries of the prize-fighting
corps. So close has this scrutiny been
that few of the local interested pugilists
ventured across to Mexican soil.
Fear ot the militia has been so great ap
parently that only Dan. Stuart has ven
tured across the Rio Grande River since
yesterday. Early this morning the United
Press representative met Peter Maher,
Jerry Marshall and Peter Burns at their
training quarters at Las Cruces. Maher
said he never felt better in his life, but
that he was afraid to go to El Paso to pre
pare for the fight because he dreaded a
sojourn in a Mexican jail. The other
pugilists were indifferent and were willing
to come to El Paso and place themselves
in the hands of their backers. Fitzsim
mons said this afternoon that he had tem
porarily relinquished his training quarters ,
and. would await word from Stuart for]
f uglier action. -' r â¢* -" " _Â£ '-j
United States Consul Buford of Paso del !
None, Mexico, stated this afternoon that j
the prize-fights would not be permitted to '
take place on any soil, either oh disputed |
or undisputed territory, within the juris
diction of the United States Government.
If this be true it will only leave the fight
ers recourse to Mexico. To counteract this
Senor Manuel Bauche, customs collector
of the Mexican Government, has decided
to take extreme measures and has re
quested the local commandant to have a
force of mounted troops patrol the Mexi
can frontier. These men are well mounted,
armed with modern equipments and are
determined to prevent the advent of any
body of men intent upon prize-fighting.
United States Consul Buford. is in tele
graphic communication with the military
authorities and has instructions to send
the regular troops wherever there is an ele
ment of danger.
Martin Julian was satisfied to-day that
the original purse of $10,000 for the . fight
between Maher and Fitzsimmons would be
i, posted with Stakeholder 7 Lawler. The
< money did not come from. the pockets of
the citizens, as had been planned, but
from the people who will receive greater
pecuniary benefit from the big battle.
The money of the merchants of El Paso
is posted with a long string back of it that
unless the fight is pulled â¢ off on the
X- tiled day : it will be drawn down,
That is why the big. fighters, who are al
lost certain to meet within seventy-two
ours, wanted a purse in sight.
It is needless to say â who posted the
10,000. But Julian is not satisfied that it
is up, and as Maher is of the same opinion,
the two great fighters are trimming down
for the ringside.
AUSTIX HAS THE MOXET.
There Is a Delay in Turning It Over to
j~;~ the Final Stakeholder! :
HOUSTON, Tex., : Feb. 10.â Austin
of New York, who has held the stake of
$10,000 out up by the contestants in the
Maher-Fitzsimmons light, was expected to i
arrive here yesterday, to turn over, the I
money to Captain James Lawler, the final j
stakeholder, but has not yet put in an ap- !
pearance. According to agreement the j
cash should have been in Lawler 's hands j
by this time," and sports seem to think !
that its non-appearance means that the j
fight will not take place. Lawlor was seen
by a representative of the United Press
to-day ,'and stated that he did not know
when the money would be forthcoming,
and had beard nothing from Austin. L. j
J. Parks, passenger agent of the Southern i
Pacific "Railroad, which will carry most of
the business to El Paso, says positively
that the meet will occur at a point less
than fifty miles from there. â¢
MUST EXD] IX A FIASCO.
Federal Authorities Determined to Sup-
X XX'";' press the Fights. --.
I WASHINGTON, D. C. . Feb. 10.â The ;
projected Fitzsimmons-Maher prize-fight
seems almost certain to end in a fiasco.
This Government is determined to prevent
any contest on its ! territory, as is evident
from the words of Attorney-General [Har
mon, that if the pugilists fight on our, soil
they will be 'prosecuted to the ends of the
earth, .while .Minister Romero declares
that it will not occur in' Mexico". 7 Thif way
to a prize-fight in Texas would seem to be
closed by steps organized by Governor
Culberson, and these obstacles 'certainly
lead to a very solid presumption;, that the
7 pugilists and their backers will be forced
to retire from their present business.

ALL ARE : FOR GOOD ROADS.
.Opening of the Meeting of the American
;.' Wheelmen. 7'.7'7v77
BALTIMORE,, Mo.; Feb. 10.â The fif
teenth annual assembly of the League of
American' Wheelmen was opened with a
good-roads meeting in 7 the Young Men's
Christian Hall at 10 o'clock this morning.
To-day's meeting was the first of its kind
ever held jby the L. A. W. When Chief
Consul Potter of New York, chairman of
the highway improvement committee,
called the assembly to order the hall was
fairly well filled with delegates and others
interested in the assembly from every sec
tion of the United States.
Reports of committees, papers and sug
gestions on the question of highway im
provements and short addresses were then
listeded to, after which Chief Consul Pot
ter of New York delivered an interesting
discourse on the subject of good roads,
and illustrated his remarks with a stere
opticon, showing good and bad roads in
this and foreign countries. He ajso ex
plained the great financial saving to the
agricultural communities as well as gain
to pleasure-drivers.
It is an admitted fact that Mr. Potter's
amendment that the L. A. W. drop con
trol of racing will be snowed under, and
another proposed amendment that is
viewed with disdain dv ; a majority of
delegates is that presented by Mr. Jac
quish of Illinois to again, bring in the
color-line and to make professional racers
members of the league. The morning ses
sion was brief. v
Sterling Elliott's boom for presidential
honors received quite an impetus this
morning, when the New York delegates
arrived. A. G. Batchelder, the handi
capper of the division, who is looked upon
as a future chairman of the racing board,
announced his resignation as one of the
New York delegation. As a New York
delegate he was pledged to support Elliott,
whereas his judgment indicated Wiilison,
so that, as he could not vote the way he
thought, he resigned. . This gives the
liothamites one less vote, or twenty-six.
Mr. Elliott is sanguine of the election of
his whole ticket, which is as follows: For
president, Sterling Elliott, chief consul,
Massachusetts; first vice-president, C. F.
Oossum, of New York; .. second vice-presi
dent, W. A. Connelly, of Danville, 111. ;
treasurer. E. S. Hartwell, of Denver, Colo.
The Wiilison advocates claim every
thing and say they don't see how the
northern ticket can possibly be elected. |
Willison's ticket contains the names of the
old board of officers. He bases the claim i
to re-election of all of them on the fact that
! the league was pulled out of a financial rut
last year in the midst of a widespread Na
tional depression. Secretary Bassett of
Boston is not elected. He holds his office
for life and can only be ousted by a three
fourths vote. He is the only salaried offi
cial and gets $3000 a year. *
Both Louisville and Toledo seem confi
dent of winning the annual meet, Louis
ville: claiming a clear majority already
pledged, and saying it has ninety-five
votes promised. Toledo gives no figures,
but is claiming victory just as stoutly.
The first annual "good roads" banquet
was held to-night at the handsome Mount
Royal Terrace Home of the Maryland
Cycle Club. It was an elaborate affair,
j nearly 300 enthusiastic wheelmen and good
; roads apostles sitting at the tables. At the
[ conclusion of the twenty -three course' re
i past President Archie Wiilison greeted the
I guests. He was followed by Mayor Hooper,
j who responded to the toast, "My Cycling
I Constituents," and Hon. John K. Co wen,
president of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road Company, who delivered an eloquent
address on "Wheels." .Impromptu ad
dresses on pood roads. were delivered by a
number of _ well-known advocates of im
proved highways. v y â¢
The racing board assembled at a late
hour to-night for the further investigation
of the Murphy-'litus-Cabanne suspension
case. Titus came over from New _ork,
l and will probably be given a hearing by
â  the board. At midnight the board was se
i cretly locked in a room at the Hotel Ren-
I nert, while Murphy and Titus were pa
i tiently awaiting- the result of their de-
I liberations in the lobby of the hotel. : -

ROMANTIC SUIT
AT LOS ANGELES.
Forty-One Years of Wedded
Bliss Ends in Divorce.
Proceedings.
MRS. BALLERIN OS WOES. j
Charges Her Venerable Lord
With Conduct Unbecoming
a Husband.
GAY IN HIS DECLINING YEABS.
A Neighboring Woman Is Accused of
Causing Trouble in the
Family.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 10.â After
forty-one years of married life . there is
trouble in the Ballerino household, as was
shown \ this morning by the filing of a
divorce suit in which Mrs. Maria Araparo
Ballerino asks for a legal separation from
Bartolo Ballerino. -.",--"-. "' .
There is no family patronymic better
known among the older residents of Los
Angeles than that of Ballerino. It has
become famous in recent years through
the extensive litigation that has been con
tinually coming up in the courts, brought
either by B. Ballerino or 7 against that
litigious gentleman. â¢
. Mr. Ballerino and his wife were married
in this county in 1855, and have since
resided here. During the years that have
passed they have accumulated both prop
erty and children. Ten smaller editions
of the original Ballerinos have come to
bless their union, and now, living in the
evening of their conjugal experiences,
certain events have caused Mrs. Ballerino
to say that in spite of the; forty years of
more or less happy ; married life she will
no longer receive with patience news of
her venerable lord's escapades.
According to her statements Ballerino
is as frisky as a lamb of tender years, and
it is upon allegations of infidelity that she
bases her request for a divorce and her
share of the property. â¢-...' â¢
Living in the vicinity of Alameda street
is a Belgian woman who goes by the name
of Anne, and this woman is accused by
Mrs. Ballerino of destroying her domestic
peace. She claims that for several months
past her recreant spouse has been living
in almost open defiance of her rights.
Some of the children are still not of age.
and Mrs. Ballerino wants to be appointed
their guardian. She also wants a receiver
appointed for the property and . any
further relief that the court thinks will fit
the case. >' ' *â-- -*

SANTA BARBARA SUITS
Actions Against Citizens Who
Subscribed Toward a
Right of Way.
Attempt to Collect Funds Guaranteed
to the Southern Pacific
Company. ' ' .
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 10.â
There was a little ripple of consternation
in Santa Barbara to-day when the rumor
flew' about that suits had been 'filed in
Justice Crane's court against certain citi
zens who â in j 1889 gave notes to secure to
the Southern Pacific Railroad a free right
of way through this: county for the com
pletion of the through coast line. These
sums "are for the most part small, but ag
gregate a considerable amount.
The. notes given for the subscriptions
stated that the sums donated were in con
sideration of benefits to be .; derived from
the completion of the coast line, 50 per
cent being payable on the first call for
funds arid .the balance payable upon the
demand of the committee haying the mat
ter in charge. .:,? 7 7
Most of the heavier subscribers willingly
renewed these notes when 'it was found
that unless this was done the statute of
limitation would bar their j collection, and
the present suits are f directed j against the
recalcitrant remainder, fj numbering "some
forty-two in all.* The first will be made a
test suit, and a demurrer has already been
filed by the citizens against whom 3 it was
directed; who claim that the statute of
limitation is | already'; operative; that the
complaint is insufficient, inasmuch as it
does not state whether that portion of the
railroad toward whose right of way the
subscriptions were made has 7 been . com
pleted, and that it does not state whether
the sum demanded is * really required at
present. y .- 7,y .â y ....'X. â '/.'â 
The impression 'prevails that it is the
Southern Pacific ; road itself that is press
ing these suits, but, as a matter of fact, it
is the local committee, consisting of Wil
liam H. Eddy and J. W. Calkins, bankers,
and the Hon. James Barker, "Assemblyman
from this district, to whom the notes were
made? payable, and 7 who hin their turn
merely represent;: a local .committee Xof
twenty-eight responsible citizens, who at
the time pave :a ; bond 7: to . the . railroad
making themselves personally responsible
for the ti payment of these notes. Should
they fail of* collection the burden of .pay
ing them would come out of the pockets of
these gentlemen, many of whom are iii
able to meet the liabilities.

FRESNO LOTTERY
GAMES EXPOSED
City Officials Told Where
the Law Is Daily
Violated.
PRINTED LIST OF DENS.
Negligence of the Constabulary
Shown in the Columns of
a Newspaper.
SENSATIONAL CHARGES MADE.
A Chinaman Said to Have Declared
That He Bought Protection
From Authorities. .
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 10.â The Fresno,
Watchman, a weekly newspaper con
ducted by a syndicate of Democrats,
reached its' third number to-day. It has
been a free lance from the start, calling at
tention to official negligence or indiffer
ence. To-day's issue was a "roaster," and
has created a sensation in constabulary
circles. In glaring headlines its leading
article charges "open gambling," and lo
cates the following places:
In adjoining rooms to the cigar-store at 1042
I street Charles Belden ana Harry Giilett have
been running games on the percentage basis.
In the back rooms of the Levy cigar-store,
1048 I street, a man called Lucky Stevens con
ducts percentage games.
At 1427 Tulare street Tuck On Jan & Co.,
whoever this outfit may be, have a store
wherein a percentage game i. conducted. The
lawless business is run in the rear rooms. Any
body so desiring can also purchase lottery
tickets in that place. > v 7
At 1423 Tulare street is also conducted a per
centage game, but as to Chinese lottery tickets,
we cannot say whether they sell them or not.
No. 6G China alley, between Tulare and Mar
iposa streets, is the place conducted by Quong
Chong & Co. There tan game and lottery run,
but somehow the willing officers cannot find
the dace.
No. 68, in the same alley, is the headquarters
of another tan came and lottery company.
Other numbers in the same alley re
ported to us as daily and nightly Violating the
law against lotteries and forbidden gambling
are Nos. 67, 69 and 92.
Commenting on this unlawful business,
the paper makes the following startling
statements:
"We are told that respectable women and
boys and girls frequently visit these Chinese
dens to buy lottery tickets. It is useless to say
the officers do not know Chinese lotteries are
running. The Watchman staff has been so
licited to buy tickets. The officers of this city,
whose duty it is to stop this business, go and
buy tickets themselves.
In a line with this remarkable article is
a letter by Constable Ragsdale, headed
"Chinatown Bribery," in which the writer
declares that a notorious Chinese gambler
and saloon-keeper named Quong Chong
told him (Ragsdale) that "Deputy Sheriff
Rapelji had guaranteed to him and to Chi
natown protection in opening and conduct
ing lottery and tan, and, in fact, gambling
in general, for a certain consideration cash
and so much each week afterward."
Ragsdale's letter concludes as follows :
"He did reopen and has continued to run
his games. I make no charges, but Quong
Chong claims to have bought protection
from City Marshal Way, District Attorney
Snow, the Sheriff and others."
SLEPT BETWEEX THE RAILS.
Two Young Men Are Mangled by a Pas
senger Train.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 10.â The San Fran
cisco train which left here at 2:45 this
morning ran over and mangled 'â¢ Fred
Boyce, a young man who formerly worked
at the Grand Central livery barn in this <
city, and a colored boy named Alexander
Thompson, near Collis station. The two
had found a cinder pile on the track at this
point, and had improvised a resting place
above it by means of a ladder and some
slats. Here both fell asleep.
It came near being a long sleep for both.
As it is, Boyce is frightfully mangled and
will die. Thompson will', probably sur
vive. After the accident they were brought
here and taken to the County Hospital.
Boyce's skull was. fractured, one foot was
crushed and an arm broken. The negro
boy's right thigh was crushed and one of
his arms badly lacerated.
When they arrived ,at the hospital the
white man's foot was â  amputated â â ' at â  the
ankle and a large portion of the crushed
skull removed. The negro's left arm was
amputated.

PROFITS OF THE BIDDERS
Some of Those Who Subscribed
for Bonds Were ; Not Actu
ated by Patriotism. v
One Office Boy Who Expended a Two-
Cent Stamp and Made Six
Thousand Dollars.
NEW YORK, N. Yâ Feb. 10.âFollow
ing the story of the bond purchase come
many rumors of sudden riches acquired by
bidders who had no money, but whose |
tenders were considered, and who after- |
ward sold their right to receive bonds at a |
price larger than their bid, and so made ,
handsome margins.
â¢No one had to . put up large sums of
money in order to have his bid considered !
by the treasury officials. For instance;
there was an alleged doctor in Texas who
bid for 10,000,000 worth. No one had ever
heard of him, and though the bid was
thrown out as an obvious "fake," there
were others like him. -"â â¢'â ' X/
It is said, however, that a shrewd boy in
a downtown office in this city invested
2 cents in a postage stamp and made $6000
on the insignificant capital. He sent in a
bid for ' $150,000 of the bonds at a price
which insured his getting them, and then
sold his right to receive them for $6000 â
just $5999 98 better than his investment.
Of course, noticeably large bids, in the
millions, from persons who were not known
to the financial world excited suspicion,
but there are so many in this country who
are able to invest $150,000 that such bids
were accepted in good faith. A return of
$6000 on an investment of 2 cents 'is a
record-breaker. ' ? > -fX \ ' '
The deposits of gold in the sub-treasury

that the treasury had rejected gold j
arose in this way: For 'some past a|
bullion-dealer on Wall street has been i
turning in legal tenders for gold and sell
in,, the gold at a premium. To-day he
presented $800,000 legal tenders and with
drew the same amount of gold. Five hun
dred thousand dollars in gold was im
mediately turned into the bond depart
ment. On the second transaction of
$300,000 he secured the gold in bags, and
gave it to the clerks of the firms who had
subscribed for the new 4 per cent bonds,
and who had accompanied him to the
sub-treasury. . It was then that Assistant
Treasurer Jordan objected to have the sub
treasury used â as an annex to a bullion
broker's office.

MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 10.â Over
three miles of trees and ''.brash have been
cut away on the route of the Mill Valley
and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway.
The California Construction Company,
which has the work of clearing away the
brush and grading in charge, is to receive
12J_ per cent of the cost of construction.
The construction - company 7; has '. taken
$20,000 worth of stock in the railroad.
Last Wednesday a large force of men was
put at work clearing away trees ' and
brush, and the first shovelful of dirt was
turned by the graders yesterday. Ample
money to complete the construction of the
road has been subscribed.
The scene/along the proposed road is a
busy one, and work is being pushed ahead
as rapidly as possible. The contract with
the construction j company calls j for the
work to be completed within six months
from the Ist of February of this year.
The great redwood trees on the Cushing
property on the line of the road are
chopped off close to the ground and the
stumps that remain are blasted out by the
use of giant powder. XXXX'.
._...' The first camp of the men employed on
the road will be pitched at the base of the
mountain 7in . the Blythedale Canyon,
where small houses will be erected. The
Construction Company will build its own
stores and ' blacksmith-shops, where the
men. can purchase anything they desire.
The contracts for dynamoes and electrical
appliances has been let to the General
Electrical Company of San Francisco.
The necessity of building a tunnel in the
mountains has been obviated and a great
expense in the cost of construction saved.
The steepest grade encountered is not over
7 per cent, which is a rise of only seven
fret in every hundred. A great deal of
interest is taken in the building of the
road and visitors are numerous. The
price of property has increased and many
purchasers have come forward, y i rVyi

j MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 10.â A deter

behind it, to have the proposed road from
Sausalito around the coast to the Govern
ment reservation at Point Bonita- built.
Senator Perkins and Representative Bar
ham have the matter in charge and are
earnest in their endeavors to have " the
Government take a hand in the construc
tion of the road. A well-known gentleman
of Sausalito was here during last week and
succeeded in getting promises of material
support in the way of money from some of
the residents in Mill Valley. â¢
â  With; an end-of-the-nineteenth-century
boulevard extending from San Rafael,
through Sausalito and around the coast to
j the Government reservation the soutdern
! part of Marin County could boast as pretty
j a driveway as could be found in the State
i of California.
' Secretary Thomas Fottrell of the Mill
Valley -Improvement Club said that the
organization of which he is secretary
would do all in â¢; its power to aid in the
building of the road, and thought that
some means would soon be taken to raise
sufficient funds to build the driveway.

; It was on Thursday last that the pretty lit

going into Reed Island for cordwood fuel
when it struck a rock. The tide was ' fall
ing and as the change in water had to Ibe
awaited the crew ' availed themselves of
spare time by seeking supper 7in a farm
house ashore, the vessel being in no dang

meal, the seamen saw: to their great as
tonishment the T vessel in 'flames.. In a
vain effort to extinguish the conflagration
the crew succeeded in freeing one of : the
lifeboats and in it rowed to Chemainus,
boarding a train there for Victoria. 7
The Mary Hare was built here two years
ago as a tue, but last year was j remodeled
at considerable expense for the : island
trade. ; It was valued at ' the 8500 and is
practically a total loss, although there is a
possibility that a portion of her machinery
will be saved." Only a little insurance
covers the loss. 7 '- , : Vy.?f~y r -r,y ';

A Suburban Train Conductor Says
He Had a Passenger Answering
"â ' '. ", Her Description.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 10.â most
thorough search that has ever been made
in this section has resulted in there being
absolutely nothing discovered which might
lead to the solving r 7â of the mystery
surrounding .the disappearance of Mrs.
Arthur B. Cody of Chicago. There is not
an acre of outlying land within a radius
of a mile which has not been carefully
gone over. Thus far there has not been
the faintest clew to the whereabouts of the
unfortunate lady. % .'"7
A party under thÂ« direction of the police
yesterday made a final effort to raise the
body of the woman," if she had drowned
herself, by exploding large quantities of
dynamite in the bay. The charges were
placed at intervals . from the foot of
Fifteenth street to the steamship dock, and
the surface was closely watched. The only
result was the destruction of several
hundred pounds of fish, the bay being
white with them. >' ' . ' ' *
It is now considered that, whatever has
become of Mrs. Cody, she did not commit
suicide by drowning along the water front.
The police now have the idea that she
left the city and has. gone as far as the
money she had on her person would carry
her. It is believed she purchased the re
volver to protect herself, and she bad
something like $50 in her purse when she
left home. They believe she made along'
trip southward. There is a strong feeling,
also, that she is in or near Seattle.
Another late clew is that of the conductor
of a Lake Park suburban train, who recog
nized in Mrs. Cody's photograph the like
ness of a lady he had carried in -the past
two weeks, and further search^mong the
people at Lake Park brought out the fact
that a lady answering her description and
carrying a shawl similar to' Mrs. Cody's

sixty feetâ which the , original surveys of
the town called for. ;j If the '[- streets are
widened many fences and yards will be

cases the surveys bring houses half on the
street and half on private property.

fringes on the streets have asserted that
under no conditions will they move their
fences or houses or anything that the town
claims as its \ property, and which they

Estate Agents.
Between thirty ? and forty hard-working
men and women i- have > been the victims of
a bare -faced * swindle,, 1 and the police are
hunting for the swindlers with small pros
pects of success. ' â  â¢ - - . .- . .
7 On Friday an advertisement appeared in
one of the morning, papers offering steady
employ ment i to, men ; and * women. t ] They
were asked -to. call upon R. C. Marrian &
Son, real estate ; and loan office, rooms 1
and 2, 917: Market street. 7 y -
During Friday and Saturday there was a
rush of applicants to the office of t.he firm j
They were told that steady employment
would be provided r for them according to
their capabilities at -from 7 $15 to $20 per
wee_.7 1 Each applicant was .:-- asked to de
posit $50 as "a, guarantee of 'good ; faith -
which would be : returned ,in -the "event of
the situation ! not suiting i or,, when the
agents felt disposed to give it up. *â :. 7'*. :>;7
iv.. Many of . i the f applicants were unable to
put up the â¢ $50? an d? had to leave,- bearing
their disappointment as best they could.
It 7is estimated, ; however, that between
thirty and forty had the necessary amount
and handed it over .; to the firm. ; Each got
a receipt, which is in the form of a promis
sory note, the intention apparently being
that, in the event of ; trouble, it could be
claimed that the money was received as a
loan. ; - .'-.*..â '-.â . X.7 ..
7 They were all told to return yesterday
morning when situations would Sbe as
signed rto them. They went there, but to
their 7 astonishment R. C. Marrian & Son
had disappeared. The only thing found
in the ottice was an unpaid printer's bill
for printing their business cards. â 
;. Inquiry elicited the fact that an elderly
man had engaged the room, but it was a
young man who received the applicants
ana got the money in exchange for the
promissory notes. He told them all that
his father was out looking for positions
for them. ; .
Several of the duped applicants hurried
to the Police courts and told their stories
to the Prosecuting attorneys. To cover
the case warrants were sworn out charging
"John Doe" Marrian with obtaining money
by : fraud, trick and device, wnich is a
felony. : . : . . , .
.Among those who. swore to warrants
were Mrs. Elizabeth Ault, 1960 Howard
street: A. B. West, 518 Webster street;
and W. T. Schoonmaker, Volcano, Amador
County.
It is estimated that the swindlers have
netted between $1500 and $2000 from their
victims, and the probability is that they
have left the City with .their ill-gotten'
gains. . ' ' ' â â¢ ' -
BETTER , CHEAPER BEER
Progress of the Opposition to
the Union of Breweries
of This City.
Working to Assist the Man Who Will
Furnish the Desired Malt '
Liquor.
. "Since our me' ting last Thursday night,"
said Frank Marty, the leader of the move
ment against the combination of San
Francisco breweries, "we have met with a
great deal of encouragement from all quar
ters, and we are receiving a number of sig
natures to the petitions our agents are
circulating. More than 250 saloon men
and grocers have affixed their names to an
agreement to stand by the opposition, and
in that manner obtain cheaper and better
beer than is v being furnished now. .-The

better the beer the more beneficial it will
be for our customers, and at the same time
it will be a benefit to the dealers.
â¢The brewer who promises to furnish all
the .beer; needed is all right and ready to
stand by his promise as soon as we assure
him the necessary amount; needed to ena
ble him to ; meet the ! demand. .We have
the satisfaction of knowing that the union
of brewers does not know who our man is,
and it will not know until we are ready to
make the announcement.
-: "The first proposition was that a certain
number of shares at $100 each should be
subscribed in a corporation to be started
by this brewer, but while there are many
small dealers who favor this idea they do
not feel that ihey can afford to advance
that much money, so it has been decided
to fix the price of stock at $25 a share and
to allow any one - to take one or more
shares, but no one holding more than one
share will be allowed more than one vote.
4, We feel confident that we will be suc
cessful in â  the ; end, notwithstanding the
fact that the union of brewers has pur
chased the Lux, the last of the breweries
in this City that was holding out. It now
has secured every brewery in tbe City." '
Frank Marty, the leader of this move
ment for cheaper and for better beer, is a
good-natured, stout German, who nas been
engaged in business in this City since 1872,
being at one time proprietor of the San
Bruno Hotel. Before" that he was for
eleven years in Santa Clara County, part
of the time in San Jose.
FOOD TO BE INSPECTED.
The Board of Health Establishes
Four City Stationsâ Rules
for the Dairymen.
Inspector Dockery Found Two Shock
ing Dairies in Marin
County.
The Board of Health decided to
establish at once four City stations for the
inspection of ; milk, meat,' vegetables, fowls
and other articles ;of food. One station
will be at the wharf, the \ second at Third
and Townsend streets, the third on Army
street . and the fourth at the corner of
Geary street and Central avenue.
yAt ; each station there will be two in
spectorsone for duty during the day and
the other for the night.
The new ordinance of the Board of
Health, pertaining to the sale of milk,
goes into effect to-morrow. Every dairy
man must obtain a permit to sell milk,
and the license issued will indicate the
station where the milk is to be inspected.
Records of i inspection will be kept at the
station, and when it is found; that a dairy
man has not complied with the regula
tions regarding inspection, his license will
be -revoked.; Every milkman will have a
registered number.'
i . It is the purpose of the Board of Health
to frame an Â«: ordinance requiring meat,
vegetable and poultry dealers to report at
the stations, where the articles which they
propose to offer for sale mustbe inspected.
The intention of the board is to have every
article of food coming to San Francisco in
spected before going on the market. -;' Some
three weeks' time may be required to per
fect the details for inspecting meat, vege
tables and poultry. y . .
_ 7 Milk Inspector 7 Dockery has visited
nearly all the dairies in the county, and
has given orders regarding sanitary condi

Domination of the Gentiles Leading
Many to Depart for New
Fields.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Feb. 10.â Dr. Richard
Smith, a prominent citizen of Salt Lake
City and an elder of the Mormon church,
arrived . here this morning, the express
purpose of his visit being to inspect the
advantages of the Salt River Valley, the
intention being to found a Mormon colony
here. He will remain two weeks and will
then return and make his report.
Mesa City is a thriving town nineteen
miles northeast of here, and is settled al
most exclusively by Mormons, who came
years ago, simultaneously with the first
influx of Gentiles to Salt Lake City. The
climate and general conditions of Mesa
City and Salt Lake are practically the
same. Aside from this, however, the ad
mission of Utah to the Union has pro
duced conditions objectionable to one ele
ment of the Mormon church. They have
never taken kindly to the Gentile, and
now, since the latter class threatens to
gain political, commercial and social su
premacy, the . Mormons are beginning to
look for other fields.. ..
| Dr. Smith says his colonists will come
from Salt Lake, Lehi, Ogden, Park City
and American Forks, and that the first
body will probably consist of seventy-five
to 100 persons.

Curious Life Insurance. . V\
A curious form of life insurance is spring
ing up in French manufacturing to.Wns
under the name of La Fourmi (the ant).
The peculiarity is that the longer a' man
lives the less he is entitled to. Tho pay
ment of $1 a month assures the payment
of $1000 to the heirs of a man dying before
the age of 38, the payments diminishing
proportionately to $510 at 51. The idea
seems to be that if a man dies young, hi.
children are likely to be in want, but that
when he is 50 they " will be able to earn
their living.

Many times I have found it in my prac-

arrived in this City. .-:'.'
The came by the Umatilla, and an officer
with a warrant stood at the foot of the
gangplank when they, the first passen
gers to leave the ship, walked down it.
The couple were Mr. and Mrs. John C.
R. Cootes. The lady was Miss Julia Haz
zard when she left Tacoma last Thursday
afternoon.
They were arrested on a telegram from
Tacoma, which simply requested the
Chief of Police here to- hold them, an
nouncing that the Chief of Police of Ta
coma would come for them.
The couple had registered with the
Umatilla at Seattle as Mr. and Mrs.
Cootes, they occupied room 12 on the trip
down, had behaved themselves as a young
married '" couple on their wedding tour
might be expected to, and so when appre
hended by an officer at the landing much
interest was awakened among the other
passengers. â  i 'â¢â â¢
They were a little startled themselves,
but soon recovered, and , even when con
ducted into the City Prison took the mat
ter philosophically, even good-naturedly.
Telegrams from. Tacoma say that the
young people are not of age, and therefore
cannot legally marry without consent of
their parents. 7 , â¢ .
They were married, however, and ex
hibit a certificate to that effect "obtained
at Victoria. B. C, on Friday last. The
certificate gives the age of the young man
J** 21 years and that of his bride as 19.-';
The young woman is the daughter of
George Hazzard, who for several years has
been the secretary of the Democratic State
Central Committee of Washington, and a
strong and odd figure in the politics of the
State. He is a champion of the Hill ele
ment of the party and all-round political
rustler.
The young man, Cootes, was employed
as timekeeper for the Tacoma Railway
and Motor' Company. He resigned his
position some days before his intend.
departure and fortified himself for begin
ning his career here with letters of intro
duction to Postal ; Inspector Erwin and
Superintendent Flint of the railway .mail
service from John C. F. Gordon of the
postal service at Tacoma.
When seen at the City Prison yesterday
afternoon the young couple were seated
side by side on a bench in the captain's
office : smilingly indifferent to their sur
roundings, apparently happy in the pos
session of each other. . ......
"1 don't see how they can hold us here
or take us back to Tacoma," said the young j
man. "We have done nothing criminal; I
we are married and that's all there is to it. ;
Our 'story ? Well, -we left ; Tacoma last
Thursday evening on the steamer Floyd |
and took the Umatilla at Seattle. On Fri- j
day evening, while the steamer stopped at j
Victoria, we went up street to the Metro- j
politan Methodist Church and were mar- j
ried by the pastor," the Rev. Mr. Cleever. j
I brought letters with here with the i
hope of securing a position. We won't go 'â 
back unless we have to."
"No. I don't want to go back," said his 1
wife. "I mailed a letter from Port Town
send to mamma telling her all about it. }
My father has been in Washington, but is 1
expected home about now. I'm; sure I ;
can't say what he will think about this,
but I can't, help it," and she smiled as j
though not greatly. distressed about it. J
Neither would say just why they i. thought
it necessary to run away, from 'ho me to get j
married. They had.. been avowed lovers j
for some time, and Cootes says that Papa
Hazzard always treated him very well when ,
he called at his house. Âr
Both the young people seem, neverthe- 1
less, to have a profound respect for a certain" |

I. Newlands, a mining engineer- and j
brother of Dr. Newlands of Seattle, who is
married to Cootes' cousin,*, was with them 1
on the' trip down and was a witness of
their marriage. He was with them at the
City Prison nearly all the afternoon.: 7*
The officers at the prison were inclined to
sympathize with the young couple and
they were made as comfortable as possible.
PETS IN THE PARK.
The Remarkable Influence of a _ady
Over the Famous Grizzly,
Monarch.
The big bear Monarch, in Golden Gate
Park, has made friends with one of the
visitors to the people's pleasure grounds,
and only one. A number of persons have
endeavored to be on friendly terms with
him, but they have been unsuccessful.
The only one that he seems to be on good
terms with is Mrs. M. G. Cobb, the wife of
General Cobb, an attorney of this City.
Every time she goes there she feeds him
with dainties.' He knows her, and when
ever she approaches his cage he ambles
toward where she is standing and seems
pleased to see her. A remarkable fact is
that whatever she offers him he eats off her
hand, and he permits her to pet his head,
something he will riot allow any one else
to do.
His keeper has often tried to make
friends, but Monarch would not manifest
a friendly disposition, and he has taken
the precaution when he' feeds him to be
out of range of ugly paws that bruin will
thrust through the bars at times. Many
of the people who stand around .the cage
to watch Monarch as he moves from place
to place offer him cake and sweetmeats,
but, except in the case of Mrs. Cobb, he
reaches for what is offered with one of- his
great paws.
Some time ago Captain Thomson of the
police force took pleasure in feeding honey
to his bearship. Of this he is very fond,
and the captain was of the opinion that
by offering him the sweetness every morn
ing he would tame Monarch, but he
I found that while the bear was glad to re
ceive the choice morsel he would not per
-1 mit any familiarity.- '
Out on Stow Lake, in the center of which
is situated Strawberry Hill, there is an old
j duck with a broken wing, one that was
i captured wild and kept by a gentlemen for
over rive . years in his yard. Some time
ago the owner, desiring to change his
domicile and having no place to keen his
I pet, donated it to the park. , A reporter for
one of the morning papers, who frequently
goes to Stow Lake, usually - carries
crackers in his pockets, and these he feeds
to the swans, ducks and mudhens. The
duck with the broken wing has come to
the reporter, and whenever he goes to the
spot 'from which he feeds the birds, the
duck, no matter where he may be, will
swim, over and quack â until he is feed.
Sometimes the reporter will pretend not to
notice the duck, which will waddle ashore,
approach the reporter and snap at his legs
until he is noticed and given a cracker.
FOUND THE TREADWELL.
Remarkable Career of Antone Marks,
the Douglas Island Prospector. '
Antone Marks, discoverer of the famous
Treadwell gold mines and the first white
man to proceed up the Yukon after the
purchase of Alaska, is at the Commercial
Hotel.
Mr. Marks is an Austrian who has been
thirty years on the American and British
frontier. His discoveries on Douglas
Island were made before the founding of
Juneau. Enormous wealth has since been
taken from the Solid Bullion, Michigan,
Treadwell and other mines of the Tread
well group by Senator John P. Jones, D.
0. Mills and others, who became the pur
chasers.
Mr. Marks yet resides on Douglas Island,
and thinks it is one of the best places in
the world to live. " .
His mustache has grown gray and his
hair has become silvered since he went to
these far Northern regions. No history of
Alaska is complete without his part in it
being set forth.
The pioneer prospector alluded .to his
tragic experiences .last night in searching
for gold and running the gauntlet of the
Indians.
â  "It is some sixteen years ago now," said
he, "that I and a man named Dugan
started to go up the Yukon" from the pres
ent site of Juneau. We had only preceded
a short distance in tie interior till we were
warned by the Indians whom we met that
we would be killed if we proceeded.
- "Tins was a discouraging thing to us,
but it was evident the Indians meant
what they said. We were therefore forced
to turn back. y
.77 "The dangers attending private explora
tion and the needs of finding out the facts
of the interior at length became impressed
on the Government, and a sloop was sent
to ascend the Yukon. We got aboard and
went as far up as the first lake, a distance
of between 400 and 500 miles.
' "Later I was enabled to proceed further
up the Yukon to where some of the dig
gings are now. /â  Our trip was rather 7 hur
ried and we did not find anything. : It was
then I began to give attention in earnest
to the goid ; claims on Douglas Island.
There were five of us in all that made loca
tions, among them John 7. Fry and Jim
Berry. The Solid 'Bullion ; claim of the
group was mine exclusively. y Among the
other claims; we then staked out and de
veloped! to considerable ; extent s were the
Michigan arid Treadwell. The Bullion is
a very big property now, as are the others
forming the great combination.

' - * â 
Chief Sullivan's Bon Mot Sealed

Democracy.
BRAUNHART'S LAST WORDS
O'Brien, Buckley's Lieutenant, Says
Chairman Sullivan Is a Political
Job Chaser.
The edict has gone forth from Chairman
Sullivan and the faithful of the Junta
must close their mouths, batten down the
hatchways of breezy persiflage, muzzle
the How of 7 bons. mots regarding their
friends, brothers and countrymen, and ob
serve the golden rule twenty-four hours
per diem. ,
The following epigram delivered under
aggravating circumstances was the cause
of it:
"Max Popper is nearly as big a political ass
as Sammy Braunhart."â Chief Sullivan.
Mr. Popoer appears to have done the in
discreet thing of administering verbal re
buke to what is known as the opposition
and included Chief Sullivan in that cate
gory. He also enumerated several other
gentlemen, who were claimed by him to
have been friends of Sam Rainey and
Buckley, with the result that Senator
Amies, one of the men mentioned, and
Chief Sullivan retorted in a vigorous man
ner and caused considerable comment
among the Democrats who have threat
ened to purify local politics, even if it costs
all the patronage in the City Hall.
Chairman Sullivan became alarmed at
the way the participants were working
themselves up and called a halt just in
time to save some of them losing their
breath entirely.
"I really consider that Mr. Popper was
indiscreet," said he recently, "and I sug
gested that silence be maintained when in
ternal strife was threatened. It is not a
good plan to begin such contests at this
critical period and lam of the opinion that
it will not occur again."
Other members of the Junta when ap
proached for an interview were discreetly
silent and appeared to know absolutely
nothing. They looked blankly at The
Call representative when questioned and
refused to even chat about the weather.
No more uninteresting body, of men
ever assembled than was found Saturday
night at the committee-rooms in the Flood
building. If , any outsider asked for a
match with which to light a cigar he was
sent to Chairman Sullivan for it. . . â

thick throughout the local Democracyâ
with- one exception. ; That : exception is
Sam Braunhart, referred to by Chief
Sullivan recently. â  . â .
Mr. Braunhart was seen early in the
day- and asked what he thought of
Sullivan's faux pas. At first he was not
disposed ;to'_ be very communicative, but
finally, reached for.aleadpencil, and in a
few moments turned 1 out the following
opinion on the head lof ) the Fire Depart
ment, with the remark that he hoped it
would go as; he had written : it. The ma
terial is herewith presented:
I entertain the highest respect for Chief Sul
livan, both as an officer and as a man. Some
one â â¢â  must have misrepresented me to cause;
him to speak disrespectfully as to 'my political
affiliations. Too much* cannot be said of him
in praise of his conduct ol the department over
which he presides. "I am fully satisfied that he
is sick of any attempt to drag the department
into politics, and he will; in my opinion/do all
in his power to prevent its: use for any im
proper purpose. Â«? Still, there can be no ques
tion as to the effort daily made by followers of
Sam s Rainey to secure control of our organiza
tion, yet ; all -their attempts . have ' thus ;â¢ far
proven futile. They do not number more than
15 per cent of i the entire membership of the -
general committee; and in the primary elec
tion yet to be held their number will dimin
ish below that percentage/-, Rainey as a politi
cal boss is as dead as Buckley; and it is safe to
say, beyond a doubt, that both these men have,
had their day. v â¢â â  ':.: - â  â¢ 'â â '<"/. . * :
Xl The Democracy of this; City will; not again
permit itself to be controlled by men who will
not support a ticket they themselves nominate:
nor will the party tolerate the use of the or
ganization as a tender to Boss Burns to foist a
corrupt municipal government, upon our peo
ple. The treachery agaiust the party; in 1890,
1892 and 1894 is of too $ recent; occurrence to
be condoned. Buckley and Rainey : were both
responsible for this party treason, and though
Kainey conspired with" all his forces to defeat
the ticket in 1892. he; signally failed, and ?we
won the greatest victory in political his
tory of this City? :. 4 > -:â  .
. v Buckley and Rainey are now separated and
it is due to Chief Sullivan that \ this -i is accom
plished. Were it not for hia sturdy and fear
less stand against Buckley these cronies would
be plotting together as they have In s the past.
They are both in politics," and their protesta
tions to the contrary deceive no one. : But they
are dead, never to rise again. '
Samuel Braunhart.
â¢ : It would be well for members 'of the
Junta to cut out the closing sentence and
paste it in their hats as |a _ prophecy made
in the midst of trying .'and -stirring times
when men rise to the occasions . that in

FISH COMMISSIONERS.
They Have Decided to Cease Stocking
;:â :;.-.-*â¢;.â¢.' the Truckee River.
The Board of Fish Commissioners met
yesterday. The secretary reported that
Deputy; Al Wilson had made another suc
cessful raid upon- the illegal fishers on the
Russian River and on Friday night secured
two large set salmon nets.
i Commissioner J. Morrison and Deputy
Babcock will this week go -to Folsom 7to
examine the new fish-ladder constructed
on. the Folsom Electric Power Company's
dam. The dam i. eighty-nine feet high
and the ladder, to permit fish to get over
the obstruction in the river, cost over
$2000. It is built of rock and cement, and
in its construction great engineering diffi
culties had to be overcome, v , 7 7
A. N. Buckman of the South Fork Ditch
Company accepted the plans for the fish
ladder to be constructed on the east side of
the American River below Auburn.
7 The commission decided to discontinue
stocking the Truckee River in California.
The Truckee is the outlet of Lake Tahoe,
and , all the fish in their annual runs go
down the river. On account of the
wretched condition of the fish-ladders at
the dams in Nevada they are unable to re

DR. MORSE HAS RESIGNED
The President of California Col
. lege Is to Retire This
Term.
Ten Years of Service, During Which
the Institution Has Been
Built Up.
Dr. S. B. Morse, president of California
College, sent in his resignation to the
board of trustees at the last session of that
body, on February 4. The board did not
accept it, but laid it on the table for future
action.
It is understood, however, that Dr.
Morse has fully made up his mind to close
his work with California College with
the present college year. He was elected
to the presidency in December, 1886, and
will have completed nearly ten years at
the expiration of the present college year.
Previous to 1886 the Baptists of California
had made several attempts to establish a
school, but with little success. -77*7* y;
Since Dr. Morse has had charge three
beautiful buildings have been erected upon
the ten-acre campus at Highland Park,
and academic, collegiate and 1 musical' de
partments have .been maintained with a
success that has been gratifying and re
markable, considering the stringency of
the times. Besides the. purchase of
grounds and erection of buildings, which
are all paid for, President Morse has se
cured from the friends of : the institution
endowment and scholarship funds to the
amount of $43,000: -V _ : r ;y
Though having the executive labors of
the college upon him, he has taught an
average of five 7 classes a day, lias delivered
over 400 .addresses and- lectures, and has
traveled over 30,000 miles.
.President Morse 7 does his work quietly
and faithfully.: During his life in Califor
nia, since 1861, he has held four important
positions. For five \ years he filled < the
chair of ancient languages, in the Pacific
Methodist College; for 'eight years he was
pas tor.of the First Baptist Church in Stock
ton; he was 7 pastor of the Tenth avenue
Baptist Church, .Oakland,,; between y nine
and ten years, and. he is now serving his
tenth year at the college.. â¢â  - ;
Dr.- Morse spent 1877 in Europe and the
Orient. : He has delivered over 300 lectures
on his travels. \Vhether he will continue
teaching or return to the pulpit he has not
determined. 7 . 7

7 Shortly before 12 ; o'clock '; last ; night a" tall,
blonde woman; about l 85 .years of age, called
at the Receiving Hospital, and Dr. Fitzgibbon
followed; her out to see what she wanted. The
woman 7 led ? him to t City j Hall â 'â â  avenue, where
she suddenly, turned and ; placed <â - a;â  bundle 'in
his arms and fled.. She was quickly joined, by
a tall man, with whom she ran rapidly toward
Market streets Dr. Fitzgibbon was "so surprised
that he let the strange couple escape without a
word. On taking the bundle to the hospital he
found that it was a girl baby about five or six
days old. - - - .
CROSS FIRE FOR
MRS. COOPER
She Incurs Sharp Criticism
From a Woman
Suffragist.
MRS. HARLAND'S CHARGE
The Church Scandal Complicated
by the Introduction of a
Pooh-Bah.
THAT OBERLIN STOEY DENIED.
The President of the College Says Dr.
Brown Was Never a Party to -
a Scandal There.
A story published in an afternoon paper
charging that Dr. Brown while ' a student
at Oberlin College was involved in a scan
dal' similar to' the one which now sur
rounds him is bitterly resented by that
gentleman.' 7 . ' '';'.:'"''â¢"
The statement was made on what 7 pur
ported to be reliable authority that Dr.
Brown left college at the request of the
faculty, the blackmail accompaniment be
ing the only difference between the then
difficulty and ' the more recent charges
made by "Mrs. Davidson. Blackmail was
not a part of the Oberlin affair. As soon
a s Dr. Brown read the story he immedi
ately sent the following telegram
. San Francisco, Feb. 10, 1896.
- President James A. Fairchild, Oberlin, Ohio:
Newspapers here accuse me of scandal at Ober
lin. Answer thirty words at my expense.
" -X-'XX-J' ~ ;-'â â .'â¢_ . C. O. Brown.
At 9 o'clock last night he received a re
ply, which tells* its own story:
Oberlin, Ohio, Feb. 10, 1896.
Rev. Dr. ' C. 0. Brown, 1703 Geary â¢ street, San
Francisco, Cal.: There is not the- shadow of
truth in the rumor of scandal connected with
your life at Oberlin. James A. Fairchild.
"Nothing more infamous has yet been
attempted than this story published in an
afternoon paper of alleged -misconduct on
my s part while a student at Oberlin," said
Dr. Brown. "That sort of thing is con
temptible, and but for the present dif
ficulties which entangle me I would not
pay the least attention to it. The tele
gram of ex-president Fairchild must put
the stamp of untruth on the whole state
ment. ; â  . -.-,..
"Mr. Fairchild was president of Oberlin
College for thirty years, is an eminent
scholar and is now at, the head of the
theological - department.- Certainly he
would know if I was guilty of any wrong
doing while a student under him. Mat
ters of that character^ do not occur in .a
small town of 5000 people without every
body knowing it. I married' in Oberlin
and two of my children were born there.
Last October my wife and I visited the
old home, and our reception was all that
could be desired. We also made a short
stay at Rochester, the scene of the Bulle
tin's alleged sensation. This last charge,
is so utterly groundless as to be devoid of.
the usual anonymous letters." ,
:". Mrs. Hester A. 7 Harland says the state
ment recently, made that Mrs. - Cooper
caused her dismissal or .withdrawal from
the State Suffragists' Association is prac
tically true in detail. . t .
"I regret very much," she said when
seen at the home : of y Mrs. ! Nellie Blinn, on
Post street, yesterday, "that my name has
been drawn into this unfortunate affair.
So long as it has, .however, I cheerfully
give the facts as . I know , them. Mrs.
Cooper is chairman of the amendment
campaign committee, a committee, by the
way, that was created by â  Miss Anthony
and others last year for the one purpose
of making Mrs. Cooper think that she was
the supreme power in the movement. The
State Suffragist Association, now twenty
seven years old, could just as easily, have
done all this,' and in fact it was its right.
But Mrs. Cooper was a new convert and
everybody knows, that where she cannot
lead she certainly will not follow.
"Well, I was : made : State organizer of
this campaign committee with full power
to act as the occasion ' might demand. It
was Mrs. Cooper's duty as chairman to
inform . the ; country ' press of my coming
and to generally boom the â¢ suffrage move
ment, this being the only way in which an
organizer, could work rapidly and success
fully. Well,' I started on my mission, and
to my surprise found that no one had
heard of the movement except in a hazy
sort of way, and knew absolutely nothing
of the local organization. I was compelled
to make a house to house canvass, and in
order to get notices of the suffragists in the
papers was forced to introduce myself to
the different < editors. I was very success
ful in organizing, but it was slow work
so slow; in 7 fact -that * it was painfully
evident I could not cover the; fifty -seven
counties 7by next ; November, and X Mrs.
Cooper's absolute : neglect of the duties
assigned her caused this, and I was not
long in finding it out. 7 , Â
"Knowing ! that if I was not assisted
through the press, the movement ; would
fall snort yof expectations, and' that '> I
would be held responsible, \ I determined
to enter a protest. I wrote "to the ptesi
dent of the State Association stating th'
case ", frankly and plainly. Mrs. 7 Cooper
had "not done her duty ;by the move
ment, and I did -not hesitate to
say 7 so. This angered ,the 'â ; committee
and the president beyond endurance. Mrs.
Sargent, by the way, is like putty in the!
hands of Mrs. Cooper. 8 In a few .ays there
came a reply to the effect that they would
permit no criticism :of Mrs. Cooper or her
action.. pv This a letter, was X evidently
prompted by the chairman of the amend
ment campaign committee. I replied to
'this letter, asserting my right as a member
'of - the : association y to . criticize - any . one
found not working in : the interest of the
suffrage movement, yet who > posed : as '; a
great leader. Â â¢*
- "I was 7 not greatly surprised /when ; a
letter came to me, announcing the sudden
determination of the campaign committee
to abandon ..the ": work lin which I was en
gaged. It was very plain to me that Mrs.
Cooper had y brought this about, so rather
than submit further to that sort of thing
I immediately 7' tendered ,my resignation.
Mrs. Cooper was right when she said I did
this,'- but she was careful s; to 7 conceal *â  the
conditions that brought it about: She was
not correct, however, when she said that I
resigned because of ill health. '^1 have not
been t well i for ten -ears, but . I attended
faithfully to the duties imposed upon' me.*
and have letters from 'â¢ the * State president
congratulating me on my brilliant work.
My resignation was forced by. Mrs. Cooper,
and she y knows it, but under the circum
stances no one can blame her for attempt
ing to X shield herself by concealing the
facts. 7; -XX. -.77, 7 7; â .*-;. ;â¢ -. '/â '/.:
XX "There are reasons why Mrs. Cooper
sought 7to do me harm, -.though â¢to .â¢out
siders ; they may i seem Â« mere 7 trifles. Fori
instance when Miss Shaw; was here we
agreed to' pay 7 her - $50 ii a .; night <; for i six â 
lectures. Something l happened so that
she did not deliver the ; lecture, but Mrs.
Cooper /made say motion i that it be
paid s':' her ;; just *â  the ; same. 1; fought the
Proposition .and saved the society . $50.
'; also had trouble with Miss Cooper,
the Pooh-Bah of the association, over the
appointment of an assistant in Santa Cruz
County. It happened that the lady was
objectionable to Miss Cooper and she took*
It upon herself Ito tell me so. I replied
that if she would attend to hex. own busi- j
ness she would cause less .trouble in the
association. 7 '
"This young woman, doubtless a most
estimable person in ; the opinion of those
who understand her ways; assumes more
than belongs to her, and is ; continually,
getting herself disliked on ; account of it;
I said she was the -Pooh-Bah of the asso
ciation.?.-. Probably I would : have .hit
nearer the mark had I said she acted in
that capacity to her, mother. -y .
"I could give many other reasons why
the Coopers do not, like me, all pointing
to the fact that Mrs. Cooper did seek my
resignation, and got it. , For the present,
however, I will let the matter rest here."
y Mrs. Cooper continues to be I flooded
with letters; anonymous and otherwise.
Yesterday she received one of the former
character from Tacoma, charging her
with being the mysterious Jane Elizabeth
Baddin. .It readsas follows:
. y Tacoma, Feb. 7. 1896.
â¢ Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, San Francisco: 1 see by
the disDatches : this morning .hat you are
keeping up the fight in good shape. Yes, 1
suppose if you should hold your peace the very
stones would cry out. This is very thinâ so thin
that a man could see through it; but 1
have had a new revelation. It has lately oc
curred to me that you and Mrs. Davidson have
conspired together for the purpose of extortion,
and that you are the mysterious Mrs. Baddin,
and that you are only carrying your part of
the programme, and that you are only doing it
for fear that she (Mrs. D.) will give you away
or turn against you; that you are only doing
what you promised to I do. Well, if am right
in my prediction, you will, soon be with Mrs.
Davidson, where , you ought to be, and when
you are there together I suppose you will each
of you have your bibles with you all the time.
Oh, why should such hellhounds be permitted
to dog such a noble man of God as Dr. C. O.
Brown?' . , Old Congregationalist.
This letter was [ mailed in Tacoma â¢ Feb
ruary 6, but bears the date of the 7th inst.
The. fact that the letter is in the same
handwriting as those written in this City
causes Mrs. Cooper to suspect that they
weie from the same party. This letter,
with others, has been turned over to Post
office Inspector Irwin, who will make a
thorough investigation. .
"I am surprised at the stand taken by
Dr. Case," said Mrs. Cooper yesterday.
"It is all right to ask for suspension of
judgment, but the way he attacked the
press was ill-timed if nothing more."
Letters-missive were sent yesterday to
all the churches expected to taKe part in
the council. Dr. McLean has been virtu
ally agreed on for moderator and George

HOW THE LAW IS BROKEN
Gamblers Resort to Sharp Prac
tices to Get Ingleside
Results.
WERE ALL AT SEA YESTERDAY.
Wrong Jockeys Were Posted Up, and
Scratched Horses Had Odds Laid
Against Them.
With every poolroom in the United
States cut off from communication, the
downtown poolrooms continue to do busi
ness, and the question arises when and
how do they place the commissions they
receive. Should they not be arrested for
violating the Ellert ordinance? A
The Pacific Coast Jockey Cluh is prose
cuting with relentless vigor its war against
the poolrooms, with their contaminating
influences and evils.
In . its struggle to purge the California
; turf, of these parasites that .have j brought
the noble sport to the verge of ruin in so
many different sections of the country
the new racing association is entitled to
the respect and support of . all true lovers
of racing. A law is in. force that pro
hibits these crime-breeding dens, but,
through, cunning evasions, fraud and
deceit, ' their keepers have managed to
evade it, and justice is allowed to drag.
These joints were first opened under the
name of "commission houses," simply a
"blind" to dupe tbe unwary and unso
phisticated and relieve them of their dol
lars. Thousands of dollars have found
their way into the strong-boxes of
these disreputable dens, and not one
cent of it - was ever placed
at the trackâ the loophole through which
they are allowed to exist. This has been
proven' and shown up in print since the
wariare waged on them by the Pacific
Coast Jockey: Club.
When the new jockey club opened up its
new course at Ingleside it re fused: to let
the rooms have a wire from the track,
such as had been furnished by the
California Jockey Club. Not to be
outwitted their crafty proprietors
had the results rewired from
one of the poolrooms in the interior of the
State. Then the club shut these , rooms
off. Nothing daunted, the shamers tried
to smuggle ; information from the track
through the aid of boys, men and even
women. Failure followed in their wake,
and they were temporarily obliged to close
down.
With the reopening of the Bay District
track it was again clear sailing for them.
During the interim the criminal element
was drawn upon, and " men with criminal
records were promised ' big rewards by the
gamblers if they / could propose plans by
which . the : desired information -could
be got .-..from--.. Ingleside. Consequently
when the new track reopened for the meet
ing at present in progress the poolroom
men had their campaign all mapped out.
But a hard . blow was struck them at the
outset, for a cunningly concealed under
ground wire was discovered and destroyed.
As the meeting progressed, however," the
poolrooms were in receipt of the betting
and ' results, and for a time the manage
ment was at a loss to discover the method
by which they obtained the news.
The officials of ; the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club held a meeting at the club's rooms in
the Palace Hotel : last -evening, and Secre
tary Leake gave out to the press some
of y the - methods the desperate 7 gamblers
had resorted to.
On Thursday last a man was caught
signaling,! while confederates in a neigh-'
boring building, took down the results by
means of a powerful field glass. A portion
of his coil ? of ; signals was the 7 following:
Number one, hat off in right hand; num
ber two, right 1 hand to right ear; number
three, left hand to left ear, and so on to up
to the number 15, ! the numbers representing
the different horses could 'be ; ; signaled by
simple movements of the arms, or touch
ing certain portions of the clothing worn.
On Friday C. J. Kuerdal, whose residence
is -in ; Alameda, and he once served
a terra in the penitentiary .: for
forgery, was ; arrested while signaling
from; * the grand: stand. And y his
method was a revelation in, the art. A
black leather book, similar to the "dope"
books' kept by ; many racegoers, carefully
indexed, with large black numbers pasted
on the leaves, was held in such a position
that y the 7 confederate, â¢'-. by the aid 7of 7 a
glass,-; could easily discern them. Each
jockey ;â  riding : at** the track was . given a
number, Tod Sloan, who evidently did not
stand well with the clever 1 inventor, being
fiven the number fifty-eight. The odds
ad 7 another .. part *â  of the ,* book, ; and by
means yof y an : v index ; could â¢ . be '/â¢â ; found
in an 7- instant.. Another., smaller
book, 7.w ith "7. similar numbers, y ; was
fully indexed trto>,sigual .the scratches.
â¢ Both books _ are ' curiosities in 7 their 7 way
and show genius on the part o* their in
ventor. Kuerdal admitted '; that 1 Messrs.
Schwartz, Driscoll ; and Corbett employed
; him, and that he 7 'received .his â¢ pay
from Jerry Driscoll. A new idea was
hit upon, and Saturday the rooms had the
j betting and results rewired, from the East.
Yesterday the ; ; track; management cut off
the i Eastern 7 rooms, and i : the 7 downtown
rooms, taken off guard, were all 'at sea.
The odds at the track were posted
on the opening race at 1:34 p. m.
The poolrooms" marked up their oddÂ»
at 1:32 p.m. Braw Scot had j odds listed
against him while he was not a starter.
Artist, also a non-starter, was quoted at
10 to 1, to be ridden ; by Ãallard. Bergen
was marked up to ride Olive, while Garner
brought 7 the mare in ' a winner. The
race - was run at 2:03, while the
rooms y received no scratches until
2:18. Lizzie H . and Edgemount
both had jockeys up and had odds laid
against them, and neither was a starter in
the race. Forty-two mounts elapsed be
fore the result of the race was obtained.
In the second race the jockeys and odds
were also badly twisted, and the rooms
waited thirty-nine minutes before learning
of the winner.
The third race, a handicap, was certainly
a good joke on the "commission fake/
The rooms posted their odds at 2:50, while
the betting at the track did not begin until
3:04. Geraldine, withDoggett up, was a 7
to 5 favorite. She did not start in the race.
The event was decided at 3:32, and the
rooms were in ignorance of the winner
until 4:21. s^_3l_iHSSÃ_n__BÃi
Geraldine was scratched at the time
they learned of the result. In the fifth
race there were ten starters and the rooms
had the wrong jockeys in eight instances.
Forty-five jockeys rode in the different
races, and in forty-four instances the pool
rooms had wrong riders, counting
scratched horses. Seventeen jockeys
were up on "horses that were scratched.
And so on through every race there were
the most glaring errors.
In despair "Charley" Kingsley, who
runs a room on California street, wired the
other rooms that only one race was in, and
to pay off by the odds in the morning
papers. He also, stated that the fourth
race might be declared off. This latter
was a piece of news to the track manage
ment.
One of the evening papers stated that
the Jockey Club suspected a "leak" in the
office of the "Western Union Telegraph
Company. The officials of the club con
tradict this most emphatically, and say
that the telegraph company has acted in
good faith throughout. The returns from
the East were received over the wires of
the Postal Telegraph Company.
And behind this thin gauze of jobbery,
sharp practices and connivery these trick
sters hope to have tweive Supervisors pass
a law allowing them to continue in the
commission business.
ALASKA ISDIAX FEUD.
Life of a Tribesman Sacrificed Accord
ing to a Redskin Tradition.
PORT TOWNSEND. Wash., Feb. 10.â
Captain Roberts of the steamer Willapa,
who was here this afternoon, disbelieves
the report that four whites bad been mur
dered by Kake Indians in Alaska, rie
says the rumor probably originated from
trouble between two Indian tribes, result
ing in the death of one member of each
tribe. ' XXXXX 'X ''X' : .XX-./ v
The trouble was started by an old Indian
doctor who accused a member of another
tribe of being a witch. The accused In
dian, rather than suffer the tortures to
which witches are subjected, killed the
Indian doctor with a shotgun. The tribe
to which the doctor belonged then de
manded, according to their traditions, the
life of a prominent member of the tribe
to which .the mnderer belonged, and it
was given up, a missionary woman being
a witness to the shooting of the second
Indian.
Captain Roberts says the story was told
him by a reliable man direct from the
scene of the troubles, and he was assured
that no whites were concerned or molested.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON.
Congressman Maguire furnishes The
Call with the interesting news that in all
likelihood the Vanderbilt : and Gould in
terests have deserted the funding scheme
! with the intention of being bidders for the
; Union | and Central i Pacific roads when
â  they j are offered for sale 7by the Govern
ment in foreclosure of its â  mortgage, as
these two interests desire to secure a
through.direct line from the Atlantic to
the Pacific. If they have done so much
as deserting the funding bill they have
certainly done more, as open antagonism
to itxould not make their position any the
worse with Mr. Huntington.
While it is deplorable to reflect that any
railroad interest is able to affect Congres
sional legislation, it is something to have
so -grave a fight as this arise from the
greed of great railway-owners. Indi
vidually tbey can be kept ; under ' reason
able control. It is when they form
combinations that they are a great menace
to the country.
The surmise that the Gould and Vander
bilt interests have arrayed themselves
against the funding measure seems reason
able. As the dictators of Eastern railway
concerns they exercise ah enormous power,
and it is in the nature of things that they
would like to extend their empire to Cali
fornia. Railroads . work :in * combination
only when by so doing they can advance
their individual interests; the line is
drawn at foregoing \ advantages to be se
cured by independent procedure. :
Mr. Maguire is undoubtedly right in be
lieving that if these Eastern interests
secure the Union and Central lines the
Southern Pacific will have genuine compe
tion. This will come of necessity rather
than through choice. That is to say, the
Eastern interests would be in a position to
dictate to Mr. Huntington, and would en
joy the tremendous advantage of a popu
lar support in California resultine from a
reaction against Mr. Huntington's tyr
anny. As the Eastern interests would
not carry the burdens of inflated and dis
honestly contracted debts which furnish
the Southern Pacific with an excuse to
levy exorbitant charges, they would make
lower schedules with a view to the settle
ment and ; development of the State, and
compel Mr. Huntington to make his rates
accordingly. In any event, the \ Southern
Pacific monopoly would be destroyed, and
that fact alone would -make many things
possible. ' â  â¢ /
THE AMERICAN SPIRIT.
An amusing little incident, proving a
possibly unconscious acquirement of the
American spirit of republicanism, oc
curred last Sunday during the public re
ception given by the Italian cruiser
Cristoforo Colombo, now visiting this
harbor. It has teen the custom of Ameri
can cruisers on reception days to receive
all .who came, by. whatever means .they
arrived at the ship's side. 7 The officers of
the Colombo, animated by a praiseworthy
desire to turn the occasion into one of
profit for the local Italian Benevolent
Society, made a rule that no visitors ex
cept those brought by the chartered tug
and launch of the society would be ad
mitted. '
Unfortunately this fact had not been
sufficiently advertised, and as a conse
quence two distressing incidents ensued.
One was the loss of considerable money
by the owners of other craft who took out
visitors aud had to return with them after
they bad been denied j admission to the
vessel, and the other was the freely out
; spoken indignation of the Italian fisher
men who went to visit the vessel in their
own boats. In ' honor of, so proud and
happy an event as an opportunity to visit
an armed vessel from the great country of
' their birth we may be j certain that they
had made their little boats shine, had
taken a holiday and had donned their
best clothes, besides likely taking along
their wives and sweethearts, j They car
ried no pay passengers and went simply
as American citizens of Italian birth to i
honor distinguished visitors from their
native country.
But they were very firmly turned back
by the officers of the cruiser, and in their
chagrin and indignation they fired an
audible broadside of remarks at the Italian
officers not at all complimentary to the.
vessel and smoking with American patriot
ism. '"You may take your old hulk I" they
exclaimed. 7 "We ' build better ships
every day right over on that shore than;
Italy owns. . We ; are American citizens,
and we have '. American â¢ money in our
pockets, and we don't care a sou for your
ship!" There was a touch 7of humor
as well as a broad spirit of patriotism in
that. ; . '
The incident is not so i trivial as it might
seem, for it is indicative of what residence
and citizenship in the United â¢ States put
into a foreigner. He acquires a large sense
of personal freedom and power that counts
on occasion, and it is when these imbibed
qualities in him are offended, even by digni
fied officers of the country of his birth, that
; his American republicanism , makes j itself
! evident. That such a spirit would 7be ex
ceedingly useful to this country in the
event of war with ..a. foreign power is a
matter that goes without saying, and it is
pleasant to observe how even a small inci
dent may kindle it.
NOU-PABTISAN POLITICS.
The January number of Gunton's Maga
zine contains an article by Edward Lauter
bach on "Non-Partisan Politics," which
deserves the attentive consideration of all
persons who may be inclined to favor such
politics y during ;. the coming elections.
There is nothing new in the article, but it
contains a more comprehensive review of
the subject than has been published lately,
and the argument against the folly and
futility of fusion parties is . stated with
great force and clearness.
After pointing out that political parties
are necessary parts of representative 'gov
ernment, and that even the advocates of
non-partisanship do not dispute this, so
far as State and National affairs are con
cerned, Mr. Lauterbach goes to show that
parties are just as essential in the manage
ment of municipal affairs. "Manifestly,"
he" says, "if a well-digested principle of pub
lic policy is important in the affairs of the
State and Federal governments, it is more
important in the affairs of local munici
palities, for the' cities and towns are the
nurseries ' for â¦ the character, intelligence
and opinion out of which State, and Na
tional politics are made. " It follows,
therefore, that if organized parties, with
established: governmental 7 principles, i are
to prevail anywhere they, should certainly
do so in local politics. y
r7 It is true that : . much evil ~ exists jin the
government of our cities, } but the remedy
for this is . not to > eliminate 1 party princi
ples from municipal politics, but to infuse
into it more of those principles and a
greater degree of party responsibility than
at present exists. : If \ this were done State
and National parties would be held ac
countable for what their representatives
did 7; in;? civic administration, y and X there
would be a greater ; degree of ; party pride,
party prestige and _,; party success involved
in good government ,in ; cities, with a ; re
sulting greater degree of excellence in the
administration of such governments. â¢â 
To relieve the _ great political parties of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY Jl, 1896.
responsibility "for municipal government
would simply be to remove from such gov-
ernments any kind of responsibility what-'
ever. If good citizens do not like the way
in which their, party is managing the af
fairs of their city they should either purify
it or join the opposition Political
degeneracy cannot be reformed \ by the
fusion of discontented people from both
sides. Such fusions only afford a means
by which men who shirk the primaries
can excuse themselves for neglecting their
political duties, or else, provide a means by
which dissatisfied ofiice- seekers can hope
to obtain an office which they could not
gain through a responsible party organiza
tion. .X 7. ;\. ,;â :
Mr. Lauterbach illustrates the futility of
fusion movements, even when successful at
they polls, by the present condition of
affairs in New York. There is no organized
party responsible for the reform adminis
tration, and consequently any success it
may achieve will inspire nobody to further
efforts. .â  Enthusiasm, in fact, is chilled 7in
that city, and the whole reform movement
is in process of disintegration. From this
great and conspicuous example it can be
seen that as a method of municipal reform
non-partisan politics is" a : failure. As Mr.
Lauterbach says: "Honesty and efficiency
in political reform and public administra
tion can best and most easily be accom
plished through honest and [ loyal party
organization whose principles shall per
meate its ranks' from top to : bottom, and
whose responsibility, shall extend from
center to circumference." ...
SIMPLIFYING LAND TRANSFERS.
y The ablest exposition of the Torrens sys
tem of land transfer that has been made in
many a day was read before a club in this
City recently by Warren Gregory. It will
be remembered that a year ago a bill to
introduce this system in California was
passed by /the Assembly, but was with
drawn from the Senate. Since that time
there ; have been serious disturbances of
titles in this State, reference being had to
those â¢ descended from Spanish grants.
This trouble has been of frequent recur
rence ever since 1852, when the commis
sion appointed by Congress to settle these
titles did its work of settling them, or at
least making their settlement possible.
The Torrens idea is steadily progressing
in various parts of the United States. .The
readiness with which the people are ready
to accept it may be j inferred from the ac
tion last November of Cook County, 111.,
which contains the city of Chicago. I The
Legislature had made it optional with the
counties to adopt the system, and Cook
County adopted it by a vote of 82,536 to
5279. 7 Sir Robert Torrens introduced the
system in Australia in 1858, ; Queensland
adopted it in 1861, Victoria and New South
: Wales in 1862, New Zealand ) and â¢ British .
Columbia -in 1870, Western Australia in
1875, England in the same year,- Manitoba
in 1883, and Ontario in 1884. These data
are given for the purpose of showing that
the system is contagious, . for it spread
gradually from the place of its original in
troduction on the sole strength. of its su
perior merits as learned by observation. ..
! As Mr. Gregory has shown, the plan had
to be considerably modified to suit the
constitutional requirements of the United
States, but the Illinois act has been passed
upon favorably by the ablest constitutional
lawyers available, and, as " it does not con
flict with the fourteenth amendment and
contains the essential elements of the Tor-,
rens system, it is regarded as a boon to the
people. . ' .
In a few words the Illinois law makes it
optional with' land-owners whether they
will avail themselves of its benefits. It
provides for a registrar and 1 * two expert
land lawyers, who shall carefully investi
gate every application for a certificate of
title, give due notice to possible adverse
claimants, and then issue a certificate,
which is an evidence of absolute title.
Five years are ? 'given within which it may
be contested.. If there is no contest the
certificate becomes indefeasible at the end
of five years and is forever thereafter un
assailable. 7 In case it should be developed
after that time that the registrar has erred
it is provided that the adverse claimant
may sue the State for damages. '
The advantages of the system are
numerous. The essence of the title re
sides in ' its registration. The certificate,
being evidence of title, is available for
ready and inexpensive transfer and land'
becomes a quick asset. All this is in ad
dition to the ' stability of title and the con
sequent shutting off of j all possibility of
threatening suits brought for purposes of
extortion, and that would be a great de
sideratum in some parts of California.
The absence of a warranty-deed system in
this' State places us in a worse position
than the older States and makes the Tor
rens system all ; the more advisable. The
very, fact that title insurance companies
do a large business here is evidence of the
necessity for a change.

"I recall a very interesting conversation I
heard one day between my partner and a
butcher who lived outside of the town and had
worked up the local meat men by bringing his

tbe row* that followed lay in the fact that the
country butcher did not pay a meat license

a cut rate, and in time worked considerable
injury to the butchers who were compelled to
pay city license. ~ â¢ - '^ ' J
"Things began to get very warm between 1

and a walking stick in his | hand you have a

like it beforeâ probably upon a trans-Atlantic

His pajamas are of the lightest, finest Chi
nese silk, and the monkey has become so ac
customed to them that he refuses ;> to go to
sleep without them. The bath-robe, which is
of . some fleecy material, soft to the touch,
pleased Brummel so- much that he actually
earned to take a bath every morning, for the
pleasure of feeling it upon his back. : -> '..;.
â  Of course Brummel has a valet to look after
him, and you may depend upon it this valet
earns his wages. There is no monotony in his
life. His first task in the morning is*to run to
Brummel's little bed and see if Brummel is
still alive. With Brummel's inordinate fond
ness for eating everything that shines, from
hand-mirrors to silver hair-brushes, this is al
ways problematical. The owner, however, is
very : fond of the little fellow, and spares
neither trouble nor expense to make him com
fortable.
Taken all in all, the clothes for this monkey
cost as much, suit for suit, as the clothes his
master wears. : No man we meet on Broadway
wears finer or more expensive garments. In
fact one' can't buy finer. Mr. Vanderbilt's
dress coat costs just as much as this monkey's,
no more and no less. '
Brummel's position in â  life is truly enviable.
He has all that he requires and has no respon
sibilities. -- â â â â â -â -â â

The Boersâ lnquirer, City. In 1836 the Boera
fled from Cape Colony on account of the Eng.

founded the Orange Free State. They then es
tablished a republic in the Cashan Mountains.
During the Zulu war the English annexed the
country under the colonial Government. The
people protested and sent a petition to Eng
land, but did not obtain any relief. They then
took up arms to assert their independence.
Five thousand Boers took possession of Heidel
berg in the Transvaal on the 27th of February,
1881, and re-established the republic with Paul
Krneger as president. The Boers were at
tacked by the British troops, but the British

Great Salt Lakeâ N. a. C, City. The great
Salt Lake in Utah was at one time as large at
Lake Huron, but now it is about 100 miles
long, with an â  average width of .rom 25 to 30
miles. | Its greatest depth is about 60 feet. The
area of the lake is about 2700 square miles. It
is .200. feet above the level of the sea. The
water is six times, as salt as that of the ocean.
The water contains 18 per cent of solid matter,
mostly salt and soda, with small proportions of
sulphur, magnesia, calcium, chlorine, bromine,
potassium, lithia and boric acid. The Atlantic
Ocean holds but 3.5 per cent of solid water, of
which ' salt constitutes 2.6 per cent. Three
fresh river waters flow Into the lake, the Bear, '
the Ware and the Jordan,' but the inflow does
not make any perceptible increase in the
water nor diminish its. saltness. The lake haa
no outlet, but part oi the water is absorbed by
the dry sand, and a portion of . it is evaporated \
by the dry air in the great Fremont basin. In
sects'and shrimps live in 'â  the lake, bat "no
fish," asserts one writer, while another asserts
that '.â¦here is not a fish or any other living

SAVED HER FROM SUICIDE
The Manly Action of Schuyler
Andross Preserves Eglatina
Caldera;
A TWELVE - YEAR - OLD HERO.
He Induces the Despairing Young
Actress to Go to the Home of :
His ' Grandmother. .
â¢ Eglatina Caldera, the pretty girl who
was missing since Saturday night has
been found. ; She intended to end her life.
It is probable that the prompt action of
Schuyler Andross, a twelve-year-old .boy
living in Alameda, is the only thing that
prevented the unhappy girl from carrying
out her declared intention.
Miss Caldera is a daughter of Mrs. John
Crockett, a widow, whose husband was the
secretary of the Belcher Mining Company
at the time of nis death, seven years ago.
The girl has been on the stage from lime
to time since she was a baby, and recently
completed a tour with Lorraine Hollis.
The mother is also a professional woman,
her stage name being Adelaide Caldera."
Quite recently neither has had an engage
ment. A brother, Orme Caldera, \is now
leading man with Lorraine Hollis.
Two weeks ago Miss Caldera was em
ployed at the Alcazar to sing a bicycle
song. The engagement was sought by
her, and she served without remuneration.
But the next week she was given a small
part and a small salary.
She and her mother were in arrears for
board and lodging. The landlady, think
ing they must have, money alter Miss
Caldera had an engagement, became im
portunate. She was ,very insistent and
deeply . wounded the girl. She had had
several troubles during the week and was
despondent. Seeing no way out of her
pecuniary embarrassments, and thinking
her mother would be better able to get
along if she were alone, the girl decided to
kill herself.
Hastily writing to her mother to this
effect she dispatched the note and
started crying for the , bay. . She had gone
only a few blocks when she was seen by
the Andross boy, who had just come from
Mrs. Crockett's, where he had been to get
a lesson in elocution. .
He wanted to know where she was going.
"I don't know," came the sobbing
answer.
'â¢But what's the matter? Come, tell me,"
he insisted; "Maybe I can help you."
Then the eirl broke down completely.
"Nobody can help me," she sobbed. "I
am just an incumbrance and a drag to
everybody."
She talked so wildly that he advised her
to go home. She said she bad no home.
"Then you come with me to Nanon _,"
he answered. And taking her hand in his
the sturdy little youngster went with her
to the home of his grandmother, Mrs.
General George B. Tolman, on Second
avenue, Alameda.
On the way across the . bay the boy kept
close to the hysterical girl, clinging to her
hand and soothing her. She was so ex
cited that he feared she would throw her
self from the boat. When she reached
Mrs. Tolman's house I the ; girl was pros
trated, and has been in bed ever since. : '
Her mother learned of her whereabouts
from young Master Andross yesterday.
The daughter will pro.bably return to-day.
WOMAN'S HOSPITAL.
Election of Trustees for the Ensuing
Tearâ More ' Funds Are
' Needed.
The members of the California Woman's
Hospital held their annual 'meeting yes
terday afternoon at the residence of Abra
ham Halsey, secretary l and treasurer of
the board of trustees. . The following trus
tees were elected for the ensuing year:
John Bermingham, Abraham Halsey, W.
F. Goad, J. M. McDonald, C. F. Crocker,
C. A. Laton, T. B. Bishop, Isidore Burns,
H. Dutard arid George W. Prescott.
The surgeon in charge, Dr. F. W.
Vowinckel, presented his report/which
showed that 481 patients had been treated
in. 1895, that 58 capital operations had been
performed with no deaths resulting' from
them, and that 220 operations of secondary,
and minor importance' had' been per
formed, from which all the patients recov
ered. jgBBBSBMBE__f
Secretary, Halsey's report showed 7 that
the institution was far from self-support
ing and that there was a strong demand
for an increase in. the number of contrib
uting members. The Roman's Hospital
is one of the very worthy charities in the
City. Out of a capacity^" for- caring : for 60
patients at a. time there are 8 free beds, 3
endowed beds and 8 beds that care for pa
tients at the rate of $7 a week. There has
recently been a substantial, brick-annex
added, and this has exhausted the build
ing fund. \ 'â

Through the efforts of the' Merchants'
Association and the Mechanics' Institute
several good sites for the Wilmerding
School have been offered to the" Board of
Regents. Mayor â  Sutro offered three lots,
but the one on A and B streets near Thirty

able. y Yesterday Mayor Sutro sent the
following offer to the regents - through
Colonel Denicke, chairman of the com

This letter will be presented at the meet
ing of . the resents to-day. \ At the Mer
chants'. Association it 7is estimated; that
this piece of : - land is worth $40,000. Its
value gives San Francisco! an advantage
over the other 3 towns; competing for the
prize. For example, Oakland,' the next in
the race, has only, raised $15,000 from 1 sub
scriptions for the purchase of, a site. An
other advantage ; in -favor >of -this ; City is
that the Sutro lands are not the only lots
offered. The Castro ; ; " Land Improvement
Company has recently made an offer of a
beautiful site near the end of the Castro
street cable-car line.

\ TURNER ON TRIAL.
He Is Accused of Forging a Recorder's
- :., . Certification. ,;. . /
The case of J. . F. Turner, charged with
forgery, was before Judge Wallace for trial
yesterday. Turner is accused of forging
upon the back of a deed the name of T. A.
Bell, Recorder of Fresno County. s
The deed was made by Mrs. Lizzie F.
O'Donnell to J. P. Frenna, and was in ' se-

curity for a mortgage of $98,200. Accord
ing to the information Turner took the
deed to record it, and then forged upon its
back the certification of the Recorder of
Fresno County, The prosecution are try
ing to show that this was done for the pur
pose of allowing the land to be mortgaged
several times, and they expect to Drove
that it was, in fact, mortgaged four times,

MRS . BRUNER`S PETITION.
j Members of the Federation to
| Appear Before the Board
of Health.
i . . ,-'-"."':â¢â  ~X.X
Sweating-Shop. That Pay Fifty Cents
a Dozen for Making
Wrappers.'
Mrs. Bruner ; appeared f before the
Woman's Federation yesterday., for the
first time since her embroglio- with the
authorities of the Receiving Hospital. She
urged the members to stand by ' her,- de
claring that she had been grossly misrep
resented by the authorities of the hospital.
There was a little spar as to whether Mrs.
Bruner had or had hot presented a written
report of the visit made by her to the
hospital. Finally it was s found . that she
had laid it on the table, and that the press
representatives had copied from it, but
that the secretary had not placed the, re
port on record. "I did not report to Mrs.
Matheson, the t chairman sof our com
mittee," said Mrs. Bruner, r : "because she
did not keep the appointment to come
with Mrs. Fair, Mrs. Fairchild and myself
to the hospital.'' '
Mrs. "Hose French stated that in any
case, the report was null and void, as she
ruled that all reports of committees ; must
first be presented to the president of those
committees, therefore, the report
which Mrs. Bruner had j read two > weeks
previously must be regarded only ;as her
own individual opinion. On hearing this
ruling, Mrs. Bruner framed and . presented
the following request," which was ultimately
carried in the form of a motion: 7.
To the Honorable Board of Health of San Fran
cisco Gentlemen : r As the *' committee of in
spection .'â â¢ of -public institutions from the
woman .'Federation _ was grossly* misrepre
sented in regard to their visit to the Receiving
Hospital, and great injustice done, we request
your honorable board; to .appoint a time when
you will meet the members of that committee
to hear their report on the Receiving Hospital.
After 7 some 7 argument ;, Mrs. 7 Florence
Percy Matheson agreed to accompany the
other members of | the' committee before
the Board of Health. Mrs. Dr. Juyue said:
"It is about time the Board of Health in
San Francisco 'â â  should know the public is
doing 7 something.7" I came * down i. to say
that, the ladies on the Receiving Hospital
committee j have? the -heartfelt ; thanks ' of
most of' the physicians, in San Francisco
for what it has already done. Â: They all say
'Bravo !' " The doctor modified this praise,"
however, by adding: that the. committee
should be accompanied by some one quali
fied to distinguish between good . and bad
instruments < and able to tell -boys from 1
bearded men. 7 "7 yy
XX Mrs. Henele remarked "I want to say
there are other -abuses* at the Receiving
Hospital awaiting investigation."
tt. In j speaking of ;j the* report ;of the com
mittee ;on sweating Mrs. i French stated
that there are some shops in town offering
$1 a dozen : for making men's', coat and
ladies' wrappers. .77] Miss Wilson : added:
"I am interested in sewing? and I can state
that there, are shops in town that give fifty
cents a dozen for making ladies' wrappers/v
Dr. Juyne said she knew women ' who
were eking;: out an existence by.: making
men's ties at 10 cents a dozen. .XXXXX' ..-

ALONG THE WATER FRONT.
Record-Breaking Round Trip of j
the American Ship -
Elwell.
CHANGES ON REVENUE CUTTERS
I
None of the Old Officers. Will Go
r North on the .Next Annual â  ,7
Cruise.
The fastest round trip on record be
tween this port and Nanaimo was
completed yesterday. X The X) ship : Elwell
'made the voyage from San X Francisco
to the Sound and back y again in
seventeen , days, thus beating .' her
own time and that of the Ruf us E. Wood i
by ' forty-eight hours. The voyage lis a
remarkable one, but interest is added to
the run when it is known that â  the vessel
took eight days in . getting 7to San Fran
cisco, ( and consequently she must 7 have
reached Vancouver Island, unloaded and
.taken on a cargo of coal all in nine days in
order to get away on time. 7 r
-When off Point Reyes the Elwell struck* I
a fair wind, but Captain Ryder was deter-' j
mined to make good time so he refused the I
tug sent out by Managing Owner Miles.
The latter had to keep going at full speed
in order to keep up, and it was not until
the entrance to the harbor was reached
that Captain Ryder began to take in sail
and the towboat was able to get a line
aboard. . ' .1 - j * -
; The ship presented a fine appearance as
she came bowling along under a full spread
of canvas, with the little; tug .puffing away
behind in a vain attempt to catch the fast
moving ship. Hundreds ;of people watched
them from Point Lobos, and when the
Elwell finally took in ; her sails, about -\5
p. m., the wind was fast dying away. â¢ /
"Had the weather- been anything like it
was during our northern trip," said Cap
tain Ryder, "we would have made the
round voyage in fifteen days. uOn our way
down we ran into the tail end of the storm,
and that delayed us. Had it not been for
that I think we would have set' a record
that would /not have, been : : equaled c for
years. Still, seventeen days comes pretty
dose to steamboat time, and I don't think
there is any cause to grumble."
As the Elwell has made the round trip
inside of twenty days Captain Ryder is
entitled to, $100 cash and a. new suit of
clothes, but as bis managing owner is part
ticularly well pleased with this perform
ance the bonus is to be doubled. \ :
There are quite a : number of changes in
the', revenue cutter .service; Lieutenant
Buckner, who was temporarily in com
mand of the Bear, is now in charge of the
Hartley, and Captain Tuttle, who was for
merly in 'command of ; the Hartley, will
take | the Bear to the Arctic. â¢ Lieutenant
McConnell of : the Perry has been ordered
to New York, where he will ; take command
of the Manhatten, and Lieutenant Rodg
ers, who has been relieved on the Hartley
by Lieutenant 'l Buckner, will go East' to
take' command of the Calumet. 7 Lieuten
ant Schwartz of the Bear goes to Eager
ton on. waiting y orders, and Assist
ant Chief * Engineer 7 Meyers y goes to
Portland, Me., to assume control of the
engine-room of The. Dalles. Other changes
are expected, and it is thought that j before
the investigation now in progress ( is I com
pleted 7 the officers who went -north 5 on
the last cruise will be few and far between
when the cutters sail again next spring.
Eight more ; men are said to be slated for
removal, and when the Bear again leaves
port Captain Tuttle will have practically a
new set of officers. f :y â â -.
The cable to Tiburon is' out of order, and
all messages 7 to 7 San Rafael and points
north have to be sent via Vallejo. During
the recent storms the wire chafed to such
an extent on the rocks that the outside
wrapper was worn away and let the water
in. In a few days the cable will be taken
up and repaired, and then Santa Rosa and
Petaluma will once more have direct com
munication with San Francisco. 7 . >
The British ship Bardowie lost an an
chor in a collision last Saturday night and
all. of yesterday the tugs : Vigilant and
Monitor were searching for it." The value
of the anchor and chain- is probably $500
so whichever tug picks it up will, be well
repaid for its trouble. 7- - , -7 Â

have the pleasure of seeing the street im
proved, for the board yesterday passed the
measure over the veto by a vote of 10 to 1,
Supervisor Taylor alone voting in the nega
tive and Supervisor Hughes being absent.
' Supervisor Taylor explained his vote by
saying that while he thought the bitumin
izing of the street would vastly improve it,
he thought that as it was already paved with
basalt blocks and in fair condition it should
wait until other : streets in greater need of
repair were cared for. He ; thought â¢ the
money could be better spent in his own dis
trict, where many streets were next to im

should invite competent but disinterested
parties to give advice on the feasibility of
tbe various designs. /''â â '
The substitute was lost by a vote of
seven to four and the original motion
carried by the same majority. '^ y---

HANDSOME BRIDAL PRESENTS.
The Bride Is a Descendant of an Old
Kentucky Familyâ List of the
Guests.
The wedding of Miss Grove Crittenden,
daughter of Parker Crittenden, and Carl
August Windell, was solemnized yesterday
at noon at the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
George Butler at Ross Valley, Bishop
Nichols officiating. It was a most delight
ful home wedding. Everything was con
ducted in the simplest manner, and was
correspondingly impressive.
The elegant Butler residence, with its
artistic rooms and spacious grounds, made
an exquisite setting for a wedding. In the
home the decorations were lavish and beau
tiful and represented the work of loving

girl friends. Sweet-scented acacias and ]
hanging baskets.and ferns ornamented the
dining-room, purple and white violets |
banked the mantels, and in the bay-win- ',
dow, where the happy young couple stood <.
during the ' impressive Episcopal : service i
that made them man and wife, ropes of ]
violets and smilaz festooned tbe case- |
ments and white primroses hid the impro
vised altar.
To the strains of the bridal march from j
"Lohengrin the bridal party entered : the
dining-room. First came the bridesmaids,
Miss Marie Lichtenburg, Miss Ethel Knaff,
Miss Kate Hall, Miss Kate Towle, Miss
Agnes Smedberg, Miss Agnes Buchanan,"
Miss Emily Weston and Miss Mamie Van
"Wyck. Following the bridesmaids ; and
preceding the bride, : who entered on the
arm of Mr. George Butler, walked the
maid of honor, Miss Laura . Crittenden,
sister of the bride.
Dr. Gustav Gutsch officiated as best man.
The bride, a petite, dark-eyed beauty,
with hair the color Titian loved to paint,
wore a handsome gown of white satin
trimmed with natural orange-blossoms
and lace. She carried a shower bouquet
of white violets. The bridesmaids were j
attired alike in white silk gowns trimmed
with knots of pink satin ribbon. .
The maid of honor wore a dainty gown I
of white organdie over pink silk, and
carried a bouquet of fragrant Daphne. :.
The bride, who is the niece of Mrs. R. B. !
Sanchez and' Mrs. A. M. Van Wyck, is -a
popular favorite among large circles of J
friends. She comes from an old and well- j
known Southern family, and claims Ken- !

Mr. Windell for many years .' has been a
trusted employe of the "firm of Shreve & !
Co.
Mr. and Mrs. Windell left last evening

BROOKS' EMBEZZLEMENT.
Held to Answer Before the Superior
Court on Two Charges.
The preliminary examination of Fred
erick W. Brooks, manager of the Window
cleaning Company, Spreckels building, on
two charges of felony embezzlement, was
held before Judge Campbell yesterday
afternoon. ~7S:
The particulars of the case were pub
lished on Saturday. Mrs. Orlinda Van
Wie, who â¢ was divorced from her hus
band, received in two sums $1125 as her
share in the community property. She
alleges that Brooks received the "money
for her, but used it for his own uses and
purposes. At the time of the divorce and
for several months subsequent she lived in
the Brooks house.
Brooks claimed that he gave her the
money, less her attorney's fees, but ad
raitted borrowing $290 from her, which he
had not yet been able to repay, y y â ' ' :
The Judge held him to answer before
the Superior Court on both charges in
$1100 bonds on each.
DEATH OF MRS. UPHAM
Wife of a Well-Known Business
Man Succumbs to
Apoplexy.
Deceased Was Prominent in Social
and Charitable Circles on Both
Sides of the Bay.
Mrs. Nannie Delzelle Upham, wife of
Isaac Upham of the well-known ; firm of
Payot, Upham & Co., died very suddenly
yesterday morning at the â  Upham resi
dence, ; 1300 ; Hyde street, ' in ~ this ; City.
Death came almost like a flash. She had
not been ailing, and on Sunday j evening
she retired, in the best of health appar
ently, and with no premonition of the
tragedy of the morrow.
; "At 9:45 o'clock death' came, in the shape
of an apoplectic stroke. Mrs. Upham was
born 'in 7 St. Louis, December 4, 1854, and
was brought to California, where she has
lived ever since, by her parents I before â¢ she
was a year old. . $Ir. Delzelle, her father,
was the; owner, of : Lytton Springs, near
Healdsburg, where the family- settled and
remained until his death./ The widow and
her daughter then removed to Santa Clara,
where the latter lived until she was wooed
and won by the man who is now inconsol
able at her loss. - 7- -/.
Mr. and Mrs. TJpham had been married
twenty-two years, and there are now two
motberles children, Isaac O.'andsÃenja
men P., who Â« both , attend 7 the University
of California. y Mr. Upham has been a
member of his firm for about , twenty-five
years, and is among the best-known busi
; ness men in the State. H* Mrs/'Upbatn has
always been prominent in social and phi
lanthropic circles, especially in Oakland,
.where the family resided for nearly twelve
. years: 7 During "the > past Â£ three : years and
i until last September, wben they j: took up
[ their present ! residence,' they lived *at the
! Palace Hotel. Mrs. TJpham _ -loss will.be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11. 1896.
MAY REMOVE THE CLERKS
Judge Troutt's Decision on the
Power of the Super
visors.
WATSON HAS BEEN ORDERED OUT
The Mandamus Case Against Auditor
Broderick Has Also Gone
Against Him.
Ambrose Watson ha. been ordered out
of his office as Clerk of Police Court 2, ana
Alfred Morgenstern, who was appointed in
his place by the : Supervisors, has won the
case he has been fighting 7 before Judge
Troutt. - i' â I ~ X
Watson was appointed to the clerkship
on January 14, 1895. On April 15 he was
removed by. the board without any charges
being preferred, and Morgenstern was put
in his place. -Watson I refused to give up
the office, and Morgenstern sued, to nave
hime ousted and to secure possession for
himself. The suit has been decided in
Morgenstern _ favor. . ' >. - â '-â .X
It was claimed by Watson's counsel that
the board had not the power to arbitrarily
remove its appointees, and that this is ex
pressly inferred from the difference in the
various y acts yof the :' Legislatures. The
former acts having any bearing ion the
subject allowed such removals, but in
later acts this provision is omitted. The
plaintiff, however, contended that as the
law does not fix the term of office of the
Police Court clerks it ' necessarily follows
that they hold office at the pleasure of the
appointing power, and, that they may be
removed without ; .;. previous 7 notice,, and
even when there has been no fault." ..
: The power of appointing and removing
policemen under the provisions of the
constitution of : 1857 is cited in the opinion
as / a parallel ; case. y Under .that constitu
tion : policemen â  could j be removed at ', the
pleasure of the appointing power without
cause and without investigation or trial,
notwithstanding a provision in.the conspl
dation act and of an ordinance which pro
vides that they can only . be removed for
cause. And,: the opinion states, the Su
preme Court - has decided ' that the Police
Commissioners have the power to remove
! now- without preferring charges.
; The case of the removal of Shear as su
! perintendent ; of ; the House of Correction
and the appointment of Sedgwick in his
place by the Board of 'Supervisors in 1885,
Sedgwick had) to sue for the office; and he
was given possession. The case was one
similar to the one just finished before
Judge Trout. .7 Judge Hunt gave judgment
for Sedgwick, and the Supreme Court af
firmed , this decision. Continuing 7in i his
opinion, Judge Troutt said: .
As it thus appears that the Supervisors had
j the right to remove their appointee summarily,
even when the act creating the office provided
that . he should ; not *be â¢ removed - except for
cause, why should, the right to remove their
appointee in the case at bar be seriously ques
tioned, when the act creating the office of clerk
of the Police Court contains no such provision?
From : the foregoing views I â  conclude : not
only that the T Supervisors have the power to
appoint a ' clerk Â» for j each, of | the four depart
ments of â  the i Police t Court ;of \ this ; City and
County, but that the power of removal is inci
dent to the power of appointment, and that the
I clerk > aforesaid shall hold office only during
the pleasure of ! the Board ot Supervisors, and
that consequently he , may -be * arbitrarily re
] moved at the will of the board. .;: '
Accordingly judgment will be given in favor
of the plaintiff, directing, the defendant forth
with to surrender to the relator the aforesaid
office of I clerk of Department 1 of the Police
Court of this City and County.
7' Judge Troutt, in pursuance of bis decis
ion in the main case,- has denied .Watson's
| petition for a writ of mandate compelling
I the Auditor to sign his salary demands,
! and this means that Watson "will not be
i paid _ for _ his â ' work during . the . past nine
months. V, 77 .v,y ;â¢;:,' Â;- â  X
Watson will appeal the case, and his at
| tornry, Henry E. Highton, is I very san
| guine of success â in . the : ; ; higher court. ,
Watson has been filling the position cred
:itably \\ since his appointment 7. and i has
drawn no salary in the mean time. Mor
gan stern , drew two or three months' salary,
but <an injunction ; stopped^ that income.
By Judge Troutt's second decision he will
probabiy get back salary since last spring.
PAINTERS' OPEN ' MEETING.
They Hold Their First Monthly Social
';.-â '.:' Reunion. ' '
The Brotherhood of Painters and Deco
rators held its first open meeting last even
ing in Washington Hall, : and standing
room was at a premium. It is the inten
tion to hold open ; meetings once a month,
and the public is invited to be present.
Gatherings of this ; kind - were held years
ago, ana it was found to be the ; means of
inducing non-union men to become mem
bers.': y. y ? 7yy . .-â â  > \ ' <
Last evening all business was suspended,
and all had a pleasant time. Songs, reci
tations and addresses were the order.
President J. W. McCarthy of the Carpen
ters' and Joiners' Union No.' 22 delivered an
interesting address upon the advantages of
unionism, in which he said that the labor
; ing classes can never hope to secure their
rights unless they combine in unions and
stand firmly for a purpose.
More than that, their affiliation with
unions would be of no great advantage
unless the unions work together in j a
causeâ the cause of uplifting its members.
At the present time, he said, there is a
general movement in that direction, which
promises in the near future to make the
power of the laboring man felt. He ad
vised the followers of every trade to join
the. unions of their respective craft, be
cause the time is 7 coming when all non
union workinemen will be treated 7 as
avowed enemies of those who want to bet
ter their, condition. Among the others
who assisted in g the entertainment were
Messrs. Cavanaugh," McCartney, Burns,
Mclver and Rose, the president of the
Painters' ami Decorators' Union.

On Saturday at Ingleside, Pittsburg
Phil ; lost iai large chunk of coin on his
horse Ed Kearney, who finished third to
Bueno and Nephew in the last race of the
'aay, a seven furlong run. The noted
plunger did accept defeat as philo
sophically as usual, and began looking
around for a match race. Unsuccessful in
a dicker with "the. owner of Bueno, Phi!
approached' George Rose and offered to
bet him $1000 against $500 that Ed Kearney
could defeat Nephew under the same con
ditions -on 7 Monday. The offer was ac
cepted and the two horses > met yesterday.
Johnny Lamley had 7 the mount on Ed
Kearney and the books j laid 4 to 5 against
him ; at the opening. His owner went
down the line, ; betting the bookies to a
standstill until 7 to 10 was very scarce.
Nephew was also | well supported, a stiff
play as the horses went to the post| cutting
his odds from 6t05 to evens. From a race
standpoint it proved a very tame affair.
Lamley took Ed Kearney off in front and
despite Chorn 's hard urging :' Bookmaker
Rose's horse could nev. r get up and was
easily beaten out in 1:28%. v l\\- J - \
The weather was perfect for racing pur
poses and the attendance was large. The
favorites had it all their own way the first
four events, but were defeated in the two
races that followed. -7 y .:.". :-.
The mile handicap was notable as being
the occasion for â¢. the judges beine again
compelled to disqualify the statuesque
imp. 7 Star Ruby. There were but four
starters/and the English horse opened a 9
to 5 favorite. The right sort of coin began
pouring in on Logan ere the betting had
progressed far, and when the horses were
called the iron . Norse, 5 who ; is a bit rusty
now and then, was an 8 to 5 favorite with
Star Ruby 2to 1 and 7 no money in sight.
Cabrillo and j Gallant ] made the running
until the quartet were well headed down
the backstretch. .Doggeti then: gave Star
Ruby his bead ana he shot to the front
showing the way into the stretch with
Cabrillo a close attendant.
. Chorn on Logan now , passed Gallant,
and joining the leaders the trio raced
; abreast for some distance. Less than a
urlong from the wire Star Ruby swerved
and completely cut off Cabrillo, who was
beginning to tire. 1 Logan drew away from
the pair and won without difficulty by a
length and a half. - Star Ruby finished in
the place, a length before Cabrillo, but
was disqualified and placed last.
. . But a quartet of sprinters also started in
the other handicap at six furlongs. Belli
coso'was.a 4 to 5 favorite, and, leading
nearly all the way, won easily, from the
second choice, Terrier. Grady was third.
The Corrigan entry, Olive, was an even
money choice for the opening six-furlong
spin.' After Morven had led until within
a hundred yards of the: wire, the favorite
collared and passed him and i won by. half
a length. Pique finished in the show.
The mile and a furlong selling event re
sulted in a victory for the favorite, Little
Cripple, backed from 3 to 11 to 5. Tod
Sloan kept in back in third position until j
nearing the bend -for the wire, where he
passed in turn St. , Lee and Dungarven, ]
and,, finishing strong, won easily by a
length in 1:56)4. In a drive St. Lee took
the place from Dungarven by a head.
; Six scratched out of the fifth event, a
five-furlong scramble, leaving ten to face
the issue. Miss Ross was an Bto 5 favor
ite, but failed to even get a "look-in."
Claude Hill, with McHugh up, won easily
at the end from Brametta, with Easel a
good third. X'-^'X
â¢ Old Tim Murphy was a 4 to 5 chance for
the last race, also a five-furlong dash, with
en starters. Jones, who rode him, man
aged to get hemmed in, next the rail the
last furlong and third was the best he
could do. Favory, a 30 to. 1 shot, ridden
by Coady, won cleverly from Gold Bug.
Track and Paddock Items.
Among the sDectator3 at the track yes
terday was ex-Senator Rose of Southern
California, whose colors were so prominent
on the turf some years ago. .'â 
The judges have restricted Earl Cochran
to riding for the stable of Louis Ezell the
remainder of the meeting, gj Earl rode
Todnunter, and crowded Tim Murphy
against the fence in the last race. But for
interference the roan horse would have
won easily. -7/77
Naglee Burke had a big bet down on his
horse Bellicoso in the handicap.
â¢ Crescendo was reported to have been
; badly injured by a collision -with one of
the Burns & Waterhouse two-year-olds at
the Bay District track on Sunday morning.
Owner Burke, however, stated at the track
yesterday that he did not think the big
chestnut seriously hurt. - '"" :f X< 'H

Gladness Comes
With a better understanding of the
Â» Â» transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâgentle effortsâ pleasant effortsâ
rightly, directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge that . so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the- system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness, without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial effects, to note when you pur-
chase, that you have the genuine article,
which is manufactured by the California
Fig Syrup Co. only, and sold by all rep-
utable druggists. ;
If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, then laxa-
tives or, other remedies are not needed.
If afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended tothe most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
then one should have the best, and with
the well-informed everywhere; Syrup of
Figs stands highest ana is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

It Is Found to Be Good Law
But Very ' Clumsily
Drawn.
AFFIRM THOMPSON'S SENTENCE
Four Judges Upheld the Law and
Three Opposed It, With Two
Dissenting Opinions.
The "train - wrecking" law has just
scrambled through the Supreme Court
without a bit to spare. Four Judges think
it is a good law, albeit clumsily and care
lessly drawn, and three Judges dissented
so violently that two of them wrote dis
senting opinions. y;A,y. ; ; -
The case came before the court on an
appeal from the judgment of death passed
upon W. H. Thompson, or "Kid" Thomp
son, for robbing a train at Roscoe station
in February, 1894. The information
charged that "The said Kid Thompson,
on the 15th day of February, A. D., 1891,
at the county and State aforesaid, did will
fully, unlawfully and feloniously throw
out a switch at Roscoe station, on the rail
road known as the Southern Pacific Rail
road, with intent there and then to derail
a passenger train ; and did then and there
willfully and unlawfully and feloniously
board a passenger train on said railroad,
at said station, with intent then and there
to rob said passenger train."
The law under which be was convicted
reads as follows:
Every person who shall unlawfully throw
out a switch, remove a rail, or place any ob
struction on any railroad In the State of 'Cali
lornla with the intention of derailing any pas
senger, freight or other train ; or who shall un
lawfully board any passenger train with the
intention of robbing the same; or who shall
unlawfully place any dynamite or other ex
plosive material, or any other obstruction, on
any railroad in the State of California, with
the intention of blowing up or derailing any
passenger, freight or other train; or who shall
unlawfully set tire to any bridge or trestle over
which any passenger, freight or other train
must pass, with the intent of wrecking said
train, upon conviction shall be adjudged
guilty of a felony, and shall be punished with
death or by imprisonment In the State prison
for life, at the option of the jury trying the case.
Thompson was charged with- willfully
and unlawfully throwing out a switch at
Roscoe station on the Southern Pacific
railroad with the intent to derail a pas
senger train, and also with boarding a pas
senger train with the intent to rob it. It
was pleaded that the information charged
him with two separate offenses, and that
his conviction upon it was unwarranted
and unlawful, but the Supreme Court,
quoting from Bishop's New Criminal
Procedure, says:
A statute often makes punishable the
doing of one thing or another, sometimes
thus specifying a considerable number of
things. Then by proper and ordinary construc
tion a person who in one transaction does all,
violates the statute but once, and incurs only
one penalty. Yet he violates it equally by do
ing one of the things. Therefore the indict-*
ment upon such a statute may allege in a sin
gle count that the defendant didasmanvof
the forbidden things as the pleader chooses,
employing the conjunction "and" where the
statute has "or," and it will not be double, and
it will be established at the trial by proof of
any one of them.
In the opinion the court thus pays its
respects to the law :
The act is not well drawn. Upon the con
trary, it is entirely too crude to leave
the hands of the State Legislature, especial]
when we consider the importance of the legis
lation with which that body was then dealing.
"We cite a single instance in illustration of
*l these remarks, end then leave the act with the
â¢ present Code Commission as furnishing ample
material for substantial reconstruction. One
clause provides that any person is guilty "who
shall unlawfully board any passenger train
with the intention of robbing the same." The
meaning of the phrase, "unlawfully board any
passenger train," by reason of its Indefinite
ness and uncertainty, but serves the purpose
of giving work to the lawyers and worry to the
courts; but the last part of the clause", to-wit.
"with the intention of robbing the same"
(passenger train), is worse than the first. As
to what is meant by robbing a passenger train
we will not indulge in surmise.
The act arose from the necessity of the time,
and was created for the purpose of stopping
train-wrecking and punishing train-wreckers.
The act so declares its purpose in terms, and
aside from one clause thereof such purpose is
patent upon the most casual inspection of its
provisions. It covers four distinct and sepa
rate branches of the subject, to wit:
1. Every person who shall unlawfully throw
out a switch, remove a rail or place any ob
struction upon . any railroad in the State of
California, with the intention of derailing any
passenger, freight or other train.
2. Who shall unlawfully board any passen
ger train, with the intention of robbing the
same. -;;â¢- â -
3. Who shall unlawfully place any dynamite
or other explosive material or other obstruc
tion on the track of any railroad in the State
of California, with the intention of blowing up
or derailing any passenger, freight or other
train. . i
4. Who shall unlawfully set fire to any rail
road bridge or trestle orer which any passen
ger, freight or other train must pass, with the
intent of wrecking said train.
The whole purpose and tenor of the act Is
directed against train-wrecking, and this is
true as to subdivision equally with all other
subdivisions. At first glance the clause would
seem to be directed toward the suppression of
the crime of robDery, but the offense of rob
bery is only incidentally involved, and the
prevention of the wrecking of the train, and
the consequent and natural results followingâ
of injury and death to its passengersâ its
prime 'purpose. Whatever else the clause
means, it imports acts of violence upon the
train. It imports to a more or less degree the
subjection of the employes to the robbers, the
menace and duress of the employes, a loss of
control of the train by them, fright upon their
part and even death. These things being so,
the probabilities of destruction of the .train
and passengers follow as necessarily as such
probabilities would follow the misplacing of a
switch or the removal of a rail. Hence we say
that every part and clause of the act is directed
toward the suppression of train-wrecking.
The information in this case is clumsily
drawn in this, that it is not directly and spe
cifically shown that it was the same passenger
train toward which the two unlawful acts
charged against the defendant were directed.
But we think such fact fairly inferable from
the pleading, and the entire record indicates
the case to have been tried upon such assump
tion. The further point is made that there is
no such thing as robbing a passenger train,
and that the statute in that regard is meaning
less. "Robbing a store," "robbing a safe" and
"robbing a train" are every-day, ordinary and
common expressions. Very possibly it is in
this sense that the Legislature used the verb
"rob," and not in connection with the tech
nical meaning of the offense of robbery. Bat
aside from this the trial court told the jury
what was meant by robbing a train, and no
complaint is here made that such construction
of the law was not sound.
The opinion was written by Justice Ga
routte and was . concurred in by Justices
McFarland, Van Flee t and Harrison. Jus
tice Temple wrote a dissenting opinion, in
which be said the information was fatally
defective, as it should so charge the crime
that conviction . would inevitably follow
were its , charges proved. Justice. Hen
shawaiso wrote, an opinion of the .me
nature. There was a demurrer to the in
formation submitted in the: lower court,
which was overruled, and the appeal: was
from this judgment as well as from the
judgment in the case. All this means tbat
Thompson is in imminent danger of being
hanged. â ' -. â  â .- " "â - -' 7; ' V'y7yy>--

CALLS JORDAN A PIGMY.
Rev. Mr. Fraser Gives His
Opinion of Stanford's '
President.
Dr. Case Firmly Denies Having In

tionalism.
Rev. Professor Brown of Stanford Uni
versity addressed the Presbyterian Minis
terial Association yesterday on "The Re
lation of . Religion and Progress." The
speaker described what religion has ac
complished from antiquity to the present
time in acting as an inspiration to archi
tects, poets, musicians and painters, as
well as in advancing morality.
In the discussion Rev. Dr. Minton spoke
of the paper as a cannon-ball of power.
Rev. Mr. Fraser expressed the wish that
Professor Brown would lecture as fre
quently in public as President Jordan of
Stanford -, lectures in order .to counteract
the influence of : the president. He said
he had marked with deep regret the treat
ment given by President Jordan to Bal
four's latest book, "The Foundations of
Belief." "I have read Balfour's book," he
added, "and I consider that beside him
Jordan becomes a pigmy. " Rev. Be
vier said that the recent controversy be
tween Herbert Spencer and Lord , Salis
bury, before the British Association proved
that people were beginning to take an in
terest in controverting the statements of
non-believers., â  . v. --:-'-. â¢;;â¢"
Methodi.t Preachers.
The subject of St. Paul's homiletic3
aroused quite a lively discussion yesterday
at the Methodist preachers' meeting, on
'the science of sermonizing in general and
the way in which ; it "Is . practiced ;in local
pulpits in particular. .. Â7-v.^
Rev. Dr." Nelson was the speaker who
made the address on â¢ homiletics. He con
fined himself principally to St. Paul's
methods of preaching, but also spoke very
disapprovingly of the modern method of
announcing the topic of the sermon before
hand, and regretted that, in his estima
tion, the pulpit of to-day is too miscel- 1
laneous. ,' I
In discussing the paper Rev. ; Dr. Case
said: "I have been accused of sensational
preaching."' .'? "I object," said 7 Rev. B.
Chenoweyth. "There were no ' personal j
allusions .in Dr. . Nelson's ;' paper and - Dr.
Case is wandering from the subject." This
question being put to the meeting, it was
resolved to let Dr. Case continue,- and he
said: "There yis nothing j > sensationally
offensive in what I preach. 7 I believe we
ought to take the conditions of things as
they are and coin against the wickedness."
Rev. E. M". Hill said: "I believe Paul
spoke about politics several times and in
the name of common-sense is not a man
to speak about surrounding conditions to
day?" y ;;â¢' â â _.- Â°. ; -
This question was answered to some ex
tent by Rev. Dr.- Urmy, who remarked :
"It is well for I Dr. Case or any other man
to preach against the evils of the day, and
yet I think there is great danger in preach
ing that allures a crowd. -Does it lead to
anything? Has Dr. Case? had any con
verts?" - â¢â â â¢
"Yes 1" . replied Dr. Case emphatically.
"I have had one or two Catholics."
"What were they converted to, Protest
antism or Christianity?" asked Dr.
Urmy. â  â¢â¢'.. 77. .
"Both," replied Dr. Case. -
7 "I am glad to hear it," said Dr.. Urmy.
"Dr. Case can be sure of his converts for
ho can examine; them phrenologically."
. Rev. E. J. Henderson X bore y evidence 'to
the fact that he had been much blessed by
Dr. Case's sermon. y 7, ~ ,
; "Now.that Dr. Case has been vindicated
we can discuss the paper," said Dr." Coyle.
"I believe in letting the word be sits : own :
interpreter." Referring to the advertising'
of topics, Rev. Dr. Bentley said:' "I have

cluding the discussion Dr. Nelson hurled
this parting shot at his brethren : "I have

laneous, If you announce â¢ a text and
preach as . miscellaneously as you have
discussed this paper you have* exposed

FOR A VERY OLD DEBT.
Paderewski's Private Secretary
Threatened With a
' Lawsuit.
A Reminiscence of a "Pinafore" Pro
duction of Sixteen Years Ago. -7
Costly Costumes.
Hugo Goerlitz, private secretary for Pad
erewski, received a letter from the Reid
Collection Agency yesterday demanding
the immediate payment of a bill amount
ing to $541, of wnich $290 is interest and
$251 principal. The bill was alleged to
have been contracted with G. Verdier &
Co., "the City of Paris," in 1879. In the
event of the demand not being met a suit
at law is threatened, and the letter goes on
to say:
-In the proceedings suggested we . would
bring you before tne court for examination as
to your financial standing. To insure our get
ting correct information we would feel bound
to subpena Mr. Paderewski as a witness. We
trust that you will save us all this trouble by
complying with our request immediately and
yourself the expense incident thereto.
The bill is for dresses and other things
alleged to have been furnished to Mrs.
Goerlitz, of which the principal items
are a black suit with lace overdress, $70;
white Peking satin suit, $120; pink wrap
per, $50. ; :â¢ y â¢ , ,
Mr. Goerlitz saw a representative of the
bouse yesterday afternoon, and while de
claring that he never contracted the debt
and did not owe it; offered to pay the
principal rather, than \ have" any trouble
about it. 7 The offer was declined, how
ever, and the whole amount demanded or
nothing. 7He then said he would pay
nothing, but would fight the whole claim.
y "When I was on- my wav East from
Australia,'' said Mr. Goerlitz -yesterday,
"I stopped here in company with my wife,
Amy 7 Leslie. "7 1 was very young and inex
perienced. 'U< Fred 7 Lister ;. and another in
duced us to .present' the opera of "Pina

costumes. -.;,.â¢...
."Mr. Lister brought a representative of
the City of Paris to my wife at the' Bald

did so, and " that order jis : represented in

for this debt, but would rather pay it than

The following communication is self
explanatory :
B. F. HIDELSOK, V. F. BAK.ES, ..
State President. State Secretary.
Office State Cocxcil of California, ]
Room 40, Academy ot Sciences I
Bulletin.. 819 Market street, f
San Francesco, Cal., Feb 10, 1896. J
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: In tor- i
met communications I have set .forth the
"Objects of the A. P. A." and the "A. P. A.
Platform," both formulated by the- Supreme
Council of the United State.. Herewith I hand
yon an official statement or the "Political Prin
ciples of the A. P. a.." enunciated by. the Na
tional Advisory Board, "which met; in; St. Louis |
during October, _*â¢.Â«.">.
With tnis letter I conclude my statement of |
the principles to which the American Protec- |
tive Association stands committed. Heretofore
and throughout this letter I have confined my
self to such statement in order that first of all |
your readers maybe afforded a general view, j
at once clear and comprehensive, of the.broad
principles upon which the ' American â  Pro
tective Association is founded. That 1 might
not seem to be In any way obscuring the issues >
1 have conscientiously avoided interpolating j
anything which might be deemed in any de- !
cree an interpretation or an application of |
those principles. Such consideration will fol
low in proper course, yv
I have,- However, submitted certain ques
tions upon the principles set forth in order to
secure from our adversaries, if possible, a
definite statement of their position. These
questions have been addressed to Rev. Peter
C. Yorke, he being the opponent of A. P. A. ism
now most prominently before tne public, but
they. may be considered with equal right
addressed to every American citizen, whether ;
friend or enemy of the A. P. A., whether cleric j
or layman, whether Protestant or Catholic.
In this letter, too, Mr. Editor, 1 submit ad- |
ditional questions. These refer to the "politi
cal principles of the A. P. A.," ami in order to
prevent confusion each question follows the I
s-.'ction to which it refers. The "Political Prin
ciples of the A. P. A." will be found in quoted
paragraphs.
THE political PRINCIPLES OF the A. P. A.
1. -'Restriction of immigration, so as to prevent t
the landing on our shores of paupers, criminals
and anarchists.'' fil3SSÂ£spÃÃgQÂ£n>l@___
Question '23â Is Mr. Yorke opposed to such
restriction of Immigration as will prevent pau
pers, criminals and anarchists from landing oil
our shores?
'_'. "Extension of the time for naturalization, to
the end that foreigners may become familiar with
our tree institutions and laws before they take part
in our political ..rtY.irs
Question ' 2-4â Mr. Yorke hostile to the ex
tension of the time for naturalization, to the
end that foreigners may become familiar with
our institutions and laws before they be per
mitted to vote? v : y >y.j;
3. --Educational qualification for every voter, to
enable him to understand the duties of "citizenship
and not become rely th. tool of politicians."
Question -/> â Does Mr. Yorke oppose an edu
cational qualification for every voter? Does
he wish them to be ignorant of "the duties and
privileges of citizenship and the pliant tools of
politicians. yv â¢x. X . ;s .,
4. fc One general non-sectarian free public school
system, supported by public funds, and sufficient
for the primary education of all children."
Question 26â Does Mr. Yorke oppose sup
porting from the public funds one general non
sectarian free public school system sufficient
for the primary education of our children?
5. -'No public funds or public property to be used
for sectarian purposes, directly or indi:ectly." â¢
Question 27â Does Mr. Yorke favor using
public funds or public property for sectarian
purposes whether directly or indirectly?
6. "Taxation of all property not* owned and con
trolled by the Government."
Question 28â Does Mr. Yorke oppose the tax
ation of all non-Governmental property?
7. "All private schools, con vents, nunneries, mon
asteries, seminaries', hospitals, asylum., and other
educational or charitable institutions to be open to
public Inspection and under Government control."
Question 29â Does Mr. Yorke oppose the pub
lic inspection of all private schools.' convents,
nunneries, monasteries, seminaries and other
educational or charitable institutions? . j.-f.'. : .
8. "No person who recognizes allegiance, to any
foreign or ecclesiastical potentate as superior to that
of our General Government shall be supported for
any official position whatever."
Question 30â Does Mr. Yorke support for
office any person who recognizes allegiance to
any foreign or ecclesiastical i potentate as supe
rior to our Government? .
9. "American land for actual settlers only."
Question 31â Is Mr. Yorke in favor of grant
ing public lands to other than actual settlers?
The questions which I have heretofore asked
of Peter C. Yorke have referred to the princi
ples of the American Protective Association as
set forth in its declaration of objects and in
its platform. That he has thus far refused to
answer them is not surprising, inasmuch as he
being a clever man must realize that nothing
can be urged . against the . principles of the
order. But inasmuch as he may see' fit to
attempt to explain the position lie has taken
against those principles as an opponent of the
order founded upon them, for his convenience
I repeat my questions here, y--; y

CLOSED THE GOLD MINE.
Why William H. Thomas of Murphy.
Is Puzzledâ The Activity ln Cala
.'/ veras County. '.'
William H. Thomas, one of the owners
of the Central Hill hydraulic mine, at the
edge of Murphys Camp, Calaveras County,
is at the Russ. He is much perturbed be
cause work has been stopped on his mine.
He says the season is very short â not over
sixty days, anywayâ and that there is no
telling when the mine will be allowed . to
lesume, as the Debris Commissioners,
though appointed, have not been con
firmed. 'Ââ¢"" â¢ .
"I am afraid it will prevent us from get
ting out any gold this year," he said.
"VVe were shutdown by Captain C. E. Gil
lette of the War Department, but : just
whr.t for I cannot see. There were some
technical notices sent us, and . we con
formed to them as near us we could in
constructing our flumes and other work.
We had fourteen men engaged, and the
stopping of our work was an outrage.
"We are sixty miles from navigation,
and there is not a river within nine or ten
miles. The.water we use is all carefully
saved and used over and over. The debris
does not go into any stream or bother any
body in any way. Because of all this none
of us can see why we have been stopped.
The captain's only reason is that , in some
way. as he thinks, we did not auite come
up to the technical requirement. It has
caused us great inconvenience.
"The mines of Calaveras County never
looked better, than at present. | -A- great
deal of prospecting is being done and new
properties are being opened. There is
especial activity in quartz mining. I am
of the opinion many big mines will be de
veloped on the mother lode there in the
next year or two. The interest in mining
there is increasing." â < .
A MINING BOOM COMING
The Owner. of Many Mines Pre
dicts a Big Revival This
Summer. .
Improvements About the Rawhideâ A
Foundry Restores Jamestown
to Life.
j
The man who owns the . Rawhide, the
App, the Heslep, the Hitchcock and the j
Valparaiso mines says that the industry i
which first attracted the. world to Califor- j
nia is on the eve of a great awakening that !
is not ' appreciated even in so interested I
a commercial center as San Francisco.
"There is going to be a terrible boom i
this summer in gold mining," said Colonel
W. Nevils at his. apartments in the Palace
yesterday afternoon. "It will revive as the
great industry of this State.
"For thirty years I have been in that
country under which the mother lode
stretches, and I have owned at different
times the best mines in the counties of
Tuolumne and Calaveras. The Utica
j mine, now so well known for its enormous
I output, was my property before it was pur
chased by the present owners.
"Amador, Tuolumne and Calaveras are
I the principal 1 mining counties, and I
j know every hole in them. 1 have tramped
all over that country for twenty years,
and packed" my blankets; . that is why I
feel tnat I know something of the mines
and of the prospects of a boom.
"There is a little old place in Tuolumne
County â¢ called Jamestown. â¢ It was a \ '49
mining town, and, like a good many others
of the same class, it became only an evi
dence of bygone prosperity and: of men
departed for other diggings." Two or three
years ago you could have bought that
whole town for $40.
"But it has taken on new life., A fine
large foundry has just been completed
there by Demarest & - Fuller. 'The works
are now running and giving employment
to forty men. -Saloons, .stores and other
money-gathering enterprises have started
up round the new center. It is midway
between the App and the Rawhide mines,
which will furnish the main source of rev
enue to the foundry. 77 /:
"In the â  Rawhide <we are j opening' two
new .levels, . the 800 and 900. But
the most important improvement is the
establishment of an electric plant, now al
most perfected. ... It will cost $50,000, and
will be used not only to light the -whole
works, but to run all the machinery. : The
power is obtained from springs above
Columbia, about seven miles distant, and
the water, conveyed through an 11-inch
pipe, furnishes a pressure of 1100 feet at
themine. â "':';
"One hundred men are employed in the
Rawhide, whicn -is 7- virtually bur head
quarters. The - App, the Heslep and the
Hitchcock are- three miles away and are:
all on the mother lode. V
"About three miles east from the Raw
hide we have had men prospecting for six
months in the Valparaiso. It is on a vein
outside the lode. _hey have run a tunnel
in about 400 feet and have reached good
ore. â¢â¢Â»;. . . â  . --..'.... â ..â â '.
"It is a mistake to think that a mining
camp is necessarily a crude, uncomfort
able place. 7 The little community at the
I Rawhide is very comfortably housed amid
I picturesque surroundings. " y ~ \
'.'Mrs. Nnvils.and I spend a good deal of
I our time there. We are going up to-mor
! row for another, visit."
i
A Char;. Dismissed.
The case of -Martin. Hughes, ex-Deputy
Sheriff, charged by Mrs. Hugh Sellick with as
sault with a deadly weapon, was dismissed by

THE ORIGIN OF MOKASTICISM.
Its Influence Upon Civilization Ex
plained by the Eminent Paulist
-â¢ Preacher.
Rev. Father Wyman, superior of the
Paulist community â¢in I San Francisco,
addressed the Educational Union at Metro
politan Hall last night. His subject was
"Religious Communities." There was a
large attendance and the lecturer was
listened to with marked interest.
.'- Father Wyman is a New Englander of
old Puritan descent and embraced Catho
licity in late years. He spoke as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen: It is my intention
to speak of religious communities in general
without considering the specific differences
among the various order* in the church.
THE ORIGIN O. THE MONASTIC IDEA.
This subject ' developed from the" beginning
embraces a vast field, for it is co-extensive with
the history of religion. Ever since the tail of
man the recognition of the necessity of human
effort and divine grace for the fulfillment of
man's true destiny has led chosen souls to seek
retirement from material pursuits, seclusion
from worldly strife and abstinence from lawful
pleasures for the purpose of attending more
closely to their spiritual interests.
Holy Scripture specifically prescribes rules
under the Mosaic law for a chosen class called
Nazarites. A school of prophets also flour
ished for centuries under the same dispensa
tion, and as the time for the promised Messias
drew near the last and the greatest of proph
ets, St. John the Baptist, the precursor of our
Savior, appeared leading a life which seemed
in austerity well nigh impossible to, human
nature. The life of Christ -. as a perfect exem

plification of the principle and Idea of mo
nastic-ism. His voluntary poverty, immacu
late chastity and perfect" obedience have fur
nished the model for all Christian monastic
institutes. While the universal law-giver does
not exact of every one the practice of the vir
tues which belong to the monastic state there
is perfect harmony and no contrariety be
tween them and the precepts of the gospel.
The evangelical counsels are. the complement
of the Christian precepts. The principle which
underlies both is one and the same. The ob
servance of any one of the counsels is impossi
siblc without the keeping of the correspond
ing precept. The counsels begin where the
precepts leave off. . .
It is necessary for. the proper understanding
of the evangelical code of morals to know the
distinction between the Christian precepts and
counsels .and their . relation -to each other.
Those who ignore this distinction always have ,
a one-sided and frequently a distorted idea of
the gospel. Fanaticism, , for instance, some
times would make a commandment out of a
counsel, but a principle thus stretched is sure
to snap and it ends in most cases with the
breaking of a real precept. The diversity of
gifts and graces from; God is as great as* the
number of individuals. -Moreover, men are
not naturally constituted, alike in the moral
and spiritual anymore than they are in the
physical order, hence it follows that: the ob
servance of; such rules as voluntary poverty,
chastity and obedience was never intended by
! our Lord for all mankind, but is only a counsel
for those who have the grace and the aptitude
for following it. But with the commandments
it is different; the keeping of them is necessary
for entrance into the kingdom of. God, conse
quently all men can with ordinary grace
observe them. .
This is what Christ means when he says,
"My yoke is easy, my burden is light." But
every one who is familiar with the New Testa
ment knows : that the extraordinary virtues,
poverty, obedience and every exalted
virtue are there taught, and unless they are
recognized as practicaDl. ; and : applicable to
particular individuals, a portion of the teach
ing and example of Jesus Christ is made void.
It avails little for Christ to teach that'll is good
for one "to sell all that he has and give it to the
poor," to leave father, mother, wife, in short,
leave all things to follow him, unless it can be
made practical. .. These truths need to be insti
tuted and exemplified in the lives of men and
I women in our midst, otherwise this part of tho
! gospel teaching is without effect. . History
j shows that for nearly 1900 years these coun
sels, as well as the precepts of our ) Saviour,
have been followed by. numbers, and, as all
wiil admit, to the building up and extension
of the Christian religion in the world. I have
given, as every candid man must acknowl
edge, the only satisfactory explanation of the
origin of the monastic state. ;
THE INFLUENCE OF J MONASTICISM * UPON -THE
CHURCH 'AND THE WORLD.
7 Just as the sanctity of St. John the Baptist
and the infinite holiness of Jesus Christ drew
to them the multitude; so in the apostolic and
the age next succeeding it the â  lives of many
of the Christians, which were as detached from
the world, as mortified, as self-denying as evar
has been known ;in the strictest ;> religious
orders," brought about the conversion of vast
numbers of .people of every race. There was
not the necessity then for those who aspired to
follow the counsels to separate themselves
from the general Christian* communities as
there has been since that time, for the constant
persecution to which they were exposed, their
ability to profess and -practice their religion
[ only at the ; risk of â¢' losing everythingâ even
their practically severed them from the
world.--. ; ':.".":.â¢..â¢â ;'-..-...-â¢â¢ .'.,..-
But the virtues which later formed the basis
of the monastic state were all practiced in the
highest degree by ' many Â» persons in the first
ages of the church. . This is such a well-known
fact that the iounders of the strictest religious
.institutes in later times never claimed that the
observance of their rules would constitute a
manner of life comparable in any degree to
that of the apostles of Christ and their im
i mediate successors. The influence of the prin
j cle of self-denial in . : Christianity has, : as ; the
history of the church 1 shows, contributed so
largely to r its extension *in ? the world; and its
I progress and triumph among all civilized na
tions, that it â -â  is impossible, to conceive â¢ how
Christianity could ever have prevailed or ever
have endured for so long a time without at
least the striving of elite souls to realize, in a
measure the . high :' ideal proclaimed by, the
Savior in the "Sermon" on t the Mount,'!, and
practiced by. him with absolute .perfection
while on the earth. X : //X-X:-/: â¢' :â¢-â -.:-â¢-.". ,
Even tne law of Christ cannot be discerned
by the great < mass iof sinful men unless it
! shines forth in the lives of .individuals .'who
I also aim at practicing the counsels as ; well.'
! If the higher spiritual life had not been sus
j tamed in the church by established? institutes
with rules embodying the evangelical?coun
sels, the teaching of the I gospel; would- never
have been - com plete. â #. With, the "carrying of
them into practice, accompanied as they 'â  must
often be by .the?. active ? work of teaching,
preaching, nursing of tbe sick,? caring; for, the
. poor, etc., there is the same^ necessity for or
ganization that there is for ; public t worship
and the administration of ; the -sacraments. ':
! Christianity ' has /â  succeeded 's because \ it : came
! into the world not as a naked idea,? but as an ,
j organized force, and the monastic .principle," '.
In part, at least, took form immediately ; in the
i association of individuals, for. we read in Holy
Scripture Â§ that ; the *. first Christians . had ' all ;
| things in common, selling all their possessions
and; goods. and dividing them among all as
every one had need (Acts ii:4l-45). cYT Xi ycv
Thus was evangelical poverty put in practice
under the -direction of Â£ the apostles. : The
evangelical virtue of J chastity,' also, took form
in | the apostolic college, none of the, .twelve;
living with wives after entering. upon the
â work of the ministry; an example .which was
followed so far that marriage was only, toler
ated to a limited extent among the clergy in
the Eastern church, > and .in the Western
church, not at all.. The discipline of celibacy,
with the clergy is practically as old as Chris
tianity; The influence of. the monastic prin
ciple in the church then has directly shaped
the character of the ministers 01 religion, and
indirectly that of the people. . Vast numbers
of Christians in ail ages have practiced the
evangelical - counsels by 7 themselves and -in
communities, so much so, in fact, that I it. can
never be said that the sublimest teachings of
our â Lord have - failed .to become practical
among Christians. :;i --."â *â¢ --â "â :â 
I have \ thus far. considered the | influerce of
the monastic principle upon the religious life
of Christians in all ages.;. Now there have also
been influences exerted by i. on the social life
of men which are well worth considering. In
every age and country the church: has found
the world the great obstacle to her efforts to
romote Christian-- perfection. St. Augustine
speaks .f two cities, one the city of the world,
the other the city of God. These two cities are
founded .upon . different principles and ' ruled
by different maxims; they may be said to be
perpetually at war. with each other with no
possible ; compromise between *' them. Christ
said, "I am not of the world, and therefore the
wor'.d hateth me," He also declared, "My
kingdom is not of this world." There have
always been many worldly minded Christians
who have doubtd the necessity of this an
tagonism between the two cities and have
wished for a reconciliation of the kingdom of
Christ with that ot the world. The monastic
system nas always been the strongest barrier
to this idea because founded wholly . on a
supernatural basis with principles and rules of
action directly opposed to the maxims of the
world. -.. -.-.-.. - â  -.- , â '.."'.; ......
: -With worldlings the acquisition of wealth
has always been a matter i of the greatest im
portance. - To be able to live only by labor is
considered by them a terrible hard hip, yet the
conditions of human existence are necessarily
such that I for the vast majority of men there is
no escape for it. Only a few of the most saga
cious and talented men under favorable cir
cumstances can:: possibly reach the goal of
wealth, and that, generally .peaking, at the
expense of the multitude, whose condition
must be lowered for their special benefit.
Contempt for riches, a voluntary choice of a
life of labor and poverty, honor and love be
stowed upon the poor, is, if not an offense,
certainly the greatest folly in their eyes. The
voluntary practice of poverty, however, has
enabled the church to oppose successfully | the
inordinate passion for wealth: She has thereby
rendered poverty honorable and created a re
spect for the poor and has checked eagerness
for wealth by humbling the pride of the rich
and making them feel that their possessions
add nothing to their dignity.
â  The practice of evangelical poverty in the
church has, I might say, set up the kingdom of
God on earth and introduced among men the
divine standard of -judgment.: History shows
that when the monastic institutes were most
flourishing and the monastic virtues were in
their greatest vigor wealth did not rule society
as it formerly | had done and as it has since
done 'everywhere where monastic institutes
have declined. The problem, What to do with
the poor,' is "perhaps the most serious question
of - to-day. ,- Preachers, philosophers, philan
thropists and even politicians are raking their
brains to solve this question, which threatens
the peace of society in our large centers of pop
ulation. But I am convinced that merely
natural remedies cannot succeed. Christian
ity alone strikes at the root of the evil, which
is avarice. Protestantism, however, having
discarded the monastic principle of voluntary
poverty, has lost its hold on the poor and its
power to restrain the rich, and therefore it is
powerless to remedy the evil.
THE PRACTICE OF CHASTITY.
-- No less striking- is - the uncompromising
principle which is found in the practice of
chastity; by the, monastic Hstitutes. This is
fully as much opposed to the spirit of worldli
ness as the practice of poverty,. yet it has won
from the world the highest admiiation. How
could it be otherwise? Only corrupt heart,
can fail to see the attractiveness of self-denial,
the heroism oi sacrifice, the beauty of sanctity
and purity. Vast armies of missionaries all
vowed to the practice of this sublime virtue
brought the nations oi Europe into the church.
All Christians, who have before them the
highest ideal of this virtue, must also have a
higher regard for the moral law. Polygamy,
concubinage and all forms of licentiousness
which prevailed under paganism were, after
the church was established, no longer sanc
tioned. The, indissolubility of | marriage be
came the law of all nations. The exaltation of
chastity by the church proves her to be spouse
of Christ. In vain is it to look elsewhere for
the full realization in the -lives of men of the
sublime doctrine of the New Testament con
cerning purity. ,;'.. .1.. _,--'â 
When Protestantism abolished the rule of
continence for her clergy, she also degraded
marriage from a sacrament to a mere civil con
tract and introduced divorce. Those who aim
only at the lowest are sure never to attain to
the highest, and are likely to miss even the
lowest. Now here is the difference as shown
by actual results: The monastic principle ef
fected a real reform by bringing the most cor
rupt pagan nations up to the New Testament
standard ;of purity. Protestantism has been
powerless, even when it has tried to do so, to
prevent the peoples, professing its doctrines
from lapsing back, in a measure, to the old
heathen standard of morality. .
Obedience which requires an abnegation of
self, in imitation of Christ, who humbled him
self, took . the form of a servant and became
"obedient. unto â even the death of the
cross"â who only willed what his Heavenly
Father willed, and said, "Father, not my will,
but thine be done," is the greatest of the vir
tues of a religions life. "Learn of me. for lam
meek and humble of heart," says our Lord.
Humility is the root of every Christian vir
tue, and it requires that every Christian should
obey the law of the , God evert unto death, but
the monastic principle requires ' an additional
practice of obedience in | all things not of sin
that souls may thereby acquire and maintain
the habit of perfect acquiescence in the divine
will, even j beyond what the law strictly re
quires. Pride is the prevailing intellectual
vice. It was what led to the first act of diso
bedience, which led to the fall of man, and it
has always been the great obstacle of iaitn.
The practice of obedience, even in matters
in which Christians are ordinarily free, has
taught the world, as it could be taught in no
other way, faith and obedience .to the law of ,
Christ. Faith and obedience are the virtues
which have sustained the Christian religion
in the .world. There could be no universal
church without them. Authority is the one
thing which distinguishes our Lord, from all
other religious teachers, and his church is the
-one institution in the world which speaks as
he spoke, and obedience is what sustains this
authority. The practice, of this virtue iri .the
churchy and in its highest form in religious
communities inculcates obedience to all law
ful authority. The obedience of children to
parents and of citizens to the state is strength
ened by it. ' ...
While inculcating the duty of obedience to
authority the spheres of church and state are,
however, distinctly marked- and separated by
the church. The state in its ; own sphere is
just as independent as the church. Just as the
church has supreme authority in- spiritual
matters so has the state ; supreme authority in
temporal matters. Religious obedience, there
fore, strengthens civil allegiance.::: The suppo
sition that there can be any opposition or con
tradiction y between the authority 'of the
church and civil authority,^ provided each
keeps to its own .sphere,: can never en
ter the mind of an enlightened * Catholic.
The measure of our love for the church is the
measure of our love oi country. Father Hecker,
.the founder of the Paulist community, used to
say: 'I never understood what: the love of my
country meant until I became a Catholic." i.
it not. clear \ that the - practice of obedience in
one order must promote it in . another? Those
Governments .which have persecuted the
church and banished its religious orders have
only been working for their own destruction.'
They, have indirectly caused the^anarchial
movements of the; present century. _\ In every
country anarchists hate the church above all
institutions, because they recognize it as the
great bulwark: of civil government.
m have said enough,! think, to show the in
fluence of the monastic -institutes upon the
church and upon society.: The practice of pov
erty, chastity ., and obedience, which consti
tutes the essence oi the monastic state of life
are the sublime virtues which have proved our
religion to bo divine more convincingly to the
masses of mankind than all the sermons that
bave ever been preached and all the books that
have ever been written. y ; /,. :
THE WORK OK RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE
UNITED BTATES..; â '.--' "-
The increase of religious communities in this
country has kept pace with the progress of the
church. > The great historic orders have many
members in this country and" are I conducting
flourishing colleges and have tin f all our large
cities mission and parish churches, to which
the people flock in great numbers. -Bands of
missionaries are preaching and administering
, the sacraments at regular intervals in all our
chnrcnes throughout the land. i '
... â  â¦2 rders oi women ' are ; more numerous
than those of men, and. we 'find them'every
where conducting * parochial schools,:- acad
emies, asylums and .hospitals. The vocations"
:to all these institutes now ] come mostly from
our native-born Catholics. 'â - Nowhere inÂ« the
wide world do they succeed better than in this
free and enlightened 'â â  republic. ? This shows,
beyond all question; that : they are not antago
nistic^ to our -political and social institutions/
our > Government has always 3 recognized y the
right of individuals to associate together for
; the accomplishment; of ;: religious and philan
thropic work. With us, the state wisely deems
itself incompetent to regulate religious affairs,
: having enough to do in its own proper sphere.
on this account there is here the best possible
v or - all the ; religious _ institutes , of y the
church i. to i develop I and ' carry , ou _ this i great
.work for God's glory and the salvation of souls.
Is it not passing strange, ladies and gentle- ,
men. that in a great-country like ours, where
two-thirds of the population profess no definite
creed and :â¢ where, of \ the remaining oae- third
only one-half are enrolled under, the banner of
the r great mother :' church of â¢* Christendom,
where in spite of the great and, I might almost
say, divine doctrine of the; constitution of our
country .%that , all meu are created free and
equal, and where all have what never* would
have; been j: dreamed â¢of but for the glorious
truth of thÂ« Gospel, the guaranteed right of
life, liberty and the pursuit â¢"â¢ of hap
piness; : where. . gold is fairly, worshiped,,
where capital is combined to strip cur fertile
fields of their products, and bankrupt farmers:
where wealth has a royalty of its own on every
manufactured article wrung from the life's
blood â of Â» our free j and 4 enlightened â¢ working
men; where. monopoly holds in its relentless
grasp our marts of trade reducing our once
prosperous merchants to the *. pittances of
clerks and salesmen ; where the stock exchange
ensnares the unsuspecting to sacrifice their
meager, savings; in ruinous speculation and
foreclose its mortgages upon the u homes of
widows and orphansâ it not strange, I say,
that so many- among us aspire to imitate the
poverty of Jesus Christ? v Great . indeed is the
mystery of godliness I ,--*." .
J The age and country .we live in are also sadly
blighted by the greatest curse that has ever
fallen upon the human unchastity. Who
of us would not deny this if he could ? .The
very idea of. the i sanctity oorf r marriage is lost
among the majority of those who : ,are = not of
our faith. y Marriage outside the church is gen
erally only for pleasure or worldly advantage,'
and children, unless they are very few, are not
considered a blessing from ! God. The number
of men and women given over to licentiousness
is appalling, yet we find great numbers with
their innocence unsullied; some of them joy
fully enter religious communities. . If the Lord
should say, "I will destroy San Francisco un
less I find ten just persons," where should c- we
first look for. them ? I believe that all our peo.
pie, Catholic and Protestant, would instinct
ively turn to.our convents and religious houses.'
The besetting sin of every country requires
expiation, and can be arrested only by pure
souls, -healthy -and robust' souls, who do not
shrink from tne burden of the cross, volunta,
rily sacrificing what they might, if they chose
enjoy, and devoting themselves to prayer and
good works In reparation for the transgressions
of others, and to obtain for them the graces
which they need. There is no greater mistake
than to suppose that religions in their abnega
tion of the world and its temptations forget
the love of their neighbor. They are striving
for the salvatidn and sauctification of others
as well as their own. The vow of chastity does
not discredit marriage or anything else that is
lawful, but it is a sacrifice which procures for
the married the grace to keep the relation
holy and >to discharge faithfully all its duties.
When people are so far gone as to regard the
vow of chastity as something contrary to na
ture, how can they have even the proper ideal
of the marriage relation? What ought to be
thought of a man like Martin Luther, or any
ex-priest or nun, who has railed against the
vow of chastity ? Have they made the world
any better ? Have they raised or have they
lowered the world's standard of morality
When such persons claimed the right to set
aside the vow of chastity, is it any wonder that
conscienceless laymen on the same grounds
claimed the right to dissolve the marriage
bond? What a shame it is that the multitudes
of chaste, noble and charitable Protestants
have to trace the origin of their religion back
to such a sewer of corruption as this V
But it might be argued, were there not scan
dals in religious houses to bring them into dis
repute? Even if there were, what, I would
like to know, became of those who had given
scandal? % Did they, become martyrs, or flee
the country and retire into monasteries for
penance? No, indeed, the change in -religion
was most welcome to them. j If tne Catholic re
ligion were corrupt, would they not have pre
ferred to remain in it? . Indeed, it is it poor ex
cuse for leaving ary church because there are
unworthy members in it. Those who give up
their iaitn on account of scandals are gener
ally not much better than those who give the
scandal. "Scandals must . come," says our
Lord, "but woe be to those by whom they
come." :It cannot be otherwise when human
nature is what it is. - Church scandals were ex
aggerated, no. doubt; in the sixteenth century
just as much as they are to-day. Permit me to
say-that only a few of the alleged scandals
among priests and religious of those days can
be substantiated. .:.-./;": .-â â 
The multitude of obscene stories about
priests and religions that were published and
scattered broadcast in those days are Ino more
worthy of -credence than; the. calumnies of
anti-Catholic agitators of to-day. jj It is a most
significant-fact, that in Ireland, where prob
ably the most exemplary priests, religions and
people of that period were to be found, the old
iaitn ; remained. : The .true-followers of our
Lord are indeed "the salt of the earth," and is
it not a blessing that we have a goodly num
ber of such in our midst? Need we be dis
couraged at the ravages made in our fair land
by error, greed . and immorality? Not at all.
Judging from past history it is not unreason
able to suppose that true Christian principles
may spread through the length and breadth of
our land and redeem it. - .
If the heritage of liberty which we have re
ceived from our forefathers remainsâ and may
God grant that greed and lust and oppression
never destroy itâ will be .because the pre
cepts and counsels of Jesus Christ live in the
hearts of our people. - '. â '>"-"> "*- ,
DECLARATIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION.
The.declarations embodied' in our constitu
tion, says Father Hecker, "are some of them
divine l and fundamental truths. They are
divine, inasmuch as they declare the rights of
the Creator in his creature; they are funda
mental, for without the enjoyment of the nat
ural rights which ; they proclaim man is not
man;- * * * they are practical, for man is or
ought to be, under his Cieator, the master of
his own destiny and free from any dominion
not founded in divine, right.. The Creator in
vested man with these rights in order that he
might fulfill the duties inseparably attached
to them." y; ;. Â r'-* '
Any power which, if it could, would de
prive a single â¢â  citizen of our country of
one iota of the religious liberty which
he now enjoys would offend God, act the
tyrant and be an enemy of mankind. We may
be sure that the religion which requires an un
compromising adherence to the truth of God
will never approve of a divided allegiance to
the State. : A ; popular government like ours,
founded upon universal suffrage, is a most effi
cient school, to teach us our dignity as citi
zens and Catholics. If instead of such
a glorious Government as - ours we
had , only a party .:â " despotism, for . sordid
irain or despicable ambition, the weaker ones
among us might possibly, be tempted to war
upon the rights of conscience of others, for our
own momentary advantage; but, with the
principles of Washington and Lincoln in the
very marrow of our .bones, and fortified and
strengthened by the faith we have learned
irom the chair of Peter, we are the safest and
most devoted citizens of this great republic.
Although a comparative stranger here in San
Francisco," yet, because I : am a Catholic priest
and a Paulist, I am trusted; my note with
every one is as good as gold; but if I had come
here as an anti-Catholic lecturer I could not
get a night's lodging in a hotel without paying
for it in advauce.
Love of truth was the first lesson that I ever
learned, and I never had to unlearn that lesson
in finding my way to holy mother church. I
traced the principle of truth which I had
learned to its source, and found its home to be
in the old church. He whose eyes are open to
the light of .first. principles, and has studied
true history, knows that the Catholic church
has battled during her whole lifetime for the
rights of the oppressed. Should it ever happen,
which God forbid! that any class' of citizens,
whatever be tneir religious creed, should be
denied equal rights : with all ' others 'in the
practice; and propagation of their faith, the
Catholics of this country would be the first to
take up their cause and to aid in securing for
them the privilege of others. ..
Have we not thus far stood for equal rights?
Have we ever wished to deny to others what
we have asked for ourselves? vWe have ".. some
times had to suffer. because others were envi
ous of our prosperity. Indeed, our enemies
have always argued that it was not safe to let
us have fair play, because we would be sure to
get ahead- of them. They point to figures and
say :'. "The United States is not yet a century
and a quarter old, and seeâ the Catholics here
are as numerous, as the communicants of all
other churches put together. If this increase
keeps on in the same proportion the Protestant
religion will yet disappear.'! This is like the
talk of the Pharisees about our Lord, "All the
people ; have, gone ' after him." ; Why are we
thus overwhelmed with the multitude? Why
is tlie doorbell-, of * every '= priest's house -rung
from ; morning till â '.: night? Why - are ; people
standing in our churches on Sunday; eager to
worship and hear the word of God?-, Ah! Ours
is the religion from which the water of eternal
life flow freely. . .. . . . y -'

LIABILITY OF SHIPOWNERS
Judge , Hawley Defines y the Re
sponsibility to Ship
pers.
AN IMPORTANT DECISION.
The Law of ? Limitation in Regard to
the Wreck of the Sctfooner- I
Steamer Emily. -
-
Judge Hawley handed down an impor
tant "decision," especially to ship-owners,
yesterday in the matter of j Albert Meyer
and others, owners of * the steam schooner
Emily, for a limitation of liability. 7
The steamer Emily was lost on the bay
at j Coos - Bay in July, 1893. Her remains
were turned over to a trustee and sold at
underwriters' sale I for j $130. The steamer
left Sari Francisco on July 7, 1893, and on
the way up rendered salvage service to the
Bawnmore," first towing" that ship into Cas
par Creek and thence ,to this port. On
July 14 she again left for Coos Bay, and on
July 7, while attempting to cross the bar
at Coos Bay, was totally wrecked.
The petitioners contended that they
were exempt from liability, and that if
liable at all they could only be held to the
extent of the value of the wrecked steamer
and freight pending; : -.-.â '..
Isaac Lando, a shipper of merchandise
on the last voyage of the Emily and an as
signee of other supplies, and as adminis
trator of the estate of C. Robinson, whose
life was lost at the time of the wreck of
the steamer, commenced suit in the United
States District Court as respondent, and
held that the petitioners were liable for
the loss independentof the limitation acts,
because the Emily was unseaworthy; be
cause of the unlawful deviation from her
voyage in bringing the Bawnmore back to
San Francisco; that such deviation, if al
lowable at all, under the act of February
13, 1893, was allowable only to the extent
of taking the vessel to Caspar Creek; that
by towing her to San Â§ Francisco the own
ers of the Emily became insurers of the
goods for the voyage and cannot plead any
limitation. â '. 'â  s "
7 Captain Roberts was ill when the Emily
returned from Caspar Creek, and placed
Captain Lucas in charge of th. steamer on
her last trip. The latter disobeyed the in
structions of- Captain Roberts in crossing
the Coos Bay' bar at ebb tide. These in
structions 7 being disobeyed, the steamer
was lost: -
The court held that while the Emily was
seaworthy the captain was not justified in
bringing the Bawnmore back to San Fran
cisco and thereby going out of its course.
He was justified, however, in taking the
vessel into Caspar Creek, but there were
tugs j present to render help if it were
needed. ..
'With reference to the death of C. Robin
son it was held to be occasioned by his
own negligent and improper conduct. He
would have been saved had he not insisted
on taking his baggage in the lifeboat with
him. . .
In summing up the evidence Judge
Hawley said :-;-..
It follows from the views already expressed
that under the act of 188. Captain Roberts is
liable in the proportion which his individual
share of tne vessel at the time of the affreight- '
ment bears to the wnole value of the goods
lost. As to the other owners, lam of the opin
ion that when all the testimony and all the
various acts of Congress are considered, they
are entitled to avail themselves of the pro
visions of section 42B3 etseq.. Revised" Statutes
United States. It extends to liability for every
kind of loss, damage and injury. This is the
.language: of the maritime law, and it is the
language of our statute, which virtually adopts
the law. . : * - - -
The interests of the owners other than Rob
erts to be surrendered is the value of the ves
sel at the end of the voyage, which in this
case would be at the time of the wreck after
t he disaster. Whenever the owner shall take

Commemoration of Luther's Death.
The 18th of February, of 'this year will be
the 350 th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther's
death. In view of the great historical and re
ligious interest attached to Luther's life and
work, even the circumstances connected with
his death, are regarded as so deeply interest
ing and significant as ,to call for special me
morial services on the :>soth return of that
day. Though the celebration cannot be so
general and demonstrative as was that of the
fourth centennial of Luther's birth, many of
the Lutheran churches in all parts of this
country are making preparations for a nroper
Observance of this occasion. Philadelphia
seems to have : taken, the lead in this matter,
where an Imposing gathering of Lutherans to
commemorate Luther's death will take place
at the Academy of Music. St. Paul's Evangel
ical Lutheran Church of this City, corner of
Eddy and Gough streets, will celebrate the
event with memorial services in the evening.
PARK MUSEUM IS NOTED
In Rank It Is the Fourth in the
United States at This
Time.
A Remarkable Craze for Objects of the
Days of the Pilgrim
Fathers.
Charles > P. .Wilcomb, the curator of the
Golden Gate Park Museum, returned a '
few days since after an absence of seven
weeks in the East where he went to look
after interests connected . with estates of
deceased relatives. While East. he visited
a number jof j the principal cities and in
each examined the museums and, met
those who. have chaige of them. 7 He said
yesterday: 'â¢"'"-.":'...' 7 â  '" "" ' ,'7'yy>
Meeting .these gentlemen ideas were ex
changed and many points were gained by me
that will be of value in the management of the
Park Museum. Of the museums in the United*
States San Francisco's ranks fourth. Those
that outrank it are the Metropolitan in New
York, the National in Washington | an. the
Fiera in Chicago. The Metropolitan is the
leading one, but the Field wilt no doubt in a
short time become one of the most interesting
in tbe United States. At this time there is a
great craze in the East for articles of colonial
times, particularly pewterware, and every old
house in the New England States is being ran
sacked from cellar Lto garret for curios to
satisfy the demands of collectors. 7 Â
From an aunt who died some time since I in
herited many old curious articles, for she was
a collector ; of such objects. I also inherited
some from my mother, and while in Maine,
New. Hampshire and Vermont purchased some
articles to complete my collection. â¢ These
make thirty- two cases which are on their way
here. ' These I will loan to the museum, and
when the annex is finished they will form a
colonial display, one portion of which will be
the New England kitchen of the olden days.
When the annex is finished many changes
will be made in the arrangement of the dis
plays. Many of the exhibits will be removed,
and they will be classified in a better manner
than they are now. While examining the
museums in the East I observed many things
which will be suggested to the Commissioners,
and if deemed favorable will result in a de
cided advantage in the opportunity of viewing
the many displays that are to be added.
The craze for objects that were in use in the
days of the Pilgrim Fathers is one of the
greatest that has ever possessed- collectors.
Why, little blue figured plates bring $3 and $4
c.oh, and they are considered very , cheap.
The display that I' have secured contains a
number of articles that are not to be found in
any of the many collections on exhibition.
It is expected that ex-Director-General
de Young will on his return from Europe
via China and Japan bring with him a
great many oriental curiosities.
- Superintendent McLaren, in speaking of
the museum, said that he was of the opin
ion that many of the exhibits embrace too
many specimens of the same class. "For
instance," said he, '"take tne stone mor
tars used by Indians.' There are "a large
number of these. ' Tbey are all of the same
shape and material the only difference in
them .is their size. I should think that a
pair of such would be sufficient."JAILED FOR MAY
SMITH'S MURDER
Charles Lemmerer Boasted i
of Being the Girl's
Strangler.
HAS ADVANCED AN ALIBI
A Case That Bids Fair to Be
One of a Number of
Mysteries.
THE POLICE IN THE DARK.
Robbery Appears to Have Been the
Only Incentive to Spur on the
Murderer.
' WomenJ whose business it is to lure men
on to sin, and who, with a merry laueh
and a bright sparkle in tbelr eye, have
absolutely no compunction in the thought
that their wiles are causing the disinte
gration â¢' of erstwhile happy families,
crowded about a slab at the Morgue yes
terday and wept as if their hearts would
break over the remains of one of their own
class. _B*_Â§i
They, had come to see "Little May"
Smith, who was strangled in her Morton
street den early' yesterday morning by
some miscreant, to pay her such tribute as
might be expected from sisters in shame.
They saw a terrible sight in that back
room of the charnel-house. The vivacious
little blonde girl, whose bright laughter
and merry song enlivened them the. day
before, whose coquettish dress and ways
were their envy, lay almost side by side
with an unidentified corpse more than
mutilated in flesh by the ravages of time.
Her short flaxen" hair, washed off her
forehead by the rude hand of the Morgue
porter, hung back as though it had never
been acquainted with curling-irons or hair-,
dressers. . The young woman's pretty garb
was replaced by a cold damp sheet and her
usually rosy- complexion had made way
for the dark red blotches of congested
blood. Worse than all else were the
finger-marks of the strangler on the girl's
delicate neck. i
It was a, terrible lesson May Smith's
sisters learned when they looked at her in
her sad state and it told to them more
than volumes of verbal sermons. No
wonder they wept and hastily deposited
their floral tokens before rusning into the
outer air. The silent story to them had
tome home.
But the woman is deaa now. The ques
tion arises,. Who is her assassin?
Her friends are asking it and the police
are .unable to answer. 'Up' till the
evening they were as unable to even
advance a tangible theory as they were
when the corpse was discovered. The only
evidence up to that time, or rather the
lack of evidence, indicated that the case
will be handed down in the police archives
recording the mysterious murders of
Frederika Drelland Caroline Prennell, both
of whom died at the hands of unknown
.' stranglers in this City. 7- 'i" X ' '.". * : ' ! ""-':â 
1 The murdered girl was but 20 years old,
luring tive of which she had been away
from a widowed mother, who lives at 28
Madison ' avenue. She. had a' pleasant
home there for any child $>f righteous in
clinations, but May had a penchant which
she felt inclined to follow. She took up
with many men and dropped them after a
time until she encountered Jack Smith, a
good-looking youth hardly three years her
senior, whose wife she posed as and lived
in Erastus Morey's house at 330 Geary
street.
Smith was brought into Captain Lees'
office yesterday, when he told of his liai
son with the girl, and he was sent out with
Detective Gibson to verify the story he
told. He euccecded in proving all his
steps from noontime until the moment
his friend O'Donnell roused him from a
card table with the announcement that
"Mamie has been murdered." He
was therefore allowed to go on
the promise that he would lend
his assistance to the police in their
work of discovering the murderer. Aside :
from the disgrace brought upon him .by
the revelation of his mode of living Smith
is crestfallen over the loss of the girl whom'
he appears to have held in high regard as
a valuable chattle. He has informed Cap
tain Lees of the only clew the police had
up to 10 o'clock last. night. . He says* that
the only person on earth capable of killing
the girl was a cook named Billy, who was
insanely jealous of her attentions to other
men. :â¢;â¢ -
This Billy, it appears, according to
Smith, has written the woman repeatedly
from San Diego, pleading with her to be
true to him. Last Friday Billy reached
this City, and the girl now dead told
Smith of his annoying her nightly. Smith
believes that this "cook, is' the man who
committed the; murder, and the police ]
hope to soon have him under arrest. y 7
Georgie Howard, the.young woman who
more than any other was closely associated
with May Smith, and who had almost an
adjoining den on Morton _ street, likewise
made a statement to the police. She re
lated the movements of herself and friend
from tne hour they breakfasted until after
their attendance at the theater and their
frequent libations. with male friends in
thoir respective places. :.â ::>.
The â¢ last Georgie Howard saw of
May Smith was at 10:55 o'clock ' at
night. 7>- At' that â¢ time May was "in
her own rooms drinking with two
young men, both blondes, whom shecould
recognize if she ever saw them again.
They were well dressed people and behaved
in a gentlemanly manner. They in no
way gave her the impression they would
be guilty of strangling the woman.
- What is more, the general makeup of
the two visitors was absolutely unlike that
of the usual visitors to the corner saloon
next to which is located the Smith den. :
This is a strong point in their |
favor, as their presence in the saloon
at any time during the night would have
been remarked. The full strength of this
statement is had . when it is known that
the murderer must have passed out of the
Smith woman's house after the crime into
the backroom of the saloon -and thence
through the barroom to the street. This
is shown by the fact that when L. Spense,
the rent collector who discovered the mur
der, called at the girl's house, the only
front door was -locked and he opened it
with his pass key. The other, or rear door,
was found to be open.
Many : theories in regard to the murder
have been poured into the ears of the
police,' who have been placed by Chief
Crowley on the Morton-street blockade.
The officers in charge yesterday were P.
H. Herring, Tim Doogan, T. A. Atcheson
and S.:Hinerman. "
One of the stories told them by an ex
cited individual, among ! a few hundred <
who attempted to get a view of the house
where the murder occurred, is that fa'; jeal
ous' woman chased a man off Grant avenue
with a horsewhip shortly before midnight,
and she subsequently, went up Morton
street declaring vengeance against. one of
tho denizens in that street. She was a big
woman and fully - capable of strangling
such a being as little May Smith. â :â .,; -
The police, consider the' most tangible
clew tbey have is one which reached them'
late last night and they have followed \it
up by arresting : Charles â¢_ Lemmerer, '.a'
young barber, who works for D.J. Simon
â i _wiÂ«_ _. m Â»,_â¢*, immtfiu .iiiiininÂ«irni^_ I -
at 757 .Howard street.. They now have him
in the City Prison tanks. 7 ' .
Captain Spillainey was notified that
Lemmerer at ; an .; early hour yesterday
morning went into the saloon 759 Howard
street, which is I next _ door to 'â  the barber
shop, and told them that he had choked a
woman on Morton street. She had stolen
a fifty-cent piece from him and . that was
why he choked 7 her. 7He met her in a
saloon and went into her den through the
back dooi of ; the saloon. The captain in
structed McGrayn to get Lemmerer.
When ai rested Lemmerer denied having
made the* statement, but there are three
witnesses who heard him. He told Mc-
Grayn he went to the house of Joseph
Stumpf, 415 O'Farrell street, at 3 o'clock
Sunday afternoon and played cards there
till 2 o'clock yesterday morning. Then he
wandered around till he got to the saloon
759 Howard street.
In the City . Prison he told 7 Sergeant
Shields that he came down O'Farrell street
with a friend to Stockton street, turned
down to a small street and went into a
saloon, where he met a little girl, all
Eainted and powdered up. / She said to
im : "Come with me and I will treat you
like a gentleman." He went out of the
rear door of the Baloon with her and into
her den. He gave her a dollar and she
stole a fifty-cent piece out of his pocket.
He charged' her with stealing it and she
called him a ; liar. He called her a liar
and he went away, saying he would see
her about it next week. He claimed it oc
curred about 3 o'clock in the morning.
. 7At 1 o'clock ; this morning Captain Lees
ascertained that Lemmerer's alibi is almost
incontrovertible.
CRIMES OF THE PAST.
Mysterious Cases, Having Similar
Features That Baffled the Police*
of Old.
"That looks like Henry Bays'; work,"
was the remark of a police official yester
' day morning, referring to the murder by
strangulation of Mamie McDermott .Alias
May Smith.
And that remark recalled one of three
mysterious murders committed in this
City in the past fourteen years. The vic
tims were all womenâ two of them of the
class to which Mamie .McDermott be
longed and the other an aged woman who
kept a lodging-house.
The remark quoted was as to the case of
the elderly woman and was prompted by
the fact, that as in the case of the most re
cent victim, she was strangled first and
then a towel tied around the neck.
This victim was Frederika Drell, ,65
years of age, who was murdered in her
home, in an old-fashioned cottage, on a
terrace on the west side of Dupont street,
just. north of California. She lived by her
self in this cottage and sustained herself
by renting a few rooms. Among her
lodgers was one Henry Bays, an indi
vidual who was under surveillance of
the police. On the morning of the 21st of
December, 1884, the old lady, who was in
the habit of sleeping fully dressed on a
couch, so that she would be prepared to go
to the door in case the bell rang, was dis
covered dead on her couch, with a twisted
towel tied around her neck. An examina
tion made when the towel was removed
revealed the fact that her death had been
caused by strangulation by the hand of a
human being, and that the tying of the
towel around her neck was an after
thought and act of the murderer.
A remarkable fact was that Henry Bays
was missing and that the towel around
the woman's neck was one of two that had
been in Bays' room. It was supposed that
the old lady, who was somewhat miserly,
had in her rooms a large sum of money
concealed and that robbery was the
motive for the crime. The police after a
search discovered Bays, who was making
his way out of the city, and placed him
under arrest. He was field , for trial, but
not convicted, as the evidence against him
was purely circumstantial, and the -jury
was not satisfied that it would justify the
returning of a verdict.- So this case was
one of many in which justice was not :
meted out to the criminal and. it was rele
gated to the long list of mysterious
murders.
Another murder by. strangulation > was
the killing of Caroline Prennell, at 115
Waverly. place. On the 25th of May, 1872,
the woman wa3 discovered dead, her body
partly on the floor and her lower limbs
resting on the side of a bed. Her body
was taken to the Morgue, and when a re
porter for The Call visited that institu
tion he was told that it was a case of apo
plexy. While examining the body the
reporter discovered several slight bruises
on the neck, and placing his right hand on
the throat discovered that his thumb nail
reached the bruise on the left side of the
neck and the fore and middle fingers
touched two bruises on the right side. He
then made . the announcement that the
woman had been strangled, but he was
laughed at. The autopsy subsequently
revealed a crushed trachea, and established
the correctness of the reporter's assertion.
This aroused.the police to j activity, and
an investigation . resulted in the arrest of
one Henri" Bee, the woman's protector. The
police wound a chain of circumstances so
tightly that there seemed to be no possible
hope of escape. This chain was to the
effect -that he and the woman had quar
reled during the day; that shortly before
the woman was discovered dead voices of
two persons talking in French* were beard,
and Bee was believed to have been the
owner of one 'of -the voices. The { fact of
his having quarreled s with the â ': woman,
and the further fact that he told a number
of contradictory stories as to his where
abouts on the night the woman 7 was
killed, were considered such Btrong points
against him that he was charged -. by the
Coroner's ' jury with murder," and," after a
preliminary trial, was held /to appear be
fore the .â¢ Superior. Court. ? : Reuben H.
Lloyd, who was his â¢ counsel, said : yester
day:: "That was my thirteenth and last
murder, case," and, while I felt sure that
Bee was innocent, for a time it | seemed to
me that while none of the twelve 1 de
fended before him had reached the gallows,
he would have to go there.'.' ;
At the time of this murder there lived
in this city a notorious criminal, Charles
Fiynn, known to the authorities all over
the ,-. State .as 7 Charles ' Mortimer, and a
woman named Carrie Spencer, who went
by his assumed 'name. 77 She was passion
ately fond of him, but was insanely jeal
ous, often getting into fights with Mor
timer , because of his - attention to other
women.. A few 7 days after the murder
Carrie was arrested and at that time wore
earrings that . had > been stolen from the
dead woman's ears. On her fingers were
the dead woman's rings. 7 She was placed
in the private part of the old City Prison,
known as the tanks, and occupied a cell
next to that in which Bee was imprisoned.
Each put their heads through the wicket
and conversed, and _ among other things
Bee told her that he was innocent and was
almost crazy, but felt sure that the mur
derer , would be ij discovered, y When she
h.ard this Carrie almost fainted and dis
continued '; the conversation. She was re
leased and shortly after Mortimer was ar
rested In i Sacramento , for the murder of
Mary Smith, a scarlet woman. . â¢ '<â  /->
When Carrie became sure that there was
no ; longer any hope for 7 Mortimer she in
some way dropped a hint which came to
the knowledge of Lloyd, who succeeded in
having the police recover the stolen jew
elry and sufficient proof to lead to a strong
suspicion that Mortimer was the man who
had strangled Caroline Prennel. 'Morti
mer in jan ante-mortem confession ,i said
that he had followed the woman to her
house under the impression that she had a
sum of money 7whicn' he could secure. 7He
said that while he was in there Carrie got
into a fight with the woman, and when she
fell from the bed put one of her feet on her
neck; that afterward she returned to the
house : and stole the jewelry. The post
mortem) did _ not, however, _ support this
statement, and , it was ', the ; general : belief
tbat Mortimer strangled the woman, and
being disappointed because he could not
find _ the money he expected % to :, secure,
stole her- rings ;' and gave them to Carrie,
who was passionately fond of jewelry. * "
"V Mortimer was ha aged in Sacramento. â¢ . â 
. . The , third ."case > was that -of â Ernestine
Carboniel, who was murderously assaulted
on the night of the 6thtof* June, 1884, at 3
Waverly placed near f. Sacramento street.
THE SAJS FRANCISCO CAIxL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1896.
The woman, who was 51 years old, occu
pied one-half of the building, it having two
entrances, each . exactly alike. The other
naif was occupied' by. one _ Louise Meyers.
On the night named a man was seen to
enter the Carboniel 'woman's ; house, and
inside of ten X minutes leave": it," go toward
Sacramento i street > and â :. turn ; down that
street. , A * few minutes - after that , : the
Meyers woman ; heard a groan in the ad
joining half of the house. Afraid to enter,
she summoned an officer, who found the
door of Carboniel's house closed, forced an
entrance and found the place lighted only
by a dim jet !of gas. â > Increasing the light
he saw on the floor body of Ernestine
Carboniel, : with an ugly wound on the
right side of her head.
The police were summoned as was a sur
geon, who found- a fracture of the skull.
Under her bed was found* a blood-stained
iron belaying pin of peculiar pattern with
which . the wound ,-:; had been given.
Once the woman became conscious for a
few moments and conversed about events
that occurred six hours before the assault,
but she could not tell anything about the
attack on her. She died on the 9th. The
Meyers woman was in the. habit of wear
ing diamonds worth at leastslooo, and it is
probable that the man entered Carboniel's
house under the impression that it was
Meyers with the intention Ã of stealing: the
diamonds, and that as soon as he got in
side he , dealt ; the woman the blow : that
caused her death ; that he then discovered
his mistake and fled, throwing the weapon
under the bed. The -police visited every
junkshop in the city and every ship in the
harbor, but never found where the belay
ing-pin came from and it is now one of the
"deodands" kept in memory of crimes that
are never unraveled. Â;.,'.- ,
AT THE PLAY-HOUSES
Lucia di Lammermoor Given to
â¢ an Enthusiastic Audi
ence.
Corinne at the Columbiaâ "My â¢ Part
ner" Morosco'sâ Things
Elsewhere.
Mme. Tavary quite captivated her au
dience last evening as Lucia di Lammer
moor, as did Mme. Dorre before i her as
Santuzza in " Cavalleria ;Rusticana.''
Three or four times during the evening
the ordinary forms of expressing approval
seemed ; not to satisfy, and . a strong dis
position was shown to break into cheers.
Again and again Mme. Tavary came for
ward and bowed and bowed in answer to
the storm. The Cavalleria was con
siderably strengthened In its presentation
by ' the Turridu .of Payne Clarke. Mme.
Dorre was the ideal Santuzza.
Madame Tavary was at her . best in ; the
second act and the latter part of the third
act of Lucia. Albert L. Guille as Edgar and
SignorAbrahamoff as Bide the Bent fairly
won the applause they received. To-night,
"Mignon."
"At the Tivoli.
The bill at the Tivoli remains tbe same
as it was last week. The music is not only
equal to soothing the breast of the gentle
savage-but: to . entertaining multitudes of
very civilized people.' There is no sign of
diminishing popularity, and the songs
ana dancing provoke the enthusiasm of
the frequenters of this theater.
Corinne at the.Columbia.
Corinne and the Opera Comique organi
zation transferred "Hendrick Hudson Jr."
to the Columbia last night, there to dazzle
the habitues of that theater for a week.
That Corinne has a strong hold upon" the
public was evidenced- by the; crowded
theater. Every feature of the extravaganza
and the specialty | bits, | that break it up
and give zest to it was met with applause.
Corinne's picture-songs and dances and
mandolin playing especially caught the
audience. Fostelle, the remarkable female
impersonator, introduced several new
songs, as did also the Nichols -sisters,
"Plantation Swells." Ben Grinnell, the
grotesque, also varied his specialty in sev
eral particulars. Altogether "Hendrick
Hudson Jr.," is likely to be no less suc
cessful! during the week at the Columbia
than it was at the California.
The Orpheum.
The Orpheum has four new numbers for
this weekâ Tina : Corri, the English
male impersonator; Jules and Ella Gatri
son, .travesty ..-artists; Pantzer brother.,
head-balancers and acrobats, and Walter
Stanton in several musical things, assisted
by Tina Corri. The sweet-toned creole
soprano, Rachel Walker, in her planta
tion melodies and "Ben Bolt,", and Billy
Carter, the funny ban joist, will continue
to amuse the crowded house.
"My Partner at Morosco's.
Morosco's Grand Opera-house was well
filled last night at the opening of Bartley
Campbell's play, "My Partner," with Fred
J. Butler as Joe Saunders, H. Coulter
Brinkeras Ned - Singleton, the "partner,"
and Charles W. Swain as .the funny
Chinaman, Wing -. Lee. The part of
Mary y'i Ãrandon was â¢," played by the
favorite . Maud 7 Edna Hall. It .; is
a California ; piece, with miners of a heroic
age found more in novels than in mines.
There is some resemblance in the charac
ters of Bret Harte's book people, and alto
gether the play is full of rush, revolvers
and '49 reminders. It evidently takes
with the Morosco patrons. .
'â  The White Slave."
, Bartley Campbell's play, "The White
Slave," was put on' at. Grover's Alcazar
last evening with Hereward Hoyte as Clay
Brittain and Miss Mina : Gleason as Lisa,
the White Slave. 7> The piece is full of the
homely 7 but stirring scenes of old planta
tion days - down South, .- and ' the : planta
tion ; negro melodies ' are : heard from
every cabin. The piece will run all the
week. As an entr'acte Miss Claire Gren
ville i and Miss ; Lulu ~ Jackson, two San
Francisco girls, made V, their [ first 7 appear
ance on the stage in a violin duet. It was
a clever bit of music, and won for the
young melodists a merited applause.

Happy.
H. Cranston Potter, a capitalist of Ta

banking men in this country and abroad,
THE LATE H. CRANSTON POTTER.
met with his death either in the waters of
the bay of - San Francisco or the Pacific
Ocean some time between Saturday and :
Sunday morning. Whether his death was
due ' to accident or was suicidal .is "a
mystery, though his friends scout
all idea 7. of self - destruction. .All
that is actually known is that he had been
dissipating heavily just previous' to the
time he was last seen. ; The supposition of
the authorities is that he either committed
suicide while in a despondent mood after
the effects of his debauch had worn off, or
he fell into the" water while intoxicated
and was drowned.' . : ~_/\~X\ -:.
â  : The â¢ body of a young man was found
Sunday afternoon among the sand
dunes, a .short . distance souih of the
Cliff House, by R. -. Williams, who : was
strolling on the beach. The body was well
dressed, its general appearance bespeaking
wealth and respectability. The Coroner
was notified and the remains were removed
to the Morgue, but after a thorough search
of his clothing nothing was found, with
the exception of a silver matchbox, on
which were inscribed ; the initials . "H. C.
P.," which would be of any service in es
tablishing his identity. :77 ,
Yesterday : Thomas - : Watson, a gram
broker of this City, who was a friend of
the deceasod, knowing that Potter had
not been seen by his friends for several
days, called at ; the Morgn c, fearing ; that
something serious had befallen the miss
ing man. y
His fears proved to be well founded, as
he immediately recognized tbe features of
the â¢ dead - man 'as those of his missing
friend. Watson, then informed the Cor
oner, of the man's identity and made ar
rangements for the removal of the remains
to an undertaking establishment, where it
is being embalmed preparatory to being
shipped to Tacoma. ,â¢:
An autopsy . was held on the i body by.
Dr. J. :8. Barrett prior *to 7 its removal to
the undertaking parlors, and it was found
that the cause of death was "asphyxiation
by submersion." which is the L medical
term for drowning.
The Coroner took charge of the effects
left at the Occidental Hotel by Mr. Potter,
which consist of a few expensive suits of
clothes and ; a : number i of; bicycle ': suits.
They will be shipped to Tacoma as soon as
the inquest is disposed of. ...
LAST SEEN ON FRIDAY.
Theory Advanced by a Friend That
His Death Was Due to Purely
Accidental Causes.
H. Cranston Potter arrived in this City
on the City of - Everett on the 3d inst., in
company with" Dr. A. G. hicks, one of ? the
best-known physicians fof Tacoma. .7 The
occasion for the trip is said to; have Â» been
to ; benefit the; health of: the .''deceased:
The two put up X at ; the Occidental â¢ Hotel,
and on; Sunday morning V Dr. Hicks- took
the regular : steamer for Tacoma, 5 leaving
word with the hotel people to ' see : that
Potter was properly taken care of when he
turned- up and for them to induce him ';' to
return home by the first steamer. 77 â¢ '
"; So far as can be , ascertained â¢ Potter .was
stiil in the world iof the living on Satur

.The last person who saw him alive, ac

of the firm .with which! deceased was con
nected. Mr. 7, Watson saw 7; him .7 alive at
noon on Friday, and then saw no more of
him till he sadly viewed his: corpse yester
day. 7 â¢ Speaking of \ the y probable cause Jof
his death, Mr. .Watson said he could not
i believe y it yi was f, other .â  than g accidental.
There : wits absolutely no cause, he said, so
far as he knew, for suicide, and there were
no indications of foul play. He added that
Potter had everything to : make life worth:
living. .' He 3 bad '? a .: large .. income and a
family of which he was exceedingly fond
and proud. His theory is that he acci
dentally 'i fell ' into 7 7 the water and was
drowned.* - - â  ' '- y^^a^j^^ggj^^Sfj^y 7
? y He said 7 ; that the action of Dr. Hicks
was not surprising, in view of the doctor
intimate knowledge of the eccentricities of
deceased, and that his . return' to Tacoma
was undoubtedly compelled by the exigen
cies of business. "^^fg^*t^^lf_SiJ^3BWl!E
XC Potter during his stay was always in the
happiest frame of mind, and was not in the
habit of ? indulging in despondency. "So
far l as \ financial matters i went," said 7 Mr.
Watson; "he could have drawn on me for
all the money he wanted, and I know he
was not at any time embarrassed on this
account." v '-.'-"'"' "<

him from .Tacoma 7 a tandem bicycle, but j
where he kept it had not been ascertained
up to a late hour last night. '. It is believed
that he intended to use it for a trip 7; along
the beach, and the thedry is advanced that
he met his death; while irecbnnoitering to

PERSONAL TRAITS.
Was Addicted to 7 Drink and Fre
quently Indulged in Sprees of an
Exceptional Character. -
y, A former resident of Tacoma, who -is
well informed on all that concerns its his
tory for some years past, was able to throw
considerable light on the personal history
of the deceased. His story was as follows:
H. Cranston Potter was the dissolute son of
a very good family.,. He : arrived in Tacoma
about seven years ago with some capital and a
good income, and invested his capital in the
stock of a large grain warehouse company. He
built a very handsome place. and married a
(laughter of C. J. Kershaw of Chicago, who in
1890 was caught in the great wheat crash and
failed for millions of dollars. Kershaw is now
in Tacoma: ,'; 7 > : 7
Potter dissipated ! a great deal and took the
Kecley cure about two years ago. Its good
effect continued for. a year, during which pe
riod he led. very decent life. Then he broke
away and he did some most outrageous things
and made a general fool of himself. He sue-
ceeded In getting away with a lot of
money and in thoroughly disgusting all his
friends. 4 .- . â¢?.
His income, at the request of his wife, has
been recently sent to her because of his inabil
ity to take care of it," and | she left him with
very little money indeed, so that he had to re
sort to borrowing from friends. -
He was a member of Troop B of the cavalry
branch of the Washington militia, and was
also a great bicyclist" and. yachtsman and a
camera fiend. <" i- r
He would go on sprees* and get absolutely
crazy. : But I don't think he had the slightest
tendency toward suicide. I know of one time
.when he went on one with the very Dr. Hicks
. who accompanied him to this City. Potter got
into a fight and was pretty badly done up. Ha
went to the doctor's house, locked himself in a
bathroom and remained there for two days
and nights. â¢- : > -. -- .
During their visit here Potter, I should judge,
got away from Dr. Hicks in some wav, and
Kicks, not being able to find him, had to aban
don him and go back to attend to his business
in Tacoma. He must have been drowned acci
dentally, for I don't believe any one would
attempt to rob him, as he was given his money
in driblets. -. /'. .. :â  _' 4 ;- . r \ . â  -'â¢ .
An instance of Potter's extreme reck
lessness - while under the influence, of
liquor was made manifest during a visit to
this City in 1890, at which time he led ;an
extremely dissipated life. X At that time ha
occupied -rooms '*" at â the Grand Hotel
and after [ a debauch which lasted
several days .he ' ; undertook to .take
possession of the barroom connected with
the hotel. After considerable difficulty be
waa ejected, but made his way across the
street into the, Palace Hotel and endeav
ed to chastise a: party who was standing
in; >; the > corridor against ; whom he
had', an :â¢ imaginary; grievance. ;; After
considerable trouble,- five men who had
hastened to the assistance of the assailed
party managed to ;: overcome 'Potter and
remove to 'his room, where he re
mained t for several ; days prior ; to* his de
parture for Tacoma. , â  ' â â¢ -

TACOMA, Wash.; Feb. 10.â The news of

CUT A WIDE SWATH.
Potter Is Said to Have Lost and
. Squandered Large Sums of
- Money on' the Sound.
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 10.â IT. Crans
ton Potter came to Seattle from New York
in the. spring of 1889 and ' with Charles S.
Painter, now of l Chicago, ,and E. . W. : S.
Tingle, now a consul to one of the cities of
Germany, purchased the Morning Journal.
He spent money freely; and soon attained
social and â¢ business prominence. y After
sinking about $5000 in the newspaper ven
ture Potter disposed of ; his ; interests here
and went to Tacoma, where in 1891 he was
manned to one of the society ' ladies lof
that city, and has \ since been "a resident
there. â ' .'X
At Tacoma he engaged in the cold stor
age 7 business, losing about $40,000 in two
years. He then purchased stock -in the
West Coast Grain Company of Tacoma,
I and it is \ said | still â¢ retains an interest in
that concern. As a side issue Potter spec
ulated in real estate and mining and was
one of the boomers of the . Everett town
site. He is said, to be interested â  more or
less extensively in mines in Okanogan
County, this State.
7 Soon after his ; arrival here . Potter, by
virtue of the social prominence of his
Eastern relatives, got in with the Seattle
smart set. He - was sadly wanting in
business sense and training, and conse
quently was fleeced right and left by the
shrewd speculators then infesting the City.
His infatuation for women and bis love of
liquor led him to many excesses. His
sprees frequently lasted for days and were
repeated -with considerable regularity.
Since coming West several years ago, Pot
ter has had an income of $1500 per month,
and this' fact, Â» which became ,~ generally
known/earned for him : many friends of
the class of "Hail fellows well met." He '
was a convivial fellow and -he aimed .to
make life one continual round of pleasure.
Since last September Potter had been
negotiating for the purchase of a presum- 1
ably rich mine in Okanogan County,
owned by J. C. Gormley of this city. Many
telegrams passed and he made a number
of trips to Seattle, but the deal was never
closed. Gormley expressed the greatest
surprise and sorrow to-night when in
formed of Potter's death by The Call cor
respondent. It was Potter's intention to
have enlisted in the purchase the financial
aid of some of his Eastern relatives,
though he did not much like the idea of
calling for their further assistance.
He was sent West by his father, it was
claimed, to separate him from undesirable
associates and ties. Cran_ton, however,
lost no time in finding kindred compan
ions. It was an easy task in the former
days of the Sound cities,' and he soon re
sumed his former gait. In his business
dealings here he was straightforward and
honorable.' He built up an extensive ac
quaintance throughout the. State and had
many wartn personal friends in this city,
where' he still retains some business in
terests. ": '\./.X : '' : ,X~ : : â /'/â / XX- - ; â â â¢â .

The Shortest and Surest Way by "Which
It Can Be Done.
"There are a thousand ways of fighting a
cold, but only one way to effect a cure."
It â  was an experienced medical man - who
ottered this sage remark not long ago.
"Do you know," he continued, "that there
is one way to cure colds and prevent colds tbat
can always be relied upon? ;It is a safe and
reliable remedy, but I always hesitate to rec
ommend it because it is liable to lead to serious
mistakes. 7 1 will tell you in confidence, how
ever, that there ;is no thing, better; or safer to
take in winter time than pure malt , whiskey.
The only trouble is that it must be absolutely
pure. The ordinary whiskey you get in saloons
or barrooms will not do. That is where most
people get a wrong idea. They think that
whiskey is whiskey, and that it is all the same.
They forget that there is hardly a whiskey free
from adulteration. To do any good, whiskey
must be thoroughly Dure, and it is only such a
whiskey that I would recommend."
The opinion above given ' is interesting, but
it Is not new. Every experienced -physician
knows that pure malt whiskey is nature's great
remedy, for stimulating the vital forces and
building up the health. .But such a whiskey is
not to be found everywhere. '.. There is, in fact,
only ono that has been proved to be medicinally
pure and free from adulteration. This whiskey
is Duffy's pure malt, which is universally recog
nized as a wonderful health-giver and restora
tive. Nothing has ever compared with It for
toning up the digestive organs, creating a
healthy appetite, stirring up the blood and
giving renewed vigor to every part of the body.
it will not only keep off colds, grip and pneu
monia, but it will cure them. Every person
who takes it can go through the severest winter
without any fear of chills or pneumonia.

NEW YORK. MARKETS.

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 10.â The week opened
with renew d activity and strength in the markets
â¢ for securities. The transactions aggregated 421,000.
shares the largest total for some time past.
While the bulk of the business was in sugar, to
bacco and St. Paul, which were decidedly more
active than of late, the offerings .were.- well dis
tributed. The tendency of the market in the
main was toward higher prices. At intervals a
few' of the leading speculative., reacted sharply j
under realizations, but the declines invariably ;
brontht In Iresh buying orders and rallies quickly |
! ens I'd. The bull speculation received its first lm- i
pe:us his morning from London, wnere securities
were above the party of fours closingon Saturday.
i lie foreigners brought fully 20,000 shares in
this market. The reduction of half a cent in the
posted rates for sterling exchange and continued
deposits of gold in the sub-treasury on account of
payment for the new Government loan stimulated
the new upward movement in prices. Sugar in the
early trading rose 2 to 1 1 5 Vs. but later declined to

amendment to the tariff bill to take off the Vs dif
ferential on refined sugar.
As the tariff bill witn the free-siiver rider is -not
expected tb pass, those who sold sugar down to
the figure named were covering at the close, and a
rally to 113% occured. Tobbacco was the most
erratic stock of the day. It fell s/ 8 to 7534 ;-. rose to
76%. declined to 75V_, jumped io79V_: receded
to 7 V i* 2 , and finally sold as high as 80V4, closing at
748/4- There were heavy purchases to cover shorts,
One firm alone being credited wit buying orders
to the extent of over 20.000 shares. The advance
' in the general list was equal to V. to lVa cent,
the Grangers leading. ' -:â¢â¢-. â â -...*
Among the specialties, Manhattan moved up
4 1 _to 113 on a reiteration of the rumors recently
current that the Metropolitan Traction people had
made an offer to lease the road on a guarantee of 8

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 1 1.1.., Feb. 10.â Large Black Sea ship
ments of wheat for last week 2,956,000 bushels,
and lower Liverpool cables gave that grain an in
clination downward on the curb at the opening i
this morning. There was a scurry at the openlnz, j
but when first orders were executed the . trade .be- 1
came more" subdued and a heavy feeling prevailed. j
Receipts at Chicago were 148 cars. The North
west had 655 cars against 644 last Monday and j
216 a year ago. Local inspections from store* were
113,681 bushels. The visible supply decrease of i
only 615,000 bushels conveyed disappointment to I
the minds of holders and more long stun' came out '
when it was announced. This was the case when
the estimated receipts for to-morrow, 360 cars, was
learned of.,
The amount on ocean passage increased 880.000
bushels and the English visible supply decreased
194.000 bushels. Tiie Daily Trade Bulletin gave
the stocks in the United States and Canada as hav
ing decreased 6,965,000 bushels during January. j
Atlantic seaboard clearances were 672.132 bush
els. Closing - Continental cables were : irresrular.
The "shorts" covered their early sales late in the
session, causing a partial recovery to prices.. May
wheat opened from 66% cto 663/ c, sold between
b'j.^rt'o 3 and 655/ B e, closing at eiS^c, 3 / i@T' 8 c
under Saturday. *.....
CORNâ Was not active and was sympathetic
with wheat in its movements. The receipts were
39* cars, 47 less than estimated. Withdrawals
from store were 227.681 bushels. The statistical
news on corn was in many instances quite favor
able. The visible supply , increased only moder- I
ately (198,000 bushels), the export clearances were
unusually heavy at 760.000 bushels, and the in- !
terior movement as reported rather slo.v. The J
amount of corn on ocean passage increased 480,000 j
bushels. May corn opened at 303/ B e. sold between ;
303/ B @Boy 2 c and . 30% c, closing at 30a/ B e, a shade i
under Saturday. Estimated receipts ior to-mor- 1
row 300 cars. ' .......
OATSâ A quiet: market was seen In oats. The
business was made up of small transactions for j
local account, and | prices declined or advanced as '
the wheat or corn markets moved. Receipts were 1
172 cars. There were no withdrawals from store. |
The visible supply increased 97.000 bushels. May
oais closed y 8 under Saturday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 260 cars.
' FLAXâ Was easy. Cash. 90%@91c: May, Â»4@ I

PROVISIONSâ A heavy run .of hogs caused j
weakness at the yards and, in the natural order of |
things, provisions followed tho same course. After I
the start a few buying orders . came on the market
and served to rally prices, but thai, temporary sup- ;
port soon disappeared and the close was easy, with
May pork 5@7y 2 c lower and May lard and ribs ;

Was Absent.
GENERAL NEWS OF OAKLAND.
Supervisors Give the Electors Twen
ty-two Additional Voting, Pre- ,
jcincts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 10. f
The preliminary examination of Abe
Majors and Burt Willmore, the boy burg
lars, attracted a great throng to the Police
Court this . afternoon. The lobby was
crowded and officers had to be stationed at
the doors of the courtroom to keep the
crowd back. When' Sergeant Hodgkins
entered with the two lads there was a
straining of necks to catch sight of the
prisoners. Two officers followed, bringine:
in the kit of tools and recovered plunder.
Mrs. Majors came in shortly after and
kissed her son. She sat at the boy's side
throughout the proceedings. The boys
seemed not to be impressed by their situa
tion. Mrs. Willmore was not present.
F. R. Girard was the first witness.. He
testified to leaving his place locked on the
night of the burglary. He said he thought
there was a little over $100 in the safe be
sides jewelry. He identified the jewelry
recovered from Willmore's house as being
some that had been left iD the safe. .
On cross-examination he denied ever
keeping dynamite in the store. He said
there were two keys; he carried one and
the drayman the other.. His wife knew ]
the combination of the safe; she took $80 j
from the safe about Christmas time; it was
theirs in common : two $20 gold pieces had
been found after the burglary. He denied
having told reporters that he had $400 in
the safe when it was blown open; that he
told them he lost about $400 in money and
jewelry; denied having said he lost" $2000
in money, jewelry and damage to his
stock.
Prosecuting Attorney Melvin said that
as Mr. Girard had testified that the store
was the property of a company the case
would have to be dismissed and a new
complaint made out. This was none, and
the case went over until 2 o'clock to
morrow.
The complaint charging the boys with
the burglary of Miller & Butler's office, at
the foot of "Webster street, was next taken
up. R. S. Miller testified to the condition
of the office the night before and the morn
ing after the burglary. Officer Doolan tes
tified to the boys' arrest and discovery of
their weapons" and kit, as well as to'the
statement that one of them made, saying
had not the officers had them covered
Bonn one would have "got it." Officers
Kyte and Powers corroborated him. and
then the court held them for trial in $3000
bonds each for this one job.
VOTING PRECINCTS.
Supervisors Increase Them From 99 to
121.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 10. â The Board
of Supervisors this afternoon rearranged
the voting precincts of the county and
inceased the number by twenty-two. . The
report of the special committee appointed
for that purpose was a type-written docu
ment of sixty -one pages, and occupied the
clerk an hour and a half in reading it..
The additional precincts ace located as
follows: Brooklyn Township 2, Eden 1,
Oakland 2, Murray 1, Washington 1; Oak
land City First Ward 1, Second 2, Seventh
2; Alameda 4, Berkeley 6.
A resolution was adopted changing the

as to agree with the boundary lines of
wards in Berkeley, as formed by the re
cently adopted charter.

WII.MEEDIXG SCHOOL.
Oaklanders Confident the Regents "Will
Accept Their Subscription.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 10.â The citizens
of Oakland feel confident to-night that the
Regents of the University of California
will accept the $15,000 subscribed for the
purpose of purchasing a ite for the Wil
merding Industrial School and locate it in
this city. They feel that the fact that the
money is to be used in securing the site
which the regents favor is better than a
site. . â¢â¢â 
Senator Perkins, in a letter to ex-Mayor
Davis regarding the school, says he had
many conversations with Mr. Wilmerding
during the latter's life, and among other
things that gentleman said was:
"I am deeply in sympathy with the ob
ject of this scheme. If my business enter
prises had turned out better I would have
been .in a position to have built a school
for manual training and endowed it. and
it would have been located in Oakland.
However, I will cheerfully subscribe. I
think that the plan of popular subscrip
tions rather than asking a few to give all
the money is a wise one, for every one
will see the value of the enterprise."
Partners Three Times.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 10.â Gibson &
Whitmore, the attorneys, have dissolved
partnership by mutual consent, and here
after the members will handle -business in
dividually. This is tho third partnership
which has been broken between these two
gentlemen, who are great personal friends,
since they were first associated in 1873. 7
They were partners from the year
1873 to 1883. ' Later they again formed a
partnership and worked together for sev
eral years only to separate again. Two
years ago they formed the present rela
tions. Both agree that it is a mutual
separation on business grounds. They
have not as yet decided as to how their
present business, shall be separated or as
to opening separate offices.
White Does Not Worry.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 10.â The suit j of
Ernest H. Frost against Sheriff C. B. White
for $10,000 damages is giving that official
very little worry. Frost .claims he was
illegally arrested' by Deputy Sheriff Adam
Kellner last December while on the over
land.train bound for Portland. Jailer Lane
refused to lock Frost up when he was
brought to the \ jail. The suit will be de
fended by the Southern Pacific Company,
as Kellner is one of its employes. He is
a Deputy Sheriff by courtesy of the Sheriff's
office, which has always recognized the
request of the company, in that regard. .

OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 10.â Fred W.
Lake and his brother, W." B.Lake, filed a

which he cleaned; up' ssooo, but : never re
paid them. The statement ; shows ; they
paid him money in sums 7 ranging from 35
cents to $50. running from May 15, 1893, to

WITH FLOATS AND MUSIC
Elaborate Preparations Are Com
pleted for Washington's
Day Parade.
There Will Also Be a Regatta on Lake
Merritt During the After
noon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 10. f
That the Washington's Birthday Cele
bration in Oakland will be a grand success
is now assured. Along the line of march,
as already published, decorations will be
quite extensive. The committee in charge
has arranged to have, four streamers of
flags stretched from the housetops on each
block, and other decorations will be appro
priately displayed.
Four, bands and one drum corps have
been engaged, and it is probable two more
will be in the parade. The bands are the
Second Artillery, Fifth Regiment, Oak
land Professional and Oakland Amateur
bands, the latter being composed of mem
bers of the Boys' Brigade.
It ie estimated that fully fifty floats will
be in line. They will depict various scenes
from the life and career of Washington.
Some of those already in the course of con
struction are: "Washington Crossing the
Delaware"; " "Washington .at Valley
Forge" ; "Washington Signing the Dec
laration of Independence"; "Cornwallis
Surrendering to Washington"; "Wash
ington Cutting the Cherry Tree"; "God
dess of Liberty and the States of the
Union."
An elaborate souvenir programme will
be distributed to all attending the exer
cises. It will be in book-form of twenty
pages and on the front cover a large por
trait of Washington will be printed. In
side reading matter and descriptive cuts
illustrative of the life of the Nation's
patriot will precede pages devoted to the
three different programmes of the day,
while on the last page the words of the
National hymn will be engrossed.
One of the special features of the parade
will be the mounted cavalcade of ladies in
costume. Miss Abbie Taggart will lead
the division, and from the number of re
cruits coming in it is sure to be an at
tractive feature.
The exercises in the afternoon will take
place at 2 o'clock on Lake . Merritt, and
will consist of a musical and literary pro
gramme, as well as a regatta. 7 The exer
cises will conclude with a series of boat
races and skill contests.
In the evening the First Congregational
Church will be the scene of the final dem
onstration of the day. There a varied
musical and literary programme will be ren
dered. A chorus of 300 voices is in train
ing for the occasion under the leadership
of D. P. Hughes, and the volume of music
will be swelled by the Congregational or
chestra of sixty pieces.
The finance committee has been actively
canvassing among merchants for subscrip
tions, and it is expected to raise the neces
sary $1500 in a few days.

C H. Boman, convicted in the Police
Court by a jury of ! having battered Mrs.
Montgomery, a nurse, when she went to
his house to collect her bill, has a novel
plea on which he is basing his motion for
a new trial. The case has been stubbornly
contested by both sides from the very start.
When the . case was .. called for the passage
of sentence the attorney for the defense
made a motion for a new trial, and in sup
port of the motion presented the following
affidavit: ;
Henry E. Winslow, Charles L. Wines and F.
Sicotti. being duly sworn, each for himself de
poses and says: That he was one of the jurors
before whom the above-named cause was tried
In the Police i Court of the city of Oakland ;

and the instructions given by. the court and
upon retiring to the jury-room he was of the

bavins been cast. The entire student
body participated in the election, and in
consequence there was a continual string
of college men and co-eds waiting for their
turn to ballot from the time the polls
opened at 10 o'clock in the morning until
they closed at 4 in the afternoon. The
polling system proved an admirable im
provement over the old method of assem
bly : voting. What added animus to the
election besides the importance of the of
fice, it being the highest college honor, is
the fact that the two candidates were rep
resentatives of rival fraternities.
Reinhardt is a prominent member of the
Phi Delta Theta and Taylor of the Beta
Theta Pi. - Each organization has a strong
following, and each used every effort to
put their man at the head of football
affairs for the coming season.
Reinhardt is a native of Kansas, and is
in his twenty-sixth year. Both he and his
rival are members of the junior class. Rein
hardt has had considerable business experit
ence, having been associated in a mercan
tile pursuit with his father prior to his en
trance to college. In 1893 he graduated
from Chaffey College ; in Southern Califor
nia, and during his course there served
both as baseball and football manager. in
his freshman year at Berkeley he played
center on his class eleven against Hunt,
the now famous guard.
It was during his freshman contests that
he was incapacitated for work on the grid
iron until last season, through an iniurv to
a knee. Last season he joined the Varsity
eleven, after a two years rest, and played
left euard in; the intercollegiate match.
For the past half-year he has been assist
ant ,to Mr. Magee in the department of
physical culture at the â  university. It is
generally conceded that his close associa
tion^ with the department and his knowl
edge of athletics will be of material as
sistance to him in his < conferences with
Captain Ran some as to the best prelimi
nary training methods to pursue.

proposal is a result of the project of her
husband ; shortly before his death. The
professor had arranged to give a lecture on
descriptive and characteristic music last
October, but within a few hours from the
time set for the .discourse he was stricken
with a fatal illness. The lecture was to
have been for the benefit of the students',

raised through the advance sale of seats,
the tickets sold being uncalled for on Mrs.
Rosewald's announcement that the money
would be applied as though the lecture
had taken place. V"
. For the purpose of adding to this amount
and founding the proposed Rosewald me

SIX MONTHS ON A DOLLAR
Mayor Davie Issues a Public
Defense of His Tax
'XXX- ' Levy.
WILL BE A SMALL SURPLUS.
Incidentally a ' Few Criticisms i Appear
Regarding Some of the Municipal
Departments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
: 908 Broadway. Feb. 10. . .
Mayor Davie â¢ issued ''. a â¢ defense of his
dollar tax ) to-day that cannot but be con
vincing, if the figures are correct. As they
are certified to by the city expert, is pre
sumed that they are correct. The report
is not lengthy, but shows at a glance that
the revenue provided by the Mayor is
ample if suitable economy be practiced.
; The Mayor says: <y;j -- '.' :.;-v y/X+
Your attention Is respectfully called to the
inclosed statement showing the expenditures
of the city government of the City of Oakland
for the first six months of the fiscal years
1895-96. 7
The statement gives the amounts allowed to
the various departments of the city govern
ment, the amounts expended for the period of
six months commencing July 1, 1895, and
ending December 31, 1895, and also tne bal
ance that may be used for the several depart
ments for the remainder of the fiscal year. -
The first three months of the fiscal year had
passed before the tax levy was fixed and the
several departments proceeded with their re
spective policies thinking that the tax levy for
this year would De $1 â¢ 18, and therefore the
expenditure of the first three months were
made on such lines and exceeded the proper
and necessary expenses of said departments.
This one matter was constantly held up as a
conclusion that the tax rate could not be fixed
at $1 as about one-fourth of the year had ex
pired, yet taking into consideration . that in
the first three mouths of the fiscal year the va
rious departments continued to create ex
penses on the same extravagant basis as in
previous years, the statement herein referred
to makes a good showing for the first half of
the year.
Since 1882, when the assessed value of Oak
land property was $29,000,000, down to 1894,
when the assessment rolls footed up $45,000,
--000, the tax rate of the city has increased from
99 cents in 1882 to $1 12 in 1894. It would
have been $1 18 this year had not the Mayor's
veto,' with the assistance of four members of
the Councilâ Messrs. Brosnaban, Basse tt, He it
mann and WatKinson â
The city should be run the same as a man's
private business; the funds should be carefully
expended and the greatest value procured for
the money.
The surplus in the Fire, Police and Fire Alarm
departments will be use for the street fund, as
the Street Department has been I Improperly
conducted . and . the funds injudiclally ex
pended. â¢
The Council reduced the street-light fund in
the tax levy and increased the school fund. It
had no right to do this as it had already en
tered into a contract for the year for a certain
number of electric lights and according to law
cannot break snch contract, but must provide
funds to meet the same. The school fund did !
not require the extra amount, as the State and
County apportionment with its increase this
year will be more than sufficient, with the j
amount originally allowed, to meet all reason- 1
able expenses. _. .' . '
The library fund will be short on account of
the extravagant policy of the Library Trustees.
There has been much talk about the dollar tax
rate compelling the Library Trustees to close
the reading-rooms, but a glance at the state
ment of expenses, etc., will prove to the con
trary, as in the dollar tax levy sufficient funds
were allowed to run all the reading-rooms for
the entire year.
The library and central reading-room will
run short for the year on account of the lack of
economical management. In the library there
is employed a librarian at $160 per month.
Four years .ago tho same services cost the city
$100 per month. There are also four additional
persons employed.
The High School fund will be sufficient for
the year.
It has been said that owing to the dollar rate
the Twelfth-street dam and Eighth-street
bridge cannot be repaired. This is not true,
inasmuch as in the tax levy sufficient has
been allowed to make tho repairs. The Eighth
street bridge can be repaired for $9000, and,
as the Contra Costa Water Company and the
East Oakland Electric Railroad Company oc
cupy portions of the bridge, they will be re
quired to pay part of the expense of repairing.
The various engine-houses are out of repair,
it has been stated, yet such conditions existed
for the past few years, and with I the large tax
levy of prior administrations â  these matters
were not attended to. : This year many of the
buildings have received attention.
Taken as a whole the dollar tax rate will be
sufficient to run the City this year.

. Councilman Bassett had the laugh on the
City Council ; to-nisht. â¢â  A 7 week. ago' an
anonymous resolution was introduced re
ferring to the fact that Mr. Bassett was
about to '; depart : for Washington to fight
the refunding bill. 1 It recited that a report
had been circulated stating that the Coun
cil would '7 refuse him a leave of absence,
and the resolution concluded by wishing
that the Councilman would be absent four
teen months, by which time his term of
office 7 will expire. fX The 7 resolution was
couched in sarcastic language/ and on mo
tion it was referred to Councilman Bassett
as a committee of one, with instructions to
report at to-night's meeting. Mr. Bassett
reported/and now the joke is on "the other
fellow," who is still unknown. y
:â¢' After referring to ; the facts 7 the report
continues: "We wish to call the attention
of the Council to the old adage that an
anonymous letter-writer is always a liar,
generally a coward; but never a gentleman,
and , further :to say, that whoever g intro
duced the resolution- is lacking in all the
elements of; common decency and dignity,
both as a man and ;as an official. " .
. 'The committee further y stated that it
found that Mr. Bassett has never voted to
pay any illegal claims; has â  always been
found 7on y the side ;of â¢ the 7 people; y has
never ,voted to close streets after the Mayor
has once opened them to the water front,
and although he has nearly always been of
opinions I widely â ; divergent . from ' the I ma
jority of the members, his opinions have al
ways been free from suggestions of corrupt
influence.? The Â» committee also refers 7to
the fact that the Southern Pacific has fre
quently j boasted that iit t can always count
on six votes in the City Council and ; ; that
the ; present 7 circumstances '?â ' justify their
boast. -.-", . -- \
XX As Mr. Bassett is Â» going to Washington
to oppose the refunding 7 bill, in which
action he represents the opinion of 99 per
cent of the intelligent people of California/
the 1 report continued, and as it is because
of this that he is ! ridiculed' by the Council; ,
the 7; committee ;? thinks that 7; no y further
proof is needed that the railroad influence
must be very, powerful at the City Hall. y^
â¢>'.; The report concludes: "We recommend
that the orphan resolution be spread in
full upon the minutes of ; this hoard to
gether '.with/this . report. J. M. Basset..,

JAMES MAKES A SPEECH.
Frederick Warde's Late Partner
Was Very Much Dis
appointed.
Great Speculation as to the Success
That Will Be Accorded His
Rival.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.l
908 Broadway, Feb. 10. j
Louis James made . a little speech be
tween the second and third acts of Othello
at the Macdonough Theater on Saturday
night. It consisted of but a couple of sen
tences. . He thanked the audience for
their very hearty encores and expressed
his disappointment that the audience was
so small. His remarks were justified, for
there ; were probably not more than 100
people â¢in the orchestra and dress circle
and the - balcony was proportionately
empty. As for the gallery, Othello does
not appeal to the gods.
The small houses that characterized the
engagement were a surprise to everybody
who had witnessed the grand successes
scored in this city by Mr. James when
: starring with Frederick Warde. His com
; bination has played two engagements of
one week each in this city, and at every
performance there was a demand for
stools. The Warde-James engagements
are historic events in the annals of ' the
drama in Oakland, and opinion has been
divided as to which of the two men was
the most popular and the greater actor.
For this reason the coming of the two men
with separate companies was looked .for
ward to with much interest. James has
come, made his little speech and has gone
away disappointed. In conversation Air.
James' manager stated that it was very
clear that Oakland did not want Louis
James and that he might not return.
In a couple of weeks Frederick Warde
will be here to try the experiment, and it
is safe to say that the Macdonough will be
crowded. Warde is the dramatic idol of
Oakland. He laid the foundation stone of
the Macdonough Theater; he is a member
of the Elks and he has lectured before the
High School pupils. He is given the free
dom of the city every time he comes, but
as he has' always been accompanied by
Louis James it has been a matter of specu
lation how much of the drawing power was
possessed by each.:, There are many who
think both are features by themselves
and that their success depended on their
combination. This can only be decided
after Warde has been here. Heretofore
the Elks have taken the matter in hand
and have insured success, but Louis James
did not receive any recognition from them,
and whether they will continue their ex
pression of y appreciation toward their
brother Elk, Frederick Warde, has not
been determined. ; ; -
: There were 60 very few people that heard
Louis James make his little speech of dis
appointment that the fact of bis having
done so is practically a secret. During the
first three nights of the week "In Old Ken
tucky" was played to packed houses, and
this may have interfered with James'
weeK-end engagement, but this is the first
time that Louis James has played to a
single empty seat in the city. On this oc
casion the empty seats were as three to
one.

ZANTE CURRANTS.
Authorities Conflict as to Whether They
Are on the Free List or Duitable.
California raisin men have a stanch
friend in Assistant United States Attorney
Knight. In the Zante currant case yester
day in the United States Circuit Court he
made a strong argument against the ad
mission of the currants free of duty. X He ;
cited the testimony of A. B. Butter to the
effect that California raisin-growers would
suffer serious damage in case import duties
were not charged on the currant, which
he claimed came for the most part from
Greece and not from the island of Zante.
"All grape currants are raisins," he said,
"and dried grapes within the meaning of
the Wilson act. Congress surely intended
to place an import duty on all Grecian
currants and not on the exclusive product
of Zante. Within ten years Zante has
sent us only a few pounds while the main
land of Greece has* produced 160.000 tons
of a similar fruit. The text of the tariff
| bill shows that ail fruit of this kind was
known as Zante currants, and intended to
be subject to duty. Clearly when Zante
currants were specifically mentioned in
the act, Zante currants of commerce was
meant, as it comes into direct competition
with the product of California."
Attorney Van Duzer, representing the
defense, took the opposite view, which he
sustained in a long argument. It is ex
pected that a decision will be. reached be
fore the end of the month. 7* v " V '
EVIDENTLY NOT WANTED
The Electric Railroad Express
Will Shortly Quit the
Business.
The People Have Not Met the Ven
ture in the Manner It Was
Hoped They Would.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
. 7Â«y'y(y; 908 Broadway. Feb. 10. f
Some surprise has been caused in com
mercial circles by the report that the Hay
wards' electric road would soon go out of
the express business. For over a year the
company has been doing about all the
business , letween ' Haywards, San Lean
dro, Oakland and San Francisco. They
commenced by buying out all the smaller
companies and by inaugurating a regular
electric i express service. The loaded
wagons were placed on electric-cars, and
during the quiet portions of the day they
were attached to the regular passenger
cars and hauled along the road. '
The first opposition that the express
service met .with was from the Railroad
Commissioners, who claimed that as the
road was doing a railroad freight business
it came under the same tariff regulations
as other railroads. The matter has not
yet been satisfactorily settled,; but the
commission did not dictate rates. For a
time the electric express was very popular,
but it was a costly service, and there was
not such a volume of business as was ex
pected, y vy-
Andrew L. Stone, secretary of the road,
was asked about tbe matter to-night and
readily gave an explanation.
"We went into the express service," he
said, "as a part of our plan to build up the
territory along the road. We bought out
several expressmen, and they were glad to
sell, because we employed as many of the
expressmen as we needed in our new
service. We thought that a first-class
express service would be a boon, and would
be welcomed by everybody along the route.
We reduced rates about one-half of what
was being charged, and intended to do all
that we could to make it a benefit to every
body. We knew that by building up the
territory we were benefiting ourselves, but
we were, at she same . time, benefiting a
thousand- others, so that our effort was
certainly not a selfish one. ,
"We have met with much opposition in
everything that we have undertaken, but
I cannot see that it has any justification.
We have never refrained from giving rights
of way across our property, we have never
tried to get out of our share of road work,
and have, I think, acted squarely. We
undertook this ': express business because
we I thought . it would be . acceptable. We
find that it has not been, and that there
is not a sufficient volume of business to
justify us in continuing. It is not a large
venture, and for its sake alone we would
not have been justified in taking it up,
but it is all part of a plan for developing
territory and improving it by bringing it
nearer to Oakland and San \ Francisco.
The opposition to the road is not easy to
explain. Before it -was built my family
offered a bonus of $10,000 to parties who
'proposed to build it. They did not see
anything profitable; in it, and at last , we
decided to take the initiative ourselves.
When first built everything was com- .
Amendable, but latterly we have met with
discouragement on every hand.
Â» '.'lt is very evident that the people along
the road r do not look : upon our express
business in the same light in which we
undertook it, and therefore it is not ad
visable for us to carry it on."

PADEREWSKI IN THE HALO OF HIS HAIR
The Great Pianist Struck a
Responsive Chord in the
Western Heart.
AS WITH TOUCH DIVINE.
Symphony Lovers Were Enrap
tured and the Unmusical*
Felt the Spell.
THRONGED WAS THE THEATER
San Francisco's Cultured People Gave
a Splendid Welcome to the
Famous Artist.
Society and the arts went to the Califor
nia Theater last night to honor the great
Paderewski. By "the arts'' is understood
the professors thereof, particularly the
musicians, who were present in great force,
painting and sculpture being also repre
sented.
For the most part society sat down
stairs and in the balcony, the arts taking
seats aloft. This rule had many excep
tions, however, for society people did not
scorn commodious seats in the gallery to
hear Paderewski, and a number of the
artistic people put on dress suits and sat
downstairs.
The Polish pianist was honored above
most artists who visit these shores, for
the whole house went early to hear him.
At 8 o'clock the California Theater was
literally besieged by a fashionable
mob. It was necessary to get into
line, even when one had tickets,
but the beauty of people all coming
promptly at 8 o'clock began to be apparent
a little later, for by 20 minutes past 8 or
thereabouts everything was in readiness
for Padereweski's appearance.
Society had dressed a good deal to honor
the Paderewski first night. Indeed the
general appearance of the theater was
more that of an opera-house, for a large
proportion of the men wore dress suits
and a number of prominent society women
were arrayed in full evening dress.
HYPNOTISM OF MELODY.
The Strange Power That the Pianist
Displayed in Controlling All
His Hearers.
The great audience was seated, and there
was a hush of expectation in the house
when the pianist appeared at the right
door of the stage and bowed two or three
times in a stiff, military way. The foot
lights were shrouded in darkness, but the
light from the auditorium showed the
great Paderewski to be tall, slender, with
an upright bearing. His somewhat worn,
emaciated-looking face was seen to be sur
mounted by the frizzy halo of light-brown
hair, which is one of the distinctive char
acteristics of his familiar pictures.
Paderewski sat down at the piano and
the audience hung breathless on his ac
tions. He lifted his strong, slender hands
and struck four preliminary chords, then
he paused, as though he took a certain
grim satisfaction in dangling with the ex
pectancy of the people, who, from floor to
ceiling, were focusing him under their
eyes. From under his bushy mane he took
one sideway look at the people, which em
braced stalls and gallery, a look which
seemed tinged with a certain cynical
amusement, or it might have been the
hypnotic glance which was to bring un
musical as well as musical hearers to his
feet,
Paderewski began to play, and every
glass in the house was leveled at him or
his hands. People.who sat to the left of
the auditorium or in the center congratu
lated themselves because they could see
those marvelous hands. All pianoforte
players and students studied them as they
would a lesson; they watched every
movement of / the wrists and the fingers,
noted that Paderewski performed no cork
screw work either with his body or with
his hands, and that he was much more,
reposeful than many lesser pianists they
had seen.
People who sat in the right of the
theater, being denied the view of the
hands, watched Paderewski's face and
wished that there had been more light
that they could have followed its expres
sion better. Whether it were accident or
innate modesty it is impossible to say, but
the weight of the light brown mane that
shaded Paderewski's manly brow fell op
the side of the audience and acted as a
' semi-mask.
The composition in which Paderewski
had elected to introduce himself to a San
Francisco audience was Beethoven's C
major sonata. The allegro * con brio was
played in a way which made the critical
minority listen with joy, while the un
critical ones, not being yet hypnotized,
watched the pianist, and a few who were
stumbling in utter darkness of 'things
.musical decided that he looked like a
freak and wished the programme did not
look so long.
There was a pause at the end of a move
ment, when people applauded and a few
belated listeners were hustled into their
seats by the ushers. Paderewski paused,
with his hands in midair, and remained
'immobile in that position till a pin could
have been heard to drop in the theater,
then his hands fell gently and caressingly
on the chords of the adagio.
It was from the beginning of .those
NEW TO-DAY.

chords that Paderewski really began to
conquer and subdue his audience. Famili
arity was making, people who had never
heard him before realize the marvellous
singing quality of his tone. So much has
been said and written about that same
singing tone of Paderewski's notes that
it seems a work of supererogation to dis
cuss it again, but it has to be heard to
be believed, and last night as' the Beet
hoven sonata progressed even people who
did not know much about the pianoforte
began to realize , that under Paderewski's
touch the instrument had a new voice a
sweeter, clearer, more : expressive voice
than they had ever heard it speak with
before, and one that expressed more light
and shade and emotion. ,., X; 7- y-7 7 - â¢". V.
The pianoforte-players and students all
through the sonata last night, and during
the rest of the programme for that matter,
revelled in the : pianist's marvellous tech
nique, the way in which he made each and
every note he strucK sing, through the
passages of most difficult execution, and,
as every musician knows, there was some
giant's work in the sonata for him to give
them a taste of his y quality.- Pader-'
ewski's wonderful command of the pedals
was another matter for admiration on the
part of those who took him as a study." .
The majority of his listeners,* however,
reveled in the perfect case of his playing,
the art which concealed art, and left them
free to enter into the joy of his music
without having to stop to think how he
produced his effects.
How Paderewski played that lovely air
from "Rosamund," which Schubert uses
as the theme of his B flat major, "Im
promptu"! So simply, so touchingly he
produced the simple melody that it spoke
with more meaning than any human voice
could throw into its tones.
As the "Impromptu" progresses the
them, takes on a few embroideries. Pader
ewski threw them off as easily as one
would shake dewdrops from s a flower, and
the lovers of Chopin absolutely hugged
themselves in anticipation of the joy
which the melancholy Pole's works would
give them performed by such hands, . for
there weie four Chopin numbers on the
programme. .. :"-'- ; .
Through all the intricacies of the "Im
promptu" Paderewski made that lovely
"Rosamunder" air sing with a voice of al
most unearthly sweetness, and at the end
there was an ovation for the pianist, who
responded by repeated bows, and finally
cut his admirers off short by bursting into j
the Mendelssohn "Midsummer
Night's Dream." The "Wedding March"
was Â«i revelation.
Not a man or woman there but had heard
it droned on church organs and pounded
into their reluctant ears on numerous
other occasions. .But in Paderewski's
hands the "Wedding March" became a
fairy-like thingâ something so graceful, so
exqisite, so fantastic, that one could
imagine elves and" brownies ] tripping to its
measures.
The "Wedding March" . finished . the
hypnotic process, for the rest of â¢ the even
ing Paderewski owned his audience. Even
the people who had thought 7he looked
like a freak atoned for the aspersion by
leading the applause. There was such an
unqualified demand for; an encore that
Paderewski, after giving a number of his
quick automatic bows, sat down to the
piano again and charmed his hearers with
tbe Paganini-Schumann "Caprice."
There was an interlude after this, dur
ing which people's tongues were loosened.
The Polish performer was discussed in all
his bearings. His head, his hands, his
face, his bangs, his expressionâ they all
came in for _. share of praise and criticism.
But his music aroused only one voice, and
that was praise. ;> ... :_'â .â "â ;
The second part ,of the programme
opened with a rare treat, four Chopin com
positions all in a cluster. And how Pad
erewski did play the -works of his great
compatriot! It is said that he enjoys
Chopin more than any other '. composer,
because Chopin was so intensely patriotic
he spoke with the voice of Paderewski's
people, and : only a Pole can thoroughly
enter into the spirit of his works and in
terpret him to others. : '-','â '
This may be true or not, but it is ; safe to
say that Paderewski played Chopin last
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1896;
night as Chopin had never been played in
San Francisco. .
; The melancholy, the tenderness, the ex
quisite grace of Chopin's music were all
breathed out in the Polish pianist's play
ing. Chopin requires more than mere tech
nical skill to do him anything like justice
. he , requires _ temperament on ';: the part of
his interpreter, and that he undoubtedly
received last night."' y ,
In the G major "Nocturne," , which
opened the Chopin collection, one' realized
more than ever the marvelous resonance of
Paderewski's lightest pianissimo* anu this
was apparent all through the Polish com
poser's works, which consisted, in ad
dition to the < "Nocturne," .of â¢ the
minor Mazurka,; No. .4 Etudes in
F major and G flat minor, a Berceuse, and
the Valse,' op. 34. These five number,
were all vociferously applauded, the
"Etude" No. 9 so much so that the pianist
repeated it, and at the end he good-na
turedly responded to a frantic demand for
an encore by giving the Valse in D flat.
Next on the 7 programme came two of
Paderewski's own works â a. 7 brilliant
"Caprice," which is not familiar here, and
the "Minuet a I' Antique," which is as
â¢well known as the "Washington Post
March.'" Of course, - Paderewski's light and
shade,; his skill | with the pedal and his
general expression added so much to its
beauties that the public went fairly wild
over it and insisted on hearing the minuet
again.' * : : .x'\ X *'â¦â "'Â«
The concert was supposed to end with
Liszt's second "Hungarian Rhapsodic,*'
but ; people were like Oliver Twist, they
wanted more, and they followed, the exam
ple of the advertisers who put on the labels
of their goods, "When you 7 ask for it,
see that you get it." Hand-clapping
and cries of "Bravo!" were the
means taken to get it last night
and when Paderewski appeared on the
stage again the ladies hurled their flowers
at him till he had to pick his |way to
the piano over bunches of violets and
roses. To all this ovation he responded
by playing Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapso
dic," No. 10, and then the 7 people went
home very much against their will, appar
ently, while "Paddy" picked up his flowers.

THE DECISION AFFIRMED
Big Suit Growing Out of the
City of Chester
Disaster.
Damages for Eleven Thousand Dollars
, Against the Oriental Steamship
Company.
The United States Court of Appeals
handed down a decision yesterday affirm
ing the decision of the lower court in the
suiÂ»of Eliza A. Smith against the Occi
dental and Oriental Steamship Company.
It will be remembered that damages in
the sum of $11,000 were allowed Mrs.
Smith and her children against the com
pany for the death of Henry Smith and
his daughter, whose live, were lost in the
disaster that befell the City of Chester.
The steamer was wrecked in the harbor
of San Francisco on August 22, 1888, hav
ing, collided with the Oceanic of the Occi
dental and Oriental Steamship Company's
line. Â The. Chester went to the bottom.
| Henry Smith and \ bis j daughter, Myrta,
- were among the drowned. His wife and
children brought two suits in the United
States District Court, one against the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company, which
owned the City of Chester, but the liabili
ties of this concern were limited to $75, and
the case was withdrawn.
The suit was continued against the own
ers :of the Oceanic, which ran into the
other steamer, and was for $75,000 in the
case of < Henry Smith and $20,000 in the
cage of his child. The sum of $10,000 was
allowed on the former complaint and $1000
on the latter. This decision of the lower
court was affirmed.
Th c court sums up the case as follows :
- This case affords an opportunity, which
should not be â  lost, for emphasizing another
rule for preventing collisions, which must be
observed by navigators. This Is found In I
article 21 of the international rules and article
25 of the act of Agust ; 19, 1890 (1 Supp.
R. S., Second Ed;, 781-788). which reads as fol
lows: "In narrow channels every steam ves
sel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep
to " that side .of ;_ the fairway or midchannel
whicn lies on the starboard side of such a yes
- The statutes of California contain a similar
provision, to which reference was made lv the
opinion of the District Judge. This rule was
violated by the Oceanic in entering the Golden
Gate on the occasion of the; disaster involved
in these suits, and the only I excuse offered for
taking the north side is | that it is | customary
for large vessels in entering to take the north
side. We cannot find in the testimony or argu
ment of counsel | any attempt to give a reason
for the alleged custom, and if it be true that!
there is such a custom, it is bad in principle
and contrary to law, * and the courts will not
recognize it as affording i any ground for ex
empting a vessel from liabilities incurred by
disregarding the law. y- :-' -
â  The decrees of the District Court are affirmed
and the causes remanded 1 , for .further proceed
ings, in accordance with this opinion.
AN OPPOSING VERDICT.
In Judge Hunt's Court Yesterday the Steam
ship Company Won.
A verdict, which stands in opposition to
the Federal Court decision, was given yes
terday in the Superior Court.
The wanaering jury from Judge Hunt's
court, which; went 'out. to find the City of
Chester ; last Wednesday, has ; returned a
verdict for the defendant in the suit of the
children? of fi John 7 and Helen Hampton,
.rhs plaintiffs were suing for damages from
tbe ,; ; Occidental t and ~ Oriental 7 Steamship
Company, for the death of their parents in
the disaster which caused > the - sinking of
tne'.City. of Chester. y This verdict means
that it has been proved that the Oceanic
was on her, course at the time of the colli
sion, and also was not to blame for the
accident.

CRUSHED UNDER A CAR
.... â  â¢ .
William Meadows Killed at â 
Clarendon Heights Yester
day Morning.
WAS COASTING DOWN GRADE.
i . â  â .-.::â¢:
Empty Cars Used .by I the Graders
Jumped From the Track at a
Sudden Turn.
William Meadows was killed at Claren
don Heights early yesterday morning.
The tract bounded by Eighteenth, Stan
yan, Ashbury and Carl streets, comprising
fourteen blocks, the property of Mrs. Pope,
has been for some time past in charge of
John W. Ferris, who has; contracted to
grade thj' property and render it available
for residence purposes. Gravity cars are
used for transporting earth and gravel to
places where filling is needed, and Mr.
Ferris and his agents have frequently cau
tioned the workmen against coasting down
the steep grades.
Shortly after 7 o'clock, work having just
commenced, Meadows and a new man
named Woods started down the incline
with four empty cars. The cars were de
scending at a terrible rate of speed, and
Woods, who was in charge of the front
brake, apprehending endeavored
to slow up, pressing the weight of his
body against the brake and exerting his
entire strength. Noticing that bis efforts
were unavailing, and that they were ap
preaching a sharp curve in the track, he
shouted to Meadows, who was at the rear
brake: XX/XX.X
"Slow her up; there's going to be j
trouble 1"
"Oh, let her go," was Meadows' only
answer, and the cars sped on until the
curve was reached. R. J. Walton, one of
the workmen in charge of a scraper., near
the curve, heard Woods' warning shout,
and looking up saw the four cars give one
bound from the track and land, in a con
fused heap several feet away. Woods was
thrown up into the air by the force of the
shock and landed with great violence upon
a pile of rock about twenty feet from the
track. ; 7 X-Xx-y.,
Meadows was under the disordered heap
of iron and splintered wood. The work
; men near by hastened to. the spot and
found the man insensible, his head being
crushed. and battered in by one of the car
wheels, which still rested upon it. A man
was sent to the telephone station on Stan-'
yan street to summon an ambulance, while
others extricated the inert form of Mead
ows from beneath the wrecked train. 'â .
At first it was believed that the man was
dead, but he was conveyed with all haste
to the Receiving Hospital. Without ' hav
ing recovered consciousness the man died.
He leaves a widow, a daughter and a son,
the last-named of whom arrived at ; the
Receiving Hospital a few minutes after
his father's remains had been taken to the
Morgue. Then the young man returned
to the family residence, 1043 Mission
street, to tell his mother and siÃter of the
death. ' â¢ *
Woods sustained a severe shock and a
number of contusions and flesh wounds.
He was able later in the day to return t<p
his lodgings without assistance. When
asked about the accident he said:
"I can remember nothing except a dread
ful moment of extreme nervous tension.
I did not have time to be afraid of being
killed. In another moment I opened my
eyes and saw the other men about me. I
didn't know-how many bones I had
broken, and moved my arms very gingerly
at first. I feel sore all over, but I am not
seriously injured. My escape was certainly
a wonderful one.".
Woods is a single man. and had been in
Mr. Ferris' employ only a short time.
Meadows had been working with the
graders for over a year and was considered
an adept in the management of cars and
other apparatus used in such work.
Immediately after the accident Mr. Fer
ris proceeded to examine the track. It was
found to be in good condition.
T. Davidson, the superintendent, also
made an examination with the same re
sult. It appears that the sad affair came
to pass through the carelessness of the
two men, who were descending at a rate
of speed utterly beyond that which a pru
dent workman would have allowed the
cars to attain. . . *
A little . over ,a ; week ago Meadows and
Woods met with what might have j been a
similar accident, though through no fault
of theirs. Both men were on a train of
cars which were being hauled up the grade
when the cable broke. On that occasion
they were fortunate enough to stop the
cars before they could collide with the oth
ers at the foot of the incline.
